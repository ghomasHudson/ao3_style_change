Draco was lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling. "I told you, Mother, I'm not in the mood to talk about Harry," he grumbled, not even looking over.
————————————————————————
Nearly half an hour later, they strolled up to the Shrieking Shack together. They stood in silence for a moment before Harry spoke softly. "Remember third year?" He asked, still gazing at the decrepit building. Draco turned to narrow his eyes at him. "When you were invisible and assaulted me quite unfairly?" He returned snarkily. Harry grinned, still not moving his eyes. "You thought the place was haunted, didn't you?" The lack of a response was enough of an answer for him.
Pansy looked up at Potter, sighed heavily, and shoved a forkful of spaghetti into Draco's mouth, effectively shutting him up. Blaise sighed in relief.
At that, Harry looked up and smiled at him. "You. When I napped with you, I didn't have any dreams at all. Hermione says that sleeping next to anything would help, human or animal." Draco nodded. "Your Granger is quite right," he declared. "You should think about getting a pet. A nice crup or kneazle would do."
He slid down the bars that kept him from falling, looping his arms around his knees and hugging them to his chest, wine glass still loosely grasped. Draco smiled when the bird followed, landing gracefully in front of him. But, wait- was the bird- was it changing? It was! The feathers were becoming longer, blacker, almost pearlescent, like an oil slick on the pavement. Some of the plumes turned white instead, especially those near the wings. The tail elongated until it was nearly twice as long as the bird itself. Its eyes were still amber, but now they were covetous and calculating.
The dynamic duo started at him expectantly. "Well?" Hermione prompted. "What was he doing?"
Harry nodded. "I think we should. I've already started trying to call you Draco in my head. And besides-" Harry looked slyly at his companion. "You've called me Harry a few times already." Draco looked startled at this news. "I have?" He asked bewilderedly. Harry nodded at him. "When you got drunk yesterday, you had no trouble calling me by my first name," he told the other boy smugly. Draco looked embarrassed.
"Of course it matters. Do you want your godfather to be forever remembered as a mass murderer? I know the Ministry admitted he was innocent, but they never told us what actually happened. Thirteen years of thinking of him as a killer is not so easily changed, especially when the truth remains mostly hidden. The name Sirius Black will always have negative connotations, otherwise. Don't you want to fix that?" Draco demanded.
Harry looked at himself in the mirror. His cheeks were stained a dark red, his eyes bright, and his pupils just as dilated as Malfoy's had been. He could only see a small ring of green around them. He raised a shaking hand to his cheek in an echo of what Malfoy had done just a few minutes before.
"Nightmares?" Draco asked him. Harry nodded. "Well," Draco adopted a thoughtful expression. "I could always share your bed if that'll help," Draco smirked and fluttered his eyelashes flirtatiously, causing Harry to have a coughing fit.
"No," Harry disagreed. "The answer is no."
"Huh." Harry frowned. "I never noticed that." Draco sighed in utter frustration. "You were a seeker, Harry. To be honest, most Quidditch players have those kinds of muscles. Beaters more so than others."
Draco stopped. The battle was over. He had lost. It was time to go, and he needed to get home. The other Death Eaters were ahead, and it was every man for himself. He needed to get to the Manor if only so he could spend a few hours with his parents before their inevitable capture. But that voice, that unfortunately familiar voice, was enough to make him halt.
"Harry," Draco murmured into the other boy's mouth. Their fifth kiss was chaste, sweet even. They were taking the time to just explore and feel, to experience but not get lost in the sensations.
Harry rolled his eyes. As he handed over the plant, he said, "Would it kill you to say please, Malfoy?"
Potter was silent once more, awaiting the court's final decision. The Chief Warlock's face was pale and sickly when he called for the vote. "All in favor of declaring the defendant guilty, raise your hands."
Harry decided that it was a good time to interject. "He'll be even more delighted than you, I'd wager." Parkinson jumped and turned around, startled. Draco's reaction was less overt; he merely stiffened before facing Harry.
Draco was planning on staying silent out of spite, but that was not conducive to finding out what the hell was going on. "What do you want with me?" he demanded.
"Yes?" Draco nearly purred. He was aware he was being a little shit, but he also really didn't care.
Harry shook himself and smiled unsteadily. "Nothing," he assured Draco, but he wasn't having it. "Obviously something has you this shaken up. What did she do?" He said through gritted teeth. Harry sighed. "It wasn't her. She was actually pretty helpful in that Slytherin way you guys have. You know, with that backhanded kindness. It's just-" he hesitated "-her perfume." His eyes became unfocused once more. "It made me understand."
Draco let out a bark of laughter. "I love it when you go all Slytherin on me, Harry. But-" the other boy leaned closer again. This time, his lips brushed Harry's ear as he spoke, and Harry shivered at the new, feather-light sensation. "-what did we say about calling me Malfoy?" An involuntary shiver clawed its way through Harry's body as he was reminded of the broom closet from over a week ago. He could only pray Draco didn't notice.
"Potter," Draco grinned, biting into the apple. Potter's eyes widened, and he didn't say anything back. Draco cocked his head and swallowed. "I suppose I should thank you, Potter. I have a very vague memory of Blaise saying he would ask you to take me back to our room. Judging by the fact I woke up in my own bed, I presume he found you?" Draco asked, raising an eyebrow in question. Potter nodded, gaining an apprehensive look.
Thank you for ridding the world of him.
"Isn't this wonderful, Draco? People will talk for ages about the amazing party I threw! Did you want something to drink?" Draco nodded and asked for a cocktail. After expertly mixing the drink, Pansy slid the glass over to him. She gave him an appraising look. "Are you okay, darling?" She asked with a concerned tone. Draco shook his head but didn't elaborate, instead opting to toss his drink back. He set the glass down and tapped it, silently asking for more. Pansy wordlessly poured him more of the same concoction, shooting him another worried look.
——————————————————
Draco still did not meet his eyes. Harry gently reached up and took hold of his chin, tilting his face so he could look into his favorite gray eyes, even as they didn't look into his.
A few days later, it was the weekend. Draco and Blaise were sitting in Blaise's empty dorm. Pansy was, unfortunately, quite ill.
Pansy was still fuming. She tapped her spiky, black heels on the floor impatiently. Draco sighed again.
Together, they walked down to Hogsmeade. The trip was short, and they spent it in comfortable silence. When they reached the village, Draco turned to Harry and asked, "Where to, Chosen One?" The brunet scowled at him but still took his hand, leading him towards their destination. When Draco saw the establishment they were heading towards, he immediately protested. "The Hog's Head, Harry? That place is terribly dirty, and the lighting is awful. I heard most of the food is inedible! Why don't we go to the Three Broomsticks instead, I bet it'll be warm and-" he stopped when they approached the door, not wanting the owner to hear him.
Harry sagged in relief. He felt the insane urge to laugh but then quickly thought better of it. "Er-" he said intelligently. Draco, who was avoiding looking at him, tugged at Parkinson's arm. "It's okay, Pans. Let it go." She turned her rage on him.
When class ended, they had made the most progress, even more than Parkinson and Hermione, who looked disappointed. Snape merely dismissed them, telling them they would continue next class.
The man raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "I want nothing, Your Highness. Your father, on the other hand, wishes you to return. His Majesty believes it is high time you, ah, reconsidered your resolution to leave."
He could only keep it up for so long. On the fourth day, Harry inexplicably and mysteriously found himself bidding everyone goodbye at the door with a don't worry, I'll be back after Christmas. None of them were surprised, and even Molly didn't try to convince him to stay. Harry blinked as he was suddenly outside, in the cold, with a huge rhubarb pie foisted upon him by Molly, preparing to appear at the door of the Manor with not a single warning nor a by-your-leave.
Visualize your animagus form, the instructions read. Allow it to fill your mind until you think of nothing else.
The small group of six houses - huts, really - certainly did not seem to qualify. Built in a somewhat circular shape, the little gathering more resembled a camping trip, or even a small cult if he was being really imaginative. Draco didn't know what to expect from them, and he didn't know if they were wizards or not.
Since lessons were starting in ten minutes, he stuffed the letter into his bag and hurried off to Flitwick's classroom.
Wilson nodded at him. "That was quite clever what you did with the owl. They've all become impervious to tracking spells through breeding, but there's nothing to stop you from following one. A good head like yours is exactly what we need in Aurors."
Harry sat up. There was no point trying to sleep now - he was too awake. He sighed irritatedly and slid off the bed onto his feet. He seized the cloak and map, tucked his wand into the waistband of his pajamas, and left the dorm. Any noise he might have made was covered up by the sound of three snoring boys.
"I just don't get how we're meant to accomplish the Transfiguration. I understand the concept of it, but the execution seems nearly impossible with all the variables we have to keep track of. Is there something we could do to help improve our focus and multitasking abilities?"
"Why, my theory that you could have been spending your years at Hogwarts quite a bit more productively! These youngsters have you beat!" Hermione exclamed, clearly having the time of her life.
——————————————————
Draco allowed himself a moment to celebrate. This wasn't so hard. Undoubtedly, Harry's father and his friends had found it more difficult because of the transfiguration in the beginning. And maybe because they were younger when they attempted it, they had trouble with focusing. Draco didn't want to think about the possibility that maybe he had only done all the easy bits, and the worst was yet to come.
After a long, tiresome journey that Draco tried his hardest to sleep through, the Weasley managed to get them into Improper Use. Following a rushed explanation of his predicament, they were directed to a woman named Suzanna Peterson, a doddery old lady that had to be at least ninety years old. She peered at Draco over her overlarge spectacles, muttered something that sounded shockingly rude for such an ancient woman, and gave an excessively large sigh.
She sighed dramatically. "I have a problem, Potter. Would you like to hear what it is?"
The brunet turned to him and raised an eyebrow. "What about you, then?"
"Okay, everyone," he said, all-business. "We're going to form a perimeter around the house - disillusionment charms are necessary since there's little cover. Smith, Johnson, Miller, come with me. We'll go in through the front. Harris, Murphy, you go around the back and see if there's another exit. Ivanov, Joseph, you stay outside and make sure the kidnapper doesn't escape. Professor, would you like to stay outside or come with us?"
Malfoy noticed him looking. "What now, Potter?"
And his reason for getting smashed was even more pathetic. That article, with Potter looking all heroic, wise, and just plain good. It was enough to make anyone gag, but with him, it instilled a deep, burning rage, accompanied by an intense sense of envy. He should have been on the front page, not that righteous prick. He was a Malfoy, and before this Dark Lord-war-Potter business, that had meant a glittering life full of glamor, prestige, and endless lovers. He would have married the best of the best, stayed in the manor forever, and never have had to work a day in his life. Now, he would be lucky if anyone wanted to marry a hopeless pariah. The manor had been seized by the ministry, and he wouldn't work because Potter had taken the one job he wanted, and Draco wasn't about to be his colleague. At least he was still rich.
Harry huffed. "It's not your fault. It's Voldemort's. He's the one that ordered you and the one that threatened you. It's entirely his fault. And if you really want, you can blame your father for messing up at the Ministry and making Voldemort angry. Really, it's my fault for getting away in 5th year." Harry said confidently, looking slightly crestfallen at his realization.
"Ewww," Ron grimaced. "Please don't do that in front of me, you'll put me off my food."
"So, Malfoy," Harry began, "I was thinking-"
He suddenly exploded, his back arching and toes curling, spraying the shower wall. He gasped, eyes fluttering open as he rode out the waves of pleasure, mind filled with grey eyes staring into his own.
Draco let out a bark of laughter. "I truly love it when you go all Slytherin on me, Harry. But-" the blond leaned closer again. This time, his lips brushed Harry's lobe as he spoke. "-what did we say about calling me Malfoy?" Draco felt rather than saw the shudder that went through Harry's body as he was reminded of the broom closet incident. The other boy's breaths were coming quicker now.
"And," Draco continued, "we're massive idiots. We were so obviously attracted to each other. However, I cannot believe I acted like such a Gryffindor. Also, if that was one of the memories, I simply cannot wait to see the others. And on a completely unrelated note, I'm never drinking again." Harry burst out laughing at that.
The Weasley twins cheerfully ignored his protests and began to show all three of them around their new shop. And of course, they told Harry he could get whatever he liked, free of cost. Harry insisted on paying, though, and they walked out of the shop with pockets bulging with things Filch would most definitely screech at them for if he saw.
Not that Draco was complaining all that much.
"And besides, not much rhymes with Wheezes," the other added.
"Next time, knock! I thought you purebloods had manners!" He said angrily.
"Animagus?"
After what seemed like at least an hour of wandering the enormous estate, they finally reached a set of gilded double doors. Walters stopped and gestured for him to continue alone. "His Majesty will be waiting for you inside. If I may offer a bit of advice," Walters leaned in close, "try not to anger him as usual. He's been in a right mood since you left."
"Fine. Miffy!" Harry said loudly.
No. This was not his father. This was some other man. The king, if everyone else was to be believed. But somehow, the king looked exactly like his father and had acknowledged Draco as the prince.
In the most unlikely pairing possible, Ron and Draco had seemingly teamed up to drag him out of bed and force him to do things. Like laze about in the common room and play chess and exploding snap.
The bartender did a double-take when he saw Draco, and that did nothing to improve his mood. Why did everyone suddenly recognize him? It wasn't like he had been front-page news!
Hermione smiled reassuringly at him. "Of course, Harry. Let us know if you want company, though."
Draco cleared his throat. "Both of you know Harry, my boyfriend." He stumbled over the word boyfriend, which Harry found utterly endearing. Draco spoke to him while spreading some jam on a piece of toast, "And, Harry, you know Blaise and Pansy, my sometimes friends."
At that exact instant, Ron chose to plop on the bench next to Harry. "Why are we sitting here?" He moaned in complaint, already reaching for a scone. "Feels weird on this side of the hall," he added before his mouth became otherwise occupied.
And now Harry noticed what kind of a position they were in. Their bodies were pressed up together, Draco pinned against the wall. Harry's face was very close to Draco's, so close that their breaths were mingling together. Suddenly his bad mood evaporated and was replaced by a rush of excitement and arousal.
“Where am I? Why am I here? Who brought me here? Where’s my wand? What’s a wand, why did I just say that?” He continued listing questions until Draco guided him to the slide and softly told him that he should stay put and really try to answer those questions. Draco turned back to Harry with a signature eye roll and gestured for them to continue, he could never fail to be in absolute awe of his friend.
They nodded and Draco spoke up. “What’s your happy memory, dad?”
Draco held his hand and squeezed it, earning a grateful, sad smile.
Tell me what you want from this fic (couples, stupid tropes I could fit in the background) It's going to have a happy ending because I don't have the stomach for a sad one, but it is going to be pretty angsty along the way so tell me some fluff you'd like to see to soften the blow :)
Remus wiped a stray tear from his cheek and laughed too. “You’re right, actually. He’d love that his son had cool fire powers.”
“I’ll be owling your parents about this - I mean, Mr and Mr Lupin-Black.”
“Dad?” he tried to say, but Remus had already seen it and alerted Sirius so.
Harry remembered the fire incident and explained to Draco how he never felt the sun like everyone else did, that he usually didn’t feel any different stepping outside into it’s blinding rays. The other boy bit his lip and reached under Harry’s bed, emerging with the book that Draco had gotten him in first year. He looked up at Harry, unsure.
Now, Draco was sprawled, face first on the covers of his Slytherin bed, listening to Harry get ready for bed. He probably should too, but he was too knackered. The room was empty apart from himself, Harry, and a boy by the name of Blaise Zabini who was passed out in the bed farthest from them. Harry had chosen the bed nearest the wall and Draco had chosen the one right next to him, desperate for any resemblance of a friend he could get. Harry had been good to him so far. He wasn’t big headed or arrogant, just shy. He seemed to be just as desperate for a friend as Draco was, which helped. Especially seeing as he was certain that he would lose Harry as a friend earlier that day in the Entrance Hall.
“Don’t worry, cub. I’m sure you’ll get into a lot more trouble soon enough.”
“Are you really Harry Potter?”
The complication over who Harry would be staying with over that period of time became a lot more complicated after the whole ‘Heir of Slytherin’ debacle. Nobody seemed to want to take on the young Parseltongue, even if it was only for five weeks of the year. It was going to be the Finnigan’s, but they backed out, and the Thomas’s were a no-go once the Finnigan’s didn’t want to. Remus was actually going to firecall Molly Weasley and try to convice her, but it was a longshot.
Checking the map to make sure he wouldn't run into anyone, he wandered about the corridors under his cloak. With a start, he remembered that he no longer needed to sneak about; the 8th years were not forbidden from being out of bed in the middle of the night. Still, Harry preferred not to run into anyone, so he kept the cloak on.
Once they arrived, they set about finding an empty table. The library was surprisingly quite full, even though it was only the beginning of the year. Draco spotted Theo and Granger at different tables, but he wanted to be alone with Harry.
Draco smirked at him. Harry could only just make out the blond's signature look in the dark room. "That's because I rather prefer putting things in my mouth to having things come out of it."
Harry had chosen that moment to say something about Slytherins, mind games, and what have I gotten myself into, but Draco was too busy reveling in the glory of outwitting his mother to pay him any mind.
"-come to visit us! Did you like-"
"Harry," Shacklebolt said in his deep, soothing timbre. "Please tell me you are not here for the reason I think you are." Harry straightened. "Minister-" he began. "Kingsley," Shacklebolt interrupted him with a smile. "Please, call me Kingsley."
It wasn't even the owner of the voice that he hated so much, not anymore. Once maybe, but he had not hated the Golden Boy for a long time now. Yes, he went through the motions, but the resentment and jealousy, yes jealousy, behind them had mysteriously vanished. And besides, any self-respecting Slytherin would do their utmost to ingratiate themself to the most powerful wizard of their generation, and Draco was nothing if not a Slytherin.
"Tell me, Potter. Why did you blush this morning?" He asked silkily, stopping in front of the boy.
Draco woke up early on Christmas morning, as usual, not even pausing to enjoy the sight of Harry Potter in his bed. His mother had suggested a guest room, of course, and Draco had accepted immediately, ignoring Harry's side glance.
"Parkinson," he greeted back warily.
The Boy Who Lived currently resides at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, finishing out his final year of education along with the unusual, one-time group of eighteen-year-olds that include such war-heroes as Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom. They plan to take the notoriously tricky NEWT level exams at the end of the year, which were interrupted and did not occur last year due to the infamous so-called 'Battle of Hogwarts.' But studying has not been the only thing on Harry Potter's mind as of late.
Harry pointed in the direction of the house he had seen. "There's some kind of a building over there. I'm certain he's inside."
Harry covered his face in embarrassment while Ron roared with laughter. Hermione just shook her head, smiling. After he recovered, Harry stormed into the busy shop, quickly locating the bright red hair that denoted a Weasley. The twin turned and spotted Harry, his eyes lighting up. When he saw the expression on his face, he suddenly gained a sparkle in his eye and pulled the other twin seemingly out of thin air.
Draco Malfoy
(See the end of the chapter for
"But my mark...it burned. It only burns when he..." Draco trailed off. Harry felt regret flood through him. "I'm sorry, that was my fault. I touched it, but I didn't think it would burn like that." Draco looked at him in shock.
Less than half raised their hands.
Draco glanced at everyone, Harry last. "Can I hex her?" he begged. "Just the one time?"
Draco was waiting just outside the doors, but Harry grabbed his wrist and pulled him further along a hallway. He glanced both directions, then pulled Draco into the closest empty classroom. He let go of his wrist, turning to face an impassive Draco. "What is it, Potter?" He asked coolly.
"How can you not know where he is?" the woman screamed back. "Because of you, my fiancé is gone! We were supposed to go to Italy and get married soon! We were in love, and now you've taken him away from me. I swear you will regret the day you crossed the Biellos!"
Draco had been flying for at least an hour. With untrained muscles and a completely different body structure, it was a miracle that he had even made it that far. But, he desperately needed to land soon. The problem was that there was absolutely nothing for many kilometers around. He didn't even know if he was going in the right direction.
"Then come here, you prat, so you can properly enjoy it this time." Draco's eyes lit up, and he did exactly that.
"What was that?" Draco asked suspiciously, but it would have sounded more threatening if Harry had been able to hear him properly. He rolled his eyes. "Can I get up now?" He asked in a fake-nice voice. "No," was Draco's petulant response. "Then you leave me no choice," Harry said dramatically, pretending to be resigned. Before Draco could respond, he flipped the two of them, so he was on top of Draco. Draco squeaked in surprise. Harry pushed up onto his forearms and saw the other boy staring at him in shock. Harry smirked at him, then leaned down. Draco's breath hitched, and Harry smiled at that, before continuing down until his mouth was beside Draco's ear.
Sources say that Potter has been dating the notorious Death Eater Draco Malfoy, also an Eighth Year student at Hogwarts. Within the school, students have reported what had seemed to be a budding friendship between the two Eighth Year classmates. Until recently, nothing further had been confirmed, though several rumors had abounded about the nature of their relationship. Just this past weekend, however, Malfoy and Potter were seen together in Hogsmeade, presumably on a date. On Monday, the two publicly held hands in front of the entire school populace, though they made no further efforts to inform the wizarding world at large.
Magpies are one of the most intelligent species of birds, and they can even recall the faces of people and remember whether those people are safe or harmful. Magpies often mate for life.
The first time, Draco nearly managed it. His only mistake was forgetting the tail - not a life-threatening error, but it would make flying impossible. He was only lucky that he hadn't forgotten something much more important, like internal organs. In fact, he was lucky that Alina hadn't warded against magic altogether - allowing wandless magic would be the thing to save him.
"That's pretty smart," Draco said. "Alright, come closer, scarhead." Harry grimaced and scooted until he was right in front of Draco. The blond examined his face carefully, scrutinizing every feature. Harry shifted uncomfortably.
Draco shot her a look, but Harry couldn't see his expression from where he was standing.
Seamus looked delighted to be the one to inform him, then leaned in to whisper conspiratorially. "Apparently, Malfoy and his buddies were talking about you. Malfoy was loudly denying that he was attracted to you. He also was adamant that you two aren't-" he paused, seeming slightly embarrassed, "shagging." He finished.
Draco gazed at him, making some assessment of his features. He must have seen something there because he nodded, reaching for Harry's hand. Heart filling with warmth, he took it, squeezing it gently and leading the other boy towards the doors.
McGonagall sighed. "Mr. Potter," she began, "while logical, your idea is a bit far fetched. Self-studying to become an animagus is uniquely challenging, and while I have no doubt Mr. Malfoy is capable of it, that's an unlikely series of events. If you are correct," she surveyed him over he glasses, "then he will most likely return to Hogwarts at his earliest convenience, and we must wait for that to happen. It's more likely that Miss Biello sent him somewhere and refused to tell us where."
Draco bowed his head. Regret crashed into him. He had done each and every one of those things. There was no chance of him walking free. The prosecution began, and he mindlessly answered questions about the war, his conversations with the Dark Lord, and his mission to kill Dumbledore. He spoke in a monotone voice, his brain had stopped functioning, and it was all he could do to give them the answers they sought. When the prosecutor was finished, he had a smug smile on his face as if he knew he had won. Draco knew it too. His case was hopeless. He would do any punishment they gave him willingly. It would be his penance, his apology to Dumbledore, and every student he had ever hurt. Because he knew he deserved it.
Malfoy was the one to break it. "Shall I call you Harry now? It's strange, but it would be stranger if we kept calling each other Potter and Malfoy." Malfoy- Draco- sounded nervous.
Draco rolled his eyes. "And everyone thought I was the melodramatic one. Truly, I don't mind the scars. It reminds me of how awful we were and how far we've come. I am filled with awe every time I look at them, not hate." Harry couldn't believe he didn't blame him.
"I'm sorry, Draco, I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. I didn't regret it either. It's only that...well, whenever I find someone that makes me happy, it never works out." Harry moved closer, his chest brushing against Draco's back. "Sirius was the only chance I had at a father-figure, and I only knew him for two years, most of which we spent apart. Then Cho and Gin, neither of them worked out. I'm always waiting for the moment when Hermione and Ron will have to leave me too. I used to think they would go because I always put them in danger, now I think it will be when they finally get married and move into a place of their own. They'll start a family, and I'll never be fully a part of it. I'm just...I've learned to not hope for anything, to always expect the worst, because then I'll never be disappointed." Harry tugged Draco's hand, pulling him around, so they were facing each other, eyes immediately connecting.
Draco finally found the page he was looking for. Step 6: Complete Transformation. This was it; it was now or never. He would become an animagus at this very moment, or he would be taken to Italy, perhaps never to see Britain again. Draco had managed to finish Step 4 (Simultaneous Partial Transformation) and Step 5 (Sensory Transformation) only days prior. The latter had been the most disorienting, giving him the enhanced hearing and eyesight of a dragon, as well as the ability to practically taste the air around him. Draco had also been able to see heat, and looking down at himself proved that he had been far warmer than a normal human should have been. It was fascinating, but almost too much for him to handle.
"Don't you 'Pans' me! Where the fuck have you been all summer? We had to read about the result of your trial in the papers! And we didn't hear shit from you the rest of the summer, even though you were clearly fine! And now you come in here, acting like everything is perfectly alright and we didn't spend the entirety of three months worrying our asses off! What do you have to say for yourself?"
Careful. One time doesn't mean he's changed.
"That's not a good start," Harry muttered, spreading the article on the table before them so they could both read it.
Thankfully, they made it to class on time. Draco slid into his seat next to Potter, who was staring off into space. He hadn't even noticed Draco's arrival. Draco cleared his throat, amused when Potter jumped and looked around for the source of the disruption.
Harry felt desperation rise in him. He never wanted to see that expression on Draco again. He wondered how he was ever capable of gaining joy from that expression. It was so forlorn, so heartbroken, even with a face as inexpressive as his was. His masks were insurmountable and innumerable; Harry felt a great sense of accomplishment every time he broke through the walls. The boy had far too many years of training and had needed those masks when the Dark Lord reigned in his house. He was grateful for those masks even as he detested them. He despised seeing Draco as sad as he was while loving that he allowed him to witness it. It tested the very boundaries of his heart, holding so many conflicting feelings.
Harry slumped in his seat. "Fine. I snuck out last night because I heard Draco leave our room. I wanted to see what he was doing so late, or rather, early."
Draco stared at him for a moment. "And one might say you're being quite Slytherin right now. Manipulating me, so I'll do what you want. You should know," Draco leaned in closer to murmur in Harry's ear, "you can't manipulate the master manipulator. That's why I'm the prince of Slytherin, and you're Gryffindor's Golden Boy, Harry." Harry felt his eyes grow wide, and his breath hitched at Draco's proximity, as well as the onset of memories prompted by his whispered name.
Well, that explained why Potter knew so much. And why Dumbledore had been talking to himself just before Draco got there. But Draco hadn't seen anyone else up there, he had made sure of that. But damn, he had forgotten about Potter's bloody invisibility cloak. That thing was a nuisance, it really was. Draco didn't think it was fair Potter had it.
"I...oh sod it. Fuck space." Harry nearly growled, then surged forwards. His lips crashed into Draco's, and suddenly Draco found himself kissing Harry Potter for the second time ever.
Remus smiled and shook his head fondly. Sirius marvelled at the way the other boy managed to make his heart skip with such a small movement.
Finally, Harry’s features softened a little. “Fine. But if more bad things start happening, I’m doing more research on it.”
“Oh, shush.” he scoffed. “Even if that’s true, there is no way I am letting you be the hero again, Harry.”
Harry sighed and rolled his eyes, as though he could have explained it any better than he did. “You have to drink the tea, silly.”
“Didn’t you see the trapped door under its feet?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” the other boy demanded, and started puffing out his chest in an intimidating motion.
“Are you keeping an eye on me? Making sure I don’t hurt anyone?” said Draco.
“Dumby.” It sounded like more of a growl that a word, but everyone understood.
“Hello, Hagrid. We were actually just talking about you!” Ron said, clearly thrilled at the interruption. “We want to ask you about an animal.” Hagrid nodded at him to continue. “What do you know about three-headed dogs?”
“Are you and Draco okay? Did you have a fight or something?” Ron’s face was ghastly white, but all of his colour returned with a relieved sigh when Harry reassured him that they did not. Not only was Ron worried about their supposed fight, as were their Slytherin gang, who had been on eggshells all week, not speaking unless spoken to and avoiding all snarky comments, even when Draco’s hair looked like a birds nest. One night in particular, when they were all gathered around the fire in the Slytherin common room, there came a ripple in their group dynamic. Blaise and Theo were immersed in a game of Wizards Chess, Pansy and Millicent were doing each other’s nails and whispering, and Draco was contentedly piping out a silly tune on his harmonica. It was happy and light and it made Harry feel quite relaxed. Suddenly, he stopped, freezing, and everyone looked up. His eyes were fixed on the fire.
Draco groaned. “Merlin.”
Draco didn’t know what to say. For the first time in his life, he was truly paralysed with fear. But Harry spoke up for him.
“How?” asked Harry, but Draco rolled his eyes as if to say ‘Isn’t it obvious?’ and Lockhart looked even more confused than earlier, but this time was trying desperately to school his features into a pensive mask.
So everyone was resolutely refusing to speak up about werewolves when they were asked to, because they knew it would only give Snape ammunition.
“Come with me, Argus. You too, Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy.”
“Pads, move out the way.” came Remus’s calming tones. Oddly enough, Harry could just about see his Professor’s face lurking in the flames of the fire. “What can I do for you, Severus?” he asked, wearily.
Remus wasn’t sure. He didn’t much like the idea of teaching in a class of privileged pure-blood brats, who wouldn’t listen to him simply because he answered to the moon’s strict rules, but Draco needed him. As did those privileged pure-blood brats, they needed somebody to teach them a better way of viewing the world. They needed a competent Defense teacher.  “Yes, but on one condition.”
Wiping and pocketing the map, Harry stuffed it into his bag, and hurried up a large flight of stairs, speaking the password briskly when he was outside the common room, and hurrying in. He scanned the crowd, and sure enough, found the blonde haired boy sat on one of the large leather couches with a book clutched in his hand.
“Dirty rat.” Sirius spat. Remus held up a calming hand.
“I want to know why Potter and Malfoy were there, anyway.”
“You should do it, you’d be amazing.”
“No idea,” replied Myrtle. “I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away… and then I came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she’d ever laughed at my glasses.”
Shits about to get pretty angsty so enjoy this little bit of fluffy shmoopy shmoop with a little dusting of context driven angst...
“Yes, I’ll tell you everything.” Pads had stepped away by now, sensing that it wasn’t his moment, and conjured a few extra seats to go beside the one that Draco had been occupying before. When everyone was seated, Moony took a deep breath and looked Draco right in the eye. “Draco, I am aware that we really should have told you this before but I was honestly scared and I didn't think that anybody would know. I'm sorry you had to find out like this.”
"We have to be."
“Ron’s just being dramatic.” Draco said to Harry after finding out about the incident. “He never really liked Scabbers anyway, and I reckon it’s a good thing anyway. Pads said we should be wary of it, for all we know it’s a mass murderer animagus hiding under the disguise of a family rat.” He said this with a wry smile. “At least it’s dead now. We don’t have to hear from it again.”
Thank you for all of your comments <3
Sirius growled. “That’s not going to happen.”
“Look, I just don’t understand why you would put yourself in danger for this!”
“Still. Not. Happening. Surely we can figure something out.” The two men were standing up from their seats, now towering over Dumbledore, who was still seated.
Sirius did glare at Ron’s rat quite a bit, but Harry shrugged that off.
“Moons, the kid has been at the school for three fucking weeks and he’s already found a potentially dangerous animal!” Sirius was chucking on skinny jeans, a white t-shirt and a leather jacket while he was talking, and Remus couldn’t quite help but enjoy the show he was watching. Realistically, he knew that he should be more worried about the animal, but he himself was once the Hogwarts beast, and he had a soft spot for it.
“For all eternity.” On the last line, Remus held onto his hands tighter, like he was afraid he would slip away.
“He would. But what would we do with Harry?” Remus was agitated, the full moon was coming up and he didn’t need the extra pressure. Draco had apologised at the end of his letter, actually, for stressing him out.
I think to me it would smell like melting chocolate, the mango body scrub from the body shop and something floral like rose or something.
“Give it to Dumbledore.”
“...Not on Christmas. But, maybe sometime? Would that be okay?” Draco had never seen Harry look so scared, even when they were fighting the troll or running from Filch.
“You don’t need to raise your hand, Harry, this isn’t like a regular class.”
Harry stammered. “I… I just thought… I thought I heard something, Professor.”
“Dunno. He wouldn’ take his cloak off.” Harry inwardly groaned, that’s what he was afraid of. “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s head - that’s one of the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mighn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”
i'm taking my gcses, or at least the pandemic equivalent of, in two weeks and then its just a half term of exams, which sucks because i don't have much time to write. i'm going my best, and i intend to take full advantage of this easter holiday i'm having right now BUT the wonderful thing is that after i'm finished with my exams i have 12 weeks of summer holiday and pretty much nothing to fill them with - so that means i'll hopefully be writing more!
His friend shook his head once more. “When I know what I want to get a tattoo of, then I will get one. Until then, I don’t see any reason to scar my body any more than it already is.”
“At 11:30? No, that bastard is hiding from us!” Remus sighed again and yanked Sirius out of the fire.
If Harry was a Horcrux, and basilisk venom kills horcruxes, why didn't the Horcrux part of him die when he was bitten? Did Fawkes cure the Horcrux as well as him? I know everyone talks about this but it genuinely confuses me.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That sounds lovely! We can get drinks at the Three Broomsticks!” The bushy haired girl began listing all of the things one could possibly do in Hogsmeade and Harry squeezed Draco’s hand.
School is a bit better now, which is good. I think I just needed to get used to being around assholes every day lol.
“So, what is this? Why are you carrying around some old parchment?” The Professor asked.
“Very. It feels very good to know that I don’t have to see them again.” The look on Harry’s face was heartbreaking. For Draco, the boy symbolised hope and beauty. It hurt him to know that there were people who were anything but kind to him.
The staffroom itself seemed to have had nothing changed since the last time when he and Harry had infiltrated it, that was until the wardrobe in which they had hidden gave a sudden wobble, as though a creature was hiding in its depths. Surprisingly, Snape was reclined in one of the low armchairs but departed soon after they entered, sniping out a few rude comments about Neville, who Remus ended up choosing to help with the demonstration.
Harry thought about this. “Nah. You guys keep a hold of the other one, I’ll just keep running away from it. I’ll be fine.” The other boy didn’t look to reassured, but did what Harry said nonetheless. It was good, because Harry had seen a glint of gold near the bottom of the teacher’s stand. He raced towards it, a bludger on his tail, but had to turn around when he realised that the glint was just someone’s lost watch.
The girl was exceedingly strange, and it wasn’t surprising that she was known as Moaning Myrtle. She wailed and cried unendingly, always upset about something. Today, it was that someone had thrown a book at her.
“So -- back again, Harry?” Harry jumped and turned fearfully to face the old man.
“It wasn’t an animal though.” Draco pouted.
"See you later." he smirked.
“What? Hagrid, he’s an eleven year old boy!”
.” in his ear, which Draco ignored.
“How- how…” He coughed and tried again, paying no heed to the hot tears spilling from his eyes. “How did you know?”
“Now?”
Remus and Sirius shared a look. “Do you want to tell him, Pads?”
“Anytime.” Ron was still giving him evils, but it was a process. Harry rushed up to him and gave him a tight, but short, hug and then released. “Harry, I think that was the least of what we’ll be facing tonight.” The other boy shook himself and put on what Draco now called his ‘Hero’ mask, the face he used to make everyone around him automatically feel safer. He felt that maybe they should unpack his need to calm people down and save the day at some point, but now was not that point. “Let’s go, shall we?”
“Oh! I LOVE it!” He jumped up and down on the balls of his feet in possibly the cutest way ever, in Harry’s opinion, and hugged Harry from behind. “I just love love.”
Harry’s head jolted up and he began dissecting his expression with his eyes. “You mean…”
“No, we need to tell Dumbledore that his staff are as incompetent as he is!”
“How do we know it wasn’t one of your Gryffindors?” Flint grunted, with a pointed look towards Oliver.
” Harry’s eyes widened. “What is that?” He took the hat down from his head and revealed the ruby-encrusted hilt of what looked like a sword. Curiously, Draco watched as the boy grasped it and revealed the most gorgeous piece of weaponry he had ever seen.
Molly was lovely. She was a total mother hen and fussed around him in a way that made his heart long for his own mother, but he still welcomed it nonetheless, even though the rest of the Weasleys seemed to resent it.
“Five more minutes…”
“Affirm my love for you, Sirius Orion Black.”
And thus the group launched into a conversation about the champions that carried them until it was time to get to bed. Harry and Draco decided through a series of pointed looks that they should sleep in their own beds, which was something they hadn’t done since Draco was in the hospital, and it made Harry slightly uneasy. But he calmed himself through a series of deep breaths that mingled with the sounds of sleep coming from his roommates.
“Peter?” Harry asked. “Is that the name of the boy from the pictures?”
As the words Draco spoke manipulating the air around him in soft, lilting tones, Harry allowed the story to encompass his thoughts and take him on a journey.
“Oh no, not you.”
Ron was just as he remembered him, after he apologised for making such a snap judgement about him, they ended up becoming really close, closer than they were before, even.
“Lupin! I want a word.” There came no reply. Snape muttered something about how he must be at home and called out the address of the Lupin-Black’s residence.
“Isn’t that kind of stupid, though?”
“DON’T answer that, Dumby, or it’ll be the last thing you ever do!”
Harry obeyed and they began the long walk to Remus’s office. Once they got settled with crackling fire and some chocolate, Remus produced the map and stared at Harry speculatively.
Remus rubbed his eyes and yawned. “I’m fine, Pete. Just tired.”
Draco seemed to grit his teeth. “An animagus can transform on command. A werewolf cannot.” It was the most succinct answer he could give. The class held their breath as they wondered how their teacher would twist his words.
“Ha! I wish!”
“A werewolf is a highly dangerous creature. Upon contact with one you should take great caution. I will not be teaching you how to defend yourselves against one, that would only encourage you. But I will be teaching you about them.” he said. “Turn to page 394.”
“Oh my god!” Harry screamed. “That was the train!”
“What’s that?”
“I don’t know, she doesn’t look it.”
It started off on a high though, as Harry was forced to be the first one to approach the creature. Which was, as expected, intimidating, but after getting the green light from it, he felt instantly calmer. A feeling that didn’t last long as Hagrid scooped him up and planted him right on the animal’s back.
“Oh.”
Sirius looked at Remus with such unwavering devotion that it made Minerva feel like crying like some childish schoolgirl. She really hoped the oncoming storm wouldn’t tear them apart.
When they were finally in their headmaster’s office, both of them rushed forward to be embraced by Moony and Pads, who were already in there, waiting for them. Draco couldn’t stop himself from crying in relief, he didn’t think he would ever see his dads again.
He smiled and put it down again. “What were my parent’s Patronuses?”
“What is it?” Pads patted him on the shoulder, signalling that they would talk about it later, but at that moment Draco didn’t care. Harry was finally back and they were going to spend the whole year together.
“It’s a shape-shifter,” Hermione had explained “It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us the most.”
“But, it means that you can’t have children!”
shits been crazy, life is moving forward at a rapid pace and i’ve been struggling to keep up but - you know what? here i am!
“Yeah, maybe they’ll understand.”
“I’m good.” He nodded. “I’m sad I didn’t get to spend Easter with Draco’s family, and I don’t really know why I couldn’t, but it’s not that bad.” Something about the fire burning in the heath and the tartan decorations made Harry feel safe, and he wanted to open up to the woman.
It is m00n-riverr
When Draco got back, the boys spent every moment that they could in the other’s company, making up for lost time, even if that lost time was only two weeks, but they also dove headfirst into research again. They even enlisted the help of ghosts around the school, but they were little help. All they did was shudder and refuse to comment, even the Bloody Baron, who was known for discussing dark topics with students. They were all but ready to give up hope until Draco suggested that they try Moaning Myrtle, as a last resort.
“However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or possible.” The pair sat in a comfortable silence for a little while. A small part of Harry was confused at Dumbledore’s blatant ignorance of his question after Draco. Usually, if he didn’t want to answer a question, he would do it, but not directly. In the most confusing and pretentious way that he could so as the person who asked the question forgets why they asked in the first place. But this time, he just seemed sad and broken, and couldn’t even bring himself to recognise that Harry had spoken. The larger part, however, just felt hollow at the knowledge that the Mirror did not show him another universe. Only the one he wished he was living in. “The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever
“Someone’s messed with this bludger!” grunted Bole. One of the Weasley twins had come over now and tried to tackle the ball. Marcus called for a time out and everyone came down to the ground.
His breath was stolen by the joyful twinkle in Harry’s eyes. “I’m glad.”
Enjoy!
What's your Patronus? I've taken the quiz at least five times and got a different answer every time, but I reckon it's snake or dragon or something - some kind of reptile that sheds its skin 🐍
“That’s what it’s called?” The elf in question was nervously darting his eyes between the two boys, who were both glaring at it with matching expressions of bafflement. It was Draco who pulled himself together first.
“I don’t know… maybe a dog print, to celebrate our recent accomplishment?” That suggestion raised a series of cheers and clinking of glasses. Truly, becoming animagi was the hardest thing the boys had ever had to do, but it was completely worth it to see the look of pure relief on Remus’s face when they stayed with him after a transformation, or to see him calmer at the prospect of a full moon. It didn’t even make much of a difference that Sirius was in love with him, he probably would have done the same thing even if he wasn’t.
Silently, the boys slipped on their shoes and started swiftly walking down the hall, hand in hand. Since they left the Chamber, no more than three words had been spoken between them, by silent agreement, but they held each other tight and close, not allowing the other to go anywhere without them, except to the toilet every now and then.
“He is, actually.” Remus joined in and the pair were almost doubled over laughing when Draco and Sirius approached them.
Briefly, Harry wondered if this was unusual. But he then brushed that thought off, thinking that it was just another thing that made him stand out, and that wasn’t what he wanted with people like Colin Creevey and Gilderoy Lockhart wandering around.
Draco sighed. “Okay. Just, keep me updated with whatever you’re doing.”
“Yeah, on my back.” he said, matter-of-factly. “I got it in fifth year because of my insane crush on that big wolf over there.” He pointed to Remus lazily.
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“We can. I would have to ask another teacher to stay over with me, it is an unusual circumstance.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You are not the Heir of Slytherin.”
“No! I swear, Draco! I think that Ginny girl has it.”
They stayed in that hug for a very long time, and Dumbledore thankfully didn’t interrupt. But it got sweaty at one point and it just wasn’t as lovable anymore, so they separated, but stayed close as they sat themselves down on a plush sofa, conjured by Moony.
“It’s like I’m paying back James, somehow. Do you know what I mean?” The man had said the night before. “Like, when I left Walburga and Orion, the Potters took me in and became my second family, so we can be that for Harry now. I know he can’t stay here at Easter or for the first half of Summer, but at least we get Christmas.”
I don't know why but I'm really proud of the next chapter, I can't wait for you guys to read it!
, Moony!”
“Biological children.” She clarified.
Draco took a deep, calming breath. “Because it isn’t real,” Harry opened his mouth to say something but he ploughed on with more emphasis. “
There was a light knock on the door and the head Minerva McGonagall popped through.
“Wait, are you worried?” he asked, smiling slightly at the idiocy.
“Yes, after your mother told him to, actually.” said Remus. “Snape used very bad words. He called your mother names. At first, James was just having a laugh but I think, after a while, he got protective. I think he was more doing it in the name of Lily’s honor, rather than for fun, or at least that was how he reasoned it. But he did eventually stop, and that is true. He died a good and honest man, and aside from that bullying, he put his friends and family first and that speaks volumes.”
“Can girls like other girls too?”
“So those gun thingys aren’t illegal in Muggle America? That’s barbaric!” James exclaimed.
Draco slumped and Remus smirked.
“BUT IT WAS HAGRID! HE OPENED THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS!”
, I thought we could trust Peter... “ He trailed off for a moment before returning with renewed vigour. “When we found out about James and Lily, we rushed straight to Godric’s Hollow and… I was so angry, I didn’t even listen to Rem when he told me to stop, I just apparated to Peter and… I reckon I would’ve killed him. But I heard Moony in my head, and I thought about you, Harry, and I just couldn’t leave you two like that, so I stopped but… Pete didn’t.”
“I’m alright, that bludger was just going after me, we think someone’s tampered with it.”
Harry was called into Professor McGonagall’s office on the last day of the holiday for some unknown reason, but he sat down in front of her desk with guilt ridden on his face. He was certain that he was in trouble, but her face said otherwise.
He was amazing. Soaring and swooping around the field as though he owned it, and he scored more goals than Harry had seen the chasers on the team do in a while, and boy did Draco know it. Harry always knew that his best friend had a bit of a dark side, it was the Slytherin in him, and he honestly quite liked it when it came out, it gave him a bit of an edge that tended to make him blush. When he dismounted his broom, Harry could just about make out a smug, crooked grin on the boy’s face as he took directly in his eyes and winked.
“I know, honey. I know.”
“What is it? What do you know?” Even Ron had abandoned his former stony silence in favour of curiosity.
“Sorry, have you done it yet?” he asked.
“Well done.” he choked out.
————————————————————————
Then, in a flash, Draco got up and furiously flipped through the pages of Transformation Magick. He didn't have a lot of time, and Alina could come in at any moment. It was lucky he had already done so much practice before his kidnapping - it meant he wouldn't need to do much before getting the hell out of the house.
"And," he added, "because he denied it so strongly, everyone naturally assumed that he was lying."
————————————————————————
——————————————————
Draco snorted. "Ha bloody ha. You're hilarious, Potter. I cannot fathom why Ginevra broke up with you."
"It was a good idea to stun him. The effects will run their course while he is unconscious. He should be back to normal by the time he recovers." And with that, Pomfrey turned back to Draco.
Biello is an old pureblood lineage. They are Italian, and they are fiercely proud of the purity of their blood, even more so than most British pureblood families. There are many old Italian wizarding families, but the Biellos deem nearly all to be contaminated to some degree and are thus extremely intermarried. Centuries of this practice have culminated in a family that is almost entirely insane - few escape their biological curse, and those that do are usually illegitimate children. Miss Biello must have kidnapped my son in one of her fits of insanity. Rest assured, they shall never step foot in Britain again.
Draco choked. "Potter and I are not fucking, Blaise!" He said, again a little too loudly. Some of the younger students looked horrified. Draco just slumped in defeat.
Harry had made a mistake. Malfoy had innocently ribbed him about not sleeping the previous night, and his mind immediately shot to the conversation he had eavesdropped on. Before he knew it, the blood was rushing to his face. He felt bad for overhearing what was clearly meant to be a private conversation. Not to mention that he had been reminded of Malfoy's inclinations.
Draco studied him for a moment, then decided to switch tactics. "Who are you?"
Malfoy smiled at him, and Harry felt blown away by the blinding force of it. He felt tingly and weird inside. He wrote off the feeling as a side effect of the few drinks he had, then set about trying to drag Malfoy to the dorm room. Fortunately, he was quite willing to go with Harry.
Draco calmly pointed out what Harry needed to fix. Unfortunately, he had to stay next to the boy until he finished the essay, because Draco had promised, and it would be more awkward if he tried to move away. But as soon as Draco approved his essay, Harry jumped up, packing his stuff.
Pansy rolled her eyes. "Is that because you want to finish the potion or because Potter is your potions partner?" Draco shot her a glare as they rushed into the Great Hall, which was almost empty.
Harry was too agitated to be surprised at Malfoy's begging. "I'm sorry, Malfoy, but I can't. I hurt you, and you didn't do a thing to warrant it. I don't deserve your forgiveness."
"So what? It's not like you don't enjoy it. You love having his attention. It's why you keep annoying him." Blaise didn't even look at Draco.
"Harry! Harry Potter! Why are you here at the Ministry? Have you come to ask for the position of Auror?"
It was a long letter, perhaps even longer than the one he had initially sent to her. Maybe that was a good thing - if Narcissa liked him, that would be one stressful step in his and Draco's relationship out of the way. Harry still wanted to go to the Manor for a couple of days over the hols like they had planned because he quite wanted to say hello properly and see Draco's childhood home without the imminent threat of death looming over his head. He was looking forward to the possibility of embarrassing stories and baby pictures, which was another reason to stay on Narcissa's good side.
Draco lowered his eyes to the letter sitting innocently by his plate, the Malfoy family seal plainly visible. With shaking hands, he opened the letter. He could only be glad it wasn't a flaming red howler. His mother was too classy for that.
"Where's Draco," Harry mouthed to Wilson, lacking the energy to speak, and not wanting to draw the woman's attention again.
When he reached the awful hut that belonged to the half-giant, he found that he was early. He shied away from the open boxes that no doubt held some of the deplorable creatures their incompetent teacher so adored. With a sort of detached interest, he began scrutinizing the pumpkin patch. This year, it seemed, they would have some impressively large pumpkins for the Halloween feast.
What if he allowed the muggles to see him? Inevitably they would cause a big fuss, maybe even big enough that the Ministry would hear about it. They would, eventually. All he had to do was stay put, and the wizards would come to him. Draco would be in massive trouble for jeopardizing their kind, but what choice did he have? It was this or wander aimlessly for who knows how much longer.
Parkinson groaned. "Since when did Slytherin become infested by Gryffindors?"
"I feel strange. I'm going for a walk, see you guys in Herbology." He told Hermione and Ron. Hermione gave him a worried look.
Thank you for saving me.
Well, that was entirely unacceptable. Draco straightened out his spine, lifting his head. He threw himself back into his attempts with renewed vigor, his energy and determination restored. With each go, he managed to get further and further off of the ground, and his progress created a feedback loop, encouraging him and raising his spirits exponentially. Consequently, he had mastered the art of hovering a meter above the ground. Tentatively, he tried leaning forward. He had heard that running was a kind of controlled falling, and he supposed that flying forward would be much the same. As long he counteracted the falling by flapping his wings more, much as one used their feet to propel themself upward and forward, he would theoretically be able to fly rather than just hover.
"Er, quite," Theo replied. "We'll be out of your hair then." He dragged Goldstein past them into the hall and shut the door behind them.
Draco blushed at the compliment but groaned. "I can't deal with this now, or quite frankly, ever. Why, Merlin, why did I have to be attracted to someone so incredibly stupid?" Harry laughed at that.
"So," Hermione said, "I'm assuming you're having trouble not doing anything while Draco is missing?"
"So, Draco," Harry said, "do you think our friends are wondering where we are?" Draco smirked at his sudden change in subject. "I don't know, Harry, but don't think I've forgotten about this."
Now, with minimal practice, he would attempt the final shift into his dragon form. If anything went wrong, no one would come to the rescue, especially since Draco was currently unregistered.
Narcissa Malfoy
Harry didn't know what to say to that, but Draco helpfully shoved the piece of toast in his face, so he took the chance to avoid replying and bit into it.
He was rock hard, and the water hadn't helped to calm his raging erection. Harry rubbed the soap between his hands, making sure to get them as lathered up as possible. Then, he set the bar down and finally took himself into his hand. He groaned at the sudden stimulation. After a moment, he began to slide his hand up and down, his other forearm resting on the wall to support himself. His movements got faster and faster, and he felt pressure start to build up inside him. Harry closed his eyes and was accosted by a series of images. Malfoy laughing and smiling, Malfoy underneath him, Malfoy touching his cheek, looking just like he had in Harry's dream before-
"I-" Draco was speechless. This perfect, perfect man loved him, and that was almost inconceivable. So, he didn't think. He kissed Harry, letting the action say more than he had the ability to.
——————————————————
Draco pushed open the heavy doors.
Harry walked into the common room. Thankfully, Draco wasn't there. He nodded to Ron and Hermione and continued to his dorm.  He pushed open the door, only to see Malfoy pulling his robes over his head. He was wearing pants underneath, but they honestly didn't cover much except what was absolutely necessary. And of course, his torso was bare.
"There's no need to knock when I'm sleeping here, Potter," he drawled. "Or did you forget that even the Golden Boy doesn't get a room all to himself?"
Blaise watched this interaction with amusement. "Maybe you have a chance, after all, Draco. Or at the very least, every rumor will be about how you and Potter are very obviously fucking."
Harry approached the professor without fanfare, trying to stay discreet. He quietly explained his theory to her, supplying the necessary details to convince her that it made sense.
"Animagus?" Harry asked. Draco nodded sharply. "Why? I mean, you could do this after school, why waste your nights on this now-?"
"Explain," Parkinson demanded.
"Harry," he whispered, reminding Harry an awful lot of what he had dreamt of only a few nights prior. Harry flushed immediately, eyes dropping to look at Malfoy's lips. He wondered what it would be like to kiss him for real. He wrenched his eyes away, and they locked back onto Malfoy's gaze at once. His pupils were dilated, and Harry realized that his breathing had also become quite fast. Malfoy's hand was still caressing his cheek.
Blaise flicked his forehead. "Stop daydreaming about Potter, Draco. You have a ridiculously soppy smile on your face, and it's embarrassing me." Draco scowled at his supposed friend but made sure his face was carefully blank. Pansy leaned forward, resting her head on her hand. Her perfectly manicured fingers drummed against the table annoyingly.
Together, they pushed their way through the doors of the Great Hall.
"I'm quite proud, to be honest. And it's Potter-Malfoy, not Potter. I'd never have finished that book without my husband's help and occasional coercion." There. The press loved it when he talked about their question and Draco in the same statement.
Ginny gave him a serious look. "Did you and this guy do anything?" She asked. Harry nodded. "We, er, we...we kissed." He finally admitted. Understanding flitted across her face.
Draco was mildly horrified. Any creature that had to be held down to be fed was not okay in his books. He turned to Pansy, but she was already with Bulstrode. Blaise had gone and partnered with Longbottom. He glared at his supposed friends. As surveyed his peers, he noted that Granger and the Weasel were standing together, giving Potter apologetic looks. As he stood looking around, more and more of his classmates partnered up, leaving him and-
Harry ran his fingers through his hair anxiously. Almost absentmindedly, he waved his hand, and the piles of letters on the table disappeared, hopefully never to be found again. Evil people, the lot of them. Who gave them the right to pass judgment upon their relationship, much less scold them for it?
————————————————————————
"Well, I think this only confirms your bisexuality," Hermione said, smiling. Harry opened his mouth. "But I ran away. Knowing his...thing was right there made me feel weird." Hermione shook her head. "As you said, you simply weren't ready. You thought you were straight for most of your life, so it's no surprise this feels weird to you. Honestly, I think you were just caught off guard. Girls don't have penises, so you've never had to deal with that before. Give it time. The more you do things with guys, the less awkward it will become. It should start to feel as natural as being with a girl."
"Cowards," Draco thought.
A harsh figure stood in front of a large window, carving a severe silhouette from the weak light streaming in. Though his back was turned, Draco saw his father in the unnatural stiffness of his posture, the hands clasped behind his back, and the familiar white-blond hair. He knew, even before the king turned around, that this man was somehow, impossibly, Lucius Malfoy, even with the unfamiliar, yet somehow strangely fitting, crown upon his head.
"You touched it? Why would you want to touch it? It's vile, horrid, and a reminder of everything that went wrong in my life." Draco said, bringing his arm up to his face so he could look at the mark with unadulterated disgust.
Evidently not. And yet, Harry found himself wanting to smile at Malfoy's insult, almost like it was a joke between them.
Afterward, he made his way to Care of Magical Creatures, taught by that oaf, Hagrid. The air was still warm with the fading summer light. Draco despised winter. It was far too cold, and the snow only made him look paler. At least autumn was bearable.
——————————————————
Harry opened the door for them, clutching Malfoy's wrist so he wouldn't wander off. He dragged the drunk boy over to his bed (Malfoy's that is) and let go, giving Malfoy a little shove.
"But he keeps staring at me. It's making me feel uncomfortable like I have a massive zit on my face."
"It was a trap," Draco told him later. "Mother wants to retain the ability to corner you whenever she wants. Obviously we can't allow that."
"Draco," Harry said, very throaty and rough. The sound shot straight to Draco's crotch, and he had to hold back a groan. Harry leaned closer again, but this time his mouth found a new target. When he felt the heat of Harry's tongue searing his neck, Draco really did moan. Encouraged by the noise, Harry continued his assault rather vigorously.
Draco looked like he was having an information overload. Harry, on the other hand, was finding that telling the blond all these secrets festering inside him was quite cathartic.
When she pulled back, Harry gave her a weak smile. "I'll be okay, Hermione. Really, I've been through worse." That didn't seem to appease her at all.
"I am not infatuated with Potter!" He said a little too loudly. Some of the Slytherins down the table stared at him, then began whispering furiously to each other. Draco groaned. Everyone else smirked. Almost on instinct, Draco looked over to the Gryffindor table, almost instantly locking eyes with a certain black-haired boy. Potter just blushed and looked away again, which was enough to make Draco regain his smirk.
Harry nodded. It was a good idea, and maybe Narcissa would know something about this Biello woman.
Weasley's Wizard Wheezes!
I heard from Miss Parkinson that you have befriended Harry Potter. I am pleased. We owe much to him and his kindness. Treat him well, for it is the least he deserves. When you see him next, please relay my gratitude, and the additional note I have enclosed. Yes, Draco, you may read it if you must, though I'd rather prefer you didn't, at least not until he has had a chance to see it.
Harry should've known it wouldn't last. Everything had been going wonderfully, and since when did anything go that well for him for long? Everyone had been astonishingly accepting of his relationship with Draco, far more than they had dared to hope. Not a single person made a nasty comment, no one hexed Draco, and no student nor teacher told Harry he was making a mistake.
"You fought? And now you're friends?" She looked skeptical. Draco sighed.
He, his father, and his mother would all be tried in a row. They couldn't be tried at the same time, for they were being accused of different crimes, but the Wizengamot had evidently decided they wanted to be done with all the Malfoys in one go. His father would go first, then his mother, and finally him. He didn't know what to make of that.
"Wait, Draco. I'm sorry for snapping. It was uncalled for." Harry's voice called after him. Draco stopped but didn't turn around. He heard rustling noises behind him, and then Harry was tugging his arm so Draco would face him. Harry looked very apologetic.
"Paul! I'm so glad you came! Look, here it's curled up in that corner. You won't have to hurt it, will you? It looks so helpless, and so small too! What if it's only a baby, separated from its mother?" The woman, a mother herself, was filled with concern at this possibility.
Magpies are said to predict the future; the number in which they appear is the variable that decides whether that fortune will be good or bad. One magpie is said to be a bad omen, while in any other number they are usually good.
Draco gave her a look. She innocently batted her eyes at him. "You'll have to wait and see, dear. I bet you won't stop staring at him for the entire feast."
Ron straightened up, still chuckling. "Mate, you've nearly died so many times that the novelty of it has worn off. Besides, it rather sounded like you were enjoying that dream." Ron was far too amused about this for his own good. In fact, if he kept it up, Harry just might strangle him.
"Oh look, Harry grew so much! He looks so hot.."
"Only the Golden Boy of Gryffindor would say such things," Draco accused him, eyes sparkling with mischief. Harry's heart skipped a beat, but he ignored it for all he was worth. "Takes one to know one," he retorted sweetly.
Seamus was the first to say anything about it. "Harry, why d'you keep looking at Malfoy? And he's smiling. I don't reckon I've ever seen him smile before. You sure those rumors aren't actually true?" Seamus grinned at him. "Of course not, Seamus. We're only friends, and that's it." Harry assured him.
He was still semi-hard; the long walk had caused his erection to wilt a bit. But however much he willed it away, the memories of making out with Harry kept on surfacing, and he would get hard all over again. There was nothing else for it. He would have to wank if he wanted to sleep.
Draco couldn't believe his luck. Somehow they had become friends even after their fight. It was a dream come true. Literally, because Draco had wanted to be Harry's friend since the first time he had heard his name. Little Draco had wanted to meet the child capable of defeating the Dark Lord, even though his father insisted Harry Potter was nothing special. He was elated by the knowledge that they would spend their time at Hogwarts together. And then he had been so nervous about meeting the boy that he had unwittingly insulted Harry's only friend and ruined his chance. Draco had sulked for weeks after, much to Pansy's annoyance.
Draco gave him a very skeptical look, and then his face morphed into one of contemplation. Then, it changed to a very, very smug expression.
Draco was elated. Harry kept glancing over at him and smiling, and each and every time his eyes would light up with the mischief of a shared secret and-
"Would you please tell me what's bothering you?" He pleaded quietly. That green gaze flashed towards him before moving away again.
Alina didn't seem to notice. "I apologize for my cavalier methods, but I simply had to rescue you! It must have been terrible, being trapped at that awful school for another year. And they were spreading all those rumors about you and that Potter boy, we should sue them for slander!" She rambled on about how unfortunate his situation had been, and wasn't he glad she had saved him?
Four years later
He pushed open the door to find Potter, walking around with a towel around his waist. Shirtless.
Draco groaned. His head was throbbing, an immediate and intense reprimand for his poor choices. When he opened his eyes, the blinding rays of the sun seared through his brain, making everything so much worse. He sat there for at least fifteen minutes, allowing his eyes to adjust to the bright afternoon light, then struggling to get to his feet, his body swaying precariously.
Zabini just chuckled, saying something that sounded suspiciously like, "You would like that, wouldn't you?" But thankfully, he also moved away. Still, it wasn't enough, because Malfoy's arm continued to press against his. And the electric shocks were still dancing all along his arm. He ended up sitting like that for nearly half an hour, the tingling getting stronger every second. He was about to jump up and make a run for it when Hermione finally made some excuse about needing to get back to do homework and mercifully allowed Harry to escape. He almost did jump out of his seat, pointedly not looking at Malfoy, and walked quickly out of the pub. They made their way up to the castle.
The mirror he had given Draco was lying on the ground half underneath the bed, miraculously not at all cracked. Harry knew Draco would never have taken it off without reason. Could it be that it had fallen off when he had changed into his dragon form?
"Teachers can't take points from us, Harry," was Hermione's immediate reply. "Since we no longer belong to a house, there's no way to take points from us."
"I'm fine! I didn't think you'd be so concerned for my health, Malfoy." The other boy snapped back. "I didn't realize the bloody thing was so strong. I'll be more prepared this time." Potter wrestled the creature down again. Draco mumbled about not being concerned about Potter's health, but the other boy ignored him. He also wanted to know what had made Potter blush, but he wanted to be done with the exercise more. So, he slowly brought the flobberworm closer to the ugly animal. It jerked again, but Potter, true to his word, held it in place. As the worm neared the Horgwallow's mouth, the opening suddenly enlarged until Draco could easily drop the flobberworm in. The creature appeared to swallow it whole. They repeated the process a few more times, then deemed themselves finished.
As was becoming his nightly ritual, Harry slipped out of the curtains. As he passed the boundary of the permanent silencing spell he had around his bed, the sounds of his roommates' breathing and snoring suddenly became audible. As always, Harry glanced at Draco's bed with the drawn curtains before retrieving his map and cloak. He had used them so often recently that he didn't even have to rummage around in his trunk.
"Now you may go get the Werewolf hairs, peasant," Draco said in a superior tone, referencing their conversation from last week. Potter looked confused.
Draco reached up to cup his cheeks, holding his head still. "Stop fidgeting," he chided gently. "It makes it harder to ogle your beautiful face."
"Of course," replied Parkinson, unconvinced. "I have no doubts about the veracity of that."
Draco gulped. She was mad that much was obvious.
"I'm going." He announced to Ron. Ron collapsed backward onto the bed he was sitting on so that he was now lying down. "Finally." He groaned. Then he sat up again. "Do you want me to come with you? Or Hermione? Or both of us? We would come, you know. We hate that pointy git, both of us, but we would do it for you." Ron rushed out anxiously.
————————————————————————
"Do you think I have a chance with him?" He asked, sounding vulnerable. Pansy hesitated, knowing her answer could do a lot of damage if she wasn't careful. Either he would feel unworthy, or he would get his hopes up, only to have them possible crushed. Pansy had to be careful to make sure neither happened.
"Shhhh," Draco hissed. "Do you want to hear the story or not?" Without waiting for confirmation, because he already knew she did, he went on. "And then Harry takes off his invisibility cloak. He found out what I was doing, and we argued about it a bit, and then we argued about other things, and, well, at some point, we started...flirting...I guess, and then he kissed me! And not just once, but a lot! And then we flirted some more and came back up to the castle," Draco finished.
Harry leaned back and watched him, a small smile on his lips.
Malfoy snickered. "Come here, Potter. This is far too much for one person to eat, and your stomach might eat itself if you have to wait any longer." Harry shook his head, but after more insisting on Malfoy's part and another embarrassingly loud rumble from his stomach, he gave in. He pulled a chair up to Malfoy's bed and sat next to him, stealing the untouched beef stew. He was right, the pasta, stew, and fried chicken all together was far too much for any one person to eat.
"You what?" Draco prodded.
The corners of McGonagall's lips nearly lifted into a smile. "Perhaps, Mr. Malfoy, but something tells me you already have a project in mind. Heaven knows there would be no way for me to stop you, so the only way I can make sure you don't get yourself killed is to offer my help. If it's focus you're after, I insist you retrieve this book from the library." She scribbled something on a sheet of parchment and handed it to Draco. "And please, Mr. Malfoy, if I could ask a favor from you?" Draco nodded obligingly for her to continue. "You may use any of the old classrooms on the fourth floor for your project. But no more sneaking out at night, you'll fall sick or get killed by one of those horrific creatures in the forest."
"Distract me, more likely," Draco muttered, and Harry smirked before giving him a heated kiss that set his entire body on fire, only proving his point. Draco groaned into Harry's mouth, then found himself bereft as a laughing Harry disappeared into thin air. "Nothing wrong with a bit of snogging, Draco," came the smooth voice from somewhere to his left.
But nonetheless, prison was where he would go. Because he deserved it.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking up to dinner when they bumped into someone else walking the other way. Harry pulled back, mouth open to apologize. Then, he recognized the familiar gray eyes and angled face, muttered a quick, "sorry," and hurried past. But it seemed like he wasn't about to get away that easily.
"Potter," he said, inclining his head. "If you wouldn't mind terribly, could you do me a favor?" Harry was so startled by the fact that a Slytherin was asking him for a favor that he nodded without thinking. Zabini looked relieved.
He cast a quick Tempus and discovered that he had been outside for nearly an hour and a half. He scanned the book for how to rid himself of the talon. Squeezing his eyes shut, he visualized the change in reverse and sighed in relief at his now human finger. Then, he quickly closed the book, stashing it in the tree once more. He hurried back up to the castle, moving with haste so he wouldn't accidentally run into Harry again. Though with that blasted map, if Harry was awake, he would have already seen him.
After he had regained the ability to walk - tricky thing, really - he made his way inside, feeling vaguely nauseous. As Draco passed through his bedroom, something felt off, as if someone had moved his furniture ever so slightly out of place. The impending sensation that he was about to vomit prevented him from investigating further, however, and he lurched into the bathroom just in time.
Harry turned to the page in his potions book. He looked over the ingredients list. Most of it was generic potions ingredients, but some things - toenails of an ogre, werewolf's hair, and pickled newt's tails - were a bit stranger. Harry got up to go to the ingredients cupboard, but a hand snaked around his wrist and tugged him back down.
Harry couldn't stand the silence any longer, but he didn't want to bring up a date quite yet. He settled on asking: "So what was it exactly that I did? Or, rather, didn't do." He glanced sideways to see a ghost of a smile flicker across Draco's face.
"A few things, and I don't think he suspects anything either." She sat on top of one of the desks. "I told him I just wanted to know so I would have something to gossip about. He seemed to believe it." At Draco's impatient look, she got on with her story. "Anyways, I asked him if he was dating any girls, then I not so subtly hinted that I thought he might prefer boys. He only said that wasn't dating anyone. He didn't even deny an attraction to boys, which I think is very telling. If he was fully straight, I'm sure that would have been the first thing he focused on." Draco suddenly felt hopeful.
A hand poked him. He swatted at it blindly.
"Argh!" Draco yelped as he felt the block of ice wrap around his unfortunate appendage. He leveled a positively menacing glare at Harry, but the latter did not care one bit. Grumbling, Draco allowed Harry's hand to remain in his pocket and even held it tight so it would warm up faster. In such a manner, they awkwardly walked and occasionally stumbled through the village. They didn't have any destination in mind, but their teenage stomachs were leading them vaguely in the direction of Honeydukes.
I sincerely apologize for not writing sooner. I know you will not like to hear it, but a great many things have come up. Still, I should not have waited so long to write to you.
Harry blushed, and Ron, overhearing the comment, laughed loudly. "You should've heard him a couple of weeks ago, Malfoy," he snickered. "He was giving us a detailed description of what you eat and how it changes spending on your mood. Harry insisted it wasn't weird at all. It was quite funny. Definitely strange at the time, but it makes a lot more sense now. Obviously, he fancied you all those years," Ron noted wisely, punctuating it with a confident nod.
"You look wonderful, dearie." His mirror assured him.
"I see no problem with that," Draco echoed, and both Harry and Hermione snickered.
Unfortunately, the teacher who was running the club, was none other that Gilderoy Pompous Arse Lockhart. Harry groaned but Draco elbowed him, gesturing towards the man, who was now addressing them with a condescending air that was so intolerable it made Harry want to rush up to Dumbledore’s office and demand to know all the secrets of the universe, knowing that all he would get was that irritating twinkle the old man got in his eyes whenever he knew something that Harry did not.
When he first met Harry, he could see that same glint. All he wanted was to make him forget all of the sadness he had been through, but some things are just impossible. He was working on understanding that better.
When the moment finally came around though, despite Harry’s previously casual attitude towards the whole thing, there was a strange animosity towards the two boys as they each took their turn. Draco did amazingly, he caught the snitch within half an hour, beating the rest of the competition, leaving only Harry to take his turn. It was stupid, really, it wasn’t like he had anything to prove, Draco had more practise, so would probably be the more suitable candidate. But for some reason, Harry felt desperate to win.
“That one’s
“I’m so sorry, dad. I just didn’t feel hungry. I would rather be doing so many other things.” Draco was speaking in a tight, strained voice and was hiding ducking his head into his chest, a coping mechanism that he developed before he was adopted because it made him feel safer not to let his emotions show. Remus reached out and grasped his shoulder.
“Draco? Draco, are you okay? You’re awake now, you're fine, you’re okay.” Sirius soothed him.
last chapter!!! hope you guys enjoyed it <3
Harry could sense a question about the Dursleys coming and tensed. “Yeah.”
“Scared, Potter?” He said. Harry at first though he was joking, but his reply sounded deadly coming from his lips.
Draco could see that his dads were having one of those silent conversations they had whenever they had something private to discuss.
“Where will I go then?”
Sirius spoke up in a broken voice. “But- how…?”
“Down you go!” he said, brightly, to his Professor’s shock.
But his thoughts were tossed aside when he and Draco found themselves in a boat, rowing towards the awe inspiring sight of the castle. Harry felt more at home than he had in years.
“I didn’t like what you were insinuating.”
“DON’T START WITH ME, I WAS CURIOUS!”
Draco was wholly against this idea. It seemed ridiculous to him that they should just be throwing themselves down a mysterious hole simply for the reason that one of their teachers might want to steal something from it. Nevertheless, he was still going to do it because, realistically, he would probably follow Harry to the ends of the Earth if only to keep him from falling off. And so, Draco found himself on the third floor of Hogwarts, with his three musketeers, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Harry bloody Potter, listening to the soft sounds of a harp playing from behind a closed door that signalled to them that somebody had gotten there before them. Harry expressed his frustration in small hisses to Ron that sounded suspiciously like
Draco stopped and stared at Harry as though he were looking at a different person. “Who told you about that?”
“Yes.”
“Why? My boy, don’t you know?” After what he had seen in the Mirror last year, Draco was sure that he didn’t want to know, and that the incidents were related.
“I love you too.” He breathed and shook his head, pushing the movement aside. He raced down the Slytherin table, sat himself down, and began helping himself to a large serving of the marshmallow cereal they were serving.
“Why was my name in the newspaper?” He wailed, not bothering to control his emotions any longer.
“Pads, need I remind you that I am probably just as dangerous as that dog?” Pads paused at that, and gave Remus a contemplative look, and then sighed.
“Both your son, and Harry, have been sorted into Slytherin House.” Sirius gasped but Remus felt only confused. Of course, it made little difference to him that it was Slytherin House in particular, although it would to his husband, what really bothered him was that Draco and Harry would be living in the same room for the next seven years. He couldn’t begin to comprehend the effects this would have. “You can clearly see the difficulty. But, I think this may be a good thing. We can observe. And they will be under my watchful eye, so I promise, I will report anything that happens.”
“It isn’t ideal but, we were thinking, Dementors.”
“Yeah. Most of it, anyway.” Remus didn’t correct Harry, confirming that the scar on his forehead was proof that not everything in the Wizarding World was amazing. “If you don’t mind my asking, Harry, where have you grown up?” Harry shuffled nervously, clearly uncomfortable talking about it.
They all had concerned expressions on their faces as Sirius continued to rub circles on his back and shoulder. He didn’t understand why they weren’t angry. Or at least scared. But they all seemed to only care about him in a kind way, which was confusing and overwhelming but also comforting and he didn’t know what to feel.
Finally, the day came when Draco and Harry were set to meet their friends at Hogsmeade station and leave their Remus and Sirius at the cottage in the village.
“I love you two.”
“Oh, please don’t.”
Remus’s head perked up. “I’m sorry, sir, but that’s ridiculous!”
“Sorry?” Remus asked incredulously. “Why are you sorry? I’ve tricked you guys, you’ve been living with a monster for two years, you should be furious!” He was gasping for air now, his lungs twinging slightly at the lack of air being transferred into them. In his peripheral vision, Remus could see Sirius pouring a glass of water and passing it to him, which he gratefully accepted and then chugged down. He felt physically better, but his mind still felt like someone was blasting sixty different songs at full volume and was shouting along to the lyrics.
“Excuse me?”
“I get it, you’re angry because my dad used to be kind of a prick, but he’s grown out of that. You are still the same stuck-up, slimy, evil little bully that you used to be, and that is never going to change.”
“Who’s Wormtail?”
They came rushing in immediately and looked over the mouse.
“I don’t know, I think he’s kind of mad at me.”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible.” said Dumbledore with an air of mystery that Harry couldn’t stand. “Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” Harry shook his head. “Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised as a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
“Open it! Open it!” Harry first read the label with a bemused smile.
“Guarding something… Like that thing Hagrid got out of Gringotts. Whatever that was is obviously more important than just some trinket for Dumbledore’s office!”
Still, Harry also tried to feel proud of himself. Draco had told him countless times that he never allowed himself to be. Flint had been stunned at his flying, blown away by how good he was, especially seeing as he had had very little previous experience. That statement had made Harry glow just a little. Growing up, Harry had never been the best at anything. Dudley had received all the praise. And, once he got to Hogwarts, everyone loved him, but only for a thing he did when he was a baby that he couldn’t even explain. It felt good for people to be recognising him for being good at a thing he put effort into. And he had put effort into flying.
Snape’s lip curled dangerously. “I will not be giving this back to Mr Potter, I don’t trust it.”
“Harry, what is this?”
“Can I ask you a question, Draco?” The boy nodded his head. “Is your name still Malfoy?”
“Do you regret it?”
They lifted off and the balls were released, but one bludger came flying directly at Harry’s head. He swiftly dodged it and Bole smacked it over towards Alicia Spinnet, but it flew back to Harry again. By now, Derrick had joined them and whacked the ball over towards Wood, but it still boomeranged back to Harry.
Draco watched as Harry paled and knitted their hands together in support. His friend gave him a small smile and squeezed. It felt comforting and good.
Remus breathed shakily, lip quirking slightly. “I do.”
“Did you see that too, when you looked in?” Harry shook his head.
“So, wait, that Colin kid’s been Petrified?” Draco was sat attentively listening to Harry recounting his eventful night.
A lot of what Dumby says in this chapter is taken directly from the book, it all belongs to JK (even though I think she was very mean on Twitter and all that).
The ass-mouth started to be filled with small crumbs of bread, and seemed wholly engrossed in the activity, because it didn’t notice when Draco took a deep breath and sent a small snow flurry over to it, cold enough to make it shiver and slow to a near stop. It could barely move when he finally whipped out his wand and stunned it.
” Ink began to fan out across the page, and Harry basked in the new power he felt and scanned the page for Draco’s dot, finding him sitting in the Slytherin common room. Harry guessed that he was reading.
“Look, it’s okay. But please, please just talk to us about it. You know how much your dad and I love you!” He was crying, himself now. They sat in silence apart from the occasional sniffle and Draco allowed himself to be held in a crushing hug as they both settled down. “You know I’m happy, right? The transformation doesn’t stop me from being happy! Your father comes with me when you’re away, he turns into a dog, it’s actually quite fun.” They both let out a wet chuckle at the image of Sirius yapping away. “And you know, I’m registered now.” Draco looked up and peered into his father’s face.
“One step at a time.”
“Umm… princesses, dragons, knights.” He bit his lip. “I know you like to read so I thought you might want to try some Muggle Literature. I’ve never actually read any of them but everyone in the Muggle world knows the big stories.”
“Alright, bye Draco, DON’T SCARE US LIKE THAT AGAIN!”  With that final sentiment, the paper exploded in a small
“I - I didn’t see you, sir.”
He sat silently beside his friend’s hospital bed, with Hermione, Ron, and the entire Slytherin team. It was quite unifying, actually, and not even that awkward. Sure, they had lost the match to Ravenclaw, but Draco had gotten enough points through scoring that it wasn’t that big of a loss. They would pull through. And there was talk of a rematch because of the clear foul the dementors had played.
For Parvati, it was a mummy, for Seamus, a banshee, for Dean, a severed hand. Draco tried to rack his brains for what he could be scared of most - Lucius, he reasoned. Or Voldemort. He didn't have time, however, to think about it, because the boggart had turned its attention to him, and it was worse than he could have imagined.
One too many glasses of Remus’s eggnog led to the man screaming the lyrics to ‘Feed the World’ by the end of the day. Sirius ended up dragging his husband into singing an improvised version of ‘Baby It’s Cold Outside’ while Draco and Harry cheered and whooped from the side.
The boy clenched his fists and took a deep breath. “They transform into a wolf.”
Fred pulled something from the inside of his cloak with a flourish and held it out for Harry to take. It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and George’s practical jokes, did not take it.
“-and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked ‘Confiscated and Highly Dangerous.’
“Oh, do shut up. You just said that whoever is down there probably knew how to get past Fluffy, so why are you surprised? If you want to go through with this stupid plan, I suggest you listen to reason and realise that we can’t play Fluffy any music, so this is a blessing in disguise.” Suddenly, the harp stopped. “Crap. Now what are we going to do?” Harry’s eyes lit up.
At the time, it all seemed to occur in slow motion, like they were watching a modified memory of the event, rather than the real thing.
Bode pulled up next to him. “Do you want us to call a time out again?”
“Harry, what if we find the troll? What do we do then?”
“It’s fine, Harry. I’ll just watch. And what are you going to be, Weasley?” Clambering up onto the horses back, the Weasel (as was the recent creative nickname for him in the Slytherin common room) huffed.
“No, I don’t.” Draco’s face could freeze oceans, it was scary.
“Draco, why would he lie?”
“A doe…” Remus whispered.
Harry didn’t have time to reply so followed her, keeping at a bit of a jog in order to keep up.
I tend to only post on a Sunday but I had a surge of inspiration to write this chapter (the idea for which has been bouncing around my brain for some time now)
“Just the Daily Prophet, that’s the main wizard newspaper.” Draco opened up the paper only to find his own name glaring back at him at the headline underneath the article about a break-in at Gringotts. Ignoring the shocking news, Draco circled in on his own name and read the headline, blood going cold.
“What?” said Draco with an irritated expression. It irritated Harry sometimes that he didn’t know what he and Draco were. They had kissed before, rather, Draco had kissed him. But they never talked about it. He was perfectly happy with that at the time, but now he was filled with a strange possessiveness over the boy, as though he were his and his only. Still, he didn’t to tell Draco, out of fear that he wouldn’t feel the same.
“What do you need, Dumby?” Dumbledore took a deep breath before he was interrupted by Minerva, clearly irritated at her colleague’s lack of tact.
“Yes, he did.”
Remus thought.
“Honestly, Moony, I don’t understand why we don’t just send Draco to Durmstrang or Beauxbatons. He would look lovely in blue.” he said over the top of his son’s most recent letter, describing a bludger attack on Harry and a petrified child.
“Sir, what is a lycanthrope?”
“Of course it's okay, you’re my best friend! We can tell each other anything!”
“I’m sorry was I the only one who saw the three-headed dog?”
but Draco interrupted them.
“Why, thank you, kind sir.” giggled Draco as he prepared for his descent. “Wish me luck!” With that, he was gone, leaving Harry with a Lockhart who seemed to be calculating his next move.
“Harry, I think this is the worst idea you’ve ever had.” said Draco, as he nervously seated himself on the bike.
“But won’t your dads be angry that we snuck out?”
“You excited?” he squealed, grinning like a loon.
Draco glared down at him. “Well, you know Death Eaters better than I do. Enlighten me.”
“The Grim! I got it in class, and Trelawny made a big deal out of it, because she said it meant I was going to die, but now you’ve got it too!” Draco couldn’t tell if Harry looked worried, because it would be ridiculous to be worried about a stupid fortune, Tea Leaves shouldn’t control anyone’s lives, much less his, but there did seem to be a certain tension around his jaw that suggested certain stress.
Remus and Sirius soon made their way into the room and asked Harry what they talked about. He relayed the entire conversation and gauged their reactions which varied from thunderous to terrified. Probably of Dumbledore’s lack of security in this school. The Lupin-Blacks reassured him that he would be spending the last three weeks of the Summer holiday with them as they still needed to work out the legalities, which Harry didn’t understand, and they left him to drift back to sleep.
Sirius sighed dramatically. “If I must!” he proclaimed, but Harry held onto his suitcase with a wary look. “It’s okay, mate, I won’t steal it.”
It all grew to be too much and Draco buried his head in Remus' neck and allowed the hot tears to fall for just a moment.
At the Welcome Feast, Dumbledore announced the Triwizard Tournament and Harry and Draco pretended to be surprised.
When he told Draco about the Mirror’s real use, the boy’s eyes filled with angry tears.
“Come on, Pads, you can say goodbye at the station.”
“She won’t wake.”
“Do you mean that, Dad? Because you sometimes sugar coat things!”
“Dumbledore! Minnie! What a surprise, come in, come in!” Sirius ushered the pair inside and led them to the kitchen where Remus offered them tea and took the baby off of Dumbledore’s hands.
The silence in the room was deafening. The orb seemed to emit silence like a force field. Around the boys stood Sirius and Remus, their headmaster, Professors Snape, McGonagall and Trelawney, who each looked as white as a sheet.
A mutual shudder ran through the room like an icy blade. Draco laced his fingers through Harry’s under the table.
“Yep. It’s great.”
In his mind’s eye, Harry could see Draco’s glowing face as he unwrapped the first present in the stocking, and Remus and Sirius’ grins as he giggled at the silly toy. It was the first Christmas he remembered as feeling a part of a family.
“I dragged you into this, I’ll go on.” Draco didn’t like that idea. Not one bit. But Harry needed to do this, he’d been on about it all year. Maybe this had a lot more baggage than he was letting on, maybe it didn’t. All Draco knew was that Harry was strong enough to withstand anything.
“This means that security will probably be heightened when we start. I’ll be having a meeting with Professor Dumbledore later today to discuss it.” There was a slight tremble behind her words that she hid well, but Harry had had a lot of practice holding back tears, and could hear when someone was doing it. It seemed a little inappropriate for him to give her a hug but he tried to put on his most reassuring smile.
“Draco!” Harry breathed. “I’ve missed you so much!” They stayed together until he moved on to Remus who returned the hug wholeheartedly. Draco watched as his parents gave each other a look that signified a silent question being asked and then answered.
“I is here for Harry Potter, sir.” Finally, Sirius put Dobby down on the desk chair and sunk down to his level, Remus was still in the doorway, politely bewildered, and Harry just looked scared, so Draco put his arm around him. “Dobby is here to tell you all that Harry Potter should not be going to Hogwarts this year, sir.”
Draco didn’t have anything to say to that, so he didn’t. For a while. After a lot of thinking in contemplative silence, he could finally come up with something to say.
Remus released the boggart after rehashing the spell and it was, as suspected, a dementor. At first, he just used the ‘Riddikulus’ spell, just to know how to do it, but they moved onto the Patronus charm directly afterwards.
Draco smiled. “It feels like it.”
It ended up being that Harry would be sleeping on the floor in Draco’s room, even though they had a spare. Both boys decided that it would be endless amounts of fun to wake up together on Christmas morning, so it all worked out, despite protestations from Moony. So, on Christmas Eve, Harry and Draco hid themselves underneath the blanket of Draco’s bed with a flashlight.
Harry wasted no time checking the headline, which was, as expected, about the breakout. He had never seen Lucius Malfoy before and was stunned by the resemblance he had to his son. No, he wasn’t beautiful like Draco, but you could see that beauty maybe once resided in his features, but that Voldemort ripped it from him. His face was contorted into a grim snarl as he glared daggers at the camera, Draco had never made that face. Harry didn’t think that Draco was capable.
His dad chuckled and looked at him with fond exasperation. “What are you thinking about?”
“Hey, I want to play too!” Ron gave him a look of poison but Harry jumped in.
He and Draco kept a tight hold on each other’s hands throughout the meeting, until their names were mentioned.
“The Dementors will be under strict orders to bring him to us. The Wizengamot will decide his fate from there.” Fudge replied instead.
“What’s that supposed to be?”
As per the other tradition Draco had for the holiday season, he and Harry spent the final moments of the evening in their room, exchanging presents.
Hooch seemed to be paying little attention to them, but lazily said. “Don’t fight.” As if it that was going to help. “Welp, Potter. I think it’s best if I go and get another bludger from the store room. Weasley, try and get that thing back in it’s box.” She exited with billowing robes and left the teams standing dumbly in the centre of the field.
Sirius didn’t know what kind of home Harry had lived in only a term before, but he’d be damned if he let Harry go back.
“What’s going on here?”
Draco couldn’t help it when a laugh escaped his lips at the incredulity of his situation. “Yeah, I think there are!” Harry’s taste for adventure was never something that he understood, but being up in the sky, blatantly breaking the rules, tempting death itself, was the most liberated he had felt in years. Maybe ever. He allowed the wind to whip in his face as he grinned. “This is incredible.”
“Mr Malfoy,” she began, sitting herself down in a tartan armchair. “What on Earth was that?”
“It would be convenient. And Draco can come and visit whenever there’s a Hogsmeade weekend!”
“Yes, me.” Remus snapped his mouth shut immediately after speaking, eyes wide. “Not me! Not me, specifically. But I have some friends, maybe someone in the Order?” He was stuttering adorably and the corners of Sirius’s mouth seemed to quirk upwards of their own accord.
“Or else anyone can read it.” Fred said warningly.
Harry matched his volume. “I WAS LOOKING AT A MEMORY! TOM RIDDLE SHOWED ME!”
“What do we look for?”
Draco felt numb. Lycanthrope? What did that even mean? He continued reading the article, urgent for some explanation.
“He does seem a little cooky.” Harry frequently found himself wondering why the old wizard had left him at the Dursley’s when there was a perfectly capable legal guardian waiting for him in the magic world. “Do you think he’s using the stone to carry on living? He seems old enough.”
“And what about Moony?”
After that, Sirius opened up his gifts. From Draco, a CD of his favourite Muggle punk band and from Remus, a new bottle of his favourite cologne. The look in his eye suggested that this wasn’t the only present Moony would be giving him, but Draco turned away in silent disgust before he could know for sure. Sirius had gotten Harry a book of photographs of himself, Harry’s father, Moony and a small, stout man Draco had never seen before. Remus told the boys that the man was no longer their friend because he turned out to be a follower of Voldemort, so Sirius had made a rather funny show of defacing the mystery man each picture that included him with moustaches and stupid hats. Harry had thanked Sirius profusely and promised that he would start writing to them himself once he got back to Hogwarts.
“Why haven’t you killed anyone yet?” asked Draco, suspiciously. “I bet you could’ve.”
“One problem at a time, please.” The pair continued walking until they were stopped again by a putrid smell filling their nostrils. They looked up, only to have their eyes met with a gross, gangly creature, striding down the hall. Harry and Draco ducked behind a statue as it passed, seemingly oblivious to their existence, and watched as it entered the room next to them. “Lock it in, lock it in!” Harry did as he was told and turned the key until he heard a satisfying click. Draco breathed a sigh of relief before freezing, eyes wide at the sound of girlish screams coming from the room they had just locked. “Oh Salazar, unlock the door!” Harry reached forward once more, now panicked, Hermione was now locked in a room with a troll. When the door swung open, the pair darted inside and immediately ducked as a piece of painted plywood came rocketing at their heads.
He reached into the tree, searching for the heavy book. He hauled it out enthusiastically and subsequently plopped onto the ground. He flipped the pages so fast that one of them ripped, causing him to wince. Draco was suddenly incredibly glad this wasn't a library book. Madam Pince would have his head.
He stopped short. Harry was already sitting there, alone, chewing on the end of a quill endearingly and staring at a book. Draco hesitated but decided that this probably qualified as some type of extenuating circumstance, and it would be okay to ignore Harry's request, just this once. With that in mind, he readjusted his grip on his books and walked to the table. Harry glanced up as he neared, breaking out into a tentative smile. "Draco. I was wondering if I should try to come to find you. This potions assignment is a bloody nightmare."
Draco nearly fell off the bench. The court broke out in whispers again. Harry Potter, Golden Boy and champion of the light, defending known Death Eaters? It was unheard of. Resentment burned in him. Hadn't he told Potter that he and his mother didn't need nor want saving? It was just like the git to go ahead and do what he wanted and ignore his wishes. Bloody savior.
"Draco, I-" Harry didn't know how to finish that, or why he had started in the first place. Harry, not unwillingly, felt his eyes drawn to Draco's lips and stared at the perfection of them. He recalled, very vividly, how soft they had felt against his own.
"Do you still have nightmares?"
Ron shook his head. "Just how much do you know about Malfoy's eating habits, Harry?" Harry looked between him and Hermione, confused. "Not much. He likes to eat eggs and toast for breakfast, with fruit and pumpkin juice. He usually eats some type of sandwich for lunch or soup. When he's mad, he picks at his food a lot. When he's smug or happy, he eats sweeter foods. When he's planning something, he eats more fruit and fewer grains. Really, I'm surprised that neither of you know this." They were gaping at him now.
-----------------------------
And drunk.
"So there's no hope then," Harry whispered brokenly. The Aurors looked at each other uncomfortably, and Harry pulled himself together, nodding to both of them. "Thanks for your help. If you'll excuse me." McGonagall regarded him sorrowfully as he turned and left her office.
I hope you are doing well. First, let me give you my sincerest gratitude for saving us, both from the Dark Lord and from Azkaban. I cannot thank you enough for sparing my son from that cruel place. You should know I do not blame you for not defending my husband - he chose this path, and he knew the possible consequences.
Harry smiled into his shoulder. "Thanks, Draco. It means more than you could ever know." He whispered softly. Draco patted him on the back before pulling away. He gave Harry one last sad smile, then hurried off to breakfast.
“Come through the Floo, Lupin. I need to show you something.” There came a small
“Thank you. You have no idea how happy I am.” He watched as Harry’s eyes filled with joyful tears and reached out his hand, placing it on his knee, warm and steady. The other boy seemed to appreciate it because he covered it with his own.
Sirius smiled at the two people he loved most in the world. Moony had told him about accepting the teaching position at Hogwarts as Harry and Draco were saying their dramatic goodbyes, as if they weren’t going to see each other again in a week. He was thrilled, of course, although it was sad that it had to happen under such awful circumstances.
Big Wolfstar energy going on in this chapter (and, of course, Drarry too!!)
“It seems to me that Draco is just being possessed by Ice, the spirit. That can easily be fixed by befriending them.”
“And promise to love, cherish, honour and trust you through everything.”
“For all eternity.”
“Yes!” Pansy cried. “You have to continue the pureblood line!”
McGonagall nodded. “That was exactly our thinking, I just needed your permission to get to work fireproofing it, perhaps expanding it. We don't want Draco and Harry close to each other when they lose control at the same time.”
“Oh, well, yes.” he mumbled.
Okay quick notes:
“So should I get a constellation tattoo? If we’re all getting one?” asked Draco, smiling contentedly.
Draco didn’t really want to play Quidditch, he just wasn’t in the mood. And if Draco wasn’t in the mood, it turned out that Harry wasn’t either. Instead, they found a place in the stands to sit and talk, so that they could occasionally show an interest in the game, but mostly so that they weren’t overheard.
Oh my God! We're one chapter away from this first book being over! This is so exciting, I am genuinely really happy with this whole story. I've got a lot of ideas for future books, I've given a small taste of what we might expect in the future in his chapter.
Remus winked. “Hello.”
The boggart did, as expected, turn into Snape and Neville, being the strong person that he was, transformed his clothes into those of his grandmother’s which, Draco had to admit, was very funny. The whole class laughed at the boggart and it moved on to each student, transforming into their worst fears.
“Alright. Nobody speaks until the prophecy is done, understood?” Dumbledore watched as every head in the room nodded numbly and then turned his attention to the ball. He tapped it with his wand, and it began to speak with a calm voice, like water hitting the rocks on a beach.
They opened it to reveal some sickles and a few knuts, but ignored them in favour of carefully folding up the sock and making sure it was secure.
“On my ankle.”
“And?”
Remus lifted his brows in light surprise. “Right, yes, you never got a go, did you? Do you think it might be… Voldemort?”
“Yes...”
“We’re not in dang-”
Remus looked towards the two innocent, kind boys sitting together on the sofa in each other’s comforting embrace and sighed.
“Why is that strange? Harry’s
“I would bet everything I own that you did!” Sirius snapped. It had been a long day. Remus had just gotten back from a particularly bad transformation and work had been rough lately, the last thing they needed was an owl from their ex-headmaster telling them that their son and his friend had killed a full sized Basilisk that was living in a Chamber underneath the school.
They were interrupted though at two points, first by a dough-faced boy complaining about a lost toad, and a bushy-haired girl inquiring after, presumably, the same toad. But aside from that, the conversation flowed naturally. It was as though the boys had known each other all their lives. Harry was reluctant to leave when Draco suggested they get into their robes. After changing, it wasn’t long before they pulled up at Hogsmeade station and joined the rest of the students on the platform.
By the next week, Ron, Harry, Draco and Hermione were all friends. Of course, Harry and Draco still kept themselves to themselves more than anything, and made sure that their group of Slytherin lackeys was still as loyal as ever, but Hermione and Ron proved to themselves to be very good study partners, and Ron was glad to help Harry figure out what was underneath the trapdoor when Draco couldn’t really care less. However, on Halloween, Ron showed up to dinner alone, so Harry sent one of their gang, Millicent Bulstrode, to find out what had happened. After about ten minutes, she returned with the news that Ron and Hermione had had an argument and that Hermione was crying in one of the girls toilets. Pansy Parkinson cackled at that.
It was agony, every time. Like his heart didn’t quite fit in his chest and was trying to break free, as though it were trying to escape the horror that was his body. Screaming out in agony did nothing to relieve the pain, but he couldn’t help it.
“I want to talk about how you’re doing. I am technically your godfather so it is my duty to check.” Harry’s eyes dimmed slightly.
“What’re we talking about?” he asked, glancing around.
“You didn’t know what was so bad?” Remus asked, deciding to play dumb and hope that the problem would fix itself.
“Siriusly! And old Zonko is getting on a bit so who knows? He might die and leave the place to his most trusted employee.”
“He stopped?”
His eyes were filled with too much admiration to say no. “Okay.” He focused his attention on the specific memory of the light in Harry’s eyes when he realised that he didn’t have to accept death so soon, mainly on the colour. The bright, emerald green that Draco now realised he probably wouldn’t be able to live without. Feeling suddenly light and powerful, he cast the spell, and from his wand emerged a silver creature, with elegant limbs and a graceful canter, that danced around him before swiftly leaving.
For a few days - weeks? Months? Years? - Harry drifted in and out of sleep, sometimes opening his eyes to see a redheaded boy playing Wizard’s Chess with a bushy haired girl, or a stern looking witch, who Harry vaguely remembered, peering down at him over her glasses, or a boy, who Harry assumed was some kind of guardian angel, working his lower lip with his teeth and watching him curiously, concerned. When he would see that Harry was awake, his face lit up and he tried to say something, but it all sounded like absolute nonsense to Harry.
“Everybody! Gather round. We’re going to choose two of you to do a demonstration.” He looked around the group, pausing on each face, as though he were a child choosing Pick ‘n Mix. He stopped abruptly and gasped. “Ah, Harry Potter.” Harry groaned quietly. “Come up here, my boy, let’s see what you can do.” He sullenly trudged over to the platform and stood next to Lockhart, who was busy choosing the next victim. He pointed his bejewelled finger at Ron. “You.”
“Harry’s a Parseltongue.”
He held them a little closer.
“Why would Dumbledore be keeping that thing in a school? And why would he have it anyway?”
“I’ll do it, I know Dobby better than you do.”
- Thirdly, hears to the end of lockdown! I see it on the horizon I think. I'm going back to real school tomorrow, I've been in online school since the christmas holidays. I think it's gonna be good, seeing real people again. It's been so long.
“But I expect you’ve realised by now what it does?”
They screamed. Draco accelerated with all of his might and managed to raise the bike high enough to escape the train.
“Help yourselves, boys.” she said in a tired voice.
“I hope so too.” They both watched as Harry and Ron, Hermione had corrected him, got their potion marked. It was a mess, a bright, oozing yellow rather than the pale gold it was supposed to be. Still, they were laughing so hard, they seemed not to notice. Draco felt a slight pang of jealousy but also remembered the times that he and Harry had laughed that hard. It would be nice, Draco concluded, to have friends in other houses. And, strategically, it seemed like a good idea. “I’m sorry Ron was so rude to you when you first met. His family believe a lot of the stories about you. Nothing against them, they’re lovely people, but the rumours have apparently been circulating for years.” Draco was unfazed. If Ron didn’t want to like him, that wasn’t his fault. But Hermione seemed to think that he had some redeeming qualities, so if they did end up trying again, he wouldn’t be wholly against that.
