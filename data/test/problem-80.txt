“No, Draco-” Li bravely wrapped his arms around the hissing and spitting blonde, despite the scratching and dangers of maiming. “My family has been so excited to welcome you as one of our Masters. Please, believe me-”
, who else are you sending it to?” Irritation filled her voice. Despite that, she began to paw at the tunic he wore to sleep.
Another silence followed. It seemed Francis was lost on how to continue as well.
“No can do,” the Irish managed before shoving a large spoonful to his mouth, “you know, I heard they eat food raw there. Raw fish, raw horse meat, raw dog meat-”
Harry stared at the taller boy, the way the little fires cast shadows on his sallow face, until Malfoy appeared to have noticed Harry’s stare, and turned toward Harry. Grey met green for the shortest fraction of a second before Malfoy threw his gaze to the floor.
“I, on the other hand, understand very well the value of money,” Harry tensed when Tartaglia leaned over the blonde. “And I know… expensive gifts are
Harry looked down at Malfoy’s belly. “It’s not advisable when you’re pregnant,” it wasn’t his kid, but Harry was concerned. He told himself it was just because if Malfoy had a miscarriage, he would have to try for Li’s child again, and set back their marriage by another 9 months. "Why can't we invite him here instead?"
So Harry obediently sent several more official letters.
“Snezhnaya collapsed over a decade ago right?” Harry didn’t understand. “If Snezhnaya had such powerful protectors, just how did it collapse?”
On the King’s right, his Queen was glaring hatefully at the man who was to be her husband’s second spouse.
“Cor Lapis is itself hard to gather… It must have taken true skill indeed to unearth two pieces so alike…” [1]
Harry didn’t reply. His heart was beating too loudly for him to hear anything else. He opened the letter quickly, like pulling a bad tooth.
During the war, after the Order of the Phoenix
Malfoy shot up to his feet. He looked positively broken from the betrayal. “I knew it,” his voice was breathy as he forced his words between his sobs and heavy breathing. “There is no way the Most Noble and Ancient House Li and the great Marchioness Yelan wanted to accept my tarnished family with open arms! Since the beginning, you have only been eyeing for my blood, the blessings of the stars running through House Bl-”
The mansion did not look like anything out of the ordinary from the gates, but once Harry stepped in, he was surprised by the interior.
“Time flew by so fast,” Zhongli said sincerely as he was sending his guests off at the entrance hall. It was unbelievable how well Tartaglia behaved when he was with the amber-eyed man; like he was a harmless kitten, instead of the tiger he was.
“HOW COULD YOU!?” Harry swung his hand in a slashing motion and accidentally released a non-verbal, wandless spell. The wind produced by his magic nearly knocked every furniture in sight. “They are still Petra's citizens!! ENOUGH! THIS DECISION IS FINAL!”
Harry knew the blonde would be enjoying his tea with a lot of cream. It was the way he always took his tea.
Harry did not receive any reply. The next he checked, Lord and Lady Greengrass had followed their daughters and settled down in Kasha, leaving their fiefdom to be managed by their half-blood distant relatives.
Not wanting to be left out (and not having a Marauders’ Map for this Castle), Harry tried to excuse himself to the toilet and follow them. Until he was caught.
she was frowning even without looking at her.
“Jueyun chilli,” Zhongli muttered. Unlike with other gifts, he seemed as though grief had swallowed him. “Xiangling loved to cook with Jueyun chilli…” his gold eyes looked like they were heartbroken.
Even without being able to see half his face, Harry knew Malfoy was queasy. “You know King Riddle was… obsessed with the idea of immortality, right?”
she looked, gave a dismissive gesture. “Ilvermorny would have been more ideal; they also have four houses, and less cultural distance.”
Malfoy did not even spare the ring two seconds of his attention. He immediately curtsied, the shimmery midnight blue of his long robes gathered in pale milky hands. Harry’s eyes fixated on the top of his head as Malfoy replied, “Thank you, Your Majesty. I hope I can meet your expectations.”
“Your Majesty?” Malfoy looked baffled.
The servant whose arms were covered in detailed green markings entered with a huge tray of food skillfully balanced on his hands. From the dizzying array of colours, it did appear that one portion of everything Harry had eaten was there.
The black-haired man stepped closer, taking off his gloves as he walked.
Slughorn broke the silence with his fidgeting. “M-miss Parkinson does have the correct profile…”
Ginny’s face had lighted up when she laid her eyes on the trolley. “Breakfast in bed? Wow, Harry, you’re so nice…” she was warm as she wrapped her arms around him and gave him a smooch on the cheek.
The black-haired monarch only stared back blankly.
The muggle-born in the room decided to rescue her friend. “You all have a conflict of interest,” she spoke to her in-laws in a soft, but firm voice.
But the dizziness quickly disappeared due to the sight that greeted him: a majestic Castle at the top of a mountain, illuminated by golden rays of a sun barely risen from the horizon, shining on red pillars and green mutton-fat jade of the roof. The same curling roof which were etched on the stone door. The sky was a myriad of purple and dark orange, clouds lined in yellow edges so bright Harry had to look away.
Harry sighed inwardly. The first one was still better, despite how distant it might sound. He brought the trolley closer to the door…
Harry sighed and slumped further into his chair. “Does anyone know why?”
“No way!”
The horcruxes. Oh yeah, definitely.
Been listening to 'A Letter to Snezhnaya' and 'the Listener' on repeat when writing this chapter...
This person was more important and more powerful than the King of Petra.
“I know you don’t need me to spell it out loud, Lady Granger,” Malfoy carded his fingers through his hair, bringing the pale locks away from his face. The skin around his eyes were starting to turn puffy.
“You will have a more distant relationship with him than your relationship with Her Majesty, of course,” the Hand tried to persuade his King. Slughorn spoke the truth; they were hard-pressed to come up with even one more name of a suitable female candidate. “That’s fine. The Consort’s main job is to represent the conservative purebloods faction. You only need to be intimate with him maybe once… for consummation and an heir-”
Harry wanted to snarl. Something simmered under his skin when he spied Malfoy and Li sharing worried looks, again communicating without words. Before Harry entered the drawing room, he had been very reluctant to invoke the Life Debt, preferring to wait for a response from Nott. Harry didn’t understand where all these came from… He didn’t still have any remnants of horcruxes in him, did he?
The things they went through together… the Sectumsempra curse, the blonde refusing to identify Harry when Harry was captured by the snatchers…
It was an exquisite brooch in the shape of a lily, the white enameled petals tastefully dotted in tiny diamonds. The craftsmanship was so superb the flower looked delicate, despite being made of unyielding precious stones.
, Harry nearly snarled, the viciousness of the thought surprising him.
Other than Malfoy and Nott, the committee also identified other eligible pureblood bachelors such as Marcus Flint, Terrence Higgs and Adrian Pucey. Slughorn strongly stressed that the Sacred Twenty-Eight was his preference, however. Specifically, Malfoy, to Harry’s chagrin.
Evidently, after only a couple of weeks since Draco Malfoy entered Harry’s court, more than a handful of conservative purebloods had begun showing up regularly in morning assemblies. Of course, Slughorn had moved to Vawella, the capital of Petra. The Greengrasses too had returned from Kasha, although Astoria remained there. They were just the beginning.
Malfoy gave her a once-over and nodded in approval.
Only after the entire Weasley clan departed from the meeting room and the 4 of them remained, Harry slumped into the chair at the head of the table. He casually gestured at his friends to take a seat. “What do you think of the proposal?”
“Zhongli xian sheng,” a younger looking auburn haired man in what seemed to be black and grey military uniform interrupted the amber-eyed man’s musing. The red scarf around his neck seemed old and tattered, but the redhead didn’t seem to mind any one bit. “There’s an owl for you.”
Harry wanted to rub his temples. Another one of those customs only the secretive pureblood society knew. “I see,” he remarked curtly. “I will also require you to produce an heir for my dynasty. Let’s put into the contract that your first child will carry on the duchy of Gryffindor line, and your second child-”
“I’m sorry Gin, I think I’m too tired.”
It wasn’t that Harry had any other woman in his mind.
“... Sure,” Harry sighed again before he forced himself to get up. He was always so tired these days. “Let’s call it an early night… we’ll be busy with our guests from Kasha tomorrow.”
“Harry!” Ginny demanded for her husband’s attention. “Did you ask for Malfoy’s hand? You’ve moved on to men now?”
There was silence for a moment, before someone sighed. “Blaise, you are not even aiming to be my aide, are you?”
The carriage jerked as the thestrals took off. Malfoy looked calm as he replied. “I thought friendship with Lord Zhongli is no skin off your back.”
The reaction was immediate. “Your Majesty-” most raised their voices in a protest.
NOTE: You can return to the story here!
Hermione blinked. “The same House Li that was the ruling family in the Tang dynasty almost a thousand years ago?”
The panic in the older wizard’s face was unmistakable, before the emotion was quickly extinguished and replaced with a wide smile.
Ginny snorted as she moved her hips against his. “Seriously?”
“That’s because I had to stay alert for his tricks!” Harry gritted his teeth.
‘You don’t have to do this,’ was on the tip of Harry’s tongue, but Malfoy had made his stance clear. It was one of those pureblood things the liberal faction couldn’t understand.
“Blaise,” Malfoy replied amiably from Harry’s left at the dining table. He was dressed resplendently in dark maroon v-necked robes, a vest with golden embroideries that ended at his midriff hugging his torso. Recently, Malfoy had worn more and more of House Gryffindor colours, and clothes that had decidedly more feminine style; they were cinched at the waist and flared out to give the illusion of wider hips. Harry liked those, but he disliked the reminders of Malfoy’s pregnancy from the way he avoided wearing anything restrictive around his abdomen. “We’re happy to have you with us,” the blonde raised his glass of apple juice to toast the dark-skinned wizard, the tourmaline catching the light of the chandeliers, “Is your mother well?”
Ron looked similarly overwhelmed. So much so that he forgot his resentment over Harry’s Second Consort. “I’m… I’m going to be an uncle, Harry,” his best friend held Harry’s hands in a tight grip, his voice quivering.
Arthur Weasley was an impoverished lord whose ancestors had lost their county lands. House Weasley lived in the neighbourhood. One day, Arthur had met Harry in a terrible storm when the boy was out on an errand. The kind redhead had sheltered Harry in his cramped, badly-in-need-of-renovation, warm home. That was how Harry’s friendship with Arthur’s youngest son Ron began.
Theodore’s dark blue eyes looked feverish even as he reported with fake calmness, “Lord Malfoy, your former great-uncle-in-law to be… Zhongli and his lover… They are in Petra! [2]”
Everyone heaved a sigh of relief inwardly when the redhead moved away to the windowsill. He stood there watching what Harry assumed to be Zhongli, outside in the garden. For once, his blue eyes did not look cold; it was as though the permafrost had thawed. The King stood to attention again when Tartaglia shifted his gaze to Hermione. “I accept your down payment, Lord Malfoy.”
The peaceful afternoon was interrupted when a messenger barged into the Castle apartment Harry had designated permanently for his godson’s family. The messenger looked harried.
Comment please!
The migraine behind Harry’s eyes threatened to overtake his whole head. The King gritted his teeth. “Tell Count Shacklebolt to assemble the war council. And tell Count Moody to start preparing provisions for the Aurors and Dumbledore’s Army.”
It was clear that some sort of faux pas had been committed, when the Queen of Petra was only replied with the coldest glare from Kasha’s Maîtresse-en-titre’s arctic blue eyes.
Harry was lost. He never liked it when aristocrats beat around the bush, relying on implied meanings instead of being direct.
Harry hoped he wouldn’t regret his decision.
Hermione merely studied him with her penetrating gaze, as always, before speaking, in a small voice, after they were safely
“You wouldn’t even have the chance to brag about your oh-so-precious stones without my intel-” Theodore Nott stopped trying to hide his anger.
The blonde stood up and bowed in greeting as Harry entered, richly dressed in a high-necked green robe, the hems lined in gold embroideries of the Chinese Fireball and a giant wolf.
Harry groaned and covered his face with his palm. “How many times must I tell you that I was only suspicious that he was plotting something! I was right, wasn’t I?” The fight fled from Harry when he remembered that the chain of events leading to Dumbledore’s death. He slumped like an unbearable weight was unloaded on his shoulders.
“We didn’t get to know each other very much, when I visited Syaoran the summers when we were children. I’m glad I have the chance to get to know you better now, Great-uncle-in-law,” Malfoy bowed. Some colours still had not returned to his face.
“Is there anything I can hide from you, Draco?” Zabini flirted openly, his voice silky smooth like butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth.
“That is that, this is this!” Seamus retorted, and they all laughed.
Harry himself merely laughed when he first read the letter. Compared to all the double-speak and fake politeness used by the nobles, Parkinson’s reply was certainly refreshing. Luna looked amused as well as she read the letter, while Neville cringed.
Harry turned to the source of the voice sharply.
“Yes,” Little Wolf echoed.
Tartaglia continued to look down coldly at Malfoy. Seconds crawled unbearable slowly at a snail’s pace, until the silence was broken with a snigger.
Hermione continued to observe the blonde keenly. “Your target wasn’t your ‘Great uncle’, was it?” Harry could literally hear the air quotes.
Malfoy rose to his feet and began to pace around the small dais. It was rare to see him this agitated. “What… how… why? Last time I heard, Great-uncle-in-law and Childe are in Yamato…”
Harry thought that Hermione would use the portkey back home like Zabini, Nott and Luna, but he didn’t mind riding in the same carriage as her, too.
“She is…from a conservative pureblood family, I think.” Slughorn rubbed his chin. “But her family isn’t… exactly influential.”
Malfoy pursed his lips to a white line. He turned to Harry to ask him questions. “Will divorce be allowed?”
“Hmm…” Malfoy looked pleased as he eyed the pair of gold earrings on his gloved palm. “Good job, Blaise.”
Malfoy put a gloved hand on his handkerchief, the other hand unconsciously resting on his stomach. “Yes,” he murmured absently.
There was an insult implied there somewhere, Harry thought, but Malfoy only accepted it breezily. “I’m glad my life amuses you, Blaise.”
The blonde’s companion rose to his feet. He was a slender Han Chinese man with the build of a swordmaster, his shoulders wide and his arms leanly muscled. Strands of tousled brown hair covered his dark eyes, which were framed by thick, strong brows. He was also dressed regally in green robes, the same shade and materials as Mafoy’s it seemed. The green was not the dark emerald of Slytherin green, but a vibrant viridian, like the leaves of oak trees in the height of summer.
Malfoy threw his gaze to the side. “...of sorts.”
Harry had dreamed about it for so long… soon. Any day now-
Nobody said anything when the King didn’t get off as they passed by Count Moody’s home, and accompanied his fiance all the way till they reached Petra’s Royal Castle.
Well… technically, the blonde wasn’t wrong.
“Harry,” Ginny leaned close and cupped his face. “Harry, please don’t do this. I love you… does it mean nothing?”
As soon as he left, the hall broke into whispers again.
“I am so sorry, Your Majesty!” The messenger dropped to his knees. He was sweating bullets. “Lord Shacklebolt has a very urgent and important message for you!”
The bad news was, Macnair refused to name any accomplices and he had killed himself with a hidden dagger to keep his secrets to the death. He must have been very desperate for a proud pureblood wizard to choose to end his life the muggle way.
instead of rejoicing that all his wet dreams were coming true. (Come to think of it, he didn’t have wet dreams of her. He didn’t have wet dreams, period. His subconscious was, unfortunately, filled with nightmares still.) Since then, they had barely talked.
Ginny looked doubtful. “Not Malfoy! You always paid attention to him in school-”
Harry continued with small talk over tea for the next fifteen minutes or so. He could tell that with each second that passed, the blonde was becoming more and more unraveled. Halfway through the chat, his fiance had reached over to cover Malfoy’s pale hand with his own, his thumb rubbing over the blue veins below Malfoy’s knuckles. The smile Malfoy had returned him with was sincere.
“Not at all, Your Majesty!” Harry felt slightly guilty that his acting had made the elderly wizard drop to his knees, his bones creaking audibly. “I am loyal to Your Majesty! Never have I harboured the thought of having anyone else on the throne!” He suddenly turned and snapped his fingers. “Lizzy!”
At Harry’s answer, the Queen was filled with anger. She stepped away, her face contorting in fury. “If you’re that afraid of them, confiscate their wealth! Strip them off their lands and titles! You are the king, aren’t you!?”
The blonde only bowed with his head. “I will discuss the draft contract with my parents, Your Majesty. I’m sure you need to go through it with your subjects as well.”
Zabini had barely finished returning the gesture when Harry saw Ginny rising to her feet.
“How can I-” Slughorn had a knee-jerk reaction to deny what Harry said, “So many of my dear colleagues-”
Harry was speechless.
The moment the black-haired Han Chinese left, it felt as though the temperature of the room had dropped by ten degrees.
“Greetings, Your Majesties. I am honoured to meet you. This humble subject wishes the Great Kingdom of Petra everlasting glory,” the pureblood wizard blithely carried on, purposely ignoring the stares from Harry’s wife and busybody courtiers.
“King Harold…” someone spoke helplessly when there was no reaction from the man.
Theodore Nott remained on his knees. “Your Majesty, I am aware that my reply was far too late and I have slighted your goodwill. I come to you to remedy my mistakes,” when he finally raised his head, he sent his imploring gaze straight at Malfoy. “Lord Malfoy, you do not have an aide yet, do you? I offer everything, absolutely everything at my disposal to be of service to you.”
To his first child.
“Yes,” Childe didn’t even spare a thought at his wallet. He was used to it by now. They had been together for a long, long time after all.
“Come on,” Hermione scowled, but her eyes were filled with delight. “You’re Gryffindors, aren’t you? Where’s your courage? Your spirit of adventure?”
“Your Majesty, please,” Malfoy’s voice trembled. Harry was shocked by his pleading gaze. In the months they worked together in governing Petra, Malfoy had never begged Harry for anything, not even for allowing Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy to return. “With portkeys, it’ll only be a day-trip at most…”
“Your Majesty, forgive me… but have you considered pureblood wizards?” Shacklebolt broached.
Ginny visibly twitched. Harry forced a wide smile onto his face. He’d only been in the stifling red and gold robes that he was forced into for less than an hour, and his entire body already itched. His official crown was heavy too. “We are happy to have you as well.”
In the end, they settled for a platinum ring with watermelon tourmaline teardrop cut and tiny diamonds, the pink so dark it looked red. Unlike most tourmalines, there was no clear separation between the green and the pink colours [1]. The precious stone carried with it Harry’s wish for the future of Petra.
“That would really help us,” Malfoy looked pleased too. One of his first few tasks was organising his own engagement party. Judging from how he had planned for and hosted his banquets so far, Harry wasn’t worried. “Shall we expect another happy announcement from your mother soon?”
“I promise I won’t penalise you, Horace,” Harry had an inkling of what he was going to hear anyway, “even if you say something untoward about my court.” He revealed his mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
So Harry said, when he hadn’t seriously thought about her for a while.
The meeting didn’t go that badly. In fact, Harry managed to accomplish most of the things that he wanted to.
again.
to look so earnestly confused at his response – it was unbelievable.
As Draco woke, his thoughts flew immediately to the previous night.  Had it been a dream?  Or had he really gotten off with Harry after reading smutty prose?  The description alone sounded unreal, and he forced himself to focus on the series of events to make sure they followed a logical, worldly progression.
GEORGE: Oh!  Right.  For your technical challenge, you will each be making 24 pirouette biscuits.
went the keys; “gay striped sweaters” appeared in the search bar, then “gay men’s fashion” and “how to tell if someone is gay.”  He continued his research with unpracticed hands until he could feel his eyes start to hurt.
“I think I remember you telling me that Muggle fashion would only send confusing signals to him,” Harry quipped, grinning at her reflection before glancing at his own and being startled all over again at how different he looked.
“-still be mixing up his teeth-cleaning and bubblehead charms,” Narcissa cut in with a pointed look at her husband.  “Being old does not make us wise, Lucius.”

“What?” he could only ask, dumbly.  “
Draco bit the inside of his cheek, wondering sardonically how many things his father would steal from him in his life.  Judging by his timing now, he clearly wasn’t past it.  “Harry, Harry,” he said, savoring the taste of that name upon his tongue, “you clearly have no idea what they’re like.  If I don’t go, my mother will show up at my door in a few minutes.  And I’d rather not have

What the hell did Potter
The man glared distrustfully at him for several seconds before finding their names on the form again and confirming that he was telling the truth.  “Fine.  I suppose that’s all in order, then.  You may proceed.”
When Harry made no move to leave, he shoved him towards the door.  “I said,
”  He ran his hands up Draco’s knees and skated them neatly up his thighs.  The switch-up was so sudden and unexpected that Draco felt like he’d been hit by a train.  The sight of Harry, kneeling smugly between his legs, was so arousing that he was certain he would pass out any second.
“No!  Of all the stupid-” Pottered blabbered.  He seemed too startled by this chance meeting to form proper sentences.  “Why are you here, Malfoy?”
“Only if you come back and demonstrate more for my Quidditch class,” Draco replied, then immediately bit his tongue.  It wouldn’t do to sound
“We’re just getting started.”
By midway through the lesson, he’d given up and leaned resignedly against Harry’s desk as he watched others find their happiness.  It was bittersweet, yet rewarding, when an owl burst from Sam’s wand and flew a loop around the room.  In the aftermath, Draco caught him grinning winsomely at his friend Antoni – and, noting Harry watching over them fondly, realized that this must be Sam’s secret crush.
As if there were others.
The students, of course, had the option to bring a broom from home; though, most used the school’s ready supply of Nimbus 2001s, as they were of excellent quality and had held up over time.  But on rare occasion, as he had been warned by Hooch following his job acceptance, a student brought in a broom that was actually

Draco let out a groan at the thought, then immediately snapped back to reality.
.  Draco let his mind latch on the words as he was tugged gently away.  Something soft enveloped him, and then the world went mercifully dark.
Draco woke up gasping.
“I should go,” he mumbled quickly – moving to stand before Draco could get a word in edgewise.
“About what?”

The past week had been a delirious dream.

The tension eased as Draco felt the smugness worm its way back across his face.  “She did, didn’t she?”

Okay, so I messed up some of my timestamps for the jumps to Draco's past, and I SINCERELY apologize.  I did bad math the once, and then it messed up the subsequent ones as well. 😱😱😱  So if you noticed the timeline was bad and were just too polite to say anything, know that I am suitably ashamed of myself and have gone back to correct past chapters.  Therefore, the "1 year, 3 months earlier" sections that appear in this chapter are following the ones from previous chapters in sequence.

Jenkins’ mouth flapped open then closed several times in mute argument.
“We’re not really here to discuss Quidditch, are we?”
With a grimace, Draco knocked.
When he entered the pub this time, he looked around immediately for Bagman.  For a few terrible moments, he thought he’d been set up, until he noticed the jolly man mingling with the people in Quidditch leathers near the back.  He hesitated a moment before joining them.
”  Draco raised a brow.  “Like
“And heaven forbid you actually
If he said it first, then it would cut less if Potter said it back.
Harry rode his fingers with urgency, pushing back against him when Draco started to pull back.  After another minute, he twisted around to beg, “Just put it in.”
Harry surveyed the room before gesturing to the Bat’s Blood Soup fountain that burbled nearby.  “Let’s get some Mice Pops to dip!”
“I know, right?  I wasn’t even planning to start working with them on that until next week, but I ran out of material-” he caught Draco’s eye roll, “
“Are you going to go visit?” Harry asked again when Friday was winding down into evening.  He spoke casually, like he might be able to slip the question in without Draco noticing and therefore get a different answer.
Anyway, hope you're all having a good week and staying safe!
The morning before the Ball, his mother stopped by on a “social visit” – though Draco suspected it had everything to do with interrogating him about his party plans and nothing to do with the “sudden urge to see him” she feigned as her primary motivation.  After an interminable sentence to tea, she finally left, making him promise to come by in the morning with news – which proved his theory quite nicely.
He exhaled, driving every ounce of breath from his lungs before filling them again to bursting.  In the face of such a dizzying expanse of world before him, he couldn’t help but feel his thoughts stripped down to honesty.  He was terrified.  Terrified that Hogwarts – the only place to offer him any kindness or respite following the war – wouldn’t be enough to drive the claustrophobia from his mind.  That he was too fucked up to fit in anywhere.  That if he couldn’t make it work here, there was nowhere left for him to go.
Harry quailed under the directness.  “Err…no?” he managed – about a split second before realizing it was the most obvious lie he had ever told.  His gaze flicked nervously to Malfoy, whose eyebrows were climbing beyond the scope of natural human limitation.
“And the books?” Potter was saying.  “What the fuck were you thinking?!  You think I like being reminded of all the slander about me in the news?”
(See the end of the chapter for
At first, the pitch seemed ordinary.  It was empty, save for a few people gathered with brooms on the far side of the stands – too far to make out clearly.  Draco stumbled a few steps away from his captors before turning.
was none other than Potter: an enemy to boast.
Ron passed him a bottle of spiked pumpkin juice (which was becoming a fad with the locals of Hogsmeade).  Harry popped off the cap with a twist and turned back to see Malfoy looking at him expectantly.
“I prevented you from coming, yes,” Draco admitted.  “I certainly didn’t force you to keep yourself aroused for an hour and…” he checked his watch, “-fifteen minutes.  Nice stamina, Potter.”  He said it teasingly, but the thought of Harry here after he left, aroused and desperate, had his own body reacting quite uncontrollably.
“Oh, this?”  Harry’s voice dripped with false innocence—a skill he’d tailored over a decade of sidestepping the rules.  “Souvenir.”  His eyes were sparkling and green and…deeply amused.
They showed off some blocks and rolls, trying to one-up each other as usual, and when he suggested a scrimmage, Potter acquiesced more easily than he would have expected.  Perhaps it had something to do with the way he kept twitching whenever Draco called him “Professor” – a pleasant surprise that had Draco revising his previous stance.
“No, I was just…saying hi.  I’m going back over there.”  He gestured weakly to where Ron was setting up Parcheesi with Hermione and Dean to either side of him; his friend had been forced to get into Muggle board games lately, after Hermione had endured one too many snaps exploding in her face.  The group was only several feet away, though, so the excuse was awfully flimsy.

Which was really…quite a bit more transparent than Harry had clearly intended.  Draco glowed a bit with pleasant embarrassment.
Harry seemed to like that one, because he began bobbing his head almost furiously.
Here, Draco’s mind snapped from its relative peace, as he reeled with sudden, terrible realization.  He
“No,” Harry said firmly.  “Because…well, it sounds stupid, but-”
Potter obliged, but since he was a prat, he did some fancy spin on the way.  Clearly, he was unaffected by the encounter.
and if he must yet accept that, he thought: why not start?

“Though, not altogether inaccurate,” he rushed to admit.  Heat bloomed across his face, but this time, he let it.  He decided that if he used vulnerability as self-punishment for every time he was a dick to someone, it would certainly discourage him from doing so in the future.
He slid into a seat at the far end of the bar and thanked his lucky stars that the place was lit dimly to hide unsavory characters like himself.  After a moment or two, he was noticed by the bartender – a harried-looking woman in her forties – whose face flickered with recognition, but thankfully nothing more; she took his order discreetly and slid a firewhisky across the counter without a word.

By the time the afternoon rolled around though, not even the book could keep his mind from wandering to today’s class visit.  What had possessed him to agree to a duel?  He was clearly in no mental state to hold himself together for that.  As it was, his feelings were constantly fluctuating between an easy confidence that he had Potter right where he wanted him and the debilitating realization that he was deluded and undeserving, and it would never fucking
A pang of sympathy – so sharp it pained him physically – shot through Draco.  He had spent so many years of his life terrified of that exact outcome that even now, over a month into officially “dating” Harry, he still woke from nightmares of rejections that hadn’t come to pass.
“Oh, Draco!  You’re looking…tense.  You heading to see Hannah?”
His muscles were taut with the effort of not coming.  The wet heat, the attentive grip – it was all he could do to hold himself together.  Draco let his eyes fall shut for a moment to center himself, flicking them open every few seconds to remember he wasn’t dreaming.
“No,” he repeated.  “Absolutely
, he had forgotten that his earlier marks might still be here.  Something white-hot and insistent lodged in his throat as he caught sight of the fading bruises painted across the swell of Harry’s bum.  He couldn’t help but reach out and touch, grabbing a handful of flesh and kneading it under his grip.  “
She stared out the darkened window for a while before continuing.  “So in the beginning, I didn’t mind, you see.  That we were welcoming in convicts.  In those days, Bagman had me convinced that we’d created a safe place for Wizarding folk like us who had lost ours – that the system was unjust, and we were fighting back.”  She heaved another sigh, this one lifting and dropping her shoulders with the weight of disillusionment.
“Why should I help you?” he asked, leaning against the doorframe.  “After all, like you said, ‘I shouldn’t want to show my face in front of the students after yesterday.’”

Harry sipped moodily at his drink.  He was so lost in thought that he barely noticed Ron clearing his throat several times—and only responded when his friend jabbed his sharply in the ribs.

He latched onto that thought, barely remembering to force a laugh and eye roll in its wake.  “Fine, Potter,” he mumbled.  And, because he was
“I can…go?”  Harry sounded painfully hesitant, which made it easier for Draco to convince himself it was a mercy to send him away now.

. There are important events and conversations that will be mentioned, but not rewritten in their entirety, to cut down on redundancy in this sequel. However, there's also going to be new bits featuring portions of Draco's recent past (the two years between the war and then teaching). Therefore, this story is going to be a bit darker and angstier than TNFI, just by nature of Draco's journey being a little darker and angstier.
“I think you’re putting too much stock in bad rumors,” the man managed after several false starts.
“You kicked my bag,” he growled, savoring Potter’s surprise as he swung around, unsheathing his wand.
in order to get away from him…that was simply an insult.
He dragged his thumb shakily across Harry’s bottom lip, like the man had done to him only the previous night.  At the time, he’d thought he might die, and this moment was no different.  His elation was so overwhelming, he worried it might end him.
“Yes – who better for the job?  A capable, energetic teacher like yourself would be perfect to guide the children through the Ball!  And there’s been quite a hubbub about your flying classes already.”

as a professor?  What subject could you possibly teach?”
“Not a Howler, not a she,” he mumbled without thinking.  Then, he immediately gritted his teeth and closed his eyes.
Draco froze.  “Are you okay?”  Had it been his fault – had he been pulling Harry down too hard?  He’d been keeping it fairly shallow, as that was all he really needed anyway – it was easily the best thing he’d felt in his life already.
Harry nodded, and Draco curled his finger experimentally to feel at the walls.  Harry twitched responsively, and he drew his hand back slowly to press back in several times.  After a minute or two, he could feel Harry adjusting as the movement grew easier.  The man let out a quiet moan.

He smirked at Potter’s visible panic, and then the man was whirling to look at the sign that Draco was tapping idly with his fingers.  Distress looked so delicious on him.
“What, no more arguments, Potter?”  His voice was low and hoarse, but he smirked like it wasn’t a vulnerability.
“Here – let’s make a chart of which tactics have worked and which ones haven’t.”  Ron scrawled a messy line down the middle of his parchment before pointing the quill at Harry.  “Alright.  Stripey jumpers?”

“Hey.  You’re not even listening to me!”
“The hell it isn’t!” he yelled at the same moment Narcissa cut in with, “Lucius!”
That was impossible.  The thought hadn’t even occurred to him.  There was no way Potter would come here to defend him - after everything he had done.  It was

you would actually pretend to be bad at a subject in order to spend time with someone.  That’s so debasing and also the oldest cliché in the book.”
Potter’s brow crinkled in pain, and the moment teetering on vulnerability was gone.  The precipice of possibility was gone; his face was closed off, his jaw set harshly as they stood facing each other on stagnant, level ground.
,” Harry moaned as Draco pressed himself inside.  Draco’s hands – one gloved, one bare and slick – came to rest on Harry’s hips; he hauled the man back onto his dick until his arse pressed flat against his abdomen.  He heard a low, keening noise fill the air, and – a beat later – realized it was
His next idea didn’t come to him until he stumbled upon Peeves tormenting several first years in the first floor corridor.  He was showering them with a maelstrom of parchment that seemed to have spilled from one girl’s bag, and it wasn’t until after Draco had spelled it all back to rights that he realized the opportunity.

then leaned on the sill, feeling properly abashed.

“You said there was news?” he asked to hide his discomfort.
“Draco, how’d it go?” Harry asked as Draco stepped out of the fireplace.  “I was starting to worry.”
“I…” Draco nipped warningly at Harry’s hip, and he cut off a yelp before answering.  “I did.  I missed it.”  The blond glared at him, and Harry threw his hands up like “what do you want me to say?!”

Sam’s eyes widened comically, then flipped between them.  “I knew it!” he shouted.  Then, he looked embarrassed about it and burst into a laugh.
After several minutes of fussing with the cuffs unnecessarily, he drew the emerald cufflinks out and slid his shirt from his shoulders.  He folded it with a neat charm – stalling yet again – and turned back with a small smirk that died when he saw Harry eyeing his Mark.

He couldn’t tell, but he soldiered on.  “Is it alright if I come in?”
He creeped around the desks in silence until he reached the old, locked-up wardrobe.  “
Would she leave?
Before long, the snitch appeared on the far side of the field, and they both zoomed after it.  Draco was close – it was only a broom’s length or two in front of him – but he could already tell he wouldn’t make it before it reached the trees.  Unregistered games like this, the snitch could fly into whatever obstacles it wanted.
“Draco, dear.  It’s good to see you.”
“Yeah, you…” he struggled for inspiration, trying to temper the breathy quality of his voice, “you haven’t come in to chat like this in a while, so I wasn’t really expecting-”
“Sometimes, I’m just reminded that I really don’t deserve to touch you.”
I hadn’t even marked my page yet!”  Draco scrambled to do so now – though it was difficult when his arms were pinned.
Draco was on his second drink by the time he’d relaxed enough to take in his surroundings.  The bar was crowded – but not overly so.  It seemed louder than the amount of people in the room could take credit for, but he was grateful for the distracting chaos.  Several of the groups clustered in booths seemed to be wearing Quidditch leathers, which he found odd, though he didn’t think too much of it until he turned back towards the counter and was shocked by a familiar face.
[Cut to a montage of bread rising, bread deflating, and bread being cut into warm, thick slabs.  In the corner, it reads, ‘Week 4: Bread.’  The camera focuses on eccentric TV personality and bread specialist, SIRIUS BLACK, as he kneads his dough with a certain winsome flair.  Behind him, SEVERUS works methodically and glaringly – even the most unaware of audience members can tell that there is bad blood between the two professors from Hogwarts Culinary.  SNAPE snaps his dough on the table with a thwack, taking on the most violent of the bread-kneading techniques as if it’s his new religion.]
“Huh?” Marla startled out of watching Kat.  “Er, the sword?  No – it’s not!  It’s just spelled to look sharp.”  She ran her finger along the edge before Draco had time to process, and he found himself instinctively reaching out to prevent a catastrophe.  As stated, the blade did no harm, and she smiled apologetically as he withdrew his hand that hung uselessly in the air between them, embarrassed.

I’ll take you to Muggle places.”
Harry scratched at the back of his head, looking slightly embarrassed to be explaining this.  “Yeah, I mean, it was stuck between Gryffindor and Slytherin for me, so I asked it to put me in Gryffindor.  I was told that happens sometimes.”

He’d looked away immediately after saying it, like it had been an unintentional slip.  And that was why Draco had latched onto the moment with such intensity.

The room fell to a hush to hear more of her plan.  Several students came out of their dorms, urged by friends who saw that a meeting, of sorts, was forming.  Slytherins were sneaky that way – no one wanted to miss a good bit of gossip.
MINERVA: That sounds like an ambitious project.  How many biscuits do you need to cut to make the structure?
Draco bit his cheek, fighting to understand what he was referring to and coming up short.  “I can’t say I follow, sir.”
“Hannah, what do I
After a minute or two, he huffed a soft laugh as a thought came to him.
She took a deep breath and faced him squarely.  “Lucius is not doing well.”
Harry gasped, grabbing his wrist.  Draco paused for a moment, looking him in the eyes before continuing to move, curling his knuckle in the tight stretch of perineum before ghosting lower.  Harry bit his lip and tightened his grip – but not to restrict Draco; it seemed he needed something to hold on to instead.
to ask who it is?”
“By – what?  Talking to
He was cleaning up the quaffles and dismantling charms after class when he felt a light tug on his robes.  “Yes, Ella?  Did you need something?”
At the moment, Draco could not think of a person he’d less like to be having this conversation with.  “P-Professor!” he sputtered at last.  “I have no idea what you’re talking about!”
Dueling club came and passed on its typical Tuesday.  And while it was entertaining to bait both Flitwick and Harry in one sitting, Draco found that it was no longer enough to satisfy him.  The heated looks Harry had given him when they’d made overtures at dueling left him hot and uncomfortable for the remainder of the practice.
The way he said it with such trust – like he would never doubt that Draco would follow through – made a knotted mess of Draco’s heart.  Pushing aside reluctance, he marked the page in his book, sighed, and stood to gather his things.  “Very well.”
[The rest from there proceeds as normal.  Judging commences in its usual way, though instead of following the praise for CEDRIC, DRACO instead stares astonishedly after HARRY.  We can almost see the thrum of adrenaline draining from his veins as he looks more and more puzzled about recent events by the second.]
She gave off the impression of a smile, though her lips hardly moved.  “I’m just stating a fact.  You must be pleased.”  She took a sip.  “How are things with Professor Potter?”
“Fuck, Harry…”  He tried to swallow away the huskiness in his voice, but when he continued, it was still just as wretched.  “Much longer than you.  Don’t make me say it.”
“What?”  Draco knew what he was referring to, of course.  The redefinition of their relationship was the only thing currently on his mind.  However, since Harry seemed to like it when Draco played with him, he was disinclined to be straightforward.
Harry’s face reddened.  “You
Draco clenched his silverware tight enough for it to bend, and he wished – not for the first time over family dinner – that his fork was a wand instead.  “Yes, and what an
“I don’t get you,” she said after a long pause.  “Why come back here after everything that went down?”
“Exactly!” Granger said, voice somewhat impressed.  “That’s what
For a long time, Draco remained silent.  The fantasy of his peaceful Hogwarts Christmas with Harry coursed through his mind like a slow-acting poison, tightening his chest and making it harder and harder to breathe.  He wanted that – he wanted that more than anything.  But deep down, whether he wanted to admit it or not, he knew that he couldn’t.  That to do so would be utterly selfish; that his mother didn’t deserve to endure that alone, even if his presence didn’t amount to much.
“What’re you two whispering about?” Seamus asked from his perch atop the armrest.
DRACO: [dryly] Nothing yet.  [At the long pause, he schools his expression into one of forced professionalism and continues.]  Ahh, you mean for my landscape?  Yes, today I’m going to make a gingerbread replica of the Bourges Cathedral in France.  My family used to visit it during the holiday season, when the view was at its most exquisite, so that’s what I’m drawing on for today’s theme.

holding back, and we see his eyes fly skyward followed by some choice muttering to himself.  When HARRY glances back at him though, he feigns attentive interest in his layouts and molds.]
“Shut up!  I’m thinking.”
Draco rolled the wand between his fingers, delighted at its smooth, familiar grip.  For the first time in a long time, Draco knew that he’d be okay.
“In defense.”
.  They were supposed to be fighting, he thought; all the other Auror trainees were watching them supposedly demonstrate hand-to-hand combat.  But he could’ve sworn he’d heard Malfoy’s taunt before, but in a completely different context—
“Oh, for fuck’s sake!”  Malfoy exclaimed with all the frustration of a man thwarted one too many times.  He stalked over to Harry, leaving his friends behind, and grabbed him roughly by the shirt.
, anyway – but it truly is Muggle.  I’m not lying.  It was Sirius’ in the 70s.”
“G-good,” he choked out, eyes squeezing shut.  “And then…I thought of you pushing me down onto the desk.  How hot that was.”  He bit his lip before continuing, as if telling himself he couldn’t say whatever came next, before his foolish Gryffindor bravery kicked in.  “How I wanted you to throw me down and fuck me.”

He really didn’t – no one was using it anyway – and Potter said as much.  Draco brushed off his retort with another long-suffering remark, and then Potter was making this contorted face like he was trying really hard not to laugh.
Draco leveled him a glare that hopefully hid the desperation for answers in his eyes.  “You want to play pranks?  Fine.  I’ll make you regret this, Potter.”
Draco laughed, frankly amazed that he still could.  “Yeah, I thought that at first, too,” he admitted.  “It would’ve been much more manageable that way.  She didn’t even mention the jumpers, now that I think about it.  Unfortunate, really.  I was secretly hoping the fallout was close to your impression of it.”
It took every ounce of willpower to resist leaning in and completing the caress Potter had started with his eyes, but he knew how tenuous this moment was.  He needed to

Draco yanked down Harry’s trousers enough to expose his arse, but didn’t bother going further.  They hadn’t the time – everything else would have to stay on.  Draco needed him
Ron pursed his lips and leaned against the door frame.  “I’m pretty sure those are for your thumbs, mate.”

If the scene from their classroom is anything to go by, DRACO has put on quite the performance of politeness during his time on this show.

was to not let himself think too deeply about his answers, lest he find anxieties that would throw off his reaction or complicate his answers.
Since Harry’s lustful gaze was intoxicating, he put on a show of ripping the snaps off with his teeth and dragging the glove off with a well-placed bite and jerk of his chin.  He felt Harry’s cock jump against his hip.

She smiled curtly.  “Good.  Well then-” she nodded and continued on her way.
After several hours of furious grading, Harry had taken a break to inquire about the results of Draco’s potions experiment with Granger – which Draco had made the mistake of answering honestly, as it had gotten him into his current predicament.
“Ah, I see,” Draco replied quietly.  And he did.  Harry was still undecided, then, about telling people.  Either that, or he was feeling Draco out – but why would he need to?  Draco had practically admitted that he’d do anything Harry wanted, as pitiful as that might have been.
Jenkins was livid now, clutching his camera like a lifeline.  “They’re afraid to ask!  I ask the questions and get the answers that no one else will!”  He was on a roll now, face glowing with self-righteousness.  “That’s my job as a

“No, that’s okay,” Harry said quickly.  Like he might just regret the whole thing after all.
to get other men’s attention!”
A warm sense of relief was washing over him, stark in its contrast.  Harry was serious about him.  What they had – it was real.
– he probably deserved that.  But if he backed off entirely now, he’d look like a fool, so he pushed on recklessly.  “Are you sure?  It wouldn’t be the first time, after all.”
And hell, if Draco’s heart rate didn’t spike at the combination of “boyfriend” and Harry glancing bashfully at him right after.  Harry seemed to be waiting for him to say something – to clarify their relationship, maybe – but as long as Harry wasn’t opposed, Draco swore on his life he wouldn’t correct him.
Draco slipped back into himself with a jolt.  “You never even got a Potions Mastery, did you?”  He swiped mindlessly at the blood that had begun trickling from his nose.  “Did you?” he repeated.

Draco sucked in a breath.  Held it.  Slowly, let it out.  “Why, what’s it to you?”
Anyway, we're getting into some of the queer mentor moments that are near and dear to my heart.  I just have this mental image of awkward preteen boys flocking to Harry for advice, while queer preteen girls would definitely gravitate towards Draco.  That's just how I imagine it, at least.
“Even you?”
, to make fun of him for caring enough in the first place.
For long hours, he tried to practice his feints, but he found his euphoria matched by a terrible impatience.  He couldn’t focus; he could barely keep from clawing his skin off.  But he’d waited eighteen months to get here – he could wait another few hours yet.
“It’s really okay if you do.”
“It’s not a potion—it’s Muggle.”
“Well, let’s just say he seemed quite interested in how you’re handling your classes.”
The man stopped him with a hand in front of his chest.  “Sorry sir, you need to surrender your wand before entering.  Ministry protocol.”  He didn’t sound sorry.
He groaned with pleasure at the presumption.

He fought back an eye roll of disgust in favor of ignoring the reporter entirely, and asked the now wide-eyed cashier, “How much does that come to?”

Draco watched it happening and mourned the loss even as he grasped desperately for a way to reverse it.  He opened his mouth, but was cut off by Potter.
“…Thinking.”  He couldn’t very well say “counting all the ways in which I’ve fallen in love with you.”
Draco’s hands were clasped tightly in his lap.  “I appreciate your hiring me,” he said mechanically, trying to crush down the panic in his chest and think fast.  “More than you can know.  I’ll do better – I swear it!  I should’ve warned my students better about the pranks.  Or went with them, so I could supervise-”

His neck prickled.  Damned Potter was staring at him again, and Draco was an

VOLDEMORT: What’ve we got here?  [They’re in the judging round now, and he’s come to a stop still several feet away from RON’s station.  RON goes very still.]  What’ve you done to it?
He ascended to the ground floor, taking a deep breath and steeling himself before pushing through the doors to the Great Hall.  Kids clambered about the long tables, some glancing up at him with recognition, while others ignored him completely.  He walked briskly towards the front, debating which side of the staff table to sit at before nervously taking the first open seat next to Flitwick.  The man gave him a polite nod and nothing more.
Lucius had opened his mouth – to unleash more vitriol, no doubt – when Draco felt both of their wands wrenched from their grip.  Narcissa caught them deftly from the air, mouth setting in a hard line as she determined where they should go from there.  Draco cursed that he had forgotten about her – a fact she had unmistakably taken advantage of.
The judge handed it to his mother – and his relief at seeing her reunited was only quelled by the overwhelming fear for himself.
“I’ve been doing some research on Muggle customs, so I can better fit in with your friends.” Draco pulled out a thin pamphlet from between the pages of his copy of
“Goo-gle.  Huh.  Is that the diviner I ask my questions to?”
GEORGE: I don’t know about that, but I do know we’ve had an exciting season so far.  Let’s take a look at the tenuous beginnings, shall we?
Draco forced his gaze back to meet Potter’s, feeling at least equal measures guilt and overwhelming luck.  But Potter’s eyes weren’t on his.
HARRY: [sneaks up behind DRACO and jostles him as he reaches past him for a whisk at his station] Sorry – just needed to borrow something.  [In knocking DRACO, he has just caused the man to spill the entirety of his hot milk mixture into the eggs, and curdling is immediately visible.]
He watched the other men grab their brooms from the sidelines and wandered over, giving them a wide berth.

In the terrible moment that followed, Harry was suddenly very aware that: a) he was currently holding a Malfoy that had apparently

Draco reclined reading a potion recipe book on creating different flavored lubes while Harry scribbled down his illegible lesson plans, close-fisting a crayon. Harry looked up for a moment from his chicken scratch to ask Draco a question.

VOLDEMORT: Let’s just hope it tastes as good as it looks.  [He seems subtly irritated by the grandiosity of the gesture – like the audience will crucify him if he’s too critical of such a romantic enterprise.]
“Spending more time together these days?”
He tried not to think about it, but throughout the day, his thoughts kept circling back to how oddly Potter had acted, and that flush upon his face that must’ve been fever, the more he thought about it.  But even if
Mother’s face came to mind, crestfallen when he would take a meal back to his rooms instead of staying to eat with her.  Fractured whenever he said he was “going for a quick walk,” because it had quickly come to mean “I’ll be gone for the entire day, and possibly even longer.”
, Draco repeated, again, in his mind.  It felt so surreal, like a line fed to him on a stage rather than his own.  “I…don’t know if it’s sunk in yet, to be honest.”
They finished up their safety check within the hour, and he rushed back to his chambers to sleep before the game that would come in the morning.  He knew it wasn’t possible – not tonight, at least – but for a brief moment, he entertained the thought of stopping by Harry’s room on the way.  More than anything, he wanted to see him and continue the kiss from this morning that seemed so long ago already.

was gay, apparently – and no one had even bothered to tell him!
– least of all with his parents, who’d set him on such a self-destructive path.
The following week, Draco found himself once again sneaking into Potter’s classroom in the dead of night for the sake of a prank.  He’d always prided himself on being level-headed, but in situations like these, he had begun to wonder whether that had ever been true at all.  Potter brought out the crazy in him, for sure.
He’d have to hide then—he hadn’t a choice,
He could do this.
TEACHER’S VOICE: [muffled, vaguely familiar] Remember to add your hot milk mix in small doses to the egg – otherwise it’ll cook and turn to scrambled eggs.
”  Draco immobilized it, as the fall had jolted it into reanimation, sending it thumping wetly across the stone floor.  “How?”
Draco was in bliss.  He didn’t think he’d even been wound so tightly before that the conclusion brought such relief.  Eyes squeezed shut, he pumped out the residual climax almost lazily, stopping only when it began to feel more like pain than pleasure.
His students were still getting used to the feel of flying – with the exception of several purebloods and half-bloods who had grown up riding child-size brooms and looped the pitch a bit smugly.  Merlin, it didn’t seem terribly long ago that that had been him.  When he’d arrived at Hogwarts that first year, he’d had almost five years of practice on the most high-end of kids’ brooms; Father had wanted him to be the top seeker after all.
Time was sliding by at a phenomenal rate for days so painstaking, but it all came to a standstill the day the other owl came.  Usually, his mother’s letters were delivered by Persephone – a handsome eagle owl, who had been a sibling to his own.  But this was not Persephone.  This was

to – or, Salazar forbid, that he’d chosen his family over Harry.
Harry nodded a little shakily.  “And what does it mean?  ‘Family of Slytherins?’”  His attempt at humor was lost in the tentativeness of his tone.
– how was I supposed to know that?  I was worrying all week about whether you were serious!”  Which – how ironic, considering his own doubts about Harry just now.

what Harry liked now.  That was a crazier notion than anything he could’ve dreamed.  To know what he looked like, eyes clouded with sheer unrepentant
More than anything, Draco hated discussing his relationship with his father.  Perhaps more than he hated dealing with him, even.  So his response was precursory and terse.  “Oh, just that I’m a horrible son and shouldn’t be mingling with paupers and blood traitors and that I’ve wrought ruin upon the family name, et cetera, et cetera.”  He let his eyes run down Harry’s body with a hint of self-deprecating humor.  “That I’ve debased myself by consorting with you.”
A sudden clap broke the hush that had settled over the room, startling Harry from where he’d been wordlessly staring at Malfoy.  He tore his gaze away to see that it was Ginny.
that Harry was referencing – something so personally
He smiled.  “Well, Marla, the reason I called you here is that I’ve been doing some reading for you.”  He gestured to the stack of books on his desk, ranging from theoretical anthologies to queer coming-of-age paperbacks that he’d mixed in to keep it a shade lighter.  “I think these would all be helpful for you to read, if you’re up to it – this isn’t an assignment, so obviously what you choose is up to you.”
“Well, I-”  He was clearly caught off guard by such directness.  “I’d like to know about your relationship with Mister Potter here.”
Manny passed him a tumbler of firewhisky, which awoke him from his reminiscence and sent him into the fresh moral dilemma of whether it would be more responsible to stop his seventh years from drinking alcohol or to chaperone them when they did it anyway.  He certainly wouldn’t have listened to such stodgy advice when he was slipping firewhisky into the dorms himself.
So shocked was Harry by the guess, that he let his guard down for a fateful moment.  Draco seized the opportunity to pull off a little and loll his head back.  Without thinking, Harry chased the sensation, thrusting forward into Draco’s throat.
“Actually, I…” Harry forced the words out, “I still had it.”  It felt mortifying to admit, and he didn’t meet Malfoy’s eyes for a few beats after saying it.  When he did, the man was staring at him, wide-eyed, not bothering to brush away the bangs that had blown messily across his forehead.
The man shifted a bit to face him.  “Ahh, I see Bagman here hasn’t explained yet.  No surprise there.”  He swirled his drink consideringly before taking a deep sip.  “They’re no-magic games.  No wands, no healing spells, no

Draco – who’d managed to humiliate Harry, prove his inestimable sexual prowess,
“Would you?” Potter asked suddenly, unable or unwilling to read Draco’s urge to run.  “Would you change it if you could?”
“What?” he prompted.
Draco stiffened, remembering the last time he’d seen the man during the Triwizard Tournament all those years ago.  He’d heard rumors of the Bagman’s gambling habit after that, of course – it had been a popular topic amidst his family’s “high society” gatherings at the time, those sharks loving nothing better than stories of indiscretion leading to a fall from grace.  They’d really relished the bits about Bagman being hunted by the goblins (though there had also been that characteristic shudder of distaste when speaking of goblins, of course).

He adjusted his gloves some more when he got out to the field, tightening them angrily to show Potter that he wasn’t forgiven for his slights.  But given the man’s idiocy in the past, he figured he probably didn’t get it.  Draco caught him looking when he threw a leg over his broom though and took off at a higher speed than normal to show that he wasn’t messing around this time.
FRED: Ahh, eloquent as always!  Well, if that’s all, you and Minerva had best be off so we can get down to business.  [He shoos them out the back of the tent, teasing, ‘Begone witch!’ and ‘Begone foul creature!’ at intervals.  The judges take this with begrudging amusement and an awkward lack of haste.]
And Draco – for once, separated from his inhibitions – could only crinkle his eyes and smile.
His eyes snapped to Blaise, who was working dutifully on their potion while Draco sat engaged in not-looking-behind-him-if-it-killed-him.  “I know that,” he hissed, plonking the hair into the pot.  It fizzled like a firework before dousing, releasing a cloud that smelled faintly of almonds.
For a moment, Harry looked suitably horrified that Draco was
“Nothing!” he spat vehemently.  “Nothing…just-”

It was also that, but the muddled intentions regarding it had also sent him into a panic.
So since I've been terrible about upkeeping my regular schedule for this fic, I've decided to do you a solid and post this chapter a week early 😂  (Please don't abandon it - I swear I'm going to finish it on a [somewhat] consistent timeline!)
They nodded, and then all three boarded their brooms and began to rise.  The practice went well – Kat had the natural disposition for a beater, all brazen dives and confident swings, and Marla seemed to be talented in strategic hits where Kat sometimes lacked precision.  Overall, they were both quite good, and, also, quite good
Draco swallowed, endeavoring to press on – if only to get some semblance of perspective on the matter.  “Well, Potter?”  If anything could get to him, it was always a dare.
When everything was in place, he divided the class into six teams, then those teams into four.  There were four segments to the relay race, and each team divvied up the tasks between the people in their group; when that was done, they headed to each of the starting points.

—pulled the man against him into an intimate dancing stance.
VOLDEMORT: Alright, in second place… [he gestures to HARRY’s] this one.  Whose is this?
Draco sighed.  “He said many things to me.”
“No.”
Harry laughed breathlessly.  “Well, I’ve developed a sense for when you’re trying to ruin me.”  His voice was sandpaper now, barely gritting out.
It was clearly an insult about his upbringing, which Draco couldn’t be arsed about at the moment.  “Now, now, Professor Potter,” he quipped, relishing the way Harry once again twitched at the title, “you’ve
Draco arched a brow, his nervousness fading a touch at their comfortable banter.  “I’m sorry to disappoint, but I should tell you up front that I don’t
Another worrying habit Grant had developed was the way his eyes would linger on Draco’s Dark Mark.  The first time he’d seen it, he’d been fascinated, but his interest hadn’t waned quickly, as Draco had hoped it would.  In the times since then, Draco had caught his eyes grazing over it in the mirror and, sometimes, even repositioning his thrusts so that he could see.  Once – and only once – Grant had noticed Draco watching him and leaned down to whisper in his ear, “You and me are the same.”

Draco met her eye.  “Being ‘girly’ isn’t something to be ashamed of.”
Grant thrust up into him, and the shock of pain drove Draco fumbling for purchase against the sink.  He braced himself better for the second thrust, and his eyes found their reflection once again in the mirror.  Flashes of dark hair and green eyes swept fleetingly through his mind, and, forcibly, he banished them.
“No?”  Parkinson’s voice was flat, and now she definitely just looked amused.  “I was unaware that you had such outfits stashed away in your trunk, then.  Too bad we never had any inter-house parties back in the day.”

, you know?  Cakes.  I haven’t studied them nearly as much as some of the other desserts and breads I’ve made… If I’m being quite honest, I’m relieved – I was only trying so hard because my boyfriend’s mum is the ‘baking sweetheart of Great Britain.’  It puts pressure on me to do better, when I’d much rather be spending this time practicing for important things like my medical school exams.  [She purses her lips and thinks.]  Perhaps I’ll drop my extracurricular classes at Hogwarts Culinary after all – it’s not getting me anywhere, clearly, if all my dishes are ‘boring’ and ‘uninspired.’
Though, as he took in the kinds of things actually
Draco reached wordlessly for Harry’s jeans, popping the button and sliding down the fly – a motion that made Harry let out a small hiss as his cock was freed at last.
And that one was just a slap in the face, given what he now knew about Lucius.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry blushed and looked towards the floor. “Thanks.” He sat down, his khakis visibly tighter around his hot salami.
“With what?” he asked, mouth dry.
HARRY: [confessional aside] Well, that went pretty well!  I wasn’t sure about the wild strawberry, so I’m glad they liked it in the end.
He fought to regain his bearings, and then moved to flipping through Morpheus’ memories.  His mind was disorganized, unsurprisingly, but Draco was spiteful enough in that moment to dig patiently until he found something.
Finally, after clunking up the stands to an irrepressibly vivacious chorus, Harry made it to where the 8th years were sitting.  As promised, Ron had sat somewhat near Malfoy – though, their definitions of “near” seemed to differ, as Ron had left room for about half the class between them on the bench.
He woke long before Harry, which was to be expected.  The lovable dolt was sprawled in a frankly ridiculous position with an arm slung casually over Draco’s hip, leaving a handprint of warmth where they touched.  The bed – normally overlarge for him – felt safe and comfortable and warm.  It was the perfect place to rest and think, and Draco had a lot to think about.
Harry picked up his cup again and fidgeted, so Draco waited for him to say the rest.
” Granger cut in, with a glimmer in her eye.  “Why hadn’t I thought of that?  If we were able to create a sort of potion that reverses the effects, then Aurors – and others for that matter – would be able to take it in advance of an interrogation situation if they’re undercover or have some on hand as a defense.  Merlin, the possibilities are endless!”

, I wouldn’t want to show my face.”  The man grinned impishly, seeming to sense Draco’s willingness to play along.  “
Draco gasped, sure his eyes had gone wide as saucers at the admission.
He smiled, stepping in and resting his hand upon Harry’s waist.  The song changed, turning languid and waltz-like as they fell into position.  The man was still stiff as a board – enough so that Draco leaned in and muttered, “Relax.  And

, just acknowledging they had their work cut out for them; however, he decided at the last second that it was best not to argue with his students.

it, so Draco didn’t have the heart to tell him that he’d, in fact, lived it.  After his ill-advised experiment with Pansy, pretty much everyone had known.
Enraptured, DRACO wipes some icing from HARRY’s cheek, and – almost an afterthought – he licks it from his thumb and says, ‘Hey, that’s mine.’  His voice is quiet and full of wonder, and FRED backs away and around the corner before he’s noticed and inevitably ruins the moment.]

Harry began to giggle, “You know that tabloid crap is written by wizards who don’t know the first two things about Muggle life?
“It…” Draco started, quite unsure how to continue.  “It was just supposed to be a prank.”  The words sounded pathetic and inexcusable on his lips.  “We had a second boggart – the one from the cabinet.  I hadn’t really released it, just stored it somewhere else, you know.  So when some Slytherins heard you guys were using a boggart, we came up with this plan where it would seem like it had escaped and everything had gone wrong, because the ‘realness’ would make it scarier.”

Draco saw the moment Harry looked up and noticed his company.  His eyes widened, he paused comically mid-step, frozen by the unexpected scene in front of him.
He filled both his hands with a catalogue of Harry’s flesh, murmuring, “Alright?” as Harry squirmed at the unfamiliar sensations.  The man nodded, and Draco situated them back until they both stretched comfortably down the bed.

One glance told it all.
[HARRY seems frozen by his words – either that, or his proximity – and after a minute of intense eye contact, DRACO releases him without another word and leaves.  HARRY continues to lean against the tent long after he’s gone, saying nothing – eyes distant and considering.]
Once Harry had settled in next to him, Draco took a fortifying breath and decided to get this over with.  “It seems that I will be spending Christmas holidays at the Manor.”  He tried to convey the long-suffering battle he had fought before arriving at this conclusion; he didn’t want Harry to think he

Harry hadn’t improved much in the years since his fateful debut at the Yule Ball (not that Draco had been watching), but he found he didn’t mind.  He’d rather have Harry stumbling into him than return to Hogwarts a master – having learned the ins and outs of dancing with some other partner.
“Alright, let’s see here,” the judge mumbled, flipping through her stack of papers.  “Sentenced to eighteen months, no wands; a check-in will occur at that time to determine the good faith and good behavior of the defendants, et cetera et cetera…”  She looked up at them over her horn-rimmed glasses and raised an unimpressed eyebrow.
Flirting with Harry was so much better now that he knew they were on the same page.  It was effortless – he didn’t even have to
Draco swallowed again and nodded.  “Sure.  Yes.”  He hurried in front of Harry, fighting to wipe the vulnerable hope from his face as he went.  He had to pull himself together.  Sweep Harry off his feet while the going was good.
Harry merely whimpered and made a feeble attempt at a nod, which was halted by Draco’s grip.
“So what are you planning for stag night?” he asked after clearing his throat several times.

Harry came.  He came, bending forward to brace himself against the wall – mouth curled in a silent “o” of surprise; his climax had taken him completely unawares-
“Or?”  Malfoy echoed, once it was clear Harry wasn’t going to continue that sentence on his own.  He raised a daring brow to go along with it.
“I’m sure it was,” Harry assured him.  “My impressions are really good.”  He was clearly attempting to keep the topic light – impossible though it was.
TEACHER: Potter, what are you doing?  Get back to your station.  [His voice is sharp enough here that the audience can recognize it as former contestant SEVERUS SNAPE even without him stepping into frame.]
“How do you feel?” he asked after a moment had gone by.
“What?  You thought you’d spend it prancing around that defiled school of yours with your perverted little consort?”
VOLDEMORT: It does.  I’ve never seen a Star of David made out of rugelach, and now I’m kind of wishing I had.  We have a lot of flavors to try here, so let’s get to it.
Indignant thoughts like these were what filled his head as he decided to up the ante.  Without thinking it out any further, Harry grabbed Malfoy by the front of the jumper and hauled him into a kiss.
“Slytherin, huh?  Fuck.  That simultaneously makes no sense and perfect sense – you always were a sneaky bastard.  And the parseltongue-”

HARRY: So to start, I’m doing a honeyed apple one for Rosh Hashanah.  Then, I’m doing a savory lox and cream cheese one for Yom Kippur, topped with capers.  Next is a lemon and heart of palm one in honor of the etrog and lulav at Sukkot.  Moving along to Purim, I’m planning a sweet poppy seed filling like would traditionally be used in hamantaschen.  For Passover, I’m planning an egg salad filling that incorporates horseradish to represent the meal at the Seder.  And, finally, I’m doing one with freshly-harvested fruit for Shavuot.  I couldn’t find too many wild fruits this time of year, so I’m actually just going to be using some wild strawberries I found along the roadside and seeing what I can throw in to up their flavor.
“Alright, we’re here.  Now what do we do?” Blaise asked, hitting a key on one of the machines.  An eerie blue light filled the box and, squinting, Draco read the word on the screen.

Potter was silent for a long time, and, as such, it was quiet enough for him to hear the man swallowing.  “What did she say?” he asked at last.  Warily, like he didn’t want to give away anything that wasn’t already known and ashamed of whatever was.  His face was doing that brooding thing where his eyebrows drew together and made him look both intimidating and also a bit like a kicked crup.
He landed the fourth hit just below the third, biting his lip when Harry let out a gasping moan.  Unable to help himself, he ran his hand over the reddened flesh, kneading the sensitive skin and watching Harry writhe in sensitivity against the lockers.
Harry thought it over.  “Those actually might’ve been okay – can we put them in the middle?”
“…Ron?”  His voice came out more meekly than he’d intended.
GEORGE: Get set!
Marla kept sneaking these shy little looks in her direction, and Draco felt his previous suspicions strengthening.  When prompted by her friend, the girl stepped forward and struck a victorious pose that would have looked convincing had she not been blushing terribly at the attentions and watching the faux-Gorgon out of the corner of her eye.
– but beyond it, he saw something else too.
He wiped at his eyes somewhat hysterically, a genuine laugh bubbling up amidst the sorrow.  “I’m not your student anymore.”
“I know what a ‘legume’ is, you posh little brat!  Now wait here, while I ask.”
Anyway, people were milling about and greeting him, but not in the struck-silent way they had been for his more dramatic entrances this week; rather, as his classmates nodded in his direction, they did small double-takes and then gave him approving nods, like he’d finally figured something out.  Harry wasn’t quite sure
He would think of something else.
Harry rushed to comply.  Skeins of parchment making up final exams crumpled and ripped beneath his hands.

“I think we need some more rabbit’s heart,” Blaise commented, and Draco rolled his eyes.

Finally, he looked up.  He wheezed in a breath, fingers clenching harder on the fistful of Draco’s shirt.  “But-but the blood!  It won’t stop.”  He inspected his fingers with horror, red slicking them and implying the worst.

In fact, he was so deeply focused on the story being written between his and Harry’s glances that he hardly noticed McGonagall announcing the results of the decoration contest, and it was only the loud cheer from Hufflepuff table that startled him from his overly-invested analysis of the shape of Harry’s ears.
“Shut—”  Harry flew to his feet, only to halt when he realized there was nothing he could really say to that.  After all, it was

He swung open the door and watched the initial shock fall to disgust on Potter’s face.  “Malfoy.  What are you doing here?”  His voice was flat – completely changed from his previous tone – but it was the one he was used to hearing.
Harry pouted a beat.  “I don’t see why you’re making it a big deal – it just makes you lie, yeah?  Can’t be too bad.”

to not bury them in his own self-doubts.
He hadn’t had breakfast yet.  He’d just stared into the flames, watching them sputter and fizzle out as the morning light lengthened.  Through the dark waters of the Black Lake, it never got that bright in his room, only a murky, glowing green.  But having spent seven years living in the dungeons of Hogwarts already, he was quite used to it by now.
Spellbound by that gaze, Draco raised his wrist slowly to his mouth.  He ran the flat of his tongue up his palm, capturing the drop, never looking away.  It tasted sweet and filthy in his mouth, and he let out a hissing breath.
A week before the Halloween Ball, Marla burst into the common room on a shout.  “Everyone - everyone, listen!  They’ve got

He’d dragged Harry to flying class yesterday in order to give him a break, and he’d been looking forward to relaxing together a bit this weekend before Weasley had stuck his head through the Floo at an ungodly hour and whisked Harry away to help with wedding preparations.  All before seven AM on a

Draco flew alongside the boy currently in last, smiling encouragingly when he happened to catch his eye.  The student out front was just reaching the goalposts, where the next wave of players was waiting.  She threw her quaffle through the first hoop with a cheer that quickly turned into a groan where her team member dropped it.
The thought tore him apart inside, because, for the life of him, he couldn’t figure out what he’d done wrong.  He’d replayed their conversation obsessively in his head, each time hoping to discover the exact moment which had set Potter off.  But, each time, he only found himself more confused than the last.
“Both,” Draco admitted.

In the end, it was pathos that won him over.  Not because Morpheus
“But you…you never said!” Harry countered, and the indignation in his voice allowed Draco to relax a fraction.
Harry’s eyes flew open, and then he was coming – coming hard and jerkily over the expanse of Draco’s knuckles.  He crumpled against Draco’s body, face buried in his neck, and Draco held him with the epiphany that this was the first time he’d felt so at peace.
GINNY: It wasn’t going to be done on time, so I figured a healthy brown glow would be better than serving ‘raw dough.’  I know how Voldemort hates that ‘raw dough.’
Since he couldn’t do that, he did the next best thing: embarrass Potter mercilessly.
Harry nodded again, seeming to shake himself out of a daze.  “Right,” he mumbled.  “Otherwise, you wouldn’t be dating

For some reason, he couldn’t get the image out of his head of Potter – the first time he’d tried the Firebolt.  He’d worn such an exhilarated expression then, like it had surprised him into true happiness, and that was, oddly, how Draco felt right now.
Draco mirrored her pose, thinking of his own part in that as a teacher here at Hogwarts.  It all seemed so big and daunting in front of him.  “Indeed we do.”
“Oh, I can pin you against other surfaces too, if you’d like,” Draco quipped and reveled in the shiver it sent through Harry’s body.  They fell back to kissing with fervor, Harry pressing their interlocked fingers into the wall.  It caged Draco within his arms in the most enticing way, and when they drew back for breath, Harry was watching him.
“You like that, Harry?”  he couldn’t help asking, gratified when Harry only managed to bite his lip and nod.  “Fuck,” he repeated, falling back to Harry’s neck with reckless abandon.

.  And why do I have to sit on
Yes, that was it.  He had imagined it all.  Because when – in his right mind – had Harry ever reached out to Draco without reason?  Not in order to save his life or cling blindly to someone in a panic, but just because he genuinely wanted to touch?

“I…” His face burned.  “He’s not talking to me right now, so I was hoping someone else could.”
But Potter seemed pleasantly surprised by that offer, and agreed straight away.

Maybe it had been Draco’s last cheeky comment when Ludo was drawing up his winnings, but the team under the Minister’s financial advisor, Warsnick, was flying relentlessly today.  He’d been jostled away from the snitch on three occasions now – all by players who had drifted significantly from their proper placements on the pitch – and Jameson, their Seeker, had all but kicked him in the face on his last fly-by.
Potter sidestepped the spell easily.
Draco stilled in shock.  “Me?”  He hadn’t meant to say it aloud, but as soon as he did, Slughorn’s eyes narrowed victoriously.
“What else?”  He swallowed with embarrassment at how suddenly desperate he sounded.  “What else did he say?”
okay.  Hey, look at me.
to Harry – at least, not yet.  He needed to let things settle for a while; he needed proof that Harry wouldn’t turn and run.  In the meantime, he could reveal himself in fragments.

“Harry, you’re having a panic attack,” Draco said as he realized it.
She smiled slightly.  “We are – though we’ll get to that.”  She paused, glancing at him seriously.  “But for now, I think it’s time you tell me what is going on.”
His hand twitched towards his wand, and Draco acted instinctively.  He disarmed Potter with a wordless incantation, marveling, as the famed holly wand sung across the grass, just how easy it had been.
“Enough.”

HARRY: Err, I did.  Yeah.
“You got it,” Ron responded, scribbling furiously.  “Next is hair: color, cut?”
Draco drew in a deep breath, squared his shoulders a bit, then ran a hand through his hair before nodding.  “I’m ready,” he said before stepping into the flames.
GEORGE: Well, that was enlightening.  It seems that more is at stake today between those two than a set of perfect biscuits.

Oh yes, he remembered The Plan.  He was already regretting their decision to make one without consulting Hermione first.  Surely the discomfort of confessing all this to her would have been better than what he was dealing with now.

Draco wasted no time, gently grasping him at the base as Harry laid back on the beautiful couch cushion cover Molly Weasley had lovingly knitted for him three years ago.
Harry leaned into their shared grip to take the first step, but Malfoy squared his feet and pressed back like he was fighting off all the horrors of the universe.  “Potter—"
By the time Draco returned to Hogwarts that evening, he was doused in misery and a sense of hopelessness that sounded like his slow steps across the grounds.  Even a year after disowning Draco for being gay, his father still seemed to be in denial that it was true.  He treated Draco’s sexuality as both a choice and a
Grant’s casual expression flickered, revealing something angry underneath.  But he gathered himself and smiled – the gesture not quite reaching his eyes.  “So you’re all set from here, then?  No bruises to heal, no teammates to celebrate with?”  His voice was forcedly light as he added, “No one to thank for keeping you safe all this time?”
Harry scowled spectacularly.  “Yeah, ha ha very creative.  If anything, the fact that you made those buttons proved that back then
“Fuck you, Draco,” he said, but his lips were upturned in a comfortable smile.  Something seemed to cross his mind though, because after a moment the expression flickered.  “Are you sure you’re feeling up to…you know?”
He couldn’t resist.  “It’s a book, Potter.”
“I’m fine,” Harry said, slightly-watery eyes refusing to meet his.
“No,” he reiterated.  “Because…of coming out.  It’s like, I’m just figuring it all out myself, and then suddenly I have to explain it to the world.  The same world where a lot of people aren’t understanding or accepting – especially in Wizarding society.  And I know what I feel, but I don’t have the words to say it; I’m not good at explaining things like Hermione.”
The third teammate would then catch it – like the group currently leading was doing now.  A raincloud immediately coalesced above the holder’s head, and he frowned magnificently before taking off towards the starting point.

Draco entered the rest of the way at her gesture, finding a seat by her desk with a distinct prickle of embarrassment.  “I…er…  Well, it

of?  That you’re toiling away in some Knockturn potions shop, taken advantage of by your supervisor?”
And then, as usual, Potter had to come and muck it up.

I mean, sure, I knew he was struggling, but it wasn’t until the moment the sides were collapsing that I realized I was going to help.

I think it’s important to help people when they need it, even if it’s someone you generally dislike or find infuriating or… [He trails off, cheeks pinkening.  Unsubtly, he clears his throat and tries again.]  Are we good?  For the interview-thing?  It’s just, I’ve got to…
He paused, face twitching at the familiar address so common to another jovial, egotistical man.  Turning, he pasted on a smile.  “Professor Slughorn.  What can I do for you this evening?”
Draco didn’t even try to hide the shock that graced his face.  Surely, he had misheard. The request was so unexpected that he had trouble wrapping his head around it.

Anyway, aren’t you going to show me your dumb haunted house or whatever?”  He shoved his hands in his pockets and scuffed his shoe on the ground in a terrible impression of casualness that made Draco’s grin widen.
Slughorn turned to face him as his hand tugged open the door.  “Yes, my boy?”

“Must be,” Blaise said with a shrug.  “Why don’t you try asking?”

Draco stared into the fading embers of the hearth.  It had been nearly an hour since his mother’s letter had arrived, and yet one distinctive line kept playing in his mind: “I’m sorry, Draco.  I’ve kept your father at bay so far – but this time, it’s just too much.  Come by the Manor as soon as you’re done breakfast.  He wants to talk with you.”
in his general direction, which the man only narrowly dodged.  When he didn’t have the immediate satisfaction of watching leeks sprout from Potter’s ears, he burst out, “You absolute git!  You filled in the entire page with utter nonsense!”
“Never mind.  I’ll get it.”
compared to this – none of the friendly teasing and passion.  None of the rapid staccato of his heartbeat, which stuttered every time Harry glanced up at him with those deep green eyes.  Even his previous orgasms had been understated and
The last bit had been intended as a joke, really – but the effect the order had on Harry was too dramatic to ignore.  His pupils blew wide, and his nails dug into the smooth fabric of Draco’s trousers over his thighs.
A surge of annoyance crossed Harry’s face, but he blew it away with a sigh.  “Yeah, whatever.”  It seemed to diffuse the tension a bit, because Harry moved back over to sit with Draco again.
Even if it was Skeeter, he felt that any external validation on this particular issue could be trusted more than his own hopelessly delusional perspective.  Potter could punch him in the face, and Draco would still be looking for clues of attraction in the act.
DRACO: Thank you.
With a sigh, he decided it was about time to head down to the Sorting feast.  It still felt so strange to be back here as an instructor and not a student.  It hardly seemed like two years had passed since he was here, but at the same time, he couldn’t claim his childhood innocence either.  He just hadn’t expected it to hurt - to know that he could never return to those days lounging about the common room with his friends, a bright and shining future ahead of him.  Nothing would ever be the same.
Malfoy clenched his jaw to keep from snapping back.  He had little patience for the insults, but he had to make this seem like Peeves’ idea for it to work.
Potter’s eyes flicked towards the door, like he still had the opportunity to escape.  Like he had the
“Can I?” Harry asked, gesturing towards his room, and the far-away logic in the back of Draco’s mind agreed that yes, they should do this behind closed doors.  Less chance of Skeeter getting ahold of the inevitably kind rejection.

“With permission?”
The oppressive cloud of prideful retribution seemed to dissipate as they surprisedly, then angrily, cackled under the effects of the charm.  Unbalanced by the sudden compulsion, Draco found himself sprawling to his knees, as he still couldn’t unstick his feet to catch himself.  He clutched a hand to his stomach in alarm, when he realized he could barely breathe for all the laughing.
The mere thought made Draco want to dig his own grave, here and now.
He sat up.  His body felt loose and satisfied in a way that he’d never before felt after sex – and that, more than anything, led him to the realization that it had really happened.
He immediately protested, “I said-”
“We need to talk-” he started, then seemed to realize where exactly they were – namely, one of the gossip mills of the school – before rephrasing.  “You need to

Harry drew back with eyes downturned.  “Yeah, a bit…  What happened?”

“I’m really not the one you should be singing about – honestly.  Everyone will think you’re behind on the rumors.”

Harry’s breathing went somewhat erratic, and their eyes locked in smoldering, consuming tension.  Draco’s hand moved up, higher and higher, before dancing away as he lost his nerve.  His inhibitions were dancing on a knife’s blade, and ultimately it was the ambient restaurant sounds filtering in that revived his sense of propriety.

At that, he promptly shut up because A) they were being too loud – even under a mild silencing charm – and B) he was absolutely mortified.  Which meant, of course, that Harry was going to latch onto it and continue this line of conversation.
“It’s okay,” he continued – frustrated that the man didn’t seem to
That, at least, was true.  Harry could take comfort in Draco carrying his guilt to his grave.
Harry met his eyes for a long moment, seeming – for once – like he was measuring his words carefully.  “I would rather people didn’t make such a big deal out of my life.”
GEORGE: Hiya Draco!  What’s cooking?
“See, this is your problem, Draco – you’re

in the time since then?  Like, before we kissed?”
Cutting off that line of thought, he sought to undo Grant’s Quidditch leathers.  After a moment’s scrambling, however, his hands were pushed away so the man could do it himself, faster.
He swallowed, gathering his thoughts.
Draco sat chained to a chair in the middle of Courtroom 10.  He had been there for nearly three hours, hearing testimony after testimony until he could no longer distinguish words over the swelling guilt.  It rung in his ears like ghostly echoes of malicious voices.  Voices like Aunt Bella’s who told him he was

“Do they?” Draco countered quickly.  “Do they deserve to know every personal detail of someone else’s life?”  He scowled, thinking of Harry the morning after the Ball – hand trembling slightly while holding out that day’s
He couldn’t help it; he laughed.  It was like he was eleven years old again, pointing the wand at Ollivander’s desk lamp and causing it to rise – a spell that had never worked for him under his mother’s wand at that age.  The joy was childlike and infectious, and filled some of the emptiness in him with
He resolved to skip breakfast and do some reading in his room.  Even though he was no longer working with them for his job, Potions was still a subject that drew him, and he’d been rereading the old tome of
“Well, it looks like you were just in it for the pudding.” Draco grinned. “That’s alright, I have a cure for that.” Draco grabbed his wand off the nightstand, aimed it at Harry’s flappy windsock penis and said, “
“Fuck, you’re so beautiful,” he murmured, and Draco thought he might faint at the reverence in Harry’s tone.  It was completely undeserved, and therefore twice as stimulating, and Draco crashed their lips together again – hard at first, then tender.  Harry held him in place against the wall, and he did all he could to squirm closer.
*, I get it already, you can stop filming this travesty.
His focus sharpened, and he thrust hard into Harry, digging his nails into the man’s hips.  He thrust again in the same place when he felt Harry’s walls spasm around him in pleasure.  Harry melted in his arms, taking each of his strokes in stride, riding it out as Draco hit the spot over and over and
Draco’s mind was clear, his feelings sharp and acute.  The jolt that Harry’s glances sent through his body was immediate and reactive, nothing like the hazy touches spiraling through his dreams.  Asleep, he was free from the prisons containing him.  Awake, Harry was helping him push back the bars.
If Potter was simply trying to put the past behind them and become friends, and Draco was taking advantage of that to-…to-
Draco furrowed his brow unhappily.  “Yes…well, my opponent is seasoned and relentless.”  He heaved a drawn-out sigh.  “Fenn tricked me into acting in our ‘house of horrors’ type event.”
Those eyes flittered open, and Draco’s stomach dropped with relief to see the familiar light of defiance burning brightly within them.  It took a moment, but his lip quirked slightly as he responded, “You wish.”
why you’re mad, right?  I know I’m not the pureblooded woman they expected you to be seen with-”
He came in a rush all over his fist.
He met Harry’s confused eyes with a defiant glare until Harry wilted under the pressure.  “Okay,” he said, clearing his throat, “well…well, regardless – I still feel bad about what Sam’s going through, so I hope I can find something to make it better for him.  If that doesn’t offend your
Draco considered it, but, again, it was uncreative.  He was better than that.
Harry continued to cover his face with his arm, though Draco could see the glow of his blazing skin peeking out.  “I mean, not

The second is going to use a traditional dough and be paired with a strawberry-rhubarb filling, topped with candied ginger and bits of gold leaf.  And the final one is going to be a savory one, combining an herby, smoky paprika dough with a thin layer of stilton and jamón ibérico.

“You did it!  See – I told you!”
When he finally was down to the hilt, Harry moaned loudly with pleasure. As Draco pumped slowly and powerfully from behind, he reached around to stroke Harry’s cock. On all fours, Harry couldn’t hold it back any longer. He came all over the bed, tightening his sphincter around Draco’s smooth cock. The tightness made Draco cum, shooting load after load into Harry’s hole. Draco pulled out, aimed his wand at the mess and said, “

Being as busy as it was, the last week of the semester absolutely flew by, and then there was only the Quidditch match before everyone went home for the holidays.  Draco had made some headway on his potion this morning, and he was almost convinced that he’d gotten it right this time – all he had to do was test it sometime after the game.
But Draco endured, gazing long and hard at the wide pupils and flash of color upon Harry’s cheeks.  That kind of lust was not a trifle to simply fade away.

Things were…peaceful, in a strange and unexpected way.  And in the better moments, Draco could just let his head fall back on the emerald velvet of his chair and enjoy the thousand tiny details that made his life so much better than it had ever been before.  The things he wouldn’t let himself take for granted.
He watched Potter’s breath catch, and it was the single hottest thing he had ever seen.

He was in the middle of notating a tome of “Complicated Potions for the Adventurous Brewer” by Eloise Haverton – a much more modern compilation, with much more practical prose – when he heard a crisp, polite knock at the door.  Even without knowing whom to expect, Draco’s heart skipped a beat at the sound.

“Ahh, but you and Professor Potter have a history unlike any of the other staff-”
Mourning the loss of touch already, Draco straightened his back for the unavoidable conversation to come.  Seeming to notice his hand for the first time, Harry released his shirt quickly, shuffling backwards on the desk with a blush.
. The pamphlet read “Muggle Magazine” in massive letters on the front.
Draco decided that Potter must truly be ill.
Sam’s eyes fell on Draco, who raised a brow.  “I won’t tell, if you don’t.”  It seemed a fair trade, as everyone loved to gossip about Harry – and him – it seemed.
Sick to the bone, he sat and listened as his Father eviscerated him over seven courses of meal.
He looked so painfully awkward about it too – to the point Draco couldn’t help but grin as the man lost his proverbial footing.  It was strangely satisfying that, with a few choice words, he could so easily offset someone who had been about to beat his arse in a duel.  It was exhilarating – but also deeply confusing.  Potter was back to acting the way he had been with Draco before everything went south, but

that he’d made the cardinal mistake of believing that Potter felt the same way he did.  That – even if he didn’t nurse dangerous feelings in his heart like Draco – Potter still wanted him as some sort of constant presence in his life.

“And what do you feel?” Draco asked, heart rate spiking – in anticipation or empathy, he couldn’t tell.
And, by Merlin, they would have to.

Harry seemed encouraged by the fact Draco hadn’t hexed him yet.  “And then,” he continued, “he’d prod them disdainfully with his cane and set them on fire or something, then order his house elves to purify the spot the package touched, so it didn’t ‘taint the Manor with poverty’ or whatever!”  He wrapped his fingers around Draco’s biceps, grounding himself in his hilarity.
Harry caught the glances of his friends and stiffened further, setting his jaw in a way that meant he couldn’t believe Draco was doing this in front of company.  Draco, however, had no qualms about fight-flirting with Harry in public – in fact, there was little he took pleasure in more.

“And I hate Draco Malfoy, but that apparently hasn’t stopped you.”  He said it with a laugh and picked up his drink again, swirling it lightly before taking a swig.
Thanks again to
.” The description was so astonishing – coming from Harry of all people – that he took another second to blink in confusion.  “Not in a bad way!” Harry assured, misinterpreting his silence.
“There could have been important news in those letters.”
Thank you to anyone who's still with me!  Hope y'all are doing well!
The man looked fidgety and altogether out of his element.
Encouraged by this, Harry began to rock against him.  Draco’s momentary lull subsided.

He slipped out of bed, pulling on some trousers, a shirt, and a soft, cashmere jumper.  He was in the process of buckling his belt when he noticed the outline of an owl perched imperiously by the window.

The familiar spell caught him off guard, and then he was flipping through the air and hitting the wall with a crunch.  It scratched at his itch.
“Cut is good, color not so much.”  He ran a hand through his new cut, marveling at how the pink had faded miraculously overnight – it was black and curly again, with only the slightest wisp of pink in his bangs.  It reminded him of the days when Vernon would shave off all his hair, and it would come back longer and messier the next day.  Though, today, it had kept the cut – which he felt must mean something.

from his mind in order to focus on keeping his students in the air.  Several had choppy starts, and he had to help a few of the boys with lift-off and encourage one of the meeker girls to float higher than two feet off the ground.  There were always a few in each class that couldn’t handle heights.
Regardless of recent anger towards the man, he nearly sagged with relief.  He was far too strangled with noise to make words of his own.  If the Golden Boy could convince Flitwick to end it… He only

Narcissa sighed, losing some of her poise.  “Very well.  While it is true that your father removed you from his will, and therefore, the Malfoy inheritance…that may not be the case forever.”

“You’re distracting,” he grumbled, finishing his laces with a snap.
“Quite right,” Draco agreed, surprised despite himself.  Was he really agreeing with
He glanced up at Harry’s face, suddenly wanting to see the expression there, and he felt the man’s breath stutter when he did.  “Draco, I…” His voice was thick, wanting.
McGonagall merely raised a brow and ignored the obvious implications.  “I’m afraid not, Harry.  The first game of the season is tomorrow – as I’m sure you’re well aware.”
MINERVA: …and such, simply a wonderful bake!  Extravagant.  You should be proud to propose with that piece.
She released his arm, and he departed without another word.
The impact was a blur of green and scratches.  When the dizziness faded, he pushed himself up into a sitting position, eyes focusing blearily on Potter as he landed gracefully to his right.
”  Which – although funny – was not quite the reaction he’d hoped for in setting out.
, and it was always a downward spiral from there.  There were so many nightmares so eager to crawl across his skin.  Best to leave bad memories alone.
But could the younger kids handle a literal horror-house?  Thinking back on himself at age eleven, Draco knew he would’ve hated it.  Unless some cool, older student had managed to talk him into it…like Fenn was in the process of doing now.
“Harry, are you alright?  What’re you
Draco was so startled by the civil contribution that he took a moment to gather himself again when Granger asked for an in-depth breakdown of the ingredients he’d been testing.  Once he was in it though, he found he couldn’t stop, and they discussed both his

Draco felt a delirious grin stretch across his face.  “

– and the thought never failed to startle him.  It seemed already a lifetime since he’d left the school a battleground.
should be used to it though, after losing so much.”
But before Draco could do something self-destructive like make fun of Harry for it, he felt the other man pulling his hand from his face.  Harry gripped Draco’s hand between his palms like he was warming it, and it felt so nice that he twisted and interlaced their fingers together.  It felt a bit like his lungs had expanded and made his chest overfull.
Draco clenched his jaw to hold back a pitiful groan.  He rocked Harry’s head gently up and down, amazed at the way Harry simply let him.  Like he

Yes – but nothing ever came for free.
Harry looked to Draco apprehensively.  He didn’t look
“I’m sorry,” Harry repeated, face falling from its easy radiance to a rather dour disposition.
He took another swig of drink, catching Gloria’s eyes flicking nervously towards him, and he interpreted it as another part of her unspoken mothering.  About which he was grateful, but also a little heartbroken, since one disappointed mother seemed rather enough.
If Draco hadn’t been emboldened by his regained ownership of his wand, he might have fallen back and played more defensively.  But the way things stood, he was fed up – and in a rare position of being able to
Draco slid his fingers out of Harry in a rush, fumbling to undo his belt – which had remained neatly buckled until now.  He tugged open the fly and released his cock with a groan he couldn’t stop in time.  He was past caring.
“I… Thank you, Headmistress.  I’m sure I don’t deserve the praise.”
“I know right! Barf me out!” Draco gave a proud smirk.
“Er,” panic began to set in as Draco realized the enormity of the commitment he’d just agreed to, “what are the responsibilities, then?”
Draco blinked, pausing in the doorway.  “I…what?  He didn’t show up to teach his classes?”
He snatched it down with disbelief.
Oh, he’d already been enamored by the first time Potter had cast this on him.
VOLDEMORT: Well, good luck with that, mate.
“Was that okay?” Harry asked.  Then, he immediately blushed, like he hadn’t quite meant to divulge his self-consciousness.
“They were really flashy and pretentious!” he protested.  “So I asked around the dorm

was only a “Mister” rankled a bit.  Besides, he was young, and most of the kids seemed to appreciate the loosened formality.  (In contrast with professors like McGonagall, he wasn’t that surprised.)
Draco stared at him blankly for a moment before realizing he could think of nothing more to say.  “Er, good night?”
Draco’s pulse flurried in his chest, and he needed to think of something,
*ing lovely.  Malfoy, you *

to know it was a tense topic.
t/w: PTSD; panic attacks; fake blood
“Well, I sort of suspected-” he stammered, “I mean, there were rumors about why you were suddenly avoiding everyone-”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut and tried to stem the tidal wave of frustration from pouring out his mouth.
He let the man bask in it for a moment before issuing his next command.  “On your knees, Potter.”
“Well, well, well.  Look who dropped everything to come visit me.  If I had keeled over yesterday, you certainly would’ve been the last to know.”  His smirk was a cruel slash across his wasted face.  Draco searched it, looking for change – looking for any sign that would confirm or deny his mother’s words.
“Okay, let’s just cut to the chase.  I’m going to give you one drop of
“-I just want to make sure you’re getting along.”  She smiled, beatifically.  “It would be a shame for you to start quarrels with a coworker in your first year of teaching.”
Harry watched him thoughtfully as Draco tucked the corked vials back into his pocket.  After a moment’s silence, he burst out, “It’s not like I like your hands or anything.”
The boy jumped with the broom in his grip several times, eyes squeezed shut in concentration, but couldn’t seem to stay up.
t/w: tense family situations
“Aren’t you?”  This time, Harry broke off for a groan, as Draco licked at the shell of his ear.  The sound made something dark and hungry rear within him.  “You’re plotting my demise,” Harry hissed.

He was so focused on his dread, body stiff with tension, that he didn’t notice the next witness until the judge announced him.  “The next witness in the trial of Draco Lucius Malfoy, accused on account of treachery and known involvement with Death Eaters, is one Harry James Potter, former classmate of the defendant.”
He hesitated.  “Can you just…y’know?”  It was shameful how pitiful he sounded.
He looked…really queer and
Draco sidestepped it automatically.  “Really?  The jelly-legs jinx?”  His smugness was completely automatic, but it caused the pleasant side effect of Potter scowling fiercely and casting a quick disarming spell in succession – which he dodged as well.  “Surely you can do better.”
“Mainly writing and visiting more often…and not provoking Father on purpose.  Don’t worry,” he added, because Harry was still looking worried, “if it wasn’t clear before, I’m still not breaking up with you.”  He tossed it in there teasingly, and was therefore startled when Harry froze completely.
Draco didn’t speak until he’d stalked up to face Potter.  He stopped several feet away, eyes darting to Flitwick for a moment before resuming harsh eye contact with the Savior.  “This is dueling club, correct?”  He didn’t give the man a chance to answer.  “I’m here to duel.  With Potter.”
Draco released Harry’s shirt with a shove, laughing – despite himself – then masking it with a hand to his mouth.  “You quarrelsome

“Okay, okay.  Hold up,” Draco said, examining the broom with a frown.  “Is this a Cleansweep Five?”

He had come to tell him off for not minding his own business – or

Her body was tense, but he also saw a flicker of emotion run through it.  “I…wow.  Thank you so much.  I… It was never the right time to look for myself.  There were always people around, and…”
“Yes, Miss Granger?” The Head Girl replied. Her voice was really mellow and pleasant.
Well, the two looked young, but... “Are they immortals?” Harry joked.
Cold fury was ablaze in his grey eyes, his gaze so frosty it seemed if he could cause Nott’s limbs to drop off from frostbite with a look, he would.
WARNING: This chapter has some references to Harry/Ginny intimacy. They are not graphic, but please be warned.
Something stung under Harry’s ribcage.
To minimise travelling by portkey for Malfoy, it had been decided that he would ride a carriage back home. Flown by thestrals, it would take less than a day’s travel. Harry only planned to accompany him till they passed the nearest mansion of a noble from the liberal faction, who could lend him their floo without raising an eyebrow at the fact that Malfoy and he were travelling separately.
“Sure,” Harry smiled wanly. “Thank you, everyone,” he said as he dismissed them.
“The most beautiful Cor Lapis and Noctilucous Jade I’ve seen, right? No worries, I’ll bring them to you by tomorrow,” Zabini responded timely like clockwork, his mind in tune with his former classmates’. “If you’ll excuse me,” he departed from the hall then, headed for the closest apparition point it seems.
Harry was surprised when Hermione forced her way into his carriage, where his blonde fiance was also seated, dabbing at his red eyes with his handkerchief.
And that was how the Kingdom of Petra came to legalise a Second Consort for the King.
A/N: Coming next: An Interlude - a day in the life of Draco Malfoy
The hallways were filled to the brim by beautiful and exotic decorations, from things that hung on the walls and ceilings, like tapestries and lanterns, to items that could be placed on the floor or tables. The rugs, the vases, even tablecloths - they all looked luxurious and exquisitely designed. Gold lacquer and embroideries gleamed everywhere, depicting various motifs of dragons and phoenixes. It was hard to believe that the occupants of this mansion only recently moved in. It was like a hoarder’s paradise.
Thank you so much, Lyra for helping me brainstorm and all the ideas and information you shared!
“Mahoutokoro,” Hermione corrected reflexively as she squinted at two robes in her hands, murmuring, “What’s the climate like in Minami Iwo Jima?”
Harry pressed his fists to his eyes. His headache was killing him.
“Not quite…” Harry went along with his best friend’s antics. She wasn’t wrong either. “How about you?”
“Scent of Spring’s Three poignant perfumes? It’s been so long…” Black-gloved hands handled the crystal bottles carefully. Zhongli’s smile was nostalgic, and wistful. “Thank you so much, little dragon…”
“Harry,” hands searched his face, touching all over, “you won’t give your heart to anyone else, won’t you?” Her eyes were bright in the dimly lit air, candle flames flickering in the background.
[1] ‘Petra’ and ‘Kasha’ are from the manga ‘The Biography of Queen Bertha’. It’s an interesting manga about a royal family reigning over a divided kingdom - the reigning Aryan foreign invaders and the natives. There are also some blood supremacy issues. I have thought of this fanfic’s plot line LONG ago but reading the manga made me want to write this.
Zabini stood quietly at the sideline with a smile on his own face, like he was glad his previous Housemates reconciled and he didn’t just pour oil into the fire a few minutes ago. After the two blondes stepped back and recomposed themselves, the handsome wizard clapped his hands. “Now, who’s up for some breakfast? I have some blueberry scones."
“Your Majesty, House Li has a purpose for making the commitment to join with House Malfoy. It’s really hard for us to accept the turn of events…” the Han aristocrat spoke boldly.
Shacklebolt hummed in thought. “Lady Granger isn’t wrong.”
Harry opened his mouth. “What-”
Harry squeezed his eyes tightly and clenched his fists.
Two students, a pretty girl with long black hair and lovely fair skin and a lean, slightly tanned boy with wild dark brown hair stepped up to her. “These are my Head Girl and my Head Boy, Miss Daidouji Tomoyo, and Mr-”
For once, he wasn’t thinking of Petra.
bottle, yes. Then we took a Yquem back up to my rooms.”
“But I didn’t realise that. And between him and Hermione, I just left, you know? I just left, and I didn’t come back. And that made everything worse.”
“What, you didn’t know?” he chuckles bitterly again. Harry hates the sound: raw and unhappy.
Malfoy is sitting on a bed, stacking text books neatly into a pile. If he notices Harry, he doesn’t acknowledge it.
Elsa gives him a curious look but doesn’t question him any further. “Well, I’m glad you’re back. Those dusty old English wizards don’t deserve you.” She gestures at the waitress for a coffee refill.
When Harry gets home, he douses the fire and warms the rooms with charms instead. Draco knocks at the door just as he’s piling leftover turkey and gravy into two massive sandwiches.
off to prison, so he and his partner are holed up in the front room buried in the Floo. Pans went back to bed, I think. She seems wildly out of sorts about something.” Zabini winks theatrically. “
“Cissa’s seen the very best doctors. None of them have been able to help. I know that Draco is convinced that what ails her isn’t natural. That someone has done this to her, whether as retribution for the past or because she’s kept herself out of anything unseemly that’s going on now.”
It’s supposed to be spring, but halfway through April the sun’s yet to make an appearance. Grey days stretch endlessly into one another, pressing a cold sky over a damp, miserable London.
He pushes open the front door and is even more surprised at what he finds inside. The broken furniture stacked in a neat pile in the centre of the front room. The damp, rotten carpets rolled back to the walls, exposing flawless, polished floors. Where wallpaper peeled and sagged the last time he was here, there’s now plain white-washed wood. Someone is
“Do you think she forgot?” Luna asks serenely, which forces a laugh out of Harry.
Ron gives him a strange look. “Is that what we’re calling it?”
Harry wants to grab him and give him a shake. To force him to speak out of only one side of his mouth for a change.
“Of course it happened,” an annoyed sounding voice rings out from the hallway. “Kreacher cleaned enough glasses afterwards to know for sure.”
Padma’s eyebrows are at her hairline when he rushes into their office, trailing his scarf and his untied bootlaces behind him.
“It was you,” Draco murmurs.
“I wanted to help, at the trials,” Harry says in a low voice. “And I … couldn’t.”
Last weekend Luna had helped him banish the old furniture and pick out a deep, comfy corner sofa and matching armchair in a soft cream fabric. They’d laid down a bright new rug, and he’d had floo elves come to clean all the fireplaces. Each room he works in feels like his favourite. Last week it had been the kitchen, with the heavy wooden table and benches sanded and restained.
“Gin...” This was too much. Was she aware that they had an audience? Was that why she responded this way? What did she expect him to reply? “We are Petra’s King and Queen. We don’t just belong to ourselves…”
The King was about to discuss other terms and conditions of the marriage, when Li cleared his throat.
“Horace, do I look stupid to you?” Harry let some of his temper and magical powers show. He’d been told that he was so powerful, his magic shimmered around him like hot steam when he was truly angry. The King wasn’t really angry now, but it was a useful intimidation tool. “Are you secretly one of those people who lament the end of the Ravenclaw’s and Hufflepuff’s lines?”
Harry knew it; she was questioning why he didn’t come back earlier. Her approach had gotten softer, though. Less accusatory.
The blonde only appeared more ill at the mention of food.
Ginny would have given him the cold shoulder for weeks.
Harry blanched. “All the more this proposition has no merit for him,”  he began to pace around the room. The King paled when he remembered about Draco’s mother. “Narcissa Malfoy… I owed her a Life Debt, too. She demanded that I pardoned House Malfoy…”
It was Harry’s turn to wonder,
It seemed fishy, but Hermione was excited, nevertheless. “Thank you, Lord Malfoy. I’ll be sure to join.”
Ron had, with flaming cheeks, told Harry that Harry had his blessing to ‘move his relationship with Ginny forward’, before fleeing the Burrow with the excuse of helping George in the shop.
Harry twitched as the platinum blonde dropped to one knee and presented himself to the monarch in his court. The choker that marked him as carrying a child was too conspicuous. What an eyesore.
“Oh,” Draco could only respond with. He was strangely breathless.
[2] Xiao Long means little dragon. Syaoran means little wolf, and Draco means dragon… so that’s their endearment for each other.
“Gin!” Harry quickly shot a spell to slow down her descent and cushion her fall. The Queen had fainted.
NOTE: Those who want to skip Harry/Ginny, don't read this section.
Harry peered at Hermione’s easy smile.
Harry shook his head in disbelief inwardly. Still, he tried to reason. “Can’t this visit wait…?”
“They are lotus seeds,” Zhongli answered Hermione’s musings indulgently. “They have plenty of health benefits, for the heart and digestion. They help manage the disease of too much sugar in your blood. Rumour has it they also have anti-aging effects.”
Zhongli laughed. “Well… I do eat a lot of lotus seeds in my diet.”
“Your Majesty,” the blonde nodded his acquiescence.
Malfoy only continued to smile. “The care of Glaze Lilies can be quite fascinating.”
Ginny smiled wanly, before she crossed her arms and huffed. “That’s what you get for travelling in a carriage for one whole day!” She stuck her tongue out to let him know she was joking. “Let’s sleep, then!” She lifted the blanket and patted the mattress.
2) Help, I have fallen into Genshin fever!!
He sounded convincing enough, but Harry didn’t give up.
The blonde just wanted everything to be perfect for this visit to this important person.
The letter it carried was subjected to a variety of spells to test for curses and hexes, before it was declared safe and handed to the male monarch.
Malfoy removed the handkerchief from his face and gave Harry a weird look. “It’s my job, isn’t it?”
Blaise’s smirk widened. “I just know that sticking around you will be more interesting.”
“I can still be your fiance while I’m carrying the child, Your Majesty. The pureblood faction will understand the importance of properly ending a betrothal, while still maintaining good relationships between the Houses.”
‘Hey, I brought you breakfast to thank you...’
Harry’s eyes flashed. “Are you saying it’s not a goal worth pursuing?”
A part of Harry felt pleased that Malfoy finally learned his place and lost his arrogance, but at the same time, Harry just felt tired. They were all just boys, caught in the adults’ war. Malfoy seemed to have suffered enough, detained in Azkaban throughout summer before his trials were finalised. Many might have resented that the Malfoys escaped sentences in Azkaban, and Lucius was cowardly for trading his freedom with that of his former comrades, but by doing so the man had made enough enemies to watch his back his entire life. It was a punishment in itself.
Tartaglia met his stare coldly, his eyes looking down as though saying, ‘Go on.’
“A very useful alliance came out of it,” Harry opted for another vague honesty.
Really, it wasn’t like
As they continued to eat, Zhongli noticed Hermione eying the huge kite hung on the wall. It was bird-shaped and made of colourful silk, not the usual paper. “There are many debates about the origins of kites,” he started conversationally. Whenever he spoke, he always held the ladies’ rapt attention. Harry understood why; the man was just so knowledgeable. He was like a walking encyclopedia with a soothing deep voice. “However, there was a common folklore from the southern continents…”
“So will you tell me what you sold my friendship for, Malfoy?”
Hermione didn’t let herself be deflected. “It’s true, but that’s not my point,” the witch was a capable negotiator, always determined and logical in her persuasions.
Are they close enough to be
Harry let his Scribe write an ordinary letter for Marcus Flint, not that much different from the letter he’d sent to the parents of pureblood daughters.
“Yes, but…” Harry didn’t expect Malfoy would willingly brave an encounter with the former Eleventh Harbinger of the Fatui, a soldier infamous for his hitcount, just for the sake of ‘his job’. Being in the presence of Tartaglia’s murderous intention was akin to having sharp blades pressed to the skin of one’s neck. The man was as volatile as an unstable Blasting curse.
“Rise,” Harry remarked indifferently before Malfoy could say anything. He didn’t want the blonde to be too lenient. Nott was one of Malfoy’s closest friends in Hogwarts. Not lackeys like Goyle or the late Crabbe, but a real friend. “Say what you have come to say.”
Malfoy nodded. “Thank you.”
Harry frowned.
Harry waved it off with a dismissive gesture. He had always preferred honesty to fake pleasantries.
“I just had dinner a couple of hours ago,” McGonagall declined. She gestured at the Hogwarts students. “They’re yours.”
Coming from another person, Zabini might have found the question so rude and intrusive, but Zabini only laughed at his childhood friend. “Thankfully, not for the moment, no,” the handsome wizard shuddered.
A beat passed in silence. “That, I did,” the Japanese witch agreed, and ended the topic. “Would you like to take a rest? Breakfast will be served soon.”
It was…a shocking sight.
Harry hung his head and looked down at the floor resolutely. He only stood and listened as the sound of several pairs of footsteps filled the air, followed by a loud bang of the doors closing.
Idk why I write Geo Daddy Zhong like he's Luna Lovegood. Knowledgeable on most things but also an airheaded himbo. Is my impression of him correct? haha...
“We understand that Petra had gone through much turmoil in the past few decades, and indeed Kasha was eager to reinstate trade between the two Kingdoms…” The past tense made Harry wince inwardly.
The elderly matron of Hogwarts’ Hospital Wing looked unflappable as she ran diagnostic spells on his unconscious wife. Harry’s heart was in his throat throughout. He’d lost too many people in the war, he can’t-
