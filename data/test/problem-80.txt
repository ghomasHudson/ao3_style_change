“Why can't you just let me do this!” The plumbing underfoot creaks and sighs under the sudden movement.
Harry was dumbfounded. He had no idea what to say. He folded his arms, arched a brow, and waited to hear whatever Malfoy was trying to say.
“Of course I have, old man. It’s almost sad to see you so defenseless,” She simpers, walking behind Malfoy and heckling into his ear with that wheezing voice of her’s.
than he ever would have expected. The intensity between them was overwhelming. The pressure of his hard cock pressing against his pants was making him light-headed. He rocked his hips against Potter’s experimentally, and the man gasped in surprise, eyes flying open. Draco kissed him almost playfully, smiling at his response.
Ron screams in rage. He grabs a nearby chair and smashes it over the wizard’s head. The man's grip loosens and he wobbles before crashing to the floor. Malfoy, his face an odd sort of red-purple, grips his red throat as it already begins to bruise.
“Hogwarts isn't going to be the same and we all know it. Why is that everyone insists of feigning normalcy? I mean, they're throwing a  sodding wedding, for Merlin’s sake.”
My thoughts are interrupted by a chattering one flight down. I stand on the top stair, my back goes stiff. An old man- the Minister- sits with his back to the staircase facing Potter, who’s sitting between Granger and Weasley on an old sofa in front of the window to the back yard. His bodily expression is emotionless as he speaks.
I spend what feels like an hour laying there, my heart beating erratically, and trying to catch my breath, trying to remember a time when I had someone to go to afterms an episode. The images that play behind my eyelids are horrid beyond explanation.
"Very good.” Severus inclined his head. "But I am not here to catch up. I need a wand for my son. He will be starting Hogwarts this year and cannot keep using the hand-me down that I provided him with.” Shadow had to have a wand to check at the Ministry tomorrow, and it could not be Harry Potter's wand.
Severus backed away silently. He had left Draco and Marissa in a warded room near the Infirmary with Poppy. He had returned to make sure Shadow was not upset with being left alone while Salazar again examined his mind. (They hadn't wanted Minerva to become aware of Shadow’s presence in the school, so they thought it best for Shadow to stay in the Chamber.)
He moved toward the window and sniffed at the night, trying to determine how far away the predators were. Yes. More than one, a dozen or more, but miles away. This was their hunting area. He tilted his head, the Black shadows writhing in thought behind him, his wings ruffling with his agitation. He liked this nest, but he'd prefer empty hunting ground, his own territory.
Malfoy is trembling, his figure slumped up against the wall as tears flow down his sallow cheeks; he whimpers to himself, “I killed him,
“What did you do to that thing?” Weasley stares dumbfounded, but Granger spares barely a second to explain the expansion charm. After a moment she pulls out stacks of old clothing: pants, sweatshirts, even tennis shoes.
I want to push down the heat curling inside of me for them. I need to protect them. I can't have them waltz out on a foolhearted mission with me. I can't let emotion rule my life. I don't even know where I'm going. I have no leads.
At my side Granger absently flips through a moth eaten journal she's found in a chest. “Looks like he wanted to be a death eater. Why would
Potter rocked his hips up into Draco’s, biting his lip simultaneously. Draco was momentarily stunned by his movement, and Potter brought his hands to Draco’s hips, gripping them firmly. He rocked against Draco again, harder, panting.
’s apology and start over. Draco’s words had surprised him, and he looked forward to finding out what other surprises lay in store for him with this strangely formal boy.
Where's the next part, the rest of the letter? I turn it over several times again just to be sure, but it's blank, the ink bleeding through slightly. My fingernails scratch at the wooden drawer as if it's hiding something. I drop the letter and open the envelope, hoping for the second half. Instead I find a photograph. In it a small child with dark brown hair whizzes past on a small broom, a large pair of feet running past in succession. It's me. I’m at Godric’s Hallow with Mom and Dad on my birthday. This was likely taken not too long before they were killed.
“Obliviate them. And work quickly.” Hermione says as she fixes to stand, holding a hand to her face. “If they found us it means they followed my Trace. They could send more.”
Malfoy looks thoughtful and wraps the blanket around him. For a moment I allow myself to ignore him and who he is and everything he's done.
“I have my wand pointed at your chest and you’re trying to convince me to switch loyalties? My loyalty is to Voldemort!”
wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”
I bypass them completely, climbing farther up the stairs to the next floor. The doors have all been left open, except three one at the end of the hall. As I walk towards them I see several bedrooms and bathrooms, even the room Ron and I shared when we last stayed here. Memories rush to the forefront of my mind; life was comparably easy then, I was so naive. I remember wanting to know, wanting to fight. It feels more like an obligation now.
“I hope not. And, if they don't already, they're not going to,” I squeeze Ginny’s shoulder in a way that I hope is reassuring. “I promise.”
Ever since meeting Harry at Madam Malkin’s he had been intrigued by this strange boy who didn’t seem to fit his muggle appearance. Now he just might get to learn why.
Maybe I could have not joined the death eater's ranks then, but how was I to know that Voldemort was batshit crazy? His old, wise ideas that he used to preach of keeping magic in pureblooded families, of separating our world from those meddlesome, violent muggles and mudbloods- he never lived up to those. He got caught up in the allure that is immortality and set his efforts completely on murdering a teenaged boy and overthrowing the ministry. That'd be no help.
He stares at me a moment, head cocked to the side and pupils dilating as if he's just discovered the secrets of the universe, “Harry move back.”
“Hermione!” I turn, startled, as Potter shouts this, and press my back to the door. In a minute Weasley and Granger are up the stairs at the end of the hall.
him to get information, and we certainly can't defeat You-know-who on our own. We don't even know where to start! We know nothing!” She stares at me, imploring.
Behind it we sit for not even a moment to catch our breaths – no, to get a feel of reality. Ron raises himself above the counter sporadically to throw curses at our enemies.
I feel as if the world is turned against me, it's entire weight falling on my shoulders, and everyone I love is toeing the line between life and death because of me.
Draco looked over at Potter and excitement lit a spark in his belly. The room was illuminated by the glow of several large fireplaces in the back wall of the room, and Potter’s face almost glowed in the soft firelight. His face showed surprise, his mouth slightly open as he stared at Theo.
“Back up! All of you!” The field surrounding the Burrow is barren and empty but for the few of us. No one takes the first step forward.
Relief threatened to overwhelm Draco. Shaking slightly, he took the boy’s warm, callused hand. He looked down at it in surprise. He had never felt a hand so rough - he would have to find out how it had gotten this way.
“You know that’s not what I meant, Ginny. It’s just… he knows things, okay? Stuff about You-Know-Who that no one else on our side knows. Things that will help us find him. We need all the help we can get.”
you? Unlikely.” He swallowed, but tried to distract from the movement by reaching a hand up and swiping the hair from in front of his eyes.
My skin itches and I strongly desire to throw a curse. I focus my mind on breaking free off this spell, but to no avail. My blood boils just
His chin quivering, much like his son, Lucius whispers, “My Lord,” and blood bubbles out of his mouth. “I will find him, and after he leads us to the Potter boy I shall take great pleasure in punishing him.”
I can't stop my heart from beating out my chest again out of fear and, as it falls open, both sides sliced down the middle. Truth be told I'm expecting something more exciting, and the slip of paper that falls out is a bit more that anticlimactic.
, I think. I miss the comforting feel of my best friends’ arms wrapped around me as I try to block out the world. That oppressive silence, that uncooperative stubbornness-
Molly nods, still not looking at Ron, Hermione, or I, and the group disperses into the Burrow. I turn my back to them, kneeling next to Malfoy’s limp body. Charlie whispers, “I hope you know what you're doing.
“And how –” I rise to throw a curse at the same time as Hermione, “am I supposed to trust that you won’t curse us dead!?”
I run my wand over the ropes around Malfoy’s upper arms, charming them tighter and stronger until I can see the skin bruising under their clutch, blood spilling from small etches and cuts above his elbow. Malfoy long ago passed out from exhaustion, but I won't give him the benefit of the doubt. I've seen what he can do, what he's done.
I search his eyes for anything that could set me off track. He looks too earnest, to willing, too broken.
Molly Weasley’s brows are knit into one as she stares out from the greying picket fence, every bit of her countenance expressing perplexity. Ginny looks as though she can't believe her eyes even as she just watched us land from the sky like a pair of fallen angels. She runs out to us, stopped only by Molly’s arm and she leads forward hesitantly, the Burrow a blurry shadow behind them.
The streets of Hogsmeade are entirely empty, there’s not a soul to be seen. There are only blacked-out buildings, bathed in an ominous green light.
Potter’s breathing grew ragged and Draco realized it matched his own. Draco was floored. The kiss was intoxicating. He felt as though all his senses were blinded with the intensity of it. He had yearned for this for so long, and fought it away, that he was overcome as all those years of pining surged to the surface. He tightened his hold on Potter, subconsciously possessive, wanting and needing more.
Tonks herself limps forward, a hand held to the cut running down the side of her eye, “We landed and ran into a little pub and apparated from there, all the brooms left behind and… Mad Eye.”
I jump up and clutch her by the arm, “We can't tell them about this,” I desperately insist. Hermione pulls out of my grasp.
It’s almost looks like Malfoy is about to drop his wand, his arm lowering and the wand to the floor, when the door bursts open again and a horde of deatheaters come through.
My fingers brush over the racy posters spelled to the walls. As I make my way down the wall, above the dresser, I trace the faces of a single photo of Sirius, Remus, Dad, and Pettigrew. It's a non-magical photo; the four sit lifelessly. I make my usual route around, peeking into Sirius’ closets and wardrobes for Howards memorabilia like he let me first do when I was only fifteen. There's a few band shirts and quidditch slips in the first closet, sweatshirts, robes, and leather jackets in the second. Nothing new. The chest is, as I already know, nothing but dirty magazines that would make walburga howl, and the usual underwear and socks, but I look inside regardless. I can't seem to help myself.
Once changed, the three begin planning their next course of action in rushed whispers, and, I’d nearly forgot, I'm merely a piece of luggage to be dragged along. I only play a real part in whatever this is when the Golden Boy wishes it.
Malfoy sneers, keeping his wand steadily raised towards him, “Professor. Funny how this all turns out, isn’t it?”
I can tell she’s trying to look stern and intimidating but she can't mask her look of panic, not from a Malfoy. It takes a great effort to hold back my lashing tongue. I don't remember the address she states the second after she says it, but I know it's muggle and that Granger’s been here as a child, though it doesn't make a difference. The hand finds its way around my arm again as the three quickly move along threatening to leave me behind in the dust.
“What are you all doing! Harry’s obviously under the Imperius!” Charlie raises his wand but I expel it as well.
My eyes dart around quickly, flickering with each strong pulse of the blood streaming through my veins.
I swallow the lump in my throat, continuously moving back, “I  haven’t told you two everything. Not yet.” I hear the sound of cloth rustling from where I can't see, past the brown-eyed girl.
The bright-eyed witch turns around, grabbing me by the hand, and nods, “Because I stood up for you, and your decision which, by the way Harry, I don't even understand.” I sigh, squeezing her hand.
As the hour grew later, a game of Truth or Dare had started. This would be the third game since the parties had begun, so most everyone involved was familiar with the rules. At the start, everyone had made a Wizard’s Pact not to share what happened or what secrets were revealed to anyone outside of the group involved in the game. If anyone refused a Dare or Truth, they had to take a drink – though the size of the drink was up to the individual so no one felt pressure to drink more than they were comfortable. Draco had decided to merely sip at his firewhiskey tonight, enjoying the slow build of heat in his stomach.
“Godric, just take it!” Hermione says exasperatedly and shoves the flask into Malfoy’s closed hand, leaning back on her heels impatiently. The blond eyes the bottle suspiciously before his pain wins over and he downs the potion.
The rest of Weasley and Granger’s conversation gets lost in the upturned dust and smog as I struggle to keep up, my long robes himdering speed. The muggles walking past us spare only a shocked glance, their fat mouths contorting into barbaric snarls. Potter pulls me into stride alongside him, tossing me a venomous glance before turning his gaze forward again.
Malfoy’s arm sets ironclad, his face wash of emotion, and eyes steely. He takes two robotic steps forwards and peels his lips back. “Avada Kedavra!”
I push off the last step and take a look around to see where I've arrived on the second floor, only a couple yards away from Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
“Probably because he's dead. Murdered, or so I've heard” I say with a sneer. “But I've always thought the circumstances a bit suspicious. Death eaters don't like to talk of him often anymore.”
Hermione drops her pouch on the sofa with a resounding thud. “Sleep? Only you, Ronald Weasley, would ever think to sleep at a time like this.”
The students sitting in the circle watched them in amazement, and not a little admiration. Most of the onlookers had not expected anything of the sort happening between Draco and Potter, though a few – namely Pansy, Theo, Luna, Ron, Hermione, and Blaise – looked on with amused, knowing expressions.
Potter was so startled at the admission, he took a step backwards, bumping into a desk with a clatter.
I feel jumpy, alert, and after pacing all four corners of the room yearn for a bigger space to roam. I open the door to the sitting room quietly, hearing snoring from the other end. Malfoy is in the same corner, tucked up within a blanket, his knees in his armpits no doubt. But that's not what draws my attention in the room- it's Ron and Hermione.
But, It can't be just me, can it? This can't just be fate. Something we must have done was wrong. This can't be hopeless.
I snort and begin to pick at my nails absentmindedly. How little these three truly know, and yet the fate of the Wizarding World is meant to rest in their hands. How pitiable.
Stuck in between several shadowed, simple-looking houses on a residential street is a looming structure, simultaneously unseen and yet striking if you ever have seen it; the ancestral home of the Black family on number twelve Grimmauld does not appear as soon I arrive. Not until I really think about it, bittersweet memories of Sirius and the Weasleys’ flooding my mind, does it reveal itself to me, horribly familiar. I stand just by the house’s dusty stoop, hidden under its Fidelius charm.
The frizzy-haired girl makes her way down the stalls again, towards the rusting sinks where Ron sits, eyes trained on the wall opposite of me. Through the stained glass windows the sun is beginning to rise, caught in a marred aura of red and orange, the light of which reflects in the puddles on the floor.
“Well,” Hermione sighs and digs a hand into her hair, “There's only one place I can think of to go.”
“Do think it was the Ministry that alerted You-Know-Who’s followers at the wedding?” Ron poses, evidently thinking aloud. “I saw a few ministry guests, they could have been talking to Pops. He's too trusting sometimes…”
Suddenly the gleam of the locket dries out and it sits dully in my hand, no more valuable than an old stone from the bottom of the Great Lake.
“It was a compulsive curse.” Hermione breaths. She embraces me again and her scent fills me up. It's familiar and homey- like aged books and a crackling fire -a welcome change from the dirt and ash upturned on the London streets we travelled or the thick smog that fills it's skies, or even the eternal scent of furniture polish and potpourri that marked number 4 Privet Drive.
“Do you want to try reasoning with her?” I ask. As I clench my jaw in frustration my eyes lower down to Malfoy’s wrists. Past the matted fringe that sticks my forehead with sweat, I can see that they're still unnaturally pale despite the blood that threatens to stain his hands.
Thank you for reading!! I really do hope you enjoyed this chapter! Writing Draco in this way will always be one of my favorite things, I think, because his redemption was never really explored in canon. However I do find it kind of difficult. Where do I cross the line, am I making him irredeemable?
Draco didn’t think pointing out that he hadn’t been truly capable of most of that before Voldemort died would be helpful. Sure, he’d known all of those spells (and quite a few more) but he’d never been able to use them so effectively before he’d started training with Harry. There were advantages to spending hours every day for a month duelling with Harry Potter. They just weren’t advantages anyone else was likely to acknowledge let alone approve of.
Sometimes he didn’t want to deal with the curious looks of the other eighth years, didn’t want to deal with the whispers and the questions – although it wasn’t so bad from the eighth years really. It seemed like, to a lot of them, this was just the continuation of the Draco/Harry relationship that had seen so many fights and insults and that, much like before the war, they were content to just ignore the stupid drama of it all and get on with things.
They’d had fights before, he and Ron, of course they had. There’d been petty squabbles and stupid fights over little things that you couldn’t help but have when you shared a dorm and classes with someone and saw them almost every second of the day. But there’d been just three major fights between them and they’d all been, Harry could understand that now, because of the same thing. It was only now, on the other side of the war, with his found family and the understanding that there were plenty of people who loved him, that he could see that those big fights had never really been about him.
‘You wouldn’t have left me,’ Harry informed him, which Draco thought was terrible naïve of Harry. Eleven-year-old Draco would absolutely have left Harry. ‘You are braver than you give yourself credit for,’ Harry loyally defended.
Hogwarts was over a thousand years old. She had magic of her own that was woven carefully and lovingly into her very walls and floors and they found evidence of that everywhere they went on the fifth floor. Several times, Draco got distracted by the spellwork, Harry another couple. It took them hours to carefully sweep through the corridors and classrooms of the fifth floor, marking spells and enchantments they would need to come back to undo. They didn’t find any more lust spells, thank Merlin, but they did find a boggart lurking in a dusty cabinet in what, judging by the motif painted on the walls, had once been an astronomy classroom.
With what was possibly the worst timing, Weasley walked in just as Hermione crumbled – Draco was sure it was a stress reaction more so than anything because Hermione was not, by nature, a crier. Draco didn’t even see him coming, he was too busy trying to comfort Hermione (which he was terrible at but he was trying) when a large shape loomed in the corner of his eye and he spun about just in time to take Weasley’s clenched fist to his jaw.
‘It’s a good look on you,’ Granger spoke suddenly, voice soft but serious. ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen you this happy and relaxed.’
‘I’d like to think ‘Mione and I could have talked you out of wasting all that time on some poncy Death Eater.’
‘You look like shit,’ were the delightful words Pansy greeted them with when she’d opened the front door of her tiny London flat.
‘You hit him in the back with a stinging hex,’ someone spoke up. ‘Professor, Chris needs to go to the Hospital Wing.’
‘Good,’ he and Ginny both replied without hesitation. Although Ginny followed it up with, ‘He needs to realise what a git he’s being,’ when he would have simply left it at that because now he knew they were going to have to talk about Weasley, and Draco had very much been enjoying not having to think about the prat.
‘Hermione!’ Draco tried to sound betrayed, but he was laughing. He was laughing with Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley over a breakfast that he knew he’d have paid for even without Ginny declaring he owed her. It was truly astonishing how much his life had changed (for the better) in the last eight months.
Draco loved Harry now. He’d had time to change and learn, but the Draco from just a few years past with the opportunity to have his parents safe and whole and those pureblood ideals? He knew himself and his love for his family well enough to know just how differently he would have turned out. Take away all the blood and death and meaningless torture and he’d have stood by them, he’d have seen no reason not to reconcile his past beliefs until he was toeing that pureblood line again.
The feel of the magic on the Mark tearing at him and pulling him in a direction he didn’t want to go was a horror he’d never thought to revisit. He’d never liked it before, even when he’d half known what to expect, but this time, months and months out from the death of the Dark Lord, there was no way to know what he was apparating into. No way to know if it was battle or a gathering of Death Eaters or even a Ministry set trap. He hated that he was dragging Harry into this, hated that it really probably was a trap for escaped Death Eaters.
‘Mister Potter,’ he snapped, ‘am I to understand you find something funny in our discussion on duels.’
‘Draco…’ Harry had trailed off not seeming to know how to finish that sentence. He’d stared at Draco with a soft confused look and all at once he seemed to collapse in on himself. Shoulders curling protectively inward, hands grabbing hold of the sofa cushion beneath him.
They’d been arguing about it all week, Draco had made his opinion known, he didn’t want Harry throwing away his future over something Draco deserved. Harry had pointed out Draco was his future and that had softened Draco enough to end the argument that time. This time, that argument wouldn’t work. Especially not with Ron and Hermione looking between them, waiting for someone to start explaining Draco’s vehemence against the idea of Harry helping with interhouse unity.
‘No,’ Granger shook her head. She waved a hand between the two of them and made another strangled sound. At least her tears had dried up and she no longer looked like a watery and snotty disaster. Well, not as much of one. Helplessly she said, ‘Harry, I didn’t even know you were gay!’
‘I think that was the first time I ever really understood you might have a thing for boys as well,’ Pansy said of the Yule Ball in fourth year.
Harry glared at Draco in the mirror. ‘I know, the man never met a problem he couldn’t solve by throwing money at it.’
And he did envy that, Harry knew that now, more importantly he understood it, he could see it for himself. He hadn’t needed Charlie’s letter or Arthur’s hesitant words as he tried to explain his own son’s failings and shortcomings, to see it. Harry knew that if they were to ever be friends again then it would need to be with a Ron who was comfortable in his own skin and not a moment before. And if Hermione wanted to be a part of that process, if she wanted to be by Ron’s side as he learnt these things about himself and worked to overcome them, then Harry was perfectly happy for her. It hadn’t, after all, just been Ron pining for years and years.
Harry tried to look offended, but he ended up laughing. ‘The fact you’re the one saying that – and meaning it – should be stranger than it is.’
Harry reached across the table and took Draco’s hand. ‘It’s a good idea,’ he assured him. ‘And it’s things like this that prove how much you’ve changed. You’re not that bigoted kid anymore.’
‘Oh, Ron,’ she whispered softly – sadly. ‘That’s – that’s good,’ Hermione added, for wont of anything better to say. ‘That you’re acknowledging these things. But – you must know, Harry and I never thought that you were any less important than us. We never…’ she didn’t know how to continue. What else could she say? She’d always known that he was jealous of Harry, not necessarily because he wanted to be the Boy Who Lived or the Chosen One but because his friend was rich and powerful and so good that it was hard to be in his shadow sometimes.
It was nice to be able to walk around with Draco, openly holding his hand and not worry that someone was going to say something or do something. They’d been a lot more discreet about their relationship at the muggle market in the village near the Manor, neither of them wanting to chance that someone might say or do something that would end with either of them in handcuffs while some stupid bigoted muggle was bleeding on the pavement. That would definitely be a one-way ticket back to Azkaban for Draco, even if the aforementioned muggle had been in the wrong – and actually existed – and in spite of the staunch support Draco was slowly finding in Kingsley, Robards and Winthrop.
As he worked to dismantle them from the inside, which was always much easier than doing so from the outside (and formed half the reason the Ministry was so eager to make use of Draco) he was vaguely aware of Harry crossing back and forth. The nature of the wards being what they were, on each trip he dragged another of the witches free of the ward and into auror custody. Once he was finished, he moved to stand beside Draco. Although he had his own eyes closed, Draco could feel the way Harry kept a careful eye on him and the house. They didn’t know yet if there were more waiting for them inside and, as deep in his mind and the magic as he was, trying to take down the wards, Draco’s reactions would be just moments too slow to stop anything truly bad from reaching him.
Startled, though pleasantly surprised, Draco rose from his position at the end of the Slytherin table and moved to join them just as Althea Jordan hurried into the Great Hall with Filch limping along in her wake. Draco met the eyes of the Ministry curse breakers and was once again pleasantly surprised by what he saw. None of them were giving him dark looks of suspicion, there wasn’t the usual murmured undercurrent of distrust, the not-at-all subtle suggestion he’d been released from prison too soon. In fact, it was quite the opposite, he saw respect in those eyes, a welcome he’d hardly have expected from people who didn’t know him any way other than through his reputation as a Death Eater, his name splashed across headlines and whispered about in Ministry corridors.
Honestly, sometimes Harry wished Draco still had the pain tolerance of his thirteen-year-old self, at least then Harry would know when he was hurt the moment it happened and not have to worry that he was hiding the true extent of injuries out of guilt and a need to make amends. Or worse, some sense that the punishment was deserved.
Draco glanced over to see him striding across the room looking annoyed. His hair was still damp – because he never bothered to do anything more than run a towel through it – and he’d put on a fresh set of joggers and a quidditch jersey that Draco thought he’d lost to Luna over the summer (proving his favourite Ravenclaw had much better taste than he’d given her credit for). Hermione was right behind him, fresh out of class and looking exasperated.
Such a nice change from the earlier months of his probation in which he’d frequently wound up in Madam Pomfrey’s care.
The glare did nothing to Draco who took the letter, still tucked in its envelope and slipped it into his bag without bothering to read it. He didn’t need to. Harry’s look told him everything he needed to know about just what the goblins at Gringotts had to say. They were hardly a forgiving lot and Harry wasn’t going to get anywhere with them by getting annoyed. He’d tried that once already and it had gotten him exactly nowhere. Draco felt he had a much better chance of wearing the goblins down than Harry did. They certainly had no issue with him accessing Harry’s vaults or even his own. They’d been perfectly accommodating when it came to taking control over the contents of the Lestrange vaults and had been all too happy allowing him to oversee the move of Sirius Black’s property to Harry’s control.
Draco frowned over at him. Somewhat amused, he said, ‘No offense, Potter, but you were a very self-involved teenager.’
He felt his anger and annoyance deflate and he sighed tiredly. ‘Sorry,’ he told her, scrubbing a hand over his face.
Harry studied her expression, trying to discern whether she was angry, hurt or amused – she seemed to be all three. ‘Are you mad?’ he ventured.
‘I really feel you should be giving Harry that look,’ Draco returned, quite offended. When had he ever done anything stupid and life endangering?
He hadn’t given much thought to what his friends must be thinking. Being in a terrible rage over what the Ministry was doing hadn’t exactly left him calm and level-headed enough to have the long overdue conversation he really had been meaning to have with his two best friends.
Harry looked back at him, his brow wrinkled in concern. ‘I don’t think I even know how old she is,’ he admitted. ‘I just remember thinking she was old when she took all those stunners to the chest back in fifth year.’
Words muffled from where he’d pressed his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, Harry murmured, ‘It was Sirius.’
Bill nodded sharply and jogged back to Charlie. Harry watched him go before he turned back to the dragon. He and Draco didn’t share a word as they studied the creature. Harry didn’t understand that kind of cruelty and he didn’t want to understand what use Voldemort might have for a dragon.
It was her father who had published the photo in an article about putting the war behind them and making positive steps to rebuild what was lost (“see above the wonderful balance of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Slytherin, in a true show of setting aside the rivalries that characterised the war”).
.’ He’d been a little preoccupied by the reality of the situation hitting him and so he’d completely missed the bemused look Arthur shot his wife but then he’d dropped his head onto the table with heavy thunk and moaned, ‘Why does he have to be so fit?’
‘Because they insist they’ll only let you return with an escort – they named me as a preferred choice as I have conducted business honestly with them on your behalf.’
It was unfortunate that Herbology and Charms were the only two classes he could count on the professors to treat him fairly. Although, he thought the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher was at least attempting to remain impartial, Draco could see his resolve slowly being chipped away by the rumours and comments he heard cast Draco’s way. Professor Joseph might be qualified to teach at any number of magical schools, but Draco didn’t think he was qualified to teach at Hogwarts where all but the first and second years had fought in the last battle. He’d been safely tucked away in the mountains in India researching something Draco hadn’t cared enough to learn about. Tucked away as he was, he hadn’t felt the effects of the war. By all accounts, he’d come back to England after ten years, surprised to find out how bad things had gotten.
Ginny slumps in her chair, throws her head back to glare at the ceiling but he doesn’t think she’s actually seeing it. ‘I never really hated you until then,’ she murmurs, her words obviously meant for Draco. ‘You were always a git but you’d never really done anything to me personally – aside from the occasional insult – until you took all of Harry’s attention when we were finally dating.’
He’s older and wiser and not so much of an oblivious idiot these days and he can admit – only to himself and Draco – that maybe all that obsessive stalking and the need to prove he was right about Draco was a lot more complicated and maybe did involve an element of attraction.
‘I have done the homework,’ he offered, without looking away from the pages of his book. If he didn’t look at either of them, he might not have to get involved.
Something of that must have shown because Harry crossed the room in quick strides and sank to his knees between Draco’s own, practically shoving Hermione out of the way. Harry placed both hands on Draco’s thighs, warm and strong and a sharp reminder that he was there as he gazed up at Draco with a tender smile.
Harry wants that life. He doesn’t want a life of constantly passing Ginny by and a schedule that means they’ll raise their kids in a house without the kind of love they deserve.
There was no comfort to be taken from having to completely cleanse the castle and the house elves could still be found coaxing castle magic back into certain places within the castle now that all the unnecessary spells and enchantments had been removed. Draco had never been especially attuned to the castle before, most of his magic seemed to focus on Malfoy and Black properties but Harry and Luna sensed the difference in the castle now that the centuries of interfering magic had been removed.
Of course, they never actually made it out to the grounds for that talk. McGonagall intercepted them on their way through the Entrance Hall, her expression hard. ‘Mister Malfoy, come with me.’
Possibly it was the shadows under hers eyes and the tear stained cheeks but it could have been the ugly slippers and state of dress that had Harry blurting out, ‘Fuck, Hermione, are you alright?’ rather than address the fact he’d just been caught kissing Draco in the middle of the Entrance Hall at six in the morning.
Harry had once tried to explain to him why he didn’t much care what his hair looked like or what clothes he was wearing. Draco couldn’t remember now exactly how the conversation had started or how it had turned into an argument, but it had ended with Draco spending an absolute fortune on clothing and accessories in muggle London and Harry having an entire new Slytherin approved wardrobe. Draco had one too because his commitment to fashion coupled with his commitment to sticking it to his pureblood father had sort of spiralled out of control.
This was, for all of them, the real sticking point. Not one of them would have held it against him if he went off on Harry for loving a Death Eater or Draco Malfoy but to target the fact that Draco was a man…
If this reaction had come from Weasley he’d have understood. Weasley’s hatred of him ran hotter and longer than even Harry’s but coming from Granger, it was different. It cast doubt, not only on Draco, but on Harry and the complete faith and trust he had in Draco. He honestly didn’t mind so much that Granger had her doubts about him, that was to be expected, but he was disappointed that she had so little faith in Harry. After all this time, shouldn’t she trust him explicitly?
Joseph’s expression hardened. ‘Given your history, Mister Malfoy, and the reason you are back at this school, I would have thought you would be taking your studies more seriously.’
Draco glared at her back, his words exceptionally harsh when he snapped, ‘Albus Dumbledore has a lot to answer for. He’s lucky he’s dead or else I’d have killed him.’
‘Where should we start?’ he wondered, a little overwhelmed by the work they had ahead of them and wishing he was settling in for some ordinary Ancient Runes homework instead. Salazar, he’d almost prefer to be back at the house of Raymond Groener (Death Eater #3 from the Christmas attack), and he had honestly thought he and Harry were never getting out of there before they had to leave for Hogwarts. The place had been filthy, covered in dust and spilled potion ingredients and everything the aurors had tried to touch had been cursed and spelled to snap or bite or, in one memorable moment, burn those who touched them.
Sometimes, Harry wondered if he shouldn’t have chosen his electives more wisely than just signing up for everything because he’d have Ron – what about Hermione? Divination had been a complete waste of his time and, no offense to Hagrid, but Care of Magical Creatures had been just as useless. There was another what-if, he mused. What if he’d taken Ancient Runes or Arithmancy with Hermione and somehow ended up getting to know Draco better? He knew he would have. Two more lessons where he could stare at Draco. Two more opportunities to obsess over his smirk and his snark and his –
Explaining to Hermione how Ron had made him feel had been different than talking to Draco or Luna – or even Ginny. It had taken effort to explain his feelings, to try and explain why he wanted to just move on but not forget. He wanted to leave the feelings of anger and betrayal behind and just live his life as he’d been doing all those months while they’d been in Australia.
Harry had thought the dragon in Gringotts had looked bad, but this was so much worse. It was skin and bone, slumped against the frozen ground, snow piled atop the ridges on its back and its wings were splayed across the ground, holes in the membranes. Though the dragon was looking in their direction, Harry didn’t imagine it could see anything with its eyes full of puss and heavily infected.
Madam Pomfrey gave no warning this time either, a wave of her wand vanished the glass and Draco swore emphatically as a fresh flow of hot blood welled out of the wound and started to trail down his chest. He clenched his jaw tightly and turned his head away, locking eyes with Luna, he maintained the stare while Madam Pomfrey poked and probed at the wound with spells and fingers until she seemed satisfied.
was the one being hurt but he cared that the Ministry could do this to anyone. And Harry could work with that.
‘This is much more impressive now I’m not half dead in Azkaban,’ he slurred. He didn’t know how much of that Harry even understood but the soft puff of air that hit the top of his head might have been a laugh. He wouldn’t know. Nose pressed into the delightfully soft skin of Harry’s neck he finally let go and allowed his body the dark emptiness it had been craving.
‘About the library?’ Draco asked, confused. He’d have thought Granger, of all people, would appreciate just how serious a library was.
They were already making use of him and he had no choice, it was court mandated, not to mention there were plenty of people at the Ministry happy to see him being used in such a way, they were even happier to know he was being hurt in the process. Giving him additional training didn’t mesh with the idea this was all part of his punishment for each and every one of his poor choices and Harry said as much to Robards.
‘I’m okay,’ he tried to reassure them, although he wasn’t sure he was all that successful because his mouth went on spewing words he hadn’t intended to say. ‘I have recently become aware that I might have a thing for that tone you get when you’re mad at me.’
Hermione frowned at that. ‘Do you really think it’s a good idea to ask a bunch of Slytherins to bankroll Hogwarts?’
Someone had pulled a rope across the corridor cutting off further passage onto the fifth floor. Before they crossed the barrier, Draco cast a series of spells to detect any protective charms that might have been placed on the rope. Hogwarts was full of curious and stupid teenagers. Harry had dragged him into enough dark corners and cosy alcoves to know that teenagers would ignore a rope for some healthy snogging.
‘I know,’ Ron acknowledged. It was weird, how subdued he sounded. He’d been so hopeful when he’d approached her and asked if they could talk, if he could take her on a date and try and explain. If he could try and make it up to her.
‘Er,’ the stallholder shifted uncomfortably and Harry realised it might not have been polite to just start inquiring about the man’s plans for educating his children out of the blue.
But his voice was soft when he spoke to Harry, saying, ‘You should go, you shouldn’t have to hear this.’
The admission startled her. Clearly Pansy hadn’t been expecting the truth. The old Draco certainly wouldn’t have admitted to such a failing. The old Draco wouldn’t have realised he didn’t have friends, wouldn’t have realised the relationships he cultivated out of manipulation and casual sex were anything less than proper bonds of friendship. He would never have realised how his own arrogance, his own desire to emulate his father, would limit his ability to trust the people around him, would limit his understanding of people and relationships until he had no one he could truly trust, no one he could turn to.
‘Healer Yang thinks it’ll be good for me,’ Ron admitted. ‘Doing the training without Harry. He thinks it will give me the chance to be my own person and not feel like I’m stuck in Harry’s shadow.’
Imploringly he’d said, ‘He doesn’t see Harry Potter, the Chosen One, Saviour of the Wizarding World, he just sees Harry.’ He’d looked helplessly at Molly then and he’d been so startled by the tears forming in her eyes that he’d flinched back from the table.
So far, they hadn’t noticed any shared magical talents, but Draco couldn’t help but wonder if they would notice. He suspected the changes would come so naturally to the both of them that it would take someone observing to notice. And that would be dependent on who was paying close enough attention to notice and whether they’d pick up on the significance of what they were seeing.
He’d be meeting the terms of his parole, yes, but he’d also be gaining skills to be used once his parole was over. Robards was suggesting he had a proper – paid – place for Draco within the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the end of his release. And if Robards was suggesting it then Kingsley no doubt knew about it.
They finished off the food talking about everything from Draco’s earlier observation about muggle money to whether or not the Canons had any chance in this year’s league. By the time they were done, they’d somehow moved closer to the dirty stained glass and were lying down with their heads directed out where the thumping against the glass had become what sounded – to Draco and Luna at least – like mournful pining.
Whoever the hand belonged to was alive and didn’t seem to be badly hurt, which was lucky. Much luckier than whoever belonged to the mangled foot he could see sticking out from beneath the debris on the other side of the corridor. Draco could do nothing for them, he had no way of reaching them, no way of stabilising them as he had done for Harriet.
Mustafa merely nodded when Harry called back their findings and instead of sending the team out in a line behind them, he set them all up along the boundary (with a sizeable gap between each team – nobody needed to blow anybody else up) and they started in on a long sweep.
‘Bloody fucking hell,’ Harry croaked, rolling onto his side and wheezing as he tried to get his breathing back under control. The pain in his chest wasn’t the worst he’d ever experienced but fuck if it wasn’t a close second.
Watching Ron get jealous and storm away (as he’d done before) over just how much wealth Harry had inherited seemed an easier blow than losing his oldest friend because of who he chose to love.
‘How would that have changed anything?’ Draco wondered softly, thinking about all the smirks and teasing he’d done to cover up the hours and hours of physiotherapy he’d had to put in with Madam Pomfrey. No to mention the ointments to prevent scarring and the fiery feeling of spending almost a week in the Hospital Wing having his nerves regrown and tendons reattached.
‘Potter,’ his father had sneered. The sneering had helped Draco get a grip back on the reality where he was standing in his father’s cell being told he must marry Harry and they
‘Anyway,’ Draco went on, ‘Andromeda was talking about how she was going to school Teddy because she wanted to send him to a muggle primary school but if he doesn’t get a proper grip on his metamorphmagus abilities it’s going to be a bit of a moot point. She can’t afford a governess and while she could teach him herself, she’s worried about his social skills.’
In the end, telling Molly and Arthur had been easy and all the other Weasley’s after that had just sort of happened. Bill, because he’d been at the Manor working on a tricky curse they’d unearthed in the dungeon and had walked in on Harry and Draco snogging in the kitchen. George had found out when Harry and Luna had dragged Draco into the joke shop and something about their interaction had twigged for George and rather than be angry or hurt – or, fuck, even betrayed because Draco had done some terrible things with people who had gotten Fred killed – he’d laughed himself silly for a solid three minutes.
Well, that sorted Harry’s Christmas present then. Draco knew a lot about the old wizarding family’s, even those who didn’t make it into the Sacred Twenty-Eight. He was sure he could put some of that knowledge to use to help Harry reclaim his past.
Mendenhall on the other hand, was old, scarred and had been through both wars and, in his opinion, Draco made for a pathetic Death Eater. He could have been like so many other aurors, painting Draco with the same brush as his father but he wasn’t and that meant that Draco stood a chance of coming out of this alive and maybe even unharmed.
‘I think being away from Ron and Hermione for all those months was good for me.’ The words were an admission – a revelation – but they didn’t sound hesitant or new. This was an idea Harry had come to terms with, something he’d been mulling over and concluded in the last week. Or perhaps it had been on his mind much longer?
Luna had known before he did that he wasn’t as straight as he’d assumed. She’d known before he had that he fancied Draco and with the other Weasley children off doing what they were doing and Ron and Hermione in Australia, he’d never had to come out and say it before.
‘Harry no!’ Hermione’s sharp reprimand had his gaze darting over to see Harry being held back from another attempt to scramble the very small amount of floor left along the wall to get to him.
‘I sleep just fine,’ Harry assured her, with a smile. ‘I mean, I’m not getting ten hours a night like some people,’ he shot Ron a pointed look, ‘but I do alright.’ He shrugged. ‘Besides, it’s only for another six months and then Draco and I can sit our exams – NEWTs first, but they’ve promised to rush our results so we can sit the rest right after.’
Which wasn’t actually the point because he and Draco hadn’t been talking about Gringotts at all. They’d been arguing about visiting Draco’s father in Azkaban to tell him about their relationship. Harry didn’t want it getting out before Lucius was made aware in case the press got a hold of it and he had to hear about it that way. Harry hated the man, loathed him, but as much as Draco tried to hate the man, he was still his father and Harry had to respect that. That didn’t mean he wasn’t going to attempt to stem any opportunity the man had to use Harry’s relationship with his son to his advantage. If they were up front about it, Harry had hopes that it would make it harder for Lucius to try and manipulate the situation to somehow benefit him.
McGonagall’s lips twitched in something that might have been a smile. ‘Perhaps,’ she acknowledged before sweeping away.
Blugh. He’d had enough of thinking about Harry and his Malfoy issues when they were kids. He’d thought it was bad enough now that it seemed they worked together occasionally. This was…
Draco felt the corner of his mouth tic up and he opened his eyes and lifted his head off Harry’s arm so he could look at her. She was growing her hair out, he saw. It reached past her shoulders now, in soft black waves he knew were natural. She’d always prided herself on her hair charms, always spent long minutes in the mornings using potions and charms to take away the natural wave of her hair. The waves softened her face, made her features less severe, more attractive. He’d once heard Harry describe her nose as pug-like when they were younger, he didn’t think that description quite fit anymore.
Harry snorted. But her words were softening him up, making him realise that most of his annoyance and frustration with her was stupid and misplaced because she wasn’t asking him all those tough questions – she was mourning the moments of his life she’d missed out on. She was his best friend and she was sad and upset and hurt because she hadn’t been there for him when he’d been feeling all of this. She was hurting because she was worried that he hadn’t had the support he needed while he was going through all of this.
‘Okay, but how long have we been stuck in it without noticing? Because, Draco, I can’t tell where the boundary line of the property is, and my watch isn’t keeping time anymore.’
While he’d been assessing the situation, Mendenhall and Winthrop had too, the older auror appeared to be even more annoyed now, whereas Winthrop had a calm expression on her face. Draco had seen that look on her once before, she’d sunk into the same calm right before she’d launched a counterattack against a supporter who had been hiding in the last house Draco had been sent to clear of Voldemort’s wards. Of course, he also knew how that ended so he wasn’t all that confident in her calm demeanour.
‘It means, Weasley,’ announced Draco as he sailed into the room looking flushed and sweaty, still in his quidditch gear and a plastic bag full of takeaway in his hand, ‘that Harry needed clothes that were his and not rejects from his hideous cousin who was approximately the size of one of Hagrid’s Halloween pumpkins.’
It had been easier with Harry in many ways, harder in others. He and Luna had history, but it was nothing compared to what he had with Harry. Six years of rivalry, of fights and duels, insults traded back and forth and an unfortunate case of stalking (Harry) and choosing the wrong side (Draco) weren’t something they could just ignore. They’d saved each other’s lives, though, and that counted for something. What counted for more was the fact that they understood each other in a way no one else could never hope to understand him. In a way most times even Luna couldn’t understand.
‘Tragically so,’ Draco agreed, opening his eyes at this just so he could give Weasley a look that spoke volumes.
‘We’re bloody well going to try,’ Marigold snarled. She added a few things under her breath, again in Tamil, although this time Harry suspected she was wishing she could cause bodily harm to the Carrows. He did hear something he thought might have been about necromancy and he had to laugh.
If Harry hadn’t continued talking, explaining about Fleur dismantling the blood curse and the subsequent request for a Ministry investigation, Draco might have drifted right back off to sleep. Which would have been a pity because he would have missed the look on Weasley’s face when he noticed his best friend absently stroking his bare feet.
‘He’s a Death Eater, Harry,’ barked Ron, on a bitter laugh. ‘Do you think about that when he’s shoving his cock up your arse? Is that the appeal?’ He scoffed. ‘Or do you fuck him? Is that it? One more way to beat Voldemort?’ Ron made a disgusted sound. ‘What would people say if they knew, huh? What would the rest of the wizarding world think if they knew their sweet precious saviour was a fairy?’
Somehow, in realising his feelings for Harry, Draco had failed to remember that while Harry had been steadily helping Draco put himself back together, he’d been doing the same for Harry. While Draco had struggled to come back from Azkaban and the things he’d done in the war, Harry was drowning in loss and guilt for things he had no control over. While Harry taught Draco how to be a better man, strengthening the traits Luna had witnessed in the Manor’s dungeon, while he helped Draco build back the strength needed to stand on his own two feet, he’d been offering Harry something just as valuable in return.
But Ron was going to notice eventually, even if Hermione didn’t point it out to him, and he’d like to be able to control just how the story got out rather than have it be public and messy like so many other things in his life. He just wasn’t sure where to begin. Did he start from the very beginning when he’d snuck down to the holding cells and found Draco beaten and unconscious on the verge of death? Did he start with the trials? Or Azkaban? Or, Merlin, did he start with a boy in a robe shop on Diagon Alley and how that had turned into lazy days at the Manor and long mornings in bed?
Ginny was much the same, although when she thought they were being idiots, or she wanted attention, she was perfectly willing to both call them on it and demand the attention she desired. Pansy never bothered to call them on it. She was very upfront about her need for attention in her letters and on the few times they’d caught up in person. In fact, the last time she’d written she’d declared she needed to talk with Harry about something muggle and he could bloody well leave Draco behind so she could get her answers without distraction.
Someone clapped a hand on his back and then everyone was going about their jobs like normal except for the messy haired man who was Harry fucking Potter because he had a wide grin on his face as he walked toward Ron. In a desperate need to not be humiliated he nipped back into his office with a smile he thought was welcoming and dove behind his desk where he hoped the sturdy wood and gathering clutter of paperwork would hide the wobbly belly he’d developed over the years behind a desk. Would the light hide his thinning hair? And he knew Hermione said it was nothing, but Ron was aware he’d started developing a bald patch a month or so ago.
‘Maybe?’ Ron didn’t sound too sure, but Hermione didn’t push him on it. She didn’t need to; he went on without prompting. ‘I don’t think so. Even if he had, I don’t think he’d have been trying to hurt her.’ He gave her a sheepish look. ‘Me and Harry, we’re not all that great with feelings.’
This is the softest chapter. It is honestly one of my favourites. That being said, the response to the last chapter absolutely blew my mind! Thank you so much for taking the time to comment with your thoughts and ideas and impressions, it was amazing!
‘Pansy’s sister-in-law,’ Harry answered. He shook his head. ‘You should have seen it ‘Mione. Everything was fine and then the cat came streaking out of the house, the bloody dog came running with a mouthful of pygmy puffs and Sesha slithered out with the tip of her tail on fire swearing up a storm – and you know snakes have some really good swear words and she’s only getting more foul-mouthed in her old age.’
‘Because we were worried about you, you prick.’ Ginny’s look was as sharp as her words. He did know her well enough to recognise that the sharpness covered genuine worry, however.
Draco was the one to break the kiss, slumping into Harry as he did so until his forehead rested on Harry’s shoulder. ‘I need to sleep. Preferably for a week.’
Voldemort’s gaze swept the room. He saw Harry and his friends, the fallen bodies of Bellatrix and Lucius. He didn’t see Draco. Didn’t see the strike that slayed Nagini. Not until it was too late.
Harry had soaked in almost a year’s worth of auror training in just a handful of months, after all. It was something to consider when they were writing their proposal for McGonagall, the different ways people could learn –
‘We don’t really sleep anymore,’ Harry had offered, by way of explanation, though he’d suspected his tired eyes and grumpy expression said as much.
He didn’t think anything of it. He had a vague idea that his childhood best friend worked as an auror and he was looking forward to seeing him again, feeling a longing for things forgotten with time, and so he kept an eye on the reports that he’d been given, the ones he was told would get him up to speed on the current cases for his new Department, looking for the name Potter. He found a couple of cases he thought might have been Harry’s – but it was hard to tell because everything was labelled with initials in the briefs and he never did come across any HP’s written in them.
‘Ginny,’ Harry answered, flushing red which was an absolute delight for Draco to witness. Given how adventurous Harry could be when it came to sex, watching him get all flustered just talking about learning the basic protections was adorable.
Draco didn’t even want to think about the true reasons Dumbledore had wanted to keep Harry so isolated. Thinking about Dumbledore used to fill him with so much guilt over his actions in sixth year but now thinking about the late headmaster filled him with rage.
‘Are you being summoned?’ Harry hurriedly demanded. He hadn’t taken his arm from around Draco and Draco wished that made some sort of difference, that he could take comfort from the gesture, but tears were stinging his eyes and his arm
Ginny, draped over the sofa in an exhausted slump from an afternoon spent freezing her arse off training in the rain, had simply shaken her head and pointed a finger between them repeating her earlier assertion, ‘I have actual pity for those of us who came between you since the moment you met in Diagon Alley.’
Harry tipped his head back to rest against Hermione’s bed and looked at the ceiling. Thinking months back to that first time with Ginny he tried to remember all his awkward fumbling, tried to think about his nerves and the fact that if Ginny hadn’t been the one in control, if she hadn’t taken charge, she’d likely not have actually gotten off – he’d been too inexperienced and nervous to even think properly about making it good for her even if he’d wanted to. Things with Draco in the beginning had been more a problem of lasting – he’d wanted Draco so much and been so turned on by everything the git did.
Now, in bed with Harry and talking about the sort of future they would have together, Draco could acknowledge that his father did love him and that he didn’t mind so much that what he wanted for himself was also what his father wanted for him. Because for the first time in a long time, what he knew his father wanted was simply for him to be happy.
Granger ignored Weasley, instead addressing her next words to both Draco and Harry. ‘If you’re up to it,’ she spoke calmly, as though she wasn’t desperately curious, ‘I’d like to hear about your summer.’
McGonagall nodded thoughtfully. ‘It was never open to all students, however, only those who possessed real talent.’
‘It was Winthrop’s idea,’ Robards admitted, because Harry had to ask. ‘She seems to think he’ll be a good fit.’
Hermione rolled her eyes at his tone, but she looked just as interested to learn the answer. ‘McGonagall wants us to check all the staircases,’ she informed them.
Wayward as his thoughts were, they didn’t distract him from what was happening. He wasn’t going to start jinxing fourth years, they were beneath him.
Raising his head, Harry stuck an arm out and shoved him in the side. ‘Oh, shut up,’ he grumbled with a slight grin.
‘I don’t want details,’ Pansy assured him. ‘I don’t need to know everything. I think it’s better if I don’t.’
‘Impressed,’ Granger repeated, her voice strained, eyes darting between the two of them. ‘Harry, you let Malfoy write on you in blood!’
McGonagall’s lips twitched in what might have been the beginnings of a smile, but she would not disparage her fellow teachers. ‘I think we can all agree that Sybil’s tenure here was dubious at best.’ Well, most of them.
Getting his pants off was going to be painful as fuck and he really wanted to be able to cry and wring some sympathy kisses out of Draco when he wriggled out of his jeans and not have to put on a brave face because Ron thought now was a good time to talk.
‘I’m not,’ Harry told her, somewhat bewildered. ‘And, of course I’m serious about Draco, if that’s what you meant.’
Draco turned to look at him, his eyes were unfocused and there was blood dribbling from his nose and his ears. He opened his mouth to speak but instead gave a wet cough. Something thick and warm splattered across Harry’s face and neck and Ginny let out an impressive snarl of profanity. Draco coughed again, more blood bubbling up to spill down his chin, some of it spattered Harry’s jumper.
‘Spell fragments,’ he murmured after listening for a while. ‘It’s all just spell fragments and not one but lots of different spells.’
‘We have seekers matches,’ Harry said instead. ‘We’re pretty evenly matched to be honest.’ That might be a bit of an understatement if Harry were being honest. They’d both taken to using the latest Cleansweep for their one-on-one games and it was painting all of Harry’s previous matches against the Slytherin team in a new light. Draco had never been able to match Harry’s speed, a Nimbus 2001 was no competition for a Firebolt, but he’d had the skill to put up a more than decent fight and that said a lot more about Draco’s skills on the pitch than anyone seemed to realise.
‘What the fuck was that?’ Mendenhall demanded, stepping up as close to Harry as he could comfortably get without knocking his rising star auror right across the boundary and into the mushroom cloud of magical death.
Kreacher had been responsible for delivery of the books (what with Draco being in Azkaban and Harry not allowed to set foot in the bank) and whatever Draco had been expecting when they entered the Potter vault it had not been the absolute chaos that was several teetering stacks of books, boxes overflowing with parchment and a mountain of gold that made Draco all warm inside but gave Harry an itchy feeling that if Draco wasn’t careful, would see Harry donating a good half of his money just to ease the guilt of having too much.
In response, Granger let out a sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a sob and Harry was by her side in an instant wrapping his arms around her and drawing her close. He made soothing noises, nonsense tumbling from his mouth as he tried – and seemingly failed – to calm her down.
‘My feelings of inferiority,’ he answered sheepishly. ‘How I feel like I can never really live up to my brothers. How sometimes Harry makes me feel self-conscious.’ He looked at her nervously, eyes darting away before he said, ‘The feeling that I’ll never be good enough for you.’
‘That sounds like Blaise,’ Draco agreed. He frowned though, realising that if she wasn’t talking to any of their old Slytherin classmates then he had no idea who she’d been talking to.
Draco considered it but shook his head. When he’d been going over everything he knew about the Carrows (and welcoming the occasional input from aurors who had gone up against them), he’d made a point to stress how pathologically cruel they were. He’d emphasised their passion for pain over quick deaths and he’d cautioned multiple times that they’d taken great pleasure in the unexpected nature of their spells and curses.
He did, thank Merlin. Harry nodded once, sharply, and with a snap of his fingers summoned Draco’s coat along with his own. He helped Draco into the garment, gently easing the fabric over Draco’s aching arm with Molly’s help. Then he was hastily tugging on his own coat, gently urging Molly to step back, to step away from what was about to happen. Once she was at a safe distance, Harry spun, putting his back to Draco and dropped into a crouch, wand slipping into his hand. Despite the burning pain, Draco dropped his left hand to rest on Harry’s shoulder. Harry raised a hand to briefly squeeze the hand reassuringly before he spoke a sharp command to the Weasleys.
He should have fought harder, argued longer. Demanded to know where Draco had been taken and gone along anyway. He’d known the moment McGonagall had come for Draco that it would end badly. Draco was having a bad day, trapped in the aftermath of nightmares made from memories and he’d been dragged into something right out of one.
Oh, he suspected Granger had noticed Harry paying more attention, spending more time, with other people but he didn’t think she understood exactly what she was seeing, distracted as she was with her studies and her new relationship with the Weasel.
He’d been quite taken aback by her frankness, but she hadn’t said it to be mean or to gain his sympathy, she’d only said it to assure him that she saw exactly how strong his relationship with Harry had come to be. It had been this more than anything that allowed Draco to admit he and Ginny were genuinely friends and not simply faking it for Harry.
Hermione made a strange noise then, attracting all of their attention. The colour seemed to have drained from her face and she was staring at Draco with eyes wide, although he didn’t know that she was actually seeing him, she appeared to be looking through him. There was a beat where they all looked at her expectantly, waiting for some sort of explanation but then she shook her head and seemed to dismiss whatever notion had so distracted her.
‘I need help with Potions and Transfiguration. Professor - Professor McGonagall said you might be able to help.’
‘I forgave you,’ Pansy informed him archly, ‘because Daphne got dumped for a Gryffindor and was up for some revenge exploration. That girl may have decided she was straight, but we sure had some fun while she figured it out.’
Harry’s rolled eyes and the indulgent, ‘You idiot. If that was all this was, I’d go shag Zabini,’ that followed had hardly been the most romantic declaration of feelings.
‘I need to hate you both for a little while,’ she tells them, reiterates her point from earlier really.
For the most part, the house held nothing of interest, nothing that should require such a deadly ward. Winthrop and Mendenhall were about ready to call it safe and call in the other aurors when Harry found the house’s secret.
He caught his reflection in the bathroom mirror as he went to drop his towel in the laundry basket and paused for a moment. He didn’t often see what others saw when he looked in the mirror, too often he still saw scrawny Harry Potter with the broken glasses and messy hair and the hollow look of someone who didn’t have anyone and hadn’t been fed properly in a while.
Sending her this letter, with a sketch that could have been suggestive but was instead soft and warm, would intrigue her enough to respond, even if she wanted to hate his guts.
‘Actually, it does,’ Draco informed him, it was something he’d been turning over since they got into bed – when not distracted by Harry’s unfair lack of teenage acne.
Robards was definitely concerned. Harry had come to know the gruff head Auror well enough in the last five months to read that into what he was saying. He felt a little bad for all the shouting he’d done but not bad enough to go so far as to apologise – it had needed to be said.
‘I expect a proper marriage and grandchildren,’ his father had informed them crisply. ‘From both of you,’ he’d added, sharp look tossed to Harry to make sure they understood exactly what he meant. He looked back to Draco, eyes shining with a fierceness, Draco hadn’t expected. ‘Have your mother start looking into appropriate surrogates, there’ll need to be a proper contract.’
‘Ginny,’ he says her name on a sigh, warily and with enough awareness to know that his words are going to be painful (for her) but he needs to say them. ‘I’m in love with Draco.’
Draco appreciated that Harry still tried to pay attention when he went on a rant about Potions or something he discovered in one of the books he’d rescued from Grimmauld Place. ‘Magically speaking, we aren’t two people anymore.’
‘Multiple times, trust me,’ Harry assured him, sliding an arm around Draco’s waist to pull him snug against Harry’s side. ‘I could give you a list.’
‘You agree with me!’ Draco reminded her. ‘I know you do, not about all that anti-muggleborn propaganda, she deserves all she got for that, but about the teaching staff at Hogwarts. What did you have to do to qualify for your position?’ he asked.
Mendenhall was dressed in his usual tired looking auror robes, but Winthrop seemed to be making an effort to make hers more functional. She had a strange mix of muggle fashions on beneath the open scarlet robe – somehow, he thought Harry had a hand in that.
the Ministry – she didn’t want to be adversarial in her approach, she’d had a glimpse of how poorly that went in fourth year with SPEW. What she wanted was to be a part of the changes at the Ministry. She wanted to be like Percy taking red ink and a team to the archaic wizarding laws (although perhaps without the guilt that drove him). She wanted to be like Draco and his mother (as terrifying as such a thought was), building a new school system to encourage every magical child to mingle and mix and gain the best education.
Hermione darted a look to Harry for translation before she took a moment to seemingly consider Draco’s words. Harry took the opportunity to help himself to some bread to dip in his soup. It was on the later side to be having lunch in the Great Hall, most of the other students were already dashing off to their afternoon lessons but he didn’t have any more classes for the day and Draco and Hermione had an extra hour free because Professor Vector had been struck down with the flu. He imagined Draco had plans to spend more time researching the last curse on the Carrow property.
Finding the portrait of Fleamont Potter had been so much more than Draco expected. Damaged and lifeless, he’d found the portrait fallen behind a desk in what he thought must have been James Potter’s study. It had been pure chance he found it, he’d knocked a book off the desktop and when he’d bent to fetch it, sneezing at the amount of dust he’d dislodged, his hand had brushed, not against the book, but a painting. He’d known the moment he’d pulled it free that it was exactly what he would give Harry, even if he couldn’t restore it, it would have made a perfect addition to the already full box of family history he’d compiled.
‘His death wasn’t your fault,’ Draco firmly reminded him, his voice soft but clear in the empty common room, leaving no chance to be misunderstood.
Draco ignored them all and met Harry in the middle of the newly cleared space. They shared a grin before both started to tug their robes over their heads. Draco neatly folded his and set them safely aside, leaving him in snug dark jeans, dragon hide boots and a Slytherin green V-necked t-shirt that did nothing to hide the Dark Mark on his left arm or the wand holster on his right. He knew from experience that the tips of the stag’s antlers showed at the neck of the t-shirt.
‘I don’t think I ever really thought about it,’ Harry answered slowly, clearly wondering at the question. ‘I can feel that,’ he added. ‘It doesn’t feel any different to when I use my own magic.’
Hermione giggled. ‘You’re welcome.’ She nudged him with her shoulder. ‘I honestly don’t know how I didn’t notice,’ she told him. ‘You touch him all the time. You two have no concept of personal space anymore.’
This time Hermione was definitely amused, her lips twitching in a smile. ‘What are you planning on doing then? Curse breaking? I thought that was just something you did for the Ministry as part of your probation?’
It was one of the quickest showers he’d ever taken. He stood under the spray just long enough to rinse away the drying flakes of Draco’s blood and the salty track of tears on his face. He had a moment as he was getting dressed when he thought he might cry again. Ginny had brought him his own joggers and t-shirt, but she’d made sure to grab one of Draco’s jumpers, one of the ones he’d intentionally bought a size too big because he’d liked the way he could pull the sleeves over his hands. All those protests about muggle clothes, Harry just knew Draco’s newfound love for them had nothing really to do with how good he thought Harry looked in proper fitting clothing and everything to do with how Draco thought
He reached the line of Aurors, ignored the way Mendenhall swore and made a grab for him while another barked out an order for him to stop. He acted unconcerned by the spells the three remaining witches were firing back and simply walked ahead, pausing only to glance back over his shoulder and arch a brow at Harry.
Luna arrived then, drawing Harry briefly out of his melancholy thoughts, to smile weakly at her in greeting. She had Ginny with her. Ginny offered him a bright smile, if slightly weakened, but all he could offer back was a pale imitation. He didn’t want to deal with Ginny. Didn’t want a repeat of the conversation they’d had just before he left on that last training mission. Worried out of his mind about Draco, he just didn’t have the time or the energy to deal with Ginny and her honest words and gentle (but loving, she assured him) mocking.
The nursemaid seemed startled but rather than reply, she stuck her arm out of frame and seemed surprised when it left the confines of her portrait. She promptly burst into tears.
Draco smiled sadly and kissed his love's swollen lips. The taste of copper blended with the taste of Shadow and he licked gently at the small cut he'd made earlier. Pulling away reluctantly, he ran his hands through the thick curls, trying to tame the tangled mess. "Come on. I'm starving. We missed breakfast and you hardly touched dinner last night."
"I want you to obtain as much information on this boy as possible," Voldemort ordered coldly, ruthlessly implanting a picture of the brown-haired teen.
Draco looked around wildly and realized he was in the Muggle house, another clue that he was still dealing with Seraphim, but there was no sign of the alter otherwise. He was just about to ask Marissa what was happening when the shadows in the corner of the room drew together, impossibly deep and dark.
"Pansy's father is a Death Eaters, same with Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle. Blaise and Daphne are neutral. Millicent has Death Eater cousins, but she's been reluctant to full-heartedly agree with the Dark Lord's aims… I think I'll start with Blaise and Pansy. They were closest to me; hell, Pansy thought she was in love with me," Draco explained and looked over at his friend with a dark smile.
"Dear boy," Umbridge simpered, her blue eyes wide with a false innocence. "You have nothing to worry about. The Ministry and the Aurors will protect you. Soon the crisis will be over. There is nothing to fear."
Severus was bound and forced to act as a prisoner with no rights! Shadow was going to have to put up with interviews with a case witch or wizard who would be looking for signs of distress and abuse! It was intolerable! And what if Severus really believed it? That he deserved to be treated in this manner or that any humiliation suffered on his part is acceptable if it were for Shadow.
Shadow nodded. He found something sharp in the rubble and cut his finger, smearing his blood on the ring. Draco grabbed hold of his arm and Shadow activated the portkey. They arrived in his bedroom at home less than a minute later.
Four Death Eaters broke away from the rest. They were heading toward them and Shadow had a feeling they were going to enjoy breaking through to tear them apart. It was their fault for destroying the prophecy and making them fail their Master, after all. Someone was going to pay for that and it looked like they had their sights set on Shadow and his friends.
Neville stared at him in amazement. How could the blond still be worried about that when Shadow was facing so much more important things, like being brain dead?
"What is?" Harry panted, feeling a bit faint. He tried to bring his mind back into focus, but just then Draco arched a bit, his hard erection rubbing sensually up his stomach, hiking his shirt up slightly. The cold air on the hot skin below his belly button made goosebumps rise along his arms.
Seraphim's hands came free and Draco gasped. The alter had something! Then Severus's head popped out, the man's shoulder's, his torso… The three of them fell backward on top of one another. Seraphim sat up and cradled the unconscious man to his chest. He looked up at Draco with tormented green eyes.
For all of Draco’s life, his peers had been assigned to him by his father. They were comrades and acquaintances, but never true friends. He always had limits as to how far he could trust them because betrayal was certain if he showed weakness, if he slipped even a little bit away from upholding the Malfoy standards.
“Yes." Severus smiled. "That means it is likely that someone very well may fall in love with you in spite of the burdens you bear. A relationship is very possible." His expression turned more solemn as he touched on the more sensitive topic. "And I now better understand your disgust with the idea of becoming intimate with another person. If you truly believe no one could love you in that manner, then sex would be abhorrent to you. I don't believe intimacy will ever be attractive in a casual sense for you, but I want you to consider how different it would be to be with someone to whom you are committed and who is equally committed to you."
"Really?" Draco asked leadingly, trying to keep Boy engaged in conversation as he had been instructed.
They were soaring. Shadow grinned hard into the wind and dove. The ground rushed toward him, shrouded in darkness, opening up, trying to swallow him, but he was defiance itself and, whooping with laughter, he pulled up at the last minute, skimming the snow-covered surface and sending a powdery spraying up in his wake.
The metal of the priceless heirloom caught fire, the inhuman screech drowned out by the hungry roar of the flames. Harry watched to make sure the fire didn't spread to anything else, watched to be sure one of the last bits of his enemy was truly destroyed. He felt a smile stretch his face and knew it wasn't a pretty one. Adrenaline pumped in his veins as he moved forward, ready for all of this to be over.
She relaxed and reached up for his wing, burying her small fingers into the feathers and scratching at the sensitive skin underneath. His muscles turned to pudding. The Black left their fledgling's skin - not their soon-fledgling, not anymore. She was
Lucius sat propped up on pillows. He stared at the balcony doors across from him with cold blue eyes. He
Draco pushed the door open. Shadow sat at the bench, his piano filling up all the space between the window and the bed. His body rocked forward and back with the relentless beat as his fingers pounded at the keys. Closing the door carefully behind him, Draco moved across the floor slowly. As the profile of his friend's face came into view, Draco's dread became a solid weight, transmuting into a heavy anger.
"They're kids and teenagers, Ron," Shadow admonished with a scowl. "Haven't you been listening to me at DA? I mean what I say there."
A click sounded and George looked up at his brother, took a deep breath, and pushed play. It worked! After a small section of silence, the recorder played for them the meeting that took place a few hours ago. They listened to Charlie describe the stats on the creature they had managed to put together. Unfortunately, the Dark magic residue was so strong that it interfered with surveillance spells, preventing them from seeing what happened. All they had to go on was what the Aurors and Healers had seen, and they hadn't seen much.
The mad witch actually smiled at this promise of pain. "Yes, my Lord. It will be as you wish." She bowed again and set off after the disappointing Death Eaters.
Draco flicked his wand and canceled the blinding spell. Blaise blinked at him and leapt to his feet, wand pointed at Draco's head. The now dark-haired teenager raised an eyebrow, but refused to lift his wand in answer. "Come one. It's me. They may try to impersonate me, but no one has my perfect diction, do they?" he teased with a smirk.
The school blinked and then burst into movement. Excitement and shock had students standing to watch as Shadow came away from the wall where most hadn't really noticed him. He walked smoothly forward and took a seat on the stool. The Hat came down on his head while everyone stared at their most feared professor as if they had never seen him before.
"Don't listen to them," Rodolphus growled. "They're trying to confuse you. They want to capture us. They'll take me and kill me."
"What about the wards?" Neville insisted, a bit desperately, knowing he was fighting a losing battle.
Shadow shook his head sharply once. There was no way he could talk about it. No way did he want to see it yet again. No. He wouldn't.
Severus attended more Order meetings now that he wasn't locked away working on his potions project. Shadow had tried to talk to Draco about Seraphim again, but chickened out twice. He couldn't bring himself to tell his friend what he discovered about the Peacock, either.
Draco said nothing to that absurd statement. He thought darkly of every sacrifice this war had required. His mother was dead. Lucius was insane. Shadow tortured himself just so he could keep his identity a secret and give stupid people hope. The students were being tortured by Death Eaters. The Ministry was arresting the good guys. People were dying. Draco, himself, was preparing to kill, to fight, to make choices that were not choices at all.
"I will leave you to discuss things," Alecto stood. Her shoulders were hunched and one arm was longer than the other, the curl of a black tattoo could just be made out below the sleeve. McGonagall clenched her jaw to prevent herself from barring her teeth.
He had walked through the quiet wood until his feet began to hurt, soaked through with snow. He found the tree and, at first, curling up inside had warmed him, but then night fell and it got colder and colder. Whimpering, he shook and chattered. There was no magic to help him. Stiff… numb… cold… helpless...
The sound of water running came through the door and Neville understood completely how his brother was feeling. He felt his own urge to bathe and scrub his skin until it was raw. Shivering, he wrapped his arms around his chest and turned to face the pounding of someone running up the stairs.
“Course." Shadow took another bite and stood. The Potions classroom was further away than Umbridge's office. He should leave early. He didn't even want to think about the detention with Umbridge. That woman was furious and whatever she had planned was sure to be worse now.
"Who do you belong to?" Seraphim asked lowly, raising his eyes to stare into Severus's hate-filled ones.
A person with this Animagus is prone to anger and often has a hot temper. A Wasp Animagus signifies a person who is often underestimated. They are fearless in the face of larger and seemingly deadlier enemies. Wasps live in swarms and working within a group makes them very formidable. Thus this type of person prefers working within a tight-knit community.
She sat behind a desk in a study in 12 Grimmauld Place. Ironically, the house the Order was making their headquarters out of was the Mutt's childhood home. Black didn't know, of course, but it wasn't like he could object. He was still an outlaw running from the Ministry.
Bella was already writhing in pain by the time he reached the bottom of the stairs as he whispered a generalized Cruciatus curse. He needed to practice if he were to find the right combination of spells for his faithless little Severus Snape. In fact, Voldemort would create a new spell just to make sure Severus suffered the full extent of the Dark Lord's wrath. He grabbed one of the fools and drug him into the center of the room.
"Where should we go then?" Draco asked anxiously. He also looked at Seraphim. The alter wouldn't feel safe in very many places and they had to be careful of who saw Harry like this.
“Yes." Severus nodded, smiling at Shadow's reaction. "Reardon Rookwood - Yes, the man from your vision. - also married a man, Henry Belvedere. They are still married. It cost Rookwood his status as the family Heir, the title instead passing to his younger brother, but he believed Henry was worth it."
"I had a dream… I was dreaming of opening Demon's door. Of letting him go free to destroy everyone who hurt me. I didn't care at all about those who would be caught in the middle. In fact, it made me exhilarated to think of everyone fearing me."
Umbridge smiled, accepting the challenge. She had tried to give the woman a chance, but obviously Minerva McGonagall had chosen her side and it was not with the Ministry. Nodding, satisfied with that cleared up, she tried to cast a drying charm. It didn't work. Blushing with embarrassment, she gathered her soaked robes around her and squished out of the Great Hall much to the amusement of the students. Krum and Lupin followed. The former scowling hotly at everyone and the later smiling with warm cheeks.
George mirrored his expression and stood gracefully, putting a hand on Shadow's shoulder. "Your secret is safe with us."
Hey guys, I know this is kind of a restatement of the canon chapter, but there are some differences that make this pretty important for how I'm developing this fic. I hope you liked it anyway! Like in this chapter, throughout this fic I'm going to be using stuff from the books and the movies for canon info.
I remember the old troll foot and the front door and the elf heads above the staircase. Even the intricate cut of the wallpaper that I'd trace just beginning to walk is familiar to me, as is that lovely family tree centerfold the second floor parlor. Oh yes, I thought it was
Just then, Madame Rosmerta runs out of The Three Broomsticks, her curly hair in disarray, “Albus! I just saw you appear, what’s happened to you?”
“Harry!” The girl shoves the both of them aside, placing a hand on Potter’s heaving chest. The sound of her cries grate at my ear drums. “I'm not letting you do this to yourself! When we deal with
Hermione nodded in agreement, her face set. "We could have everyone that still wants to do it after the meeting commit to a secrecy spell or something."
"Only games for fun.” Miles smiled sadly. "I have brittle bones. Have to take potions every month for it. I'm not allowed to play if the game is going to be too rough, but I'd love to be a Seeker."
Shadow and Draco stepped into the kitchen. Sandwich makings were spread out on the counter. Three sandwiches were already made, a fourth sat on a cutting board, a knife sat to the side. It had only partially been cut in half, the task abandoned. Omi was nowhere in sight. Shadow frowned and called for the little elf. Nothing happened.
Full night had fallen and they were all still standing around the oak tree when Omi appeared with a crack. "Master! Young Master Shadow and sir Neville have appeared in Master Shadow's bedroom, sir!"
When Griphook had said the Lestrange and Black vaults were next to each other, he didn't mean literally. They were on the same level, but they were on opposite sides of the track, separated by a large hall and a tethered dragon. They'd have to move quickly once they stopped. Harry took deep breaths in preparation.
He'd had no idea why Seraphim insisted on leaving the Chamber and had followed him fraught with anxiety, but now he had a good idea as to why the werewolf/dove Animagus had done so. He was hunting for food.
Draco opened his eyes and blinked at the bright morning light that flooded the room. He sat up with a yawn to find Shadow dressed and pulling on his shoes. "Where are you going?"
He also got a book from Severus about defensive shields and a small box of Basilisk scales from Shadow. They would be invaluable for research and other such things. Draco, of course, hadn't gotten Neville anything, but Omi bought him a state-of-the-art, magical toad aquarium.
Severus paled. This was the moment he had feared as soon as he learned of Harry Potter having Dissociative Identity Disorder. Of all the case studies he had read, it was very rare to find a person with separate identities working to the benefit of the whole. More commonly, the alters would war against each other for dominance, often sabotaging and suppressing their counterparts as much as they could. Desperate, still shaken from nearly dying, Severus flung his mind forward in a last attempt to wake his son.
They decided on an Italian restaurant. They were in Italy! Might as well enjoy the local cuisine. The food gave everyone their second wind, so when Shadow took them to a clothing store, they weren't too unhappy.
"You're safe. We have you," Remus murmured, crouching down so that he was closer to Neville and less threatening at the same time.
"Lillian won a duel last night against Tracey Davis." Rogan's eyes cut over to Draco. "Your year, I believe."
"There is a secret place that I want to visit," Draco spoke up. Seraphim turned and looked up at him unhappily. "We can come back here right after. Please, Seph? I really need to get something from Hogwarts."
Shadow nodded, hugged his brother briefly, and disappeared in a flash of floo fire, whispering the password to get into Grimmauld Place.
"Look! Look at him! He's possessed! He was dying! He should be dead! He's some kind of Dark Creature!" Lucius practically shrieked in his ear as Shadow rose from the ground, still missing chunks of his body, still twisted and broken, but shining with power and a horrible starving rage.
"No. He's busy. Besides, I don't need his permission." Shadow glared at him, reminding his friend he was still mad at him. "Are you coming with me or not?"
"By yourself?" Severus asked, arching an eyebrow curiously. "Do you see any grand romance or relationship on this great adventure of yours?"
"It means that the mutt just made Draco the Black Family Heir," Severus answered darkly. "If it's not too late, that will save Draco from the curse and protect him from further blood magic from Lucius."
Severus watched as Longbottom's eyes widened in happy surprise, his generous mouth pulling into a smile. Shadow didn't slow or acknowledge the other teen and Neville tensed. Severus looked for hurt, but the Gryffindor had merely realized he was not supposed to know Shadow yet. He turned away and hurried after his grandmother, not looking back.
Severus' eyebrows descended as he frowned, but before he could question the expression on Shadow's face, the teen morphed into his lynx form. Severus sighed softly and rose. The large cat didn't move as he approached, but the short tail lashed from side to side. Long fingers carded gently through the soft fur between the lynx's ears. It took a few minutes, but eventually the large cat relaxed and began to purr, eyes slitted with contentment.
‘We’ll get Artefacts and Objects in to have a look at it before we move it,’ Mendenhall declared. He glared up at Harry and then at Draco. ‘Go outside and catch a portkey back to school before this becomes even more of a circus.’
‘Did you know that the other houses were given a sexual education seminar in third year hosted by the prefects?’
Harry had dealt with that revelation the same way he dealt with everything he didn’t know how to comprehend and simply pretended it never happened. Draco supposed that revelation had probably made it easier for Harry to be the bold Gryffindor and finally make a move when he realised he wasn’t as straight as he’d always imagined, but that had been months later.
The pain was excruciating. The shouting of Order members looking for a desperate way to end a ritual that could not be stopped, drowned out by the sound of blood pounding in his ears.
Well, Ron had. Hermione had that look on her face that said she was letting him put her off for now, but they would be talking about it later.
It wouldn’t be the first time. He dearly hoped it was the first time the idea had been brought about by a suit of armour charmed to incite lust.
Luna said it had always been there between them, that the attention they’d had for each other had so often eclipsed everything else it was a wonder they’d not noticed sooner. Luna had painted their obsession in a way that created a whole different picture. She’d made Draco’s jealousy of Ron and Hermione apparent in so many of his past actions. She’d placed Harry’s obsessive notice of Draco into a whole other context.
And alright, maybe he was still angrier than he wanted to admit but he was perfectly within his rights to be and Draco certainly wasn’t going to tell him not to be. Ginny had even told him he should be angry for as long as he wanted and then a bit longer just to let Ron suffer. She might have been willing to talk to him and help him work through his own problems but that didn’t mean she didn’t want to punish him.
Harry didn’t wince in sympathy as he might once have done because Hermione had a point. Harry didn’t always like doing his homework, he always struggled with the research aspect of things which Draco had theories about. Draco had a lot of theories – and damn if he wasn’t right most of the time – that tied back to Harry’s time with the Dursleys and the woefully impractical nature of magical studies and sometimes derailed into a musing ramble about penmanship and ink drying.
Hermione stopped giggling to glare at Draco. ‘That’s not what I said.’ She turned to Harry. ‘It’s just that we’ve been friends for so long, we do go out, but we’ve always gone to the Three Broomstick’s or just eaten a meal together, it’s not like that’s changed.’
‘I can’t exactly give you advice on making it good,’ Harry laughed uncomfortably. He could give Hermione plenty of advice, but he was not at all ready to have that conversation with Ron. Or Hermione for that matter because thinking about who she’d be using those tips on made his brain want to leak out of his ears.
When Hermione had first proposed going to Australia, four months had seemed like no time at all. With all the things going on at the Ministry, with all the Death Eaters still to be rounded up and the repairs needed at Hogwarts, there’d been so much to do that four months had seemed just a blink. A mere moment before they’d be back and starting their futures together.
After the first war, when Voldemort was little more than a bodiless spirit living off rats, the Dark Mark had faded from the arms of his followers, enough so that people like his father had been able to lie and pay to keep out of Azkaban. Voldemort hadn’t liked that, had made a point of favouring those who had gone to Azkaban rather than renounce him. As punishment he’d made changes to the spells on his Mark. The one Draco had on his arm would never fade. He would forever bear the mark of his terrible choices.
Ginny who had almost lost two brothers to Malfoy’s cruelty (and his stupidity) had joined Luna and Malfoy at the Ravenclaw table more than once and although there was never the same ease between them, there was none of the hatred or the contempt that Hermione felt flare up whenever she saw Malfoy acting as though the war had never happened.
While he moved on to deal with the third Death Eater, Harry used a combination of charm-speaking and sonorous to lull the remaining muggles into a trance which would make it easier for the aurors to interview them and for the obliviators to eventually do their jobs. Once they’d all been cleared of spells and curses by healers, of course. But making them pliant and susceptible would make healing them easier. He’d seen it before, how muggles would become agitated and terrified when healers tried to help them because all they’d known of magic until help arrived was pain and fear.
Arriving back at Grimmauld Place, Severus parted from Shadow, who went upstairs to put his things in his trunk and conspire with the twins most likely. The Potions Master made his rounds of the house, observing the Order members he came across and the Gryffindor students in residence. He wanted as much time as he could observing them since he knew his son was considering making them part of his own inner circle of trusted friends.
"Humor me. What would you appreciate in a partner?" Severus tilted his head forward to stare at his son intently and making it clear he was serious.
"They associate my lynx to Harry Potter not Shadow Snape," he remembered. He'd gone in to the Department of Mysteries as a lynx and got down the prophecy. "I hope no one saw me."
"Think about it. It makes sense! That boy grew up hidden. Why? Just to keep him safe from Death Eaters? That level of absolute isolation and secrecy seems a bit extreme. That creature's like nothing we've ever seen before. It's not natural. It was
"What happened to them?" Shadow asked, tears finally spilling as Severus's pain clawed into his own chest.
Sturgis Podmore was next. "I and my small team are in charge of security here and at the Burrow, our secondary base."
The teen gratefully climbed out of the bath. Warm fluffy towels waited for him and he gently patted himself dry. All the scars scattered around his body looked like the one on his arm. Pleased, he grabbed his clothes and got dressed.
"Okay," she whispered, again so quietly Shadow almost didn't hear her. She shut her eyes and curled into a tiny ball, burrowing into the nest of blankets.
"I'd like to keep her longer. I've found old wounds that I want to be sure have healed correctly. The poor dear." Poppy smoothed Marissa's long hair from her sleeping face. Unlike Draco, the mediwitch had spelled her asleep to prevent her from becoming distressed during the check-up.
"Hey," Draco called gently. He knew from past experience that touching his friend in the middle of a nightmare was
Bellatrix crawled forward. The marble under her hands and knees was chilled despite the blazing torches all along the hall. Red eyes pierced through her back as she crossed the long distance to the single throne-like chair and the being resting in its embrace.
After breakfast, Shadow went to the library and worked quickly on all the homework he had for all his non-Slytherin classes, so far that amounted to Charms and Transfiguration. All the while, he kept glancing at the Map, trying to memorize who was hanging out with who, where they went and when. He did notice that Draco was with Crabbe, Goyle, and Blaise most of the morning and hoped things were going well.
The smaller male made unintelligible sounds that Seraphim promptly ignored. Obviously his soon-mate was feeling uncommunicative. That was okay. He'd take care of them. He sniffed the air and instantly found what he was looking for. Their fledgling was close. He moved toward one of the openings and deeper into the maze-like warren.
"He's just very busy," Draco said a bit desperately. "And he doesn't like to go away, even if it is for Angel."
She stared at him, clearly unsatisfied, but she decided to accept that answer. "If you are not aware, Miss Alecto Carrow has taken over the position of Potion Professor, as well as Head of Slytherin House. I would be grateful if you checked on your former students. I fear they do not feel comfortable coming to me or the Deputy Headmistress."
Draco handled it much better and answered coolly, "We stayed up late studying and happened to fall asleep." Never mind the fact that if he had his way, his very pleasant dream wouldn't be just a dream but a reality. It took all his control to keep such thoughts from his face.
"Ginny found out," Neville spoke for his brother when Shadow hesitated. They both knew how this would sound. "She told Shadow if he didn't tell you guys, then she would."
"He was… He was…" He couldn't say it, so he settled by answering, "Yes. It was something he's done to me. Nothing new." Shadow shook his head hard, frustrated and afraid, hating both. He staggered back and sat at the edge of the tub. He still kept his eyes tightly shut. He couldn't bear to see his father even though he knew there wouldn't be disappointment or disgust in his eyes.
"Y-y-yes, My Lord… Of course, My Lord… I'll t-tell you everything I know, My Lord…" Rookwood babbled, his eyes wide and staring, hypnotized with dread.
The blond turned his attention back to his friend. The jealousy simmered down, leaving the warm steel feeling of protectiveness and gentle waves of concern. "Are you okay, Shadow?" Draco frowned, noticing his friend's pale face. "Did he do something to you?"
"That's good," Tonks smiled up into his eyes, her own eyes changing color to match his. "Can we talk? I need to speak to you."
Flashes of all his previous birthdays sped through Shadow’s mind, reminding him of the hurt, despair, and dark bitterness that usually surrounded this day, but then he was remembering his thirteenth birthday. It was the first time he had celebrated the day of his birth and was actually grateful he had been born. It was in this very room with the man standing before him.
"For as long as we deem it is needed," he was answered. "Do you give your oath to obey these restrictions, Severus Snape?"
It felt like being slowly wrapped in layers of warm flower petals, Shadow decided, his thoughts becoming a bit hysterical. That warm… affection - He couldn't bear to call it anything else! - that he sensed in others, that he had studied at Severus's demand - when directed at you, it felt like giant flower petals. Pliable and silky soft, like a huge tent falling down around you - inescapable.
"I can believe that." Shadow laughed bitterly and turned to continue on to the dining room. "Right now I need to eat. Then I'll summon Severus. After that… I don't know. We disappeared from the Grimmauld Place. I have no idea how to explain that away. You were seen at the hospital. You defended me. They'll think you were in on it and will probably put a price on your head. They might even be able to find out I was the freaky-ass dark creature that gruesomely murdered people and who could shoot multiple Killing Curses out of its fingers. An extermination squad will no doubt be after me."
There were various reactions to the article. For the students, most were presented with the fact that this wasn't a game. People were fighting and dying. Some of the students had already lost family and loved ones. The fact that the new Minister had declared Martial Law reassured them, but it also frightened them.
being with him. I like it." He sighed tiredly. "The first time we made out he freaked a bit, worried he hurt me or went too fast. I
Severus hesitated. He knew how dangerous it was to share information about Shadow without Shadow's permission, but it was vital that Remus understand the importance of this. "Unfortunately Longbottom's opinion matters greatly to my son," he snarled. "Should the stupid boy reject Shadow, I fear irrevocable harm will result."
Draco straightened his hair and robes, and returned to his spot in the circle. He glanced around the group, feeling the wondering eyes on him, and he felt smug. Draco met Theo’s gaze and nodded to him. He made a mental note to make that special fertilizer potion that Theo had been after him to brew at the next opportunity.
“No,” I say firmly. My hand grips the table tightly and I can feel that anger again. Hermione leans forward.
With a sigh, I let my head fall onto hers, and it's a comforting heat, until she pulls back and I feel Ron’s eyes on me, or more specifically Hermione and me.
I watch Arthur, Ginny, and Fred help George and Hagrid inside carefully, Ron holding Molly back lest she keen over, and I wonder; how is it that, even when we’ve taken every precaution, everything can go so wrong?
Draco was handling things much worse. He was still as a statue and just as pale. His long fingers were clenched in his lap to hide their shaking. He knew the Dark Lord was powerful and skilled in the Dark Arts, but he was still human. Still Pureblood. He had been shocked to discover through Shadow's letters that the Dark Lord was just a Half-blood with delusions of grandeur. But still, the Dark Lord was powerful and dangerous, so it didn't really disturb him as this new realization did.
"We need to hurry," Neville spoke. Draco jumped, startled. He hadn't noticed the quiet Gryffindor standing there. "We still need to find Professor Snape."
Tears flooded Boy's eyes and the child put his knuckles in his mouth to suppress his sobs. He keened as he rocked backward and forward. Draco covered his eyes with a shaking hand to hide his own tears at the sound.
Coiled and tense, ready if the man should try to kill him again, Shadow watched as the man collapsed backward against the wall. He wasn't screaming as much, but that may because he didn't have enough air. Blood was foaming up around his lips and spilling down his chin. Shadow's chest was burning… BURNING… Hissing with agony, he couldn't figure out how the man was still hurting him. He tensed to spring forward again…
"Hurt," Seraphim rasped, ignoring the blond's reaction. It was what he expected from Boy. He gripped Draco’s hair firmly but gently at the back of his head.
"I'm not sure anyone can stop it for good. The only way to do that is to get Demon out of my head." Shadow pulled away and walked back to the bed.
Her hazel eyes never blinked or left the dark ones before her. It made Severus uncomfortable and uncertain. Had she changed her mind about his innocence?
"Lunch is in a few minutes," Draco drawled, eyes pinned on the centaur, the spiked feeling of jealousy and protectiveness lashing around him.
Fred and George looked both ways down the hallway. The coast was clear. Fred hurried forward and walked boldly into the strategy room, ready with a joke if someone was in there, but it was empty except for a large oval table with about ten chairs around it. It was covered in three dimensional magical maps while timelines were posted on the walls.
He quickly signaled his twin, and George slipped silently into the room, shutting the door behind him. He stayed there, listening and watching. He'd whistle if someone approached. Fred hurried over to the potted plant in the corner. He gently unwrapped a small microphone, a Muggle bug, from the base of the trunk near the dirt and uncovered the recording device buried deeper.
"They'll interrogate him," Draco muttered darkly. He remembered his own round with Charlie in the interrogation room.
Later that night, someone else in the castle was being closed in upon, but unlike Minerva who was being hunted by outside forces, Shadow was being hunted by himself…
Shadow allowed the official to come forward and take the blood sample and he showed them his new wand. That done, he stood and bowed. Severus inclined his head, but before they could move to leave, another man spoke toward the back.
"Okay," Shadow said slowly, eyes serious. "How much pain are we talking about? Enough to bring Seraphim to the surface?"
"I know." Shadow rubbed at his eyes, his head hanging tiredly. "I wish I never went to Neville's. I wish I didn't say those things."
Her expression cleared and lit with childlike joy. "Angel!" She jumped from the couch and rushed into his legs, wrapping her arms around his upper thighs in a tight hug.
"We can't do that without Potter," Draco drawled. He pushed his way through the crowd so he stood at the opposite end of the table from Harry and Charlie. "Even I know that."
Cory was Harry Potter's friend and teacher, not Shadow Snape's. Sighing, the teenager took a seat at the table and rubbed at his forehead, trying to suppress the migraine that was building. It was going to be difficult keeping his two identities straight. He'd already slipped up with the Slytherins back at school. He couldn't make that kind of mistake again.
Shadow flinched away from the blazing light falling across his face. Groaning, he opened his eyes to find his curtains wide open and his brother staring outside. "Nev?"
As they were walking home, Seraphim noticed the red welts on Draco's hands from holding the chains on the swing. He quickly used his White magic - at least that's what Draco told him was its name - to heal it. Normal people had light or dark magic, but Seraphim was special. He had White magic and Black magic. The memory of Draco telling him he was very special still made him smile.
"You're in Seventh-year DADA and Potions," Draco replied with a smirk. "If a Seventh-year took their OWLs again, of course they would get Os. The real question is, what will you get on your NEWTs?"
"Lupin explained that your body is almost oversaturated with magic," Draco answered carefully. "The balance is very, very fragile and as the magic becomes less necessary and pushed out as your physical systems take over their rightful jobs, the balance can be disturbed. Seizures are not unexpected or completely avoidable, although Lupin is doing the best he can to sooth the transition."
"No." Draco met his friend's eyes, steel hard determination clear in his expression. "You just went through a very draining transformation and had a very bad shock. You need to eat. We have several Apparation jumps to make to get back to Hogwarts. I don't want you fainting halfway there."
"I don't feel bad that Demon killed them. I'm glad they are dead and I can know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they will never hurt me again, but… Not like that." He finally turned his eyes to his friend. "What Demon did to them… It was disgusting, Draco. It was monstrous. He tore them limb from limb,
An explosion of icy white erupted around Draco, encasing him in coldness, dousing his fevered skin. Buried, he lay in the silent embrace, listening to his own panting breaths. Then the sky broke free above him and hands were reaching, pulling him out. He looked up into Shadow's face and was transfixed. He had never…
"It was too intense. I couldn't think. It was amazing, but I want to be with you. To be able to focus on us and what's going on. I love you and being with you is more than about pleasure. It's about trust and sharing an experience." Draco paused. He desperately wanted Harry to understand, but it was hard to think of the right words. "It's better when we're both present. I want to touch you. I want to see your reactions. I want you to see mine. Do you understand at all?"
"Dumbledore left a message for you, Harry Potter, protected by my wards. Here." Godric raised his hands and a Pensieve shimmered into sight on the nightstand.
Harry grimaced. "He sees it as his pack and my pack. Draco and Marissa are his. You and Neville are mine."
"That's only true if you let it," Draco snapped. "You're Slytherin. Out think your enemies and change the situation to your advantage."
Draco nodded once and began to head toward Neville, obviously intending to go past him and leave the Chamber.
"The wicked never rest," the Animagus said with a wily grin. "Time to go. Portkey will be active in five minutes."
Shadow faced forward and wrapped his arms tightly around his waist. Draco copied the move, but leaned toward his friend so their shoulders pressed against each other, silently telling him he wasn't alone.
Draco slipped his hand free as he fell to the side. Shadow's face turned with him so they never lost contact, and Draco brought his soiled hand between them and licked at it. The bitter tang burst across his tongue and he felt his eyes widen with pleasure. It didn't taste good exactly, but it tasted like Shadow and sex and that had his nerves shivering anew.
"It's late. Here…” Severus went to his bedside and took out a potion from the nightstand. He gave it to Shadow and placed his hands on his shoulder's, squeezing tightly. "Return to bed and take this. We can't do anything about this tonight. You need sleep."
Shadow groaned and began to wake from the Stupefy spell. Neville held his breath, praying it really was his brother and not Seraphim. Unfortunately, his eyes opened revealing poisonous green. Luna gasped and stepped back as hate rolled off the teen.
"You must request a room to hide things in and the Room will provide a place filled with items. To the right, there will be a cabinet that is magically linked to a second. Go through one, out the other. Similar to the cupboards you and Potter-Snape spelled between the Chamber and Slytherin Rogan Harper's dorm."
Draco bent down and captured the full lips with his own. Pulling back, he grinned. "We'll be okay. I promise."
Draco nodded and quickly moved past him. He was down the stairs and out the front door in less than two minutes. He walked quickly down the street, wondering what he was supposed to do now when suddenly he was grabbed and Apparated away. Stumbling as his feet hit the ground once more, he spun with his wand ready.
The room was full of members waiting to be told how the raid went even though they all knew it had been a success. They suffered only one casualty, and Neville was obviously back with them. Sturgis was looking rather stiff-faced and so were his supporters.
"Of course," Severus said softly. "You are my son. I will do what I can to protect you and provide you with a stable and safe future."
The ocean representing his mind had swallowed him as he had sunk deep. Slowly all light had disappeared, the fish and sea-vegetation disappeared and still no doors. It had felt like he was sinking into a bottomless hole in the middle of his ocean floor. Suddenly struck with a deep fear, he had flailed for the surface toward the light. His alters were too deep now, too wild. He had no access to them, no control… It was a
"And it lit up! So I told her to put it down, but she wouldn't. She shoved me and ran off. I had to pay our tab and then I went after her. I bet she's been Imperiused!"
Shadow snorted at the phantom's antics. Now all he had to do was find the wayward Baron. At this time of the evening, he was usually in the tower across from the Ravenclaw dorms. He'd never really realized what that meant, but now it seemed tragic. Forever cursed to love from afar even though his love was within reach. Hopefully, he and the Baron could help each other out.
For the following three days, Shadow tried hard to act as though nothing had changed, but after his vision of Avery's death, the feeling that they were losing the battle only grew. It didn't help his stress level that he was supposed to tell Ron and Hermione the truth on Sunday. This was the last weekend before winter break, and if he didn't do it then, Ginny would do it for him.
"We won't," Ginny promised, glaring at her brother. She looked back at Neville with pleading eyes. "Can you tell us anything about what it was like?"
He needed to be doing something. It was driving him mad to run these stupid little infiltrations on the lackeys they'd been dropping off at the Ministry. He knew it was all for the public, to give them hope, and reveal his return, but it still felt like a waste of time. He wanted worthy opponents. Real Death Eaters, real victories. He felt hollow and desperate.
Death Eaters were at Hogwarts. Dark creatures who were connected to the Earth with a unique bond were off their hunting grounds and converging at the school. He could feel the struggle as humans clashed with humans, magic vied against magic. Memories of Dark Ages filtered through his mind and he moaned his denial. Such times were so hard on the Earth, on every single life. He wouldn't stand by and let another Dark Age come to pass. He wouldn't let the world be at the mercy of the same people who held him in that cell, who tormented him body and mind.
"Seph, why did you bring them?" Draco asked numbly. He had no idea what the alter had done, but if his suspicions were correct, then he'd just witnessed the impossible.
"Aurors arrived at Neville's. They knew Shadow had gone there and they must have found out he came from the village, too. They're searching the house now."
"It is a remarkable feature. It's a shame to conceal it," the man said with a frown, but he reached for the blue contacts nonetheless.
"Really?" Draco played along, smiling. He clasped his hands behind his back and surveyed the room with a regal air. "I suppose I will have to put this claim to the test. I'm certain Omi has not had to cook for someone with as refined tastes as I possess. Hopefully, he is prepared for the challenge."
However, instead of going to Italy, he had taken three portkey trips (just to make sure he wasn't being followed) all around England and was finally deposited in this tiny pub with a note informing him to walk up the dirt lane away from the village. Half exasperated at all the fuss and half glad he wasn't staying in this flea-pile of a Muggle town, Draco brushed off his white shirt and black slacks and followed the directions.
"Magic flared around us as soon as we stepped on the stones. We were temporarily blocked from a good portion of our magic. I'm not familiar with the specific spell or ritual used, but Karkaroff was ready and he launched a vigorous attack. I went down under a curse designed to unravel my leg. Albus lasted longer and looked to be recovering when Karkaroff became desperate and used the Killing Curse. Albus fell from the Tower.
"There are too many snorkblasts. I can't fight them all," she answered in a sing-song voice. "Don't worry, Neville. I can bend. I'll be okay."
"Shadow!" Neville called, getting the curly-haired teen's attention. Shadow, Ron, and Hermione looked up in surprise. "My Gran had experts come and trace your Apparation route back to the source. We know where you came from! She talking to the Order right now."
"It was about three this morning." Augusta shot her grandson a sharp glance when he looked about to protest. Neville felt the strength of that gaze and froze, trembling. Remus shifted closer to him, viciously suppressing the growl trying to rise in his throat. "I do not know his means of travel. I was awake and heard his steps in the snow outside the door. I opened it and let him in. I was unaware of any reason why I shouldn't. Is he wanted for some crime?"
Slowly, Draco began to swallow. It was self-defense. He couldn't breathe with the burning goop in his mouth. Blood flowed freely from his nose and eyes, from his ears. He arched and clawed at the blanket, desperate and afraid. Sirius continued to pour until the goblet was empty. He waited until the blond finished swallowing before laying him flat again. The golden shield pulsed once more before fading away. The power in the room slowly dissipated and Sirius stood, panting, beside the bed.
Foxes also are known for their ability to blend in with their surroundings. This type of person will be excellent at all kinds of camouflage, both physically and also mentally, keeping their own thoughts and intentions private in such a way that most other people don't even notice they are doing so. Because of this it is very hard to really get to know a person with this Animagus.
"Very well. I shall be back in two hours." Severus met Draco's eyes. "Come. We have things to take care of."
Next, there was discussion about how to find Draco and Shadow, as well as ways to make sure the Aurors wouldn't find the boys before the Order. Most of the suggestions were long-shots and dismissed out of hand.
"Do you think their insanity will hurt or help our cause?" she asked thoughtfully after a few seconds.
"So forget it," Draco answered seriously. "I'll take care of it. Don't worry about me. This is simple stuff."
"Just listen," he snapped. Closing his eyes, he took a deep steadying breath. "Seraphim, Demon or whatever… I always knew he was inside you. How could I not? Just hearing about what happened to you makes me so mad that my control slips. I can't imagine experiencing the horrors you have. I understand that rage and hate is dangerous. I saw with my own eyes what that uncontrolled fury is capable of. But as horrible as it was, I was still thankful. Thankful that you could still fight back, that you still felt you deserved to be angry about what happened to you. That you wouldn't let anyone hurt you like that again. I appreciate the power Demon holds."
Shadow rubbed subtly at his chest. His scar had been itching for the past couple days, adding to his anxiety. "You know what," he hissed. "This isn't working. We've been visiting pawnshops all week and we've got nothing! If Sirius and Draco didn't find anything, than we just exhausted the magical pawnshops in England and no one has seen the locket. What are we going to do? Include Muggle pawnshops? Search the world over?"
Everyone was cheerfully going about their shopping and games, excitedly proclaiming over new items bought and gossiping loudly. Couples walked down the cobblestone road, holding hands and sharing warmth, their faces and eyes aglow. Shadow even caught sight of Ginny and Neville through the window of the tea shop. They were talking seriously, but their hands were linked over the table. When Neville got up to get them more tea, he casually kissed her offered cheek, making her smile.
George almost flinched and immediately hated himself for that weakness. "What are you so afraid of that you won't teach us how to defend ourselves?" he demanded hotly.
Draco captured his hand and gently kissed his lips. Harry gasped, feeling sparks shoot down his body to settle pleasantly in his stomach. Draco lapped at the warm entrance, tasting the flavor that was uniquely his love's. It was delicious and addicting. Groaning, he pulled away, his mouth on fire. He wanted more, but he knew Harry was tired.
"I can't really explain everything," Harry admitted. "Draco has confided in me and I can't betray that trust, but basically he's in trouble. He's going to be at the bookstore on Diagon tomorrow at noon. He wants me to meet him there so we can talk. I need you to go for me. I want him to come here if he can, if you will allow it?"
Draco dove back into the Great Hall as a deadly cutting hex almost took his head off his shoulders. He'd been so focused on his grisly jobs that he'd forgotten the corrupted Slytherins could pose an equal threat. Crouched, wands in hand, Draco and Sirius peered around the corner only to see Goyle run forward with a bellow and punch Ron in the face. The beefy blond's left arm was boneless from the redhead's curse, but that didn't save Ron as the redhead fell over backward with a cry.
Shadow shivered against his father's hands, braced against his shoulders. Slowly his tears and the nausea lessened enough for Severus to stand and fetch some potion. Shadow downed the Calming Draught without hesitating. It blessedly cooled his racing thoughts and dampened his emotions.
The room was large. It had a four poster bed with thin curtains that matched the green curtains that covered the far wall. Grinning, Draco strode across the room and flung them open. Shadow gasped in surprise, his eyes wide.
"I'm saying you are safe here, and by the time school is over, the Ministry will have things in hand," Umbridge returned, her face losing its harmless expression.
"It wasn't just the books as you well know. She picked those particular texts to make it perfectly clear to me what would she could have happen to my father." His hand tightened unconsciously on Draco's shoulder, making the blond wince. Shadow stared down at the papers, his eyes gone completely cold. "Let's just say I don't take to threats well."
Severus walked quietly into his son's bedroom. His usually numb heart clenched as he listened to Shadow's helpless sobs from where he was curled around Draco protectively. Blood trickled from Draco’s nose and ears, was beginning to pool in his eyes. His chest labored to rise, his whole torso straining with the effort. His skin held a faint hint of yellow now. He was nearing the point of no return and Shadow hardly looked better.
"Nev, rest. I promise we'll find Shadow," Remus murmured, bringing the cloth over Neville's forehead and eyes. He bent closer, his mouth close to Neville's ear, and whispered softly, "Demon went to St. Mungo's last night. Lockhart and a few other people are dead. Draco activated Demon's Animagus form, so no one knows it was Shadow. The Ministry thinks it was a random Dark creature while the Order thinks it was sent by the Dark Lord as a test of its abilities. Aurors believe Draco was helping the creature and the Ministry has issued a warrant for his arrest. The Order is trying to find Draco before the Aurors do, so that they can ask questions and perhaps protect him from the Ministry. I was able to slip over to the house and Omi said Draco and Shadow are healthy. They rested and ate before heading back to Hogwarts. They're safe for now. Severus and Sirius are out of reach, working on the project at the cave, but as soon as I get a hold of them, I'll tell them to head to the school. Don't worry, cub. We'll figure this out."
Shadow shook his head, sending his curls bouncing. "No. It's just… All this shit is happening and all I can think about right now is…" He blushed and shook his head again.
The Fifth-years streamed out into the hall and ducked to the side as a unicorn made of golden light cantered past. Laughs and excited cries went up and soon they were all running after it toward the Great Hall.
"I came to tell you this and to do one other thing that I may not mention yet. As I said, I still hold to my beliefs and do not approve of Guiding."
"I was banished because I believed it my duty to help choose the path that will be taken. It goes against many of my beliefs because it is dangerously close to Guiding you, Chosen One, but I do not wish my children's children and their children's children to live in Dark Times. Guiding causes strife instead of harmony, but in this case, in these stars, there is choice, no set pattern yet. So I am not Guiding. I am Choosing. My herd does not fully understand that."
Hermione and Ginny came up on either side of him. They were sweaty and pale, but their hands were steady. Sirius stepped a little in front, a grin still splitting his face.
He could go to sleep. He could go away from all this and leave it behind. Seraphim shook his head. No. Then his Other would be awake and could get hurt. The Other could call him back. He'd have to face the hurt again. If he stayed, he could make sure he never hurt. That
will think of some other way to help him," Severus corrected. "I did not say I would not be of assistance. I merely wished to express my concern. Draco is Lucius's heir. If we were to hide him here against Lucius's will, we could not stop him from finding his son or this house."
Shadow followed Severus out of the phone booth and stepped inside the Ministry for the first time. He wasn't sure what he was expecting, but it wasn't what he was seeing. He stood in a very large rectangular hall, twice -maybe three times- larger than Hogwarts’ Great Hall. The deep indigo ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and changing like some huge stock-market board in New York. The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark wood and had dozens of gilded fireplaces that would have fit in any royal palace.
Severus sipped at his tea. He stood in the doorway of his bedroom, staring at his child sleeping cocooned in soft sheets. Longbottom had left around two o'clock that morning. It was now nearing ten. The day before had been traumatizing for all of them. Coming upon Shadow lying deathly still, heart barely beating, Longbottom crying over him, he had felt like his own soul would shatter into a million pieces.
"What?" Ron whispered, shocked, as Ginny burst into tears and buried her face in his chest. He held her reflexively, not really aware of what was happening.
He found Seraphim curled up in the corner of the bedroom. He was holding his legs and shuddering every few seconds, his green eyes wide still with fear. Draco tried to ignore it and concentrate on Neville, but he couldn't do it. He couldn't see Seraphim suffering and do nothing. Carefully, he crept forward, stopping three feet away when Seraphim tensed.
"She can't," Hermione snapped. "Of course she can't! The Ministry is elbowing their way in here and if she does anything too overt they could kick her out and take over completely!"
"Yes. Draco." Severus hoped he knew what he was doing. "I came looking for you because I was not sure he would be safe without you. Bad people are after him. They want to hurt him."
Shadow kept his face blank while Draco winced and pressed his back against the couch. He definitely didn't want to have this conversation again.
He didn't get a chance to finish. Severus had tensed rigidly in his chair and blood had drained from his face. Remus hadn't seen such a reaction from the man in a very long time and it portended something very grave indeed.
Two green eyes watched her back. "No. I'm not Seraphim. I'm still Shadow." Avoiding her disappointed look, he turned to Remus. "I need glasses. Do you think you could help me? Everything's really blurry, and it's giving me a headache."
Shadow ran into the main chamber, past the basilisk, until he came up to the foot of the statue of Slytherin. There was nowhere left to run. Panting, he spun around to see Draco running toward him. "No! Just no!" Shadow screamed in denial. "I mean it, Draco!"
Not at all inclined to draw things out, Olivander looked at Shadow's aura and went to fetch the most likely candidates. The first exploded the box Olivander brought it in. The second spit a single white spark before dying. But the third…
"The Baron told me where the diadem is. Now Sirius and I are going to stage a battle that makes the Baron appear heroic while I end up with the diadem. It should be destroyed in two hours," Shadow explained. "Will you watch Marissa until then?"
Severus watched the teen flee and sighed. He felt old. It wasn't the first time. He had long since become accustomed to the feel of a weary spirit and a weary body, but this time it seemed more than that. He wasn't worried about just himself anymore. He worried about the future and health of another, and it took a harder toll on him than he expected. He stood silently, watching his son's face while he slept, wondering when he would begin to twitch and twist from a nightmare, wondering what would torment his son this night.
Shadow rolled his eyes with a put-upon sigh and took Draco's book. The blond smiled faintly as he watched the tension drain from his friend's tight shoulders. Shadow caught the smile and gratitude shimmered briefly through his strange eyes before he began to mercilessly tease the blond every time he answered his questions wrong.
One brown eye, one golden went wide as Neville moved closer to the dais and stretched out his hand toward the veil. The lynx bounded down the steps and leapt. Neville staggered under the thirty-five pound weight, but continued to move forward without so much as a backward glance.
Shadow slowly opened his eyes. It felt like he was trying to break through the surface of a swamp. Lethargically, he tilted his head, trying to blink the blurry scene into focus. It was no good, but he was pretty sure he didn't recognize the place he was in. He was sitting on the floor, his back to a corner, but he could make out white carpet and cream walls.
Shadow's heart skipped a beat after reading this line. Suddenly, he felt certain he'd gotten in over his head, but his eyes were drawn almost helplessly forward.
Neville followed behind his mentor feeling tired. It wasn't one in the afternoon yet, but he felt completely worn down and, mostly, it was Draco's fault. The blond Slytherin scrutinized everything he did and found Neville lacking. It was exhausting, really.
"Okay." Harry took a deep breath and looked at Draco and Severus with a Sirius-like reckless grin. "Let's do this."
was that they knew of his power and were either going to try and steal it or somehow make him use it for them.
"Friends help remind us of what is truly important," Severus said, eyes watching his son very carefully. "They remind us what will be there when the war ends. They make sure there is enough left of you that you won't be lost when that time comes. Have you contemplated what you will do after the battle is over?"
Severus masked his furious expression and forced control over himself. It was exceedingly difficult. His heart was racing and his mind was on fire with everything he had learned. How could things go so wrong in only a few days? Breathing deeply through his nose, Severus forced himself to lock away his emotions in Occlumency pools. It was hard. The near death experience had worn away his self-composure and left him raw and volatile.
"I'm uncertain. Your control over when you switch has risen exponentially. Boy would invariably come Out before the last merge." Severus rubbed his potion-stained fingers over his eyes. "The readings I've recorded off the rabbits rated just above Cruciatus levels. It could differ in a human in either direction."
Rogan stared at his friend in shock. He'd felt helpless for so long, actually thinking of ways to fight back, even indirectly, seemed impossible.
George smiled and jumped on the bed, wrapping the teen up in a hug. Still blinking owlishly, Shadow just stared over the redhead's shoulder at Fred who was hovering in the open doorway. Grinning, Fred ran into the room and began tickling the tired brunet. The laughter and shrieks quickly drew attention. Ron, Ginny, Hermione, and Neville peeked in. They saw Shadow and the twins messing around and came into the room, shutting the door behind them.
"If you do not trust my word, consider this. I was once loyal, a part of his most trusted inner circle, and as many of you know, I have been driven to abandon my position. My only motivation was self-preservation. I have not grown soft or weak. I had an intimate view of the returned Dark Lord and what I saw convinced me of the danger of remaining affiliated with him.
Sirius sighed, wishing he could stay at the party. "No one knows how to have a good time anymore," he lamented.
Severus raised his hand, asking for a moment. "However, there was a strange message." He reached into his robe pocket and retrieved the note. Shadow took it, read it quickly, and then handed it to Draco who was once more sitting, this time much closer to his friend.
They both waved to the ghost and jumped down. The basilisk was just how they left it. It's venom so strong that it preserved the corpse and kept it from rotting.
Ginny hugged her brother. "They'll be fine. If anyone can take care of themselves, even against the Ministry, they can."
"We'll be able to do more once the Dark Lord becomes public and more active. Right now, his followers are quiet. We can't attack without an opening. That would only tip our hand," Severus pointed out. "I have been through a war. Waiting is a key aspect. The side that moves too recklessly, without thought, is often the side that will lose. So far casualties and destroyed property are very minor. That is something to be thankful for. We are using the time well preparing for every eventuality, stocking up on rations and healing potions, honing our fighting skills much as you have the DA doing, and gathering as much information as we can. These are all very important."
"Course not," Harry scoffed, disgusted and done with this whole conversation. He tried to lean away from Draco's hands, but the Slytherin held him still.
His head was spinning. Helplessness, anger, self-hate, and confusion warred with each other until he didn't know what he felt. He was afraid of himself and afraid of what would happen to him. Everything was falling apart, but Draco was still there. He said he wasn't leaving, and that added joy, surprise, and gratitude into the emotional hurricane tearing through him.
"I mean it, Fred.” Shadow narrowed his eyes. "A lot more is at stake now with trying to get this group off the ground. We can't afford the extra attention. It's time to lay low and protect our real interests; the defense group and something else I have up my sleeve."
If his soul compelled you to do evil things, that is more our sin to bear than it is yours when you were only an unwilling vessel."
Shadow approached classroom eleven during his free period before lunch. Daphne Greengrass, a fifth year Slytherin who had joined the DA last week, informed him at breakfast that Professor Firenze wanted to talk to him about something. Shadow stared at the door, not sure if he wanted to knock. On one hand, he was curious about the centaur. On the other, the Divination professor wanting to talk to him was never a good sign, but there was nothing he could do unless he wanted a detention, which he really didn't have time for.
She smiled and wrapped him in a hug, standing on tip toe to kiss his cheek. "I'm glad you came. I've missed you.” Neville turned beat red. "Come on.” She laughed and tugged him down the hall. “He’s probably in the library.”
"No." Sirius wiped at his face and stood. "I think I remember my brother, Regulus, having it last. I checked his room, but it wasn't there. I thought maybe…" He gestured around at all the disturbed boxes and trunks.
"The one who saved you," Remus spoke gently. He reached over and stroked the teen's messy hair once. "We understand, Harry. We will support any decision you make."
Narcissa nodded and calmly strode from the room. Her pace quickened as soon as she was out of her husband's sight. She hadn't much time.
"I'll be there as soon as I get out of my detention.” Shadow heard a loud snort and looked up to see Ron glaring in disgust at Hermione who was blushing furiously. Shadow glanced at Krum and saw him scowling down at his notes. He smiled. "How's that working out?"
All eyes turned to Severus. The Potion Master shook his head, to everyone's relief. "Returning to your now natural form will cause pain, but not to the level of the first change."
Slowly, the grand castle came into view. The path they had walked wound gently over hills, skirted the looming Black forest to the right while down to the left the lake shimmered as light struck the still waters. It brought back memories, Hogwarts did, but the darkness of the previous night instilled an ominous sense to the otherwise peaceful scene.
"I thought I'd, ah, come early to, um, set up a few things," she stuttered nervously in explanation.
McGonagall settled back in her chair with a tired sigh. She wondered how many more of these conversations she'd have as more names appeared on the death tallies. She hoped not many. Closing her eyes, she allowed herself to rest. Just for a few minutes.
"Remember spring, remember winter doesn't last forever." Luna smiled brightly and stood, offering her hand. "Come on, Neville. Let's go plant your tree."
"I'm not Harry anymore, if I ever was." His brother pulled away with a Snape-ish smirk. "I'm Shadow Harold Lilium Snape. Nice to meet you."
Shadow sat bolt upright, gasping and sobbing. Without thinking about it, he flung himself at Draco and clung to him, hiding his face against his broad shoulder. He almost whimpered in relief when Draco's arms curled around him and pulled him snuggly against his chest. They rocked slowly as Shadow's heart calmed and the nausea and terror began to fade.
"Good." Severus allowed a small smile of his own. It looked like Shadow's new wand was even better suited for him than the old one. "How much?"
"I'm Robert Caldwell. I believe you barrowed my son, Owen's, appearance to go to the Quidditch World Cup a couple summers ago."
They followed the Headmistress upstairs. She opened the fifth door on the right and revealed a bedroom. It had a desk, a dresser, and a four poster bed. The walls were a red-brown color and the floors a dark wood. The comforter and pillows counteracted the dark theme with their rich deep yellow color, the sheets were white.
"Don't you dare," he warned darkly with a tone of voice he had never heard from himself before. He almost sounded like his father.
Everyone jumped and scrambled to begin. Ron was in the middle of filling his cauldron with water when he noticed Hermione's stunned expression. She hadn't made a move to start brewing and Ron couldn't ever remember a time when she hadn’t jumped at the chance to do school work.
Shadow was pleased. He had already thought that the feud between Gryffindor and Slytherin, though sometimes entertaining, was mostly a hindrance. Out from under the watchful eyes aimed at him and the expectations thrust at him for being Harry Potter, he was free to maneuver in a way he never had been before. It was exhilarating!
"Great!" Fred leapt from the bed and marched two doors down to Shadow's room. He didn't bother knocking and just flung it open. "Shadow!"
"Was it Demon again?" Severus asked, deeply worried. He hadn't seen Shadow like this in a very long time. There was a hint of Boy in the depths of his eyes and Rose. It still surprised him, even now, to be faced with such fragility when Shadow was usually so capable and resilient; Silas and Gabriel were strong in him.
"Brother," Seraphim sneered. He crouched down and grabbed the teen, making Neville gasp and try to get away, but the alter's grip on his shirt was too firm. "I don't care about fathers or brothers," he growled. "I don't care about this Other me."
Shadow flushed. This conversation was getting more difficult, but he didn't want Severus's praise when it was undeserved. "I'm not all that over my fears," he confessed softly. "I walked in on Hermione and Ron kissing." He took a deep breath, pushing past the remembered feelings watching them had evoked. "It made me feel sick. Like what they were doing was disgusting. In general, I still feel that way about…" He bit his lip, wringing his hands. "… you know, sex."
"Cissa," Lucius rasped, his blue eyes cracked open. He pushed his head into the pillow as pain gripped him. "Potion…"
"We arrived in a dark graveyard and came upon the scene of a complex, Dark ritual. Diggory was already dead, used in the ritual. A crowd of Death Eaters, who had answered the summons already, stood in a circle. Karkaroff and I pushed through to find the revived Dark Lord battling a battered Potter.
Due to Neville's height of nearly six feet and being raised off the ground, stretched against the wall, the Gryffindor had to stare down several inches to meet the man's eyes.
"Yes, my prince.” Harry gave a mocking bow and laughed when Draco threw a punch at his shoulder. Harry easily stepped out of range and gestured grandly at the dinning room to the left, across from the sitting room. "This is where we eat most of our meals. Lately I've been forced to eat in bed, but I've been released to use the room again. We will come here for lunch. Our single house elf, Omi, is a charming and talented cook."
Draco shot Severus a worried glance and followed. He didn't say anything as he stood by Shadow's shoulder and watched Omi make them some roast beef sandwiches. Things were not going as well as they had hoped when they'd gone back to school in September, just three and a half months ago.
Hermione knocked softly on her boyfriend's office door. She knew she shouldn't. He was her teacher now, for goodness sake! But she
"Yeah. I think I do," he said softly. "I'm sorry, Draco." His arms snaked up his lover's back and he held him tightly.
"You may not. It would be seen as indirectly pushing people to discover the Horcruxes," the man answered solemnly.
Remus fought back a snarl. "You don't need to threaten me, Severus," he said coldly, his voice tight with the effort to control himself. "I can imagine how hard this is for Shadow. I will not do anything to hurt him."
