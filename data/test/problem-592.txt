Harry’s smile broadened and he nodded. “Yeah, I’d like that.”
Draco stepped passed Harry into the room, taking in his new surroundings. The room was smaller than he’d expected (that was something else he’d need to get used to, there was no such thing as extension charms in the Muggle world) but it was cosy enough. His eyes fell on the king-size bed that seemed to fill the otherwise modest room and his heart began to thud a little harder. Despite how stressful his introduction to Muggle London had been, he was reminded why he’d wanted to come on this trip in the first place. Dropping his trunk and bag, he turned to face Harry and found him leaning against the closed door. There was a nervous energy about him now and his breathing was a little ragged, like he’d just run a few laps. His hands were tucked behind his back like he was shy, but the way he was looking at Draco, his expression was one of hungry intent.
Home. Harry couldn’t help but grin at that. “That’s the plan, yeah.”
Draco smirked. “Better than a kick in the teeth.”
“Never mind
Harry chuckled but thought better than to continue winding up his best friend: he knew that Ron had been teased mercilessly from a young age for being too tall and gangly, his hand-me-down clothes, and flaming red hair. While he had grown into his looks over the years, his physical appearance had always been a sensitive topic of discussion and he still couldn’t help but take people’s opinions to heart.
Myrtle, however, didn’t sound as though she thought that would be a shame at all.
“The door’s over there,” Draco pointed out. “Feel free to leave if you like.”
“Harry always looks so peaceful when he sleeps,” she sighed. “Like only in his dreams can he shed the weight of the world from his shoulders.”
“Like a big baby throwing a temper tantrum because I’ve made friends with someone that you don’t like.”
“Oh Ron, you look
“Well, we still have a few places left to see.” Hermione unfolded her list and read it aloud. “We still have the visit to Camden Market, London Zoo, Madame Tussauds and the Sherlock Holmes museum.” There was a collective groan from the boys but Hermione looked unperturbed. “Come on, it’s not that bad!”
“Don’t cry, Mum,” Ron implored, patting her gently on the back as she cried into his shoulder. “You’ll see us again soon enough. Christmas is just around the corner.”
Ron frowned. “The what now?”
Harry beamed. “So, you admit that we’re friends now?”
“No,” Draco lied.
“I’m so glad that you all enjoyed it!” said Liv happily. “Although reading Shakespeare is a pleasure in its own right, seeing it performed like that is something else entirely. It transcends the work.”
Evidently set to destroy as much of the paperwork as possible, Liv ignored the interruption and proceeded to slash her wand through the air several more times, determined to set alight every last piece of paper. As the flames leapt higher, feverishly devouring the names and locations of every Muggle-Born that they had on record, Liv grinned maniacally to herself at what she had done before collapsing to the floor, coughing and gasping for what little air remained in the sealed room. The fire encircled her, trapping her in the centre of the room as the flames began to emit copious amounts of black smoke that choked her, but she didn’t care. She wouldn’t unlock that door for anyone.
“Alas, duty calls,” she lamented. “Well, best of luck with your first lesson.”
Harry snorted. “I appreciate that you’re trying to keep the insults to a minimum.”
He carefully slipped his glasses off and sat them on his lap before tossing his last missile across the ward. Draco laughed loudly as Harry missed the overflowing bedpan by a good meter.
“At least I’m willing to admit it,” Draco countered. “You like to pretend that you hate it, but I know deep down you get your jollies out of everyone cheering you on. Whether it be on the Quidditch Pitch or the battlefield, it doesn’t matter so long as everyone is singing your praises.”
“Hello, darling,” she sighed. “Oh, how I’ve missed you.”
“Soon,” said Harry. “I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know? Ron still has it in his head that Ginny and I are going to get back together.” Seeing alarm flash across Draco’s face, Harry reassured him, “That’s never going to happen.”
“I thought you said we were meeting at eight,” he grumbled.
Liv’s mouth twitched. “Just doing my job, sir.”
“Of course I am, but I don’t think that you are,” said Draco hotly. “If you can’t convince me with that kiss, how are you supposed to convince an audience?”
It was still strange to Draco, why Harry was talking to him. He just couldn’t understand it. People didn’t want to be seen in his company, and he couldn’t blame them. He was Draco Malfoy, after all. Slytherin, ex-Death Eater and social pariah of the magical world. He wasn’t worthy of anyone’s time. Well, nobody except Harry, apparently.
Harry couldn’t argue with that. Although he was a little miffed at the deception, ultimately, he was glad that their little tryst remained private. Draco checked his reflection in the mirror and straightened his shirt, looking very pleased with himself.
-	Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear? -  She finally asked Hermione.
Harry abandoned what he was doing and ran to the kitchen to start his aunt breakfast. His aunt was unusually early so he hadn’t had the time to prepare it. Like he predicted 20 minutes later Petunia was entering the kitchen to have her food.
Both boys kept  quiet for the rest of the trip, the silence only being broken when the train finally arrived at the station and Harry asked for Opal to return to him because they had to leave the train, which she did rather reluctantly, saying she wanted to see the nice boy again. Harry ended up promising her that he would ask Malfoy if he had any free time to spend with her. Both boys left the compartment and headed out, to hear a female voice calling for the first year students.
-	It is NOT a lie! - said Harry getting even madder. - I saw him, I fought him!
Any one can notice that what happens in the DADA class is almost entirely taken out of what happens in the books, so credits to the books.
A dark skinned boy, introduced himself as Blaise Zabini, offered to show him were the fifth year dorms were located, Harry nodded his head and followed the boy up the stairs, to a room filled with 6 beds, his belongings were already in front of the third bed counting from the door. The boy thanked Zabini for the help, and headed to his bed. Once inside the comfort of the closed curtains, that the beds in the Slytherin dorm also had, Harry allowed himself to take a deep breath and think about all that happened that day.
By the way, if anyone here knows how to change the type of letters, like making them in bold , italic or underline and stuff like that, could you please explain to me how to do that.
-	And you believed him because? – Harry asked.
He headed outside with Onyx and Opal wrapped around his arms, if people looked out their windows and saw Harry would think the boy had gotten tattoos in both arms. Once they were outside both snakes slithered down his arms to the grass. It wasn’t their ideal habitat but they sounded very happy to be out of the terrarium.
“It’s okay. I liked it. It felt good.” Said the other boy going even redder. “I’m going back to my bed. Good night and sweet dreams.” Harry said while getting up.
-	Good! -  said Professor Umbridge. - I would like you to turn to page five and read “Chapter One, Basics for Beginners”. There will be no need to talk.
-	And what good’s theory going to be in the real world? - said Harry loudly, his fist in the air again, he was getting mad with all the dismissing the teacher was doing.
-	Alright then. – Was Harry’s only response.
-	Weasley. - said Ron.
“Yes, Professor” Harry said while taking a scroll and an ink pot of his bag.
When Friday came, Harry was dreading the day. He had a felling something was going to go wrong. Seeing as it was a free day and Harry had already done all home work he let himself stay in bed a few more hours, which made him miss breakfast. Draco was nice and brought him a glass with pumpkin juice and a croissant. He spent the rest of the day, until only 15 minutes were left to 5 PM, with his new friends.
1- In my mind both Sirius and Remus call Harry pup as an endearment.
I hope you like the chapter.
-	Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves? – asked Professor Umbridge in the falsest calm voice
-	It’s okay. Hugs and petting my hair are things that I’m not really used to, but it fell kind of nice for the few seconds they lasted. – Harry said, his face turning deep red. – It’s rare for me to receive hugs, but it was nice. Just warn me first the next time you decide to hug me, please. I don’t like being touched that much.
-	And your name is? - Professor Umbridge asked.
-	Harry, pup, Snuffles was unable to be here for obvious reasons, so he sent me in his place. He wants me to give you a hug and wish you good luck for your school year in his place. And he begged me to ask you if he did anything wrong for you not to want to spend the summer with him. Dumbledore told us you wanted to be left alone and Snuffles is blaming himself for not being there in the end of the year when everything happened and he taught you were mad at him and didn’t want to see him. He spent all summer worried about you and really wanted you to be there. I hope you know that he loves you very much and he wished you had accepted his invitation to be there this summer. The house as full all summer with the Weasley’s coming and going and Hermione and some other people, but we all missed you. I and Snuffles just want you to know that. – Said Remus with a sad face – He asked me to give you this as your birthday present, he wanted to give it to you in person but you weren’t there so I’m giving it to you now. Don’t open it now, open it later when you are inside the train. All you have to do is say his name and he will listen and talk to you. Seeing as we don’t have more time, please write me a letter telling us about how you spent your vacations and if you want to tell Sirius something you can send the letter in the same envelope, I’m staying with him for the some time now and I know he really wants to hear from you. Now go or you will miss the train.
After that the girl walked to one of the carts and entered it, followed by Harry since most had already started their way to Hogwarts and there weren’t many left. The girl introduced herself as Luna Lovegood, which he recognized the last name from the magazine The Quibbler. When he asked her if she was related any way to the editor of the magazine she said that she was his daughter.
-	 There, now! - Said Professor Umbridge in her squeaky voice - That wasn’t too difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.
The summer was almost like second year all over but even worse, that summer the twins and Ron had rescued him, but this time they hadn’t cared enough to try it again. He started crying over this thought. His friends didn’t really care about him if they really believed something like that so easily, just like last year when Ron had been mad at him for so long because he didn´t believed Harry was saying the truth.
When he was already finished in the kitchen he went to his room to change his t-shirt for a tank top, since it was abnormally hot for the weather at 8:30 AM.
“Dear Harry,
The Charms class, they shared with the Ravenclaws again, had also occurred without any problems and when it ended Harry was dragged away by Draco to finally talk. They found a classroom that by the quantity of dust in the desks and shelves hadn’t been used in a while.
-	Oh, yeah? - Said Harry, he really was getting pissed off with Professor Umbridge behavior –
-	Would you like to go outside? – Harry asked to his little snakes.
4th of September 1995
-	Are you sure, you don´t look that fine. – She said in a worried tone – Did your vacations go well?
“Harry, there you are, I’ve been looking all over for you. Your little babies were going crazy. I think they were looking for you, so I have been looking for you all over the place.” Harry turned when he heard his name be called, only to see Draco running in his direction. When the boy arrived, he supported his hands in his knees trying to catch a breath. “Hello, Granger. Here they are.” The boy said while sitting next to him and pushing his sleeves up, letting the little snakes out in the grass. “Hey, Harry did you get hurt, you smell a little like blood?”
The aggressive knocking on his door forced the half asleep Harry to leave his thoughts behind and get up to go and make breakfast for his uncle that needed to live for his work. Fifteen minutes later uncle Vernon was leaving the house and Harry was in the middle of cleaning the Kitchen. Aunt Petunia would get up around 9:30 AM and Dudley would only get up way past 11 AM, which would give him enough time to star with the list of chores he had that was left for him in the fridge door.
2. Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic can legally be used.
Blaise started to raise in his seat, but Harry informed him that it was an important conversation and that it was private. Blaise reluctantly sat down again and let him go alone. In the last week, Blaise had been following like a puppy follows its master whenever Harry had to go anywhere outside the common room alone and he suspected that was because the boy was the only one that had never interacted with him before his house change, so all the others agreed that he was the most likely to not bother Harry in terms of being followed by.
The weekend passed and Harry had spent it almost always in his room/bed, only leaving at night after curfew to walk a little, go to the kitchen eat the lunch and dinner he had missed and also think some more than he already was thinking. Harry also used this opportunity to show the school to his little snakes. He didn’t want to talk to his friends, not sure of what to say to them. He was also kind of afraid to face the other Slytherin kids. He knew the Slytherin kids of his year didn´t like him, maybe by Malfoy’s influence, very much and in full honesty he didn´t like them back, again by the way Malfoy behaved around him. The fact that the man that killed his parents used to belong in the Slytherin house was another thing that bothered him. He avoided thinking about that, because it leads him to think that maybe, just maybe, he was sleeping in the bed that Voldemort occupied when he was a student there.
2- I'm not really a talkative person, so I'm not that great writing dialogues, the ones in this chapter is most likely the biggest dialogue that I have ever written, so I'm sorry if it isn't that great.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hermione, Dumbledore was at my trial for a total of like 5 minutes and It wasn’t even to talk to me. He was there at the end because he had scheduled lunch with one of the members of the Wizengamot. He was like in and out.” Harry said, a bit of annoyance coming out with each word.
Harry’s immediate response was to grasp his right wrist while saying “No, I’m totally fine, no recent injury at all.” in a squeaky voice. Both Draco and Hermione gave him a doubtful look. “Then you’ll have no problem explaining why you’re holding your wrist like it’s going to fall any minute now.” Hermione said. “And since when do you have snakes?”
The rest of the week was spent between cleaning and being locked in his room for two days because he accidentally broke one of his aunt set plates. Even those 2 days passed quickly because now he had the company of his 2 little scaled friends. The times he enjoyed the most were the nights, because it allowed him to speak with his new little friends. The white ringed snake was a female, around 7 months old of age and the dark scaled snake was a male, around 1 year and 3 months old. It took Harry a while to figure what names to give them, which came to him while he was dusting the leaving room and his aunt was watching a documentary about gems and they showed dark gems, showing Black Opals and Onyx as examples of what dark gems were and from there came their names. That night, Harry went to his room feeling a bit anxious. He didn’t know if his little baby’s would like their names. Fortunately, they enjoyed very much being named after precious gems, and so the white ringed snake was named Opal and the dark scaled snake was named Onyx.
-	Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices. – said Dumbledore – First years ought to know that the Forest in the grounds is out-of-bounds to the students – and a few of our older students ought to know by now, too. Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four-hundred-and-sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in the corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch’s office door. We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
-	Well, we’re reading just now. - said Professor Umbridge. - If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.
I’m really happy that you are able to get Sirius name cleared, because he deserves justice and they have to start searching for Peter soon, because where he is most likely Voldemort isn’t far. Besides living in hiding doesn’t do any good to anyone, much less someone that was in Azkaban for 12 years. I hope Sirius is doing okay.
Later, when everyone was already in bed, his curiosity won, and he got up and went to Draco’s bed where the boy was reading a book. “Can I know what did you and Hermione talked about? You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want.” Harry said in a low voice since a few of the other occupants were already asleep. Draco nodded in response, marking the page of the book he was reading and putting it in the night table.
-	Yes sir, I understood. – Harry said.
-	You better not even think about it or the consequences could be dire. – Malfoy said. – And what about your little friends, have they deserted you?
Harry returned to the booth he had been earlier and got dressed. He was playing with his snakes, when the last person he needed to see opened the door of his compartment. Draco Malfoy had just opened the door and entered the place like it belonged to him, surprisingly he was alone, no bodyguards to be seen. And above all he didn’t even noticed that Harry was there, so Harry stayed silent, not wanting to pick up a fight. He wasn’t in the mood for that. Fighting with Malfoy always left him angry, but if he was really honest sometimes it was actually fun. It distracted him from all his problems and everything that usually happened around him.
7:35 AM
-	Don’t worry about that, you gave me the letter but you didn’t say I could read it, so I didn’t. In any other occasion I might have done so, but in the state you where it felt like I wouldn’t gain anything from it and that I was meddling in something that didn’t concerned me. – Draco said in a calm voice, which made Harry’s tears stop.
After the shower, the boy returned to the shared room to guard his pajamas and found the room empty besides Malfoy that was seated in Harry´s bed with Opal in his lap, patting her small head. Harry didn´t know how to react to the way that his snake liked the caresses Malfoy was giving him or the way Malfoy seemed to like his snake back. Onyx was nowhere to be seen, maybe under the covers enjoying the warmth. He was rather fond of warm places.
He entered the pub and walked to the back where the entry to Diagon Alley was. He touched the right bricks and the wall opened to give him entry to the alley. Harry went first to Gringotts to get some money for his purchases. Looking at his Hogwarts letter Harry directed himself to Flourish and Blotts to by the books he needed for this year. He wondered around in the shop for a while looking for the books for classes and for books to read in his free time. He left the shop when his stomach started to make noise, remembering him that he didn’t had breakfast and that he needed to be feed. So he went back to the pub where he ordered something to eat. After lunch, the boy went to the ice cream shop, seeing as sweet things were something he rarely ate during summer.
-	Mister Potter this behavior is unacceptable coming from a Slytherin student, but since Umbridge already took points from Slytherin and you have detention to serve with her and seeing that you are a Slytherin student for only for days, I will be lenient with you and not give you any extra detention. Keep in mind that this is the only time that I’m being kind, because the next time anything similar happens you will be serving detention with me instead and I can guarantee that it will be much worse than anything that women does to you, are we understood? – Snape said after reading the note, his face showed the displeasure he felt while talking.
Dear Harry,
-	I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough –
I realize that the conversation between Harry and Draco may seem rushed, but it all will make sense in the future, when I explain something that has a lot of impact in the story.
Harry almost ran out of the classroom. He had already noticed that Snape had a certain preference over his house, but this just proved it. Snape hated him, he would take any chance he had to belittle him or give him a punishment, this time he got away with just a few words and a threat.  Since he still had over an hour till dinner, he decided to go to the Library and give an answer to the letter Remus had sent.
Harry took a deep breath and then he knocked on the door of Umbridge’s office. After he was told to come in, he opened the door and was almost immediately assaulted with pink. There was pink everywhere. That was the office! A small space decorated entirely with too much pink and lace and frilly cloths. And for his horror, the wall behind Umbridge’s desk was covered with kitten decorated plates. The kittens were moving around and a few of them even switched plates. The vision of so much pink in the office was giving Harry a head ache, which he was sure, would only grow bigger with the passing of time. His dislike for the room must have showed, because the face the teacher directed to him was filled with even more hatred than the other few times he had looked at her.
Besides the animals allowed in Hogwarts the shop also sold kneazles and crups, puffskeins and even bats, spiders and snakes. Harry was looking at all of the animals when he heard low voices discussing about which one had the prettiest scales. Following the voices Harry found himself in front of a terrarium where 2 snakes where arguing. The boy had never seen such pretty snakes. There scales were such a deep brown they looked black in their backs while their bellies were white and both were about 50 cm long. One of the snakes had the scales in their head dark surrounded by a white ring, while the other had a fully dark head. And while they moved and the light touched their scales, they seemed to change colors from the whole rainbow spectrum. Harry chuckled seeing them argue and his sound made both snakes stop arguing and look at him.
-	Your hand is not up, Miss Granger! - Professor Umbridge said and ignored her when she put her hand in the air. - It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you.
3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use.
They all knew how his life was living with the Dursley’s, they all knew about him being starved and locked in his room for days on end and being beaten for simple mistakes any one could make, so why would they think that that life was the best life for someone that had seen what he had and had gone through what he had.
-	They are indeed very pretty! But why did you decide to buy them, aren’t they out of the list of pets allowed in school. – Sirius asked looking at the snakes.
Harry’s eyes filled with tears, he could feel the love and the worry in Moony’s words. He promised himself to get the strength to tell them the truth. He didn’t like to talk about his life with the Dursley’s, but he knew just from reading his words that he meant everyone of them, he really was worried and would try to do something about it. It was the first time someone said that to him, the Weasley’s knew that he suffered in the Dursley’s hand and they helped when he spent half the summer with them, but he felt like that wasn’t enough. Even Dumbledore knew, but unlike the Weasley’s he didn’t do anything when he had the power to help. He thought that they cared about him, he was sure the Weasley’s did, but they never really tried to help. He really appreciated the half summers he spent with them, but besides that they never really did anything, but now there was someone that was trying to protect him, that was trying to get him out of all the abuse he suffered when he was a child and still suffered now, even if it was only for a small about of time.
“Mostly non taken, but it’s good to see you worried about your studies. Changing houses had some benefits after all.” Hermione said with a smile. “Yesterday, I was talking with Ginny and Neville and we had an idea about a study group we could create for DADA, but right now, I think we should talk about something more important. Harry, I have been thinking about the talk we had on the train and I am a little worried. Harry you said that you never sent a letter to Dumbledore, so if you didn’t send that letter then who did?” This time her face and tone showed worry.
Have you ever heard of Dolores Umbridge? She is our new Defense Against the Dark Arts. We had class today with her. Can you believe that we will only be taught the theory of spell casting and won’t ever have practical lessons? But we will still have the practical part in the exam. She says that we only need the theory to know how to cast spells. It´s ridiculous. There was a discussion during class and when I said that Voldemort was back she said it was a lie and when I insisted she took points and gave me detention. The Ministry is really desperate to pretend that he isn’t back, but that is jeopardizing our studies, just the theory isn’t enough. Oh Merlin, I sound like Hermione speaking!
Then he got up and left the common room.
How are you? Everything is alright with me. The resorting was surprising, but not that much if really think about it. I think I never told this to anyone before, but in first year the hat wanted to put me in the Slytherin, the only reason he didn’t was because I pleaded not to be put there. In my second year when I so the hat again in the Headmasters office he told me that he still believed what he said in my first year, that I would have been great in Slytherin. I guess this time I just couldn’t escape.
-	Harry, I really need to talk to you. Can we talk now please? – The girl said in a pleading voice. – I know you are mad at me and Ron and that you probably don’t want to talk to us, but after what you said in the train I have been thinking and you are right. We really need to talk, so please talk to us. I know you saw the look Ron gave you at dinner yesterday and he is mad but I have been talking to him I’m almost there convincing that you being in Slytherin doesn’t change who you are. It took me the weekend to think about your change of house and I realized that I don’t care in what house you are, you were my friend first and that’s what matters more. So please can we talk?
Harry had to go to the last carriage to find a booth that was empty. He was really confused, his friends knew that he hated being with the Dursley’s so way would they think that he wanted to stay there. They believed it just because Dumbledore said so. Even the old man knew that Harry didn’t want to be there, so way would he lie about some letter he never would have sent.
-	Well, good afternoon! – The woman said unusually cheerful and waited for the response that came from every student in a mumbled way - That won’t do, now, will it? I would like you, please, to reply “Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge”. One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!
I hope everything is alright with you. I’m really sorry if I’m the reason or even part of the reason you didn’t want to spend the summer with me, Remus and all your other friends. In the box it’s a small piece of enchanted glass that allows you to communicate with the person that has the other piece, all you have to do is call mine or Remus names and if we have the mirror with us we will know you are trying to talk to us. Remus also has a piece that is connected to the one both you and I have, so you can talk to him to if you need. I’ll try and have it with me at all times, but if you want you can also send me and Remus some letters. I don’t know if he told you but we are leaving together so address the letters to him, that way it won’t rise suspicion. I want you to know that I love you and that I really hope you are okay. And that I’m really sorry for not going to see you but it could be risky seeing as I’m still not under the Ministry gaze.
I got Harry's time table from the internet and I´m using it even though it´s the Gryffindor timetable. I only changed the Astronomy class from Wednesday to Thursday because, Harry has Friday free of classes and it makes more sense to put a class that ends around 2 in the morning the day before a free day that the day before a class day. I also changed Potions to Fridays and Defense to Tuesdays.
Harry put his hand in the air being yet again ignored by Professor Umbridge
When Harry heard the name of the new Defense teacher, he could feel the headache already forming and when he looked at the table of the faculty, she was indeed there. Dolores Umbridge, his newest nightmare. The Headmaster was already continuing his speech when a “hem, hem” was heard in the Hall interrupting him, everyone looked at the form of a small women dress in pink clothes and an awful pink head band that matched the clothes the woman was wearing.
-	Hand, Mr. Potter! - said Professor Umbridge.
The pink demon pointed for the desk right in front of her and signaled him to sit down. “During this detention you will be doing some lines, Mister Potter.” She said after Harry had sat down and with a wave of her wand one of the quills in the pink pot in her desk floated and landed in his desk. “You will be using this quill, that way I’m sure the message will sink in. You shall write, «I must not tell lies». You will only stop when I tell you to. Understood, Mister Potter?”
He scooped his snakes up and started walking to the castle leaving the two teens behind and ended up meeting Blaise and the rest of the group halfway there. With a few words the group turned around and headed to the Great Hall. 15 minutes later both Hermione and Draco entered the Great Hall and went to sit in their respective tables. Harry was really curious to know what they had been talking about but decided to restrain himself from asking and concentrated on enjoying dinner.
Harry went to his desk, picked his books and left the class room and headed to the Potions classroom, he didn’t know where Professor Snape had his office. He supposed was somewhere in the dungeons close to his classroom, but he didn’t know where it was so his best bet was the Potions classroom. Luckily or not, Snape was indeed in the Potions class room. He could hear the voice of the professor trough the door complaining to someone. Since he didn’t want to embarrass himself in front of a bunch of kids he didn’t know he stayed hidden in one of the alcoves existent in the beginning of the corridor and waited for the class to end. After it ended Harry went to the class room to give the note to the professor. He knocked on the door and the professor let him in.
-	Basically, in a very short way yes, that’s exactly what you need to do. And knowing that you will be doing this even though I know you don’t what, I have a proposal for you. You follow these rules without fuss and the Slytherin stop messing with all your friends. We will only do something to them if they do anything to us first. If they don’t attack us in any way we will pretend they don’t even exist and won’t bother them for any reason at all, ok? Another thing, now that we are in the same house and are kind of being forced to be friends I’d prefer if you called me Draco instead of Malfoy. It may take some time getting used to, but I think it will help you feel more like your part of the group, sine we call everyone by their names. – Draco proposed.
Draco was the first one to notice the tears now streaming down Harry’s face and in a surprising attitude, that had everyone around them gasping, he passed his right arm over Harry’s shoulder pulling him closer and started petting his hair and asked in a low voice if he was alright. Harry unconsciously passed him the letter and whispered in response that finally someone cared enough. It took all of 10 seconds for Harry to realize what he had done. In a second, he ripped the letter from Draco’s hand and ran out of the Great Hall and headed to the common room to get his books. He started heading to the Gryffindor common room and then realized that he was heading the wrong way and turned back to the dungeons.
-	Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it? - said Dean. - If we’re  going to be attacked, it won’t be risk free.
25th of August 1995,
Until the next time I see you, Snuffles.
-	You have a snake? Isn’t it against the school rules? – The blond said surprised.
-	Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge! – All the students said with fake enthusiasm.
-	Yes, aunt Petunia and thank you for allowing me to go by my school material. I will start immediately on his breakfast – Harry said in a quiet and almost robotic voice trying to hide his happiness from his aunt.
The elf nodded and popped out. Harry had noticed when he put his first spoonful of food in his mouth that his shirt’s sleeve was starting to get red in the spot in contact with the wound, probably since the blood wasn’t being put to use and he needed to get the wound clean or it may infect. Dobby appeared 2 minutes later with a bottle of essence of dittany, according to the label, and a roll of bandages. He carefully poured a bit of the liquid inside the bottle on the wound and massaged for a few seconds until the skin and wound absorbed the liquid and then wrapped his hand with the bandages. When he was finished he thanked Dobby for the meal and the stuff for his hand and left for the Slytherin dorm. Dobby said goodbye and told him that if he needed anything else he should call for Dobby and he would help.
“Come here, let me see you arm.” Harry pushed away his sleeve and showed the words to the women. She examined them for a few seconds. “Looks like the message sink in rather well, Mister Potter. Have you learned your lesson, Mister Potter? I really hope you have because I would hate to have to give you detention again!” The woman said. Harry nodded in agreement and looking at the toads face he could see that the last sentence was a lie. She was eager to see him make another mistake so that she could bring him in and torture him again. “You are free to go now.”
“Are you sure? Dumbledore said that you were incredibly happy to have won the trial, that your relatives would be very happy that you had won the trial and that you were in a rush to get home. Ok, why did I believe that? You would never be in a rush to get to your uncle’s house, you hate that place. Ok, something very wrong is going on. Why did he lie?” doubt and a bit of fear could be heard in Hermione’s voice.
“It is a good idea. Merlin knows we could use all the help we can get.” Harry said “Do you have any idea who would like to join? You can count me in, Pansy would most likely want to participate, Theo and Tracy would too. Blaise is my bodyguard so count him in too. Would you like to take part in the study group to, Draco?” Harry said, turning to the other boy that had been ignored practically the entire time since he arrived.
Liv had felt like a silly schoolgirl stealing glances at Hestia Jones, wondering what she was saying that was making Professor Trelawney laugh so uproariously. When Hestia had finally noticed Liv looking across the staff table at her, she simply smiled and waved back. Mortified at being caught in the act, Liv had quickly averted her gaze and stared at her dinner plate while Professor Slughorn continued to chatter in her ear. She mentally berated herself for behaving no better than one of the students and endeavoured to act her age from now on.
“No,” he replied. “It’s actually nice having some company for a change.”
Dennis’s voice had risen into a crescendo until he bellowed the last few words at Professor McGonagall. Although her expression remained impassive, the fiery anger in her eyes had extinguished. They looked as hollow as Harry felt.
“Take it from someone who knows,” she continued. “Life is too short to worry about what other people think about you. And it’s too damn short to deny yourself a chance of happiness.”
Ginny’s hand had immediately shot up into the air and she asked, “Yes, Professor, um…”
“I didn’t roll my eyes at you,” Harry lied. “Maybe you’re seeing things, too.”
“I know that I’m the last person in the world that you want to speak to—now or ever—but I’m taking advantage of the fact that you can’t speak and I can’t lie, and I’m going to tell you what you need to hear.”
“Probably just glad to see you leave the Gryffindor table,” Harry quipped.
Harry shrugged off his backpack and dumped it on the floor. He sat Asha on top of a nearby table before taking the seat next to Draco. “It just took me a while to find the compartment. Well, it’s more of a hotel suite than a compartment, I suppose. This place is massive.”
“Kiss me like you mean it,” he challenged.
“Class is due to start in a few minutes,” she said sliding off of the desk and onto her feet. “I better get ready.”
“Well, I’m sure you’ll agree that I’m excellent company,” he smirked.
Merlin, you really were clueless when you turned up at Hogwarts, weren’t you?”
Hagrid’s enormous boarhound lay on a large pile of plump cushions in the corner of the tent wagging his tail contentedly. Harry suspected that Hagrid would have a hard time convincing his loyal pet to vacate the comfort of the tent for a smaller cabin when it was ready.
“The same thing I’ve been telling everyone—that Hogwarts is open to every magical child who wishes to learn here.”
Harry’s waterlogged shoes squelched as he shuffled into Gryffindor Tower well after midnight. He had called after Draco, hoping that he would come back to help him look for his wand, but either Draco had ignored him or couldn’t hear Harry’s voice over the storm, because he had kept marching ahead, disappearing into the darkness within seconds. The rain had poured relentlessly onto Harry’s head, soaking him through to the skin in moments as he scrambled blindly through the sodden grass searching for his wand. By the time he had managed to retrieve it, he was in such a foul mood that he didn’t even bother throwing his Invisibility Cloak over his head. He just trudged back to the castle feeling thoroughly sorry for himself and pissed off at Draco’s behaviour.
In the blink of an eye, the empty dishes on each of the long tables piled high with every type of food imaginable: sausage casserole, gammon steaks, buttermilk fried chicken and poached salmon were just a taste of the countless offerings available. Harry’s stomach rumbled loudly at the sight of so much delicious food and it was only then that he realised how hungry he was. He made sure to wrap some food up in a paper towel for Asha before filling his plate with a little bit of everything—he might not have Quidditch to enjoy this year, but at least he still had the daily feasts to look forward to.
“Oh yeah,” he mumbled, wiping sleep from his eyes. “Next time I get any smart ideas, just tell me to shut up, will you?”
“Okay, fine, a little maybe, but it’s all mixed up with a bunch of other stuff. Like, I hate you a little right now, but mostly because you’ve left the bed fucking cold, and I miss you in it.”
Draco turned eighteen, and, along with the trust, inherited a house from his late great-aunt. Renovations were an easy distraction at first, though the exterior required little more than a fresh coat of paint. The original entryway, with its pink granite steps and scallop-shelled columns, retained much of its youthful charm, and the frieze only needed a thorough dusting before it galloped brightly between floors.
"What? No."
Ginny launches herself at Parkinson. Harry tries to hold her back by her sleeve; as much as he loves a fight, Ginny wouldn't forgive him for letting her embarrass herself—except…except…
“Dobby?” Harry calls.
"Rum and cokes for us all," Ginny says.
Ginny throws her head back and hollers out a laugh. She blinks when Harry doesn't join in.
"Yeah. Okay." Draco clears his throat. It's plain that he doesn't believe Harry. "I can't just come over right now. I'm already taking a risk by calling you from the office loo. But I'll stop by later, okay?"
The first man I killed was Anton Dolohov. That was easy. He'd been a Death Eater for years. He killed Muggles. Maybe he murdered my friends, who knows. I went to a lot of funerals after the war.

Harry blinks. "For what?
Draco dreams of a flood that swallows up the streets, of homes drowned to the tips, cresting the waves like shark fins, the waters murky and dangerous with the debris of things once owned but now untethered by ruin. “How do you drain a flood?” Draco murmurs into his pillow half-drenched in drool. “Bad dream,” Harry echoes from the distance of his own nightmare.
It took maybe a few more years than I thought, but it was all the same when Potter and I crossed paths again. Electric. Puddlemere beat the Arrows by a margin of ten for the Cup, and the crowd was going ballistic. Potter stood from his seat a couple rows down and looked me straight in the eye. I fell right into him, his mind a pillowy soft thing now, buzzing with thoughts. Nothing like the cold void that summer after the war. It was enough of a shock that I bounced right back out.
“Merlin, I forgot—once I found you, I was supposed to bring you back to the house,” she said, brushing grass from her legs. “We’re going to Diagon Alley today to get my school supplies. Are you coming with us?”
Harry squirmed in his seat. Despite what some people might think, he really didn’t enjoy being the centre of attention, so having his and Draco’s photographs plastered across the poster was more than a little embarrassing.
Harry screwed up his face. “Are you supposed to be Peter Pan?”
“Very well, see that it doesn’t. I need you to stop whatever it is that you’re doing at the moment and start pulling all of the information that we have on the Mudblood Hermione Granger,” he said, eyeing her small, cramped office with mild interest, every inch of which was covered with boxes and files on confirmed and potential Muggle-Borns. Liv frowned.
Harry grimaced. Of course, Hermione had known. More often than not, she was the smartest person in the room—not just booksmarts, either. She had a unique skill of reading people and understanding what made them tick; she’d always had a knack of picking up on these things, even if the person wasn’t fully aware of it themselves yet.
“Yes,” Hestia laughed. “So what do you say?”
Draco laughed darkly and muttered, “Try and tell that to my parents.”
Liv felt that familiar sharp pang of grief in her chest any time those she had loved and lost were mentioned. Although it upset her to speak about them, she couldn’t help but ask the question because the opportunity to hear a story or learn some insight about Dora’s secretive life in the Order was too great an opportunity to pass up. She blinked several times, trying to prevent the tears welling in her eyes from spilling over. Fixing a brittle smile across her face, she cleared her throat and nodded.
“First comes love, then comes marriage. Then comes a baby in a—”
“Not that I could see.”
“Since when has Ginny supported the Harpies?” Ron scoffed.
Sleeping with the enemy wasn’t ‘the Malfoy way’ either, yet he seemed to have no qualms about doing that, he reminded himself. Draco supposed that if he and Harry could get to a place where they not only tolerated one another but actually
Knowing he had more than overstayed his welcome now, Harry got to his feet and headed for the exit, wondering if he’d see Dennis at the Gryffindor breakfast table in the morning, or if this was the last time he’d ever see him again on school premises.
Draco gaped at her. “You are joking, aren’t you?”
“The Tooth Fairy,” Luna repeated. “Muggles believe that The Tooth Fairy comes at night and steals the teeth of their children while they sleep.”
With a brisk nod, Professor McGonagall wished them both a good evening and strode off to stop two of the younger students from lobbing candied apples at one another.
Harry Potter watched the steam billowing out of the train’s chimney, casting white mist across the busy platform, obscuring everyone’s feet from view. He was instantly reminded of the first time he had set eyes on the Hogwarts Express several years previously. He recalled how happy he had been to leave behind his miserable life at the Dursleys’, and how excited he was at the prospect of learning magic and making friends. But that first journey to Hogwarts had symbolised more than a first day at a new school for Harry, it was the first day of the rest of his life—a journey that held the promise of unknown wonders, of adventure and boundless possibilities.
“I wasn’t trying to tip you out of your chair,” Draco protested, swiping at the feather as Harry made it dance around his head before managing to tuck it behind his ear. “I’m going to live to regret teaching you that, aren’t I?”
“Is this everyone?” asked Tom brightly. “Excellent. Follow me…”
“Okay, umm...what are Slytherin’s house colours?”
Harry sighed and he cast a sorrowful look across the stadium. “I hate seeing the place in this state.”
“Uh sure. What do you want to talk about?”
“Yeah, me too.” Hestia downed the last of her drink and rose to her feet, swaying slightly on the spot. “Let’s make tracks before Rosmerta kicks us out.”
Draco nodded numbly, too deep in his spiral of morose thoughts to properly respond. He didn’t speak much on the journey back to the hotel, either. He only half-listened as everyone else chatted excitedly amongst themselves on the subway train about how fantastic the play had been, and how different it was to see it performed in full by ‘proper’ actors. That said, when Liv suggested that they head to the hotel bar for a drink before bed, Draco was more than happy to tag along—he was in need of a strong drink.
“The costume isn’t that bad,” Harry offered kindly, scrutinising his own appearance in the mirror before giving his reflection a quick nod of approval. “I guarantee there’ll be crazier costumes than yours out there tonight.”
Harry slipped under the covers of his bed and quickly drew the curtains around his four-poster, Ron’s smug face disappearing from view. Harry was too angry and embarrassed to even respond to Ron’s taunts. He just wanted to go to sleep and forget this night had ever happened. Ron popped his head through the curtain and Harry suppressed a groan, expecting Ron to continue teasing him but his expression was more sympathetic than mocking.
“What are you on about?”
“You know what I mean,” he said irritably. “I’m the antithesis of everything he is; Potter is the Gryffindor wunderkind, this beloved war hero with friends and a future. I’m just an ex-Death Eater, a Slytherin and a social pariah to boot.” He looked up at Myrtle with a forlorn expression. “We’re not exactly the most compatible pair, are we?”
“Staying at home would be of little use to you,” she argued. “Going back to Hogwarts and getting your qualifications is a far more constructive use of your time. You have your future to consider.”
had been met with mixed responses from students and staff members alike, the costume party had been received with universal enthusiasm. Liv pulled her cloak more tightly around her neck and continued down the high street. Ah well, at least one of her ideas was popular.
“Draco Malfoy as good as killed you,” Minerva countered darkly. “He gave Greyback and his ilk entry into this castle, putting everyone’s lives in danger. Bill Weasley almost died.
The students and their professors sat in small groups, enjoying the relaxed atmosphere of the bar. Hestia was holding court at one of the nearby tables, chatting animatedly about Quidditch with Ron, Neville and several of the other boys. Liv was sitting at the table next to Draco and Harry, talking to Luna, Hermione, Ginny and Pansy about the play.
It had been the question that Minerva had been bursting to ask since she had received Liv’s owl a few days prior inquiring about the vacancy. Even if she decided not to employ her, Minerva had to satisfy her curiosity and ask why she was so interested in applying for a job that was effectively a demotion. Liv, who had been all smiles and jokes up until now, looked incredibly reluctant to divulge this information.
“...But I was always given another chance,” Harry continued. “Like I said before: sometimes people do the right thing for the wrong reasons. Or at least, they
She wasn’t sure that she could, but she was going to give it her best shot.
“Well, clearly none of that bothers Harry,” she consoled. “You like him. He likes you...sounds like you’re pretty compatible to me.”
“Indeed. So I thought rather than trying to completely empty your mind, I want you to try focusing on a single object instead.”
Harry didn’t know how to answer. The Draco Malfoy he’d known wouldn’t even want to breathe the same air as a Muggle-Born, let alone befriend one. Harry realised that probably wasn’t the aptest comparison considering it had been several decades since Myrtle had last drawn breath, but the fact remained that the boy he’d known would never have called someone like Myrtle a friend. Then again, the Draco Malfoy he’d come to know in recent days had done several things that the old Draco never would have—offering to help Harry with Occlumency, for one. If anyone had said to Harry that in the past week he would be reciting lines from a Muggle play with Draco or willingly spending free time in each other’s company, flying around on broomsticks and having a rare old time, he’d have said they must have been struck in the head with a particularly powerful Confundus Charm. Yet here he was, watching Draco zig-zag overhead and actually enjoying his company.
Harry looked up at Draco then with a sincere expression. “I do, actually. Probably not in the same way that you mean, but I have some idea of what it feels like.”
None of the professors looked in Harry’s direction as he approached; instead, they were listening intently to the Patronus (a nightingale, Harry realised), which stood on the Headmistress’s desk as it spoke in Madam Pomfrey’s booming, authoritative voice.
Harry took the drinks over first, placing his cup on the bedside table before handing the other to Draco, who still had his eyes closed but was sitting up in bed now. His bed head was evident now as one side of his fair hair was sticking up on one side. Harry felt a wave of affection for him then and leaned over the bed to press a quick kiss to Draco’s lips before going to retrieve the rest of their food.
“Saints do not move,” said Draco, “though grant for prayers’ sake.”
Liv shrugged. “In hindsight, it probably wasn’t the smartest decision I ever made.”
Harry and Draco looked at each other. Draco still appeared nervous, but he gave Harry a slight nod in confirmation. Harry relaxed a little and smiled at his friends. “Yeah, I suppose it is official now.”
Dennis rolled his eyes and turned back to the task at hand. “It’s a balcony covered in ivy. And no, I don’t need help, certainly not from you.”
now, is it? So, it only took my untimely death for you to speak to me in a manner befitting my position.”
“Chimaera,” Goyle chipped in, nodding to the door.
“How are you feeling now?” asked Ginny, her face etched with concern. “You’re not in any pain, are you?”
“I’m not hungry,” he protested half-heartedly, but a fresh plateful of bacon and egg sandwiches fashioned into a small pyramid was already soaring past Ron and Hermione’s heads, landing with a clatter in front of Harry. One of the sandwiches fell off of the overfilled plate onto the table, which Ron swiftly snatched up before taking a bite out of it.
The clothes from his trunk were already washed, dried and pressed, and had been placed in a neat pile inside a wicker hamper at the foot of the dresser. Draco walked past it and sat on the edge of his bed, feeling adrift. The silence that he’d long sought after now felt oppressive in the large, empty room. Glancing at his bedside table, he noticed that Blinken had left the two-way mirror there. He wanted to talk to Harry, but he had several hours to wait before it reached ten o’clock. Draco sighed and flopped back on the bed, feeling miserable. Two long weeks in a big, empty house with nobody to talk to.
“There’s no way we can squeeze in all of those places in one day, let alone four hours,” Harry argued. “Look, we’ve seen the main sites, haven’t we? Can’t we just relax for the rest of the afternoon?”
“Good evening,” she said slowly, eyeing Draco with suspicion. “Is he with you?”
The lion’s long white whiskers twitched a little but otherwise, it remained sound asleep. Hermione cast an uncertain glance back at Ron and Harry, who were gesticulating wildly while they silently mouthed for her to run away. Instead, Hermione turned back to the lion and took a step closer to it before speaking a little louder.
Draco sincerely doubted that. “And what about you? Are you still talking to me?”
“Well, isn’t this cosy,” he whispered suggestively.
“Will it make you feel better if I tell you that I helped you for no other reason than it will annoy you immensely to beat you to top billing?” Harry smirked. The tension in Draco’s shoulders eased a little.
“Bloody typical,” he muttered under his breath.
Dennis turned to face Harry and gave him a withering look. “How do you think?”
Draco shook his head. “I suspect he’ll be taking his frustration out on his broomstick for a couple of hours. Best just to leave him to it.” He glanced at the front page of the newspaper that Theo was reading and grimaced. “For Merlin’s sake, they couldn’t have picked a better picture of me, could they?”
Liv sighed miserably, “I know. The best that we can do is prepare them for life out there.”
“How would the Slytherins react if I walked into your common room?” Harry countered. Draco huffed out a laugh.
Draco’s expression was conflicted and Harry felt a wave of sympathy for him at that moment. As much as Harry hated keeping secrets from his friends, he knew how gossip could spread like wildfire; if anyone found out about him and Draco, Draco’s parents would surely learn about them soon after. Given what he knew of the Malfoys, Harry didn’t think their reaction to their son being gay and in a relationship with Harry Potter would be viewed favourably.
“Here’s what I think,” she began. “Obviously you didn’t want to return to Hogwarts but you’re here now. As I see it, you have two options—you could take advantage of your time here, knuckle down and get some qualifications under your belt...or you can leave.”
“I’m not going to remove you from the wall!” Minerva assured them both with an exasperated sigh. She cast a brooding look at the ancient patchwork Sorting Hat perched atop a high shelf. “I know that there are a lot of good people in Slytherin House—you the best among them, Severus.”
Liv spun around in her chair to face the clock again and groaned when she saw that only a minute had passed since she had last checked the time. Throwing her head back against the headrest, she proceeded to sway from side to side again on her chair, thinking about the feast the previous evening. Professors Sprout and Flitwick only vaguely remembered Liv from her school days, but then they had taught countless students in the twenty years since she had graduated. She was relieved to have been sat next to Horace Slughorn during the meal, a friendly face amongst a sea of strangers. It helped that she was a former member of the Slug Club so they were able to reminisce about her schooldays. But as much as Liv enjoyed catching up with Professor Slughorn, her eyes kept drifting towards the other end of the table where the pretty, black-haired woman who was Hogwarts’ newest Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.
“What?” she asked. Hestia bit her lip, leant over the table, and lightly brushed her thumb over Liv’s top lip.
Myrtle gaped at Draco as though he had just slapped her across the face. “Who put a Glumbumble in your bonnet? I’m only trying to help!”
A slight frown creased Draco’s forehead. “So, when you say that you weren’t compatible, I take that this incompatibility was sexual in nature?”
“How can you possibly tell that great bloody lion is our Transfiguration professor?”
Draco gladly obliged and kissed him, dipping his tongue past Harry’s slack lips and into his mouth. Harry’s moans of pleasure were lost in the kiss as Draco’s fingers slid in and out of his body in smooth strokes, scissoring and preparing him for his cock. Harry began grinding his hips down onto Draco’s fingers, wanting to feel fuller, his movements and breaths becoming more erratic as he drew closer to climax. When Harry’s hole tightened around his fingers, Draco knew that it would only take a few more strokes to make Harry come. Harry’s breath hitched suddenly and he clamped his hand around Draco’s wrist and Draco stilled.
Liv downed the rest of her drink which had long since gone cold and continued, “So, he called me and told me what his situation was. I took leave from work and came back here to take care of him. Ted and Andromeda helped out a lot, cooking meals and keeping my dad company so that we could have a bit of a break from each other. I loved my dad; he had always been such an independent person, but now here I was spending every minute of the day and night with him, helping him do things that he couldn’t do for himself anymore. It was really frustrating for him.”
he said disdainfully. “You could knock someone out with that thing.”
that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What’s Montague?” she demanded hotly. “It is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet.”
It was easier to be angry at Draco Malfoy than it was to sympathise with the impossible position that he had been put in. Because if she couldn’t blame him for her friend dying, who could she blame? She had blamed Severus, of course, not knowing until the closing moments of the final battle that Albus’s death had been orchestrated by the old headmaster in the first place. She was angry at them for not trusting her, but she had loved them both in life and had forgiven them in death. She wasn’t sure if she was quite ready to forgive Draco Malfoy yet. If only he had come forward and asked for help, things might have been so very different—Albus, Severus, Merlin knows how many others, might still be alive. It was easier to blame a boy who was foolish and afraid than it was to blame herself. She should have listened to Potter when he’d voiced his concerns over Draco’s behaviour, but she had dismissed him, convinced that his accusations were unfounded. She should have done more. If only she had listened, they might all have lived.
“And make sure that he eats enough food.”
“And Dumbledore knew,” Draco muttered. “He knew and he didn’t do anything.”
“Hogwarts is in crisis, Minerva. The four houses have never been so divided. How can you hope to bring unity to the school when you cannot look past your own misgivings?” he challenged.
Draco frowned. “Are you sure? Won’t other people be a bit funny about me being there?”
A small smile quirked the corners of Draco’s mouth and Harry felt that increasingly familiar sensation of giddiness anytime Draco looked at him like that. Over the years, Harry had grown accustomed to Draco sneering at him. It was still a little strange to see Draco smiling at him with what looked like affection, but not unpleasantly so. In fact, Harry liked it quite a lot. He liked it so much that he found himself finding any excuse that he could think of to talk to Draco during classes, to try and see that smile that he’d grown to like so much.
“Well, whatever she has planned for him, it’ll be a walk in the park compared to the trouble he’ll get from the other students,” said Hermione grimly. “I doubt a few weeks is going to be enough time for the mood in Hogwarts to improve much.”
“How was the Sorting Ceremony?” he asked before shovelling a large mouthful of mashed potato into his mouth. Looking up and down the Gryffindor table, he saw a few new faces looking nervous but excited. He remembered feeling the same way when the Sorting Hat had been plonked onto his head.
“Not at all, Madam. I’ll have supper waiting for you upon your return. Free of charge, of course,” he said, winking at the empty space where Harry stood. “It’s the least I could do, after everything you’ve done for us.”
He pressed a soft kiss to Draco's lips which Draco briefly returned before pulling back. "When you do decide to tell your friends...will you tell them about me?”
“I tried to
So just a heads up to my regular readers, I'll be going on a brief hiatus (no more than a month, I promise!) from posting chapters. I've got another story for a fic exchange that I need to complete and life, in general, has been scuppering my attempts to do serious writing of late.
As Draco continued his rant, Harry was suddenly thrown back to the first day of term when he and Draco had bickered with each other in much the same way as they were now as they climbed the stone steps of the castle into the Entrance Hall. Harry had less of a compulsion to hex Draco this time around—but only slightly.
Draco worried his lip. “You’re not going to like it.”
“Let’s not argue semantics,” said Draco waving his hand dismissively. “I’ll doubtless win the argument anyway. Look, I get it—you want to talk to Weasley but you’re afraid of what he’s going to say. I understand why you’re worried but you’re going to be just as worried about doing it tomorrow, so you might as well do it now and get it over with. Now, if you don’t go over there and talk to him, I will, and I won’t be as nice as you.”
Draco spun around and came face to face with Professor Grubbly-Plank, who looked none too amused at the bizarre scene that she had stumbled upon. Harry was kneeling at the feet of a dishevelled-looking Draco, whose shirt was half-buttoned and his normally perfectly sculpted hair was sticking out in all directions. Harry quickly clambered to his feet and stepped away from Draco, clutching the pet carrier tightly to his chest. Grubbly-Plank cast a disapproving glance at Draco, who quickly straightened his shirt and buttoned it back up again.
Ron drew Harry’s attention away from Draco by nudging him and nodding to the opposite end of the Slytherin table.
“I think that’s enough for today,” said Hestia thickly. “Class dismissed. Mr Goyle, Mr Longbottom, you two stay behind, please.”
Professor Switch shuffled over to Neville’s desk which was covered in blonde hair. He inspected Neville’s shiny bald scalp closely and hummed to himself, “Oh dear. Are you sure that you repeated the incantation correctly?”
“That’s unfortunate,” said Draco before casually suggesting, “Well, maybe next time we could forgo the Occlumency for an evening and test out that new broomstick of yours instead.”
“‘Tis but thy
“Potter and I are nothing alike, thank you very much, I—hold on,” Draco spluttered. “Myrtle,
The students mumbled unenthusiastically in response but that did nothing to dampen Liv’s spirits. She waved a piece of parchment in the air.
“I’m just better at not getting caught,” he countered.
“Ah. Right, got it.” Harry cleared his throat and read the first line, “Not having that which makes them short.”
Harry’s fingers twitched but he resisted the temptation to reach for his wand. The last thing he needed was to be caught duelling Draco Malfoy of all people in a clothes shop, and he’d already promised himself that he was going to try and keep out of trouble this year. The dance of measuring tapes, pins and fabric finally came to a halt and Harry was able to lower his sore arms by his sides.
“I am,” Myra nodded gravely. “You know the rumours—that You-Know-Who is back...”
I lied.
Theo smirked. “‘Course you don’t.” He leant closer to Draco and said quietly, “If you think that you two are being subtle, I hate to break it to you, but you’re about as subtle as an Erumpent in a china shop. People are already talking about you two, so it won’t take long for word to get back to your parents. I wonder what your father would have to say about that, eh?”
Draco, however, wasn't keen. “Maybe for you. Personally, I don’t fancy spending three days without magic.”
“What do you think?” she asked.
“What did you do that for?” Myrtle yelled. She flew over to the bin and tried to scoop the script out but, predictably, her hand went straight through it.
“Thank you, Granger,” he replied, inclining his head towards her. “You also performed well in the audition.”
“Thank you, Professor.”
to say is that yes, you are atrocious at Occlumency…” Harry bristled but kept his mouth shut. “...but as luck would have it, it is a branch of magic that I have a particular talent for. So, if you would like a few pointers, then I am happy to assist you.”
“What are you on about?” Harry asked, confused.
Ron’s eyes widened and he gasped. “You don’t think it’s another Triwizard Tournament?”
“Just hide out here and avoid everyone else?”
Hermione looked crestfallen. “But...I thought you wanted to see the sites.”
“I’m surprised they let him board the train,” Ginny continued. “People are still pissed about that stunt he and his friends pulled on Halloween. I lost count of the number of people who tried to get into his compartment to pick a fight with him.”
“I’ll get on that right away, sir,” said Liv and Yaxley gave her an appraising smile.
“That’s not true,” Harry protested and Professor McGonagall raised a thin eyebrow at him before he relented, “Okay, so we didn’t have any Slytherin students in the group. But they weren’t exactly the most trustworthy bunch at the time, were they?”
“It’s very romantic,” Pansy sighed.
Why? I’ve just agreed to do your stupid play!”
“Whoever the culprits are of this...
When people asked Harry why he had decided to return to Hogwarts, he didn’t have one definitive answer. There were a lot of good reasons for him to come back; he needed the qualifications, for one thing. It was also his last chance to spend time with his friends before they had to go out into the world and find proper jobs. Then there was the food (Merlin, he’d missed the feasts), the Quidditch (Harry still felt a little put out that there would be no league this year), and the opportunity to go on nightly expeditions and explore the castle with his trusted Marauder’s Map. It was the first place that Harry had ever considered home and Harry wanted to wish it one final, fond farewell before he left the last remnants of his childhood behind him and set out into the world on his own.
Harry grinned. “You think so?”
“No, that was far worse.”
Draco’s head snapped up and he opened his mouth, a vicious retort on his lips, but he paused before saying anything. A calculating expression spread across his face that made Harry feel uneasy. What was he going to do?
“Really Potter, if that’s the best you’ve got—”
back onto the bookshelf and took the proffered book from Liv’s hand.
“I...no.” Harry shrunk back in his seat. “Not now, I don’t.”
Here is a long overdue update to this story. You'd be surprised how difficult it is to concentrate on writing when you're heavily pregnant (yeah, surprise lol). You won't have to wait as long for the next update, and I'm sure you'll be relieved to hear that we're almost at the finish line!
“Before we begin our feast, I have a few important announcements to make,” she began. “Reconstruction on the school is nearing completion. However, as the Quidditch pitch was completely destroyed, it will not be ready in time for a new season to take place this year...”
“I don’t mind swapping,” Pansy chipped in, flashing Goyle a bright smile. “I’m happy for Gregory here to play Gregory.”
“I know,” Harry cut in, unable to hide the disappointment written across his face. “I know, I get it. I’m not going to pressure you into anything that you don’t feel comfortable doing. Still, the offer is there if you want to take me up on it.”
Harry frowned at him. “Sorry?”
“I’m not speaking ill of Snape, I’m just stating the facts,” Ron argued. “He was a spooky bloke. Surely you’re not going to argue with me on that.”
“Coming Harry?”
“Suit yourself,” said Harry lightly. “Although you’ll probably miss the feast by the time you make it up there. Personally, I wouldn’t want to risk ruining my shoes walking up that muddy path, but it’s up to you.”
“I couldn’t agree more,” Draco shuffled closer to Harry and threw his leg over Harry’s hips. Harry responded by throwing his arm over Draco’s shoulder and pulling him closer. Draco rested his head on Harry’s chest and began to trace the tip of his index finger up and down Harry’s stomach. “I think we should just stay here tomorrow.”
“Probably for the best,” Harry agreed. He knocked on the bathroom door and stuck his head inside. “Myrtle, it’s Harry. Can I come in?”
“You were threatening to blow up my stuff!”
“I don’t understand why I should waste my time on a subject that is of no use to me,” he argued.
“I usually am,” he quipped.
Draco didn’t answer for a long time before finally admitting, “I don’t know what happened. When I realised where Professor Tonks was taking us, I wasn’t worried about going back there. I know that it’s just a room. But when I tried to step through the door...it felt like someone had stolen the air from my lungs.”
“HARRY! GINNY!” cried Mrs Weasley’s voice. Ginny’s head snapped towards her mother’s voice and she jumped to her feet.
“What’s the difference between ignorance and apathy?” asked Liv. “I don’t know and I don’t care.” Draco stared blankly back at her and she rolled her eyes.
“I want to see,” Harry pleaded, dragging the flat of his tongue over the shell of Draco’s ear. “Want to make you come so hard.”
he thought irritably. Clearly, despite everything that had happened, Draco hadn’t changed one bit. He was the same pompous git who delighted in getting a rise out of Harry at every opportunity. He thought back to the childish insults his old school rival had shot at him and the infuriating admission that he enjoyed winding Harry up. The most maddening part of what Draco had said was that he was right: Harry did let Draco get under his skin and he had done so since the first time that they had met in Madam Malkin’s in their first year. And it seemed like Draco had no intention of letting up this year, either.
Harry drew Draco that big goofy smile that always made his stomach do a small backflip. It was taking all of his willpower not to drag the gorgeous git into the nearest broom cupboard like a cave troll and have his way with him there and then.
Theo jumped to his feet and snatched his script off of the chair and glowered down at Draco, who stared hard at his own script without actually reading any of the words on the page.
“Myrtle, wait!” he hissed, but she ignored his summons and disappeared through the floor and out of sight. Draco sighed and flopped back onto his bed, feeling more than a little disconcerted at that admission. He’d need to have a chat with Myrtle about boundaries.
The students followed Liv and Hestia towards a huge red brick building adorned with towering spires and iron buttresses. Draco stared up at it, quietly impressed that Muggles could build something as large and lavish as this without the aid of magic. The hotel’s interior was equally impressive, and with its marble flooring and arches, sweeping staircases and crystal chandeliers, it reminded him a little bit of Malfoy Manor. It took the group some time to sort out room keys and to agree on arrangements for the next day: they were free to explore the city the entire day, but they had to meet in the hotel lobby at five o’clock sharp for dinner before heading to the show. Before everyone headed to their rooms for the night, Liv handed each of them a map of the city and a white envelope.
Harry had to contend with a few students coming up to him during the feast to sing his praises and shake his hand, which he didn’t enjoy most of the time but enjoyed even less when he was trying to eat his dinner. The only welcome interruption was when Hagrid came over and pulled him into a bone-crushing hug.
Draco slowed his pace. “Well, I suppose it’s like you said before, just because something’s weird doesn’t mean that it’s bad.”
Harry stepped further into the room and took in his surroundings. The layout of the Slytherin dormitory was identical to the Gryffindor one: five four-posters clad in green silk hangings instead of red velvet. Silver lanterns hung from the ceiling while the walls were decorated with medieval tapestries depicting the adventures of famous Slytherins from years gone by. Harry peered out of the nearest window to the bottom of the Black Lake. Bottle green water lapped against the window as eerie dark figures swam by in the murky depths.
That seemed to perk Myrtle up a little bit and she smiled. “Oh. Well, then it’s nice to meet you, Luna. So, what can I do for you? Need somewhere to make dangerous potions and plan some rule-breaking?”
Draco closed the script and gave Harry a searching look. “Are
“And there’s Harry now,” said Hestia, pointing over Draco’s shoulder.
Draco strode past her without saying a word. He beelined for one of the grimy sinks and spun the handle on one of the taps, collecting icy cold water in his hands and splashing it across his hot face. The cool water only provided a momentary relief and did nothing to still the maelstrom inside his own head.
Of course, Draco’s school experience had been nothing like what he had expected it to be. Memorable for all the wrong reasons and more challenging and painful than he could ever imagine, some of it had been self-inflicted, but the worst of it was thrust upon him unwillingly. Some described Hogwarts like a second home, but that sentiment was not shared by Draco. The thought of going back there, especially after everything that had happened—at the Astronomy Tower, in the Room of Requirement, the atrocities he’d witnessed during the final battle—Hogwarts was the last place in the world that he wanted to be.
“Nothing of note,” said Draco. “Spend the next fortnight at the Manor avoiding my father, I suppose. Nothing new there.”
“How am I supposed to get past that lot?” Harry hissed in Ron’s ear. Ron rubbed his chin thoughtfully for a moment, then he grinned.
Harry laughed. “If you think they’re essentials, then you would have hated camping with Ron, Hermione and I a couple of years back.”
Draco looked up at Harry, his expression now one of panic and confusion. “I can’t lie.”
“Well, whatever I am, it hasn’t made finding a girlfriend any easier,” she joked. “Mind you, with everything that’s been going on the last couple of years, I haven’t had much time to look for anyone.”
Thankfully, Draco was more patient with Harry than Snape had been; rather than berate him for his lack of progress and mock him for reliving his most painful memories, Draco remained respectfully reticent and assured Harry that he would improve with practice. After yet another failed attempt to repel Draco—this time he’d had to relive the argument which he’d had with Ron the previous day—Draco quickly lowered his wand and Harry snarled in frustration.
He was less amused when he spotted a couple of the younger students donning round spectacles and scars on their foreheads. If they thought that Harry would be flattered by their choice of costume, they were dead wrong. He was glad to have worn a mask tonight; no one apart from his closest friends seemed to have realised who he was and he was thoroughly enjoying being anonymous for the evening. The only thing that would make his night better would be if he had Draco by his side.
Harry nodded. “To be honest, I think they were glad to be rid of her. Apparently, she was a bit of a troublemaker.”
“Yes, Madam Pomfrey,” they chorused, struggling to suppress laughter as she turned on her heel and marched towards her office with the small gold cage tucked under her arm. As her door slammed shut with a loud bang, Draco started snickering.
Draco drew his toy pistol and pointed it across the room, pulled the trigger and a small red flag with the word ‘BANG’ emblazoned across it popped out of the muzzle.
Draco chewed his food slowly before replying, “It was fine.”
The way Harry was looking at him made Draco’s heart beat faster, but a persistent, niggling doubt pushed to the forefront of his mind at those words and he wondered if this was the real reason why Harry was doing this: it was no secret that he was a thrill-seeker, seemingly addicted to drama and danger. Perhaps that was why Harry had kissed him the night before, why he had held his hand under the table at breakfast in plain view of anyone who walked past, why he was in the Slytherin dungeon now with Draco Malfoy of all people. Was he here because he really liked Draco or was it merely for the thrill of doing something forbidden?
“Indeed,” Liv laughed nervously. “Who would be desperate enough to consult these books for advice, eh?”
“That was a fluke!” Draco argued but Harry just laughed.
“Well, this is an interesting development, isn’t it?” he whispered.
“Nothing,” Harry muttered, trying to sound like he didn’t really care. “I just don’t fancy having to put up with you for another year.”
“You do realise that I’m merely an impression of the subject? I’m not really Severus Snape.”
“Some friend you are,” he snarled, fleeing the bathroom with the script in hot pursuit. He stumbled down the corridor shouting, “Alright! I’m going! Just stop hitting me!”
“Well, speaking from my own unpleasant experiences, if someone really wants to hurt you, they don’t write to tell you about it beforehand. They just do it,” Draco shot back.
“See? There’s not to be scared of,” Harry reassured him.
“Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction to others or low or absent desire for sexual activity,” she explained. “I’m not really an expert on the subject, if I’m honest. I’ll get Hermione to dig out a book for you that explains it better than I can.”
“Yes, well, not all of us have the money to bribe our way out of a prison sentence, do we?” Theo cut in before Goyle could answer. He still had that fake smile plastered across his face, but his eyes betrayed his anger. Draco swallowed hard but his mouth suddenly felt very dry.
Not everyone found the performance so amusing. Theo looked as though he had been slapped across the face while Ron’s face was screwed up with confusion. Harry felt a stab of panic as Hermione looked curiously between him and Draco before scribbling something hurriedly in her notes. Perhaps their performance had been a little too convincing.
“Of course, you did,” Harry muttered, unfolding the paper. He stared at the list for a moment in disbelief. “Hermione, you wouldn’t happen to have that old time-turner of yours on you, by any chance?”
“I must admit that I’m surprised to see you,” said Theo lightly. “I didn’t think that you’d be back this year.”
As he entered the gates, Malfoy Manor finally came into view; it seemed to loom over him as he approached, dark and unwelcoming like a beast of brick and mortar, ready to swallow him up. Unable to shake off his ominous feelings, he did not linger. He marched up the steps towards the Manor and the front doors swung inward of their own accord, welcoming him into the dimly lit interior. As he reached the step at the top of the stairs, he couldn’t help but smile when he found his mother waiting for him. She stood by the grand oak doors with her arms crossed, shivering slightly from the cold, but she didn’t seem to pay it any mind. Instead, she opened her arms and reached out for Draco, pulling him into a tight hug.
When he reached Professor Tonks’s office he stormed inside without bothering to knock and found his Muggle Studies professor sat at her desk mid-bite into an enormous turkey sandwich.
“Shagging in the shower,” Harry chuckled.
“Not particularly,” he shrugged. “As I said before, I enjoy pushing your buttons. You’re so easy to wind up that it’s impossible to resist. See you later, Scarhead.”
His words did little to reassure Harry—and for good reason. The next morning, the owl post arrived with the latest issue of
“No,” Harry replied a little too quickly.
Draco crossed his arms and stared at his lap, saying nothing. Yes, he knew all too well what that was like, but he wasn’t inclined to admit it.
“Well, that took longer than I thought it would,” he mused.
“Well, it is supposed to be a Muggle interpretation of fairies,” Harry reminded him. “You’ll get less grief if you just roll with it, mate.”
“Oh for the love of god…” Harry groaned. “Malfoy, we can’t both play Tybalt!”
“Dungbombs are nothing,” Ginny argued. “Luna and I have spent most of the journey on guard duty outside Dennis Creevey’s compartment.”
“But you have access to all of the files,” he argued, his voice shaking. “You could just go into the cabinet, take out my folder and throw it away. There are so many names in there, they’ll never notice that one is missing…”
“The most fun I’ve had since coming back here has been talking to you,” Harry continued. “Which is such a weird thing to admit, but weird in a good way.”
“Then what are you doing here?”
Harry avoided Ron’s inquiring gaze and shrugged. “It was nothing, we just exchanged our usual pleasantries—he said that I was an idiot and I called him a pompous git.”
Harry walked around the perimeter of the stadium, mentally crossing his fingers that the broom shed was still in one piece. As he rounded the corner, Harry hissed a triumphant “yes!” under his breath as the old broom shed came into view. Despite the surrounding ground still bearing the scars of a hard-fought battle—scorch marks and upturned soil—miraculously, the shed remained untouched. Jogging towards the shed, he drew his wand and tapped the door with his wand.
Draco kissed Harry again before finally letting him go. Stepping out of the hotel room, they reverted back to their usual ‘just friends’ performance for the benefit of everyone else, walking side by side but no longer touching. Hermione, Ron and Ginny were waiting for Harry at the hotel entrance. Their cumbersome trunks took up most of the pavement, much to the bemusement of passing Muggles. When Ginny saw Harry and Draco approach, she greeted them with a slight wave.
Let’s get one thing clear: who I like and who I choose to spend time with is none of your business. End of story.”
“Are you sure that you’ve packed?” Mrs Weasley asked. “Because once you board that train, there’s no turning back.”
They watched as day in, day out, Liv repeated the same routine: filing paperwork, listening to the radio, crying herself to sleep, going to work, filing paperwork, listening to the radio… With each passing day she grew paler and thinner and more grey hair sprouted from her fair head.
“I’ve missed his rock cakes?” she said flatly. Ron sniggered.
and dangerous prank...you would do yourselves a favour by coming forward immediately. Because if you do not, I guarantee we will find out who you are and the punishment will be most severe,” she warned, her voice audibly shaking with anger. She scanned the room as though waiting for someone to raise their hand and admit responsibility, but nobody did. However unlikely that was to happen, she still looked disappointed.
“Things are a lot easier when we aren’t constantly at each other’s throats,” said Harry evasively, aggressively flipping to the next page of his book.
“It’s one of your most infuriating and most admirable qualities,” Draco said fondly. He brushed his lips against Harry’s forehead before kissing him. Harry smiled then and pressed a soft kiss to Draco’s lips, which he gladly returned. It felt good being able to be affectionate with Draco in public without having to worry about what other people would say or do. He’d miss this sort of freedom when they returned to Hogwarts after the holidays. When they broke the kiss, Draco nuzzled Harry’s neck and whispered, “So tell me, what happened to the snake?”
he didn’t really know anything about them other than what his father had told him about their family. Truth be told, he’d actually been quite fond of the twins and the antics that they got up to during their school days. And Ron...well, Ron was still a complete moron, but nonetheless, he remained Harry’s most loyal friend despite everything that they had been through together—despite Draco. It occurred to him then that perhaps Ron Weasley wasn’t as bad as he had originally thought, but he brushed
As Theo walked past he leaned close to Ron and whispered, “Just because he owes you a life debt doesn’t mean that you can take the piss; don’t use this to your advantage or else you’ll have me to deal with. I don’t owe either of you anything and you best remember that.”
“Almost,” he smiled before pulling her into a tight hug. “Thank you for everything.”
“Yeah, usually that’s my job,” Neville chuckled.
“This is the part where you kiss me, Potter.”
Dennis shook his head and mumbled, “No.”
“I’ll grant you entrance when the Headmistress is ready to see you,” he replied lazily, clearly delighting in the fact that he could still administer some power over Harry, even if it was from beyond the grave. Harry gritted his teeth in frustration but he gave a careless shrug.
“That’s great,” said Harry, absent-mindedly stroking Asha, who remained curled up on his lap. “I’ll need at least an Exceeds Expectations in Herbology if I’ve got any chance of joining the Auror Academy.”
“But the article’s not about Harry, is it?” Ginny pointed out, glancing at Draco.
“Not great,” he admitted. Ginny’s expression softened. She grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled him back under the shade of the apple tree.
Harry craned his neck to look over the heads of the other students and, sure enough, his two professors were sat together in the corner, whispering and giggling conspiratorially with one another, seemingly oblivious to everyone else around them.
Draco cleared his throat before speaking, “Morning, Potter.”
Draco turned right in the direction of the Great Hall, supposing that there was no harm in practising some lines of this silly play with Myrtle...
stamped along the edge of their wings swooped overhead, landing on various desks around the room, but they were being ignored as everyone chatted animatedly to one another.
“Well, I figured you wouldn’t want to take your pet into a Muggle hotel,” she chuckled, releasing him from her vice-like grip and patting him affectionately on the cheek. “I’m here to collect Arnold from Ginny as well. How was the train journey?”
that thing?” Ron asked, casting a disparaging eye over the vehicle.
A shrill whistle blew, signalling that the train was about to depart. Narcissa smiled encouragingly at her son.
“He was a very famous Muggle artist,” he explained. “I think you would like his paintings and sculptures. I can pick up a book with some of his artwork if you’d like?”
“It did cross my mind,” Minerva admitted.
“Sure did,” she confirmed, taking a sip from her cup.
Harry woke with a start to loud knocking at the door. He looked around the hotel room, bleary-eyed and momentarily confused as to where he was, only relaxing when he saw Draco sleeping soundly beside him. He’d never seen Draco like this before: his normally perfectly sculpted hair was mussed up and his expression, normally so tense, was completely relaxed. Harry thought that he looked so much younger as he slept, as though only in a world of dreams could he have some respite from the worries that plagued him in his waking hours.
Neville nodded and pointed his wand at Harry. “Ready?”
“We’ve missed you too, Hagrid,” said Harry with a sincere smile.
Draco resisted the temptation to insist that he wasn’t a defenceless child. Instead, he allowed Madam Pomfrey to peel off his sodden school robes, shirt and tie so that she could treat his wounds.
“Harry Potter and—” Harry held his breath. “—Draco Malfoy.”
Dennis nodded again. “For the Canary Creams and Bubotuber Pus in the post, the biting teacups and punching telescopes...all of it. It was me. It was all of us.”
Harry turned to Draco and gave him a wicked grin, “Well, I’d have to spend the night before I could make my mind up about that one way or another.”
“She’s very smooth,” he noted, lightly stroking her snow white fur.
The morning was fairly uneventful: he sat in the Great Hall having breakfast, nose deep in the latest issue of
Draco nodded and Harry slid off of his bed to sit on the edge of Draco’s. They fumbled for a moment passing the spectacles to one another. Draco shoved the glasses onto his face and immediately burst out laughing again.
“I don’t know if he was made aware of it before he sent my admissions letter.”
Harry sat up and positioned himself in front of Draco, crossing his legs and letting out a long breath before slowly closing his eyes.
“I don’t want to get used to them. I want to put as much distance between me and them as possible,” Draco replied irritably.
“He was pretty convincing when he was roaring and I thought he was going to bite your head off!”
“I mean, it’s not really suitable weather to be wearing this, is it?” Harry continued. “It’s October and we’re in the Scottish Highlands.”
Draco saw Harry sitting under an apple tree with Ginny by his side, her expression grave. Harry was trying desperately to force Draco out of his head but it was no use. He was forced to watch unblinkingly as the scene played out inside his own head.
“I can show you, if you like?” he offered.
Draco was taken aback at how amiable Hermione was being. He knew how to handle Ron and the others being snarky and defensive, but friendly was unfamiliar territory to him. He wondered if she had some ulterior motive for being so nice to him—it was no secret that she didn’t like him—but he couldn’t for the life of him think what that could be. Everyone at the table waited attentively for Draco to respond and he felt the heat rise in his cheeks under their scrutinising gaze.
“I’m fine,” he croaked, pushing his sweat-soaked hair from his eyes. Myrtle, however, wouldn’t take the hint and moved closer, studying Draco from different angles.
“No! Keep moving. Oh fuck. Oh fuck, yes,” Harry began rambling as Draco's cock slide in and out of his body, desperately grasping the bedsheets for purchase. “Oh god, you feel so big…”
“Oi! Mind who you’re talking to,” Ron warned, but Hermione didn’t look flustered by Neville’s outburst.
Draco waved goodbye to Ron and Hermione before climbing aboard the train, leaving the trio alone for the final time. Harry smiled nervously at his best friends.
“No. I am.”
“Ay, pilgrim,” Draco nodded. “Lips that they must use in prayer.”
Knocking on the bathroom door, he strode inside without waiting for a reply. “It’s me again. I brought your paper.” Predictably, there was no reply, but that didn’t mean that she wasn’t hiding in the u-bend. He opened the newspaper at the obituaries (her favourite section to read) and balanced it on the sinks at the far end of the room. He turned to face the seemingly empty bathroom and announced, “Just so you know, I’ll be away for the next couple of weeks, so I won’t be able to drop the Prophet off for you until I get back in January.”
Luna beamed at Harry. “Oh yes, I’d like that very much.”
“I wasn’t hiding from you,” he began to argue, but Ginny drew him a sharp look and he relented, “Well, not from you specifically. How did you see me?”
“You’ve heard of Shakespeare?” he asked curiously and Myrtle drew him a withering look.
“Mrs Weasley.” A surprised-looking Harry returned the embrace. “What are you doing here?”
Suddenly, the office door exploded off of its hinges and, amidst the smoke and flames, Yaxley’s imposing figure came into view. Pointing his wand at the doorway, he extinguished some of the flames so that he could reach Liv. Barely conscious, she used the last of her waning strength to raise her wand at Yaxley in a feeble effort to hex him, but he simply kicked the wand out of her hand. The wand skited across the floor before disappearing into the flames.
“Needed the money,” she shrugged. “I’ve spent the last year working full-time for the Order of the Phoenix but now that Voldemort’s gone, I needed to look for a proper job. With Amycus and Alecto Carrow in Azkaban—good riddance—I knew that there were a couple of vacancies going here at the school. I’ve got more experience fighting than I do with Muggles, so I asked McGonagall about the Defence post and I guess she thought I’d be a good fit for the job.”
the week before the summer holidays, but the play had magic in it, so naturally I wasn’t allowed to see it.”
“Good Godric, your aim was better when you had your eyes closed!” he chuckled.
Yet here he was now, tip-toeing through Hogwarts in the dead of night (well, a little after nine o’clock in the evening) hidden under an Invisibility Cloak with Harry. It was as surprising as it was riveting. They walked across the castle grounds in the direction of the Quidditch Stadium, the soft grass muffling their footsteps. Draco couldn’t help but marvel at the sight of his feet making impressions in the grass while the rest of him remained invisible.
“You kiss by th’book.” he joked.
“What do you want?” he asked, making no attempt to hide the irritation in his voice. Theo shrugged and pulled his script out from his back pocket.
“Fine. One more place and then we’ll call it a day. Where do you fancy going?”
“...But you don’t feel the same way.”
“You give people too much credit,” Ginny quipped. “If humans were so logical, then prejudice wouldn’t exist in the world. Prejudice by its very nature is illogical, but we still have bigotry against Muggle-borns and Squibs. And don’t get me started on the prejudices that Muggles have against their own kind, otherwise I’ll be here all bloody night!”
Draco grumbled under his breath but with no better options, he reluctantly followed as she weaved them through the crowds of Muggles. As they marched past the departures board, Draco felt a surge of relief as he spotted an exit in the distance. Stepping out of the station and onto the street, a huge Christmas tree in the centre of a festive market came into view. He followed Luna more willingly now, past a long stretch of brightly lit wooden shop fronts adorned with colourful Christmas decorations, selling an endless array of food, drinks and confections Draco had never seen before. Luna squeezed Draco’s hand to get his attention and nodded to the base of the Christmas tree. There stood Liv, Hestia, and the other students, waiting for them, just as Luna said they would be. When Liv caught sight of them, she looked relieved and waved them over.
“You think so?” asked Harry interestedly. Hagrid nodded.
“I’d rather not take the chance,” said Theo coldly. He turned to the others and said, “I don’t think there’s enough room in here for another person. What do you guys think?”
“And neither is she,” Liv argued. “Juliet is much more than her name and her status: she’s headstrong, confident, and she defies conventional expectations forced upon her. When I say that you and Juliet have a lot in common, I mean it in a complimentary way.”
The scene quickly changed and reformed into a small cottage kitchen. Liv sat at the kitchen table arguing with her cousin, Ted, while his wife, Andromeda, looked on in wary silence.
The tension which had bewitched their captive audience only moments before vanished in an instant and several of the students erupted into laughter at Luna’s overenthusiastic performance. Liv waved her hands trying to get Luna’s attention.
Ron slumped back into his chair and crossed his arms, looking irritable. “I don’t even know why we’re doing this. There are better things that I could be doing with my time than helping Slytherins.”
Harry raised his goblet. “We could start with a drink?”
“I come anon—but if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee—”
Ron stared at him for a few moments before walking past Draco back towards his vacant seat, but Draco’s eyes were fixed on the messaged scrawled on the window pane. He watched as the transparent letters dripped and pooled on the stone ledge, the weight of those words finally hitting him. He loved Harry. And just as he was finally able to admit it to himself, he might be about to lose him forever.
Harry leaned back from the window and slid the glass pane shut, feeling a little lost without his best friends by his side. Asha scurried up Harry’s jacket and snuggled into his neck, pulling him from his melancholy thoughts and back to the present. He made his way down the narrow corridor, swaying from side to side with the motion of the train as he struggled not to bump his backpack off of any disgruntled passengers that he passed. Eventually, he made it to the first First Class carriage, where he found Draco sitting alone, waiting for him in one of the compartments. When Harry slid the door open, Draco turned to him and his eyes lit up.
Harry pointed at his mouth and shook his head. It took Draco a moment to realise what Harry was trying to say before he whipped out his wand and pointed it at him.
“Malfoy, wait!” he shouted. “We haven’t finished practising our scene!”
“My only love sprung from my only hate,” Draco muttered, reading the tagline. He scrutinised the poster closely before musing, “Well, at least you got my good side.”
Theo huffed out a derisive laugh and drew Draco a disparaging look. “Well, then you’re certainly made for each other.”
“Not at all!” Liv assured her. “You’re welcome to borrow any of my books. It’ll be nice to have someone else to talk to about them; not many wizards are familiar with these titles.”
Harry balanced precariously on his tiptoes to look over the heads of the many people hurrying about Platform 9 ¾, his gaze fixed on two figures with platinum blonde hair standing at the opposite end of the platform. He still couldn’t believe that McGonagall had really given her blessing for Draco to return to Hogwarts. What on earth had possessed her? He had rather hoped that Draco had been playing an elaborate prank on him when they had bumped into each other on Diagon Alley, but seeing Draco here confirmed his worst fears. When Ginny noticed who Harry was ogling, she tsked and elbowed him in the ribs.
What surprised me the most was the way they just accepted that I was now a Slytherin and that they never tried to attack me or anything! I spent the whole weekend in my bed only leaving at night when they couldn’t see me and never once they tried something against me. They just accepted that I needed time and they gave that.  Yesterday at breakfast they even included me in their conversations, they were really nice to me. When I received your letter I could actually feel the love and the worry and I started crying, not my best moment I must admit, but they didn’t make fun of me. Draco even hugged me and petted my hair. It felt weirdly good.
-	Mister Potter, what are you doing in my class? Your year only has a lesson after tomorrow. – Snape was his usual self when he was around Harry.
“Tiring, mostly. Without you there it feels different. Some of the Gryffindors were not happy with your resorting and during the weekend it was basically the only thing people talked about. Ron was terribly upset and vocal about it, at some point I had to silencio him. I have been talking to him, he is hardheaded, you know that, but he is still your best friend he will come around. I am sure of it. And with what happened in DADA, I think showed him that just because you are in a different house that you will not chance. Just give him a few days and he’ll came talk to you.” Hermione said. “Now though the only thing you hear is death threats to Umbridge and people complaining about her. It looks like no one is happy with her.”
-	What did you want to talk to me about, Malfoy? – Asked Harry sitting in front of the blonde boy.
At that all students started looking at each other, a Defense class were a wand wasn’t needed was one of the weirdest things Harry ever heard and judging by his class mates reaction they were thinking the same. Still all students were seen putting their wands in their cape’s pockets.
-	Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident! - She said coldly.
With that, Harry looked to his scroll and started writing. When he was in his twentieth something line, the itching in his forearm was starting to get unbearable so he pushed back the sleeve of his shirt and was almost ready to scratch the skin when he noticed that a red spot had formed in his skin and in the middle of it the words «I must not tell lies» were starting to get noticeable. When he looked again to his scroll he notice that what he initially thought was black ink, was in reality dark crimson ink. It wasn’t necessary to be a genius to realize he had been writing with his own blood. He looked up to the teacher and she was looking at him with like she expected him to say something so he decided to keep quiet and not give her the satisfaction of hearing him complain. After all it wasn´t like he couldn´t handle the pain. Merlin knows he has felt worse.
-	 Detention, Mr. Potter! - said Professor Umbridge triumphantly while seating down thinking the discussion was over. - Friday evening. Five o’clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading.

-	And your name is? – The teacher asked with a sneer.
His uncle’s breakfast was ready in 10 minutes and in 20 Vernon Dursley was living the house headed for work. Harry went to the fridge were his chore list was waiting for him, today the list was short since Harry had to leave early to catch the train. He only needed to clean the kitchen and take care of the bushes in the front and back yard. He started on the kitchen first since he needed to clean the counter, mop and wash the floor and it had to already be dry by the time his aunt woke up.
“Mr Creevey, several students have reported seeing someone in a Guy Fawkes mask pouring a clear liquid into the punch bowl during festivities,” said Professor McGonagall. “What do you have to say for yourself?”
“No, it’s something infinitely more interesting than that,” he quipped, lifting the magazine again to block Hermione’s disapproving face from view. Unfortunately, it did nothing to block out the sound of her voice.
Harry gritted his teeth in frustration and glared at his best friend. “How much longer are you going to act like this?”
“You like it when I talk like this too, don’t you?” said Draco, his voice full of want. “There are so many things I could tell you, Harry. Would you like to hear about how I lie in bed every night, playing with myself and thinking of you?”
“Is that a Jarvey?” Neville asked with a worried note in his voice.
“Nothing that’s too much hassle to put on or take off again,” Harry continued. “And something that will hide my face.”
it or something. Merlin knows why. It’s a waste of bloody time, if you ask me...”
“Would you cut that out?”
Draco was cut off mid-sentence by Harry’s lips again. In truth, Harry had only kissed him this time because he wanted Draco to stop talking, but when Draco’s lips parted and Harry felt the flick of Draco’s tongue brush against his own lips, he couldn’t help the needy moan that was muffled by Draco’s mouth. Draco responded to this with surprising enthusiasm, bunching his fists in Harry’s shirt, pulling him closer to deepen the kiss. As Draco’s hot, wet tongue brushed against his own, Harry’s mind went blissfully blank. Draco had been right: that first kiss had been terrible. But this...Harry wasn’t able to put it into words, but that elusive ‘spark’ that everyone had talked about had suddenly hit Harry like the Hogwarts Express; the synapses in his brain were firing like a box of Wildfire Whiz-bangs and Harry couldn’t get enough of it.
“No, I think that’s probably the case for a lot of them,” Neville relented. “But that just makes them cowards in my book.”
“Right away, ma’am.”
“Wow. Thanks very much, Potter, that makes me feel much better about myself,” Draco sneered.
“Why can’t we just go in now?”
Draco watched as the hatred between the feuding families escalated, ending in bloodshed. Despite Romeo and Juliet’s love for one another, Romeo now lay dead at Juliet’s side. Juliet wept openly, stroking Romeo’s pale, lifeless face as her sobs echoed through the sombre silence of the theatre. Draco tried to swallow down the lump stuck in the back of his throat but it refused to budge. Hoping that she might die by the same poison, Juliet kissed Romeo, but to no avail. Instead, she unsheathed Romeo’s dagger and held the tip of the blade to the centre of her chest. She still had tears streaming down her cheeks, but when she spoke, she sounded resolute.
“Honestly? I didn’t think he was even capable of constructing full sentences,” Ron quipped. Neville grunted, his normally jovial face set in an angry scowl.
“I’ve been busy,” she protested weakly, taking a bite from a piece of shortbread. “I’ve had quite a lot on my plate, you know.”
Harry couldn’t help but notice that she didn’t deny that this was the fate that awaited Draco that if he did, in their eyes, let Harry down, but he thought better than pressing the matter any further.
The group made their way down the hall, passing two long counters on either side where numerous goblins sat on stools, scribbling in ledgers and weighing precious jewels. It was only when they reached the opposite end of the hall and approached one of the free goblins that Harry finally removed his cloak. As soon as he whipped it off, the goblin did a double take at his sudden appearance. Upon seeing the scar on his forehead, the goblin’s eyes narrowed.
Draco’s shame quickly turned into anger and frustration. He’d made a fool of himself in front of everyone and they’d never let him live it down. Without consciously thinking about where he was going, Draco’s feet carried him up the marble staircase along the second floor corridor towards the one place he’d felt safe within Hogwarts. When Draco burst into Myrtle’s bathroom, he found his spectral friend floating a few inches off of the ground reading a discarded magazine. She looked up sharply when the door flew open but her face broke out into a wide grin when she realised who it was.
from the window display before dumping them all on the counter manned by a bemused shop assistant. Although he couldn’t hear what Harry was saying, by the angry expression on his face and the way that he was wildly gesticulating with his arms, Draco could take an educated guess. Sure enough, the assistant disappeared from sight only to return moments later with another bundle of magazines. Harry thrust a handful of gold coins into the assistant’s hand, grabbed his purchase and exited the shop.
Liv set the script in front of Draco and walked back to the front of the class to begin the lesson, pointedly ignoring Draco, who stared daggers at her. Harry thought that Draco might storm out of the classroom in a fit of temper, but he sat for the duration of the lesson with his arms crossed, glaring at the script with the utmost contempt.
Liv nodded mutely and took a bite from her biscuit.
To his immense relief, however, Hermione appeared somewhat mollified by his appearance. While Ron lingered awkwardly by the doorway, she walked straight up to Harry and shook her head. “I should have known something like this was going to happen. Every bloody year without fail there’s drama in some shape or form! If it’s not mountain trolls in bathrooms, it’s basilisks and secret chambers, or triwizard tournaments, or Umbridge—and now this!” She flopped down onto the settee next to the fire and tore off the garland from her head. “It would be nice if just for one year—just one year—our Halloween celebrations weren’t ruined!”
Harry tacked on the title for good measure and it earned him an amused expression from his old Potions master.
“Harry!” Mr Weasley called, beckoning him over. “Bring your trunk over!”
For anyone who didn’t know them, the best indicator for when Harry and Ron were quarrelling was if there was any disruption to their morning routine. Every day, without fail, they would accompany each other to breakfast. But if they were angry with each other, then they would go to the Great Hall separately and sit at opposite ends of the Gryffindor table. Depending on the nature of the dispute, Hermione would have the unenviable choice of who to sit with during mealtimes until the dispute was resolved. While Ron’s reaction the previous evening had been better than Harry had anticipated, he was still half-expecting to find his best friend’s bed empty when he got up. So when he threw open the curtains around his four-poster, he was pleasantly surprised to find Ron still there, pulling on his school robes with immense effort. He looked up at Harry with a grumpy expression, his eyes pink and puffy from lack of sleep.
“Mr Malfoy,” with a mouthful of food she gave Draco a mumbled greeting and motioned for him to take a seat in front of her desk. “Thank you for coming to see me.”
As the three Weasleys argued amongst themselves about how to best pack the trunks into the car, Hermione turned to Draco and gave him a small smile.
“We’ll need to do a couples costume, Ron!” said Hermione excitedly, hooking their arms together. “Maybe something historical. Oh! We could dress up as Shakespearean characters! Titania and Oberon, perhaps?”
“Do you want me to help you search for him?” Harry offered, but Neville declined.
“Mm, I like the sound of that,” he murmured, earning him a licentious grin from Harry.
“I thought you enjoyed making grand entrances?” Draco teased. Harry glared at him.
“Because none of that matters now!” Harry cried. “This stupid rivalry that we had going, it was nothing but childish playground antics. Yeah, he was a complete bellend a lot of the time—”
“It’s a matter of principle,” he argued. “I won’t pretend to be something that I’m not. I’m not ashamed of what I am or where I came from.”
he thought to himself. Ginny’s cry was much closer than Mrs Weasley’s. Evidently, she had been sent out to look for him. Not wanting to be found quite yet, he instinctively reached for his Invisibility Cloak but paused when he realised that he had left it along with his rucksack back at the house. Pulling his wand from the front pocket of his shorts, he twirled it around himself as though he were coiling an invisible rope around his body. He shivered as the sensation of cold, raw egg travelled down the top of his head and down his back. After a few seconds, he looked down and smiled to himself; his body was now the exact colour and texture of the grass and tree. Now invisible to the naked eye, he would just have to keep quiet enough until Ginny walked past.
“You’re fucking gorgeous, you know that?” Harry breathed. He wrapped his hand around the base of Draco’s cock and gave it a tight squeeze before swiping the flat of his tongue over the tip. Draco groaned and his grip in Harry’s hair tightened. Harry let out a high-pitched sound like a whimper and took more of Draco’s length into his mouth.
“Not particularly.”
“Please, Olivia,” he begged. “We’ve been friends for years, haven’t we? That must count for something!”
“They actually have quite a lot in common, if you must know,” she continued. “They’re both big fans of the Holyhead Harpies—”
have to Muggle Studies?”
“No, I wasn’t!” she protested hotly.
“Lung cancer, right?”
“Well tough luck, Potter, I’ve been practising Tybalt’s part as well,” said Draco.
“Well, broadly, the office was charged with issuing cultural and educational content to the Wizarding public. My work was primarily liaising with No-Maj-borns and their families who had no previous knowledge of the magical world until they had received their admissions letter to Ilvermorny,” she explained. “It was my job to help them make a smooth transition from No-Maj to Wizarding life as well as get them up to speed with Wizarding Laws and Regulations. You see, the Americans spend a large amount of their resources toward keeping the Wizarding community hidden from Muggle. Their legislation is incredibly strict, much more restrictive than it is here, to the point of being regressive in my personal opinion.”
Harry drew Draco a devilish grin. “I was going to suggest going to the pub, but that sounds like a lot more fun.”
“I suppose you’re right,” he said uncertainly. “I mean, it’s not like I have to tell them about it, not now anyway. It’s not like Potter and I are officially dating or anything.”
Ron gave a careless shrug. “Put a note up on the common room noticeboard asking if anyone knows who P.A. is?”
“Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?” asked Harry.
“I never pegged you as the cuddling type,” he mused. Harry’s body tensed but he didn’t move away.
Harry laughed. “That’s what the tree’s saying, is it?”
Neville didn’t look entirely convinced. “You really think so? What do you think, Harry?”
“She could have bitten me!” Draco seethed.
“Yes, I’m sure that you’ll be rushing off to tell your friends all about how much fun you had with Draco Malfoy.”
“This,” he yawned. “Knowing nobody’s going to barge into the room in the next five minutes and interrupt us. Just lying here with you...all of it, really. You touching my hair feels pretty good too. ‘Snice.”
“I want to make you come,” Harry purred, tightening his grip around Draco’s prick. “Want to feel you come inside of me.”
The corner of Draco’s mouth twitched slightly and his eyes narrowed. “Ah yes. The Dursleys…”
Hermione looked momentarily confused before a look of dawning appeared on her face. “Oh Harry, of course not! Your sexuality is just a part of who you are. Did you really think I would take issue with that?”
Draco still felt unsure as to whether or not he was going to stick it out at Hogwarts, but whoever had sent him the bubotuber pus was pushing him dangerously close to packing his trunk and getting as far away from the school as possible. The only thing that was stopping him from leaving right now (apart from being in desperate need of medical assistance) was the thought of whoever who had done this to him seeing him run out of the Great Hall, never to return. No, he didn’t want to give his haters the satisfaction of watching him be run out of Hogwarts with his tail between his legs. It was going to take more than a lame prank to get rid of Draco Malfoy. He’d survived Voldemort; this would be a walk in the park by comparison...
“Very good, Mr Malfoy!” Hestia clapped Draco on the back. “Very good indeed. Well, since you’ve already mastered the basics, would you care to give the other students a few pointers?”
“Of course there is! I have the entire day mapped out to the minute,” she argued. “We’d have had a little
“That good, eh?” Myrtle sighed and looked wistful. “Fifty years surrounded by lovesick teenagers, watching romances blossom and fizzle out and bloom again. Most of the other ghosts complain about not being able to eat anymore—they miss the taste of food, the sensation of a full belly—but that’s not what I miss the most. I remember that feeling of butterflies in your stomach every time you lay eyes on that special someone. I miss the feeling of my heart racing in my chest if they caught my eye, and when they smiled it would fill you up like a hot drink. I’d give up an eternity walking this earth just to experience that feeling one more time.”
"Do you have a warrant?" Harry crossed his arms across his chest and straightened himself in front of them.
Pansy would just shush him with a simple
Pansy could have married her then and there. She was the absolute
Harry shrugged:
"Why?" Hermione turned to him with a confused glint in her eyes.
Sam swallowed a chuckle and said nothing, but he did arch an eyebrow. It was incredibly scintillating, being the one playing the mind games instead of Draco for once. To turn the tables:
a coward. You bribe and lie and weasel to escape the consequences of your actions and bow before a madman because you're too bloody
Harry's eyes wandered back to Draco of their own accord. When didn't they? He looked tired and—small, the way he was slumped over in the chair. Usually, Harry wasn't much for cold, hard reason and logic, he trusted his feelings and gut to guide him. But the tightness of his chest and the slow lump in his throat when he looked at Draco were not feelings he could trust. For all his Gryffindor, he didn't dare. To their credit though, most of the time they weren't there.
"You're telling me
"Like Harry..." Ron finished Draco's sentence, voice quiet, full of disbelief.
Harry nodded and carried Malfoy to his office and deposited him on the couch each office had so the Aurors could take a bit of a break every so often. It was imperative that Malfoy rests now. Feeling kind of shaky from seeing the unpinched, gentle expression on the blonde's face as he slept, Harry scribbled him a quick note and hastily left.
Boy, did he notice.
"You're wrong either way." Malfoy informed him, and that seemed to be the final note of that conversation, as Malfoy smoothly kept talking:
There was a smattering of little stings across his face, and Harry itched to trace them with his fingers and heal them up. Just to touch him in general.
"There was even word that they would get married in another year's time, but then—
He'd gotten himself back on track. He spoke to Harry every day, about his day and how he was. Harry always responded in kind. He slammed doors when Draco had told him a coworker attempted to flirt with him, which made Draco inordinately happy to see, that Harry still loved him enough to get jealous. He rumbled and shook the entire house when Draco had come home happy because he'd gotten a promotion, to the point that he knocked Draco over in his quaking.
Draco was surprised, that much was obvious, but he returned the nod.
"Hello—I'm looking for Draco?" The young man spoke, his sentence rising to a question as he realized he was staring at Draco's mother.
"Yeah?" He didn't know the point of the statement. There was something—tentative in Draco's voice.
Draco sat up in bed and stretched. He checked the time—almost time to get up anyways. Alright. He stood up and went to the bathroom to shower and piss.
"Perhaps? But why? We wouldn't take the piss out of them for anything.." Harry mused, heart clenching tightly at the thought that Draco didn't trust him and felt the need to hide something.
Arriving at Hogwarts again had felt so—strange. Relieving, but strange. It was still home, Harry reckoned it always would be, but now it felt more vigilant, wary. Perhaps Harry was just paranoid.
Draco glances down the hall and imagines Harry dressing behind the closed door: soft cotton smoothing over firm abs; swimming trunks riding up his thighs. The plan was to get coffee and egg bagels on the road to the surf shop so they’d make their lessons by eleven.
"I —" Harry swallows. "I thought they were daffodils."
Draco guides Harry's head down. Their lips brush, softening. Harry brings his hand up, drawing them closer, but the clink of the vase between them stops him, and they pull apart.
Draco laughs. "I absolutely did."
“Aw, shite.”
"Well," Draco hesitated. "I might want them someday." He fell into an impasse again, stuck trying to explain something he only felt. If only Harry was more like Pansy, who never asked questions. No, Draco didn't really want that. He only wanted Harry to be Harry.
"He didn't," I said. I tried but couldn't make sense of his face; it wasn't like I looked at him when I lived in his head.
"I've only worked at Nylon for three months," Eltanin laughs at Harry's mortification. He pats Harry on the back. "It's fine. Honestly, I did think you were a bit of a dick at first, but Draco kept on saying you were going through a hard time, and, well. After a week, I could see that. You were the saddest puppy at the club."
Draco swallowed, then coughed, hoping to hack up a sensible lie. But one look into her eyes, and the truth came stumbling out.
"Yeah, why?" Harry asks. He tries to fix his glasses but only smudges them more.
Harry is bare-chested and laughing when Draco opens his eyes.
"Okay, now you," Draco says.
Harry sips the amber. "Malfoy, huh."
"Just not to my...my—here." He pats the comforter, words choking his throat.
“Hurry. Harry. Harry.” Numb fingers slip sweaty from Harry’s shirt. Draco’s robes are wet with blood, and everywhere Harry touches is cold.

“Isn’t that a bit much?” Harry protests, despite knowing better than to undermine the Headmistress’s authority when he was a faculty member himself.
he said. I didn’t have the heart to tell him no.
"Yeah, how did you not know? Your fridge was empty for months before I started dropping food off. You lost so much weight that the Prophet thought you were going for some kind of method acting role. Nevermind the fact that you couldn't act to save your life—well, except that one time, at the Manor—"
"Potter. Harry Potter," Harry says, his smile broadening when the man fails to falter in recognition. "Not for my mum, no," Harry says, though he considers a bouquet for his kitchen, fresh flowers to brighten his day. He misses his mum like a peacock might miss the sky, a phantom void carved into his soul. His mum could have hated her namesake. Harry would never know.
“How is it?”
I tried joking, but Potter had hidden himself away again, giving me full reign of his limbs. I wriggled his toes; they cramped at the tip.
Harry brushes down the front of his leather jacket. His hand settles over his belt, and he twines a finger between a hoop.
“I…” Harry blinked.
Harry took the bag. It crinkled under his fist, crackling like lightning down his spine. Desperately, he missed the quiet behind the door.
By then, it's only a quarter past noon, but Harry sinks back into bed anyway, phone in hand. He catches up with himself. His calves look good coming down his front steps that morning, and he's got about a thousand notifications from people tagging him in their BroomBod screenshots. "Can't believe I took a ride with
that."
"I don't want to be just friends!" Draco yells. He slaps a hand over his mouth, shocked as anyone by his own words.
"Let's start with the smallest space," Draco says. He pulls the door open with a jerk, and Harry, coughing, sends three doxies back with a wordless Knockback Jinx.
"You don't know?" Ron blinks. "You seriously don't know? I owled you the details yesterday."
"Do it. Merlin, do it." Harry leans in, tilting his head, his hands steady on Draco's shoulders. His head is dizzy from the praise or from the lights; he isn't sure.
"You take care of yourself, okay," Dean says when it's clear that nobody's coming to throw them all back behind bars. "Maybe drink a little less. Your mum worries—"
Time flies easy, broomback—buildings, matchstick-height; the castle between two fingers. Beyond the forest are mountains, and slumbering between, a mustard meadow a smear of yellow and green. Time flies easy, broomback—weaves between then and now; leaves time for what could’ve been. It’s in these gaps that he meets Draco, again.
"Malfoy," Harry says.
"Good. She gave me another speech to prep."
"I'm not—"
Luckily for him, Ron's an easy mate to distract. Get him to slide his big hands around the waist of a pretty bird with a soft mouth, and he'll show her to the back, press her up against a wall; maybe take her all the way home and ask if she wants to stay for breakfast.
Harry said he didn’t care what I looked like, I was rotten to the core. But in a good way. Everyone rots in the end. It was only trouble if you tried to stop.
"Want any?" Harry asks. He walks to her barefoot. It takes him more than a few strides because his kitchen is so excessively massive.
"They made me think of you," Harry says because it's the truth and hopes that it's enough for Draco to see how much he wants him.
“I’ll wear it tomorrow.”
Harry watches the green LED pulse like a twitch in his eye. Everything’s too bright—the fire escape cutting under his skin, his jumper scratchy around his throat. He’s suffocating on skunk weed, his eyes a glassy, glaucous green.
Harry feels the smirk coming; can’t stop it from devouring his face. He stomps on the pedal.
"You're telling me that you woke up in Limbo, but you weren't let on the train."
“You did.”
Eltanin finishes trimming the stems and sets the arrangement on the counter next to a box of cream-filled biscuits. He digs through a few drawers, continuing his search for a pen, until Harry finally bores of watching and transfigures a red marker out of butcher paper scraps.
"Yeah?" Harry asks. "What did you like about it?" He slams the door to his car. The car beeps once in annoyance before driving off to park itself in the back.
Pearl-white paints over fog-grey. Paint it over, Harry thinks. Paint it over, and maybe you'll love it again.
"I am, yeah."
remarkable, even when she's using him. Harry nearly stumbles over his words when he catches Malfoy ushering stragglers to their seats.

“You’re so bloody predictable,” Draco says.
Hermione hums around the spoon of cake in her mouth.
"My name's Harry," Harry said, his breath coming out controlled. "I know you're dense, but Merlin. Put another—"
Harry’s not worried. He didn’t pin Malfoy down today, but he will. Malfoy’s guilty. It’s only a matter of catching him in the act.
I couldn’t meet her eyes, so I looked at her hands, watching her fiddle the peridot on her pinky. I wasn’t sure if I should’ve gleaned its significance. Then she coughed, and I realized that her mask had slipped.
it were—"
“You alright?” Draco asks. His legs dangle off a step, above the trees.
"I — " Harry blinks, surprised. "Yes? You don't need to pretend in front of me. I know exactly who you are."
Harry was unbuckling his Quidditch leathers. "You fucked anyone before?"

Harry had owled his usual escort to meet him at the station by way of the Hogwarts Express. The attendant took his one bag and asked if he'd take a photo with him, for his niece, to which Harry obliged, crossing his arms and scowling at the camera in a way that, these days, was more patently him than his scar. The attendant handed him the photo to sign, and Harry obliged once more, though his quill stilled over his image. Never in his life would he understand what possessed people to want Harry Potter scribbled over a photo of a bearded man wearing dark sunglasses and a striped sweatband.
The rest of the night is a blur. Harry wakes to a strongly worded owl from Hermione and has a late breakfast with Ron, who's too damn chipper at noon for a guy who got stood up the previous night. After, Harry trails Ron to his Crossfit gym, pushing around tires until Ron tells him to stop.
I sat forward, peeking around McGonagall's crimson cap down to where they chained my body to the chair in the centre. Circe's tits. I looked awful, and I said so as loudly as I could in Potter’s mind.
Harry swallows. "What do you mean?"
cw: dementor kiss (with happyish ending??)
Harry picks out the useful words and pieces them together:
"What?" Harry snorts. So what if he's picking out all the crab? Ron doesn't even like shellfish. Says it's like chewing on sea spiders. "I'm doing you a favour," Harry says, popping another bite in his mouth.
Ron interrupts him with a deliberately loud suck of his horchata, but he's all big-eyed when Harry shoots him a look. "What?" Ron shrugs. "It's a reasonable question. You hated him for a long, long time."
Does he dream of me?
In his trunk he found his Hogwarts texts, quills, robes—straight to the fire. His father's letters and ring—burned as well. His mother's favourite novel:
And they lived happily ever after.
“Peach,” Harry says.
Harry has no idea how the fridge never seems to empty. He doesn't remember ordering any of it. But every box is half-eaten, and Harry lives alone, so he knows it
