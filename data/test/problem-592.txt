“That’s the one,” Lovegood said, clearly not sensing the immense atmospherical shift, reaching down to scratch the dog again. “Phoebe belongs to him, so it makes sense that he was the most worried out of all of us. He went out this morning looking for her.”
He picked up a rounded pebble near his shoe, weighing it in his hands as he squinted up at the window, a soft strip of orange skewing through the darkness and planting a seed on the fertile black sky.
“Yes!” Luna’s face lit up pleasantly, clearly surprised that he'd managed to remember something. “Have you been reading that book series I gave you for Christmas?”
“That’s alright.” She propped herself up on her elbows. “I could make myself busy for an hour or so. Does Phoebe need a walk? I could take her around the orchard.”
“Merlin,” Hermione sighed before standing up and steadying herself on the back of the booth. “I’m closing our tab now. Harry, can you find Draco and Theodore so we can start heading out? I haven’t seen either of them in ages.”
It had taken weeks for him to find a job, given that no one would hire him on Diagon because of his name. He’d been forced to turn his efforts into the Muggle world, a task that felt like tripping headfirst into a pool of freezing water. The Muggle world was a shock to his system. There had been so many forms to fill out, so many dotted lines to sign, so many numbers and instructions that Draco had nearly drowned in them. But he got a job, nevertheless, at a fast food joint ten minutes from Diagon and the neglected lodging house that he’d been shoved into.
It wasn’t the over-the-top kind of drunk, though, like how they’d been at the bar the other night; it was the warm kind of drunk. The kind of drunk where they sat on opposite sides of Harry’s sofa with their legs crossed and drank elf-made wine out of Mason jars, because Harry told Draco it was “the classy way” to drink wine and Draco didn’t believe him, but did it anyway. It was the kind of drunk where they didn’t speak for long stretches of time, staring off into some transient vanishing point fixed in the centre of the room, and when they did speak up, their words were diluted and nonsensical, their questions quietly careless.
Malfoy nodded, casting his gaze towards the fire. Something made Harry want to get up and grab the curve of his chin to tug him back in place so he could meet Luna’s eyes. “I do,” Malfoy said. “I was very young, so it’s all a bit fuzzy, but I remember her. I was introduced to her at some event that I probably didn’t care much about, but I remember liking her robes the best out of everyone there.”
“Everyone leaves a key under the mat, Harry,” she cut him off blithely. “It’s human nature at this point.”
Luna surveyed the Slytherins for a moment, then decided, “I’ll take Pansy and Theodore, you take Draco. Will that work?”
Draco flipped her off as he pushed past, rucking his collar up against the cold. “Wretched woman. Don’t get kidnapped while we’re gone.”
“Harry,” she began to chide, but then she didn’t get a chance to finish her thought because, like an angel descending from heaven, a sleek black cab slowed to a stop in front of the curb and the driver’s window rolled down.
“Almost,” Hermione said faintly, reaching out to shake Pansy’s hand limply. Ron looked like he was on the verge of passing out next to her. Harry watched them carefully, terrified of the very real fact that this interaction could either make or break the whole night. Malfoy and Nott were both standing very still behind Parkinson, their faces bleached white amid the shifting electric light.
That’s what these were. Twenty-two years old and Harry was having boy problems. But putting it that way sounded so much cheaper, so much flimsier than he felt they should be. These feelings felt solid and blazing and rooted so deep in his chest it was almost like they’d been there all his life.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, finally turning around to meet Malfoy head-on, still wringing the dishtowel in his hands so he wouldn’t reach across the counter and strangle the man. “I don’t fucking know. But rest assured, I’m certainly regretting it now.”
chair. “Parkinson’s here too?” Harry asked him, voice laden with malice. “Did you happen to bring the entire Slytherin dormitory with you, or did you just hand-pick the racist ones?”
Sure enough, Ron and Hermione were sitting together on high bar stools at the very end of the bar, heads bent close and tinted red under the ambient lighting. Ron was the first one to lift his head and spot them, and a wide, goofy smile broke out on his face as he lifted his arm to wave them over. “Harry!”
Another car honks outside, and Harry looks away. Back out the window. The watery clouds have completely cleared now, leaving behind an unobscured pearl of light that crowns the terraced rooftops of London like a piece of fine jewelry. Gibbous and full.
“No,” Harry agreed as he folded a napkin and set it neatly next to Draco’s place setting, “you don’t.”
He thought more than once about going downstairs and reopening his Floo for the first time in months so he could call Luna and ask her to come over. She would know what to do. She would help talk him down and stroke his hair and tell him everything was going to be okay, and he’d believe her. He also thought about calling Hermione, but calling Hermione would mean calling Ron, and Harry couldn’t talk about these things with him. He couldn’t talk about boy problems.
He was startled awake painstakingly early in the morning by the familiar thud of the front door and a voice shouting his name up the stairwell, loud and boisterous.
“Had a little adventure, did you?” he asked, but all he got in return was a strange little wiggle and a sloppy attempt to try and lick his face. Luna laughed merrily.
“Sounds good.” He stopped, propping his own ladder against one of the bigger trees. It was skewing towards the end of the harvest season, December looming dark and chilly right around the corner, so the branches weren’t as heavy with fruit as usual. They were still plentiful enough to fill up a couple of crates that could be shuttled to the farmers’ market in town, but the bulk of the orchard had already been harvested earlier that month—with Neville and Luna’s help, of course. Harry couldn’t imagine picking the whole crop on his own.
“Oh, okay, yeah, found it.” Without warning, Neville Longbottom appeared in the hall, holding a metal contraption that Draco assumed was the bottle opener. He seemed to pale a bit at the sight of Draco and the rest, but he quickly shook it off and plastered on a placid smile. “Hello. Living room’s through this way.”
“Because she has more organization skills and taste in one fingernail than you have in your entire body,” Draco says matter-of-factly, brushing a hand through the curls at the back of Harry’s neck.
“Yes,” Harry answered, giving up and slumping back in his seat. “It’s only, like, one guy though. I think his name might be Erwin. Or Edgar? Something with an E.”
Potter’s mouth twisted nastily, as if he was bracing himself for another argument, but he stopped halfway through. With what looked like some difficulty, he let his rigid shoulders drop and his head tilt back. “Okay,” he said.
“Yes, well, my mother was quite set on me being a housewife,” Parkinson replied, rolling her eyes skyward and sinking back into her chair. “I think she was even hesitant to send me to Hogwarts, let alone university. She didn’t want me to be ‘indoctrinated.’ A witch’s role is in the home, after all.”
“A sick man,” Harry echoed nonsensically, shaking his head and dropping his handful of silverware onto the dining table. “Fine, whatever. I don’t even know why I’m arguing. Try not to set my house on fire, please.”
“No,” Draco said, shaking his head and shutting that idea down immediately. “She’ll get back just fine on her own. She always leaves right before lunch.”
He wished he were surprised that the lump didn’t move, but he wasn’t; Phoebe was about the single laziest sheepdog on the planet, and she didn’t like to do things if there wasn’t a guaranteed reward. One of those things was, apparently, protecting her one and only owner from trespassers.
“I’ll take the trees over here?” Luna asked, dragging her ladder past Harry to a small grove facing East.
“If you went back,” Neville suggested like the conciliatory angel he was, “you could just ask him. With words. Nouns and verbs and all that good stuff.”
“Come to bed,” he says after breaking away and landing delicate kisses on the corners of Harry’s mouth, his smile lines, the space between his eyebrows. Harry lets him, content to lean back and lose himself in the warmth and familiarity of it all. The homeliness.
“Our home sounds nice,” he says once he’s settled back between the linen sheets, glasses folded on the pile of books next to the mattress, knees bumping into Draco’s like they do every night. “I like it.”
His house felt suddenly quiet without their voices. Suddenly cold. The windows outside were completely black, lying in wait.
“Good.” She scooted closer so she could hook her leg around his. It wasn’t very comfortable, but Draco appreciated her closeness. Her warmth. “Now,” she said once she was settled, “tell me what’s on your mind.”
Around the corner, there was another set of stairs—less rickety, but just as dusty as the ones in the basement—that crawled up into where he assumed the bedrooms were. “Phoebe?” he called, then sagged in relief when he heard the telltale click of paws and the jingle of metal dog tags. She appeared at the top of the stairs and whined happily when she saw Harry, bumbling down them ungracefully and nearly slipping on the hardwood. “Stupid animal,” Harry said affectionately, rubbing her mane and mussing up the fur around her ears. “Let’s get out of here, shall we?”
It was Saturday, meaning it was farmers’ market day, and Harry was scheduled for a nine o’clock slot. Nev and Luna loved farmers’ market day more than he did; they were great with customers, and they didn’t mind hanging out together under a white spindly tent for two to three hours, feet kicked up on the fold-out counter, jackets zipped up to their chins. Harry was a little more impatient, and he tended to get skittish when the crowds got bigger towards the afternoon. But if he wanted to keep his mortgage, he had to sell at least half of what he harvested, so he tried not to complain.
As the evening fermented and soberness slowly began leaking out of the room, Phoebe lumbered down from upstairs and collapsed at the foot of Harry’s favorite armchair, her chin resting on Malfoy’s feet. Malfoy barely spared her a glance, reaching down to scratch her head almost automatically as if he’d been doing it every day of his life. The sight of that was what prompted Harry to disrupt the ebbing conversation and ask quite carelessly, “What the hell are you all doing here, anyway?”
“I assure you we haven’t,” Parkinson said tersely, back as straight as the chair she was perched in.
Theo grinned in the way he did whenever he was well on the right side of tipsy, all crooked and thin-lipped. “Maybe a bit. How could you tell?”
“Should be,” Harry replied, skimming his wand to the area and feeling a slight ripple of magic. “Yes, that’s it. What symbol is missing, do you think?”
The house itself had been perfectly adequate, but to Draco it had been much more than that. It had multiple windows and beds that weren’t on the verge of collapse; it had a kitchen and a bathroom and a stocked fridge, and he felt like he’d stepped into heaven. There had been sleeping bags laid out in the living room and suitcases lined up along the walls, and Greg and Theo had been sitting in the middle of all of it, looking no worse for wear.
“Right, because you’re so financially unstable,” Draco said disbelievingly. Then, “Where are your saucepans?”
“I’m Luna,” she said when she finally reached them, holding out her soft, pale hand to shake Theo’s. Theo looked terrified, but he shook it anyway. “It’s nice to finally meet you.”
“What would be a crime against humanity?” Theo asked through a yawn as he padded into the kitchen, one side of his hair sticking up completely vertical like he’d just been electrocuted.
“Right,” Potter said, breaking eye contact. “Right, yeah, of course. Sorry. I just—it’s clicking for me, now.” He glanced back up, almost furtively. “For what it’s worth, Hermione and I thought that rule was preposterous. Especially for juveniles. It’s on her political agenda to get it repealed, I think.”
at it so she wouldn’t track it into the house. He then did the same thing to Phoebe’s paws, causing her to sneeze in surprise and then try to lick Harry’s face a second time.
“I mean, only if Harry’s okay with it.” Pansy looked at Potter directly. “Are you okay with it? We haven’t been out for drinks in months. Not since we moved here, I think.”
“Maybe I should go over there more,” he said to no one in particular. Luna hummed a benign agreement and Phoebe wagged her tail, brushing Harry’s dirt-smudged knees and making him smile.
“You think so?” Draco had asked gravely, dropping his small bag of clothing onto the floor and slumping down next to Greg on the squishy sofa.
“Let me get this straight,” Weasley was saying next to her, large elbows propped up on the table and shoulders hunched as he stared disbelievingly at Potter. “You all met each other because of your
“It’s possible,” Harry said, though he wasn’t sure how interesting a bunch of overgrown bushes could be. When he said this out loud, Neville gasped in offense from the backseat.
“Pansy.” Malfoy turned to Parkinson, who was wearing a tight, shimmery black dress that looked far too thin for her to be wearing without a Warming Charm. “Tell him how ugly his dungarees are.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said through his teeth, stepping around an overturned lawn chair and coming to stand at the bottom of the porch.
“You’re going to have to tell me all about them.” Parkinson dropped Hermione’s hand, then looked around at the group questioningly. “Now, are we going to get a table, or what?”
“None of your business,” Parkinson snapped suddenly, a look of instant regret passing over her face less than a second later. “Shit, I—sorry. It’s—Draco’s right, we haven’t done anything illegal. That’s all you need to know.”
“I feel like I should start charging you rent,” he told her one hazy evening after the Slytherins had said their goodbyes and stumbled out the front door, Malfoy’s arm around Parkinson’s shoulder, Theodore Nott humming “Pinball Wizard” off-key under his breath.
He supposed it was also weird because he’d only owned Phoebe for a few months, and she hadn’t really felt like
There was a short stretch of park right across the street where a few stragglers huddled together under a streetlight, smoke clouding their heads, and Luna pointed to them. “I’ll check the park, you check the alley? They can’t have gone far.”
“Nah, not ‘Mione.” Harry shakes his head even though Draco’s decided that looking at him is too exhausting a task to carry on. “She thinks wedding traditions are too heteronormative and commercialized.”
His infatuation with the house was undeniable; he could see past the mulchy lawns and faded wallpaper, the metal furniture in the yard crawling with weeds and ivy, the duck pond around the front that was so brown it was almost black. All he could see was potential—fifteen acres of potential.
“There we go,” Draco repeated mildly, staring at the remains of his wand like he’d never seen it before. It was hard to believe that this was the wand that had chosen him all those years ago. That this was the wand he’d cast a thousand
“I’m lost,” Harry said weakly, heart slamming against his ribcage, their words spinning a hurricane in his head. They couldn’t possibly mean—
Harry put his hands over his face again, like he couldn’t bear to hold his own head up. “I don’t plan on it,” he said, muffled.
“Seconded,” Hermione said, her earrings clinking as she tipped her head back. “Do I still have feet? It feels like I don’t have feet anymore.”
In late November, she helped him string up Christmas lights around his windows and along the railing of his front and back porch, making his house look magical in the ripe blue of dusk. Malfoy scoffed when he first saw them, muttering something snarky about “decorations in November” under his breath, but Harry just ignored him. It was getting both easier and harder to do that, now; easier in that Harry was getting used to his snarkiness, harder in that Harry was starting to involuntarily notice other things about him. Like, for example, the way his voice got smoother when he’d had two or more glasses of wine, or the way his thumb and his pinky finger stuck out when he put his hands in his trouser pockets, or the way his neck curved to meet the angled knot of his jaw. Harry also started paying more attention to the way his clothes were positioned on his body, how his white shirts were never wrinkled and his jumpers hung off his shoulders a bit, making him look all soft and round and strange.
On the far edge of the clearing was a house not unlike the one they were staying at, though it seemed a fair bit less run down. The paint wasn’t chipping and the roof wasn’t sloped in the center, and the backyard was well-manicured and fresh, looking much more healthy than the one across the property line. Draco wondered bitterly why theirs couldn’t look like that.
Hermione had nodded, and then they went out into the backyard without Harry and started walking through the rows of snow-covered apple trees, Ron’s hands in his pockets, Hermione’s gripping her elbows. Harry had watched them from the kitchen window, feeling something warm and relieved expand in his chest when they stopped in the middle of the orchard and embraced each other, Ron’s chin resting on top of her unbraided, frizzy hair, Hermione’s nose digging into his collarbone.
Potter returned from the hall carrying two hefty bottles of wine, both looking seldom touched and plentiful. “I’ve got daisy and elf-made,” he announced as he thunked them down in front of Draco. “No red though, sorry.”
Draco continued to stare, the tips of his ears turning red, and Harry wondered bitterly if the rest of the evening was going to be like this. If it was, he didn’t think he’d survive the whole thing; Luna and Neville would have to come and scrape his exploded remains off the walls.
don’t make me talk about the Ministry. In fact, let’s not talk about it at all tonight,” Hermione said feelingly. “I’m declaring tonight a no-Ministry night. Just forget it exists, please, for the sake of my emotional wellbeing.”
The tip of his wand lit up silver, and he slowly began to trace a small diamond shape against the dimpled brick, restoring the faded rune and making it pulse brighter than the rest. “There,” he said when the chant was finished and the diamond was whole, pulling his wand away. “That should’ve done it.”
“Obviously we’re not in school anymore,” Malfoy replied flatly. “Though I’m surprised you noticed, given how your observational skills have been somewhat lacking over the years.” He flicked his gaze up. “Also given the fact that you still look like you’ve been dragged by your ankles through a field of cacti. Is that how your hair naturally looks, or do you have a special routine that helps it defy gravity?”
, clearly not planning to go home anytime soon. Harry remembered mumbling something about how they could find extra blankets in the hallway closet if they needed, but he hadn’t stuck around to see if they actually stayed or not.
Harry sighed and let his head thunk against a branch. He couldn’t win here. “I’m not inviting them over, Luna, end of story. It would be a complete disaster.”
“Coming, Pans?” Theo asked with amusement as he twisted the silver handle and opened the back door, a gush of cold air spilling in behind him.
Happy to let Luna do her thing, Harry collapsed into one of the beige wicker rocking chairs and tucked into his own cup of tea, the rich steam curling white in the still blue daybreak. Despite the early sun blanketing the backyard with a warm, yellow sheen, the air was cold and damp, residual frost clinging to the wood railing of the porch. The faded metal bird feeders hanging from the cross beams creaked and swung faintly in the breeze.
“I don’t care!” Harry exploded, clomping up the wooden steps and holding tight to the railing so he wouldn’t do something rash, like hex Malfoy’s ears off. “I’m not playing games with you. If you couldn’t tell, we’re not in school anymore, and I’m not going to put up with your shit.”
The following week, Draco had appeared on the front step of a duplex building in Cornwall, and Pansy had answered the door. The first thing she’d done was hug him; the second thing was, “Salazar, Draco, what are you wearing?”
“Everything alright?” Neville asked from somewhere across the sanded plywood, voice light with amusement.
It wasn’t until he was halfway across the yard that Draco heard uneven, heavy breathing that wasn’t coming from him, and he looked back over his shoulder to find the grey and brown dog trotting at his heels, the branch still in its mouth.
Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one from the dynamite trio of Gryffindors danced with them. They all stayed rooted to the booth, laughing and chattering loudly over the pulsating music and bending their heads together. When Draco looked at them, he hated them a bit, but only because their magnetic closeness reminded him of school. Not because they’d done anything wrong. It was hard looking at them, though. It only reminded him of how horrible he used to be—how he used to hate the three of them with every burning fibre of his being. And not just pretend hatred; real, actual, blood-boiling hatred that made him sick to his stomach to think about.
“Places,” Draco confirms. “Quiet places. Places with no loud cars or taxis. Places where you can sleep.”
For the next two years, the four of them lived like nomads, travelling from city to city, house to house, never staying long enough to be recognised, never using magic. They worked at any and every place they could find, taking jobs as busboys and cashiers and grocers, scraping together their savings to pay their rent and keep their stomachs full.
Looking down at her, loose hairs fanned out around her face, her cheeks rosy and ripe with the glow of the morning, Harry couldn’t help but feel bad. “No,” he sighed, falling back next to her, knees knocking. “No, you don’t have to. But I really would like some more sleep—my day doesn’t start until seven at the earliest.”
“To be fair, we didn’t know who she belonged to,” he said, pretentious and sandy-haired as ever. He was looking at Harry with a flat, unreadable expression, but his tone sounded practiced and unnervingly polite. “Someone breached our wards this morning, and we figured that was a good enough reason to meet our neighbours. Your dog had little to do with it.”
He also didn’t look Harry in the eye once, even though Harry could feel his gaze almost the entire evening like a white-hot laser on his skin, silently searing into him.
It’s not that he was trying to notice those things—it just sort of happened. And then it kept happening, so much to the point where Harry just had to ask.
“Smart lad,” Theo said through a mouthful of his breakfast, gesturing approvingly across the kitchen counter with his spoon.
“They were there before we moved in,” a new voice replied. Gregory Goyle, big and lumbering as ever, shoulders curved like an inverted parenthesis.
He turned to find Goyle staring after him intently, stubby fingers as white as snow as they clutched the watering can. Harry was afraid he’d crush the thing if he gripped any tighter. “Sorry?”
“I hate that he can make me feel this way,” she’d said after the worst of the tremors had subsided, sounding defeated, leaning on Harry’s shoulder as the cold tiles bled through their clothes.
He’d spent the better part of the last two years cleaning up the orchard and restoring the house to its former glory, replacing the caving roof with new shingles, varnishing the hardwood floors, stripping down the peeling wallpaper, repainting the walls in earthy shades of green and yellow. When he showed it to Ron and Hermione after the place was finally furnished, they’d smiled and complimented him dutifully—but there was something else underneath their words. Something painful that Harry didn’t want to touch with a ten-foot pole.
He nodded. “I just… can’t get over the fact that I’m here right now. With you.” He glanced up, looking almost shy. “Draco from Hogwarts didn’t exactly picture himself ending up as Harry Potter’s date to Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley’s wedding.”
“See, I knew she’d be fine without us,” Luna said proudly from somewhere behind Harry, putting down her own stack of crates to pet Phoebe’s head lovingly.
Not sure what else to do, he brandished his wand and cast a rapid Patronus, instructing it to find Phoebe and keep an eye on her while they were away. It bobbed its silky, translucent head and pounded off into the Northern part of the orchard, and Harry watched it go, feeling dazed.
“Oh, I’ve noticed,” Draco said with a curt laugh. “She doesn’t keep it a secret. You know she hugged me the first time we saw her?”
“What do you think?” Pansy asked when Draco stepped through the arched entryway to the kitchen, knuckles white over the strap of his rucksack. There was dust on the dining table, dust on the countertops. Dust everywhere he looked.
“It’s a matter of dignity, not of the law,” Malfoy added, but Harry agreed with Neville. They weren’t making it easy.
A beat passes, and the faint sound of music from a nightclub down the street floats up through the floorboards. Fills the space.
he’d lent them over at all, but he didn’t really mind. Neville looked better in them than he did, anyway.
“Hey!” Draco protested, then stopped himself when he realised he had absolutely no qualms about his cherries being stolen. Taking his pause as an evident go-ahead, Potter grinned and popped the chemically-enhanced fruit into his mouth, teeth flashing white in the shifting low lighting. Draco snorted at him. “Those are artificial, you know.”
“Four years,” Pansy answered for him, tentatively wrapping one manicured hand around Luna’s outstretched forearm. “Give or take.”
Hermione’s smile stretched. “Yes, but I didn’t expect you to notice it. You’re not exactly the most observant person.”
Harry stared hard at the back of the other man’s head. “That’s just fucking rich coming from you, Malfoy. Do you even have a job, or is your daddy paying for all your expenses out of pocket?”
Malfoy bent over his shoulder again to eye the sequence critically, brow knit. “Hm,” he grunted noncommittally.
But Harry wasn’t worried. Together, he, Ron, and Hermione had been through worse. So much worse. He knew that no matter how secluded Harry’s life got, he would always have their backs, and they would always have his. That’s how they worked.
“Of course,” Luna echoed, soft and bemused. “I’m just saying—hypothetically, if you were attracted to him—it would be fine. Normal, even.”
“But how are we only finding out now?” Draco asked uncomfortably, shifting against the stiff wood of his dining chair. He would give at least a hundred Galleons for one of the high-backed chairs with squishy cushions and curved armrests that used to sit around the informal dining room in the Manor, charmed to mold perfectly to anyone who sat in them. But, alas, he didn’t have a hundred Galleons. “We’ve been here for nearly a whole week. Surely we would’ve noticed if we had magical neighbours.”
“What the fuck,” Theo agreed, hands on his hips, brown hair tangled in the early wind. He wasn’t properly dressed for the cold morning at all, clad in nothing but a pair of joggers and a dark blue dressing gown that was flapping around his calves.
“Potter,” Draco said with sharp frustration, prompting Harry to look up from the table and meet his scalding pewter gaze. “I’m serious. You make me crazy.”
“One minute,” she said, flapping her hand and bending down further to coo at the small litter of newborn chicks nestled inside the safety of the henhouse. They’d hatched just the other week, and already Harry could hear their chirps all the way from the porch, loud and chipper.
and get away from this place. This old, rickety, overgrown place with a young, shiny Malfoy standing in the middle of it all, his arms folded against the brisk chill.
“So, it’s settled,” Pansy jumped in suddenly, slapping one of her cards on top of Lovegood’s triumphantly. “We’re all coming.”
Neville snorted, pointing at the television with his fork, a piece of steamed broccoli hanging off it. “She’s going to burn it,” he declared as a woman with tight grey curls appeared to completely forget about her sponge cake baking in the oven as she started on a lemon zest icing.
But then Longbottom handed Draco a chock-full glass of wine, and Pansy leaned forward to ask, “So, what are you all doing nowadays?” and Draco knew he was stuck.
“Oh my god,” Harry said, head thunking against the mattress as he let it fall back. “I'm losing my mind.”
“Yes.” He dug his palms into the sockets of his eyes, seeing firecrackers bloom on the back of his eyelids. “It’s really Saturday? Already?”
“It does,” Theo said. “Dogs who live around wizards can pick up on magical footprints pretty easily. Maybe she’s just been doing some exploring, or something.”
Standing at the foot of the porch, amid the stalks of grass and the overgrown beds of swaying white wildflowers, was Draco Malfoy, bent slightly at the waist and petting Harry’s dog.
She was at the center of all of this, Harry thought. Without her, he and Draco may never have seen each other again. Their paths might have never crossed in the tangled, clumsy, mysterious way that they did. Without her, Draco would’ve been nothing but a bitter, faded memory lingering at the back of Harry’s mind.
“I realise that, and I’ve decided that I do not care because I absolutely refuse to be seen in public with you dressed like that. Put it on.”
That was the whole reason he was letting this happen in the first place: to make Luna happy. To give her something to look forward to, because apparently she needed something like that and Harry hadn’t even noticed until she told him.
“No,” Hermione said quickly, seeming to sense the panic in Harry’s voice. “No, nothing like that. There’s more nuance to it. I was thinking of it more like a magical parallelism—your life and Draco's life have been running alongside each other for years, but you’ve been separated by a vast gap of time and circumstance. Phoebe was acting as a bridge to that gap. Does that make sense?”
“She will,” Luna nodded, putting her feet up on the dash of the passenger’s seat. She was wearing socks today, thank Circe, ones with little multicoloured dinosaurs all over them. “She’s a clever dog. That’s odd, though, that she would be over there again. Do you think she’s found something interesting?”
—and then the next day you’re inviting us over for dinner every week. I don’t get it, and I’d like you to explain.”
“She’s only gone in the mornings?” Neville asked when Harry brought it up over dinner a few days and a few more disappearances later.
Draco opened his eyes again, surveying his dark bedroom, the rumpled duvet on his bed and the gently flickering oil lamp on his nightstand. “I don’t want my life to revolve around him anymore,” he said, nearly a whisper.
“Told you,” Draco said smugly, and all around them the evening buzzed with whispered promises of darkness, water turning amber as the sky sank slowly into its velvet cradle of night.
“We haven’t seen him,” Hermione cut in, sitting up on her elbows. “I did see Phoebe wander off in that direction a few minutes ago, though, and knowing her…” She trailed off, pointing past Harry’s shoulder to the northernmost part of the orchard, where the red streamers and string lights narrowed down into a path that veered off into the surrounding woodland.
“I—fine.” Malfoy then did the unthinkable, tugging off his thick, sage-green jumper and shoving it at Harry. “Put that on. I’m not leaving until you do.”
Theo stared at the note for a long, unblinking moment, then squinted. “That can’t be right. D’you think Potter drew the frog?”
Harry grinned wide and fond, despite knowing next to nothing about Greek mythology. “Hello, Circe,” he whispered to the smallest of the lot, bending over to stroke his pointer finger down its delicate back. It fluttered its wings and shook its head, chirping pleasantly. Harry’s heart nearly melted out of his chest right there. “What’s she the goddess of?” he asked.
“Fair enough. But—in my unprofessional opinion—I think your friends would have worried either way, even if they weren’t all in your face about it. Luna was certainly in mine.”
“Lame,” Theo grumbled from his place on the couch, then immediately lit up when he realised it was his turn. He slapped one of his last remaining cards down—a wild card, at that. “Aha! Uno, fuckers!”
“Where have you been?” Harry exclaimed when he saw her trotting towards them from the North corner of the orchard, brown tail wagging and pink tongue lolling out of her mouth. She answered his question by loping forward and shoving her head under his hand, eager for attention.
Harry’s eyebrows went up. “Hear that?” he asked Phoebe, scratching her head. “Luna thinks you can’t defend yourself. That’s awfully mean, isn’t it?”
It was odd, Harry thought, being a dog person. That’s what Ginny called him last time she’d visited, which had to have been—what, a year ago? Almost a year? He couldn’t remember. Point is, she’d called him a dog person, offhanded and casual, a small smile on her freckled face tinged pink with wine. It caught Harry off guard, and he’d thought to himself,
“You still have feet,” Harry assured, smiling. “Have either of you seen Draco anywhere? I lost track of him.”
It almost sounded like he was daring one of the Slytherins to say something snooty, either about his cooking or his lack of furniture. But Draco couldn’t blame him for the furniture thing, and linguine did sound quite good. If he wanted snooty, he wasn’t giving Draco much material to work off of.
Someone bumped into Theo, forcing him forward into Draco’s space and making their feet knock together. They were almost exactly the same height. “You heard me,” Theo said, pitching forward to speak directly into Draco’s ear. His breath was hot and damp and all too familiar. “You look good tonight. Like, unfairly good. I was hoping I could coax you into a round or so with me, for old times’ sake.”
When he reached the top of the stairs, he almost ran headfirst into someone—Gregory Goyle, in fact. Gregory Goyle wearing plaid pyjamas and holding a tin watering can that looked miniature in his huge hands. He froze when he saw Harry, eyes widening astronomically. “Uh,” he stalled, throat working, then held up his watering can. “Sorry, I’m—watering the plants.”
There was a gruff bark from behind Harry, and he twisted to see his dog standing at the bottom of the stairs, her tail wagging brightly at the appearance of Draco. When he looked back, Draco’s eyebrows had risen even higher, this time with amusement. “Well?”
Phoebe just sat back on her haunches and stretched, languid and unbothered. There was dirt on her paws again.
With a dull pang in his chest, Draco figured that’s how they’d refer to everything, now. Not horrible, not spectacular—just nice. Liveable; manageable.
“I’m already wearing a jumper under them!” Harry protested, holding his thermal-clad arms out. “And these are my
“You went to Azkaban,” Potter said, which was a sentence that shouldn’t have hurt Draco’s chest as much as it did. “Not for long, obviously, but you did—didn’t you?”
There was a collective groan, followed by a deep sigh from Potter as he folded Granger’s letter in his hands and stuffed it into his back pocket. Something strange and hot writhed in Draco's chest—something that made him want to get up and apologise to Potter—but he didn’t know what for.
“And you, Hermione,” Luna replied, smiling angelically while the neon-tinted lights played over her face. “How’s everything with you? How’s the Ministry?”
A loud honk sounded from the bottom of the hill, followed by a shouted, “Harry! We’re going to be late!” and Harry looked at his watch. It was ten until nine, and the market was fifteen minutes away. Shit.
It got better after that. In August, they moved to an old townhouse in Dublin after Theo had announced his cousin would be moving back into the house in Cornwall. “It was my aunt’s,” Greg explained as he’d pushed the door open and lugged their bags inside. “Haven’t seen her in ages, but she won’t mind us staying here.” That was true—they’d stayed in Dublin for nearly a year without hearing a peep from any of Greg’s family, immediate or extended. They didn’t hear from any of their families, really, least of all Draco’s.
“Oh my god,” Draco groaned, falling backwards onto Pansy’s bed. “I hate you so bloody much. I can’t believe you roped us into this.”
“We–” Draco had to swallow the lump in his throat, but it felt permanently stuck there. “We just came to—return the dog.”
“Not my problem,” Harry told her before trying to sneak another swipe at his drink, but Hermione pulled it even further out of his reach.
Silence. Then, “Incredibly.” There was a soft rustle, and suddenly Phoebe was laying her head restlessly across Draco’s lap, like she couldn’t possibly get close enough to him. Harry could sympathise with her on that front. Draco smiled at her and reached down to scratch between her ears. “I think your dog might be in love with me.”
“Right,” Harry jumped in suddenly, realising that this was going to be disastrous if he didn’t say anything. Drawing himself up, he stepped away so his back wasn’t facing the Slytherins and started again. “Right, um, sorry, I hope neither of you mind, but I sort of invited them along because your owl came when we were having dinner, so it seemed kind of rude not to—”
She frowned sympathetically. “Greg saved you some macaroni in case you get hungry later. He feels horrible.”
Theo was shamelessly close now, but this time it was obviously on purpose. His hand fell to the jut of Draco’s hip. “Here, bathroom, outside. I don’t care.” His head tilted, mouth suddenly brushing the shell of Draco’s ear. “Whatever you want. Only if you want.”
On Monday, he woke up to a world coated in white. The earliness of it was surprising; normally it didn’t start snowing until late December or early January, but Harry wasn’t complaining. The snow virtually immobilized the entire orchard, giving him yet another excuse to stay indoors and rattle around his house like a retired man in his seventies might. It was also the first day that Phoebe hadn’t left in the morning—instead she was snuggled up in the mound of blankets at the foot of Harry’s bed, exactly how she was supposed to be. Part of Harry felt inclined to send a quick note next door and tell the Slytherins not to worry about her absence, but then he remembered that making contact with them was the absolute last thing he wanted to do, so he didn’t.
“Will people be mad at us if they find out we spent the night together?” he asks offhandedly, reaching out to trace the dip of Draco’s temple.
Theo grimaced, shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand as he came to the bottom of the steps next to Draco. “I think someone tore the wards.”
“It looks cold,” Draco said drily, eyeing her up and down. It looked grand, actually, and if Draco was attracted to women, he figured he’d be drooling over her—but he was mad at Pansy, and he wasn’t exactly jumping to dish out compliments to her at the moment. “Why must you always dress like it’s summer in Morocco? It’s nearly December, you absolute nutter.”
For emotional compensation, he decided to bunker down in his living room and rewatch an array of his favorite films, only moving from the sofa for intermittent meals that weren’t really meals, just scraps of whatever he could find in his pantry. He watched
“Straight people,” Harry agrees. He drops his hand and blinks weighted eyes at the ceiling above, the weathered boards above their bed white-washed and sagging towards the middle. “I think she and Ron spent the night before their ceremony together, though. So we’re not that radical.”
“Oh my god,” Draco choked, stumbling to steady himself on the trunk of a nearby tree so he didn’t get a faceful of dirt.
?” Neville rolled his head back disbelievingly, wine glass dangling loosely from his fingers. “Merlin, save us all.”
Hermione shook her head. “Don’t apologise, you’re always welcome to pop into our fireplace. You should do so more often, really.”
There was an awkward pause, broken by the caw of what sounded like a hen, and then Theo piped up again. “Well,” he said, clearing his throat. “We’re glad we could help. With the dog.”
“Oh,” she said softly, then reached out to pluck it from him and take a large gulp. “Sorry, I forgot. Your chicks are distracting.”
He didn’t think of Draco. Or, rather, he didn’t purposefully think of Draco. Somehow Draco still ended up at the forefront of his brain, his name stuck to the roof of Harry’s mouth like warm honey.
Harry still didn’t know what was going on here. He did know that something had changed, though. Something significant, if not monumental. Something that had the potential to change the tides and sweep Harry down another channel.
“How considerate,” Draco said dully. Then, before Potter could snap something back, he added, “I guess—I don’t miss it because I still have it. Technically speaking, I mean. I can still feel it in my veins, so it’s not really
Draco stopped walking. “Merlin,” he said, peering down his nose at the dog. Its tail was perked high and mighty, its paws covered with spongy dirt from the wet, mulchy ground. “You can go on home, now. I have some business to attend to that, unfortunately, doesn’t involve any stick-throwing.”
“I... think that would just be a normal tree. Given that wands are made out of trees, and everything.”
But, still, regardless of the incident, Potter was acting weird; he was being clumsier than usual and spacing out at odd intervals. It was peculiar, and unsettling, and also incredibly endearing, which Draco just fucking hated. He didn’t understand how Potter could go around making the strangest things endearing, like wiping his mouth with the back of his sleeve or tracing little shapes in the condensation on his water glass. He ate like he was a small child, picking out all the carrots from the soup and putting them to the side of his plate until he’d finished the noodles and broth, and Draco couldn’t help but watch him the entire time with poorly-concealed interest.
While Luna dragged Neville outside to go meet the baby chicks, Harry pulled on his favorite cords and laced up his boots in anticipation of the long-ish walk to his car, parked at the bottom of the hill where the river split. He stared at himself in the mirror over his wardrobe, narrowing his eyes critically at the coils of hair that stuck out over his eyes and at the back of his head, then grabbed a yellow elastic to pull it all back away from his face. He could probably ask Luna to help cut it later.
“Meaning that there are wizards living next door?” Draco asked, tilting his head back to look up at Theo over his shoulder.
“Positive,” Harry had said again, frustrated this time. It wasn’t that far, anyway; only a single Floo stop or a ninety-minute drive in his dingy green Outback. He could visit London whenever he needed to. And it’s not like he needed to see Ron and Hermione every day to survive—he could do that on his own. Or, at least, he hoped he could.
“Thank you,” he said quietly to Lovegood, trying not to feel awkward as he slipped his coat off and sunk down into one of the armchairs. It sprang under him and molded to his lower back, like it was made exactly for him.
Hermione’s eyebrows cinched disbelievingly. “That doesn’t seem right at all. How would you even find him if it’s only one guy?”
“The dog!” Pansy said, swinging her feet off the table to get up and peer out through the square window of the back door. “If we’re going with Theo’s ‘hypothesis,’ then she probably belongs to the wizards next door.”
Legs feeling like jelly, he sunk down to the ground and sat roughly on the curb, all his weight lumped against the base of the lamp post. He couldn’t handle this. He was drunk, his stomach in knots. He needed to go home.
Harry’s stream of thought was cut off by Draco reaching for the door handle and gently pulling it open, sparing Harry from having to open it himself. A cool, wintery breeze spilled in from outside, sharpening the air and making Draco’s platinum hair whip around his face. “I’ll see you next Saturday?” he asked, turning slightly while keeping his hand firmly on the knob.
“I can leave if you’d like. I just woke up early today so figured I’d come meet you early, too.” She fell back on the bed, mattress bouncing again, and rolled her head to look at him. “Aren’t farmers supposed to wake up really early?”
“I, um.” Harry wobbled, and all at once his body decided that sinking back down onto the bed was the best thing to do in that moment. He loved Luna wholeheartedly, but it was far,
At one point, he’d accidentally gone three weeks without talking to anybody; he wasn’t depressed, he didn’t think, just caught up in other things. Caught up in himself. At the end of those three weeks, a knock much louder than Hermione’s or Ron’s sounded at the door, and he’d opened it to find Luna and Neville standing on the welcome mat.
“She agrees with me,” he informed Luna over his shoulder as she came back out holding Phoebe’s ceramic food dish filled with kibble.
“Your dog,” Goyle clarified, sounding somewhat shaky. “Luna—er, Lovegood said she was the goddess of something. Her name, I mean. It’s Phoebe, isn’t it?”
“You’ve heard it before?” Neville asked, surprised, and Harry swatted at him to sit down and put his seatbelt on. He was rotating the steering wheel and maneuvering them out onto the dirt road that would eventually lead into town, cutting through the valley and running alongside the white-capped river that weaved between the yellow fields and modest hills surrounding his property. There were a few other privately-owned farming estates in the area, but only one or two shared the road with Harry, so it was practically empty.
“Madam Malkin’s,” Harry interrupted again, and suddenly he was only one step down from Draco. Inches away. The closest they’d been in a long, long time. “We met at Madam Malkin’s. You don’t remember?”
“He’s—” The words felt sticky on Harry’s tongue, and all he managed to get out was the word, “Alley.”
“Anytime, mate,” Ron said through a loud yawn, wobbling a bit in place and forcing Hermione’s grip to tighten. “You would’ve found out either way. ‘M surprised Luna didn’t pick up on it.”
Harry looked down at Draco’s hands, like he was surprised they were there. “Oh,” he said faintly. “Right. I am. Do you mind?”
Harry was floored. Had he somehow wandered into his neighbour’s backyard? He knew there were other properties in the area—of course he knew that—but he’d never gone as far as to try and meet his neighbours. He’d been rather enjoying the whole “lonely hermit who only sees two people a week” shtick he had going on. But this was obviously someone else’s house on someone else’s property, and Harry knew he needed to get out of here before he got arrested for trespassing, or worse.
Unsure where to go from there, Draco wrapped his arms around his torso and leaned half his weight against the chipped banister post. “So,” he started.
Harry hadn’t even had time to greet them before Luna had barreled inside and gasped with delight. “Oh, Harry, it’s lovely here!” she’d exclaimed, twirling around the saffron-painted kitchen and running her hands along the sunken velvet armchairs in the living room.
“Jesus,” Harry said, rolling his eyes before hooking two fingers under Draco’s chin and planting a firm, silencing kiss on his stupid mouth. “You’re so lucky I put up with you.”
“Yes,” Draco replied, blinking and feeling deeply unsettled. He steadied himself by grabbing onto the bottom post of the porch railing. “What in Circe’s tits was that?”
“Looks like she came back just in time for lunch,” Luna said, reaching out and fondly mussing up the long fur on her back.
The front door was almost completely closed by the time Harry lurched across the room and stuck his hand in the frame, stopping Draco from shutting it all the way. “Wait,” he said quickly, breathlessly feeling his stomach dip as Draco looked and reattached to his gaze. “Sorry, I just—”
Draco’s stomach dipped. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he dismissed, but his tone was slipping out of his control. “There is no
“Oh!” Lovegood exclaimed happily. “How lovely. I haven’t seen her or Ron in ages. What’s the letter say?”
“Your dungarees are quite ugly,” she informed Harry apologetically. “Perhaps if you put a jumper over them?”
Then, on Christmas Eve, another faint knock had sounded at the door, and Harry opened it to find Ron standing on the porch looking unrested and pale.
“No, not yet.” Malfoy straightened up, shoulders rolling under his dark plum-colored jumper. “We need to see if it worked or not. Try Apparating.”
“Every day,” Potter said. His gaze flicked to Draco for a brief moment—so brief Draco might’ve imagined it.
“True,” Theo agreed, bobbing his head. “We’d probably be tried for the murder of a national treasure.”
He wasn’t depressed, or anything; he’d been depressed before and it hadn’t felt like this, not in the same way. He just felt—fragile. Tender, maybe. Like he was a bruise on the knee of a child who’d tripped at a playground. Who’d been knocked over by someone bigger, or stronger, or more careless.
“Disappointing,” Parkinson sighed, popping a piece of steamed squash into her mouth. “I didn’t even realise they had higher education for wizards, let alone things like herbology. It does sound fascinating, though, even without bells.”
She was half-leaning against the open door, one hand on the doorknob, the other wrapped around the frame; her hair was pinned back at the crown of her head with what seemed to be two coloured pencils, one blue and one yellow. A beige cardigan hung off her round shoulders and wrapped around her torso, unbuttoned at the top and tucked into the front of her skirt. She was certainly a sight for sore eyes—but she was also a sore sight for tired eyes.
Luna just giggled, and from there, the night pressed onward with a little less tension and a little more ease. Harry realised later on that the self-refilling bottle of daisy wine was also to blame for the significant shift in mood; nearly everyone was tipsy, except for maybe Goyle—Harry couldn’t tell what was going on with him, but he wasn’t causing any fights, and that was good enough.
Something sparked in Draco’s gaze, like maybe he’d been waiting to hear those words for a long time but never expected them to come. “Anytime,” he replied, nearly a murmur, and Harry didn’t register how close they were until he felt Draco’s breath on his nose and eyelashes. They were unusually close, actually, half separated by the door, faces mere inches apart.
“The fact that we can’t do magic is all the more reason to have them up.” Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. “Not to mention that I distinctly remember telling you that they were up before we arrived here.”
Draco moves so his head is tucked above Harry’s, encircling him so completely that he feels like he’s a hatchling being tucked under the wing of a bird. The lights from the city make patterns on the ceiling, and in the distance, the tires of a car screech.
He felt something nasty flare up inside him. “You waited an entire week to return my dog to my fucking property?” he snarled, whirling to glare at the first Slytherin his eyes landed on, which happened to be Malfoy, because really, who else would it be?
“I panicked!” Harry exclaimed, even though he felt the exact same way. He shouldn’t have left her there. He should have bucked up and done something, not Disapparate at the first sign of trouble. Still, feeling prickly and defensive of his dignity, he argued, “It’s Draco fucking Malfoy! I was a bit caught off guard, if you can’t tell.”
Draco put his forehead on his knees. “Right.” He lifted it again. “But I’m not trying to get into Potter’s pants, if that’s what you’re implying.”
“They’re here,” Luna answered loudly, pointing over Harry’s shoulder down the skinny marble-topped bar. “Over there, at the end.”
“Phoebe?” he called into the yard, squinting his eyes against the weather, but there was no response. He tried whistling after that, drawing further towards the center of the clearing, but it was no use.
“I was!” Harry exclaimed. “Until I saw bloody Malfoy playing fetch with my bloody dog on the bloody property next door.
“We broke up,” she’d said, voice cracking, and then Harry had enveloped her into his arms and stroked her hair, tight braids feeling course under his fingers.
He couldn’t say he wasn’t regretting it, but he also couldn’t say he wasn’t mildly enjoying himself. The Slytherins were odd but interesting company; Parkinson had been dominating the narrative all night, asking question after question about Neville’s education and Luna’s apprenticeship. She’d asked Harry a few questions as well, but he could tell she wasn’t exactly jumping out of her seat to talk to him. Neither were Nott, or Goyle, or Malfoy; Goyle had barely said a word since he walked in, only nodding along to the conversation and letting out slight grunts every once in a while. Nott chimed in a polite amount, each word clearly calculated to sound agreeable but not enthusiastic, like he was afraid of showing too much emotion. Malfoy, on the other hand—Harry didn’t really know what was up with Malfoy. He talked quite a bit, but only as a sidebar to Parkinson’s questions. He never prompted anything or brought up any new topics.
“I remember meeting your mother,” Malfoy said suddenly, softly, and Luna’s eyes flickered open, round and blue in the soft firelight.
Draco rummaged loudly through the drawer, pots and pans clanging together. “That’s none of your business.”
Phoebe barked in the distance, and it wasn’t the kind of bark she did when she was nervous, or angry, or protective; it was her friendly bark. The one that she only ever used around him.
He realised a second too late that he’d crossed the official property line, and a sudden, sharp fear gripped him. Surely Phoebe wouldn’t have gone this far without him? She’d never done anything like that before. She barely used to leave the bed without him persuading her with the promise of food.
“No.” Malfoy put his hand up. “No, they need to be fixed, and you’re the only other bloody wizard within a thirty-kilometer radius who can do that. I can help a bit with translating, but without magic I can’t—” He paused, frustrated. “Just—
Harry’s back straightened, fingers pulling the hems of his sleeves taut. “No, I do have something to say. I just—” He stopped, frustrated.
Draco froze, which was a near-impossible thing to do in the middle of a crowd of writhing bodies. “Wait, what?”
“I see her,” Draco said, feeling wild and terrified for what was about to transpire. He’d been joking earlier about hexes being flung, but now it didn’t seem so funny. Then, from behind Draco, the dog darted through his legs and began streaking towards Lovegood, ears flapping and tail swishing impossibly fast. He watched Lovegood’s face light up at the sight of the dog, bending her knees as it came barreling into her arms. She was distracted for a long moment, smiling and cooing something unintelligible to the excited animal, but then—as if it was inevitable—she raised her head and looked directly at Draco, gaze piercing and blue.
Harry followed him, trying to hold in another sneeze, but failing. There must have been a whole foot of dust coating the flagstone floor and the ancient-looking shelves, all of which were completely empty. There was a spiky metal thing on the opposite wall that Harry thought might be an old-timey furnace, but he wasn’t completely sure. He didn’t even know if wizard houses needed furnaces in the first place.
“Are you sure you want it?” the real estate wizard had asked, frowning as he looked up from his odd little clipboard. He’d shown Harry the property more out of obligation than anything else, since Harry’s only request was that he wanted to be “out of the way”, and Eastern Bedfordshire had seemed to fit that requirement quite nicely.
Draco had asked all those weeks ago when Harry had been standing in the same exact place, washing dishes over the sink, the lights around him dim and warm.
“Not an emergency,” Harry cut her off. “I’m so sorry for waking you, I just—I really need something.”
“Those aren’t washed, you know,” he pointed out, ducking his head under a thick branch so he could see her better.
Harry had been reluctant at first, thinking of Hermione’s shaking hands, but he couldn’t lie to Ron. Not like that. “Yes.”
“Come on,” Potter persisted. “It’s not like the Ministry will be able to trace it or anything—you haven’t won it from me, so it’s technically still mine.”
“Liar,” Harry said, leaning against Draco’s shoulder heavily. “Let’s not talk about him right now, yeah? I’m enjoying myself.”
Then, Potter did the unimaginable; he backed down. “Alright,” he said, raising his palms in surrender. “Fine. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to. I’m not trying to pressure you, I just thought you might want to try.”
So, left without much of a choice, Harry did the only thing he could think of. He pulled on his coat and pushed outside into the nebulous night, headed straight for the tangled greenery of the North corner, thinking only of Draco, Draco, Draco. Thinking of his hair and his hands and his voice, of the way he’d said Harry’s name hours earlier. The way the syllables had fallen from his lips so easily, as if they’d been there on the tip of his tongue forever. As if he’d been waiting to say them forever.
Harry laughed faintly, then turned to pick the apple hanging red and glossy right in front of his nose as Luna started off towards the next tree. It was true, he supposed. A little dirt had certainly never hurt him.
“Hm,” Theo hummed blearily, turning the note over in his hands. “Well, it’s a nice addition. I need coffee to process this.”
She didn’t elaborate, leaving Harry to contemplate that nugget of wisdom on his own. He sort of understood, to an extent—he loved the song, too.
“Soon,” Pansy answered, sliding one of her feet in between Draco’s in what he assumed was a comforting gesture. “Are you feeling better?”
Harry brings their clasped hands up and presses his mouth to them. “What else?” he asks, barely a whisper.
Taking a deep, meditative breath, Draco turned away from the clearing and began heading down the beaten path that led to the ravine situated a few minutes away from the house, where Pansy liked to have a swim on occasion. She was insane for doing so in the dead middle of October at seven in the morning, but every time Draco bugged her about it, she claimed that she ran “warm-blooded” like the rest of her family. He never bothered pointing out that every human being on Earth ran warm-blooded.
“Ah,” Harry said, now understanding why he was up so early; the couch was only comfortable to sleep on for a maximum of three to four hours. Anything beyond that would end in a serious muscle cramp or a bitch of a sore neck. “No problem. Save some of that tart for me, yeah? I shouldn’t be gone long.”
Harry felt a smile tugging at his lips as he watched them. He wasn’t sure if he decided to love them, or if he decided to love Ron and Hermione, or Ginny. It wasn’t a decision, he didn’t think. Not a conscious one. But, theoretically, if it
Draco’s grip tightened, feeling a small pulse of energy pump through his fingers and up his arm. “But it belongs to you,” he said quietly, the words feeling null on his tongue.
“Her brain is literally the size of a walnut.” Pansy flicked a wet piece of hair out of her face, then sighed at Draco’s offended scowl. “What if we called her something gender-neutral, like Avery or Emerson or something, not she’ll really mind that much. Given that she’s a dog and all.”
“And even if she isn’t your familiar, you do have a way with animals,” Ron jumped in, and Harry couldn’t help but feel disconcerted with the fact that he and Hermione had clearly discussed this topic between themselves before. “You form bonds with them that are, like, unbreakable. Hedwig and Buckbeak could’ve easily been your familiars, too.”
From his bed, Potter’s dog lifted her head and let loose a huge yawn before settling back down, digging her long nose into Draco’s comforter. “You’re ridiculous,” he told her, receiving nothing but a small sniff in his direction.
“No,” he said again, backing into the entryway and wrapping his hand around the ridged frame to keep himself from falling over. “Get out.”
“She’s always been a weird one,” Ron agreed, now leaning half his weight against Hermione’s shoulder, gaze unfocused. He had a reddish pillow crease cutting along one cheek, disrupting his splash of freckles.
“Do they even have cabs all the way out here?” she asked while doing so, raising her eyebrows at Harry.
“Serious question.” Harry squinted at his reflection, then swiped a hand through his fringe to push it out of his eyes. He paused, then backtracked. “I mean—not attractive as in you’re attracted
But there was nothing there except swaying linen and rustling trees; the same ones that had been standing there since Draco had moved in almost a week ago.
Harry reached up and scrubbed his hands down his face, still trying to process what time it was. He tried focusing on her question, but he felt a few steps behind; like he was a computer, lagging and buffering. His brain felt like it was nothing but a little spinning rainbow circle, going round and round, stuck in a loop.  “I—Luna, they weren’t open last time because they were sleeping.”
while thinking of Luna, then closed it again after reading the words, “Go on with what your heart tells you, or you will lose all.”
“Is Phoebe coming?” Luna asked from her place in the passenger’s seat, twisting to look through the rolled-down window.
“Have you made sponge cake before?” Luna asked him, twisting on her back to look at him upside down.
“Don’t insult her, Harry,” Luna chirped through the screen door. “You know she can’t defend herself.”
Draco stared at him incredulously. “You really want to traipse all the way next door just to have an awkward conversation with people who
“I have no idea,” Harry said. Neville’s appearances at the house were a lot more sporadic than Luna’s, who came at least every Saturday, sometimes staying the night. Neville just tended to show up whenever he felt like it. Not that Harry minded; he was a huge help with the orchard and the gardens, always teaching Harry a new trick that would help his squash grow faster or his apples stay ripe longer. Harry picked up Luna’s mug and swished the now-lukewarm liquid around. “You still want this?”
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He supposed Malfoy hadn’t been too horrible as of late, but he couldn’t be sure—spending so much time with the git could’ve warped Harry’s brain and made him think that Malfoy was being normal when he was actually just being a dick. Harry couldn’t trust his own judgment anymore. “I don’t know,” he settled with, slumping down on the end of his bed and nearly startling his half-asleep dog. “I don’t know why I’m asking, really.”
“Mate.” Harry felt himself grin like a madman, meeting Ron in the middle of the vibrating room and throwing an arm around him despite the fact that he was at least a foot taller. “Have you gotten bigger since I last saw you?”
Draco did, shifting himself under her arm so it draped around his shoulders. He put his head on her shoulder, and she rubbed his arm soothingly up and down, rhythmic and predictable, how he liked it.
“Then these ones deserve to be goddesses, too.” Luna smiled, reaching out to stroke one of the tiny chicks on its tiny head. “This one seems like a Hecate, don’t you think?”
“Okay,” says Draco. Harry can’t get enough of the tenor of his voice, the tangle of his accent so early in the morning. “It’s in the countryside. Scotland, maybe, or Ireland if you’d prefer. There are willow trees in the front yard and a long driveway that goes uphill, far away from the main road.”
Parkinson—who Harry couldn’t actually tell was drunk or not—simply quirked her eyebrow at him. “Concerned for my safety, Weasley?”
“Hello there,” she said, raising her voice, since she was all the way across the clearing, all the while remaining completely, eerily calm. “I assume you’re the neighbours?”
The porcelain light of the moon is obscured by a wispy onslaught of clouds, half-hearted and lethargic in their crawl across the leaden sky. Taillights of fatigued taxis reflect shifting red and white shapes on the window panes.
Softly, Draco said, “I’ll be down in a moment,” even though he knew that the minute he stepped onto his back porch, there was no turning back.
The first month had been the hardest; Draco felt empty and exhausted during the day, but couldn’t fall asleep at night no matter how hard he tried. He could feel his magic running like liquid fire through his veins, begging to be used, burning up his insides—but he refused. They’d ended up spending the whole summer in Cornwall, roaming the oddly constructed neighbourhoods and taking walks down long, tourist-infested strips of beach, trying to ignore the humming of their bones. It was the first summer Draco had ever got sunburned.
“You look like shit,” was the first thing Draco said when the door opened, his brows peaked high on his forehead. He didn’t look much different than he had a week ago, dressed casually in a black jumper and trousers that were creased sharply down the front. His skin was still pale and his hair was still neat and parted down the middle, crisscrossing in front of his eyes.
The kettle began to sing its high-pitched song, and he turned his attention to it and started fixing two generous cups of tea, adding a load of milk to his own while leaving Luna’s untouched because, somehow, she could stomach it plain. Mugs in hand—one dotted with little hand-painted daisies, the other shaped like a curling head of cabbage—he bumped the screen door open with his hip and came out onto the porch, calling for Luna to come and get hers.
Draco decided halfway through dinner while sitting through a suffocating bout of silence, Potter refusing to meet his gaze across the way as he poked quietly at his meal. Potter probably didn’t even remember the alley incident—he’d been more drunk than Draco was, after all.
Eager to change the subject and stop thinking about the hurricane of a man that was currently sitting on their back steps, Draco shifted on the couch and asked, “What are we watching?”
Harry wasn’t sure what exactly constituted “progress”, but he trusted her, and part of him soared when he heard her say the word “proud”. It made him feel whole, and human. It made him feel real. When Harry told Eva this, her smile had wavered.
Confused and a little shocked, Harry stopped in the shade of a curving tree and drew close to it, unsure if he was trespassing on private property or not. The place looked abandoned at first glance, but when he squinted, he could see a thin clothesline swaying in the breeze, weighted with white linen sheets and patterned towels. He could also see a meekly gurgling fountain shaped like a mermaid not far beyond, nestled among tall patches of yellow-ish grass. Scattered pots of herbs and tomato vines dotted the yard, creating a short, wide path up to the back porch, one that looked nearly identical to Harry’s, furniture and everything.
“More exciting that way!” she called back, and Draco sighed inwardly. If she caught a cold, that was entirely her problem.
And part of him did know it. He did understand that what he and Draco had ran deeper than anything he could have imagined. That they had roots in places that were impossible to see from the surface. Roots that somehow found their way into Harry’s chest, weaving through his ribs and around his heart.
“No,” Luna replied to Neville cheerfully, swaying her head to the sunny rhythm undulating from the radio and cracking her window open so the smell of the wind and the countryside bled into the car.
“You—” Harry blinked again, harder, re-disoriented. Jesus, what a morning. “Luna,” he restarted, trying his absolute best to sound polite. “You—not that you’re not welcome, or anything, but why are you here? At six in the bloody morning?”
“Why haven’t we been staying here forever?” he’d asked Pansy as he stood in the backyard the first day they moved in, enveloped by swathes of green and yellow, the smell of damp grass and rosemary drifting idly with the breeze.
“It worked,” he declared, opening his eyes to find Malfoy staring at him with hawk-like intensity. It was a bit startling—so much so that Harry accidentally noticed that Malfoy’s eyes were the same silvery color as the runes.
Draco scowled as he shucked his jacket off, flinging it over the back of the floral-patterned couch before collapsing onto it. “He’s come to terrorise us.”
Harry, who was in the middle of grabbing a short stack of bowls from the mahogany hutch in the hallway, called back exasperatedly, “You have to use magic."
a few times, huddled under a knit blanket with his fingers wrapped around a scalding hot mug of cocoa—the cabbage mug, to be exact—and cried a bit at the airport scene like he always did. Then he rewound it and cried a little more the second time.
“A dinner party! It could be fun. I’d love to catch up with them. Neville might be a bit hesitant, but I’m sure I could convince him.”
Luna bobbed her head in agreement while Harry looked at Phoebe anxiously, her chin resting on Neville’s ankle, dozing lightly.
“It’s been sitting in a box in the back of my wardrobe,” Potter told him after handing it over, their fingers brushing as the smooth, dark wood touched Draco’s skin for the first time in half a decade. Ten inches of hawthorn and a unicorn hair core; reasonably springy, supple enough to bend. Heavy in his palms. “I meant to return it, but there was never a right time.”
“No,” he said. “I can’t do this today. Sorry for breaking your wards, but I’d really like you to leave. You’re not welcome here.”
“I believe my house had a motto,” Luna spoke up thoughtfully. “I remember it was in French, but I don’t speak French. Do you speak French, Draco?”
“I just want to give them a chance,” she’d insisted, her round, lovely eyes pleading and blue, and Harry couldn’t say no to her. He wasn’t heartless.
“Jesus,” Harry said, reaching out to take her hand and run his thumb over the raised jewel. It was a deep amber color, not too flashy, but certainly not small. “How did I miss this? Have you been wearing it all evening?”
A short, silent beat passed, like everyone in the room but Luna had inhaled sharply at the mention of Narcissa Malfoy. “She… does,” Malfoy answered slowly, fingers curling over his armrests as if he was bracing himself for something.
“You’re welcome,” Harry replied slowly, and then Goyle turned away and continued to water his dying tulips with his empty watering can. Harry thought that could be symbolic of something, but he wasn’t sure what.
Harry’s smile stretched, the little corner parts of his eyes creasing delicately, like silk, and his other hand came up to cradle the side of Draco’s head. “I think so, too.”
“Everything alright?” Harry asked, lowering himself down next to Draco and crossing his legs. “I lost you back there.”
Harry exchanged a look with Luna; she met it apologetically, her brow creased and creating a small dip down the center of her forehead. “Yeah,” Harry responded slowly, leveling his gaze back on Malfoy’s bowed head. “We didn’t either.”
Draco didn’t know what to do with that, so he decided to focus on the least potentially explosive topic in that sentence. “Phoebe?” he asked, cursing himself for sounding so meek.
Draco didn’t understand how they’d gotten here. “It won’t work,” he said again, but his tone was faltering. Potter’s eyes on him were earnest and insistent and so bloody green that Draco wanted to reach over and slide his eyelids shut. They were too much; too intense.
Sure enough, a young woman with long, coiling blonde hair and a floor-length cardigan was standing on the steps of the porch, looking very much like a matured version of Luna Lovegood, one hand shading the slanted afternoon sun from her eyes as she peered in their direction.
home, unpainted and unfurnished as it may be, but home nonetheless—and he learned how to live for himself.
Neville rounded the table, and Harry noticed for the first time that morning that he was still in pyjamas, wearing one of Harry’s pairs of heather grey joggers. Harry didn’t know when exactly he’d lent those over, or
she was going, but he let her go anyway. It’s not like the Slytherins were harming her in any way, and no matter the conditions she always came back.
“Hm.” Potter’s brow was now furrowed thoughtfully, pinched in the middle and creasing the tan, soft-looking skin between his eyes. Draco wanted to smooth it down with his thumb. “I still don’t understand that. It’s not like you have the Trace on you or anything, right?”
“What?” He looked back. There was fear on Malfoy’s face again; tired, timeworn fear. “How do you have wards, then?”
Hermione set her purse down, falling quiet for a long moment. Harry glanced at her, then back at the bar where everyone else was still crowded. Everyone except—well. He looked back at the pavement and pinned his gaze on a small chunk of loose asphalt near his shoe.
There was a long, cumbersome beat of silence, broken only by the slosh of wine Longbottom began pouring into an array of empty glasses. It was awkward. Incredibly, painfully awkward, so much so that Draco wanted his seat to open up under him and engulf him into a black hole—one that took him far, far away from this living room.
“And risk breaking our wards again? Thank you for the offer, but I’ll pass.” Draco heaved himself off the sofa, wobbling a bit when he was fully upright. “I can walk. See?” He took two steps forward, lurching a bit and not really proving his point.
Theo’s mouth pressed into a thin line, and he nodded curtly before turning away to start circling the perimeter of the clearing. Draco had no idea how he was going to figure out where the wards broke without a wand in hand, but it was true—he did trust Theo. He trusted Theo with his life.
Malfoy’s face darkened, and he rolled his shoulders back so his chest puffed up. “Not in the ways that matter to you, apparently.”
Pansy’s hand stilled, then she put two fingers under his chin and lifted it so their gazes met, serious and shadowed. “Then don’t let it.”
“Yeah, well,” Harry mumbled to his knees, wondering distractedly how she always managed to figure him out so easily. “I don’t understand it either.”
“Small. Definitely small,” Draco answers. He turns his hands so he can lace his fingers through Harry’s. “But there are two floors. The first one has a kitchen with green cupboards, and a living room with a couch and a few armchairs for when the Weasleys visit. The second floor has a bedroom with tall windows and an en suite. With a bath.”
“What for?” Pansy asked disbelievingly, face lit up with a mix of delight and enmity, like she couldn’t decide which one was more fitting.
Draco’s throat tightened. He didn’t want to answer that, feeling suddenly and uncomfortably transparent.
The tent and folding tables were also shoved into the boot of Harry’s car, able to fit all squashed together with the subtle help of an expansion spell. The car was old and beat-up, and there were always new dents on the hubcaps that Harry didn’t remember getting, but he loved it regardless. On the back, there was a whole army of bumper stickers that Ginny had given him for his birthday one year, saying things like
“Draco,” Harry said, so soft he almost missed it, “I want you to know that I’m about to do something tremendously stupid. Maybe the stupidest thing I’ve ever done.”
Luna laughed and patted him again, this time on the forehead. Her fingers were cold and smooth to the touch. “Go to sleep, Harry.”
“No, not yet,” he said, peeking into the open hatch. Inside, a small puddle of soft, yellow tufts wiggled around, their tiny needle-like beaks poking skyward. There were four of them, two mottled with specks of brown, the others with white highlights running down their backs. “Do you have any in mind?”
Like the house, Harry had accidentally fallen in love with Eva, too. But when he’d asked her out for a drink after their final session together, him standing in the doorway of her clean office, she’d just smiled sadly and shook her head. “It was a pleasure working with you, Harry. I truly wish you the best.”
“Are you going to let me in?” Draco asked tiredly, letting his head roll forward, hair falling into his eyes and making Harry’s heart skip.
“Mm,” Draco hummed, playing along. “I think I’ve gotten quite used to it, but thank you for the concern.”
Pansy poked his foot with her own. “You need to eat something. I’m not going to let you get bad again over this stupid thing.”
enough to make him forget about the headache pounding at his temples, but not quite. He’d woken up feeling like a balloon full of hot air had inflated at the base of his cranium, uncomfortably pressing everything against the front of his skull and making his head throb. It had been a long time since he’d woken up with a hangover, but the moment he’d opened his eyes he could tell this one was going to be the worst.
“As far as I know, yeah,” Harry confirmed through a mouthful of pomegranate and feta salad, plate balanced on his knees. He was sitting in his favorite velvet armchair, Luna on the couch, Neville in front of the fire. They always had to have a fire.
“But they don’t have magic,” Luna pointed out, then tilted her head thoughtfully. “Though I’m not sure if not being able to perform magic would get rid of their individual magical signatures. I’ll have to look into that.”
Malfoy shrugged, unfazed. “Fine. She can stay here. Pansy’s been feeding her bits of scrambled egg all morning, so I’m sure she won’t mind staying.”
“What?” Harry’s eyes were wide, and he was slowly pulling away now, which was not Draco’s intention at all. “I can take it off, if it’s bothering you.”
“Right, yes. But how did she convince him to invite us over? He was about ready to chop your head off the other day.”
“Did you find them?” she asked lightly, hopping up onto the curb and holding her arms wide for balance. “They weren’t in the park. A man did offer me a good deal on some weed, but I don’t have cash on me.”
As he was turning back to continue staring probingly out the window, something small and round pinged sharply off the glass. He startled, jerking backwards so his back hit the bedpost, startling the dog as well and making her head lurch up. The noise came again a moment later, so Draco approached the window and looked down to see Potter staring intently up at him, a collection of small, dime-sized pebbles clenched in his hand.
“Draco,” she said again, harsher this time, lifting her chin. “You’re as much my responsibility as I am yours. We look out for each other, don’t we?”
“No,” came Draco’s soft answer, muffled by the thin strip of wall that separated them. “Not tonight. I’ll see you tomorrow morning, daft animal.”
Draco leaned his head back against the glass. “If I ate anything I think it’d just come right back up. I wouldn’t want Greg’s macaroni to end up in the toilet.”
Potter tussled with the owl for a moment, nudging its spindly leg up so he could untie the thin parcel twined to its foot. He stroked its head to calm it back down while he tore the envelope open with his teeth, a movement that Draco absolutely did not stare at, thank you very much.
Greg was standing by a large bay window positioned over the sink, backlit by grey sunlight and casting a long, stretched shadow across the eggshell-coloured tiles. Tiles that probably used to be white, once upon a time. “Backyard’s nice,” he observed, leaning forward, hands clasped behind his back.
Harry’s brain supplied as he saw Phoebe triumphantly recover the branch and begin her bounding journey back towards the house, looking happier than Harry had ever seen her, and then he immediately repealed that statement and began to burn it with a mental torch in his brain. No, Malfoy was
“They’re your neighbours, Harry. Aren’t you even the slightest bit curious as to why they’re out here together?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked. “She’s been ‘assisting’ me by wandering into the Slytherins’ yard for the past three months?”
When they’d come back, Hermione told Harry that they were “going to try again,” and there had been tears shining bright and glossy in Ron’s eyes. Then Hermione hugged Harry and told him how grateful she was to have him, and that she missed seeing him, and Harry had agreed profusely, and they all promised to talk to each other more. To stay in each other’s lives.
“Brilliant. Thanks ever so for the invitation.” A Cheshire-esque grin quickly overtook her face. Then, completely changing the subject, she turned back to the game and said forcefully, “Draco, hurry up, it’s your turn.”
“Yeah, well you make me crazy, too,” Harry conceded dryly. “There’s something we can agree on.” He didn’t bother specifying what
“I’m done with this one,” she said to Harry after a while, breaking the soft tune and climbing back down her ladder, basket already half-full. Harry shot her a thumbs up, then watched as she picked up one of the apples from her basket and bit into it thoughtfully.
There was a sharp intake of breath, and Malfoy’s face hardened like marble. “No,” he replied, low, through his teeth. “Unfortunately, it’s only the four of us including Pansy, not that a reunion wouldn’t be an absolute treat. Perhaps you should arrange one? I’m sure McGonagall would be pleased to host.”
Draco gave up on battling the dog away from the windowsill in favor of glowering down at him. “Don’t you have better things to be doing with your day? Cows to milk or sheep to herd, perhaps?”
“No, we didn’t have a motto,” Nott assured, stretching his leg out and kicking Malfoy in the shin with light reprimand. “He’s making that up. And rest assured, if we did have a motto, it would be far better than
“He’s right,” Greg had spoken up suddenly. “They can’t help us right now. Even if we did manage to find someone who was the least bit willing to file a report for us, it would have to pass through a hundred different levels of verification until someone actually did something. There’s no point.”
“I—fine, alright.” Teeth grinding, Harry clenched his wand in his hand and focused on the first location that popped into his head. For some reason, that happened to be the little curved bridge over the stream that ran through his side of the property, the one that was potentially tall enough to row a gondola under—but nothing happened. An invisible force blocked Harry’s attempt to squeeze through space, a force that he remembered tearing through the last time around.
Pansy giggled, swiping her feet out of the way of his attack, then nudged at him to budge over. “Come here, you big oaf.” She scooted around on the bench so she was next to him instead of across, lifting her arm. “Come here.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, smiling softly to himself. “She can be like that. She likes you, though. All of you.”
“You’re making it very hard for us to believe you haven’t done anything illegal,” Neville said lightly.
“Harry,” Hermione had said with the same exact frown the real estate wizard had. “You’ll be so far away from London. Are you absolutely sure?”
“Of course you did,” Harry said, rolling his eyes and running his hands down her head to ruffle the part below her neck. She was a purebred Shetland sheepdog with long legs and light, fluffy fur that stuck out around her ears and down her back, colored grey and brown with specks of white splattered across her stomach. She wasn’t young, but she certainly wasn’t old, and Harry had owned her for about the same amount of time that he’d owned the house. “Daft dog. Are you hungry?”
The Ministry had declared that they could provide housing to him for two months while he searched for a job and got back on his feet. “Housing” was a generous term, though; for those two months they’d stuck Draco in a room the size of a broom cupboard, with one window and one bed that was so frail it could barely support his weight. He’d still taken it— he didn’t exactly have any other options.
“We’re on the run from the Ministry,” he said, staring fixedly at Harry with the same steeliness he’d had the other day. Everyone in the room seemed to shrink with those words, leaving only Harry and Malfoy to mow each other down with iron-forged gazes.
Malfoy held the door for them, throwing one last brackish sneer at Harry before letting it fall closed behind him, effectively shutting out the cold morning. Suddenly, the room felt big again.
“I would hope so,” Pansy said feelingly, coming to plop next to Draco on the sofa. “How long do you think he’ll stay out there?”
Harry couldn’t help but smile to himself as he flicked the faucet on, rinsing out the jars and letting the cool bite of the tap water on his skin stir him from his half-blurred state. He felt bleary and lightheaded, like he had one foot stuck inside a dream—a dream where Draco Malfoy made him soup and babbled to his dog and refused to use magic. There was no way that was real life.
“Harry,” Luna repeated, and he couldn’t even begin to understand why she sounded so peaceful, so meditative, when there were three fucking Slytherins sitting at Harry’s kitchen table—specifically, one Draco Malfoy sitting at Harry’s kitchen table. One Draco Malfoy who was staring at him with eyes so wide they looked on the verge of popping right out and bouncing on Harry’s floor like ping pong balls.
Harry snorted and leaned back against the wood banister, letting his head tip up and soak in the streaks of sunlight permeating the cloud cover, keeping his hand lightly on Phoebe’s back. Out of his peripheral vision he could see the North corner, lush and bedraggled, needing desperately to be tidied up.
“No, no we are not,” Parkinson cut in swiftly. “In fact, let’s never do it again. I’d much prefer it that way, thank you.”
All at once, his knees felt wobbly and made of rubber and wood, like he was a puppet being held up by a set of thin plastic strings, ready to break at the slightest wrong move. His heart beat in his ears as glimpses of orange, angry fire flashed before his eyes; he saw pictures of crumbling stairways, of flooded bathrooms, of blood-stained fabric, of scorched rubble, of overturned tables, of green curses. Of King’s Cross Station, white and nebulous.
Draco, who hadn’t really looked away from him the entire dinner, frowned across the table and set down his spoon with a
Malfoy squinted and bent closer, standing almost directly behind Harry. The smell of sage was overly pungent, like a thick, invisible cloud enveloping around Harry. “I don’t know what the last symbol is,” he started, “but I assume the first part says something ominous like
He’d been out of Azkaban for a year; his parole had just expired, he’d just been given a wand by the Ministry, the Manor had just been seized. His mother had just been admitted to the Janus Thickey Ward at St. Mungo’s for suffering frequent, intense panic attacks. His father had been on his second year out of fifteen in Azkaban.
“Whatever,” Pansy said, dismissing Draco with another wave of her hand. “I’m calling her Emerson and there’s nothing you can do about it.”
“Very weird,” Luna agreed. “Do you think she’s found some sort of undomesticated colony of pack dogs somewhere in the woods? That would be
“Not today,” Draco echoed quietly, gaze fixed on the water below their dangling feet. It was moving slowly, quietly, like it had all the time in the world to get where it needed to go. Around it the trees quivered, wayward branches swaying to the steady rhythm of the stream.
“I know so.” Theo had nodded. “It’s the only explanation—this is the third place I’ve moved, and they’ve managed to find me every time. Magical Law Enforcement are the only people who know my whereabouts, so it’s got to be them.”
Something conflicted flashed across Potter’s face, like he couldn’t decide if he should be triumphant for being right or concerned by Draco’s tone. “I had a life before moving out here,” he started, dropping his tone. “That was one of the first things they taught us in Auror training—that once a convict is released they don’t really get all their rights back. The wand thing is for public—”
“He’s being nice,” Parkinson cut him off suddenly, putting a hand up to stop him. “We invited ourselves because we haven’t gone to a pub in about half a year and he was too nice to tell us no.” She stuck her hand out amicably. “Nice to see you two again. Been almost five years, hasn’t it?”
“Goodnight, Harry,” Draco said as he stepped back from the door, even though they’d already done that part. The hard part.
And he did. He took the rest of the weekend off, slipping into his favorite pair of slouchy joggers and making a nest of blankets on his sofa where he could burrow for hours at a time. It felt strange not to work on pruning the orchard or re-fertilising the soil in the herb garden, but the idea of doing either of those things was daunting even despite the strangeness.
happen—Lovegood broke into a soft smile and stepped forward, arms coming around Draco’s shoulders, and Draco felt every single one of his muscles freeze at the same time.
“Something like that,” Hermione confirmed. “Again, it’s only a theory, but familiars do everything for a reason, and the patterns you described to me just seemed a bit too on-the-nose to be coincidental. We think it’s possible that you and Draco have some sort of… magical link that only she could sense.”
“It’s fine.” Harry lifted their clasped hand and pressed his lips to the back of Draco’s. “Don’t apologise.”
“What—” Potter began to ask, but was cut off by the noisy arrival of Theo holding a clinking platter of more drinks, as if they needed more to begin with.
Harry’s eyes flicked back to Draco’s, and then their eye contact was so intense that Draco almost wished he’d look away again and make it stop.
“Sure,” Neville said, catching the lanyard of keys Harry tossed his way before he turned and half-jogged back up the hill, eyes peeled for his troublesome pet.
“Oh, he does. He thinks we’re the scum of the Earth, as far as I know,” Draco said, nodding. “I have a feeling that Lovegood is behind it. She was oddly nice to me when we—” He paused. “Well, you know.”
“Nice of them, isn’t it?” Luna said peaceably as Harry steadied himself on the door frame and caught Phoebe half in his arms. “Draco was just telling me how they moved in next door about a week ago. Phoebe’s been wandering off to their backyard every morning since they got here.”
every other day and he needed to keep the stream of reporters at bay. Those had been much more complicated runes, but there had also been plenty of damage Harry hadn’t risked touching.
“It’s for your own good,” Hermione assured, smiling apologetically as Harry rolled his head back into place and gave her a deflated look. “Are you sure you’re alright with us staying over tonight? If you don’t have room—”
Draco was bent over the stove when Harry finally ventured into the kitchen, setting the bowls down on the counter and trying not to snicker as Draco unsuccessfully tried to twist the burner knobs on. His mouth was set into a frustrated scowl, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows and exposing a faint bruise of color on his forearm. Harry averted his eyes and pulled his wand from his waistband, pointing it at the stove.
She nodded emphatically, holding the towel close. “Yes, please. I’d rather not be standing around freezing my tits off when this potential kidnapper shows up.”
Draco sighed. “I suppose you can help me sniff Pansy out in case she’s been kidnapped.” A beat. “You don’t think she’s been kidnapped, do you?”
“No.” She smiled all catlike and sly, then tilted her head to peer through Draco’s legs. “That bloody dog’s back again?”
Draco returned the grin, lifting his arm to poke Theo lightly in the forehead, right between his eyebrows. “You’re sweating like a broken faucet.”
“Are you saying—Draco Malfoy lives next door? Is that—is that what you’re saying?” Neville stumbled over his words, sounding flabbergasted.
“You didn’t know?” Malfoy asked incredulously, sitting up in Harry’s favorite armchair. “How in Salazar’s name did you not know? My parents talked my ear off about university every chance they could. They were quite set on me studying economics at Oglidreth after graduating from Hogwarts.”
“What sort of dignity?” he prodded, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. Malfoy looked at him sourly, shifting in his seat, and Harry felt a strange tingle of triumph in knowing that he was uncomfortable sitting in Harry’s favorite chair.
“He has, actually. His ego, particularly,” Hermione piped up, sliding off her own stool to come break through Ron’s embrace and wrap her own arms around Harry’s shoulders, smiling. “Hi, Harry. It’s been far too long.”
But, of course, with more alcohol came less sobriety, and after an hour or so, the bar itself became much livelier, enhanced and saturated by the warm liquid running like sweet electricity through Draco’s veins. At one point, a whole obnoxious group of barely-adults had spilled into the venue and cranked up the music, and now there was some sort of dance floor situation happening that he’d somehow been swept into, even though he wasn’t a dancer in any shape or form. Luna was out here with him, as well as Pansy, but she’d been sucked into the crowd a while ago and Draco hadn’t seen her since. Dancing with Luna was fun, though—she clearly didn’t give a rat’s ass about what anyone thought of her, so she danced like someone free. Someone in her element. Draco was certainly far,
Later, when Harry finally manages to fall asleep, it's to thoughts of the morning dawning blue and beautiful. It's to the even breath of Draco in his ear. It's to the metal band around Draco's finger, gleaming amid the black, holding sweet, saccharine promises. It’s to patterns of moonlight playing on the backs of Harry's eyelids and car horns honking in the near distance, filling him up, making him whole.
“Yes. I remember them being silk, with little animals embroidered all over the cape. They were tigers, I think? Or maybe leopards.”
“Will the couch be open?” she asked after swallowing, swaying slightly as she leaned back against her seat.
“This way,” he said, slightly out of breath, brandishing his arm to the black void that awaited just beyond the threshold. “You go first. There’s a light switch at the bottom of the stairs.”
“No,” Potter stopped him, straightening up off the table and pushing the wand back towards Draco. “Keep it. I want you to.”
Nott’s chair scraped as he stood. Goyle followed, but stopped to nod awkwardly at Luna. “Thanks for the tea.”
it was Harry Potter. What other Harry could it possibly be? How many Harrys were in the world? Draco only knew of one off the top of his head, and that one just happened to also be the only Harry that mattered. The only Harry that seemed to ever matter. He didn’t shake Greg, though, partially because that would be unfair to him, and partially because Draco didn’t think he could move if he tried.
“Yeah, alright.” Harry nodded affirmatively, then pushed off the wall with a heaving effort, trying not to stumble over the chipped pavement. The street was mostly empty, washed out by the flat yellow streetlights and carved with shadow. Even though he was outside, he could still feel the music vibrating his bones, making his vision pulse as he rounded the sharp corner into the alley and abruptly stumbled onto something he probably wasn’t meant to see.
“Warm-blooded,” she reminded him, spinning back towards the mirror and adjusting her neckline. “Do you think I could get Potter to cast a Warming Charm on me? I bet his Warming Charms are phenomenal.”
Draco didn’t want to talk about this. “It’s complicated,” he said again, firmer this time before changing the subject. “Do you have any wine? Red, specifically?”
Harry stepped forward onto the bottom stair, gaze now fixed steadily on Draco. His hand was gripping the railing, knuckles painted ivory, evidence of his present anxiety. “There’s always been an ‘us’, Draco. You know that,” he said quietly, and now he was the one who was wrong, because Draco certainly did
Draco stared at them a moment longer, then grunted and said, “Merlin, fine, since you’re both so bloody stubborn.”
“Not that I’m aware of, no.” Draco stepped up so both of his feet were on the boulder, toes curling around the edge. “Did you not feel the wards tear?” he asked after regaining his balance.
It was that time of the evening where the sun was just present enough to slant through gaps between the mossy boughs and dapple the ground, lighting up the entire path with little pools of gold. Harry kept walking, unsure how far Phoebe or Draco had gone, until the slow cadence of music was replaced with the soft sounds of leaves rustling and birds tittering in the canopy above. He followed the path all the way to the dilapidated wooden staircase that sloped down towards the stream, stopping at the top to take stock of the landscape.
Hermione smiled again, eyes crinkling, but there was something sad in there as she met Harry’s gaze. “Anyways, enough about me, we’ll have plenty of time to talk about this when we’re sober. We were talking about you.”
“Yeah, well,” Harry said, and his heart sped up, drumming a soft, familiar melody against his ribs. “She’s not the only one.”
“Hm,” she grunted, leaning back and stirring her drink with her tiny plastic straw. “I might have a theory, but I can’t be sure without knowing more. It’s not likely.”
Another beat passed, this one much longer and much, much heavier. Harry didn’t know how they’d switched gears so fast, but that happened with Luna. You always started somewhere with her and then ended up on an entirely different planet.
“Me too,” Theo jumped in, clearly anxious to say something before his silence got weirder. Greg didn’t add anything, but he nodded his head stiffly, like a puppet on a wire.
Hermione’s eyes were wide and frazzled, her skin tinted slightly green from the light of the fire. “What could you possibly need at one in the morning that isn’t emergency related?”
At one point, Pansy knocked on his half-open door and stuck her head inside, disrupting his brooding long enough to announce, “I’m going down to the ravine for a swim. Care to join me?”
He almost wished he missed it; it would’ve been an easy thing to do, given the jagged shadows and congregation of aluminum bins that theoretically should have blocked his view. There were bodies shifting against the far wall of the alley, and Harry should have just ignored them, but a hitched gasp and a flash of platinum hair locked him suddenly and unwillingly into place.
Pansy came up between the two of them and rested her sharp chin on Draco’s shoulder, arms settling around his waist, short hair brushing roughly against his cheek. “Home sweet home,” she declared, the words rolling off her tongue dully.
“The one about Phoebe. About why she’s been wandering off into Draco Malfoy’s backyard every morning.”
“Well, not like dementors or giants or anything like that, but she could be getting at poisonous plants or berries, or something. There tend to be a lot of those in woodlands that aren’t regularly maintained. It’s probably worth checking out.”
Potter—frozen, like a deer caught in headlights—swallowed visibly and issued a small, unsure, “I guess? But—”
“There are about a million things wrong with your dungarees, none of which I have the time or patience to relay to you. Do you really not have anything else? Anything at all?”
“Come to have a swim?” she called from below as Draco hauled himself up the edge of the ravine, one foot planted on a large, dented boulder that stuck out over the water. She was bobbing around in the alcove across from him, her dark, choppy hair pulled back into a mini ponytail to prevent it from getting wet.
On Saturday, he woke up and decided that having to endure an entire dinner that evening with Draco in attendance would be the worst possible idea on the planet, so he sent a note to Luna and Neville telling them apologetically that he was under the weather. Reluctantly, after about an hour of staring at a blank piece of parchment, Harry copied the note and sent it to the Slytherins via owl, then felt immensely relieved when it returned to his window empty-handed. He didn’t think he could handle seeing Draco’s handwriting telling him to “get well soon,” or worse, making some snarky joke at his expense. He couldn’t handle it.
“We think it’s got to do with our wands,” Theo had said, rubbing his eyes and sounding twenty years older than Draco had last seen him. “The Ministry’s been tracking us. The letters have got to be from them. Ministry workers.”
“I thought you might’ve, but it's always good to ask.” She came over to plop on Harry’s bedspread and folded her legs, mattress bouncing beneath her. She looked up at him, face open and bright. She wasn’t wearing any shoes. “Good morning.”
And he wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either—Malfoy seemed just as frustrated and confused with the civil Friday evenings spent in front of Harry’s fire as Harry was. He even went as far as to corner Harry in the kitchen one night, swaying a bit and blinking under the feeble overhead lighting, clearly tipsy. “Listen,” he said, putting two hands on the wooden countertop. “Can we talk?”
Theo raised his eyebrows as he grabbed his dark blue hooded jumper off the hook next to the door. “You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.”
“Isn’t that animal cruelty?” Pansy asked, turning her back on the window with her hands poised on her hips. She was still in pyjamas—they all were, in fact, all except for Draco himself—and she looked rather ridiculous, her huge t-shirt coming down to her knees and making her look half-undressed. “Yesterday you were lecturing me about the gender binary of canines, and now you’re using one for blackmail? You’ve changed your tune.”
Potter was standing with a stack of plates piled high in his arms, back arched slightly to keep them from slipping. Longbottom scoffed light-heartedly at the sight of him, dismissing his statement with a whimsical wave of the bottle opener. “Completely untrue. You asked us to be here.” He looked over his shoulder at Pansy and Draco and repeated, quieter, “He asked us to be here.”
“How horrible,” she’d cooed, frowning and straightening his collar. “Theo might have something to lend you. Come inside, please.”
Draco did, grabbing the striped yellow towel hanging patiently on the branch of a low-slung tree and tossing it down to her.
“Ugh,” Harry groaned, slumping down in his seat and letting his head loll back dramatically, hating that she was right. He wasn’t
“Harry Potter,” was the first thing Malfoy said when the Slytherins reached the bottom, his voice dripping with horror. “Please, for the love of Salazar, tell me you’re not wearing dungarees to a bar.”
Granted, it did get better after a generous serving of pancakes and a steaming cup of coffee, but there was still pain lingering behind his eyes hours later after he’d said goodbye to all three of his friends. “Get some rest,” Hermione advised him on the way out as she tugged on her coat. “I mean it. Take a day or two off work, if you need.”
Harry refrained from rolling his eyes again by stuffing his wand back into his pocket. “Not my fault you can’t do magic, Malfoy.”
“That color does look nice on you,” Luna pointed out blithely from behind Harry. “But we really should get going, now. Ron and Hermione have most likely arrived already.”
After zipping up his jacket and tucking the ends of his trousers into his wellies, he beckoned Luna to meet him around the side of the house where the toolshed was. Leaning against the peeling, dilapidated clapboards were two adjustable ladders and a stack of woven baskets with cushions on the inside and a fabric strap for slinging over the shoulder. They grabbed one of each and hauled them together across the clearing to the first blooming grove of speckled trees, wet grass squelching under their feet. There were small puddles of week-old rainwater gathered at the roots of the trees, brown and foggy.
“Hi,” she said quietly, mirroring him by sitting down and pulling her own knees up, resting her chin on them. She was wearing an oversized white t-shirt with sleeves that came down to her elbows. A pair of grey cotton shorts exposed her pale legs, supple under the slanting moonlight and dotted with small, soft, dark hairs. Her hair was down and her makeup was wiped away, the only remnants being dull smudges of grey around the corners of her eyes.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Harry groaned when he woke up and found the clump of blankets at the end of his bed empty. The whole house was empty, in fact, and for the first time in days, there were no stray Lunas or Nevilles straggling about in their pyjamas, making tea, or feeding the chickens. The kitchen was quiet, the hearth in the living room unlit, the backyard sheathed in feeble grey light. Harry didn’t mind being alone—he found it quite peaceful most of the time—but without Phoebe there, he felt suddenly and uncomfortably abandoned.
There was a squeak of door hinges, and someone came onto the porch. Someone with obnoxiously white hair and a black windbreaker.
“Yeah, fine.” Harry held out his elbow, beckoning Malfoy forward. “How long has it been since you all Apparated?”
Harry snorted lightly. “Don’t flatter yourself. I may have been your mortal enemy, but you weren’t mine.”
“About the Slytherins! She probably sensed their magic or something and sought it out because she didn’t know what it was. She’s not
“Do you feel the switch?” Malfoy asked when they reached the apparent bottom, and Harry groped around the brick wall until his fingers passed over something hard and plastic. He flicked it on, and the basement flooded with light, yellow and flickering. Harry took one look around the room and sneezed.
“Phoebe!” Potter called suddenly, voice pitching up a whole octave, and the dog jumped up and barreled towards the window.
“Sit anywhere you like,” Lovegood said, easing herself onto the arm of the sofa and casting her own over the room, as if presenting a piece of artwork. There was a plentiful cheese platter complete with grapes, sliced apple, and dehydrated dates sitting nicely in the center of the coffee table, surrounded by stray books and empty glass flutes. It was hard not to be impressed by the presentation of it all—even though that was the last thing Draco wanted to do.
Draco lifted his head from where it was tilted against the cool glass of the window, knees drawn up to his chest. He didn’t answer, instead meeting Pansy’s gaze across the darkened room and nodding slightly.
“You have to get through the hard stuff to get to the nice stuff,” she pointed out gently. “You should talk to Draco.”
Luna considered, moving her delicate fingers to the other brownish chick. Her nails were painted orange and cerulean, chipped and mismatched. “Tyche,” she said decisively. “And the other two can be Paean and Circe.”
Smiling around his straw, Potter flicked a wadded-up napkin at Weasley’s forehead. “Call my dog loopy again, you wanker.”
“I know you well enough,” Harry assured, tilting his head slightly to press a kiss into the fabric of Draco’s shoulder. Then, remembering the words that had been rattling around his brain for nearly a year, he added, “It only takes a moment to decide you love something.”
“Your familiar,” Ron said tiredly. “They’re, like, semi-magical entities that latch onto wizards or witches and assist them with magic or guide them. They’re a bit rare, though, aren’t they, ‘Mione?”
Part of Harry wanted to argue with Malfoy and maybe shove him down said set of stairs, but the other part of him was aching to get this over with and go home after being stuck outside in the cold for so long. He shouldered past Malfoy and stepped into the darkness, feeling around the wall for a railing he could grab onto, but finding nothing but slightly damp brick. Sighing, he kept one hand on the wall and began to slowly make his way down the stairs, making sure to walk in as straight a line as possible to avoid falling flat on his face. Behind him, he could feel Malfoy’s strangely noticeable body heat at the back of his neck like a furnace, bleeding into the darkness. Something smelled strongly of burnt sage.
“Oh, that’s what that was.” She squinted and tilted her head back, presumably so she could frown at Draco better. “You’re saying that the wards breaking led you to believe I got kidnapped? That’s a bit sexist, isn’t it?”
Harry wanted to ask, given that there wasn’t a single houseplant dead or alive in sight, but he didn’t ask. Instead he just nodded shortly and slipped out of the room, not really wanting to engage with a man whose parents had most likely murdered one or two of Harry’s classmates.
“Oh, right,” Neville replied through a yawn. There was a plate of partially-eaten apple tart sitting in front of him. “I think I saw her pass through here a few minutes ago. She went through the flappy thing.” He waved his hand at the rubber dog-flap built into the back door.
“I know!” he burst out, lifting his head. “I know, you’re right. I just—I don’t know how to ignore him. He’s like a parasite in my brain that just won’t leave.”
“That’s what you get for having a swim in October, lunatic,” Draco replied, but squeezed her arm fondly as if his touch just might help her warm up a bit. “Should we head back?”
Feeling as if they only had one possible option going forward, he looked to Draco and asked hopefully, “Would you like to get drunk, now?”
“Not quite,” Potter disagreed, looking the slightest bit surprised at Draco’s flippant use of Voldemort's name. “He defeated himself. Your wand had very little to do with it.”
After at least fifteen minutes of walking, the path they were following began dwindling down into a barely-trampled line of greenery snaking through the overgrown underbrush, unused and wild. Whoever lived next door must have not liked hiking, either, because this part of the woods seemed to be completely overrun with weeds and serrated ferns.
s. He took a breath in through his nose, holding it at the top of his lungs like Hermione taught him to do, and by the time he released, he was ready to face the music.
But then Draco was gone as quickly as he’d arrived, long coat swishing around his heels as he stepped off the porch and was engulfed by the night. Harry stood at the door, watching in a daze until the other man was nothing but a speck of blonde under the grey, sodium moonlight. Nothing but a stir against the churning shadows of the trees.
“Harry?” came Hermione’s hushed, gravelly voice, followed by a lamp flicking on and the appearance of her bare feet in front of the fireplace. Her legs bent, and she came into full view, wild hair and oversized Chudley Cannons t-shirt and everything. “Harry, what’s going on? Is there an emergency? Why are you—”
“Should we return her to her owners?” Greg piped up from the table, sounding anxious. “Maybe they were looking for her and they crossed the wards by accident.”
Draco dropped the card, frowning. “I don’t know. We have to, don’t we? It would be a crime against humanity to turn down an invitation from the Chosen One.”
And even if he was, Draco was occupied. He was off the market and in the hands of a boy named Theodore Nott. And that was
Harry rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms, pushing his glasses awkwardly up to the bridge of his nose. “That is exactly what I’m saying.”
“Jesus.” Harry rolled his eyes towards the unusually cloudless night, open and peppered with little silver pinpricks of stars. When he dropped his chin back down he asked, “Luna, you know where we’re going?”
.” Draco propped himself up on his elbows, glaring pointedly at Pansy. “We’re about to spend an entire evening at a nightclub with Potter’s friends, all because of you. It would’ve been so easy to not say anything, but you just
“Agreed,” Harry said emphatically, digging his nose into her neck and squeezing her so tight she squealed a little. When she pulled back, her grin spread even wider.
“Going somewhere?” Neville asked sleepily when Harry came padding into the kitchen in search of his trainers, probably looking like a madman, given that he was wearing half-pajamas and half-winter gear.
“Her robes,” Luna repeated, small and hopeful, as if she was afraid the words would run away from her if she didn’t catch them.
Luna took a step sideways, and from behind her Harry’s dog came rushing forward, tail wagging excitedly as she launched herself at Harry’s legs and nearly knocked him over.
He slipped out of bed and pulled on his flannel trousers and his heaviest black jumper, sleeves falling far past his fingertips. His hair was a nightmare, but he didn’t want to waste time trying to tame it back, so he just grabbed an elastic hairband and pulled the longest locks out of his face.
Luna met his flaming gaze with her signature calmness, hands clasped in front of her like some sort of school teacher. “Yes,” she said, “I did. I wanted to thank them for bringing Phoebe back.”
“First of all, I was never with Theo,” Draco argued. “And second of all, yes. He’s never bloody left my brain.”
“Why the fuck would she go to him like that?” Harry asked wildly, slumping down in his dining chair and feeling his jumper ruck up against the wood uncomfortably. There was probably going to be a red crease across his lower back later, but he couldn’t muster up the strength to care. The sight of Draco Malfoy had knocked it all out. “Why—how fucking long has he even been there?”
“Yep,” Potter confirmed, unlatching the window and budging it up to let a small, tawny-colored bird flurry inside. “Hermione’s.”
Harry snorted at her and shook his head lightly, not quite believing that this was his life. Now that he was fully awake, he could appreciate Luna’s energy in a way he couldn’t before; she seemed to light up the yard like she did every Saturday when she visited. She was about as welcome to the house as the fruit was to the trees; the walls brightened and the floorboards curved upward in a smile whenever she came around, as if the house was happy to see her. Harry didn’t blame it, even if she could be a bit much at times.
The backyard was—well. Overgrown, for one. Green, for another. Untamed and clearly unregulated. There were trees on all sides, blooming in rich shades of orange and yellow that staunchly reminded Draco of Wiltshire in autumn, of the manicured trees that had neatly lined the gravel drive of the Manor once upon a time. A small dirt path cut through the garden like an artery, crowded in by tall, swaying grass and budding wildflowers; in the near distance a fountain shaped like a mermaid gurgled faintly, her arms winding skyward like a ballet dancer.
He set off towards the North corner with hazy determination, trying not to let the bleariness from waking up so early deter him. Birds chirped around him jovially, and there was a thin layer of fog ghosting the treetops and obscuring the not-so-distant hillside. The tangled North grove loomed high and mighty over the clearing, the branches of ferns curling outward like skeletal hands that grasped at Harry as he stepped by, clawing at his feet.
Draco sighed again, softer. “Sorry. Weddings have strange effects on me. It’s quite inconvenient, really.”
“Yes!” Luna sat forward. “Last time I was here, their eyes weren’t open yet. They’d have opened by now, wouldn’t they?”
yet. She was just an animal living in his house and eating his food. He hadn’t even meant to get a dog, it just sort of happened accidentally. Luna had given him a flyer about a charity day the local animal shelter was having, and he’d taken one look at Phoebe and decided,
Then the hand that Harry wasn’t using to steady himself on the railing was touching Draco’s wrist, but Draco didn’t know how it had gotten there or how long it'd been there. It felt like forever.
Draco pinches his ear lightly, lovingly. Harry wonders how he got here. “We have to get up tomorrow at six for the Portkey, and while I don’t fancy dragging you there by your feet, I will if I must.”
“Ah,” Malfoy said, mouth wavering, like he was debating whether or not he should smile. “Well, they were quite lovely. At least, my five-year-old mind thought so.”
“Nice place,” Harry commented, and Malfoy shot him a glare before fiddling with the handle of a skinny door off to the side of the room. It took him a moment to get it open, the eggshell-colored paint sticky and unyielding, and he nearly stumbled into Harry once he finally got it unstuck.
Harry followed his movement and looked back towards the bar, where Luna and Ron were engaged in some spirited conversation together and Parkinson was holding onto a ruffled-looking Nott with one arm and a flushed Draco with the other. Harry's eyes couldn’t help but linger on the latter; his button-up shirt was wrinkled and untucked, his hair mussed up. Harry’s heart thumped loud and hard against his ribcage, but he looked away before Draco could see him looking.
“Oh my god,” Potter groaned, dropping his handful of pebbles into the grass and scrubbing a hand down his face. “Malfoy, I’ve been out here for over an hour.”
Draco was at the very back of the group—they had to walk single-file because the trail was so skinny—and for reasons unbeknownst to him, the speckled dog stuck by his heels almost the entire time. She panted heavily and happily, sometimes stepping on the rubbery bits of his boots near his heels, as if she was herding him along the trail. She obviously knew where she was going, although she didn’t seem to be in a rush to get back.
Draco’s stomach fell so fast he could almost hear it thunk against the ground. All around him the atmosphere tensed; the wind seemed to stop blowing, the birds seemed to stop chirping.
“Unfortunately, he still has magic, so I seriously doubt it,” Draco said. “And since when did you start caring about his health?”
“Hermione?” he asked through flames when his best friends’ living room came into view fuzzily. It was dark, just barely lit by the grey wash of moonlight through the windows; there were shoes piled in front of the door, blankets thrown carelessly across their familiar Chesterfield sofa, books stacked atop their thick Persian rug. Evidence of what had probably been a warm, quiet evening, not unlike Harry’s.
Theo shook his head and began moving away, stepping over a clump of daisies so he could stand in the centre of the clearing. “Pansy went swimming down at the ravine again.”
“Thanks.” She wrapped herself in it, holding it around her shoulders like a cape as she made her way back up the jagged slope of the ravine. When she finally reached the top, she asked, “Did the wards really tear?”
“If you say so,” Harry allowed, not wanting to argue despite his skepticism. He followed Draco’s lead anyway, levering himself off the sofa and balancing his weight against one of its arms while blood rushed to his head. As Draco started off down the hall, Harry plucked their near-empty Mason jars from the coffee table and wobbled into the kitchen, dropping them into the sink unceremoniously. The floorboards in the corridor creaked gently, followed by a rhythmic clicking of paws that signalled the movement of Phoebe. Knowing her, she was probably shadowing Draco towards the foyer, her eyes large and pleading for him to stay.
“Multiple times.” Pansy spun away from the mirror, feathery earrings swinging wildly around her cheeks. “How do you like this one?” She brandished her arms down her dress, black and thin with a silvery belt cinching the waist and long, belled sleeves.
“Have everything?” he asked when he emerged into the foyer, keeping one hand wrapped around the doorframe for support. Draco was sitting on the bottom step of the stairwell with his coat on, putting on his shoes while Phoebe sniffed insistently at his knees.
Another honk sounded, followed by the sputtering rev of the car engine, so he shook himself and started to jog back, tendrils of hair slipping out from his tie and spilling into his face annoyingly. “No dog?” Neville asked when he finally reached the car and folded himself into the front seat where Neville had just moved from.
Draco must have felt it too, because his cheeks were dusted with pink when he lifted his head and met Harry’s gaze. “If that’s the case, we should probably start calling each other by our first names.”
Potter looked over as if noticing him for the first time. “Malfoy,” he replied, tilting his chin up.
“Which really means having us figure it out for you,” Hermione finished for him, her smile stretching.
“I just…” Harry’s thumb was resting on Draco’s cheek, fingers holding to the back of his neck. He moved, brushing the pad of his thumb up Draco’s cheekbone. “I can’t really believe this is happening. That you’re letting me do this.”
Malfoy’s brow screwed up in frustration, then almost automatically smoothed back down. “Fine,” he said, taking a breath in. “Don’t leave. But you’re not coming inside.”
“Good.” They stared at each other a second longer, then Potter broke eye contact, apparently satisfied. “We’re having vegetable linguine for dinner, it should be done in a few minutes. I don’t have enough dining chairs for all of us, so we’ll have to eat in here. I hope that’s alright with all of you.”
“He didn’t force me,” Draco said to his knees, breaking his gaze away and staring at his own socks. White and plain, with little moth holes. “And he didn’t know we would end up seeing Potter. He’s got nothing to feel bad about.”
“Okay,” Harry said, praying to Godric that Draco couldn’t hear the way his heart was slamming against his chest, pounding in his ears. “Fine. I don’t even care that much. Have a good night, Malfoy.”
Harry’s smile widened, but he ducked his head down so Draco couldn’t see it and poke fun at him. “You’re very welcome.”
“Come along, Emerson,” Pansy chirped to the dog as she slipped her flip flops on. Draco rolled his eyes, but decided to let it slide this once as they turned and started back in the direction of the house, the little, speckled dog following close at their heels.
“You’re not really ill, are you?” Draco asked when they were halfway through the bottle, his head pillowed against the back cushion, his eyes strangely sincere.
“Hm,” Draco hummed lowly, shifting in his seat. “I can understand that, I suppose. Your life seems exhausting.”
“Elaborate?” He felt Neville’s shoe poke him in the shin, and he lifted his head reluctantly. Took a breath.
“This is more than withdrawal,” Harry said, frowning at his dog as he stroked the curve of her back. “It’s almost like she’s magnetically attracted to Malfoy, which is creepy as fuck when you think about it.”
However, the last thing he wanted to do was go searching for her and cross the property line again. He didn’t want to see Malfoy, or Nott, or Goyle, or Parkinson, or anyone. He just wanted his dog.
Draco’s shoes clicked subtly on the bare floor as he walked through the adjoining hallway, slowly taking in the drab beige wallpaper—faded and chalky, peeling towards the bottom—and the trampled carpet, patterned with stoic and sad-looking flowers. Somewhere ahead of him in the kitchen, a leather bag thumped against wood and a chair scraped loudly.
“And drink lots of water,” Luna added meaningfully, reaching up to pat his cheek before he closed the door on them. “Take care of yourself. You deserve a break.”
She waved her hand. “Irrelevant. Have you come to save me from my damsel-like distress, o’ brave knight in shining armor?”
“That’s so fucking weird,” Weasley laughed; Draco had forgotten how loud his voice was. “Have you taken her to the vet recently? Maybe she’s gone loopy or something.”
It was worth the smile on Draco’s face. “Take your shoes off,” he instructed, knocking their ankles together. “The water’s warm.”
“No,” Draco conceded. “It wasn’t.” He shifted in his seat again and unfolded his legs, his back arching as he stretched his arms above his head. “What time is it?” he asked through a yawn, and Harry glanced waywardly at the clock above the mantelpiece.
Harry lifts his head and glares at Draco’s sleek, Cheshire smile. His skin is glowing slightly in the pool of pale, mottled light streaming through the bedroom window. “That must be why I’m marrying you, then.”
“I’ll go grab our coats,” Potter said, and five minutes later he and Draco were standing on the bottom step of the back porch, hands in their pockets, Draco’s foot hovering over his wand.
Later, after the dancing had slowed and the piano had been replaced with an enchanted gramophone that played real music, Harry excused himself to the bathroom and returned to find Draco missing. Hermione and Ron were both sitting on the steps of the back porch, clearly exhausted, Hermione’s heels discarded to the side and Ron’s tie undone around his neck.
“I do,” Draco said quickly. “I do. Trust me, I want to, more than anything in the world. But I…” He looked down at the wand—the wand that he’d cast his very first spell with, that had kept him company all throughout his tumultuous teenage years, that had been loyal to him until the end—and decided that he’d outgrown it a long time ago. “It doesn’t belong to me anymore,” he finished, looking at Potter resolutely. “It’s yours. Even if you never use it, it’s yours.”
Harry thought. “‘M fine,” he answered fuzzily, and then he heard a rustle of clothing and felt Hermione sit down next to him. “Nauseous.”
“I highly doubt that,” Harry replied, but took his shoes off anyway and placed them next to Draco’s pile, tucking his balled-up socks into the openings. Draco squeezed his fingers as he scooted forward onto the edge and dipped his toes into the stream, expecting ice. But the water was warm.
“Did I?” she asked, gaze wide and blue, pinned on the wand in his hand. She didn’t seem nearly as fazed as most people would have, but then again, this was Luna. “Goodness, sorry about that. I didn’t mean to.”
Feeling unsteady, Harry continued slowly down the thin brown path until it opened up onto a dipped clearing surrounded by elm and laurel trees, all bending inward towards the centre where a house not unlike his own came into view. It was two-storied, made of sun-bleached stone and stained clapboard, the roof slanted and stark against the soft curves of the rising hills. The windows were large and coated with chipped yellow paint, timeworn and sticky-looking, and there were clusters of ivy crawling up the sides and engulfing the building in dark shades of green.
Harry’s gaze slid back to Malfoy on its own accord. He was still standing, one hand white-knuckled over the back of his chair—no,
“Harry… Potter?” Greg asked from behind, and Draco wanted to spin around and shake him silly because
Oddly enough, the weirdest part of dinner wasn’t the staring or the blushing or the dismantling of Draco’s well-cooked vegan soup; the weirdest part was when Potter asked, completely out of the blue, “Do you miss it?” then immediately looked like he wanted to take it back.
Draco had never experienced such an intense moment before. It was like time had surrendered its iron-fisted hold and locked the two of them into place, unable to look away.
“Still,” Draco insisted. Every nerve in his body was buzzing. It felt like he was holding a bone in his hands, one that was plucked from his own skeleton.
“I think once people become national treasures, they stay that way,” Theo responded, but he sounded thoughtful. “Unless they go and murder someone, or something. They’d have to get their privileges revoked then.”
Then Theo grinned wickedly and took Draco’s arm, his skin as hot as an open flame, and together they stumbled towards the door, swaying through the hazy throng of punch-drunk Muggles and leaving behind the rest of their crew. Pansy and Luna would be alright without him, Draco thought as the exit grew nearer, his heart rate climbing higher and higher. They’d be fine. Perfectly fine.
“I’m sorry, Luna, I just—” he frowned and rubbed at his temples. “I know you were trying to be nice, but I can’t deal with them. Not—not today.”
“Oh, I don’t know.” She carefully extracted her hand from between Harry’s, but not before pressing a gentle, motherly peck to the back of his knuckles. “We were potentially thinking May, when the weather starts to get warmer, but we haven’t settled on anything yet. It’ll be small, though. Only immediate relatives and close friends.”
“Hey, Luna,” he said after a slow moment, squinting slightly as he scanned the yard. “Where’s Phoebe?”
It was odd that Phoebe would wander off over there, but it wasn’t unfathomable; there was a lot for her to sniff around and discover, what with the wild bushes of blackberries and the spindly ferns that overtook the area. She’d probably spent the morning tracking down the squirrels and field mice that liked to hide amid the greenery. Harry told Luna this, and she frowned and said “Poor squirrels.”
“Going to bed?” Draco asked quietly, voice raspy as he flicked his gaze up to hers. He’d barely spoken since that morning, having been locked away in his bedroom since they returned from their jaunt through the woods, spending the rest of his day brooding, then crying a little, then brooding some more.
“Oh my god, fine,” Hermione replied, still laughing. “Nice to know you don’t want to be my girlfriend. Your loss, honestly.”
If the house looked similar to Harry’s from the outside, the inside was an entirely different world altogether. Whereas Harry’s kitchen was cluttered with over-eager houseplants, hanging copper pots, and cheerfully patterned crockery, Malfoy’s was practically a wasteland. The counters were empty and coated with dust, smattered with small circular rings where water glasses or mugs must have been set down at one point. The dining table was home to one meager-looking fruit bowl that didn’t hold any fruit—only a ring of keys, a pile of loose change, and a crumpled takeout menu.
Harry hated it, but not enough to make him throw his wine glass or flip the coffee table on its side. He was having a hard enough time deciding whether or not he should be annoyed at these people for intruding on his life.
Then—as if this day couldn’t get more unimaginable—Lovegood smiled earnestly and asked, “Would you boys like to come in for tea?”
“Sorry,” Harry apologised monotonously, not meaning it even a little bit. He was burning up in the places where Draco had bumped into him.
Draco folded his arms, eyes slanting. “It is your fault for having a stove that only works with magic, though. What’s with that?”
His mouth was pressed into a thin line, caught somewhere between scared shitless and blazingly angry; his thin, pale hands were wrapped around the edge of the table bracingly. But he didn’t answer Harry—Theodore Nott did.
Silence weighted the room. Harry’s hand stilled, and he looked up to find Malfoy already staring at him, eyes wide, fingers digging into the velvet armrests.
How had she known? How had she turned the right corner in the middle of a thick, wild forest and found Draco waiting for her on the other side? And how had she known to keep going back?
A shiver spilled over Draco’s shoulders and down his spine. Harry’s face looking up at him was earnest and pleading, the orange light from Draco’s window casting soft lines over his skin.
Now, from the other tree, Harry heard Luna humming a familiar song under her breath as she picked, her blonde hair flashing through the clumps of branches. Harry thought it might be “Golden Slumbers” by The Beatles, but he wasn’t sure. All their songs tended to melt together.
Potter shook his head, sitting back on the edge of the table. “It’s always been weak for me. I know I won it from you, but I don’t think its allegiance has ever fully changed.”
“Oh,” Harry said, blinking, realising that he hadn’t seen Phoebe since he’d woken up that morning. “Yeah, she can. Let me go check the house really quick. Nev, can you get the car running?”
“Did you feel that, too?” a voice called over Draco’s shoulder, and he turned to see Theo pushing through the back door and coming out onto the porch, forehead creased with concern.
Harry peeked through his fingers, gaze falling on the half-eaten platter of apple tart, gooey and warm-looking, inviting Harry to come take a slice, but he’d completely lost his appetite. “Thanks,” he said anyway, tired.
“And I really don’t want to come in, yet here I am asking your permission,” Draco countered witheringly.
Harry knew exactly where she’d gone. “Thank you,” he told Hermione before squeezing her shoulder gratefully and stepping fully off the porch, purposefully missing the last two stairs. It took him longer than necessary to weave through the dispersed congregation of tables and guests, people stopping him every few steps and telling him what a beautiful home he had or what a funny speech he gave. Eager to get away from the crowd and find out what exactly Draco was doing, Harry smiled and nodded his way to the edge of the clearing where he could surreptitiously duck onto the path. He could still hear voices and laughter even after the clearing had disappeared from sight, seeming to follow him through the tangled trees and down the well-worn trail.
Ending up in Bedfordshire had been a stroke of good luck amid their scramble between dwellings and 40-hour workweeks—it was the first house in nearly three years they hadn’t needed to pay for. It was the first house that was so removed from the wizarding world that it was practically an oasis. Walking through the front door all those months ago had felt like surfacing from a grimy pool of anxiety and hardship, and the house had wrapped around them like a warm blanket. For once in his life, Draco had felt absolutely sure that everything was going to be okay.
“I mean, children withdraw from their parents when they go through puberty, and she’s kind of like Harry’s child. You know?”
“That doesn’t explain why she’s been coming over here, though,” Draco retorted, pushing his chair out and coming to stand beside her. The brown and grey dog—Emerson, as Pansy insisted on calling her—was still prancing around outside, sticking her wet nose into the beds of untamed wildflowers and sniffing the dilapidated, weed-covered patio furniture. He went on, “It’s not like we’ve been leaving food out or anything. She just showed up out of nowhere.”
“Do you not remember why we moved out here in the first place?” Draco asked, whirling around and leveling them both with disbelieving looks. They didn’t answer. “To get away from wizards! Not to live right bloody next to them and become best friends who lend cups of sugar to each other!”
There was an alley right around the side of the bar—the same one that they’d Apparated into not two hours earlier—and there was also a long, open strip of wall that Draco found himself pressed against in the blink of an eye. And then there was cool brick against Draco’s lower back, then more heat, more hands, more lips, and he tried with all his might to get green eyes and cherry stains out of his vision as his head tipped back and his eyes slid closed, but still the name clinging to his tongue was one that certainly did not belong to Theo.
“Your five-year-old mind has great taste,” Luna said, and then Malfoy couldn’t seem to hold back a smile any longer. It was tentative and small, but nothing like the smiles Harry was used to seeing on him. It softened his features, almost, making him blend in with the gold satin of the evening rather than stand out against it like some sort of dark stain.
Startled, he whipped around and grabbed at his neck, looking in the direction of the noise that had sounded somewhere from beyond the fluttering clothesline. It had sounded almost like a firecracker, booming and sharp, over in less than a second. It sounded like something had been shot into the air, or cracked open, or torn.
“Shoes are oppressive!” she called back, and really, Harry should’ve expected that, but he shook his head anyway. If she stepped on any mushy fallen apples, that was her problem.
“Your magic,” Potter said, looking almost uncomfortable with the question. His fingers flexed around the chair. “Is it—are you not using magic because of your wand?”
Harry was nearly at the bottom of the steps when he heard a soft cough from behind him. “What’s she the goddess of?”
“Very good,” Draco agreed. Strange, how they were doing that now—agreeing on things. “But—what about you?”
“Even if there was a way, do you honestly think they’d listen to us?” Theo had challenged, holding his arms out. “We’re not exactly friendly faces over there.”
They exchanged vows under an archway made out of two blossoming apple trees whose branches were wound together loosely, shaking leaves down onto the happy couple as they slid shimmering gold rings onto each other’s fingers. Harry cried a bit and squeezed Draco’s hand; Draco gave him a handkerchief and told him to “get ahold of yourself, you great oaf,” and then Harry laughed, and his best friends were married, and everything was okay.
Draco’s breath tickles the shell of his ear. “The bed won’t have a bed frame, because according to you they’re unnecessary. And there’ll be Dean’s artwork on the walls and Greg’s pottery on the shelves. And there will be books. Lots of them. In the corners and on the windowsills and under the covers.”
“Just me and Neville,” Luna piped up, her head in Harry’s lap and feet propped up on the hearth. “He doesn’t pay us, though.”
“Yeah,” Harry nods. His eyelids want to close, but he doesn’t let them. Doesn’t want to let them. Doesn’t want to let go of the warmth and the citrus and the moonlight just yet. “I don’t think Ron and ‘Mione count as regular straight people, though. They’re just— they just
Draco studied the wood above his head; the boards were splintered and sagging, but not in a neglected way. In a well-loved way.
“Ron proposed last week,” she explained gently, holding her hand out in front of her like she was looking at the ring for the first time, too. She was smiling, faint and secretive. “That’s part of why we invited you out tonight. So we could tell you in person.”
It had taken him quite a long time to figure out the best way to harvest the apples when he first bought the property, back when he was all wide-eyed and reckless, aching to get out of the city. He hadn’t even been sure he would use the orchard when he bought it, since it used to be all sad and bent out of shape, the trees sagging and the fruit lacking. But now—after nearly two years of living here—Harry could say that he had more or less got the hang of it. He knew, now, what trees were the best to pick from, how to check if an apple was truly ripe, how not to bruise it after picking it. He knew how to turn those apples into apple juice, and apple fritter, and fruit salad, and apple pie. He was creating a small living for himself just based on the orchard, selling a few crates of fresh apples every month or so at a farmers’ market and donating the rest to London-based food banks that needed them.
“Where’s Neville?” Harry asked after a stretched beat of silence, eyes fixed on the chipped paint of the door through the wire screen.
“Do you?” Luna’s eyebrows arched curiously. “That’s very kind. Most people from your year don’t remember me all that much.”
“Not anymore,” Luna pointed out, folding her hands over her stomach. There was a straw-colored strand of hair cutting across her cheek, so Harry brushed it out of the way carefully, and she flashed a brief smile in his direction.
He turned the faucet off, listening to the steady stream of water turn into a slow drip, hitting the metal basin of the sink with soft
Except—well. It didn’t feel like an intrusion anymore. Not with them sitting in his living room, eating his food, making conversation. It felt like a misstep. Like maybe the universe wasn’t actually playing some cruel prank on Harry, and this reunion hadn’t been predetermined whatsoever. Like it was an accident—a stumble of fate.
“No one’s cleaned down here in over a decade,” Malfoy said from behind him, nose scrunched as he swatted away plumes of agitated dust and headed towards a rectangular brick niche across from the rickety stairwell. “Wards are this way.”
“Thank you,” Potter replied dutifully, adjusting the mountain of plates in his arms. He looked—to Draco’s utter disappointment—undeniably charming, backlit by the soft light from the kitchen, dressed in beige slacks and a linen shirt, sleeves rucked up to the elbows and exposing the deep brown tan of his forearms. He was wearing bracelets, Draco noticed—little woven ones with knots at the end and beads in the middle, tangled together around his wrists.
“You’re pretty unforgettable,” Greg blurted, apparently shocked out of his stupor. His face turned as red as the apples nestled in the trees, like he hadn’t meant to say that out loud.
“It was,” Nott jumped in. “I mean—mine, Draco’s, and Goyle’s. Only for a year though, while we served out our parole. Technically we’re allowed to do magic now, we just choose not to, so the Ministry doesn’t have the means to catch up with us.”
drunk, though—he wasn’t seeing double or anything, and he could probably still tell someone the name of the prime minister if they asked. Not that they would, because that would be an odd question to ask a drunk man. But it could happen.
“Fine,” Malfoy repeated, then proceeded to spin around and slam the door shut, leaving Harry alone on the porch, dripping wet.
“So, it’s going to be fine. Luna won’t let anything bad happen on her watch, I know it.” She paused, then spun in front of the mirror and frowned at herself. “Should I wear tights under this?”
I figured out. I’m not that imbecilic. But why did she invite us in the first place? And why did you go along with it?”
“Okay,” Hermione cut in, shutting them down. “Enough. The sooner we get this over with, the sooner we can all go back to sleep. Capiche?”
Harry saw flashes of him when his eyes slid closed at night. He saw writhing bodies pressed against brick and sharp eyes cutting through shadows. He heard staggered breathing and shoes scuffling against pavement.
“The wards are in the basement,” Malfoy explained as he continued onward through the entryway of the depressing kitchen into an even more depressing living room, dominated by a frumpy sofa and a sagging coffee table that looked about a century old. There was also a tiny television set shoved into the corner, its antenna wonkily bent out of shape and its screen covered in fingerprints.
“Yes, yes, right. Apple-picking.” She drew her hands out, too, and brushed them off on her skirt, getting little bits of hay caught in the sheer material. Evidently, she’d forgotten about her cabbage-shaped mug of tea, as it was sitting untouched on the flat roof of the henhouse. “Will Nev be coming by today to help out as well?” she asked curiously.
“I figured.” She was still smiling, Merlin. “That was very thoughtful of you. All of you.” Lovegood turned her smile to the lot of them, then down to the dog who was sniffing determinedly around her ankles. “She’s been going missing every morning for this past week. We were quite worried.” She reached down to scratch the dog’s head. “I knew she’d be alright, though. She’s very clever.” Lovegood looked back up at them. “Either way, Harry will be pleased you brought her back.”
On Tuesday it snowed again. Wednesday it didn’t, but the soil in the yard was still too frozen for Harry to break through. So instead, he decided to sleep in until noon. He played solitaire with himself in front of the fire and won every time. He listened to Mazzy Star and Elliott Smith over the wireless as he cooked lunch. He cracked open
“Brilliant,” Potter said, and then he was gone again, disappearing into the kitchen, leaving Draco and his friends to the painfully earnest faces of Lovegood and Longbottom.
Harry opened his mouth to say “thank you,” then decided that Malfoy didn’t deserve thanks, given that he’d quite literally kidnapped Harry’s dog and then forced him into a basement. So, instead, he just stowed his wand into his back pocket and pushed past Malfoy, barely resisting the urge to roughly shoulder him into the wall and maybe spit on his shoes.
Lovegood waved her hand to beckon them into the hallway, so Draco sucked in a breath and followed her into the next room, Pansy close behind him. Greg and Theo had yet to say a word, and now that he thought about it, Draco could barely hear if they were breathing or not. He wouldn’t be surprised if they weren’t.
A lump of dread the size of a bludger lodged itself in the back of Harry’s throat. Mind reeling, heart thumping, he fumbled for his wand on the nightstand and tried not to trip over the too-long legs of his flannel pyjamas. He was nearly a second too late, fingers closing around the rugged holly handle at the exact moment the door to his bedroom clicked and swung all the way open.
Of course, it hadn’t been easy. Back when he’d bought it off a haughty-looking real estate wizard, the slumping groves and old, fragile house had seemed unappealing at first glance. But then—almost by accident—Harry had fallen in love with the place.
“Not today, much as I’d enjoy freezing my appendages off,” Draco replied wryly, squinting down at her. The grey-ish sunlight was streaking sporadically through the trees and reflecting off the surface of the water, flashing in Draco’s vision. “Just checking to see whether or not you’ve been kidnapped.”
They both agreed that would be easy, and time went on. October slid quickly into November, and soon the days began to shrink in daylight and Harry began to spend more and more time in the depths of his orchard, pruning and picking for hours each day in preparation for the rapidly oncoming winter. Neville’s visits got more sporadic as his classes picked up speed, while Luna’s got more frequent. She began staying entire weekends, falling asleep on Harry’s couch late in the evening after Friday dinners and, frankly, forgetting to go home. Not that Harry minded.
“Noted,” Draco said, cranking up one of the knobs on the front of the stove and making the orange flame flare up dangerously. Harry left the room, thinking that maybe it wouldn’t hurt to go write his will just in case he really did end up dead by the end of the night.
They stared at each other a moment longer, the stirrings of a challenge brewing in the space between them. Stirrings that were both familiar and unfamiliar—charged with energy Harry recognised, but laced with something deeper. Something more intense.
Phoebe made a high-pitched whining noise that probably meant yes and shook herself excitedly. Harry squinted slightly and noticed a layer of dirt caking her paws and the tips of her fur. He frowned and bent down to get a closer look.
Harry scowled and shoved his hands into his pockets, unwilling to seem even the slightest bit pleased at the sight of another living thing. “You know exactly what I’ve come for. Give me my dog back.”
He disappeared into the hallway, leaving Draco to sip at his soup in relative silence. Except he wasn’t completely alone—Phoebe was lying on her side under the table, her tail lazily flicking Draco’s ankle every so often. She’d stuck to his side nearly the entire time he’d been here, following him around the kitchen and whining at him when he didn’t let her taste any of Luna’s homemade soup, and Draco could tell it was getting on Potter’s nerves.
(for trigger warning) mentions of death threats are located below the page break after the sentence, "before he could stop and change his mind, he wound his arm back and threw it." a good spot to pick back up is at the sentence "for the next two years, the four of them lived like nomads..." hope that helps!
Pansy shrugged, sliding the note closer with her stiletto-shaped fingernail. “Read it yourself. It looks like it was written by Lovegood—there are hearts above the i’s—but it came from the address next door. They suggested this Friday.”
“Is that it, there?” Malfoy asked, reaching his hand over Harry’s shoulder and pointing at a small gap in the sequence where the runes were faded and dull.
Potter blinked, then cast a look around the room, meeting Draco’s gaze for a fleeting moment. “Er. I mean, she didn’t really specify, but she knows that I’ve been having people over. So—”
“Harry?” the voice came again, seeping up through the floorboards like bleeding honey. There was an ominous creak of wood followed by what sounded like footsteps, and Harry realised with delayed clarity that there was an intruder coming up the stairs.
Harry tried not to shiver at the word ‘darling’ coming out of Draco’s mouth, his accent still crystal-cut despite the alcohol soaking into his system.
Draco had been alone. He’d never been alone before—he was without a home, without money. Without anyone on his side.
“Why are they here?” Harry demanded, tearing his eyes away from Malfoy and staring at Luna instead. “Did you let them in?”
“Mm.” Draco shifts and brings a hand up to kiss Harry’s jaw with his knuckles. Gentle; absent. “I’ll tell you what,” he starts, his breath warm on Harry’s neck. Harry wants to melt into him. “After tomorrow, when all the papers have been signed and all the champagne glasses have been picked up, we can go look at places.”
“That’s fine too,” she assured. “Feelings are complicated. Christ, I’m engaged and even I don’t understand them half of the time.”
“Clearly it is, if you’ve been playing musical chairs all over the country,” Harry disagreed. “Is that why you aren’t doing magic?”
The lump remained motionless, content to keep on snoozing. Harry wanted to scream at her, but he knew that would draw attention to his bedroom, if his bumbling footsteps hadn’t done so already.
Hermione gave him another look, her gaze dangerous and testing, so Harry let it go. She stood up from the fireplace and disappeared from the room for a moment, her footsteps retreating down the hall and most likely to their bedroom, then she returned with her arm wound around the waist of a half-conscious Ron. Harry felt horrible—waking Ron up was like waking up a sleeping dragon, and someone was bound to get a mouthful of fire.
“A bit,” he admitted, abashed. It was hard for him to get through dense novels, but the ones Luna had gifted him were written for teenagers and easy on his dyslexia because the font was so large. “I’ve only finished the first book, though.”
“And they’ll be here when we get back,” Harry promised, shutting the back door behind him. The crates of apples were sitting around the side of the house, waiting to be picked up and lugged down the hill so they could be shoved haphazardly into the boot of the car. Levitation charms were iffy because they tended to bruise the apples, so instead Luna cast lightening charms on all of them and they each took two, one stacked on top of the other.
Potter’s mouth pressed into a thin line, his top lip sucking in. “I don’t know,” he decided after a beat, shoulders slumping. “I was just wondering. And I’m trying not to argue with you.”
It was protective in nature: a sturdy building with a solid foundation and walls that curved inward as if they were trying to shelter its innards from the outside world. On hot days in the summer, it would trap the sunlight inside and let it soak into the wood and stone, heating the floors and swelling the furniture. On cold days in the winter, it would fight the cold out like a ship battling a storm, hunkering into itself and battening down the hatches. It was comfortable and familiar, its cherry wood floors and exposed ceilings warm; safe. Harry felt protected here.
Outside, the clouds waver and a chipped corner of the pearl-white moon spills into view. A car honks in the distance.
Harry wasn’t sure why Ron and Hermione had chosen this place in particular to meet up, given there was a perfectly pleasant pub just around the corner that served vegan snack mixes and played Bowie over the loudspeakers, but he wasn’t going to question it. It was entirely possible that they didn’t get out enough in London, what with their highly demanding work schedules, so Harry was perfectly happy to give them an exciting night out if that’s what they wanted.
He wiped his forehead with the back of his gloved hand and peered at the wild, shadowed part of the yard that engulfed the North corner, feeling a heavy anvil of responsibility press down on his shoulders. He didn’t know what was over there other than old, probably diseased apple trees and out-of-control underbrush, and he didn’t really want to know. But the mediator within him urged him that learning to control that area would be another step in learning how to be a real, genuine farmer as opposed to the amateur-adjacent farmer he currently felt like. He really did need to tidy the place up, especially if Phoebe was going to continue her mysterious adventures.
He thought about what Luna had said—how it only takes a moment to decide you love something. He wondered if that applied to other things besides Fleetwood Mac songs and shelter dogs; if it applied to people, too.
“I love your hair,” Parkinson said after a still beat, smiling as she did so. “How do you get it to braid that way?”
“You’ve been getting the letters, too?” Greg had asked Draco tiredly, the bags under his eyes making him look shadowed and bruised.
“Yes,” he admitted faintly, thinking of Malfoy’s sharp, angled face, of his blanched hair sifting in a tumbling breeze, a crooked house with a sunken roof poised behind him, framed with green. “Yes, I am.”
“I know you’re not, but that’s no excuse to skip out on two meals. Did you even have breakfast this morning?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, trailing off as Draco finished knotting his laces and stood up from the stairs, swaying. He steadied himself against the balustrade.
“I thought so,” Luna hummed. “I believe a distant aunt of yours taught my mother how to speak French, too. She was quite good at it, I remember.”
“Old times’ sake,” Draco echoed, his brain going fuzzy for a moment, and then going sharp again when he realised what exactly he was being asked. “You mean—here? Now?”
“I don’t know,” Harry said as he turned this new slew of information over and over in his head, heart beating at the speed of light. “I like your theory better.”
mug—on the table with a small clink. “It’s been in their family for years. They’re just letting us use it, for the time being.”
too early for a conversation with her. He needed time to prepare for those—or at the very least a warning. “The, um, the chicks, you mean?”
Harry paused, then repeated, “What are you doing here?” He looked around, meeting all of their gazes. “In Bedford, I mean. All the way out here in the middle of nowhere.”
“I—yes, I remember you.” Theo swallowed and dropped his hand, drawing it close to himself as if he’d just touched dry ice. “From Hogwarts.”
She slipped inside and closed the door carefully behind her, handle clicking, then made her way slowly across the room and to the cushioned window seat where Draco was curled.
“That’s the one,” Theo confirmed, straightening up. “My hypothesis is that whoever’s living there crossed over the property line and then Disapparated before they could get caught.”
“It’s really not,” Draco argued, feeling defensive of the poor thing. It shouldn’t have to be subject to Pansy’s bitchiness if it couldn’t verbally defend itself. “It’s two bloody syllables.”
Without much else left to do, he turned in his place and sat roughly against the second-to-last step of the stairs, heels digging into the mud and rain spattering his ankles. The wood porch covering stuck out just far enough to prevent the rest of him from getting wet, but the cold was harsh enough as it was. “Fucking Malfoy,” Harry muttered under his breath as he pulled his jacket tighter around himself, curving his shoulders and battening down his hatches like a ship in the midst of a raging storm.
“Hey!” Harry tried again, stumbling as his feet landed on the cold wood floor. “Phoebe, you daft dog, wake up! Intruder!”
“Oh, isn’t it fascinating?” she gushed. “I had no idea Muggles knew so much about Hellenic polytheism.”
His lips thinned and he looked away. He was nervous. “I don’t know how to do this,” he admitted eventually, squinting against a slight brush of wind. Not looking at Draco.
“Owl?” inquired Lovegood after setting a blue card on the top of the towering pile in the center of the coffee table.
“Certainly not,” Pansy said seriously, then cracked a tiny, sly grin. “Even though that’s the biggest lie I’ve ever heard come out of your mouth.”
“That’s so fucking offensive,” Harry said seriously. “Half my wardrobe is made of corduroy, you prick.”
“Are we going the right way?” Draco asked, bending a rogue branch out of the way so it didn’t slap him in the face.
Potter’s face did the thing again; a dark, bashful shade of red bloomed across his cheeks and the bridge of his nose. He looked down at the table, twisting his mouth with apparent frustration. “Magic.”
The hike felt more like a stroll through the woods than anything else, and these woods happened to be lovely. There was a small gurgling stream cut into the ground parallel to the trail, a rotting wooden bridge that arched gracefully over said stream, and gold willow trees that bloomed plentiful and numerous around every corner. Draco was rather enjoying himself, in all honesty, even though he really tried not to. He didn’t want to give Greg or Theo the satisfaction of thinking this was a good idea.
“No,” Harry answered truthfully, trying to avoid staring at Draco by fixing his gaze into his jar, swirling the bitter gold liquid around the bottom. “You caught me.”
“We’re fine,” Ron assured, but there was an amused smile playing on his face, like he was trying not to laugh. “One of the barkeeps was coming onto Parkinson so ‘Mione told him she was her girlfriend.”
“Merlin,” Greg said, eyes fixed on the window, television program forgotten entirely. “Is Potter making a political move, too? He looks miserable.”
“Potter,” Draco said, sliding the panel up and peering down into the hazy darkness at the dark, windblown figure he would recognise anywhere. “What on Earth do you want?”
“It’s Saturday,” Draco interrupted. When Harry continued to stare at him, he rephrased: “Saturday dinner. The thing we’ve been doing for over a month.”
“Have you named the little ones yet?” Luna asked, changing the subject and breaking his train of thought. She was leaning back over the chicken coop, attention recaptured by the chattering baby birds. Since it was obvious that she wasn’t going to be pulled away from them anytime soon, Harry stood up from his rocking chair and brought Luna’s cabbage-shaped mug over to her so they wouldn’t have to strain their voices to talk.
Draco looked down at his cards, but couldn’t quite process what was on them given that Potter’s eyes were now pinned to him, burning invisible holes into the fabric of his jumper. “Um,” he said, blinking hard. “Pass?”
“I don’t care.” Draco popped the lid to the container of soup, swirling it around a few times before beginning to pour it into the pot. “You’ll get in my way. Go lie down, or read a book, or something. Go be a sick man.”
“I don’t,” Harry agreed. The Northern wedge of the property had been left largely untouched when he was doing renovations, and still it remained wild and overgrown with tangled weeds and sharp nettles. The trees over there were generally less plentiful, and the few apples Harry’d ever picked from them had ended up being overly sour and soggy in the middle. He assumed it was the fault of whoever had operated the farm before him—apple trees were delicate things that needed proper care, and if one was grown using the wrong methods, it wouldn’t provide well for years afterward. Harry had never grown a tree himself, but he’d read about growing them, and the ones in the North corner were duds, so he didn’t pay them any mind.
Draco didn’t normally believe in such things, but it was hard not to when he was living smack dab in the middle of a fairytale. It was especially hard not to when, fifteen minutes until two in the morning, something sharp pinged off of Draco’s bedroom window, and he knew exactly who had thrown it.
The clearing that surrounded the Slytherins’ house was quiet when Harry finally made it there, picking twigs off his sleeves and feeling the soft, damp soil spring beneath his soles. It was almost completely dark—only one light was on in the old, crooked house, the one on the top floor that Harry instinctively knew belonged to Draco.
