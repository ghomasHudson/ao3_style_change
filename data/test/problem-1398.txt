The perfect opportunity to use the coin presented itself on Friday.
Mr. Malfoy pointed to a door on the other side of the deck. "I'll bet that door takes you right through Sirius' room."
Harry hummed in response and took another sip of his tea. After a few minutes he said, "Honestly Astrid it's a long story, one I'm not a fan of reliving. I will tell you a couple of things about it though, ok?"
Macmillan hummed in response, putting a hand on the wall just over Draco’s shoulder. Draco looked up from the letter to say, “Macmillan, what the fuck are you doing? Did your parents not teach you personal space?”
“You can literally hear me fucking through the wall. How is that not shit?”
"I fought a lion," he answered easily, then gave Harry a little wink, as though they were sharing a secret.
“I can’t believe you let her do that,” Potter says.
-what about my question
Harry grimaced, looking down at his untouched meal.
After recovering from a bit of coughing he cleared his throat said, "Sorry. What were we talking about?" Draco looked at him as though this conversation was exhausting and Harry remembered, "Oh right, the kitchen. There aren't many rooms that are redone to be honest. The kitchen, my bedroom, and the garden patio, are the only places without something atrocious in them."
Malfoy manages to surprise her when he asks, "This dress is from the moonlight line, correct? Part of Lovegood's collection."
Anna didn't answer right away. She studied him for a long moment, vibrant hazel eyes searching his face. "Draco and Potter," she repeated slowly. "Alright, let's see. Do you have the basics?"
"You should, ya know, um, you should freshen up a bit," Neville's halted words only furthered Harry's confusion. Harry stared at him until Neville said, "Just have a go in the loo before you talk to anyone else."
Harry Potter for renovating the manor.”
More importantly, did it matter that this was one more thing the Drarry fandom had gotten right? How many was that now?
Harry was delighted and told her as much, he wished he could wrap her in a hug.
"I think Pansy is going to get us drunk."
The question threw her off, “Is who cute?”
“It would be safe to assume I had more questions,” she replied with a smile, though her cheeks were still pink.
Hermione smiled, and he knew she was closing in on a mental victory lap at being proven right. "Go on, tell me what his name means. I'll even give you something, I knew it meant dragon, I also know it's a constellation."
"No, it's not that, it's- um… It's fine. I'm fine with it," Neville said, then stuffed a spoonful of mashed potatoes into his mouth.
Then he heard, from the other side of the wall, a low moan. Then, "Oh God."
Harry cocked an eyebrow at her and she laughed. The sound of it, light and easy, diffused some of the tension in Harry's shoulders.
I solemnly swear my schedule for writing has greatly improved. The next Drarry adventure is completely mapped out so I will be able to stick to my word! Thank you for your love and patience. I hope you enjoyed this piece! Please leave me a comment if you want to make my day!!
Harry stared at the door leading to Sirius’ room. “Did those two seem off to you?”
Astrid took a deep breath, “I would like to know where to get my books for school. I want to start reading them as soon as possible. Dad said something about pointy hats and cloaks, should I order some of those from Etsy? He also said that you had a wand, where can I get mine? How do I get to the school? I can’t find any information about it online. Am I allowed to bring my laptop? Dad also said that you had an owl, will I get one of those? Does it have to be an owl or any animal?” she paused to take a breath.
Neville grinned back, "Feel free to share that more often if you're getting it free."
After Loire and Luna congratulated them on the work, they were assigned to take a week off-
“What did you do?” Neville asked.
Draco turns slowly from the door to face him, but he doesn’t look angry. In fact, Harry sees the beginnings of a smile on his lips. “Potter, do you have anything to say for yourself?”

“It’s like texting,” he said. “We use it instead of cell phones. Your phone will work here, but it won’t work at Hogwarts. My friends and I didn’t want our kids going to that school without a way to talk to us. So, we designed these bracelets for the family to be able to communicate.”

Harry eyed him wearily before deciding that he really didn't have anything to lose. The boy could already hear his thoughts, and nothing was going to be worse than what he'd done just a minute ago. Harry sat down on the couch, as far from Zabini as possible.
He opened the window and the owl swooped in to land on the table and let Harry untie the letter from his leg. Of course, it wasn't a letter. Once he opened the envelope, it was a postcard from the Weasley that slipped out. Harry spared a moment to scowl at the picture of himself before flipping it over.
Not to mention the Weasleys.
Draco's shaky hand reached for the biscuits. He took one and glanced up at her.
thought he looked
It was incredibly fucking distracting. Even just the balls of her feet pressing into his thigh as though she were a cat making soft bread pulled him from focus. Worst of all was Harry and Draco. Harry and the casual comments, ‘she’s just being nice’ or ‘you’re both too young to worry about it’ and ‘family should be affectionate.’ Versus Draco with his lifted eyebrow, ‘you have your hands full’ and ‘talk to your aunt.’
It was the right way to go because Harry smiled, "Honestly?" he asked before continuing without an answer, "Draco was a suspect in a case that I was assigned to."
George stood back, flashing Draco a feral smile. "Welcome to the back room," he said, motioning for Draco to step in.
Pansy turned to see them and the mud stopped moving, hanging in mid-air between her and the wall she was building. She turned back and lowered the mud carefully to the tarp-covered floor.
Harry debated, not wanting this
"He said he can fix us by Halloween."
“Did she?” Draco asked, as though it was old information. “You do look like you’re in need of a good fuck.”
She pursed her lips, "That, Potter, is a plaque for our room from Lovegood. She thrust it at me upon arrival, kissed me on the cheek and told me that she is happy for both of us."
She tucked into her food for a moment and took a drink of water. Then, looking back up at him, "Is it really that bad with the others that you have to avoid them and work with a death eater sympathist?"
Harry meets the sexy Wallbanger ❤️
The room snaps back into focus. His heartbeat is still thundering, but he finds he can breathe again. "Would you like to go to dinner?" he asks, as Draco's fingers grip his hips and push him back against the wall.
"Ok, now, describe your favorite food."
Hermione cast a far more efficient locking charm at the door before following Malfoy back to his lab. She watches him take a seat at the small desk in the room. His face is impassive, the way it’s been in every photo the press has snapped since he got back from France. She should know, she stayed up late last night researching the last few years of his life. Hermione removes her jacket before she sits down, revealing a long sleeve off the shoulder dress that falls to her knees. The dress is not tight and she knows it only shows off her curves if she moves a certain way, which she rarely does, leaving more than enough to the imagination. However, she finds most boys' eyes will linger on her exposed collar bone or exposed neck. She’s gotten better at playing the pretty girl since school and she’s hoping it will help her cause with Malfoy.
Harry gave Draco a considering look. He wasn't about to let
He heard Pansy from the other side, "Password?"
"I was kidding, Potter," Draco flashed him an easy smile. That was a thing Harry had seen him doing lately, smiling. Smiling at Harry. They crossed paths several times at the ministry.
“All right, here’s your room,” Harry heard the clerk say, and glanced up to see him showing a middle aged man into a dressing room two doors down from his own. Briefly, Harry watched the newcomers to see if they were affected by the sexual tension that was currently
Harry felt a blush start on his cheeks at Luna's words, "I don't… I just…" he fumbled. "Would you mind if I work with you?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I can't stop thinking about you," Potter growls, his fingers deftly undoing the buttons of Draco's shirt, faster now than that first night. "And when I'm with you, all I want to do is taste you."
Two days later, Blaise sat next to Potter in the infirmary. They were waiting for Slughorn to come in and administer the antidote to nullify the bond. Blaise couldn't wait for this part of his day to be over. Not just because he would
"Why does she get to call you Pansy?" he demanded. "I'm the one who spends all my free time with you in those dorms."
"Yes," he said, as though it were the easiest decision he'd ever made.
Draco braced himself above Harry on his elbows and kissed him eagerly. "Have you been with a man?" he asked.
https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Eaters
As they left the common room Harry could feel Zabini’s eyes on his back, making the hair on the back of his neck stand up.
"I have word that she will not be there forever. Until that change is in effect though, she still holds a lot of power at the Ministry," McGonagall paused, seeming to brace herself before the next statement. "She has made some decisions about your return to Hogwarts. We will need to comply with them until her position changes."
"Yes?"
The next morning, Harry got into it with Pansy about escorting her to breakfast. Eventually, Blaise and Draco showed up to their room, drawn by the shouting.
She pulled back and looked him over carefully, "Oh my. You have too many wrackspurts. Have you not been putting any honey in your morning fry up?"
“Speaking of which,” Blaise said, ignoring Draco again, “you need to keep your hands off of Potter until he’s no longer bonded to me. I nearly lost my head last night.”
He thought.
“I brought you this,” Potter says, dropping an ornate invitation onto Draco’s stack of scrolls.
When Pansy returns to her desk Draco says, "I wanted to make sure you liked the flowers."
Harry wasn't really sure how to answer that. He thought of Draco and the deal they had struck, "I think so," he said slowly.
I hope you're still love it 💚
Harry grimaced, "This is why Parkinson told me not to stare at your war scars."
Harry considered the idea that he might be a part of this talk she was wanting to have, and he felt his cheeks heat up again. His mind trailed him easily from thoughts of their future conversation to the one he was going to have to endure with Molly Weasley. He grimaced, and then, remembering about his face, tried to look as though he wasn't thinking at all.
she should never have encouraged him to be an auror. She lifts her wand and casts a

everyone."
"I can do this if you don't- I can't bury feelings for you if you keep-"
Blaise thought. He reasoned that Draco kept to a regimented schedule though. Maybe Potter was just observ-
Hermione had prepared for this. It’s not the reaction she was hoping for, as it will be more difficult to convince a man in full control of himself than it would be to convince a man distracted by her body. However, while deciding the best way to approach Malfoy, she had considered the fact that he had spent several years watching Pansy Parkinson work a room. The dress Hermione was currently wearing was chosen by Pansy during their first excursion to shopping in muggle London after Pansy had been hired as Hermione’s assistant at the Ministry. Their tentative friendship had blossomed over the last year and Pansy had proved to be a valuable asset, not only at work but as a confidant.
The wards let him in. The house knew him. What did this mean? Did Grimmauld Place recognize Draco as a master? Did he need to relinquish ownership? Would he want to?
Realization dawned in Blaise’s eyes, he stared at Harry for a moment, then turned the look on Draco, “I never thought I’d say this, but I think his jealousy rivals yours.”
Hermione’s blush is lovely, a pink bloom spreading across her cheeks, highlighting her freckles. She steps out of the doorway. “Of course, hello,” she says.
"Don't be upset," Harry said quickly, hoping to soothe her. He couldn't understand why she would be upset about Draco getting the credit, he deserved it. "He was brilliant, he had them all tied up by the time I got there. Didn't even need my help, really."
The blonde leans forward to brush his knuckles against Harry's bare chest. "Did you get started without me?"
1 this chapter is mostly smut :x
Harry thought.
Draco didn't look up during any of the proceedings, only seemed to be focused intently on his hands which were in his lap. The Wizengamot cleared him of all charges, pending a successful year at Hogwarts, continued community service through the restoration project, and mandatory monthly meetings with McGonagall.
She moved away and opened the door, then turned back to him and said, “Please don’t spend your weekend taking one-offs to bed. Do something productive with your time.”
Draco planted one more kiss and then stood, saying, "Come on. Let's get you a cup of tea to enjoy while I go take my shower."
It worked. All thoughts of the war vanished, replaced by thoughts of the dragon Potter had encountered in 4th year, a few stray thoughts about Charlie Weasley, and, oddly, a fleeting thought about Draco's name meaning dragon.
Scorpius offered what he hoped looked like a boyish smile, "You always say that some exposure before your first day would have helped you. Besides, she's your niece, don't you want to be around for the first chocolate frog card she gets?"
On the evening of July 31st, Harry left Hogwarts in a foul mood. His mind was fuming with dark thoughts about Dolores Umbridge. He briefly entertained the idea of heading straight to the ministry to pick a fight with her in person. Only, Harry didn't want to fight, at least not for awhile.
"Headmistress," Harry said from the floor, "What happened at the trial for Lucius?"
Harry groaned, throwing an arm over his face, "How is this happening? He's a guy. Why is he so fucking-" Harry cut himself off, afraid of what he might have said.
"You did not."
~~~💕~~~💕~~~
He glanced back up to find two blond Slytherins staring at him as though he were a fascinating creature they wanted to study.
Draco ran into the back of him, propelling Harry into the patio. "What is the matter with-" Draco closed his mouth, his lips making a thin line, then said, "Forget it, just sit down Potter before you hurt yourself.”
"How about you Ernie?" Harry asked.
"A bit too interested in corrupting my son?" Draco asked, though he did grant Harry a sly smile to take the bite out of the words.
Potter's thought cut through Blaise's mind.
Harry sighed. "Well that went well," he said to no one in particular.
Draco stood rooted to the spot, helpless to do anything but watch.
Harry thought, as loudly as possible, panicked at the thought that Zabini was going to tell Neville about Malfoy.
“Absolutely not. He’s a mess and I don’t have time-”
“Bite me.”
Draco turned his face so Harry planted another love bite on his neck instead, his breath catching when Draco pulled out his cock.
The sound broke through Harry's confused thoughts. He locked eyes with Draco and he realized the ding was his floo, it was a floocall.
"What?"
As Ron left the room, Harry couldn't help the rush of affection he felt for both of them.
“No,” Potter said with a grimace, “not down here. I convinced her to give me the counterspell and moved her to a room upstairs that has a view of the gardens.”
Draco had leaned forward and whispered softly, “Come back to my dressing room, Harry.” He gently bit down on Harry’s earlobe, and let his tongue flick against it. When Harry’s body shuddered and melted against Draco, with a barely held back moan, he was thrilled at the solid chest he sank into.
Harry was thrown by the directness of the question. He felt heat rise up the back of his neck and rubbed it with his free hand to try and stop the spread. “I mean, I haven’t thought about it.”
Hermione pulled Ron out of the room with Harry and Draco following. Harry whispered over to him, "Come for a walk with me Friday night? We can go to the lake."
Harry jumped up and grabbed them away from her. “No,” he said, putting them on the counter behind him, next to the stove. Turning back to her, he asked, “How am I ridiculous?”
"Are you wearing makeup?" Harry asked. Despite the makeup, Harry could still see a blush on her cheeks.
But he would have time for that later.
up to something, Hermione!" Harry said, feeling a bit desperate to defend himself.
the way Malfoy did.
“For my birthday,” Harry continues, letting the words tumble out. “Charlie Weasley set it up and told me how to activate it.”
Draco narrowed his eyes and said, "Your ice cream is melting."
, what if he got cornered by a muggle pretending to be a Ravenclaw? That would be worse, he’d probably end up in a heated argument and blow his cover. Maybe the muggle ones weren’t as keyed up to debate, though that didn’t seem likely.
"Harry, are you still coming for drinks?" Ginny asked.
"Nothing nefarious," Draco said, holding his hands up as if surrendering, though he was clearly trying not to laugh. "No need to overreact."
Draco and Harry managed nearly another hour together and 2 more glasses of Firewhiskey before Harry stuck his foot in his mouth.
"You said you wanted to do 7 minutes."
Please let me know what you think!!
Harry laughed, "Can I keep these?" he asked, holding up the letters.
2 after this is the last chapter.
Astrid felt her heart speed up as she read. She flipped back to the last section of the book and scanned the pages for Draco's name. She had just spotted it when her wrist went warm and she looked down to see a message from Harry.
Lisa grimaced, "She's fairly busy today, but I will ask, since you look as though you need it. And, of course, since you brought my favorite chocolates." she pointed her wand at a small speaker on her desk and watched it expectantly. Hermione had insisted, during her first month at the Ministry, that certain aspects of the office be upgraded. Magically charmed intercoms had been in the top ten changes she'd pushed through.
Potter hesitates, chewing on his bottom lip.
Narcissa regarded him for possibly several hours, though it was most likely a mere ten seconds, before she spoke. "And which Mr. Malfoy are you referring to when you say the feelings are clear cut, Harry?
Harry tilted his head, holding her gaze , "No," he said cautiously, "it was about getting caught snogging at the robe shop by one of the attendees."
"I begged you to tie me to the headboard and fuck me into the mattress." Harry licks his lips, straining to respect Charlie’s relationship rather than dropping to his knees right here in the crowded back room of the Leaky Caldron.
Emily’s eyes dropped slowly over him, lingering on the way his denims clung tightly to his waist. “I like the muggle clothes. The agency did a good job,” she said, meeting his eye, “you really do look just like him.”
“You have unconditional consent as long as I get off and you’re the one causing it.”
“It’s no bother,” Draco said. His cheeks were still flushed but he was able to meet Harry’s eye. “Mother says it’s retribution for her years of listening to me talk about you while in school.”
When Blaise came he had to bite down on the meat of his hand to keep himself quiet, while Neville sucked and licked until Blaise’s cock was too sensitive for any more pleasure. He reached down to grab Neville by the collar of his shirt and kiss him senseless.
“And your rooms?” She said, eyeing them with what looked like suspicion. “Are you intending to keep them?”
(See the end of the chapter for
. Harry thought, remembering his exploration into sub play when he had tried out muggle fetish club stateside. The Dom wasn’t really enough to keep Harry’s interest but the scene had been fun. After all, when you’re trying to play dominate over the vanquisher of Voldemort, you need something different than the standard.
Once Harry had successfully removed himself from Hagrid’s suffocating hug, and promised to come back to catch up before leaving, he walked the grounds from the hut to the castle and headed for Headmistress McGonagall’s office.
Kreacher served Draco first, setting his food down and giving a long winded introduction of himself. He told Draco they had met when Draco was barely two years old and said that Narcissa Black was the finest bred woman in the whole family.
“Next time we will go somewhere else, where I can hear you moan for me,” Neville said before he sank to his knees and tugged down Blaise’s trousers and boxers together.
Hermione holds her breath, she can't be the only one feeling the tension between them. Looking into his eyes with her hands clenched she fights the desire to drag him into her office and tear off both their clothes. She closes her eyes and repeats the thought like a mantra-
“I know that better than anyone,” Dean said, his eyes meeting Harry’s with a steady gaze. “I still have nightmares about that dungeon his family kept me in, but Malfoy isn’t his father. He tried to help me, and Luna, as much as he could.”
"Don't forget about the boxes in the spare bedroom," Hermione said as she pulled Harry into a goodbye hug.
Draco stepped out in a pair of low slung jeans and no shirt. The fresh lovebites Harry had left less than an hour ago stood out vibrantly on the pale skin of Draco's abdomen, not to mention a few more just above the hem of his denims. While staring, Harry was surprised to spot a tiny snitch tattoo on his left hip bone that he hadn't noticed before.
Draco chuckled then and said “Astoria, bluebirds,” his tone laced with strained patience.
It took less than 2 minutes for the bubbles to go from a pleasant coating to spilling over the edge of the tub and filling the balcony.
Astrid stared at him for a moment, she could see the scar now, she'd seen it before but it held new meaning after what she'd read. There sat Harry Potter who grew up with her Dad, who fought monsters and outsmarted dragons, head of a wizarding police force. And yet he blushed, and laughed, and hugged Scorpius with such raw tenderness, she couldn't help but recognize that he was only a man. Which meant, several years ago, while living through those stories, he'd only been boy.
"Thank you!" she said.
Draco grinned, "I know better than to insult the house elf in charge of my pour, Potter. Now get comfortable and I'll show you what he was talking about."
"No way," Daphne said. "If I see Hermione with her top off tonight then my sister will lose her shit on me."
he thought, opening the door.
"If you didn't want anyone to know then you should have gone to a muggle club, obviously," Pansy said. "If you go out often then I'm surprised it's taken this long for you to be outed."
"I just- I looked it up. I can't be curious? Besides, I only told Hermione about it because I thought it was amusing."
There's no way she isn't going to put this together. The girl is obsessed with that damn series! He really didn't want to obliviate her, she'd only been trying to help.
"Fuck, Draco," Harry panted the breathless words into the boys neck. Draco slipped a hand between them. He undid the button of Harry's trousers, then his own, and moved the boxers so that both of their cocks were against each other, skin on skin. Draco's long elegant fingers wrapped around them both and he began to pump his hand. Harry's mouth was captured for another kiss until he felt Draco's cum spill out of him and onto Harry's cock. It took almost nothing for Harry to cum then, his climax bursting forth, sending waves of pleasure through his body.
He didn't think about relationships or sex very often, actually. He was generally focused on his business and his spare time was spent with friends and family.
He glanced over at her, surprised she was willing to do this, and walked through the shop door. Ginny came around the counter upon seeing them. She wore a pale green summer dress with matching Converse. Harry had gifted her the shoes when he came out to her as gay. She'd rolled her eyes at the offer and told him that he was being ridiculous, said she couldn't be mad at him for the way he is. However, she did keep the shoes and seemed to wear them often.
“I might have heard a few rumors,” Hermione said.
Narcissa straightened up, brushing ash off of her pale blue robes. She looked better than Harry had ever seen her, her hair was plated down her back and she wore an emerald tear drop around her neck.
"My parents went to school with them. My Dad told me a few stories of playing quidditch against yours," Ernie said, and Harry gave him a soft smile.
"I might actually kill you for that stunt," Draco replied, stepping closer to him.
"She usually is."
“You know I have a no questions policy during this game, Blaise.”
"No, I know that," Ron rushed to reassure him, "I know. It's just," he trailed off.
Draco's finger slipped in between Harry's cheeks, and, lube slicked, it didn't take long for him to breach Harry and push inside. "Relax baby," Draco said, his voice gruff and low in Harry's ear.
“But?” Harry could tell there was a ‘but’ from her the way she chewed at her bottom lip. It reminded him of what she’d said about Cho, how people can feel more than one thing at a time.
Draco stared at the spot Macmillan had disapparated from, trying to decide how best to kill him and get away with it.
Pansy didn't lift her head and her words were muffled when she said, "Leave it Potter. I should have been more careful."
“Did you even find a shirt?” Astoria asked through the door. She sounded close enough to have her ear pressed to the wood.
"I really wish you would stop casually mentioning Pansy and the Weasleys. It makes it more difficult for me to pretend it's not happening."
Harry raised an eyebrow, “I’m letting you tie me up.”
Incredulous, Harry put his right hand on the desk, "She made me carve words into my skin!"
Thank you for the Kudos and comments, they fill me with love!
"It should come as no surprise that I'm not allowed to talk about it. No worries though, I don't need you for your mind."
Scorpius and Astrid headed toward the exit when Scorpius heard a suspiciously familiar voice. He tugged on her shirt and they went down a hallway to the left.
Potter shrugs and pulls back to look at Draco, "It's only a few months. If it will help her then yes, I'm ok with it."
Delores Umbridge walked into the room and all three of them froze.
Harry grabbed a bottle of Ogden's from his trunk and stuffed it into his schoolbag. "Ready Nev?"
Potter goes on speaking as if Draco hasn't interrupted. "but you're with another guy. What if this was a date?"
Pansy tore her eyes from Ginny, dropping her hand, to glare at him. Her hair bobbed around her cheeks from the sharp gesture. "I could give you a list of reasons, Potter," she replied bitterly. "Let's start with how she's not constantly insinuating that I'm trying to shag the Savior!"
"Headmistress," Draco said in return, taking a seat at one of the guest chairs when McGonagall sat down.
"Yeah, thanks." Whatever these three were up to didn't matter as long as he could help Draco more.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Pansy says, at the same time.
Draco hears the water shut off as he pulls on a Puddlemore t-shirt and slips into his shoes.
"Are you going to join me or not?" Draco glanced up from the paper to cock an eyebrow at Harry.
"Why would I do that? Didn't enough boys say your name over the summer?" Draco asked casually, with his head still laid back on the cloak. Harry wondered how he could think so clearly mid blowjob.
"I told you to stop taking bets from Ravenclaws," Harry said to Seamus when he was walking back to the pile of pillows he considered a seat.
If you're doing nanowrimo this year, I made a free workbook for Preptober!
Scorpius laughed, “
At his words, both Slytherins looked up. Zabini looked as though he couldn't be much bothered with Harry. Which was just fine, because Harry wasn't focused on him anyway. When Pansy lifted her face off of Zabini's chest and looked up, Harry could see a bruise blooming on her left cheekbone.
"Can we get dessert too?"
"No one is like Luna. You know that," Harry said, as he levitated a pile of stones to the back wall. "Each of my posse has their own style of annoying," he smirked and looked back at her, "so you'll have a lot of variety."
"Pansy?" Draco Malfoy's voice struck Harry so thoroughly that any hope for their conversation to continue died on the spot. He stood, feeling frozen the ground.
he thought. "No, I- I'm single."
Draco briefly considered the idea that his next move could land him in the infirmary, but with the way Potter was looking at him, eyes lust filled, he decided it would be worth the risk. He leaned forward, letting his breath ghost over his ear and said, "That depends, how much are you going to let me do?" Feeling Potter shiver, Draco let his hand fall to grip at the other boys waist, flexing his fingers against the robes. "How much do you want me to do?"
Anna cocked her head. "Is Teddy involved?"
Draco's sharp eyes searched Harry's face, looking for an answer to a question he hadn't asked. "I suppose it would be a good idea to get started on the list."
"Potter, if I wasn't already hunting other prey, I would definitely entertain the idea of seducing you."
Say hi on Instagram
Also, can we talk about how brilliant Narcissa Malfoy is? Her beauty, intensity, and flare for drama! I love having her in a story 💖
“I’m good Luna,” he said with a genuine smile.
She lifted the bag up, letting it hang between them. Blaise looked to Daphne for backup.
Harry cleared his throat, “Are you ready to head out?”
“You smell like apples,” Draco said, desperate for any distraction from the dizzying effect of his lifelong obsession being so close.
Harry thought, feeling the wall behind him vibrate again from the force.
"Thank you."
"Sorry," Potter said, "again." He chewed at his bottom lip. "That was clever though, the dragon thing."
"Granger is my friend and I want to know exactly what it is you two are doing with her before this all goes to shit and I end up buying her several pints of ice cream."
She turned back to Draco, her eyes searched his face before returning to the picture. “We are not able to bury thousands of stories shared on multiple sources across the internet. Even magic has its limits.”
"Yes yes. Just um… I just didn't want to miss you is all," he lied.
“You should use Draco to get back at Potter,” Daphne said.
As promised here is a new chapter! Technically I promised two new chapters this week and I am nearly done with the next one, so look for a late night update!
Hermione gave her a sad smile, "You're welcome," she said.
With that, she was out the door and had it closed behind her. Harry took solace in the thought of completely ignoring her parting remark as he walked back into the kitchen to find Draco sitting at his  table with a pile of letters in front of him. Harry recognized them as the owls he’d received that morning, and mentally kicked himself for leaving him alone.
Boot finished pretending to be busy and looked up at Draco. “I assume you’re here in response to the email I sent?”
“You call her Luna now?”
Blaise thought, but he couldn’t make out anything Seamus was saying.
She smiled, putting out a hand. “I’m Anna, I don’t think I ever got your real name.”
"Are they dating yet?" Pansy asked.
Harry smiled.
“Malfoy.”
Behind them, Pansy cleared her throat. Both boys turned to look at her and each of them received a pointed glare. Draco scoffed in response. Harry quickly looked away, only to be met with the sight of Luna coming out to meet them.
The next chapter will be longer!
“I’m going to fuck you on that desk.”
Harry stumbled through the fireplace with Orion tucked into his arms. After what just happened, he couldn’t risk the kitten getting out again. Once he got his bearings Harry put Orion on the floor so he was free to explore, accepted a cup of tea from Neville, and sat in the comfy overstuffed chair in the drawing room.
Draco did. But it was only for really big, Dark Lord following, kind of mistakes.
Draco walked down to level -4 and headed straight for Boot’s office. He knocked on the door and waited for it to open, reminding himself that he had worked very hard to get to this position and that he needed to remain calm. Even in the face of an insufferably smug coworker, he must hold composure. The door opened and Draco walked in, glancing around the office to make sure they were alone.
Neville was already at the door, staring down the hallway. He turned back to Harry and asked, "What were you thinking about when Blaise said he wanted to blindfold you?"
"Just noticing that you have all the subtlety of a 16-year-old girl. The two of you were giving me the exact same look while you were in line."
"I'm taking them both to dinner at The Hopping Pot."
Draco sees a flash of excitement in Potter's eyes, though his expression doesn't betray him. "Smell like who?" Potter asks, all false innocence.
“Do you remember me?” she asked, “I met you at the party a couple of nights ago.”
"Weasel-ly," Draco began, cleared his throat and started again. "Weasley," he said clearly, "I appreciate your part for the outcome of my trial."
"I guess you Gryffindors were too busy fighting the war to pick up party tricks," Pansy said, earning a reluctant grin from Potter.
“What gave you the idea?” She could hear people coming down the stairs to her left.
The smirk grew and she slanted those blue eyes on him, her head tilting only a fraction towards him, "Watch your sass, Gryffindor."
"Harry, I want to give you the opportunity to choose who you room with."
Ron narrowed his eyes, looking between them, "Yeah all right, add him to the list. I'll tell them the ferret lied to save us from the snake."
Harry smiled to himself, it was enjoyable to see Draco attempt to swallow his words. He watched as Draco took a sip from the fresh drink, leaving his lips shining from the whiskey. Harry took a drink of his own in an unconscious mimic.
“You knew that he lives there?”
Harry looked down at the paper and felt his shoulders tense as he tried to process through the anger, and regret he felt for being outed so publicly, coupled with the awkward sensation of feeling no shame for the act, but a cascade of embarrassment at having to discuss this with his professors. He looked back to the Headmistress, "She can't do this! I can't be punished for being bent!" Harry caught the smirk on Professor Loire's face and sent her a scowl. She didn't seem bothered.
How the hell was he going to make it through this night?
Harry set his tea on the coffee table so he could put his face in his hands. He couldn’t look people in the eye
Draco rolls his eyes. "How do you think you're going to feel when I'm at dinner with her? On a
“Hey.”
"No! Don't answer that," Draco said, grabbing Potter's forearm before he answered her. "Ok, bye Anna."
Zabini looked at the floor and then sighed, "Sorry Pans, but Draco's still down there." He glanced back to Harry, "In front of the Charms classroom."
“Yes, please,” Draco took one and tugged it off the string.
"Fuck," Harry said, dropping his broom to the ground in favor of gripping Draco's cashmere robes.
Harry blurted.
She shook it and said, "Yes, of course. I'm Professor Loire. I'll be your new DADA professor," and dropped his hand.
Harry stared, dumbfounded, "What are you on about?"
Next, Blaise let Neville catch him appreciating the way Neville's flannel pajama pants slung low on his hips before he asked Draco a question. "Draco?"
Unfortunately, Draco beat him to it. Leaning around Harry to look at Ron, he asked, "Does her girlfriend know you're taking her on a date?"
The next morning Harry used magic to unpack the kitchen and bathroom, as Molly had told him that these rooms were the most essential to unpack first. He built a new bookcase by hand, but set the books to file themselves on the shelves alphabetically. He ate leftover pizza and looked over the blueprints he'd been working on for a new client. The last thing he did for the night was hang a large canvas print above his bed, using nails and a hammer. He wanted to do at least a few things the Muggle way, since he was in this flat. Luna had gotten the canvas for him during Christmas last year, it was a photograph of the first building he’d ever worked on renovating, outside of Hogwarts. In the corner of the photo print Luna had written
Harry felt heat spread through his chest and up his face as he watched Draco’s movements. He cleared his throat and looked down at his fans, attackers, whatever. “Yeah, I guess we’re even,” he supplied weakly.
Hermione lifts her chin, “Yes.”
"Let's assume I don't know them."
Draco pushed lightly off the wall and took a step back, looking Harry up and down. "I won't be like those boys in the club, dropping to their knees for a chance with the Savior."
he knew it was a futile hope. He let his mind wander as the rope was moved, and the other end securely tied to Draco's headboard.
- Neville Longbottom, Draco Malfoy, Dean Thomas, Harry Potter
Challenge flashed in Potter's eyes. Merlin. Draco was right, Potter did have very green eyes. "Don't you think that would have happened by now if it was going to?" Potter replied.
When Draco’s teeth sank into the skin above his hip bone, it was all he could do not to cry out for the sharpness of it, for how close it was to Draco’s mouth on his cock. When Draco put his lips to the head of Harry’s cock and licked the precum, Harry's knees nearly gave way. Draco must have sensed it because his hands came up to grip Harry’s thighs, holding him steady. Without thinking, Harry thrust gently, pleadingly, upward, brushing against Draco’s lips while his hands threaded through that soft blonde hair. When he sank into Draco’s mouth the wet heat was like nothing he’d ever felt, and was only surpassed when Draco’s head started to bob, his cheeks hollowing from the suction.
"You do not call me by my given name," she said. "And you certainly don't indicate that I am coercing you into staying late with me!"
"Look, I know  it's probably a shock, or seems crazy to you, but I really like him. Not just for a distraction, I'm not using him," he said.
"Not that I owe you an explanation," Draco spoke in clipped tones, "but I spent a couple of weeks with her and Rosmerta before the trials. That's as much as I'm telling you." He lifted his chin, "Now get out of my way before I'm forced to hex you."
“Malfoy.”
Lucius grabbed his arm, stopping him from leaving, and said, “You insolent brat, your crudeness isn’t doing you any favors. Don’t you know that I can take him away from you? He’s my son, and I will never be willing to let you have him.”
“You know me. As long as it’s consenting adults, I don’t think it’s immoral. Gemini’s business plan is genius. It’s not like they use polyjuice." He shrugs, drinking down another swig from his bottle. "From what I understand they hire people who look somewhat similar, and cast any necessary glamors.”
Once it was scheduled, McGonagall, Harry and Draco, all agreed to meet Draco's parents outside of Kingsley's office at 650pm.
"Good morning ladies."
Draco turned to leave, trying to hide his embarrassment as George followed, still listing off products. "We also have riding crops, and potions that come very close to poly juice."
“Yes,” Pansy lifts her chin, “and I think I’m falling in love with her.”
"Blaise is doing a good job with his business," Draco says through a chuckle. "That guy looked surprisingly similar to me."
The dining hall was the only time that 8th-year students were allowed to sit with their original house. When Harry had realized that he’d very nearly written McGonagall a personal thank you note. It was nice to sit with the same people he'd sat with for 6 years. Especially for Hermione, the only returning Gryffindor girl from their year. Unless you counted Romilda Vane, which Harry did not. He was confident that she was a Slytherin.
“Draco, your parents are already in negotiations for Astoria. Don’t do anything stupid.”
"Mr. Potter, you are not being punished," McGonagall replied.
“Potter,” Draco replies with the same even tone.
Draco chuckled, drawing his attention back. Draco lifted his chin and gave Harry a haughty smirk. "Guess you'll have to go looking elsewhere."
"Of course," Blaise replied, keeping his tone level. He had noticed that Potter and Draco were always watching each other, they had been since first year. They still bickered all the time, though no hexes were thrown anymore. Until now, Blaise hadn't thought much of it, other than to note that it seemed to help Draco feel more like himself.
Don't forget, you can always say hi on Instagram @dracos.tealsuit
"This is my coworker," Draco said.
Troublemaker.
Harry straightened up in his seat. A party? That was nothing. “I’m sorry Headmistress, but a party, one that encourages connections between different houses, surely can’t have been that bad.”
“Yes,” she said, her eyes dancing now. Draco’s stomach swooped at the sight, feeling like he might actually live to regret ever bringing this to her.
"Come on boys," Dad said, completely unaware of his constant ability to
"Look," Potter said, once they were in the hallway with the door shut, "I panicked earlier when I thought you were going to tell Neville about- about what we were discussing."
"Don't be. Everything down there is beautiful. It's the prettiest wedding I've ever seen."
Pansy shrugged and looked back down at the plans, "Your friends come back, and we won't have a project to work on. It'll just be different."
"It is bad with the others. You wouldn't believe it if I told you. I can't go anywhere or do anything. If it wasn't for muggle cl-" Harry stopped and looked away. "Anyway, working with you isn't so bad."

“Thank you!”
Hermione plasters on the smile she’s been flaunting for the last two weeks, since the break up. “Of course I'm ok."
"OK Harry, the door's open," Hermione said, and Harry hurried towards her office.
“I need to try some of your dessert, it’s a different flavor than mine,” she said, with complete sincerity.
Harry huffed a laugh, "It is my name, though."
Lucius looked as if he might get sick right on the floor, but he didn’t look away.
McGonagall pursed her lips.
Draco hummed a response and Harry felt the adrenaline coursing through him shift from anger to arousal. His body shook with desire as he realized they were truly alone in the classroom. He looked up at the blonde with a feral smile, "Speaking of," he said, stalking towards him.
When Harry met his eye again, Draco said, "What’s on your mind, Potter."
Blaise grabbed at Neville’s shirt, hauling him forward and kissed Neville with the desperate need dominating his body. He poured everything he could into the kiss, and when he heard a pleased moan from Neville, his cock twitched in approval. Neville took control of the kiss, sucking in Blaise’s bottom lip to bite gently before he pulled back and trailed kisses along Blaise’s jawline.
Wednesday evening he collected the needed groceries for Poulet Vallée D'auge. He wanted to make something really special to celebrate with Hermione, and Fluer had personally taught him how to make this dish.
“No. I chose that shit apartment because I knew it would horrify my father.”
"Relax Hermione," Ron said with his hand on her leg. He looked up at Harry, "What is it mate? Do you think Draco Malfoy is up to something again?"
"Pansy," Harry said, his voice sounding far away. "God, are you ok?" His hand gripped the door handle tightly.
She gave him a small smile, "You're correct, and you're welcome."
"What?!" Harry finally managed to squeak out. "I- what?!"
Pansy's eyebrows went up at that, "Obsession?"
Draco smirked, "Thank you."
Harry looked at Draco, panicked at the idea. He hated Umbridge but there was no telling what would happen to her at the manor. Draco didn't look concerned in the least, he just smirked and even had the nerve to wink.
Draco bit his lip and briefly turned away, seeming to regain composure. "What do you want right now, Harry?"
"Potter!"
Harry stepped into the room, "Morning Scorp," he said. Then seeing him in bed sans shirt he raised a questioning eyebrow at him.
“I think,” Boot said, “this assignment is a joke. There’s nothing we can really do about the books at this point, except continuing to promote the idea that they are only works of fiction.”
He heard a whimper, a muffled petulant sound. Harry's magic started to whip about in his body and he took a deep breath to try and calm it, but the extra oxygen seemed to only fan the flame.
Harry groaned, "Oh no."
"Can you see my memories?" Potter asked when they were alone.
Harry nipped at Draco's bottom lip before answering, pleading, "I want to bottom," and felt the way Draco's body shivered at the words.
"Possibly, but not because of this" Harry said weakly.
"You wanted to talk about it," Draco said as he shifted a bit so his right arm slung across the back of his chair and crossed his long legs in front of him. He looked up to the right, "I remember hearing you kissed Chang in 5th year. Before that, it was reported that you had a thing with Granger."
Harry huffed a humorless laugh. “Some girl who won’t try to rig my food with love potion? Who won’t peep at me in the shower? Who won’t sniff my clothes or try to touch me…” He gagged on the last words ‘while I sleep’.
"Are you sure we can't just leave the country?" Harry asked, full of sincerity.
"How can I tell if the author is intending to have Draco and Potter get together?"
George looked up with quirked lips, put his hand on Harry's shoulder and said, "Yeah mate, obviously."
"That guy
Harry and Dudley seemed to know when they were beaten. They said 'ok' at the same time.
The moment they walked out of Gringotts Harry was attacked with a hug. He didn’t panic though, because he immediately recognized the blonde hair in his face as Luna Lovegood.
"Can I see you again?" the first man said.
“What?” Harry said, “No! I have things I’m doing today. You can’t just-”
Harry leaned against the wall taking several deep breaths before returning to the room with Hermione and Ron.
"Astoria, this is Harry Potter," Draco said, with another easy smile. Then, motioning to his bride-to-be with a glance at Harry, "and this is Astoria, my fiance."
then cast a stinging hex at her. "I told you it was an accident!"
George walked them through the entryway and up a flight of stairs to a bookcase. He ran his fingers along the spines of several books before stopping at
Harry looked down at what was indeed a mess of melting ice cream. He licked it up quickly, wondering if Draco was enjoying the show as much as Harry had. Based on the smile Harry could see, Draco was at least amused.
"Because Malfoy likes apples. Green apples, not golden, obviously."
"Who did you pick?" Harry asks, though he's pretty sure he knows the answer.
"He used to live in this ridiculous mansion called Malfoy Manor. Very posh, marble everything," he waved a hand dismissively, "you get the idea. Anyway, during the war a lot of awful shit happened there. The Christmas after the war Draco and his Father got into a major row about Draco getting married to a pure-blood, producing an heir, working in politics, and rebuilding the family name. Draco-"
Let me know what you think! Next chapter will intro Teddy 💕
Draco's chuckle rumbled through both of them before he captured Harry's lips in a promising, filthy kiss.
Blaise was certain she would have been more upset with them if she'd found out any other time. However, she was preoccupied with three 5th year students explaining what happened. With bright eyes and slumped shoulders, they told her about the experimental potion they had spilled all over Blaise and Potter while they were leaving the potions classroom. They claimed that the bonding potion combined veritaserum with legilimency and had been intended for extra credit, but it didn't matter.
Harry narrowed his eyes suspiciously "That's ridiculous, you've been happily tormenting me since I was eleven."
"At choosing ties, of course," Draco replied, then bit his lip, holding back a smile, as though he'd told a joke.
"No. No, it's not like that. I mean-" he looked down and took a swallow of lager, "she said I was none to subtle when I'd seen Pansy in the office a week before that."
then cast
Potter looked up eyeing Blaise wearily before offering a curt nod. Blaise gave a friendly smile, the same one he used to use on Seamus at the beginning of term. Potter stood and left the room, motioning for Blaise to follow him.
Harry looks down at the shiny coin in his hand, closing his fist around it. “I said I was thinking of Malfoy, that I wanted him to bruise my throat with his cock.”
So, Harry had stopped trying to talk about them and instead, chose to lavish affection on Draco's chest with his lips and fingers. Which he tried to do during the shower, but it turned out, Draco was serious about the speed of their shower. So they were both dressed and ready to leave at the same time as Pansy.
"I think I like both, actually," Draco said defiantly.
"Luna and I just bought a load of sweets off the cart," Ginny said. "We were hoping you'd come enjoy them with us?"
. He chided himself.
Draco managed to turn the doorknob he pressed against and Harry pushed him roughly into the room. Harry started to tug at Draco’s endless buttons, desperate for skin to skin contact, while covering him with bruising kisses. Draco bucked his hips at the perfect angle for his erection to stroke against Harry’s, causing Harry’s knees to buckle, and bat his hand away before Harry ripped the buttons off.
On June 24th, a week before the trials, Harry and Pansy started on building the separate dorm rooms. They spent the morning drawing up plans and arguing over the importance of closet space but agreeing on giving each room its own bathroom. Luna had informed them it would be two to a room and which dimensions had been approved by the board.
"Hey!" Harry said.
Astrid tilted her head, causing red curls to fall over her shoulder, “Oh,” she said, closing her book and walking over to him. “Well, this should be interesting. I didn’t know I could get mail here. Let’s go open it,” she slipped her hand into his and pulled him over to the stairs. Despite feeling anxious, he smiled.
Astrid agreed and tore open the envelope. Five invitations spilled onto the table:
She looked up from her book and smiled, “Morning,” she said. “Did you come to help?”
Harry gave her a nod, sitting as well. "It's nice to see you again. I'm sorry it has to be done under these circumstances."
When Draco returned from his morning shower Blaise had just started to button up his shirt. He glanced up to catch Draco's eye.
"Where is Pansy?" she demanded.
“Pansy, what’s the matter? Whatever it is, you can tell me.” This is true. He’s not just saying it to coerce her, he is fiercely loyal to Pansy regardless of what she’s done.
The words of praise spread through Harry the way they always did and he felt a flush invade his face. He chided himself for blushing so easily. Of all the kinks he could have developed as a teenager, why did it have to be praise?
Hermione POV
:          Draco Malfoy
Adrenaline still kicking, Harry kept his wand in his hand and followed the wolf out of the kitchen. He glanced back over his shoulder, looking at Draco. "You might as well come help, he’s your cousin."
"Are you always this fast?" Harry asked, as the two of them leaned on each other catching their breath.
"Mr. Potter is here to see you."
Narcissa turned to her son, "Do you feel the same way, Draco."
Harry's eyes snapped up, "No! No, I just…. Well maybe. I mean he tends to… Ya know."
"Oh, give me a break. Stop acting like you hate me. We both know you don't," Harry replied. He tried to think of what to say that might get her to let him through, but he wasn't coming up with anything.
"With Tim?"
Astrid blushed, glancing briefly Scorpius who purposely bumped the table in front of him, causing Teddy’s pumpkin juice to shake and spill out of the cup onto the
"I'm going to assume you know better than to trust a well timed photograph." Harry didn't need to ask about Scorpius' mum, he'd heard enough from Albus to know the marriage had been a pureblood fulfillment. Astoria Malfoy, who had kept the name, lived in France. She only saw Scorpius for two weeks a year.
Harry heard her walk away and looked back down at Draco. Confused, he whispered the question, “What just happened?”
Ron turned desperate eyes on Hermione, "This is our fault. We've been ignoring him. We were gone all summer and that snake-"
Potter tossed back his head and laughed, a wild thing that caught Draco off guard. "There's no way I'm having that conversation with you, Malfoy."
"I can't fancy Malfoy," Harry whispered, "he's- he was a bully, he was a death eater."
"How much longer?" Potter grit out the words, as his body started to tremble.
"You do realize that you didn't actually tell me what's going on right? You just asked me more questions."
This is a lot of fluff. Even for me. I hope you enjoy it!!
Draco looked angry, his body tense with narrowed eyes, but there was something else there too.
Draco guides him onto the desk, pushing off paperwork and a mug full of pens as he lays Harry down. "How long, Potter?"
article that had outed Harry. Photo Harry leaned into kiss the boy in front of him. On the back it read, '
Teddy didn't respond, just grinned and covered James' hand with his own. "The moon and the stars."
Luna furrowed her brow, "Oh Harry,” she said, her voice full of pity. “You should see them. A Merlin falcon could help you a lot, I think.”
Of course, Draco is not foolish enough to think he would stand a chance against two of the Black sisters and the woman who took out Aunt Bella. In the interest of self-preservation, and that is the only reason he allows himself, he opts to take his chances with Potter instead.
"Nope, I just came over to tell you that I will dismember you if I find out you hurt one of my best friends," Blaise said easily.
Kreacher disappeared and reappeared in record time with the drinks. Harry hadn’t realized that there was a special line of alcohol in the house, and, upon his first taste of the whiskey, decided that the Blacks were mostly horrible people who had very fine taste in liquor. This Firewhiskey was nothing like the rough burn he got from the pubs, it was smooth and warmed his body pleasantly.
Pansy tilted her head like a curious cat, "You aren't going to be a dick are you?" she asked with slow, careful words.
After dinner, Harry played a losing game of Wizard’s chess against Ron and then trampled him in a game of Exploding Snap. By the time he was ready to leave his cheeks hurt from smiling so much and he was once again thankful for the friendship they shared.
"Of course. You've helped us move twice now."
-are you wallbanging tonight? is that why you're going to be late?
“You were going to tell me something, in the hot tub, when I asked if you wanted to come back to my room.”
Draco lifted an eyebrow, a ghost of a smirk on his lips, "We'll see," he said, and backed away.
Harry stared at the two men in Draco’s room, taking in the scene.
“Excuse the mess,” Neville said, “we were looking for new trends.”
to offer it!" McGonagall spat the words at Umbridge. Harry remembered when his Headmistress had told him to keep his temper with Umbridge in 5th year, and how both of them had failed miserably. The woman just brought out the worst in people.
Hermione gave him a disapproving look and cast
"I don't want to date him," Blaise said, with a quick mental check on his occlumancy walls. He didn't need any of this getting to Potter.
Dark eyeliner girl walked over to him. “Hi,” she said, pulling Draco from his thoughts.  "You did a great job tonight.”
*Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows (I’m putting this here to assign credit to JKR. If you are reading this, and you didn’t know -immediately- what book that was from, you should go back and read ALL of Harry Potter before anymore fanfiction)
She was quiet for a moment and then said, "I know you don't take gratitude well, but, thank you for wanting to help me tonight."
Harry offered a smile, "Should I buy all of them?"
Ok, let's be real, it started when they were eleven.
“What are you lot talking about?”
“Everything all right?”
“Thank you,” Luna said, “I will see you at the Weasley shop.”
Draco turns to face him, “I want to know what the goal is here.”
“You know, just, use Draco to open his eyes. Make Draco do things that will,” Daphne paused to meet his eye with a playful smirk, “spark certain ideas.”
Draco turned around to see that they were standing in front of his favorite coffee shop.
"Pansy-"
Pansy slowly looked her up and down, the way Ron Weasley looked at pie covered in whipped cream. It made Harry very uncomfortable.
"Potter?"
Please let me know what you think in the comments!! They are highly motivating :)
Lucius smiled, somehow affecting a gracious cruelty in the expression usually meant for happiness, "Please do. In the meantime, I can be assured that Draco is safe at Hogwarts and this woman will be removed from your employ?"
, Blaise thought. His cock already starting to thicken while images of other things Neville's mouth could be used for flooded his mind.
"Hello, Harry," Hermione said, her hands gripped his biceps with a friendly squeeze. "You look knackered."
"Hi. Can I get you anything else?" Anna asked, eyes on Draco. He gave her a small smile and shook his head no.
She's a square."
"Oh they told me," she said, with a huff of annoyance. "I can't believe you're letting them do this!"
Kreacher moved past the two of them and set their mugs on the little table. He then turned back to Harry, "Kreacher is making things more comfortable for Harry Potter to see the stars." He pointed up at the roof of the patio.
Harry took it and read the title.
"Malfoy?" Harry squeaked out, "You think I fancy Malfoy?"
Harry nearly felt himself wince at the question. “I was in the hallway looking for Orion. He came into the hallway and we saw each other,” he replied. “He was in dragonhide boots, Neville.”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, "What's happening here, Potter?"
"Why would she be worried about that?" Zabini asked. "Surely she knows the Slytherins-"
Neville had brought in Blaise Zabini for interior design in late 1999, when Harry was only in his third project. Working with Harry had bolstered the Slytherins reputation substantially and, after a year, Blaise set up an office in central London for interior design. He always put Harry's projects at the top of his list though, and now that they had 4 joint projects under their belt, Harry trusted Blaise's opinion without question.
"I trust that all of the students are back safely from Hogsmeade?" McGonagall said.
"Hi Pans," Luna said, beaming at her.
"What are you doing?" he asked from the door as Astrid pushed gently on the back wall of the wardrobe.
Harry snapped out of his shock, put everything down on the table and pulled Hermione up for a tight hug. "I'm so proud of you," he whispered in her ear.
Teddy grinned, squeezing James’ hand before he dropped it. “The entrance is a bit narrow, but it widens up after that to full height.”
As they went back down the stairs Potter said, "I thought I told you to get rid of those."
life?"
"She can't be serious." Draco pulled out his wand and cast a
Pansy's brow knit down in confusion as she watched Harry closely. "Be there in a minute," she called back. She turned back to Harry, still studying him. "What's with you?"
They curl up on the couch sharing another languid kiss.
Harry stumbled into the new 8th year common room with Ron and Hermione close behind him. All three of them had run from a group of first years with wide eyes and pictures ripped out of the Prophet, begging for autographs.
Say hi (or yell at me) in the comments or on Instagram @dracos.tealsuit I love hearing from you!
“She can’t be serious,” Harry said, his voice coming out muffled and pleading through his hands.
Blaise had expected for Potter to be upset. He had not expected for Potter to retaliate, at least not the way he did.
He scoffed in response, “If you’re going to pout like that you should slump your shoulders a bit, right now your body language isn’t showing any defeat.” He slumped his shoulders forward and hung his head, then looked up at her through his lashes and said, “Please?” letting his voice break at the end of the word.
- Millicent Bulstrode, Romilda Vane, Pansy Parkinson, Padma Patil
"No," Hermione said, "of course not." She turned accusatory eyes on Blaise. "Are you doing that?"
"Don't be rude," Hermione said. Then, addressing the group, "I just worry about spin the bottle because you don't have consent."
"Did you get a chance to study for the project on Friday?" Hermione asked.
“Yes, I believe it is best for everyone.”
Potter lets out a bitter chuckle. "It's the real Malfoy. He has the worst timing. Just hang on, all right? I'll get rid of him."
"Because his thoughts are private," she said, "and they should stay that way."
“He’s not like this at Hogwarts, maybe it’s being around you?”
When the girl stepped up to Harry to shake his hand, Scorpius got a good look at her eyes. They were dual colored, one green and one blue, but more than that, they were curious. Intensely curious. He watched as she looked briefly up to Harry's face, then let her eyes flutter around, taking in as much information as she could before the handshake was over. In her left hand she was holding a Hogwarts letter, which she offered to Harry.
"Kreacher is knowing to bring the treacle tart," the elf replied, ears flat. Blaise couldn't tell if this elf hated Potter or loved him. He was never kind with his words, but he always did what Potter asked.
It didn't help that he was so fit, and honestly, the way he kissed! It was addictive. Hermione couldn't be held responsible for those intrusive thoughts about what else he could do with those lips, that tongue, his long nimble fingers gripping her hips to thrust-
On Thursday Harry forgot to bring lunch.
“So what was the final sentence for your Father?”
spells at the love bites. "Bloody fucking vampire." Though his thoughts were centered around how good Draco's teeth and lips had felt. He gave his reflection a guilty smile. Harry was thankful that Neville had seen him, rather than Ron or Hermione.
Harry glanced over Draco's shoulder and found a rather attractive blonde looking nervously at the pair of them. He seemed to be obediently waiting for Draco to come back. Harry felt his body heat up instantly and he tried to push down the wave of jealousy.
"How?"
Harry followed her over to the giant desk at the front of the classroom and sat down in the chair across from her. "Thank you," he said.
"Deal," he replied, a little too quickly. She realized he'd been expecting that, and his goal would be reached either way.
"You would just tell her?" Hermione asked, considering the idea. "Ok... I can do that."
"It worked Harry!" Hermione said, without preamble. "My parents know me again!"
Draco looked down at Harry's hand and then, slowly met his eye. "Is that really where you want to touch me during this interrogation of yours? I'm still scarred there you know," his words were cold and barely audible.
He would go to Muggle club to avoid running into any fans. Harry shuddered at the thought of them, with their fake lightening scars and cheesy glasses, and felt any desire to get laid die at the idea of sleeping with one of them.
“I should have moved with Mother to France,” he said, apparating to a side street near Waterstones.
Once they were inside Harry tapped at a bracelet, it was a broad strip of gold that was pressed flat and thin, covering 5 centimeters on his left wrist. She eyed it and then up at him expectantly, causing Harry to smile.
Hermione smiled, "Yes, well that's not really a secret either. I think it's time they shifted from rivalry to," she paused, brows furrowing, and turned to Harry. "Whatever this is going to become."
"Don't stop. That's-fuck."
"Oh." James never knew what to say when the topic of Remus Lupin came up. He couldn't imagine life without his dad. Or his mom, for that matter. It made him want to give Teddy a hug.
Confused, Harry cut in again, "It's about Draco Malfoy," he said.
Potter licks his lips and Draco can feel his cock get impossibly harder against Draco's thigh. "You're going to be on a date with the fresh scent of my cum on you then."
At first they both threw something easy, a tripping jinx, a
Pansy comes up behind them to hand Hermione a fresh drink. "The Chosen prat does have a nice ass. I can see why the two of you are always staring at him."
Draco drops his head into his hands. "Is that really what you got from that statement?" he asks, the words muffled through his hands.
Harry pulled off to look him in the eyes, "Draco," he said seriously, "you're a spoiled brat. If it ever comes to it, I'd wager you will be far more possessive over what's yours than I am."
"Hello Headmistress, I got your owl. Is everything ok?" he sat in front of her desk.
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Weasley asked.
“Sorry,” Harry said, “what exactly is a foam party?”
"If there is one thing I can teach you that will help you on your chosen career path," Draco replied, reading the note through again, "it's that Hermione Granger never does anything casually."
Harry huffed and fought not to glance at the students lined up against the back wall, many of whom were snickering.
“I can’t just let you go, Draco,” Harry had surprised himself when he heard the words come out of his mouth. He had meant to ease into it, rather than blurt them out two nights before their deal ended.
"You're awfully pretty to not pick the shag,
Harry glared at him, and then at Luna for good measure. “Don’t you think it’s possible i just need a full night's sleep?”
even this was not enough to shake his crush on Draco Malfoy. Though Harry's mind registered the girl's undeniable attraction, his magic was dismissive and his cock showed no interest.
With Draco's shirt slung over his arm, Blaise leaned against the wall and motioned for Draco to proceed. He fought the impulse to look at Potter again.
Harry started to panic, this was not good, this is not what he had meant when he said they should get along. He tried to think of something to say, but that was rather hard, seeing as Dudley was such a shit and Harry had stupidly confessed to both of them about his cousin.
They stood for a moment, Draco collapsed against him, Harry collapsed against the wall, until their breathing slowed. Eventually, the haze of his orgasm cleared enough for him to think again. He carefully turned Harry back around to give him a deep kiss. “Clean us up so we can go.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry knew better than to try and take off Draco's shirt. He wasn't ready to face that yet. So he moved lower and tugged at Draco's trousers. Once they were unbuttoned he looked up and waited until Draco chuckled and said, "Gryffindors, I swear. Yes, I consent. Do you want me to sign something?"
Dudley huffed a laugh, “There’s no end to the list of questions with this one. You wouldn’t be able to answer them all by the time school starts, much less over a cuppa.”
When he opened them again Potter was staring at him. "Sorry. I didn't mean to make you think about all that."
Neville gave him a private smile, "Not for that. I just want to see you. We can find a hiding place after though, if you want to mess around."
Draco takes his eyes off of Harry and says, "What agency do you work for?"
"Merlin," Draco said in a whisper, "you're trying to ruin my life."
Harry scowled at the display which had a sign reading, '
Potter watches it a few times, color rising in his cheeks before he looks up at Draco. His eyes are dark, the green edged out by wide pupils. He walks over to crowd Draco against the counter, bracing his arms on either side of the blonde. Potter’s tongue peeks out to lick his lips just as they spread into a smile and he says, "It's a good picture of you."
“I think you should go for it mate,” Seamus said, cutting through the reverence. “It would be the perfect end to your story.” He flashed Harry a broad grin, “You’re the hero, Malfoy was the damsel in distress.”
Potter pulls Draco closer, wrapping his arms loosely around Draco's waist. "If you think I'm letting you go now, just because you're in some fake relationship, you must not have heard about how persistent I am."
"You're a wizard, Potter," he motioned to his own lap, "clearly you have no problems casting
"Please," he said, "call me Harry."
Harry flopped onto the bed, welcoming Orion when Luna brought the kitten over. Once they had tucked him in, Luna and Neville propped themselves on the bed.
When Harry got back to his apartment that night he put his mostly uneaten Curry in the fridge, grabbed a bottle of Ogdens and curled up on the couch with Orion. He pulled out his mobile and sent a text.
Malfoy tilted his head at the words, as though they couldn't possibly make sense, not replying. Eventually he turned towards the stairs muttering, "I've walked into a different dimension." Then, louder, "Come on Potter, let's get this train wreck started."
Dean and Seamus came into the room towards the end. Dean sat in the desk chair and Seamus laid across his bed, putting his head in Ginny's lap. Harry cast a curious glance at Dean but he didn't even seem bothered.
Blaise cocked an eyebrow, looking down at him. "Don't be sour or I'll relay all the thoughts you've had about
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry walked Draco to the club and stopped with him at the back door of Double, in the alleyway.
“Yeah,” Harry said softly.
“Oh, I do,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes. “You’re both ridiculous.” She moved to pull over the pile of letters that was still on the table.
“Apparently so.” Harry buried himself under the covers as the wall began to shake with a rhythmic banging, the giggling and moaning picking up again. Harry could hear the Wallbanger moan and was thankful for the covers when he felt his prick thickening at the sound.
-I just told my phone that I needed it
Harry blushed, but didn't look away.
Harry let his wrist relax in Draco’s hand, watching him closely as Draco made short work of tying him up.
Draco feels a cold shiver sweep through him. Had she seen Potter?
Draco drags him over to the desk, stripping both of them along the way. Harry's thankful for that, his head is nowhere near clear enough to handle the row of buttons on Draco's shirt.
Not to mention the
"You vile harpy!" Draco shouted and every piece of glass in the room shattered at once. Several pieces fell from the ceiling where Loire had allowed Neville to hang his air plants, which were kept in glass balls. When the shards hit the floor there were spots of blood on more than one piece.
Teddy wrapped his fingers around James’ wrist, pulling it down and lacing their fingers together again. “I was hoping the romantic setting would be obvious, even to a Potter,” he said, eyes on their joined hands. “But I suppose you need something more forward.”
"Yes, Professor," Harry replied, "There was a group of girls in the hallway that accosted me. No disrespect, but I'd think you would be able to tell that," he finished, motioning to the tear in his robe on the left sleeve.
The thought cut through the fog in Blaise's mind and kicked up a slew of memories about the Dark Lord, the war, and the final battle. Blaise shut his eyes, shoving the memories away.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand. When Harry looked at him, the boys eyes were clouded with fear. They both attempted to give weak but supportive smile to each other.
McGonagall gave a tight smile and sat down, followed by Loire. The three of them sat quietly for a moment, silence filling the room. Harry tugged at his school tie that was suddenly too tight around his neck. Professor Lorie remained relaxed and even a touch smug as if whatever was about to happen was of great amusement to her. Finally, McGonagall squared her shoulders and looked straight at Harry.
Pansy flashes him a saucy smirk. "You're a good friend. I'm going to buy you a glass of wine," she says before standing up to walk to the bar. The way the bartender is watching her, Draco doubts very much that she will have to actually pay for his drink, but it's a nice gesture.
Pansy looked up, her dark eyes searching the other girl's face, then said simply, "I would let her know."
Ron's face morphed instantly from disgust to delight. Harry didn't think he'd even seen Ron look this happy on Christmas morning.
Draco smiled brightly, “I think I’m going to take you right here.”
They had started this -this
“Kiss me.” Draco’s fingers threaded through the messy raven locks of Potter’s hair, pulling him into a needy kiss. It was a mind numbing experience. When Potter deepened the kiss it was all Draco could do to not offer up his body right there in the kitchen.
Blaise had watched curiously as this trio formed over the last couple of weeks, noting their friendly banter slipping into flirtatious only to be drawn back again. He'd made a bet with Pansy, just this morning, that the three of them would hook up before Christmas.
Potter’s thought came through a bit stronger than normal and Blaise made sure to strengthen his occlumancy walls. He needed to be careful with this, drinking wasn’t the smartest idea when it came to keeping any type of wall up.
When Harry left Ron and Hermione’s he decided to walk despite the late hour. He was always putting so much energy into his projects, he hadn’t made time to learn his new neighborhood. A block away from his apartment he looked up to see the sky filled with stars. Having never paid close attention in astronomy class he wasn't able to identify any of them. But he knew Sirius was up there somewhere.
Scorpius smiled back, but he could feel the smile was tight. He didn’t like this situation, this birthday invitation. There were too many variables. “We need you in the kitchen actually, there’s a letter for you.”
Harry blushed crimson, "No! No, I'm good." He turned to head down the stairs.
"Possessive brute."
Harry felt himself blush from the words and looked down at the floor. He carefully
“You’re right Draco,” Hermione closed the file and slid it back across the desk to Draco’s waiting hand. “The Unspeakable department is officially opening a case to determine the effects of fanfiction on one’s psyche. You will research the material, categorize the tags with comparison, and report back to me.”
"Right," Potter says, "You don't want to break character."
Caught off guard at having that smile directed at him, Draco moves to take a step back, but hesitates when Potter relents, motioning for Draco to step in. As soon as the door is closed, Potter casts a locking charm and a
"Yes," Draco said defiantly. He was more than prepared to die on this hill if he needed to.
Pansy laughed, "Tom actually. I take it that means you're not exclusive with him?"
"We will leave in half an hour," said the Headmistress, "until then, why don't the two of you show Mrs. Malfoy the new 8th year common room." seeing the dismissal for what it was, the three of them left McGonagall's office and headed to the common room.
"Because all of the reasons! No."
However, this story didn't start until four years after the war, when they were twenty-two. Let's catch you up.
His cheeks flamed and he promptly dropped the book on the floor.
Ron grinned, "I reckon I'm lucky more than anything."
"The most logical answer is bloodline magic. This house was built by my ancestors."
“How do you know that?” Neville asked, sounding a bit accusatory.
At least he wasn't in his converse.
“It’s a better room than my old one, much less Weasley in this one,” Blaise said, knowing Draco would feel better if Blaise made it seem like the room switch had been self-serving.
Harry didn't know what to say. He told himself to leave, but his body didn't move. He couldn't help but think about Ginny. He hadn't been entirely sure how he felt about the Ginny Pansy situation, but he knew he didn't want to see Ginny get hurt. Having walked in on this private moment he was quickly deciding that Pansy shouldn't be anywhere near Ginny.
But the words had been there, and they had been powerful too. Harry’s mind filled with the confessions they had both shared since Draco’s birthday. All the violent, sweet perfect words they had said.
The tension in Draco’s shoulders eased. He looked around the patio, as though seeing it for the first time. “I suppose we could-” he motioned to the hot tub, sitting there with steam rising into the crisp, cold night.
The knock comes again, followed by, "Potter! Open the door. I'm not going to stand out here all night."
"Royal Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, easily the most over the top posh flavor in all of London."
Draco pulled the dress shirt from the hanger, slipping it over his arm and around his back in one smooth motion. He casually looked up then, giving Harry a wink just before the sales clerk came back.
The moonlight made everything so bright in the gardens. James could see Teddy easily. His hair, magenta today, was soft, falling in an artful tousle over clear blue eyes. His cheeks dusted pink from the cold, air coming out visible in soft puffs. And his lips.
It was a
Pansy's hand was cool when she laid it over Harry’s wand hand. "Potter," she said softly. She gently pushed his hand down and the boy let it fall to his side. "I will finish the wall. You aren't helping anything here."
I loved this story and I hope you do too! <3
"Harry, how are you?" she whispered the question into his ear.
Probably, Draco was very good at dramatic readings of Prophet articles.
Ron looked down at the table, his shoulders slumped in defeat. Until Pansy broke in with, "Guess you two will have to wait till Ron's an auror and you can get away with it, then," earning her a broad grin from both Draco and Ron.
:        Hermione Granger
These house stereotypes are not my own, blame the unreliable narrator of this story :)
"Harry?" Ginny Weasley's voice called out.
Hermione walks into the Ministry atrium 20 minutes before an all-hands meeting with her staff. She's dressed in a stylized light grey pant-suit that hugs her ass and flares out over tall boots, providing an illusion that her legs are longer than they actually are. Pansy had gushed praise when Hermione bought the suit and insisted she pair it with a light pink blouse, stating, "It brings a copper sheen to those doe eyes you're sporting."
Blaise bit the inside of his cheek to stop himself from laughing. "Can you say it again? I want to get the pronunciation down."
Hermione smiled at him now, a full, unapologetic smile and said, “Harry, I love you. You defeated Voldemort, you’ll be fine. Now, I’m leaving and I will see you in a couple of weeks.”
His hand slides around the back of Hermione's neck and draws her closer, tilting her head up to meet his lips. Lips that, she is surprised to find, are soft and eager against her own. Her body curves into his without thought and Hermione's eyes flutter closed. Just as she deepens the kiss he pulls back to kiss her hand and say goodnight.
And they lived happily ever after <3
Draco decided to ignore him, this was too important to wait for another time.
his brain shouted. "I've read that green is distracting in the workplace, to bold for an interview," Harry managed.
When Draco looked back up, Harry thought he might actually take a punch to the face. Draco was furious.
“Yes Potter,” Draco said, standing and dusting off his robes. “Into the lion’s den we go.”
She was cut off by the sound of her name coming from behind Harry. He felt hope when he recognized the voice.
Draco’s eyes snapped up to meet his, disbelief written plainly on his face. Harry turned back to the lawyer and repeated, “I can’t be sure.” Then added, “There were a lot of people there and everyone was talking at once.”
Zabini looked at the chocolate while Harry kicked off his pants to put on denims. "A Gryffindor tried to douse you with a love potion?"
“Oh no, Potter, not your clothes. Do you happen to read the
"I can say no if I need to. It's just unlikely," Draco looked at the shop warily. He was quiet for awhile, then said, "I'm not sure about anyone else. I doubt Olivander will ever ask anything of me. Dean and I get on all right, but Luna is Luna. It's different."
Loire's body flew back and hit the barrier that Terry Boot was holding and the shimmering wall of magic vibrated from her impact. Before her body fully hit the ground she cast

Draco took a step forward, getting close enough to touch him, and said in lowered voice, "Sorry to say it Scarhead, but you're out of luck. I already pulled the hottest blonde in here, aside from myself, obviously."
By noon Harry had at least the living room unpacked and looking good enough for his 1pm meeting. Luna, Seamus, Dean, and Neville, showed up, filing in one at a time through his floo.
"You have a new job soon. You can date me instead, use that to upset your father."
Draco gasped at the contact, a hand falling to Harry's messy locks, and he whispered reverently, "I can't believe this is finally happening."
Harry received a letter from owl post on July 31st, 1998, before he’d even started making his morning cup of tea.
“Yes,” Blaise replied, breathless. “Anything, please.”
:      Thursday, March 13th, 2003 11:37am
After a quick stop at his flat to change into muggle clothes, Draco met Potter at an apparition point near the burger place. Draco wore denims,
"Yep," Potter said, "George said he will fully cooperate with you and that he won't turn you into a ferret."
“What’s up ‘Mione?” Harry asks, removing his gloves and tossing them into a bin.
Potter hums against Draco’s clavicle, he’s already undone three buttons on Draco’s black Oxford. “I didn’t come here for tea.”
understand, but it was obvious that he's completely daft for you! Go find him yourself and see if I’m wrong.”
While his dad went to check, James took the opportunity to lean into Teddy and whisper, "Do you want to hang out in my room for a bit, or are you going to bed?"
Harry's jaw dropped and he turned to stare at her profile in stunned silence. Her red hair was pulled up into a tight bun, allowing him to see the slightest smirk on her lips.
“No.” Pansy said.
“Always.”
"OK," Malfoy said, after looking back at Harry, "I'm not dreaming." He walked towards him and said, "Have you been obliviated or something?"
She eyed him for a moment and decided to pick her battles. "Where's Draco?"
“Why not?"
Also.... sorry the pictures are HUGE! I couldn't figure out how to make them smaller. *Update* I figured it out <3
"Go take your shower before you drive me insane," Harry said. He turned back to the blueprints because he can't say the next words without blushing, "and I beg you to fuck me."
“Why would I change?” Harry asked, looking down at his Weird Sisters t-shirt and denims.
The barest smile touched Draco's lips before he nodded.
They talked about the trip and Ron pushed his face in to tell Harry about the horrible spiders in Australia. Eventually, Hermione promised she would floocall again next week and they ended the call.
Once the goblins are gone and it's just the three of them, Pansy said, "Care to shed any light on what that contract was all about?"
"Draco," Harry ran a hand up Draco's bicep, "I have a hard time imagining anything casual with you."
Draco hears Potter burst out of the potion-supply closet as soon as the front door is closed again. Draco casts
"Sure," Harry shrugged, "if I don't want to answer I won't."
Blaise thought as Potter's thoughts crashed into him.
"Oh, yeah. No problem," Harry replied, trying to 'take it well'. "You know, it was mostly Draco, if I'm honest."
"Excuse me?" Harry asked, incredulous. He was very grateful he'd already swallowed his drink before hearing that question, as he would have undoubtedly spit it on the table.
Harry smiled affectionately at Scorpius, “He is smart,” he said.
He scowled at her, "Are you insane?" he demanded.
Once inside, Harry realized why Hermione had hesitated. Pansy Parkinson was perched on the corner of Hermione's desk, dressed as though she was pulled out of a wank fantasy for someone who preferred the 'business professional' look on a girl.  Each item of clothing was tailored to show her hourglass shape. The slit on her skirt rode high up her left thigh. The top was, technically, a proper button down Oxford, except for the neko cut out that put her curvy breasts on display. Had he seen her a few days earlier, Harry probably would have had a meltdown over the girl who offered him up to Voldemort. Luckily -
"What kind of game?" Hermione asked, her grip on his arm tightening.
“I-” Harry started, and then corrected, “we,” he awkwardly pet the cat that was now tucked into his chest, “live in 392. You- you’re my- our, um neighbor.”
"Where did all of this come from?"
When they reached the door to Kingsley's office the three Slytherins stepped aside so Harry could go in first. Harry knocked, and the door opened immediately. Once they were all seated around his desk Kingsley addressed Harry.
to say.
They both broke from the table in a dead run. Harry had the advantage since he knew where the fireplace was but Ginny was still calling his name, acting as a homing beacon for Draco. Harry dropped to his knees sliding in front of the fireplace and braced himself against the brick hearth.
please leave me a comment if you want to show me some love! Two more chapters of this story and then it's all over. This one has been a lot of fun to write 💕💕💕
Petunia glanced very briefly at Harry, then looked up at the staircase that was causing her to lean over her plate. She cleared her throat, and said, “This is fine Dudley.”
“The giggler has been getting done like this for the last three nights?” Luna asked delightedly, then slapped her hand over her mouth as more moaning laughter filtered through the wall.
"I think the one thing Draco has always wanted more than his father's attention was Potter's."
“Stop terrorizing your Father, Draco,” Narcissa said, still casually reviewing the plans. She looked up at Lucius and Draco, who appeared to be involved in some kind of stare down or holding a conversation through Legilimens, then turned her eyes to Harry.
“Harry?” Neville said his name gently.
Harry pulled out his "nice" jeans -dark with no holes and not too much wear- a button down burgundy shirt, and trainers. He got dressed, casually spelling his buttons closed, then went back to the kitchen to water his lone plant. Orion, who had been hopping from the counter to the kitchen table, ran over to inspect the water being poured into the soil. Harry smiled down affectionately and decided to forgive the kitten for keeping him up so late. He resolutely chose to not forgive the Wallbanger. Harry gave Orion a head rub, and started to gather his things from the bedroom. When he heard voices on the other side of the wall he set down his shoulder bag and moved closer, putting his ear against the drywall and listening.
"Pansy," Draco replied. "She took me to a muggle club last week and I met a pretty boy who was dressed like a homeless person." He shrugged, a sly smile on his lips, "Eventually, I was able to see past the clothes."
She sleeves her wand and turns to face Draco. "Start talking."
The stone was freezing cold, covered in a light dusting from the snow. James was pleased to see no steam rose from how fast the snow was zapping warmth from his sweaty palm.

Next update will be by end of day Sunday 👀
They Apparate directly into the living room of Potter's flat and Draco doesn't give him the chance to ruin anything by talking. He grabs the collar of Potter's worn leather jacket and tugs him in for a kiss. Potter is a very good kisser. He walks Draco back until he's pressed against the wall for support. Every fantasy Draco has had over the years is cast aside as second rate when compared to the real thing. Potter's kiss is heated and greedy, and his hands roam over Draco's body, hot as a brand, as though he can't decide where he wants to touch more.
Zabini looked at Harry then, searching his face. "Oh," he said, "I'm sorry, I assumed you were out, at least to Hermione. She's your best friend."
“No way,” Harry takes another swig from the bottle. “Anyone ordering the hero
“I’ve got you booked so I’ll see you in two weeks.” Harry heard the sub say. His neighbor must not have been in the room because Harry wasn’t able to hear any replies, only this side of the conversation.
Draco smirked, "Don't be sour just because you're still hard. All you have to do is be good and I will reward you eventually."
Blaise and Potter each took a vial and downed the contents. “Thank you professor,” Blaise said sliding off the bed.
"I'm going to
Both boys pulled up and out of the water, grabbing their clothes and heading to the door. Teddy turned, just before taking a step in, to look between Mr. Malfoy and Harry.
And really James would like to say for the record that he wasn't paying attention to it. That he was, of course, paying attention to the endless bubble situation. But that would be a lie.
Harry's smile changed to a grimace, "Noted."
"I don't want to take advantage," Neville said, slipping a finger through the belt loops on Blaise's trousers to pull him flush against Neville's own straining erection.
Harry's breathing stopped.
Harry had kissed him breathless afterwards, whispering the broken words, “We both survived.”
“What’s to do?” Blaise asked. “Draco is trying to keep his head down. The war changed him, he isn’t a bigot anymore. That’s one of the reasons he lives in a Muggle flat. I’m sure he won’t bother you. Just ignore him, Harry.”
If you like my fanfiction consider reading my original piece.
Seamus rubbed the back of his neck with one hand, his freckles more prominent now from the flush on his cheeks. He took a breath and spoke quickly this time. “Blaise and Dean want to swap rooms. Would you be all right with that?”
“Not really. Draco helped me put up some walls last night because I didn’t want you to have to deal with my thoughts today. Halloween is-” Potter runs a hand through his bird's nest and continues, “difficult.”
For all of his shyness, Neville was still the boy who led the DA into battle, and cut the head off of a giant snake. He was a Gryffindor through and through, and Blaise should have expected his boldness.
Anna jumped, looking up to see a customer.
" she said, drawing out the name, "are both involved in Teddy's life. Draco the cousin, Harry the godfather. When that happens, Teddy usually tells Harry about the good things Draco has been up to. This gives Draco an upper hand. Then the rest is handled by," she motioned to him, "how attractive he is and the unresolved sexual tension they've both experienced since school."
When the Gryffindors got back from Quidditch Blaise was sitting on his bed next to the window. Ernie Macmillan and Terry Boot were in the common room studying with Hannah Abbott so Blaise was alone when Seamus Finnigan came in. As predicted, he was followed closely by Dean Thomas and Ginny Weasley.
"Don't worry, Potter," Draco said easily, "I already thought of something him and I might have in common." He leaned forward and bit gently at Harry's neck, "Now come take a shower with me before Pansy wakes up."
"Sirius," James said.
Pansy reached into her bag, pulling out a handful of, what appeared to be, colorful magazines. She attempted to hand them over to Hermione, who made no move to take them. Instead, Astoria took the stack and started to rifle through them.
"But you haven't seen the lube," George said, "Or the dildos!"
Draco steps forward into Harry's personal space, revealing himself to the man in the hallway.
Ginny's words came back to him,
“You’re right,” Hermione said, drawing Draco’s attention back to her, “Harry is unobservant, except when it comes to his work, or,” she paused, a smile tugging her lips, “other obsessions.”
Potter sat across from him, leaned back with his ankle set on top of his knee. He'd insisted on sitting with his back to the wall so he could survey the shop once Nora re-opened. The girl who'd been screaming had left once Nora went out and told her she wasn't allowed to loiter.
“Merlin, I’ve wanted you for so long,” he heard Neville breathe, the words choking on a gasp before Neville’s fingers deftly undid Blaise’s trousers. He leaned forward, letting a kiss swallow the sound of Blaise’s moan when Neville’s right hand slid down and brushed against Blaise’s straining erection, through his boxers.
and said, “Oh, I have to go meet the girls for study group.” She jumped up to pack her bag and gave Harry a quick side hug. “Just think about it, ok? Now’s the time for both of us to do a bit of exploring.”
He looked over at her, she was currently reading through a Charms book for 2nd years, curled onto the same couch as him. She sat sideways, her back against the tall armrest, the right side of her body pressed against the back of the couch with her feet propped against Scorpius’ left thigh. Since she’d taken his hand at Madam Malkin’s with no rebuff, Astrid had tested the boundaries of touching him and seemed to have come to the conclusion that she could touch Scorpius whenever the desire struck. He hadn’t done anything to stop her, nor had he touched back, other than accepting her hand. And touch she did. Nothing inappropriate, of course, but it did feel intimate. She would casually grab his hand, lay her head on his shoulder, touch his arm when she laughed, lay her head on his thigh.
"Soon," and with that he left the hall.
She gave him a quick smile. “All right, for tonight, please act as much like Draco Malfoy as possible. The people coming to this party paid for their tickets and they want a full Wizarding World experience. I assume you are familiar enough with the material to pull that off?”
makes its way through, but it's drowned out by the heat coming off of Potter. Draco's body is all too familiar with the dirty grind of a hook-up, and Potter's got a lot to offer. He finds his hands responding without conscious permission, snaking up the sides of Potter's t-shirt to feel the heated skin on the pads of his fingertips.
The panic that had crashed through Harry upon seeing the wolf abated some. Teddy had said no one was hurt and he was worried about getting into trouble. Whatever had happened couldn't have been that bad.
She looks nervous, and Draco is pretty confident that she must know what he’s going to say. Why else would she be acting so off? He decides to just get the words out and see what happens.
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise grabbed the bag and slung it over his shoulder. "Why are you doing this?"
Harry and Draco stared at him in silence, both in a state of shock.
The lust that bloomed in his chest, pumping through his body like blood. "Fuck," Blaise said to the empty room.
"Deadly serious. I told you I was going to make you beg."
"Could we use me?" Harry offered. "I could make a statement, try to convince them. I am
"Happy Birthday."
“Any of them,” Natalie said, curiosity lacing the words. She was 13, and never seemed to have any qualms with age or gender when it came to physical attraction.
“Shut up, Potter. We're negotiating,” Pansy said, her eyes trained on Hermione. “Granger,” she said, waiting for Hermione to look back at her, “when would this compensation happen?”
"All true, and all legal," George said, giving them both a broad grin. "I'm not giving them up either. You two are my biggest sellers."
“I know, that’s why I haven’t done it.” Draco slips a finger into the belt loop of her denims and tugs gently, so her thighs press against his. The heat from her body seep through the fabric. Hermione tilts up her chin, offering her lips to him and Draco nearly lets go of his control to kiss her. “We’re going to be late,” he says, backing away.
“What does that mean?” Harry asked, turning around only to be caught off guard by how beautiful Draco’s skin looked in the moonlight. He quickly averted his eyes, trying to remember why he’d been upset.
“Oh, you boys look good in my clothes!” the sales clerk’s saucy comment cut through Harry’s thoughts like a sharp blade and he closed his eyes, trying to slow his breathing. Draco didn’t move away, simply dropped his hands and greeted the man.
~~~💕~~~💕~~~
Draco huffed softly, "I could write several books on that topic, Potter. I imagine it would be quite profitable."
Next chapter is the end 💖
“So, I hired you an assistant.” She turned back to the door, calling, “Come in.”
"I noticed you still sleep in the common room most nights."
Draco hates every last gryffindor he's ever met. He tries to hold onto his anger but the weight of Potter's arms feels good on his hips. His body betrays him, leaning forward to get closer to Potter's warmth. "You need to go talk to her. Fix this."
When he opened his eyes, Potter was closer. "What can I do for you?" Potter asked.
Final chapter will be posted this week!
. Teddy grinned and spelled the paper dry. “I apologize,” he said, unrepentant, causing both Astrid and Scorpius to laugh, “Honestly, Astrid, I don’t suggest going by that name, it will only cause an uproar. People will know who you are either way, but with your own last name, you will be spared some of the press houndings.”
Draco was taken aback, surprised that he and Boot actually agreed on something. Perhaps coming to him was the right thing to do. Perhaps Draco would get out of this assignment on the grounds that it was a complete waste of time. “In that case-” Draco started, then stopped when Boot held up a hand.
Harry laughed again, "Not on your life, Parkinson."
“I’m not going to marry her. I already told my mother that I'm not doing that. My life is going to be hard enough with my choices over the last two years. I wont add a loveless marriage to the pot.”
“Blaise, I know you can be a bit oblivious,” Neville said, placing a hand on the other boy’s thigh, “but please trust me when I say that there is no circumstance in which Harry Potter can ignore Draco Malfoy.”
Ok. This chapter was pretty difficult to pull out of my brain but I finally got it written and tweaked for your pleasure!
"Please," Harry says again, letting his voice break on the word.
After Teddy put the wand down he let his arm come to rest along the edge. His fingers were so close to James’ shoulder James could feel the heat of them, despite the water.
“Anything?” Neville asked, all false innocence and smirking lips.
it made him want to give his
Kingsley eyed him for a moment, then glanced down at his desk when Lucius slid the folder across it.
"Harry," Ginny called after of him, "you should wear the cloak, there's a group of fans waiting to ambush you near the DADA class."
Harry casts a protection charm over both of them right before Draco spells lube onto his fingers. He spreads Harry's ass and his smile turns feral. "Fuck you're hot."
“I think I would kill my boss if it wasn’t for you,” the guy said, “You really know how to take the edge off.”
"I'm exhausted. I'm also sorry for interrupting?" he let the statement become more of a question at the end, hoping she wouldn't send him away even though she was clearly busy.
“Have you ever heard of this spell the girls want to use on me?” Potter asked, his leg bouncing up and down from the effort of waiting patiently.
“I guess it was Blaise really,” Seamus said.
Potter smiled, "You mean Teddy?"
The bird worked it's magic and Ron seemed to relax slightly. He still cast Harry a disbelieving look.
"I don't think so," Potter said, setting the fabric on a nearby table. "You can't take it off until you- until it's job is complete."
The canvas above him moved and Harry jumped up to catch it before it fell onto his head. He cast a strong wandless sticking charm to remount the picture more securely than the muggle nails. -speaking of mounting-
Teddy looked away, running a hand through his vibrant hair. “It means you’re much younger than me, you haven’t any experience with men, and if I fuck things up with you I will lose half my family.” He drew in a deep breath before continuing, “But I can’t lock it away anymore, I can’t ignore the way I feel about you and I can’t pretend to be so oblivious as to not see the way you look at me.”
Kreacher appeared with a crack, startling Harry enough to make him jump in his seat which screeched on the tile. Harry had repeatedly asked him to stop fucking doing that!
"Teddy?" James had whispered the name, but it came out loud in the silence of the dark tunnel. He stuffed his hands into his pockets, worried he might overstep and grab Teddy by the waist.
“That was completely different," Draco said, his chin tilting up in defiance, despite the tips of his ears going pink. "I haven’t done anything to him all year.”
A ghost of a smugness touched his features and the lawyer said, “Thank you for your time, all three of you.”
Hermione’s body didn’t merely still, it seemed to become an unmoving statue, except for her blinking eyes. “Thank you Malfoy,” she finally replied.
"Yeah. That makes sense," Harry said to hide his disappointment. "Let me know if you guys need anything for your research, ok?"
“It's
"You know Potter," Draco replied casually, "I've often wondered about that as well." He walked past Harry to follow Pansy into the house.
Saturday morning brought with it the yearly invitations to Narcissa Malfoy’s birthday gala. In the kitchen, Draco was explaining to Harry why they needed to buy
"Thank you Harry," she said, and hugged him back.
"She is smarter than you are, and far more capable of picking up on tells."
"Thank you. Will you agree?"
He did go out that night after seeing his friends. Two days later the

, he often listened to what they had to say. Or eavesdropped, as Hermione had insisted he call it in an effort to foster ‘honesty within one's mind.’
Astrid spent the next two days wishing for time to move faster. She begged her parents to let her go to Harry's house on Friday night instead of Saturday morning. Thursday afternoon Dudley text Harry requesting Astrid’s early arrival, she knew that she had a little over 24 hours to kill before she got more answers to her questions. She tried to do some research in preparation but it was starting to feel pointless. There wasn’t any information online about Hogwarts specifically, nor was there any easily located information about what she had heard Draco call the Wizarding World. She was able to link ideas from various fantasy stories together to gather enough information for the ever growing list of questions she was accumulating.
Draco turned his glare back to Hermione. "We have to do something about this. The muggles are running wild with this idea. I mean the tags alone- Hermione, there are
"Seriously? You basically got treacle tart?"
The girl from the car had finally reached them, "Dad, what's going on?" she asked.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, and Harry tried not to be charmed by it, "What are you doing out here Potter?"
Harry opened bleary eyes,
"Thank Merlin. I'm freaking out."
"Yes," Ron said, "It's bloody bizarre mate."
Final chapter should be out soon!!
Scorpius sighed and followed, keeping his eyes to the ground. When he turned the corner he was surprised to be looking at two sets of sneakers rather than just one. He looked up to see Astrid and Teddy straining to look into the room without getting caught. He tapped Teddy's shoulder and the boy leaned back to him.
Harry didn't get a chance to respond, interrupted by the ice cream server.
The words

Draco paused his buttoning to glance up at Blaise as though he was a prize idiot. “You realize, you’re also dating a gryffindor, right?”
"He looks delicious."
Harry pulled two shirts off the rack and handed them to Draco. The blonde held each one to his chest and asked Harry's opinion, even though it was clear that Draco could wear a burlap sack and still look edible.
“Hot?” Potter said, “Like this?” He tipped up onto the balls of his feet and touched his lips against the shell of Draco’s ear.
"Involved how?" Draco asked, thrown by the question.
He huffed, annoyed, and asked, "Is that all you're planning to use me for?"
"We could bring George too!" Ron said to Draco, practically vibrating with excitement.
“All right,” Potter replies, “what do you want to know?”
Romilda, Blaise, Pansy, Draco, Daphne and Milicent all took their shot immediately. The rest of the students watched them, hesitating. “Oh please,” Pansy said, “every person in this room has fantasized about at least one person here. Now take your shots or I’m going to pull out veritaserum and ask all of you a bunch of personal questions.”
This was going to be fun. Blaise let a slow smile spread as he stood and walked over to him. Neville was sitting with his back against the wall, legs stretched out in front of him. Blaise gracefully sank down, straddling him. Blaise could feel the heat from Neville's thighs seeping through his denims.
Harry wanted to feed her some reply about only doing as much as she was planning to, but he was worried his voice would carry and Ginny would hear it. Instead he gave a sly smile and they both headed in opposite directions. Harry finally opened the door to see Draco reaching up to put papers into his bag, alone.
Draco drug his eyes up from his mug to cock an eyebrow at Potter.
Pansy smirked.
“Would you prefer him? Is that why you didn’t ask me for dinner like a rational person?”
Scorpius didn’t really care about the apology. He was protective of Harry but he'd also been trying to get a rise, and he couldn’t bring himself to feel very bad about it. His eyes flitted from Dudley to Astrid. However, this girl had certainly piqued his interest, and he would need to smooth things over if he wanted her to be around more. He noticed her cheeks turned a gentle shade of pink as his eyes lingered on her. He looked back at Dudley with a smile, “No hard feelings,” he said easily, “I probably should have asked your name before trying to send you away.”
"As a date for the gala," Harry replied, weakly vying for the upper hand or any hand, really. As he seemed to have lost his in a matter of seconds.
Really, it was his mother's fault that everything changed. During the last three months of the war Narcissa had reconnected with her sister Andromeda. Consequently, Draco had started receiving mail from Andromeda and Teddy Lupin. It had taken no time at all for Draco to bond with Andromeda, who understood the heartbreak of loving a family that has hurt you. He found himself writing her twice a week just like he did for his own mother.
Harry settled into bed enjoying the sounds of his new place. The creeks of the pipes, the soft sounds of a river nearby, and the low hum of music from the wireless he'd left on in the living room. Just after midnight, Harry found himself staring at the ceiling, trying to determine what had pulled him out of deep sleep. He was startled when his headboard moved, slamming against the wall.
"Oh, hello," Potter said, much to Draco's horror.
Blaise shifted on the bed, trying to remember what happened in Potter’s life that he wouldn’t like this holiday. Not coming up with anything, he offered, “If you need to skip the party I’m sure no one would be upset.”
Ron eyed him for a long moment before replying, "You're on Malfoy."
"I wasn't aware of anything at the Leaky," Draco says. "Did you need me there?"
Draco looked between them before squeezing through, to open the door to the room, with a muttered, "I don't want to know."
Scorpius smiled and Astrid took a firm grip on the banister at the site. "We have some money," he admitted, "but magic can make things easy for anyone. Even poor wizards live fairly well off." He turned and motioned to a door, "That's my room," then pointed to the next door, "here's the loo and shower," and finally, motioned down the hall, "and that's you."
“Here’s what I would like to do from this point,” McGonagall said, ignoring Harry's question and sliding a piece of parchment across her desk. “I want the two of you to meet together and go over this list of incidents involving Scorpoius and Albus. I know, Mr. Malfoy, that you are a single parent. And Mr. Potter, you are the primary caretaker of your children as Mrs. Weasley is often out of the country for work.”
at Loire and Harry in quick succession.
“He’s not that bad anymore,” Seamus said, “Dean and I have worked with him on a few projects in potions.”
Draco glared at her, and Harry laughed. "Well it's going to be hard to do any of that! I hate the thought of being an auror, and I'm kinda in- I want to be with Draco- with, with Malfoy."
Blaise walked into the common room to find Potter and Draco sitting on the loveseat together, homework tucked into their laps.
"Sure."
"You know
Umbridge shrank back ever so slightly, then she replied in a high pitched screech, "Working here so long has addled your brain! I'm going to the ministry to report this to sane people! I will have someone come here and remove that boy!" She stormed over to the fireplace and disappeared in a burst of flame.
Two weeks before school started Neville and Luna planned a lunch outing for the Surviving members of the DA. Harry spent two hours with them at the Three Broomsticks. Rosmerta had closed the place for their private event and given everyone a round of Butterbeer on the house.
-Offer to pay for sex.
"Well," Hermione said, "I think Harry is an adult and should make his own choices. I also think that Harry has been gone on Draco for years," she looked at Harry, who was starting to speak up to defend himself, "Don't bother arguing, Ron and I remember 6th year," then looked back to Pansy. "Besides, Draco came to see me a little over a year ago and we had a much needed chat. So yes, I'm ok with it."
Hermione smiled at him, a gentle thing that tugged at Harry’s heart. “Thank you, Harry.”
Draco's sighs and nods. Seeing Potter in his clothes makes his stomach flip pleasantly, but his mind is suspicious of the motive. So much for feeling like he had a handle on this night.
"Headmistress," Draco said, "could you please tell us what's happened?"
A smile played at the corner of her lips. "Draco is redeemed?"
Ding.
Draco let the tip of his wand travel slowly down his chest, snagging purposefully on the buttons as it went. “You’re a very powerful wizard,” he said softly, “and we both know that you could get out of these ropes if you wanted.” He rolled his hips against Harry’s erection, eliciting a whine from the man under him.
“I’ve been seeing someone,” Draco says.
What do you guys think about all these connected relationships? Are you even keeping track? 😂😂
Hermione cleared her throat. "Well," she said, "I did wonder in sixth year," she trailed off.
"Seriously though, is everyone gay?" Ron asked. "I saw Neville and Blaise just now. Romilda and Hannah were holding hands in the hallway, and-"
“The students are mostly ignoring me now. I haven’t had a hex thrown at me at least three days.” Draco gave him a soft smile, “It’s helping having you in my dorm too.”
"Stop saying that, stop saying it like it's already true."
On Friday afternoon Hermione came over to find Harry still in his pajama pants with no shirt on and sleep filled eyes. She bossed him about until he was showered, dressed, and eating a proper meal in his kitchen.
"So," Harry continued, "that night Draco planted portkeys -which are items that transport you to a different continent- at the dinner table. When his parents were whisked away to New Zealand he had the manor to himself for nearly 24hrs, before they would get their hands on a legal portkey to return home." Harry smiled so wide it nearly split his face, "Then he set fire to the whole place!"
Draco pressed Harry into the wall and kissed him desperately, one hand at Harry's hip, encouraging his movements, the other hand carding through Harry's hair, and tugging gently at it. Harry's entire focus zeroed in on the kiss, and he felt his body melt into the solid man pressing into him. His magic spread out from his core wrapping around both of them, searching to interact with Draco's.
Scorpius had planned to wait patiently for his Grandmother to finish speaking with Daphne Greengrass, but as soon as Narcissa spotted him she cut the conversation short and beckoned Scorpius forward. Her dress was a midnight blue with diamonds sewn throughout the skirt in the shape of constellations. He spotted his namesake constellation near the top. Narcissa wrapped him in a hug and he whispered Happy Birthday to her. He pulled back and introduced Astrid, leaving off her last name all together rather than deal with that landmine.
"Ms. Umbridge," Draco began, "I'm very sorry, it was an accident."
