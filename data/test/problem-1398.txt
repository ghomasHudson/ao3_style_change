Harry shakes his head. “No. That doesn’t really matter that much. As long as we get along nicely, I’m good to go.”
Harry shrugs. “Yeah, sure. Why not? But isn’t this the room of requirement? Can’t we just wish for Armortentia and drink the one that the room gives us?”
Harry doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to overstep the lines. During the summer he’s had plenty of wild shags, both female and male, sometimes both at once, but nothing felt as intimate and hot as this. It’s Draco Malfoy, after all. Not just anyone.
Harry presses his lips together. He doesn’t want to admit that he misses that time. He clears his throat. “Why don’t we get away over Christmas? Just the two of us?”
Harry feels alarmed. He jumps up and tries to rush past Dean, but the other wizard holds him down tightly. “Dean, what the fuck?”
The raven-haired man stares at the ceiling, feeling out of place in this huge bed and empty room. He should be with Draco right now. After spending the past two days together, watching movies, taking long walks at the beach, cooking together, reading or painting, and even spending the most relaxing and peaceful Christmas Eve with him, Harry begins to feel empty the moment Draco wishes him goodnight and disappears in his room.
Draco almost feels empty at the loss of contact, but then Harry grabs Draco’s hand and holds it tightly. It makes up for the empty feeling and it weirdly comforts him.
Draco happily kisses him back. He grabs Harry’s waist and pulls him so much closer. Harry presses Draco against the wall and kisses him as if his life depended on it. Draco eventually pushes him away to catch his breath and to look Harry into his eyes.
“Did you talk after having sex?”, Hermione asks still confused. There’s a deep wrinkle forming between her bushy brows.
The boy steps even closer and puts his hand on Harry’s bicep. “I can’t stop thinking about you. I wish I could lick your abs, you know? Get a taste of you.”
Harry rolls his eyes again. He wishes Draco would stop staring at him through his intense, unreadable eyes.
Neville hugs him quickly and then walks straight up to Harry. "Harry! So nice to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you and I just wanted to tell you how impressed I am that you figured Draco out so quickly and managed to get him out of his comfort zone."
it. I’m ready, Draco. I am. I’ve wanted you since the first time I saw you in that lecture. But just
Thankfully, it’s late and dark and nobody’s here in the parking lot anymore. And even if, Draco doesn’t care. It’s raining like crazy, who’d be crazy enough to step out of the gym now?
“Hm. I guess I’d still consider Cho Chang the most attractive in our year”, Harry finally admits. He’s always thought that she’s one of the most beautiful girls he’s ever met.
Draco grabs Harry’s back with both hands, pushes him forward in a bending position. Now, Draco can hit Harry from a different angle, pushing inside harder and faster. When he hits that particular spot inside him, Harry moans loudly, bites in his own arm, and tries to control his body to stop himself from shaking. It’s all too much. He desperately needs to come. He’s so freaking close.
When the house-elves are finished, they place the most beautiful cake in front of Harry and Draco. Harry laughs at Draco’s expression.
“Rollover”, Harry orders, and Draco complies immediately. Harry slaps his arse cheek, then he nudges Draco’s legs apart, waiting for Draco to adjust before positioning himself.
Harry's hand finds Draco's crotch and he wraps his hand around Draco's dick, massaging it through his trousers.
When they're out for lunch together, she looks up from her menu and gives Draco a weird look - a mix between a smirk and a frown. "You're glowing."
“The moment I turned away from that guy, Ron pointed at you. And you were already kissing somebody else!”, Harry shouts back at him. He’s glad that the music is so loud that the people standing around them can’t hear their shouts.
“Be a good boy then, will you?”, Harry moans before he grabs Draco’s dick and wraps his lips around him. Draco’s head falls back as his back arches. “Fuck.”
Draco runs to his car in a desperate attempt to save his coat and rushes inside, turning on the heater.
Draco seems taken aback. Then, he shouts. “You flirted with that guy first. You didn’t even care that I was waving at you!”
“Dare,” Harry spits out right away. He’s definitely not going to choose Truth when Draco sits a few feet away from him.
Draco trails his fingers down Harry's spine and frowns as he notices the dark bruises on Harry's back. "Sorry."
“Oh my god, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!”, Draco cries and then, finally, he sinks onto the mattress and relaxes.
“Escape from school, I guess. From the people. The noise. Stress. It’s all a bit too much, you know?”
Harry does as he is being told and goes straight to it and grabs Draco’s arse cheeks with both his hands and begins to massage them.
“This is an electric device. You can send letters and receive letters from anyone in the world. These letters are called text messages. It’s almost like your own little owl. You can also call anyone in this world. Calling somebody means you talk to them on the phone. Through the phone.”
Harry sighs and eventually gets up. He walks towards Draco and falls into the seat next to him. “Hey.”
Harry stops and turns around to look at Draco. “Excuse me? Did you just say you never decorated a Christmas tree before?”
Harry clearly isn’t thinking straight. Draco being naked and thirsty for a cock isn’t helping either. His Veela is probably starting to form and puts Harry in a lovesick, horny trance or something.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
As soon as Draco closes the door behind him, he's already pressed against it, Harry's mouth on his, kissing him desperately.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, wrapping his arms around the raven-haired boy. “Relax. It was just a dream.”
“Hope next time we see each other you and Harry are finally boyfriends!”, Ron shouts after Draco, who rushes towards his car.
Suddenly, Ron nudges his side. “Harry. We’re supposed to partner up. Hermione and I already decided to work together.”
A faint blush graces Draco’s cheeks. Then, he clears his throat. “Why couldn’t you sleep? Did you have a nightmare?”
It’s nice. Harry and Draco, cooking together in their little apartment, music playing in the background. Harry could get used to this. He probably shouldn’t.
For a terribly long moment, Draco stares at Harry’s hand. Harry is almost certain that Draco will shrug it off and tell him no. He knew that eventually, he would have crossed the line, just as he always seems to do with Draco. He prepares himself for the rejection.
“Shit,” Harry mumbles, takes a bite of the banana and rushes to the door. The boys are all laughing at him. He knows how this looks like. As if he actually cares about this dick appointment. As if he has a genuine crush. But he doesn’t! Let the boys think about what they want. Harry knows it best anyway. He doesn’t like Draco. He doesn’t want anything from him but the sex.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
It turns quiet again and Harry enjoys the silence. He didn’t expect to be this relaxed around Draco. Harry always knew Draco had a special aura but he never knew how relaxing and calming it could be.
“Potter. I just really want to get laid. I’ll go insane if I don’t. And this is a perfect opportunity. A one-time thing. We’ll do this once, tonight. We’ll release some pressure, help each other out, and then we’ll go back to how it was before. I mean, we don’t even have a relationship that we could risk. We’re literally former arch enemies. What is there to lose?”
rather drafty, your wife would be in danger of catching a chill quite often, especially on colder mornings. We have a few on the ground floor, one is particularly near to the Hufflepuff common room, and therefore, close to the kitchens if she has a sudden craving. Due to your proximity to the Hufflepuffs and the fact that the younger years are rather innocent—and we’d like to
a surprise, but if this is really what you want, well…” She shrugged. “I guess we can’t hold the son responsible for the sins of the father.” She smiled. “Besides, he’s on our side now, and I think that’s wonderful.”
“So, what do you want for your birthday?” Draco asked, eyeing Harry’s wet body as the teen grabbed a towel.
“Then us being together is wrong, Ron.” Hermione said. “Because I am an open-minded individual that happens to believe that orientation does not a person make.” She finished, crossing her arms over her chest. “You have one week to come to terms with this. If you can’t, I refuse to continue trying to make this relationship work. It takes two to build a relationship, Ronald.”
!" Harry shouted, excitedly. "How much money do you think it would take to get enough to find the solution?" He asked.
you.” Harry said, grinning. “I can tell you that he tapped into it during our first lesson on it, so he’s got a natural affinity there.”
Draco opened one eye and yawned. “I hate getting up at the arsecrack of dawn after a night of great sex.” He mumbled, his face buried in the crook of Harry’s neck.
Draco tried to get a better grip on the air, then tried to throw it. It slipped from his grasp, and he only managed to cause a faint breeze once again. He growled in frustration. “This is harder than I thought.” He said angrily, trying to grab that energy and throw it around again.
Harry huffed out a laugh. “I’m willing to make certain allowances.” He denied, getting up and smacking Draco on the arse as he pulled out his uniform and started dressing.
Draco smiled. “Yes, but we won’t have that problem here. Even if I do decide to leave doors unlocked.”
“Karma’s cold.” Harry said, grinning. “Now get out and let’s go get dried off and stuff our faces in the name of victory.”
Draco laughed. “You do that.” He turned to Hermione. “Said he’s going to train more before he challenges me again. Helps that I’ve been fencing since I was five, I guess.”
Draco grinned, rolling onto his back and tucking his arms behind his head. “Well, if you can't wait, I’m here and ready to go.” He offered.
kind of hate. Well, hate sex should clear that right up.” She said, patting Celeste on the arm. “Just get all that aggression out by passionate sex.”
Draco opened his eyes in time to see Harry roll out of his bed and disappear into the bathroom. He just hoped he didn’t run into anyone in there, since he was currently male. Maybe sleeping in Draco’s room that night had been a bad idea. They were much safer from anyone finding out if they stayed in Harry’s. Then again, the ‘pretentious or not’ argument had just been finished that evening when they agreed to disagree, so Draco was understandably unable to sleep without his husband last night.
“Not a problem, but for any future pregnancies, keep track of them better. You have probably another ten or twenty minutes before I’ll have you start pushing.”
Draco shrugged. “I should have shadow magic, but that’ll manifest on its own, if I do, and I heal faster than normal, as well as possibly having tears of healing, but I’m not sure if that’s myth or not. When… I last cried they didn’t feel any different.” Draco finished softly, remembering that the rape he had suffered had been the last time he had cried.
For the first time ever, Harry saw Molly Weasley slap one of her children. She had then calmly told him that if he wasn’t mature enough to put the past behind him, then he was more than welcome to return home alone. Ron had wisely chosen to keep his mouth shut for the remainder of the meal.
Draco smiled. “Now, let’s head back to Hogwarts. Pansy and Millicent will take care of the baby shower gifts.”
They were in the Prefect’s bathroom, and all students and faculty were to be out of the halls until morning, giving them the privacy to bathe and return to their rooms nude, as was custom for one’s wedding night.
Draco sucked in a breath as his cock was stimulated further. It gave a feeble twitch, but he was too spent to be roused back to interest yet for a few hours, or at the very least, minutes.
The picture showed Celeste in her risqué morning-after-bonding outfit with her bonding mark showing and Harry knew that Colin Creevey had to be the one that took the picture.
had enough?" Harry growled, grabbing Draco's hand and pulling his husband into his room. "I think you'll find that I can look to my own pleasure well enough, thank you. Shall I demonstrate?" He asked, closing the door behind them.
“And don’t forget to invite us to the baby shower, of course.” Pansy said, poking Harry in the side.
“My dad had some dealings with him last time he was here. Nasty man.” The young man spat, then sighed. “
Harry was quiet, working on an essay for another class while he let Draco worry about the brewing. Every so often, he would wind his way through Draco's mind, careful not to disturb the blond, to find a piece of information he had forgotten that Draco remembered.
Harry read the letter again. It was from Snape, asking to meet him in Diagon Alley. Harry smiled, wondering if he’d finally found a cure. It had been seven years since he and Draco had graduated, and they now had a girl, twin boys, and Harry was expecting again.
Draco felt his heart drop. He had wanted a big family with Harry. At least three green-eyed little devils running around with Harry's power and kindness toward others and the Malfoy pride. "Oh." He answered. "Well, that's good, then." He said softly.
Ginny smiled brightly. “Good! Then we’ll have no problems. If you ever need my help, you know you only need to ask. Where Harry is concerned, at least.”
“To visit Windhaven, and make sure it’s ready when we need it.” Draco told him, sitting next to his husband.
Draco just sighed and took off the invisibility cloak. “I’m supposed to join you for the lessons. I’m a Legilimens, and Sev thinks I can help you. Plus, he wants a break.”
.” Poppy said firmly. “Since you only have a limited time as a female each month, the birth has to be planned out in advance. Your due date will be a week after your female period, so we should plan to induce labour while you are female, a week early.” She told Harry and Draco.
“So if we weren't soul-bound, I wouldn’t be able to share your room?” She asked hesitantly. “What about Narcissa? You said you've been here
Blaise woke, slipping his hand around the wand under his pillow as he heard frantic feet on the stairs. He wished his mother hadn’t gone to Germany for the week.
“And I’m your lucky mate. Too bad your ego has gotten almost as big as mine. We’ll be fighting within weeks.” Draco joked, walking up to the bed.
Harry finished brushing his hair and cast the spell to de-frizz his hair, making the curls look sleek and shiny. “Ready to head to breakfast?” He asked.
“Here it is.” Draco said, smiling as they came to a portrait of a young girl in a meadow, making a chain of flowers to add the ones currently adorning her neck, wrists and head. “Union of power.” He said, rolling his eyes as Harry smirked at the password.
Harry frowned, then spoke slowly. “It… Is hard. My mind does not… Want to… Allow it until I have… Bonded to you.” He said with no small amount of difficulty. “It is a… Security… Measure, I believe.”
Harry sighed. "Listen, we can take our time to decide what's best. We'll talk it over. It's going to take Severus some time to get the experimenting over with, isn't it? And I can't try anything until our daughter is born."
Pansy, Millicent and Blaise were waiting for them outside their door. Harry flushed a bit when he found them there, but he let them look him and Draco over until their eyes fell on the bonding marks and they all nodded, Pansy and Millicent grinning.
“Take that inkwell—and anything else Dark—out of this room and store them in your old master’s study. I will sort through the things later.” Draco ordered.
.” He leaned toward Harry, cupping his cheek. “You’ve more than earned that second kiss.” He said softly, then pressed his lips to Harry’s.
Harry smiled. “I do. I’m happy about it, too, but in the future, let’s try to plan them, instead of being surprised by them, yes?”
Harry chuckled. “Good. Mine forever.” He said firmly, holding Draco tightly, making the blond feel safe and more loved than he had ever before felt.
Draco just kept chuckling every time he saw Harry blush, and occasionally reaching over to caress the tiny bump that was their child.
He smirked, thinking of the fifth year Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff class he was about to teach. The potion he was having them brew today was perhaps just a bit too difficult for some of them, but then again, was their ineptitude Severus’ problem? Never, and he would delight in pointing out every little mistake they made.
Celeste gaped at the crystal chandelier, the pride and joy of the previous occupants. “Bit ostentatious, isn’t it?” She indicated the thing.
Draco watched as Harry closed his eyes and swayed just a bit. He reached out and wrapped an arm around his waist, helping to steady him.
Draco smiled. “Right. We have to be off now. Feel free to send an Owl, you'd be the perfect person to show us around the village when we properly move in. I haven’t been out this way in
Harry rolled his eyes and sheathed his sword. “Ma voi antrena mai mult.”(I will train more.) He said wryly.
Harry snorted. “Okay, so we won’t do that unless we want that to happen. Fair enough? I still want to hold your hand, and kiss you, and cuddle and all that other fluffy boyfriend stuff.” He said, smiling.
Draco spoke the words that had been rolling around in his mind ever since he had discovered that he and Harry resonated. “Our souls ring with but one note, both sounding in perfect harmony. We are one whole, you and I, and I vow to find you in the next life, and each lifetime thereafter, for all eternity. To find you again, I leave with you the mark of my love and devotion, and the proof that we are Bound.”
“Tradition.” Draco explained. “When we get to the great hall, Pansy and Blaise will step aside, and we will lead the rest of the way to the Slytherin table. Our house has always had the biggest displays when one of us has a life-changing event occur. It’s a show of solidarity, since we’re so 'misunderstood.'” He joked.
Draco looked up, meeting his eyes, his own frightened, yet hopeful as well. “Don’t hurt me, Harry.” He said hesitantly.
Draco stood, frozen to the spot, as Potter rounded the corner and stopped dead in front of him. “Shit, not you, too. Fuck, I just want a
“Draco, when the baby comes, are you two staying in the dorms?” Pansy asked. “Because with your current problems remembering silencing charms, that could definitely be an issue.”
Draco shivered, closing his eyes tightly as he fought to keep his breathing somewhat even. That tongue was running over his small hole teasingly, applying light pressure, barely even pushing, and Draco just wanted it to slide into him deeply.
Harry just smiled and took Draco’s hand, leading the teen into Gryffindor tower, closing the portrait behind them and sitting with him on the couch.
She squeaked as they all noticed each other, then suddenly, black wings erupted from Draco’s back, wrapping around himself and Harry.
Draco nodded. “My mother was likely to turn me in to Voldemort the second she found out, and I’m still a bit worried that Sev might be forced to do the same, if the evil git hears about me.”
Harry sighed and sat down on the couch, face in his hands. “Imi pare rau.”(I’m sorry.) He apologized.
Harry gasped several times in quick succession as Draco picked up a quick rhythm with his thrusting, setting a punishing pace and expecting Harry to be up for the ride. Luckily, the brunet was willing to give as well as he was getting, pushing back against Draco’s thrusts with equal fervour.
Celeste bore down, reaching for Draco’s hand and squeezing when she got it, causing Draco to wince, but though the grip was painful—almost unbearably so—he managed to keep silent and took the pain as Celeste cried out, pushing with all her might.
.” He said, then took off, dipping and diving as Fred and Blaise mounted the school broom, Blaise looking like he was going to be sick.
Celeste was getting up from breakfast, about to go to class, when her eyes rolled back into her head and she fainted dead away. Blaise, who had been standing beside her talking to Draco, caught her.
Draco couldn’t stand the thought of the disgusting creature touching him, marking his perfect skin, using him as a pawn, draining his magic from him to use as his own… No, Draco wouldn’t be his plaything. He would never take the mark.
Harry rolled onto his front. “I still have my Charms essay to write, but after that, I’m free for the rest of the day.” He said lightly.
Draco nodded and cast a featherweight charm on Celeste, picking her up bridal style and carrying her to their rooms.
Fred shook his head. “You can come with me. Harry does crazy stunts that would kill any sane person, but
“I’ll hold you to that.” Harry said, propping his feet up on the low table in front of the fire and letting his head fall back as his eyes slipped closed. He was just
It led to a yellow room, with a changing table and crib, both in white, and a small wardrobe against one wall. There was a dark rocker in the corner, where Celeste could sit and nurse, or simply enjoy being in the presence of her baby. In the corner across from the rocker, there was a toddler bed.
Draco nodded. “Celeste will need time after the birth to recover, but we should be up to venturing out around the middle of July. Will that work for you?”
He broke the kiss once Draco's shirt was fully unbuttoned, locking his eyes onto the blond's and smirking. "You have the chance now to decide how you want this. I can either give you fast relief, and then nothing else until tomorrow night, or I can draw this out and make you suffer, then after dinner we will come back here and spend the night in bed together."
Draco nodded. “I can cast a featherweight to carry her back to our rooms, right?” He asked, drawing his wand.
Celeste was sitting up in bed, eyes wide and terrified, both hands resting on her large stomach. “Amniotic fluid?” She asked more than said.
the Master bedroom, and share the Wards. We can also add more rooms under those same Wards, with a little effort, so long as they connect to the rest. We could encase the
Draco lay on the bed behind him and wrapped his arms around his husband, holding him close. “It’s okay, we’ll get through it. You want him to know, remember?”
Draco snorted. “Trust me, Potter, bland is good when you taste every little thing used to make your food as strongly as the next. My birthday waffles were
Harry lifted the blond into his arms and stood, making Draco shriek, arms wrapping tightly around Harry’s neck. “Where are you taking me?” He asked.
“I can wait until you change. I'm in the mood to bottom tonight, anyway. Been waiting a long time.” Draco said.
Harry groaned in pain as a set of knees landed heavily on his gut, knocking the wind out of him. “Oh!”
, you chose the wrong person to marry, Love. The Malfoy family is very influential, still. I'm getting our good name restored, little by little. I've been donating to charities generously, and that helps me look contrite for my Father's mistakes, even though I feel no guilt for that psycho's actions. They were
Draco turned to the last elf. “Tipple, you will help out wherever you are needed most. Once the wing we intend to use is clean, you will only need to keep it tidy. The rest of the house will not see much use, just keep it dust-free and safe. One elf must be in the kitchen at all times, in case one of us gets hungry at a time other than mealtime. That will mostly be you. Obey my wife or face my wrath. You may all now get to work.” Draco finished addressing them. He turned to Celeste. “Anytime you need something, Tissy is the head elf, she will deal mostly with our requests, unless you are pregnant, in which case, Minsy is your personal elf. She was Ellie’s help when I was little.”
“Draco? Are you alright?!” Harry asked, jumping off his broom and rushing over to the fallen Slytherin.
Harry cast tempus, then cursed, shoving the rest of his roll in his mouth as he rushed out of the great hall, late for Occlumency.
Draco looked up from his textbook from where he lay, sprawled over Harry’s bed. “Hm. I’ve always been fond of Delphini, for a girl.” He told Harry with a small smile on his face. “And with your delicate build, the super-feminine name will suit her, because she’ll likely be on the small side.”
Harry’s grin widened and he replied, “A kind of biscuit Americans really like. I’ve had one, once, and it wasn’t terrible. I’ll get some and let you try them sometime.”
Harry moaned softly as Draco carefully stretched him, brushing against his prostate. Harry was sure the movements were not accidental. “Draco,
of them in fact, but it wasn’t the same as being able to go home after term and ask his parents to tell their side of the tale.
handy against—” Hermione stopped short as Draco effortlessly conjured his sword of ice, sliding into a fencing stance, smirking at Harry.
need it, too. I’m ready for you. You don’t scare me, and you won’t hurt me.” He said softly at the doubt in Harry’s eyes.
It seemed as though all the other houses were staring at Harry and Draco for most of the meal. Harry tried to choke down his food while the other Slytherins teased him and Draco about their wedding night.
“Potter!” Draco’s voice sounded ahead of him. Harry looked for Draco, then felt a hand on his shoulder before Draco’s face appeared floating next to him. “Hey.”
Celeste flushed. “I didn’t realize they were getting closer together, I thought it was just more practice ones.” She admitted.
“And you can bear children, it should be easier with an incubus mate, and this elemental power could come in
Harry’s eyes fluttered closed, and he wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, pulling the Slytherin close. He sighed contentedly as he felt Draco’s lips tremble, then open slightly against his. He resisted the temptation and broke the kiss. “Draco, that was wonderful.” He said.
Draco cupped Harry’s chin in his palm and raised Harry’s head. “Open your eyes.” He said challengingly.
, but he believed that Harry could afford to fund the research, since he hadn't told Severus to stop looking for a way.
Draco looked around. “This used to be Father's room.” He murmured. He bared his teeth at an inkwell on the desk and snapped, “Tissy!”
“You would like to spare your fellow Slytherins the sleepless nights that you know are in store for you?” Dumbledore asked. “Have you considered silencing charms?”
Harry and Draco rushed up to the dormitory and threw their discarded clothing back on, blushing furiously both at being caught like that and their ruined make-out session. Draco was finally comfortable with nudity, and they were slowly exploring each other’s bodies, getting used to each other while they had time.
Draco snorted. “Something feels off about you today. A few magical creature genes only activate at the moment of your birth when you come of age. I think you might have an inheritance.”
Draco turned a serious face on him. “I’ve seen snippets of your past smeared across the papers, Love. I know. But that will have an effect on your children. Luckily, they will also likely have inherited your level of magical power to protect them.”
Madam Pomfrey came into the room with a large black bag. “No one needs to be scared, this is perfectly timed. Celeste, your body clearly knows what it is doing.” She sterilized her hands and vanished Celeste’s underclothes and rucked up the nightie. “Let’s see what’s going on here.”
Harry laid on the bed, hungrily staring in the doorway of the bathroom, watching Draco inside in only his boxers, brushing his teeth and getting ready for bed.
“Oh.” Draco flushed. “Right. Sorry if I made you… Right.” He said, stopping before he made things worse.
Madam Pomfrey hummed. “Breathe, that’s it. That was good, but you need to try just a little harder. I think this will be relatively easy, though, I did see the head, and she’s not overly large. Try for a bigger push this time. Ready? And
, Draco. You'll get to be with the Harry you first fell for. After all, Celeste isn't really the same, right?"
"I'm happy you agreed to this. Thank you", Harry whispers and leans his head back to kiss Draco on the mouth.
The whole situation is getting messy. Draco thinks about Harry nonstop. He wants to see him, talk to him, be around him. It's crazy.
“I love lemon cake, but I’ve never really had one for myself. Mother is a horrible cook and she’s even worse at baking. She lets our house-elves do all the work. I cringe every time, trust me. I wish she didn’t need to rely on them so much.”
“Anyway. That’s what makes him so special. He treats me like a normal person for once. He sees my flaws. And he understands me.”
Draco sits a couple of benches behind him, his blonde hair flowing in the wind, a grey scarf wrapped around his neck, and a cigarette between his lips. Harry didn’t even know that Malfoy smokes.
"This wasn't so bad, huh?", Harry asks as they get out of the cap they had taken back to Draco's flat. They both had been drinking so driving would be a bad idea now.
Obviously, he doesn’t deny him anything. He poses next to the boy, smiles into the camera, and even gives him a hug. But he still wants to disappear and never interact with any wizard or witch ever again. He knows he’s bright red when he goes back to eating his sandwich.
Draco stares at him in disbelief. “You’re kidding me. We’re sitting in a fancy restaurant like a couple on a date night.”
Harry raises his eyebrows in surprise, but Draco immediately jumps back. “I mean, I’ve heard people say that about you. You’re not ugly. That’s what I was trying to say. I don’t think you’re hot. I’d consider you average. You know. I don't -”
After packing all of his stuff, he immediately apparates to the Burrow. He doesn’t even care about anything else. The moment Ron sees Harry walk through the door, he drops his cup of tea, shouts “Hermione! Emergency!” and grabs Harry's arm. Ron pulls Harry with him and rushes to his bedroom, Hermione following him immediately.
“Show him you’re serious about this. Show him you’re ready for more. Show him you love him. Don’t just call him, that’s too simple.”
Draco’s mouth opens in a silent cry, his eyes are tightly shut, and the hand around Harry begins to squeeze tightly. “Harry, I’m so close - Nnnghh! “
Hermione eventually agrees to do it just because the others offer her a joker for when it’s her turn, and she really doesn’t want to do a task.
But Dean doesn’t give in. He basically shoves the drink down Harry’s throat. Harry coughs. “These are the rules. One-Shot of Veritaserum.”
Neville slams his hand against the table. “Merlin. Harry, please talk to him for god’s sake. Sober. And tell him everything. And force him to be honest with you. I can’t believe how dumb both of you are.”
Harry’s heart speeds up. Oh, God. What is he supposed to say? He shrugs. Play it cool, Potter! “I guess.”
He accepts the shot that Neville prepares for him and tries to place it in between Hermione’s cleavage. But Hermione fights back. “No. I’m not doing that. It’s Ron’s turn, not mine! Why should I do something I don’t want to do when it’s not even my turn?”
Draco is satisfied with himself. They went to both museums, spent the perfect amount of time in each of them, they had an interesting tour guide and the students all beam at him happily when he tells them they are free to do whatever they want to do.
Then, the student nods and smiles at Draco timidly. The boy grabs his bag and his coat and rushes out of the hall leaving Draco to himself.
Harry shakes his head, but can’t hide his excitement. It's been way too long since he truly let go. The group begins to drink and after an hour, Harry already feels his head spin. His cheeks feel warm, his hands are slightly sticky and his face hurts from smiling so much.
Draco sighs. "I don't think I can do that. Neville, he's really bloody attractive. I've never seen such green eyes in my entire life!"
“Blaise and Pansy said they were watching you flirt hardcore with him. That’s what made Draco really angry and sad. He was upset and
“I mean,” Harry rows back, panic building up inside of him. “I’m not attracted to you! Like, not at all. But, you know, many people consider you attractive. That’s all.”
They spend Christmas Eve making their very own pizza. Draco has never made pizza himself before, and Harry really wanted to keep it interesting and untraditional.
"What time is it?", Draco asks and checks his phone. "Ah, shit, we have an hour until we need to leave."
“Um”, Hermione begins. “Are you sure that you and Draco are just friends? Because friends usually don’t book a house and spend Christmas with each other.”
The boy smiles and runs a hand through his crazy messy hair. Then, he turns around. Happily, he jumps up the stairs and out of the lecture hall.
“Harry,” he sighs, pressing back as Harry sets up a painfully slow rhythm, letting Draco feel the length of his fingers as he pushes it in and out. It must hurt Draco, it must burn, but still, Draco begs for more. “Please,” he gasps, “Harry, more.”
Draco clears his throat again. God, this is awkward. “Well. I needed some time to realise what I want. Who I want.”
“Because it was freaking obvious. You started eating more. And you started laughing more. Harry, you started to care more! Also, you became all bubbly and excited. I think he’s perfect for you.”
He’s young, ambitious and hardworking and if that makes him a miserable single guy in his thirties then so be it. The thing is, Draco is truly happy. He just turned 31, he works at his desired university as a professor, he lives in a little cosy flat and owns a cat named Greg. Draco doesn’t feel like he’s missing out on something.
Draco nods eagerly and prances closer to the bed. His light blue silk pajamas make him look elegant and put together, they balance out the mess of his hair. It’s so wild, it could almost be considered curly.
But after fucking Draco into oblivion, he doesn’t quite think everything is just good between them. He thinks it’s a lot more complicated than that.
The blonde man grabs the two bottles and hands one to Harry. This is it, Harry thinks. There’s no going back now. He doesn’t know whether he should be scared or excited about what’s to come.
Harry doesn’t sleep well during the first night. He keeps thinking about Draco and how the other man is sleeping in the room next to him. The raven-haired man fights the wish to get up, walk to Draco’s room, and get into his bed cuddling with him and falling asleep next to him several times. It’s exhausting.
They move their hands in a fast pace, both grinding into each other and biting each other’s neck, lips, ears and shoulder.
Harry shakes his head. That can’t be true! Neville must’ve gotten something twisted. “I – Draco isn’t the kind of guy to get jealous. He definitely wasn’t – that can’t be. He isn’t into me. Not like that.”
Draco stares at the man in awe one more time. Then, he turns around and walks home with shaky hands and a thousand thoughts racing through his mind.
“Yeah”, Draco answers and now it’s his turn to blush. “You know - someone who the Veela wants to attract because - um - because - Well because the Veela's attracted to them.”
Then, he reaches up and tries to attach the star to the top of the tree. Draco’s shirt slides up, revealing just the tiniest bit of soft, silky, pale skin. And Harry, he –
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
And then, finally, Draco pushes in with one smooth movement. Harry sees stars, his head spins, and the air gets stuck in his lungs. His mouth falls open, and he sinks against Draco’s chest. Draco holds him up with his strong arms and gently begins to move. He’s sweet and careful, and he gives Harry enough time to adjust to his movements.
Draco presses his lips together and stares at Harry's lost green eyes. How could he possibly say no? He sighs. "Yes, of course."
Draco simply stares at Harry, the words echoing in his brain. Then he realizes that he's supposed to order.
Draco doesn’t know what to do. This feels like Harry is asking him out on a date and Draco can’t deal with that. He can’t fall even more for the boy than he already
Draco is still mesmerised. He nods and doesn’t know what else to say. Now that he knows what the boy’s voice sounds like he’ll never be able to sleep.
Draco leans back, his grey eyes turning soft and gentle, and hums. “Well. First of all, you need to eat. You look like shit.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco bites his lip. “Maybe we should stop with the Amortentia once and for all. It had to end eventually, anyway.”
Harry’s head spins. The alcohol stops him from thinking straight. “Why would you kiss someone just because some random guy asked for my number?”
Mainly, because Snape isn't around anymore. And partly, because Malfoy seems to glow every time he brews a potion perfectly.
But Harry really, really doesn’t want another horrible encounter at the Leaky Caldron. That’s why he insists on staying home.
Harry frowns, the words sputter out of his mouth before he can even stop himself. “That is absolutely stupid. I don’t wanna do that! Why would you choose that for me?”
Draco runs a hand over Harry’s chest. It’s such a soft movement, Harry feels shivers run down his spine.
Therefore, Harry grabs Draco’s waist, squeezes it tight for support and wriggles his way to the seat next to the window.
So, Harry does. He pushes into Draco, again and again. Draco meets every thrust, moaning, and crying at the same time. They find a perfect, steady rhythm, both adjusting to each other’s movements perfectly.
They've been dating for two weeks when Harry suggests a nice get together with all of their friends.
Draco seems to understand. He removes his hand, spreads some lube onto his dick, and positions himself. He kisses Harry’s neck to calm him.
They stay like that for what feels like an eternity, both panting heavily and getting down from their high.
When Draco shows him how to do Yoga for the first time, Harry can’t help himself but stare at Draco’s incredible arse. He really hopes that Draco doesn’t notice Harry staring like a creep. He tries his best to focus and tries to follow Draco’s instructions, but it’s really difficult with Draco looking like that in yoga pants.
Harry kisses all the way down and finally unbuckles Draco’s belt. In one swift movement, he undresses Draco and throws his jeans and his boxers away. Then, he licks his lips and starts to massage Draco’s already hard cock with his right hand. His left hand is massaging his balls.
“I just do. We haven't seen each other in two weeks”, Harry sticks out his tongue. “Didn’t you miss me?”
Slowly and hesitant, Draco reaches out his hand and softly strokes Harry’s hair. “I’ve always wanted to do that. Since the first day we met.”
The bloke doesn’t need to be told twice. He rushes out of the bathroom with shaky knees and slams the door shut.
Draco can’t hold himself back any longer. He slams into Harry full force, grabs his waist and pulls him up. "Oh god!"
Draco continues to massage his shoulders for a couple more minutes. Then, he washes his hair again and makes sure that all of the potions are washed out.
Harry watches Draco. He wishes he could read anything in his eyes or his face. But his expression is blank. There’s nothing to read, nothing to see, nothing to figure out. They sit in silence for a while.
Harry rests his head on his hand and watches Draco fondly. Draco doesn’t know where to look: Harry’s eyes, his lips, his hair, his neck?
Harry sighed and slid off the table, laying a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Just think about it, okay?”
The Romanian is translated by a reader a few years back, and should now be more accurate. If you spot mistakes, please point them out.
Draco took a deep breath. “Sir, I need to request a private room for myself and my wife.” He said. “As you know, we have a baby on the way, and—”
Draco raised his eyebrows. “You can only touch, Nott. I’m not sleeping with you.” He said firmly. “I mean it.”
“Anti-nausea potion, healing potion, calming draught, and…” He looked Draco over, hoping he was wrong, “Pain reliever and contraceptive.” He helped Draco get onto his bed.
Harry rifled through his wardrobe. “I suppose we really should take the wedding clothes so that they don’t have to come with everything else and get wrinkled or ruined.” He said.
, but…” He walked out a bit further and reached down, laying his hand on the ground, lacing his finger through the grass so that his palm could rest on the soil. He frowned as Harry walked up to join him.
Madam Pomfrey tsked. “Trust me, there is no other course now. Your daughter is not going to wait, and I can’t just cut her out when your body has already started the process naturally. When she is out, you will get pain potions, and you will forget all about the pain in a few weeks.” She smiled. “It may even only take a few days, so don’t worry too much, dear.”
Severus sighed. ‘Draco, please forgive me if I find the answer.’ He prayed. ‘I’m only doing this so that you’ll know you were freely chosen.’
“I don’t think I’m ready to help you when… Hunger strikes.” He said, blushing and staring at his hands.
want to. You’ll like it, I swear! We don’t have to have sex. I could give you a blow job. Would that work?” Draco asked hopefully.
Draco buried his hands in Harry’s hair, pulling the Gryffindor’s mouth to his and kissing him desperately as they stiffened and cried out in unison, the sounds trapped between their fused mouths. They held the kiss as they came down from their high, the desperation melting away and leaving a muted, gentle satisfaction in its wake.
“She'll stay in here until she is five, then she will move into the Heir’s bedroom. Or we can wait for a boy. Most families do.” Draco said.
Pansy tossed her hair. "If I wanted to be married by now, I would be." She declared haughtily. "Well, but for one simple matter." She amended, sneaking a glance at the head table under her lashes.
Harry sighed in defeat and opened them, staring into Draco’s eyes with eyes glowing brighter than the killing curse.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You’re gay? That’s going to cause mass hysteria, one way or another. Some girls will be
“Hmm… Breakfast sounds like a good start. Then, how about a kiss I can actually remember properly?” He asked hopefully.
"I'm joking." Harry said without inflection, then stuck out his hand and smirked evilly as a large, pink dildo flew out of his wardrobe and straight into Harry's hand. "Now, lie back again, Lover."
Harry snorted, but nodded. “Sure thing, but I think I’ll be able to hold my own. I like my guys feminine and dainty.”
Narcissa laughed. “Oh, dear me, yes! It’s perfectly safe, until you get very close to the end of your pregnancy. Your Mediwitch or Mediwizard will tell you when it’s time to stop having sex.” She told him. “Until that time, both you and Draco should enjoy your body. It’ll be going through a lot of changes, but I’m sure Draco will still find you beautiful. He was raised right, after all.” She said, sending him a stern glance.
Draco smirked. “That’s a privilege only given to a few. The heads of old families are allowed leeway when courting or moving homes. It’s an archaic law that not many benefit from, but with Father out of the picture, I
“I’m scared.” Harry admitted, a wry smile forming. “Kind of pathetic, isn’t it? The Defeater of Voldemort, afraid to tell his only remaining link to his parents who he really is?”
“Um.” Draco said nervously, feeling Harry’s length nudging against his thigh. “Do you want me to...?” He trailed off, glancing downward.
“Do I always have to have an ulterior motive? I want to go inside and spend time with you where it’s
Harry smirked. “I hoped you’d say that.” He purred, sliding back down Draco’s body, his tongue tracing a line as he went. That tongue slid over Draco’s cock, up one side and down the other, before it ran teasingly over his balls before circling the tiny pucker behind them.
Harry and Draco walked to class, heads together as they conversed in low tones about which classes they both needed for their career paths, and mused about how likely they were to get their dream jobs.
“No.” Draco swallowed and stared down at his lap. “On my birthday, I went to Nott’s house to spend the night. He’s not my best friend, but I figured he was an okay bloke, and he’d never done anything to make me distrust him before. He brought up my… Preferences, hoping I could help him find out if he was the same. He agreed to my limits, and I let him kiss me and touch everywhere that wasn’t covered by underwear, but… He went further than I agreed to.”
Harry flushed, leading Draco in to sit between Ginny and him. He sat next to Hermione. “Yeah, I am.”
Draco found his own clothes and changed, then grabbed Harry’s wand and spelled his hair into place carefully.
“I’m going to attempt to decode your DNA and meld the two strands together as they were to re-write your genetic code as it used to be. It will likely take me years, but I will do my best to return you to your previous state.” Severus promised.
Draco just shook his head, unable to move more due to overindulgence of sweets. “I think I’d chuck all over the floor if I so much as licked it.” He said, then fell back onto Nott’s bed, groaning.
“It’s supposed to be good luck. Sunday is the best day to start new ventures because it’s the beginning of a new week.” Draco smirked. “Now, I think I’m going to figure out just where our marks ended up. Turn over.”
Harry finally raised his head, smirking. “There’s something… I’ve been wanting to try.” He purred, his eyes glowing eerily. “Are you up for a bit of… Experimentation?”
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I guess. Mum wants us to get the house ready for our lovely guests tomorrow. My dear
“So, since Potter’s relatives have been beating the hell out of him since forever, he gets to spend the summer here
“Oh. Since I may have to have sex soon, we should start getting me ready for intimacy, shouldn’t we?”
Harry grinned. “Well, the first one was kind of expected. He was old, his heart almost couldn’t handle the consummation as it was. The second time just finished him off.” He told her. “Arabella and I laughed over it when she told me how she’d been dreading having to sleep with him again, and then he died just as things were getting heated.”
Harry growled and followed, holding the trembling Draco as the water washed away the seed from their sated bodies.
Harry sent Draco a mental picture of him, tied to their bed and blindfolded, while Harry fucked him, first with his tongue, then a dildo, then with his own cock.
being able to use elemental magic.” He said, deflecting another blow and spinning around to get behind Harry, smacking him with the flat of his sword on the ass. “Dead.” He chirped.
“You and me both.” Harry agreed. “Oh, I forgot to tell you, I sent a letter to Arabella about the baby. She’s probably going to be a bit angry, at me most likely, but she had to know. She and I got pretty close over the summer, and she’d be upset if I kept it from her for too long.” He said.
Draco and Harry snickered. “We’ll think about it, but we are going to be very protective, probably until well after we leave Hogwarts.”
“But she was on the Quidditch team, Harry. And she wasn’t exactly the most feminine of girls if you ask me. She was more like one of the guys, right?” She said, as if that settled it. “Anyway, I’m happy for you. If you’re happy, that’s all that matters.”
Harry snorted. “Really, though, we’re an unlikely pair, but I can’t imagine being with anyone else now.” He mused.
Draco just shook his head. “Love, look at me.” He cajoled, trying to pull the pillow away from Harry’s face.
They moved together, rushing toward their peak, Pansy watching with eager eyes, taking in the entire tableau, likely committing it to memory.
Draco shrugged. “Well, both of us will just have to give exams a miss until the August re-tests come up, then.” He said surely.
After a few minutes, Harry came back into the room and lay on the bed, groaning. “I hate you right now.” He declared.
Madam Pomfrey leaned down and laid a hand on her stomach, feeling for a contraction. “Alright, next contraction, you need to push.”
Draco snorted. “Yes, and the two of them are quite close, too. They’ll agree on most things, which means it’ll be planned out pretty quickly. Did you know, if Blaise was a girl, I was supposed to be betrothed to him?”
“Well, did you know that all Vanteera have the ability to take the form of a winged black panther at will?”
“Yes, well, that’s how Purebloods work. It may seem stupid, but we generally do all right, so we must be doing
Harry snorted. “It’s not going to get any better. You might want to go take a shower and fix your problem while I enjoy my treat.”
property. We absorbed it through a Malfoy man marrying the last female heir of the Kemble family. They had two, but one is old and crumbling. Eventually, we can rebuild, if we want, but I don’t see the need to right now.”
Between the two minds they now had to draw from, neither had any doubts that their N.E.W.T. scores would be at the very least above par with their peers.
Draco ignored him, finishing the letter and rolling it up. He stood and walked to the door. “Go ahead and wank yourself raw. We both know it’ll
He stared, wide-eyed, at the girl in his arms. “That’s not good.” He said softly, noticing her pallor.
Draco smiled. “No. A bonding is purely sex magic. It draws on the power generated when two resonating people make love with the intention of joining their souls to one another. It is irreversible, and will last even past death, leading us to each other in the next life.” He explained, drawing the sponge he had bought for this night across Harry’s shoulders, watching the cinnamon-scented bubbles run in rivulets down Harry’s back, making the air smell sweet and spicy.
Draco smiled. “Yeah, they are. I’ve been practicing my flying on the pitch while you’re in class with Sev. They work, and I’m getting rather good at using them, too!”
Pansy smiled slowly, licking her lips. “That was wonderful, boys, thank you for letting me watch. It'll be our little secret.” She assured them. “Have a good night.” She said brightly, then left them alone again.
“It is no trouble at all, Mr. Malfoy, you are welcome. Give your wife my best, and I wish you both every happiness in life, and many healthy children.” Dumbledore said.
Draco groaned and took Harry’s hand, kissing it and placing it on his lower back. “Just hold onto me, Love.” He whispered.
Harry sighed, letting Draco go. He groaned, then headed to the entrance of the shower room, seeing Draco brushing his hair in front of the mirror. “Sorry. I was out of line. A bastard, even. It was absolutely vile of me. Still friends?” He asked hopefully.
He sat in the middle of the pitch and began meditating, finally coming out of it when it was dark out. ‘Hm. Wonder why no one came out to get me when it started getting dark.’
.” He added, following the pronouncement with a particularly hard thrust that rocked Harry forward and made him gasp.
I have a vague idea for next chapter, but unless you want APiLC getting five more updates before then, suggestions are welcome. You've all seen what happens without them. I get VERY distracted.
Harry sighed, grasping Draco’s hand tightly as he took one more deep, fortifying breath, and opened his bedroom door, proudly stepping out into the Slytherin common room with his mark laid bare for all to see, hand firmly clasped within Draco’s.
Ron had looked livid when Draco refused the cake, politely stating that he was unable to eat it. He had stood up from his seat and accused Draco of acting like he was too good to eat the cake prepared by someone he saw as beneath him. Draco had explained that he was a Vanteera, and Ron had then accused him of lying.
Draco nodded. “Go ahead.” He said, letting Fred run his hand along the back of one wing, reverently.
Harry blushed, grinning sheepishly. “Sorry?” He offered. “I was going to come if you did that again, so I panicked.” He explained.
Draco nodded. “So, what do you say? Should I turn myself in or wait for Mum or Sev to do it for me?” He asked lightly.
Draco woke, looking at Harry’s sleeping face blearily. “So young.” He whispered, tracing the furrowed brow gently. “And carrying such pain.” He finished sadly, running a hand through Harry’s thick hair.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Anyways, so we need to find out how you can summon water and then work on freezing and boiling it. Once you can make things out of ice, we’ll move on. Air should be next, then Earth, and Fire last since it’s the polar opposite of water. It’ll be the most difficult for you.” He finished. “Oh, and Mother sent this for you.” He finished, pulling a bottle of wine out of the bag he had brought. “This is Elven wine. She said no young man that’s of age should have to give up alcohol so soon. This should agree with your taste buds. And she sent a dagger for you. Here.”
Madam Pomfrey finished up and checked the baby over. “Everything looks good. No getting up for three days, no heavy lifting for four weeks, and light activity for six weeks. Then we will talk about you getting back to your normal routine.” She told Celeste.
Harry sucked in a breath, his eyes tearing up. “Low blow, Moony.” He whispered in pain and guilt both.
They ate, then went and put the few things they'd brought with them into the wardrobe in the Master bedroom. It was nice to finally have a place of their own, and both of them headed back to school with smiles on their faces.
Once Draco was holding a large 24-ounce tumbler, Harry smiled and nodded. “Good. Now, go down to the kitchens and get me three scoops of strawberry ice cream in that, and fill the rest with milk. Bring a spoon with a handle long enough to reach the bottom of the cup.”
Draco’s eyes widened and he swallowed, torn. Yes, he wanted it, very badly. But he was still afraid to give another person the power to hurt him like that. Plus, he wasn’t sure that Harry wouldn’t regret becoming his mate. “I can’t.” He choked out, then rushed out to dry off and get dressed.
Harry mounted his broom and kicked off, circling Draco and whooping. “Come on, get up, you lazy bugger!” He shouted teasingly.
Harry sighed. "Thanks for that. Well, now that you've softened up a bit, how about trying that dildo idea?" He suggested.
Draco raised an eyebrow, glancing at Harry. "Don't tell me you don't want to be the consort of the Ruler of the World, Love. Therefore, the one person who should never think me creepy would be
, Harry. I’m with you willingly, and I’m going to have sex with you willingly. Why would I need to forgive you for something I’m sure I’ll enjoy?” He added, smiling at Harry.
“Now we get to walk the halls naked, which is why they told everyone to stay in their dorms after eight PM. Some, of course, will not be there, but they will most likely be in the astronomy tower and in the room of requirement. They aren’t interested in seeing us and not many couples find the dungeons romantic.” Draco sneered the word, leading Harry out of the bathroom, hands entwined.
plan to do just fine, all the same.” He said, wrapping an arm around her waist and pressing a kiss to the side of her head.
Harry frowned. “Well, why not?” He asked. “It’s not because I’m a Gryffindor, or anything like that, is it?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Lose the rest of your body?” He asked. “Shame. You’re not near as attractive now. Or were you going for the ‘gorgeous but not quite all there’ look?”
Finally, Harry pushed his tongue through the tiny ring, and was rewarded with a high-pitched moan of pleasure. Draco’s body trembled beneath his, and the blond pushed back on his tongue, short staccato moans escaping his mouth. Harry thrust with his tongue as well as he could, before he finally gave in and added a finger, pushing it in gently and pulling it out, feeling Draco’s passage quivering around both his tongue and his finger.
They came out in a small, circular area with a table that seated three, four at a stretch, and had floor-to-ceiling windows that made up two thirds of the area. It was bright and cheerful. “This is very nice.”
Harry lay there, with Draco pressed against his back, and worried his lower lip with his teeth. ‘What am I thinking?’ He asked himself. ‘This is probably pure madness, and yet I
Harry chuckled at the compliment. "Why, thank you." He sat up. "Severus thinks he may have found my cure, thanks to your idea today."
Harry smiled at her. “Thanks. That actually means a lot more to me than you’d think. Will you stick by it when Ron finds out?”
As soon as Harry heard the word Bound, he wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and sealed his mouth over the blond’s, tongues twining and duelling fiercely as they clung to one another, riding out their passion.
Nott stared at Draco’s ethereal body, then licked his lips. He slowly ran his hands up the slender legs, realizing that Draco used depilatory charms not only on his legs, but also on his underarms and possibly chest. He looked like a girl, or at least androgynous. He stopped when he got to the boxers, skipping them and laying both hands on Draco’s stomach, resuming his path up the teen’s chest to cup his face, then leaning in for another deep kiss.
Harry raised an eyebrow, smiling at the display. “Wow, Draco, I didn’t know you felt that way about me.” He purred, walking up to the blond.
Draco turned to catch Celeste as she stumbled out of the Floo. “Easy, lover. Don’t fall.” He said in amusement.
After dinner, they went outside. Draco headed to the lake, but Harry stopped him, shaking his head. “Air. You are ready.” He said firmly.
Draco stood proudly as Harry bared his body, glad that he had always been so particular about his appearance. They would be a stunning pair, and with their different attitudes, each one complimenting the other, they would be a force unto themselves.
“No, it won’t.” Harry agreed. “But it will fill the need, at least.” He finished, pulling off his shirt and reclining on the bed nude. He reached for his cock and began stroking, closing his eyes and tilting his head back as he let out a soft moan.
And the next chapter is planned! Thank you to everyone that made suggestions, they helped out a lot! But I am always in the market for more! If you have questions, ask away, it gives me something to write about, too. Suggestions are still welcome, and I will hopefully get this back on track from here!
“Fuck!” Draco arched back, grabbing onto the pillow behind his head with both hands. “Do it! Oh, please, fucking
of our little Cari, let’s take a look at the nursery.” He said, walking to a door in the wall and opening it.
“So, the best date for inducement would be the second day that you’re female, so the twentieth. Does that work for both of you?” Pomfrey asked.
Draco sighed. “You’re going to need to get a decent breath soon, you know. And you really shouldn’t be denying yourself proper oxygen in your condition.” He pointed out.
Draco laughed. “Granger, I think Harry wants privacy.” Draco gasped as Harry’s tongue ran up the side of his neck. “And I don’t think he has the patience to wait for you to leave first, as he’s
are you doing with Slytherins?” Fred asked, throwing himself onto the couch next to Harry, the four of them lounging in the Gryffindor common room.
Harry and Draco followed Dumbledore to the new room and waited while he opened the door. “You can set the password to be whatever you wish, just make sure you do so before both of you leave it at the same time, as it will not open for you again without a password.”
“Let’s see...” Madam Pomfrey cast a diagnostic charm. “Her magic is very depleted. So much is going to this child. Congratulations, Mr. Malfoy, your progeny is going to be very gifted.
Severus inwardly sighed as class continued on as normal. Were there no easy choices to be had in one's life?
on it,” Harry said angrily. “And then come back prepared to either write me off fully or support me in this.”
. Not now that I’ve finally gotten my hands on you. Come on, give me the pillow.” He said, trying to gently pull it away from Harry’s face.
Nott grinned. “Fine, keep your girly secrets. Have you got your money? Thought we could go shopping for a bit.”
Celeste sighed, but couldn’t shake off the squirmy feeling in her gut, feeling like there was a whole swarm of butterflies trying desperately to escape.
Harry, however, was working it. He’d draped his skirt dangerously low on the right side, showing more skin than Draco thought was entirely decent as well as the barest hint of his black lace panties, but
Draco shook his head. “No. It’s always the boy’s fault in Pureblood circles. She’s most likely to blame me.”
He quickly dressed, getting his bag ready for his trip to Nott’s tonight, then headed down to join his mother for breakfast.
“I really do like it here.” Celeste said as they waited for their food. “This will be a good place to live; for our children to grow up in.”
Draco thought for a second, then his eyebrows raised. “You’re right. Hmm… I still don’t want Sev cursing me. He’s
Harry smiled. “She's been doing that a lot lately. I wanted her to be able to surprise you, so I didn’t say anything, but she’s an active little thing. We've got a future Quidditch player on our hands.” He said in amusement.
“Blaise, meet my personal trainer.” Draco smirked. “I knew about the elemental aspect and decided to ask Potter if he’d help me train. You will, right?” He asked with a pleading glance over his shoulder.
. And the fact that there were always lies present when it came to me. At least this is all true. Very much in love, bonded, child on the way—wonder how they found
“I’ll leave you two to start moving in. Enjoy yourselves, and Mrs. Malfoy, please do not overexert yourself. Madame Pomfrey is very good at what she does, but she does not need to deal with complications. Let Draco do the heavy lifting.”
Harry laid down and watched as the Mediwitch cast a charm over his abdomen and a small image of the baby hovered above him.
Harry felt his shoulders relax as Blaise left and the sounds of his ridicule stopped. He studied his book for a moment more, then gave up, sighing. He walked over to Draco and sat on the table next to Draco’s book. “What are we doing?” He asked.
“Hmm, you’re having a girl. Congratulations. Everything looks fine.” She waved her wand again and the sound of a rapid heartbeat filled the air. After a few moments, she nodded. “Nothing’s wrong there either. A healthy baby girl.” She declared.
She noticed a large, red phoenix necklace in the case, and traced its shape through the glass, silently.
to. It’s not like I’ll give in to you until you take back the comment, so why should I give us both a bad night’s sleep? We both know we sleep better together.” He said, getting into bed and wrapping his arms around Harry. “Good night, Love.”
Draco sighed against Harry’s neck, the breath causing the brunet in his arms to shiver slightly. “No, Harry, I don’t think it’s pathetic. He’s older than you, a werewolf, and this revelation could have a multitude of outcomes. He might be angry, hurt, sad, happy, hell, he might not even believe you at first! I’d be terrified about all the what-ifs in your position, even more so now that you have a baby to think about—Our little Delphini.”
Draco laughed wryly. “I’m going to be even more nervous if I have to let you take me without going slow. This way, we can at least work up to it.”
“One healthy baby girl!” Madam Pomfrey announced, clamping and cutting the cord, wiping the baby off with a clean towel before handing her off to Draco to hold while she delivered the placenta.
Harry smiled through his tears. “Alright. I wanted you there with me, anyway. I don’t think I can do this without you.”
“Have you come into your powers yet? You haven’t felt anything weird yet, have you?” Draco asked curiously.
Draco kissed Harry deeply, pulling the dark-haired teen against him and wrapping his arms around him. “Just never hurt me, and I’m yours.” He said finally, staring into Harry’s eyes. “
, I guess.” He shrugged. “Both are good, but I like it more when I’m a male. I feel weird when I’m female and we have sex. It’s strange, but still nice. Know what I mean?”
As soon as the thought flitted across his mind, Harry turned to him, scowling. "Don't call me that!" He hissed.
Draco turned to look over his shoulder at Harry, a look of concern on his face. Obviously, Harry had once again been "broadcasting" his emotions, letting them seep through the bond to let Draco feel the same emotions. The yearning must have him worried.
“Well, shadow and elemental magic, fast healing, and tears that can heal others, you can see what talents others hold, and you can become pregnant naturally with as much ease as a female.” Blaise said smugly.
He screamed as Nott forced his way in, tearing delicate tissues and causing blood to at least ease the friction that was causing Draco to sob and scream and tremble.
Suddenly, another presence invaded Harry’s mind, though it just slid in gently, helping Harry force the other presence out.
“Yellow parlour, cream parlour, a study.” Draco said, pointing out the rooms as they passed. “None of them are likely to see much use, unless we have a party here. Here is the ballroom.” He opened the large double doors and they walked in.
This time when Draco’s lips parted, Harry slipped his tongue inside, deepening the kiss and tentatively exploring the warm cavern. Draco tasted of the strawberries and cream he had had for dinner, in lieu of the cake Mrs. Weasley had made for Harry.
He missed spending time with the Weasleys, feeling accepted for who he was by at least one family. He missed being able to spend time with Hermione and Ron in public places, and he was even starting to miss Colin Creevey and his infamous camera!
“Weas—Er, Ginny. Thank you for supporting him. I won’t hurt him, you have my word.” He said. “I really do think we can be happy.”
Harry’s eyes flashed that eerie glowing green again, and he looked away. “Nu dezvalui ceva asa de intim.”(Do not reveal something of intimate nature.) He said, his voice rough.
He realized that he was also seeing magic around all the charmed things he owned, and could hear the house-elves two rooms away puttering around. Well, he couldn’t tell his mother that he was… Some type of magical creature… Or she’d send him straight to Voldemort, virgin or not. She’d probably use his virginity to let Voldemort mate with him!
“Blood Wards.” Draco explained at her shiver. “Strong ones. These past rooms are only for family. No one else can get to them. Not even the French branch of the Malfoy family can pass them. Only those that hold the bloodline of Aneira Malfoy nee Driscoll can get through them. We will be safe here.” He assured Celeste.
Draco led her out of the room and back through the entryway, down a short hallway and into the dining room.
Draco sighed heavily and wiped his forehead with his sleeve, glancing over fondly at his sleeping husband.
Harry walked up to him. “Go ahead. Take a good whiff.” He said, holding out an arm. “It’s really me.”
Draco laughed. “We can replace that with a stag, if you like. The peacock was my Father’s Patronus.”
now, you tosser!” Harry screamed, throwing another bottle, shampoo this time. He screamed incoherently as Draco dodged the bottles and retreated.
Draco glared at him. “Potter, I’ll have you know that the best way to learn something is to know the mechanics of—”
Draco whimpered as Harry’s hands on his hips guided him in a steady rhythm, moving his hips to meet Draco’s.
Poppy shook her head. “I’m going to let you in on a secret about Harry: he loves very deeply. I’m sure he will stay with Draco no matter what, especially once their daughter comes. He is not the type to leave a husband.”
Harry smiled happily. "A fine choice, Husband." He purred, sliding Draco's shirt off his shoulders slowly, tracing the pale, toned arms as they were bared to his gaze. "I promise, you
Harry shook his head, still walking. “We will sleep.” He said shortly, his tone sincere and warm with emotion.
Poppy smiled. “I’m very firm in my belief that Harry will stay with Draco. I’ve seen them together, and there is a deep and abiding love there.”
Harry sucked him clean, then stood back up, releasing Draco’s wrists and kissing him, sharing the taste of his own essence. He hugged Draco tightly, lightly kissing the side of the Slytherin’s neck, as his hands slid over the small of Draco’s back.
." He continued with a small smirk. "Besides, it's going to take some time, so you will see far creepier from me, make no mistake." By the end of the speech, his voice had become lilting and sing-song, and Harry almost found
Harry pressed the end against Draco's entrance and the blond's hands fell away from his face as he raised his head and looked down at Harry in shock. "What the bloody hell do you think you're—
He cast tempus and cursed, setting down the vial and changing out of his work robes, replacing them with the ones he normally wore to intimidate the students.
Draco frowned. “I know. Father always casts the charm while his hair is wet, which is why I don’t do it often, but I’m not going to wander around with my hair like
, my head.” Draco groaned, and then grinned stupidly, realizing that this must be his first hangover. Then his face fell as his head throbbed again. ‘I
Celeste sat at a table near the back of the room, relaxing and watching the other girls mill around, chatting and snacking and having a good time.
Blaise smiled smugly. “She says Happy Late Birthday. It’s silver, and it has self-cleaning charms and works as a portkey. If you ever need to get out of a tight spot, this will take you into our house. You’ll end up in my room since that’s where you always head anyway.”
“Well, that’s most likely where the problem stems from. It’s hard to feel sexy when you’re feeling sick, Dear.” She reached over and patted his hand. “Don’t worry, your morning sickness may abate in a few weeks, and your sex drive will return when you’re no longer feeling sick all the time.”
Harry snuggled against Draco’s body. “I think it’s time for bed, now. After all that, I could use some sleep.” He said, tensing a bit as Draco’s wings appeared, covering them both like a black feathered blanket.
“I’ve decided that Polyjuice may not be the answer. I’ll need a vial of your blood.” He said, holding up a small vial. “I’ll need another when you are female.” He added.
a haven from the wind and the cold. Warming charms will become your friend while outside, but You’ll be unable to resist going out, even with the chill, because the grounds and gardens are
Draco sighed, stepping into the warm water and glancing over at Harry, who was standing shamelessly naked under his own shower, washing his hair.
“Do have one, thanks. I think it’s a rather nice one, too.” Draco added, smirking as Harry looked over at him, his eyes unmistakably drawn to his crotch. “You really think anything would be showing? My trousers are spelled not to show embarrassing bits, Potter.” He said, then chuckled.
“I know. If he ever masters shadow magic, then decides to switch sides, we’re doomed.” Harry said jokingly. “But then again, I don’t think he wants to be mated to Voldy.”
Draco jumped, turning to see Harry looking at him. “Privacy not one of your strong points, Potter?!” He sneered, covering himself. Or, rather, trying, as his hands didn’t quite do the job.
He hopes it won’t be too awkward with Harry ignoring him and being so distant but after all, the ride is only half an hour so hopefully, it won’t be too bad.
He wraps his arm around Draco’s waist and pulls him close to his body. The other hand wraps itself around Draco’s throat, and he kisses him. Draco kisses back with just as much passion and want. This was probably the best idea they’ve ever had.
Harry sighs. “But that's the problem. I don’t want to get with just anyone. The people here either go crazy for me, which scares the shit out of me. Or they faint the moment I talk to them. Trust me, these are bad conditions for a hookup.”
“You’re a freaking Gryffindor. Grow a pair of balls and tell him how you feel!”, Ron argues and shakes Harry’s shoulders.
Harrys sighs and begins to roll his hips into the mattress. "You're going to pay for this, Draco. I'll make you suffer five times as much."
“Hello, nice to see you all. My name is Professor Malfoy, I teach History. Some of you may already know me.”
They step outside the bathroom half an hour later, both adjusting their trousers and trying to look as innocent as possible. Draco grins at Harry and presses a kiss to his cheek. Harry blushes and giggles like the lovesick teenager that he is. They look around, but it turns out that no one actually cares about them, since everybody is already gathered outside.
It’s almost like a book, it can tell stories. But the images are already acted out on the screen with sounds. The pictures move fluently.”
The moment he looks around if anyone saw that embarrassing encounter, he catches a glimpse of Malfoy bickering and giggling. Harry can’t stop the smirk on his face the moment their eyes meet.
“And then it kept happening. But we were always intoxicated when it happened. We kind of made this agreement that we would have sex to relieve some pressure.”
“I guess you’re right”, Harry says slowly. It’s strange admitting this out loud. “Draco might actually be the best-looking guy in our year.”
Draco feels like suffocating. He tries to focus on his book but he can feel Harry so strongly next to him. They're not touching, but they might as well be.
He begins to collect his stuff and puts it back into his backpack. "Thanks for letting me study here."
Draco manages to get through his lecture pretty well, the boy with the emerald green eyes is almost forgotten.
When Friday finally comes rolling around, his friends are all motivated to go to the Leaky Cauldron again.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry tilts his head. He really wants to squeeze Draco’s hand and give him a quick kiss. Nothing sexual, just a quick affectionate kiss. He clenches his jaw and forms his hands into fists, trying hard to keep himself from touching Draco. Just friends, he reminds himself.
But still. Harry had always felt a weird connection to Malfoy. For years, he strangely obsessed over the blonde boy, blaming him for every single bad thing and putting so much energy and effort into hating him. And now that the hate is gone, his obsession technically should have left too. But he still searches the classroom for him. His eyes still land on Malfoy in the Great Hall during breakfast. He still watches him during class. He still thinks about those impossibly soft curls and those grey, sad eyes.
“Okay,” is all that Harry brings out. He feels nervous all of a sudden, but in the right way. His stomach is fluttering in anticipation.
His leg bounces up and down, he searches the Great Hall for Draco, but he can’t find him anywhere. Maybe he’ll see him at dinner.
Harry nods, runs a hand through his sweaty hair, and tries to catch his breath. “I have no fucking idea. That was fantastic.”
Draco breathes out in relief when he’s finally out of the close proximity. He runs a hand through his hair, straightens his pale blue button-up shirt and sits back down. Merlin.
Harry sits on the floor, next to the huge chimney in the Room of Requirement, and warms his feet. He watches Draco, who’s been reading a book for the past forty minutes.
Draco nods. “Yeah. Please don’t take it seriously. It’s honestly meant as a joke. I don’t know. It’s stupid.”
Draco places himself in front of Harry’s entrance and teases him with the tip of his dick. He lets it slide across Harry’s entrance a couple of times without actually pushing in.
Draco obeys him, grabs his waist and pulls him even closer. Harry begins to undress Draco. He helps him out of his sweater and throws it to the ground, unbuckles his belt and pushes Draco's jeans down. Then, he undresses quickly, leaving them both in their boxer shorts.
“Harry!”, Draco screams, fully sobbing now. “Please don’t do this to me. I need you inside me right now, please, fill me up, it hurts so much!”
Draco snuggles even closer, squeezes his arms around his torso, and burrows his nose in the space between his ear and neck. Harry shivers.
“Don’t stress yourself, I can go grocery shopping. Send me the list of things you need and I’ll buy them for you.”
He grabs Draco’s elbow and guides him to the corner of the kitchen. They both sit down on small stools and watch the elves work their magic.
Harry bites his lip, trying to suppress a groan. He’s starting to sweat, he feels way too warm. But he doesn’t stop. He wishes he could freeze this moment and stay here forever, with Draco.
Draco blushes. “Um. Well, I’m trying to. I can’t guarantee that it will actually taste nice. I’ve never really cooked before.”
She presses her lips together. After taking a long sip from her cocktail, she sighs. “We’re friends with him too, you know? We thought it’d be nice to invite him.”
Harry sits down in the front row and puts his head on his hand. “I’m really looking forward to it. Even though I technically don’t have time.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco shrugs. “I want to try. I never really made an effort to learn anything about them. I always did what my father told me. I copied his opinions, beliefs, and attitude towards muggles. I want to educate myself and have my own opinions, you know?”
“Potter. It’s already fucking weird. We’re not friends. We’re not enemies. What is there to lose? We’re not risking anything here. Fuck, we don’t even like each other. No feelings, no attachments, no risks. Just a one-time thing.”
“Harry.” He takes his hand and shakes it. This feels awkward. Especially with Ron standing next to them.
Harry seriously contemplates apparating to London for a night out and look for a nice, quick fuck. But he knows that’s against the school rules, so he tries to get a grip on himself. He really doesn’t want to get in trouble for leaving the school grounds even if he’d probably get away with it.
Harry licks his lips. This conversation is making his head spin, and he doesn’t know what to say. “Yeah, anyway. Whatever.”
Draco opens his legs even further, allowing Harry to slip inside even deeper. They both let out a desperate cry at that.
Hermione watches him for a moment. She’s probably considering whether she should say something or if she should give Harry some space.  Then, she simply shrugs, collects her books, and leaves the classroom without looking back at Harry. He's never felt more appreciative for his best friend.
Then, Draco leans down in one swift movement, wraps his arms around Harry’s shoulders from behind, and presses a kiss to Harry’s cheeks. “Thank you. This was the best Christmas yet.”
He shakes his head, takes a deep breath and closes his eyes for a second. When he opens them again, he’s staring into intense green eyes looking right back at him. His breath hitches in his throat and he feels a mix of embarrassment and arousal.
The guy doesn’t get it. He runs his fingers up and down Harry’s arms. He lowers his lips, and the moment he tries to kiss him, Harry loses it. He grabs his wand with one hand, the other wraps itself around the guy’s neck, and he pushes him against the wall.
She smiles and looks around the room. “Did you know that Snufflings can jump up twenty feet into the sky?”
Harry nods and grins. He puts his bag down. „Sorry I just came from the gym, I didn’t have time to shower.“
This is absolutely amazing. Harry has never felt like this before. And then, he opens his eyes and looks at the man in front of him. He watches Draco’s face. He notices the fluffy and tender state of Draco’s blonde hair. He realizes how smooth and soft Draco’s skin actually is. His eyes slide lower to Draco’s throat. Harry feels a strong desire to kiss his neck. He’s never seen someone so
This feels so much more intimate than Harry has ever felt with anyone. He wants to do this forever, wants to feel Draco, wants to kiss him, to take care of him, touch him and make him feel good.
Once they're finally in Draco's flat, they immediately get rid of their wet, sticky, soaked clothes.
Harry frowns. Draco Malfoy, attractive? Harry has never really thought about that. Why would he? He had focused too much on absolutely hating his guts. And then, once the war was over, after they’d been through so much, after they’d grown out of their constant fighting and mutually agreed on behaving like adults for once, he had worried about things being weird between them once they would return to Hogwarts. Harry still doesn’t know how to face his former enemy. But Dean’s words make him think. Harry was always intrigued by his eyes. Draco does have beautiful eyes. And his hair is extremely fluffy, the softest hair he’s probably ever seen. Harry wonders if it actually feels as soft as it looks like. Draco is tall and slim, but Dean is right, he does have a nice ass. Harry’s just a man, and the boys have competed in Quidditch too often for Harry to not check out Malfoy’s bum in Quidditch attire.
For a few moments, Harry doesn’t feel anything. Wasn’t there supposed to be rainbows and butterflies? But the moment he puts the bottle down, it’s almost as if a warm blanket is thrown over him. He smells fresh wood, vanilla, and hot chocolate. The room turns warm and cozy; he feels relaxed and light. His muscles don’t hurt anymore. His stomach feels fluttery, and his heart beats in a calm, steady rhythm. The world feels safe and calm.
Draco squirms underneath him. Harry’s hands go lower and lower. Eventually, he grabs Draco’s arse cheeks with both his hands and begins to massage them. He kneads them thoroughly, spreads them apart, and strokes Draco’s hole every now and then with his fingers.
Harry actually laughs out loud now. He tilts his head back and wipes away a few tears forming in his eyes.
When he looks up, his eyes land on messy raven hair sitting a few tables away from him. There's no way Harry has noticed Draco since he's sitting in a hidden spot.
Draco lets out a desperate moan, feeling the sensation of Harry’s big cock against his own. He squeezes Harry’s arse and presses him down even more.
Harry chokes on his sandwich. He coughs and takes three large gulps of water to swallow it. “No. Absolutely not. I don’t even care about him.”
Then, Draco’s knees fall open, allowing Harry to push inside even deeper. Apparently, Harry must’ve done something right, because Draco’s head rolls back with a scream. “Fuck, right there!”
Harry seems to follow Draco. Sometimes he “accidentally” touches Draco’s arm, then he “accidentally” stumbles so that he almost crashes into Draco. One time, his
“Alright, folks. Let’s head home, shall we?”, he says with a hoarse voice and it comes out miserable and sad.
He rolls his head back and tries to adjust to the new feeling of Draco’s extended finger, pushing in and out of his hole. He’s being gentle, but it still stings.
So, Harry stays quiet and follows Draco. Draco seriously is a master at potions, Harry thinks. The moment he sits down in one of their classrooms, he begins watching Draco gather all of the needed things, and the other boy starts to brew.
Draco opens his mouth in disbelief and desperately wants to argue that there isn’t anything that could be “discussed” but Harry raises his glass of wine and smiles at
Draco quickly stares at his book, avoiding Harry’s gaze. Harry knows him well enough to know that he’s blushing. “I don’t know, Harry. Won’t they be disappointed if you don’t spend Christmas with them?”
Harry can’t think straight anymore. The heat, Draco’s groans, his soft skin, it’s all too much and not enough at the same time. Harry speeds up the pace, moving in and out of Draco so easily, he thinks their bodies must be perfect for each other. Sex has never felt so good.
Harry grins. Then, he starts to push into Draco. He’s rough and quick. He doesn’t try to be gentle, just like Malfoy had told him to. His fingers sink into Draco’s hips. There will probably be bruises tomorrow. He slams into him harder, quicker. It’s making him sweat, but it’s so fucking good. He can’t think of anything else but Draco.
Harry chooses not to answer. Instead, he snuggles into the blankets and pulls Draco’s arms tighter around his body. “Please stay with me for the night.”
Harry holds his breath. He doesn’t want Draco to think that he’s getting onto him. Harry doesn’t find Draco attractive. Sure, he’s a handsome man. No one would argue otherwise. Anyone who says differently would be blind and delusional. But Harry doesn’t want to
Harry doesn’t recognize that voice. He turns around with a frown and stares back into black eyes. The guy is handsome, no doubt. Tall, black hair, dark eyes, and a stubble. His jaw is sharp, his skin looks smooth, and he has a broad back. Harry forces himself to smile.
Draco wouldn’t say his love life was nonexistent. He simply put his heart and soul into his studies in order to become a professor of history at the age of 30.
They end up discussing questions for about an hour until everyone feels satisfied and happy. Draco hands them the sheets and tells them to be on time.
Harry feels the need to explain. “I got used to not eating breakfast during the war. Everything was so stressful and hectic. We barely had time to shower nor eat. My rhythm is still fucked up. I’m barely hungry nowadays.”
kissed Draco. He’s a freaking Gryffindor, after all. He’s all about bravery! Why does he feel like such a coward around Draco?
He doesn’t move, too scared to wake Draco up. What would Draco say? What would he do? Will he avoid Harry from now on? Will he act differently? So many questions are running through his head while images of last night haunt his mind. Merlin, how is he ever going to --
Harry comes right then and there. He groans, spilling inside of Draco and bites on his shoulder. He strokes Draco one more time before Draco follows Harry over the edge and collapses on the bed.
"I was wondering if I could study here. I like your office, it has a really nice atmosphere. I promise I'll be quiet."
“Wow, this is really hard to explain. Okay. Um. So, we have this box. We call it a television. Televisions receive signals, and they can turn those signals into moving pictures and sounds.
Harry knew it wouldn’t be easy returning to Hogwarts. He had tried to mentally prepare himself. But standing here in front of the castle, all of his foolish preparations come crashing down on him. He swallows the lump in his throat as he tries to fight the images flashing before his eyes. This year would definitely be interesting.
Draco follows him close after. The moment he comes, he starts to tremble, groans and moans, and tenses in Harry’s arms.
Then, he heads to the door. Before he leaves, he turns around one last time. "Just for the record: I'm not seeing anyone either. See you on Tuesday!"
“Oh my god, Draco”, Harry sighs, his voice filled with fake outrage. “You’ve been missing out on so much!”
Harry sighs. He gets up, his legs are shaking. He’s never felt more nervous in his entire life. Without turning back to check whether Draco is following him or not, he moves towards the bathroom. When he pushes the door open, he realizes how small it actually is. Oh, Merlin. This isn’t going to end well.
Harry can’t fight back the bubbly feeling inside his chest. He wishes he could, but it’s so strong, he can’t push it down. “Sounds good.”
Draco sits down in front of Harry and grabs his hands. “Potter, stop being such a little chicken. It’s not like I’m taking your virginity or anything. It’s just about sex. We both get something out of this. Okay?”
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know. You don’t seem very open-minded. And I don’t want you to think I’m coming onto you.”
Harry frowns and watches Draco's hands. They're actually shaking. "You never tremble. You're the calmest person I know. Are you okay?"
Harry smiles. He tenses his body, trying his hardest to think about anything else. He should not be thinking about how badly he wants to kiss Draco, how good the other man smells, how soft his hair looks, and how pale his skin is. Harry clears his throat. He nods and continues eating his bowl of spaghetti. Once they’re done eating and cleaned everything, Harry drops onto the sofa again.
“This was very interesting, Professor Malfoy!”, a girl with bushy brown hair and freckles on her face says. “I’m really happy you’ve arranged such an amazing trip.”
. I’m sorry, mate. It seems like you actually have to stop being a dick and talk to Draco like a normal, mature grown-up man. That must be so bad.”
It makes Harry feel all sorts of strange things when Malfoy's face lights up, when his eyes start to sparkle in excitement and his lips turn into a huge smile. It's even worse when he gets praised in front of the class. He seems so much younger and softer then.
“Merlin, Potter”, Draco groans. “We fucked so many times, do I really need to tell you again? Fuck me, use me, be rough, I don’t give a fuck. Do something, please!”
Whatever they were expecting, it probably wasn’t the huge cramp that follows. Draco almost falls to the floor if Harry hadn’t caught him just in time.
“So, you two really want to be friends now? No kissing, no sex, nothing? After shagging your brains out for the past three months?”, Ron asks.
Then, his hand closes around Draco's arm, sending shivers straight down to his cock. Draco must feel it too, judging by the way he flinches and hisses at the skin contact.
Then, he straightens his own T-shirt, buttons up Draco's shirt and fixes Draco's hair. He lets his own hair be messy, there's no difference to its usual state anyways.
“For real?” Harry asks and moves away from Draco. He doesn’t want to allow him to back away now. “And you said
But for some reason, he enters the lecture hall on Tuesday with weird anticipation and a tingle inside his chest.
Is this a thing now? Them hooking up and getting breakfast afterward? Harry doesn’t know the rules, and he’s incredibly confused.
When Harry wakes up the next morning, he feels pleasantly warm. He slowly starts to notice his surroundings and feels arms wrapped around his waist and a leg thrown over his. He smells Draco and smiles. He missed waking up next to him so much.
This doesn’t sit well with Harry for some reason. But at the same time, he also doesn’t want to say no.
Draco shakes his head, his eyes glistening. “I really don’t care. I’m over the moon. You’re the best! Thank you.”
When they take a walk through Hyde Park, Draco purposely walks closer to Harry, but Harry keeps himself busy talking to the girl Hermione or her ginger boyfriend and Draco feels empty without Harry by his side.
“Only because you were flirting with him! And I was right, three minutes later you walked up to him and kissed him!”
But Draco nearly runs to the closest loo. He desperately needs to get away from everything. He feels so hot and aroused, and sweaty. His trousers are too tight and he needs some space.
Harry bites down on his hand, suppressing a scream. “Fuck, Draco feels so good. You’re so hot, fuck. Please, touch me.”
An awkward silence settles between them again. And although Harry wants to say something, anything, he doesn’t.
Every time he walks around campus, he searches for Harry. The campus is huge, therefore he hasn't seen him yet, but he still keeps his eyes open.
Draco blushes and presses his lips together. “I’m starting to think you’re not paying attention during my lectures.”
They all order another round of drinks. Hermione, Luna, Dean, and Neville head to the dancefloor, ready to party. But Harry and Ron stay behind. He doesn’t feel like dancing. He wants to find Draco.
Draco eventually places the two plates in front of Harry. There’s eggs, bacon, avocado, and toast. Draco even conjures some coffee and orange juice, and Harry can’t help but think that this might actually be the best breakfast he’s had in a long time.
starting to get out of hand when after one of his lectures Harry asks him if he’s doing any smaller seminars or workshops soon.
Draco sighs. He stares at his glass of wine. “Mother wants to visit relatives in France. She doesn’t want to spend Christmas in our little apartment.”
Draco puts his hands on Harry's waist and pushes himself up, grabbing him tightly and slamming into the boy. Judging by Harry's moans, he's not being too rough with the younger boy.
Harry grunts. They don’t say anything for a while. Harry manages to calm down and takes a step closer towards Draco. He wants to say something, anything, but he doesn't know what to say.
He does try, but he doesn’t succeed. It’s pure torture at this point. The lesson feels like a thousand years, and when it’s finally over, Harry jumps up in relief. “I’ll go for a walk.”
„We‘ll take the train on Thursday morning and get right to it once we arrive in London at 11 am. The first stop will be the National History Museum, we‘ll spend approximately four hours in there.“
He’s so thankful that they have touring guides in each museum so that Draco doesn’t have to focus on speaking since Harry is everywhere.
Therefore, Harry stops his movements and tells Draco to turn around. He takes off his shirt, his jeans, and his own boxers, throwing the clothes away carelessly. He conjures some lube into his hands and rubs Draco’s hole with it. He’s already so relaxed. It’s easy for Harry to push a finger inside.
Draco leans against the door and takes a few deep breaths. Harry’s head is spinning. He can’t think clearly anymore; the alcohol is running through his veins.
For the rest of the night, he hides away, mostly staying inside. The living room is much quieter and cozier than the tent anyway. He stays close to his friends and sips on different juicy cocktails, slowly getting drunk. It’s okay. It’s great, actually. He notices how much he missed chatting and laughing with them. He still can’t believe how they accept Harry’s bullshit without any terms and conditions. He sits down next to Luna on the couch and snuggles closer to her.
Ron licks his lips. Then, he slowly speaks. “You know, Hermione spoke to Pansy. And Pansy said that their gang might come with us.”
Harry turns around and watches Draco smile at the tree. He radiates so much joy, peace, and happiness – it actually makes him look much younger and softer than he actually is. It’s insane, looking at Draco now and comparing him to the Draco before the war. Harry can see the difference right before his eyes and it makes him incredibly sad to think what Draco must’ve been through during that time. He vividly sees War-Draco in front of him – the frail, skinny boy with huge circles under his eyes and a frown gracing his face every single day looking like death himself. Harry’s heart swells at the sight of a happy, soft, peaceful Draco and he realizes how utterly fucked he actually is.
It’s small. There’s no real entrance hall. They step inside and immediately find themselves in the living room. Huge windows are allowing the light to get inside, a chimney in the corner, and a huge dark green sofa.
Harry closes his eyes. “I’m sorry you have to go through this right now. And I honestly couldn’t care less about the past. We were both behaving like immature dicks.”
He holds his breath and throws his phone on his bed. Then, he lets out a silent, frustrated scream. He is pathetic. Why does he care so much? Even Greg, his cat, looks at him disappointed at what his owner has become - a pathetic man with an embarrassing crush!
“Fuck!”, he screams as he comes inside Draco, his fingers sinking into Draco’s delicate skin. He feels dizzy and breathless and so, so good.
They kiss for a while, hands exploring each other’s bodies. Every now and then, Draco’s hand brushes over Harry’s dick, sending sparks through his body. Harry bites into Draco’s lip and reinforces his grip on Draco’s biceps.
He isn’t brave enough to ask him though. Something about Draco makes him lose his confidence. November passes so quickly, Harry doesn’t even know if the four weeks really happened in the first place. They’re all so busy studying, they don’t have one spare second for themselves. All Harry does is study, eat, train Quidditch, and sleep.
He feels steady hands rush forward, holding him by the waist, and keeping him steady. “Easy, easy, Potter.”
They slowly grab their belongings and walk outside together. It’s cold. There’s a thick layer of snow covering the grounds of Hogwarts and some students are outside, throwing snowballs at each other. Harry can’t bring himself to feel excited. He feels the heavyweight between him and Draco.
Neville and Harry enter the small room. “Don’t tell Molly. But I brought my favorite new plant to the Burrow. The Hexophelitantrum. But she’s being a tiny bit … bitchy.”
He can’t tell Ron that, for obvious reasons. But Ron still watches Harry through worried eyes. “Man. You’re behaving really weird today. When was the last time you and your mysterious guy hooked up?”
When they go to Hogsmeade together to get some butterbeer and to buy some bits and pieces, they walk next to each other, and Harry would only have to lift his hand a little for their hands to touch. He clenches his hand into a fist to stop himself from reaching out.
Gently, he pushes in a second finger. He tries to open Draco, lets him adjust to the new sensation step by step. Every now and then, he strokes Draco’s back for comfort. After he’s added a third finger and pushed in and out for another couple of minutes, Draco nods.
Harry snorts and lets himself fall back down onto the sofa. “You’re crazy. I was always one step ahead of you, Malfoy.”
Draco licks his lips. “Well. I analyzed your hair structure, researched a bit. Long story short, I made a potion. For your hair.”
Then, Harry removes his mouth and conjures some lube into his hands. Slowly, he enters one finger into Draco’s tight hole.
Harry giggles and instead of watching the movie, he watches the way Draco’s eyes light up or the way his lips flinch every now and then. He wants to move closer. Harry feels this desperate need to reach out and touch Draco’s arm or run his fingers through his hair. He wants to hold his hand and squeeze it. Harry wants to kiss Draco and hold him tight. Instead, he clears his throat. He stands up and walks into the kitchen to get some snacks.
, you idiot. Have you ever looked at yourself? You’re the most beautiful man I’ve ever met. Inside and out. I couldn’t confess it back then. It was embarrassing to admit that I, a former Death Eater, former enemy of Harry freaking Potter, found you attractive. I knew that you didn’t find me attractive, therefore I couldn’t admit it. I was too proud.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry is as hard as Draco must be by now. He rubs soft circles onto Draco’s arse cheeks, occasionally squeezing them and running his nails over the soft skin.
“Are you okay?” Draco asks. His voice is quiet and concerned. Harry doesn’t understand when exactly they’ve started to act like this around each other. This soft and caring and understanding.
He fights hard against the urge to pull over and offer Harry a ride. He couldn’t just drive his student home, for God’s sake! But eventually his self control shedders and he parks right in front of the bus station.
Harry walks into the kitchen first, slowly turning around. “Um”, he starts. “I know we agreed not to give each other presents. But I have something for you.”
Harry licks his lips and pulls Draco’s cheeks apart. He strokes Draco’s hole with his finger, teasing his entrance with it. Then, he leans lower and begins to lick Draco’s thigh. He wants to drive Draco mad. He wants him to beg for it. Draco is already panting heavily, but Harry wants more. He wants to hear him cry. That’s why he licks over Draco’s hole once. Just once.
Draco’s back arches, and his fingers turn white as he grabs the sheets. “Oh, god. Yes. That’s what I’m talking about.”
After one hour and a half, there's a break. Some students buy drinks, the others go out to have a smoke, some stay in the auditorium.
, Draco,” Harry breathes, and then both his hands slide under Draco’s arse, holding him up and spreading him open and squeezing.
Harry, for once, enjoys his special status. The man thanks Merlin and all the stars in this world for getting him out of the lesson that quickly. He grabs his bag and his cloak and rushes out of the classroom, ignoring Ron’s frowning stare and forgetting the piece of paper on the desk.
Could rose hips, which had to come from plants that had never been touched magically, be the answer he had sought? They were
Draco sighed unhappily, turning back to his potion. 'I wish you weren't so sad. Maybe you can tell a
not!” Draco denied her whispered accusation hotly. “If we hadn't been able to soul-bond, I would have insisted we move into
“Blindfolds.” Draco answered simply. “We’re not allowed to look with our eyes. We need to do this by touch and sound alone.” He elaborated.
Harry smiled and shook his head. 'I'm fine.' He thought to Draco, deliberately sending the thought into his Bonded's mind. 'Don't get too distracted.'
Granted, the brunette was staring up at the sky, but then again, Draco was better able to hold him that way. He had decided that he wanted to be able to carry Harry easily during flight in case they needed to escape, or in case Harry needed a better view to find Voldemort.
“So, Golden Boy, let’s see if the wolf taught you anything worthwhile.” He teased, as Harry drew his own sword, that he had been practicing against Remus with.
Harry was still lying in bed nude when Draco returned, except that now he was no longer hard and had a sated smile on his face.
“And functional.” Draco added as Harry swung. He parried, the metal striking ice with a chiming sound. “And stronger than any metal on Earth. I
I’ll find you beautiful no matter what, Love.” He told Harry, wrapping an arm around his waist. “You’ll be growing with my child. You’re giving me something I never thought I’d get with you. You have to know how much it means to me.”
Draco chuckled, bringing his other hand back to Harry’s belly. “Stop hurting Daddy.” He said. “He doesn’t deserve to suffer from your tantrums until you can throw them in person, young lady.”
Harry went to open them and stepped outside into a garden. There was a bench and a small dining table outside, both with charms around them to repel unwanted bugs and water. “Frumos.”(Beautiful.) Harry said lightly.
Harry laughed at that. "Somehow, Draco, I get the feeling you're too cock-hungry to be satisfied by one go 'round." He told the blond.
Draco sat next to him, pulling Harry’s hands from his face. “No, it’s fine. You’re a very sexual creature, and I shouldn’t have said something suggestive. Eventually, I’ll be yours. For now, we’ll be careful.” Draco said.
“Depends on what it is.” He said calmly. “Talk to me in the library at eleven. I’ll be there, but I’d like to finish eating first, if you don’t mind. Your new looks are a bit distracting.” He said, giving Draco a quick once-over. “When did you do the ritual?”
Harry and Draco both smirked and laced their hands together, following her as she headed for defense.
Draco watched him from the bed as Harry carefully applied his make-up, covering the scar and accenting his lovely eyes. “You look beautiful, Love.” He said once Harry was satisfied.
"Yes, they recognize my magic there, and that hasn't changed." Harry explained. "I just need to speak with Griphook personally again."
“Got it. Don’t worry, my cravings have so far been for healthy stuff.” He said, making a face as he remembered the liver and onions.
“I’m on top.” Draco said shortly. “Since I am not pregnant. The magic will see you as the female partner, so for this to work, you have to bottom.” He said nervously. He bit his lip when Harry didn’t respond. “Is that okay?”
!” He shouted, running his hands through his hair. “All I said was that maybe a motherly figure to talk to wouldn’t go amiss, since she doesn’t know exactly what to do to keep the baby safe and healthy yet!”
Harry watched him undress with hooded eyes. “Mm, so you’re still going to sleep with me?” He asked in a teasing tone.
? What if he-“ Draco glanced around, finally seeming to notice where they were, and that this conversation was best conducted in private. He pulled Harry into the common room, cursing, and then rounded on the teen. “What if he tells someone that blabs to the Prophet? Was I wrong in thinking that you wanted to keep this a secret?” He hissed, scanning the room for other occupants. Luckily, he saw none.
“I still need food, even if you don’t. You need to feed your food, or it’ll die, Love.” He said jokingly.
Draco pressed three fingers against Harry’s opening and whispered a lubrication charm. All three slipped in with little resistance.
Harry just shook his head and thrust once more into Draco, stiffening as his orgasm rushed through him.
Narcissa sniffed and smiled. “Oh, Draco, you’re going to be a father! A little girl! Oh, thank you for letting me be here for this!” She said, turning to Harry.
Draco glanced back. “Did it sound like one? You tell me, Golden Boy!” He shot back, then laughed, doing a few loop-the-loops and then going into a steep dive. He pulled up at the last second, but his toes caught on the ground, and his concentration was broken as he hit the ground with his hip and skidded a good three meters on his side.
Blaise nodded to Draco, then turned and led the way out of the common room, the other seventh years forming a circle around Draco and Harry, shielding the couple from view.
Draco nodded. “I did. And then I saw you sleeping. You looked so cute and tired that I didn’t have the heart to wake you. You looked like you needed it.”
my idea of a good time.” Draco snarled, gritting his teeth as he forced the water to freeze and shape itself into a sword, rather than sink into the dirt it rested on.
“Gods, you’re hot when you’re angry.” Draco said, shoving Harry against the slick locker room wall and fastening his mouth over the Gryffindor’s.
Draco chuckled. “Well, come on, I came and got you for a reason.” He said pulling her toward a store.
Until the door opened again. “Draco, you are sleeping in your bed tonight. I expect to see you after dinner, in my chambers,
Draco cursed and stood, grabbing her bag as well as his own. “Hospital Wing.” He said shortly, and Blaise nodded, scooping her form up in his arms and leading the way, Draco hot on his heels.
Harry raised an eyebrow but cut off a small section and popped it into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully. “Hm. Tastes kind of bland, to me.” He said.
Draco just shook his head fondly, holding Harry close. He’d never figure out his husband/wife. But, then, that was part of the allure that drew him to the enigma that was Harry Potter in the first place.
. The baby needs to be fed, at the very least.” He mused, then leaned in to kiss Harry. “Yes, let’s get up and get ready.” He said, sitting up in bed.
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed Harry onto his back. “Calm down. He won’t find us.” He reassured Harry, lowering his mouth to the brunet’s cock and taking it into his mouth.
Draco hummed, then smiled slightly. “Thanks. Um…” His smile faded. “I also have other injuries…” He motioned to his backside awkwardly.
Draco pressed a line of soft kisses down the top of Harry’s spine, stopping right between the base of both shoulders. “Nothing on the upper back, either.” He whispered, his voice sounding just the slightest bit breathless.
Draco hummed. “I suppose it will work.” He lit a fire in the fireplace and settled Harry onto the couch. “You sit here, and I will be right back.”
Blaise sighed. “Neither. I’ll keep an eye out for you. Dray, you need to stay as far away from danger as you can. Promise you’ll be careful this summer. I’ll visit when I can.”
Draco chuckled and pressed a kiss to Harry’s shoulder, then recoiled in disgust. “Ugh, you taste like soap!” He exclaimed.
Blaise laid her down. “I think pregnancy might be too much for a body that used to be male.” He said softly after checking they were alone. “She’s been doing so well lately.”
Harry lets out a moan himself. Merlin, this is so much hotter than he had anticipated. Who would’ve thought that Draco Malfoy, out of all people, would go crazy for Harry’s cock?
“Saturday, we’ll visit the National Gallery, take a walk through Hyde Park, and visit Big Ben. In the evening, we’ll go to the London Eye and at 9 pm, we’ll take the train back to London. Any questions?”
Draco turns around to see the person waiting in line behind him. His eyes widen at the sight of the young beautiful student in Nike sweatpants and a black sweater. His hair is sticking up in all different directions and his cheeks are a wonderful rosy colour.
Hermione tilts her head and a deep frown forms between her bushy eyebrows. “Harry, you know I love you. But avoiding him will only make things worse. You’re behaving like a coward. I really think you should talk to him.”
He decides to only focus on his job, his profession. Draco loves being a professor and he wouldn’t let one beautiful student distract him like that. The thing is, many students are attractive. Draco isn’t blind. There are many attractive, athletic boys walking around on the campus. Most of them are studying medicine or sports or law. But no one has taken his breath away quite like the boy with the messy hair and green eyes.
When Harry puts his lips on Draco's chest and begins biting it, Draco sees stars. He can't focus on anything else but Harry's hands, Harry's lips, Harry's cologne. Harry.
Draco sits down at the round table in the kitchen and watches Harry get out some tomatoes, pasta, zucchini, cheese, and lentils. Then, Harry begins to cook Spaghetti Bolognese.
Besides, he doesn’t really want to know why the age gap is so important to Harry anyway. Thinking about it makes him feel dizzy because it's something that Draco has thought about too. He checks his watch and realizes they’re only 5 minutes away from the agreed meeting time.
“This is nice”, Draco exclaims softly, eating his spaghetti. He seems so much younger. Harry wants to hug him and protect him from the world. Merlin, he needs to get a grip.
"I think we should take a shower", Draco grins. "You know, just to get warm again. We don't want to get sick, right?"
What would his coworkers think? What would his students think? He’d have the image of a nerdy professor who uses his status of power to bang his students. Draco groans and gets up. He can’t lay still in his bed any longer.
And then, after his lecture, Harry walks up to him and chats to him about the lecture, about the things Draco explained, what Harry found most interesting, what Harry didn't understand.
“Fuck”, Harry moans into the kiss and begins to undress Draco. He opens the buttons on his pajama shirt and lets it slide to the floor. His hands find the waistband of Draco’s sweatpants and he begins to push them down.
Harry watches him and eventually nods. He closes his eyes and quickly dozes off. Draco doesn’t even notice when Harry’s head sinks down onto Draco’s shoulder, it happens so softly and it feels so natural. But when Harry nuzzles his nose into his neck and wraps an arm around Draco's waist, Draco feels a thousand butterflies inside his stomach and he is so utterly fucked.
Draco begins to move against Harry, rubs himself on him, and Harry never thought he’d enjoy this as much as he does. He loves allowing Draco to be in control.
Harry is screwed. He really is. And he’s also finally ready to talk about all of this. He’s at a point where he desperately needs his friends’ advice.
„And what’s so crazy about a guy that’s like 6 years younger than you? I’ve dated people who were 10 years younger and it never was a problem.“
“Why don’t you ask him out on a date? Just the two of you, no drugs, no sex. And then you can get to know the real him.”
Harry begins to stroke Draco’s hair gently. He doesn’t really know what to say. It confuses the hell out of him, seeing Draco so vulnerable, and all he wants to do is kiss him, hug him, squeeze him, and make him feel better.
Draco presses his lips to Harry’s forehead. “What did you dream about? You kept shouting and kicking me.”
But then, there are also terrible ones like the one he's reading right now from someone called George Weasley. The poor boy didn't get the memo that he was supposed to write about the historical politician Napoleon and not about the company Napoleon producing grills.
Draco raises his leg, allowing Harry to hit him even deeper. They both let out a desperate cry at that.
Draco hesitates. He seems more tense than before. Eventually he points towards a tiny, brown bowl on the left. "Hm. Yeah, you can cut this Bats' spleens."
Harry had thought that returning to Hogwarts might give him a break. He thought he might actually have time to get into a serious relationship. He was ready. He had the time and was in the right headspace. He wanted to be in a relationship for once. With Ginny, everything had been so rushed and forced. It hadn’t been the right timing and it definitely hadn’t felt right. It was meant to break apart eventually.
Harry nods again. He’s suddenly very nervous, even though he’s never nervous about sex. He’s a confident guy. He’s got nothing to worry about. But something about Draco and something about this situation make him feel incredibly nervous. They walk back to the room of requirement in silence.
“Didn’t see you at breakfast nor lunch the entire week,” Draco introduces himself and puts his bag down on the table. "I thought we agreed on you eating more regularly."
Draco doesn’t answer him. Instead, he collects all the necessary information for his planned trip. He fills out some papers from his university in order to get permission for his field trip and puts them in an envelope ready to send them away later.
“I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t attend my lectures, he doesn’t accept my calls, he doesn’t text back.”
He starts picking up a few papers, either throwing them in the trash or putting them away, grabs all the pencils lying around and puts them back to where they belong.
Draco begins to bite his neck. He can feel himself growing harder each second. Draco’s hands roam all over Harry’s body, making him shiver. Finally, Harry turns around in Draco’s arms and begins to kiss him slowly. There's much more passion between them this time. There’s no need to rush anything.
Harry stops in his movements and thinks about that for a moment. Draco doesn’t sugarcoat things, and he definitely isn’t obsessed with Harry. Yeah, maybe that’s why they get along. At this point, Harry doesn’t know anything anymore. Also, he doesn’t want to read too much into it. Draco told him he’s not into Harry. It’s just about sex. They’re not dating. They’re not getting into a relationship. They’re not even friends. It’s –
“Okay, okay,” Dean eventually says. “Ginny, you are the judge. Who’s the better kisser: Harry or me?”
Fuck this. Fuck Draco, fuck feelings and screw this stupid agreement that they have. Fuck thinking, fuck falling, fuck being horny. Fuck.
Draco shakes his head. "When I'm in a relationship. But currently I'm not in a relationship. So I'm not cuddling anyone at the moment."
Harry sinks into Draco's arms and lets his head fall against his chest. He wraps his arms around the younger boy and presses soft kisses to his throat, jaw and neck.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry hums in agreement. He missed it too. Now that he’s finally in bed with Draco, the world makes sense again.
“Yeah. It’s lovely so far. But speaking of Christmas. You know what?”, Draco says as he sips on his glass of wine and turns another page of his book.
He drives out of the parking lot and just around the corner when he sees someone standing in the rain at the bus stop.
He’s so close to coming, the heat becomes almost impossible to bear. He’s sweating, he feels out of breath, but he doesn’t stop.
Ron wants to continue arguing with him, but Hermione grabs Ron’s arm and stops him. “I think it’s a good idea, Harry. Get to know each other. Build a friendship. The rest will fall into place.”
Draco gives his best friend a death glare and takes a bite of his lasagna. " I don’t want to talk about it anymore. This conversation is giving me a headache.”
Harry apparates them to the location of the little house. They land a few feet away from the house and Harry immediately hears the swooshing of the ocean and breathes in the clear air.
Draco’s hands go lower, they rest over the buttons of Harry’s jeans and begin to unbutton them. He helps Harry jiggle out of them and finally roams his hands all over Harry’s body. Harry’s head rolls back. He lets Draco work his magic, allows him to do anything he wants to do.
Draco shakes his head again. "No, I'm not so keen on unnecessary body contact. If it's with someone I find attractive, then it's not a problem. But with anyone else, it is a problem."
Harry nods. “You know, I’m pretty sure nothing ever would have happened between us if it weren’t for the Veela thing.”
“Still. He wouldn’t have spent all of this time with you if he found you annoying and ugly. He obviously cares about you. And who knows, maybe he feels even worse than you do because he thinks you’re not interested in him!”
"I can't go back in there now. I'm so fucking hard. I can't sit next to you for one and a half more hours.", Draco cringes at how desperate and needy he sounds.
Ron sighs. “Harry, man. Since when are you such a bore? We could dress up, get drunk, and find you someone nice to shag.”
“Fantastic”, Draco mumbles and stares at the silver iPhone in his hands. “Muggles are fascinating. I had no idea they were so clever.”
Draco presses a kiss to Harry’s hand. “I’ll miss you too, Harry. You have no idea how much I’ll miss you.”
Harry knew it was a bad idea the moment Dean had shouted: “Party at the Leaky Caldron!” But he didn’t have a chance. Ron had dragged him all the way to Hogsmeade, even though Harry had protested the entire time.
Draco grabs Harry’s shirt and guides them both to the bed. They fall into the sheets, Draco on top of Harry. Harry immediately runs his hands all over Draco’s body. He feels this desperate need to be closer, so much more intimate. He wants to taste all of Draco and never let go.
Harry opens the bathroom door and takes a deep breath when he’s finally alone. He reliefs himself and then goes to wash his hands. It’s all too much. He regrets coming along.
Harry feels a shot of disappointment run through his body. He shouldn’t be feeling this way and he quickly tries to push down those feelings. He grabs Draco’s shoulders and squeezes him. “I will miss you.”
well. But I also make hair potions for Blaise, Pansy, Longbottom, and a few others. They’re always happy with the results.”
Draco's eyes open wide and with one finger, he guides Harry's head to look at him. "Are you serious?"
It’s pouring rain and Draco watches the gym anxiously for half an hour now. He just needs to get out of his stupid car and walk up to the receptionist and tell them he needs to confess his love to the most wonderful man he’s ever met. Can’t be too hard, right?
"No", Draco quickly says "That's not it. I believe he's very interested. I mean, I'm not sure. But he visits my lectures."
Hermione, Molly, Ginny, and Luna have prepared a big party over the last few weeks. They’ve invited every wizard and witch they roughly know. Harry feels exhausted by simply listening to Ginny reading out names who are invited.
They eventually leave him alone. Harry finally feels a little calmer now that he’s by himself. He begins wandering around the castle, turning left, then turning right. He doesn’t really know where he’s going until, all of a sudden, he finds himself at the Room of Requirement. He opens the door without thinking about anything in particular and steps inside.
"I wish I could take the exam in your lecture. Yours is so much more interesting", Harry sighs and steps forward to the counter.
Harry shakes his head. “Yeah, I still don’t get what happened that night. It’s all a blur to me. Draco’s behavior didn’t make any sense.”
“I guess I’m not the tough guy. I care about other people’s opinions. I worry about not looking good or not being popular. All I really want is to let go of all that. I want - I
Once he’s finished giving his lecture, the students rush out of the lecture hall leaving Draco to himself. Well, almost to himself.
Then, it all happens quickly. Draco moves forward, grabs Harry’s face with both his hands and presses his lips on top of his. Harry gasps for air. He feels taken back by Draco’s sudden action.
This is it, Harry thinks. Now or never. He might never have the chance to make a move again. Even if it means risking everything and losing Draco. Harry needs to try. If there’s a small chance that Draco actually likes him back, then Harry has to try. Adrenaline is pumping through his veins as Harry jumps up from the chair. Merlin. He’s actually going to do it. He’s going to risk it all.
Draco feels dizzy walking back to their seats. He gets clogged up by Harry's cologne and really hopes that no one notices how flushed and worn out Draco looks.
Draco shrugs, but his eyes don’t leave Harry’s. “I was horny. I have a free period, and I really could use some...
Harry simply nods and grabs Draco's hand. He leads them upstairs to Draco's bedroom, Draco's nerves building up inside of him more and more every second.
Harry hasn’t noticed him yet, or at least he’s pretending he hasn’t seen him yet. He takes a few more drags of his cigarette and throws it down onto the street. Draco frowns as he notices dark shadows on Harry's unusual pale face.
There, a few balconies away stands the man of his dreams and his worries, smoking and shirtless. Is Draco dreaming? He must be hallucinating. Now he's officially gone mad, Merlin. Draco falls back to the wall and watches the man silently. How could anyone be this beautiful? It’s truly not fair.
Draco comes first, his cum spreading all over Harry’s dick and hand. With the new sensation, it doesn’t even take a second for Harry to come himself, with Draco’s name on his lips.
He opens the box and sees a banana, a yogurt, a croissant, a sandwich, and a few crackers inside. Harry is speechless. He looks up at Draco, who keeps himself busy looking through his bag again.
Draco lowers his head and begins to suck Harry’s sensitive skin. Harry’s moaning loudly at this point.
They stay like this for a while, both heavily breathing and panting, trying to come down from their high. Then, the boys both start to giggle.
Harry can feel Draco’s dick pressing into his stomach already. He feels relieved knowing that the whole scenario in the bathtub didn’t leave the blonde boy cold either.
It all would have been fine. Draco finishes his lecture, smiles at the applause he receives and starts packing away his stuff. Then, he waits for the beautiful student to approach him again. Instead, the boy exists the lecture hall talking passionately to a male student with bright red hair. Draco frowns.
Dinner at the Great Hall feels oddly normal. It’s almost as if the war never had happened. Students are cheerful, everyone’s laughing. A warm atmosphere is surrounding Harry and his friends. For a moment, he loses himself in happiness. He tries his best to ignore the stares and whispers directed at him.
Then, he feels a hand on his back. He turns around and sees his best friend smiling at him. "Neville, glad you could make it!"
Harry wakes up from his trance and watches Draco limp towards the shower. He’s fully naked now and Harry has a perfect view of Draco’s wonderful, round arse. Harry gulps. Shit, he feels trapped.
Harry furiously blushes at his confession. Merlin, why does he have to be so fucking awkward all the time? He just fucked Draco Malfoy into a mattress, making him moan as his life depended on it. Why is it so hard to confess the obvious then?
His hands are clenched in fists, his jaw is tight and his muscles are trembling. Harry has never seen anyone in this much pain, not even the Cruciatus seemed this bad.
He’s surprised when he feels Draco’s lips on his neck. He sucks gently at first, then he starts getting rougher. Draco’s left hand begins to cup Harry through his boxers, making Harry moan loudly. He didn’t think that Draco’s pure hand would feel like heaven. He’s never felt like this with anyone before.
Everyone’s here: Molly, Arthur, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Charlie, Bill, Percy, George, Fleur. It’s wild at the Burrow, and he loves it.
“We have a deal. I brew him potions, he gives me ingredients, since he has access to the greenhouses.”
Draco snickers. “No, no. Sorry. I just didn’t expect it to be this cozy. I mean, it’s very Scandinavian chic.”
Harry shrugs. “Yeah, why not? I’d rather spend Christmas with you, knowing that you’ll actually enjoy yourself than spending Christmas at the Burrow, worrying about you.”
Instead of talking, they listen to their assignment. Draco takes notes and Harry is thankful for it because he doesn’t really listen at all.
Draco nods eagerly and lets Harry push him on the bed. Harry falls on top of him and continues to kiss Draco as if his life depended on it. He feels like he’s falling, deeper and deeper into the unknown. When Draco’s tongue licks his bottom lip, begging for entrance, Harry’s mind goes blank. His dick is throbbing painfully as he rolls his hips up against Draco and moans. “Fuck, Draco!”
When Draco announces that he will take a long, warm bath, Harry jumps up and rushes into the kitchen. He has a plan. A special surprise for Draco. Even though they agreed on no presents and keeping Christmas as casual as possible, Harry can’t help himself. He wants to make Draco happy.
Neville grunts. “That is a big, fat lie. Everyone finds you attractive. Even straight guys would fuck you.”
He needs Harry. The realisation hits him hard after the fourth week without him. Draco finishes his lecture and stares into the lecture hall, eyes searching for Harry but he’s nowhere to be seen. He feels empty and lost and wants to cry.
Harry sighs. Then, he throws back the entire thing. It burns in his throat and makes him cough. “Merlin. That is
Draco grunts in annoyance. Harry can imagine how pleased Draco must be to accept Harry Potter’s help of all people.
Draco takes a deep, steadying breath. They've done everything you could imagine doing - except for that one last, most important step - Sex.
He hasn’t told any of his friends about Draco. But they know him and Harry couldn’t lie to them anyway. So, he explained that he had a date with a special someone. He didn’t want to drop the name, and they had accepted it.
Harry sighs. “I told you it never was about feelings. We were just having sex. And now that we agreed to stop, we’re trying to be friends.”
snogged the hell out of that stranger! How did you even see me kissing him when you were busy making out with somebody else?!”
Not breaking the kiss, he guides them to the bed and pushes the younger boy on top of it gently. Draco crawls over Harry and sinks down on top of him, causing them both to moan.
Draco tilts his head. “I see. But you'll have to eat eventually, you know? It's pretty concerning how little you eat."
Yes. I don’t know. I enjoyed it. I actually loved it. It was really good. But I regret it because we didn’t talk at all afterward. But why did we just stop talking for an entire month?”
Harry nods, now understanding the whole situation in Potions earlier. "Me being close to you started this whole thing?"
“How did you know I – um. I - “, Harry doesn’t know how to finish his sentence, but Draco understands.
Harry sits down on the bed. He frowns at the scenario in front of him but decides not to say anything. After all, Neville always accepted him for his bullshit. He’s not going to give Neville shit for stroking and flirting with a plant.
He enjoys the sex, the kissing, the cuddling. He even enjoys falling asleep next to Draco. If it’s all just the Armortentia, it feels crazy real.
The group of friends chats for a while, talking about Christmas and Christmas presents, self-made cookies, and Christmas markets. Harry feels peaceful.
Harry presses another kiss onto Draco’s neck and then carefully slides in all the way. He swears, he sees stars at the sensation of being inside Draco’s tight arse.
Harry barks out a laugh. “Matter of fact, I do know. I was able to have a sip of one of your potions once or twice.”
Harry’s chest tightens. He wants to hold onto him and never let go. But then, Draco straightens his back, turns around, and leaves the bathroom.
Draco grins and sits down next to him. “Don’t worry, it’ll be brilliant. You know, I’m really good at potions.”
“I haven’t seen you this excited in a long time,” Hermione notices a couple of days later at lunch. She watches Harry eat enthusiastically as his legs bounce up and down.
Harry wipes a tear away and stops him. “I need more than flirting, banter and fake fancy dinner dates. So call me when you’re ready for more.”
Draco smiles, and it looks so genuine and sweet. His eyes light up, and they shimmer, his dimples are showing, and his cheeks turn even pinker. Harry thinks he’s slowly becoming obsessed with seeing Draco happy at this point. He doesn’t want to think about that. He doesn’t want to think about how utterly fucked he really is.
"100 per cent?", Draco repeats, looking for any sign of doubt or uncertainty in Harry's eyes. He finds none.
When Harry wakes up a couple hours later, he knows something is wrong right away. The bed feels empty and cold. He reaches around, but Draco is nowhere to be seen.
Neville looks at Harry with hopeful eyes. “Oh. Are you finally going to talk about that mysterious boy? We’ve all been dying for you to finally open up!”
Harry reaches over and turns on the light. Then, he gets up and does some stretches. He hasn’t worked out in almost a week and his muscles are beginning to feel sore. Maybe a little stretching will help him relax and then he might actually fall asleep.
Draco stares at his glass and sighs. “I like guys with dark messy hair, smaller than me. I like green eyes and a muscular body.”
So Draco nods. When he gets up, his hip brushes Harry’s hand accidentally. A shot of fire shoots through his body straight to his cock. He takes a sharp breath and avoids looking at Harry, instead looks down. He can feel the heat coming from Harry’s body. Since the aisle in the train is so small, Draco has nowhere to sidestep to.
Harry’s head snaps around. He knows right away who that person is. He could recognize that voice even in his sleep.
“Because I don’t want to go back to how things were. I want them to stay like this forever. I want to be with you forever.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco slows down, pushes into him in a steady rhythm, turning this whole fuck into something more intimate, passionate and slow. He can feel his orgasm slowly building up.
This is stupid. Harry probably isn’t even interested at all. Why would he? He doesn’t even study history. He probably only asked because he wanted to be nice and -
Draco grabs the sheets, while Harry continues to move his fingers inside of him. “You. Your muscles. Your hands grabbing my ass, my arms, my legs. I imagined you kissing me, hard. I thought of you pushing inside me, painfully slow. Then, painfully rough.”
"So you're interested in gender studies and also feminism, I suppose. What else are you interested in that's somehow related to these topics?"
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry tilts his head. Now that he looks at Draco from up close, he does realize that he seems tired and more pale than usual. There are dark shadows under his eyes. He wants to ask why, but Draco cuts him off. “Do you like it? Breakfast?”
Draco’s mouth opens in a silent cry, his eyes are tightly shut and the hand around Harry’s waist begins to squeeze tightly. “Harry, I’m -“
With strong hands, he begins to massage the oil onto the soft skin of Harry's back. Harry moans with each stroke, squirming underneath Draco's touch.
Harry smiles. “I’m saying this because I actually want to spend Christmas with you. I’d absolutely love to get away with you.”
Harry sighs in relief and wraps his arms around Draco’s torso. He breathes in Draco, closes his eyes, relishes the moment. This feels like home. Harry tightens his arms around Draco and presses his lips to his neck. They stay like this for a while, until Draco removes his arms. Harry feels cold and wishes Draco would have kept hugging him.
Draco had been monumentally patient with Harry’s cravings, but apparently, there was a limit to what he could handle watching his beloved eat.
Blaise nodded understandingly. “In time, you’ll start wanting it. It can be good, and you’ll find someone that will make sure it is.”
Harry leaned in to kiss him again, then nodded. “Sure. Mione is leaving soon. Should… We go to… Our new room? After?” He asked, smiling slightly as he flushed at the thought of sharing a private room, and the promise that Draco had made about what they would finally be doing tonight.
Suddenly, his door was thrown open and he found his wand pointed at Draco, who had tumbled through the doorway.
Harry cupped his mate’s ass through the jeans he was wearing and groaned as Draco’s erection slid over his own. He shivered as Draco responded with another thrust of his hips, and Harry realized that the blonde was frotting against him. He gripped Draco’s hips, thrusting up against the Slytherin desperately, panting.
Draco sighed, nodding. “I agree. She can help us figure out what exactly this is going to do to you. Um, Harry?”
Harry gracefully knelt in front of Draco, and the blond felt all the air leave his lungs as Harry dove eagerly onto his shaft, taking him to the root.
Harry shook his head. “No, but you made Carina kick me in the spleen, or something. Little blighter.” He muttered.
“Come on, your… Teeth are clean now. Get in bed so I can… Ravish you.” Harry purred, smirking at Draco.
Draco began moving again, faster this time, purposefully working to bring Harry off. He had no idea what had prompted the sudden decision to engage in exhibitionism, but he was going to take the opportunity while he had it.
‘Maybe if I wait, the urge will pass.’ He decided, hearing angry muttering coming through the door still.
Draco moaned in denial as Harry raised his head, leaving only his finger in Draco, lazily twisting and thrusting. “More.” He whined, staring up at the incubus entreatingly. “Please?”
“This is cozy.” Draco remarked in amusement as Harry pulled the blond onto his lap, holding him close.
“You’ll taste every ingredient in food separately. It can be off-putting with most foods.” Blaise said, shrugging. “You can eat Elven food without problems.”
Madam Pomfrey cast a spell and an image of their baby appeared above Celeste’s abdomen. “Three, four preferably so Celeste will be female again, but if we must, I can do a caesarean delivery. Ideally, we are going for a more natural delivery.”
But, somehow, he had a feeling that he and Draco were going to be just fine. They'd do whatever it took to make their child happy and healthy, and he knew that there was nothing they couldn't do between the two of them.
was the kind of passion Draco was afraid he could never feel after what had happened to him, and here it was, staring him in the face.
However, he wanted his child to know some of the people that were important to him, and would be able to share stories of what his dad… Mom…
that. It’s just… He doesn’t like homosexuality. And his views on it are rather strong.” She said. “He gets a little overzealous.”
Harry smiled when the dildo was fully seated. "How does it feel?" He asked Draco, genuinely interested. He hadn't used it on himself yet.
Draco smiled a bit sadly. “Mother roomed in a different room in this wing while we visited. By then, she and father were already seeing other lovers. There was very little love there, in the end.”
Draco groaned and rolled onto his stomach to bury his head in the pillow. “Great. I’ll expect a Howler, then.”
Draco cast a quick spell at the classroom door, smirking when it flared gold briefly, before the light faded again. “Sev, you
Draco sighed in pleasure at the action and let himself enjoy the touch. Harry and he were destined. They were made for each other, and now he had irrefutable proof. He was able to let himself enjoy any touch Harry gave him, because he had no reason to feel guilty about giving himself to his mate.
“We should really write her while we’re thinking of it.” Draco said, getting up and walking over to Harry’s desk. He sat down and began composing the letter. “The appointment’s this Saturday, right?” He checked. “I’ll have to send Imperious, he’s the only one fast enough to give her at least two days’ notice. She’ll be upset if she doesn’t have enough time to prepare.”
“Magic,” Harry said, drawing his wand and summoning a pot of tea and two cups, along with sugar and milk, “Is not something that can be explained. You have it, or not. I think elemental magic would be the same. Either you can use it,” Harry poured himself and Draco tea and added milk and sugar to his, then stirred and took a sip, smiling, “Or not.” He finished.
“Surprised by this,” Harry said, grinning at the twins, “But if you can’t get past it, I’m not going to try to hide who I am from you. We’ll just have to admit that some things can’t last forever.”
Then he choked, turning and staring at the black wings coming out of his back. He felt sick at the thought of what would happen if he told his mother. ‘I don’t want to join Voldemort, especially not to take advantage of being a magical creature! Merlin, please let these be retractable!’ As he was thinking this, they folded and sunk into his back, leaving only thin scars behind, easily hidden by clothes. “Oh, thank Merlin!”
need to remove all of my things that I intend to keep.” He explained. “But there is plenty of time for that.”
Draco gasped, watching Harry stare up at him, a look of absolute rapture on his face as his eyes locked onto Draco’s and his tongue massaged the underside of the blond’s shaft. He sucked lightly, and Draco moaned, his head hitting the wall behind him as his eyes slid shut. “Merlin.” He breathed.
present!" She hissed, indicating the far end of the table, when the first- and second-years were grouped.
, Master! Old Masters didn’t care if new elves were born, they just named them when they were old enough to start work! Wes didn’t know if it was still okay or not!” She looked down at the floor, dejected, then mumbled, “And Tipple bes such a
“I’m glad you approve. I'd never ask you to live in a place you didn’t like.” Draco said. “But I definitely don’t want to live in Malfoy Manor with Mother there. Visiting is one thing, living with her quite another.”
Harry stood as Severus walked up to the table he was at in front of Florean Fortescue’s ice cream parlor. “Sir.” He said happily, then sat down, arranging his red day dress around his legs carefully.
The potions master had stopped by him on his way out of the great hall, telling him to visit his office as soon as he was finished eating, alone.
Draco chuckled darkly, pulling his fingers out and casting one more lubrication charm on himself, he once more found Harry’s entrance with his fingers, then positioned himself.
Draco bit his lip in thought. “I suppose you can go to her with your concerns. Due to your delicate condition, we may even be able to get her a visit. She’d have more reason to be here than anyone, save Arabella. And she
“Well, research has shown that things like famine can affect the next three generations to be born. It’s so that if the famine continues or recurs, the youngest generations will be the best equipped to survive regardless.” Draco said gently.
Harry traced the phoenix resting in the hollow of his throat and smiled. Draco was a hopeless romantic, and spoiled him, but Harry just couldn’t be mad about it.
Draco melted into the kiss, letting Harry lead him back to the loveseat, lying down with Draco atop him.
“Well, despite what happened, you aren’t mated to… Him. You will, however, be mated to the first person you
Harry threw his head back, groaning as Draco continued to stretch him, ignoring the plea that Harry had given him. Harry was about to scream when Draco’s mouth descended onto his pulse point, sucking hard.
Draco flushed. “Yes, I wanted to know everything about you. It's full of lies, of course, but I didn’t know that.”
Draco huffed, then stalked out of the room, heading down to the Quidditch pitch alone. He stood in the center, then unfurled his wings, slowly flapping then, getting a feel for how they moved.
Ginny bit her lip. “I think so. But don’t ask me to fight with him for you. He scares me, to be honest.”
Draco moaned as Harry traced his teeth with his tongue, then wrapped his tongue around Draco’s, pulling it into his mouth to suckle at it, making Draco wonder just how much that talented tongue was capable of.
Harry finished cleaning Draco, and slid back up his body, kissing him and wrapping his arms around him. “Was it good?” He asked hopefully, pulling Draco atop him.
!” He whispered, touching his face. His features were even more delicate than before, his lips fuller, his eyes more vivid and striking, and his hair longer and silkier, not to mention it was almost silvery now.
Three elves popped into the room, all wearing light blue pillowcases. They bowed to Draco and one of them announced, “There bes a new elf, Master Draco! He be needing a name!”
Harry took a deep breath. “I have a confession to make.” He stated, then dropped the voice-altering spell and Vanished the dress. “I didn’t die.” He said, letting Remus see the familiar clothing.
Draco chuckled softly. “The area atop the hill is very windy, and can be downright chilly in every season but summer. But the house is aptly named. It’s very warm and the windows are extra thick, so it truly
“Yes, let’s. Next two rooms are on the opposite end of the ground level.” He said, leading her out of the ballroom and toward the other end of the house.
Harry growled around his length, then deep-throated him and growled again, the vibrations concentrated around the tip of Draco’s length.
Draco cocked his head. “So you can only speak with your mate until you’ve bonded? To keep you away from others?”
Harry shook his head. “Nah. I actually have Occlumency with Snape, and hand-to-hand combat with Remus and the twins, and Bill is coming to teach me some curse-breaker-type stuff I may need to know. I’ll be busy. ‘Sides, I can fight with Malfoy for a change of pace.”
to find out, how do you think the rest of the world is going to react?” He asked irritably. “You should just go home, think about what you tried to do last night, and think
“It’s the least I could do to repay what you have done for everyone else, Mr. Potter.” She said before leaving the room.
Once Harry was washed, Draco rinsed him—thoroughly—and pressed a kiss to his collarbone, since Harry was once again facing him. “Much better.” He said in relief.
Draco moaned happily in his sleep, feeling a warm body behind him. He froze, and looked over his shoulder, wide awake as he saw emerald green. “How the hell...?”
“Acid Pops.” Draco nearly sighed, sagging briefly as the stairs began moving. He straightened his spine and went up, the Headmaster’s voice bidding him enter as he got to the top.
Draco’s wings twitched happily at the word. “Soon, Love. Soon enough.” He promised, then got out of bed carefully.
The two teased each other with looks and moans, trying to get the other to break first, both unwilling to back down.
Harry batted his eyelashes innocently at the blond, who just huffed and turned his attention back to Severus.
Harry smiled as Madam Pomfrey waved her wand and the sound and image disappeared. “Of course. I had some questions to ask, if you don’t mind. We figured you’d be the best choice to ask, since I don’t have a mother of my own anymore, so...?”
Draco beamed at him, nodding. “And managed to swamp Potter in the process!” He added, then chuckled.
Draco stood and walked up to her, wrapping his arms around her. “Don’t worry about it. I’m sorry, too. We’ll just put this behind us and move on, shall we?” He asked, pulling back a bit and smiling winningly at his wife. “So, what do you say we go into your room and brainstorm with Pansy and Millie, so you have a list of questions for either my mum or Arabella, whomever you decide to ask to see, hm?”
Draco moaned, melting into the kiss and wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. When Harry pulled away, he licked his lips and nodded. “Okay.” He agreed.
Harry closed his eyes, melting as Draco’s warm, gentle hands splayed against the small of his back, pulling him in for a kiss.
Draco got annoyed after Nott had spent the past ten minutes pawing his legs and chest, running his hands hungrily all over his body. He had never before had to suffer through helping out a friend in need without at least enjoying it himself.
Ginny leaned close to Draco, who had been staring at his lap the entire time, his cheeks slightly pink. “If you ever hurt him, I will cut you open, neck to navel, and bathe in your blood by the light of a full moon. If you make him happy and treat him right, I wish you two the best of luck.” She whispered calmly, surprised when Draco looked at her and smiled.
'I heard that, Golden Boy! Let me have my moment.' Draco mentally berated him, sending a dark glare over his shoulder for emphasis.
Draco grinned. “It’s at the top of a hill, but there is a village at the base, and they speak English there. They can make friends close by. The village is magical, so they won’t have to hide their magic from them. They don’t mind us, as long as we respect them and their ways, they let us be and give us our space.” He told the other teen. “You'll like it there, I think. It’s beautiful.”
He grabbed Harry’s hands and pinned them on either side of his head, lacing their fingers together and pushing forward slightly, barely opening Harry’s entrance, letting the dark-haired teen feel it, but not entering yet.
Polyjuice could be made permanent without releasing a deadly amount of toxins, if only there were a way to brew it
Draco moans and moves his own hips into Harry's leg. Then, he moves the finger inside of the younger boy, curls it and teases him with as much care as possible. Harry radiates so much heat, they're both beginning to sweat.
Draco wants to get up, already straightening his back. But Harry’s hand rushes forward, grabs his wrist, and holds on tight. “Stay.”
At this point, he wishes he could just forget everything. The good thing is, he doesn’t see Draco often. They don’t have that many classes together, and there’s no reason to go and look for each other anyway. They’re not friends. The bad thing is, Harry
Harry can’t hold himself back any longer. He slams into Draco with full force, grabs his skin tightly, and he’s sure there’s going to be bruises tomorrow. “Draco! Fuck.”
“Harry,” Draco moans as he begins to push his hips into Harry’s. Harry swears he sees stars at the sensation. “Harry, I need you to fuck me. I need you to be inside of me. Merlin, I need all of you. Need to feel you, taste you. Fuck me, please.”
The moment he steps inside the party tent, he feels overwhelmed. The music is too loud, there are people everywhere, everyone is laughing. But that’s not why he feels overwhelmed.
Draco opens his eyes and slowly turns his head to stare at Harry. Harry’s eyes are dark, filled with lust. Draco breathes hard and feels himself getting more aroused with every second.
Draco gathers his things, grabs his cloak and runs out of the Dungeon's as if he's being followed by a dangerous animal.
“I kinda took advantage of the situation, I guess? You being desperate and horny and hot and all”, Harry eventually forces himself to say but immediately regrets it. He doesn’t want Draco to hate him for taking advantage of him during a private and intimate moment.
"I hate to say this", Draco eventually speaks up "but I need your help with this. I need to put exactly 2 mg of powder into the cauldron but my hands are shaking."
Draco is unconscious and unable to move nor speak, so Harry does the only logical thing and picks up the limp body. He carries Draco to the bed and puts him down gently.
Harry surges forward. He grabs Draco’s face with both his hands, presses his lips against Draco’s, and lets Draco decide whether he wants to push him away or continue. He’s not moving, his lips pressed against Draco’s and waits patiently for something, anything.
The boy simply shakes his head. “Oh no. I just wanted to tell you that your lectures are my favourite. I think you’re the best professor in this university.”
Draco feels even more proud of himself. He can’t believe he managed to pull this off. Even his coworkers praise him for his fantastic idea and his fabulously written request.
He’s now sweating furiously and looks as if he’s about to pass out. Harry watches the room desperate for help but is surprised when he finds a cosy room with a nice bed in the middle and a huge shower on the left.
He feels like screaming and kicking everything around him. How can one guy have this effect on him? Draco seems to be in a constant state of blushing and being aroused. Thank god, the other students are too engaged in the tour guide to notice Draco’s state of despair.
Draco only hums in agreement, kissing Harry’s chest instead. He can feel Draco’s steady heartbeat, feels every part of Draco’s skin. He swallows the moment and never wants it to stop. He can’t believe he’s lying here next to Draco Malfoy after they’ve shagged their brains out. But Harry wouldn’t want to change a single thing.
Draco stares into green eyes and gets lost for a second. Then he nods. “No problem. The rain was awful.”
Draco begins to dry Harry’s hair with his wand. He brushes through Harry’s jungle of hair and tries to tame it.
Draco blushes and stares at the boy in shock. He wasn’t expecting that. “Thank you. I’m very pleased you enjoy it so much.”
Draco wants to do this forever. He wants to fuck Harry every single day, wants to clean him up after, wants to cook him a nice dinner and cuddle with him while they're watching Netflix. Draco wants to kiss him, wants to take care of him, touch him and make him feel good. The realisation hits him hard.
But then he quickly had to learn that his mind, his body, and his heart didn’t really follow his orders this time. Maybe something of that potion got stuck in his body and is making him fantasize about Draco now. Perhaps he didn’t actually get sober. Maybe, it’s changed his mind forever.
Of course, one student stays. At this point, Draco is so used to having Harry around after and before lectures it doesn’t even make him that nervous anymore.
Harry nods. “Yeah, I know. It’s more than complicated, actually. I just want him to have a good Christmas this time. I mean, what’s the worst that could happen? It won’t end in a disaster, I promise.”
“You need to loosen up. It’s not exactly illegal. I’m only visiting one of your lectures this semester and I don’t even have to write an essay or something. You don’t
“I have to suffer through this, even if it might kill me”, Draco finishes, eyes still closed. He tenses his whole body, clearly signalling another cramp. “Fuck.”
Draco’s mouth opens in a silent cry, his eyes are tightly shut and the hand around Harry’s begins to squeeze tightly. “Harry, I’m -“
Draco positions the camera in front of them shuffles closer and grins into the camera. “Smile, Harry!”
Draco thinks about Neville's words for three days before he eventually decides that maybe he is a drama queen. Maybe this whole situation isn't even as bad as Draco makes it out to be. Maybe the boy is simply interested in history and is intrigued by Draco's knowledge and intellect.
Neville shrugs. “Yeah, I agree. I mean we’re just talking about looks, and Draco does check all the boxes. Besides, I think he's really changed a lot since the war.”
Harry swallows thickly. His eyes flicker between Hermione and Ron. “I really, genuinely love him and I don’t want to lose him.”
Harry winks at him and guides him to a fancy Italian restaurant. “I hope you like pizza and pasta. This is the best place in London.”
Harry looks at him confused for two seconds. Then, his eyes light up when he recognizes Draco. “Yes!”
“Yeah. I really don’t fancy the idea of spending Christmas with distant relatives I don’t even know that well.”
He’s so close to coming, the heat becomes almost impossible to bear. He’s sweating, he feels out of breath, but he doesn’t stop. “Ohhh”
Harry frowns. “I don’t really know. Sometimes, they’re so clear and vivid. And at other times, I’m just left with the feeling. I felt horrified and lost.”
Harry’s brain logs off. Any chance of thinking clearly is now over. His dick reacts to Draco’s body. He feels hot all over. His hands find Draco’s stomach, and he pulls his shirt up to touch Draco’s incredibly soft skin.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry presses his lips together and watches the beautiful man in front of him. A thousand thoughts run through his mind.
That’s why Harry stands in front of the mirror, checking himself out for the tenth time and adjusting his wild, messy hair.
Harry should’ve known that returning to Hogwarts was going to change everything. He kind of had expected everything to go back to normal. He would see all of his former classmates, he would go to his classes and do his homework. He'd hang out with his friends, play some Quidditch. Yeah, life would be easy and great. Harry had expected everything to be the same even though he’s smart enough to know that after
Draco’s head snaps around, grey eyes staring into green ones. Neither of them says anything. Draco seems lost for words, his cheeks rosy, his lips glossy, the hair a mess and his hands clenched into fists. He’s never looked more beautiful to Harry. Harry’s madly in love with him, he realizes then. It’s a miracle to him how he pushed it all away until now. Fuck, Harry’s probably been in love with Draco from the moment they first kissed. It all seems so fucking ridiculous now. The Armortentia, the denial of feelings, lying to himself, running away from it all. He should’ve been honest with himself. He should’ve talked to Draco sooner for god’s sake. Harry was such an idiot! How could he ever fool himself and everyone around him and pretend he wasn’t in love with Draco? It's all crystal clear now.
Hermione giggled. “Dumbledore obviously thinks you’re at least as strong as Harry.” She pointed out.
Draco relaxed, cuddling up close to Harry. “I think it’s time for breakfast.” He said finally, drawing a groan from Harry.
Draco ran a leg over Harry’s, enjoying the closeness, even as a bit of nervousness intruded. If Harry wanted more, Draco would give in, though he knew he wasn’t quite ready for that yet.
“Come on, let's get into the room and start deciding what to bring over when we go. Might even be time for a quick tumble before dinner.” Draco added with a leer.
Draco's laughter echoed in his head. 'Be careful that you know all possible meanings of the words you are using. Or you may end up with a spell to clean your room that effectively banishes all your possessions forever, like Flitwick once did.'
Draco shrugged. “Whatever this is,” He said, pointing his fork at a dark red paste over some kind of root, “It’s
Harry immediately pulled him close, wrapping his arms around the blond and tangling their legs together. He kissed Draco softly, sliding a hand into the blond’s hair, marveling at how silky it was. He sighed into the kiss, feeling Draco tremble against him, kissing back shyly.
Draco felt his heart swell with joy. Love. He was loved, despite his father, despite his inheritance, and despite his lack of virginity. Or maybe, because of those very things. Because they had shaped him into who he was now.
shouldn’t hurt the baby. It's heated by magic, kept at a nice 65 degrees year-round. Cool, but comfortable.” Draco said lightly. “There are bathing suits in those rooms,” He pointed to rooms marked boys and girls, “But we will buy you some new ones. The suits already here are sanitized every time they get used, but I have my own, and so should you.” He said firmly.
Harry ran the sponge slowly over Draco’s body, listening to him count the places they could defile before they even reached the dungeons, and the dungeons were also full of their own hiding places; behind tapestries, invisible spaces in the walls, and all the hidden doors you could ever need. Harry was a bit shocked at Draco’s plan. “Draco, do you really think we can hit
Draco sighed and continued washing Harry, pointedly ignoring the occasional chuckle from the dark-haired teen.
Draco's fingers traced idle circles over the roundness, lulling Harry into a doze. “Are you still awake?” He asked a bit later.
“Ready? I had one of the elves here take all your creature books to the library, we’ll read there. We can be as loud as we want, since Pince isn’t here this month.” He said, grinning.
Harry sighed, giving in and thrusting harder and faster, grabbing Draco’s cock and stroking it. He growled as Draco finally came, and Harry cried out as he followed, feeling the energy they had expended being drawn into his body, making him feel more alive than he had felt in some time. He pulled out of Draco carefully, then slid down the teen’s body to take his cock into his mouth, slowly cleaning off the fluid that was spread on it and around it.
“Ow.” Draco whined, getting up and helping Harry up as well. “Okay, now that I know what to do, I think I can— ” He suddenly stopped, swaying on his feet as a wave of dizziness overcame him. “Or maybe not. I think I’m done for tonight.”
"One would never be enough." Draco agreed breezily. "But we have eternity ahead of us. I'm sure if you start
“No, you’re not. I’m packing books and heavy things. You can help with all your make-up and hair care and clothes in a bit. For now, relax and I’ll get the heavy stuff taken care of.” Draco said firmly.
Harry summoned the lube as well, then coated the dildo with it. After the tongue-fucking he had just given Draco, he felt his husband was prepared enough to take the dildo. After all, Draco enjoyed it rough sometimes, and for all his complaining, Harry could feel the anticipation building through the bond.
. It’s your right as the Lady of the Manor to meet the house-elves, begin ordering them about, and inspect your new home. We'll both be going, and it will be just us two.” Draco promised.
as much as he is Harry. I’m unmated, and ripe for the plucking. That’s why I’m here, instead of home with my mother.”
Harry picked up on his somber mood and stood. “So, are those wings functional, as well as looking absolutely wicked?!” He asked excitedly.
Draco sneered at the innuendo, smiling as the ice finally became razor sharp and hard as diamonds. “Ha!” He declared, picking up the sword and brandishing it triumphantly. “Did it!” He crowed.
Severus came into Poppy's office and sat in the chair she had for patients needing a consult and students that were apprenticing under her. She frowned.
Fred frowned, but then smiled and nodded. “And he knew that, aside from being a trustworthy guy, you’d also jump at the chance to curse him with impunity.” He said, chuckling.
Harry sighed. “Yeah, I know. Are you scared that something will go wrong?” He asked, as they entered the common room and headed into Harry’s room.
library than Malfoy Manor boasted. “This is a lighter collection than the Manor has, but it should suit anything
Draco groaned in defeat as Harry's come filled him, and all his cock could do was pulse in need, constricted as it was. "I hate you." He said in a sullen tone as Harry removed the cock ring.
. I mean, after I have our daughter, there's really no reason for me to continue changing, is there?" He asked. "I can tell everyone that matters who I am, and just let the media think I'm still dead. And I'd have my male body back permanently." He added.
Draco smiled. “Well, you deserve it.” He got on the bed and spooned up behind Harry, resting both hands on his distended belly. He felt something, and his eyes widened. “Was that a kick?” He asked excitedly.
nocturnal activities, and that habit of forgetting does not bode well for the future.” He explained.
Finally, after what seemed an eternity of pain and degradation, Nott grunted several times and released the spell, then lay down next to Draco, murmuring, “You’ll thank me someday, Draco. Gods, that was good.” As he drifted off.
Severus nodded thoughtfully. "A wise move, Mr. Malfoy. I am surprised I never thought of it myself."
Jeremy turned a bright smile on Celeste and took her hand, kissing the back and bowing. “Pleasure to meet you. You're a lucky man, Draco.” He said.
"Twenty points to Slytherin. You and your wife may leave early to rest for a bit." Severus said, approvingly.
Harry pouted. “Oh, you’re no fun.” He grabbed his clothes, then looked up at Draco. “Where did my boxers go?”
the inkwell, though, there are certain times when writing in blood is required by some of our business contacts. The inkwell fills itself with the blood of anyone who touches it.” He explained.
This chapter is also for Mistress of Spellcraft, who, once again, kicked my butt into gear. I am so sorry it has been so long!
And that's where we're at. So any suggestions, requests, other help or general encouragement would be greatly appreciated. PLEASE help me finish this thing!
.” Draco snapped, shifting his fingertips a bit, digging them into the soil, trying to find out exactly what he was feeling. “Well, damn and blast. This isn’t working. There’s something… A bit of a buzzing feeling, but it’s not strong enough.”
Harry choked on his toast as he stared at his own face in the daily prophet again, except this time, he had make-up on and his name was listed as Celeste Malfoy, formerly Scarletti.
Harry chuckled. “Potters tend to have that effect on Snapes.” He said, turning to leave the library. “I’ll be back at eleven, really. But first, I have a fight with Remus and Fred. George is still out cold from that stunner I caught him with yesterday.” Harry snickered, leaving two shocked Slytherins behind.
She promised to come right through and Draco rushed back into the room. “Are you alright? Do you need anything?” He asked.
Draco smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. "Yeah, sure." He was going to miss Harry's female body, but then again, this was what Harry wanted. "I'm happy for you." He said.
“Oh?” Harry pressed his chest against the blonde’s. “I think you’re lying.” He felt a surge of smugness and desire run through him as Draco’s face heated. “Looks like I’m right. Do you really think I can’t see your reaction to my thoughts? You tried to become you in my fantasy. You
“I’ll be coming by tomorrow to do a well-baby check and make sure everything is going well. It’s currently 3 AM Friday morning, I will see you around noon on Saturday, that gives you more than 24 hours to settle in.” She said.
As soon as she was out the door, Harry turned to Draco, wrapping his arms around the blonde’s waist, and claiming Draco’s mouth hungrily.
“What is the difference, if there is any, and which way is better?” Draco asked interestedly. “Just in the name of knowledge, of course.”
