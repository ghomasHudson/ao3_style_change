"Did you have a one-night stand with a mauling bear?" Pansy asked with a laugh, "She really did a number on you man" If looks - really it was a glare - could kill, Pansy would be six feet under.
"Okay, thanks. Err...What time is it?"
"...Just a...rumor?" She said it as a statement but the last word left something to be desired. A question.
"Just woke up there"
"Look at me," Harry said when Draco's eyes flickered away. "Look at me" Draco met his eyes and Harry smiled warmly, "I want you every second of every day for the rest of my goddamn life and I'll be damned if I ever let you go. I love you"
"Errr...." He looked off to the left and then back towards the green eyes that were intently staring at him, "...I really don't want to lie"
"Sod off"
"I love you too" Draco replied and then he was kissing Harry and Harry was falling back on the bed while Draco ravished his mouth.
"...Okay?" Harry looked around, "Can I leave?"
"Yes, Harry?"
"Yes" Draco mumbled, "Those are a promise ring and a-"
"So now you want to like...snog him?"
"So do you," Draco pointed out.
"Hospital Wing" Harry replied while pulling out his books. Snape's eyes squinted and Harry cocked his head.
"If you don't get in here I will personally come out there, and drag you in myself" Pansy replied.
"As he should" Pansy pipes up.
"You alright there?" Draco asked with a low laugh.
"Oh good, you're awake, dear" Harry turned to see Madam Pomfrey rushing over to his side.
"Yeah," Draco said in a small voice.
"Beautiful"
"You-" Sirius began to rant but was interrupted by a squeal.
"Thanks for the offer, but I'd rather not"
"For what to slip?"
Harry was just enjoying his eggs when finally some fifth-year apparently couldn't hold their tongue any longer and burst out, "Are you dating Malfoy?" The table fell silent and turned to Harry whose face was now red with the embarrassment of so many eyes on him.
To be sure that Draco understood, Harry would tell him, "I love you," between every breath he took. In between every kiss. Over every new sliver of skin he could find. And they couldn't have been happier to fall asleep in each other's arms and wake up enveloped in the warmth of their lover.
"Harry!" Ron snapped from behind him.
"Hold on" Harry stood up and gracefully made his way to Sirius who was standing with his hands on his hips. "Yes, Sirius?"
"And why is that?"
"I know" Harry mumbled and because they were both desperate and far too needy to even take the time to get undressed, they settled for rutting against each other. Draco's head fell into Harry's neck as he breathed heavily, and Harry took the opportunity to kiss the side of Draco's neck and create another mark. One he wouldn't have to hide anymore.
"Yes." Draco looked over at her, "He is so important to me, Pansy. He's my family"
"If you boys are done, you may leave. Just because I'm not a complete bat anymore doesn't mean I want to hear your mindless chatter"
"Holy shit" Pansy dropped her hands and looked down. "Holy shit" She chanted again.
"Fuck off the both of you!" He snapped, and then without thinning, released the rings to angrily run his hands through his messed up and sopping wet hair.
"Draco, you're angry you had to find out about your mother that way, but it's for the best. You needed to see it. And you need to trust that Harry didn't show you to gain the upper hand. He hasn't mentioned it to anyone but me, and I doubt Narcissa has either. She's already canceled the life debt," Neville continued, allowing himself a satisfied smile when Draco stiffened. Just as he'd thought – the bloody wanker was worried Harry had gone through with the courtship to satisfy the life debt. "She did it before he testified even, so forget that too."
He swallowed, his hand trembling as he ripped away the simple brown paper. It couldn't be, could it? He had been certain the Ministry destroyed it years ago. It hadn't been listed among his other possessions when he'd been released from his brief stay in Azkaban nearly ten years ago. Of course, it hadn't
"Been waylaid by Theo, have you?" she asked with a grin. She was absolutely glowing. "I can't get him to come away from the nursery. I'm surprised the mediwitches haven't kicked him out!"
Draco shook his head, resolving to leave as soon as he found the newlyweds and said goodbye. It was ridiculous to pine over Potter – there was no way anything could possibly happen between the two of them. He felt a momentary pang at the thought of losing his easy conversations with Gryffin, but he was a realist. Harry Potter would not date Draco Malfoy, and even if he would, Draco Malfoy had too many responsibilities to even consider it. He'd known Gryffin had some degree of fame, and he'd figured they'd be able to deal with it. But Harry Potter? He would have no chance in hell of keeping their relationship out of the papers, and there was no way he'd put Cal in jeopardy like that. The press would have a field day investigating his every move if he and Potter were together, and that would eventually lead them to his son.
Ron looked up at Draco's use of his given name, the first time he could ever remember the blond using it.
He heard Draco laugh behind him, leaning back into his husband's warmth. He angled his head back, kissing Draco on the mouth. Cal protested, earning himself a loud, smacking kiss on each cheek from his fathers.
Blaise thought about the last few men who Draco had taken into his bed, which was how he always thought of it. They certainly weren't part of Draco's
"At first glance, I thought it was horrible," Neville continued, laughing softly when Pansy nodded emphatically. "But then I really considered it, and it makes sense. They're perfect for each other."
"You know I hate it when you call me that. And sit up, or you'll ruin your suit," Draco drawled. "I finished the negotiations on the Traylor land deal; the contract should already be on your desk for your review. We also closed on that empty warehouse near Diagon Alley, the one Theo wants to turn in to a club. I'll need you to run through the legalities of that so we have all of our bases covered before we go before the Diagon Alley Chamber of Commerce."
"Did you catch any of that Magpies game?" he asked Theo, falling into an easy conversation about Quidditch.
," she said, nodding her head politely toward Harry and Draco. "Our readers would like to know what you've been doing since the war, Harry. Have you simply been living off Mr. Malfoy's – er, Mr. Potter-Black's – money?"
She was Bill and Fleur's oldest, just a year younger than Teddy – and apparently very magically talented. She and Teddy were the only ones who had wands. He was a second year, and she a first. They were staying at Grimmauld Place – where Harry, Draco, and Cal stayed when they were in London – for a few days over Yule break.

"Your compassion astounds me," the blond drawled. He was surprisingly steady after the four tumblers of whisky he'd already consumed.
"It was probably nothing. Scratch that, I
Draco took another sip of wine, savoring the way it rolled over his tongue as he swallowed. His laptop was open in front of him, waiting for him to log in to the Magical Dating Online site. He glanced at his watch – a few minutes after 9 p.m., which would be a few minutes after 8 p.m. in London. His balls tingled as he envisioned Gryffin waiting, trussed up in a similar cock ring to the one he was currently wearing, worrying if he would show up.
"Why are you out of bed?" He bellowed, forcing his tired body up off the bed and wrenching the bedroom door open.
Harry laughed, not bothering to turn around. "You got it," he yelled back, the bell jingling as he pushed the door open and stepped out into the street.
Draco paused, unsure of what to say. He and Harry still had three days left of their courtship before the formal marriage contract could be made, which meant three more days of no contact. They'd agreed to see less of each other for the next few days, since it was getting harder and harder to restrain themselves.
"I love Blaise Zabini."
"How's Daph?" Draco asked, trailing his fingers absently through the grape leaves.
Part of him was soaring at the knowledge that Harry was in love with him. He wanted nothing more than to throw caution to the wind and go after him. The other, more rational, part held Draco back. There was no hope of it withstanding today's 24-7 news cycle and the constant barrage of press. No one had invoked
Blaise nodded, schooling his features into an appropriately awed expression. He actually had no idea who James Evans was; he assumed he must be an author of some sort, obviously one Draco was fond of.
He gave her a winning smile, handing over a bag full of Galleons and grabbing the box from the counter. She was still staring at him, but he was too happy to care. He'd spent days agonizing over the perfect present, and he was so relieved to have hit upon something he was proud to give Harry.
Draco blinked, surprised by the abrupt change of subject. Although knowing Harry as he did, he supposed he shouldn't be

Harry smirked. George's latest improvement on the charmed cock rings allowed for whole-body sensations. It would give him the ability to put his hands all over Draco without physically touching the other wizard. George had branched out to testing a stronger

Harry moaned, his hands scrambling for purchase against Draco's shoulders, his thighs burning with the effort of his enthusiastic thrusts. He knew he was close, and he told Draco so, nearly unintelligible words whispered against swollen lips and swallowed almost as quickly as they had been uttered.
"Thanks, Nev," Draco said, momentarily shaken by the level of devotion and loyalty that fairly emanated from the Gryffindor. The man's calming presence was exactly what he needed when he was feeling like this. Draco wondered if that was why he'd come here, unconsciously seeking Neville's company.
Draco didn't notice, focused on the glass of Firewhisky he held cradled in his hands. He shrugged, blowing out a breath in frustration.
"Oh, sod off," he said fondly. "This is a good idea. Besides, you know how much I hate sandy feet."
Draco smoothed the duvet over his sleeping son, feathering kisses across his cheeks and forehead before spelling the lights off and creeping toward the door. C.C. was snoring softly in a small pile of blankets on the floor, though Draco predicted the fur ball would likely finish the night in bed with Cal. He'd never been allowed to have Argie on his own bed, but he didn't have the heart to place a similar restriction on Cal.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They aren't mine.
"Fine. Read it. But then you owe me three chapters, Harry Potter. You won't leave this house until I have them."
Draco sat back, shivering slightly as the cool night air flowed over his naked skin. He grabbed his trousers off the desk, standing to step into them. He started to leave the room, hesitating guiltily as he looked at the computer again.
"No, he knows the truth about me."
to worry.
"How's Ginny?" Draco asked, pressing a button on his desk to summon Madge. He had a pile of signed paperwork to be Owled.

"Ah," Harry said, his tone faintly disapproving. "I'm familiar with it, yes. Not a member, unfortunately, but I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself, Mr. Wedgewick."
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Lavender cried when Draco approached, clearly tired of trying to coax the boys off the table.
Harry looked puzzled, especially when Ginny's eyes widened at something she saw in her brother's face.
"Even though," Draco answered dryly, scribbling a note to Madge on the outside of the new folder and sending it off with a waiting owl.
? Or any of the papers? It's an outdated law that most of them probably haven't even heard of."
He was intrigued. This man was nothing like the Potter he knew from school. He was calm and direct, easily presenting information and answering questions efficiently and confidently. He seemed to be knowledgeable about the laws and his defense of the signage, which the board sought an injunction against, was intelligent.
that, Harry. With you, it's
"I know," Harry whispered, his shoulders slumping.
Harry's face lit up in a big smile. He loved his friends, especially when they looked out for him like this.
He looked at Draco appraisingly, resting his hip against the bed as he tipped a potion against his closed lips. Draco tightened them, unwilling to take anything until he knew exactly what was going on.
Harry made a sound of protest, breaking away from a particularly bruising kiss.
Draco decanted the wine, letting it breathe awhile as he settled into a comfortable chair by the fire to read Gryffin's note. He'd just tucked Cal into bed, and he still had an hour before Gryffin would be logged in to the dating site. He was glad of the time difference – it gave Cal time to settle in, ensuring their chat wouldn't be interrupted.
He watched in horror as the blond git moved through the crowd –how was it possible to look graceful whilst dodging drunken dancers? – and approached the trio near the bar, nearly groaning when Ron slapped him on the back, leaning in to talk with him over the loud music.
"But – you're cooking," he said, aware his voice had taken on a whiny quality.
He groaned as thoughts of Severus led to thoughts of Gryffin's confession. He was fairly sure the professor who had so affected Gryffin was none other than Severus Snape, Potions Master extraordinaire. His erection surged with renewed interest at the thought of a younger Gryffin furiously wanking in some deserted alcove. Draco had never had any fantasies about the man, but he did concede that Sev's voice had definitely been wank-worthy.
He bit his lip hard enough to draw blood, trying to resist the compulsion to continue.
that? What was he thinking?"
"He's fine, and he'd be furious if you broke the courtship rules and went in there right now," Blaise countered, shoving Harry roughly into a chair in the corridor. He sank into a crouch, his hands curled around Harry's knees, restraining him. "If you do that, you won't be able to continue to use
They were on mostly friendly terms, sure, but she'd not planned to invite either man. But they were both good friends with Theo and Ginny, and Daph and Neville as well. And she knew Theo was working with them to develop his new club, and it seemed like too simple a request to deny. At least, it had until this moment, when she was forced to figure out where to seat them.
Sensing Harry's imminent release, Draco pulled back. He claimed Harry's mouth in another brutal kiss, both of them desperate to meld into one being made up of two minds, two bodies and one heart. Harry didn't notice when Draco's arm dropped to the floor in search of his discarded wand, which made the tingle of the nonverbal Lubrication and Stretching Spells much more surprising – and arousing.
"Draco Abraxas Malfoy, Head of the House of Malfoy and Heir to the House of Black, your magic has accepted that of your chosen partner. Do you accept the awesome burden of your newly forged bond?"
Harry grimaced, hearing the underlying stress and exhaustion in her voice. She'd been so busy, between wedding preparations and work, and Ron had hardly been any help at all. Not that she would have let the man do much, but the fact that he hadn't made an effort to even try annoyed her even more.
"No, Cal, you have to listen to your daddy. It's past time for little wizards to be in bed," he said, shaking his head grimly.
Harry laughed, a fond grin spreading across his face. With everything they'd shared over the last month and a half, he felt like he knew Sly very well. He didn't think either of them would be satisfied by a quick coffee.
Blaise sighed, appealing to Merlin for strength. It was a wonder Potter was still trying to contact Draco after the roadblocks Draco had thrown up. He was Draco's best friend and even
Kingsley cleared his throat, tapping the contract once again. It rolled up into a tight scroll and flew into his hand, which had been outstretched for it. He took one look at the two men in front of him before quickly stepping away, heading toward the Floo.
he needed to explain.
"This," she whispered, thrusting the newspaper at him.
he wondered, blinking in surprise when the clock showed it was already after 1 p.m.
"I can tell you know that permission will not be given to photograph or speak with Caleum, and the same will go for Carina when she reaches Hogwarts."
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Sadly, they aren't mine.
The dreams had been increasing in frequency for weeks now, but the intensity hadn't started kicking up this high until last week, when Draco agreed to accept Harry's courtship. He grabbed his wand, but hesitated before he could cast the spells he'd come to rely on almost nightly. Really, wet dreams at his age? It was mortifying.
"I can't find my wand!" Draco snapped, crossing the room again in a panic.
"Draco?" Harry looked absolutely ragged, his normally tanned skin chalky. "Draco, I'm so sorry. God, I'm sorry! I didn't realize it would be that hard – I didn't think – I shouldn't have –"
Draco didn't even pause to think before enveloping the larger man in a tight hug, squeezing him hard.
"Speaking of another dirty Slytherin bastard," Ron began, stopping immediately when he noticed his sister's narrowed eyes.
Harry, he thought, swallowing convulsively to bite back his terror. Harry knew about Cal, and knew that Blaise and Neville had gotten him to safety. The Healer cast a few diagnostic spells over him while he watched the tall, sandy-haired man observe silently, his arms crossed as though waiting for Draco to act out again.
He'd been too caught up in scanning the paper's French equivalent,
"We couldn't pass up the chance for a true eternity soul bond," Harry added, feeling a pulse of affection come through the new bond.
"It's not even to be released until August, and Gryffin manages to get me a copy!"
Draco studied him carefully, his heart slamming against his ribs. If Harry came through the Floo looking for sex, he didn't think he'd be able to stop himself. He almost screamed in frustration – Neville and Daphne were enjoying a rare night out in Paris, and Blaise was staying late at the office. He supposed he could grab his mother to chaperone, but –
His eyes widened in surprise when a nondescript cock ring fell out of the folded parchment, landing on his thigh. He reached for it, stroking the small leather band with his fingers while his eyes scanned Gryffin's now-familiar handwriting.
"He won't listen to reason, Harry," Pansy said, frowning. "I'm sorry."
He glanced over at Cal, running his fingers through the dark hair that spilled over the pillow. He'd be six next month. Draco's smile faded as his thoughts turned toward telling Harry about Cal. He'd spent countless hours over the last week thinking about it, and he still didn't know how to proceed.
There is a sequel to this fic called Summer Session.
Draco's eyes rolled back at the sensation of Harry sinking onto his cock, a guttural moan drawn from deep within him as he watched the man he loved ride him with abandon. Harry thrust up and down in his lap, knees resting on the cushions for leverage, and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist, drawing him closer so they could resume their earlier attempt at a kiss.
"I'm going to go email him, apologize," Draco said, smiling slightly for the first time since they'd come inside. He grinned as he left the room, laughing at his own joke. "Harry Potter.
Draco's hands fisted at his sides as he paced in front of the Floo, waiting for Pansy and Oliver to come through. He'd been seething since yesterday, when he saw what the interview that idiot Smith had given to the papers.
"I found out about it when the Ataliers came to me about discrepancies in their accounts," Draco answered through gritted teeth. "I put a watch on their Gringotts account and found out that way. I informed Madam and Monsieur Atalier of Cato's embezzlement as soon as I had confirmed it."
Neville didn't say a word, watching emotions flit through Draco's normally shuttered eyes. If the Slytherin had any idea what he was saying – or that Neville could see the truth behind his words in his troubled grey eyes – he'd be mortified. Neville was one of the few who knew how distraught Draco had been when news of Harry's last accident as an Auror had surfaced. At the time, he hadn't understood why Draco cared, but it was obvious in hindsight. Though he doubted Draco even realized it himself, then or now.
"Was it really necessary to tease my future husband that way?" Draco asked the portrait after the door had closed. He felt a little guilty that he hadn't thought to ward the portrait, the only magical one in the chateau, though his remorse vanished when he felt a hand cup his arse.
he thought dismissively, squinting at his reflection. He hated wearing contacts.
He took the proffered paper, groaning in resignation as he saw the top story.
"These H-Horcruxes," Draco stammered, his eyes still locked on the rock where memory Ron had destroyed the locket only moments before, "That's – why – how –"
"Of course, of course," Wedgewick muttered, slapping both of them heartily on the back. "I'd forgotten the board of governors started letting half-bloods in a few years back. Still a good place, though, but not what it used to be. I understand completely."
This gushing, ebullient side to Draco wasn't one Blaise had ever seen before, but his amusement was tempered with caution. He could tell Draco was getting emotionally invested in this Gryffin – something he almost never did.
Draco stilled his hips, his eyes trained on Harry as he tried to gauge the other man's response. It was true that they'd never once talked of who would top or bottom, but this had felt natural and right. Draco didn't mind bottoming, and quite enjoyed it on occasion. Still, he always felt most in control when he was on top, when he could control the depth and pace of the strokes, when he was the partner responsible for bringing them both to the height of pleasure.
Harry blushed slightly. He had no idea how old Sly was; he certainly hoped he was around his own age, but he tried not to think about it overmuch.
Harry thought, his balls tightening uncomfortably as his body strained toward release it couldn't reach because of the restrictive cock ring. He couldn't take it anymore. He sat back heavily, his sweaty bare back sticking to the leather sofa. He loosened his grip on his cock, running his other and down to his balls, fondling them gently before squeezing lightly in concession.

," he said, laying the tip of his wand against Draco's forehead. "
"He's … different," Ron said, surprising both Harry and Hermione by coming to Draco's defense. "They're all different now. Everyone has grown up."
. No one but Draco's closest friends even knew Caleum existed.

"Bloody hell!" he yelped, instantly drawing his wand in defense. A whiff of a familiar floral perfume had him sheepishly returning the wand to his wrist holster.
"What Neville's not telling you, possibly because he doesn't know, is that it is illegal to interfere in any way with a courtship that has been formed under
"No? This one, then. He wants someone who will 'allow me to dominate you in every sense of the word'," Blaise said, looking at Draco with a grin.
"Harry loves you."
look sexier.
Neville took the chair opposite Harry, indulging in a swig of his drink before shooting questions at Harry rapid-fire. How had he come to have Draco's wand? Why hadn't he turned it over to the Ministry after the war ended? Why had he kept it all this time? Why hadn't he returned it after Draco was pardoned? Why give it to Draco now?
wanted to keep Cal close, too. But they couldn't keep hiding him away, especially when Cal wanted the world to know who he was and who his fathers were. Keeping him back a year from Hogwarts on a technicality would have done more damage than good; Cal was much too smart to wait another year to start his formal education, and it was past time he had friends his own age. He had Teddy and Victoire, who were older, and scads of younger cousins, but no one who was close to his age.
. That he had confessed things about himself he'd never told anyone to
, Blaise thought, his throat tightening at the idea of his sweet little Godson worrying about nonsense like that.
"Oh, but it is," Ron smirked, nodding to the waiter to signal for their bill. He needed to get Harry out of the restaurant before the man blew. He knew Harry would be upset about an outburst later – this
The old Auror shook his head in disgust, slamming his fist down on the table. A younger man next to him examined the bottle of Veritaserum, as though expecting to find something wrong with it.
“She took my robes,” Hermione said with a frown. How was she going to get back to Gryffindor Tower without her robes?
Harry stroke himself and feeling the sensations himself, it was all too much.
Draco took advantage of the opportunity to look around Potter's study, smiling when he saw the laptop open on the desk. He figured most witches and wizards their age had a computer these days, even though it was a pain to ward them from the ambient magic in most wizarding households. He was anxious to get home to check his own, hopeful that Gryffin might have changed his mind about going out and emailed him after all.
Draco's eyes glazed over as he noticed the front of Harry's apron was tented as well, swallowing hard at the sexy sight in front of him. He assumed they'd be living at the chateau after they were married, but Draco vowed to find a way to make Harry cook naked for him again. Maybe they could keep this house just for that purpose?
He grinned when Ginny laughed, nodding. She bit her lip, unsure of how much she should divulge to Draco. She didn't want him pining after Harry if her friend was unavailable, after all.
“Studies show you’re a manipulative bastard who will stop at nothing, even making up research, to get his way,” Theo said dryly, throwing his Transfiguration book into his bag. He’d been falling behind this week because he couldn’t master the latest spell, and he fully intended to cloister himself in the library until he had it down, even if it took all weekend.
love you. And you're not stupid. You're the smartest daddy there is."
Harry was covered in a sheen of sweat, his cock so hard he was nearly begging for release. He keened as he found just the right angle, bearing down on Draco as he fucked himself on the Slytherin's cock. He thought he was at the apex of pleasure when Draco's lips met his, and
A silvery shield burst forth from his wand, the mist forming a physical barrier in front of Harry. It wasn't a well-known spell. Harry had found it while researching his latest book, and he'd never actually cast it before. In theory, it should block just about anything, though no spell was known to repel the Killing Curse.
He was well prepared to present their case for the zoning change, which would allow the warehouse to become a club, and the alcohol permit, but he didn't want to engage in a debate with local homeowners who didn't want a bar near their homes.
"Mate?"
Blaise waited, knowing Draco would continue. It was an effort to keep from shouting at the blond, but he restrained himself.
"Cal," he said, earning Caleum's eternal gratitude for extending a hand for a manly shake instead of giving him a kiss as well. After all, he had his reputation to think of.
"I think it's time to go," Draco whispered to his friend, nodding toward Potter, who was now asleep with his head propped on the table, and Weasley, who was looking around with a huge smile on his completely plastered face.
Harry grinned at the boy, his heart melting even more when the boy offered him a tentative smile. He nodded once to Blaise, letting him know he'd understood his earlier words. Whatever it took, he would make sure Cal was safe from whatever was out there.
Harry laughed, grabbing his wand and casting a Warming Charm over their breakfast. It could wait, but Draco obviously couldn't.
"I am not cold-hearted, and I am very much capable of love."
, Draco thought dryly.

"What does it matter? We don't need romance," he all but growled, pushing against Harry until the other man lost his balance and sprawled across the sofa.
"No party," he said over his shoulder, his smile growing as her eyebrows shot up. "This is all for one person. One very special person."
She winked at Draco, raising an eyebrow at his silver tattoo.
“Your focus is off,” she said, letting her foot slide back to the floor. Theo whimpered at the loss, canting his hips forward in search of contact. “Again.”
can do," she said, rubbing her temples.
“I can’t believe she’s missing the party of the year to study,” Lavender muttered, pulling Ron toward the dungeons.
last night?
Harry nodded, unsure of how to answer. It wasn't hard to imagine Draco's reasons for keeping his son's existence a secret. It was amazing he'd managed it this long. Harry's resolve strengthened even more, his doubts about his relationship with Draco taking a backseat to his concern for the little boy.
“Oh, then it’s too bad she’s left,” Hannah said, turning her attention back to her own book. She read silently for a few minutes, paying Theo no mind. Hermione kept up her ministrations, sucking the head of Theo’s cock into her mouth. He gasped at the sensation, throwing himself back hard against the chair when she slid her mouth down, almost fully engulfing him in the wet heat.
He balanced the box against his hip, closing and warding the Floo behind him with his wand. He wouldn't put it past Charlie – egged on by George or Bill – to try something again. He glared at his sofa, as though the blow-up doll that had been perched on it this morning was still there. He'd Vanished it, of course, but the memory of the hot pink lipstick and voluminous breasts was still fresh.
"It's not really a present,
A slow smile spread across Hermione's face as understanding dawned. Ron, who had been looking away in his perusal of the restaurant patrons, turned back toward them, a huge grin on his face as well. All descendents of the Families were well-schooled in those archaic rules that applied only to them. No one had ever entered into a courtship as public as the one Harry and Malfoy were about to, though, so no one had used the old law in more than a century.

"I'm going with you," he said, nodding to one of the Aurors across the corridor to let him know everything was alright. "I've got permission to do whatever is necessary to find Cartwell, and I have a feeling he's going to be going after Malfoy's son."
"Pansy has nothing to do with it. She's hardly Potter's closet confidante."
"Why don't you go get us some coffee?" Harry asked, nodding toward the door. "I'll keep working."
Blaise grinned, feeling lighter than he had in weeks. If that was Draco's last objection, then things were about to get much better for the blond and everyone subjected to his moods.
Ginny
Draco growled, pushing past Theo. For obvious reasons, Caleum hadn't been able to visit him in the hospital, and Draco wanted to find him as soon as possible. Logically, he knew his son was fine, but some irrational part of him wouldn't believe it until he held him in his arms.
"Be that as is may, we are still honored to be here with them to watch as they reconfirm their love and commitment to each other," Kingsley continued. Draco noticed a sly smile on the older man's face, and his unease ratcheted up a notch. Something was definitely up.
, he thought, his internal struggle finished.
Harry stumbled through the Floo, almost losing his grip on the bulky box in his hands. George had provided them with numerous pranks and gags to help get them through tomorrow's stag party, and Harry had volunteered to take charge of them. He figured it gave him the chance to sort through the box and remove anything that would truly embarrass – or, knowing George, maim or injure – Ron. Charlie hadn't entirely been joking about Hermione's fear that the party would get out of hand.
“And how do you suggest I get there, since you were the one who saw fit to let Hannah Abbott walk off with my robes?”
Harry was instantly alert, his head pounding as he sat up quickly. He panicked when his wand wasn't under his pillow, where it usually rested while he slept, but a quick perusal of the room – and himself – reassured him that everything was fine. He'd just gone to sleep in his clothes, with his wand still in its wrist holster.
Harry chuckled, turning back to the pile of parchment in his hands. James Evans' latest book was almost ready to go to press, and he'd never been more satisfied with one of his manuscripts. The publisher had loved the change – from single Auror to family man – his main character had undergone this time, saying it would open up the appeal of the series to a new audience.
Harry belatedly realized Pansy was still in the doorway, and he gestured for her to come in as he began to explore the contents of the basket. The food had Warming and Preservation charms on it, which meant it would taste as fresh as it had been when Sly prepared it earlier that day. Harry smiled.
"You lived in there?" Draco asked, his voice incredulous. He wouldn't let a house-elf live in those conditions, let alone a little boy.
"It's ridiculous, because we were never close, and there's no way it would ever be anything more than physical attraction. I hadn't even talked to him in years. I mean, we've seen each other at parties and ceremonies, sure, but we never talked. But we shook hands last night, and I swear, there was this spark –"
"Tomorrow," he said, his voice sounding slightly strangled. "Tell them tomorrow."
Hermione didn't raise her head, but Harry jumped when the mild Stinging Hex hit him. So she was listening, then.
Finally feeling more like himself, Draco opened his eyes, gasping in shock when he realized Harry was hovering over him, his green eyes wide with worry and – shame? What did
"Is Harry Potter going to come live with us?" Cal asked suddenly, pulling Blaise out of his drowsing.
"Then you'll be the one to explain why I've missed my deadline when Abigail makes her angry Floo call," he said flatly.
"Some of that Ogden's?" Harry suggested, taking the seat furthest from the fire. He'd gotten a bit overheated on the walk back up to the house, especially with Caleum's warm weight cradled in his arms. Being alone with Draco for the first time in weeks wasn't helping, either.
His head snapped up when he heard the soft alert that signified a new email, sitting his glass aside and pulling his laptop over to him from its resting place on the sofa cushion. Harry's grin grew when he recognized the email address.
"I only have a few left," she said, and Harry wondered if he was imagining the apprehension in her eyes. "Friends, mostly. My family was easy, and Molly and Arthur already asked me to fill out their table with Kingsley and a few other Ministry employees."
They could hear him laughing as he disappeared. Ron waited until he heard Teddy's bedroom door shut before he whirled around, his brow furrowed as he spoke sharply to his wife.
, he thought, his eyes narrowing as he looked over at Draco, who was hidden from Snape's view by the back of the chair. Snape had just watched
Harry almost growled in frustration. Malfoy was leaving? Just like that? Harry almost stood to follow him – though for the life of him he couldn't figure out why Malfoy leaving was a
"All healed up, then?"
When he heard Hermione's hushed whisper that no one had thought to buy wedding rings for them, a laugh bubbling up in his chest. Harry smirked as well, and Draco knew he'd heard his friend's lament, too. What's more, he could
Harry felt Draco's fingers slide into him, unerringly drawn to the tight bundle of nerves that made him cry out and squirm. Their mouths were still joined, tongues battling for supremacy. Harry shamelessly ground against Draco's fingers, his total focus centered on that amazingly talented hand and Draco's firm and insistent lips.
It had been a constant battle to keep his thoughts away from Harry, but a necessary exercise. He'd never wanked this often in his life, not even after his emails and chats with Gryffin had taken a decidedly sexual turn.
Snape glared at Cal, rolling his eyes. "As I was saying, these
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Not mine. My most heartfelt thanks to Kamerreon for keeping me focused and on-track (as well as grammatically correct!).
"Unnecessary, but thank you," he said, unsure if the blush he could feel heating his cheeks showed through the glamour.
Harry looked up, surprised. Hermione shrugged, picking up a stack of plates and moving them to the sink.
Seamus fixed him with a hard stare, leaning over to grab the vials of potion again. "Why is Harry telling you you're amazing?"
"He may be a bit late, but yes. Freddie has an appointment with the Healer, and he wants to be there for it," Blaise said, smiling when Draco's head raised, his brow furrowed. "Just a routine check-up. Nothing to worry about."
He wondered if his friend had realized he was in love with Draco yet. Sure, Harry now knew Sly and Draco were the same person, but had he
He dutifully followed the instructions, turning to the second page. Maybe Harry had signed it? Draco's breath caught as he read the only printed words on the page. The dedication page.
Harry was exhausted. The kind of bone numbing tired he'd only experienced in his hunt for Horcruxes and after the final battle. His muscles ached, his head throbbed, – it even felt like his
just watched him beat off.
Harry knew it was a lost cause, but that didn't stop him from settling in for the night with his laptop, intent on tracking Draco down. His Owls to Malfoy Manor had been returned, unopened, as had the missives he'd sent directly to Malfoy Industries.
?" Harry couldn't believe it. Ron knew, and he hadn't hexed Malfoy into the next century?
thing, even though his mind seemed to disagree – before remembering he was in no state to stand just yet.
," he said, tapping his wand over Harry's heart before mirroring the gesture on himself. "
tradition," Draco whispered, the disdain clear in his muted voice. Harry opened his mouth to protest, the words dying on his lips when Draco bent and wrapped his lips around his cock.
Ron didn't turn, shielding his eyes with his hands to watch for the morning delivery owl. He felt Hermione wrap her arms around his bare waist, and he would have ducked to kiss her, but he saw a tiny dot on the horizon approaching.
Draco straightened Cal's collar, grateful that Harry hadn't insisted on Muggle formalwear for their wedding ceremony. His husband had displayed more spite – and potions skill – than he'd anticipated in extracting his revenge for last night. Harry had managed to get one of the house-elves to slip an Erigo Potion into his tea this morning, and he'd been battling a persistent erection ever since.
Harry lowered his wand, his heart still racing. Ron was curled up in the claw-footed bathtub, fully clothed, the picture of absolute misery. Harry wondered how Ron had ended up there, searching his memory for any clues from the night before.
Seamus waited until the Healer left, asking the silent Auror to wait outside while he did a physical examination. The Auror left reluctantly, obviously loath to let Draco out of his sight.
"He could make more of an effort too, you know," Ron said grumpily.
She grabbed Harry's hand, taking a closer look at the tattoo on his finger. "It's brilliant," she said, kissing Draco on the cheek when he joined them. "Congratulations."

: The little scene with Sev was for narcoleptic86, who asked to see Snape in MLQ. Hope you enjoyed it, sweetie! *grins*
She hesitated, lowering her wand and sheathing it in her wrist holster. Harry was right. She needed to calm down, and a walk down to get some coffee was the perfect opportunity.
Draco nodded, willing to agree to just about anything if it would get Severus out of the room.
"Don't be ridiculous," Smith drawled, and Harry had to bite back a snarl. He hated everything about the man – especially the fact that he'd lost his virginity to him. "You're the best man. You can't leave."
Ron blinked. “You’ve been asking an awful lot of hypotheticals recently, mate. Are you sure you’re all right?”
Ron turned towards them, his face lighting up as he reeled Harry in and pulled him into a bear hug, like everything was normal and Ron wasn’t drinking with the Slytherins.
“Yeah,” said Ron. “Near and far at the same time. Fuck, I’m drunk.”
“Of course we do!” keened Hermione. “Because that’s all I am! Potter and Weasley and an ugly jumper!”
“I know,” he said, and they didn’t.
“Don’t sweat it,” said Susan. “If you want me to leave, I get it. I mean, about bloody time.”
Harry sighed. “Look, maybe you should make sure you’re near another pair. You never know what she’s going to throw at you. If you’re concerned for your safety, don’t be a hero, tell your superior – “
Blaise beamed. “We’ll meet down here for pres at six and then I’ll take you over. I’ll run upstairs and get the others. Harry? Michael?”
“He’s been having sex with Potter,” said Blaise. “Don’t tell anyone. It’s a secret that only everybody in our bloody flat block knows.”
Luckily, he didn’t need to. Malfoy was in the kitchen.
When Harry opened the door to the knocking, he found it was not Hermione, or Dean or Seamus, or anyone explicable. It was Blaise Zabini, with a crate of champagne tucked under one arm. Dean and Seamus were hovering behind him, gripping each other’s shoulders in a way that was both adorable and disheartening.
The next morning, Harry sat up in bed suddenly with his brain aflame.
“Hush, child,” she said, holding up a hand. “I’m going to lay some wisdom on you now. The first is this – yes, you totally did fuck him around. And I understand that you’re going through a lot right now, and there’s lots of good, sympathetic reasons why you were saying and doing the things you did – but that doesn’t negate their effect on Dean. Him being the nearest queer person to you does not mean that you can use him to play gay chicken with yourself and see how far could push the envelope of heterosexual bromance without having to admit you weren’t straight, and your internalised homophobia does not actually justify the way you treated him when he came out. I get it, kind of. If he was openly bi and you were into him and you two were friends then maybe you’d end up crossing a line and you wouldn’t be able to take it back. That’s kind of it, right?”
Pansy left and returned startlingly quickly with a large tray covered in sixteen shot glasses, which was efficient if ambitious, each arranged in pairs. He studied them closely. The trick to beating alcohol was to get into its mind. Maybe. It was possible he’d had too much to drink at pres.
“So are you, Hermione. And you’ve got the rest of your life to figure out all of them. You don’t want to change the word? Don’t. You do not have to be good, Hermione. You’ve done enough.”
It was getting dark, but the warming charms were keeping them all toasty. She leant back into Anthony’s hands and saw Theo doing the same, settling against the opposite shoulder.
“We’re in the same block,” said Dean. “We need to have block parties, like, every night. We have to know the guest list.”
“Since third year, right?” said Greg brightly.
Malfoy jumped a little, and then reached up to rub his temples. “Potter. It is arse o clock in the morning, and you’re shouting nonsense at me. What apology? For copping off with a bloke? Sod off forever.”
“Because I’ve changed and grown, and I really wouldn’t say any of the stuff I said about Granger back in the day now.  On the other hand, if someone walked up to me now and said “It’s the life of everyone in this room or Harry Potter,” I’d Kevadra you myself.”
“It’s
“Well, thank god for that,” said Susan. Her voice was flat and narrow. “Thank god the great Blaise Zabini is deigning to fancy me.”
“Oh.” Parvati was regaining her colour. “You remember that the guy thing is all you, right? I told you about – “
“That won’t happen,” said Harry. “Look, Seamus was a cock just then. But it’s kind of easy to hate Blaise. If you tell him, he’ll have to re-examine his views, won’t he? He’s your best friend. He’ll realise you’ve been mates for eight years without you ever trying to touch his cock, and he’ll get the fuck over himself.”
Eventually he pulled himself up, because crying in the hallway of a flat that wasn’t even his was all kinds of pathetic, and made his way upstairs. He found an assortment of his friends in the kitchen, all still drinking. Make-up mussed and shirtsleeves rolled up, a stain on Dean’s shirt, a lovebite on Morag’s neck. The carnage of a night out.
Blaise’s laugh was roaring. “Oh, Harry. His parents have always known he was gay. They caught him sucking me off the summer before sixth year.”
“So where’s my apology?” he began.
“Did you get that from…?” Dean trailed off, looking uncomfortable and fascinated, and Morag laughed.
She’d taken her new satchel, one she hadn’t Extended yet, and even with it stretched to capacity she was still balancing five thick tomes under her chin. Still, she’d made it back to her dorm intact, and as she struggled with her key card she gave thanks that she was on the ground floor, even though last night she’d seriously considered writing a letter of complaint. Someone had been blasting music above her and, even worse, it had sounded like
“Yeah! I could be full out going down on an orange in the kitchen – “ They both burst into giggles, and Harry caught Dean before he slipped.
“But you did say no,” said Parvati. “And he made you feel like shit for it.”
“Anthony Goldstein?” said Pansy. “You jammy bitch. He was at the same schul as me. Honestly, the summer he filled out I nearly went into palpitations.”
“Right,” said Ron. “Hullo, Malfoy. So were you, uh, being bisexual in here?”
He smiled indulgently. “Perhaps a little. That’s all right. I find it charming.”
Snape had cared because of his mother, and Sirius had cared because of his father, and Dumbledore had cared because Harry was a weapon. Maybe only Remus had cared for Harry himself, and in the end it didn’t matter because they were all dead, dead, dead.
“Oh look,” said Harry desperately, “there’s Hermione.”
“And I’m not, am I?”
“I’m nervous,” he said, running his thumb over Draco’s hole. Draco was laid out on the bed before him, hips pushed up with a pillow. Harry had opened him up with his fingers – he wasn’t quite ready to use his tongue yet, no matter how good it felt when Draco did it to him – and he thought he’d done a pretty good job if the way Draco swore in triplicate was any indication.
“I think Potter’s done,” said Pansy.
Why was Draco always making him feel confusing things? And why was it always when he was in the queue for the loo? You shouldn’t have big emotional realisations when you needed a piss. Or to throw up. A man could only deal with so many things at once.
Except there had been a million moments that Parvati could have made a move if she wanted to. She hadn’t. Because Hermione had strange teeth and an odd face and didn’t know how to talk to people. Because she debated too fiercely when they spoke about books. Because she was short and dumpy and she’d never been pretty for twenty-four consecutive hours.
of it all,” Hermione was saying, hands waving above her. Theo and Athony were braiding flowers into her hair as the sun went down. “The, uh, the – Anthony?”
“What’s Morris dancing, then?” said Pansy loudly.
me, the way I’m planning to ignore you. The way I was planning to ignore you last night, until you came up to me and decided to remind me that I was a shit-for-brains Slytherin who didn’t deserve a thing in this world. You
“I am?”
“I don’t know,” said Harry. “Doesn’t feel like that much time has passed to me. But also – “
“Maybe,” said Harry, and pushed all thoughts of Malfoy from his mind.
"Figured it out,” muttered Draco. “Sure. I’m going to hold your hand now. Try not to have feelings about it.”
“Eh,” said Malfoy, shrugging. “It turned out to be my father, in the end. So pretty much the same thing.”
The bartender looked despairingly at the pile. “Let’s just say it is and call it a day.”
“Harry, I’m so sorry.”
“No,” he said, sounding a little desperate. “But I can’t tell you the reason why, and I’m trying really hard not to lie to you in this conversation, so
Harry poked Ron in the ribs, which earned him an elbow, and the two of them tussled a bit until an elderly man at the table next to him cleared his throat and gave them a pointed glare.
“When you just suspected, when it was this unspoken thing between you, it was safe. When he came out, suddenly you were worried he might try and openly acknowledge what was going on with you. And let’s not forget that once he was out, he might have the audacity to go and actually shag men rather than engaging in some Victorian love-that-dare-not-speak-it’s-name roleplay with you. And the fact that I can tell that your actions were motivated by self-preservation rather than disgust is, quite frankly, the only reason I am still prepared to talk to you, because I’ve been in a similar place. But Finnegan, love, listen to me very carefully. Your motivations do not matter. You hurt him as much as if you’d been a straight guy who did this because you were a little bit icked out by gay people. You hurt him more.”
“Get out before I hex you,” muttered Malfoy. Harry grinned and got out of the room, before he did any of the very odd things he wanted to do, like brush Malfoy’s hair back from his forehead, or kiss him again.
“Well, mine was fun,” she said. “God, you bloody English. Always in your feelings.”
“No,” said Harry. Draco didn’t really count – it definitely wasn’t a romance if someone couldn’t call you by your first name when you were shagging. And he should probably take a leaf from Hermione’s book and try sleeping with someone else. Expanding horizons and all that. Maybe even someone he didn’t practically live with. It wasn’t as if Draco would mind – they’d been very clear on where they stood.
“Aubrey can be a boys name too!”
“Ugh, fine.” Pansy gave a theatrical groan. “Ok, Potter, Ron says that if I don’t apologise to you I’ll feel bad on my deathbed or something so here we go – I’m terribly sorry about that whole giving you to the dark lord business. And Granger – “ her voice softened. “I really am sorry about everything I said to you. I was a little bitch, and a bigot to boot, and I was trying to tear you down to build myself up. I’m sorry.”
“Wait for Hermione? I think she’s just finishing up,” said Draco, and fled before latch onto him.
“Morag’s a lesbian, Scottish and can hold her liquor, leaving her immune to my charm on all fronts.”
“Sure,” said Harry. “But, like, if it does, I’m in number ten.”
Even from people who didn’t believe in blood purity, who just thought that the thing to overcome was a Muggle childhood. But a lot of it was –
said a sing-song voice in his head. It sounded like Pansy. He should have demanded to be placed in Hufflepuff. They didn’t have these kind of problems. “It’s fine, honestly.”
Harry felt a bit like laughing, and a bit like crying. It was too soon. He hadn’t seen Malfoy for a year, and it was still too fucking soon. He’d known, intellectually, that they’d run into each other. But he’d manged to repress it, assume that they’d probably just see each other on opposite sides of the hallway. He was not meant to be here, in Harry’s flat. Not here, when Harry was happy and Malfoy was so clearly miserable. He had done the war, he had done death, which meant that he was very much done with Draco Malfoy. If he had the
“Are you all right? You’re not going to – “
“You were talking about Seamus,” said Harry, and Dean let out the first real sob, curling into himself more.
“Leave her, Hannah,” said Susan. “Hermione, the regulations are vaguely worded to protect men like him. You wouldn’t get it. If you’d been in my position, you’d have slapped his face off before the first drink.”
“It’s going to be fine,” said Dean when Harry caught him in the kitchen. “Everything’s just a little bit awkward now because I acted like a lunatic. But that’s fine! That’s life, you know? Sometimes, you cock up spectacularly and everyone forgives you in the end. Usually via alcohol. Tonight will be perfect.”
They’d lost the others, but it didn’t matter. You only needed one good friend to make a night, and Hermione had the best friend a girl could ask for. They leant against the bar, laughing when boys came up to dance with them until they walked away, confused. Terry and Anthony were there for a bit, buying them shots and dancing with each other when the girls refused to general hoots, but then they disappeared to find Luna, who was apparently also here. Luna herself appeared later, looking ethereal in a dress made of feathers, and hugged Hermione when she ended up having a long, rambling confession about how she hadn’t liked her through school.
“Did you see Blaise do the splits?” said Harry, trying to land on a safe topic, and luckily Draco laughed.
“Ok, I kind of forgot you didn’t know about that one. I’m sorry – “
She thinned her lips. “Parvati, Hannah Abbot, Michael Corner, Anthony Goldstein, Theo Nott, and – you promise you won’t get weird, Harry?”
“I don’t think I could pull it off,” he said, and she laughed.
“Uhhh, yeah,” said Morag, trying not to look like she was drinking Bucky’s. “You’re Daphne, right?”
“Oh,” said Harry.
Harry opened his mouth, remembered that telling Ron that Malfoy had sucked his dick would probably lead to Ron’s untimely death, and shut it again.
As he wondered closer to it, it turned into the sound of vomiting.
“When have I ever behaved like that? You’ve been spending too much time with Gryffindors, you’ve forgotten how normal people act. Anyway, the two of you are so angular. The baby would get his nose and your cheekbones and end up piercing its way out of the womb.”
about?”
He took her hand. “Hermione. Sweetheart. I know exactly what you’re going to say?”
“When I said I owe you a favour I didn’t mean a sexual one,” he snapped.
Dean pulled away with a wet pop and raised his arms like a champion. “To the prettiest girl at the Royal College!” he crowed, and everyone raised their glasses in a salute.
But fuck it, he was brave.
“Oh won’t I. Potter, how many husbands has my mother had?”
Nott doing?”
“Decadence. Revelry. Surely an exquisite woman like you can appreciate the value of a good frolic.”
“I’m sorry.”
“You did
“That’s what our conversation was about the other day,” said Blaise. “Remember, can’t sleep, can’t eat?”
Hermione sighed. “What Dean is trying to say, Seamus, is that Ron and I broke up and I might not want to hear about him. But it’s
“What’s wrong with how you’re acting? Mostly it seems to just involve a lot of staring and occasionally sighing.”
“I can’t, Hermione! Then I’ll be alone with him, and what if he tries to talk about us?”
“We keep studying together,” he said miserably into his third cup of tea. Hermione, who had had so many cappuccinos she was about to find, if not God, at least some minor deity, nodded along. “But we also keep inviting Blaise and Seamus to hang out with us at the same time. Like we need some sort of chaperone.”
“Do you think he’d change his mind if I stabbed out his eyeballs with a fork?” said Nott, who had apparently moved on from his monosyllabic act and was showcasing the “threats of violence” aspect of his personality.
“A little,” said Malfoy. “Last time with Hermione didn’t go so well. Potter – Harry, I – “
“Woah,” said Harry again, because apparently all his brain cells were determined to desert him tonight. Draco was wearing an exquisitely tailored grey suit, with a deep blue waistcoat and a tie-scarf-thingy in palest silver. An opal the size of a baby’s fist was pinned at his neck, and Harry couldn’t quite tear his eyes away from it. The pale colours combined with his near-white colouring made him look ethereal and unreachable. A thousand miles away from the boy who writhed on his cock. Harry was getting hard just looking at him. He tore his gaze away and focused firmly on the grotty routing by the kitchen sink. Nothing arousing about mould. In the corner of his vision, he could see Draco smirk as he started discussing fabrics and cuts with Hermione and Parvati.
talk to
“Actually, I was looking for your girl there. But I see I’ve been beaten to it.” Terry gave a gracious half-bow, carried with just enough good humour to make it seem less ridiculous. “I’ll catch her some other time.”
– fine, sure. What’s next? Deontology? All right, that one’s simple, it’s just following rules. Oh, my mistake,
“You believed them.”
Michael was hunched over Susan in a way that was wrong. He was whispering something in her ear, and she was shaking with bleary eyes.
“The yelling suggests the opposite.”
She put her head in her hands and considered crying.
“Rude,” said Blaise. “Yes, a bit rude. How terrible of me. Of course I’ll invite Malfoy.”
“Oh god,” he whispered. His mind fluttered back through every interaction like a slideshow.
Draco called him Harry now, but only Potter when they were in bed – unless Harry was fucking him, when he forced him out of it. He asked Draco about it when they were lying there in the afterglow, legs tangled around each other.
Dean sobbed and sobbed, and Harry hugged him and stroked his back.
“You’ve smoked!”
“I may have made a slight miscalculation.”
“Who’s in the flat, Hermione.”
“I’m not going to believe it,” said Draco. “Not for a little while.”
“Why did you lie?”
“What?” said Harry. “It’s a big group. I probably won’t even talk to him.”
They sat in silence for a while longer. Pansy stubbed out her cigarette.
“I’m wonderful with a decorating charm, Potter.”
Malfoy bared his teeth in what was nearly a smile. “Neither can I. But I guess we all have to learn new skills in this brave new world.”
“Right,” said Susan, breaking off. “Why were you eavesdropping?”
“Dark Artefacts research?”
“I do.” They were very close now. Draco’s eyes could have drowned continents. “I think I really do.”
“Yes, you’re a master detective,” he muttered. “Anyway, how’s your sad gay love story?”
“There’s always going to be an exception to that rule,” said Malfoy. “I can’t think what it is, but I just know it. Think of Umbridge.”
“So it’s not really leaving, you see. It’s just – “
“You think Seamus is traumatised?”
“You just said that to remind me that you’re taller than me now, didn’t you?”
“What was the message?” said Dean.
and – “
“Wait, wait. Go back. When was this?”
“Well, I’m going, aren’t I?”
“Stay quiet,” muttered Blaise, moving swiftly. There was Michael Corner, sitting at a sad table at the back alone and downing what looked to be his third whiskey.
“That’s four thank-yous between us this week, Malf- Draco.”
it was
“I – well, I – “
Malfoy smiled. “Granger? Have you ever heard of a Muggle called Kant? Personally I think he’s bloody inflexible, but then so is Granger. All right, I’ve helped you out enough. My teeth practically hurt with all the altruism. I’ll see you around, Potter.”
“Ugh.” She buried her head in her hands. “Maybe I should just get back with Ron and have his terrible ginger babies.”
They made their way to the apparition point once the last two girls appeared – Hannah in a corn-flower blue minidress that was so short it might have just been a top, Morag in a much better suit than him. Draco took his arm as they started off, and Harry looked at him. This wasn’t what they normally did, was it? But Draco seemed determined not to acknowledge it apart from a small upturn at the corners of his mouth, so Harry ignored the sparks of electricity along his arm and focused on the chatter around him, and on willing down his slight erection. He’d been shagging Malfoy for about a month, it seemed ridiculous that just holding his arm could give him such a reaction.
“Look,” said Blaise, leaning over. “I’ve got a baggy of something in my pocket that might just help you relax. Why don’t we head outside, have a little and then send Potter home while we scout for some more receptive beauties?”
“Uh huh.”
“Ron.” He held out the glass, pleadingly. Draco slapped his hand.
“Totally,” said Harry, without feeling.
“Shh, shh.” Harry settled onto the bed, stroking Dean’s hair. “I’m here, ok? I’m your mate first, Dean. Just let it out. It’s going to be all right.”
“You look nice,” said Seamus, swaying a little. He’d wrapped both arms around Dean’s waist, pulling him in closer. It was almost like they were slow-dancing. Seamus’s eyes were blue-green and wild. “You always look nice. You pulling any girls tonight? Or boys? Don’t pull Blaise, though.”
inheriting the Black family madness. “Would you please listen to me. I was not in love with Harry Potter at school!”
“Well,” said Draco. “There goes our rapport. That lasted – what, a week? See you round, Potter.”
“It’s a thing Muggles do,” said Hermione. “They, uh, they blacken their face and wear clothes covered in rags and put bells around their ankles. And then they dance around with sticks. And they hit the sticks together.”
“And brush your teeth, your breath is atrocious,” said Malfoy, before blushing. “I should also go and lie down in a darkened room and avoid loud noises.”
“Oh yeah?”
“He told me himself. I’ve spent all this time running through the reasons they’d do that, and it’s just because he’s queer.”
“Gryffindor,” said Harry without thinking, and then scowled at himself. “Sorry, I know I sound like a twat. But intelligence and patience are very nice, but they’re not really moral ideals, are they?”
“All right. Fuck, marry, kill. Anthony, Michael, Terry.”
She tried to put everything she was thinking about into those three words. That she’d been wrong, every time she’d looked at Lavender and just seen frills and flirtation and girliness. That there had always been bravery in her, even in the moments Hermione had written off – that it was brave, actually, to throw yourself at the sports hero in the middle of the common room and hope for the best. That everything she’d ever thought about Lavender, and Parvati by extension, had been more about herself than the two of them. That there were more ways to be brave than she counted.
“Can’t sleep, can’t eat, every song reminds you of him,” said Blaise, checking them off on his fingers. “You know, Draco, those are pretty common symptoms of – of something.”
Draco drained the glass, steadied himself and continued his crowing. “Write a letter to Macgonagall, tell her the Great Hall is going green. Finally, Slytherin has triumphed! Weasley, tell Shacklebolt I shall expect my medal in the mail. Granger, feel free to tell me how terribly handsome I am.”
Draco snorted. “Please, Pans. As if they’d have to be false.”
“Any, Harry, that’s not the point – you just pick
She kept her eyes down. Her voice was shaking. “They just – they just
“Yeah. She did.”
“Maybe they’d want to have Christmas by themselves,” he said.
“Oh Ron,” said Susan. “Don’t worry, the aurors are really good at transferring partners when personal issues get in the way. Tough luck on this happening the day you get back together, Hermione.”
“Unpleasant, yes,” said Blaise. His smile was beginning to look like it hurt. “Seamus, it’s your turn, isn’t it?”
that must have startled the birds outside. He collapsed on top of Draco’s back, which was shaking. He was actually shaking, Harry had fucked him so well. He was –
He just had to find Draco. He could make this all right.
“Why worse with me?”
“I think you missed one out there,” said Harry softly.
“Sappho?”
They made it to their dorm to discover the prone form of Michael Corner slumped outside the door, keycard held limply in his right hand.
“Enchanting,” said Anthony, threading a hand through Theo’s with mock-earnestness. “Delightful. Delicious.”
“Sure,” she said, shutting the door in his face. Apology accepted, then. Maybe it was best not to visit Harry right now – in her worked up state, she’d definitely end up telling him, and then she’d have to endure Harry Talking About Malfoy.
Dean sighed. “I think I’m going to head. You stay here, Harry.”
He scowled, and then seemed to remember what he was doing. “I have been rude, and prejudiced, and bigoted to you for half your life. I’m trying to make amends now. Well, I’m trying to think of ways to make amends now. AndIwouldappreciateitifyoudidn’ttellPotteraboutthis.” He took a deep, wheezing breath. “There. Ok. All finished.”
“Oh, all right then,” said Harry, trying to put on some good cheer. “I was only going to unpack anyway. We can save that for tomorrow.”
“No, I think I’m just done with men for a bit,” said Hermione. Fuck. That was possibly
“And the Gryffindor common room was different how, exactly?” said Draco.
“I don’t think he wants you back anymore, Hermione.”
Was this how it was going to be? Now that the war and all their adventures weren’t binding them together, were Ron and Hermione going to realise that Harry was more trouble than he was worth? It was probably strange to stay close to the same people who’d been your best friends at eleven for the rest of your life. Ron was well-muscled and heroic now, and Hermione was made-up and pretty and finally discovering life outside of books – or life in different books, at any rate. They’d probably meet up soon and discover how wonderful the other was, and then they’d be back in a relationship and Harry would be even further out than he had ever been.
Malfoy’s hands were shaking, just a little bit. “I was just looking for Blaise.”
“She’s great, Harry. I wish you could have stayed that time we ran into you in the pub. She’s really easy to get along with. I think you’ll like her, once you get to know her.”
“White-outs,” said Parvati.
“Honestly? No. I don’t get a fresh start. I’m going to have to live with the war my whole bloody life. I see Dumbledore fall from that tower every night. Why should they?”
“It’s no fun when you fight back,” said Daphne, pouting.
“What?”
“Ron, what are you doing,” hissed Harry.
“You mean to tell me – that Weasley – he – “
you do in my head?” Draco snickered. “Sorry, sorry. Mostly you disapprove.”
“Malfoy’s not dating Pansy.”
“Blaise has no taste, Theo tolerates me only through prolonged exposure, and I have dirt on Pansy. Everyone else in Slytherin liked me because my father was powerful. Now I’m – I’m nothing.” He sighed. “But if you’re serious – thank you, Potter. I insist on getting the round of shots though. That was my stupid idea.”
“Hi,” he said, because he was stupid.
“Blaise here is asking us out for a drink,” said Seamus, in a slightly strangled tone of voice.
She blinked. “Well, there was some experimentation into this in the 1860’s, when – “
“Do you want to dance, Hermione?” said Parvati.
Or maybe – Draco hadn’t been invited. He hadn’t wanted to walk in front of the photographers. Everyone here had warmed to him, sure, but to the outside world he was still a Death Eater. Funny how easy that was to forget. He’d only agreed to go with Harry, hadn’t he? Maybe people had started being shitty to him, once he was on his own. Blaise had probably been busy with Susan, leaving Draco to wonder round being norman no-mates. He’d probably just got bored.
Harry had said
“We can steal some from Blaise. He’s got some fancy Italian shit. Come oonnnnn.”
Well, apart from Draco and Blaise, who kept up a steady stream of beauties. And Hermione. But that was only four out of fourteen, unless you counted Hermione’s binder of potential boyfriends. Well, Hannah seemed to have an off-again on-again text affair with a boy from her lectures. But that still left –
dressing up in whatever Draco picked out for him. He shot it back. God, if that was the nicest he was not prepared for the worst.
“That’s why I called you,” said Blaise, doubled over and panting. “I thought to myself ‘who’s most likely to be down to commit a violent crime?’ and you came instantly to mind.”
There were another few seconds of intense, fearful eye contact from them both.
“Of course I do. I want him to be happy. I just – I deserve to be happy, don’t I?”
“Oh.” Parvati’s hand holding the bottle fumbled, and she caught it loosely. “Are you – committing to Terry or Anthony then?”
“Of course,” Draco sneered, looking every bit the schoolboy bully. “Well, I’ll just get on my knees for you, shall I? Or would you prefer me up against the wall?”
“I was just getting a glass of water,” said Hannah. “I’m heading right back.” She giggled, and then stopped. She was dressed oddly, in a long shirt that definitely wasn’t hers and Puddlemere slippers. “I’ll, um – “
“What about you?” said Harry, deciding to ignore the murder-suicide until it became an imminent threat.
“Pansy got beaten again today, Potter.” Malfoy leant over his desk until he was inches away from Harry’s face. “I get that I’ll always be hated. I understand that I’ll always be the monster in your story. But
“So,” said Harry, crossing his arms. “That kiss. That was something.”
It was his own room, for the first time in his life. His own room, where he could retreat to and be himself when he needed to, with no Dursleys bursting in and none of Neville’s magical plants spilling over the windowsill and trying to eat him and no faint smell of burnt Seamus and none of Dean’s drawing spread up on the wall and no Ron –
“Offy sounds good.”
“Susan and I – “
“Give me five minutes. Five minutes to fix this, please. Please, Susan, anything, anything you want, just give me five – “
“Fine,” said Theo, and let Draco drag him into the party and over to where Greg was sitting with Ginny, Luna and Harry.
“Bossed it. Seventy percent. Even Hermione was impressed. You?”
“What?” Draco’s eyes were expressive things, now that he looked properly. For one thing, the rest of his face was completely calm while his eyes were very, very
“Carries on like what?” said Dean.
“Wayne Lightfoot, when I first came out,” said Morag, her voice a low growl. “Gave me a long speech about how much he fancied me. He started tearing up. Asked me to just kiss him once, to give him closure. I felt like I was hurting him if I didn’t.”
“Do you want to dance?”
“Hermione included?”
“Course, he’ll probably be too busy sucking up to Blaise. Or sucking – whatever. Want to give me a hand with this tinsel, Harry?”
“Uh, actually - “
He’d thought that actually fucking might be some watershed moment, but it wasn’t. It was more of the same, more of them – this frantic need for each other’s bodies, the shared bewilderment that both of them could like this so much. The way that Draco would look at him like he couldn’t believe this.
Harry considered telling Hermione about all the lies, and then decided against it. She wasn’t exactly wrong. Ron had been pretty paternalistic, and he was planning to talk to her at Christmas, and he did desperately want to get out of the room.
And he stormed off towards the house, taking the joint with him. Dean stayed still and unmoving as a statue, until Harry laid a hand on his arm.
“I – I don’t know,” Harry said. Something shifted in Blaise’s face – some light going out in his eyes. He stepped closer, right into Harry’s face, which was quite a lot to deal with what with Blaise’s eyes and the cheekbones and the overpowering, expensive smell.
“But it is
“Doooon’t.” She buried her face in her hands. “I have nothing to wear. Nothing. Do you think I could just not go?”
“He used to undo Padma’s bra through her shirt and tell her to take a joke,” said Parvati. “And Michael tried it on with her, too. We all just let it slide, because we were sixteen and didn’t realise that it wasn’t ok.”
“Thinking of something else I’d rather lick.” He let his head fall backwards, trying to catch Draco’s mouth. Draco moved away, one hand squeezing Harry’s arse rather firmly as he did.
friendly, and turned without another word. In Harry’s shoulder, Michael began to stir.
“Yeah?”
“All right,” she said to the empty air he’d been in, pleased that that had gone so well.
“Weasley was your best friend for seven years. You’re not going to find something like that instantly.”
Harry’s grin was upsetting on so, so many levels. “Brill. I’ve got to Ron – I mean run. I’m meeting Ron. I don’t have to Ron. Anyway, I should – I’ll see you around, yeah? Maybe tomorrow.”
Michael was, unfortunately for them, breathing, so Harry released Nott once they’d gotten the door opened and dragged Michael up instead.
“So who’s looking after Dean?”
“Draco!” Harry said the next day, springing out of the bushes (?) outside his law lecture. “I’ve been looking for you for the past week, I just wanted to – “
“Good choice,” said Draco.
“I’m half American,” said Anthony.
“I’m just saying, waving it around like that – “
“An orange cut in half. A little bit.”
Her voice was trembling, her eyes shiny. Harry took a surreptitious look around and dragged her behind a conifer.
They were awkward because having Harry around had only made everything worse for their family, and they were too determined to treat him as though it hadn’t.
“I’m bisexual,” said Harry, keeping his voice low. He really, really didn’t want to see Blaise being scary again.
The next morning, Harry opened his eyes and saw Draco Malfoy. Well, more specifically, Draco Malfoy’s comically shocked eyes.
“Bloody Gryffindors,” said Draco, and pushed in.
Sirius had been drunk a lot, during Harry’s time with him at Grimmauld Place. Sometimes he’d called Harry
“You didn’t like him when he first showed up at uni, though.”
“Fuck,” said Dean. “Morag, are we tools of the patriarchy?”
“Find you? My dear boy, the only thing me and young Potter over here were looking for was some debauchery. Isn’t that right, Harry?”
Seamus ripped his arm away. “Bugger you both. Oh wait, that’s you job. Please make sure to spare me
“You’re one to talk about pointiness.”
“No,” said Blaise. He started to pace back and forth. “It’s just sinking in that I might actually go to jail. And I think I might be sick. Try not to judge me, will you? We don’t all have your penchant for savagery.”
“That – that fucking – man! Don’t look like that, Harry, you’re one too.”
“Potter, you’re a genius!”
He stared at her in despair. “Then why am I so miserable all the time?”
Harry shrugged. “No idea. Dean?”
“Her name was Charity, Blaise, and she seemed quite cheerful when she was making us pancakes this morning.”
“Not at all,” said Seamus. “And I’m doing, uh, - Architecture?” He sent a quick look round at the other passengers.
Pansy sneered. Harry filled with pride at Hermione’s new claws. A better friend would have stayed with her and backed her up. But he was rapidly realising he was quite a shit person, and Pansy might have important Draco related information –
“It means I like men and women. I swung both ways. Very liberally, if that interests you.” He winked at Dean. Harry expected a scoff, or a polite brush off. But Dean just smiled, in a way that he had definitely never smiled in the common room. Smiled with intent.
Ron grimaced. “Let us not speak of The Year That Never Was. Is she…” He trailed off, looking miserable.
Draco looked between them all, appealingly. When no help came, he turned to Pansy. “Refuse him, Pans.”
“Hush, Hermione, they’re different flavours. We’re going to mix and match. This one is quince, and this one is elderflower, and this one is a tomato one that Padma bought me as a joke. Every time you say something terrible you have to drink some of that as punishment.”
“I believe denial is your things, Bones.”
“But you two are friends again.”
He grimaced. “Overcrowded. But the summer in New York was the best. Here, let me get that.” He picked up her bag and slung it over his shoulder with no trouble at all, despite the fact that it was full of heavy tomes. Maybe he was windlessly lightening it, but he was also just very, very well-muscled. “Which are you?”
“As if that would stop you,” said Susan.
“Tell me if I’m out of line but – how would you feel if you’d never got to kiss Ron after the battle? I know you broke up, but – eight years leading up to something, you needed to know, right?”
“Not right now, Potter, I’m talking to-“
“It’s not her fault. I know you’re hurt, but she didn’t do anything wrong.”
Ron grinned. “Don’t need to.”
“Yeah. You’d have a crisis in the middle.”
“Sure,” said Harry. “Uh, yeah. I guess. Maybe.”
Susan rolled his eyes but accepted his arm with good grace, and when Harry turned back to Draco he was disappearing through the door with Ron, who shot him a thumbs up.
They were mates again. It was nice. It was fine. Harry wouldn’t push, whatever that meant. However much he wanted to.
“I have finally conquered Potter! I have achieved my lifelong dream! I can die a happy man now. Perhaps I’ll have a commemorative plate made up, with a picture of me drowning him in  a vat of tequila – “
“Sure looks like it.”
“Why are you hanging out with Seamus? I thought you wanted him to be ostra- ostra – ignored.”
“Do you want both?”
Malfoy looked at the ground. “Because I never had to beat Granger. I always had to beat you. And I lost.”
“Hmm,” said Ginny. “You know, Neville’s bi too. And Dean. Lots of options for Harry once you’re back in your right mind.”
She nodded, and he patted the grass. “Come sit with us. We’re doing drugs.”
The thought made his chest unexpectedly tight.
“What?”
“I really need to go,” said Harry, squeezing between two very angry women. Draco was still at the table.
“You’re staring again,” said Draco. “Knock it off, it’s rude. Anyway, we’re here.”
“So was I,” said Blaise. “Want to know why? Because I was fifteen and wanted to win the house cup and didn’t like you, none of which makes me a terrorist.” He leant forward. “Look, I’d like it if you stopped going on at both Nott and Malfoy, but I accept that it is – inevitable that you and Malfoy will have your – thing.” Harry wondered whether he should attempt to interpret those pregnant pauses, but decided against it. “But leave Theo out of it. I’m not going to give you the full story on his deeply disturbing childhood, because it’s not mine to tell. But he never wanted to be on either side of the war, and he did his damndest not to be. The only difference between me and him is that my mother smuggled me out of the country, and his father burnt him with lye if the Carrow’s reported he hadn’t tortured enough Muggleborns.” Blaise drank again. “And the only difference between Draco and Theo, by the way, is that Theo always knew his father was a monster and Draco made the mistake of loving his. Make of that what you will.”
“I’m about to,” he said, and kissed him.
“You know something?” Pansy’s voice was bored, idle. “I almost thought you’d changed for a second. Wouldn’t that have been something, Hermione Granger actually being interesting? But no, same old same old. Potter, Weasley and a chunky sweater.”
“Sorry, I just want  to – oof – trying to get – Theo, stop moving.”
“You had to come out as a Gryffindor lover. Which is far more shameful. I speak from experience.”
“If you don’t call me Harry, I’ll
“Why not?” said Parvati. Hermione just downed her drink in answer. “Oh. Is it serious?”
“Oh, Pans,” said Draco, quietly.
“Uh huh. Michael wrote a poem about you in sixth year, actually. Do you remember how you were paired with Oliver Rivers in Charms in Fifth Year? He practically took everyone else out at the knees trying to get the seat next to you.”
“Exactly. I mean, who wants to get tied into relationship in the first term of university?”
“All right, Potter.” He was whispering now, and Harry bent his head to hear. “I’m sorry. For everything. I’m sorry for the way I spoke about Weasley and Granger, and I’m really sorry if anything I’ve said has continued to cause pain over their lives. I’m sorry about the way I mocked your fear of dementors in third year. I’m well aware now of exactly how terrifying they are. I’m sorry about Potter Stinks – actually, I’m not, that one’s hilarious.” He was gathering steam now. “I’m sorry about siding with Umbridge. I’m so, so sorry that my actions that night may have contributed to your godfather’s death. From everything I know about him now, he sounds like a wonderful man. I could apologise till I’m blue in the face for sixth year, and it would never make it right. I’m sorry I tried to kill you in the Battle. I’m sorry I didn’t fight on the right side, even when I knew it was wrong. I’d known it was wrong for a long time. And most of all, I’m sorry I ever let it get to this. We had a normal schoolboy rivalry and I let it twist me to do terrible things. So let me finish with something that isn’t an apology. Thank you. Thank you for saving my life. You gave me the chance to build a better one.”
“All right,” said Pansy. “I wish I could say that I truly, dearly cared about the poor little victims I’ll be helping to avenge, but the truth is that after seventh year it looked like my plan of marrying rich and living in luxury for the rest of my life was out the window, and the Aurors seemed like a good place to channel my penchant for violence. Is that enough for you, Potter?”
“Yeah?”
“I broke a toe!” shrieked Draco, and Harry doubled over laughing and thought
Blaise rolled his eyes, but didn’t cease his frantic pacing. “Harry, you are not actually an Auror, and the Dark Lord is dead. It’s not your job to prevent every bit of dark magic you see.”
“It’s not about the flowers,” said Susan. “It’s about this whole –
“Your mother said that to you?” said Harry wonderingly. He tried to imagine Molly Weasley saying something like that to Ron. It would probably have been the end of Ron’s attempts at dancing or love-making, possibly forever.
She closed her eyes. “We should go to bed.”
“She’s just – she’s everything I’m not, you know?”
She looked pale and fragile, curled up on the bed. Harry took pity on her and scooped her under his arm.
“So,” said Blaise. He was smiling. “Which is it going to be, Michael? Drop out of university for a while, or an unfortunate accident?”
“And how is that?”
“Uh huh,” she said, trying to extricate herself. “Yes, very funny, especially since we make absolutely no sense together – “
She turned and ran.
“I just miss my best mate,” said Dean. “Come on, we spent seven years attached at the hip and now we’re barely talking. I’m sorry, all right? Is that what you need me to say?”
He supposed he had. “So are you two together now?”
Draco sniffled. “I can go back to being horribly rude if you want.”
“Woah, woah, Harry.” Ron held up his hands placatingly. “I don’t think she’s, like, evil-in-the-proper-way. I just meant – it’s gonna be a bit awkward, isn’t it? And she’s always so mean. I’m not exactly the best at… well.”
Susan was on a date with Michael right now, which meant Blaise’s sighs were 20% more despondent. Harry had started to work out a system for them.
“Just Harry did some pretty good stuff.”
“You’re such an overdramatic bastard.” He stepped between Draco’s legs and touched his face. All those sharp angles and strange features, combined into something beautiful. “What I mean is that you should come and stay with me at Grimmauld Place.”
“Well, you know. No point getting dressed!” He ran out of the kitchen, spilling a decent amount of the water down his robe. Draco hissed when he saw it.
“I’ll just – er – I’ll be back in a minute, ‘Mione.” Pansy was tugging on his sleeve with surprising strength.
“Shh.” He bent back to Draco’s lips again. Why had they stopped kissing? Ever? Even for a second?
Back when she still remembered her, before magic had come like a wrecking ball into her life, Hermione’s mother had had a saying –
He ended up wandering home early, his head spinning from the dancing and the booze until it all got a bit much. Hermione gave him a half-hug and told him to be careful – her other arm was wrapped around Parvati’s waist – and he nodded blithely and stumbled off. It was a nice night, soft and clear, with a the moon a little over halfway out –
This time he did grab her, slinging one arm round her waist and reeling her in. “Susan, please – “
“Draco, just - “ He reached out, tangled his fingers over Draco’s. “We could, you know. Talk.”
“No, Krum.”
Malfoy was aiming to hurt, but there was nothing there to wound. Harry smiled. “We were never really together. And then we were definitely never together, because she realised she’s a lesbian.” And then he waited for Draco to say something hideous so he could hex him.
“Dean – “
Parvati flung her arms wide. “See!”
“I did finish one thing,” said Draco. “I’ll show you when we get to the block. It’s very impressive.”
“Anyway,” said Draco, beginning to walk again. “I’m now officially no longer the most hated person in the flat. Blaise has been bemoaning Seamus to anyone that will listen, which is
going to be in some back corner of my life, snarling at me and telling me that I’m not good enough and never will be. But you know what? I’ve realised something now. I don’t give a fuck about your opinion of me, never have. You come in here, talking about how you felt so, so sad when you thought I hadn’t changed. News flash, Chosen One – I didn’t change for you. Some things aren’t about you. If you want to walk around being disappointed in me, then enjoy it. I’m done.”
The Prophet, you enormous imbecile. How did you survive past the age of eight?”
“I’ve got a problem? You seem like the one who can’t get rid of me fast enough, mate. Slobbering all over Blaise Zabini – and isn’t that a fucking laugh, thousands of wizards to go for and you go for that prick – “
“Still a homophobic fuck, then?”
“Denial of how very badly you want me.”
“I’ll tell him,” she said, her eyes very wide. “But Malfoy, I think you should talk to him. He really wants to – “
“I think half the Ravenclaw boys are. Michael Corner tried to invite her to some poetry thing tonight, and Terry Boot wanted to have breakfast with her this morning.”
“She thinks we’re in competition,” said Hermione airily. She wiped her eyes. “She doesn’t know she’s welcome to whatever she wants.”
Harry shot him a glare. “I’ve never had sex with someone who –
“Something like that,” said Seamus. “I didn’t see the note. He just told me to get you for Hermione and then sprinted off.”
“They’re like – they’re like these big lizards that roamed the earth millions of years ago. A bit like dragons but more, uh. Birdlike. But no wings. Well, some had wings. But no fire. I think.”
He was excited. University was a time for trying new things, and Harry was sure that he was going to love house parties.
Seamus was laughing again. “I wish. Oh I wish it was. It’s funny, really. The least funny hilarious thing in the entire world.”
“Yes. Yes fucking way. I got mauled, Potter. And no one did anything to avenge my pain. I still have a scar on my arm – “
“Sure,” he said. “We should go to bed. Want another drink?”
The other guy turned around. He was good looking, Harry supposed, if you liked them dark and rumpled. “Do you know this guy, Draco?”
Morag snorted. “Is Seamus asleep? Straight girls can be so oblivious can’t they, Parvati?”
“I’m not,” said Dean absently. “Oh. Oh. I’m not. Hey, wanna make out?”
Ron turned bright red.
“I’m not going to say anything like ‘I would be all right if you dated,’ because that presumes that you would
“He almost certainly is,” said Pansy.
“I’ll be right back,” he said, jerking his thumb towards the kitchen. “I just need to get a drink.”
“Go,” said Draco. “I want to get in some proper Weasley torture time.” But he was grinning while he said it, so it was all right.
“Sea – “
“Yeah. I’m bringing Parkinson. Can’t say I’m ever going to be the slimy gits biggest fan, but if you’re all getting along with him then I suppose he must have changed. Ugh, he’ll probably end up copping off with Parkinson there.”
“I was just looking for the loo,” said Harry. Since when had Seamus called him Potter? Not since fifth year, when –
“Potter helped you beat someone up?”
Anthony covered his face. “It was oregano, wasn’t it?”
“I’ll come too,” said Draco, and he busied himself around Hermione’s room, shaking out blankets and lighting candles and plumping pillows while Harry sat on the floor with Hermione and held her hand. After a while Parvati came in, and the two of them curled up together on the bed.
“You’re in a sham engagement to a woman who’s sleeping with half of London,” said Pansy.
“Maybe – stop doing that?” she suggested gently. Harry’s look made her wonder if her tone had not been as gentle as she thought.
Draco fucked Harry for the first time a few days later.
needed to be brave to save the world.”
“She does, she’s just a liar.” Draco put a hand on her shoulder. “Listen. You are beautiful. You are clever. You are kind. You could deserve a girl like that.”
“That would be none,” said Harry, when it seemed clear that Michael wasn’t going to respond.
It was nice there, in the bubble of Blaise and Susan’s meanness. Harry wanted to stay there forever, but unfortunately nature called, and he stood up to make his way to the bathroom. Or the bathroom queue, anyway. It didn’t seem to be moving at all, and by the time Harry had made his way to the front he was almost crossing his legs and bouncing, and had worked his way up into quite a fury.
Whatever. He would bang on every door until he found him. He was on a righteous quest for his god-given, well-owed apology.
Malfoy shrugged. “Go on, then. I suppose it can’t hurt.”
“Good luck, mate,” said Harry, and pulled his head out of the fire. He sat down heavily against the stone of the fireplace and looked around his room. He should really get to unpacking. He really should. He would, any minute now. It was just –
Ron was clinging to the edge of the table, rocking back and forth. He’d done the last shot for Draco – something disgusting called a
Draco didn’t show up that night. He did show up the next, at nine, looking furtive and shifty. Which was actually rather par for the course.
“Hermione, would you – wait, that isn’t your room.”
“Ok, my favour. I’m going to ask you a question, and you have to answer absolutely honestly, and you can’t tell anyone that this ever happened.”
“Some of us don’t need to get our tits out – “
Draco met them just inside the door, pressing a drink into both of their hands and a kiss to Harry’s cheek.  “Thanks for taking care of him, Thomas. Ron’s waiting out back – they’ve set up a VIP area for us.
The alcohol and the music and the general air of bonhomie worked to reduce Harry’s mood, but he couldn’t quite shake the Malfoy incident, so he waited till Susan had gone to get a new drink and Dean and Morag were distracted by arguing over the music – Dean wanted to put on Mariah Carey’s latest, Morag was championing something called
“Thank you, Zabini! I mean, there’s two sides to every story, you know? No one’s interested in my side. It’s all oh, he’s a man, he must be evil.”
“What?” he’d said, when Hermione looked outraged. “I’ve already died twice. I’m probably unkillable at this point.”
“Don’t just – don’t just ‘ugh, Parkinson’ her, ok? I mean, you’re mates with Blaise Zabini, and you’re getting on with fucking Malfoy now, and he was actually a Death Eater which Pansy wasn’t, thank you very much. I mean, is it really too much to imagine she’s changed too?”
“A good incentive to stop you from fucking up.”
Nobody noticed when he left the pub. He moped along, barely even feeling when it started to rain. Ron would know what to do. Ron wouldn’t throw him over for someone new. Except Ron had his exciting new auror life now. And Pansy. He’d been drinking with Draco too. He’d probably tell Harry he was being ridiculous, and that he needed to get over himself.
“Just, I’ve never had to end things with someone I was only seeing casually before. I wasn’t sure how much was too much, you know? I want to treat this with the appropriate gravitas, but not too much gravitas, otherwise I’m essentially implying that you were far more into me than you were – but you beat me too it, and honestly I’m so glad, there’s so much more for us to explore – “
“I assume that Potter tells you everything,” he said as they sat down, “so I see no need to fill you in on the details.”
“Service with a smile,” muttered Harry, which earned him a sharp look.
She pushed him off. “You’re – fuck it, fine. Go on. Five minutes.”
But that wasn’t Dean’s problem. He reached up and played with Sea’s curls, because they were drunk. Because it was ok when they were drunk. Always had been.
“Of course you aren’t.”
“Jesus Christ,” said Blaise. “Could we maybe have spread out the drama?”
“Good,” said the Seamus in the present. He was plastered along Dean’s front, which was dangerous. He was slightly hard from the memory and the proximity. “Come and dance with me. I’m a good dancer.”
“Ron.”
“I respect you more than any woman I’ve ever bloody met!” roared Blaise. “I – I’m pretty deeply in – in respect with you.”
“It’s about Parkinson.”
“Yes, let’s all greet each other,” said Pansy. She was not looking at Hermione.  “Well, we came over to do that, and now we’ve done that. Best be off.”
“I guess it’s hard enough for me with my dad, knowing that I’m not his biologically. Now there’s one more way I’m different from the rest of my family,” Dean said fifteen minutes later, arm in arm with Harry.
But it might be worth it.
Pansy rolled her eyes, but the look she shot Ron was almost fond. On Harry’s other side, Draco was looking between the two of them, something between interest and concern wrinkling his brow.
“I haven’t seen her out with any boys,” said Harry.
And on that not-entirely reassuring note, they all retired to bed as dawn broke.
“Padma is a bloody genius,” said Harry, and Blaise responded with a hearty “Hear, hear.” He had his arm wrapped around Susan’s shoulders, who was herself resplendent in a white silk shift dress, a white fur shrug that Harry hoped was fake and about twenty pounds of diamonds. Blaise was in a dark purple silk blazer smattered with emerald green flowers. Harry was beginning to feel like he should have made more of an effort. He looked resignedly across at Seamus and Dean, who were dressed pretty much the same as him. Seamus was even wearing jeans under his blazer. Thank god there were some men left on earth who were just as crap at dressing.
“A what, Harry,” whispered Draco. His eyes were disappointed, and in that moment Harry hated them. People should be able to hide what they were feeling. It was only good manners.
The party was in full swing, which meant that everyone was inside dancing and laughing, which meant that Pansy was smoking on the balcony. She wrapped herself in her cardigan and tried to ignore the feeling of discontent. Of course she didn’t fit in at a party – her whole personality was about standing on the sidelines, throwing snark, not being there in the centre.
“Morag – “
He’d shrugged, hoping that would put her off, but instead she’d taken that as an opportunity to go through every single course she could find and quiz him on whether he’d ever found that subject interesting.
“Draco?”
“Then re-start it again! Or – I don’t know – do something! He’s miserable.”
“Oh, no.” She tore her hand from his grip to bury her face in it. “Does everyone know?”
“And that on Tuesday she went ice skating with Terry Boot.”
“Which one is tequila?”
“Generally I just tune him out if he’s being a twat.”
“Blame Pansy!”
“Malfoy?” said Seamus.
“What?” said Harry, trying to suppress the ridiculous grin that was spreading across his face too.
“Hello,” said Draco, shoving something acid green that Harry did
Susan’s face shivered, held, then broke. She held out her arms, and Blaise rushed to her, kneeling at the edge of the bed.
“I don’t know,” she whispered. “I think so.”
“Hello,” said Draco, voice smoky against his ear. “Slipping away to lick your wounds?”
“You have a very bright aura,” Luna said dreamily, skimming her arms over Greg’s shoulders. “Have you considered a career as a mind-healer? I imagine your presence would be very calming.”
She gave him a furious look from under her hair. “Please, Harry. We don’t have time for denials right now. I’m having an emotional crisis.”
It wasn’t Seamus, tight and flushed with booze and shouting in his ear. There wouldn’t be that feeling of invincibility. His breath wouldn’t stutter in his throat when he touched Neville, and his lungs wouldn’t burst, and his heart wouldn’t give out.
She eyed him. “It’s never going to not be weird, you know. You two being friends. How do you do it?”
“How’s helping Blaise with his thing tomorrow?”
“Are those frills around the neckline?” said Susan. “God, they are. Who’s still wearing frills in this day and age?”
“Worked on me,” said Draco, his voice heated. “Maybe you just need to tell him to fuck off in a really loud voice. Might shake an apology out of him.”
Draco just shivered, and let Harry wreck him. Harry gripped at Draco’s shoulders, back, ran his hands through his hair and pulled them together. He kissed Draco’s neck, nipped at his ears.
“I’m not a homophobe.”
Blaise peered at the CD case wearily, and then pulled back, shocked. “Yes. Yes it is. How did you – “
“I don’t think I can change either.” He stared down the depths of the bottle. “I think I’m just Harry forever. No one seems to need Just Harry anymore.”
He hadn’t been meant to see it at school. He’d been a bit of a shit about it, even if he hadn’t mentioned it to anyone. He reckoned it had been around third year – the point where Pansy stopped being a sure thing for him and had started to pine, quietly, for Ron Weasley.
“You’re lying, aren’t you? Fuck, I knew they were terrible. I had to go to a Muggle Tesco. And then I acted like a total buffoon and tried to pay with Galleons, because – “
“If they see us – “
“So we can fix the loneliness.”
“Well, there was Lav of course. And then when it became apparent that the whole kissing thing was something I wanted to talk about and Lav didn’t, I started doing a lot of reading. Most of that stuff I’d leant you. A lot of poetry. Muggle stuff. Wizards don’t seem to have a flourishing queer community, even though Sappho was definitely among us.”
“I’m going to read a book on Warding Law and feel absolutely nothing.”
and replace it with
“Yes or no answer, please.”
“I bloody am.”
“Really?”
“Has she spoken to Robards about it?”
“I still think I could have pulled off that Chudley Cannons jumper,” said Ron.
“Hey, Hermione, what are you doing here?”
“I’m morally opposed to this shitshow,” said Nott, who seemed disinclined to say more. Harry ran inside to Draco’s room, knocking frantically on his door.
“The Ravenclaws totally stole our idea,” said Dean as they settled onto a (distressingly sticky) table. “They’re doing a Last-Hurrah-of-Ravenclaw tonight.”
“Really?”
Ron sighed. “Well, she’s dating sodding Malfoy, isn’t she?”
“Yeah, yeah, you’re a regular little housewife.”
Draco pressed a shivering hand onto Harry’s chest. “Why don’t I show you.”
“Sorry,” he said. “Sorry, it’s just – we’re all going to be happy now, aren’t we? I’m being such a pillock. But, you know, two years ago I was all good with dying and I wasn’t sure if either of you were still alive, and now – “
“I don’t know,” Harry said. Ron currently felt a bit distant from him. They’d kept on floo-calling regularly, but it was difficult now their worlds were so different. And Ron kept talking about Pansy – apparently the
"Yes. And?"
“Sure, sure,” he called back, hoping she couldn’t hear the way he rolled his eyes as he said it. He wouldn’t put it past her, especially since she was holed up with Hermione.
Lavender glared at him, grabbing his drink as Draco passed and taking a swallow of it. She choked, staring incredulously into the half-full cup.
Harry snickered, remembering Draco's reaction to seeing some of their daily interactions reflected in the pages of the latest book. He'd been flattered and offended, just as Harry had predicted. They'd fought about it briefly, but since Harry could tell Draco was actually quite pleased with it because of the emotions coming through the bond, the fight hadn't lasted long.
"I –"
"Are you in?" Harry asked, the challenge clear in his voice. "We can set a
let Sly win. He wasn't going to give in, no matter how badly he wanted to come. His hand spasmed, sore from the furious pace of his strokes. They'd been at this for nearly twenty minutes, which was at least ten more than last time, probably more.
"You've definitely got the makings of a Slytherin on your hands, Harry," Neville said, tickling the boy in Harry's arms.
He'd been monitoring the press, looking for any rumors about Harry or Draco, but he hadn't seen today's
“Theo,” Draco whined, frowning at one of his oldest friends.

"No time," Blaise said, grabbing one of the heavy bags from Neville's shoulder and crouching to pull Cal to his chest in a fierce hug. "I know this is scary, Cal, but everything will be okay soon."
"It was bad enough when he found out he was writing to –" Pansy broke off, her eyes narrowing as pain wrapped around her skull, a fleeting warning that she was nearing the boundary.

been more than a day since he'd talked with Sly, after all – when the Floo roared to life.
Draco mused as he studied Potter, enjoying this opportunity to ogle his former rival. To the crowd, Draco knew he looked politely engaged, remote but attentive. In reality, he wasn't catching most of the questions Wedgewick and his cronies were firing at Potter, instead concentrating on the way his full lips curved when he smiled, parting to reveal straight, white teeth when he answered their requests.
"Neville," she said, kissing his cheek. She looked at Harry hesitantly, biting the bullet and leaning in to press her cool lips against his cheek as well. "Harry."
They were silent for a few more beats, until Harry gave a choked laugh, his eyes wide with panic and distress.
Blaise kissed the tear tracks on Cal's face, making silly smacking noises as he did. Encouraged by the boy's reluctant laughter, he shifted him, holding him upside down so he could tickle his belly with his free hand.
Draco looked over at Harry, a tentative smile lighting his face. He saw Harry exhale then beamed as the other man's lips curved as well.
She chewed on her lip nervously and Neville groaned. Whatever was coming couldn't possibly be good.
Harry groaned as Draco kissed a path down his jaw. He pushed at him weakly, not sure if he really wanted him to leave or not.
"It's how Draco Malfoy wears his hair," the stylist simpered, confirming Harry's fears. "It's a shame, really. All the good ones seem to be gay."
"Pansy," Harry said, returning the kiss. "We'd best get back in there before we're missed."
Harry's wand trembled slightly as he raised it.
Severus. Draco's grin widened as he stared at Potter, unable to stop the words that flew from his mouth.
"Draco?" Harry murmured, his back arching after a particularly hard stroke.
Kingsley knelt before Cal again, his wand pressed to the same spot. "
Draco glared at the house-elf that popped in, holding it personally accountable for the unusually late paper it held in its trembling hands. He was usually a kind master – nothing like his father had been – but he'd had a short temper over the last week. Everyone but Caleum had been reamed over something by the irritated blond lately, and as a result, no one other than Cal came near him unless it was necessary.
"You in the purple hat. You have a question?"
"M – Draco," Harry said, his expression thoroughly pleased. Draco swallowed hard, forcing himself to respond, wishing desperately that he'd been the cause of that smile instead of Smith. "Fancy meeting you here."
He paused, clenching his jaw. Damn it all, why was this so
He would
that had arrived yesterday – before darting off to pen a thank you note in reply.
Now, though, ten minutes before the ceremony was about to start, he was beginning to get anxious. He hadn't seen Blaise, Cal, Harry or Kingsley for more than an hour. He could feel Harry through their bond, so he knew the man was happy and excited – if not for that reassurance, Draco might have torn the chateau apart looking for him.
Pansy's frown grew as she turned to watch them, wondering how she'd possibly missed them on her way in. Of course, the box she was carrying was terribly heavy, so her attention had been focused on not dropping it, not on her surroundings, but still.
George sighed, pulling his robes around himself more securely. He cleared his throat, striving for some sort of dignity.
“I thought – “ Dean’s voice cracked. “Look, I was beginning to think some things that weren’t true, ok? About – about you and me. About possibilities. And I just realised that I’d been delusional.” He sniffed. “So there you go. There’s your story. Your little fag friend had a crush on you, so of course you had to leave him behind.”
“Wasn’t hard to work out,” she said. “Everyone else walked out of that cupboard and into a relationship, and you and Thomas buggered off in separate directions looking like you’d just heard that Ogdens was shutting down.”
“Fat lot of good it did either of us in the end,” she said, raising her tea-cup, and he clinked his against hers.
“I was asking Susan,” she said, not sparing Michael a look. “Not you.”
“No!” said Harry, images flashing across his vision of Blaise luring away his rivals in love and then burying them in shallow graves. He couldn’t die here. It would be a shit place to be a ghost. “I mean, yes, I care about her, but I’m not, like, into her – “
And so that was how Harry ended up opening Malfoy up with slick fingers while Malfoy talked him through it. Malfoy was warm around him, and the noises he made like this were so different to all the other times – he twisted and gasped and shuddered and at one point actually mewled, though he ruined the effect of that one by shooting an angry glance at Harry immediately afterwards.
“You two are so fucking weird,” said Hermione fondly. Pansy, less fondly, hummed her agreement.
“I don’t think Dean will like that,” said Harry, thinking of Dean’s broken form last night, his whispered confessions.
Ron was gaping at him. Harry tried to drink as much of his pint as he could without making it look like he was steeling himself.
Dean laughed and mock swooned. “Blaise, yes, yes, a thousand times yes.”
The assignment was to examine the pros and cons of three broad ethical theories – deontology, virtue ethics or utilitarianism – in seven hundred and fifty words. Harry had written seven –
“Should I be flattered?”
“No. My apology. Hermione got one, why didn’t I?”
“Is it weird that I actually kind of do?”
but she’s just ignoring them.”
“Actually getting some studying done,” said Harry.
“You can have both. Sex and friendship.”
“So how was Thomas?” said Draco, ambushing Harry as he came out of the campus coffee shop. He had something with whipped cream in his hand, and he looked far too happy for anyone’s sanity. “Good points? Bad points? Marks out of ten?”
“It’s an appletini, drink it. Pansy, I assume I don’t have to remind you of the code of Slytherin honour and the heinous penalty that awaits all who break it, do I?”
“Just because it’s on your skin doesn’t mean it’s true.”
“Am I annoying?” she blurted out.
“So we’re good, yeah?”
Draco waved his hand and screwed his face up. He couldn’t think very hard at the moment, but he was sure that if he did the motions like he was, clever thoughts would come. “You say stuff that’s literal, but you’re thinking about it – deeply.”
Blaise ignored him. “
Blaise was running around sorting out his “Balls-Out End of Term Extravaganza,” which he was still insisting on holding in the downstairs flat. Harry was thankfully separate from the planning process because Blaise said his taste was horrific. The same was not true of Draco, unfortunately.
“Hermione’s got mudblood written on her skin.”
“I am?”
“Oh god,” said Harry, looking around at his unpacked things. “Is this about Hermione? Because, you know, break ups are hard and all that – “
Dean leant against the railings of the balcony, and idly considered throwing himself off into the river.
“How’s the partnership going?” said Harry.
“My apology, Malfoy! Why didn’t – “
Had Malfoy changed his mind? Not just murmured false reassurances because he’d lost the war, but actually, truly realised what he’d done wrong?
you.” Blaise sounded very, very tired. “He’s just trying to rebuild his life. Just ignore him, and he’ll ignore you. He’s served his punishment as decided by society. Doesn’t he deserve a fresh start?”
“Pretty badly,” he said. “Turns out he’s in love with me.”
“When?” said Susan.
“I didn’t know I had a crushing loneliness.”
“It’s the loneliness,” said Hermione. “We’re both lonely.”
“I know about that,” said Harry. “Being the only non-white kid in the family, I mean.”
When Draco stumbled out of the loo, he found Theo, inexplicably in his path.
Hermione had survived her first real heartbreak, hadn’t she? And it wasn’t a heartbreak, it was just – the best sex of his life, and an unexpected friendship, and then both of those things had just stopped. At least he had the friendship back.
Michael twitched. “Well actually, I was just about to invite – “
“Yeah. Just peachy. I just mean – well, if someone’s in your head all the time. And it’s not even that you’re thinking about how wonderful they are, or how fit they look. You’re just obsessed with them. You want to know every single facet of them. You’ve got their voice inside your mind alongside your own. You dream about them talking to you. That kind of rubbish.”
“I don’t know. I have loads of lectures on Tuesday.”
“Go,” she said. “Now.”
“The twenty-ninth,” said Ron.
"I give you a symbol of my love, devotion and fidelity," he murmured, the words loud enough to reach the entire room but spoken only to Harry. "
He'd heard Potter was gay, of course, but it had never really registered until tonight. He wondered if Potter was attracted to women at all, or if he was only here to support Weasley. Draco watched him slam back another drink – his sixth since they'd entered the club less than an hour ago. He'd had no idea Potter was such a lush.
he asked himself, settling into his seat to await the start of the ceremony.
, but he wasn't sure what. He looked up, meeting Ron's furious gaze. They'd just successfully repelled the Killing Curse. He winced when moving produced a sharp pain in his side, shifting his shoulder experimentally. A hiss escaped through his clenched teeth – broken, most likely. He took another breath, grimacing when that caused more pain. Ribs too, then.
, of all people.
Harry's first instinct was to protest, but he bit his tongue. If Draco wanted him there, he'd be there, no matter how uncomfortable it was for him. And if Draco was so appalled by what he saw that he never wanted to speak with Harry again – well, they'd deal with that if it happened.
"Then you know that –"
he'd felt, but it hadn't been anything appropriate for the venue, or the speaker.
He knew Hermione would do her best to negotiate a shorter tour, knowing that Harry hated public appearances. Keeping up the glamour was draining, and he disliked being in large crowds. He hadn't been comfortable as the center of attention years ago, and he still wasn't now. Wearing a face that wasn't his made it somewhat easier, even though he'd recently begun to wonder why he'd chosen the features and coloring he had.
"Blaise called." It was a statement, not a question. Draco could read it in Neville's concerned features.
Ron's
Harry. His best friend.
Malfoy.
Draco's eyes widened at the contact, his cheeks immediately beginning to heat. He
Harry nodded, happy he hadn't told her about last night's run-in at the Diagon Alley meeting. There were only a few people who fit the description Hermione was giving him, and he'd just seen one of them.

"You'll never believe this, but I got the idea from Sly. We've been trying to get to know each other, and it turns out he had a Crup named Argyle when he was a boy," Harry said sheepishly. "I was thinking about him when this ending just fell into place."
"You win, you little monster," she teased, packing the tiny pieces away in the box with her wand. "I still say you cheat."
Draco groaned, nestling his face into the curve of Harry's neck. How did he end up in this position? All he wanted to do was shag the man through the floor, and the infuriating Gryffindor wanted to talk about hearts and roses?
It was Harry's turn to flush at the Minister's words. He glanced around the room, pleased to see his friends had all gathered to offer their support. He'd read about the oath he and Draco were about to take, so he was fully aware of the effect it would have on both them and everyone else in the room.
Draco was counting on some sort of violent reaction to the news, something to break the compulsion to continue answering. There was only one name left. Draco Malfoy didn't love many people, something he'd never lamented until now.
for the last few years took on a new meaning. He'd assumed it had been speculation and gossip, but maybe not.
Harry laughed, rolling his eyes at Neville. The other wizard knew exactly what he'd meant – he'd been the one to tell him Draco had been extremely pleased with the gift.
Harry grinned, an expression of total confidence settling over his features. He knew much of the world thought he had some sort of superhuman instincts or force guiding him, but he knew the truth. His hybrid Gryffindor and Slytherin qualities had served him well before, and he'd make them work to his advantage now. Harry Potter was a very determined man. When he wanted something, whether it was the end of Voldemort or Draco Malfoy's attention, he got it.
"Is he around?" Draco asked, peering deeper into the room through the Floo.
he missed that man. He'd give just about anything to know what his godfather would make of the ridiculous situation he found himself in with Potter.
"Even though they're blaming us for bodging it up?" He wasn't really surprised at Draco's order – he wasn't the type of man to let his client get taken advantage of, even if it was by a family member. And that client was technically no longer a client.
Draco shook his head sadly at Blaise, who was sprawled out on the sofa in his office when he returned from a meeting at Gringotts.
has been on the books since 1322, when Durward Ravenclaw was courting Luella Maitland. His family – descendants of Rowena – were against the match, because they claimed Luella came from an inferior magical background."
Draco gaped, his grey eyes darkening with lust as he watched Harry slap his palm repeatedly with the spatula. His mouth went dry as he imagined the feeling the silicone would make against his arse.
Draco studied the reticent wizard in front of him. Whatever Harry and his friends were planning, Draco knew he had no hope of forcing it out of Ron.
"Yes," she giggled, spraying Harry's hair with a potion that would keep it in place for the photo shoot. "It's called the Draco."
Harry – had just given Smith a million-watt smile and squeezed his shoulder affectionately.
"Did you hear that?" He whispered, sinking into a crouch, his wand at the ready instantly. He hated combat situations, and he was loath to ever use his wand for violence again, but that didn't mean those instincts had left him. He cocked his head, listening. "There."
He saw several reporters, Rita Skeeter among them, desperately trying to shout out questions. The Silencing Spell held, and Harry smirked.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Unfortunately, they aren't mine. *sniffs*
Zach smiled, clearly overestimating both men's self control. He had no idea how close to the edge he was skating.
Harry read it over again, unsure of whether to be worried or relieved. Half of what they had done? Had he done something stupid?
"Chessie!" He called, glowering at the house-elf who popped into view. "Where's Cal?"
"I love Pansy Parkinson-Wood."
"Ron and Hermione's," he said clearly, sticking his head into the green flames.
"With Malfoy," Harry added, quirking a brow when her eyes widened in surprise.
It seemed like a night that called for it, he mused, taking another sip from the leaded crystal glass.
"It sounds like you're falling for him, Harry," she said carefully. "We're just worried that you're going to get hurt. This is hardly conventional, you know. You're becoming attached to someone you've never even met."
He tried to think past the potion-induced haze in his mind, fighting to make sense of what was happening to him.
didn't like it, either.
"Not," Harry protested, his tongue feeling strangely thick as he tried to speak.
"I talked to him," Blaise said quietly from the doorway, unsure of whether or not his friend would want company tonight. "He's alright. Worried that you're unhappy, but okay."
Draco thought scathingly, his jaw clamped shut.
They'd been trying to explain the rules of courtship to Hermione for the last ten minutes, but she was still struggling to grasp everything.
feels
Harry clenched his hand reflexively, curling it around Draco's tighter as their joined skin heated. He could now see the magical energy he'd felt wrap around him earlier, pleased to note it was made up of the same crimson and green colors from the contract braided together. It pulsed around him like a living rope, the tendrils seeking out Draco's solidly green bonds until the three colors came together as one and merged into brilliant silver, so bright it almost hurt to look at it.
Harry sank into his desk chair, exhausted from a full day of editorial meetings for his latest book. The publisher had been pleased with his new photo for the book jacket, but now the publicist wanted him to agree to a three-week tour and media junket.
"Go say goodbye to Cal," Blaise instructed, shooing the angry wizard out of the room. They had an hour to kill before they could Floo to Harry's house, and he might hex the blond if he stayed underfoot. "I'll go down and get Nev and Daphne."
"And Fred and Roxie?" Harry asked, afraid of the answer. George and Angie's twins were a right menace, and he had a hard time believing they hadn't played a large role in this fiasco as well. It had been Draco's idea to have all the older cousins over for a few days, saying it would be fun for Cal and Teddy.
Hermione frowned, studying the seating arrangements, looking at the dwindling list of names in her hand. She bit her lip, her tone hesitant as she spoke.
Neville nodded, ruffling Cal's dark hair when the boy released his leg. He didn't know what he'd just agreed to, but he was sure it was something he'd probably regret.
Draco scowled at Theo, who laughed, tossing the bag he carried into a chair in the study.

his favorite restaurant, after all. "We've all met him, and we think they're the perfect couple. So well suited to each other. Unlike some of Harry's other partners."

"Yes, Minister, that is my wish."
"Minister," Draco said, inclining his head politely as he shook the larger man's hand.
"Alright, fine," Neville conceded, grinning as well. "It
"He sounds too good to be true – probably has the looks of a troll," Draco said with a weak laugh. He hadn't even admitted to himself how much he wanted this internet dating venture to pan out; now that he had found someone remotely interesting, his courage was faltering.
The blond glared at Blaise, marching over to snatch his wand from the man's outstretched hand. He'd been irritable for the past few days, since their chaperones – namely Blaise and Hermione – had decided it was inadvisable for Draco and Harry to see each other at all until the day the no-touching ban ended.
Author’s note: There will be a het scene in this chapter. If that squicks you, don’t read the end.
. He didn't bother reading the article – likely more drivel about who the slimy Slytherin was dating now.
Draco stared at the letter in his now-trembling hand, the cock ring twined around his fingers.
"Just a few more procedural things about the Monday night meeting," Blaise said, his body tensed to flee as he forced his voice to remain calm. "Wedgewick has requested you attend naked. It's a formality, really. It will simply make it easier for you when you trade sexual favors for the votes you need."

"So Draco was over for dinner. It seems he's met someone. Online." Her gaze was steady as she studied Neville. She saw him stiffen, confirming her suspicions. "Nev, what the fuck is going on?"
Blaise shook his head, pouring himself another cup of tea. Draco was grinning like an idiot again.
Blaise's eyes widened at Ron's words, and he grabbed both of them, roughly pulling the two men into an empty hospital room.
growl softly, suddenly furious with the witch. She'd known all this time, and she hadn't said anything? She'd had ample opportunity whilst delivering the food and wine they'd sent back and forth, not to mention the other small gifts they'd exchanged. Like his manuscript.
"You know," Ron hissed, rolling his eyes. "About Harry? If there was something I should know? About Sly? The

"Oh, I will," Ron promised, shaking his head again. "Idiot."
Luna smiled softly, nuzzling her face against the warm bundle in her arms before handing it over to Harry. Draco stood behind him, a look of complete awe on his face.
Hermione fussed with Harry's newly lightened and lengthened hair, tucking it behind his ear and then changing her mind, roughing up the blond strands.
Draco's teeth were clenched so tightly his jaw ached, a welcome distraction from the fire burning in his lower belly. He needed to come so badly he was nearly whimpering, but he wasn't going to give in that easily. He'd been the one to signal Gryffin the first time they did this, and he wasn't going to be the one to do it this time.
Harry laughed, waggling his eyebrows suggestively as he advanced, knowing Draco would have no choice but to step back and let him through the doorway. It was the first time he'd been grateful for the no-touching rule.
left in the dorm? Everyone’s already there.”
Draco's eyes snapped open, his body stiffening. Hair Thickening Potion's main ingredient was bicorn horn, and combined with the aconite in Veritaserum it would create thick fumes that were extremely poisonous. The effects were similar to a strong Memory Charm, essentially Obliviating the person unlucky enough to breath them.
Hermione had been the one to suggest he start writing, though her original idea had been a set of memoirs. Harry had no interest in rehashing his past for all the world to see, though Merlin knew enough unauthorized biographies of Harry Potter had cropped up after the end of the war. He had been intrigued by writing about some of the odder crimes he had worked on as an Auror, which had led to the idea of a series about Aurors who specialize in hard-to-solve cases and tricky spell work. Hermione had been working in an unfulfilling job at a wizarding publishing house, languishing in its textbook division. They made the decision to set up shop on their own, and both had been successful ever since. Hermione now represented dozens of authors, making a tidy commission off of all of them, most of all Harry.
"I have my own inheritance, Ms. Ireson," Harry said, giving her a cheeky grin. "But I do have a job."
Neville sighed, tired of cryptic answers. In truth, he didn't know if Draco was alright or not. He'd barely gotten more than a half-dozen words out of his friend before leaving him to question Harry.
"You'll be making something special for dinner, I wager, to go with the fancy new wine," Blaise said, his eyes on his friend, wondering how a simple bottle of wine could give Draco such a wistful expression.
The parchment shimmered, the words 'Certificate of Binding Marriage' appearing across the top in regal script.
Harry blew out a breath, stepping into the kitchen. He pulled out a bottle of his favorite Shiraz, decanting it to let it breathe. He figured the wait would be easier with something to drink. He'd felt bold and daring while penning the letter to Sly, but some of that Gryffindor braveness deserted him now. What if he didn't show up? Or worse, what if he showed up but thought Harry was some sort of perverted freak for suggesting the game?
Harry had jotted a few hasty words underneath in ink, but Draco didn't notice. He felt hot and dizzy. Harry Potter had professed his love for him in a best-selling book. Millions of people would see it. They might not know it was Harry, or that Harry was talking about him, but
"We divorced in 2005. January," he said with a grim smile. "Start the New Year off right, she'd said."
"I'm a writer. You've probably heard of me – I go by the penname James Evans."
“T-that was H-Hermione’s,” he stammered, his face scarlet with embarrassment, excitement and the effort of keeping his moans quiet.
He tapped the parchment again, the words he had spoken scrawling across the bottom of the contract.
Draco's wife had divorced him when Caleum was 2, tired of essentially living in hiding with the boy. He'd paid her a substantial sum to take an Unbreakable Vow to keep Cal's existence a secret, and she'd left without so much as a goodbye to her son.

Harry had gone more than an hour ago to “help Draco set up the party”, which Ron was pretty sure was a thinly veiled excuse for a pre-party fuck. Even Seamus had already left.

more than once, and with Harry's luck, something horrible would happen.
"Silly Muggles," Harry agreed, his hips bucking up to seek deeper entrance into Draco's wonderfully soft and wet mouth.
Draco's need for privacy was more for his son than for himself; the first – and last – time a reporter took a photo of Caleum out in public Draco had snapped, very nearly broken the man's neck, not just his camera. He'd let him go with a simple Memory charm and a smashed camera, but he'd taken extra precautions ever since. Blaise understood Draco's reluctance to take things further with Gryffin. Though they hadn't even met yet, the relationship between Draco and the mystery man was already deeper than any he'd had with his other lovers.
"It'll take us awhile to complete, if we open a bottle every year, but it'll be worth it, won't it?" He asked, his heart thumping painfully while he waited for Harry's reaction.
