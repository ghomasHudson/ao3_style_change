“Uh, thanks, Remus.” Harry said, his voice a little quieter than usual. As he spoke, the black-haired man looked up at him, pinning him with his silver-grey eyes.
Sirius finally dragged himself out of his and Remus’ room at 10:30, moving zombie-like into the kitchen and pouring himself a large mug of coffee from the pot Remus had left. He downed it, ignoring the way it burned going down, and refilled his cup, feeling marginally more awake as he made his way into the living room.
“I don’t know. I mean, they were scared of me, because I had magic, and my Aunt Petunia was really jealous of my mum when she went to Hogwarts, but I don’t know. They just hated anything that wasn’t ‘normal’, and since I checked basically all of their ‘abnormal’ boxes, I guess it was easy for them to just hate me, even when I was a baby.” Harry put his plate down on the table and pulled his legs up to his chest, picking at a loose seam of Remus’ old sweater.
“Thank you for looking after me.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, sitting upright on the bed across from Draco, one leg curled under him with his bad leg stretched out, his hair even more unruly than usual thanks to having had Draco’s hands in it for hours.
Draco had never met Sirius Black, and he wasn’t quite sure what to expect, but he was simultaneously surprised and unsurprised to see a handsome man with shaggy black hair and a worn leather jacket walk in to the room they’d set up to record in. He had the same eyes as Draco, and similar cheekbones as well, but that was about where the similarities ended. Where Draco was tall, Sirius was short, where Draco’s hair was fair and fine, Sirius’ was thick and dark.
“Because the way they treat you is fucking disgusting?” He raised one pointed, perfectly shaped blond brow.
“You’re queer?” Draco’s silvery eyes were wide. He couldn’t believe it. The man he’d been in love with since first year liked men! And was cuddling him! “Sorry, not the part I should be focusing on.”
"Right, I understand that, Granger, but what about something that would only transfer your mind? There surely must be a way to do it; time turners exist, and so do spells that can transfer someone's consciousness to another person's body, so there must be some way to combine the two forms of magic to return someone's mind to their younger body, don't you think? It would surely be possible to incorporate a spell like
“Yes! I was told they were driving drunk and died in a car crash!” Harry was angry- not at Shacklebolt, of course, but at the Dursleys for lying to him.
Regardless, the center was closed down. The boys were allowed to go home with their families until further arraignments were made, and those like Harry, who had no families to return to, were allowed to stay in their rooms. The night most of the boys left, Harry picked the lock to the storage room and nicked all of the trousers, boots, pyjamas and t-shirts that would fit him, along with one of the black backpacks that no one ever got (not even him). He would be the first to admit that he had grown incredibly fond of the uniform, and he knew it wasn’t so obviously a uniform that he would be unable to get away with wearing it in public, wherever he was sent. Besides, good clothes and shoes are good clothes and shoes.
The next morning, Harry woke as normal and thanked god that Remus had another little coffee pod machine in the sitting room. He gulped down his cappuccino and rinsed his mug before heading to take a shower. Once he was showered, he dressed in his uniform, his black oversized sweater and his boots and grabbed a pack of fags.
"Yeah, a few times. I did it on purpose on Saturday so I could see what that would be like, and it was really nice." He blushed as he admitted that.
“Oh, Lucius!” Narcissa pulled her husband up and into an embrace and leaned up to kiss his cheek chastely.
Harry blushed and looked down at his feet. “I- Some new shoes would be good, if that’s possible. These are the only ones I have.”
“Uh. It basically means that my brain works a bit differently?” He didn’t seem too confident in his explanation. “Like, I don’t do too good with social… stuff, and I sort of have, uhm, sensory issues? So, sound can get really overwhelming, so can bright lights, or like, I have issues with certain textures or whatever, and, I don’t know, I can get, like obsessive over things? And even though I’m really sarcastic, I don’t always notice when other people use sarcasm? I don’t know.” He looked like he was really struggling with his explanation, his face scrunched up and his hands flapping again.
“Shit.” He said to himself, finally looking up at the other person, only to realize it was the gorgeous blond guy he’d seen yesterday. ‘Oh fuck. Okay, come on, Harry, just ask him for a light. He’s just another student, it’s all good.’ He thought to himself. “Can I borrow a light?” Harry’s voice was as flat and even as ever and he mentally sighed in relief.
Draco’s cheeks were dusted pink, and he couldn’t help but think that Harry was adorable, his soft brown cheeks flushed red. “I can’t go back to my dorm.”
Draco dropped down on the sofa heavily and pulled his long legs up to fold underneath him before grabbing his plate. He took a bite and groaned. “Salazar, Harry, where did you learn to cook like this?”
Mind magic- legilimens translatio – thought transfer, legilimens translatio totalis – full thought transfer, mens capitat – mind transfer
“Yeah, and now I’m going to be homeless and broke and I can’t even go in to the dorms because my roommates are all homophobic as well.”
“Yes, that’s good.” Draco pulled the blanket from our shoulders and laid down on the bed, waiting until I was laid beside him, our chests almost touching, before pulling the blanket back over us. I laid my head on his pillow, just looking at him. He really was absolutely gorgeous. His cheekbones were high and regal, his jawline sharp and angular. His eyes, when they were open, were as silver as the mercury we used in potions class, and his lips, currently slightly parted, were perfect and pointed. I could see the white scar up the left side of his face, tapering off just before it hit his cheekbone, that I knew was caused by the sectumsempra I’d hit him with in sixth year- I had apologised to him for that at his trial, and he had assured me it was okay. I reached up my right hand and ran it along the scar lightly, and his eyes fluttered open. “What are you doing?”
It took about three tries before Neville's legillimens broke through, and Harry was violently flung into a memory from when he was around 9.
“Correct again. Now, Potter, let’s see how you do with one more. What is the mass of 12 dm3 of oxygen gas?”
"Was gonna happen sooner or later, I guess. We'll have a look now." Harry hung up the phone before waiting for a reply and loaded up the Daily Prophet website. The first link had a photograph of Harry and Draco in Knocturn the day before. He groaned when he saw the "By Rita Skeeter" byline. "Love, apparently Skeeter's outed us."
"It's just- I keep finding myself acting like- like a little kid! Like, I just got a TV, right? And I always end up watching cartoons, which on its own, not too weird, right? But then I end up like feeling younger, and like sucking my thumb or whatever, and it's just weird!"
Once dry and shut behind his canopy drapes, Draco dug through his trunk until he found some of his ‘Difficult Day’ clothes. Thick, soft grey muggle leggings with the tags removed, big blue fuzzy socks that gathered comfortably around his slender ankles and an oversized dusty-rose chenille sweater that fell almost to his knees. He had a selection of clothes like these that were comfortable for him to wear when he was having one of his Bad Days. He cast a quick
"Mngfh, morning." Ron's voice was thick with sleep, even as Hermione levitated his food over towards him with the rest of the toast, having grabbed herself a couple of slices and sat down on the end of the bed.
going to a private boarding school. “You’ll need to let me know which options classes you’ll be wanting to take before next week, but there shouldn’t be any problems.”
Draco sat up, remaining perched on Harry’s lap, and held his hands out in front of them. They were shaking terribly, and when he tried to flex his fingers they barely twitched. “Guess n-not. I think you’re going to have to help me today.” Draco gave up and dropped back down to lay on Harry’s strong chest.
Pansy caught his eye and mouthed ‘Calm down’ at him, and he took a deep breath and tucked his other hand into his sleeve to use both to twist the plastic back and forth. He wasn’t sure why muggles made everything out of plastic, but he would admit that the textured bobbles on the surface of the toy felt much nicer than they would have were they made out of metal or glass like most wizarding items.
Harry spent the rest of the week following Ron and Hermione around as to not get lost and watching Draco Malfoy.
Draco woke up more comfortable than he’d ever felt before, laid out on top of possibly the best pillow he’d ever felt in his life. And then the pillow moved, and his eyes shot open. He had his face pressed into Harry’s sternum, and quickly lifted his head.
"The main issues with time turners are that they run the risk of destabilising the timeline of the universe and causing your body to be killed by your past self." Granger's hair was even wilder than usual- they'd been debating for hours now, bouncing magical theory back and forth, and Draco was sure they must both look a fright. He could see that his hands were stained with ink, but he almost didn’t even want to know what sort of a state the rest of him was in.
Harry picked out his paint from the hardware store, a beautiful forest green, and two hand-knitted blankets in the same colour from a nice woman at the market, who Remus and Sirius seemed to know. She had red hair and tutted about how skinny he was, and once they walked away Remus told him her name was Molly Weasley, and that her son would be in his class at Hogwarts. Then came the clothes shopping. Harry had never been into a clothes shop before, but years of masking what he was feeling at the Dursleys’ and St Brutus’ meant at least he wasn’t gawping. Rails and rails of different clothing in every shop- he’d spent the last 6 years rotating the same 3 outfits. He ended up with multiple pairs of tight black jeans, some artfully torn, some not, a bunch of black t-shirts, some plain, some with bands he liked, some with slogans or phrases that made him laugh to himself, a few chunky sweaters in grey, black and green, a pair of black leather combat boots, his own leather biker jacket like Sirius’, contact lenses and a black and grey backpack. He was surprised when on their way back to the car Sirius headed into a little piercing shop.
“Alright, then, I guess.” Harry nodded. “Not sure private school’s right for me, like.” He shrugged nonchalantly as Sirius, Remus and even Officer McKinnon laughed.
“Okay, one minute.” Draco whispered, and before Harry could even fully register what he’d said, Draco was leaning over him, whispering a featherlight charm, wrapping his long, slender arms around him and pulling him up. Harry wanted to burrow his face into Draco’s neck, because the man smelled wonderful and was warm, but he refrained. Draco laid Harry out on his bed and then leaned down and grabbed the plush duvet from the floor, wrapping it around the shorter man. He then went to the tray he’d left on top of the trunk, fetching it over to the bed. He grabbed the anti-nausea and painkilling potions he’d fetched- they wouldn’t cure the migraine but hopefully they’d help enough that Harry would at least open his eyes or eat and drink. “Here, drink this.” He uncorked the anti-nausea potion. It was the slightly stronger sibling of the stomach-soother they’d brewed on Monday. Draco smiled to himself as Harry just took it without question, and uncorked the second vial. “And this one.” He passed it over and then took both empty vials, setting them back on the tray. He then picked up the Evercool compress and put the tray on the floor by the bed, kicking off his shoes and setting onto the bed beside Harry. He pressed the compress to Harry’s forehead and adjusted them until Harry’s head was in his lap so he could rub his scalp.
"That's okay, we can just give the assistant the tag and you can keep it on, okay, Harry?" Hermione addressed him gently. He nodded vehemently. "Okay, come on, we need to go give them these things and then I'll take the tag off and they can keep hold of it for you, so we can go upstairs, okay?" Harry nodded again and raced off towards the front of the shop, Ron and Hermione following him more sedately. Once Ron and Hermione had put their piles onto the honestly immense pile behind the counter, Hermione turned to Harry. "Okay, come here and I'll take the tag off so you can keep wearing it, okay?" He stood next to her while she unhooked the tag and passed it over to the shop assistant before darting off and up the stairs.
Harry grinned and reached out to touch Draco’s arm lightly. “Great. Okay, I’ve got to go, I promised Hagrid I’d go see him, so I’ll see you later.” One more smile and Harry turned and left, his cane clacking on the stone floor.
Asleep, Harry's face looked much younger than usual, and if he didn't know better, Draco would probably guess he was no older than fifteen. The usual tenseness of his face was gone, leaving behind nothing but smooth, soft skin marred only by his scar, which extended from the left upper edge of his forehead down through his eye and over his nose like a lightning strike. As he thought about how much younger Harry looked, he realized that the tenseness that aged him hadn't been present at any point the day before, either, although Harry had seemed more like a child than the adult he was. Harry by no means looked like a child; in spite of his short, skinny stature and large eyes, he had generally looked around 18 since sixth year, but somehow last night all of that had been erased and replaced with some childlike innocence he'd never seen before.
“Fuck me, that’s bollocks! What a prick!” Harry half considered finding out who Draco Malfoy’s father was and going after him, but then shook his head at himself for being crazy- he didn’t even know the boy, so that would just be insane.
Once only his pyjamas were left in his trunk, Draco removed his shoes, socks and trousers and climbed up onto his bed, taking out his mobile phone. He’d finally managed to get the runic sequence right to keep it charged, connected to the internet and functioning around the high levels of magic after a month of testing and almost 20 broken phones.
The sweater came down to his mid-thigh, and it was definitely more expensive than anything he owned. He was confused for a second before he caught a smell of the collar- expensive aftershave, coffee and something citrusy. It was Draco’s. He smiled to himself and ducked his head, feeling his damp hair flop forwards. “I’m dressed!”
Harry groaned. “I want to complain about that, but if it means I can go back to school with Teddy I can’t even be mad about it.”
“Yup. Get down and come on.” Harry saluted him mockingly and stood up, jumping down and landing perfectly. “Still don’t know how you do that, kid.” Leo shook his head.
He'd never been allowed any of the nice things Dudley had when he was growing up, especially not lovely clothes like he saw some of the people on there wearing. He almost gasped when he saw a picture of another boy about his age in a pair of blue dungarees and a blue t-shirt with pink around the collar with a fluffy brown teddy bear hoodie over it. He felt a longing deep inside him- he wanted to be dressed like that. He checked the comments on the picture and saw that there were numerous people asking him where he'd got the outfit, and he had replied to a few, pointing them to a store on the outskirts of London that catered mainly to littles and age players, but that some people who just enjoyed the aesthetic of the clothes they offered, particularly the more everyday pastels, also frequented.
Draco smiled almost indulgently before raising a mocking brow. "I'm 6'2. That is a perfectly normal height. You can only be around 5'."
“Bullshit. What’s wrong? Did I say something wrong?” He stopped in the hall, pulling me into an alcove.
Draco turned to him, surprised. "Why… are you sitting here?" Draco winced, clearly realising how rude that came out, and Harry couldn't stifle a giggle.
"Mm. I had noticed…. Your issues with food." Draco said a little awkwardly. "If you ever… need someone to talk to about it, I'm sure you'd feel more comfortable going to Weasley or Granger, of course.. but if you like, you can talk to me too."
“Yeah. Right, I’ll just upload this to my laptop then we can post it, yeah? Do you wanna smoke while it uploads?” Harry knew he was blushing but hoped his darker skin would cover it. It didn’t.
" A small stag, much smaller than Harry's patronus, and with less points to his antlers, formed out of the end of his wand. "For Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry is with me, he's perfectly safe, I'm going to take him back to his room now."
“What the fuck me? What the fuck you! Draco Lucius Malfoy, I’d better never hear you say anyone is too good for you again!” she reprimanded him.
Harry let out a mirthless bark of laughter. “They hate magic, and therefore me, they’re racist as all hell, and therefore despised me, plus I think they figured out I was queer just after third year, so that made them hate me even more.”
“N-no, no, I’m alright. I just…. Let’s go to a different shop?” Harry’s hands had finally stopped shaking.
"N-no. Won and 'Mione have been looking afta me, but they not my caregivers." His voice was even younger than it usually was when he was in headspace, his vulnerability evident.
“That’s really cool. You have a really nice voice as well.” Harry bit his lip. He could honestly just sit and complement Draco all day, and if he didn’t stop soon he was sure he was going to end up making a prat of himself.
"Most likely." Draco shrugged. "I wonder what they'll all say when they find out we're getting married." He mused, twisting the ring on his left hand with a slight smile. "Do you have work today?"
First and second period was Chemistry with Professor Snape. Snape was a hard-faced man dressed in all black, including a black lab coat that Harry was convinced he must have had custom made, with greasy black hair that was longer than Harry’s or even Sirius’. He was rude and snarky and took an immediate dislike of Harry.
“Draco, do you have tattoos?” Harry blurted before he even thought, and when he realised his mistake, he felt his cheeks heat and mentally thanked his father for passing on his dark skin which made it unnoticeable. He half-hoped Draco wouldn’t notice, but when the blond’s head snapped up, he knew he’d had no such luck. The blond’s molten silver eyes bored into his and his breath caught in his throat. Draco the most beautiful person he’d ever seen.
“Potter, this will be your bed. You can do whatever you wish to it, and the lockable drawer is for any personal items you may want to keep safe. Now, before I leave you, do you have any sensible requests for next week?”
Draco seemed to have changed a lot since the war, but most of the changes were more outward- Harry had figured out years ago that most of Draco's behaviour had been to please his father or keep his family safe instead of simply because he wanted to, and now that he was free to be who he actually was, he certainly seemed a lot happier, at least to Harry, and they were getting along better than ever- a few times they even went flying together. They weren't allowed on their house teams, seeing as the eighth years were considered essentially a house of their own, but they still had lots of fun flying around and playing seekers games. Sometimes Harry caught Draco staring at him after their games in a way that made him flush all the way down to his toes, but he tried not to think about it as to not get his hopes up about something that was unlikely to ever happen.
Draco didn’t think he’d ever been stared at this much in his life. He really should have expected it, but he’d been so wrapped up in the thrill of finally being able to look the way he wanted to that it hadn’t occurred to him that turning up to school in his Black Sheep t-shirt, green and black plaid jeans with chains, his green doc martens that Ted had assured him he could keep, and with sky-blue hair and an eyebrow piercing might garner him some attention.
"Yes. I- I'm a bit nervous about it. But not too bad, because Ron and Hermione will be there, but also…. You remember when I told you about Draco?" She nodded- it had barely been 2 sessions before he'd broken down and admitted his feelings for his school rival to her. "Well, he'll be there too, and I'm just- I'm nervous about all of that."
“Okay, if that is all?” She turned away in clear dismissal. I moved back towards the door, half-pulling Draco by the hand.
He found an empty compartment near the end, one of the ones most students avoided because they were freezing cold, and placed his shrunken trunk on the luggage rack before flopping onto one of the benches. He laid down on his back with his eyes closed until someone slid open the door.
As soon as they were out of the car park, Vernon chuckled gleefully to himself. “Finally going to be rid of you, boy! Just another two hours and then we’ll never have to see your freakish paki face again!” Harry sort of wished he could be upset by Vernon’s words, but all he could think was ‘Two more hours and I’ll never have to see them again!’
Hermione smiled to herself while Ron gaped. “Ferret-face is gorgeous? Mate, you’ve got to work on your taste!”
Once Draco’s bowl was empty, he leaned back in his chair and steeled himself. Taking a deep breath, he decided to just go for it.
As soon as they got outside, Harry couldn’t pretend to be alright anymore- he dropped back against the wall and felt his breathing shallow and quicken as his eyes started to water. His chest ached and it took all he had to not fall to the ground and pull his knees up the way he would as a child in his cupboard.
“Yeah, probably. I know you weren’t really listening to most of the room assignments, but her and Pansy are in 2B downstairs.”
The pleasantness was broken, however, when in his last period on Friday their defence professor, professor Everglade, announced that they would be learning legillimency. According to him, knowing legillimency would make learning occlumency far easier, and that was something they needed to know for their NEWTs. Immediately the idea of having to learn occlumency again terrified Harry, but when Everglade announced that they would be learning legillimency through casting it on their partners, as there was no way for a miscast legillimens to be harmful, it would simply not work, Harry felt his hands start to shake.
“Alright, do you want some toast? We’ll have to go food shopping later, all we’ve got in ins bread and butter right now, but we need to take you to get some clothes and things anyway.”
“Draco. Draco Malfoy.” He introduced himself, and god- Harry almost wanted to laugh at the ridiculous name, but somehow it suited him perfectly. He just nodded, handing the lighter back over and looking up to the sun rising over the forest.
“Potter, you will address me as Head Yaxley or Sir, only. You will be rooming with 5 other boys, and any violent behaviour will be punished severely. Many of the boys in here form gangs; this is not against the rules but is not recommended either. You will be released on your eighteenth birthday, by which point you ought to have completed your GCSEs, and your criminal record will be stricken off, as you are here and not in police custody. You are free to miss as many meals as you please, although failure to attend classes will result in punishment. Cigarettes are available, up to one carton per week, regardless of age, but any drugs or alcohol will be confiscated and result in a punishment. You will have a weekly list of chores and tasks to complete, it us up to you whether you do them all in one day or spread them out. Weekends are your own to do as you please within the center. You
It was 9:45 on a Wednesday evening and he was headed down to the smoking spot for his last fag of the night, when he came across Draco Malfoy in one of the alcoves. The taller boy was curled in on himself and visibly having a panic attack, his shoulders shaking and tears running down his delicate cheeks. As soon as he saw him, Harry stopped and dropped to his knees in front of him.
The next morning he woke at 5:30, as he had every morning since the age of 4, and quickly showered and dressed before going to poke around the kitchen. He hoped there was coffee of some kind. He wasn’t particularly surprised to find one of those fancy pod coffee machines on the worktop and a basket full of different pods beside it. He found the biggest mug he could and used a couple of the cappuccino pods. He slipped on his busted trainers and headed out of the front door, lighting up a cigarette with his free hand and leaning against the wall. He took the first sip of his coffee and spoke out loud to himself, “Oh, that’s a lot better than the coffee at St Brutus’.”
Back at the burrow, Hermione quickly used her wand to change Harry's bedding into the soft teddy bear print one he'd picked out in the store and used a switching spell to change him into his bear onesie, before tucking him into bed, his teddy bear clutched tight against him, a pacifier in his mouth and blankets surrounding him like a soft nest.
"What's a caregiver?" Ron wished Hermione would remember not to just throw out terms she'd read about and assume everyone else had read the same books she had. He loved her, but it was one thing that was less endearing to him and more annoying.
Harry shook his head violently. "Wan you." He wrapped both his arms around Draco's neck as tight as he could.
“Really? Do you think McGonagall would be alright with that? Me having a baby in the school, I mean?”
They both stirred into awareness at around the same time, Harry smiling sleepily down at Draco, who’s face was pressed right into his collarbone, but his entire body was wracked with tremors.
“Jesus fuck! You scared the shit out of me!” Harry whipped around, pulling his fag out from between his lips.
“The police station. They might have another guardian for you on file, and if not, they will at least be able to do something about your relatives.”
The grey light slowly shifted to a vibrant purple. “Yes, Mr Potter, it seems you are autistic. I can recommend some techniques for dealing with any issues that you may have relating to this, although you may be better speaking with Mr Malfoy, here.” She looked over at Draco and he nodded.
“Yep, absolutely. You should be honoured to be a member of such a cool and exclusive club. So far as I know, there’s only me, you, Luna, and Astoria Greengrass in this school.”
“I’m Remus Lupin. I’m your godfather’s husband. He’s just signing the paperwork for us to get full custody and adopt you with Kingsley.” The man, Remus, was soft spoken and kind, with a welsh accent and light brown hair.
“Mr Potter? I’m sorry to bother you at such a… delicate time, but I’m afraid a Mrs Andromeda Tonks has been killed, and after her child’s death you are her next of kin.”
It was after curfew, but Harry couldn’t sleep and he knew that sometimes just being outside was nice at night. At the Dursleys’ he used to sometimes sneak out and lay in the yard in the dark, so he decided that he was going to sneak down to the football field and hang around out there, breathing in the fresh night air.
Harry clenched his hands into fists as he turned to glare at the ugly 19-year-old. “What do you want, Flint?” He spat.
“What?” Draco rested his head on his knees and looked at me, and I noticed that he seemed to be focusing on my hair instead of my eyes like Ron and Hermione always tried to do- I was glad, that always made me feel squirmy and uncomfortable.
“Uh, hi?” Harry shot a panicked look at Remus and tried to adjust the way he was being hugged so that the man wouldn’t touch his chest.
Harry was stood in front of the mirror in Myrtle’s bathroom, staring almost unseeingly at his reflection. There was blood all over him, his clothes soaked through and his face painted with messy splatters. He could barely recognise himself; the crazed glint in his eyes, the very same colour as an
“I told you we had to go.” He whispered. “Draco, this is my Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon.” Draco’s confused face turned to horror.
“HIS name is Harry, and he is perfectly well behaved when he isn’t being harassed!” Harry felt his eyes start to water at the way he was being supported for the first time ever.
“That’s fine, sweetheart.” Draco flushed brilliantly at the pet name. “You know, I think last night is the first time since the war I’ve not had a nightmare.”
Harry grinned crookedly. "Maybe I'll give it a go, at least bears don't have to deal with reporters."
"Harry?" He kept his voice soft in case the other boy was not actually awake yet. He seemingly needn't have worried as Harry practically threw himself back, away from Draco. "Are you alright?"
"What are you sorry for?" Draco thought Harry was probably apologising for something to do with the evening before, but he also wasn't too sure what he had to apologise for.
“Mm. I only learned over summer, but I’ve always been good with instruments.” Draco’s cheeks burned brighter.
"Uh, can you explain it please?" Harry always found he absorbed information better when things were explained to him out loud.
“You’re in love with me?” Harry felt dizzy and giddy- he almost wanted to laugh, but he knew Draco would take that the wrong way.
“Bet I can make me’sen worth ya time.” The boy had an arrogant grin. He was handsome, Harry would give him that. Tall and thin, with golden skin and dirty-blond hair.
Just then, though, Hermione opened the door and walked in, three trays of bacon, eggs and tea and a stack of toast trailing behind her.
“I know a lot of things. What I don’t know is how on earth you can stomach tea with that much sugar, but to each their own, I suppose.”
"I- everything. I'm in love with you." Draco's eyes widened with shock and he decended back down, kissing Harry deeply again.
“You were ACTIVELY TRYING TO GO BACK IN TIME?!” Draco shrunk under Granger’s glare. “We are UNSPEAKABLES, our job isn’t to mess with the timeline, its to research and experiment, but not do such
“Stimming is, like, doing repetitive things that can, like, calm you down, or show that you’re happy, or whatever. I’m really not the best at describing this stuff.”
Yaxley looked down at Harry’s shoes, taking note of the odd shape and copious amounts of duct tape holding them together. “I will see about getting you a pair of standard-issue boots today, as I see the urgent need for replacements. This will not be standard practice, and any other time they would be included in your next week’s pack, understood?”
“Can you not talk?” Harry’s tone was soft. Draco shook his head, dropping his hands to his sides and twisting them back and forth and subtly as he could. “Were you hexed?” Another head shake. “Do you know sign language?” Draco’s head perked up, and he made brief eye-contact with Harry before shuddering and moving his eyes to focus on Harry’s thick, curly hair instead. He nodded. “Oh, okay, great! So do I. So, are you alright?” Draco just shrugged again. He never quite knew how to answer that. “What’s wrong?” Harry dropped down about a foot in front of Draco, sitting cross-legged on the cold stone floor.
"Right. So, I'm guessing we're gonna be looking after him, then?" Ron didn't really mind- he'd do just about anything for Harry, just like he knew Harry would for him.
"Well… no. It feels… nice. But then afterwards I just can't help but think about how much of a freak I am! Maybe the Dursley's were right about me!" Harry's eyes were filled with tears.
"Oh, honestly." Hermione shook her head, exasperated. "It seems he wants you to be his caregiver, Draco. Is that something that is okay with you?"
"Yes. I'm not sure why, but if he wants to, I'm not going to stop him." Draco's voice was a bit defensive.
“WE both know that’s Lucius’ fault. If he’d taught you how to process emotions instead of just how to be a bastard to everyone, maybe you’d actually be able to flirt instead of just insulting him.” She petted his hair gently.
“What, that you’re gay?” Draco nodded. “Of course not. Be a bit hypocritical of me if I did, wouldn’t it?”
“Just checking up on my baby cousin’s first day as a disowned man!” Draco groaned and dropped his head to the table.
"O-okay." Harry's voice was small and childlike as he made his way over to the case of dummies. He picked out a big box of different coloured plain ones and dropped his head, putting them on top of the pile of shoes and grabbing a couple of different sippy cups.
“I know, I want to. If you don’t, though, that’s fine.” It wasn’t, of course, but he’d pretend it was.
"You alright, love?" Harry's face looked as stony as ever, but Draco could see the warm affection in his hard green eyes.
. “’S just… too much.” Draco nodded as if this made perfect sense, which wasn’t a reaction anything like Hermione or Ron’s when I’d said a similar thing to them. His silvery eyes flicked up to my hands and he grabbed his bag, unzipping it and taking out what looked like muggle headphones, much to my confusion, and he tapped his wand to them briefly before holding them out to me.
“You- I-” Draco gave up on trying to verbalise his feelings and just leaned in, kissing Harry deeply. Harry seemed surprised at first but then kissed back passionately, taking control of the kiss and pulling Draco until he was straddling his waist. When they pulled back for air, Draco dropped his forehead onto Harry’s. “I’m in love with you too. Since at least second year, although I’ve liked you since Madam Malkins.”
Harry’s answering grin was dazzling and he leaned back in, connecting their mouths with a kiss no less earth-shattering than the last.
"Ah, well that's good of you then-" just then Harry ran over and passed Ron a huge pile of clothes, all in pastel colours. He looked down at them bemusedly.
Remus smiled and turned back down the stairs, presumably heading back down towards the car. Ron stepped back to allow Harry access, and Harry’s eyes immediately fell onto the bare bed on the left side of the room. It was just as big as his bed at home and had heavy drapes around it that could be pulled closed for privacy. Ron’s side of the room was messy, with football posters haphazardly hung all over the walls and dirty laundry. Harry dropped his bag of clothes and flopped back onto the bed, groaning.
Wednesday passed fairly quickly because of how excited/nervous Draco was about recording his song. He’d never really recorded any before, and he wasn’t sure how it would turn out, but at the same time the idea was thrilling, and even more thrilling was the idea of having everyone he knew send it to his father. He laughed every time he pictured his father’s face.
Harry swallowed. “Bad habit. Sugary tea was more or less all I could get away with taking when I was a kid.”
"Yes pwease, daddy." Harry didn't even seem to notice what he said, but Draco felt his heart stop for a moment. He pressed a soft kiss to Harry's thick curls.
“Right, Lupin, follow me.” Professor McGonagall led him back out of the office and up to a literal tower, which made him seriously wish Remus and Sirius had told him Hogwarts was in a castle, because now he was gawking at everything like an idiot. “This is Gryffindor Tower. Boys’ dormitories are on the left and girls are on the right. Your dorm is room 6C and you will be sharing, as Headmaster Dumbledore said, with Ron Weasley. Your father should still be there, as I know he was planning on putting your things away for you.”
In the car, Remus sat in the driver’s seat, but instead of sitting in the passenger seat as Harry had expected, Sirius sat in the back with him, encouraging Harry to lay down and use his lap as a pillow. Between the simple comfort of the contact and the gentle, rhythmic feeling of Sirius’ angular hands threading through his long curls over and over, it didn’t take long for him to fall fast asleep.
Harry felt stunned, and just nodded, making his way in a shocked haze out towards the front gate. Once he was off of the grounds he just slumped against the wall. He couldn’t say he was upset about no longer having to live with the Dursleys, but he had no idea where he was going to go. It wasn’t as if he had any friends or family he could stay with.
“I will!” Ron called through the door, and Harry could hear Remus’ warm chuckle as he walked down the hallway. “McGonagall told me you’d have the same timetable as me, mate, so if you want to stick with me I’ll make sure you don’t get lost- I used to get lost all the bloody time in 1
Harry turned to Mx Greenfeld. “I’m so sorry! You shouldn’t have done that, now you’ve lost your job because of me!”
Shacklebolt sat down across from Harry. “Harry, I went to school with Sirius and Remus. They’re good men, and given what you’ve been through it’s a damn shame you weren’t put with them to begin with when your parents were murdered.”
“You don’t need to be sorry.” Harry vaguely wondered if this was how Luna felt all the time- maybe he had an infestation of Nargles or something. “Just- why did you kiss me?”
"No! Just…. That guy looks a lot like Draco…." Harry's brows furrowed as he frowned, staring at the tall blond paying at the counter of the shop through the door.
“Hi, Luna Lovegood. Please get out of my face.” Harry tried to be polite but he realized it came out ruder than intended. Luckily, she didn’t seem to take offence, just sat back down and smiled serenely at him.
“Ron!” She walked over to his bed, not even noticing Harry, and pressed a quick kiss to his lips before continuing to talk quickly. “How are you? My parents just dropped me off, I-” she finally seemed to catch sight of Harry and he waved awkwardly. “Hello, my name is Hermione Granger, what’s yours?”
Harry rubs his eyes and releases a long sigh, brimming with feeling. Biting his lower lip, he rests his palm on the armrest, on the warmth of Malfoy's leftover heat.
Malfoy shakes himself out of his stupor. He sinks down to his knees in front of Harry and begins to unbuckle his belt, undoing his jeans, taking his time to slide them off as if he's unwrapping a Christmas present. Harry's left wearing only a pair of black briefs and a big grin when Malfoy's eyes widen and his lips fall apart, having come face-to-face with the bulge in Harry's briefs. Long fingers trace their way up Harry's inner thigh, tip-toe across Harry's jutting hips before pressing down on his abdomen.
published a photo of Oliver and him at the pub when they met up for drinks and for the mag. Unfortunately, it was a photo with connotations — Oliver’s hand was on Harry’s thigh and climbing upwards, his slow smile and the sparkle of intent in his eyes leaving zero doubt about his intentions.
to leaf through at his own leisure would advance his research in the field of healing potions by leaps and bounds. Stunned by the thoughtfulness of the gift, he lifts up the tome with both hands, grunting, and hugs it to his chest. He’s been hunting high and low for it: it’s near to impossible to get copies of the text unless you have official access to the library in St. Mungo’s, and even so, the loan of the book is heavily regulated. Draco’s visited many vintage bookstores, both local and overseas, but he had been unable to find a copy.
Potter looks rather taken aback. He holds Draco's gaze for a moment, before ducking his head. He runs a fingertip along the rim of his mug and mumbles, "I'm sorry too. I shouldn't have said all of that, especially about the Manor."
Steely determination surging in him, Draco bins the flowers, ignoring the sadness whistling around his heart. However, before the flowers land in the bin, they fly up into the air, and Draco rears back when they float in front of his face.
After admiring Draco for a while longer, Harry rolls over and carefully eases himself out of bed. He's halfway into gathering his things when Draco grunts. "Harry," he murmurs, sitting up and pressing the heel of his palm on his closed eyes briefly, before looking up. "Good morning."
Harry’s hands squeeze Malfoy’s arse as he sucks, the weight of Malfoy’s heavy cock gliding along his tongue, hitting the back of his throat. The air is filled with slurping sounds and strangled moans, and soon, Harry’s neck and jaw starts to ache, but he doesn’t stop, too eager to give Malfoy the first sixty-nine of his life.
“He visits the seventh floor war memorial when he cannot sleep, but I’m certain you already know that,” Dumbledore pipes up, a familiar twinkle in his eye. “The castle is large, yes, but I suspect you’d find it small enough to… run into him more frequently this term.”
The snake rouses itself from its basket and slithers towards Draco. It hisses something back to Potter, who rolls his eyes and flaps his hand in Draco's direction. It hoists its long sinuous body up to the sofa, sandwiching itself between both men. To Draco's amusement, it climbs up to his lap and swirls all over his thighs, letting out a dangerous hiss and showing a flash of long fang.
All of Draco’s things have vanished — leaving only white cloths draped over furniture and drawn blinds.
"You'd enjoy it too, won't you?" Potter says in a conversational tone and twists his wrist when he reaches the head of Draco's cock, triggering a hiss of pleasure from Draco. "Having every inch of you buried in me so deep, filling me up good with that thick, fat cock. I'll be so tight, so hot around you. And then we'll be fucking so hard, so fast..." Potter releases Draco's cock and trails his hand up and down Draco's abdomen. "
"How do you want it?" Malfoy asks in a conversational tone as he coats his fingers. Harry spreads his legs and rubs the inside of his ankle up and down Malfoy's outer thigh.
Draco’s breath catches in his throat when something in Harry’s face softens. “You’re not like him. You’re nothing like your father.”
Harry casually scopes the clientele that Serpentes attracts. He's astonished when he recognises some of them — a handful of politicians that are
"Yeah," Malfoy says on an exhale. He smooths Harry's hair back fondly, a soft smile curving his lips. He trails his hands down Harry's neck, squeezing his biceps and rubbing his chest. Malfoy's scorching touch leaves heated trails all over Harry's body, and his cock hardens even more inside him. Malfoy pulls him closer and circles his hips, and Harry takes that as permission to move. He pulls out halfway before pushing back in, eliciting a harsh gasp from Malfoy.
Harry releases the breath that was bottled in his chest. His stomach flutters with what he thinks is hope, and pent-up energy rattles within him. He takes another gulp of his Firewhisky, relishing the alcohol coursing in his blood. “So… we could work out? For real?”
"Don't be silly," Hermione replies, tutting. She looks to the side, and Harry follows her gaze to a fresh bouquet of red roses near the kitchen window.
Draco had never thought that he’d be twenty years old and running around in the rain and jumping in puddles like a kid. It's strange how he doesn't feel chilly; maybe because Harry's touch is so warm. Draco squeezes his hand, and Harry smiles back at him and returns the squeeze.
"Yeah, but this is for another batch. Sometimes I fry the meat first, or it goes straight into the oven as is. Owls are birds of prey, so I have to add meat to make them appetising enough, although owl treats should never be a substitute for proper meat in their diet," Harry says as he fiddles around with the oven. "The type of protein included also depends on the species of owl. Scops owls like Pig prefer insects, while eagle owls like Humps—"
. Once again, Harry detects that whiff of cherries and vanilla that remind him of designer lips and breathless kisses. Upon seeing Harry, Malfoy blinks in mild surprise.
"Mmmm," Potter hums, the vibrations of his voice turning Draco on even more. He moves a hand from Draco's inner thigh up to his hip, then to his stomach and down. He repeats this motion, each caress sending molten sparks of pleasure on Draco's heated skin.
He's about to cast a water-repelling charm when an umbrella flares open right on top of him. Harry squints up through glasses smeared with rain.
“Sorry, too hot, couldn’t take it anymore. Come for me, c’mon…” Harry mutters, pulling out and nudging Malfoy’s hand away. He wanks Malfoy, hard and fast until Malfoy becomes an incoherent mess, his back arching off the bed and his heels digging into the mattress. Harry nuzzles his cheek and hisses into his ear, and finally, Malfoy tenses, the tendons on his neck standing and his abdominal muscles clenching. He’s close, so close—
Draco releases a pent-up moan when Harry's voice crackles through the tape recorder. He places the recorder on the pillow near his head and moves his hands down his body.
Malfoy turns his head to the side, and the snake's tongue flicks towards his Azkaban tattoo once before continuing its descent, but now down to Malfoy's left arm, coiling around it exactly just like how the snake in the Dark Mark displays itself. Dropping his left hand on the stage, Malfoy turns — presenting his side view — and sinks to all fours, head thrown back, back arched and that sweet, sweet arse in the air. Harry's filthy mind instantly fills in the blanks; Harry's on his knees behind Malfoy, grabbing his hips while he pounds into Malfoy hard. What does Malfoy sound like when he’s being fucked like this? Is he a screamer? God, Harry hopes he is — because he wants so badly to make Malfoy scream his name all night long.
"Yes, the Malfoys were important donors, but after the War, we don't need the bad publicity," Cheryl replied as an after-thought, her attention already fixed on another donor.
The thought of leaving London, leaving Potter after they've reconnected, is entirely unbearable. There will be time later tonight when Draco will lie in bed alone and gaze longingly at Potter's tattoo, but for now, he desperately needs his touch again.
"Now!" Charlie yells. The teachers on the ground obey; aiming an explosive shower of red Stunning spells at the dragon’s chest. Its body slams onto the ground, but it's not giving up without a fight — it lifts its tail weakly and twists it, hitting Potter who is floating in mid-air and levitating his snake to a safe height near Minerva—
A sharp rap on his door interrupts his imagination, and Harry quickly gets his prick to behave, before tucking himself away and straightening his clothes.
"Fifteen minutes then, both of you," Frank — the show coordinator — barks after consulting his clipboard.
“Hold it there,” Harry instructs. “Feel the stretch.” He walks around, pausing at times to correct some of their forms. He stops behind Malfoy, looks up…
He must've hit the window or something, because Malfoy opens his eyes fully and yelps when he sees Harry staring at him.
He thanks Ayumi when she places his coffee in front of him. He takes a sip, wraps his hands around the mug, closes his eyes and sighs. After a moment, he hugs a cushion to his chest and leans back, his shoulders slumping as the tension of the week-long field work ebbs away in this calming ambience and good coffee. It was exhausting, both physically and mentally, working with and teaching the Japanese Aurors, with their different work ethic and ways of thinking.
Harry feels Bacon's sinuous body clench briefly around his arm, shoulder and upper back before he slides away, almost collapsing on the ground.
“Take Leo, for example. He’s scared of heights, and a few Muggle-born students aren’t keen on flying,” Potter continues. “Of course, I encourage them to try it out, but I don’t see any point in forcing them, in making them feel inferior if their friends are rocketing around on a broom.” His voice drops, and he looks away. “No child should feel inferior, to feel like they don’t belong.”
"We never forget those we love, even if they are no longer with us. They're still near us, every single day. Your pain, your scars that you thought were healed over… but with every memory, they open again. These scars tell you you've been hurt, but yet you continue to love, to survive."
"No! I'm not some... helpless maiden!" He blurts out, glaring at Malfoy. His glare seems to disconcert Malfoy, who pulls on his own sneer like a safety blanket. Harry relaxes — this is comforting, familiar territory, not things like Malfoy sending him home and looking deep in his eyes and rubbish like that.
With lust thundering through his system and his nerve endings singing with every touch, Draco lets him.
“No!” Potter growls. “It’s you. Don’t you fucking get it, Malfoy?” He draws up to his full height and advances towards Draco, bath water cascading down his chest. Draco flattens himself against the side of the tub. “I was missing something important, not having you to push against, not seeing your face every morning in the pantry, duelling with people that didn’t present half the challenge you did.” He scrubs his face with his palms, sighing. “It’s you. It’s always been you.” These last few words emerge so quietly, as if they were meant for Potter himself.
Harry murmurs Draco's name and lets out an affectionate sigh. He laces their fingers together and guides them to a nearby bench.
Finally — the whisper of a keycard against the lock, the twist of the doorknob, and the slow swing of the door.
Grey eyes flicker to the side, and Harry sags with relief when Draco's cheeks dimple into a shy smile. "Good morning."
For dinner that night, they ignored the snaking queues at Juliana's and Grimaldi's Pizza in favour of Shake Shack, where Harry fell in love with the Shackburger. Dessert was a quick visit to the Brooklyn Ice-Cream Factory, and they're ending the evening with a sunset view at the Brooklyn Bridge Lookout, a ground-level viewpoint. Harry’s eyes sparkle at the colourful twinkling lights adorning the sides of the bridge, almost glittering as brightly as the gleaming lights of the skyscrapers and buildings at the Financial District of southern Manhattan, across the East River. He waits for a ferry to pass before snapping a photo.
“Of course not!” Malfoy bursts out, and then deflates, shoulders curving inwards. He rests his elbows on his knees and buries his face in his hands. "I was going to marry respectably and settle down. I’m supposed to be on my honeymoon with Astoria. And then you ruined it all!"
But Harry can't stop. Now that everything is out, he can't take it back. "Come home with me. Please, Draco. Of all the places in New York, I just had to stay beside you. It has to mean something! Come home to people that love you, care for you. We'll get you some help, someone you can talk to.” A wisp of cautious hope lifts in Harry’s chest. "It's really not that bad, talking to someone professional. I've done something similar before, and I'll be with you, every step of the way, like how Ron and Hermione were there for me." He holds his breath and his gaze with Draco.
He places his palms on Potter's shoulders, dipping his head to force Potter to meet his gaze. "Harry," he whispers, using his first name because this is so very important
"Your desserts remind me of home," Malfoy says as he fiddles with the edges of a menu, both of them resolutely not looking at each other. "Of my childhood. Of bright blue skies and summer sunshine, of afternoon tea-times in the Manor pavilions with my father and of entire days spent baking with my mother," he whispers, smiling sadly.
They pass by the Great Hall, and Draco stops in front of the closed doors of the Hall. He looks around. The corridors are deserted, and they didn’t run into anyone; it’s way after curfew. Does he dare? He’s had so many fantasies about shagging in the Great Hall.
He makes it two minutes early, panting and hunching over with his hands pressed on his knees. It takes a moment, and he’s at New York’s Portkey Central. After recovering from the trans-atlantic travel, he Apparates straight to Draco’s door, not caring about what to say. He’s sure it’ll work out eventually.
He knows he should look away, but he can't, especially when Andrew Smith, a sixth-year Ravenclaw struts over to Malfoy and engages him in conversation. Harry's fist tightens around his fork when Malfoy flashes Smith a flirtatious smile and touches his elbow. A stab of jealousy, so fierce and sudden that it takes Harry by surprise, flares in his chest, and he glares at Smith.
When Draco slips in a fourth finger, tucking it beneath his three fingers, Potter clenches down. Draco pauses his right hand at once, although his left hand is still working Potter's cock. A crease of worry appears between Draco's brows; if Potter can't handle his fingers, how is he going to take his cock?
It was an invitation and a kiss two years too late, and Draco wonders why it had taken so long for them to be together like this.
Harry frowns. “Yeah, for me,” he retorts. He’s had enough of Malfoy sacrificing his own happiness to live up to the stiflingly high expectations of the Malfoy heritage. “Me, this Half-blood who will never be good enough for you? Bloody ironic, isn't it, when everyone else would be glad to have me join their family. Me, this bloke who killed Voldemort? Who can’t bear you grandchildren? Or is it all three?" He juts out his chin in combat, eyes flashing. “Maybe you should think about your son’s happiness instead of focusing on your outdated pureblood traditions!” he shouts, lip curling with derision at the last word.
Draco nods back. Although they're not close friends, Granger has been more accepting of their relationship than Weasley, but at least all three of them are on civil terms. He slants a glance towards Potter, who's staring ahead at the display of the Giant Squid's tentacles with amusement.
Those exact words, said in that same breathy manner, transports Harry back in time to a Hogwarts classroom on that fateful night. Before he knows it, he's speaking, conjuring his words from the depths of his memory. "It's when I'm fucking you so hard and good that you forget your name."
It took time for Draco to overcome his Muggle prejudices and become comfortable with such technology, but it was practically required, especially in the fast-paced, competitive world of journalism where a few minutes of tardiness would mean losing a potential scoop to a rival paper.
"And I wasn't?" Draco murmurs, more to himself. They glance at the faded Dark Mark on Draco's left arm for a second before Draco turns his arm over, hiding the Mark. His bravado deflating, Draco takes a step away
Malfoy's smile dims. "I'll talk to them. Mother wants me to be happy, and her feelings towards you aren't as antagonistic as Father's." His shoulders slump. "He'll need a lot more convincing, but I'll talk to them." He gestures to Harry's bag. "What about you? Are you ready to come home?"
Their friendship was still a work in progress, but they had come a long way from their original antagonising relationship. A determined Malfoy had approached George multiple times when he had been advertising for help in the shop, and George had rejected him every single time.
George bites on a knuckle to stop his howl of laughter when Harry, unable to stop himself — ever the oblivious, impulsive bloke, bless him — inflicts another squeeze on Malfoy's bum.
He pokes his head over the divider separating their tables. "Hey," he greets Theo, who is in the midst of folding his Flourish and Blotts bag. He grins at the sight of his partner’s new book, something about charms and defensive magic — Theo has just returned from the bookstore, which usually lifts his mood. He wheels over to Theo's cubicle.
"Blow me," Malfoy demands, pulling away. He flops onto his back and opens his legs. "Suck my cock." Harry accedes to the request at once, slotting between his thighs and sinking down to his elbows.
Wild grey eyes stumble onto Harry, who's hovering nearby and finishing off a chocolate eclair. Relief surges through Draco. He glances at the clock on the bedside dresser — it's twelve-thirty in the afternoon — before looking at Harry again, just in time to see green eyes drop down to Draco's crotch and flitter away in embarrassment.
. Their bodies are cloaked in a mist of lust; Potter thrusting hard and fast in Draco's mouth while Draco glides his hands over Potter's skin, squeezing every available area of flesh, finally resting on his arse. When Draco pushes a finger in—
Harry puts the picture away and extracts a container of Polyjuice pills from the bag. Unlike the liquid Polyjuice that Harry had first been accustomed to in his teens, the Ministry had developed a more sophisticated form to be used exclusively by its Aurors — pills that lasted for different time durations, ranging from half an hour to twelve hours.
“Yet here we are,” Draco says. Rain is steadily soaking through his clothes, sticking them to his skin, just like how Potter’s stuck on him-
Malfoy lies back on the pillows and drags Harry down on top of him, sweeping him up into another one of those intense, toe-curling kisses. Harry makes quick work of Malfoy's clothes, tossing them into a careless heap on the floor. He glances at the nightstand, blinking at the assortment of items—a box of tissue, a bottle of water, a tube of lube and a clean towel. "I'm not the only one hoping for a shag tonight," he says.
The only things on the table (besides the tart) are a thick book and the usual condiments. Hang on, the book looks familiar… He leans forward and squints at the spine.
“No, I swear! It opened, like usual. I had no idea—“ Potter splutters. “I’m sorry, I’ll come back later.” He turns and rattles the doorknob.
Harry blinks. "What? You've seen them before?" He tugs on Draco's hand to get his full attention, because this is so very important. "You didn’t come. Unless you saw photographs in the news or..."
There's someone pushing through the crowd. His mind reeling, Harry looks at the tight knot of Malfoys, and then at the people and the fancy setting. Panic sets in when his thoughts morph into something darker, lifting the lid on memories that he dealt with a long time ago. The Snatchers brought him here, Bellatrix tortured Hermione, Dobby died—
“You’re cute, too.” Harry smiled gently and Draco somehow blushed even harder and dipped his head, avoiding Harry’s eyes. Harry used his thumb to tilt Draco’s head back up slightly, his eyes trained on the blond’s perfect lips. “Can I kiss you?”
Harry woke up sobbing. He'd dreamed he was back in his cupboard, alone and unloved, and that his friends were all one incredibly unfair dream, gifted to him and then wrenched away for him to remain locked under the stairs, starving and alone.
“Yeah. By the time I was 4 I cooked basically all their meals. I wasn’t usually allowed to eat any though.” Harry hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione this much before, but something about Draco made him just want to tell him everything.
They kissed for what could have been hours or minutes before breaking apart, out of breath and both blushing hard.
The next morning, Harry woke at 06:45, just as he did every other day. He then showered and dressed in clean clothes and his boots. He slipped his new phone into one of the pockets, his knife into another and his cigarettes and lighter into the one by his knee. Grabbing his jacket, made of heavy black canvas, he headed down to the common room. There was only one other person in there, a short black girl with large front teeth and a big book in her lap. As she heard him walk in she looked up, startled.
“She’s just gone for a fag, she’ll probably be back in 5.” She pulled out a consent form and slid it across the counter to him.
“Right, yeah, Grimmauld definitely isn’t even nearly ready for that. I reckon I’ll move into Andromeda’s.”
“Hey. So you’re small. So what?” Draco is careful to modulate his tone so Potter won’t think he’s taking the piss. “We’ve got fantastic chemistry, you’re fucking fit, and a great kisser. I want you too much to let something like that mess us up.” He gives Potter what he hopes is a reassuring smile, and he sags in relief when Potter grins back. He takes Draco’s hand and kisses each fingertip, before dropping a kiss on the inside of his wrist.
"Wanna see the duck, Rose?" Harry settles her on his lap, slides his left arm around her middle and points to the duck with his right hand. "There it is, going to meet his friends," he adds, his finger following the duck, which is flapping its wings and hurrying towards a flock of ducks.
They pop into the nearest Chick-fil-A, and Malfoy watches, highly amused, as Harry slathers the special sauce all over his grilled chicken burger and munches happily on his food.
“Are you alright?” George had asked, jumping to his feet and leaping over the large, smoking hole to cross the threshold to Malfoy’s lab.
A grinning George crouches on the winding staircase of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, concealing himself behind the banister. He glances down at Harry, who is lurking behind a shelf on the first storey of the shop, before lighting the miniature version of a Whizz Popper and lobbing it down a safe distance beside Harry.
Potter holds up a painting. Draco frowns and tilts his head, trying to make sense of it. It looks vaguely like Potter, but…
Harry gapes at Ron, his arm falling away from the fruit basket, his banana forgotten. Ron is even attempting to smile, although his jaw is rather clenched.
“So close, Harry, oh…” Malfoy gasps. He pulls off, heaves his upper body up and plants his palms on the grass. He arches his back, shifting his knees to thrust into Harry’s mouth. He’s crying out Harry’s name, his body shuddering, and Harry quickly gulps his saliva before grabbing Malfoy’s arse, driving his pulsing cock down his throat. Spunk fills Harry’s mouth, and he swallows it, licking Malfoy clean afterwards. Malfoy’s prick slips out of his mouth; Harry’s jaw clicks when he closes it, and he rubs the back of his neck.
“If you’d like to,” Draco says, standing up too and brushing his robes down. He glances at the pile of broomsticks and the lone football, tempted to spend more time with Potter under the guise of helping him to pack up. However, today’s progress is good enough, and with their volatile relationship, Draco doesn’t want to risk any chance of ruining this fragile truce.
Inexplicably excited, Harry rolls his chair closer, his questions rapid-fire and eager. "So what's his type? Is he seeing anyone now? What does he like to eat? If someone wants to compliment him, what sort of things should he say?"
Malfoy makes a strange, wheezing sound and yanks it away from him. He tosses it into the cupboard, shoves Harry away and slams the cupboard shut. He presses his back against the doors, his cheeks still tinged with a rosy blush.
He splashes back into the tub, and then darts a strange look at Draco. “So you’re… er… naked? Underneath the water?” he asks, gesturing with a hand.
"Bet that's all you know about my food preferences, yeah?" Potter says, a challenge apparent in his voice.
"I thought of you every night too," Harry says, licking his lips. "Thought of you when I was in bed in my hotel room, in the shower. In boring meetings and stake-outs. Thought of you so hard."
His mind shudders to a stop at the thought of being a couple with Potter. Before he can delve deeper into this train of thought, he hears footsteps behind him.
Sighing, Draco rubs his face. He shouldn’t have come out to the field tonight; even though it’s one of the warmer evenings, it’s still too cold for flying. He’s just about to descend when an Illuminated Golden Snitch darts across his vision.
He remembers the day when he signed his teaching contract in Minerva’s office, the ink drying on the parchment as he stared up at Dumbledore, who was beaming at him from his portrait. Beside him, Severus was looking at Draco, his black eyes giving nothing away, but the twitch of his lips was a semblance of a smile. After Draco concluded his business with Minerva, he approached Dumbledore’s portrait.
"Oh, look where we are. A park," Draco had drawled, his suggestive voice full of manufactured surprise one evening when they were walking home after a date. The minute he said those words, Harry's prick hardened so much and so fast that he moaned and adjusted his trousers.
Their sexuality wasn't something they dragged out into the open. If Draco eventually mustered the guts to ask those questions, what would happen if Harry's answers were negative? Draco would rather lie in wait for more hints and observations of Harry's behaviour before doing anything as rash as that.
Harry had told Parvati that he'd explore the two suspicious rooms soon, but Harry can't shake off his constant bone-deep weariness. His sleep cycle had been well and truly disrupted — leaving the club at three or even four in the morning, tumbling into bed and waking up late morning to pop by the Ministry or have lunch with Ron and Hermione, having brought forward their dinner dates to accommodate Harry's new schedule. Sometimes, he'd have the luxury of a nap before reporting to Serpentes at eleven pm.
The warmth radiating from Potter's body is intoxicating, lighting up Draco from the inside. The kiss morphs from something sweet, hesitant and gentle to something predatory and primal — Potter's fists are clenched into Draco's shirt, and when Draco grazes his teeth against Potter’s lower lip, Potter lets out a delicious moan and recaptures his lips in another hungry kiss.
Draco looks at the snow falling gently outside the windows, at the pair of Harry and Draco dolls sitting on the table and finally, at the photo album. This is their first Christmas spent in
“You do think of everything, don’t you?” Malfoy says, blinking at the selection of exercise attire available. He sorts through the clothes, and then stares at a neon-green sports bra.
Draco smooths his hands over Potter's back, his thumbs skating over his spine and tracing those admirable biceps. He lowers his body, his chest pressed against Potter's back. When his heavy cock rests on the crease of Potter's arse, Potter's body tenses. A tinge of trepidation seeps into Potter's eyes.
He's stopped telling himself that it's a coincidence after he brought the third Potter look-a-like home.
Harry and Ron share a look of mounting disbelief. Underground was a location uttered behind closed doors and mentioned only when agents disappeared mysteriously in the middle of a case. These agents — those that Harry and Ron have heard of, there could be more — were eventually proclaimed dead. Although there were whispers of them surfacing in this place or that from time to time, the consensus was that they were dead and gone.
He's rarely this distracted in the kitchen, but well... Draco's lips twitch up into a gooey smile. He's still in awe of Harry's responsive body from last night; trembling and gasping with Draco's every touch, hell, Draco could probably get him off just by talking dirty to him.
"I... er... thought that it's been looking rather lonely in that big bed," Harry mutters, ducking his head and rubbing the back of his neck, a sheepish smile winking on his lips.
There is a glassy look in Malfoy’s eyes, as if he’s recalling a memory. “I saw you here,” he says faintly. His unfocused expression clears, and his gaze drops down Harry’s body. “Saw you swimming in your tiny pants, and then I saw you do your exercises, your stretching.”
"Draco, where the fuck are you, I need you now, f-f-fuck!" Harry manages between clenched teeth. Fuck, that's it. He's gonna come, wash up and then hunt Draco fucking Malfoy down, in his office or at his home—
Strangely, Draco feels relieved at the confrontation, because he meant every word — it really had been the sweetest torture, the ultimate test of self-control; every time they walked together, Draco had to push down the desire to hold his hand; every time he made Potter laugh, he just wanted to reach over and kiss him. At least now everything was out in the open. He had thought that some Potter was better than no Potter, but Draco realised he couldn't do that — it had to be all or nothing.
"No!" Harry shouts in panic and thrusts an elbow up, catching Ron on the side of his face. Ron snarls and staggers backwards. Harry recovers in an instant. He has to be with Draco tonight, there's nothing else he wants for Christmas this year.
Harry begins to strike up a rhythm with shallow thrusts. Malfoy feels wonderful, exquisite around him, and he still can’t believe it’s Malfoy. Years of lust, desire and pent-up sexual tension, and he’s in bed with Malfoy, blond hair on his pillows, pale limbs splayed out like this,
Harry always cooked pasta whenever Draco was sick or upset. Eating his spaghetti was like coming home, no, Harry
Draco's hand, which is holding an uncapped vial of morning dew and hovering over a bubbling cauldron, jerks at the muffled sound of Potter's bright laughter in Weasley's office. Draco swears when five drops, instead of three, fall into the cauldron. He sighs in dismay when the potion turns a murky green.
"Thanks." Draco inhales the revitalising scent of coffee, his lifeline when stuck in a rut over an article. He sips on the beverage, then calls out Potter's name when the other man moves away. "I just got my posting. I leave for the US in two weeks."
Draco flings an arm out on the bed to fumble around for his phone. He opens his messages; the last text from Potter was sent when Draco was still in London. Draco taps his fingertip on the side of his phone, hesitating. Eventually, he types a message, aiming for something casual and breezy. Before he sends it, he reconsiders. Potter might be asleep, so perhaps he should text tomorrow morning? Yes, that's a better idea. He's about to close the message screen, when his phone buzzes with a text.
He's pleasantly surprised at this new aspect of Malfoy; at the spark in his smile and the twinkle in his eye when he talks about cooking. He's changed, of course. Who wouldn’t, after the war, but he still has that same sharp wit, that resourcefulness and a newfound resilience. Things had started rather awkwardly, but well, they've never been best mates.
With that rational thought lodged firmly in his brain, Draco goes to the loo to splash cold water on his face and give his dick a quick rinse in the shower.
Pork Chop swirls around in her basket to face him, her head peeking out from her coils. “Having second thoughts about chasing your mate?”
Malfoy relaxes. Here they are, two teachers holding hands as they take a moonlit stroll along the Great Lake, their faces coloured with pink glowing blushes.
The sunlight filtering through the blinds highlights the delicate bone structure of Draco’s features and his tousled blond hair. Harry pillows his head on his upper arm and stares at Draco as he grunts and begins to stir, hardly believing that this isn't a dream.
His new colleagues dissolve into a chorus of "Nothing, Harry!", clearing of throats and polite laughter. He casts a suspicious look at them, especially at a grinning Charlie, but returns to his pudding.
"Listen to yourself, Draco! You shelter him in the rain and then give him chocolate, and then what, years of enmity gone, just like that?" Pansy snaps her fingers in his face.
Draco looks at the food that Harry has unpacked: a selection of cheeses, a hearty pulled pork sandwich for Harry, a ham and cheese baguette for Draco, and a box of chocolate macarons that Harry recommended.
"Draco... it's brilliant," Harry says in awe, beaming at the last photo — the group photo taken during yesterday's housewarming party.
"Well, it worked!" Pansy cheers. Both Hermione and Pansy raise their pints, beckoning Blaise and Ron to do the same. They follow, albeit rather glumly.
Harry breaks into a run towards a nearby lamppost, skips onto the base and twirls around it in a dramatic fashion, with one arm curled around the lamppost and the other arm out-stretched, as if he's performing in a musical.
Potter relaxes and runs his hand through his hair. "I've always wanted to pack, but never got around to it. Or I'd start and get distracted."
"Fine, if that's the way you want it!" Harry snarls, and without a backwards glance, storms out of the flat and Apparates home.
"Almost three-quarters finished," Draco says. "I’m including all of the advanced charms used during my sessions, and it just might overtake
"No need to be jealous, Potter, I can hardly remember their names. I just wanted your attention. I love it when you watch me with those eyes, love it when I'm so distracting that you can't even finish your homework." He licks up Harry's neck and Harry throws his head back, giving him full access to nibble, lick and suck. "I want your attention on me all the time until you can't think of anything else, anyone else. Only me."
Ron speaks up first. "We're best mates, Harry. All of us. We didn't go through all that shit together only to have something like this destroy our friendship. I don't want to see you and Malfoy snogging all over the place, and it's gonna take me some time to get used to things, but if he's what you want, then we're gonna be supportive.”
Afterwards, he holds Malfoy close, committing his vanilla scent, the warmth of his body and the rhythm of his breathing to memory.
After a quick rest and a shower, Harry makes himself comfortable on his balcony, and places his Geminio-proof canvas on his easel. He scrolls through his photos, noting the earthy colours of gold, brown and deep red. He spends some time working out a rough composition of his painting. Finally, he picks up a pencil.
"Still too early to say yet, they're barely one month into the Academy." Robards cracks a rare smile. "No need to sound so defensive over McAllister. I have learnt to trust your recommendations.”
Draco’s jealousy, coiled up within him like a snake in repose, rears up and hisses the second Potter hauls out himself out of his chair.
Malfoy growls, a guttural sound that makes Harry even harder. He reaches for the lube. "How do you want it?"
Despite their apologies, the tense atmosphere remains, going by the stiffness in Potter's shoulders and the unease churning in Draco’s stomach. The unasked question lingers between them —
“It’s because I’m…” Potter looks away, his lips pressed together. “I’ve been told I’m too… y’know.” He clears his throat in embarrassment. “Er.”
Harry stretches in bed. He rolls over to Draco's side and buries his face into Draco's pillow. Hope flares in his chest.
"I found her in the dungeons! Care to explain what your fire-breathing Ashwinder is doing with my students? I distinctly recall you saying that you promised Minerva you'd keep your snake to yourself!" Malfoy says, understandably upset.
"She did." Potter laughs, a sound as bright and happy as a shot of summer. Draco looks at him with longing, another piece of his heart falling into place. Potter stretches his arms out and flexes his fingers, and grey eyes swivel to the tattoo stretching from the back of his right hand to the inside of his elbow. He raises his arm to the light, and Draco squints at the faint scars covering the back of his hand. They look like words, but Potter covered them with a date.
Draco knows that is true and unfair to Potter — he’s restless when he doesn’t have his attention, yet bothered about his presents. It’s terribly selfish and irrational, but when has Potter ever made him feel rational?
Malfoy opens and closes his mouth, struggling to find the right words. Drained, he shakes his head, and Harry’s heart sinks. "No. I can't promise you anything now. Astoria, she was…" Malfoy looks at their photo. "She's a big part of my life, and now everything's gone up in smoke. I'm not in the right frame of mind, emotionally and mentally. And my parents, Salazar, my family." He heaves a deep sigh. "I'm so confused. You've been gone for so long, and I don't know how, or even what…" He mumbles something Harry can't catch. "I need time. To sort myself out. We're not eighteen anymore."
Even though Draco keeps fiddling with his hair, and his left forearm is turned downwards to conceal his Mark, Harry is so happy and proud because Draco isn't running away anymore. "You look so much better blond," he can't help but say with a mischievous smirk.
Potter hushes him. "I'm scared too, silly. I feel so strongly for you, and I…” He sighs. “Don't run away again, if things get difficult. Don't leave me like how you did seven years ago, wondering and worrying about you." He threads his fingers into Draco’s hair. "Is it selfish of me to want to keep you all to myself for summer, shelter you from everyone else, even your mother and Parkinson?" he asks, taking Draco's hand and kissing each knuckle tenderly.
"He's not working this week — something to do with family, I reckon, but he did drop by two days ago," Jacob rests an elbow on the bar, his body angled towards Malfoy. "He's prickly and sharp when you first get to know him, but he's a pretty decent bloke to work for. Don’t get him drunk, though, he’s a dreadful drunk,” Jacob laughs, shaking his head, but the tone of affection in his voice is apparent.
Summoning every vestige of control, Draco bats Potter’s hand away, moving out from the circle of his arms. The other man’s grin fades. Draco grabs his wand and lights up a few lights in the canteen — not too many that it’s glaring, but enough that they’re not swamped in darkness.
Harry thinks dimly. They've been so hyper-aware of each other ever since they were eleven. This push-pull of aggression and lust drives Harry wild — his head's gone all giddy with longing, full of Malfoy's distinctive vanilla scent, the heat of his skin, the texture of soft blond hair caught between Harry's fingers, and his kisses, God, his intoxicating kisses, practically tailor-made for Harry because he knows exactly how Harry likes it. He hears a thump and wonders if that's his heart falling out of his ribcage because it's beating so fast, but no, that's just his arm going limp and dropping his bag, spilling books all over the floor around them.
Ron hauls himself up to a sitting position, his features twisted into a dark scowl. He punches the earth so hard that flecks of soil fly up. "It's her first Christmas, Harry. It's supposed to be our first Christmas as a family!"
"Now," Draco mutters when Potter spies an opening and goes as close as he can, bobbing in the air a short height above her mouth. Pork Chop's body unwinds as quickly as a whip, just the tip of her tail dangling from the end of Potter's broom and her head flicking out as she spills the powder into the dragon's mouth. She withdraws to the safety of Potter's broom, but she isn’t fast enough — one of the dragon's paws swipe her away, flinging her off.
“After the towers fell, everything — cars, fire trucks, people — was covered in dust and debris. Windows blown out. So much paper fluttering about in the streets, paper that was on someone’s desk seconds before. In the coverage, I remember watching this one traffic light changing over and over again.” Draco makes a sound that might have been a laugh but held no humour. “I thought, how perfectly mundane. A traffic light changing, as if it were any other day. As if thousands of people hadn't just been killed. But still, the traffic lights kept on changing.”
“Do you still think about that night at the pub?” Malfoy mutters, throwing his head back to grant Harry access, his words dissolving into a moan of encouragement when Harry sucks hard at his skin, that familiar lemon scent transporting Harry to that day in the prefects’ bathroom, sharing a bath with a naked Malfoy—
How many times has he listened to this same old story before, hell, how many times had they heard the same bloody thing from Harry and Weasley?
“Hi, you’re lookin’ real good,” Potter slurs, sighing happily and clinging to Draco like a limpet. He sniffs. “No lemons now ‘cause just came back. No big bath.” He brightens. “If we get naked at the big bath again, will I smell like lemons too? Can we get naked? Can we, huh, can we?”
It’s strange seeing Malfoy dressed like this, removed from the formality and rigidity of his robes, but Harry decides he rather likes seeing Malfoy in casual sweats.
Harry loads his brush with paint, and then brings it to the half-finished cloud in his painting of Central Park. The tip of the brush hovers expectantly in the air, before his shoulders slump and he puts it down.
"I thought of you," Draco whispers. He swallows, another piece of his heart falling into place when Potter slowly turns to look at him, his eyes round. "I thought of you, Harry."
"Where does he get off by ripping off my desserts?!" Harry shouts. He snatches the mug from Hermione, drains the scalding tea and slams the mug down on the table.
Potter breaks into a brilliant smile. He spins around and mounts his broom, with Pork Chop coiled around it, and his whoops of delight echoing in the air.
If only he stayed for ten more minutes, because there Draco Malfoy is, panting as he dashes through the downpour, his cloak billowing behind him and Harry’s name on his lips. He slips on the slick cobblestones, almost falling, but he rights himself quickly.
Charlie agreed to pub night to drown his sorrows, and then proceeded to get thoroughly sloshed, which led to him prodding Draco unceremoniously in the face and Potter shaking with laughter.
"Greedy arse. Let me take care of this, yeah?" His speed on Draco's prick increases, but Draco moves away and begins to take off his clothes.
"All that manufactured angst can't be good for his heart," Ron remarks as he finishes off one of Harry's abandoned chocolate bars that he had scavenged near the till.
"There's music," Harry says. "And even art." He gestures to a pair of artists painting on their canvases, dipping their brushes into their palettes every so often.
"Are you going to help, or do you plan on simply letting me do all the work?" Malfoy says, adding more bacon to the pan. He glances at Harry, smirking at the Slytherin shirt. "Plates are over there, and there's milk and juice. Or would you prefer tea?"
Draco's mind stutters to a stop. They just meet up for dinner and drinks and hang out once every few days, and sure, sometimes they do end up snogging, but that's not really going out
"Yes, I am well aware," Draco replies, heaving a sigh identical to Harry's. "There's just so many of them," he says. "And the history between our families…"
Draco jams the brakes on those thoughts at once. It won’t do any good to dwell on things that will never happen. This is just a one-off — just one night for Draco to get his Potter-centric obsessions out of his system.
Dazed, Harry closes his eyes briefly and swivels his stool to face the bar. As he nurses his pint, he feels his surroundings swimming back into focus, world clicking back into normalcy as though he has just been released from a long spell. He polishes off his beer and nods to Jacob, who winks back at him before busying himself with fresh orders.
"Yeah, I... well..." Harry trails off, wondering how much he should tell the other man. Hell, Malfoy's revealed so much about himself tonight, it's only fair that Harry should do the same. "I enrolled into Auror training, but I dropped out halfway. I didn't mind doing it, but it wasn't something that I wanted to do as a career. Get what I mean?" Harry says, wrinkling his nose.
Draco's handwriting is unravelling and his words increasing in speed, as if he's making up for not saying them often enough in the years they've been together—
It was a decision that George had never regretted. Nowadays, he treats Malfoy more of a partner than a subordinate.
A nudge at Harry's ankle tugs him from his gloomy thoughts, and he looks down at a soft toy in the shape of a chubby yellow dragon with large flappy wings. He picks it up and looks around for its owner, who is a small girl dashing towards him so fast that her long auburn hair streams behind her.
Harry growls and lunges forward on top of Malfoy, batting his hand away. "No one else can touch you now," he hisses, a flare of possessiveness burning within him as he lines himself up. "Only I can touch you. Only I can fuck you."
Humphrey chirps apologetically to Draco and surrenders, flying towards Harry and diving headfirst into the pile of treats, his bum sticking up in the air and years of proud breeding and dignity thrown to the wind as he pecks in bliss at the food scattered around his feet.
!" Harry's voice spirals up to a shout and Draco gasps at the vehemence in his tone. He turns over in bed at once, landing on his hands and knees, sticking his arse up in the air and curving his spine just the way he knows Harry likes. He wraps his hand around his cock again and continues to pump.
Harry knows that Draco has never stopped loving him. Because he's still wearing his promise ring even after a year, because he's never given up hope day after day, season after season, even during the cold winters of Christmas, where he had seen Draco sit in the falling snow at the park and look up at the moon as he held time in his hands.
"Harry, I..." he mumbles haltingly, sitting up. He holds Potter’s hand, tugging him close until he's standing in the space between Draco's thighs. "I..."
Harry's enthusiasm is infectious, and Draco shares a grin with him as they wait for the Portkey to activate. It's like they're eighteen all over again: when Harry persuaded Draco to skip class to visit Hogsmeade after curfew —
Draco’s jaw clenches, the familiar fire flaring in his bones chasing away his parents’ disapproval. “You’re on!”
Yeah, Charlie does make sense, like he always does. This is something important that can't be rushed; Harry can't go haring off after Malfoy until he's truly sure that he wants him. He sighs. Would be nice to know if the attraction is mutual, though.
Halfway into the song, Harry shifts his chair so that more of his body is tilted towards Draco. He rests an arm on the top of his chair, and pillows his head on his arm, a dreamy smile on his face as he gazes at Draco in dark-eyed rapture. Draco mirrors his smile, desire and longing turning his voice low and intimate.
"Not stopping. We'll go slow. No rush. Got the whole night," Harry soothes, smoothing Malfoy's hair back and kissing him slowly, sweetly until he relaxes, nervous tension seeping out of his body.
Harry quickly makes himself presentable, too. They leave the classroom and take the quieter route, running into no one; it's too late for the younger students to be out, plus the post-N.E.W.T.s celebrations in the dorms are probably winding down. His heart racing with excitement and surprise, Harry presses the heel of his palm on his erection briefly as they hurry to their destination.
"You're infuriating, you know that?" Draco snarls. Even before he's finished with his sentence, he's sliding in again, because any second that he's not inside that tight, welcoming heat is agony—
Potter must've caught Draco looking, for he quickly grabs the penknife and stows it away in a drawer. Another heartbeat of hesitation, before Potter asks him if he'd like a beer. Draco hesitates — he never drinks on the job, but it might be necessary this time. He agrees, catches the bottle of Hoegaarden tossed his way, and they take a long pull on their drinks. Immediately, the mood lightens, feeling as relaxed as pub nights. They share a brief smile, as if they've got over the awkwardness of a first date.
Draco takes out his textbooks and places them on the table. "I won't have you talking about my late mentor like that."
“Did you get bigger?” His eyes half-lidded and smoky with desire, Malfoy’s hungry gaze admires Harry’s cock, which twitches under the scrutiny.
Within seconds, he's muttering darkly under his breath and lobbing crumpled-up balls of parchment at Harry with such speed and ferocity that Harry can barely block half of them.
"I understand," Harry says, injecting a reassuring note in his words even though he doesn’t feel reassured at all.
They've been together for four years, and in these years with Harry, how much of it was spent with Draco's thoughts poisoned with pain and wreathed with worry about Harry's job? In the end, it didn't matter, because Harry's gone, he left anyway, he's
"It helped me kill Voldemort," Potter concludes. Next, he picks up the dull Golden Snitch, lifting it up to the light. One of its wings flutter weakly. "My first Snitch. Won it at the match against you, in fact. Dumbledore-" Potter's voice cracks, and he swallows. "Dumbledore bequeathed it to me, and what was inside helped me win the war." He puts the Snitch down. "I still remember the twinkle in his blue eyes, how he stroked his beard. He had many secrets, yes, numerous plans that he hid from me, but after all that's said and done, he meant a lot to me."
“Never, most likely. Besides, bigots like him don’t ‘grow up’, they turn into your father.” Draco shuddered. He used to look up to his father, used to think he was the greatest man in the world and do anything he could to please him, but when he’d came out to his mother when he was 13 and she’d told him, his response had been to denounce Draco as his son and assure him that he would be disowned as soon as he left school, so Draco had learned very suddenly that his father was not some wonderful, powerful man like he’d always thought.
“Mr Lupin?” A stern-faced Professor addressed him as he walked through the front doors of Hogwarts Boarding School, which apparently Sirius and Remus had forgotten to mention was in the fucking
of all people?” Ron was staring at him open-mouthed, while Hermione hid a giggle behind one of her delicate hands.
“Well, why did you do that? With Nott?” Harry pressed and Draco rolled his eyes, somehow managing to make the motion inhumanly elegant.
"Age regression is when someone mentally reverts to a younger age than they are. It can be intentional or accidental, and isn't uncommon in those with traumatic childhoods like your own. It is a perfectly healthy coping mechanism, and there's nothing wrong with it. Often people who age regress refer to their younger mindset as 'little me', or define themselves as 'littles'. I've had quite a few patients before who have been littles, so I can assure you there's nothing 'weird' about it."
Harry was suddenly reminded of a conversation he’d overheard a few years ago but not understood- Aunt Petunia had been complaining to Aunt Marge that “the electricity didn’t even kill her, so I’m not quite sure what will.” And he gasped, jerking back violently.
Harry nods fervently, his cock stiffening further at the memory. “You were gagging for it.” Malfoy threw him down on the Slytherin table and sucked him off with so much enthusiasm that Harry came in record time. Malfoy eyed his spent cock, made a desperate sound and swallowed him again, ignoring Harry’s surprised gasp and sucking him for what felt like ages until he wrung another orgasm from Harry.
Draco looks at the heavy velvet curtains and the windows, which are too small for a house of this size. He nods.
"Come on, Dan, give us what we've all been waiting for! Give us a show!" The presenter encourages, and the crowd cheers in response.
Draco edges a glance at Harry, his nerves flittering. Harry's legs are swinging back and forth, his trainers hitting the concrete with every swing. His hands are clasped loosely in his lap as he gazes in dark-eyed rapture at the scenery. Harry catches Draco looking and tilts his face towards him. Harry's lips tug up into an indulgent smile before he turns back to the river.
Apparently, he hasn't lost the knack for hurting Harry right where it matters the most. Harry retreats to the door, his heart sinking like a boulder.
Despite his intense curiosity, Harry has learnt his lesson. The last time he asked Malfoy that, they ended up at the Headmistress’ office, and he has no desire to repeat that, thank you very much.
The guest room has been converted into a storeroom of sorts. There are a few large cardboard boxes labelled with black permanent marker: Harry's clothes, Harry's shoes, Harry's Auror textbooks, Harry's Quidditch magazines and Harry's vinyl records.
Draco agrees, and they Apparate to Harry's place. They head straight to the rooftop, towards Draco's favourite spot — the reading nook.
Malfoy's still sarcastic, witty and snarky with an attitude that still makes Harry want to punch him in the face, but Harry can't ignore the genuine affection that Malfoy directed towards his colleagues tonight. Malfoy had asked after Michael's wife and two kids, laughing with the others when Michael told them stories about his daughter's first day at pre-school.
"Charles is your given name, isn't it? Why would your parents name you that if they aren't going to call you that?"
With matching grins, Harry and Draco laugh and scurry off to a quiet corner tucked just beyond the high street of Diagon Alley.
It's as if the world has stopped breathing and there's no one else in existence. No one at all, except for Draco and him.
When a raucous group crowds the bar, shouting out their orders, Harry shrinks back against the wall at his corner. Eventually, they return to the back rooms, and he hears the drone of the television. He hops off his stool and peers into the room — it appears to be some sort of game room with two pool tables and two dartboards. He goes back to his seat and nurses his drink, letting the energy and noise of Mona’s wash over him.
Although his voice is composed, Harry notices the tense set of his shoulders and the tremor in his hands as Draco replaces the last plate and wipes his hands dry.
And right in the centre of the front row sits Malfoy, sharing a table with Matt the redhead. Harry sees Malfoy narrow his eyes, throw his napkin down on the table, as if he's thinking
"All of them want you," Malfoy murmurs. At that silky-smooth, baritone voice, Harry wraps his arms around Malfoy's neck and ruts against him harder. "Your worshippers. Your silly fan club. But it's me, isn't it? It's always been me." He releases a low, mocking laugh, his thumb teasing Harry's sensitive slit. "When you sit here with your friends, I want you to think of this. Our little secret, how good I'm making you—" His words break off into a strangled moan when Harry wraps a hand around his prick, his other hand trailing to his arse, squeezing it.
He hears Pansy's vivacious laughter filtering from the living room of the flat that the three of them share, and Blaise's deep voice chuckling in response. Draco sits up and hugs his knees to his chest, angry at himself for even considering leaving just because of Potter. Britain is his home, his best friends are here, Sin is already up and running and getting great reviews. To leave would be to undo all of the good work they've done.
Draco opens his eyes wide in a pretence of innocence and nuzzles his cheek on Potter's inner thigh. The head of Potter's cock peeks out from the top of his briefs, and Draco makes as if he's going to suck it right there, but immediately does an about-turn and kisses the inside of Potter's right thigh, all the way up to his crotch, skips past Potter's cock — Potter
At the sight, Harry swears and picks up the pace, his body tensing like a coiled spring. "Gonna come," he slurs. "Where?"
Only then does he meet Potter's wide-eyed gaze. Potter's eyes flicker to the box, and then back to Draco. They don't say anything for a long moment, which isn't a bad thing. Draco hates empty platitudes.
Draco whirls around and dashes towards the Forbidden Forest. When he enters the open grounds, he looks at the horizon, gasping in horror when a large plume of fire lights up the night sky. A furious roar echoes, followed by a disconcerting muddle of shouts. A cacophony of birds squawk, fleeing from the crowns of the Forest trees. There's a ground-shaking stomp, and Draco stumbles in mid-stride as he hastens to the cabin.
Harry’s heart is beating fast as he says, "I'm glad you said all of that. I'm so glad you finally said what you're really thinking, but it’s my choice to take the time off. I’ll return to work when I’m ready to, but for now, I just want to be with you."
Many a time, Fred and George had caused explosions, to varying degrees of destruction and invoking varying degrees of fury from their mother, in their bedroom while inventing.
There's a clatter and a thump when Draco kicks over a table in his haste to reach the other man. Before his brain can catch up, he yanks Potter towards him and captures him in the circle of his arms.
Jacob looks at his watch. "It's only eleven! You should stay 'til midnight. The club looks and feels really different after twelve."
A poster tacked outside a music shop catches his eye—a pale, young Korean man with platinum blond hair and strikingly delicate features dressed in an oversized grey jumper, tight black jeans with rips at the knees and shiny black loafers.
"Hey," Harry says, poking his head inside. "Wondered where you were." He enters the room, closing the door behind him. "You okay?" He asks, lying down beside Draco and squeezing his upper arm.
They filled the days doing loads of things: feeding and playing with Charlie’s animals and Pork Chop in the Forest (Harry took great joy in re-enacting Malfoy screaming and running away during their detention in first year); exploring the castle and her many secrets; playing Quidditch and football (he will always remember the sight of a dishevelled Malfoy trying to kick a football, but instead falling on his bum); and introducing Malfoy to new things. It was brilliant, watching his wariness turn into surprised wonder at his first bite of butter chicken from
Harry releases a tired laugh. When Malfoy presses a kiss on the back of his hand, his heart somersaults at the affectionate gesture.
?" He splays his hands in the air, mimicking a dramatic headline. "Harry Potter courts Draco Malfoy at Hogwarts with roses, chocolates and assorted gifts! Both men are now off the market! Turn to page three for juicy details!"
His eyes wide in wonder, Harry repeats the motion, although he has to explore to find the right spot. Amazed, he gasps when pleasure ripples through Malfoy again. "Here?"
Draco nudges further down to play with his balls, but it isn't enough, Draco needs fewer clothes and more flesh on display—
Draco goes to Potter's iPod and chooses a song. As the music starts, Draco sashays towards Potter. Potter moves as if to touch Draco, but he slaps his hands away.
Humphrey hops closer, lowers his body and burrows his head beneath Draco's open palm. He peers up at Draco.
“The first people I have to lecture before lunch, on the first day of term, and it’s not even the students! The separate talks that I’ve had with the both of you seem to have fallen on deaf ears,” she continues, skewering them with a furious glare. “I was afraid that something like this would happen, but regressing into full-fledged fisticuffs, in front of the students?” She shakes her head in disgust.
“What if I saw some bloke leaving your place? What if you chased me away?” Draco lifts his chin and pushes his shoulders back, a steely determination glinting in his eyes. “I don't regret not asking you to stay, because what would have become of us? I wasn't in the right frame of mind to take this further. I want you to get the best of me, because that’s what you deserve. I want to get better for myself."
that I've got nothing to do with all the dirty business you get involved in," Malfoy's voice spirals into a shout. "I'm not going back to the Ministry! There's no way I'll get a fair trial with my past!"
Ron jumps up from the table so suddenly that his chair topples over, and Hermione closes her textbook with a loud thump.
He lifts his chin, looking at the windows with their velvet curtains. He half expects the curtains to rustle and Mother to peer out, her face breaking into a smile every time Draco returned home.
It's Harry's first Christmas away from home. He returned last year, missing the Weasleys and his friends too much. Although he can’t go home this year, he's not spending it alone. A familiar figure approaches the café, and Harry grins when Nowaki enters. He props his umbrella near the door and looks around, his eyes lighting up when he spots Harry.
Draco has never seen her like this before. He rushes to her side and tries to calm her down, even though he's barely recovered from his own shock. He wants to join Hermione in her misery, but one of them has to be the stronger one.
"I'm finished. You know the drill, no moving for fifteen minutes. See you at dinner later," Ron says. Harry nods and waves at Ron when he exits his room.
Draco flips to the front of the menu and automatically ignores the sandwiches and burgers — he's never really seen Potter pick either choice in the canteen.
She nods. “Yes, you may. As long as the standards of your teaching, along with his, is not disrupted, nor is the students’ learning and classes,” she cautions. “Oh, and I would imagine that given your complex history, along with his pride, that pursuing Draco might be a challenge. It would be prudent to remember this piece of advice, as the young ones say nowadays…” She trails off, a surprisingly mischievous smirk on her lips.
Maybe all they need is time and a whole lot of patience and understanding to coax this potential — potential like a rose's first bloom in a fresh summer garden — into something worthwhile.
A simmering, sparkling grain of hope continues to lie, dormant and timid, beneath his heart of cobwebs, like an almost-forgotten word after a long, tiring list of footnotes.
"Would you be free later to join a few of us at the pub? Matt, Jacob and some of the other dancers will finish their shifts anytime now. It's a tradition to buy new strippers a drink," Malfoy asks, nodding at the bartender when he arrives with Malfoy's green cocktail and Harry's Firewhiskey.
Harry steps back, stunned. He wouldn't have put it past Malfoy to vanish for a much-needed holiday or a particular bad bout of the flu, but the Ministry?!
Malfoy is still staring into empty space when Harry's stag disappears. Murmurs are breaking out amongst the students, and Harry's heart clenches in dismay. Malfoy may be able to teach his students the proper technique of the Patronus Charm, but Harry heard that he still can’t produce one of his own. Isn't it bloody ironic, that a Defence professor can't produce a Patronus when it's in the sixth-year syllabus?
Malfoy glances at it, and his lip curls with disdain. He glares at Harry, who meets it head-on, and then leans in to whisper in Harry's ear, his voice as light as silk, "No, thank you. I prefer the October 2002 issue myself." With a scowl, he withdraws, bids Harry a brusque goodnight, wrenches the door open and stomps off.
With that, he stops walking and presents a small bouquet of seven red roses wrapped in silver crinkly paper.
The warmth from Malfoy's hand on the umbrella tingles on Harry's skin, and he grips the umbrella tighter as he hurries away.
He looks down and rights the pitcher of water at once, cursing under his breath. Letting out a deep and drawn-out sigh, Harry puts his overflowing glass of water and the pitcher on the table and steps out of the small puddle on the floor. He winces at his damp sneakers and the uncomfortable feeling of his jeans plastered to his right thigh, but before he can cast a drying charm, Oliver Wood appears in the entrance of the kitchen.
Malfoy’s touch descends from Harry’s heaving chest, his hand slipping into his pants and wrapping around Harry’s hot, hard length. Harry swears when Malfoy begins to stroke him from root to tip. Desperation and lust riots through him, and he can only whimper encouragements, rolling his hips as Malfoy, with a look of wonder on his face, releases Harry’s prick from the confines of his clothes and strokes him for a while more, his fingers squeezing the shaft and thumb circling the head.
He makes a rather embarrassing sound, his words stuck in his throat for a moment. "I… wasn't thinking right. It must've been the rain. Made my head go soft. I'm sorry," he babbles, getting up and surging into a stumbling run.
They both look down at their joined bodies, and Harry gasps when he feels Malfoy getting harder in him. Malfoy looks back up and lowers his head, kissing Harry. Harry sighs and wraps his arms around his neck, his skin rubbing against the fabric of Malfoy’s shirt. He returns the kiss eagerly. Malfoy feels so good, filling him up completely from the inside, and his kisses are like liquid heaven-
...is a life-sized, fat and fluffy canary flapping his purple and white feathers, along with a pair of round glasses perched on his face.
Emboldened, with hope tugging on Harry’s heart like sunbeams, and the thought of being with Draco again is enough for him to slap his palms on his thighs and stand up, his conviction and excitement gathering momentum with every passing second. It’s five on a Saturday evening, which means it’s noon at New York. Draco might be home, probably is, after his Friday late-night gigs. “Okay. I’ll go now.”
"Definitely nothing wrong with your food, mate," Ron declares. He would know, having jumped at the chance to be Harry's dessert guinea pig when Harry was working on new recipes for Sugarcoated, the bakery that the 21-year-old had opened a year ago.
climb a ladder of day-old love bites up Malfoy's throat, refreshing them along the way, Harry recalls how he had placed them there just last night — the day before the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament.
Just the thought of Malfoy, decked out in his best dress robes, dancing with someone else, is enough to swamp Harry in a wave of jealousy and anger.
"So good, you're so good," Malfoy mumbles, the second afterglow of the night settling on them like the moonlight streaming through the windows. Harry's not sure how long he's been in bed with Malfoy, but it doesn't matter because Malfoy's so good, so good for him, only him-
The Ministry Obliviator did find it rather amusing—the story of Draco accidentally whipping out his wand in front of a poor Muggle customer and performing a Summoning Charm, causing a few bottles of tattoo ink to come flying into the room when Pansy said with a sigh, "My inks are in the other room."
"I... I'll fuck you however you want later, but this time I wanna do it like this..." Draco trails off and motions for Potter to lie down on the bed with his chest pressed onto the sheets. He offers Potter a pillow to rest on before sliding another pillow beneath Potter's hips. Draco gets on top and feathers a trail of kisses from the back of Potter's neck all the way down to the base of his spine. He kisses his way back up, his heart clenching when Potter sighs and splays his legs apart further.
Her tone is too casual, the smile playing on her lips too playful, and Draco is immediately suspicious. He knows that scheming expression. "Why?"
Despite his sightseeing and people-watching, he’s not on holiday. Harry puts down the Omnioculars, and glances at his bag of painting things nestled in a corner of the balcony. He’s hoping this trip would spark enough inspiration for his next collection of paintings. In fact, he isn’t sure what he’s looking for, but his instincts told him to take a break from London and see what lies across the pond.
A long pause. "Yes," Malfoy says. And then he rubs the back of his neck in the same way when he lied to Harry in the Room of Requirement, claiming that their first time meant nothing to him.
“You just gotta colour his hair in,” Marjorie says, tapping a fingernail on Malfoy’s head. “Do you do this for a living?”
Both boys look furiously at their laps for a moment, waiting for their respective blushes to go away.
When his fingers catch onto thin air instead of warm flesh, his eyes flicker open fully. It takes him some time to register his foreign surroundings and for his sleep-addled brain to chug through the parade of memories last night. He had fallen asleep with Harry...
There's someone tall and blond approaching. His heart leaping, Harry springs to his feet, anticipation rising.
He lets out a sharp, broken cry as he spills down Malfoy's gulping throat. After a moment, Malfoy withdraws and quirks his lips, allowing a line of come to trickle down his chin. Harry grins lazily; he loves it whenever Malfoy does that. Harry tugs him up from the floor and hauls him into his lap. He wipes away his come from Malfoy's lips and dashes away the tears at the corners of Malfoy’s eyes from having his mouth open for so long. "Even better than I remembered," Harry says, kissing him briefly.
He spins around, his mood lifting at the sight of Pork Chop, her long, pale-grey body uncoiling as she slithers out of her basket to greet him. Her body is as thick as Harry's forearm, and when she winds herself around his chest, she's long enough to coil around him three times. She regards him with glowing, red eyes. Her tongue flicks out, and the corners of her mouth hike up into a faint smile. "You have something for me."
“I should be the one apologising, because I… I wanked to you. I was there.” Malfoy points to a large tree a distance away, his words spilling out faster, as if he’s releasing them after holding them in for a long time. “Tossed my book aside, pulled down my trousers, and wanked as I watched you in those ridiculously tiny Speedos, thinking how much I wanted to blow you.” He shakes his head. “It was a complete invasion of your privacy, and entirely inappropriate. I would like to—“
Both of them spring apart at Zabini's lazy drawl, and it's only then that Harry's world clicks back into place. Their friends are staring at them, with the exception of Ron whose eyes are trained on a spatula lying at a corner of the kitchen. Parkinson's lips are pulled wide in a triumphant grin, one of Zabini's eyebrow is arched in amusement, while Hermione's smiling.
"It's your fault for flirting with me in the first place!" Malfoy wails, taking a step back. "Which decent person says things like
If Draco scrunches his eyes shut and pretends hard, he can almost hear Harry's warm laugh, see his sunshine of a smile, but when Draco pulls himself back to reality and opens his eyes, he's sitting alone in a house decorated with emptiness.
Harry pretends that he doesn't know what Malfoy's talking about. They agree on the terms and leave the dressing room.
"It's a good day for the park, isn't it, Harry?" Hermione says loudly, angling her head towards Teddy, who brightens at the word
And of Mother, the wonderful and delicious scent of baking filling the kitchen whenever she made his favourite chocolate scones to celebrate his return from Hogwarts.
Rose is sobbing into Draco’s chest, her small fists grabbing handfuls of his coat. Draco twists his upper body, shielding her from the towering figure of her father as Draco hushes her in a low and comforting voice.
“No,” Harry says. He looks out of his window and shivers at the frigid, chilly January weather — Quidditch trainings will be accompanied by biting winds and stinging cold. He glances at his watch. “No, I’m not. I’m going to talk to Minerva about it, yeah?” He hops off his bed, pulls on his trainers and heads for the door. He glances at his half-unpacked things, and quickly dismisses it. Eh, he’ll sort that out later. Plus, if he takes things out whenever he needs them as term progresses, that counts as unpacking too, yeah?
One week ago, Harry had barged into his office, all tousled hair and wild eyes. He was wearing his favourite
Starbursts of rich chocolate flavour fill his mouth. He's tasted Malfoy's chocolate before, but this one's different, special in a way so precious that he can't put into words. The texture of the cake is exquisite — moist, melt-in-your-mouth sponge wrapped in a silky sheen of chocolate icing, the crunchy blueberry adding another dimension to the dessert with a sweet, yet sour taste.
After they're settled at their usual table with their food, Harry finds himself revising his evaluation of Ron as his best mate.
Potter nudges his glasses up his nose and cards a hand through his hair, made even messier by the grass and leaves caught at the back of his head. Potter does that whenever he's trying to piece his scattering thoughts into words. Many a time Draco has caught him doing the same thing when he's hunched over his Potions essay in the library.
“Wanna watch you come. Your beautiful face,” he mumbles, his breath hissing between his teeth as he fucks into Draco all over again, his thrusts so hard and urgent that he bends Draco in half, the movements lifting his hips clean off the bed.
"Don't... don't say it like that!" Harry hisses, embarrassed. "Anyway, enough about him. How was your first day here? It’d take some time getting used to things, coming from London."
Harry’s body goes limp, and he lays there, sated. Malfoy transfigures his shirt into a large blanket, places it beside Harry and lies down on it. A long moment of silence stretches as they bask in the afterglow, gazing up at the stars.
, Ron simply lifted her straight up from the floor and kissed her hard, surrounded by whooping and cheering Weasleys; Molly was openly sobbing and the twins had struck up some song which made Ron and Hermione blush. Even Draco's parents were clapping politely at the scene.
"Are you working this Saturday night? Because I... I would like to take you out for dinner," Harry says.
"Oh, give it here," Harry grumps. Theo smiles sweetly at him as he grabs the files, stands up and lobs them over to his table. He sits back down and pinions Theo with a dark look. "Now will you tell me?"
Ron pauses in forking a mouthful of Yorkshire pudding. He puts his fork down. "Course not. He did look at me all shocked for a bit, but I just shrugged, said something about you being stressed lately, and paid for our meals."
"Do you know what you've done?" Malfoy whispers. He stares at the ring on his palm, and then at Harry, his grey eyes like a sky that could bring either sunshine or a thunderstorm.
Draco cries out when Harry's cock hardens even more in him. He's not gonna stop this punishing pace and, fuck, he's going at it so hard and fast, fucking Draco to oblivion. "Bit more, please don't stop, Harry, please!"
... after I'm done fantasising about you, I've got the real thing upstairs waiting for me. Gonna touch you, gonna hold you, never let you go, fuck, gonna wake you up with a blowjob tomorrow morning, fuck, just thinking about your cock in my mouth, I can't... fuck I'm c-c-coming, Draco,
"Potter, wait! Could you just... I'll be finished soon, just wait outside for me," Malfoy rubs a hand over his face. "Please?"
“Never in Hogwarts’s illustrious history, have we had two teachers fighting like that! What an absolute disgrace!” she lashes out.
The effect the mag has on Draco’s libido is so strong that just looking at the cover gets him half-hard, and the small note tacked on it certainly isn’t helping matters:
"Brilliant." Potter beams, and he tosses a second helmet at Draco. Draco places his laptop inside the back compartment of the bike, which has an Extension Charm.
Malfoy waits until he has taken his fill of pictures, then he looks at Harry, tapping a finger on his lower lip. "So what is it that you do?"
When he bursts into the Hall, only the Slytherin table is still full. The six Slytherin prefects jump to their feet. "Are you alright, sir? You're never late," Marjorie Kellen, one of his seventh-year prefects, asks.
The shadows stretched and slithered across the walls of the Astronomy Tower, the glittering moonlight illuminating Harry's crestfallen face. Draco rearranged his features to form a bland smile, retreating into polite formality.
"She loves travelling by train; she likes the view, and the vibrations make her sleepy," Potter says, a fond smile on his face as he gazes affectionately at the Ashwinder.
He greets Neville and Parkinson. Neville pulls him into a hug, while Parkinson congratulates Ron and Hermione.
This is a conversation that they've had too many times, and deep down, when Draco nudges away the flood of denial and unrequited attraction, he logically knows that Pansy's right — he will always be Malfoy to Potter, nothing less and nothing more.
, Draco wants to say, but what comes out from his mouth instead is a rather embarrassing noise when Potter seals his lips around the head of Draco's cock.
"Only they can fight by sending each other hand-crafted desserts," Hermione remarks. "At least I managed to slip in the black-haired man comment."
“Okay.” Harry sees himself out. Before he closes the door, he looks at Malfoy, slumped on the sofa and his back turned towards him.
"What? We won’t last? D’you think I'll regret getting a tattoo about you?" he says, recoiling as if Draco's words are a slap to his face. "After what I said to you..."
"Wow, you must be hungry. That's half of the chips gone," he says, with an easy smile. He ladles out a bowl of minestrone, sighing in happiness at the first sip. He peers up at Draco through his tousled fringe, and Draco suppresses an urge to comb it back with his fingers. "Sorry if I got a bit shirty with you. Wasn't in the best of moods," he admits.
Malfoy scans the streets. “I don’t see a blond girl… oh,” he trails off, his eyes following Harry’s appreciative gaze when the bloke climbs onto his bicycle and rides away.
"Did he mention it in the first place?" he asks, sceptical. "More importantly, will he even be alright with it?"
"Harry, I don't think you understand." Malfoy's tone is cool, collected and controlled, a coquettish smirk winking on his lips. He presses two fingers, his index and middle finger, right in the middle of Harry's chest, and then slowly walks them up to the base of his throat. He leans forward, his lips pressed below Harry's earlobe. He whispers Harry’s name, a sound like liquid sex that goes straight to Harry's cock. “You can do anything you want to me,” he purrs, his voice as light and seductive as molten chocolate wrapped in luxurious silk.
He glances at the guitars, and recalls the name of the Muggle guitar shop and school that Potter frequents so much. "If you like music so much, why don’t you quit the Ministry and work at Morgan’s? You’re practically teaching people there on some weekends anyway.”
"These things give you a sense of security, because they remind you of emotionally significant memories. Yes, we threw the jersey away, but you'd never forget your love for flying, your first Snitch, your first win.” Draco’s voice softens. “You still fly with us, don't you?"
"Really?" Harry sits up straight, scattering the crumbs from his jumper onto the floor. "That's surprising. Paris is pretty near. I thought you would've been there before."
Outside in the living room, Ron guffaws as he feeds Rose her lunch. When Hermione hears Rose's burbling laughter, she smiles.
Excitement thrums in his blood as Harry flings the curtains open. He can feel a thick web of magic here — protective and concealment charms potent enough to escape his general diagnostic spells. Harry starts to untangle the layers of spells, and he's finishing up when he hears Bacon's hisses emitting through the gap under the door.
Maybe the castle is forcing them together to sort things out properly. Maybe Potter misses him too. Then what's going to happen? Kiss and make up? He looks at the bed again.
while Harry packs his essentials into his backpack and leaves his school things in his trunk, with Ron promising to bring it to the Burrow after Hogwarts.
“God, yes.” Harry motions for Malfoy to lean forward on top of him until he’s on his hands and knees, giving Harry more space to thrust. “Gonna give it to you good. Like this, c’mon, let me fuck you good and fast.”
"Harry. Move away from the doll. Now," Draco ordered, his tone calm and imperious, although the lingering blush on his cheeks betrayed him. He took a step forward when Harry placed the doll nearer to his face-
"Please excuse us, Mr Potter. I think I'd like to have a dance. Enjoy the rest of the night," Greengrass murmurs, inclining her head. She leads Malfoy to the dance floor.
“Shhh… you tend to spoil things by talking,” Draco murmurs. They’ve stopped dancing at the same time, and they’re both leaning closer, there’s no stopping it now-
Harry doesn't need any more encouragement. He lifts his hips right off the bed and fucks Draco's mouth with abandon. Draco moans around Harry's cock and opens his jaw wider. Grey eyes locking onto green, Draco's pupils are blown wide with lust. Fuck, he's never looked so good before.
“Merlin knows I’ve tried to. So many people in Hogwarts, and it just had to be you, Draco. It’s always been you.” Harry lets out a truncated laugh before his tone hardens. “He’s back, and he’s coming after me. And I’m going to fight him. It will always be me against him. Me against your father. But you’re not your father.”
"When I realised we were the same age, I thought that I might see you at Hogwarts and perhaps we could be... friends," Draco mumbled and looked away, his fingers squeezing the sides of the doll lightly. He met Harry's highly amused gaze and drawled. "Imagine my horror when I met the real thing and found out he was a prat of the highest order."
Malfoy is probably working in Potions. He's also probably going out with someone; he's too fit and gorgeous to be single. He doesn't know if the Malfoys are aware about Malfoy’s sexuality. They definitely won’t be alright with it at first, but if there's one thing he knows about them, it's their enduring love for their son. Maybe they'd even let him settle down with a bloke in Wiltshire. An image forms in Harry's mind—of Malfoy and another man sitting in the Manor gardens, sipping tea and holding hands, comfortable in their life of gentility and stability.
It’s Harry’s fourth day here in Manhattan as a tourist, and he still hasn’t glimpsed this mystery musician. His hands hover above his photos, before dropping. Knowing that he can’t concentrate on anything else when his neighbour is practicing, he sighs in amused resignation and leans back on the sofa, linking his fingers behind his head. He closes his eyes, his grin widening when he imagines tendons shifting beneath warm skin with each strum, and long fingers dancing along the neck of a guitar, hitting each chord with precision and skill. He could be Harry’s type — tall and blond. Does this mystery bloke close his eyes when he sings, especially for songs brimming with soul and emotion?
"What safety features are there?" Draco asks, wearing his helmet and taking his place behind Potter.
"What? Who even talks like that?" he says incredulously. He wrinkles his nose and scratches the side of his face. "Er. Um..."
When they first stepped into Hogwarts as students sixteen years ago, they were rivals, and pawns in a war that started before their births.
It's been a magical day, almost like a... date. He's tired of this game, tired of their secret smiles, this back-and-forth flirting with no end and no resolution in sight. Again, those same questions about Harry's sexuality rear up in his mind. He tries to suppress them, swallow them down, but after tonight, he's not sure he can.
Marjorie's parents were Death Eaters killed by the Order. She's too young for Harry to tell her details, but he knows he has to, some day.
Harry lets Bacon disembark, then he goes to the kitchen, pours himself a glass of water and drinks deeply. Feeling much better, Harry enters his bedroom where Bacon is already coiled up beside a sheaf of parchment on his table. Harry sits down, loads his quill with ink and starts to draw a map of the club's interior. When he's done, he explains it to Bacon, who adds his own embellishments to the map.
They eat in silence, and Draco realises belatedly that Hermione must have had a reason for broaching the topic.
"The next Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw meeting will be next Saturday, same time, at the Hufflepuff's area — the Training Grounds. I will be conducting a session for the Gryffindors and Slytherins at The Quad tomorrow. Similar to today, I will be revising the same spells that we explored last year since today is the first Duelling Club session of the year. If you would like to brush up on today's spells, please feel free to drop by. Class dismissed."
"If you're well enough to say things like that, I reckon I'll take my leave then," Draco says with a sniff, even though they both know he's not going anywhere.
“Yes…” Malfoy had said shakily, flicking plaster dust from his hair. “I was trying something out. Something that the books didn’t mention. And… well…” Shooting George a helpless look, he had gestured to the ruins of his bench and the crumbling remains of the wall.
Pleased at Malfoy's reaction, Harry finally takes the fruit into his mouth, his senses collapsing into free-fall — the taste of Malfoy's rich, silky chocolate wrapped around fresh, slightly sour strawberry; Malfoy's hand sweeping down his torso and his abdomen, leaving a trail of bubbling heat all over his skin; his sigh, eloquent with desire as Harry jacks his hips up, silently begging for Malfoy to touch him right there all over again; the way Malfoy smells — of sex, semen, sin and chocolate and the way Malfoy looks at Harry as Harry devours strawberry after chocolate strawberry until there's no more left, and Malfoy wraps it up by sliding a finger at the corner of Harry's lips to swipe away a drop of chocolate.
“What else was I expecting? You stayed for my entire show,” Malfoy says, sighing in exasperation. He mentions the subway nearest to their place, including the exact exit, avenue and street before Apparating away. Harry follows suit, Apparating near the station. He walks to their arranged spot, and Malfoy brings him to a food truck selling Indian food.
Potter pulls on his fingerless gloves and winks, his eyes twinkling with mischief. He drums his fingers on the seat of his trusty motorbike, which is parked outside the Muggle entrance of Skinshifters, as usual. His beloved bike clearly has seen better days; it’s scuffed, the leather of the seat is worn, the metal parts could do with a good polish, and it’s covered with travel stickers from all over the UK.
"I love you," Harry repeats, because these three words are the ones that he has wanted to say to Draco for the past year. He continues, his words tripping over each other as they emerge in a mad rush, "I never stopped loving you, not a single day since I've been gone. I missed you every day; I miss your smile, your massages, your healing potions that make it all better, everything. Draco, please, talk to me, shout at me, hit me, I don't care, just do something, please!"
Although the ball did whack Malfoy on the nose a few times (it was adorable how he glared at the ball, as if it was the ball’s fault for not going into the hoop), he makes roughly half the shots that he takes, his brow furrowed in determination and a scowl on his lips. The first few times he scored, Jason and Leo cheered, and it was brilliant seeing Malfoy laugh. Grey eyes sought Harry out at once, as if he was checking if Harry saw him score.
Potter grins slyly at Draco as he tugs the blasted maroon shirt on. The minute he straightens it, though, Potter frowns. "Yeah, it's way too tight. I should toss it." He takes it off, and Draco appreciates the rare view before Potter wears his black T-shirt.
Draco nods. It was Harry's idea to host a house-warming party on Christmas night for his horde of Weasleys and even invite Draco's parents and friends
Draco retreats further into the shadows provided by the large tree. When Potter slants his body, he squints at the black ink-like marks on two locations — slightly above his left hip and a string of what looks like words occupying the inside of his right upper arm — those must be Potter’s tattoos. Draco is too far away for further scrutiny, but Potter did mention that he has a tattoo. Draco was curious, but he didn’t want to pry.
Nowaki chuckles. "Yes." He pushes his chair away from the table. "I'm going to order. Do you want anything else?"
When Harry's lips curve up into one of those sunny smiles that Draco has only ever dreamt of, Draco's world falls away.
Draco Summons a duffel bag. “Has she eaten?” he asks Hermione, hitching the strap of the bag over his shoulder.
They lapse into a contented silence. Recently, they’ve spent more and more time talking or staying silent rather than kissing, and Draco can’t say that he minds this change very much.
Harry reassures him that he didn't take offence. Charlie tugs at his earring on his left earlobe — it's a small dragon tooth, carved with the name of the dragon. The keepers at the sanctuary have a tradition: whenever a dragon passes away — whether peacefully due to old age or otherwise, such as being grievously injured in the dragon trafficking trade — they would extract its teeth and keep them as a memento, before disposing of its body respectfully. Charlie would craft the tooth into an earring.
He takes another sip of water and shifts around in his chair. He runs his finger along the rim of his glass, something for his hands to do.
Harry cards his fingers through Draco’s soft blond hair, and he smiles when Draco makes an adorable sound of contentment and nuzzles into his chest.
Harry brings him to the room next to his studio — he calls it the gallery, although it’s too small to be a proper one. The minute they enter the white room, devoid of any furnishings except for the paintings on the walls, a flood of embarrassment and shyness engulfs Harry. "They're from my last exhibition. About New York," he says self-consciously.
He pushes the clipping away, presses the heels of his palms onto his closed eyes and dissolves into a fresh bout of tears.
“If you were gonna ask about Ron and Hermione, they’re not with me because I’m not here on holiday. I’m here for work,” Harry explains. Malfoy doesn’t reply; instead, he keeps his head down as they walk past a lift. They begin to climb a flight of stairs.
"No, two hands on the broom. Pork Chop will be with you. She'll do the powder. She's seen us do this at the sanctuary. Tell her this," he says, and Potter does so.
"I think Eeylops wanted me to work for them, but I didn't want to. So I took my time and did a lot of testing before developing my own treats. I gave Eeylops a heavily discounted price for my treats. I told all the shops to keep quiet about my identity, because I didn't want people to buy my product just ‘cause it was me, y'know?"
Today, he tugged Malfoy to the southern edge of the park, which is much livelier with clusters of children running around the playgrounds, their grins sticky with ice cream and hands full of soft toys bought from the zoo. They walked past families and kissing couples rowing boats on the lakes. Harry really enjoyed the Mall — the pedestrian walkway flanked with rows of rustling elm trees. The area was bustling with buskers, artists painting caricatures and booths selling tourist trinkets, artworks of the city and cheeky badges about American politicians. They ended their leisurely stroll at the Great Lawn.
The sight of Potter peeking through the curtains surrounding his infirmary bed jostles Draco out of his reverie.
They spend some time in each other's arms lazing in the afterglow, waiting for their erratic pulses to tick back to normality and for their overheated bodies to cool down.
, wouldn’t it?” Harry manages a high-pitched laugh, and Minerva simply looks at him as he rambles on. “I’ve become rather fond of him, in a more than friends and colleagues way, so I’d like to know if there’s a policy about faculty members dating each other. So, er, just thought I should ask you, before I do anything about it.”
Harry opens his eyes. "Could be one of those membership things with flight miles, I reckon. Perhaps we could ask the counter staff about joining?" he suggests, wrinkling his nose in curiosity.
His gaze travels from her family to the other people on the viewing platform. Seeing all the couples amplifies the loneliness gnawing away at him. His smile dims. Doing things alone, such as sight-seeing and trying out new cuisines, never bothered him like this.
“I guess. If you need anything from Diagon that we can’t get in muggle London, though, just let me know. I’ll have to send the twins or something anyway for Teddy’s milk.” Harry knew he could always just switch him over to muggle milk, but it didn’t seem like a good idea.
That evening, he spent hours sat with his guitar and his notebook in front of the living room fire, writing an angry song about his father. Once the lyrics were done and he had a basic melody, he worked on finetuning it as much as possible until he was finally happy with it.
When Harry woke up from yet another nightmare on Friday morning, he stood up off of the bed only to be hit with the full force of one of his debilitating migraines, his knee twisting and buckling under him and leaving him sprawled out on the floor, still only in his boxers and one of Remus’ old sweaters- they were a few sizes too big for him, given Remus’ height, but they made comfortable sleepwear. He found it sort of ironic that even now he could afford his own clothing his wardrobe was largely made up of hand-me-downs, although Remus’ sweaters, Sirius’ t-shirts and leather jacket and a few of Ron’s old Weasley sweaters that were too short for him were definitely better than Dudley’s old cast-offs had ever been. He’d had migraines his entire life, and after speaking with Poppy over the summer had found out they had been caused by the repeated, unhealable head trauma he’d experienced from infancy to adulthood at the hands, or rather frying pan, of his Aunt Petunia. He wasn’t sure exactly why, but since the final battle his migraines had gone from severe, which he had always more or less managed to grit his teeth and work through, to entirely crippling. Hermione had a theory that it was because the horcrux had been dampening them somehow, but whatever the reason, they were terrible. They were made even worse by the fact that every single one always caused a severe flare-up in his knee, making him unable to walk even with his cane. He was laid on the carpet with his eyes closed, trying to muster up the energy to get himself back onto his bed. He knew that he’d have to do it himself or stay down here, seeing as both of his friends knew that if he didn’t turn up to breakfast it was due to a flare up, and honestly staying down on the floor was seeming like a much more appealing option. He reached out one hand and pulled his duvet down over himself, hearing it fall to the floor with a soft puff.
"And your business being a new bloke every month or so, is it?" Malfoy continues, his eyes flashing in annoyance and restrained emotion trembling in his words. "I can't believe you dated Dennis Creevey, he was such a worshipper. I didn't know your ego needed that much stroking!"
He steps back and looks at Malfoy, once cool, calm and collected, now reduced to a fucking hot mess of arousal and longing, because of
He's never seen Malfoy like this — wild, wanton and a walking wet dream; his trademark control thrown off like a cloak, all because he's thinking of Harry.
The party was in full swing when Draco took the chance to slip upstairs for a brief respite; Aunt Andromeda and his parents were huddled together near the fireplace deep in conversation; the Weasley kids, half of the Weasley adults and surprisingly, Draco's friends — Pansy, Blaise and Greg — who had popped by after dinner were being entertained (to varying degrees of amusement) by the Weasley twins' newest joke shop products in the magically-warmed garden; while the rest of the Weasleys were lounging in the living room, talking in small groups or dozing off the dinner feast.
It didn't help that Hermione and Weasley had the pesky habit of setting Potter up with blokes and women, and it was even worse when Potter brought his flavour of the month along to the Leaky. Draco could barely contain his jealousy then — ignoring Potter's date and to some extent, Potter. Draco drank more and talked less, ultimately resorting to muttering some flimsy excuse and leaving early.
"I have a surprise for you," Malfoy teases, rustling the paper bag just out of his reach. Harry makes a grab for it, but Malfoy steps away just in time. Harry heaves his shoulders in disappointment and sexual frustration.
Harry closes his eyes and nestles into the crook of Draco's shoulder. He inhales Draco's distinct scent of vanilla and is suffused with a sense of contentment. Being with Draco is nothing like he's ever experienced before — of Friday nights and love, late-night movies with takeaway pizza, lazy Sunday morning lie-ins and warm cuddles in bed.
Harry scoots closer to Theo and hisses his name. He’s not surprised when he gets no response; he knows how engrossed Theo can be when he’s got his nose in a book; he’s as bad as Hermione sometimes. He calls his name again, but his words are swallowed by the sounds of the lunch crowd — laughing voices, clinking cutlery, and scraping chairs. Huffing, he balls up a clean napkin and lobs it at Theo.
"I wanted the kids to live somewhere happy." Harry shrugs. "We practically had to tear half the place apart during the re-modelling. Even now, I think there are still some rooms we know nothing about."
He'd underestimated the difficulty of this particular job and client — Grimmauld Place is humongous, with dark secrets and Potter’s own ghosts nestled within nooks and crannies, along with his pesky feelings for Potter getting in the way.
Yes, the last two years have been painstakingly difficult; erupting in occasional fiery fights and punctuated with angry texts and phone calls. Yes, there were times when they gave each other the cold shoulder, but there were also moments that Draco keeps very close to his heart—cherishing each other’s mailed gifts, the bubbling excitement in his chest the night before either one of them came to visit, and the many surprise trips. Their separation only made them treasure their time together even more.
"You know how much I dislike it — I cannot move properly when I am under the charm. Not like you or any of your dunderhead
"Humps," Harry continues in that infuriatingly stubborn way of his. "And the rest... well, I don't know. They come and go as they please," he says, sliding the meat from the cutting board into the hot pan.
There was only one thing, or rather person, that caused him any problems at Hogwarts. His opposing striker, Draco Malfoy of Slytherin house, tormented him every single time he saw him. Sometimes it even sounded almost as if he was trying to complement him, but doing so poorly, when he made his comments, but Harry brushed the thought of it off. Malfoy was a dick, something Ron and Hermione confirmed, and a bullying arse at that. Apparently, he’d bullied Ron repeatedly for is family being poor, and had made derogatory comments about Hermione’s hair and teeth. He didn’t seem to do that as much anymore, but it just reinforced the idea in Harry’s mind that he was trying to be a twat, so he tried to focus on that and not on the way his arse looked in his football shorts, or the way his hair would fall into his face when he was studying, making him look soft and approachable and kissable.
Sure enough, the hat barely touched his head before calling out “Hufflepuff!” Teddy turned back to his Dad and his Father, smiling at them and shooting them a thumbs up before scurrying off to the Hufflepuff table. He immediately started chatting animatedly to the girl beside him, making his parents smile.
"If you like. Do you want to pick a book?" Harry dropped his legs and ran across the room to his desk, fumbling through a pile of storybooks until he found the one he wanted, while Draco moved over to the bed and toed off his boots, settling himself upright against the headboard on one side. Harry practically leapt at the bed once he had located the book he wanted and thrust it at Draco's chest before rooting around in his bedside table and pulling out a pacifier. It was a large, hardback book with some sort of minotaur drawn on the front called 'where the wild things are'. Harry scooped up his dragon and leaned against Draco's shoulder so he could look at the illustrations.
A thud on the other side of the table made him look up. The new transfer was sitting, staring at him.
Draco started to shake his head automatically, but then stopped and nodded- he did want Harry to know. “I guess we’ve both got shitty Aunts. Before my occlumency shields were good enough, Aunt Bella got through and found something out, and then spent the next few days torturing me for as long as she could without driving me insane.” He shuddered. “She didn’t stop until Mrs Weasley killed her. I really have to thank her for that sometime.” He smiled weakly. Harry tightened his arms, pulling Draco right against his chest.
“So?” Draco’s eyes were narrowed, but Harry could tell he was more confused than annoyed. It was sort of cute.
“Fine, ‘m up. Now piss off ‘n let me get dressed.” Nym grinned at him headed towards the door before stopping.
“Yup.” She winked at him and sat down next to him, throwing one heavily tattooed arm around his slender shoulders. Her eyes locked on Potter as he walked through the hall doors, and they yelled across the room. “YO! HARRY! How’s Siri and Remy?” Potter’s head turned towards them and his eyes widened a bit to see Nym there, their arm around a red-faced Draco Malfoy.
“Draco- this idea- it’s so lovely, I think it’s possibly one of the nicest things anyone’s ever done for me, actually. But it’s so, so dangerous, and you could be killed, or it could all go wrong and Voldemort could take over, and you’re a genius, and I love you, and I don’t want you to do this for me.”
"Will you read to me?" Harry asked, blinking his big green eyes asymmetrically as he looked up into Draco's face.
"You can have as many as you want, Harry, you know that." Hermione reminded him. He had given her his Gringotts card to keep ahold of for him before they had set off.
"Which is short." Draco teased goodnaturedly. "It's not a bad thing." He added, more quietly, finally sitting down across from Harry.
Draco had barely been waiting for 15 minutes when a big black jeep pulled up besides him, The Weird Sisters blaring from its radio. A cool looking pink haired person rolled down their window and leaned out, grinning at him so widely her septum ring touched their black-painted upper lip. “You Draco?”
. I kissed him deeply, pulling him right up to my chest and smiling into the kiss as he shifted his leg until it was slung over my thighs. I adjusted the blanket over us until it was covering us both from our feet to our shoulders and just relaxed into the kiss.
, you loveable idiot. That’s possibly the nicest thing I’ve ever heard, but if you ever attempt something so STUPID again, I will lock you in a room where your big brain can’t get you into trouble.” She threw her arms around him and he awkwardly patted her back, still unsure of what to do with physical contact.
“It is. Here.” He shifted it, lifting up one side so I could scoot closer to him and wrap it around my shoulders too. The weight was instantly calming- it released tension I wasn’t even aware I had.
that to get what you want!” Harry started to protest but Draco just spoke over him. “Look, its not like I’m trying to tell you to use your influence for nefarious purposes or anything, but using it for things like being allowed to fetch your son to school with you
“Okay, do you know the monitor charm?” Harry responded in a whisper, smiling amusedly as Draco just nodded and walked away. He cast a quick stasis charm over their food and took the plates into the living room, depositing them on the coffee table and going back into the kitchen to make two cups of tea.
“Okay, no problem, I can- I can do that.” Harry shifted Teddy against his body until he could hold him with one arm and reached for the quill Kingsley was holding out for him, signing each line Kingsley pointed to as quickly as possible.
After about 20 minutes of setting up, plus another hour of planning out Nym and Sirius’ parts of the song, they were ready to record. Harry set up a tripod with the camera on it, and Andi dug out some mics for each of them, and they were ready to record.
Kingsley’s booming laugh seemed to fill the small office. “Perfectly safe, Harry, not to worry. Now, I know you were intending to move into Headquarters, but if its even half as bad as I remember, that’s no place for a child. Andromeda’s house or another property would be much more suitable, if you’re amenable.”
“Ah, well, you see-” Draco licked his lips nervously, trying to think of anything to say that didn’t sound like a love confession.
“The woman who used to watch me sometimes, Mrs Figg, she was deaf, so she taught me when I was little.” Draco nodded, and he considered asking more questions, but before he even fully realized what was happening his eyes drooped and he fell asleep.
"'fink so." Harry's voice was childlike and confused. "'s that bad?" He turned back to look up at Hermione, his eyes scared. "'m I bad?"
“Alright. Where do you want to go?” Draco took hold of Teddy’s pram and smiled at Harry. Harry felt his heart flutter at the soft smile.
“That’s Draco Malfoy. He’s in Slytherin and he’s… well, he’s rather unpleasant, really.” She sounded almost apologetic.
Harry laid down beside him, mimicking his position. “You’re not being as much of a prick as usual tonight.”
Harry felt a warmth in his chest at that- maybe even now, Hogwarts wouldn’t get as bad as Stonewall had been.
Draco wasn’t complaining, of course. As embarrassing as it always was, particularly on the days Potter turned up when he was already hours into his research and mortifyingly dishevelled, seeing Potter soon became the highlight of his days. The man was just as funny and charming as Draco had remembered from school, and it brought the ache in his chest back to full force, the longing to be loved by Potter, to be someone who mattered, but Draco refused to let his daydreams impede his research- he would never be special to the man, and he just had to face it- surely, he was just a distraction, something to pass the time.
