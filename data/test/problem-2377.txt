“I’m here! Sorry!”
“He just married Nott! I don’t care!”
A flash of hurt passes on Potter’s face. “I cursed you first. I know you can’t forgive something like this, I’m not expecting it, but I
; he enjoyed Potter’s company. There was a difference.
Draco’s eye twitches as he turns on the magical display behind the fake window. “Your lack of faith wounds me, Potter.”
The last floor of Hamleys hosted a collection of expensive Lord of the Rings merchandise and Harry wracked his brain to remember enough lore to explain what the jewellery was. Draco had that look of keen, excited interest, so the matter of what Harry would give him for Christmas—or Yule, whatever—was all sorted out. He’d find a beautiful illustrated edition.
“Mh. Some soup later, maybe? We’ll start healing all the damage Vernon and Petunia did to you. How about a shower? A real one with hot water? For as long as you like. When you’re done, I’ll introduce you to someone.”
“Ah, sorry. Could you change the bedsheets in Draco’s room? You don’t need to do it right now if you’re busy—”
“How absolutely tragic. Kreacher!”
They learn about each other’s lives as much as they get to know each other’s bodies. They’re both clumsy and awkward, but eager to try new things. Draco discovers he loves sucking him off and Harry enjoys eating him out, something he wasn’t even aware could feel that good. He’s not that embarrassed anymore when Harry does it, though his cheeks and chest still flush. He suspects they’ll always do. It’s almost too intimate.
2. Translation: "Moldu, avec quelques charmes en plus. Tu peux le faire disparaître." - "Muggle, with a few extra charms. You can Vanish it."
“And we can do it from within the wards of Number 4 after we modify them. Before you tell me that the Ministry will detect the changes, they won’t, not with that kind of magic—seriously, are you the Wardmaster here?”
“You started it. And we’re not married.”
If Harry had planned the entire adventure on his own, they wouldn’t even have money. Did he expect Draco to access the Malfoy vaults? When his younger self was nine years old? This kind of brain fart was why Harry needed Draco in his life.
“Potter.” The first thing Malfoy did upon entering the house was sneeze, and Kreacher immediately pushed a potion in his hands with a horrified gasp. Malfoy stared at Harry, helpless as Kreacher dragged him away from the door. Harry watched the scene in confusion.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I swear.”
Greg had bought the shop after the war, struggled to succeed due to his past associations, then he’d hired Dudley, and the business saw a sudden growth just because “Harry Potter’s cousin works there”. As a recently-discovered Squib, Dudley (like Aunt Petunia, and wasn’t that ironic) could see the Leaky Cauldron without help, and he’d been looking for work among people who would understand what he’d been through at the safe-house during the war.
“Merlin, must you? How do you sleep at night, constantly wondering if I’m up to something, I cannot fathom it.” Malfoy gathered up his robes and sat with a disgusted expression. When Harry smirked, Malfoy’s haughtiness came back. “If you must know, Professor Flitwick has been helpful and welcoming to me this year, and he’s the only teacher who defends me. Not that it matters to you, but I think offering me a bracelet with a permanent shield charm deserves a reward.” His eyes bore into Harry’s, who ducked his head. “I gather it won’t be long before the Weasel tells someone about the Portkey. Mother will come for us.”
Draco gasped in mock-outrage. “How dare you? Your contempt for my misfortune has been noted.”
He expected his report to be snatched by his aunt, his arm twisted, while her shrill voice told him how useless he was. What he got instead was bewildering:
“Master Draco is home! Mopsy is being so happy!”
“Snakelings fighting each other… what happened to my school?”
Grey eyes gleam, and Draco clinks his can against Harry’s. “Deal.”
Harry squeezed Draco’s waist and grinned, eyes shining in amusement. “You didn’t tell him. You just grabbed it.”
The snow crunched under their feet thanks to a weather-controlling spell, something many ancient families used on their lands to give them an enchanting look when the grass and flowers died. Given the geographical location of Wiltshire, there was no way snow would hold until spring each year. There was also a tiny little detail that made the spell quite annoying: once it was cast, it stayed there. Nobody, Unspeakable or Charm Master, had been able to dismantle one. Even when it malfunctioned, it always repaired itself. Malfoy Manor was thus blessed by pure white snow and freezing temperatures from late November to March, even if the temperature outside of the wards soared. Very inconvenient for Draco at the moment.
“Aside from boiling the milk and turning the dough into a weird paste? Eggshells. It’s not like potions, Draco. If you leave them in, they stay in.” Harry looped his arms around Draco’s waist. “There’s a French restaurant with quiche on the menu. I ordered some earlier.” Another kiss. “Don’t be mad at me. The milk was spoiled anyway. I was going to throw it out.”
“Mh?”
Harry, after all. But Draco excelled at reading his body language. He might not know everything about Harry’s childhood, but he suspected Harry’s refusal to cook certain dishes had its roots firmly planted in these memories. From what he’d heard, the Dursleys hated everything out of the ordinary, which must’ve extended to food. Draco believed they might have had a limited range of meals they deemed acceptable. He’d be sick of roasts too if he’d spend years preparing them for a bunch of ungrateful, despicable human beings. “I wasn’t going to suggest that,” he said, getting rid of the whine in his voice. “What about cooking something together?”
From what he remembered from Sixth Year, they’d been attached at the hip, so something went wrong. He could swear it.
’d one of the books he’d taken with him through time, a 2008 release of banned runic rituals only certain Unspeakables had the clearance to read. It included time travel, but also powerful concealment magic that could make a Dark Lord’s plans very easy to realise. With this and the invisibility cloak, the Ministry would never notice anything.
They’ll be okay.
That was not a squeak. No. Draco doesn’t utter such undignified noises. But he’s so excited that he has trouble going to sleep.
Shaking his head, feigning despair, he ranted about the sandstorm that stole their tent and their stash of pistachios. Pansy’s eyes shone with a mischievous glint that sent shivers down his spine, and it worsened when she asked if he had seen Scarhead naked. Blaise hollered, Greg rolled his eyes, and Theo exchanged a long-suffering glance with Millicent. Draco hated how fast his neck reddened, memories flashing through his mind. They’d bathed in rivers, slept in close confines and shared a suite at a resort—of course, he’d seen him naked, and what a glorious sight that had been.
Warrington groaned, and Lavender let out the loudest sigh Harry had ever heard—well, perhaps just as loud as her relieved exhale when Harry had fired Chambers last year.
“I’ll get you a big, juicy mouse,” Draco promised, waving his letter until Regulus swooped in and flew away through the owl chute. The red bird flew side by side with him until Draco could no longer see them.
“Nobody is coming over unannounced with those wards,” Harry tells him, shooing him away as Draco grabs the spatula to taste Harry’s bolognese sauce.
“Depends on Teddy, you know.”
“Who lets a small kid colour his hair green?”
“That’s what ruminating is, Potty. Move over.” He straddled the bench and let out a deep sigh. “You have no idea what I had to deal with.”
“FUCK!”
He felt like he already knew the answer, and wasn’t quite sure what to make of it.
“There wouldn’t be any crack if Potter hadn’t destroyed so much of this place!” Unspeakable K mumbled.
The spell on his hand eventually kills the pain. He loses himself in Animagus theory, and it’s fascinating. He loves Transfiguration. One day, he’ll start the process to find his form, and he prays to Merlin that it won’t be a ferret.
Draco’s breath on his skin made the back of Harry’s neck tingle. “Lanterns. I’m assuming they’re not floating in the void. Are we standing on something? My feet are so confused.”
“It’s silky.”
With a shrug, Warrington stood up. “Still a few years to go before he gets his vault back, yeah. Unless he wants to sell the place and pay us afterwards.” He walked over to Harry’s desk and gave him a stack of folded parchments. “That’s what I’d do. Imagine living in the Dark Lord’s favourite hideout.”
Harry is about to say no, but then he remembers. He looks at the elf and asks, “Could you tell Hermione I’m okay? And bring Draco Malfoy here, if he’s not busy? Wherever this is. Please.”
With the map in mind, Harry flicked his wand to pack up the spider-free toolkit and finished his tea. He cleaned up and extinguished the fire while Draco disabled the wards and Muggle-repelling charms around the tent. One spell later and their rudimentary habitat was gone, tightly packed in Malfoy’s resized bag. Harry grabbed his backpack, lightened it with a quick charm and made sure Slytherin’s portrait and Noodle were comfortable—Noodle slithered up his arm, hissing in bliss at the heat and confirming that all was well. If a sandstorm found its way through the canyon, at least they’d only lose a cheap Muggle tent and not any of their possessions and friends. They’d been lucky to save them the other day.
“I did not. What you see is purely accidental magic. I cannot reverse it. Albert is alright, of course. The legs don’t seem to hinder its wings.”
They weren’t made to host only one person. When their rivalry started to change, they just chose one bed each and didn’t leave again. Harry was now living with him and getting to know him. It was an exciting journey into Draco Malfoy’s realm, for sure. Now that he wasn’t so stressed anymore, he didn’t fly off the handle quite as much, and he could even be
Careers, for a Malfoy man, were mostly tied to politics or law, though some of the ones who’d stayed in France were renowned winemakers and supplied Malfoy Apothecary all over Europe. Women typically stayed home and entertained guests, managing the household and raising the children—which was a very Muggle way of living for a magical family. Still, it fit their idea of nobility just fine. Thankfully for Draco, his parents always supported his dreams of working with either potions or ancient magic. If the Dark Lord hadn’t destroyed his life, perhaps he could have envisioned his future more easily. And as much as the Vanishing Cabinet brought back nightmares, it also proved that he
“Weird Sisters’ publicity stunt.” Contempt drips from her words. “Their fans are worse than yours.”
Teddy frowned. His hair sparked, alight with static. “It’s just a feather.”
,” Noodle hissed, coiling around Harry’s neck. “
Malfoy parted the folds of his robes, and Harry blinked. “Did you come just from blowing me?”
And things had gone too slow for both of them since their arrival. It may have been three months, but administrative procedures were snail-paced if you wanted to avoid Gringotts, which they did. Goblins had magic Draco didn’t understand well; they would know who they were if they stepped into the bank, and Harry didn’t trust them.
Grimmauld isn’t the sort of house where Harry is safe, but it’s still a place to hide. Most doors are closed, so he doesn’t have to think about what’s on the other side, like Sirius’ bedroom. Kreacher is at Hogwarts, though he visits once a week to see if Harry is still alive, and makes it a point to complain about the inconvenience. Harry’s friends hate this place. They keep offering to share a flat, or find him somewhere else to live, but the more they insist, the more Harry clams up and retreats. Harry is very much aware of the unhealthy environment he lives in, but he finds comfort in the creaks of the stairs, the dimly lit corridors and the attic. He moved his bed in there, and it’s the least creepy spot in the entire house.
“The Ministry will try to take your son away again.” At Malfoy’s sharp glance and sudden tension oozing from his every pore, Harry berated himself. “Sorry. That’s what I needed to talk to you about.”
“Daddy, I pway outside?”
“Morgana help me, you’re such a Muggle. A vow, Potter. Swear you won’t harm me, on your magic.”
He entered the Hopping Pot and paid a sickle to use the Floo and call Ernie, but he must’ve been at work. Harry wouldn’t barge into a house uninvited, so he had to go somewhere without wards to Apparate. “The Leaky Cauldron!” He stepped into the green flames, landed on his arse, and exited through the Muggle London entrance.
“If she hadn’t spent weeks babbling about Wackspurt infestation prevention, I’d think she’s trying to tell me something,” Harry tells him with a grin. “She’s done it before.”
She looked back up at him. “You’re speaking to Cho Chang-Nott. I carry the child of a Slytherin.”
. He didn’t pay attention to that rag, but since that first headline, (“
, and no spell followed, yet Harry still attempted to immobilise him.
Hermione squealed, and Ron elbowed him. “Well done mate, do we know her?” He scrunched up his nose. “Or him? Or them? See, Mione, I’m learning.”
Malfoy vanishes his cigarette and sits on Harry’s left. “If I say yes, will you be offended?”
“You’re not drinking enough water.” To reinforce the point, Draco opens a lemon-flavoured bottle of Volvic. The first time they went to Tesco together, Harry discovered Draco’s fascination with flavoured water. It’s nice; Harry doesn’t have to explain his odd relationship with alcohol if his housemate enjoys soft drinks. They still indulge in alcohol together sometimes — cider is Draco’s weakness — but they keep it for those clear nights where they stargaze for hours on end. Draco once mentioned his fear of getting addicted to anything after his experience with Dreamless Sleep, and Harry understands. To Harry’s surprise, Draco hates wine. When his friends visit, they always bring a bottle, because all Harry and Draco have are cheap wines used for cooking.
, and they roll on top of each other. They fuck. Harry holds him so close, Draco can barely catch his breath. He sinks each time he looks him in the eye, swallowed by an ocean of green. He drinks his moans and falls in love over and over again.
“Yes.”
Harry’s burgeoning smile turned into a frown. He’d tried to convince him to stay at Andromeda’s house when the Ministry gave him back his home. Due to Harry’s attunement to magical lands, he was aware of how dark magic polluted these old Death Eater houses and short of destroying them, there wasn’t much one could do about it. It was one of the things that had convinced him to hone his ability to command old earth magic to rebuild on cleansed ground. He’d heard it was how Hogwarts had been built; the Founders all possessed that skill. It was a sought-after talent among magical construction workers.
I'm back! I was on holidays and after that, work got busy, so I spent my free time reading and relaxing. It's still busy now, so I can't guarantee weekly updates.
“We need to talk more,” she eventually says. “Who knows how long this would go on if you hadn’t told me how you feel? I’ll keep inviting you to pub nights, but I won’t expect you to show up anymore. If you tell me no, I won’t ask for an explanation. No should always be sufficient.” A tiny grin appears, and Harry relaxes. “I know I’m pushy, I’m sorry.”
“Kreacher?”
“Just curious,” Draco said, a bit haughty. “What’s down there?”
“I believe we’ve heard your objections,” Croaker eventually cut in, and it reminded Harry that this man had been Draco’s teacher. Not everyone could have handled him and his no-bullshit approach. He was thus more inclined to listen to that man instead of Unspeakable K. “We already have facts. This ties in nicely with my current investigation.” He crossed his fingers and his eyes bore into Harry, who fidgeted under their intensity. “There’s a way for those beings to go in and out of the world in perfect balance, unless cracks start forming. My current job is to find and repair these irregularities.”
“You’re such a snobby twit.” The fridge slammed shut, and Harry leaned on the counter. “Go ahead, what do you want, Your Majesty?”
It takes hours to cancel that spell, and Scorpius is too excited to sleep. He giggles until it’s well past midnight and Harry and Draco are exhausted. Teddy, who has always been a great kid, decides to bring Scorpius to the basement to spend the night. They’re hoping it’ll calm him down.
Teddy’s fork clattered on the plate, but it wasn’t loud enough to mask Harry’s snicker. “I want an ice dragon!”
There’s no prying from her. It’s not that she was nagging before, but she still asked questions. Hermione must have talked to the Weasleys. This becomes even more obvious as he is spotted by the rest of the family when he trips on a muttering garden gnome. He is surrounded by chatty redheads, dazzled by their smiles, and infected by their happiness. For now, he’s fine, and he basks in their excitement. Ron is already talking his ear off about the Cannons’ latest failure, Charlie takes the basket and announces he’ll eat the whole thing if nobody stops him, and Fleur, appearing out of nowhere, drops Victoire in his arms.
He hadn’t lied in his letter to Potter. He’d been in the parlour, disgusted as he’d just spotted a stain that must’ve been old blood in a corner, and he’d snapped. After the zombie peacocks lurking into the night with their shiny red eyes, the echoes of screams that still lingered in the corridors, and the shadow of Charity Burbage spinning above the dinner table, helpless and broken, he’d had enough. He’d wished it gone, and there it went. Draco had been spat out, teleported in the safest place within the wards—the grove near the boathouse—with the belongings he’d accumulated since the Dark Lord’s defeat. The only items lacking any hint of
“Three meals a day was indeed an oddity.” The man smiled. “I’m glad to see you awake.”
Draco scoffed. “Oh, of course, blame the teenage boy, not the Death Eaters or, who was it? Pasty, no nose, smells like an open grave… the Dark Lord?”
Shaken by a full-body shiver, Draco can only grimace at this revelation that does not surprise him at all. As a Malfoy and a Black, he knows a little about soul magic, and he suspected that the Dark Lord had dabbled in it. This is merely confirming it.
). Even Skeeter thinks Professor Malfoy going home every evening instead of living in the castle is sweet, but it doesn’t stop her from spinning tales.
It was still early, and Draco had woken feeling immensely relieved: he could breathe in through his nose again! Good. He didn’t want to sneeze in Kreacher’s presence either, who knew what would happen. His throat still carried the remnant of his coughing fits, but it wouldn’t linger after another potion. At first, the thought of going to fetch a vial made Draco whine in dismay, but then he noticed he wasn’t cold at all, even as he walked barefoot on the wooden floor. All hail central heating. He rejoiced as he took a shower without dreading its end. He hadn’t felt this good in a while. He even took the time to release some tension, before pampering himself with the few products he’d brought with him. The light in the bathroom could use an upgrade, though.
Harry was genuinely curious about Malfoy’s first day here and delighted to hear that Thor had accompanied them outside. He congratulated Scorpius on his drawing when the child showed him the stick figures and the blob that represented his dog. He sat with him, answering questions about Thor. He explained that his dog was a rescue and that he was six years old.
With a gasp, Scorpius wiggled under his dark blue quilt. The goofy narwhals embroidered in the fabric swam faster. They gathered at the foot of the bed, reminding Draco that he still needed to figure out if real narwhals had been created by an insane Unspeakable after one too many drinks. Sea creatures often rendered him speechless, when they didn’t visit him in his nightmares (honestly, screw the goblin shark). He blamed his son, who had two passions: his Legos and the sea. Draco had been telling him bedtime stories about princesses and dragons, revisiting his favourite tales, until Scorpius started asking questions about sea creatures. At first, Draco had been delighted to educate his precious little boy, roaming libraries and bookshops to find child-friendly material about plimpies, grindylows and selkies. Still, as Draco ran out of magical creatures, Scorpius pressed on, requesting details about ordinary water-dwelling beasts. In Draco’s opinion, there was nothing ordinary about the vampire squid.
Draco turned it in his hand, catching the remaining light coming through the window and smiling at the colours he could see. Some purple, some yellow. A lot of red and a hint of green. “Figure I’d inherit a Gryffindor wardstone.”
Harry takes the hand lingering in his hair, and brings it to his lips. “And you?” He doesn’t need to ask a clearer question; it’s part of their routine.
“Every day can be a celebration if you wish hard enough. You made my favourite dish, and I will not allow you to squander your efforts with subpar drinks!”
“Just wait a few years,” Harry said, noticing the dark glare directed at the cheap radio they’d modified to work around magic.
Then Draco’s no longer sitting, he’s breathing in the scent on Harry’s pillow and drowning. In the back of his mind, there’s an awareness he’s fighting against. He knows something’s wrong. He hasn’t slept alone in years; Harry’s side of the bed shouldn’t feel like ice under his shoulder. He tries to believe that Harry’s just visiting the Weasleys. Draco’s not welcome at the Burrow. Draco’s not welcome anywhere; Harry sometimes goes, if Draco insists. So that’s what happened, right? Draco’s mind is a tricky little thing; it tried to trip him up. So Draco knows what to do: he waits for Harry to come home.
“You won’t. Not if you’re hoping to get out of here.”
She kissed her son’s forehead and left in a swirl of expensive fabric, and Harry glanced at Malfoy — at
“I just figured your throat might still be sore.”
flew through the room, and Harry caught it with a loud clap, opened it, and checked the table of contents. “Think it’s shortcrust pastry?”
Draco kisses his soft blonde hair. “No, you’re not. You’re a big boy, look at everything you can do with magic already! I’m so proud of you, love.” He takes his wand out, secures his hold on Scorpius, and summons his broom. There’s a loud crash, and it comes to him, twisting around, and Draco flies out of the room. The return to normal isn’t too bad if you’re flying, Draco finds. He lands in the entrance hall just in time; the spell loses its hold on the room, and the toys fall from the ceiling.
Harry searched for Malfoy’s hand and clasped it. Draco held onto him, and Harry promised himself that he wouldn’t leave him alone, crying in a bathroom, ever again. Whatever this feeling was between them, the few days spent here had already changed their lives for the better.
He chose to look at him then. Potter’s mouth was open, his eyes wide, and he hung onto his every word. Draco’s world felt suddenly much brighter. He told him about the Potter who had married a Malfoy a long time ago, making them very distant cousins, and saw the instant that Potter equated that with still having family somewhere. He also told him that he was just as distantly related to Longbottom and Nott, and more closely to the Shafiq and Boot families, and found himself hoping Potter wouldn’t burst into tears.
“Ready in thirty minutes,” he said, answering Harry’s unspoken question.
He fell.
, he replies, still without a single sound, and that’s when it hits him.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad Lucius Malfoy is rotting in Azkaban. But the boy? You did the right thing at his trial.”
Draco lost himself in the moment, mixing the ingredients with a fork because he didn’t know what else to use, trying to avoid a milk tsunami and basking in Harry’s presence beside him. When the smell of grilled bacon wafted up his nose, his stomach reminded him that he’d better hurry. A quiche was yellow; that must mean eggs. He decided to add them one by one and stop when the colour seemed right. While Harry took the meat off the stove and excused himself for a bathroom break, Draco grabbed an egg and looked for a mortar and pestle. Potions rarely required bird eggs, but the few that did had unambiguous instructions that he intended on following. He didn’t find anything useful, and his milk was starting to be very thick, so he just broke the egg inside a bowl by tapping it repeatedly at the bottom (splashing himself in the process), then pulverised it with a wooden spatula. With a confident smirk, he dropped it into the milk, then repeated the motion with three more eggs.
They sat on the teal sofa, and Draco pushed a cushion aside, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist and nuzzling his neck. Harry laughed, tilted Draco’s chin up and gave him a chaste kiss.
Harry sighed. “If it wasn’t important, you know I’d stay.” Harry was a responsible person who didn’t mind working a few extra hours to fix his own messes, after all. He only worked in the morning unless there was some fieldwork planned, so it didn’t bother him to spend more time at the office. It was
Harry glances around and notices Hogwarts quite a few miles away. There are more fireworks, but they are far enough to be silent. “I’ll rephrase: somewhere without a view on the castle and without people.”
After casting a Tempus, he figured it wouldn’t be long before his mum came home. “Thank you, Mopsy. I’ll take my tea in the sunroom.” He watched her pop out of existence and headed upstairs, sparing a glance for the white walls that used to be covered by a Victorian tapestry. Blood splatters and unthinkable fluids had forced them to redecorate after the war. The house went from a tired and old-fashioned Manor showcasing riches in every corner to a bright and welcoming home; the portraits had been replaced by moving pictures of their family enjoying themselves. Gone was the dark furniture, replaced by light wooden pieces and complimented by turquoise curtains. If Draco didn’t know better, he could’ve sworn Mother had found her inspiration in Muggle magazines. Still, he liked his penthouse in Covent Garden a lot better. There was no painful memory to face at his place, and he was far from the gloom of Father’s presence.
She was babbling about her daughter being such a good match for him when he retrieved his wand and walked past her towards the elevator. Mercifully, he was alone inside (with a dozen flying bits of parchment). He exited at the Department of Law Enforcement and hurried down the corridor, unwilling to meet his old colleagues, more specifically Smith, whom he might very well blast to pieces on sight. He walked quickly, reaching the end of the corridor and the Wizarding Children’s Protection Office that had been opened at the end of the war, replacing the previous one that only dealt with adoptions. He knocked, didn’t wait for an answer, and opened the door.
“I promise I didn’t.” With a sniff, Potter read the same sentence as Draco, bit his lip, turned the page, and stared at the paper. Then he threw his head back and laughed loudly, startling Draco, who grabbed the stack of paper. Harry let it go, now grasping Draco’s thigh and seeming unable to calm down.
It was sixth year all over again, Harry thought, rushing through the corridors to avoid Filch and Mrs Norris. Only this time, he was quite certain Malfoy wasn’t up to anything nefarious, but he hadn’t been at dinner, and that was just
“You’re doing it for free, aren’t you.”
Harry summoned his bag, reached inside and pulled out a pile of resized books and a stack of Muggle pieces of paper. A muttered Engorgio gave them their original size back, and Harry handed him the thickest volume.
It was a little after midnight when Draco came home and nearly fell on the marble floor of his hallway when he tripped on his open suitcase. That was one thing a great many people would never expect from a Malfoy: he was messy. Who would blame him? Elves had picked up after him for most of his life. He cleaned up for visitors or when the pile of clean clothes in the laundry room turned into the leaning tower of Pisa, or when the idea struck him. Overall, his penthouse screamed money and organised chaos. His books often distracted him from his chores.
“Are you done dying, Potter?”
.” He pushed his napkin aside.
As spring turned to summer, the Pygmy Puffs had babies. So many babies. Little balls of fluff covered the lawn and drove Draco insane with their squeaks, but they were too small to be sent to the Scamander reserve, so Draco would have to deal with it. Harry bribed him with a new ice cream flavour (white chocolate raspberry, with an extra box for Kreacher) when his mood soured. There were other ruffled feathers to smooth, including Zabini’s, who believed Harry would leave Draco now that he could return to Grimmauld Place. Luckily, Draco himself knew better. Leaving wasn’t an option. This bubble was Harry’s home as much as it was Draco’s.
He levitates a few plastic boats into the pool. Teddy involves them into a naval war, with enough splashing to warrant a refill. Loki participates in the mayhem, picking the boats in his beak and drowning them when Teddy declares them lost at sea. Harry’s cheeks hurt from smiling.
Harry takes it as a challenge. Draco’s right, anyway. He despises the house, except the skylight. But he hates knowing that Draco has to deal with horrific memories in his own home even more, and Draco is stubborn enough to stay there for years. “I’ll move out if you do.”
(Image: close-up of 3 snowflakes)
From then on, Draco had become one of his young self’s tutors. He’d been astonished when Mother let him teach him about technology and Muggle history. Lucius disapproved; however, he had little leeway when it came to Mother, as she had more sway over him than most people thought.
Draco gasps. “I didn’t ward the raspberries!” He bolts towards the door and Harry grabs his arm to stop him.
“Don’t flatter yourself. I have two hands.”
Malfoy laughs. “I’m good at pretending. I also never shut up, and I made my friends listen to me. They still get it wrong sometimes, but they’re trying. Did you tell yours how you feel?”
“I have not suffered the constant reminders of my humiliating failure to distract you in third year for no good reason. Your Patronus is corporeal. It won’t look like a potato if I freeze water over it.”
“Malfoy, do you live in the Muggle world?” he asks, because it’s all well and good, but it’s killing him to try to guess everything about him.
The arrival of a deer Patronus interrupted his foray into the first paragraph. “Malfoy, come to my quarters, it’s urgent!”
She walks up to him and Vanishes the wrapping paper littering the grass. “Harry dear, come inside.”
Harry ponders that for a bit and agrees. “Just the clothes then.” He closes the trunk and opens the wardrobe, and Draco arranges everything by colour.
“Master tells Kreacher to go and take a break, yes, says he doesn’t need Kreacher to survive, doesn’t listen to Kreacher. Never listens to Kreacher. Kreacher thought the beautiful Malfoy boy would know better, but Kreacher was wrong, so wrong. Kreacher is never listening to Master again. Kreacher does not need holidays, Kreacher is being healthy as a centaur, but Master won’t be if he eats that, no he won’t, Kreacher would never have let Mistress Cissa’s graceful son use the oven. Master is not knowing the danger.”
Huh, perhaps the Weaselette’s interruptions were good for
Resolving to sit in bed until the need became impossible to ignore, he coughed again, and let his head fall back against the wall. He’d often acted stupidly to save his pride and his honour as a Malfoy—when being a Malfoy still meant something. Accepting Potter’s help when Draco was the one who’d asked him to visit in the first place should not make him want to hide in shame. He wasn’t even sure it was shame. Perhaps a little? Embarrassment at his own lack of courage, mostly. He should have taken a bag and followed Potter straight away instead of being stubborn and staying here. But now he had a crush on him again, old dormant emotions rearing their imbecilic heads after a walk in the snow. Those feelings were never far from the surface. They surged at the most inconvenient moments because Potter was fit, and kind, and sassy, and great with Teddy, and unfairly intense.
The noise drops instantly, and when Fleur carries her daughter into the house, Andromeda follows with Teddy on her hip. The atmosphere is still cheery, but the boisterous guests become more mindful of their behaviour. Conversations spark, splitting the group apart as different topics are brought up, and Harry is able to breathe normally. He spots Molly watching him with a knowing gaze.
Harry’s hair was a disastrous mess and he was only wearing a pair of pyjama pants. Draco was too distracted to feel anything at the sight that his younger self would have killed to witness (his current self as well, to be perfectly fair). He still noticed the multiple scars littering his skin. There were so many of them. Harry also had Muggle tattoos - yet something he would most likely ask about later but couldn’t really bring himself to care about right now. What caught his eye most of all was the vial of potion in his right hand.
Teddy begins babbling about his trip to the dentist and circles back to his pirate ship, which is apparently huge and scary. There’s movement around Harry as people go back to their earlier conversations, and if someone is speaking to him, Harry isn’t listening. He only has ears for Teddy.
They graduate together, Harry with an O in Charms and Defence, Draco with straight O’s in every subject. It’s been a long time since Draco has felt that much pride in himself and he’s in such an excellent mood that going back to the Manor doesn’t trigger any anguish. His mother, usually so composed and regal, cries and peppers his face in kisses. She’s healthy and strong, but she clearly missed him.
“Are written by Muggle-lovers who’d rather deny the truth and dishonour the dead, than scare children.”
If Draco had been told, after the rise of the Dark Lord, that the laughter of children would brighten the grounds of the Manor again, he wouldn’t have believed it. And if Father had known who would be busy sledging down the hill, or sharing comfort food under a large, magically heated tent right on the spot where the peacock pen used to be, he’d have perished without ever going back to Azkaban. Perhaps Draco would send him a letter. And pictures.
“Hey, Dennis.” Harry pulled a chair and sat down. “I’ll have some cider. Half-pint, please, I’m Portkeying later.”
“How about the Weasleys?”
The leftovers Molly gave him are in the fridge, his gifts are on the couch. He’s ready to go to bed; he’ll take a shower in the morning, he’s too tired right now. He opens the door to the living room, and his heart misses a beat.
When Harry can’t sleep, he’ll look outside for the glow of Draco’s cigarette. If he doesn’t spot it, he goes for a walk around the harbour, or near the church on the hill if the harbour is crowded. If Draco’s in the garden, Harry joins him, and they sit and watch the stars.
If Harry had to pinpoint the time when he realised something was off, it would be five months after the war, when he visited his parents’ graves in Godric’s Hollow with Professor McGonagall. He’d wanted her there so she’d Conjure a headstone for Sirius, who deserved to be there with Harry’s parents but left nothing to bury. As she was putting the finishing touches to the stone, Harry spotted what he thought was a hag, hiding at the back of the cemetery, carrying a lantern.
All over the house, dried herbs and flowers were hanging on the walls, and magical plants proliferated outside. Harry had been told that magic attracted certain types of creatures and plants that he should be careful not to touch. He agreed that the Mimbulus Mimbletonia wasn’t friendly. It spewed some gross pus all over him once.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry hummed and ate one. “Tell me everything about Blaise, then.”
“I’m not dreaming?”
And that was when the door opened with a loud creak. The boys jumped apart, and Harry groaned internally at the sight of Narcissa Malfoy’s unimpressed frown. It vanished when she looked at her son.
Draco eyed the cuts and cleared his throat. “Let’s go back; I feel quite dizzy from the heat. My apologies for dragging you out here.”
Harry barked out a laugh and wrapped his arms around him. They rolled onto their side, exchanging a sweet kiss, skin glistening with sweat. Draco’s hair was a mess where Harry had pulled on it.
“You, Potter, seem determined to ruin this moment.
Harry expected at least some astonishment from Ron, but not that. “You—you’ve bet on my love life?”
“It’s a classic suburban area. Houses are basically stuck together.”
“I was about to cast the Cruciatus on you.”
“What he means is that he spent hours decorating yesterday,” Weaselette said with a grin. “Your room is upstairs.”
“Other side too,” she pointed out.
No way. Draco scoffed at the mere idea. “What on earth makes you think I’d want that?”
Entering the house was eerie. The ambient magic welcomed him, embraced him, as if Potter had enchanted the place to make it more comfortable. He put Scorpius down, removed his coat, scarf, tiny gloves and hat, then let him untie his shoes because he liked doing things himself. Once freed from his constricting clothing, the kid ran to his room.
“Well, where the fuck is it?”
They also couldn’t remove Baby Harry from the Dursleys without putting him in danger, but they could help him in different ways. They didn’t mean to arrive when he was already nine years old. It changed their plan again.
“I could kiss it better, if—if you wanted?”
“So, I was thinking,” Draco said, turning around to face him. His nose and the tip of his ears were bright red.
Just how many people did Ron have in on this?
Sirius, who was busy trying to compose a letter (probably to Lupin, and he’d likely never send it, the coward), didn’t look at him, only grunting in greetings. Harry, however, embraced him and breathed in the scent of his neck. Draco clung to his shirt.
“She may try, dear.”
“Oh, I didn’t see that. I’ll help you rebuild it, don’t worry.” This is the oddest part of this ridiculous situation: a few toys have left their spot on the carpet and followed Scorpius on the ceiling, some taking the fall better than others. Most toys, though, stayed put. The rug itself and the furniture haven’t moved, luckily. Scorpius could’ve been hurt. “Did you fall?” Draco asks, breathing a sigh of relief when his son clings to him and shakes his head. He still checks him over but doesn’t find any bruise or scratch. “Hold onto me, baby.”
Prior to the events of Saturday, Harry had seen Draco Malfoy twice since the war. Now, every time he steps outside, he runs into him. If there’s a higher power, or if Sirius or Remus or Harry’s parents are watching, they must be laughing at him. The third time Harry meets Malfoy by accident is five days after he knocked at his door; it’s a rainy Friday morning, and Harry returns to Diagon Alley after contacting Cho to confirm the lack of crowd. Teddy’s birthday is fast approaching, and Andromeda agreed to get him a Kneazle. Teddy will be three years old. A Kneazle or a Crup is the only animal appropriate for a young child, as they’re smart and fiercely protective, without the fragility of a Pygmy Puff. As Harry walks down the Alley, he works on his breathing. He’s feeling better after a week of using Malfoy’s potion, even if his insomnia is persistent. It still helps. He knows, because he does fall asleep eventually, and doesn’t wake in tears as often. He’s glad for his low stress level today, since Eyelops’ Owl Emporium reminds him too much of Hedwig. Fully prepared to repress tears, he enters the smelly, noisy shop, and comes to a complete halt.
Sometimes, after Harry woke up screaming, Malfoy would bring him a cup of hot chocolate and go back to sleep without a word. Harry would do the same. In the morning, they’d fight again. But
“You will?”
He never forgot to take the invisibility cloak, just in case.
The house didn’t need any decoration to be festive; the noise, the various WWW products George had sneaked under his mother’s nose, the presence of so many people casting colourful spells to amuse the children, the mismatched tableware Molly only used when she ran out of plates—it was enough.
There was no endless theory and essays with the Founder. In fact, Salazar Slytherin taught magic like Remus, and like Harry in the DA: hands-on.
On the right-hand side, stairs descended into the darkness. Straight ahead, though, were several pieces of wooden furniture, mostly chairs and benches, arranged in a semi-circle. At the centre, Harry spotted symbols carved into the stone floor. They reminded him of the runes on Hermione’s schoolbooks. A massive chandelier illuminated the windowless room, and two torches at the back framed a portrait tall enough to represent its subject’s accurate proportions. Malfoy gasped as the portrait opened his eyes and Harry stood by his side, wondering who they were about to talk to.
“I’ll talk to my sister.” She paused, then embraced him. “Will you stay for dinner?”
“Nice day for revenge, Malfoy,” Ginevra snarked.
Draco Ignis Black, born June 5, 1960, in Locronan, France, from British parents. The picture looked horrendous and didn’t even move. One would think that after living with a Half-Blood for the past four years, he would be used to it, but that would be too easy, wouldn’t it? At home, they even had a computer, which he did find quite handy, and Draco checked his smartphone ten times an hour, but nothing weirded him out more than still pictures. They were unnatural to him, somehow. What felt worse was the absence of his husband’s last name on that shiny new ID.
“Please Obliviate me.”
. Very interesting result.” Malfoy looks at his nails, and back at Harry. “I had no idea it worked on humans.” He rubs his hands on his trousers (black jeans this time) and stands on his feet. “Can you get up?”
“Yes, love, I have not forgotten, but you should think about an heir. Your proclivities aside, Astoria is a lovely young woman.”
“I’ll do my best.” A slow smirk bloomed on his handsome face. “Alright, Malfoy, you changed the subject, but you can’t fool us. Your honeymoon isn’t over. Where are you going next?”
Little Harry frowned. “I set it this morning!”
With a sigh, he pushed himself up and cast a Freshening Charm on the bed and the room for Malfoy’s comfort when he came back, then looked at the sleeping portrait and woke him up.
Digging, as it turned out, was a piece of cake for a wizard, especially one who had obscure knowledge. Using the new space under the stairs, Draco outlined a square and vanished a portion of the floor. He then used a spell to quickly reach the foundations of the house, before lengthening them, burrowing deeper. Another spell was used to Transfigure the soil so it wouldn’t cause issues down the line and he used the debris from the cupboard to create a sturdy wooden staircase. Transfiguration was amazing.
She closes her mouth and stares at him while his cheeks burn.
“Sorry if I was too busy saving the world to pay attention.”
He spotted some that must have been Latin and others in unfamiliar alphabets. He wondered if Muggles learned about those languages in History lessons; having only attended Muggle school until he was eleven, he realised he’d be in trouble if he had to go back to that world permanently. What about Maths and sciences? He was good at spelling, so that was one thing, but what of those who struggled?
He started by the first room and fought against the lump in his throat at the sight. It was perfect. They must have worked on it most of the night because it had fairy lights hanging from the ceiling, small furniture appropriate for a three-year-old, and the bed covers were enchanted with moving drawings of baby dragons attempting to walk or fly and falling over. The window showed the hills and a large empty field. When Draco looked up, he found the night sky glinting on the ceiling, and more importantly, the Scorpius constellation. He imagined the room filled with toys and books, and almost teared up. This was what he wanted to offer to his son. Not a mouldy room in a youth hostel, but a place to call home. Why would Potter do this for them?
It worked, and it was beautiful. Now, all they had to do was find someone with a dragon Patronus, but in the meantime, they could make a whole series of ice creatures if their friends accepted an invitation. Draco wondered if they could have their very own Winter Wonderland here; the grounds could be useful while they stood empty. He shared his idea, making Harry’s eyes light up.
“I’ll have a look at Privet Drive,” Harry told him, and he kissed the top of his head. “See how much money they’ll accept for Number 3 and what the wards feel like.”
Waving his wand, which is casting enough light to make the climb up the stairs safe, Draco tilts his head. “I heard you coming back and figured you needed a dose of Slytherinness.”
“Okay. So, I came back in time to help you, because I know how life is for you and you don’t deserve this. But because of the protection on the house, I couldn’t just take you away.”
“Just in time,” Lavender replied. “Cassius would’ve killed him if he’d stayed a minute longer.”
He knew what it meant. At the very least, no food. Perhaps he would be locked into his cupboard again for the weekend with only a bucket to relieve himself. If Uncle Vernon didn’t slap him, he would count himself lucky. Freaks weren’t allowed to be better than Diddykins in any way.
That made sense, but Draco still hoped Harry would talk one day. Not that Draco found French sexy—he really didn’t. He’d learned it from the cradle because a Malfoy was expected to be bilingual, and found nothing poetic about the way most people talked nowadays. When Theo, eyes full of hope, had asked Draco to talk dirty to him in French, Draco had taken a northern accent and used local slang, thoroughly ruining the mood. Theo was not amused. However, Draco valued intelligence and various skills; Harry being able to understand a language despite having never taken a lesson in his life was fucking impressive, and Draco liked being impressed. Also, it was
Draco glanced up. “That’s okay. May I spend the night with you when I’m done brewing?”
Maybe Harry could have fun in a pub with his friends in his current headspace. Or invite them over tomorrow. Those rum-infused-cherries brownies will kill him if he eats them all by himself. Might as well share. He starts mixing the cocoa and sugar with an old whisk, imagining how the evening would go, who would sit at the head of the table and joke about being the master of the house, who would get drunk the fastest, what they’d talk about — and his movements stop. He pictures it a little too well. Harry has nothing to say. He’ll find a topic, like crows and their ability to mimic (he researched it after meeting Loki, sue him), or Kneazles because he took Teddy to the shelter yesterday, or perhaps the book series since he finished the latest issue and is dying to see what happens but the next part won’t be out for two years. He’ll be enthusiastic. Words will fall from his mouth and everyone will tune him out, or pretend to listen until someone mentions Quidditch or scandalous gossip or Auror raids. And he’ll blame himself for being boring and fucked-up.
“I’m listening.”
“I’m here.” Potter stepped into the room with a grin, hair wet from a shower, a towel still hanging around his neck. His presence was enough to keep Kreacher at bay, as the elf was now busy arranging ten different kinds of jams on the table.
“Does anyone want a drink?” Andromeda called from the kitchen.
“I’ll destroy Croaker. And you, for going along with this. Also, myself, for thinking it’d be safe. I make a terrible Slytherin.” He cradled Harry’s wounded hand, healed it with a silent spell, and kissed his knuckles.
Draco reigns in his emotions. He’s doomed. Harry scratches his head and gets dressed, and when Draco catches a glimpse of his naked body, his prick twitches in interest. He smothers it, as best as he can, sitting on the floor again and pulling his knees up. Harry dresses in the same clothes he wore yesterday.
Startled, he bit down on his hand a little too hard and hissed in pain. Po-Harry. Of course. It’d had been so long since he’d had such a vivid nightmare that he’d forgotten his Silencing Charms. He’d needed them at the Manor, then at the Malfoy townhouse and when Scorp was a baby. Afterwards, having his child in his room soothed him and drove most of his dreams away.
“Malfoy, I’d have left you in Turkey if you annoyed me.” Wondering what happened to bring doubts to his friend’s mind, he reached out and squeezed his wrist, marvelling at the softness of his skin. “What brought this on?”
Warning: this chapter contains mention of anti-LGBT+ laws.
The wards started to waver. Not enough to let anyone through, but it encouraged Smith who, for an instant, looked eerily like Bellatrix, with a full, deranged smile and a malicious glint in his watery eyes.
Harry is so nervous and so giddy that he doesn’t even remember what the bad days of his depression are like. “You make me feel safer,” he blurts out, and Draco cackles.
“We have to find them,” Draco whispered, horror lacing his words. “We can’t—if someone finds more than one piece and deciphers the instructions—”
Later that night, a new scrapbook welcomed its first note. On page 1, it said, “
Malfoy rolled his eyes when Harry attempted to open it with his hands.
“Sweetheart, don’t eat that.”
“Come in.”
“You must be the only Ministry worker who agrees with me.”
Technically, Harry killed it, so it belongs to him. Draco chews on the inside of his cheek, unsure.
“It’s important.”
Draco smirked, turned around and nuzzled Harry’s cheek. “Shower with me?”
They took any shape and size. They lurked everywhere: human-looking creatures in the shadows of a tree, translucent veils trailing behind a passerby, black dots on a rosy cheek, tiny spiders clinging to a child’s shoulder. Some would pulsate or ripple, multiply or melt, leaving tar-like substances or a bright light in their wake. Harry understood he wasn’t dreaming when he let one of them get too close.
Today, the meal is mouth-watering, with so many dishes Harry has trouble figuring out what he wants to eat. Luna, sitting by his side, steals his roasted peach slices. Facing him on the other side of the table, Hermione glances at Ron gorging himself on sweet potato chips with a disgusted expression. Once the plates are empty, Harry opens his presents, and finds it more and more difficult as people surround him, talking loudly and making jokes. Victoire is tired and wails, which annoys Teddy, who had too much sugar and is whining about wanting to go play with his pirate ship and show it to Harry.
“How was that?” Draco murmured, nose to nose with Harry.
“Who’s a nutter?”
“Hi, Harry. I’m you from the future.”
It took ten minutes for Harry to stop laughing hysterically and ten more to understand that this man was him. And he had to believe it because he knew things Harry had never told anyone, about the cupboard and the spiders and Harry’s hopes and feelings, all the times he had wished he could fall asleep and never wake up when he was tiny and wanted to join his parents. How he didn’t remember what a hug felt like. Had he even been hugged in his life?
The siege wards didn’t vanish overnight, not even after the gash in his leg had healed. Finding potions in his room had most likely saved him from blood poisoning, but there was a different pain to deal with now. Lying on his side in that oddly lumpy bed, his feet sticking out from under the covers as he was too tall to fit, Draco stared at the pale skin of his left forearm.
It’s nice to be with someone who doesn’t need words to understand him. They’re so attuned to each other - it’s almost scary.
But something was bothering him. Never one to keep his mouth shut when he wasn’t in the Dursley’s presence, he stomped out his uneasiness and spoke his mind.
Then, Malfoy drank more Butterbeer and muttered that it had been too long and how much he’d missed the taste. Harry was stuck on the “bartender” part of his speech and the image of Malfoy mixing cocktails reawakened his body’s interest, which he once again stomped on mercilessly. But it was an opening and he took it:
Harry stares at him, then at the plate, which he takes carefully, as if it’s about to explode. Given the appearance of whatever Draco tried to cook, being wary is wise. His mouth twitches. “Thank you.” He doesn’t want to hurt his feelings, but even if he was famished, he’s not sure he’d try it. “What is it?”
“Since you asked...”
A magically binding contract would prevent Harry from discussing anything about this meeting with someone who wasn’t in this room. If it helped rid the world of his malevolent stalker, he didn’t mind.
She doesn’t like him. It’s okay; he doesn’t like her either. But she doesn’t loathe him, which is just too fucking strange. It doesn’t make sense. Then there’s Lovegood, who always smiles at him, or Longbottom, who greets him with that new confidence he built during the war. If Draco wasn’t already sure of his sexuality, Longbottom could quickly enlighten him. Too late. Draco knew he was gay when he was a child and crushed on Theo. He confirmed it in fourth year. It was Potter’s fault, then.
He wipes his hands on his jeans. They’re burning hot through the fabric, and they’re shaking. Seamus is bringing more pints to the table, hollering as loud as he can, almost dropping everything before Hermione and Hannah help him out. A large beer is pushed in front of Harry. He shakes his head, perhaps a bit too fast, and pushes it back.
Harry’s smile grew, and he moved a bit to give Ron some space. His best friend ranted about Robards giving him a last-minute report to fill when he’d already worked since four in the morning, and Harry congratulated himself on quitting the Aurors.
Draco has a pretty good idea. They went to the zoo recently, and Scorpius liked the millipedes; he spent the next few days asking why cats only needed four legs, why spiders have eight and not four, why Thestrals need any if they are invisible, and why snakes got rid of them altogether. Then, Luna babysat when Draco and Harry went on a date, and because Luna is certifiably insane, she introduced him to the wonders of limitless imagination and magical creatures that definitely do not exist. Draco tried to repair the damage; he did his best to prove to Scorpius that vineyards were not, in fact, populated by giant leafy millipedes pretending to be grapevines. Harry didn’t help, because he thought it was the funniest thing he’d ever heard.
“I wasn’t sure I could still speak,” Harry explains, rubbing his scar. Did he notice Draco’s emotionless mask? Surely, he must have. If that is the case, Draco is grateful that he doesn’t speak of it.
“Potter.” He exhales, and a puff of smoke twirls in the air.
, up for some Slytherin thinking?”
Ginevra was feeding Thor (really, Potter?) when he placed his Muggle novels on the shelves, strangely happy about the freed-up space. He could hear Scorpius talking to Potter, introducing his toys, insisting that Robert the sparkly yellow lobster was his favourite, and Draco knew he would change his mind in an hour. He liked it here. It didn’t feel like his own home, but what did, these days? Nothing had ever been as comfortable as his room at the Manor before the Dark Lord claimed the place as his stronghold, but perhaps this small house could make him forget the fear. He let a small smile form on his lips at the thought of the fairy lights in his son’s room.
The elf croons and wrings his gnarly hands. “Ooh, yes, Kreacher will get Draco Malfoy for Harry Potter. Such a good boy, from a good family, excellent blood, yes.” Then he’s gone, and before Harry can figure out where he is, Malfoy is by his side.
Malfoy carefully unpinned the parchment and handed it to him, but Harry quickly realised he couldn’t read any of it. “Is that—”
Draco would strangle Greg next time he saw him. He flicked his wand and felt the hold of the trap disappear along with the plant. Gabriel then escorted the woman out, and Draco stifled a laugh at the mortified younger woman who waited for her outside.
After juicing an orange to prepare the sauce, Harry slid the duck into the oven and cast a monitoring spell, followed by a table-setting charm. Molly was an excellent teacher. The plates, glasses, and cutlery aligned themselves perfectly. When Draco came home, he peered into the oven, wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, and kissed him slowly, before turning his attention to the bottle Harry was holding.
Draco came home with a satisfied smirk stretching his lips, stepping over Padfoot who had, as always, found an awkward spot for his nap. He could hear the sound of spaceships coming from the living room, now that Little Harry had discovered Star Wars and watched the movies regularly, and he could smell roasted vegetables. He tiptoed into the kitchen, finding
Draco dropped his fork. “What the fuck?”
Harry agreed just as someone swooned and another screamed at him to “give her all his babies”, which made him and Draco hurry to Goyle’s coffee and pastry shop. Harry crossed his fingers and hoped Dudley wouldn’t be there because that had never stopped being awkward, but his wish was granted since Gabriel Delacour was behind the till, which meant Dudley wasn’t on shift.
“What are you doing? You said human magic was terrible for food!”
“Those sarding* regulations will be the end of me. Broaden your horizons. From what I’ve heard, you only need an academic background if you work under someone else or want to be recognised by your government. So, don’t. Work for yourself. You said you wanted to travel; I’m sure, even in the insanity that seems to be your world, that there are places where a piece of paper doesn’t matter. You must have some money, and if you don’t, earn your coin on the way. Use your skills. And by the Gods, take Draco with you.”
“I forgot, alright? My mother’s portrait was screaming at me, and I wasn’t prepared!” His eyes roamed over both of them. “And I didn’t need to see you two in that position, ever!”
Potter shrugged. “You look cold.” Taking a tin out of his pocket and enlarging it, he handed it to Draco. “From Teddy.”
Their hands moved up and down, slow and sweet, and there was more soap, more shampoo—because they forgot they’d already washed up—more kisses, too, and Harry shuddered against Draco’s chest. They stood under the hot stream of water for what felt like many long, blissful minutes. Eyes shut, Draco held him and let himself relax.
“Er, you’ll fall down the stairs.” There. That was an excellent explanation. And Malfoy was quiet and accepted his help.
Harry’s stomach churned, and he shivered at the phantom feeling of icy water running down his back. “They wouldn’t. You’re an Auror.”
“What the
“To answer your question, no, I still live at the Manor.” Draco looks like his nose picked up a whiff of something nasty. “I do not have the means to seek another place.”
Was it odd, to feel proud of something that would have happened anyway? In the past two years, the child had gone from a version of Harry who needed saving, to someone Draco saw almost as a son. He’d never thought this day would make him emotional, but now he was the one who needed a hug.
His mate shrugged. “Easier to say than target one and two. The men who came for Scorpius at the hostel.”
Potter laughed. “Deal.”
Drinking in Draco’s confidence, Harry psyched himself up. The cloak offered them enough protection, as inconvenient as it was, and he tightened his grip on his wand. “All right. I’m getting out.”
The cigarette hung dangerously low in its holder as Draco muttered, “Neck—tickling—” and tried to avoid setting fire to the spiral notebook. Dean Thomas had created a small revolution by introducing the wizarding world to the concept of Muggle stationery. “That’s the third time this month?” Harry nodded. “Stop forgetting to take your invisibility cloak, you nutter.”
Now Harry was biting his lip and clasping his hands together. Draco shrugged; what did Harry know about French cuisine, anyway? “Is there something funny?” he asked, pushing the tart in the blazing hot oven.
The older man reviewed the parchment with a frown that accentuated the wrinkles on his forehead. He kept blowing air at a long strand of greying hair that stubbornly fell into his eyes, then sighed dramatically. “I’m very sorry, Mr Potter, but this is highly irregular.”
The small offices of
He shook his head, a corner of his mind registering that Teddy and Harry now sat nearby, involved in a debate on the merits of raising a colony of Bowtruckles. Children were fascinating creatures.
Mother would hate such a career change; Draco thought it’d be rather smart. Nifflers were cute and useful. Certainly worth throwing away the position he’d held for the past fifteen years, as long as his insufferable partner followed him. He took a sip of wine—Superior Red, nothing but the best from his ancestral winery—and closed the window before the evening chill seeped into his bones. His plans for tonight included Padma Patil’s newest romance novel, its cover carefully Transfigured into the Collected Works of Edgar Allan Poe to save Draco from his occasional visitors’ prying eyes. Perfection didn’t exist, after all, and Draco had a few guilty pleasures he wished to keep quiet. Some of his colleagues had the unfortunate habit of snooping.
Harry does. Hermione once told him it’s called the small bear’s pan in French.
“Right. Christmas lights.” It sounded good. Safe. Who would’ve thought Malfoy was that easy to please?
“So do I.” Draco picks at his nails. “I hoped to welcome you in a more attractive part of the house, but I’m afraid I was unable to reach my room in time.” He hesitates, and when Harry doesn’t reply, his voice softens, and he adds, “There are too many memories here, and I’m not always quick enough to go upstairs.”
Harry’s dead. He’s dead, and he’s not coming back to hold Draco and his side of the bed will always be cold, and Draco can’t bear it. He remembers a headstone beside Lily and James Potter’s tombs and the poisonous streak of light that stole his love from him—he feels all of it. The pain is burning a hole through his chest, and he screams himself raw. The apparition moves closer, it even
“Hey, what about Quidditch?” Ron says, and Harry’s mouth twists into what might otherwise be a smile.
“Sit down, then.”
Said Slytherin had a wistful expression when they reached a small hilltop, and Harry found his attention diverted from the admittedly gorgeous landscape to Malfoy’s delicate features. A snowflake was stuck on his long, dark brown eyelashes, and the tip of his nose was pink from the cold. He had the aristocratic facial structure of a Black, more obvious now that he was older—and while his grey eyes often reminded Harry of Sirius, under the pale sun, they were adorned with specks of blue, like dots of paint swimming in liquid silver. Harry had to look away before he made a fool of himself since Malfoy had developed a sixth sense to detect when Harry was staring.
He turned left into Horizont Alley, rushed into Carkitt Market and past Cogg and Bell Clockmakers, then cast
Teddy’s smile widens, and Harry calls them over.
“We didn’t see any ice dragon,” Harry whispered in his ear, unwilling to let Teddy hear in case he threw a tantrum. He might be sweet-tempered, but when he was tetchy, he still raised hell.
“Many species of dragons don’t actually have wings, so no, it’s a dragon, you uncultured walnut.”
“Yes, and that’s only sugar and lemon. I’ll make a new batch.”
The idea of splurging, of living in luxury thanks to Sirius’ fortune, isn’t the most tempting. Of course, Harry hasn’t worked since Hogwarts, but it’s not like he had a rent to pay. The content of his trust vault is enough for his everyday needs; he didn’t even touch the Potter’s vault, let alone his godfather’s. “If you sell the manor, you can buy it too.”
“I know,” Hermione continues. “I’m more worried about the Manor. Be careful.”
Ignoring the uncomfortable and absurd topic of proposing to Malfoy, Harry told his best friend about the match he’d seen in Turkey, aware that Ron would care more about Turkish Quidditch teams than the wonders of the desert. When it was time to leave, Ron hugged him and wished him good luck with a salacious leer, and Harry Apparated home. He changed into his travel robes, checked that Salazar had gone back into his portable frame and secured the containment unit inside his suitcase. Noodle hissed a greeting and coiled around his neck. Since his Remembrall didn’t light up, he took the Floo to the Ministry after leaving a note for Kreacher.
Then they’re nose to nose, and Draco drowns in these gorgeous eyes. He barely hears his heartfelt thank you, but when the kiss happens, he kisses back, and something explodes in his chest.
No, Harry had no idea. His respect for Ron, dulled by betrayal, sparked anew. Cho rubbed her abdomen, lowered her gaze and sighed. Her fingers tensed visibly, and she smiled bitterly.
doesn’t work either.”
Each of them was labelled Hogwarts Quidditch Team, 1992-1993. He and Potter were so tiny, and his hair was like a helmet (why?!). Their rivalry at the time had felt like such a serious, adult thing, and it had been no different than his feud against his father’s peacocks when he was five.
“We trusted them, and even after Godric found out they’d drained a large amount of magic from our land, we still believed they didn’t mean any harm—all of us, except Helga. She watched them like a hawk. We didn’t notice the growing despondency of our students and staff, or how easily they listened and obeyed, and soon I was affected by such a deep sense of loss that I would’ve done
Ginny lands in front of him with a wide grin. “Well, look who is here, bringing gifts on his birthday!” She rests her broom on her shoulder. “You know, if you want to give me something, I’ll take your house. It’s perfect.”
A retort stung his tongue but didn’t make it out of his mouth. It was true that the Headmaster had been somewhat biased. Points shouldn’t have been granted for activities that had nothing to do with school or were against the rules. Harry had to agree with his inner Slytherin there; it was great to win the House Cup, but quite unfair. That traitorous part of his mind showed him the Feast in first year and the disbelief from the Slytherins when the Cup was stolen from them. Uneasy, he banished that thought and let out a sigh. “Okay. Welcome to the Chamber, and yes, that’s Slytherin’s Basilisk. Though I don’t know why it looks like that.”
“You say you don’t know everything. Maybe you don’t know about cucumbers.”
the same spell? Something like,
“Make me.”
He lands in Hermione’s living room and has to squint as the late-afternoon sunlight streams through the open window. The flat is the complete opposite of Grimmauld Place, and so very Hermione, with the knitted throw blanket on the sofa and handcrafted candles on the table. She owns bland Ikea furniture, and the only items she truly cares about are her books. She has quite the collection.
Romance may seem dead, especially because the car is cramped and hitting one’s head against the roof hurts, but as Harry relishes in their intimacy and warmth, he thinks it might not be entirely true. Draco’s smile, the way he pulls on his hair, the marks he leaves on his throat, the strength of his arms around him, feel very much like love.
, his mind screamed.
Harry comes in his trousers and Draco sags against him, sucking at his neck lazily. “I’m sure there’s a rule somewhere about sex being discouraged between housemates,” Harry says once he can breathe normally again, his palms still resting on the soft skin of Draco’s arse.
Doesn’t Harry spend all his vacations with them, when he can?
He Apparated in the alley behind his favourite coffee shop and made his way inside. The new kid behind the counter turned bright red and sputtered a greeting, and Harry was grateful that as obvious as he was about Malfoy, it was
Harry’s snort was loud and unrefined. “It’s a stag, not a dragon.”
Mrs Malkin makes him stand on a small stool to measure him. She’s there, but she’s not, at the same time.
There’s a peal of laughter coming from the conservatory and Draco doesn’t miss the subtle twitch of Mother’s eyebrows. He notices the odd strand of hair escaping her braid, and wonders if Scorpius threw a tantrum. That would be quite unlike him; his precious little bean is nothing like Draco was at his age.
“Maybe?”
Draco couldn’t stomach much, these days, but this was quite different from the opulent feast offered in the Great Hall. He sat up as slowly as possible, because his arm hurt, and took a piece of the bread.
“Mulled wine?” Arthur asked from behind the couch.
Exhaling loudly, Draco agreed. It was all Teddy’s fault. Why did he share Scorpius’ fascination with animals, honestly?
“Creepy, green, dark—but the window is awesome. The Giant Squid was there.” Teddy spots the Dirigible Plum tree and their eyes light up. “Ooh is that mine?”
They didn’t hold hands through the meal—Draco had never been too comfortable with affection in front of family or at the table, and it would’ve been impractical. They did sit close, though. Andromeda had made mushroom bruschetta followed by mouth-watering saltimbocca that made Draco want to worship the ground she walked on. Mother even asked for the recipe, which meant she was willing to set foot in a kitchen. Wonders would never cease.
“What? No!” Malfoy shoves something into Harry’s chest, and Harry grabs it. It’s a box. “Take it. You need it.”
“Harry said a bad word, Grandma!”
"Happy to help." Draco fingered the edge of his glass, distracted, then dug in at his stomach's loud protest.
“Your father, who was an Auror, was the only son of Euphemia Grace and Fleamont Henry Potter. They lived in their ancestral home, Potter Manor, in Wiltshire—close to Malfoy Manor, until James moved out to be with your mother. Euphemia hailed from a long line of Purebloods from Greece, who could trace their line back to the Mycenaean period.” He stopped briefly and added the date. “She was a Healer. Fleamont created an empire with haircare products. That’s where most of the Potter wealth comes from these days. Going further back, there’s your great-grandfather, Henry James Potter, a Curse-Breaker, whom you were named after. Most of your family has Greek and Middle-Eastern roots.”
you wanted.”
“More like a satellite.”
“How did you manage to use a Ministry owl?” Harry asked next.
took a walk on his arm before rushing back into the safety of the bushy beard! He was now wary of anyone distributing free hugs.
“Hermione!”
“You bet.”
Harry nods towards the door. “Come on in; your room is ready.”
“Draco, stop that. You need it as much as I do.”
“You little tease,” Draco groaned. He washed Harry’s hair in return, then his shoulders, before wrapping his hand around his and Harry’s cocks, heavy and full, and pulling with that little twist of his wrist at the end. Harry let out a loud moan and kissed him.
“Yes, it
“Yeees,” he drawled. It was an excellent Snape impression. “
“I’ll be right back.” He left the house, heading into the garden, then called Dobby.
Draco tries, anyway.
Harry holds him close, and they slowly make their way to the dormitory. Kreacher is there, and at the foot of the bed Harry sometimes slept in, there’s Harry’s trunk.
“McGonagall asked, and it’s important to remember.”
Behind Harry, a chair splintered and exploded. He stepped away from Malfoy, stunned. Was that accidental magic? The other boy was pulling at his hair, and Harry could see blood seeping through the bandage.
Brushing crumbs off his jumper, Draco closed the tin and put it on the tiny kitchen counter, between a pile of chipped teacups and an array of potion vials. “Before you panic, yes, the wardstone is safe.” And it was. Draco had no wish to see the lands turned into a copy of the Forbidden Forest, Acromantulas included. But no self-respecting wizard would dare ask to see it, and Potter had learned some manners since school. Draco thus had no need to open the sealed box hidden under the bed. “I apologise for the mess. It’s not mine,” he found himself saying when Potter grimaced and stepped away from a dead moth pinned on the wall.
. Brew that potion? Please?”
” was stuck to the massive treats jar by the sink. “
“I’m okay,” Harry blurted between two coughs, adjusting his glasses and moving his legs to keep his head out of the hole. Actually, he was even more than okay. The freshness of the water was delightful. It stung quite a bit now though; Harry must’ve gotten scratched in his fall. He glanced at Amanuel. “Does that happen often?”
So much for discretion. Well, after their outing in Diagon Alley, they’d be on the front page of the
“That’s what you were doing all these years?”
By the end of the train ride, Draco and Hermione were arguing about something called physics that completely went over Harry’s head, Vincent and Ron were in a food coma, Greg was covered in empty candy wrappers, and Harry was exchanging chocolate frog cards with Pansy.
“That’s my line.”
It turned out to be a grand idea: Andromeda had a massive fireplace. While they undressed in the entrance hall, she lit a fire, and Harry, Draco, Teddy and Narcissa lounged in front of the flames, their feet up to warm their cold socks, which was an odd sight. Andromeda joined them after ordering their food, and she shared stories about her daughter’s fascination with fairs and how risky it was to take her anywhere because she changed her hair colour on purpose when she knew she shouldn’t. At some point, Harry leaned into Draco’s side, and Draco wrapped his arm around him, not that bothered by his family seeing them after all.
