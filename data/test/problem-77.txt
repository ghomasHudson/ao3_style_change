She rescued him by rolling her eyes and looking back down at the file she’d been examining. She drawled, “Oh, you mean that fracas with Theo at Greg’s? They’re both fine. It’s old history now.”
“You—” Ginny sighed deeply and Harry raised his eyes to see her staring at the ceiling and shaking her head slowly. When she looked back at him, her eyes had frozen over. She sounded a bit hysterical when she eventually said, “You make things so

“I’d be honoured,” he said. Although casting basic tailoring charms on Millicent’s outfits for free wasn’t his idea of fun, he knew he hadn’t been a particularly good friend recently. He owed a few charitable acts to keep the peace.
“I thought you were the Ministry’s favourite Auror?” he said. He tried to keep his tone equally blasé as he tried to wrap his head around the thought of
“I’m just saying, he’s up to something,” he said for the hundredth time.

He abandoned any pretence of professionalism and groaned.
She picked up the baguette, its plastic sheath crinkling in her hand, and pointed it threateningly at him as if it were her wand.

He walked back to the funeral, keeping his head down as he crept back to his chair. Thankfully, it was just as the speakers were swapping over, so he didn’t interrupt any touching memories of Madam Malkin. When he sat, Maggie immediately latched on his hand.
“Continuing to do something just because you’ve spent time on it in the past is a stupid reason to do it if you don’t enjoy it.”
He planted himself more firmly and got a better grip of his wand in his pocket, pointing it at the madman through the fabric of his coat. “Get away from my friend. Or I’ll make you regret it.” His tone was empty, emotionless.
“Ambrose just told me about the raid later,” he said without preamble. He didn’t sit, he was too full of jittery energy to be still.
She sneered at him. It was an unpleasant thing to be on the receiving end of. “Maybe because you made his world revolve around you for seven years at school?”
“I know the way out,” he said grumpily.
of his body just to get rid of the sensation. Judging from Draco’s vice-like grip on Harry’s hand, he was going through something similar.
“Have they narrowed down the Keeper yet? I swear to Merlin, if you tell me it’s McLaggen, I’ll scream.”
“We didn’t have a quick catch-up on each other’s lives, Maggie. Potter and I really aren’t friends.”
“Thanks for coming. Um, these are my parents. Mum, Dad, this is Draco — you know, from the shop.”
“Stop,” he ordered, “
He handed it back to the Healer who stuck it in the milky white potion and stirred it around for good measure. Draco looked repulsed, and Harry had to bite his tongue to keep from pointing out that they’d already swapped saliva many times. The Healer halved the potion into the two empty vials and gave one to Harry and one to Draco.
“At least they didn’t find anything,” Blaise said, following Draco.
Harry snorted; the sound was a short, staccato burst of mirthless laughter. “It wouldn’t matter — he’d just assure me that I don’t know what I’m talking about and I
His wand flew from his hand and Potter’s hand flicked out and easily caught it. Draco gritted his teeth and raised his hands slowly, interlocking his fingers and putting his palms on the back of his head. Aurors flocked around him, parting like schools of fish as they began poking around his shop.
Harry wouldn’t be at the forefront of people to jump to the defence of the MLEP: it was even more bureaucratic than the Auror department and any time Harry had dealt with them, he’d spent the next day filling out forms. The officers themselves were widely regarded as being Auror rejects, people who failed out of Auror training or didn’t even get the grades to qualify.
“Sorry, Nott — I should have thought. Here.
… The model twisted in his frame, trying to get a better look at Draco’s sketch. He tried to imagine Potter wearing these robes and snorted aloud. He would probably stand on a hem while trying to dance and rip the delicate fabric.
“It doesn’t matter how he’s acting,” Harry protested, which was a lie. It very much mattered that twice out of the last three times he’d seen Malfoy, they’d ended up kissing and then more. He just didn’t know how to broach the topic with his oldest friends so instead, he said, “I shouldn’t

He dragged his hand downward, revelling in the anticipation. His fingertips grazed his stomach, before dragging through the soft curling hair at the base of his dick. He was painfully hard already, but he didn’t touch himself just yet. Instead, he caressed the inside of his thighs as he brought his other hand up to his nipples, rubbing the pad of his thumb across the sensitive nubs.
“Of course,” she snorted.
They both took a long sip. In the silence, Harry could hear Kreacher banging about in the kitchen two floors below.
“Yeah, have a nice evening. Tell Hermione I say hi.”
He had been entertaining them by pointing out all the wizards who were wearing his robes. When he finally located everyone, he went on to nod at all the dresses Maggie had designed.
This was a dream. It had to be. It was surreal and there wasn’t a single reasonable explanation why Potter was standing on his doorstep in the middle of night, yelling at Draco while he stood with come drying on his stomach from masturbating over explicit fantasies not five minutes ago.
The man snorted. “Yeah right, like I’m going to believe

“I’d worry if you had
“Well you don’t need to worry about it now,” he said, “these robes are horrendously expensive and they’ll keep you open until the end of summer, at least.”
“If you come too, then I’ll wear them,” Harry promised solemnly. He noted the inch of space between the bottom of the trousers and the floor and added, “Though I’ll have to buy new shoes.”
“She’s a traitor,” Draco said promptly. “I was just sulking about the thought that I was spending my every waking hour sewing your bloody robes that you’d probably never pay for.”
Draco hardly ever got to work on mens’ dress robes — especially not ones where he’d have basically free reign. There wouldn’t be a constricting budget put upon him; Potter could afford the nicest fabrics and however many hours of work Draco wanted to invest.
“Ron not here yet?” Belinda asked.
Then Malfoy’s hands cupped his hips briefly to ensure he was going to stay upright, and the blood drained from Harry’s head. His cock twitched.
“Oh, she’s good, I think. I haven’t seen her in a couple of weeks.” Not since the raid, but the silence was already awkward enough.
“I thought I made it perfectly clear that I have absolutely no interest in ever speaking to you again.”
“You don’t get any more experienced than killing You Know Who, Potter. Even if you hadn’t been an exceptional Auror for the last eight years, we would have considered you for the position. As it stands now, you’re the only person we’re considering.”
Draco put his wine down. “I’ll go check the toilets.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. He stared at the floor, unable to meet Kingsley’s gaze. “Any tips?”
“Yeah, that’d be nice,” Harry said weakly, and they walked down the stairs to the main table together, trying to pretend that the entire table wasn’t staring at them.
“Slow asphyxiation because of uncontrollable saliva production,” Neville said, pointing at a blue-tinged fern.
Potter looked over at Weasley. “Reckon Bill could come by?”
“She was a potter, wasn’t she?” Draco ventured, uncertain.
“I’m not going,” he muttered to himself.
She peered around the street with a frown. “Nothing, I’m just surprised. Wouldn’t have thought this was Malfoy’s scene. It’s very… Muggle.”
But when he met her eyes, his scepticism obvious, there wasn’t any hint of deception in her gaze.

Luna launched into an explanation of how Harry should make his chimneys more homely for vampire bats with tips from her magizoologist friend and then Ginny brought them all to tears with the story of how McLaggen had been officially kicked from the England squad.
“I dread to think what your words were,” Draco muttered.
“You okay?”
a lesson — but right now the fact a Muggle could wander in at any moment and see the man blatantly breaching the Statute of Secrecy was probably his greatest strength. He didn’t want him to start throwing curses though, he needed some way to keep him talking while his friends got help.
Harry froze, one hand on the door. “Who told you about that?” he asked.
“Yeah, ‘course. Sorry. I’m just— Uh. One moment.”
She raised an eyebrow.
He tried to assuage her guilt by making light of it. He said, “It’s okay. I won’t be mortally offended if you want to meet up with your midwife for coffee, but it’s definitely weird. Like, if Parkinson ever saw my genitals, I think I’d move to a different country to make sure we never ran into each other again.”
more — “experience.”
“Not really. But if they’re about to lift the curse, then what’s going to happen next?”
Half the table turned to look at them and Draco’s face burned. He was consciously aware of every hair out of place and wrinkle in his shirt.
“I didn’t realise she’d gone into Healing until she turned up at my bedside when I was halfway through labour,” she explained with a high-pitched laugh. “It was quite a shock, but she was wonderful.”
cruel. Besides, I’d be a fool to miss the event of the summer,” he added.
They waved goodbye to the other three as they ducked into a side alley to Apparate back to their homes. Besides their modest country home, Pansy’s parents owned a townhouse in Marylebone which she’d moved into after the war, desperate to forge a new life away from them. It had saved the Slytherins multiple times when they’d drunk too much at Greg’s to Apparate and so stumbled back to Pansy’s instead. The half an hour walk would take at least double that in their intoxicated state — partly because they kept making wrong turns, but mostly because of the godly peri peri chicken Muggle restaurant on the way.
“Fucking hell,” Harry said in the stillness that followed.
“Well, it’d be quite a plot twist if you backed out now…” Harry said, and they looked down at the gold engagement ring on Draco’s finger.
He strode to his bedroom in the dark, not bothering to light the candles. He always forgot to blow them out, and replacing the stubs every week had become too expensive. The moonlight was bright enough to navigate down the dusty hallways.

“How much?”
“Just to the curb,” Hermione said, “Someone from Control of Magical Creatures will pop by this afternoon and take them to re-home.”

“I’ve had better.”
She ignored him. “Tell me what’s up,” she said, tucking her feet under her butt. She appeared completely at home.
“Hear hear,” Millie chimed in.
“Ungrateful girl!” Madam Malkin shouted at the closed door.
but suddenly you’re in my life all the time. Once or twice might be a coincidence, but this” — he gestured at the space between them — “isn’t normal.”
“Need to do the shirt,” Malfoy said, and undid the three buttons on the waistcoat in the same breath. It fell open, and he pulled it from Harry’s shoulders.
Harry cut him off with an eye roll and a kiss. “Not even for me?”
Harry’s jaw tightened, and he tapped his fingers against the edge of his desk. He stood up abruptly, the swift movement making Ambrose jump.
“Arm twenty six,” he narrated, the Quick-Quotes Quill scraping pleasingly across the parchment at the side. He stepped around the box so he stood in front of Potter and tapped his other arm so he could thread the tape measure under his arms and around his chest. “Okay, breathe out…”
“Wonderful,” Robards said with a large, bullish smile. “Well, I thought we’d start off slow and ease you into some of the responsibilities, you know?”
living in Hagrid’s hut, though. Not unless it’s had a deep clean and an extra wing built onto it since the War.”
He arched an eyebrow. “Don’t worry, I’m perfectly fine but thank you for your concern.”
important bit of that sentence. “No, never mind. I don’t care what you do with your life. What do you mean you didn’t know I was here? You said you were looking for me.”
Beating you at Quidditch.
“You never would have been as undignified as this. I’m sure you and Father had a proper courtship,” he murmured, his eyes still shut.
The Minister of Magic smiled and entwined his hands in front of him. “Harry,” he said, his deep voice reassuringly casual. “May I come in?”
“Yeah. Like I said, I go through uniforms a lot.”
“Is that true?”
“I don’t know what I’ll even be allowed to do. I just… When I first got the job, I thought I’d found something I could do forever. I even had these stupid fantasies where people had forgotten about the war and I got to make proper robes — not just quick tailoring charms and selling cufflinks.” He laughed scornfully at his past self’s naivety. The harshness of the sound set off alarm calls from the birds in the nearby trees.
“What?” he asked. “What do you mean
“Whenever you’re ready,” the Healer said from the edge of the room, his wand raised.
“Everything okay, Harry?” he asked.
She rolled her eyes. “Again, I know that already. Why do you think I spent so much time yelling at you?”
“I had a choice and I made it.”
"Malfoy." Harry slowly walked to one of the owls nearest Malfoy, digging around in his bag for the letter. "Is he yours?"
“Go apologize to your friend.” Harry narrowed his eyes at him.
He had come into work this morning with some new ideas for the confidence potion, eager to try them. His plan was to adjust the Draught of Peace with some ingredients from Wit-Sharpening Potion and Elixir to Induce Euphoria. Happy, sharp-tongued, and without anxiety – that sounded like confidence to Draco. He’d considered incorporating some aspects of Felix Felicis, but he was hoping he wouldn’t have to work with such a lengthy and intensive potion. The store hadn't been short on too much product in store, so he'd been able to get started on experimenting earlier than he'd hoped. Draco made a face as the potion turned the color of mud. Even from where he was standing, he could smell it. It wasn't pretty. He sighed as he crossed another idea off his list and emptied the cauldron. It would be necessary to use a lot of ingredients to experiment on dozens – maybe hundreds – of versions of the potion, and some of them were quite expensive. But if they were able to sell a working Confidence Potion, Draco knew they'd get their investment back tenfold.
“I'm still 80% sure this is some kind of trap or trick. But... just in case it's not, thank you, Malfoy. This is... incredible.” Malfoy just smiled politely and nodded at her, disappearing as suddenly as he'd arrived.
“Doing great, thanks!” There was another silence. Draco quietly picked at his roll, but didn't eat anything.
His potion smelled like treacle tart, the wood of a broomstick, and strawberry. It had taken him a while to realize the scent matched Harry's shampoo. He doubted Harry even used anything similar anymore, but it was what he associated with Harry, so it was what he smelled.
“You saw Harry,” Daphne finally said.
“Patil. Patil and Justin.”
Draco quickly sent a note back saying he didn't think he'd be able to make it due to a work event. The call into work was a one-time thing, but there was no reason not to use it as an excuse again. Trying not to think any further about it, he turned back to his potion, cursing when he realized he'd taken more than five minutes.
“About... us fighting?” Draco nodded. “Um... why?”
“Mate, we've just noticed... you've been spending a lot of time watching Malfoy. Studying him. Following him. I know, it's because you're figuring out what he's doing. But...” Ron looked to Hermione.
“It was a button insulting you, but you're welcome, I suppose.”
Draco gulped. His eyes flicked to the lips in front of him. “So,” he whispered, his voice somehow hoarse even though he had barely said anything. “You don't give a damn if I kiss you?”
And then there was Harry. Malfoy hadn't needed to win Harry over, even though Harry was the one Malfoy had hurt the most. Harry came straight out of the war defending Malfoy, pleading for his freedom at his trials and telling anyone who would listen how Malfoy had been forced and Malfoy had saved his life in the war. Harry had insisted that Malfoy had changed, and Harry had been the one to ask them to honor the truce that Malfoy asked for at the beginning of the term. Harry, who had once been convinced that Malfoy was opening the Chamber of Secrets, who had stalked Malfoy and accused him of plotting something evil all of sixth-year, who had recklessly used a spell could have killed Malfoy.
He had barely had any relaxation before he heard the familiar voice.
There had been rumors and gossip for weeks whenever they'd managed to get pictures of Harry alone with Cho, Luna, and virtually any other girl Harry spoke to. There had even been a time they had captured Harry and Hannah together in the minutes Neville went to the bathroom. Once they had tried to claim something about Granger, but the rumor was that Harry had stormed into the Prophet's office, and whatever he said to threaten them worked, because Draco had never seen a second rumor about her.
And so, Harry and his team had free reign to monitor the owls in and out of the Ministry, the offices, and the employees of the Ministry themselves. Draco had been surprised they had let it happen, but what were they going to do? Tell the Savior of the World that they didn't feel comfortable with him making sure they weren't doing anything wrong? How would that have made them look? Goodness only knows what the Prophet would have come up with. No one would be able to trust the Ministry again.
“Look her in the eyes and say you didn't.” Clearly Ginny hadn't been privy to this part of the conversation, but she picked up quickly. Draco took a moment to steady himself before he met Hermione's gaze again.
“Family issue came up. Something about his cousin and accidental magic. I think.”
“Yes, among our 3,000 other ancient books. It took ages to find it – the older ones aren't properly cataloged.”
"They seem… nice." Harry finished tying the letter and let the bird go.
When Ron looked up at Malfoy, he was still frozen in shock. He cleared his throat and shook his head. “Oh, no need. Keep it as long as you like.”
“How was it?”
“You all right, mate?” Ron looked up from his barely touched plate to Harry, who was looking at him in concern. “Something wrong?”
“I don't want to get up. Besides. We never get to fuck in a proper bed.”
Granger was curled up on the couch reading, and Weasley was draped across her. Draco wouldn't have been surprised if he was actually asleep. A random assortment of other Eighth Years were sitting in the group of chairs and couches behind them.
"You sure have been getting a lot of mail, Harry." Harry shrugged as he opened the letter. This one was from Ginny, telling him about her Quidditch training.
He didn’t need to look at Malfoy. It didn’t matter what he was doing. Harry knew what he was doing, anyway – he was eating, and talking to his friends, and reading the Prophet, just like everyone else in the Great Hall. Just like Malfoy had done every single morning since the start of school.
Malfoy rolled his eyes as he stood up and walked over to stand in front of Harry.
, like he was saying something dirty. “You were an arrogant prick, and I was an idiot. You pissed me off on purpose and it worked, and I hated the way you treated me and my friends, and you annoyed me.
“I just... I don't see why you of all people would be interested in me when there are so many better choices. Better for you. People who actually helped you, who were always on your side. You know – good people.” Harry gripped Draco's chin gently and turned him so their faces were even, only a few inches apart.
“Don't flatter him.” Ron opened his mouth to defend his friend, but Harry was laughing, too. Ron slowly closed his mouth. “Besides, he's not going to go pro.” Ginny continued staring at him.
"I can't..." Draco whines brokenly, instantly burying his face into Harry's chest while long, slender fingers grasp tightly at the Gryffindor's shirt. "I can't do it... I can't do this anymore-- I can't--" He chokes out before a sharp sob pulls from his mouth, his body shaking with the force of it all as he lets his hopelessness fill the air. "I just keep failing-- I don't-- I don't know what to do-- Harry-- I can't-- I can't do this... anymore..." Each word his voice grows more and more strained until he's barely able to get out the last few words.

"Your idiot, still, I hope? I can understand if—"
"N-No need! I-I’ll lower them for you, Ms. Parkinson, my apologies. I am but a humble servant of our leader," Alphonse relented with nervous laughter.
How someone could have such a near death experience only to have the same biting cynicism was beyond Harry. Unfortunately for Draco, Harry wouldn’t let something as silly as a
"M’sorry," he whispered weakly to his dream.
They had brought Draco to Malfoy Manor where Narcissa sobbed over her son, crying into his chest while her fingers trembled through his hair. That had broken him enough, but it was what Blaise had whispered to him—purposely making sure that Narcissa wouldn’t hear him—that had Harry excuse himself before he rushed to a bathroom.
Harry stared at it.
"You normally dream of his new favourite puppies?" Harry asked conversationally.
He took the potion and downed it in one go. A grimace followed shortly thereafter before it faded into a far more relieved and relaxed expression. Thank Merlin for Healers and their potions.
"I’ve had worse."
"But I want to apologise. I spent months reassuring you that I believed you, that I trusted you, then the first moment where that belief was challenged … I caved."
"Why can't I do it on my own?" Draco cries out, as if Harry would know the answer, and it shatters the Gryffindor's heart even further. He does not take offense to these words. No, he knows Draco means nothing against him, and life hadn't been particularly kind to Malfoy after the war.
"It’s not your fault," she murmured, and for a moment Harry wanted to ask how she knew, but a new wave of tears stopped him.
cult.
"I love you, Draco.
Even Harry could tell it was a lie, but Draco seemed to accept the answer.
He had stopped because of a comment Ron had made that made Harry increasingly more paranoid the more he had thought about it. It had made him fear what others might think, and more specifically, it had made him fear the idea of never being able to move forward.
"Harry?" Draco croaked hopefully.
and hope that they hadn’t intended to rely on him for anything. Harry simply rested his head against Draco’s chest.
"It’s me — I’m so sorry, Harry—"
Draco’s smirk dropped and his cheeks, ghostly pale though they were, flushed a deep red. It wasn’t the reaction Harry had expected. "Ahhh, heard that did you?" Draco tried to recover some semblance of composure. "No—I don’t, for the record," Draco tried to sound haughty, but it mostly sounded

proud of you. You're one of the brightest people I know, one of the strongest. You are not any less of these things, no matter what other people decide. Okay?"

Draco has broken down before, but he's never gone so far as to mention wishing he were dead, and it has him concerned,
"She’s already adopted you."
limits. What Blaise had not contained, however, was his clear disdain for Harry. Harry had simply figured it was habitual hatred born from their old Hogwarts house rivalry.
Malfoy would be part of it.
"Thank you," she whispered before she fell silent. They stood, embracing each other, for a few moments longer before Narcissa slowly pulled away and lifted a hand, cupping Harry’s cheek. "Leave if you must, but I hope you won’t," she assured before she pulled away to return to Draco’s bedside.
"Harry?" Narcissa murmured as she stepped out into the hall, keeping out of Draco’s line of sight. Harry simply stared at her. He didn’t know what to say.
That was, until he started to wake up and he remembered everything that had happened. His eyes flew open, wide and terrified, and he half-expected to be back in his cell — as if the rescue had simply been a dream.
They met Hermione coming back from the library on their way and corralled her to the Great Hall with them. As they walked, Ron filled Hermione in on the 'situation'. She berated them for invading Harry's privacy and told them to leave him alone.
“I stopped by to see Teddy. He was babysitting.” Daphne gently put her hand on Draco's arm, almost like she was offering her sympathy. Draco was saved from any more annoying questions when his food arrived.
"No… but you've been staring at him. Quite a bit." Harry's flush grew and he started writing something, even if it was just nonsense.
“Ah, would you mind if I-” The student holding it handed him the paper before he'd even finished. Draco gulped. That was not a good sign. His hands were shaking as he grabbed it. A picture of him stared back from the front page. WHAT IS DRACO MALFOY UP TO? HARRY POTTER TELLS ALL. Draco closed his eyes.
Within a month, Draco was moved into Harry's old apartment. With all the paperwork and the process of moving in and out, he saw Harry regularly for two weeks. And then he was officially settled in, and he barely spoke to Harry again until today.
“You barely finished your dinner!”
It probably didn't hurt that Kingsley Shacklebolt had taken over as permanent Minister of Magic. Draco had learned that he had been working with the Order throughout the war. Undoubtedly that meant he had even worked with Harry.
Apparently, Harry had mentioned how talented Draco was at Potions – and intelligent in general – and George threw out the idea of Draco coming to work with him. Draco had not been able to get that out of his mind for weeks – Harry had not only been talking about him, but
knew that. Still, he had to put up some front, didn’t he? His friends were quiet as they tried to figure out what to say.
already gotten her gift for Hermione, and Ron had to figure out his own.
“Sitting in the Great Hall, walking to class, going to Hogsmeade kind of together?”
A large cauldron sat in the middle of the room. The left wall was covered in shelves of the most common ingredients, while the rarer ones were stored in a cabinet in the corner. On the right was a workbench where he created the non-potion items.
“Oh, don't worry. We'll clean it all up.
“That wasn't a realization, git. That's my explanation.” Draco took a deep breath.
“Yes, well.” Draco coughed. “I overheard you lot talking about it. Couldn't exactly be helped, seeing as you were practically yelling in the library.” Ginny did that obnoxious head nod that was somehow sarcastic.
“I wasn't going to. But he asked about something I wanted to talk about.” Hermione's expression fell as she started reading the front page.
In the bedrooms, they were alone. Harry was grinning at him when he entered. “Sorry, I just... I saw that look on Seamus' face and I couldn't. I couldn't give him the satisfaction of knowing it was his meddling that got us together.” Draco chuckled. “If you want, we can tell everyone tomorrow. Now, whenever. But...” Draco quirked an eyebrow. “I thought it might be fun to mess with them for a while.”
Potter over the years – at weddings, and parties, and simply walking the streets of wizarding London. They would share a polite nod or exchange of last names as a greeting. If they wound up at the same event, they would usually end up having a short conversation. But he had not spoken to Potter, not really, in three years.
“Thank Merlin. I was afraid I was going to come in here to some gaudy decorations praising me, or something.” Draco met Granger's eyes pointedly, noting her blushing and turning away.
They held a staring match for a minute, until Harry gave up with a sigh. “Fine. I'll just take care of myself.”
They actually ended up playing two rounds, with both of them winning once. Both were close games. As much as Ron hated to admit it, Malfoy was right; he didn't know of anyone else in Hogwarts who could give him such a challenge. No matter how smart his girlfriend was, she just didn't have the experience with the game to compete with him. They still played regularly, but it was nothing like playing Malfoy.
“Thank you, Draco. That's actually really helpful.” Draco nodded, then took a deep breath.
In the darkness, Draco turned to look at Harry's bed. The bright green eyes were already watching him, easy to see even in the darkness. It was silent, other than some light breathing and Neville's snoring.
He gave her a look like he thought it was obvious.
“No. I'll... I'll talk to my mother. I'll owl you.”
“You know, you’re right. How are you so smart?” Harry asked, shaking his head at the kid at his side. Teddy grinned proudly. He turned back to Draco. “Anyway,
“Well, because he doesn't have confidence in himself, of course. He's doubting himself, despite all he did, because of the people he wasn't able to save and the things that were lost in the war.”
“Erm. What is it?”
could just go back into the Wizarding World and be an upstanding citizen. Is he doing anything... suspicious? Have you seen him hiding anything, talking to anyone outside of Hogwarts? Does he sneak off on his own?” Harry immediately brought the apple away from his face.
"Right. Sorry."
“I heard that you helped Harry Potter babysit on Tuesday.” Draco did everything he could not to flush. For a second, he'd forgotten that his mother talked to her sister several times a week now. They seemed to discuss everything with one another. It was like they’d never been apart. Or perhaps, like they were making up for lost time.
“How nice.”
“Potter.” Harry pulled his eyes away to see his blond roommate pulling a set of robes out of his chest.
That was why they were in the library in the first place. Harry glanced at his friends' parchment. Hermione's looked like it might have been completed and she was re-reading it for any errors. Even Ron had a few paragraphs in his messy scrawl.
Harry subtly glanced at the chair across the fire from him, where Malfoy had one of his textbooks open and was taking notes on a piece of parchment. Immediately aware of eyes on him, Malfoy looked up. Harry asked a question with his eyes and a small head tilt, and Malfoy gave the smallest of nods.
"I haven’t said a single word about him!"
100 times their size, robbed Gringotts, ridden a dragon, snuck in and out of the Ministry without being caught, and defeated the darkest Wizard in history.
doesn't want to be a Quidditch player when they grow up.” Draco smirked as he watched Teddy glare at Harry, but still scoop up every bite and eat it. Harry smiled and ruffled Teddy's hair when he was done.
A few moments later, he was standing in front of the stone path leading up to the Tonk's quaint house. Mother had invited Andromeda and Teddy to live with her in the Manor, but his Aunt had politely declined in favor of staying in her small, one-story home on a popular wizarding street. A few years ago, Draco would have thought her mad. The manor was incredible, beautiful, and full of anything you could ever need.
All the color drained from Draco's face at once. He wouldn't be... no. He'd told Draco. Harry had assured him he wouldn't talk to anyone. Harry had defended him in his trials. Harry was a Golden Boy who had refused to lie even when it resulted in him being
When Teddy's plate was almost empty, he pushed it away and sat back in his chair. Everything was gone but a few bites. Harry raised one eyebrow and looked away from Teddy haughtily.
Blaise and Pansy were sitting across from them in the booth. “No Theo today?” Draco asked, eager to get the attention off himself. Pansy shook her head.
Almost twenty minutes later, Harry walked back into the common room with his three Gryffindor friends in tow. They were all laughing as they entered and continued toward the exit into the castle. Harry stilled when he met Draco's eye, awkwardly biting his lip and nodding at Draco with what he knew to be thanks. Draco nodded back and rolled his eyes as he turned back to his homework once again.
They continued a friendly argument, which Draco contributed to occasionally. They debated whether a fifth-year that was quite good would take the spot of Keeper, or if Akinns would still hold the title. Draco silently marveled at the idea that he was conversationally debating Quidditch with a Ravenclaw and two Gryffindors. Such a difference from where they had been a year ago.
All at once, he knew he had to go back; there was no way he would ignore another chance to spend time with Harry.
Whenever Weasley and Harry were forced to be near each other, they made a dramatic scene of glaring at each other for far too long until one of them stormed away. It was annoying and awkward, and Draco found himself wondering if this is what it had been like when he and Harry constantly fought in earlier years. Draco was certain that two years ago, Granger or Weaselette or one of the other Gryffindors would have bothered Harry to apologize by now. But he saw now what Harry had meant – no one wanted to even
“Yes-huh,” Draco responded. He ignored Potter snorting in amusement. “We did. At school, some of us liked to call each other by our last name. Like if I called you
After Harry disappeared, Draco stood rooted to the spot far longer than he would ever admit.
“That's weird, Hermione. I don't remember you saying anything about it being a quill. Did I miss that?”
“Good game, Ron,” Malfoy said, his voice kind. “Perhaps we can have a rematch again soon?”
“It was the right thing to do. You didn't deserve Azkaban. Neither of you.” Malfoy smiled slightly at him.
“How are you doing today, Malfoy?” Weasley asked conversationally. Draco didn't look up.
Draco looked forward to find the three girls in chairs nearest him staring at him strangely. He immediately cleared the smirk that had lingered.
way, even while being pulled in a million different directions. We looked death in the eye at sixteen years old and came out two normal kids who can go back and finish school. If there is
"Yes. I'm not
“Well then, Harry's sitting right there,” she pointed out quietly. Malfoy laughed. Actually laughed.
“What's going on?” Harry looked from the angry faces to Ron's wand. Hermione gently pushed Ron's hand down.
“Why?”
“You guys aren't even angry anymore. You're smiling at each other when you bicker. You get up in each other's faces. You can feel the attraction coming off of the both of you. It's sickening, really. It's like you don't even care that we're watching.”
Daphne and Pansy started discussing whether it would be better for him to avoid seeing him in the future or go back this week and get some closure. Draco had seen Harry dozens of times over the years, had fully proved to himself that there was no chance Harry would ever return the feelings, and he still hadn't found closure. He had started to think he never would.
“I never said I thought you were doing anything wrong,” he blurted after a moment of weighing his options. “Well, in sixth year I did, but I was right about that.” Malfoy flushed, embarrassed at the memories. “But since the war, I’ve never accused you of anything, never called you out, never indicated I thought you were up to something.”
“Um. Sure.” Malfoy nodded.
“What are you on about?” He looked around the room, but everyone else was either grinning at him, laughing, or looking embarrassed. “I don't flirt with anyone.” It was hard enough for him just to say the word.
nice to them, and it freaked Ron out more than anything the blond had done before.
“How- this is- Oh, my goodness.” Hermione reached out to touch it, like she thought it was a mirage. “This is incredible! I- where did you find it?”
Harry set the paper down beside him and filled his plate, looking over the picture. It was a surprisingly nice picture of Malfoy – he was grinning, maybe even laughing at something one of his friends had said as they walked down the streets of Hogsmeade. There was silence among his friends as Hermione and Ron finished reading the article. He knew they were staring at him, or maybe having a silent conversation about him, but he ignored them and tried to eat his breakfast in peace.
No matter what snide or rude comments Ron made, Malfoy politely ignored them and continued being friendly. After a few weeks, Ron stopped being rude altogether. It wasn't even enjoyable when Malfoy would only be
“Look. Just...” What was it he had said? “Mess with him sometimes. Call him out when he's being a git, like he usually is. Just treat him exactly like you would any of your other friends.” Hermione's nod looked more confident this time.
Because Draco couldn't possibly just have a nice, relaxing evening, the conversation from the other group grew continually louder. They were animatedly discussing how Neville and Hannah needed to just get together already. Apparently, the group had come to the conclusion that the best way for this to happen would be for them to start snogging in the middle of class. The conversation lulled, and Draco vaguely hoped they would talk about something that made them less excited.
, in case you were not aware, means ‘friend’. Blaise reserves it for
The edges of his vision had started to go dark by the time the curse was pulled. From then on, an additional cultist made up his prison guards. It was truly hopeless, wasn’t it?
"I—wh—but—what?" Draco sounded incredulous. "I think between the two of us you’ve nothing to apologise for—
There was an eerie silence. Then, their attacker collapsed with a faint thump.
"Yes, Ms. Parkinson?" Alphonse responded hopefully.
, though I may be thrilled that you found the love of your life, now—" A sharp crackle of lightning erupted from Blaise’s wand. "—is not—" And then another. "—the time!" Blaise snarled just before he dodged out of the way of a sparkling red hex, he followed it up quickly with another blast of crackling lightning.
Harry’s eyes widened as he shook his head adamantly. "No. I’m good — promise — won’t run!" He assured, consumed entirely by anxious dread as he pressed back against the cell wall. He could be good. He wouldn’t leave.
Draco sighed next to him which promptly recaptured Harry’s attention.
were seen as weaknesses. But in the moment, Harry could read just how much Blaise truly loved and adored Draco. Blaise would have scorched the entire damn planet just to find his best friend. Harry wanted to curl up beneath and rock and never come back out.
"A month," Draco answered with slumped shoulders. "Harry, I am so sorry. We had wanted to get you out sooner but those damn zealots." Draco’s voice shifted suddenly, it turned angrier, more vitriolic.
"No, it’s fine. I—It’s just been a long couple of days. I had just hoped that those bullshit beliefs would’ve stopped haunting us, but that was a particularly foolish hope on my part." Draco looked like he wanted to crawl beneath a rock. "I understand why everyone would still think we’re interested—"
Harry listens, his heart breaking for the other man who falls apart in his arms. The utter desolation he hears making him hug Draco even closer to him, burying his face into the blond's hair as he grips him tight. "It's okay... Draco... I'm here... I'm here for you..."
"Draco I—" Harry started but Draco raised a hand to cut him off.
"What did you say?" Narcissa asked.
The first couple of day — at least Harry assumed it had been as long, it was difficult to tell time without seeing outside — passed in a blur of solitude and infrequent meals. Harry choked down as much of it as he could, but the sparsity of food was almost a blessing. Still, he forced himself to eat. He needed sustenance to keep up whatever strength he could. He saved it up, moving as little as possible, trying to calm his mind and hone his magic.
Draco’s answer wasn’t quick.
do this... I believe in you, Draco..." Harry's not sure where the words are coming from, he's not sure if he's saying the right things, but gods he hopes that he is, as he leans down to press a soft kiss to his fiance's forehead. Every part of him wants nothing more than to take the hurt away, but he can't,
Harry wanted to respond, he wanted to say
Draco has had to live with the prejudice of being a Malfoy. A whole world has chosen to vilify him for what was his father's doing, refusing to see past that, refusing to see Draco for who he really is.
"You did well, Draco," the man continued.
Without missing a beat, Narcissa chimed in before an awkward silence could settle. "Blaise, dear, would you mind helping with dinner tonight?"
Before Harry could think to wonder what show, he heard another voice as it wafted through the air. A voice he had once known, though not associated with pleasure. As Blaise and Draco quietly sneaked into the room, Harry’s gaze immediately found the source.
"Right," Draco confirmed resolutely, and, without further commentary, lifted Harry into his arms and moved to rejoin Blaise. All Harry could do was give a soft squeak of surprise, too drained of energy to thrash or fight, even if he had wanted to. He had no choice. He had to trust them. He had to hope this was not some test he would fail.
"—you’ve got a point—but what I mean is that
"Thank you, Potter—" Narcissa’s eyebrow arched. "—Harry—" Blaise corrected.
So they had gone looking, with Blaise barely able to rein in his fury to more
"Absolutely none," Harry mused, though he couldn’t deny that he was curious.
"Why?" Harry asked, and he watched as Draco’s head tilted slightly. The silence stretched until Draco’s eyes darkened suddenly and his lips dropped into a discouraged frown.
" Harry's voice is sharp as he quickly cups Draco's face in his hands, urging his fiance to look at him. He's barely able to keep the lump out of his throat as he looks into the bloodshot eyes of his love, those silver-gray eyes looking so empty. "I know you don't believe it, but you're more important than you know. You're not to blame for the choices of other people. You're bloody brilliant. One of the best at what you do. You've overcome so much-- and I know it's hard to keep fighting, I know, and I wish I could tell you it gets better, but I can't. What I can tell you is that
Then nearly a week later Blaise contacted him.
"Mmmmm," Draco acknowledged tightly, it nearly bordered a growl. "And Hiram?"
"Draco, we have
Harry wanted to be sickened by it, he wanted to feel horrified about the dark curses he witnessed, and the equally grotesque story he just heard. But it was hard to vilify the use of such things when they were employed to help rescue him … to save him. Draco saved him. Pansy saved him. Blaise saved him. His head began to swim.
"What? Why?" Draco asked, clearly startled by the sudden apology.
"No! No—it’s not that, I just—wasn’t expecting that but I think—" Harry paused to take a calming breath. "—I think I would like that, though I wouldn’t mind doing them here until you’re able to go out again," Harry offered with a bright smile.
him. It shattered his heart.
But he had been wrong there, too.
"I can’t promise I won’t fall asleep on you," Draco pointed out. Now that he mentioned it, Draco did look quite tired.
" someone hissed.
They would get through this.
"Let’s get going, Blaise needs to be looked at," Draco stated while his grip on Harry tightened. Harry closed his eyes. The familiar wash of teleportation magics caressed his skin, and then there was nothing. Just sleep that lacked dreams, that lacked nightmares — sleep that finally felt
Harry turned to leave.
"Nothing. Darkness. I—" Draco’s voice cracked. "—I thought—I had believed that I—"
"Honestly, Draco, where do you think we learned how to perfect such flourish?" Pansy followed up, her red painted lips still curved into a hideous smile.
And maybe,
After he had spent his childhood fighting against zealots seeking pureblood supremacy, he now had to fight the opposing side. There had been such vitriolic hate directed his way after Malfoy’s trial.
And it only grew worse as dehydration eventually kicked in. Eventually he stopped being able to sit up, as he couldn’t stop the world from spinning, and he couldn’t stop himself from feeling so incredibly weak.
the man had a point.
meant. In his periphery he watched as Draco slowly looked between the two of them in what Harry could only assume was confusion.
In silence they sat as they doctored their respective cups before sipping at the warm liquid. Each one of them seemed to stare into their cup, as if searching for answers that would never come. Harry felt gutted. Narcissa looked horrible, as if she hadn’t slept since before the war, which could have easily been the truth. And Blaise? For a brief moment, as he sipped his tea, Harry swore he had seen Blaise’s façade crack. He had looked, albeit briefly, absolutely devastated, even
"I know! I—"
"I knew it!" Harry’s voice cracked.
When Malfoy showed up Harry wondered if this would finally be it. Once he was utilised for whatever plan they had, could he finally close his eyes forever? He just wanted it to be done. He just wanted to finally be free of this life that he never fucking asked for.
"Your loyalty is cherished," Pansy purred pleasantly. Slowly she traced a finger along the man’s jawline as he lowered the wards, but it was clear his attention was focused more on Pansy’s touch. "Lovely. Oh, and Alphonse?" Pansy leaned forward, her lips just a breath away from his.
He tried to scream, but he could no longer find the energy to do so as he began to sink into a cold, overwhelming darkness. Was this what death felt like? An isolated cold hollowness that felt like a thousand needles pressed into his skin? Draco hadn’t expected that. He hadn’t known what to expect, really.  It felt…so anticlimactic…he supposed. Then he simply allowed it to overtake him. There was no need to hold on any longer.
All worry and concern drained instantly from Malfoy’s expression, leaving behind a stoic and cold expression that Harry hadn’t seen since they were teenagers. It stung. It stung far more than Harry could have ever anticipated, and he bit along the inside of his lip to stop himself from screaming, from crying. He had been played. Malfoy had taken advantage of his sympathies and twisted them towards his own ends — towards the ends of this
As he looked around, though, his panic began to settle, even if it didn’t evaporate fully. St. Mungo’s? Harry tried to sit up, but when pain suddenly flared throughout his body he decided that lying down sounded far more appealing. Didn’t stop the pained whimper that escaped beyond his lips, though.
closely inspecting Draco’s physical state beyond what was needed to safely apparate them to safety and to getting Draco the Healer he needed.
Footsteps echoed down the hall and caught the attention of the two Slytherins, and they quickly glanced over their shoulders with matching swears.
" it whispered back.
"S’not that," Draco mumbled sleepily.
, Harry thought momentarily with a new-found fondness for the woman.
Somehow.
"If you think—" Blaise grunted from behind them. "—I can’t cast with my other hand—" He sounded
, some called him, so sure of their own beliefs that they refused to listen to the truth. He had figured, if this was what it would be like for him, then it would be far worse for Draco. So, Harry reached out to him for the first four days after the trial, he asked if Draco was doing alright, and each time he could tell Draco lied to him. Harry wished that had been the reason he had stopped reaching out, but the truth was far more pathetic.
Whoever had been carrying him — his new wardens, Harry assumed — finally stopped  and tossed him, rather unceremoniously, into a small and uncomfortable cell. Gone was all the gusto and fury he had originally felt; only exhaustion remained.
As they approached an open door they both stopped to look at each other with wide eyes.
"I—" Draco stopped, and for a moment Harry wondered if he had screwed up too much. "I would prefer it if it were more than just a check in this time—I actually would prefer if it were—" Draco swallowed in what seemed to be nerves. "—I would prefer if maybe we could try a date, once I’m not confined to my bed," Draco admitted. It seemed a near death experience was one way to spur someone into more forward and direct action. Harry simply hadn’t anticipated it.
get some rest, besides, it gives me time to win over your Mother," Harry teased softly. Draco let out a tired snort.
Draco looked like hell. Though the Healer had done a wonderful job, Draco’s eyes were still sunken and his face gaunt. His lips were chapped and he still looked paler than a ghost.
and I—" Draco sighed. "—I didn’t exactly engage. I downplayed a lot because I—" Draco’s jaw tightened, as if what he was about to say was fighting to stay inside. "—because I felt like I deserved punishment. That I didn’t deserve your pity, sympathy, or charity. I—" He looked uncomfortable but he continued forward. "—I had wanted to push you away as a form of self-punishment." Draco looked as if he had tasted something vile, yet there was also a staunch determination that Harry admired.
"Shit. Right. Hold on."
"Come along, then. I will have the house elves set up a dining space here closer to when the food is ready." Narcissa then turned towards Harry. "Do make yourself at home, dear," she mused before she moved and pressed a kiss on the crown of Draco’s head, all while ignoring her son’s half-indignant huff.
to move, let alone
Narcissa seemed to understand. Without warning she reached out and pulled him into a hug. Stunned, Harry simply remained stiff in her embrace (which did not deter her in the slightest), but then he fell apart. He bit along the inside of his lip to dampen the noise of his soft sob as he wrapped his arms around her, clutching at her like one would clutch at their…well…Mother.
Ron and Hermione had warned him, but Malfoy had looked so broken, so lost. Harry opened his mouth to scream in frustration but nothing came out. This was it, wasn’t it? Voldemort may have died, but his horrific beliefs still continued on without him.
, but his tongue felt heavier than lead as once again he stood alone in the hallway. He considered Narcissa’s words. He did. But he couldn’t do it. He couldn’t face—
Blaise’s words flooded back instantly.
Everything became a blur after that. It wasn’t until someone knocked on the door that Harry realised that he was pressed up against one corner of the bathroom with his knees hugged against his chest, and his face wet from sobbing. His chest—his lungs—ached from hyperventilation. He tried to clean himself up, to look presentable, but he clearly failed as when he opened the door Narcissa’s tear streaked face darkened with concern. Blaise stood behind her, his arms folded across his chest, and a menacing glower aimed in Harry’s direction.
And that's when he hears it.
As Blaise passed by, he paused to rest a hand on his shoulder. "Keep an eye on him. He likes to think he’s healed more than he actually is," he warned, smirking when Draco replied with a very vehement "I do not!" To which Blaise and Harry both incredulously shot him matching looks.
"The one and only," Blaise purred. Harry could hear the self-assured smirk. "You should leave a note next time," Blaise teased, and Harry wasn’t sure why, but he felt as if he could read Blaise like an open book. Blaise taunted and was playful, but underneath it there were undertows of concern and absolute terror at the prospect of having nearly lost his best friend.
," Draco breathed as he weakly ran a hand through his hair. "What are the chances I get out of this conversation with some dignity?"
"Yes," Draco answered instantaneously.
"I should have kept checking in with you—I would’ve noticed you were gone sooner, and maybe you wouldn’t have nearly died—it’s only because Narcissa noticed that she contacted Blaise who then contacted me—and we almost were too late and I—"
Harry’s heart sank. Even despite being abandoned, Draco still had thought of him while delirious from starvation and dehydration. A fresh wave of guilt rushed through him as he slowly approached Draco’s bed. Quietly Harry sat on the edge, angled towards Draco. "Would you let me try again?"
A streak of purple suddenly screamed past Draco’s head. Harry watched with horror as the spell slammed into Blaise’s shoulder with a grotesque sound, making him stumble forward with a cry.
Harry felt defeated.
"You’re welcome," Harry managed to say evenly after a brief silence. It nearly crushed him the way Narcissa gave them a soft, proud smile that didn’t reach her eyes. Once again Harry considered excusing himself, and once again, he was unable to as Kreacher appeared. Narcissa moved off to the side to speak with him. Neither Harry nor Blaise had anything more to say to each other, though the air between them felt calmer. A sharp gasp and choked noise from Narcissa had both Harry and Blaise turning towards her, both radiated with concern. She moved quickly as she disappeared up the stairs, leaving Harry to look at Blaise who wore an equally perplexed expression.
"Blaise!" Draco called out in concern before he whirled around to face their aggressor. "
And you are worth it. You've always been worth it. We'll get you something, I promise... I can't promise it'll be comfortable... or easy-- I really wish I could... but... we're going to show them okay? I'm not going to let you fall...
"Draco..." The Gryffindor murmurs softly, heartbrokenly as the sound of Draco's sobs reach him. Quickly Harry strides through the house and up the stairs, quietly entering their bedroom with only a brief pause to allow for the intake of a singular steadying breath. There are no questions asked at first as he climbs into bed, sitting against the headboard before gathering Draco up into his arms, pulling the man against him. "Shhhh, Draco, I'm here..." He soothes as best he can, his fingers trailing along his fiance's back tenderly.
Whatever anger had built up within him came crashing down, betrayal burning hot and bright along the edges of his heart.
," Draco hissed before he ducked out of the way, using  his body to shield Harry from whatever was coming next.
"I’d be happy to help," Blaise answered.
Until then, however, Harry would be there, to watch over, to protect, to defend him, just like he had at the trial, because no one should be forced to fight such prejudice alone.
, he tried to remind himself.
"Wait—did you think they still believed in
? Wait—does that mean—Harry you—" Draco’s voice grew more and more hoarse until he choked on the words. "You helped save me?" He finally whispered, all while stormy-gray eyes focused intently on Harry. A frown followed shortly there after. "And you got hurt in the process…" Draco observed sorrowfully.
, Blaise mouthed despite the fact it should have been obvious. Harry appreciated it. Once the man apparated out of the room Blaise walked in, but Harry couldn’t get his legs to move.
That didn’t make sense. Panic constricted Harry’s chest, terrified of not knowing what the appropriate answer was. If he got it wrong, they would just curse him again. What if it was a trap? What if they were trying to bait him only to have an excuse to torture him again?
"Draco?" Harry wasn’t sure why he felt so surprised. Granted, he was still struggling to get a grip on reality. Part of him feared waking up in that narrow, windowless cell. He shuddered at the thought, so he returned his attention towards Draco. "What are you doing here?"
Harry watched as Draco fell asleep while the words echoed in his mind.
Harry blinked in confusion. "For…what?"
Harry squeaked in surprise when Draco’s lips crashed into his. Relief flooded through him as he returned the kiss.
"Poor doll, I’d heard rumours, but it’s worse than I expected," Pansy said in a softer tone that nearly sounded…
"Yes."
Depression grabbed hold of him and sunk him further into despair. No one cared to look at his swollen wrist. They seemed to have need of him alive, but not necessarily
"Mother, please." The voice was weak, barely able to get the words out, but they could hear it still, even over the way Narcissa sobbed with relieved joy.
Blaise winced. "No. That one’s my fault," he admitted. Draco looked at him in confusion, and Harry followed suit, still confused at suddenly being on Blaise’s good graces. "To be fair, at the time, I thought you
The question sent a pang of guilt tearing through Harry. She shouldn’t be the one to ask that question—he should have been asking her that. "Mrs. Malfoy—" Her lips pursed ever so slightly at that. "—thank you, I’m fine, really you don’t need to worry about me. I should be asking you that," Harry said. Behind her, Blaise arched a brow. For a moment their eyes locked.
," Malfoy purred with wicked derision, the pet name Harry had once attributed with love and warmth now was drenched with cold mockery and contempt. Around him, cultists laughed with ridicule. Harry felt the way his gaze wavered, and it sickened him when Malfoy’s lips curled with vile satisfaction.
"Harry," she murmured with motherly concern. She seemed to hesitate for a moment before she hesitantly reached out to rest a hand on his arm. "Are you alright?" Narcissa asked before she shot a knowing look over her shoulder towards Blaise.
"No, it wasn’t." There was a tone to Draco’s voice that Harry wasn’t able to decipher. Neither Blaise nor Draco seemed to want to linger on the topic, however.
"Huh," Malfoy huffed out with a small tight-lipped frown. "Harry, we need to go, can you stand?"
Then Blaise’s eyes softened and he gave an appreciative nod.
"Blaise?" Draco croaked.
"Draco?" Harry calls out softly as he walks through the front door of Grimmauld Place, the darkness of the house a bit startling given that it was already mid-day. It isn't like Draco to leave the curtains closed when there is natural light to be had, and Harry had just looked at the calendar this morning. Confusion spreads through his eyes as his brows knit together in a quiet concern, something telling him that Draco isn't alright.
." Draco’s voice may have been hoarse and broken, but it seemed to still hold the same power it had when they were younger.
Shock rippled through Harry when his voice disappeared abruptly. He couldn’t even whisper. Quietly he snarled, his teeth clenched while he glared at Malfoy in hateful fury. A cruel, sharp smirk flickered across Malfoy’s lips, and Harry wished they hadn’t bound him from the start — not that it stopped him from trying to lunge forward. He didn’t even make it an inch.  Malfoy seemed to take it as an invitation and stepped closer. When he leaned forward Harry tightened his jaw with stubborn defiance.
As Harry watched Blaise’s back, he noted that while his right arm hung limp at his side, his shoulder hitched upwards as if the muscles were coiled too tight. Guilt suddenly pooled in Harry’s chest. He still had no idea what was going on, all he knew was that once again people were getting injured
. Harry had very nearly excused himself to go home but Blaise broke the silence first.
The voice was familiar.
"Are you alright?" Draco finally asked Blaise, his voice tight with concern.
"Isn’t that what I just said?" Draco drawled. Even weakened and clearly exhausted, Draco still managed to execute a perfect drawl. It was upsetting.
"Thank you," she whispered in relief. Silence settled over them for a few moments before Narcissa looked between him and Blaise with a sad smile and a small sniffle. "Come along, I don’t believe any of us will feel up to eating, but you will at least have some tea," she decided, and neither he nor Blaise had the heart to deny her. Together they walked quietly towards the main living room of the manor where tea already sat ready and waiting for them.
"I’m not sure I like you two being friends," Draco mumbled as he hunkered down into his bed and pillows with a petulant pout. Blaise snorted out a laugh before he followed Narcissa out, leaving Harry and Draco alone.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Yes, we’re good. Besides, we have to be," Draco stated as if it was supposed to be obvious. At Harry’s puzzled look, Draco elaborated further. "
When he had opened his eyes it had come with a roaring headache that pulsed hatefully in his temples. His hand had lifted up to brush along a sharp ache in groggy confusion when Draco had noticed a strange weight and stopped his movement. He simply had stared at it. For seconds. Minutes. Possibly hours. He had stared at the shackle that firmly wrapped around his wrist. It was attached to a chain that anchored to the floor in the centre of the room. Perhaps it had been the headache, or the welt he learned had been throbbing on his forehead, that had him simply accept that this would be his new home for the rest of his life. However long or short that would be.
Any last reserves he might've had were viciously ripped out of him, when a painfully familiar curse exploded like Greek fire inside him.
"Alphonse."
"What? You don’t think I can?" Harry challenged with an arched brow.
"Would’ve been strange if you had been."
their pathetic, cowardly spy.
"Let’s keep moving," Blaise insisted before he took the lead once more.
" Blaise roared with a vicious intensity that chilled Harry down to his core.
"I had to fool them. I had to fool them while knowing that I couldn’t tell you any of this until we were safe—and I wasn’t even sure if it was possible. Hell, it wouldn’t have been possible if not for Blaise and Pansy," Draco admitted.
and nothing had been out of place, nothing had been
Seven days had passed after his trial where Harry’s testimony set him free. Four days that involved constant ridicule and disbelief of those who wished to condemn everyone who had worked alongside Voldemort, regardless of the horrifying pressures and threats they had been subjected to.
It would be at least a week before anyone realised he was missing.
"Sorry, Harry," Blaise relented with a soft sigh, though he wasn’t disingenuous. All Harry could do was nod. His tongue continued to feel heavier than lead.
"What did I say earlier about such nonsense?" Even when spoken softly, her words held a sense of command to them, but not command
. Beneath it all Blaise wasn’t much different from Draco. A kid raised to be prim, proper,
As much as Harry wished he could remain defiant, he found himself unable to; he was tired. He had thought this was all behind him, that it would fade into nothing after Voldemort’s death. He had been foolish to think that. Of course there would be splinter groups.
"Yes, ma’am," Harry agreed softly.
"I don’t mind. You
"I should have kept checking in— Narcissa I’m so sorry," Harry sobbed quietly in order to avoid attracting Draco’s attention.
"He wanted to be a god, so I crucified him like that one muggles love to worship," Pansy supplied with a concerning amount of enthusiasm.
"Am I the only one here who isn’t so needlessly dramatic?" Draco asked with a derisive snort. If Harry had felt less like death he would’ve scoffed. Thankfully, Blaise scoffed in his stead.
. Perhaps he shouldn’t have been surprised, but he was.
he tried to justify.
"Sorry—I just—" Harry stopped. He just
door. There wasn’t even a bucket to use for when he’d inevitably need a bathroom. He could only think of three reasons for such a room: a long stay with maximum discomfort, a short say that would end with his death, or a brief stay until he was moved again.
Draco seemed to age ten years during his explanation. Harry could see the bags that settled underneath those stormy eyes, and the lines that creased once flawless skin. He had never really considered what life must have been like for Draco prior to their abduction.
Whatever anger had built up within him crashed down with a painful display of betrayed fireworks. Memories of each time he had doubted Malfoy’s intentions bubbled suddenly to the surface, and Harry’s heart
"Where did the barrier go?" Draco wondered as he rejoined Blaise in the center of the corridor.
It had taken Draco a while before he dared to look over his new prison. As his eyes traced slowly across the room, he started to feel sick as fear gripped at him slowly. There were no windows, yet the room remained brightly lit—and he would later find that it never dimmed. There were no pieces of furniture or decoration, there wasn’t even a door, at least, not a
He flinched, even when he knew he shouldn’t have. Letting out a pained hiss, he glowered towards the culprit — or rather squinted at the culprit due to a particular lack of glasses.
"Then I heard Harry’s voice asking if I trusted him…"
"Now, now, you can drop the act, Draco," the masked man — the leader of this … cult? … Harry presumed — drawled once again before he stepped forward and offered a hand to Malfoy.
The realisation had him  whimpering softly.
"He’ll be fine. It will take a couple of sessions with the Healers to fully remove the curse, but he’ll regain full use of his arm in no time," Draco reassured. Harry felt relieved at the news, at least.
Perhaps they were stress dreams, or perhaps they were what he wished would happen, but they were strange and vivid. He could hear an old friend’s voice—Blaise, his best friend—but there was also another, this one more fuzzy, but there was something familiar about it. It made Draco think of unruly dark fields filled with an emerald sun. It made him think of a deep red sky with golden yellow clouds. It made him think of
"You’re an absolute idiot," Draco finally declared after a drawn out silence.
it, it wouldn’t matter how. Draco wanted to be punished, he wanted some way to atone for the parts he had played, coerced or not, and now he would finally get what Harry had stolen from him.
For a moment there is silence, and Harry holds a breath, trying to keep his anxiety at bay until a soft noise falls from Draco. It's still broken, it still hurts, but it's calmer as the blond curls up against his chest.
For a moment the two sat in awkward silence until finally Harry spoke up, even though his tongue still felt like it couldn’t move. "I’m sorry."
would’ve assumed betrayal too. You’ve nothing to apologise for—" Draco’s tone very nearly bordered on being shrill before Harry interrupted him.
Gently Narcissa hummed as her fingers brushed along the back of his head in a motherly caress; a mother soothing her child. It nearly broke him even further. "It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known." Narcissa stopped. Harry felt the way she took a deep breath, as if she needed to steady herself. "Because of you…I didn’t have to lose either of my sons," she murmured, her voice cracking with emotion.
"If you’ll have me," Draco finally responded while his cheeks flushed a deep crimson.
It has been years since that god awful war, years since Voldemort finally ceased to be, after terrorizing the wizarding world for so long. Offers and positions came out of the woodwork for Harry, everyone seeking the prestige that would come with successfully hiring the Chosen One. Of course, Harry decided against them all, despising the ridiculous privilege that being a child of prophecy provided. He wanted to be
He hadn’t expected post-war to be as difficult as it had been. Even further, he had
asked Blaise. He had needed to confirm that Blaise trusted him enough to apparate them out.
By guard rotation twenty he had given up entirely. If he was not sleeping, he was pressed against the back wall of his cell, blankly staring at the floor in front of him. He stopped eating all together, except for when his guards deemed it time to force it down his throat. All Harry wanted was to die, and they couldn’t even let him have that.
"Yeah, sorry, I didn’t mean to intrude—" Harry silenced himself the moment Narcissa arched a motherly eyebrow. For a moment he wondered if Narcissa and Molly would’ve made great friends if circumstances had been different. They would have at least bonded over a flawless motherly eyebrow raise that could strike fear in anyone with good sense and survival instinct.
"What is your name?" Pansy cut him off, her tone bored and unamused.
get in the way of responding back in kind.
"Yes?" Draco answered back in obvious confusion.
He stopped paying attention. He no longer counted how many meals he ignored. He no longer noted when his guards would change. When they forced meal replacement potions down his throat he no longer tried to fight them off. There was no point. They had won.
he couldn’t deny. He had never gone hungry in his life.
another two minutes before they realise something is wrong."
. During the first few days, he had tried to find out what his use was, but everyone had been tight lipped. Eventually, he’d figured he could ruin their plans by ending his own life, but they had stopped him — and punished him with yet another round of the Cruciatus curse.
Time passed slowly, but Draco did not pay it any mind as he sat pressed against the wall. Eventually sleep took him, but the pained agony of starvation woke him without mercy. With his legs bent and pulled towards his chest, he wrapped his arms around them. Slowly he rested his forehead against his knees while pained whimpers fell beyond his lips.
As Malfoy’s shoulders sagged, Harry briefly hoped it was all a lie, that Malfoy — Draco — would stand (metaphorically, at least) by his side.
He looked up as the splintered magic rolled across an invisible forcefield. Draco and their attacker looked equally stunned.
"Oh, for fu— move! Potter, you either pay attention to us right now or suffer the consequences," an authoritative voice demanded. It sent a shock of fear through Harry. His vision snapped abruptly into focus and he found himself face to face with Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini.
Ron had convinced him. So Harry stopped. He had thought Draco would be fine. He had figured Draco lying to him was a sign that Draco hadn’t cared for the check ins.
, with too much expectation wrapped around his throat like a noose, where pesky things such as
"You can say no," Draco reassured after a slightly-too-long-pause.
, they had added. That one had stung, yet he had accepted it like a brand on his skin. He had been a coward. It had been to protect his family, but that mattered little to people. Except for Harry. Harry’s words had earned Draco freedom. Then for the first four days after, Harry had checked in on him, and it had perplexed Draco. He couldn’t fathom why Harry cared, but he had grown to like those interactions, but then they had stopped. It had hurt, but Draco had expected such; they hadn’t been friends. So, despite the public’s opinion, he had gone for a walk, and that was all he remembered before it went dark.
“Oh, was she in the library with you?”
When Ron disappeared to the bathrooms, Harry turned to find Hermione watching him. She had that face she always did when she was thinking too hard trying to solve a problem. Her eyes were shining, and Harry thought he could see the slightest indication that she knew perfectly well that wasn't why he followed Malfoy's name on the Marauder's Map every night when he was supposed to be sleeping.
watching." Only when he heard Ron's light snores did he pull the map back out. He traced his hand over the owlery, over the dot that had been there almost every day the past two weeks.
Teddy was happily munching a peanut butter biscuit when they heard the unmistakable sound of someone entering the wards. Draco stepped into the living room to greet his Aunt as she appeared in the doorway.
“Nothing,” Hermione said too quickly.
“Would you shut up? I wasn't saying it like that. I wasn't bragging. I'm saying... you are the only person, probably in the entire world, who would mock me like that. Making fun of my... title,” he finished with a sour look on his face. “You are the only person I know that doesn't treat me like I'm the Savior, like I'm made of glass, that doesn't fawn over me like... Even the Weasleys and my friends, they act like I'm perfect and try to spoil me. They never call me out for stupid things or insult me anymore. Like they think I-I can't handle messing around because I went through so much in the war, but... but you are literally the only person who doesn't give a shit that I'm, that I...”
was the one defending him.
Draco stared at the table for a long time after they had left. Was Hermione saying she wouldn't mind if they – if he and Harry – were together? Was she saying that... that she thought they were a good fit? And what did she mean by, 'Harry wouldn't even be opposed to it?' Did she know how Harry felt, that he might-
“It is.” He lifted it to show the cover. It was the latest in a fiction series about Veelas. Hermione's face genuinely brightened.
that the Chosen One needed to apologize to anyone.
to say. "Well. Um. Thanks." He started to turn, but Malfoy grabbed his shoulder.
It had been years since Draco had last seen Harry Potter. Well, years since he had spoken to him for more than five minutes.
“I don't want to argue with you either,” Harry said softly, after some time. Draco was starting to think maybe his heart situation had nothing to do with the current situation, and he was actually just dying of a heart issue. When Harry bumped his shoulder to his and his heart immediately went haywire again, it was probably coincidence. “Look at us. Agreeing on stuff.” Draco chuckled.
Underneath the letter there were drawings of two creatures. One Teddy had clearly drawn, which was short with strange plates coming up from its spine. The other must have been drawn by Harry. It was much taller with a long neck and a rounded head. Draco studied them for a while, eventually wondering if these were dinosaurs. He'd completely forgotten to ask Harry about those.
“You absolute arsehole!” He yelled, turning around on the couch to throw a wadded up piece of wrapping at him. It fell short. When Draco met his eyes, Harry was still grinning widely. He shook his head as he turned back around, but Draco watched from the corner of his eye as he continued studying the replica of the Potter Stinks button from their fourth year. Eventually, Harry pinned it to the front of his shirt before turning to the next present.
Hell, his friends knew now. What did it matter if Malfoy knew? It wasn’t like he was going to mock Harry or run and tell everyone. That just wasn’t who he was.
He'd kept tabs on Harry, of course. He read the Prophet articles about him and overheard gossip, but assumed little of it was true. The only source of information he mostly trusted was George, but he enjoyed messing with Draco far too much to fully trust him.
“Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing if they figured it out.”
“So, I want to know why. At first I thought you were doing something as absurd as trying to be my... friend, or something. But you don't talk to me or try to be friendly. I don't understand what you're doing.” There was a long moment of silence, and Draco figured he was not going to answer.
. Draco made a face and pulled the cloth tighter around his nose and mouth.
“No, I do mean the broomstick.” For a moment Ginny gaped at him, before narrowing her eyes.
stopped being an idiot.”
“Of course it's going well. It was
“About not wanting to argue. I'm just curious.” Draco flushed and, realizing the weed was as picked apart as it could be, tossed it to his side. He hadn't been playing the stupid muggle game, but he did happen to notice that if he had been, it would have ended on
“You think we're impossible in this world?” Harry hesitated a moment before nodding. Draco grabbed Harry by the wrist to turn him around. His expression was intense when Harry met his eye. “You defeated the darkest wizard in the world. Twice. I managed to make it through the war unscathed, despite him living in my house and looking for a reason to kill me. We were the kingpins of a war a thousand times bigger than us, but we won the war
who can do the impossible, Harry Potter, it's us.”
“Whatever. It’s his business. So, tell us about seeing Harry.” Draco flushed ever so slightly, but figured he could pretend it was from just being out in the biting cold.
“Seriously, Harry. Who gave that to you?” He hesitated, looked back to his parchment, then shrugged. Draco had forgotten what a terrible liar the idiot was.
“Mr. Harry Potter!” Harry didn't hide his annoyance. He opened his eyes to see a well-dressed man he'd never met before. “Wow, what an honor.” He held a hand out and Harry shook it with blatant suspicion.
When Ron turned to say something to Harry, he realized his friend was gone. He turned around to find him at the entrance to the Quidditch Pitch next to Malfoy. Ron narrowed his eyes. The two were talking, and it seemed friendly enough.
“Potter,” Malfoy growled. Harry looked up, his anger turning to confusion.
"Oh." Harry took his time tying the letter to the owl's leg. "You want one? A pet?" Malfoy turned to the owl again and nodded.
Despite everything else changing, his mother had not lost her habit of gossiping about the neighbors and other wizarding families. At least now it was harmless gossip, though. This time, she told him how it was rumored that Neville Longbottom was going to propose to his girlfriend of something like two and a half years, Hannah Abott. Draco wouldn't be surprised if it was true, but he wondered why anyone would know and gossip about it before Neville had actually proposed.
How was he supposed to help that Malfoy was utterly fascinating?
Draco followed him to the bedrooms without another glance at the crowd around him. It would have been more effective if they went in different directions, but Draco didn't have anywhere else to go.
“Just quit the act, would you? It was kind of cute at first, but now we're all just sick of watching you two flirt every damn day, every damn time you see each other.” Draco was too lost to be angry.
“Seamus and Dean. You're always fighting.” Ginny scoffed.
“No, nothing serious.” Harry nodded.
“What if we didn't have to hide every time we wanted to be together?”
Ron tapped his quill against the library table rapidly. Hermione was too absorbed in her new dragon name book to pester Ron into writing his essay, which gave him plenty of time to think about
“But... I didn't see that at your party? I'm certain, because I wrote down every gift and who gave it to you so that you could write thank you cards, which you haven't started, by the way.”
His mother hadn't wanted it, but insisted Draco take it and preserve their family home. After debating and thinking and arguing with himself for days, he'd finally owled Harry and accepted it. He tried to refuse taking it without paying him, but Harry had insisted. “I didn't pay for it. Sirius didn't pay for it. His parents didn't pay for it. It was paid for ages ago by someone I couldn't even name. I don't want anything for it.”
“I'm not going to tell you. They're not going to tell you either. And you're not going to figure it out. Just leave it alone.”
“How is Harry?”
“Are you looking to shag on the Common Room coffee table next?” Harry asked with a grin. Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“You picked fights,” Hermione pointed out. “Insulted me. Couldn't just ask me to the Yule Ball, compliment me, admit you liked me just a little bit. The only reason you did was because you thought we might
The first time Malfoy had tried to apologize to Ron a month into the school year, he'd scoffed and walked out before Malfoy could even really start. Malfoy hadn't even seemed angry or annoyed, rather looked like he thought that was reasonable.
“I meant the other gift.” There was a brief silence. Draco looked over his book to find that they were the only two awake in the room – Weasley, Thomas, and Longbottom had gone to the bathrooms to get ready for bed, Justin and Blaise hadn't come to bed yet, and Ernie was softly snoring.
“That's how I've always shown it, though, isn't it? Since first year. Always had to beat him. Always had to pick a fight. Always had to watch him.” The silence was starting to overwhelm Harry.
Now, Draco found he much preferred the cozy home to the cold, sharp edges of the Manor he'd grown up in. Even without the dreadful memories, it had never been a home. It was a
“I also heard something interesting about you, my dear.”
“They must be some kind of admirer if they go out of their way to get you something that nice and don't even take credit for it.” Draco did not have to look back up to know the idiot was grinning in amusement, still staring at Draco.
” Ron grumbled something unintelligible to his plate of bacon.
His mind had already raced through all the arguments he wanted to use against Harry...
“Right! Right! Right!” Teddy was jumping up and down beside them, yelling. Harry knelt down to be at eye-level.
“I'm going to work.” Draco took the sheet and headed into his workshop.
“I couldn-”
The hand shaking the quill suddenly stopped as Harry reached out and grabbed his hand to hold it still. Ron gave an apologetic look and stopped his frantic movement.
“You don't like me,” Harry eventually said, quietly. Of all the ideas he had come up with in the past few weeks, that was not what Draco had expected to hear.
was heard by everyone. Draco aimlessly stirred his potatoes around his mostly empty plate.
“I don’t know if I ever actually hated you, Draco.” He'd never said the name before, at least not that he could remember. It felt almost
There was plenty of
It occurred to him that, like Harry, he'd done something with his career that no one had considered. But it worked for him. Surprisingly, it had been George that approached him at Teddy's second birthday party at the Burrow.
Draco watched as Harry followed their gaze to the quill he was using. It was designed to look like a snitch. The ink jar was a mostly round golden ball, and the actual quill had two feathers sprouting from it, spread out like wings in motion. It was obvious just by looking at it that it was excellent quality, and no doubt expensive.
Potter blankly looked at his hand, still holding his and Theo’s wands, and frowned for several seconds, as if he’d just been asked to philosophically wrestle with the origins of magic and not give back two small sticks.
It usually made talking to her refreshing but Draco hated the moments when he had to spell it out for her.
“Do you want the gossip or not?”
He stepped up beside the headstones, standing between his parents and putting his hand on each of them. The marble was still cool, a relief against the burning heat of the sun on his fair skin. He clutched them, squeezing tightly for a long moment.
“It’s just basic paperwork,” Robards explained. “Obviously you can’t be signing off reports from the weekend raids that you were involved in so they’re from other teams — you’ll be familiar with the structure. There are a few Wizengamot Disposals that I want you to look over and sign off on.” He misread the distress that was clearly showing on Harry’s face. “Don’t worry Harry, these are all minor cases and I’ll double-check the first ones to make sure you haven’t missed anything. We’ll also have a weekly one-on-one where you can update me on your progress, how does that sound?”
new stylist — I can’t remember her name, it doesn’t matter — but…”
“Was he an arse?” she asked sympathetically.
“Thank you,” Draco murmured.
on Malfoy? Yes, he was gorgeous, but he was arrogant and rude and he would
It dawned on him that Theo had been gone for longer than expected, and he could tell that Pansy had the same thought because she glanced at her watch, frowning.
He’d been vaguely aware of the various investigations going on into Statute of Secrecy Breaches, but they were the sort of cases that constantly ticked by in the background — he hadn’t realised there was anything special about the latest one. There were two separate anonymous tip-offs. Harry could hear the whining tone of voice of the kinds of people who’d written them, busybodies with nothing better to do with their time. They sounded a lot like Aunt Petunia in his head.
“Are you coming tonight?” he asked.
He kept himself busy, filling his time with friends in a way he hadn’t had a chance to in years.
the one showing up in places I always go — Greg’s bar, my work,
Ron blinked at him. “When did that happen?” he asked weakly.
Draco’s jaw tightened because he knew Blaise was right.
It wasn’t too much, but it was still more than he had on him. Gone were the days of carrying Galleons as pocket change: now he was all too aware that payday wasn’t until next week and he needed his remaining handful of Sickles for food. He made a show of pulling his wallet from his pocket and rifling through the clinking coins, trying to hide the fact that most of them were Knuts as he brainstormed plausible excuses.
Harry scowled. “You’re a snob.”
Robards’ lips were clamped in a thin line. He had Harry’s resignation letter in his fist. “I’ll be generous. You can have a week — if you snap out of whatever you’re going through now, I’ll forget this whole business.”
“That’s the deal,” Draco said before Harry could get a word out in protest. “I’ll come if you wear the robes.”
Harry hated the perfunctory small talk that Robards always engaged in before getting to the point of any meeting. It was like he was ticking off a mental list from Personal Resources about how to have a good relationship with your team.
Hermione shot her husband a disapproving side-eye. “Are you sure it’s not just a coincidence? You said it yourself, he hasn’t exactly been acting nefariously when you’ve seen him.”
And yet, as he rested his cheek on his knuckles and stared grumpily down at the automatic reply from MLEP, he couldn’t quash the irritation roiling in his gut. Maybe he should stop changing the topic every time Neville brought up Hannah’s single friend from St. Mungo’s…
It wasn’t enough, she was already fishing her wand out her handbag. Startled, Draco subtly glanced around them.
Hermione put a plate of eggs on toast down in front of him and then climbed onto the bench opposite, reaching out across the table to cover his hand with hers.
“Um.” His mind flashed back to the quiet solitude of the Manor, just the two of them, and he had to force himself to focus on the bright lights in the takeaway, the smell of grease and sticky floors completely unlike the Manor. “Yes. With Malfoy. She asked about how you and Rose were getting on, and said to get in touch if you needed anything.”
Hogwarts.
“Actually,” Maggie interrupted, “Draco just got an enormous order last week for a bespoke set of dress robes for the War Recovery Ball. So I think I’m doing okay, actually.”
“I should go, I have practice first thing in the morning.”
Draco frowned, trying to remember. “It didn’t look like anything. There wasn’t any sound or a flash — that’s why I didn’t cast a Shield Charm before it hit me.”
He waited patiently as Draco yelled in face, which only made Draco angrier. He adjusted his grip on his wand, longing to throw a curse at his
“WHAT?” Draco couldn’t keep his voice quiet and his shout startled a roosting pigeon. It flapped away in a panic of feathers. He could feel eyes on the back of his head and he worked to keep his voice to a more appropriate level. “Are you gate-crashing a funeral you weren’t even invited to?”
“No idea,” he answered, just as quietly.
He stabbed the fabric with his needle and pretended he couldn’t hear them. It served him well in second year when they were constantly squabbling in the common room and driving him up the wall, and he successfully stayed above the fray; maybe it would work again now.
I make!” His voice was too loud and it bounced off the stone walls and tiled floor so it felt for a moment like the whole room was filled with his anger and he was drowning in it.
because you needed to make sure he was okay?”
Harry opened and closed his mouth. Every single person he’d spoken to since he’d quit had asked him that (
“I didn’t mean to do that, I just… Got an urge.”
“Well, um— I guess, I don’t know,” he stammered. “I hadn’t put much thought into it. I’d have expected someone with a bit more” — about
As he’d said, they were full of standard raid logs and crime reports — Harry had filled out hundreds of them himself. He skimmed the first page, a brief summary of an investigation into a forced entrance at Honeydukes: no suspects identified as of yet. At the bottom, there were two dotted lines for the signatures of the Auror and another for their superior in a performance of oversight. He weighed the files in his hand.
“Nothing, don’t worry about it,” Malfoy said smoothly. Harry frowned. He wouldn’t have expected Malfoy to be so charitable to a Muggle.
“Just happened again,” he said to Hermione. “The weird feeling.”
“I promise,” she said, and he believed her.

use this information to humiliate Harry if he ever found out.
“What are you going to do now?” she asked.
The woman approached with their wands in her hand. She stopped a few feet from them and dropped them on the floor.
“Like that?” he asked, three fingers inside of Draco, and then had the nerve to
“Wonderful,” he croaked.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “I think she’s still clinging to the hope that we’ll get back together.”
“Go to Gladrags then.”

Draco grimaced. “Worse, he was
“I think we got most of them, they’re just going to come back though,” Ron said.
The word
To his annoyance, she followed him down the corridors with the air of a security guard escorting a trespasser out.
“They mates of yours?” the Muggle asked. “Weird names.”
She frowned at him for a long moment, squinting at his face with an expression of bemusement. “Who are you?” she snapped.
“Didn’t really give me a choice. He said I don’t have to go to anything else this year — just chuck that on the other one,” he told Ron, who was in the middle of clearing the crap off one of the chairs so he could sit down.
Yet again, he was waiting with nothing he could do — a frustrating limbo where he had no power to move forward. He threw the memo in the general direction of the bin. It was like he was standing on a shore, watching everyone else in his life sail away to new mystery destinations and he didn’t have an invitation.
He sighed, and shook his head.
“Um, nothing yet,” Harry admitted. “I only sent it at the beginning of the week and they take a while to reply to that kind of stuff.”
“I didn’t see her,” Harry said.
Harry blushed. “They were?”
A white coffin covered in a spray of white and pink lilies hovered above the empty ground, suspended by magic. He blinked and was in two places in time: in one, he held Maggie’s hand as she told him a story about her grandma; in the other, he stood alone in a cemetery, levitating his mother’s coffin into the ground as the grey clouds spat at him.
. How is he?” Theo interrupted.
Malfoy sneered. “Yes. They will be. That’s a
“What did Potter want to talk to you about?” Theo asked.
At least he was moving onto the early shift pattern for the next week — he’d been on nights for the last month and the lack of sunlight had started to get to him. Though that was small consolation for the fact that Ron would be going on paternity leave any day now. Not that he wasn’t terrifically excited for his friends, obviously; Ron and Hermione would make wonderful parents and Harry couldn’t wait to meet his godchild, but getting to spend time with Ron was one of the few things that made him look forward to work.
from the collar when Maggie came bounding in, looking even more manic than usual.
I just… decided I was over it.”
When he finally pulled open the front door, the bubble burst immediately.
She smiled down at Rose and the realisation struck Harry that it could have been his child in her arms in the living room at Grimmauld Place. Harry would lounge around in pyjamas (but just the bottoms because Ginny always stole his tops because they both liked how she looked in his too-big clothing) and watch his wife dance around with their child with a smile on his face. Like everything about Ginny, the fantasy was easy to imagine, but it was like turning on a random channel and watching a movie from the middle when you didn’t know the characters or have any attachment to them. It was a nice vignette, but nothing more.
At the front of the queue, the bouncer waved him straight in. Greg vouched for them all in the beginning (something about Muggle ID and not having it) and they were now such reliable regulars that the bar’s bouncers knew all of Greg’s strange friends.
Robards nodded. “Yes, yes — you can go. If you have any questions about any of the paperwork, my door’s always open.”
“I think everyone’s working on side projects to keep them entertained. Robards keeps giving me paperwork so I can’t complain about not being busy.”

“No, we didn’t! We had nothing and, oh gee, would you look at that? We
“Oh.” His cheeks burned, and he stared ahead.
“It’s been a while since we had one of these,” Neville said with a grin.
“I— You—” he stuttered.
“How quickly do you want these done?” he asked.
“Thanks, can’t take credit though,” Harry said, throwing a smile in Draco’s direction.
He wasn’t, but he also had nothing better to do. “I can,” he said and Summoned their mugs from the sewing desks before walking into the small cubby hole that served as a staff kitchen.
“Yeah,” Draco said with a shrug. “Why are
Harry kissed him again through the smile. The smell of barbecuing meat wafted in from the garden and Draco’s stomach gurgled loudly, interrupting them before they could get too distracted by each other.
Robards spoke and Harry’s attention snapped back to the present. “Now, the reason I wanted to have a word… You may have heard rumours that I’m planning on leaving soon?”
Fat lot of good keeping quiet had done this time.

“How… What order do I put all this on?”
“Busy tonight,” Draco noted, watching Greg take the Muggle money and open the till with a few button presses.
“Which of you’s the owner?” he asked, looking between Millie and Pansy.
dark wizards because I didn’t stop to think about the possibility that I might not want to be at war for the rest of my life.”
“Oh no, you don’t get to show your face around here calling me
He thought he felt her watching him, encouraging him to talk.
. Draco banished it to a locked drawer with a scowl and got to his feet as the person knocked again, more insistently.
“Fucking
The cubicle curtain screeched open and Harry shrieked (in a very manly way) and rushed to cover his nearly nude body with his hands. Malfoy’s eyes darted to his red, Snitch-covered pants (a present from Ginny a few years ago) and he smirked.
“Well? How long have I got left?” he asked mournfully.
“No?” Harry said, completely clueless, and Draco wondered how anyone

“Aren’t they in Tibet?” Theo asked. “And, um, deadly?”
“Took you long enough,” she snapped. Behind her were Blaise and Millie. “Come on, we’re going to Greg’s.”
since the raid. Maybe he should get checked out. He hadn’t been hit with anything as far as he knew but, as Hermione was so fond of saying, it was better to be safe than sorry.
Harry frowned. “I dress well,” he objected.
Maggie had once again beaten him to the shop on Monday morning. Before he could comment on the rarity, he noticed the reason why inspecting their stack of fashion magazines in the sewing room — Muggle and wizarding alike — her wrinkled hands clutched behind her back, as if she was afraid of touching anything. Maggie was nowhere to be seen, though a personal Healer in their green-trimmed uniform was making three cups of tea in the cupboard that passed as a kitchen.
“Cool,” Ron repeated, looking pale, and left them.
particular sore point — there were so many in their relationship history, it was hard to keep track.
He’d missed this, he realised. He had given little thought to his old hobbies since the war. They’d all seemed so childish in retrospect: how could he, a criminal, get up on a broom and play a few rounds of Quidditch? He had problems to deal with — actual problems, like the loss of his entire fortune and how to keep up with the crippling reparations payments — and he didn’t have time to be cavorting around on a broomstick. So he’d told himself that he didn’t care about the things that used to make him happy until he believed it.
“Fifteen years of sexual tension finally came to a
“Oh,” Harry said, scratching behind his ear and glancing from side to side awkwardly like an ignorant schoolboy — even though there was no reason he should know tailors’ jargon.
By Monday night, however, the fantasy was wearing thin: the pounding music had given him a headache and if he read any more trite gossip on Z-list celebrities, his soup-like brain was going to fall out of his ears. The dullness of reality had to sink in at some point. His stomach rumbled, and he knew his parents wouldn’t call him for dinner. His friends weren’t on glamorous holidays that were worth owling about. The thought of having enough money to buy even an old Cleansweep was laughable.
Kreacher smiled when he saw Ginny — though with Kreacher, there wasn’t much difference between his smile and a pained grimace. The house-elf had become a big fan of Ginny for some reason Harry never quite understood. He’d been angry at Harry for a full two weeks when they’d broken up and she’d moved back to the Burrow.
To his surprise, Potter
Losing the cloak and the jacket made Harry shiver. Malfoy lifted his arms up, leaving them hanging at ninety degrees to his chest as he fiddled with the armholes in the waistcoat. His hands gripped either side of Harry's ribs and slid down to his waist. Was he imagining the slight squeeze?
Draco closed his eyes slowly. “Merlin save me,” he prayed.
“There’s no ‘weird thing’,” Draco cut in.
A new voice — sharp, Scottish, and very familiar — joined the conversation from behind, making them jump.
“Um, right,” he mumbled. “Should I take this off?” he asked Draco, his hands hovering over his Auror robe.
Malfoy took his elbow and gently guided him around to face the full-length mirror that leaned against the wall between two of the intimidating mannequins.
“Is that woman, by the bar in the lilac, also one of Maggie’s?” Harry asked.
,” he swore.
“Malfoy? What are— Bloody hell.”
Ron snorted. “And you’re going?”
“Not imminently,” he said, “but I’ve talked to the Minister for Magic and we’ve agreed that I should start making preparations. The most important of which, of course, is choosing and training my replacement.”
“Have you heard, Draco? About Neville Longbottom?”
Two people dropped onto the bench across from Draco. He looked up from his plate to see the Weaselette and Granger looking at him. There were only two tables being used in the Great Hall since so few students were there – the Ravenclaws and Slytherins at one, Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs at the other. Different houses would sometimes sit together in the library or the common room, and even hang out. A few that had become friends even sat together in the Great Hall, but not people who could just tolerate each other.
“It's a little small for two people. You'll have to stay close.” Draco smiled at the suggestive look on his face.
do terrible things, not even when your life depended on it. Even if it meant betraying your family.
“Right. Because I'm the only one who doesn't mind insulting you. What a romantic reason.” Harry almost glared at him.
"So?”
“What's that?” Hermione's anger flared back, but Draco answered before she could.
The fire crackled loudly, warming Draco's legs in a very comforting way. He wasn't even pretending to write an essay or anything productive. He was simply taking a break in the common room, comfortable and warm and past full from dinner. Blaise was sitting in the chair across from him doing about the same thing, it seemed.
Harry
It wasn't that Draco disliked the smell of his love potion. Like George had said, he wasn't even sure if that was possible. He hated making them for obvious reasons – one, the potion naturally made him a bit light-headed and giddy. He always left the window and the roof hatch open, but it still affected him more than he would have liked. Two, of course, was who it made him think of.
At just the sight of Harry watching him with an affectionate smile, Draco's heart began it's jumps and flips again. Whenever they decided they'd had their fun teasing their classmates and they eventually went public, Draco knew his heart was in for more than it could probably handle.
“What a shame,” he said as he walked towards the bedrooms, his voice indicating that he didn't find it a shame at all. “Guess I better take a shower before I get my germs on everyone.”
“Oh, just wonderful. We’re reading Agatha Brown’s latest novel.” Draco forced himself to reign in a smirk. Agatha Brown wrote what Draco – and many others – considered trashy romance books. “Everything went well, I take it?”
“See you around.”
“Don't you think...” she hesitated, long enough that he finally broke his concentration to meet her eyes. She took a deep breath and restarted. “Don't you think, perhaps, we should work on our Charms essays?” Harry finally glanced down at the parchment sitting in front of him – completely blank.
bothered him so much he almost didn't eat any more of the candy. He still did, of course. But he'd
“So,” Weasley started up again. This time, Draco felt that whatever she was about to say was the real reason they were here. He steeled himself for something uncomfortable, though he couldn't think of what it could be. “Hermione told me about Harry's birthday party.” His eyebrows furrowed.
was thinking. He'd do a lot to see Harry that happy.
“Act like that. Don't argue or fight at all. Act all stiff and proper and polite with each other.” Draco smirked.
to insult me. I feel like this is the same way you'd treat me if I wasn't the Chosen One, or whatever stupid name you want to pick.”
“You will never forget that I cut you into pieces, that what most people think is my bravery is actually just utter recklessness, that I'm an idiot half the time. You know that I'm a pretty shit student and don't treat my friends as well as I should and can't shut up to save my life if someone pisses me off. You see all of that and don't try to erase it or excuse it, you just accept that as part of me.
Malfoy's blush doubled. “Potter,” he warned.
Three days. It had been three days. Draco sighed when he glanced up and saw Harry staring at the fireplace.
Ron sat straight up again. “What?” Harry tossed the paper back to him. He watched as Ron read over the page again. “But the only one we left off is Malfoy. It's not like it could be...” Harry crunched off another bite, staring Ron down blankly. The color drained from Ron's face. “It's not...” He started again. Harry knew he was hoping Harry would deny it before he had to actually ask the question.
Harry stayed silent and watched, no one around to yell at him or make fun of him for staring for once. Eventually Malfoy must have felt his presence, because he looked up.
Draco felt Daphne's eyes on him the moment he walked into the Three Broomsticks. He tried to ignore the thinking face she was giving him and asked the waitress for a whiskey and some chips.
Draco threw his robes on the hook just inside the door and rolled his sleeves up.
They'd battled a
“Thank you for the present.” Draco looked up from the book he was reading, laying in bed.
He sighed in relief. As long as his girlfriend was lost, too.
. He almost wanted to ask Malfoy to keep saying it, over and over. He wanted to hear Malfoy say it while laughing at a joke, whisper it against his neck, yell it at him in a stupid fight. He wanted all of Malfoy.
Harry stared at a spot just below Malfoy's eye.
He was sitting alone on one of the stone benches outside of Hogwarts, his back against a pillar and his knees pulled to his chest, eating an apple he'd snatched from the Great Hall. His Potions textbook sat on the bench in front of him, abandoned for a while now. Harry had just closed his eyes and relaxed fully when-
"You don’t have an owl?"
“You’re driving me mad.” Harry held back a snort. He was one to talk about driving people mad. “I just- one second I think everything is fine, maybe we're not even enemies anymore. Then you're staring at me from across the room and following me.” Harry flushed slightly. “You're obviously watching me, waiting for me to do wrong, but then when someone asks about just that, you seem... angry at them for even
“You don't have to sound so surprised.” Draco flushed ever so slightly.
and smiles and chatter as they opened a collection of gifts – some very nice Quidditch gloves, a book on obscure plants, some kind of plant that was supposed to change its color to match your mood, plenty of treats of all kinds, and a scarf that apparently the Weasley mother had made. It seemed strange for a gift in the middle of summer, but Potter clearly appreciated it.
“We're waiting,” sing-songed one of the Patils. Draco couldn't for the life of him tell them apart, even with the different robes. He always mixed up which name went with which House. Wait-
“I realized that you were never really the person I’d thought you were – you were never the person your father tried to make you. You were much softer, and kinder, and less judgmental. I testified in your defense because you deserve everyone’s forgiveness. A second chance. I snapped at the reporter for the same reasons. You don't deserve to be seen as a dark Wizard any more than I deserve to be seen as some perfect savior.
