"Oh I'm sorry about your request, Mr Padfoot, but you are going behind the bars. You've been accused of theft,  drug dealing, black mailing, money extortion, p-"
"You're not." Harry said to him. He teeth were clenched and his eyes were sharp. "but it is what we follow. You might not done that in your kingdom, because heaven forbade, your father wasn't in his right mind to tell you that. But here you will follow the proper traditions. You will follow the heirachy." His voice went to near growl by the end, and it wasn't in the tone of same deep voice which Draco had heard last night. He snatched his hand away from the hold, and his eyes pricked with tears he dare not spill. At the time he missed his home dearly. He could speak whatever he could and express his views with full freedom. No one had ever stopped him or called out to him on the way he spoke, and he felt that he talked the smartest out of all.
"Don't do it, please stop or don't stop doing it?" He asked with a growl moving his hips  harder and faster at him. He heard soft whimpers from him and grinned to see his face red and wet with tears, moist pants coming from the bitten mouth, his hair spread out like a halo. He cried aloud every now and then. And Harry felt his cock throb brilliantly at that. "I know you wanna come, Draco." He said raspy feeling the walls clenching around his length. Draco shook his head, his face shivering.
It might have been a few minutes, or hours according to Draco. Potter then pushed him back and twisted him around again as he faced the open window. He could see cars and passing people on the road and towers of other buildings just infront of him. There were people working in the building. Draco was thankful for the fact that the window wasn't floor lengthed and any onlooker would only see his upper half.
My jaw clenched looking at his audacity. "what do you want to explain. That 'Draco, I slipped and fell into a cunt with my dick first. And now I do it every day' ?"
He faced an inner dilemma before he sighed and stood up, sitting beside me. He fiddled with the ring and I had the urge to snatch it from his hands and put it in my ring finger. I sighed.
the right to hold his arm in such a personal grip?). I went to the other side of the bar, so that I could look at both of them clearly. They were talking something and Draco's grey eyes were wide and he kept on nodding his head at whatever Victor told him. They both were sipping on a thick red drink- probably bloody mary. Apart from casual touches and laughs everything went uneventful, mostly. I was about to leave when a huge brunette man, probably taller than me, his arms rippling and the t shirt he wore stretched at his chest, approached them. He said something and Draco shook his head. Victor just looked ahead and sipped on his drink. The man said something again, and (so foolishly) I forgot to cast a extra-hearing spell which we had learnt specifically in 2nd year of Auror training. Draco shook his head again and I saw his lips say a 'No', before he turned ahead and sipped  of his drink in a tight grip. The man grabbed his arm and spun him around sharply. I was about to stand up and punch his ugly mutt of a face, when someone else did that for me.
"When we go to the Atlantic." The horse came to a halt when Draco shuffled terribly. Harry looked into the mercury pools.
Harry hushed her to quiet. "You don't need to worry. No one will know. I promise. And I keep my promise Draco." She nodded her head once. "Do you understand?" The blonde nodded her head too. "Why don't rest for a while. Stay here."
"But still." Ron raked a hand through his hair. There was an uncomfortable silence amongst us for a few minutes, but we all were thinking something. I was about to ask him more questions when Romanak came rushing back to us. At that time I was sure I would have hexed for interrupting me again, but his eyes were wide and excited.
"What is it?" Harry was still scrawling 'Harry James Potter' in a messy way and  had taken out the blue wax and heated it to drip on the parchment.
Her breath almost got caught in her throat when Malfoy opened her eyes to glare at her. "What are you playing at, Potter?" She spat out. In her thirty- two years of existence on earth, she had only heard Malfoy call out her name like that- the 't's with a high raise and a lot of emphasis on 'p', the 'r' being almost silent and there was a certain way Malfoy pronounced the vowels that could never be replicated by anyone.
He went to James' room, finding the former King awake and sitting on the bed. He rushed at him. "my King!" He said, picking at the vials and uncorking them. "you're awake."
When Malfoy left by four in the afternoon, Harry finaly had a chance to glance at the bag he had put in the last drawer of his desk which was spelled with a strong notice-me-not.
But this had confirmed one doubt he had - this Dark Lord could be an undefeatable and immortal being. Hermione was right of him storing his life force in other beings, so as long as they lived he would be there in this world trying to spread corruption of darkness around them. But Harry was glad that he hadn't found all of the spies which he had sent to Ravenclaw. Some had comeback, although anything but scared for their minds and lives. He would never send Draco to such a man. He placed his hand on husband's lean shoulder and shook him slightly. "Draco." Silver eyes blinked repeatedly. "Draco, it'll be fine. We're very close to take him down. Don't worry, your father, your uncle, your friend, your Kingdom- Slytherin, will all be saved. You need to calm down." He said as he could already feel Draco breath heavily and sharply. He rubbed his back and placed a kiss on his cheek and then his neck. "Draco. Love, please. Calm down." He wrapped his arms around him.
“Well you know I nearly broke down and died!” he was close, so damn close, so near and he was just about to spurt his spunk onto his belly.
Draco's lips parted. "Are you a wizard too, Professor?" The man looked over Draco's shoulders before looking down at him with a smile.
He ushered to my side, holding my face in his cold hands. "Draco, babe, you okay?" I didn't answer him, and why was he wearing so many clothes.  I undid the button on his pants and brought them down, swallowing his soft prick in my mouth. I moaned around his girth when I felt him rapidly harden. I searched at his thighs or maybe I did on my own, I don't remember, I remember pulling him down and pushing him on the carpet, capturing his mouth in a wet kiss. I whined when I was pushed back from his lips. "Draco, let's calm down."
Draco narrowed his eyes. "You can fuck off." He gasped aloud when he felt a broad finger slide inside him. His head fell back on the table with a thump, if it was by himself or Potter, he didn't know. And he didn't care.
more than tipsy at the time, but I was not drunk. Probably. The drinks Charmond gave me was quite strong. "Harry!" I called out to him as I stumbled out of the fireplace, dusting myself. He stood up and walked towards me. "you didn't sleep?" I blinked rapidly, to see if he was actually furious or if I was just imagining. Because if he was, that would be brilliant.
His smile was dazzling. "that's great." Charmond leaned in then, his lips touched mine and soon I could feel his tongue in my mouth too. He was ... good at it,
"A guardian of a student." Draco didn't know himself why he didn't want Theo to know about Potter making contact. But it might have to do with what words Potter departed with. It felt intimate and personal, and Draco felt as if it might be a sort of betrayal to Theo's and his relationship. He looked to the side.
"My laws." Thank Merlin, my voice came out normal and he had the audacity to snort.  "and you will shut up, otherwise I swear on your cock Harry, I will surgically remove your  testicals and feed them to you. And you know I am capable of doing such." He gulped, and my eyes shone. "Now, you're a moron. A fucking moron. An imbecile who doesn't even realise in how much agony have I been in past few months-"
He was then made to lean back when Harry rose to sit up straight on the desk. Harry grinned. "I just love seeing you on me- naked. And wanton." He nipped at his neck and could already see series of red marks on pale neck and chest.
Harry looked at him angrily, then his brows furrowed, he adjusted his glasses. "Charlie! What the fuck?" If I wasn't in the situation at the time, I would have told Harry to use some more vocabulary. Three days and he only used three particular words in mostly all of his sentences - 'the' , ' what' , and 'fuck'. But wait ... did he say Charlie?
Harry wanted to say that he would find out how everyone in wizarding world is doing, if Draco begged like that. He smiled at the pale man and nodded his head. He didn't say anything and went for the door. He was given a small short smile before the door closed. Harry took the steps to the staircase, putting his box lightly by the railing, came back to the door. His length throbbed wildly, he could hear silent chirps of cricket and a faint noise of jazz which Draco or his neighbours were probably playing. He unzipped his trousers, gripping his length and rolled his eyes. He could see the pleading face of Draco behind his eyelids, the long column of his pale neck, the slight redness on his cheeks. He pulled his length back few times and he came onto the wooden door, and it was too much than the previous day. The letter window was covered completely with thickness and  a few long streams drooled down to touch the plastic doormat saying 'Warm Welcome'.
Harry had wanted to say 'Yes,' just to end an uncomfortable conversation. But a few days in the court and talking with stern ministers had increased his patience. "No. Draco." He said. "I had wanted to have a further, an extended speak with you." Silver eyes blinked once, as if saying him to continue. He took the acknowledgement. "Are you well?" He was given a nod. "Draco, please come back to our rooms. I plead of you." Draco looked to the side, the outside view of gardens feeling much more appealing than ever. "From a husband to another husband."
"Or else?" Harry had his jaw clenched, thinking that the other was threatening him with convincing words. He stepped towards him. "or else what?"
"And you got drunk." He nodded his head and took another bite. I took in a deep breath. "Well I'm glad you found your way back even while drunk, on your own."
"Please, please, please, please..." The blonde had a chant of sort on her lips, her eyes squeezed shut tight. She might not know what she wanted but Harry did- that too perfectly. The raven breathed hard against her wet skin and licked and lapped and kissed at the point where her fingers met her heat. She herself was dripping wet, but the only relief she gave herself was to grind herself against the sheets through the sweatpants. One of her fantasies had her grind her own pussy against Draco's, till they both came simultaneously: but she knew this wasn't possible right now - especially in current situation, where it was so hard to let Draco be consistently moist through out.
"I have been busy and You think I'm not giving you enough attention and you go out there searching  for someone to-"
On his way to work in the morning, Harry dropped by Neville's to grab a bouquet of white orchids. To say that the larger man was surprised would be an understatement. "Now, who is Harry Potter giving these?" He said when he tied a green ribbon around the stems and casted a strong statis charm on them.
He raked his large hand into the soft mane of blonde hair. "You nymph. Did you seduce that mad man such way too?" It was evil, Harry knew, but he couldn't help himself. He regretted the moment Draco's silver eyes were hurt and a frown etched onto his face.
"What am I playing at? What are you even talking about?" Harry folded her arms, taking in the threatening stance which she took during interrogation, but she made sure to tone it down by a high percentage. Malfoy shifted in her place, but she didn't back down.
The boy seemed to be shaking as he spoke. "There's a non magic performing division in the naval force of Muggle military. They have been telling us about it since almost the beginning." We both sighed.
When he woke up to a cool cloth on his head. He groaned when he opened his and saw a stern looking Harry. He forced himself to a sitting position but Hermione gushed over him. "Are you alright now? I checked for fever or flu, but it wasn't that."
Blaise stepped forward, bowing before the king as he spoke. "we thank for your kind welcome, King James, but I'm afraid Pansy and I would have to leave immediately. Our duty was to escort Prince Draco to Gryffindor. We must return back as quick as possible to avoid any sort of suspicion created and targeted towards us. The Dark Lord mustn't smell any disturbance cause." He stood up straight and went back to his original position.
She gave me a pitiful smile. "He really doesn't want to see you. You can try though." She pushed open the door and let me in and I gladly accepted the warmth of her house. "He's in the second room on the first floor. Near the painting of a brat swinging with her skirt high." I nodded before leading myself to the room.
Coming back to right now, it was fifteen minutes to two in the morning and my blonde husband was still not home. I had tried calling Pansy, her floo answered with a loud bark of a dog and blasting of a machine probably through the telly. She said he wasn't with him. Blaise was next, and he said no too. I hesitated, and I was about to call Goyle, when the floo blasted. Draco stumbled in, dusting his clothes before he fell onto me, on the armchair. If it wasn't for me holding onto his weight I was sure I would have fallen back and hit my head with a blonde mess on my chest. "Harrrrrrrrrrrrrry!" He was clearly drunk and pissed right now.
Draco slapped his hand away. "Don't call me your Dove. You filthy, son of a bitch! You have no right to." The Dark Lord tutted at him.
"Yeah. Oh god, you've never been here, have you?" She let out a hearty chuckle, where I felt there was no need of it. "We have themes in this pub, like every second Wednesday of the month. So today it is that even if you have a partner you can flirt around, talk or maybe even go home with a stranger. And your partner can't say anything about it, they'd do it too. Richie, my husband, and I are sort of into this, and we're trying this kink out. And we guessed we wouldn't feel guilty if we did it with other people who are sort of cheating, but not exactly cheating, on our partners. This could become a normal norm in supposedly fifteen years from now, but it's so scandalous right now. But still- last month it was Blood Play night. Richie and I participated too, but we used fake blood." I zoned her out after she had said 'go home with a stranger', all I could see was her mouth opening and closing rapidly, with her eyes lolling around. I was just not angry, I was furious. No way Draco was planning to cheat on me with some stranger, just because some random club said that anything that happens tonight is not wrong. I quickly turned away and walked to the bar, ordering a straight rum and downing it hard and fast. A few people had approached me but I ignored them.
He said something in his mind and grinned when he saw the brunette leave from the door and walk down to a nearby store. He got a red bottle from there and then a few small silver packets, smoked a cigarette and then moved back to the flat. He didn't knock though. He pulled down his trousers to his ankles and grabbed his half hard prick and then jerking it in a fast motion. He banged his head on the door as he moaned, Harry could hear it from where he was standing, and then the door opened in a hesitant motion. Harry saw Draco gasp, his grey eyes widened. His mouth then screwed up as he pulled a few curses, before punching the man straight on his jaw, but the man didn't stop jerking and didn't even falter from the punch. Instead he grinned wildly and Draco took a step back before rushing in and closing the door with a loud bang.
"Isn't that your Uncle's bird? What happened to it?" Draco didn't answer him. Instead, he searched through the drawers of his nightstand and leaned back on the bed with a white vial. He uncorked it and poured out some of the yellow powder which was in it on the bird's head and then to its bloody claws.
"Of course he is. That's why I sent two groups with you, yet only you came back uninjured." Draco had wanted to say that his arse had hurt all day, yesterday, because of how hard Padfoot had pounded into him; but then decided against it. Roberts sighed and gave him a manila envelope.
"Cause I can. And I think I love you. Your face, your tears, your attitude, you happy and mostly- you crying. I love you. I love you Draco." He bent down to leave a small kiss on wet lips. He smiled at him. But Draco then pushed at his chest. He frowned upon at that, but the weak push felt a lot to him. Draco then pushed him hard, slapping at his chest. Harry moved back.
"You don't know how hard it is." Draco leaned back to face her and Harry met her grey gaze with her green one. "To accept the sin, the misdeed which I have done. Not only have I gone behind Astor's back and..." Harry stopped herself from winching when she saw a fat tear roll down the pink cheek. "But with a woman that too. And I have Scorpius to think of. And my family. What would the society say! It would cause such a scandal. What would-"
"Who do you think the man is though? Comparing him with batman and all. He should be filthy rich, good looking, sort of agenda in his mind with-"
He nuzzled other's neck. "of course you don't." Draco dragged him to the bed before pushing him back first. Harry was amused to find the lithe body crawl on his and a small wet mouth suck at his neck. The pale hands touched him everywhere on his torso, rubbing at his arms and the mouth found his and he moved his tongue with the other in a slow manner. His hands slipped into the other's pants and grabbed the smooth arse in a tight hold making Draco moan in his mouth. He felt himself harden and Draco was hard too. He pulled his own pants down before pulling the others. Harry grabbed both of their lengths and pumped them together. He heard Draco groan on top of him, pale hands grabbing onto the broad shoulders and pink lip grabbed tightly by the teeth of the same mouth. Harry wanted to snatch the abused lip with his own teeth, so he did so, nibbling on the swollen lips.
“Oh! Darling” he shrieked when a finger slipped into his fresh wound and merlin it hurt more than crucio- he knew how both felt like. Fortunately, the redhead halted his movements when a sharp voice echoed through the room. “George!” he turned his head to the left, from the stairways a man stepped down slowly- he was blurry to see and all he could make out was outline of black robes. “You’re not supposed to touch her.”
"You should sleep some more, Draco." She said, rubbing her hand on his bare shoulder. "He's just worried. He has a lot on his mind. Excuse him, please." He shook his head and looked at her with a smile.
"Nothing, just- stuff." Ron didn't pry any further. We talked about the case, then Quidditch, and then the ministry.
"I don't care!" Draco yelled. "I would hope for you to understand the importance and need of physical attachment I need right now- which you don't, but you will not interfere." He looked back at the Wizard with a pout. "Can't this issue of yours wait just a bit longer?" He blinked rapidly.
"Master, my Lord." Draco looked towards the heavy and harsh origin to see a big wolf, with its fur bloody, dirty and grey, eyes yellow and dangerous teeth. The wolf bowed down deeply till its head touched the ground. It looked dangerous even in a submissive stance, he couldn't help but shiver in fear and wrap a hand around his abdomen.  Draco could make out a black skull surrounded by a snake on its  forward left limb.
"Only cause he was." Ron shoved a large piece of apple in his mouth. "Wait- why are you taking his side? I thought you hated him."
"She can learn. She is a fast learner. And a good student. Aren't you Rosie?" She nodded her head, looking fiercely at Malfoy.
He looked at his side and could see the gun on the side of the table. He had to move them, Harry decided. He was brought back to attention when Draco kissed him on his mouth, this time slow and deep. He removed his fingers and pushed Draco down from the table to his feet. Draco whined loudly, but before he could realise what was happening, Harry stood up too, kissing him until they reached the leather couch. He pushed the pale man down to lay, his hands running down alabaster chest, pinching at the red nipples before rubbing them. He kissed at the neck before mouthing at the nub of the nipples and then biting them lightly.
wrong with me. But Astor is the only person I have had sex with, and I don't really know anyone who would want to do it with me." Harry could see pink envelope her cheeks and Draco casted her look downwards. "And I don't want to pay for sex." Harry nodded her head dumbly.
"Harry." He moaned. "Please. C'mon, I know you want to, too." Before his hand could touch my crotch, I grabbed onto his wrist. I must have done it with too much strength cause he whimpered.
"That goes for all of you." Hermione looked at the blonde as he walked back in a swaying moment towards the man on the podium. She knew something was up but she had to make sure. She looked at Harry and he have her a blink of acknowledgement, she sighed then. She patted Ron's thigh and looked at him as if conversing with him with her eyes and not words. He seemed to understand and Harry let out a sigh of relief. It was a matter of seconds when everyone knew what was actually happening. They just waited for the right moment at the right time.
So that night Harry did sleep on the bedroom floor, he was red eyed and achy all through the morning and he even came back home in foul mood. I made it up to him- I joined him in his late night shower and sucked him off, I owed him that and I could complete my side of the bargain. Well, he didn't let it balances, because just after that he fingered me raw as he held me in his arms against the bathroom wall tiles. That made my back achy the next day. He only slept on the floor for one week though, and the very next day he proposed me with a ring with a  diamond as big as a snitch. How could I even say no?
"I want to look amazing!" I rolled my eyes and summoned my lip tube, applying a generous layer on my lips. "is it fine now?" I give a bright smile to him and he gives a stiff nod. "Okay, I'll be off now. Pansy would be already pissed. I was waiting for you, and you were quite late." He had the audacity to look bashful. I give him a quick peck on his lips, a slight gloss rubbing off on his mouth. "Ta!"
"I heard alright. Rubbing it, long and big?" Harry was seething. "and you're sitting on his lap!" Well, look what the luck brought into my lap. I couldn't thank Merlin above any more. But the suckers made me wince again.
"Officer Malfoy!" Draco winced as he turned around to face the department head, Roberts, approach him with a stoic face. It had been a day and his back still hurt everytime he turned around swiftly or sat on something hard like a soft wooden chair of his office. He clearly didn't have the mood to talk to anyone but work calls are important.
Draco rolled his eyes from shelf to shelf. "You live here?" The old man nodded his head. "What is your name?"
"I didn't even hit you." A broad hand wrapped around his small of the back, fingers lightly scratching the shirt. "I am just ... Caressing you." His hand went down further, to squeeze the swell of the ass. "gropping you." He whispered in Draco's ear.
"I'm Draco Malfoy. This my good friend Pansy Parkinson, and here is Unspeakable Z. And I would be Mr Harry Potter's boyfriend." She took a huge gulp.
Harry groaned when he was picked up by his shoulders and dropped on to the dirty carpet of the throne room again. He was weaponless and tired, and bruised as well- the soldiers who had brought him where he was now had kicked him on the way to here, he would have thought that his ribs might be broken if he weren't able to sit upright with just a little groan. He didn't fight back, he knew just from looking at their plain black eyes that they were under influence. Even if he could kill them, he wouldn't- he wasn't the one to kill innocent and naïve members of society.  His knees ached. Then he heard voices of groans of his friends, all of them lined right at the corner of the room. Ron and Hermione were huddle to each other as Ron protected Hermione from a few blows aimed at her. Neville was in between the Weasley twins, and right behind him was Bill. Ginny's head had blood running through it, it looked old though as it was dark and thick. He tried to call out to them but as soon as he opened his mouth his temple was hit hard by the end of the handle of a sword, making him cry out. He didn't have to wait a long time though. From the side of the hall emerged one man he hated with all his guts. "I apologize for the pain you have to suffer, young King. I'm sure your agony would soon to extinguished whether that be physical or emotional." He let out a long and in fluttered Draco, in another blue satin garb which was much more revealing than the previous one, wrapping his naked arms around the evil man's torso and batting his eyes at all of them. He turned to look at his peers and glared at them, all of them lowered their eyes except Ron and Ginny. "Your so called husband wants that too, don't you my love?" Draco grinned up at him, batting his eyes as he brought his mouth to kiss at the sickly white pale cheek. Harry looked away in disgust. Even while he knew it was false, his guts clenched by seeing the man he loved embrace and kiss another man- a mad one there too.
"Shut it, Ron!" He said seriously, all his humour vanishing. "He was tried, and he came out innocent. He paid for what he was made to do. We all know he wasn't at fault. I was there, you were there."
Draco couldn't see the eyes, as they were covered by some white screen, but he could feel a strong gaze on him. "Is that so?" He then looked back at the scruffy man and kicked him on his ribs, Draco heard a crunch. "Get out of here!" He then looked at the young boy. "You too. You don't want detention, for being so late. Mcgonall isn't that forgiving." The boy managed a low 'how did you?' before he ran away when the loud clock chimed to ten.  The man in the black cape held out his hand and a sleek black broom hit his palm. Draco had never seen such a model before, it looked quite advanced. It had more bristles and was longer- much longer than any had he ever seen. The man jumped on the broom and was about to leave when Draco called out.
"I just need coffee, that's it." He took his tanned hand and rubbed it at his nape. "Here let me help with those." Before Draco could even protest, Potter had his heavy sack of paints and pots in his own arms. Draco grabbed hold of Prince and led them down the pathway. He peeked back to see Potter looking at him, when they reached a small, old building. Draco mentally shook his head and climbed up the flight of stairs, three storeys, then turned to the door on the right-hand side. He whispered the ward spells before slipping in the key. "This looks cosy." Potter said out loud, looking around his small apartment. There were a few clothes on his couch and a few leftovers on the coffee table- Potter must have seen it, Draco hurried to slip his wand out and spell them to fly them in their respective places.
Draco keened in. "Fuh ume hāad." Potter pushed in his finger, another one joining in his mouth at the same time. "
They might have gone astray in distress, because the path became smaller and filled with grass, and the trees came to be closer and fuller. No one remembered to bring in a compass in a hurry, not even Hermione. That's when they a heard a rustling coming from far left. All of them sheathed out their swords, the Weasley brothers and Neville even jumped down their horses, as they slowly and cautiously approached the sound. They all stayed quiet not even letting out their breathes.
"Please." She begged. "Don't. Don't be sarcastic now. You don't know how hard it is for me. You're here and you don't know what all I want to do to you, but what I can- it’s a boon, anyway." Harry brought her hand to brush a lock of blonde hair from her face. "I do. I do fancy you. But don't ask since when, I don't know myself. I see you walk in every morning and think to myself that I should tell you how just the sight of you brightens up my day and I love it when you edit my ledgers with that flamingo feather quill of yours. I always look forward for the weekends because there might be a chance of us eating at that expensive restaurant you like. I- " her vision turned blurry and before she knew it Harry felt a tear roll down her cheek and fall down her jaw to Draco's pale bosom making her flinch. "I like you, so much." She whispered. She leaned in to the touch and thanked every god out there when Draco cupped her cheek and wiped the cry away. Harry blinked rapidly to clear her eyes of any stray tears and she was met with a strong silver gaze.
"I'll be with Pansy. She is still upset." Pansy was quite happy actually, she sold those pieces and got her self a ruby necklace. "She needs my support." His face was stiff and his eyes were wide and I was content. "I'll go for the movie sometime else. Why don't you take someone with you, Weasel or Granger or maybe that secretary of yours. She would enjoy it too." I know, it was a nice ,harsh blow, wasn't it?
He should have paid more attention though, because by the coming Tuesday, while he was in a hurry to get to his potions lecture someone pulled him by his arm into an abandoned alcove. Draco tried to scream but only to find out that his lips were slammed shut with a heavy palm. Draco looked at Potter with wide eyes, while he was shushed with a harsh whisper. “I heard a few rumors, Malfoy. Now I want to know the truth- because what you have said to me before and what I have been hearing around, right now- sort of contradicts the situation.” Draco waited, breathing heavily over the abusing wrist. He was frightened, he wouldn’t lie about it; because even if Potter was this close to him and it seemed as if Merlin and Salazar above were finally granting him a boon, he couldn’t help but shiver in panic as he saw a mad glint in the burning eyes. “So, the situation is that you said you like me, but I’ve been told by someone that you took it in your arse.” Draco struggled against the hold, when Potter didn’t let go of him, he bit hard at the skin. The raven let out a yelp and skipped back. Draco wiped his lips and scowled in return.
"Are you on the menu?" He chuckled  and made himself comfortable on the couch. "Nah I'm fine. Come sit beside me!" He patted on the space beside him. He was way too comfortable in someone else's house for my liking but I let it slide. One fault wouldn't reduce the charm. I brought a bottle of firewhiskey and sat it on the table.
I turned around, knowing that Pansy and Blaise did the same not before sending a smile to Robards and Weasley. I paused by the doors to look back. "Harry, you're sleeping on the floor for one month." I could hear Weasel's snicker as we exited the hall.
"Me too." I groaned out and grabbed at his arse, pulling at his trousers. He smelt like antiseptic potions and his skin tasted of sweat when I ran my tongue against his jaw- all of it was such a turn on. "I wanna fuck you." He gasped and he rubbed himself against me.
THANK YOU for reading this. i love these two fools so much. yes, harry is a bit foolhardy in this fic and draco is sorta vain- harry's pov was very difficult to write for me, draco's was much easier, and more of the challenge was to differentiate their povs, beacuse i didn't want similar writing patterns  for them.
Draco opened his mouth to say further, but then wisely shut his mouth. He thought for a while. "I wish to retire." He murmured.
And I'm going update chapters as soon as I write, cause I'm not taking risks again. So the updates might happen, henceforth, in an interval of five to nine days.
He straightened at the wall he was leaning on. "Fine! I'll go then." He strode past me and took (not a pinch) a handful of floo powder and threw it into the fireplace which roared in green flames. He shouted Parkinson Palace and even in a night shirt and boxers it felt like a  dramatic exit. I regretted the moment he grabbed the powder, but I couldn't do anything but stand like a fool. I punched that glass window pane in anger, shattering it to pieces and cutting my hand in process.
"He just wanted coffee." Draco said with a quivering voice. His eyes were shut and he hid himself in Theo's shoulder. The pressure on his back turned gentle and loving, and the hand started caressing him. He sighed in turn.
There was a growl against his skin. "I don't care." The tongue resumed the the torture at his entrance drawing scandalous gasps out of him. It jabbed in him sharply with wet licks at the opening. Harry kept his legs on his each of his shoulders and Draco was bent in almost half. He hadn't imagined in his whole life that he would be in such a position with his arse up in the air. His hands wandered down to grab the raven hair, but he himself didn't know if he did that to push his husband away or pull him closer. And then he felt a finger probing along with the tongue, he gasped loudly when it went in a terribly slow manner. "Is that okay?" Draco could only nod his head, not trusting his voice. "Draco?" He could only whimper in reply. He glared when Harry chuckled against his skin and he pulled at his hair sharply. "That's alright." Harry moved his finger inside of him before asking him again if that was okay. Draco didn't reply, he could only nod his head. He slid another digit in him, and before Draco could react, the fingers started scissoring him in very slow motion, opening him in a tedious manner. "I'm quite enjoying the sounds you're making right now." Another digit slid in him, not stopping with the crossing motion.
"I suppose not!" They all turned to face Hermione, who was coming out of the bushes she was pushed into by Harry. Her hair had grass and dried leaves but she didn't care one bit as she ran towards Ron. He picked her up and they both met each other with a kiss. They pulled back when they heard Ginny and Fred make gagging noises. "grow up, would you guys?" She rolled her eyes.
It shrieked aloud and from the side a flock of birds flew from the trees. "Filthy girl!" It moaned in an unnatural voice. A bit of blood rolled down its mouth.
Draco moved in with Mathew. It was awkward between them for a week, and Draco had to convince him that he had actually been hypnotised by the deliveryman. After the event with Potter, Draco had washed himself up thoroughly with steaming water and went out to get fresh air where he found Mathew near the stair case. He treated him but didn't really tell him what happened. It had been a month and Draco was getting accustomed with his life. He changed his waiter's job to a different restaurant and even though it didn't pay him like it did with previous one, it was enough. Mathew was a good roommate. He also didn't ask him questions about his weird plants. Thinking of that Draco had planted the plant which Potter had given him in nearby woods and donated the book to a very old and shabby bookstore.
"Don't fucking hesitate. You were amazing at this." She pushed me heavily and I stumbled again before glaring at her. "Shoo off, and make me proud." She pushed me again and walked to the dance floor. I looked at her and then looked at the man. He was still staring at me and that made me gulp. Unpracticed habits can make us do that. I took in a deep breath and walked to him. I flashed him a toothy smile before sitting on the stool next to him.
Harry felt a sharp spike of temper in her, and she pushed Malfoy back to the opposite wall, crowding her space as she put her palms on either side of her face. She clenched  her jaw. "You better not call me names in my own house Malfoy." She saw the blonde gulp at the dry air. "And maybe I do look at you, maybe I do have such 'filthy thoughts' about you," grey eyes flickered to hers in a panicked state. "So what? I'm not telling you anything, am I?" Malfoy didn't say anything for a long while, but Harry kept on meeting her intense stare with her own. The blonde jumped when a loud whistle came from the kitchen, Harry waved her hand to turn off the gas. She took in a deep breath and took in Malfoy's condition again. Her red towel hung on the thin shoulders and she could make out Malfoy's breasts peeking from the satin of her wet night gown, she had to stop herself from groaning out loud. She dropped on of the hands and squeezed at the bridge of her nose. "Are you here at twelve, midnight just to ask me this?" Malfoy still didn't reply, just looking at her with her doe eyes. "What about Scorpious?" That seemed to move her because the blonde immediately spoke on the topic of her son.
"Where were you?" Long fingers grabbed at his wrist and pulled him down. Draco flopped on the bed cause of that.
"You saw it?" He nodded his head. "And where did you see muggles having sex? Peep into the houses of some random politicians?"
Harry didn't understand at first, but then she glanced at the weeping quim and her eyes widened. "Wait- what? You're telling me that- Fuck!" She pressed at the bridge of her nose. Draco tried to shut her legs, even though they were stretched open and the movement was impeded by Harry's whole self. Harry didn't let her to, she held her grip on the knees tight.  "I didn't mean that, Draco, not in a bad way. It just came as a shock. You're just so beautiful." As if to make a point she leaned down to kiss her leaking, wet lower lips making Draco fall back hard onto the pillow with a groan. "How could Astor just not? Let's forget him." She gave a strong swirl of tongue at the labia. "Not even your fingers." Draco shook her head side to side, her blonde hair entangling terribly. "Why not?"
Harry casually slips in his boots. "it's them three against my ten men and I. I don't think they'd stand any chance if they even show any attack."
Harry chuckles, this time not controling himself. "I see you have prepared everything already. You just wanted a 'yes' from my side." He rubs the cold water from the long fared melted ice on the pale feet, before leaning down to kiss the two toes. He looks up to enjoy the blush that now appeared on the pale face. "we shall leave now then. Ravenclaw isn't that close by."
"Such mean words from such pretty lips, my arrogant Prince- or may I say Queen." He groaned as he gave a mock bow.  "But arrogance does suit you, you deserve to be of such nature."
"I didn't say that. What would Gryffindor gain from this? An heir isn't the issue on the head right now."
"I know!" He replied quickly. "it's the first show of the movie and I know you were dying to watch it." Oh yes, I was.
Harry licked everything clean, from Draco's thighs to her own face: if this was the only time she was going to savour the taste as well. When she was done, she reached up and placed a chaste kiss on Draco's lips who laid tired and heaving, with her eyes closed.
"It's about Astor." Her heartbeat dropped. "You very well know that he stays out of Britain, most of the time. It is his occupation to make sure that wizards and witches have proper living conditions in their homes- from elves to air quality, to gardening and plumbing. I'm not advertising really, I'm just giving reason as to why it is important for him to be there, with them. And his contacts and business relationship is with people outside of Britain mostly, so I can't really do anything about it, really. I'm mumbling, right?" Harry didn't say anything, Draco took a huge breath and willed herself to continue. "When I got married to Astor, it wasn't because I loved him or any other case. It was arranged by my parents and him. He got martial benefits and my parents got upper standing. Astor is a good man- he really is, and I thought I would come to love him in the years. When I have his child and I spend time with him and his habits." Till now, Draco was looking else where- at the floorboards, the ceiling, the tables and stools or the paintings; but when the blonde looked at Harry, she could all of a sudden feel her heart racing. "It hasn't happened though, Potter." Grey eyes were puffy and swollen and Harry realised how much in agony Draco must be in. But, she didn't know what to say. "And the funny thing is," she wasn't laughing. "It hasn't happened with anyone."
"It was delicious, little girl." The snake just hissed at her and then moved back to face Harry.  "Weren't we having a talk?" Harry then realized it wasn't because he didn't want to kill the snake, the snake had let itself into his mind making him think so. He pointed his sword at it and pointedly looked to the trees behind it.
"Well done, King of Gryffindor." It moved towards him. The horse Harry was on neighed in stress but he pulled at the reins and let out a whistle. The mammal quietened down though Harry could feel it tensed.
"You won't do that, Draco. We both know that." Draco really wanting to slap that grin away. His breath hitched when one of Potter's hand went on to squeeze his arse. "Although, there is a certain rumour spreading around in underworld."
My head hurt with the way I clenched my jaw. As soon as the credits rolled in, I stood up and made way behind them. I saw them enter a pub afterwards while I sat on a bench down the street before following in. It was hard to find them, with the amount of people that were inside. It was a Saturday night- muggles loved to huddle during that time. I was about to give up when I heard a loud gasp just behind me, at the bar. I looked through the corner of my eyes and saw the blonde shock of hair of my husband. His head was fallen back as he laughed and the man beside him grabbed him by his arm.
"What should I call you?" The man asked me, as he handed me the tumbler. He took out a hand for me to shake. I shook it lightly and said my name to him. I noticed his eyes widen, but maybe that would be just alcohol in my system. "I'm- Charmond Wesley." My eyes narrowed at that. He had red hair, he had a sharp nose but he wasn't pale nor did he have freckles. So, not a Weasley. "Where is your boyfriend?"
"What's that supposed to mean?" His eyes were full of confusion and his lips parted. I wanted to shake his shoulders and yell at him, and at the same time kiss him senseless till we both were breathless and had forgotten all about this.
“Potter,” said he and asked what he wanted. The other just shook his head and sat his hip in the edge of the stone platform. It was ridiculous to think that Potter wanted to sit here with him because Potter had class then, and from the amount of time he had spent watching him since first year it was incredulous that he was defying the say of one such Hermione Granger. Draco slammed his book shut and closed his eyes – thinking that if Potter thought that he was going to sleep, he would be left alone. Only was he wrong about it, because he felt a hand on his thigh which slowly travelled up towards his groin. Draco felt himself stiffen, and his eyes clenched, but he didn’t dare move. He felt a hot breath on his ear and snake like whisper he heard saying “you like me.” Draco nodded his head, a very miniscule of sort though. “Why should I like you, though?” his eyes fluttered open. His back stiffened, when, for the first time in the year he saw those green eyes gaze into his own silver ones. Draco stammered a bit, but then pushed Potter back and rushed out from there- leaving his charms book behind.
"What?" He gave an innocent look with his blue eyes. "I really like these muffins." A few crumbs spat out of his mouth and landed on Harry's desk which he vanished with a roll of his eyes.  He leaned back onto his leather chair and grabbed one of the cups, brought it too his nose to smell and immediately recognised the Irish tang. He sighed quite contently as he took the first big sip. He never knew from where Malfoy bought the coffee and pastries from everyday, they didn't have logos on the paper cups, but it sure did taste heavenly. "Could you lend me Malfoy for a week though, he such a good PA."
Harry smirked at him. "would you look at the coincidence, we had to meet in the same city, when I am a Mob Boss and you are nothing but a whore, and you're on your knees, literally, naked and servicing me." He came closer to the bed standing a couple of inches apart from the other. "do you remember that evening, when you had me pushed to my knees and punched my nose." He caressed the pale jaw. "Wonder what I can do to your face."
"My, isn't this wonderful!" His snarky voice came out and he should quite smug. "Leader of the Beaux and leader of the DA, both in the same room and both now arrested and to be sent to the prison."
"Draco." I said to him. "Where were you?" This brought a sudden nostalgia in my heart. While at that time I sure was an asshole to him, right now I couldn't help but be agitated. He wrapped his legs around my waist and dug his pointy chin in my shoulder. It poked me well enough to discomfort but I didn't say anything. I never say about the way his pointy elbows and knees and chin poke me, that's what made him Draco Malfoy-Potter.
"He's with the Zabinis, he wanted to watch a cartooned movie in the theatre and Blaise said he could do a sleepover at their place." Even while her tone was direct and stern, Harry could easily make out hints of fondness. They had both gone on lunch once, during common break intervals, and Malfoy had spent more than half hour talking about her son non stop, and this happened many a times.
"It hurts Harry, don't do that." Harry didn't stop but he did decrease the force. He leaned to kiss it too, as his hand slid under the light robe of Draco's and cupped at his arse before rubbing a finger at the hole. "Harry." He moaned when Draco called out his name with an arched back and digging him arse into Harry's hand. Harry brought the other hand forwards and sucked on two of his fingers vigorously maintaing a good eye contact. He loved the way Draco's pale cheeks which were golden in the candlelight, turned to a lovely shade of auburn. He relished the way a gasp followed by so many heaves left the full lips when Harry wiggled his mid finger in, pausing for a long while- until Draco whined and hit at him chest, and then slid it in further pressing at muscles inside. "oh Harry, we can't!"
Malfoy turned visibly red. "Of course not." Harry gave him a small smile as he watched the blond shuffle with the papers around. He came forward to his table and slipped him a letter. "This needs your signature in full name and your magical seal." Harry just read the title 'Werewolf and other canine companions' and signed it immediately. He couldn't help but wonder when he found Malfoy an year ago sitting in the waiting room, along with few other candidates for his secretary. It was Ron's idea to get one, he ranked just below him and the amount of paperwork and documents which went through him was just outrageous, along with the regular authorized representative he had be of a sites in the field. Balancing both was pretty hard, so he had let out a flyer in Quibbler's aspiring employee sections, credits to Luna.
Harry grabbed his arms, pulled him in and shut the door behind him. He could hear the hissing of Salazar at him and he grinned back at it when Draco wasn't looking.  He sat him on his couch, sitting beside him. "Draco?"
“You can’t tell me that.” Potter said calmly, dangerously. “What you can tell me is the truth. Did you let someone fuck you?”
Luna led Draco to the bank of the river. He didn't need the lights to see where he was being lead, the moon was bright enough for that. "sit down here" Luna whispers to him, and he saw a broad back in the river as it went down under the water. She sits him on the grass and kisses his cheek before she leaves him there. Draco gulps as the figure in the river was now standing completely, he seemed to be searching for something and then he turns around. Draco could feel his throat grow dry when the man approaches him in his naked glory. He closes his eyes and felt his cheeks heat up. "you're here." He says.
The afternoon went slow for me. And Draco didn't once come over to me, only sticking with Victor and talking to others. When it was sunset, the broad man escorted my husband to me. I smiled at Draco who gave out a small yawn and drew him to me to give him a heated kiss. After a few moments he leaned in and down to lay his head on my shoulder. I grin as I look at Victor, who smiled back at me in the most naïve manner possible. That seriously ticked me off. "We hardly talked." He said. "Draco was just introducing me to others, that I never had a pleasure to meet his beloved husband."
"I blame myself too at times. But how was I to know that a mere child would have such curiosity and plans?" Old eyes begged for understanding from Draco. He swallowed and looked away. "And he has now trapped me here as well."
"Ten Thousand!" Potter shouted aloud and a few men looked at them. Draco had to gasp again. He looked at Pierre again and he knew that his own demand wouldn't be fulfilled. No one would refuse to ten thousand. Only Grace would let Harry Potter come forward and flock his richness infront of Draco.
Harry grinned instead, pulling down his pants with his trousers a bit. His cock sprung upwards as precum leaked from the top. "C'mon spread your arse for me." He tugged at his length slightly. "C'mon!" He slapped at the pale arse and Draco hurried to do so. Harry poked at the entrance, not really thrusting in. He rubbed the tip up and down the crack, teasing him more and more, until Draco whimpered loudly. He was enjoying himself thoroughly hearing the other man's cries and quick yelps, and he wanted nothing more but to hear it all night. But he couldn't do that, he had to do some more of course. He thrusted in quickly, pushing in till he bottomed out and his length throbbed in when he heard a loud gasp. Draco held at his collar and hair, his arse brushed against the coarse fabric of the trousers and coolness of the zipper.
"Potter." Draco said to him around half an hour into his work. "could you scourgify-?" Harry nodded his head. "I'll be in the washroom then." Draco left him at that. He performed the spell on the door, before performing one on the device and attached the frame. He then prodded at the ends with a screwdriver. There was a click of door, he turned his head to see and saw Draco in a white towel, which was wrapped dangerously low around his waist. One pull and it would drop. He seemed quite comfortable with his condition, did he also appear in towels when there were visitors in his house? Did he also placed himself almost into somebody's lap if they even touched him a little? Did everyone fantasise about him like he did? To see that face of his, which he made two years ago? His grip on the screwdriver tightened and Harry was sure he would break the plastic if he didn't loosen his hold. He gulped.
"You're glowing but I see stress in your eyes. You need to be at peace with yourself." She says, brushing his hair behind his ears in a loving manner. "you need to let go of worries. A dove, Draco. Calm as dove."
"You stalked me! You son of a whore!" Harry slapped him hard on his other cheek. The teeth might have clanked against his tongue. He could see sharp tears pooling in the mercury eyes. All he wanted was to see them roll down and for Draco to cry openly. He hissed loudly and agate a minute saw the white snake infront of him.
Harry snapped back to reality when he felt a snap of fingers infront of his face. "Auror Potter!" He looked up to see pale brows furrowed. "I've been calling you. Four times by now. Are you alright? Do you need more coffee?" He looked at his cup and realised there was still half of it left. Harry shook his head.
"I need to go now. I can't direct any suspicions to myself." Harry had wanted to drag the man close to him and not let him go, but he held himself back.  He stood up too, albeit slowly.
"Why are you secretly hanging out with him!" I slammed my hand on the window, mostly to stop it from rattling, but I broke the knob instead. My hand ached but I didn't show it.
"Zabini, Parkinson, Goyle mostly I think." I nodded my head. "Victor too, right?" I frowned. He saw my expression and continued. "I saw them last night." This was second time when I got to about the 'outings' from Ron  about which I had no idea. I had thought that Draco had a long list of patients making him come home late, later than I did.
"Oh you know about it alright." It was as if the dam was broken on my tongue. I just couldn't stop myself and at that time it felt amazing, a relief that something heavy was let down off of my chest. "Hanging out, tea and coffee, movies, drinks, dates in some random pub drinking bloody Mary's; or Leaky's with your peers that is- Zabini, Parkinson or- or - or should I say, Victor, specifically?"
He was scared, not too much but marginally, as he took a step back but he willed his shoulders to stay straight and strong. It wasn't because of what I had said, it was because my magic was going wild. Our bed rustled and the windows opened and closed haphazardly. Last time this happened in front of Draco was when Charlie had a finger in him, and even at that time I doubt Draco was acutely aware of it because he was panting and heaving in need of a cock (my cock). But right now, he was fully aware. I took in a deep breath and willed my magic to calm. He didn't back down though (that's my Draco for you right there). "What is that supposed to imply, Harry?" He gritted out.
Draco had to stop his grin from coming on to his face. He was glad that what he had wanted was given. "I'm so sorry, Greyback wolf. I'm pregnant." He looked back to the Wizard stand up from the bed. "I do get this sickness any time of the day." The man nodded grimly, his eyes narrowing as he came closer to Draco, before he scowled. Draco stood up straight and looked up at him. "Are you disgusted by this? I'm the not one of pure and a fair you imagined me of." He looked down to portray a defensive and ashamed posture.
The wand was removed from his arse and the tip touch the base of his cock. “Believe me when I tell you,” he moaned when the mouth on the head of his prick, engulfed his whole length and the tongue played which the thin skin. The mouth moved back and cool air hit him. “I’ll never do you, no harm.” A chuckle and back was the mouth to suck him. He liked it- he couldn’t deny. The mouth was experienced and it just knew what areas to prod and suck and he lifted his hips, as much as he could against the heavy ropes. He whined when the being above him snatched his mouth away. “Oh darling…”
"No, Potter. You do know what I am talking about. Today evening itself you were staring at my arse and were trying to hold my waist. Everyone in the department came to know of it- you were staring at my arse for one whole hour, Potter!" In her defence, Malfoy's new black short skirt, was probably too short for her to wear it in public. Harry didn't want anyone to look at her Malfoy's arse while she bent down to see into the cabinets, or the significant rise of the hem when she was pushing the folder back to the high shelves. She was just making sure no one else looked at Malfoy, even though she herself enjoyed the view quite much.
"You should listen to your friend." The scruffy man held the other man with his collar and pointed his wand at the man's head. "If you both don't leave us, I will curse this lad and then both of you."
"Heya, guys." He then cleared his throat. "I mean- evening Auror Potter and Weasley." He gave a nod, and stomped his foot on the ground hard. Which I knew was necessary amongst Muggle military, but felt unnecessary right now. Ron and I nodded at him and he felt at ease.
are you waiting for?" Harry knew, and Draco came with a cry, his cum spurted up to hit till his neck. Harry couldn't bear anymore and he came in him with a groan of his own.
He would have tried to guess if it wasn’t for the mouth on his spongy head. There was a hard suck, a few shallow ones followed by a sharp lick at the tip. He tried to buck up but cursed was his bonded limbs (he felt the ropes – when the being above him grabbed at his arms  and squeezed his inner thighs). He might have used incarcous. The wooden tip (
"Ron!" Harry called out to him again and by the time he had already finished the second one as well.
"Normal people do shit. And those include people like Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and the goady Gryffindors. We are not those. We are Slytherins."
I crunched up to my elbows.  " 'What the fuck?' What the fuck to you, Draco?" His blond brows furrowed. "What the hell was that?"
"You don't love me anymore." I know I sounded like a child at the time but I was just so vulnerable. Only Harry has ever seen me like that, in sixth year, in the trials, and now.
"Harry." Even though I was a well trained, almost on his way to be the next Head Auror: Luna still made me jump out of skin. She was quiet and silent with her feet. I turn around to greet her. She started about the Quibbler, she had wanted an interview for the running post and I agreed for it. She then continued to talk of her trip to the Alps (God knows how she survived their with just her cloak and jumper) and the strange creatures she found there. I sort of tuned her out with my head nodding and my throat humming at regular intervals, as I watched Draco and his so called best friend of the day, walk around hand to hand talking to Neville, then Fluer, Ron, George, a quick 'hello' to Rose and then finally to Hermione, who sat on the set out couches with bowls of salad and soup infront of her. I saw Draco hand her a glass of raspberry juice which she happily took (I always wonder how she drank that shit).
"Harry!" I said heavily. "what are you getting so pissed about. I must have dropped it somewhere, I will get a new one, so calm down."
So what's my excuse as to why I didn't update? Well... I had written five long chapters and only the epilogue would be left. But then (ladies and gentlemen and others- never trust cloud) all the chapters they just went poof- vanished into the thin air. They went AK into where and what I don't know. I tried every thing to bring them back - believe me I put in a lot of sweat and tears into it, metaphorically. (But a lot of tea and coffee and cake went into it) only to get AKed. I got super duper upset and gave up. I decided on other of the plots which I wanted to try and kind of improved how I wrote Smut. To put the cherry - I had a few personal problems as well with a few rounds to clinic. (not covid)
"Astor is in Milan. He has some business to do." Like always, Harry thought to herself. In a month, Astor would be out for business for three weeks. One could easily see how Malfoy was lonely, but the blonde never said anything.
"Isn't there anyway to stop him!" He yelled throwing a book in the dark corner. "He's going to take over Ravenclaw in a few days, the old king of there's does nothing. I just got the news! And Slytherin is going to fall. End of the month and Gryffindor is gone too!"
"Is this what it is? You plan to escape a marriage you can't escape from?" Harry smirks in the direction of the veiled Prince in front of him. "Your Dark Lord, your matters. Gryffindor wants no part of it.  You've wasted our time as well as yours. You should prepare a elope plan instead of discussing matters such as these."
still had wrapped around his length, making him arch his back high up. A kiss, chaste and light, was placed on his cheek and he turned his eyes to a vexating degree that his head hurt. He could make out a nest of black hair and then the man leaned- he might have smiled at him when he raked his thick fingers through his scalp. “She is supposed to be clean and mine- Not anyone else’s, not even yours, George.” His voice came out stern and he sighed grateful when the fingers around his cock retreated.
The whole house was dark, a few days, later when I came home from the department. I tried the switches and casted around the few spells, the lights didn't turn on even though everything was normal in the house. I guess it was a short circuit. I sigh as I casted a Lumos and approached the bedroom. When I opened the door a pale, blond beauty sat on the bed, lounging (and I mean utter lounging with long legs stretched out and wide open showing that he just wore a very old, almost ancient, flannel shirt of mine- the sleeves which went past his wrists and the hem fell at the edge of his buttocks). I almost dropped my wand seeing how the nightstands and sills were covered in lit candles and a light sheet of red and pink petals was on the bed. I heard myself gulp as I came in. All my tiredness gone in an instant as he beckoned me closer with his right index finger, and I followed his silent order. "D-draco." I managed to choke out.
A whimper left him when the metal was pulled out of him. "Turn back." And he crawled to face Harry, his breath still heavy. "you look... Pretty." Harry slipped a finger inside of his mouth, grazing against the teeth. "Come here." He patted at his thigh, a smug expression on his face. Draco gulped before raising himself and falling on strong thighs, his bare arse falling perfectly on rough fabric of trousers. Harry brought him closer and slipped his tongue into the other's mouth, roughly biting at his lower lip. He tasted smoke and strong tangy taste of gunpowder in his mouth and that even turned him on more. Draco gasped in his mouth which immediately got swallowed, when he felt a broad finger slip into his entrance and then another finger joined it as well. Another hand came to his chest, rubbing at his nipple before pulling at it hard, making him gasp again.  "So responsive, worth my money. I swear." Draco's head fell back when another finger joined their companions and grazed against his prostate.
"A bath too. You stink of sweat." His hand lowered to cup my crotch (and I knew that I was going to have a cold shower and a quick wank), before he left me horny to go in and aid Teddy in making the cookies.
"For all I could know, you could have been working for this Dark Lord of yours. Aiming to take over Gryffindor." Draco's eyes widened at that and he shook his head as he shivered.
He then went to a cafe and ordered a latte and a  vanilla cupcake. He had had his first coffee after he left wizarding world in the same cafe. It was the smell which had drawn  him in, but after that he had never come to this place. Only if he had continued coming here, he would have had chance to see his old schoolmate much quicker. Probably in few weeks. Nevertheless, he had found him and he didn't plan to lose him.  Ever again. It was evening by then and got up leaving a few extra notes on the table. He reached the tree and he could make out Draco's flat easily from there.
"It's not-" Malfoy sighed before continuing. "It's not that she won't be able to learn. She is too young for me, I haven't taught anyone as old as her."
Draco pushed down his arms and glared darkly at Potter. "Don't you fucking pity me!" He hissed out. "and don't you fucking dare think that you can now swoop in and be a hero that you are. 'Now' that you're talking about is good and I like it. It's not lavish and amazing, but it's good. At least I don't have to face hypocrites like you, who think that fancy dinners and auctions can save the world because you're donating. It goes much more than that. And-" he let out a dark laugh. "And you know the best part about this, this all took place before Dark Lord, during he was there, and after him too. Not much difference in the culture, is there, Potter? People move on quite quickly in wizarding world, and maybe right now I'm poor, way poorer for you to even consider. But soon, I swear I will be as rich as you, maybe even richer than you, because I'm Draco Malfoy." He turned swiftly around to walk away from Potter, not before saying. "War Heroes, my arse."
I shrugged before gulping down a mouthful. "Oh well, Stuff happened." She rolled her eyes, as she picked up her purse and we side-alonged to a wet and dirty street. We both threw our glass on the  cum stained brick wall, the loud shatter shocking a couple making out on the edge. We grinned at each other and walked through gates of Fairie Dust. It's quite an ironic name, because when we went inside we couldn't see a single Fairie.
Draco was about to retort back, but he took a deep breath and screwed his lips to quieten. "Get out of my Father's head. You have done nothing but rot his brain. For so long have I missed his gaze at me, and you have willfully stolen it from me. And now- you want to take him away from me forever!" He was heaving with anger. "You have Slytherin, you have Ravenclaw: you have two kingdoms under your foot. What more do you wish to have?! Leave my Father-"
I couldn't speak but that didn't mean Charmond felt the same thing. "He was making out with me. I heard you didn't give him proper attention."
"Potter? May I help you?" Malfoy asked him when he was less than a feet away from him. For while he couldn't say anything, but then he found his voice.
"Well according to you, I'm a dyke. And you're here, infront of me, basically naked. Are you trying to seduce me?" Herman would be really upset with her of he was here, but Ronny would have whooped in delight. Harry didn't like the way Draco shrunk back a bit, but she couldn't help the jab.
Draco heaved out a loud sigh. "I feel really motivated." He took a step closer so that his torso almost touched the others. He brought his fingers, which threatened to shake if he wasn't concentrating enough, and unbuttoned his shirt slowly, but quick enough to get the proper attention. He knew he had succeeded when the red eyes went to his pale and exposed chest. He threw back his shirt on to the floor. "I feel so sure."
"She's not. She believes in the magic of nature. The nature is alive, I do believe that. The moon would be at the peak tonight."
I made to stand up, walking around him to the bathroom. "I'm going to shower. You are going to keep sitting there and ponder as to why you're an awful asshole by not sharing problems with your boyfriend."
He made a snickering sound. "She can't fit into her shoes she got last summer. She wears my slippers all around the house." I joined in the chuckle. "Rose just pokes around her belly. She'd read her Babbity Rabbit stories and sing to it. It's adorable."
"That high bastard?" I frowned when he called Harry that. Only I and at times Pansy and Blaise, were allowed to call him that. But I controlled my tongue to I snapped at him, opting to just glare at him. He chuckled at that. "offended? C'mon Draco, he's cheating on you."
"He is called Prince." Malfoy answered with warmth. The cat screeched and shuffled in his hold, then he let it go. "He likes to be alone, most of the times." Harry took a step back when the cat walked past him, it felt like it was shooting him a glare of its own; but then he shook his head at the weirdness of the situation.
Draco silences them with a lift of his hand, and points the same hand towards Harry. "What's your say in this Prince?" He says with a drawl, which makes Harry narrow his eyes at him.
It wasn't as if Harry didn't like his job, but on this particular moment he loved it. And he was thankful for it. A Daniël Noir had placed for an order and he was delivering it. What he didn't expect was to find Draco Malfoy, dressed in a loose blue vest and white shorts, his forehead covered in sweat, when he knocked on the door. Grey eyes widened too, as Harry's own did. "Malfoy?" He whispered, the package in his arms almost dropping. Malfoy blinked at him rapidly, his heated cheeks paling.
Draco moved swiftly a step back. Even now he was regretting the hasty decision he had made. Harry had told him a quick 'no' when he had declared he would go to Ravenclaw. He was given a thousand reasons as to why he should stay in the Gryffindor; but recklessness ran in his blood. From his fast marriage and quick pregnancy, to the night before - when he had escaped from the rooms and ran to the stables to get his mare, while Harry had gone to the court with Hermione. He had ridden way too hurriedly with just a loaf of bread, he had snatched from the kitchens. His thighs were chaffed and his neck and cheeks still burnt with sweat. He hadn't even knocked on the doors of Ravenclaw: as if his exact time of arrival was known, the doors opened the moment his mare's hoofs were  a metre away from the gates. People looked at him with wide eyes, the soldiers with a glance and ministers with a blank look- Draco knew they were conquered over. Even now the courtiers sitting around him were dead by the brain, looking at him as if he were but a mere deer. Though there were a few who were grinning and smirking in a way too sinister manner than acceptable anywhere but upon the mouths of monsters in fairy tales.
It couldn't be possible, Harry thought. How did he ever love a man so materialistic, fickle and power hungry, who did nothing but feign affection towards him. A small part of his mind was in a thought that something was definitely wrong and was going awry. For a minute he did think that Draco might be under spell of the evil man, hit his eyes even though blank was not emotionless. His still held colour, unlike the courtiers and guards of Ravenclaw, whose eyes were all black. His anger came three fold. Draco was definitely in a wolf in sheep's clothing. But Harry still loved him. And with the last statement Draco had said, Harry couldn't help imagine Draco lying naked and wanton on blue sheets, his skin refracting the moon light. Only this time he wouldn't be open wide for Harry, but the snake of a man who called himself Dark Lord, with his long spindly fingers he would touch Draco from his nipples to his length, and diving them in Draco's heated hole where his walls and muscles would clench so lovingly around the digits.
He cut her off. "I'm sorry. But I need to be excused. My colleagues wait for me and we need to take our  things." That was half a lie. He knew Pierre would be busy drinking his arse off, but his other partner would be there. And he did indeed need to pack everything he had utilised. So he left them, while Granger bit Potter's ear off.
His pout deepened, and his hair smoothed out, which of course had to cause a pang in my heart because he looked exactly like the kid version of Draco, specially resembling the photos Narcissa had shown me a couple of years ago; save for the light freckles and brown irises, which  Draco didn't have. "I had wanted to tell him about the new energy ball we all made in school."
"Yes. And maybe someone else too." Potter gave him a toothy grin, and Draco really wanted him to stop with that. He was probably half way through with his coffee, when he pulled a red paper box out of his coat, and took out a white stick. "Is it alright if I smoke?" He waved the stick in front of his face. Draco just shrugged his shoulders and Potter lit his cigarette wandlessly, and the blond could feel the effects of the sudden strong magic in the air.
"He escaped. We fought and he got an upper hand." Roberts shook his head in a tight way, and let out a hiss. "It happened before too. He's strong."
"Malfoy." He smiled brightly at him, and Draco just took another sip form his glass to keep him sane. Potter nodded once at Pierre and the old man, the traitor he was being, left them both with a gentle snicker.
!" They both snapped their neck to see Ron Weasley by the door. He looked at them with wide eyes and then turned around. Draco saw the handcuff dangle down from one of his freckled hand and he couldn't help but wonder where Reynolds was; but before that, Weasley had seen him in such position.  He pushed Harry off of him and he had barely moved except for a small nudge.
"Yes. Yes I am." He sighed as he stroke his beard. "Though, it has been ages since I was recognised as one. Now I am nothing but a bookkeeper. I take care of this library and it's knowledge. Make hefty records." Draco had wanted to say in a very sarcastic tone that it was some care that books were getting, but he shut his mouth. As if he had read his thoughts, Professor spoke. "Never judge a book by its state of condition but always by what is written inside it." Draco nodded his head, again.
Salazar unwound himself and slithered away to his jar type bowl. Harry muttered a finite spell and the bounds from Draco's legs disappeared. He looked at the grey eyes, which were red with tears and pain and too much pleasure. Draco laid limp below him. He brushed the damp blonde hair to the side looking and at most admiring the face. "why?" Draco whispered below him, and Harry wouldn't have heard him if he wasn't looking at his face at the time.
Harry breathed heavily above him. "You forget that now you're titled Queen of this evil King. Makes you evil too doesn't it?" He pushes inside in one movement making the other moan out aloud. He doesn't move for a couple of moments, until Draco shifts around for some movement. He then grins. He was straining himself with control, but teasing the other was quite a satisfaction.
Rowan pulled him, but Draco hardly relented. "You can't do that!" Rowan had both of his wrists in a hold, that also made it impossible to reach his wand.
"I had wanted to ask you something as well." Draco raised a brow at him. "How about we grab something to eat this week? I would like to buy you something, for helping me out there." Potter had subtlety of a Gryffindor to charge in like a bull.
"What is it Draco?" Harry asked calmly, hitting the bundle of nerves again in a slow rhythm. "never being fucked like this? You seem to be losing your senses. One might think that you're not a professional whore." His voice was heavy with smugness, and Draco couldn't help but cave into it.  He shook his head desperately, nibbling at his ear before leaning in for a wet kiss. Harry complied with him, there was nothing wrong in saying that Draco Malfoy was a desperate kisser and he gave everything into it. Even while their teeth clanked and he bit his tongue way too many times, he sure leaned in like a kitten to its master.
"Both." He said. "If you have forgotten, I would like to remind you that I am a walking and talking scandal."
When he woke up again, he saw the sun almost sinking and the sky dark. Harry was sitting on a chair beside the window, looking at the horizon. "you should have woken me up." He said in a sleep heavy voice.
The tanned Prince grit his teeth. "you can't tell me that you wore that and roamed around in your Slytherin castle." When Draco didn't reply, he realised. "oh merlin, you did, didn't you?"
Malfoy walked in next day with a macha frappe, possibly for himself, and a strong smelling coffee, which made Harry gleam with delight as soon as he saw the cup and a sweet smelling something in a small box, with a singing 'Auror Potter'. Harry's best part of the day was this current moment. Malfoy walking in with a bright smile on his face and a tight fitted shirt, his grey eyes immediately going to the tables and his hands quickly casting spells to arrange and rearrange everything to order.
"What does it look like I'm doing?" As soon as Harry pulled out her fingers she dug her tongue into the heat, moaning loudly. "You taste divine!" She said replacing her tongue again. She noticed the way Draco moved her hips with Harry's hand, as if to meet with the thrusts: to chase her every jab.
"I have missed you so much." Draco said and leaned on to Harry so that he had to take a few steps and flop on the stone bench aligned to the wall. Draco shifted terribly in his lap, panting heavily and whining a few times. "Oh Harry!" He cried out and Harry could feel his length dig into his abdomen. Harry stopped his moving hips and Draco whined.
"And you're always in my office every early morning when you have a perfectly nice cabin right across the hallway." Harry's voice came out muffled beneath his crossed arms. "and he's late." He glanced at the Muggle clock Arthur had given him on his twenty third birthday.
I was on top of him then, pushing him on the sofa and grinding my hardening prick against his, not letting go of his mouth. He mumbled something, like a quick spell or something, but I let it go as a needy say. I felt a finger at my rim then, it was wet and hot and sticky- lubricant spell then, and then the finger breached inside of me. I moaned loudly, arching my back as I leaned back, sadly leaving his lips. My mouth was burning with the scratches from his beard but I didn't really mind it. The finger slipped out and  prodded in me again. It was oh so amaz-
“When you told me-“ the man moved his hand quick and rapidly, his fingers squeezing the veins of his cock. “You didn’t need me” he felt a sharp contrast between pain and unwanted pleasure- the latter taking over his senses gradually. “Anymore.”
!" He shoved a pancake in his mouth, his blue eyes going wild. "And she doesn't even ask me! Like am I not her dad?"
"He's doing nothing but sleeping." Harry sighed, when Draco stood up, going to his drawers and pulling out his potion vial. He took a sip of water before downing the potion. It didn't taste bad, more of sweet. "I just want him to get better. He's been in pain for too long." Harry continued.
. And I don't want an offspring coming out of you which isn't mine and you've been pretty smart in creating an heir for the Slytherin so that I would have no control over the state." He tutted. "But we would have that changed.  Now, we have to wait for a while so that I can kill that parasite inside of you, or else - accidentally, I would end up shredding your guts to ribbons. I would never want that." Draco eyed him as he came to stand infront of  him yet again.
Harry was grinning when he came upwater. "Tit for tat it is, Draco." He looked down at his wet lips and then met those with his own for a chaste kiss. "We ride for Gryffindor."
"Harry.." Hermione stood up from her side. "you need to calm down. A King shouldn't loose his temper."
"Draco." Rowan said pointedly to him. "Let's just go. The night is still young." Draco wanted to slap his mouth away.
"Father I thought-" Harry was started with his words, but Draco decided to take the matter into his own hands.
"A case. Some drug case. I called Kingsley. Harry, I had to call Kingsley!" To his defence Draco didn't like Kingsley, post-war hate sparks- Kingsley didn't support Narcissa while her trials took place. But since he did call Kingsley that meant he was terribly and furiously worried.
Malfoy frowned. "I said I was suspicious. I always feel like there is something lurking in there, maybe ghosts?" He provided. "Well, that's why Manor is closed and I don't live there."
He had imagined it to happen at least once, and it did happen. Draco pursed him pursed his lips and clenched his jaw tight. "Potter what are you doing? What are you playing at?"
"Matilda Trillory", Blaise started from under his cloak and disguised face. "hundered and seventeen days from today you were in Muggle London, where you had a continuous intercourse with a man named Aukley Moore, who is a Muggle underworld lanky and drug distributor. Ninety eight days before today you visited a Muggle hospital and got a positive response of pregnancy. Ninety days prior to today you met Harry Potter in wizarding club named 'sparkle clover', and the attendees say that you didn't have any intimacy with him. A few days from then, you meet Harry Potter in his office and tell him to give you a job." She had tears pooling in her eyes. And I had no remorse, she deserved it. There was creak of a door and I saw Robards come out from his office.
"A week by now." His voice shivered. "but I couldn't make it at that time Harry. I was busy with my own. I couldn't bear the risk for my potion to go astray."
Harry regretted the moment the door shut. He wanted to go behind Draco and call him back in, to tell him that he didn't mean any of that, that he was sleep deprived and tired and frustrated at everything which was happening around. He wanted to carry him back in and clean him with a warm cloth and bath with him in his marble tub. He wanted caress his body and kiss all the ache he felt. He wanted ... He wanted Draco.
"Right, right. I'm leaving, I'm leaving." She giggled and hobbled out of the shop. Harry grinned at Draco, watching his smacked face. He pushed the flowers towards him again and Draco looked down at them. The blond looked at them as if they were cursed, and didn't touch them for a while, before carefully holding the stems.
"Help him teach you a lesson to say. Seriously Harry, cheating on your own boyfriend? That's way too down. Mom would be disappointed." Or maybe Charlie said something in that tone. I couldn't really pay attention to be honest. I had my mouth on Weasel's brother, I was traumatised. And he was attractive too, I felt like I needed therapy. "I think my work here is done. I'll be taking your leave."
"Harry pass me the lavender coloured potion from that shelf." I pointed at the wooden cabinet and he passed me the paralyzing liquid. "okay, so I'll be putting this on your arm and it'll all be fine." It was just going to drop the squiggly arm down, and so it did, when I poured a few drops of it near the elbow. I slipped off of him, Harry helped me not to stumble. His grip around my waist and arm. I wasn't complaining though. "We're going to spell it back and a cast would be around the arm. So, no magic or strain for a week." It took me a few five minutes, but I was done. A round of physio had to be done and I could already see Harry jumping on his balls of feet. I sighed as I poked at the now human arm. "What is it?"
"We have to kill these two, find the non blooded item and destroy it as well before moving on to him. He'll be utterly weak and can be taken care of by that way."
"I don't care! Ponder!" I didn't wait for his reply before slamming the door shut and running the shower hot. Hot showers always made me think better and I knew the outcome was brilliant when I called Blaise that evening.
Lucius laid on his bed- deadlike and his eyes closed. The drapes were shut and his shivering hand raised to feel a ghostly presence. He opened his eyes, his pupils clouded white. "Draco..." He whispered.
Victor let out his hand. "The reputed Potter! I've heard so much about you." Every living  wizard in England has heard about me. I managed not to roll my eyes and shook his hand in a too stiff and hard manner with a smile and said 'Me too'. His shake was hard too, it seemed he wasn't affected by it. He let it go to put the same hand around Draco's shoulders, though I could make out it was put lightly to not put any pressure on his bones. "Draco says you would be running for the Head Auror position soon."
When she calmed down and I had repaired the couch, a bit messy, to sit on for all of us, Louis gave us both a stern look. "I know this all can be repaired, but seriously it's illegal to break into someone's house. Especially a police officer's." Pansy and I rolled our eyes.
"Your feet burn just cause they spent a few moments in hot sand. So,no. You wouldn't survive-." At the moment a servant came in holding a beaker of ice and placing it on the table just by there side, he bowed before leaving as fast as he could. "Here! A solution to your ailment." Harry smirked down at him.
"Prince Draco has decided it to be and that's how he wishes. Some mage in Ravenclaw forests would conduct the rituals. He doesn't want to waste time."
"Utter disgrace!" The man, Blaise, next to Draco exclaims. Pansy joins him too. "This is nonsense what you ask for. It's a shameful act!"
He was surprised when the blond laughed. "I think you're taking the place of the King quite well." When he sobered he continued. "Would you give up your crown again now that your father is well?"
"What's got in my-?" He groaned angrily, which was exactly what I wanted. He looked at my face pointedly. "where's the earring?"
Harry leaned down to kiss his neck wetly before leaving a long lick to his ear. "Then come, Draco." He whispered in his ear.
"You mean Kingsley and his gang- and I thought you would have known, soon to be taking Head Auror position and all. You should have a word with him."
"How I present?" Harry motioned at his clothing attire. "what is wrong with this though?" Draco had a confused look.
The blonde simply looked at him with a raised brow. "Oh, Harry." He called out as if he'd just seen him kneeling on the ground. "It's a pleasant surprise." The Dark Lord wrapped his long arm around him and to Harry's utter shock Draco leaned-
Draco shakes his head, even though he knew Harry couldn't look at him. He becomes nervous at the thought, but he pushes it behind his head, when he straddles his husband. He places his hands on the toned chest. He smiles small when Harry opens his eyes to look at him. "I want you to teach me." He shrugs his robe down, the collars slipping to his arms. "I've been told I'm a good student. I learn things quickly." He shifts back, until he felt a buldge below his hips, and then leans down to place a slow kiss at the other's cheek. "I won't let you down, I promise." He whispers in his ear.
After having a proper six hour sleep at Ron and Hermione's, and getting a bouquet of lavender and white orchids, I was, the next morning, knocking on the door of Parkinson Palace. "Pansy!" I know my smile was blinding because she scrunched her face and groaned out. Only Pansy Parkinson could wear a white see through baby doll and dark red lipstick, sipping on a cup of hot lemon infusion and greet me with a bird already flipped out, at nine in the morning. "You look lovely!"
Draco bites his lip with guilty, when he stares down at Harry. He did feel a bit bad and upset at himself. The Prince, his husband, was right but he still needed an affirmation of loyalty. He realises that he doubted the trust factor between them. The other had been nothing but good to him. He taps on the wet shoulder.
"Orchard, Teddy." Draco took the packet from his hands with a tug. "And we don't put choco chips right now, we do it afterwards."
"Pansy!" He called out and the woman jumped down as well, when he saw the other side drawing for their swords, he shooed them with a wave of his hand. "Pansy is my lady-in-waiting." Harry was surprised to find a Prince with a lady-in-waiting, but ignored it. He saw the other Prince remove the scarf from his head, platinum blonde hair came into show which looked as silky as it could be. The next went his green robe from torso which showed him a lean, pale but pink skin which was smooth and scarless, unlike Harry's own. Pansy went behind him, untying a few knots and down came his black trousers; she also bent down to remove his shoes and Harry raked his eyes from the feet to knobby ankles, toned calves and thighs to the white loincloth which matches his skin toned perfectly. Pansy stood up and untied the veil. Harry waited impatiently, cause what he saw took his breath away- grey, no, silver eyes which looked, no, glared at him, a sharp nose of the perfect length and pink lips shifted to form a pout. He had never seen as beautiful as him anywhere. "would you like me to remove this as well?" He pulled sideways at his only covering and Harry heard a loud gulp behind him. He wanted nothing but to punch his own soldier, he refrained himself from doing so. He now regretted telling him to disrobe, he didn't want anyone's eyes on the other Prince. "That won't be necessary." He said in a raspy voice.
"It's not Saturday." He made it sound like a question, like he was totally unsure. He glanced at the bright calendar we got from out trip to Hawaii.
He strode towards me, picking up my clothes on the way. "it's not about new one, Draco. It's about the feel-" and then he grabbed my chin, rubbing his finger on my lower lip. "why are your lips swollen? And it looks like someone bit on it." His voice was stern.
"But the best look for you is naked, and withering with pleasure, when my cock is in you." Draco growled before taking a leap forward and hitting the back of the gun on Harry's head. He stumbled back and few paces, holding his forehead as it hurt and brought his hand down to see the blood. "You're quite rough, like some feisty little kitty- or shall I call you slut?" Draco scowled, he couldn't control himself to raise a hand to punch him in the gut, but before his hand could strike the toned abdomen which he had once caressed, not a week ago, his hand was held in a tight grip, pulling him closer to the other man. Draco winced, but he held the gun on the other man's head.
Harry? Knew you had a knack for blonds!" Draco buttoned his shirt and hurriedly stood up and picked up his pants, and put them on as well.
"Is it because you're seeing my tits?" She huffed a sigh of relief when Malfoy shook her head. The blonde leaned up in a sitting position.
"Who knew the Wonder Boy had an addiction." He muttered looking at the side when Potter blew out the first blow of smoke.
When Ron suggested Harry to blow of some steam on a rent boy instead of beating their subordinates to a pulpy death just cause of a slight mistake that took place in the raid, and Harry had then relented by calling up the 'whore service', as he liked to call it, to send in a lithe boy with nice arse and nice face; he didn't expect to find his school bully, Draco fucking Malfoy with his whispy soft blonde hair  and grey eyes, wearing nothing but a peach silk robe that reached just below his butt and stretched out like a cat with his legs flying back and forth in the air and grinning at him through his pink lips.
The man would have raised his eyebrows if he had them. "Do you now, my Draco?" The red eyes formed slits.
Harry stood up from the bed, crowding over her and Draco lowered her eyes to look at the floor. "Wanna pay me now too? Is that what you're waiting for? Want me to name my charge?" Harry felt disappointed in herself for saying that, especially to Draco, but she stood stiff.
Draco was on top now as he rode the length up and down, back and forth, going faster and faster by every minute. He saw green eyes open in surprise but then they hooded at the amazing sensation. Harry let his hands be held on top of his head when Draco gripped his wrists and pinned them down on the bed. Harry was getting close to his first orgasm (of course it wasn't going to be just once, he had planned around five ways he was going to fuck Draco and two of them included on the glass window and one was making the blonde suck him while he fucked him to release with his gun - silver clashed quite well against the rosy pale skin), but his eyes snapped open when he heard a distinct click and Draco stopped moving on top of him. Those grey eyes were filled with satisfaction, and when he tried to move his hands, he found them handcuffed and held onto the headboard. "What's this Draco, do you provide the excitement of bondage to your customers even when they don't mention it?" His eyes glared at the blonde with a warning.
He resisted against the bonds but stopped when the finger slipped out of him. He couldn’t stop the gasp.
"Yeah... We'll see you soon then?" Harry tried for a wink but failed at it miserably, because Malfoy frowned his brows at him. He quickly cleared his throat, and tugged at Rose. She waved at him with a 'See you, Mr Malfoy.'
"Listen Potter," There, right there, was her snakey voice, back out with full force. "I would never tell you where Draco now is, because he's not here. And also because I'm a very good friend." My shoulders flopped. "Thus, I would never tell you that Draco is in Opposites Attract, some Muggle pub in Muggle London, because Draco terribly trusts me not to tell you."
He moved a gentle hand through its mane. "Rest, rest please." The owl blinked again and quietened his hoots and chirps. That's when Draco noticed a note on the other claw. He untied it and read it, only to drop the note on the sheets with a gasp.
They stayed like that for a while, for a couple of minutes, counting each others breath. Then Harry rolled over beside him, taking deep breaths. "quite a fuck, that was."
Also, I think I'll post the next chapter in a period of 4-5 days, but it can be soon. I'm speedily writing that.
"Just like his owner." Draco looked up at Potter in a start, his eyes wide and mouth slightly ajar. "It's not bad though." Potter winked at him before sipping the beverage, he made a face but didn't say anything. "Maybe I can get to know him better?" Potter glanced at Prince, but then gazed into his silver eyes. Draco could already feel his heart skip a beat or two, way
Harry tilted his mouth, screwing his lips. "uh... Okay then. I'll recheck it through HO." The pale head nodded, and Harry saw sweat on his forehead again. "Are you okay? You're always sweating."
He grins when he feels strong hands on his waist, and he moves slightly on the rising length. "you're a vixen." Harry looks at him with narrow eyes. "a beautiful one at that. You have a way with words though." Draco rises himself  back to look down at him, as he unfastens the knot of his robe, and slips it off to the side. He whimpers when one of the hands glide up his torso and to his pale chest, rubbing at his pink nipples. The other hand grips his swelling length, stroking it with slow motions. Harry pulls him down to a kiss, slipping his tongue inside his mouth. He could taste sweet tang of berries and feels a large hand cupping his hips.
"The first dose causes restlessness. The second soothes it down. But he have to hurry. The potion prepares me."
"I'm not lying!" Draco slaps his hand away. Harry could see his red finger imprints on the other's jaw. "I could have run away. You think I'm not capable of that?"
"It's not- right! M-mother said- never t-to do it. Oh Merlin, yes!" Harry was pleased with herself, especially with the way Draco stuttered and turned red.
"Which said 'I'm going to club' and nothing else. You were very late Draco, and I didn't even know where you were or who you were with or-"
He scoffed as he sipped on his tea. "I am not. He decided to become one when he was just eighteen, he told me that he needed my support. I didn't give him, I kicked him out to the back yard shed. I thought he'd be back in morning with his senses in mind. The only thing I found was a letter on the shed door. He's leaving, it said." I smiled at him and put my hand on his hand, rubbing my thumb in slow circles. "it's just he loved sweets too." I consoled him for a while and then asked to look at his wand. And returned it to him. He continued speaking at the times, talking about how his son was a mischievous little brat.
"My uncle like I said, is an alchemist. He can do minor magic and make potions. He can make one for that purpose. It is pretty common in the state and nearby villages. Mostly tribes use it but so can we. I imagine you didn't know about with the amount of books you've read till this age, which might be less than ten."
"What?!" Both Ron and Hermione, exclaim out at the same time. Even though Harry was supposed to maintain a cool and collected expression, he couldn't help but widen his eyes and drop his jaw to gape. "This can't be happening-"
Draco chose to grin instead. "I missed you." He wrapped his arms around his broad shoulders and blinked up at him.
That night when he saw Greg come into their rooms, damp from his recent shower with a brown towel wrapped around his waist- he saw that Greg wasn’t chubby as he was before. He wasn’t strongly built, but he sure wasn’t fat anymore. He unbuttoned his shirt and let Greg see it, till he was wearing nothing but a blush on his face which might have covered his chest as well. Greg gulped hard when Draco sat on his lap. He didn’t kiss him, nor did he let Greg kiss him, but he rode his cock with tears rolling down his face and Greg just soothed him(Bless Greg.) It hurt like shit and in the morning Draco saw blood stains on the light green sheets, but he didn’t care- even as he limped around for the whole next week.
He cleared his throat pointedly. "Draco let's go. Our rooms." Draco looked at him before sighing and walking to his husband. Harry saw the state of his undress, guilt filling his gut as to how he had kicked him out last night; he unclasped his cloak and wrapped it around his lithe body. He grabbed hold of his hand and dragged him out of the room.
He didn't sign. He knew Draco would be able to recognise his writing. He tied it and told the owl to take it to Draco. It nodded and flew away.
He narrowed his eyes and stood up from bed. "I don't know what's wrong in it. You're acting so overwhelmed." He opened the door to bath and went in. "I'm going for a bath and I'm going to masturbate too" He shut me up before I could say anything to him. " Alone. I don't want you inside, with me." And the door was shut with a hard force. I just flopped my head on the mattress thinking how stupid (although valid) I  had sounded a minute ago. Nothing a good and expensive  gift wouldn't solve, but I still went awry at the fact.
way too many times. He just saw the scuffed leather shoes still stained with dried blood, and maybe it was just a faint memory, but Draco could taste the sharp iron tang of it in his nostrils.
"We need to help him!" He cried out, he tried to pull his hand away but Rowan was indeed stronger than he looked.
He saw the blond brows furrow in confusion. "Right now?" He looked back at the full class of aged persons. Harry mentally slapped himself, but he forced a grin on his face.
: I'm thinking (not writing currently as I'm focusing completely on this work) of writing a Drarry. But I want to establish a relationship between Draco and someone else prior to Drarry. The other character would be shrewd, calculating and very manipulative. I'm thinking between Blaise and Pansy ( and a part of Theodore). So what do you think which character would work with Draco before he gets it on with Harry? I'm open to other characters as well but this person would be anti-Harry, This person would hate him. Please help me with this if you can, and tell me how you like this chapter? 🌻🌻
"What are-" Draco was going to demand an explanation but he was quickly picked up in broad arms and carried to the adjoining en suite bathroom. He yelped when he was sat on the cold ceramic. "okay wait!" Harry stood infront of him impatiently, then rolled his eyes at his asked question and kissing him deeply.
“And what?” But seemed that Potter had wanted to torture him from the minute he dragged him into this abandoned classroom. So Draco shook his head, looking at the patch of heated skin on Potter’s neck. Potter let him go then.
day, he had scared Potter with an illusion spell and had put him in a healers’ bed. He wanted to slap his younger self.
"Oh you already found one. There's a beared bloke looking at you since past five minutes." She nods at the bar and I glanced to see a fit man, dark maroon hair and quite a dashing beard. I gave him a small smile and he raised his glass at me. "you should go to him."
"If I didn't want better of Gryffindor I wouldn't have said all this to you. I'm learnt well enough to make decisions, say whether it's right or not. I have advised my Father in the planning of requirements for Slytherin. I might not have slept with anyone till now," Draco saw a look of amusement in Harry's eyes which made him sneer. "but I know I can satisfy someone in bed. And I...I can give you an heir."
Rushed and quick, I know. Think of it as a fast climax though? This chapter was written thrice. Once cause I lost it again (thank you bad internet connection in country side :') ). Second time turned out bad- drunk bad, and I had to back space 3541 words. The final product, after a lot of editing, is presented to you.
"He's always gentle. He rarely scratches anyone, anyone. I swear, he's polite. He wouldn't never hurt a creature, not even a bird. He might have slipped from the vine." For the few moments Harry thought that Malfoy was genuinely concerned about him. But then he realised that Malfoy was
Draco sat up, glaring at him dangerously. "get out!" Harry stood up in confusion. "get out! Fucking get out of my house! GET OUT!" Harry didn't want this type of tears which poured down his face. He wanted to see the angry tears, sad tears, upset tears, shock tears. But Draco's eyes were defeated. He would have excepted it, but then Draco threw a vase at his head, which his missed by a hair length.  Harry pulled on is clothes and rushed out from the door. "GET THE FUCK OUT!" Harry shut the door behind him and he saw Mathew blooded on the corner staring at him with big eyes. He couldn't meet his eyes and ran down the stairs. He ran to where ever his legs could take him. He ran.
"Draco!" A woman with long, wavy blonde hair greets them at the edge of the Blue forest, she had sat herself on a big rock, blue birds and a few deers around her. "You made it just on time."
"Are You close?" Harry still asked, panting and huffing slightly, when she saw Draco's brows squint and eyes clenched. Draco answered her by pulling her closer and turning them around, so that now the blonde was on top of her. Draco cried out a cuss in pleasure.
"So, you'd go and knock up women all around diagon alley?" I gave him a small hex on his thigh. He didn't even flinch.
The morning came with a fresh motivation for Harry. He decided to reconcile with his husband. He didn't knock at the doors of his chambers, which were on the completely different side of the castle. He was greeted with a beautiful sight of a blond sleeping soundly on the dark maroon sheets and a gold threaded pillows. The covers had wound in a haggard manner around his waist and Harry could see that Draco slept naked in his form. He sat on the mattress as quietly as he could with his heavy clothes. He let his palm graze the smooth jaw and thumbed at the pink lips. He couldn't stop himself from reminiscing the first moment he had looked at Draco. It had been scorching hot and Draco felt like an oasis, his silver eyes were tempting and his full lips inviting. The offer of marriage to such a man came like a blessing to him. He had wanted nothing but to carry him in his arms and take him to the tents and have his way with him. But Draco looked way too regal, just as he did now- even as he slept with light snores.
"I've to go somewhere, Draco. Um ... Can I call you Draco?" Malfoy looked at him with narrow eyes before shrugging. "okay, Draco. I'm visiting Hermione and Ron."
"Harry, I'm drunk. And I need to sleep. I have an afternoon shift tomorrow. Good night." I smile at him as I pat his cheek before pecking it and turning around to head to the bed.
Draco made a show of rolling eyes. "You know never to trust Daily Prophet out of them. He just wanted to buy the painting from Pierre, but he was denied." He shuffled, but Theo quickly grabbed at his hips in a tight grip, pulling him close.
) circled his heavy and tight balls with a feather like touch. It dropped down lower and lower and lower- a tap at his rim and without any warning was thrusted into his arse. He let out a loud whimper. It wasn’t thick or harsh, but it was frightening. One wrong twist and an accidental spell might shoot straight into him.
I snorted. "And that's why you don't let mudbloods become a member of some creature related organisation." Harry would have cursed me, or hexed me, or  glared at me the very least. But Harry wasn't here and I was right. Pansy dragged me to a booth. A lady in full back robes appeared infront of us and we ordered our drinks along with some chocolate. We both needed that tonight. Pansy was gulping down the bitter liquid as soon as they arrived.
"Some case came up." I said quickly. "Sorry." I purposely left out that I met Victor, because the department was to be anonymous. "And I know he met with Victor."
"I just- why do you even know this though?" I pointedly look at Victor. "Was that a message from Draco?"
But what Harry heard wasn't what he ever wanted to hear, for Draco had said. "I'm going to Ravenclaw."
"Wrong answer Draco." He bit his ear and Draco shivered. His body came closer to the table and he realised he was bloody hard. "Now, C'mon be a doll, and answer me- how many men?" He said it in gritting voice and ended it with a loud slap on his right side of the arse. Draco whimpered but managed to not let it voice out.
"I know, you need to let me complete. We need to think first. Hermione is the smartest on here, and I've already talked to her about the circumstances. We'll make sure to come with something." He looked at the note again, when something at the back of it caught his eye. "There's something on the back of the sheet." Draco turned the note and gasped.
"You don't understand, Potter. This really has been a bad idea. I don't know what I was thinking. This is- bigamy of sort. What will happen if Astor comes to know of it? He would throw me and Scorpius, out. Or worse, he would keep Scorpius with himself, out of my life." Harry's own heart clenched when she saw a trail of tear roll down the pale cheek. "This was wrong. And, you and I are women as well. We were going to commit a sin. I'm glad-" Malfoy shuffled around with her night down, trying to find the right end, but ending up in vain. "I'm glad that we stopped. I'm sorry, Potter." She turned around then, hiding her breasts and trying to get hold of the straps.
"I prefer the word - Sir. Remember last time." To put an emphasise he prodded twice on the prostate and Draco whimpered, scratching on the clothed back. Harry grinned at that, purposely missing later on. Draco whined.
"It's nothing." When Draco didn't reply, he continued. "It's just... My father. I don't know what would happen to him."
"Fuck, is that Malfoy?" He heard Ron mutter from side and he gave a slight nod. Harry glared at the blond.
. Draco was shopping, I was just walking and talking cart. I mean, why does he need some Gucci cashmere coat? And what is he going to do with a mirror with broad gold border and some sparkling gems stuck onto them? It just hangs by the wall in the east corridor now, Draco doesn't even see into it. And for merlin sake, why did he buy that blue floral dress clearly made for women?
Draco looked at Harry then back at Hermione, before looking at his hands. "the coronation was going on, I didn't want to create more of a drastic situation."
"Oh, cheer up Draco. Open your eyes." Draco then realized that he had scrunched his mouth and shut his eyes tight. And when he did open his eyes, a large sticky palm went down his face. He could only gasp as a reaction. When his face was covered in yellow mess he was let go.
“PLEASE!” he was hushed and he cried when he orgasmed and then he couldn’t stop cumming. He body arched up as he whimpered more than a whine.
"Good." Harry replied and circled the wet rim with the end of his gun. Draco gasped at the feeling and held himself still, whimpering when he felt the hollow pipe enter in him slowly and gradually until he could feel the case of the trigger halting at his filled opening. He shivered wildly when the rod circled in him around and then he felt a rough hand trail down his balls and pulled at his length. Draco realised he was hard and moaned when a broad finger circled his tip before tugging at the base and then left his cock alone. "wow! You fucking pervert!" He heard Harry chuckle on top of him. He was laid just between strong legs and opened up like a meal for a hungry man to devour. "have you ever had a gun in your arse before?" Draco shook his head. He yelped when he felt the metal inside of him push in further and tilt to side, piercing his walls with blunt edge. "Open your fucking mouth."
I gasped, his tongue stroke at my entrance, lapping at the crack. "tastes like firewhiskey." He mumbled and I squeaked when his tongue prodded inside of me, my hands fisting the bedsheets. I think he was going to exhaust my arse of the whiskey tang. My back arched when two thick fingers joined his tongue, poking at my inner walls. It was way too much for me, he hadn't rimmed me ever in last few months, and now that he was I was loosing all my senses. Another finger took place of his tongue and his mouth then wrapping around my prick, the thick muscle running by the underside. My toes curled when he gave quick short licks at my tip, he then sucked strongly at the head. I shouted his name as I came, and he drank it all down when I was reduced to keep mumbling his name.
Draco rolled his eyes as he moved to put on his pants and trousers, setting his hair straight on the way. "Why are you so adamant about this police stuff. I'm not  satisfied if you say if it's for the stuff I said last time to you. You wouldn't be here just for me."
They both laid panting in sweat, the moonlight making their bodies shimmer. "you'll stay here right?" Draco murmured. "Please get some sleep, Harry." He ran his hand to blonde hair, and Draco smiled sleepily at him. He hugged him close to him and looked out of the balcony. When he looked back, Draco was sleeping soundly. Harry didn't sleep that night.
Lucius was sick. And Narcissa wasn't around. And their son would never leave his rooms. Lucius couldn't stand straight without any help and he knew he was losing his mind when he almost ingested a clearly labeled rat poison as a drink. Then He walked to his rooms. Bald and red eyed, his teeth pointy and no heart beat to bring a flush to his face. "My King." The King, who looked far too old for his age, as if on brink of senile, raised his weak trembling hand. "T-Tom." He whispered. "My King, you have become so weak. Let me aid you." "But it's Dark-" "No magic is wrong, dark or light, black or white. If it helps you then everything is viable." The King nodded his head and Tom chanted his spells and hymns. As if they were called into the room to pour rain, dark clouds surrounded them and a black fog sucked its way into Lucius' nose and mouth and eyes and ears. His mercury eyes rolled back, before they came back to their positions- the pupils now all black. He felt better, so much better than before. His fingers and toes stopped shivering and he was able to stand up. He could walk around and had an hearty meal. But then there was a sharp pang in his head, as if something just bit of a part of the muscle. He grabbed his ears and the temples. "Exhaustion, my King, perhaps. Sleep would be a great help." The king nodded and laid on his bed again.
"I- I didn't do th-that." He flushed, his other hand went behind his back. I huff as I sat a bit more comfortably on thighs, wincing when I felt the pucker of the tentacle-formed-arm pinching my back. "Are you okay, healer Draco?" He called out to me.
When we were on bed, tired and sweating from the amount of frotting we had some against each other on the stairs, he spoke slowly. "Were you truly jealous of Victor?"
There was gratefulness in silver eyes and he nodded his head eagerly. "let's see that A/C, shall we?" Malfoy took him to the back of the room. It was a small flat, smaller than what Harry lived in, but it quite an area for a single person. But Malfoy didn't leave it spacious. There were wide furniture, potted plants, huge paintings, and a glass cupboard filled with books. They were all of literature, he could make out a few wizarding books as well but they were shifted to the dark corners. He saw the white snake as well and greeted it making sure Malfoy didn't know. The snake hissed loudly though and Malfoy rushed to it. "what's it Salazar? Hungry again?" Salazar didn't reply, and went back to sleep.
"I missed you so much, Draco." He said in a raspy voice, hissing his face in the hollow of my neck. I held him by his hair, dragging my fingernails on his scalp, trying to soothe him. "I'm so sorry. I got stuck, something in a web sort. I didn't know what to do." I shushed him quiet. I didn't know when, but I drifted off to sleep. I did wake up in middle and Harry fingered me till I came again, without any cum. And then I slept again.
Harry had to wait for two minutes as his phone rang. He picked it up after five rings. He greeted only to meet Draco's frantic voice, which made him grin. "Potter! Can you please come here?! The pervert, the one who- on the door. He's outside right now! Please." Harry replied with a quick okay and then walked in leisurely till he reached the floor. He looked at the man, still jerking and his head thrown back. Harry casted the finite spell as soon as he was about to cum, the semen staining the floor. The man looked confused, his eyes widening when he saw his hand on his dick. Harry ran forward and punched his on his jaw. He fell with a groan. Harry kicked him on his chest and face repeatedly, until he was bloody and on the verge of passing out.
"I think I should tell you and others at the same time. Tomorrow morning." At his frown she continued. "I know what you think, but I need further information as to if I'm right. Give me a very little time, until tomorrow morning." He nods his head. "till then, go spend time with Draco. I heard his potion is prepared."
It was after we'd both finished our smoke and had casted a strong refreshing charm in our mouths a man came into view. A man way too familiar for my liking, with his buzz cut hair and ripped arms. "Victor?" Ron exclaimed for both of us.
"He doesn't mean it." I say with a teasing chuckle (it was forced, I wanted Draco to mean it even when he didn't.)
"I'm not sure. I've made another batch. I wish I would know before the end of this week. My father's life is ..." He stopped himself from saying anything further. James took him in an embrace. Harry felt a pang of regret by then.
