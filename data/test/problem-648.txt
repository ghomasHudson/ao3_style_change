“And who’s that? You?” Harry scoffs.
Draco laid them both down and slowly, methodically undressed him, with unbearable tenderness. He helped Harry out of his shirt and trousers, took his time to take off each of his socks and placed a reverent kiss to the bridge of each foot. It should have felt at least a little weird but Harry let his head drop back onto the sheets with an elated sigh and absently waited for a sign this wasn't a dream. Every inch of skin that Draco kissed, and touched, and grazed with the tips of his fingers felt hot and restless, and then Draco finally took off his pants
“Well, Mother is in France with family – she says I can come out to see her, but I’ll probably just stay here. I don’t want a horde of Malfoys demanding to know if there is a woman in my life, or if I’ll work for the Ministry like Father.” His knight took out Harry’s bishop and dragged it off the board before returning to its spot. “What about you?”
“Gods, you’re chipper,” Pansy drawled. Draco smirked. “I take it drinks went well last night? Sorry I wasn’t here when you got back, Blaise and I had a fuck date last night.”
“Don’t play stupid, Harry,” she snapped.
“Yeah. Bittersweet,” he murmured. “And what’s more, I got to remember growing up with you as him – all the hatred and rivalry and strange obsession. He might have married Ginny – which honestly weirds me out, she’s like a sister to me – but he wasn’t straight, I can tell you that. He had a crush on Cedric, that boy who died, in fourth year, but beyond that, he really did feel… something, towards you, that I don’t think even he could explain.”
Going into the Pensieve always reminded Harry of diving into a lake, only to open your eyes underwater and see the hidden world beneath the surface. The grey swirling mist that first surrounded him faded and began to coalesce into marble floors and a vaulted ceiling. He was at Malfoy Manor, and there was blood on the floor. A lone figure stood in the middle of the room, dressed all in black, his hair like moonlight in the shadows. His head was bowed, and his whole body trembled like a leaf. Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
“Yeah,” he whispered. “Anything you need.”
Again, the priest was quiet. “The people of this parish know me as Father Nicola,” he said casually. “But my family name is old and carries the weight of years of prestige and excellence. When they disowned me, it was almost a relief. I thought it would be easier to be my own person, not having to worry about meeting the lofty expectations set by my ancestors. I stopped believing in the power of fate and heritage in favour of the power of love, forgiveness and piety. I put my faith in myself, and in God, or the version I believe in, in any case. I think you need to find something, or someone, to put your faith in, to believe in. In time, I hope that that something or someone will be yourself. But for now, you need something to look up to, not just someone to follow. Do you understand?”
Potter blinked and stepped back. Draco let out the breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. Potter nodded to himself, looking away, back towards the stairwell.
“Why’d you want to know about Ginny?” Harry asked. He bent his head to rest his cheek against his knees, turning his face towards Draco to look at him more fully. There was that blush again, and this time Harry saw it creep up from under Draco’s starched collar. Draco shrugged.
“Harry.”
Malfoy, still clutching the towel and dripping rainwater on the hearthrug, met Harry’s gaze. A trickle of ice slipped down Harry’s spine. The last time he’d seen that look on Malfoy’s face, he had just been released from Azkaban.
Draco looked up.
“Uh, no,” Potter said, somewhat gruffly. “I mean, sometimes.” He put his phone away and glanced up. Any attempts to tame his hair had long been forgotten. His wild curls stuck up at odd angles from continuously running his hands through it all day. Draco found that he preferred it like that. He also found that even though it was incredibly late and every bone in his body wanted to sleep, he would stay up all night if it meant being with Potter. Harry. Who was looking at him now like Draco was a sunrise on a winter morning.
“I’m telling you now!”
again.”
Potter shook his head with a bemused smile, his green eyes twinkling behind his glasses. Draco’s gut tightened in that all-too familiar way it always did when he saw Potter. The wave of guilt and shame, however, was new. The last time they had seen each other was at Draco’s trial… when Potter had given him back his wand.
If breakfast at Malfoy Manor was like meeting the Minister of Magic, dinner at the Burrow was like the start of term feast. The house was packed with Weasleys and their partners and children, all clambering and chattering over each other. A brief hush fell over the room when Draco appeared next to Harry, but after a few raised eyebrows, everyone carried on as if Draco had always been there. Ron, who was sitting on the couch with Rose balanced on his knee, frowned at him but, catching Harry’s reprimanding look, simply shook his head and turned back to his conversation with George about the joke shop. Hermione immediately descended on Draco, pulling him away from Harry to interrogate him about his research. Draco glanced desperately at Harry, who grinned and waved, mouthing, “Have fun,” as Hermione sat him down next to her and began talking animatedly about the recent study she had read.
Harry pressed a palm against the cold stone behind him. “Stone,” he said, his heart rate beginning to slow. “Sheets.” He moved his hand from the wall to the sheets as if to check that they were real. “Pyjamas.” He plucked at his pyjama bottoms. Then, he reached out to touch the headboard. “Wood.”
“Shit. Mate. That’s bad,” said Ron.
“Seems pretty straightforward if you ask me,” sneered one of the Junior Aurors, a brash and over-confident young man named Jenkins with the swagger only good looks and privilege could bestow. He reminded Harry of McLaggen, so, on principle, he didn’t like Jenkins very much. “The son obviously got into an argument with his parents, snapped and tried to kill them before running away. Case closed.”
Draco let out a small laugh, tried to disguise it with a cough. “Yes, well, I don’t exactly believe in all this, anyway,” he admitted, waving in the direction of the curtain only to remember with a blush that the priest couldn’t see. His hand fell back into his lap. “My family isn’t exactly the religious type.”
hair looks acceptable and leave soon if he wants to make it on time for his impromptu date with Neville’s mysterious coworker.
Draco huffs in amusement. “So. Harry’s here,” he says, content with the unassuming tone of his voice.
“Well enough to know you’d be brooding on a roof under the moonlight. Y’know, all dramatic,” says Harry, and takes a swig, sighing happily.
Malfoy recoils from the table like it burned him, looking at him with that years-old fury Harry remembers so well. He takes his wand out and puts it on the table and Harry is momentarily transported ten years back as he takes a proper look at it. Without a word, he slips it into his holster right next to his own and perhaps there’s something symbolic there but Harry knows better than to ponder over it or pay any attention to that cool twirl of magic he just knew he’d feel. Instead, he sends a Patronus to the bullpen—he needs to talk to Kingsley and Robards right away and he’s done babysitting Malfoy for the time being.
“Draco,” he whispers.
“Oh! And a nice arse! Everyone likes a nice arse, right?” Ginny wiggles her eyebrows at him. “Calves? Uhh, feet? You into feet, Harry? I don’t think you are, but—”
“Something tipped the scales, didn’t it,” he states more than asks.
“Oh, they’re in touch all right,” Ron says, attempting one last wiggle to break free.
Things between them shift ever so slightly after that day. They learn each other as if they never met before and at times, it feels like sailing in the night with no lighthouses on the horizon, just following one will-o'-the-wisp after another in circles, impatient and hesitant about what they’ll find when they inevitably clash.
And Potter did look. He
Hermione comes over, rifling through the binder. “I had my cake notes somewhere in here—”
, then yes, I do need to take a look,” he quips, Summoning his pouch and fishing out all the potions he might need—Blood-Replenishing Potion, painkillers, Dittany, some Murtlap Essence and a Nogtail intestine balm to prevent clotting. The tiny vial of Dreamless Sleep that he picks up after a second of deliberation is a last resort, in case the process turns out to be more of a strain than either of them expects it to be.
Draco slumped against him, defeated, and Harry immediately caught him into his arms, kissing the top of his head.
, Harry thinks. “I don’t know.”
The only thing Harry can bring himself to do when he reads Neville’s owl is to gently lay his forehead on his desk and groan for a good eight seconds.
— don’t you fucking dare die right now!” He doesn’t care that his palms are burning like fire, that the magic glows red and angry. All Harry cares about is that the bleeding starts to slow down a little, and he smiles hysterically, whispering the incantation over and over, like the hymn of life itself. “That’s right, listen to me just this once, you bastard, and don’t die, not now—”
“Mate, you have no idea,” Ron says excitedly. “When everybody found out, people started coming forward with all kinds of shit they knew about. Kingsley got so angry we almost ran out of Veritaserum.”
Usually, once Harry started to touch himself down there, it was  rather difficult to stop, but he couldn’t bring himself to press any deeper, not with the way a single drop of wing oil trickled down Draco’s forearm, and definitely not with the knowledge Draco was about to fuck him
Luna shook her head with a bemused smile. “It was bound to happen sooner or later,” she said cryptically. “Which reminds me, Seamus and Neville owe me twenty Sickles.”
“I trained as a Healer before I became an Auror,” she explained. Then, to Draco, she said, “It probably feels worse than it is. You have a broken rib, but from I can tell it’s a small fracture, it’ll heal on its own. No internal bleeding, but the bruising will be extensive.”
“Why isn’t your living room Floo working?” she asked in way of greeting.
“I know that!” Harry shouted back. “But it doesn’t change the fact that I love you, Draco!”
“Why get more ink when you can get some?” Harry asked, waggling his eyebrows cheekily. Draco blushed and tugged Harry along the path.
“Could be worse,” he said finally, as deadpan as he could. Harry barked out a laugh. He shook his head at Draco, who smiled back. Harry let out a small sigh and, leaving his whiskey behind, came around the breakfast bar, one hand trailing on the countertop. Draco felt his breath catch in his chest as his heart fluttered somewhere deep in his stomach. Harry walked right up to where Draco perched on his stool, standing between Draco’s legs and looking up at him through thick black lashes. Draco swallowed hard. There were flecks of gold and hazel in Harry’s emerald green eyes, and this close Draco could see a hint of another small scar, a nick just below his left eye from some forgotten fight.
Harry hummed, not entirely convinced. Malfoy seemed to pick up on this and with a huff, he tried to work his hand towards his trouser pocket. But the restraints held his arms at the wrong angle and he had to give up with another huff and a scowl. “Could you… this is embarrassing as it is, but if you could just look in my pocket,” he said, glancing over at Harry imploringly, “you’ll see why I would never get involved with a drug lord.”
“Fine.” Harry couldn’t help the way his lips were already twisting into a smile, even as he tried to fight it, digging his teeth into his bottom lip. “I didn’t promise anything anyway.”
Harry grinned. “What did you say?” he asked teasingly.
“Soulmates.”
Draco looked down at Harry at this. “Cup…board?” he asked in disbelief.
Draco nodded. Harry’s heart beat beneath his palm, and he knew he was telling the truth. He could see the scars on the back of the other man’s hand –
“Can I ask you something?” Draco asked, his voice low and barely audible above the din of the party. He turned his head towards Harry, who glanced at him and shrugged with a smile before taking a long swig of butterbeer.
Draco nodded, his stormy eyes weary but resolute. Harry sat back to let him get up and make his way towards the bathroom. He did look amazing in just his black briefs. “You’re gorgeous,” he called after him. Draco raised a hand in acknowledgement.
“I’m sorry,” he said softly. “I shouldn’t have come. It was late, and I’ve been such a mess, I’m sorry.”
Malfoy shook his head. “I didn’t even know he was a drug lord until you said, honest,” he insisted. “If I had, I would have called the whole thing off.”
That same night, Harry decided to break some news to Draco. They sat at their kitchen table eating takeaway pizza after a long day of moving and unpacking – “How is there so much stuff in such a tiny flat? Why do you even own a
“How do you find it, Mr. Potter?” she asked.
“Don’t you have other shoes?” Draco asked one night. Harry shrugged.
Harry pulled a way slightly to look him in the eye, amazed.
On Harry’s seventeenth birthday, his godparents presented him with a gift. Inside a plainly wrapped parcel was a folded cloak made of a fabric silky to the touch that looked like the surface of water rippling beneath the sun. When Harry pulled it about his shoulders, he yelped in shock and momentary horror – his body had disappeared before his eyes. Sirius and Remus laughed.
Draco’s eyes seemed to ice over. He pressed his lips into a thin line. “Right,” he said. “Good for you.”
“So, logically, you only came when your life was in danger,” Harry said teasingly. Draco wrinkled his nose at him.
So Harry caved and took the file, even though he knew that none of this could end well.
Harry groans and shifts in his armchair. “That lunch thing I had? Neville set me up on a date.”
“Where are they eloping?” He asks calmly.
Harry goes up, his lips stretched in a devious smile around the girth, and slides back down, relaxing his throat and swallowing around the head. The moan Draco lets out is downright
“Is it working?” Potter asked earnestly.
this bet,” Ginny says fiercely, “it’s my turn, so prepare to get romanced so hard, your cock will fall off, Potter!”
“Salazar, even washing our bloody undergarments must take place under the thick blanket of the night, mustn’t it?”
“Good,” Harry says and sends Dmitri to the ground like a rag doll, rendering him unconscious.
“Oh, yes, because everybody would believe my word over the Aurors’, that’s just fucking rich,” he snaps, wrapping the shirt tighter around his middle.
Everything about Maggie was nice, pretty and proper. Everything was just as one would expect it to be in a young girl. Everything except for her shrill, high-pitched, Merman-out-of-the-water, Mandrake-out-of-the-soil voice which she was unable to bring down an octave or two (or five) no matter how many times Harry had asked. And no matter how lovely of her it was to show up to what she had initially thought would be a baby takeover, it was still utterly baffling how the woman had ever gotten her job in the first place.
Harry has been calling Ron all morning, ever since he first read his text. His friend hasn’t answered any of his calls and Harry’s currently trying to rate all the dark scenarios in his head from ‘pretty bad’ to ‘everyone is dead’. He blames himself; for dropping his guard, for letting himself get distracted, and he wants to blame Draco a little, too, but knows he couldn’t do that without lying to himself.
“And a bluejay was what he associated her with,” Ron continues, “it was safe to assume it was his Patronus. Hence the nickname. Symbolic, innit?”
Draco’s tense and he doesn’t move an inch, his fingers shaking slightly as he ties the dressing into a knot. “It’s hard to play a game when you don’t know the rules,” he says cryptically. “All done.”
Suddenly, he notices a figure at one of the tables, at the very far corner of the large room. Sitting by a white oak bookshelf is a man, hunched over a newspaper. He’s clearly a wizard—he’s wearing a set of day robes that Harry would normally categorise as ‘completely outrageous’ but he sets the thought aside, seeing that the man is a friend of Luna's. There’s a flash of a pair of shiny dragonhide boots under the table and a checkered flat cap on his head. Only when Harry squints a little, his eyes still adjusting to the dimly lit interior, he notices the man is holding a magnifying glass, hovering it so close to the paper he’s reading, he grazes the tip of his crooked nose with every turn of a page.
“Draco?” He inhaled, deeply, eyes closing. Then, he noticed a faint wet trail next to Draco’s spine which must have been the source of the downright incredible aroma. “What’s that? Something’s… dripping.”
Harry shifts under him and manages to wrap his legs around Draco’s waist. “Fuck me,” he mouths right against Draco’s lips, “I can come again, I want to see you,” he pleads and twitches his hips to make good on his promise, his cock already starting to fill again.
Draco treats him with a deadpan look as they arrive at their destination. Harry smiles, looking up at the large banner hanging above them:
When Draco finally moved, Harry instinctively slid back to the end of the bed before the wings swooshed past, their heavenly-smelling feathers nearly grazing the tip of his nose.
your relationship with guilt, Auror Potter?”
“And safe.”
skin, and think about him in that way at all, but Harry’s perfectly content to chalk it up to the painkiller Draco hands him while he slowly wraps the bandages around his arm. He downs the potion without a word.
It’s a vicious cycle of blaming one thing on the next and in effect, Harry’s strung so tight he jumps at every unusual sound, or spaces out until Draco snaps his fingers in front of his face or, from time to time, wakes up with a start in the middle of the night, sweaty, breathless, and sometimes half-hard.
It strikes Harry how close they are. Almost too close to breathe, definitely too close to excuse it in any way. He can see Draco’s eyelashes, how they turn a pale blond halfway down their length, how the nearly translucent tips curve upward and glimmer infinitesimally, so fleeting and easy to miss. The scent of citrus and spice is suddenly strong and heady and he wonders if it’s because of that one open button, if it’s cologne or Draco’s skin and whether it’s even stronger in the hollows of his collarbones. There are so many things to learn about him still, Harry thinks, and it makes his head spin, and then his heart stutters as he realises Draco is watching him too, gingerly, like a butterfly locked in a glass case, too beautiful and fragile to touch. So Draco just watches, maybe he has been watching for longer than Harry thinks. And just like a dead butterfly, he feels pierced through and pinned down to his spot.
Draco lets out a shaky, ragged breath and nods as Harry opens each button, unhurriedly, one by one, until Draco’s shirt hangs open and Harry helps him out of it. And then, he stops.
“Mate, if you like someone so much you’re willing to risk your job for them, find a way,” Ron says sagely. “Shit, Robards wants something, I’m off.”
No sound
a moan, Harry tells himself, what is wrong with him today?!).
The next day is a slow one; they’re mulling about the laboratory, and Draco can’t stop himself from stealing glances at his partner (or at least a certain part of him). He’s sweating under the collar and blames it on the heat and fumes, finally settling at a safe distance, leaning against one of the counters.
He comes close enough to touch and Harry’s stomach leaps when Draco goes easily, slipping into his arms and kissing up his jaw. “Don’t tempt me,” Harry murmurs, letting his eyes fall closed for a second. “I’ve made plans but we have to be Glamoured for them.”
“Yeah?”
All those plans go out the window when Draco changes the angle a bit, crooks his fingers just an inch, and Harry’s vision goes white.
“It’s shameful,” Draco said quietly, shaking Harry out of his reverie. “Another Veela wouldn’t spare me a second glance, it’s— It’s a point of pride,” he finished with a bitter chuckle.
“Stop reciting odes about me shagging a grandpa or I won’t miss next time!”
has turned into a non-stop buzz of pleasant anticipation. The knowledge that they have time, that there’s no rush to fall into bed together once again is far more intoxicating than some looming fear that their first time could be the last one. The urgency will be back—every night, every time they kiss and touch, every day counting from today. Harry wonders if that’s what security feels like.
“You’re going to look
has accompanied Harry wherever Draco Malfoy was concerned, ricocheting between them like a stray bullet that never really lost its momentum. It’s been present at the back of his head, along the tendons in his fingers, simmering at the base of his spine, and buzzing around his very core. When they were eleven, Draco wanted to be his friend, he wanted Harry in his circle, and Harry didn’t share that want; all he wanted was for Draco to stay away. He wanted Draco to do a lot of things: shut up, get lost, don’t say that,
Harry gets a call from Ron at the end of the fifth week.
“Care to join me?” He asked with a smirk.
Ginny snorts. “Please, I’m already winning.”
Hermione keeps muttering under her breath as she swipes through the spacious room like a very neat, competent tornado—every pillow she turns over goes back to its place, every drawer she opens gets immediately closed; she even folds the blanket back on the sofa with an efficiency that would make Molly Weasley herself take out a notepad.
Draco glares at him with a raised brow, lazily swirling his wine glass in deft fingers. “Finnigan, Finnigan, Finnigan,” he clicks his tongue theatrically and slowly shakes his head. “I refuse to conform to your skewed image of gay men’s sexual roles perpetuated by societal stereotypes—”
Draco frowns, casting a quick look at the kid. He’s looking straight ahead with a confused expression when he finally speaks. “Are you talking to me, child?”
, why didn’t you go through with it in the end?” Draco eyes him with curiosity.
“What?” Harry interrupts, panic already clutching at his lungs. “No, I need to stay here, the Family—”
As far as cafés go, this one looks so normal it’s almost underwhelming. Not that Harry expected a beast to swallow him up as soon as he stepped over the threshold, but his entrance felt a little anticlimactic. There are more tables and chairs, some chunky sofas dolled up with throw pillows, and more than a few potted plants. The only thing that puts Harry on mild alert is that the place looks completely empty. There’s a barista behind the counter who hasn’t even noticed him enter, probably thinking the waitress is back, reading some magazine and fiddling with a teaspoon. The aroma of baked goods is stronger here, and, surprisingly, it’s much more calming than the lavender outside. Harry files away the newly discovered fact that he’s probably food-conditioned for later, and goes further inside, the thick carpet muffling his footsteps.
“No,” Harry whispers, slowly adjusting to it, clenching experimentally and earning himself a broken whimper from Draco.
The footsteps are getting closer and suddenly, Ron and Hermione are by his side, wide-eyed and terrified as they watch Draco’s wound close up a bit—still bleeding, still deadly, but controlled. Draco’s letting out shallow, laboured breaths as he looks at Harry with something akin to a smirk.
“And,” Harry gulps, already regretting what’s about to come out of his mouth, “is there a potion that…” He trails off, deciding against it.
He stops and takes a few deep breaths. He’s spiralling.
,” Harry growls, “don’t draw unnecessary attention, and don’t call me
Draco, in all his messy, complicated glory is the antithesis of stability. He’s still spoiled like a Siamese cat, debauched like a Dionysian procession, and remorseless in his many particularities. He teases Harry mercilessly and rolls in his victory as if it were the finest silk sheets every time he manages to get Harry worked up. He’s honest to a fault, infuriatingly clever, and witty to the point Harry has to stifle his laughs not to encourage him.
“Yeah, her training was rough,” Harry says, moving to peel off Draco’s shirt, still remembering what they were doing before the short interruption.
“I know.”
Draco’s infuriatingly calm, almost resigned, and Harry wishes he wasn’t. “Don’t I? Here’s a riddle: who believes you’re destined for a greater purpose, treats you like shit, but makes you think it’s part of the grand plan, and, oh, doesn’t lift a bloody finger when you need him the most?” he hisses. “Who is it? Why, it’s my father! Does it ring any bells?” he exclaims, the manic lilt to his voice making Harry back down. “Get off your high horse, you’re not the only one who was chained to an egocentric prick.”
Harry brings his other hand up and cards it through Draco’s hair and it’s so soft he does it a few more times, brushing it out of Draco’s eyes and smiling into the kiss. It’s nothing more than a press of lips but his heart is already leaping out of control, and it doesn’t matter that his glasses are in the way or that the angle is awkward, all that matters is Draco, his lips, his soft exhalations, and his hands cupping Harry’s face. He feels light-headed, transported, and he’s pretty sure he sees stars when Draco makes a small sound at the back of his throat. The initial sweetness begins to give way to a visceral hunger, something he’s been only half-aware of even possessing, and Harry sighs, and holds Draco a little closer.
“I would honestly do whatever you told me to, right here, right now, if that meant leaving this
“I can’t fucking believe this, oh god,” Harry whispered, sliding down Draco’s trousers and pants just past his arse, kneaded the firm flesh, brushing away the goosebumps. “Draco. You’re so— Fuck. Fuck.”
The girls say their goodbyes and soon they’re gone so Ginny can fight the good fight against sad, old farts in ugly robes.
“Oi, stop Hermioning us, you tosser!” Dean cuts him off with a laugh, darting a quick look to the corner to make sure the girls are still engrossed in floral compositions.
to hear about
“I just think I bring out your more... human side.”
“Yes, yes—hnnngh—do it, come in me, do it—”
“Potter,” Malfoy croaks, “do you want to live or
The room was bathed in a dim, coral glow as the sky turned orange—it was nothing like a sunset, more an infernal chasm slowly advancing on their fragile, crystalline bubble. Time was rapidly slipping away, the last grains in an hourglass that didn’t have enough sand to begin with. Harry kissed Draco again as the song slowly came to an end, and he thought how beautiful Draco was, how put-together he seemed while Harry’s whole body was falling apart at the seams. Being helpless was not something he was particularly good at, Harry thought, as he crushed Draco against his chest, the gold ring ice-cold around his finger.
“You’re making it worse,” Draco quips.
Draco groans. “Shit, I forgot. You’ve sucked my brains out Potter, it’s all your fault,” he adds playfully and Harry snorts.
Curiously, Harry thinks how different Draco Malfoy could have been if he was just allowed, seeing him so curious about a boring little Muggle town in the middle of nowhere, examining every detail like it carries the mysteries of life itself.
“Ronald, it doesn’t work like that!”
, more, it feels so—oh-oh-fuck,” he breathes locking his thighs around Harry’s waist. “Fuck me. Make me feel it.”
“Please escort mister Malfoy to a holding cell,” Harry tells the Aurors. “Standard Safety Charms, his wand was already taken. He can keep the rest of his possessions.”
—Harry!—” Draco’s words come out very fast as he struggles to breathe and talk. “You’ll hurt yourself—ahhh,
“Harry—” Draco’s voice broke and a single tear rolled down his cheek.
There were also dangerous objects, ones imbued with old, dark magic—creepy figurines that made an individual cough blood when held with bare hands, armchairs one could never get out of, or an inconspicuous music box that, when open, played a melody that made them both extremely sleepy, and Harry managed to snap out of it and shut it closed at the last second. Every time they stumbled upon an object like that, Draco would have to go all day in a state of constant half-arousal, watching Potter being competent, and powerful, and focused. Draco had a hard time wondering where else that focus could be directed.
They kiss, and gasp, and rut against each other, getting closer, desperate. Whispering each other’s names in a litany of reassurance, a stream of conscious understanding and unfathomable trust.
, and loves to have tea with his mother—”
“Yeah, let’s go.”
“It’s your house,” Draco said with a hint of amusement, turning his head to brush his nose against Harry’s cheek. “I’m just a tenant here.”
Harry sat back in his desk chair, casting a heavy look at the door for what had to be the twentieth time today.
His idiotic heart sped up a bit but Harry squashed the feeling down as worry slowly crept in—in the last six months, Draco had adamantly refused to see anyone during his heats, least of all Harry. During his… time off (Harry had once, erroneously, called it
“I still don’t believe you could grow one,” Harry adds with a smirk.
He knew Draco wasn’t evil but it didn’t stop Harry from wanting him to be, if that meant all those complicated feelings would go away.
Potter looks genuinely baffled and even looks down at Draco’s tented trousers. “Aren’t we?” He tilts his head and smiles. “Because you’re—” Draco hisses as Potter squeezes the bulge, damn him to hell. “—sending me some seriously mixed signals here.”
“Take off your shirt,” Harry says, startling Malfoy out of the chair.
“Show me.”
“Shut your
thing, that it’s not only Draco’s nature but a direct effect of their friendship they both worked so hard to build.
Harry opens his mouth around the first syllable and struggles to get his voice working. “Over me?
Draco stiffens. Harry could swear the air around them has just turned a bit more stifling as Draco regards him with barely restrained fury. “You know,” he says, a dangerous note lacing his voice. “At first, it was amusing. It even got interesting with time, I’ll admit, to play this fucking game of cat and mouse.” He takes a step with every word, zoning in on Harry who’s rooted to his spot with a racing heart.
Looking around his living room, Harry chuckles under his breath and takes a sip of his beer. His small group of friends is scattered around him, laughing and talking, draped over sofas and armchairs, all in various states of inebriation. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna are huddled at the table in the corner over some wedding and florist magazines. Hermione’s bushy hair forms a dome over their heads, locking all three inside a fluffy, soundproof bubble of girl solidarity and hard decisions. The closer they get to the wedding day, the more frantic Hermione seems to get and they all take turns in reeling her back in before she bursts. Harry’s stupidly happy for his two best friends—they deserve each other in all the best ways and seeing the cow eyes Ron makes at his fiancee when he thinks nobody is looking makes the hard road they took to get here all the more worth it. The funny thing is, Ron just might be the more nervous of the pair, clearly having inherited his mother’s sensibilities. The soft side he vehemently denies having tends to come out on late-night Floo calls, in pub toilets after having one too many pints, or the one time when he stared at a wedding dress catalogue for too long and his eyes got a bit too red to blame it on his allergies.
“I… wish I had an answer for you,” Harry says, staring down the neck of his bottle. “We wait. I’ll make contact tomorrow, see if it’s safe for us to come back,” he says, wondering what Ron, Kingsley, and Robards might be up to. Wondering if they caught all the mobsters, if they managed to get some answers that will prove Harry did the right thing. Wondering if Malfoy was telling the truth all along.
After a few minutes of silence, Draco speaks again. “And mister Porridge isn’t a bad person. I think he’d be…
Draco rolls his eyes as if Harry was the absolute worst nuisance that has ever happened to him. “Might as well get this out of the way, then,” he mutters, more to himself than Harry. “You do know I’m in love with you, yes?” he asks, his voice turning quieter with every word. “Quite madly, I’m afraid.”
“I didn’t get to do this last time,” Draco murmured against his lips, and promptly sank down onto his knees. “And what a shame,” he said in a low voice when once again, the architecture of the chair rendered him breathless as his face was now perfectly level with Harry’s exposed crotch.
The next morning, Harry wakes up first. It’s still a little dark outside—Harry’s used to waking up at the crack of dawn to go for a morning run before work, sometimes stopping by a small bakery near Grimmauld. Even before he whispers Malfoy’s name in his general direction, he knows he’ll have to forgo his daily routine—his charge makes an unintelligible sound and turns his back on Harry. Sighing, he gets dressed, making sure to check his Transfigured jacket still holds, takes his pouch and goes outside, locking the door behind him. It’s not like Malfoy is waking up anytime soon.
“You ready?” Draco asked. He checked his reflection in Harry’s bathroom mirror, then went back to the closet to change his jumper for the fifth time. Harry looked up from where he sat on the edge of his bed, tying his boots.
“Define worse,” he mumbled.
look so guilty?”
Harry shrugged again. “We’re both morning people, we both like to read,” although Draco, as Harry started calling him, preferred classic novels to Harry’s YA books, “and, I don’t know, we both support Manchester United.” Draco sometimes slept in a Manchester United jersey when his clothes were in the laundry, in any case. Not that he would tell Ron that part. “I don’t know, what do you want me to say? I have to spend the whole year with the bloke, we’re bound to get along if we weren’t going to kill each other.”
“What don’t you want him to know?” Harry probed cautiously. Malfoy let out a mirthless laugh. He looked up at Harry, his grey eyes expressionless.
“Please,” said Harry, still holding Malfoy’s arm, his grip sliding down to his bony wrist. “I told you last night. We need this. And it’s just the one memory, nothing more.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes,” Draco said without hesitation. Harry set his glasses back in place, throwing Draco’s face into high relief. His jaw was still set in a defensive line, but his eyes had softened as they searched Harry’s face. Harry sighed.
“I think I know where the manufacturer gets their supplies,” Potter said excitedly around the pen cap. He pulled it out of his mouth to speak more easily, forcing Draco to focus on what Potter was saying. “There’s a smuggling ring we busted a few months back that operated out of an illegal night market on the docks – all black market stuff, dark magic artefacts, that kind of thing. You said the potions they were selling required a monthly restock of crocodile hearts at the rate they were producing, and that crocodile hearts are super expensive because they can’t be imported by just anyone, right? They need a special permit.”
Harry cocked his head to one side with a small grin. “Yes, I suppose I did. What, do you not like it?”
“Harry?”
“You are aware of the staff vacancy,” she said. It wasn’t a question. Harry frowned and nodded. Slughorn had finally retired this past year, leaving the Potions Master position open again for the first time in ten years. If Harry was honest, he’d been dreading this conversation, the threat of another Snape always lingering in the back of his head. McGonagall adjusted her glasses and pretended to nonchalantly pick off a piece of non-existent lint off of her immaculate robes. “I’ve asked Mr. Malfoy to fill the position.”
He Apparated to Diagon Alley and made his way past bleary eyed commuters to the post office. It was late August, still summer really, but there was a brisk chill in the air. Draco shivered, regretting not putting on a jacket over his plain button-down. When he reached the post office, he swore just loud enough for a couple of older witches to give him a reprimanding glare.
“That’s exactly my point, Harry!” she said, her voice needling. “What are you thinking?”
? Seriously?” Harry asked, holding up
Tonks, who had been staring at Malfoy like she’d seen a ghost – given Malfoy’s pale complexion and white-blond hair, he didn’t blame her – started and blinked, turning to smile back at Harry. “Just fine,” she said. “But you two should head up to the castle. The train’s getting ready to go back to London.” She glanced at Malfoy again before she added, “You alright, Harry? Not been fighting, have you?”
After that, they spoke briefly about what Malfoy could expect from the start of term, his duties as Head of Slytherin, and whether Malfoy would like to have tea again tomorrow after breakfast.
“I am sorry about that.”
“Really,” Harry said, echoing Draco. “It’s okay. You couldn’t have known.”
One of the cups shattered.
“Well, looks like we are all done here!” he announced, clapping a hand on Harry’s shoulder, as if Harry had anything to do with Ivanovich’s capture. Harry frowned as he glanced at the prisoner. The man had thick black hair and beard, his dark eyes burning with vindictive hatred even as they scanned the room, looking for any chance of escape. When his lips curled in a snarl, Harry caught the gleam of two pointed eyeteeth. Dawkins stepped in front of Harry’s line of sight and he blinked, refocusing. “We got the kingpin and his business partner,” Dawkins was saying, his jovial smile not erasing the distaste in his blue eyes as he looked at Malfoy with his hands on his hips. “I can’t wait to get this one in front of a jury again, let me tell you.” He winked at Harry, as if he was in on the joke. Harry’s brow furrowed.
Draco frowned when Harry came into the café later that day. There was a long queue for the lunch rush, but the look on Harry’s face was enough for Draco to take off his apron, tell his manager that he was taking his fifteen minute break, and slip out from behind the counter. He grabbed hold of Harry’s wrist and tugged him towards the disabled toilet. He locked the door with a flick of his wrist.
“Eleven,” said Harry. “How old are you?”
“Yes, I would assume the Malfoys wouldn’t think too highly of the Church, especially since it was the Church that prompted the Statute of Secrecy and the eventual push of the Malfoy family out of the Muggle aristocracy.” There was a pause. Draco could have sworn he heard the priest smile as he added, “I like a bit of history, me. And I know all about the history of the magical world, even if I could never learn it in school.”
Harry, still cradling Draco’s hand to his chest, reached his other hand to push a wave of hair off Draco’s forehead. “What about Alec? The ex that gave you Amelie.”
“Yeah,” Harry breathed. He covered Malfoy’s hand on his shoulder with his own, gave it a small squeeze. “I know.”
“Hermione had her baby – wait, were you wearing glasses?”
“Harry, does it look like this isn’t what I want?”
“I’m sorry, that’s just wrong.”
“It could pass,” Ron said after a moment of silence. “It’s just a crush, right?”
“Have you told Andromeda?” Draco asked tentatively. Teddy shook his head with a panicked look.
“Draco.” Harry’s grip grew more firm. “Listen to me. Maybe you did know better. But you are making up for it. You are doing better. You’re here now, with me. Okay? Where are you?”
“I’m related to the Blacks.”
Draco tried to swallow past the lump of all his unspoken words in his throat. He hadn’t planned this far ahead, hadn’t considered what he’d say when he finally found Harry, had only jotted down the words ‘I need to see you -DM’ on his initial note, now crumpled and useless in his pocket. Only now did he realise that he had gone to the Ministry to say goodbye.
Harry shook his head. “Not necessarily,” he said. “Memories don’t always work. It can be a thought, a hope, a dream, anything. It just has to fill you with light, you know?” He pulled his own wand out and murmured the incantation almost lazily. A silver stag burst out of his wand, coming to stand expectantly on the hearth rug. Harry smiled at it, the corners of his eyes wrinkling affectionately, before waving his wand again and dispelling the stag into a misty haze.
“Potter – ”
Maybe it was just that one time.
had happened based on his friend’s messed up curls and the love bite blooming just at the edge of his collar. Harry shook his head, trying to clear it. He gratefully accepted the cup of tea that Ron poured him.
Draco hesitated, then shrugged.
“He hasn’t accosted you, has he?”
“No, just my pride.”
Harry shrugged again. He hung his head as he stared at the bloodied shirt in his hands. “Not sure, really,” he muttered. “Still figuring it out, you know? But even if – no one can know.” He let out a long breath before pulling his shirt back on, the fabric sticking to his sweaty skin.
Harry smirked in triumph. But then his eyes fell to Draco’s chest, and his smirk fell away. He reached out and traced the scars that slashed across the pale skin. His fingers shook as he passed over a particularly long one, the tissue raised and silvery, catching in the light.
“Not like this, mate,” said Ron simply. He held the door open for his friend, concerned confusion in the twist of his mouth as he looked at Harry hesitating on the driveway. “I don’t know what it is, but it’s like you’re missing something. I think you’ve been gone too long.”
Draco blinked. There again was that indecipherable look, but Harry thought that, maybe, he was beginning to understand. Before he could unlock it, it was gone. Draco turned away, taking the lid off the pan and adding the herbs before checking on the water, which had begun to simmer. He added a generous amount of salt to the water, then pulled a can of tomatoes and a tube of tomato paste from the cupboard. Harry’s smile grew as something swelled in his chest, like a Hippogriff spreading its wings. It was strangely endearing to see how comfortable Draco had become in Harry’s kitchen. Draco peeked at him out of the corner of his eyes and scowled.
“Harry? What happened?” he asked. Harry shook his head, wild curls falling in his tear-filled eyes. Without a word, he wrapped his arms around Draco and shoved his face against his shoulder. Draco, a little surprised, only hesitated a moment. Then he pulled Harry in close. He rubbed his back the way he knew Harry liked, pressed three kisses in a row to Harry’s temple, and murmured little reassurances in his ear. “I got you, it’s okay, it’s alright.” When Harry’s sobs began to shake through his entire body and his tears soaked through Draco’s shirt, Draco only held him tighter.
“How are you late to a date in your own home, Potter?” Draco called back. He heard Harry laugh, and was glad the other man wasn’t there to see the soft smile spreading across his face. He stuffed his hands in his trouser pockets as he looked around the drawing room.
“It bloody hell is with you, but it’s with that son of a bitch too!” Ron spat. Harry felt Draco try to edge out from behind him, but just as he did so Ron whipped out his wand and pointed it over Harry’s head straight at Draco. “Don’t you fucking move,” he snarled through gritted teeth.
“Thank you,” he said, his voice soft and quiet. “For telling me.”
“You thought I was joking?” Harry spluttered. “Of course I was serious! Why would I joke about this?”
“I’ll be right back, I promise,” Harry said, in the same tone he used to reassure Teddy that there weren’t monsters under the bed. Malfoy only nodded again. Then, he asked,
Malfoy’s eyes searched his face for a moment. Then he nodded once and pulled away, retreating upstairs to his bedroom. Harry looked down at the vial in his hand. He slipped it into his pocket, then joined Kellen at the Pensieve.
Pansy smirked. She curled her legs under herself, content to watch the show. A flustered Draco was far more interesting than the Dostoevsky she was working her way through. The potted plant on their fireplace had begun to levitate shakily as Draco turned on his heel for another lap, and the empty cups on the coffee table were starting to lift up into the air.
Harry dropped his hands back into his lap with a groan. He laid down, stretching out his legs and staring at the peaked ceiling. He liked Ron’s attic room. It gave the semblance of privacy.
Draco nodded. “Okay,” he whispered. “Okay, I’d like that.”
“Think about it,” Draco replied. “We apologised to each other, Granger should get the chance to do the same.”
Harry looked up in surprise. Draco rummaged in his luggage and pulled out a small parcel wrapped in green wrapping paper. He walked over and handed it to Harry who, stunned, hadn’t moved from his position on the bed – on his back with his knees bent up, one leg crossed over the other. He took the package from Draco. He had to struggle to hide the shiver that went down his spine when his fingers brushed Draco’s.
“Hey!”
He had to admit, there was something about the way Draco could silence a room that sent a thrill down Harry’s spine. In that same beat, though, he also admitted that this was not the time, place, nor person.
Harry picked at the label on the sweating bottle with a sigh. “No, I know, I’m sorry. I’m just not used to you being nice to me.”
“Which bed you want?” Harry asked, levitating his luggage into the air. “Take your pick, there are plenty.”
“What was that all about?” she asked in her low, dry voice already scratchy from too many cigarettes. “That was your boyfriend, right?”
“Let me put it this way – the mouse had been properly decapitated and disembowelled, which I guess was why the other shoe was filled with cat vomit.”
“We have to update the paperwork from ‘magically bonded’ to ‘romantic
“But it’s cold,” he protested weakly. Draco pulled back just so Harry could see him roll his eyes.
“Sweetheart, have you met us?” Draco asked with a soft smile. “If anyone understands complicated, it’s us.”
Draco frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Sir?”
. Now, you think that Draco got into some sort of heated argument with his parents – over what? You don’t know? Well, it must have been something incredibly important for him to have used this specific curse. Interesting choice, isn’t it? Not a very common curse – in fact very few people know about it. Why not use the Killing curse? It’s faster. Ninety-nine percent success rate, although if you ignore me it would be a hundred percent, wouldn’t it?” Harry raised an eyebrow, and Jenkins whimpered. “But no,” Harry continued, “he used a curse meant to maim, to hurt, a curse that without the counter curse keeps the blood from clotting and is thus almost impossible to heal. A curse he himself has personal experience with. Did you know, Jenkins, that when he was sixteen, Draco was attacked with that same curse, leaving him scarred for life? No? Why, do you think, Jenkins, would he use that particular curse to kill his parents in a fit of sudden and uncharacteristic bloodlust over breakfast? Explain that for me, would you, Jenkins?”
“You mean…”
“Sure, you weren’t Finnegan blowing up half the things you owned, but Potter, how many times did you almost die?”
“Let me help you,” Harry said, his voice barely audible. Malfoy dropped his gaze.
“Er…”
Harry followed Narcissa into the sunroom. It was a bright, well-lit room, a sort of half-conservatory, half-breakfast nook. One side of the room was made entirely of glass and overlooked the rear garden, letting in the late morning light. There were plants everywhere, on pedestals, in enormous pots, even hanging from the ceiling. A round table was set up in the middle of the room with four chairs around it. Someone, Harry suspected Wilkins, had set out a platter of cold cuts, a chafing dish of scrambled eggs, a bowl of mushrooms cooked in garlic butter, and a rack of toast. Draco, who had just finished pouring the tea, looked up as he set the teapot down.
Malfoy was already in the room when Harry arrived. He was standing looking out the window over the grounds and hadn’t heard Harry come in. Harry sized him up – Malfoy was taller than him, thin and lean, all angles, grey eyes and white blonde hair. His clothes fit him well and his shoes were always polished. He was the picture of pristine posh. Harry bit the inside of his cheek. In another universe, he would be attracted to the bastard. He would never admit that, though, not to himself and definitely not to Malfoy. He tossed his duffel bag on the bed that hadn’t been claimed by Malfoy’s leather-bound luggage. Malfoy turned to look over his shoulder at Harry.
“Harry,” Draco said, getting the other man’s attention and gesturing at the priest. “I would like you to meet Father Nicola. Father, this is Harry Potter.”
This continued for years. During the summers, almost always on Sundays, Draco would slip away from the Manor and make his way to the church in time for the matins. He would stand in the back or in an empty pew, away from the rest of the congregation, then leave before the service was over. The first time he sat in on a Mass, he watched in confusion as the parishioners queued for the communion. He did it once, but found he disliked the tasteless wafer and the bitter wine. The priest had chuckled when he made a face at the wine, and only smiled when Draco scowled at him.
Harry’s brain goes to autopilot as pleasure takes over—he’s incoherent, he’s moaning and whimpering and it’s so unbearably good, he might come from just that. Draco laves his hole with hot, deliberate licks, still holding his cheeks apart, his stubble scratching Harry’s over-sensitised skin. All he can focus on is just pushing back as far as he can with little twitches of his thighs, baring himself to the white-hot bliss that threatens to tear him apart, to the way Draco groans in pleasure as if he’s getting off on it just as much as Harry is. He hoists Harry up by the hips so he’s kneeling on the bed with his legs spread shamelessly, face buried in the pillows. Harry moves his arms, searching for something to hold on to, and Draco’s hand finds his, guiding it to the back of his head.
“I want you to tell me if you want to stop,” Draco murmurs, positioning himself a little lower. “At any point. Promise me, Harry.”
Harry, though, is becoming more and more convinced Draco is capable of much more than just that.
The laughter stops—Draco looks down at his food, now pushing it around his plate with a strangely mournful expression.
as opposed to what they became for that one night.
Harry blocks him from moving completely, pressing him hard against the wall and staring into the glorious thunder raging in his eyes. “What can I do? What do you need?” he asks quietly, pressing his forehead against Draco’s.
,” he says, mocking Draco’s posh drawl.
He ran to the living room where Draco was standing behind the sofa, looking at the TV. He was holding on to the backrest, digging his fingers into the worn fabric so hard his knuckles turned white. Harry ran up to him and cupped his face, looking for any signs of distress or injury but Draco wasn’t looking at him. His eyes were glued to the television.
Zabini stares at him in silence. “Oh god, you’re either going to kill each other—”
” Somewhere next to him, Draco chuckles under his breath, trying to cover it by taking another sip of water. “Let’s unpack that, shall we?” Harry says, his voice an octave too high. “Luna!”
“What I think— Well. I think goodness doesn’t come easy to you. Before, everything was a… transaction, wasn’t it? Someone scratches your back, you scratch theirs,” Harrys says, looking at him with a slight smile. “Like with the question game.”
Seamus looks like he’s trying not to laugh. “Harry, focus, mate,” he snaps his fingers in the air. “Top or bottom?”
“Wanna hear you,” he said, “come on. Let him know what he’s missing. Hear how
She sighs. “Fine, we’ll leave you to…” she looks between Harry and Draco with a strange expression, something Harry can’t quite put his finger on. “Whatever’s going on here.”
want is information.”
Harry lets out a weak laugh and props his head against the backrest. He can’t really argue with that, can he? Of course Draco’s good looking. It’s an objective thing. He’s still a little pointy and… angular, but he’s filled out since they were in school and his bone structure now only lends his features some considerable refinement. His eyes are steel-grey but their hue changes subtly depending on the lighting and, as Harry has learned over the years, Draco’s mood as well. And there are a few very faint, very delicate speckles of warm gold if one is allowed to look at Draco close enough—they seem to sparkle when he laughs, and look as if they were on fire when he’s angry. Draco’s hair has changed since the War, too. He never slicks it back anymore, having once admitted to Harry, after quite a lot of pestering and even more wine, he never liked the look and only wore them like that to please his father. Since Lucius Malfoy has been out of the picture for quite some time, so has Draco’s old hair and Harry felt strangely moved by that, to see Draco finally be his own person. He now wears it shorter in the back and longer at the top, with a tousled, moonlight-coloured fringe falling over his forehead—it makes him look more approachable, softer, more… Draco.
“Are you feeling petty?”
“Are you sure?” Harry asks, ironically, as he’s not sure of anything they’re doing anymore, or whatever they’ll do next. All that drives him is the overwhelming need to make it better, to keep Draco right there under him, around him, safe, and unafraid.
Harry strode over to the bar, feeling he was being watched by a small group of young women by the window, and tapped Draco on the shoulder.
“Well?” Harry snarls at the man. “We’re waiting.”
A voice in his head says, eerily similar to Draco’s.
For now, what they had managed to build would have to suffice—this calm, subdued life interlaced with lingering worry, only further fueled by every newspaper thrown onto their lawn. The wands they still had were somewhat of a consolation in all the turmoil they found themselves in and all the Muggle tidbits they collected along the way were as good a distraction as any.
That’s when Draco hit him with a pillow.
“I want to forget that my father just died.”
“I said,” Draco spat through gritted teeth, “Get. Out.”
“You’re right,” he said. “I was a coward. I was everything you accuse me of being and more. I was pretentious, stuck up, and self-centred. And I can honestly say that if I was still all those things, Harry would not only remind me every day – ”
Harry scoffed. “Fuck that,” he said, eloquent as ever. “Listen, let’s try my idea first, and if it doesn’t work, we’ll both run away to Iceland.”
“Let me look into it, okay? I’m sure there’s an answer somewhere. I’ll go to the library and – ” Her smile broadened as Harry let out a wet chuckle because of course she was going to the library, where else would she go? “I’ll let you know what I find as soon as I can, okay? You’re lucky you got me on my day off, and it’s still early, I can spend the rest of the day there. Oooo, this is exciting! I haven’t been to the library for fun in ages! Or, not fun, but you know what I mean.” She squeezed Harry’s hands, her face lit up with the prospect her entire day off deep in the stacks of the local library. Harry forced a smile.
Draco pushed open the door to the pub at half past eight. The place had apparently been rented out for the event, the narrow Tudor-era building packed with his former classmates, half of which he barely recognised. The pub looked over the Thames, a balcony in the back with a set of steps leading down to the shoreline. Pansy saw him from her perch at the bar next to Blaise and waved him over. Draco rolled his shoulders back with a deep breath. One drink. He could do this.
How had he gotten so lucky? He pressed his nose into Harry’s hair, breathing in the smell of his shampoo, allspice and pepper. He kissed his temple, his stubbled jaw, the corner of his mouth. He settled back down against the pillow, his fingers mindlessly playing with the curls on the back of Harry’s neck. Draco wondered vaguely if he was dreaming, if he would wake up the next morning stuck in Malfoy Manor, playing endless games of chess against himself to try to keep himself sane. Harry began to snore softly. Draco smiled to himself. Definitely not dreaming, then. He closed his eyes. Here, with Harry in his arms, he was safe. Here, this was love.
Draco jumped at the priest so casually using his name, as if they were old friends. “How do I know you won’t just sell my secrets to the
“I thought you used to be an Auror,” Draco pointed out. “Aren’t you all for dangerous situations?”
?” Harry asked, flabbergasted. Neville looked up from the chess board he was resetting.
“He feels safe here,” he said at last. “He feels at home. And who am I to deny him that?”
They sat in uncomfortable silence for too long. Draco’s throat had gone dry. All the words he had planned to say were gone. Instead, only three words ran on a loop in his head –
“You keep using that word.”
“What if he stays here with me?”
“I love you, too.” Draco leaned in and gave him one last kiss. “Few hours, okay? I’ll even stop by my flat and raid Pansy’s liquor supply, I know she’s been holding out on me and she has back to back shifts at St. Mungo’s so she’ll never know.”
“It didn’t want to go back to its owner, apparently,” said Draco in a low voice so as not to wake the owl. “I imagine I’ll probably get a Howler for stealing it soon, but I’m not going to just kick it out. Look at it. It’s skin and bones.”
“We kissed,” he whispered. Hermione’s jaw dropped.
Harry closed his mouth, but his mind still spun. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, gay? The strangeness of the situation crashed into him as he stared at Malfoy. He blinked as a thought crossed his mind.
Before he knew it, the weekend had rolled around, and midsummer was staring Harry in the face. He woke up that morning in the room up in the loft that he and Ron shared on the old trundle bed that was much too small for him, the sun shining on his face through the window. He sighed and pressed his hands over his eyes to block out the light. There again was the pull, the string pulled taut, the cord that, if he followed it, he knew would lead him to that crumbling building in the valley. He sat up, his hands falling into his lap. He stared at them for a moment, at the callouses on his palms, and remembered an autumn night all those years ago, Luna holding his hand and tracing his future in the lines she found there.
“Well,” Harry said at last. “It went well.” He did not add,
“There’s a difference?” Harry asked, his voice muffled against the woollen fabric of Draco’s dress robes. Draco shrugged. He stepped out of the embrace, one hand coming to intwine with Harry’s as he pulled them back towards their seats, smiling the entire time. Harry grinned back. He knew what everyone would say behind their backs, what they were already whispering across the atrium, but he didn’t care. Later, he would frame the frontpage photo of him and Draco kissing in all their finery and hang it over the mantle piece in their – yes,
“Depends,” Draco said, echoing Potter, who smirked. Draco’s lips twitched, maybe a smile. “Some nights, he’s killing me. Other nights, he’s killing everyone I love. And sometimes… sometimes he’s asking me to kill them.” He looked away, frowning at his arm on the balustrade. “Dumbledore offered me a way out, right here,” he whispered. “And Snape killed him. He did what I couldn’t. He killed my last chance to escape.” He could feel Potter’s gaze on him, almost as if he had reached out and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. His gut twisted, wanting that simple reassuring touch, yearning for it. He pressed his nails harder against his palms, his knuckles growing white. “Stupid, isn’t it?” he said with a mirthless laugh. “To still be thinking about it, after all this time?”
“We… Draco and I… we were, er, snogging, and er….” His cheeks burned. God, why had he brought Hermione into this? He should just bury it all deep down, keep a stiff upper lip about it, and…die alone. But then he thought of Draco, and his heart broke a little more. “I think there’s something wrong with me,” he said finally. “I want to kiss him, I guess, I want
Draco threw his arms in the air with a strangled sigh. “If I knew, I’d tell you!” he exclaimed. “As it is, it’s been a week and all I know is that I always know where he is, that when he hurts I hurt, and that there’s a lot of bloody paperwork involved! We had to file as a ‘magically bonded relationship’ with Robards, and if I have one more person ask if I’m having ‘intimate relations’ with Harry, I will scream.”
Malfoy crossed his arms again, back on the defensive. “Dumbledore trusts you,” he argued.
“I will ask that the witness not – ” but the judge was cut off as George, straining against his restraints, snarled,
He paused. Hermione looked from him to the parchment and back again before impatiently scribbling,
something, things might change.”
Down the road, Harry and Draco found a quiet alley and Disapparated back to Grimmauld Place. Once inside, Harry kicked off his shoes and buried himself against Draco’s chest. Surprised, Draco hesitated before wrapping his arms around him.
“We may not know exactly what you’re feeling,” Harry said, picking his words with care, “but whatever you’re feeling is valid, and we support you, no matter what.”
“All of my other Senior Aurors are on cases. If anyone else was available, trust me, I would give it to them. But speed is of the essence here. At least do the initial crime scene report, and if it’s too much, I’ll have Auror Singh switch cases with you, but we both know Kellen would prefer to have you on this with her.”
century poet in another life, insisted that he confront Potter about it tomorrow morning over coffee.
“Yes, exactly. That was it. Nothing else.” He smoothed the front of his button down, and Harry noticed Malfoy bite down on his lip, pulling it into his mouth, as if he was holding back his words.
“I thought you said we had to be in and out. Come on.” He picked up his luggage and made his way to the living room. Harry stared after him.
“No, really,” Harry argued firmly. “He’s a good man. We’ve been talking almost every day since term started. This… whatever it is, it only started at the end of term. His father died, and….”
Harry looked up. His heart stuttered in his chest. Draco frowned.
“Alright, alright,” announced Padma, getting the group’s attention. “Now that we have a couple new members, does everyone know how to play?”
“Of course,” she murmured. They both surreptitiously dabbed at their eyes. Harry gave Draco’s hand one last squeeze before unthreading their fingers. “Alright,” said Narcissa, “let’s open presents, shall we?”
He shook his head.
Abigail frowned. “How bad could it be?” she asked. Draco scoffed.
“Who?” Ron demanded, still trying to get a look for himself.
“Right, of course. I’m just going to contact my superior, make sure everything’s in order.”
“Well, what
Harry’s grin spread slowly across his face. “What makes you think I’m straight?” he asked, setting his book aside. Draco looked taken aback. He frowned, marking his place in his book and putting it on the coffee table.
Harry pushed himself to his feet. “I’ll tell you later,” he said. “Come on, we should head back. People will be wondering where we are, and Dumbledore will be wanting his office back.”
She released his palm and patted him on the cheek. Her usually distant eyes seemed to look straight into him, then, as if all of Harry’s secrets were laid bare before her. Harry’s chest tightened, and he felt his cheeks flush involuntarily as he tried to stutter out something, anything in his defence. Luna opened her mouth, as if to say something else, but instead she turned towards Ginny. “Your turn, Gin! Let’s see those hands!”
“No,” Harry said immediately. “No, absolutely not. It’s a lot to process, but we don’t think you’re crazy. Right, Draco?”
“What is it?” Draco asked, trying not to stare at the pen cap Potter had dangling out of his mouth.
“Like what?” he asked.
“How dare you speak to me in that – ”
“But then you’re sending him back straight to Voldemort!” Harry shouted.
“I – I don’t understand,” Dawkins stammered. He looked from Ivanovich to Harry and back again. “But he was meeting you here. Our source said….”
“Your powers of observation are improving. It’s the second volume,” Draco replied as Harry flopped into the seat opposite him.
“You’re being nice to me,” he explained as if telling Potter that water is wet. “You’re only nice to me when you want something.”
Harry shrugged. He snuck a glance at Malfoy, who was still politely chatting with McGonagall. The minute Harry’s eyes landed on him, however, Malfoy turned and gave him a small smirk. Harry blushed and looked away. Neville raised his eyebrows at him.
Parkinson frowned at his friend. “We just wanted to say hello,” he said, looking between Draco and Harry with narrowed eyes. “Did we interrupt something? The f** try to jump you or something?”
Draco barked out a laugh. “Yeah. Whatever I am.” He pulled his hand back through the mantle. “It’s funny, sometimes I’m more solid, and others, not so much. Hallowe’en is when I tend to be more… here, I guess. Don’t know why, I never paid much attention in – ” He trailed off. He lowered his hand to his side as he gave Harry a quizzical look. “You don’t know anything about magic, do you?”
“Oh god, not you, too.”
Harry stood, getting so close to Draco that their noses were inches apart. “Yes, I do,” he said, his voice firm. “I know because I have him in my head as well. I’ve seen you, Draco. I know you. All of you. And for all your mistakes and your flaws, I love you. For all the kindness and gentleness you have shown me over the years, I love you.”
“I couldn’t, even if I wanted to. What is said here can never leave.” He paused, then added, “Is there something you wish to tell me?”
The end of term was always a hectic time. Harry spent more time than ever out of their room. Between training and studying, he almost never saw Malfoy. So it was a surprise to both of them that, one Sunday, Harry came back to the room after breakfast and found Malfoy pacing back and forth, his phone pressed to his ear. Malfoy’s eyes widened slightly when he saw Harry, but otherwise continued to pace. When Harry caught his eye again, Harry gestured and mouthed, ‘What’s going on?’
The kettle whistled. Draco stood and went about filling a teapot, bringing it back to the table to let it brew. The smell of black tea, faint but earthy and floral when caught, hung in the air, mixing with the smell of the herbs drying above the stove, the cigarettes Draco had taken to smoking, and Potter’s cologne, cedar and black pepper. Draco took a deep breath, let it out. Potter watched him all the while, chin in hand, a lazy smile on his lips.
“How are you doing? Really?” he asked, voice low and soft, coaxing. Draco bit his lip. He was not going to fall apart in front of Potter, his arch nemesis, his rival. But was he, now? No, Draco thought, as he stared down at his hands twisting in his lap. Potter had ceased to be his enemy a long time ago. The minute he had lowered his wand from Dumbledore’s chest, the minute he had begun to doubt, the minute he had been forced to torture people he didn’t even know, Draco had stopped seeing Potter as someone to antagonise and hate. What was less clear was how Draco felt about him now.
“I dare you… to kiss the next person who says your name.”
“Bugger off, Harry. You haven’t met her. She’s…”
Draco’s laugh filled the common room, warm and free.
“It was expected of me, I thought… He was going to kill my mother if I didn’t… I thought I wanted it at the time, but now….”
Harry raised an eyebrow.
“That was a mistake,” he said. “Gods, Harry, you’re only sixteen!”
Draco rolled his eyes and chuckled. Harry’s shoulders relaxed. Draco wanted to ask him more about his life with the Dursleys, find out exactly what those monsters did to the Golden Boy, but he held off. He’d pried enough. He searched Harry’s face, lingering on the pale bolt of lightening on his forehead, on the dark stubble that shadowed his strong jaw, the quirk of his lips. Harry noticed and cocked his head to one side.
Malfoy shrugged. “I expect you keep tabs on me,” he said, waving at Harry dismissively, a heavy silver ring glinting on his finger. “Wouldn’t be a surprise, after practically stalking me in sixth year.”
“No,” Malfoy said. He spooned some sugar into his tea. “I have to admit, these days I’m more gay in theory than in practice.”
Draco gave it one last kick for good measure. Then he turned on his heel, levelling an accusatory finger at the other man.
“One drink, I know,” Pansy interrupted. “Go on then, order your drink, and we’ll go mingle.”
house… But even after, every time I went outside, I would break out into a cold sweat. I was an absolute mess.” He chuckled to himself and looked down at his hands. Harry frowned.
“Well.” Harry interlaced their fingers, pushed their palms together, fidgety under Draco’s gaze. “I was thinking, you could never get an apprenticeship with anyone because Robards had basically blacklisted you.” That had come out during the indictment, but apparently still wasn’t enough to charge him, much to Harry’s frustration. “But what if you apprenticed at Hogwarts? Slughorn’s not teaching – ”
“I think there’s something wrong with me,” Draco said at last. The hand rubbing his back paused for a moment. “I don’t…work like I should.”
Scorpius didn’t like anyone besides Draco, didn’t trust anyone besides Draco, didn’t let anyone pet him besides Draco. Not even Pansy could get past his cold shoulder. All of his exes would attest to Scorpius throwing up in their shoes or leaving threatening presents on their clothes – one had even woken up in the middle of the night to find Scorpius glaring at him and growling as he lay on top of Draco’s chest, his claws digging into the comforter. Draco hadn’t believed him until he got in the shower and saw tiny little claw marks on his chest.
Draco stood by the window, looking out across the grounds. He turned just enough towards Harry that Harry could see a faint, sombre smile on his pale lips.
has – ”
He leaned down and brushed a chaste kiss across Harry’s lips. Harry let go of his hands, brought his own up around Draco’s neck, pulling him closer as he kissed him back. Never let it be said that Harry took any half-measures – when he wanted something, he took it all. His stubble was rough against Draco’s skin, and Draco gasped, wanting more. He gripped Harry’s waist, his hips, tangled his hand in the black curls that had tantalised him for so long. Harry’s hair was thick and coarse and everything Draco had dreamed. As their kiss deepened, tongues exploring the taste of each other’s mouths, Draco wondered absently if this was what he had been looking for all along, here in Harry’s arms.
The first week of October came with a sudden chill. The sun slowly began to rise later and later. Then, one day, Malfoy came down for his early morning tea, and Harry was sat on his sofa. Malfoy froze, brow furrowed as he looked from Harry to the two cups of tea on the table and back again. Harry smiled crookedly up at him and set his book down in his lap.
Draco almost dropped his mug when pain pierced the fleshy part of his right palm – but that was why he was using two hands. He slammed the cup down on the counter and pushed open the window over the sink. “Just throw the damn gnomes, stop trying to hold them!” he hollered out into the cold.
“Shut up.”
“Looks like I’m good at sucking cock after all,” he said, half to himself. Harry, still shaking from his post-orgasm high, laughed.
Harry watched with trepidation as Draco pulled out the tissue paper and picked out the mug from the bag. Draco frowned as he turned the mug over in his hands, then let out a snort of laughter. On one side was written in bold font: ‘Property of Draco Malfoy, Hands Off.’
“Well, no, I just – ”
“To theory.”
“Draco Malfoy is in my kitchen,” he mumbled to himself. He made his way through the kitchen and rummaged in the pantry for some bread and cheese. Draco held his cup to his chest with both hands, watching Ron as he cut himself a couple thick slices of bread and cheddar, wary and waiting for the inevitable. Finally, Ron sat himself down at the kitchen table and took a bite of his snack. Mouth full, he asked, “So it’s true, then? You’re soulmates.”
Draco’s eyes filled with tears. “How can I possibly prove that?” he asked, his voice choked. Harry shook his head and got to his feet, pacing up and down the drawing room. None of it made any sense and yet – it all felt like he had heard it before, as if it was a lullaby he could only remember the melody of. A dull ache began to build in his forehead, right where his scar split across the brown skin like white lightning. He rubbed at it, trying to push away the pain, but it only got worse.
“Does it matter?” Draco asked, his voice only shaking a little. “He’s gone now.” Then, under his breath, barely loud enough for Harry to hear, he whispered, “He’s safe now.”
“You are literally related to him.”
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. Once his shock passed, he said, “Could have fooled me. It really seemed like you hated me.”
Narcissa, not missing a beat, frowned. “Draco, is there something you want to tell me?” she asked. Draco slumped in defeat. He turned to face his mother with a sigh.
“Nott.”
“Harry,” Draco murmured, running a hand through his fine blonde hair, “we’ve been over this.”
.’ And they did. They grabbed their shirts and their wands and ran.”
Draco flinched at the name, but even as he did his eyes widened in shock. “I never told you his name,” he whispered. “I can’t even say it myself. But how – ?”
“You know, it’s okay,” he said, still chuckling. “You’ve been busy. If I haven’t had much opportunity to pull, I can’t imagine you would either.”
“You were…You saw?”
“Alright then,” said Potter. “Draco. Truth or dare?”
Epilogue
Harry’s head snapped up. He would know that voice anywhere. And there, on the landing, wearing all black and rubbing his shin as he scooped up his scattered books, was a young man with white blond hair and soft grey eyes. Harry’s jaw dropped.
“Of course.” Harry shoved at Draco, who groaned and shuffled over to make room for Harry to scoot back. Teddy crawled in next to Harry, his small warm body fitting snuggly into the circle of Harry’s arms. Draco, not to be ousted, snuggled up against Harry’s back and wrapped his arm around the two as he buried his nose in Harry’s curls, breathing in deeply the smell of pine soap and that slightly spicy smell so specific to Harry, like pepper and clove. They fell asleep in each other’s arms, safe and sound.
The other part of his brain, the one that was a 19
“There’s a spell,” Ginny interrupted, her voice quiet but clear. “But there’s only one person I can think of who would know it.”
The owl gave a happy little hoot.
“I mean, yeah, you did. But when was the last time you talked to the bloke?”
“You did really well with him today,” Harry said as they got ready for bed later. Draco couldn’t hide the self-satisfied smile that spread across his face.
About halfway through October, Professor Ashwagandha, a portly man with a thick moustache and a reedy voice, assigned them a roll of parchment on the Patronus charm. Draco had groaned and procrastinated on writing anything, which was how Harry found him at midnight on Sunday, trying over and over and failing to produce a Patronus.
“Myrtle, please,” Harry pleaded with her. “I promise, I’m not going to hurt him. You know me, Myrtle. I can help.”
“You really do look just like him. You even have the same scar, except his is from surviving the killing curse while yours is from the car crash. He was also sent to live with his aunt and uncle, but they lived just outside of London, and when he was eleven Harry came to Hogwarts. But of course, you’ve heard my stories about St Harry – or, rather, St. Potter. I never called him by his first name, and he never called me by mine.
Dawkins glanced at Harry with an expression of,
Harry nodded. Malfoy sighed.
Harry chuckled darkly as his fingers left Draco. A crackle of energy grazed Draco’s back as Harry wordlessly summoned something. Draco turned his head to look back at him. Harry saw him looking and grinned, all teeth and feral eyes. He stroked his cock slowly as he tore open the condom packet with his teeth. Draco whimpered, almost coming just at that.
“It’s not your fault,” Harry said, quiet but firm. “If you want it gone, we can look into removing it somehow. But you were just a kid. It doesn’t reflect who you are now.”
He slipped out of the bed and pulled on his bathrobe before tiptoeing out of the room. He made his way down to the kitchen as quietly as he could. Sound travelled in the old house. So when he got into the kitchen and closed the door, he cast a small ‘
It was not how Harry thought a normal privy council meeting would start. Neither, it seemed, did the king’s councillors, who barely had time to hide their shock behind polite expressions. Harry watched them carefully with narrowed eyes. The councillors had not been pleased to see him enter the council chamber – a relatively small room just off the throne room that still maintained the vaulted ceilings and elegant stonework of the rest of the castle. The older elves had muttered under their breaths with disapproving glances as Harry, uncertain if there were rules about where to sit, simply grabbed a chair at random and dragged it, none too quietly, up against the wall and away from the great oak table. Many of them had not only supported King Lucius’s anti-human campaigns, but actively carried out their own ‘purifications’ of their lands.
“You’re being ridiculous.” When Harry didn’t respond, Draco huffed. “Fine, how about my servant, Kreacher?”
“You said the bond gets stronger. What do you mean?” he asked, trying his best to keep his voice from cracking. Hermione, who had been watching Harry with her own tears in her eyes, shook herself and rolled her shoulders back, grounding back into the academics.
“I swear, Jamie would give Fred and George a run for their money,” he muttered. He sat down in the chair on Teddy’s other side with an exhausted sigh. “They were trying to ‘surf’ on the brooms, so I sent them back outside, sans brooms. Hopefully they can get all their energy out before tea without breaking anything important.”
Ron shook his head and sat back, his jaw clenched. “Nah,” he said. “You’ve done enough.”
He kissed down Draco’s chest, following the curving line of the dragon’s body with his tongue. He ignored Draco’s leaking cock, despite Draco’s whimpers, instead mouthing along the crease of his thigh. He proceeded to kiss all the way down the serpent wound around Draco’s leg. Draco clutched at the pillows as he arched up, desperate for more. Harry kissed the inside of his ankle where the serpent’s tail coiled around the bone.
“Now, my cousin, being a Zabini and all, was always at the top of the social order – always had the nicest robes, the best books, had his shoes shined daily. But David…” Blaise puffed out his cheeks, exhaling sharply through pursed lips. “Everyone loved David. Who can blame them, the bloke is objectively gorgeous. I’ve only seen him once but hell, I get it. And maybe that’s how the whole thing started, you know? Maybe my cousin was just jealous of all the attention David got, of how effortlessly David seemed to win people over with his easy charm. They competed over everything, him and my cousin – grades, Quidditch, who was better in a duel, all of it. They were relentless. Every holiday, all my aunt would hear about was how my cousin was going to finally destroy David, his ultimate rival. Drove her nuts.
They stayed like that for a long while, the sound of Harry’s soothing murmurs mingling with Draco’s sobs. By the time Draco managed to catch his breath and slow his tears, the sun had begun to climb in the sky. Harry pulled away for a moment to grab his chair and pull it around to face Draco’s. He sat down and quickly took Draco’s hands in his, hoping if nothing else to convey everything he wanted to say through the circles he rubbed into the back of Draco’s hands with his thumbs. Draco closed his eyes at the touch and took several deep breaths.
Assured at last, Draco gave his reflection a quick nod. He came back into the bedroom to grab his wand and the two gifts they had gotten for his mother – Parisian perfume from Draco and a pair of earrings from Harry, who thought he had done pretty well given the short notice. Harry furrowed his brow.
Narcissa laughed, or scoffed, it was hard to tell. “I apologise for my intrusion, it’s been so long since Draco had any company, even in only a strictly professional manner. I had to see it for myself.” She looked him over, her appraising gaze seeming to strip Harry down to the bone. He fidgeted, blushing instinctually. “He likes you,” she said at last. Harry’s eyebrows shot up.
“I just – walk me through what happened for you.”
Luna giggled but continued on, dusting her finger along his palm. “You have a lot of faint bow-shaped lines, so you’re optimistic but not that optimistic, happy but not as happy as you could be. Then there’s your fate line – it’s deep, prominent, and forked. Your life will be controlled by fate, and you will have some public recognition pre-ordained from your childhood or past worlds. Huh. Your intuition line is deep and well-developed where it cuts through the mound of the moon. Do you ever feel like you can predict things, or see things others can’t, or do things you can’t quite explain?”
Draco pulled back an inch to look at Harry. “They know?” he asked, more curious than anything. Harry shrugged.
“Because,” he began slowly, “to be honest, I had been hoping this compartment would be empty,” he added with a smirk. “But when I saw you, I thought, why not? I promised myself ages ago that the next time I saw you, I would try to start over, so to speak. So, what do you say?” He sat up, pulling his feet away so he was no longer fencing Draco in, and held out his hand. “Start over?”
“Because he’s my enemy,” Draco replied, waving a hand as if it was obvious. “I hate him.”
This was madness, said the logical part of his brain. A misunderstanding. You heard what Potter said.
“Ron! Please! Let’s just talk about this!” Harry insisted, his hands raised palms up, trying to calm the situation down. Ron barked out a hollow laugh.
‘And I was going to use the
Of course, he then laid awake for hours planning out his outfit for the next day, only to fall asleep sometime past midnight. So much for Zen thinking.
Draco came up behind Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, pressing himself flush up against him as he leaned forward, nuzzling into the crook of Harry’s neck. Harry shivered despite the stifling warmth of the kitchen.
“Oh.” Draco took a step forward, his gaze still fixed on Harry, afraid that if he looked away, the dream would end. “And why do you want to do that?”
“God, today has been such a shit show,” he grumbled. Draco hummed and, disentangling his hand from Harry’s, moved to lie on his side next to him, propped up on one elbow as he looked down at Harry. He reached over and splayed his hand on Harry’s warm stomach, watching it rise and fall with each breath. Harry’s expression softened. “I’m sorry for all that,” he said, his voice just above a whisper. “That was a lot to deal with.”
“Yeah,” Harry muttered. “Definitely not the best moment of my career.”
“…Okay.”
Harry looked over at Ron, who was struggling not to scowl at Draco next to his wife. “Please stop trying to curse my boyfriend with your mind,” Harry said wearily. “Tonight is hard enough as it is.”
“Bloody hell. To think, all this time…
“Don’t talk to me like that - !”
“No, no, I understand.” Draco waved him off, looking up finally and meeting Harry’s gaze. His grey eyes were startingly clear. “I’ll start from the beginning, shall I?
“You haven’t, have you?”
Teddy groaned and dropped his face into his hands. There it was, then. Draco crossed his arms while Harry leaned forward on his elbows towards his godson, his green eyes knowing and sympathetic. Draco had never asked him about why Ginny had left. But seeing him now, Draco began to understand.
Harry blinked. He had expected Malfoy to fight it, to whinge about being stuck with the Gryffindors, maybe even demand that he get his own room. But Hermione was right – Malfoy had changed, and that more than anything worried Harry.
defence,” he said, “you were the one who didn’t tell your mother you were bringing your boyfriend to Christmas breakfast.”
The first month was rough. The nightmares and panic attacks were getting worse. Draco found himself most nights wandering the corridors, trying not to see an enemy around every darkened corner. He promised himself one term – if he made it through one term, he would stay. If not…
Harry shook his head and shrugged. “They don’t really care,” he said, his voice small and quiet. Ron and Hermione knew all about Harry’s living situation, and since they befriended each other, the attacks had lessened somewhat. But the truth was, they couldn’t be with him all the time. Draco leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, as he tried to get Harry to look at him.
“A lot of Pureblood families use it,” Draco said quietly. Hermione and Harry turned to stare at him. He swallowed hard. “Before a couple got married, the family would cast the spell, to see if they were soulmates or not. It wasn’t the only spell they conducted – Hermione’s right, things were different, they had spells to check if the bride was a virgin or not, if there was a love potion or some other magical influence, that sort of thing. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, they weren’t soulmates, but the tradition sort of…stuck.”
“That is what I am afraid of,” Draco said. Harry rolled his eyes and gave Draco’s hand a squeeze.
“Sirius Black and my mother were cousins,” Draco explained as if it was common knowledge, and really, it should be, it was in the public record.
“But he never liked you back.”
Draco opened his mouth, closed it again. He couldn’t think with Potter looking at him like that. He stared straight ahead, his fingers picking at the cuffs of his jumper. “Why’d you decide to return my wand?” he asked, if only to change the subject. Potter shrugged.
The second the bedroom door closed behind them, Harry pulled Draco back into his arms. Draco melted against him immediately, bracing his forehead against Harry’s as they swayed slightly where they stood, just holding each other. Harry ducked his head to press a kiss against Draco’s neck, nuzzled the skin behind his ear as he whispered, “We don’t have to do anything, if you’d rather just talk, or just sleep, I don’t care. I’m sorry, I should have warned you, we can’t get her portrait off the wall, we’ve tried everything, I’m so used to it I sort of forget it’s there, but God, I should have warned you, should have said something, I’m so sorry.”
“Of course,” said Harry in a stage whisper. “Since she’s my co-worker.”
“Oh.” Harry pulled the takeaway containers from the bags. He handed one over with a little plastic fork, “Saag paneer for you,” before settling back into his chair with his own container, “butter chicken for me.” They ate in silence for a minute, Draco setting the immense book aside so as not to get any food on it like the last time he borrowed from the Ministry Library. Then, Harry asked in what was probably meant to be a conversational manner, “Why are you reading that, then? I thought you and Hermione said there wasn’t much else on soulmates.”
“Potter?”
Draco nodded. He turned back, looking out over the grounds. Harry came and stood beside him, crossing his arms against the top of the low wall. Together, they watched the crowd trickle back from the Quidditch pitch to the castle as the sun began to set over the lake. Harry shivered as the cool wind brushed against the sweaty nape of his neck. When the last few stragglers finally disappeared inside, Draco turned to face Harry.
“Christ, Malfoy, don’t do that! And I thought I told you to stay put!”
“Dear God, no.” He pinched the bridge of his nose, bumping into his glasses as he did so. “No, God, we’ve just gotten to be friendly with each other, no. That would just mess things up again.”
“As I said, we’ll figure it out. That’s the point, right? That we figure things out together?”
“Damn it, Draco, just kiss me already,” Harry gasped in a tone that Draco was sure was meant to be intimidating but came across desperate and needy. Draco chuckled. He made his way back slowly, so slowly, to Harry’s lips. When Harry tried to lean in and kiss him, he pulled back with a teasing smile. Harry growled again, low in his chest. He pulled Draco in and kissed him hard, and this time Draco let him. Harry pushed him up against the bookcase. Draco moaned as Harry’s hands slipped under his jumper, running up his back, gripping the bare skin of his hip. He tugged him closer, letting Harry slot right in between his legs, almost sobbing into Harry’s open mouth as their kisses grew hungry and insistent. Draco could feel his arousal coiling in his gut and he pushed Harry away, gasping for air.
“Tell me why.”
He left without another word. He stormed downstairs, back into the drawing room, where the couples had disappeared to somewhere more private and Ginny and Luna were laying on their backs, giggling as they passed a cigarette between them. Harry walked right past them.
“You know,” Neville said, pushing off from the bed post, “if it’s who we think it is, Seamus is going to win the betting pool.” Dean shook his head.
“And your girlfriend?” Draco asked pointedly. He raised an eyebrow, waiting for Potter’s reply, but the other boy just pressed his lips into a thin line and looked down at his hands in his lap. Potter slouched back into his seat, stretching his legs out so that his feet framed Draco’s, his dirty sneakers a stark contrast to Draco’s polished Oxfords. Draco tried to keep the blush from rising in his pale cheeks – curse his fair complexion! Why couldn’t Potter sit properly?
Harry’s smile grew small, and he looked over towards the living room door. “Right, yeah,” he said quietly. “Tea sounds great.”
“Ha ha. So, which one was he?”
He was eleven, nursing a grudge and a burning desire to be the son his father wanted.
“What do you think?” he asked instead of answering. Draco shrugged, not looking away, his eyes boring straight through Harry. If he didn’t know better, Harry would think he was reading his mind – but there was no sensation of strange magic probing his defences, leaving that oily, grimy feeling in its wake. He frowned. His own magic reached out curiously. Just like he would know Draco anywhere, he would know Draco’s magic from a mile away, which is what surprised him when he saw him in that Muggle café. How had he not felt it? Perhaps he was too absorbed in his own worries over that doomed date, or, more likely, Draco had learned to dampen his magic around Muggles. But now, now –
do more.”
“No, no,” he said. “I am an enchanter, a warlock of some renown… in my own kingdom at least. The last Elven necromancer was killed a few decades ago, shortly after my coronation, otherwise I would not deign to bring one of your ilk into my lands.”
“Piers, we should go,” Crabbe said, grabbing Parkinson by the shoulder.
. Malfoy, who was shrinking some of his clothes to fit them all into the suitcase, shrugged with one shoulder.
“Nice cat,” he remarked. He chuckled as Scorpius headbutted his chin. “I think he likes me.”
Malfoy laughed again. His laugh was so free, relaxed even – Harry had never heard him like this, not even when Malfoy was with his friends. For a moment, Harry saw him not as Malfoy but as Draco, open and vulnerable. The other boy stood, straightening his button-down and passing a quick hand through his hair.
Potter nodded. Only then did Draco realise he was crying too.
Harry sat up, cradling the book in his hands. “It’s okay,” he said. “It’s not something I exactly tell everyone.”
Malfoy inclined his head politely, his expression wary. “I apologise for my appearance. Potter didn’t mention you would be visiting. This whole situation must be very inconvenient for you.”
Then, around midnight, he awoke with a start to urgent knocking at his door. He got up, not bothering with his bathrobe, and put his glasses on before rushing to open the door. There, outside his rooms, was Malfoy, soaking wet and looking for all the world like a lost puppy.
Draco cleared his throat. Harry heard the soft ‘thunk’ of a water glass being set back on the table.
Five years later, Draco wondered if he had lost his chance.
“I would be honoured.” Draco stood and offered his hand graciously to the beaming child. “May I escort you to the kitchen?”
“It feels different.”
“Is this what every case is like?” Draco asked with a yawn. He stretched his arms over his head. He didn’t notice Potter staring at where Draco’s shirt, long untucked, rode up. When Draco looked over, Potter’s golden brown skin was flushed pink. Potter cleared his throat and checked his phone to hide his face.
“We must,” he continued, “pretend that I know nothing of Mr. Malfoy’s plans. You will carry on fixing the Vanishing Cabinet, allowing the Death Eaters into the castle. I will arrange it so that the students and staff are safe on the night you plan to hatch this little invasion. Harry, you and I may have a task of our own to carry out that night, but I cannot say anymore about it at present. Needless to say, we will be back in time to meet you, Mr. Malfoy, on top of the Astronomy Tower. We will know you have succeeded when you cast the Dark Mark into the sky above the Tower. Are you with me so far?”
“But then you became your own man,” Harry insisted. Draco scoffed and tried to turn away, but Harry held him tight. “I’ve seen you, Draco. All of you. You are not your father. You’re you. And I love you.”
Draco looked up at him, his jaw set firmly. “Fuck them,” he said. Harry made a noise somewhere between a laugh and a scoff. “No, really. Weasley shouldn’t have outed you, and Robards… well, I hate to say it, but he’s just a symptom of a much larger problem, but still. Fuck him. Fuck them both.” He put his hand on Harry’s knee and gave it a gentle squeeze. “If you want me to march in there and give them a piece of my mind, I will.”
“I called him St. Po- St. Harry, because he could do no wrong,” said Draco once, as Harry leaned his head back while he sat on the drawing room couch, staunching the flow of a bloody nose with the T-shirt he had peeled off. It was midsummer, the air heavy and humid with the threat of an oncoming thunderstorm. Harry would be fourteen in a month or so, and he was still growing into himself, long limbs and bony ribs beneath the pale gold of his skin. “In our first year, he got onto one of the school, er, sports teams – we had houses, right, and each house had a team so we could all compete for the House Cup – in any case, he got onto the team even when first years weren’t allowed. He would go on to win just about every match we had, no matter what.”
’ before he let himself make any noise. He put the kettle on to boil, set a few pinches of chamomile and lavender in a tea strainer and set it over his favourite cup before curling up in the bay window overlooking the back garden to wait. A mixture of pre-dawn light and the glow from the streetlamps out front gave a strange hazy look to the garden, like looking at an old photograph. He hadn’t smoked in years, but he suddenly had the itch, the need for a cigarette. “Stupid,” he muttered to himself, holding his knees to his chest. He knew better now.
Harry was on his feet, pulling Draco into his arms before he could think twice about it. Draco collapsed against him, still in his chair, his face buried against Harry’s stomach as he wept. Harry held him, rubbing his back and murmuring softly, “It’s okay, I got you, I’m here.”
“It’s not as sterile as the rest of the flat,” he said. Malfoy raised his eyebrows.
“What, for asking him to accommodate my disability? No, no, I know what you meant, but you know I couldn’t resist. God, his face! Oh, boy, I promised Jackie I wouldn’t do that anymore, she gets so annoyed.”
“We can’t keep going like this,” Harry said as they sat across from each other, backs against opposite armrests, legs tangled together while they balanced takeaway curry on their laps. “If this keeps up, neither of us will be able to leave the flat, and that’s not living, that’s house arrest.”
“But it was also planned,” Kellen pointed out. “The perp must have known they would all be here, that they could hit all of their targets within minutes and not be detected or seen.”
The war was over. He had a career. He had run into Potter at the Ministry and all those years of replacing attraction with hatred had tumbled back into his life. The two of them had a tense cup of coffee together, then another, then a pint, maybe a bottle of Firewhiskey. It had started as an attempt at healing old wounds. It became furtive looks, secret smiles, and sweet longing. So when Harry kissed him outside of his flat, Draco couldn’t understand why his body betrayed him. Didn’t he want to kiss him back? Didn’t he want this? Hadn’t he spent years denying himself this? Why couldn’t he respond in kind?
“You know I don’t…
Draco’s gut twisted. “Do-Do you want to talk about it?” he asked. Harry shook his head, his eyes already closing in exhaustion. He unhooked his glasses and tried to set them on the bedside table but missed. Draco caught them just in time before they fell and placed them delicately on the table. Harry watched him with one eye and raised his eyebrows. Draco blushed. Harry only closed his eyes with a sigh.
Then, a boy was shoved in front of him. A boy with a face swollen from a Stinging Jinx. A boy with wild black hair and a scar on the back of his hand –
Draco shook his head. “No,” he said. “It needed to happen. I apologised to Hermione” – he had met with her shortly after she visited – “and if I wasn’t so afraid he was going to deck me again, I would have apologised to Weasley as well before now.” He sighed, closing his eyes. “He deserves more,” he whispered, as if to himself, “after everything my family has done to his.”
“I didn’t – ”
“I mean, I can get away with it, I’m Harry Potter, but what ever would they say if Draco Malfoy was not a hundred percent presentable in public?”
Draco pulled her in for a tight hug. She hugged him back. She smelled like Chanel perfume and Floo powder. For a moment, he was back at his father’s funeral, holding her just like this as he tried to stay upright, even as his knees shook and all he wanted to do was crumple to the ground. She smelled the same as she had that day. She had been there for him through all these years, held his hand as flowers bloomed over his Dark Mark, eaten take-away on the floor of her flat after long shifts at the hospital, had even gone to a Muggle pharmacy with her to get a pregnancy test when she had a scare a few years back. He knew she was right. He was miserable.
Harry laughed and snatched the receipt from him. “Done.”
Harry cocked his head to one side. Bruises were beginning to form beneath his eyes, smudging his brown skin black. Perhaps, he decided, it was best not to push it – ghosts could get testy if you asked when they were from, if any of the movies and stories were anything to go off of. Draco mistook his meditative silence for something else, and his frown darkened.
“It’s been a long time coming, mate,” he said. “Good for you. Now I’m going back to bed, I have the night shift at the hospital tonight. Good day.” He disappeared from view. The flames sputtered then went out. Draco turned on Pansy, who was counting out the galleons in the bag.
“I love you, too.”
“Spit it out, Potter.” But there was no malice in it, just fond affection as Draco gave him a small half-smile.
“You know it?”
“What did you do?” Draco asked the fire, his voice small and timid like a child’s. Blaise’s expression softened as he, too, turned to look at the dying fire.
The group gasped. They all turned to Harry, expecting him to grimace or laugh or, better yet, punch Draco. But Harry was smiling that dangerous smile, and the way his teeth bit slightly into his lower lip made Draco want to whimper. He was still a Malfoy, though, and this was Harry. So Draco only smirked back in answer. Harry got up and crossed the circle to Draco. He offered his hand, an excited glint in his eyes as he said, “I dare you to come with me, then.”
Draco’s mouth open and closed like a gasping fish, his eyes wide as he stared into Harry’s, into the hurt and rage in their green depths. Harry pushed off the bed, getting to his feet as he mumbled, “I’ve got to get back to my friends.” Draco reached for him, but Harry pulled away, and his fingertips passed through Harry’s wrist, sending a chill up his bones. “Don’t,” he told Draco. “Just… don’t.”
“Sure you do. We’ve known the Greengrasses for years. Besides, there’ll be time to get to know each other after the wedding.”
“I want you,” Draco babbled, pushing Harry’s jacket off and attacking the buttons on his shirt with shaking fingers. “I want you, I want you, I want you.”
They had more important things to talk about, argued Logic, like the case of counterfeit healing potions being sold out of Knockturn Alley.
Harry didn’t answer, just closed the distance between them and pressed his lips to Draco’s. Draco gasped, but quickly returned the kiss. Small, chaste kisses turned into slow, gentle explorations as Harry climbed into Draco’s lap. He pushed his fingers through Draco’s fine silvery blonde hair, pulling just enough to make Draco gasp against his mouth. Draco’s hands clutched at Harry’s hips, his fingertips digging into the soft fabric of Harry’s pyjama bottoms. Gasps became moans, became whispered words of, “Gods, yes, like that,” of each other’s names like prayers in the other’s mouth.
“But we are protecting him,” Dumbledore argued. He did not look away from Draco’s bowed head. “If Voldemort knew young Draco here had betrayed him, we might as well place a target on his back here and now. If, instead, we play along, he has no reason to suspect him. You see, it is the only way. He won’t have to kill me, simply make it look as if he had.”
Something about Harry’s expression made them both grow suddenly serious.
Harry’s smile faded. As much as Ron knew about him, Harry never told him about his crushes. Ron was good at figuring them out, though, much to Harry’s chagrin. When Harry had fallen head over heels for the head boy, Cedric, a couple years ago, Ron teased him relentlessly about it even though Harry had never said a word. Harry picked at the fudge in his lap as he chewed his bottom lip. He could feel Ron’s eyes on him, heavy and knowing.
Harry raised his eyebrows. Scorpius began to make himself at home on Harry’s lap, turning around to hit him in the face with his bottlebrush tail. Harry spat out a couple of hairs. He tried to negotiate with Scorpius, but it was too late – the massive cat sprawled itself across Harry’s lap, front legs tucked under his chest as he blinked lazily over at Draco, a satisfied smirk on his face. Harry blinked, shook his head, and resumed stroking the cat, whose purr sounded like a sputtering motorbike.
Draco looked him straight in the eye. His gaze pinned Harry in his chair, like a snake getting ready to strike. Harry had to remind himself to breathe.
“Don’t make me say it again, you know how hard it is for me.”
They beamed at each other, their faces lighting up in the darkness.
“Okay,” Harry murmured. “Later. For now,” he sighed, nuzzling against Draco’s neck, breathing in his scent, sweat and peppermint soap, “let’s just…have this.”
She pulled away from him to press a hand to his cheek. She smiled. “Go,” she said. “Just talk to him. Honestly. None of this ‘better off alone’ bullshit, alright?” He nodded, and she patted his cheek. “Good. He’s at Hermione’s. And if I hear you pull any stunts, I will make the Dark Lord look like a schoolyard bully, you hear me?”
“Yeah, I mean, that one is sort of additional, you could say. I really meant to give you the book.”
“I…I’ve been given a task,” he said, picking his words carefully. “And I’ve tried, tried to carry it out, I know what I have to do, I just… I can’t do it.”
Harry swatted him in the shoulder. Draco chuckled, then sighed. “No, I know. Tomorrow, I promise.”
Hermione shook her head. “Well, I have to admit, I’m not entirely pleased about it,” she said carefully. “Don’t give me that look, Harry, you know I have every reason to be unhappy. Need I remind you that his aunt carved the word ‘Mudblood’ into my arm? Or that he tormented us for six years while we were at school?”
Draco, who like Harry had turned at Ron’s voice, stiffened beside him. Harry once again had to resist the urge to hold his hand, this time to restrain him from saying anything stupid. But Draco just inclined his head, first to Ron, then to Hermione, his expression a polite mask. Harry let out a small breath of relief.
“Teddy has something else he wants to talk to us about,” Draco told him, leaning around Teddy to look meaningfully at Harry. Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Look at you,” Harry murmured, the words vibrating against Draco’s cock, already dampening his pants with precome just from Harry’s teasing. “Begging for me. Who would have known?”
“They don’t like me,” Draco stated matter-of-factly. “I would just ruin the holiday spirit by being there.”
Draco bit back the moan his words stirred in him. He tried to remain level-headed, considerate – he almost never topped, and definitely not during a first time with someone, although he had to admit the look in Harry’s eyes made arousal curl like a taught spring in his groin. He took a breath to steady himself. “Have you bottomed before?” he asked, tracing his fingers along Harry’s cheek bone, the crooked line of his nose. Harry shook his head, blushing adorably. “You sure you want to, then?”
A chill ran down Harry’s spine. He looked past the woman, head cocked to one side, waiting for more. But Death had spoken.
“I do, ‘Mione, I do,” Harry said, cutting her off. He pinched the bridge of his nose, pushing up his glasses. “It’s just all so complicated.”
“I had a bad dream,” Teddy whispered. Harry was pretty sure he heard Draco mumble, “join the club,” and kicked him under the sheets. “Can I sleep with you?”
“My lord, may I present Sir Harry Potter of Hogwarts. Sir Potter, you stand in the presence of his Royal Highness and Lord of the Elven Realms of Avalon, King Draco, first of his name.”
“Er… football.”
Malfoy blinked, his face blank with shock even as his shoulders relaxed. “No,” he murmured. “I didn’t. I couldn’t. You know I couldn’t. They’re my parents.”
“It tends to get lost, what with the whole ‘Prince of Death’ thing.” Harry chuckled into his wine. “I really hate that title. Makes it sound like I’m some posh, entitled bast-” He remembered who he was talking to almost a minute too late. He set his cup down, ducking his head to hide the blush.
Harry sighed and massaged his temples. He heard the click of the door as Draco left the room. He looked back up at Ron and Hermione. Ron had not picked his jaw off the floor yet, and Hermione was giving him a look that was both withering and pitying, like he was a muddy dog that had brought them someone else’s toy.
“Oh, so you trust the word of a toddler over the word of your best mates? Great, love that you value a five-year-old more than me and, for that matter, Hermione. I take it went well then, since Andromeda seems to approve – she was okay with it, wasn’t she?”
“Doing what?” Draco snapped, turning on her. “Without my wand I am – I am nothing, I am useless. Besides, I’m not going to hurt him, I just want my wand back!’ He looked away, clenching and unclenching his fists. “Crabbe and Goyle are in the castle somewhere,” he said, his voice barely more than a whisper. “I’ll be fine.”
“I want that to be true,” Draco whispered finally. “But what if it isn’t? What good could come from this?”
Harry nodded. He’d known when he and Hermione had argued. He’d known when he had watched Draco’s memories, when he had kissed him for the first time, when Draco had moved his things from the guest room into Harry’s bedroom. He’d known when Draco had excitedly shown him new buds forming on Amelia the orchid’s stalk, when he had looked over from reading
“That’s not the only reason,” Malfoy said softly. He looked up at Harry, that indecipherable look in his eyes. “I would know you anywhere.”
“Okay,” he murmured. “Let’s go home.”
Drinks with Harry Potter. The only silver lining was that he might be banned from holidays with his parents for the rest of his life.
“So,” he drawled, “you’re the Prince of Death.”
Potter jogged up to him. His hair was wind-tousled, his golden cheeks pink from the cold but not nearly as ruddy as Draco’s, and he was wearing an awful large hoodie and baggy grey joggers. Draco tried not to appear as out of breath and sweaty as he knew he was. Potter grinned at him, green eyes twinkling behind his glasses, which did nothing to help Draco’s racing heartbeat.
“Ready?” Harry asked after he rolled the condom on. Draco nodded, biting his lip as he watched with bated breath as Harry pressed the head against his leaking hole. Then he was pushing in, and Draco had to close his eyes. His mouth went slack against the pillow. Harry filled him completely. Then he kept pushing in, and Draco thought he would burst. He didn’t give Draco much chance to adjust before he was pulling out again, before he was thrusting in even deeper, again and again and again. All Draco knew was pleasure. He pushed back, trying to get the angle just right. It all felt so good, and yet…
“Well done,” she said, her voice lilting over the words. “I don’t think anyone has challenged Draco since he was a babe.”
Ron shrugged and gestured for Harry to go inside. “Yeah,” he mumbled. “Yeah, I know.”
Harry nodded. “Fair, but still.” He sipped his tea, the memories flooding back as his mind woke up. “That couldn’t have been easy to deal with. I’m sorry.”
Harry reached up now. Draco pulled back a centimetre, an instinctive flinch, but relaxed as Harry’s hand came up, his thumb pressing gently into the space between his eyebrows, smoothing away the crease. Absentmindedly, his fingertips traced the contour of Draco’s temple, the sharp line of his cheekbones, the soft curve of his lips. Draco gasped, but didn’t pull away. Harry’s heart jumped into his throat and it was all he could do to breathe normally, especially when Draco looked at him with those wide grey eyes. Harry, emboldened only by the fact that Draco hadn’t yet pushed him away, cradled Draco’s jaw. He searched the other man’s face for any sign that he might hit him. All he found was that indecipherable look.
“Anyone but you?” Harry finished for him. Draco’s eyes filled with tears, but he nodded, his jaw set as he pulled his knees into his chest, like he was willing himself to disappear. Harry sighed and rubbed his face with his hands, momentarily dislodging his glasses. He readjusted his glasses, let his hands drop into his lap, Luna’s words echoing in his ears. “You felt pretty real just then,” he said under his breath.
“I thought you said we were going to miss breakfast?”
I had this idea of Draco being a total Lord of the Ring's nerd in a previous fic, but didn't have the space in that story to really explore it there. So please enjoy me using my Tolkien knowledge in a Harry Potter fic.
Harry knew he would never fit in at Hogwarts School for Boys. He was a scholarship student, his aunt and uncle were middle class, his long-dead parents had left him with his mother’s eyes and his father’s brown skin and unruly hair, but nothing more. He didn’t have a trust fund or family in politics or big banks. He had an out-of-date phone, a laptop that screamed when it turned on, and his duffel bag still said D. Dursley in permanent marker. Despite all this, however, he had made it to his last year. He had a few close friends. He was the star football player for their school team. He did well enough in class not to have his scholarship revoked. Sure, he still stuck out like a sore thumb, but at least he wasn’t getting shoved into trash bins anymore.
“Yeah, well they fucking deserved it!”
“Who are you?” demanded old Bathilde. She blinked owlishly up at him through his thick coke-bottle glasses.
“Our tea! We forgot about our tea!”
Draco dropped his chin to his chest, the rain cascading down hard and fast, drenching him instantly. Just as quickly, however, he felt himself awash with warmth as he was swathed in Drying and Impervious charms. He didn’t need to look, didn’t need to hear a word to know that Harry had cast both of them without a wand, without an incantation. He could feel it rippling through their new bond, the sheer power leaving a metallic taste in his mouth.
“Good to know your cleaning charms aren’t like your vanishing charms, I definitely couldn’t go back to work shirtless and you still owe me a pair of pants. I would rather not add this shirt to the list,” Draco teased. Harry rolled his eyes. He pecked Draco on the corner of the mouth, making a pale pink blush spread across Draco’s high cheekbones.
“Maybe having a sibling would have knocked you off your high horse sooner,” Harry pointed out with a teasing grin.
“I didn’t even know they were together,” Draco murmured. Harry and Hermione both let out soft, weak little chuckles.
“Father’s trial didn’t go well. Embezzlement charges means five years in jail, and,” he added in a deep mockingly patronising voice, “‘We cannot afford any more attention from the press. The last thing our family needs is an exposé on the Malfoy heir.’” He dropped his head into his hands, tangling his fingers in his hair as he continued in his normal voice, “Just have to keep my head down, carry on. Same thing he said when I left. I can’t imagine what he would say if… well.”
Draco dropped his fork. A couple of heads turned, but the chatter didn’t stop. Draco turned bright red as Harry grinned and leaned back, his job done. Draco sipped his wine and glared at Harry over his glass. “You are the worst,” he muttered as he set his glass back down. Harry only grinned wider.
Harry’s brow furrowed.
“Oh.” Harry set his glass down on the countertop. “You didn’t know?”
Harry took a deep breath. He tightened his grip on the takeaway coffee, the heat burning against his palms. Right then.
Harry pushed the door open fully, revealing Draco standing just behind him, his sweaty hand still clutching Harry’s. Dumbledore, to his credit, did not look that surprised to see Draco. Instead, he gestured for the two of them to come in and take a seat.
When they went through, dusting the ash from their clothes as they stepped into Malfoy’s flat, Harry explained, “We have to be in and out, so just grab what you need.” He looked around, his wand at the ready. The officer guarding the flat nodded at him from his post beside the fireplace, and Harry nodded back.
The journey begins... or starts to begin, anyway.
A pale hand shot out and pulled the empty chair across from him out. Malfoy sat down heavily, crossed his ankle over his knee, and leaned his head in his hand as he grinned at Harry.
The room grew quiet. The winter winds rattled the windows as the night settled in, the only light left in the room coming from the crackling fire. Draco held the pillow to his chest as he traced Harry’s features with his worried eyes. He leaned forward and stroked the crooked line of Harry’s nose with his finger. Harry gave him a confused, side-long look.
“Not just any girl, Harry,” Ron insisted. “She’s amazing. She’s super smart, she’s trying to get into Oxford, or Cambridge, and she has all these ideas for political reform…”
“It’s fine,” Draco murmured, “it’s fine, just, please….” He didn’t know what he wanted from Harry, just knew that if Harry asked about them in that moment, it would be over. Harry seemed to understand. He rested his forehead against Draco’s chest, the only acknowledgement Draco needed, that later, later they would talk, but not now, please not now.
Immediately, the darkness in Dumbledore’s lined and wrinkled face disappeared, replaced with his benign smile.
“Sugar.”
Later that night, as the children drowsed on the couches and the adults broke out the spiked eggnog, Draco let himself be pulled into Harry’s side as they sat around the dining table with the others. He rested his head on Harry’s shoulder, closing his eyes for a moment with a content sigh. Harry played with the hair on the back of Draco’s neck, marvelling at how long it had grown since Draco had shown up at Hogwarts. The rest of the Weasley’s shook their heads at the sappy couple, some with knowing smiles and the others with disbelieving frowns. Harry didn’t mind, and Draco didn’t seem to notice. Finally, Ron and Hermione had to go and put Rose to bed, and many of the other parents followed suit. Teddy protested when Andromeda woke him up from where he had passed out on the couch, still wearing his leather jacket, but Harry came over and promised to come see him soon, after which Teddy reluctantly let himself be led away by his grandmother. Draco watched them, having gotten up sleepily to watch from the doorway. Harry gave him a funny look.
“Not your most inventive of insults, if I’m honest,” Harry said hoarsely.
“I can explain,” he began.
Later that night, Harry would come back to the Gryffindor common room to find the victory party in full swing. When Ginny ran up and flung herself into his arms, he kissed her. He tried not to think of what he wanted, only what was in front of him. The rest would come.
Harry waved his wand. The takeaway put their lids back on and set themselves into their plastic bags, tying neat little bows with the handles. He got up and walked around the desk towards Draco, taking careful steps as if he was approaching an injured animal. He stopped next to Draco’s chair, pushed it out and turned Draco towards him with gentle hands.
“It reminds me a bit of Hogwarts,” Harry said, catching the expression on Draco’s pointed face. Draco nodded. It did look like a slightly modernised Hogwarts. “It also weirdly reminds me of my cupboard from when I lived with the Dursleys,” Harry continued. He gestured with his glass at the sloping ceilings. “I think it’s how close the ceilings are in some parts. At least there aren’t too many spiders.”
“Hey now.” Harry poked Draco in the chest. “I’m not poor. I’m middle class, thank you very much.” But Draco was still spiralling, Harry could tell by the panicked look creeping into his eyes. He uncurled himself and reached out to take Draco’s face in his hands. “Hey, hey. It’s okay. Yes, you were a dick. But it’s okay. I forgive you.”
Kellen gave him a sympathetic look over her horn-rimmed glasses. “Of course, sir. Send Humphries if you need anything.”
“Dinner,” the king said. “Are you hungry?”
He still grimaced when he felt Harry very pointedly rub his nose on Draco’s shoulder. “I take it back, I hate you,” he muttered. Harry kissed his neck just above his collar. Draco rolled his eyes. The man knew all his weak spots. They were quiet for a moment, still holding each other as they stood there in the small toilet, trying to ignore the stale smell of urine and cleaning product. Finally, Draco asked, “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Not if you’re going to be like that about it!” Draco crossed his arms when Harry pouted at him. “Your sad faces aren’t going to sway me on this. For Merlin’s sake, Harry, this is more than just you, you realise that, don’t you? Who knows how many other LGBTQ people in the Ministry are struggling because of conservative, bigoted policy? But if Harry Potter says something,
Draco turned his head to watch Harry’s reaction. Harry blinked a few times, frowned, seemed to review all of his memories of Teddy in his head, and nodded to himself, his chin digging slightly into Draco’s shoulder. “Okay,” he said. “Yeah. So, what’s the problem? You know we would be fine with that, so there’s got to be something else. Am I right?”
As they came into the atrium, however, it seemed that word had gotten round that Harry Potter had arrived, with Draco Malfoy. People turned to stare openly at them as they made their way around the room. In the corner of his eye, Harry saw Draco raise his chin a little. The proud tilt of his head was enough for a number of people to look away, but not all. Harry gave Draco an encouraging smile. Draco’s returning smile was tight, his silver eyes flashing as he leaned in and whispered in Harry’s ear, “Don’t you dare leave me for a second in this pit of vipers.”
“Can I get you anything? Water? Something to eat?”
In his office, he filled the kettle with water and lit the stove fire. Going through the tea-making process helped him wake up properly, reminded him of the less unpleasant parts of his childhood, of quiet mornings at 4 Privet Drive before the Dursleys woke up. Once he had everything set up, the kettle on the stove, he sat down in his desk chair with a soft groan.
Potter sighed and pulled his knees up into his chest. “Sorry,” he said, his voice muffled by the glass. “Got a lot on my mind.”
Harry took a deep breath. “Your voice,” he murmured. “Heartbeat. Wind outside.”
“Yes, but he’s your godson,” Draco argued.
“How have you been, mate?” Ron asked. Rose had grabbed one of his fingers with her chubby hand, but he didn’t seem to notice. “We haven’t heard from you in ages.”
curse on you!” Malfoy snapped. “We both did things we regret. That’s it.”
“No.” Malfoy’s voice was barely recognisable, twisted and choked as it was. “No one can help me! I have to do this on my own! I have to….” But what Malfoy had to do was cut off by his own sobs. Harry pushed the door open a bit more, leaning in to look.
Father Nicola was quiet for a moment. Then, with a small nod, he whispered, “You’ve chosen well, my son. I will leave you now. I’ll be in the back if you need me. Besides, I think you need to save our Saviour from old Bathilde.” He gave Draco’s arm a squeeze before walking away to a small door in the back of the nave, leaving Draco to rescue Harry from the crone waving her gnarled arthritic finger in his face.
Harry frowned. “Like who?”
“I know you are.” Harry pulled away just enough to rise up on his tiptoes and give Draco a quick kiss. “We’ll be alright, though. One day at a time, okay?”
“I refuse to ruin another pair of trousers,” he said when Harry frowned at him. Harry’s pupils were blown wide with lust, his hair even more of a mess than usual, and Draco couldn’t look away from the erection straining the front of Harry’s jeans. He knew exactly what it felt like, what it tasted like, and gods he wanted it in him as soon as possible. “Bedroom,” he said. “Now.”
“The biscuits, Draco.” Still, Harry didn’t turn around, didn’t lower onto the soles of his feet, just stayed stretched out like that as Draco stood there and stared. Draco swallowed and licked his dry lips.
“So let’s not treat him like he chose Azkaban, alright? The war’s over. Let’s just try to move on, okay?” Harry levelled his gaze at each of the other boys in turn until they all either looked away or nodded. “Right. How about this – we try Zacharias’s idea, and if anyone wants to switch rooms at any time, we can switch. How does everyone feel about that?”
. And that is precisely why I’ve been, as you put it, avoiding you.”
Harry let out the breath he’d been holding. He pulled Draco into his arms, leaning their foreheads together, breathing and shaking together. “Are you okay?” Harry murmured, peppering kisses on Draco’s cheeks, his forehead, the corners of his mouth. Draco nodded. He brushed away the drying tear tracks on Harry’s cheeks – when had he started crying?
“No, no, there’s got to be something else – ”
He looked up at the sound of the door, but when he saw who it was, he sighed and closed his book.
Maybe later he would bring him a moth.
Ron’s hand holding his wand shook. He readjusted his grip and took a broken, trembling breath. Harry turned fully to Draco. “I didn’t know that about Lucius,” he said quietly. Draco blinked, wiped away the tears with the heel of his palm.
“Anyway, in his first year, Harry stopped and accidentally killed a professor who had become possessed by the Dark Lord in an attempt to reclaim his body. In his second year, he stopped a phantom version of the Dark Lord from setting a Basilisk – a really big, evil snake – on all the Muggle-born students. Third year was a mess – there was an escaped convict who turned out to be Harry’s godfather, there were Dementors, a werewolf. Then in fourth year, the year of the Triwizard Tournament, the Dark Lord returned, and a student was killed. The Dark Lord began amassing his army again – Harry and his friends tried to stop him, but in reality they only bought themselves some time, and in the process, Harry’s godfather was killed and my father was imprisoned for supporting the Dark Lord. Because, you see, I’m not the hero in this story – I’m the villain.
“Just get over here, you’re making me nervous.”
“Just the one today, though,” he pointed out. “And I got an owl out of it. All things considered, it’s an improvement.”
“Draco Malfoy is the new Potions Master,” he said, more slowly this time. Ron’s jaw dropped. Hermione, on the other hand, simply nodded.
“Yeah, Sirius left it to me. He was my godfather.” He paused. “How do you know about it?”
Draco added the chopped carrot to the pan, pushing it around with a spoon to sauté with the onions and garlic. When he finally turned around, he let out a long begrudging sigh.
Praxis: practice, as distinguished from theory; the process by which a theory is realised. (Wikipedia, Oxford Languages).
Harry sighed. He got up to go and kneel in front of the fire. Draco hesitated, then joined him – Harry’s Gryffindor nature must be rubbing off on him, not that he would ever admit it. Hermione’s eyes narrowed for a moment. Then she turned to Harry and pretended to ignore Draco entirely.
“I’m fine,” he insisted, his voice already a little clearer. Kellen nodded begrudgingly. Draco struggled to his feet, Harry holding him up with an arm around his waist. “I just want to go home,” he said in a low voice to Harry, who nodded.
“My apologies, it’s been a long day. Who are you?” he asked, as politely as he could. The woman’s lips twitched, just a hint of a smile.
Draco dismissed her with a wave of his hand. “No, they’ve given up on that,” he said quickly. “You break one chandelier and you don’t get asked back for Christmas.”
war.”
“We’ll figure this out.”
“Yeah.” Draco pulled him impossible closer, their noses brushing. “I’m here. I’m here.”
Harry looked up from his ministrations with a small frown. His eyes were lust-blown, almost entirely swallowed by black pupil. His glasses were smudged and sat a bit crooked on his nose. “Then why did you stay away for so long?” he asked.
“What?” he spluttered. “Hermione and I haven’t even met the bloke and you’re introducing him to Teddy? Merlin’s tits, he better not be a fucking psycho killer or something!”
“Let’s do this again,” Harry said, his voice coming out a little rougher than he’d meant. Malfoy’s blush spread to the tips of his ears. “Get a drink with me next weekend?”
“Is someone with you, Harry?” Hermione asked with a small frown. Ron tried to lean in and look further into Harry’s office, but Hermione pulled him back. Rose took this chance to make a bid for freedom, so Hermione had to simultaneously restrain her toddler and her husband at the same time. Harry bit his lip, and nodded.
Malfoy nodded and disappeared into the flat. Harry let his head fall against his crossed arms with a sigh of relief. Why had he come in the first place? The answer came almost immediately – to be polite. They were his friends. That and his therapist had told him to socialise more. It wasn’t being social that was the problem, he had pointed out to her, it was the crowds. She had frowned and told him to practice his breathing and try anyway.
Harry watched Malfoy’s Adam apple bob as he swallowed. Instead of saying anything, Malfoy simply nodded, and sidestepped out of Harry’s reach. “I’ll owl you,” he mumbled. Then he hurried off to the back of the café, disappearing behind a swinging door leading to the tiny kitchen. Harry buried his face in his hands.
Ron and Hermione nodded and stood, soldiers trained too young. Soon enough, they were one and Kellen was stepping through the flames. She closed the connection behind her, and before she could ask, Harry said,
“Hermione’s right. I don’t want to believe it for Ginny’s sake, but…” Harry’s laugh was soft, broken. “I can’t say I’m surprised.”
Harry, fifteen and still growing into himself, had grown quiet. The cosy room at the top of the second tallest tower – the tallest being reserved for the astronomers – suddenly fell cold despite the merry fire in the grate. Harry shivered and looked out the window to the lake, where his friends were helping the half-giant Hagrid feed a host of grindylows that had been forced out of their native loch and relocated to Hogwarts. The sorcerer, his blue eyes sharp even as he smiled kindly at Harry, leaned forward across the book-strewn table.
“No, a Squib, I’m afraid. My family wasn’t pleased. They disowned me and, finding myself on the street, I took to the church instead. You could say it was the rebel in me, wanting to join the very institution that had condemned many of my ancestors to be burned alive, but, in a way, divinity is a bit like magic, just not a kind we can practice.”
Draco shook his head with a tiny, disparaging smile. He could just imagine what kind of antics a drunken Harry could get up to. Harry watched him pet Scorpius for a moment, waiting for Draco to say something. When it became apparent that Draco wasn’t going to explain himself, Harry sighed and sat up, grabbing Draco’s hand to force him to stop petting the cat. Draco’s gut clenched. Still, he didn’t dare look up, even though he could feel Harry’s heavy gaze on him.

Draco stopped asking about the injuries after a while. Instead, he would sit with Harry, and tell him stories about a boy he knew, another boy named Harry. He would tell him how this other Harry had gotten into the worst trouble, only to get out of it just as easily.
Draco turned back to his onions, but Harry still caught the soft smile he tried to hide. Harry grinned and shook his head. The knowledge that Draco was an absolute sap was Harry’s little secret. His heart soared as he hummed to himself, putting the slices of aubergine in a bowl for later. Draco raised an eyebrow, but Harry just beamed at him. He was too happy to explain.
Draco beamed.
“Go on, then,” Potter whispered, daring him with his eyes, still glittering with unshed tears. A shiver ran down Draco’s spine, and it wasn’t from the chill. Distantly, he heard the clock chime one.
Harry shrugged. “I mean, it might not work out, but it’s an option,” he said, trying to wave it off even as he blushed. But Draco suddenly got up and made his way around the kitchen table to climb into Harry’s lap. “Oh, okay, hello.”
A dragon spread its wings across his chest, mouth open in a snarl. Its tail curled down towards his belly button. Here and there, a pale scar could be seen, but the rest were covered by ink. Harry raised his eyebrows in shock.
“Okay,” Draco murmured at last. “Okay. Let’s try.”
“Right. Good. Okay then,” said Draco, even as everything inside him shattered. Harry looked up one last time. Draco wrapped his arms around his waist to hold himself together even as the broken look in Harry’s eyes made him want to drop to his knees and sob. No, please, he wanted to plead, don’t listen to me, don’t leave me, stay, for gods’ sake, stay. But instead, he turned away, stared out at the garden lit by the hazy city dawn. He heard Harry heave a long, heavy sigh.
“It’s got to be some highly trained assassin,” said Kellen as they stared at the board covered with their notes and evidence photos. Her Auror robes were draped over her chair, and she was wearing a fashionable navy sailor’s uniform, complete with high-waisted trousers with golden buttons and a little white scarf tied around her neck. “Someone who can get in anywhere undetected.”
Malfoy lowered his half-eaten biscuit. His lips grew thin, his grey eyes shadowed. He drew in a deep, shuddering breath.
From an upstairs window, a pale figure watched him go, before flickering out of existence as the clock struck midnight.
it say?” Harry prompted her. Draco lowered his hands just enough to see Hermione’s reaction. She pursed her lips and dropped her head, scanning the text in front of her.
Parkinson seemed to realise too late that he had bitten off more than he could chew. He looked at something over Harry’s shoulder and blanched. From behind him, Harry could sense several of his teammates at his back.
“Uh huh. Oh, by the way, I got you something.”
Draco hesitated. Then, “I’m not broken.”
But Draco had already turned away. He forced himself not to run up the stairs to the boy’s dormitories, not to slam the door like a petulant five-year-old. No one else was up there yet, but he still clambered into his four poster and drew the curtains tight around the bed, casting a hurried
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes. But when he kissed him, Draco could feel him grinning against his mouth, could drown in the joy of it all, their hearts beating in time. One, two.
. When the mist cleared, however, Harry stood in the Forbidden Forest, in the clearing where the Death Eaters had set up camp, where Harry – Voldemort wasn’t there. He must have been in the Shrieking Shack with Nagini at this point. Draco paced at the edge of the clearing, his mother watching him as she wrung her hands. When Harry drew closer, he could see from his expression that Draco was screwing himself up to do something, a determined but anxious twist to his mouth, the crease set between his brows.
“WHAT?”
“Merlin, Hermione, let the man speak!” Ron interjected at last with a laugh. He wiggled his finger free from Rose’s clutches so he could rest his hand on Hermione’s shoulder, a silent reminder for her to breathe. He turned back to Harry with a grin. “We haven’t seen a lot of other adults recently. Well, other adults who aren’t parents as well. We just started Rose at the new wizarding preschool, so you can imagine.”
“Pansy. When she was beating me up she said that the best thing for me was going back to Hogwarts thinking the love of his life was better off without him.” Draco looked down at his hands, pressing himself as much into the corner of the couch as he could. Harry sucked in a breath. “I… I just needed to know… It’s stupid, I’m sorry, I should go.”
“What is wrong with me?” he choked out, his words muffled against her shoulder. Hermione was quiet. She kept rubbing his back, up and down.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, his voice rough from suppressed desire. Just the sound made Draco want to weep in frustration.
Draco stood there, long after the pad of Harry’s footsteps drifted away, and the crack of his Apparition faded into the early hours of the morning. He stood there, watching the pale sunrise creep into the garden, where the daffodils nodded their heads at him. He stood there, until the tears on his cheeks dried and each breath didn’t break his ribs apart. Then he turned away.
“I just… want to hear your side of it,” he said at last. “I want to understand. You’ve been Marked, haven’t you?”
“I know it’s late,” said Malfoy, pushing his wet hair out of his face, “but can I come in?”
And for his part, he kept his word. Then, on the Beltane before his nineteenth birthday, Harry tumbled into the drawing room, flushed and out of breath. He called for Draco as he straightened up, looking around the familiar old room. Draco’s pale figure appeared in the doorway with a curious look. Harry grinned at him.
“I’ll be with you the whole time,” Harry said under his breath. “Promise.”
Harry smiled fondly at him. He sat on the arm of the chair and stroked the sleeping owl with one finger. The owl opened one bleary yellow eye, let out a low hoot, then went back to sleep.
Pansy’s expression softened. She stepped in front of him, planting her small hands on his narrow shoulders. “Draco,” she said, “I’ve seen you grow up these last few years. I don’t think you can lose who you are again. You’ve fought too hard to find yourself in the first place. You’re not eighteen anymore. You are Draco fucking Malfoy, and nothing and no one is going to change that, not even Saint Potter. You hear me?”
