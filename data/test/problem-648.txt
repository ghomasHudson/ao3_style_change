Voldemort conjured a table and chairs in the center of the room, and laughed as the boy began crawling towards it.  He was getting dirtier from the dirt on the floor and his robe ripped when it caught on a loose brick in the floor with a jagged edge.
“The bracelet does two things,” Corelian said.  “If Asheera was ever in danger, my bracelet would heat up to alert me to it.  If she ever cheated on me, my bracelet would become ice cold to alert me of her infidelity.”
“I admit it does seem a bit strange,” Severus said, “but at the moment I find trying to make sure my godson doesn’t die to be a priority.”
Unbeknownst to any of the bell tower’s occupants, their conversation was overheard by the same student who had happened upon Draco a few months ago after Ron had cast the Discrucio Curse on him.  This same student had fully intended to kill Draco when they cast the Eviscero Curse on the blond.  Of course, Draco did not die, unfortunately, and in hindsight the student wished they would used the Killing Curse, instead, but they did not dare cast an Unforgivable in the school, as that would be instantly detected and their cover would be blown.  Their master was counting on them to relay information to him from within Hogwarts and they could not risk it, no matter how much they wanted to kill the traitorous blond.
“I know, Lena, dear.  I still loved you as much as I always did too, but I just wish that my experiments on eternal youth would have worked.”
Aarik looked at Draco curiously, but nodded, at which point Draco continued, “As you both know, Asheera is the Mistress of the Life Sphere in Atlantis, but she is also the High Priestess of the goddess Persephone.  At Persephone’s temple in Atlantis, a magical tree, created by the goddess herself, blooms once every one thousand years, producing a single peach, which when eaten will transport the person who eats it to Tartarus, while still alive.  The tree bloomed today and I ate the peach.”
Meanwhile, in an unknown location, a teenage boy with black hair stood with his back against the slimy, stone wall of his prison.  The boy was deathly pale and so thin that you could see every bone in his body.  His clothes were ripped and damp and all of his exposed skin was covered in bruises, scratches, and a thick coating of dirt.  His feet ached from standing too long and he wished desperately that he could sit down, but the cold steel manacles encircling his wrists held him in a standing position.
The five Ravenclaw boys finished getting ready for the ball, before they left their dorm to go and collect their dates.  Well, except for Kevin and Stephen obviously, since they were each other’s dates.
“Hermione, I appreciate the offer,” Harry said.  “I’m beyond hope though when it comes to dancing.  Bill tried to teach me without much success.”
Harry snuck quietly past Bill and into the room while Bill walked a few steps out into the hallway to check if someone had knocked and run. Shrugging his shoulders, Bill came back into his room, closed the door and turned towards his desk, his back towards the bed.
“Dumbledore, is that really?”  Scrimgeour asked, suddenly much less angry then he had been.  Obviously, coming face to face, in a manner of speaking, with one of the four founders was a bit of a shock.
“You are truly insane if you think that I’m going to believe any of this.  Nobody can live to be as old you claim to be, let alone as old as you claim these Tyriand and Isulus people were.”
Harry opened the door and the four students walked into Dumbledore’s office, which hadn’t really changed much since Harry was last in the room.
Zach smiled and said, “Cool.  We’re the same age now, Rick, so you can’t tell me to do things anymore simply because you’re older then me.”
The students applauded and soon everyone was out on the dance floor.  The other professors, who had remained unseen before now, seemed to suddenly appear.  Every Hogwarts professor, with the notable exceptions of the four Heads of House, was present.  Though, that was most likely because the Heads of House had stayed to keep an eye on the younger students partying in their common rooms.
“Oh good,” Ryan said with a grin.  “I’d hate to think that my boyfriend was so bad in bed that I forget about it by the next morning.”
Pansy’s reflection rolled its eyes at her and the other three girls in the room finished getting ready for the Ball and left the room, wanting to put as much distance between themselves and Pansy as possible, considering that she was obviously crazy in addition to being totally delusional.
“So, I’m dating the Heir of Slytherin?”  Bill asked suddenly, without thinking.  “Oh my family is going to love this.”
The boy picked up a piece of the bread and with great difficulty brought it up to his mouth.  As the boy repeated the process, it got easier, as his muscles adjusted to the use.  He soon finished eating the strips of bread and then grabbed the cup of water with both hands.  The boy shakily brought the cup to his lips and drank, only about half of it making it into his mouth, as the rest dripped out of the corners of his mouth.
print an apology to the heirs for revealing the details of their personal lives.  The populace of the Wizarding world was also told that the portraits of the Founders had been found and that it wasn’t against the rules for Professor Weasley to be dating Nicolas, as they were both consenting adults.
“No, shortly after grandfather passed away, my grandmother and I packed up and moved to the United States.  She never actually said as much, but I always assumed that it was too painful for her to be at Cromwell Hall without my grandfather; too many memories.”
“Perhaps it would be best if instead of telling you, I showed you,” Corelian said before turning to Professor Dumbledore and asking, “Do you, by any chance, have a Pensieve?”
“Well, that explains it then,” Rowena answered, as a look of realization washed over her face.  “Salazar remained at this school until the day he died.  I know this because I was the second to last founder to die, outlived only by Godric.  Salazar died three years and Helga about six months before I did.  I assume you all know that the Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric?”
“Honestly, I don’t!”  Zach exclaimed.  “All I know is what William told me.  He opened to admit you to Helga’s quarters and you ran out with tears in your eyes seconds later.  Tom, will you please, tell me what is wrong?  I know we haven’t known each other long, but I love you and seeing you cry is tearing me up inside.”
Later that evening, Harry sat with his fellow Gryffindors in the Great Hall, waiting for the Sorting to begin. Several of his classmates had already noticed that there were several empty seats at the head table and were wondering what was going on. All of their normal teachers were present, but there were nonetheless several empty chairs on either side of Professor Dumbledore. Harry knew that one of them was of course Professor McGonagall's seat and he assumed that one was also for Nicolas' grandmother, Professor Byrne. Harry also figured that one of the empty seats would probably be for their new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, whoever that may be, but he didn't know why they wouldn't be sitting at the head table already. Of course, the few times he'd seen Dumbledore over the summer, he'd sort of hinted that there would be many surprises this year, so perhaps the empty seats were part of that and Dumbledore wanted to keep the people who would be filling those seats a surprise for the moment.
“Through the large oak door at the end of that hallway,” Salazar said as he pointed to an archway across the room.  “Like my Chamber of Secrets, Parseltongue is required to open the door.  I’ll meet you down there.”
“Well, we have a plan then,” Snape said.  “This weekend Mr. Riddle will return to Hogwarts and Wormtail will get the punishment he deserves.”
Ryan, Nick, Hermione, and Harry were all sitting in the common room of Rowena’s quarters.  Ryan asked Hermione and Harry to drop by in order to inform them about the clues they’d discovered in the ‘Tome of the Founders’.
“I won’t take no for an answer, Hermione,” Draco said.  “So, we can stand here and argue about it until the shop closes, but you’re not going to change my mind.”
"Welcome to Cromwell Hall, Draco," Charles said. "I think you will be comfortable here until school starts."
“Professor Dumbledore asked all the professors for decorating ideas for the Ball,” Matthew revealed.  “I gave him some pictures of Cromwell Hall as a suggestion, and I guess he liked it so much that he ran with it.  I can only assume that it would have been too much work to re-configure the Great Hall in an hour’s time, so he setup the Room of Requirement.”
“Well, you’d better hope we don’t get caught,” Justin said. “Prefects are no more allowed in the staff wing without permission then the regular students are.”
Pulling a bundle from an inner pocket of his robes, Ollivander enlarged it to reveal a small mountain of boxes he'd brought with him from his store.  Quietly perusing the boxes for several moments, Ollivander finally pulled out a box, removed a wand from it, and handed it to Lily.
"Well, the second romance was with Jonathan Potter," Charles said. "Harry Potter's grandfather. The first one, well, I'm not sure I really want to talk about that one. It turns my stomach to know that my mother was ever involved with him."
Ron just looked at Harry for a few seconds before storming into the castle.  Draco and Harry just stood there on the steps for several minutes, until Draco said, “I can’t believe you defended me to Weasley.”
Lily smiled at the old wandmaker and said, "I'm sure none of us would blame you, if you did.  One definitely does not expect to ever see people who have died return from the grave."
Harry smiled at Bill as he removed the charms from his door. Harry wrapped the cloak around him, and then snuck out of the room ahead of Bill.
“What?”  Zach asked.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about!  Who are Blake and Douglas?  Tom, I love you, honestly, I do.  You are the first and only person I have ever kissed or even so much as dated!  You’re the only person I want and I am not about to turn to anyone else.”
As Harry left the common room, he couldn’t help but chuckle as he heard Ron complaining about prefect duties getting in the way of eating lunch.
As Harry moved closer, Draco’s head jerked up. His eyes narrowed a bit and said, “Potter? What are you doing here?”
“He’ll be able to,” Asheera answered.  “King Erevan has thrown out all of his father’s xenophobic laws.  Some Atlanteans may still hold the same beliefs that King Tyriand did, but they can’t to anything about it.  No Atlantean is stupid enough to go against the King, and even if they were, they certainly wouldn’t be stupid enough to go against the King, the Queen, and the Circle.”
Within moments, Belial and Fierna were standing back to back, writhing in agony as Asmodeus’ punishment transformation took effect. Within a matter of minutes, their transformation was complete and they both shuddered in horror as they realized that they had basically been turned into a centaur. That is a two-headed centaur with two torsos, one male and one female, facing in opposite directions, with a single horse’s body connecting them. Thus, neither of them had tails or hind legs.
“Okay, well, just so you know, Justin and I are set to patrol that area this evening,” Hermione revealed.  “So if you find anything, I’ll be in the area.”
“I’m sure he’s fine,” Godric said.  “Anyway, Aarik, if you’re going to say goodbye to your friends, you’d better get downstairs.  The carriages are leaving in ten minutes.”
“Hmm, I’ll have to make sure to tell Blaise about this,” Draco drawled.  “I’m sure he’ll be quite interested to know that someone is thinking about him that way so often.”
Normally, they might have decided not to use them, but the point that Ryan had made when Corelian explained about the jewelry had stuck with both of them.  The Wizarding world was at war and both Matt and Oliver had at that point joined the Order of the Phoenix, so they knew that there was always a chance that they might be kidnapped by Voldemort’s minions, especially now that it was common knowledge that Matt was an heir of Rowena Ravenclaw.  Therefore, the ability to communicate with one another telepathically would definitely come in handy.
Draco was beginning to wonder if this was a good idea or not, because depending on how Adrian worded the questions, the potion might force him to reveal the fact that he had a major crush on Harry and that was the last thing he wanted Pansy to know.  Draco knew that Blaise already suspected it and he knew that Adrian’s family was neutral in the war, so he wasn’t concerned about them knowing, but he knew that Pansy intended to willingly accept the Mark after graduation.
Murmurs went through the hall as Professor Snape stood up, nodded, and sat back down. Harry was, of course, completely horrified at the idea that his favorite subject would now be taught by his least favorite teacher. He also couldn’t help but wonder who would be filling the Potions job now that Snape had finally been given the position that he’d coveted for years.
Exiting the box, the three of them quickly got in the small line of people waiting to be searched by security, before being cleared to head over to the security desk to register their wands.  Arriving at the security desk, the man seated behind the counter said, “Wand, please.”
Nick nodded and then motioned for Professor Snape to follow him.  Arriving at the door, Nick hissed, “Open up,” which triggered the sound of numerous tumblers sliding out of their locked position, before finally the door swung open to reveal a dark staircase.
The four teens sighed in relief as they stepped forward onto the moving staircase as the gargoyle moved back into position.  Reaching the doors at the top of the stairs, Harry and Ryan removed their cloaks from themselves and their companions and were just about to knock on the door when Dumbledore’s voice said, “Come in.”
"As you wish, Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore said, as he turned to Professors Vector and Sinistra.  "Septima, please escort them to the hospital wing and ask Poppy to administer the potions.  Aurora, please go to Rowena’s quarters and ask Asheera to come to my office."
“I appreciate the honesty, Draco,” Harry said.  “And no, you haven’t scared me off.  I’m a Gryffindor, remember?”
Harry grinned at Seamus, sat down, and then said, “Let this serve as a lesson to everyone that this is what will happen to the next person who decides that I have no right to a private life.  Although, if there is a next time, I’ll make sure to cast it during dinner in the Great Hall, so the entire school can hear everything.”
Harry remained quiet through all of this, but there were still some questions that the group needed answers to, so Zach asked, “How would the Dark Marks prevent Asmodeus from forcing Voldemort’s return?”
“Also, Hermione, I can’t believe that nobody has ever informed you,” Rowena said, “but you can leave clothes all over Gryffindor Tower until the day you graduate and you will never free any of the Hogwarts house-elves.  Only their master can free them and simply being a student in this school does not make you their master.  The Hogwarts elves are bound to whoever is the Head of Hogwarts, so the only person who can free the elves is Professor Dumbledore.”
Thomas Byrne also revealed something interesting. He claimed that he’s the granduncle of Slytherin Nicolas Delaney and that the Hogwarts Care of Magical Creatures professor, Angelique Byrne, is his sister. He said that her real name is Ariana Merope Riddle and that his name is actually Tom Marvolo Riddle. He told Zacharias and Cedric that he’d spent over fifty years as your prisoner, my Lord.
"A pleasure to meet you," one of the red heads said. "I'm Bill Weasley. The other red-head is my brother Ron and then Harry Potter."
Draco nodded, as Valshar closed his eyes in thought for a moment, before he opened them and said, "Ah, yes, I have it now.  For millennia, I have sat upon this throne and witnessed horrors, the likes of which cannot be imagined.  A parade of never ending pain and suffering, and yet through it all, I have never shed a tear.  Make me cry, mortal, that is your challenge!  I’m sure you won’t succeed, but at least your pitiful attempt will be an amusing distraction."
“Yes, as King, Asmodeus is definitely a force to be reckoned with,” Asheera said.  “He’s one of the very few creatures in existence who would stand a chance, however slim, of actually winning a duel with the one of the Lesser Gods.  However, no matter how powerful he is, he is still required to follow certain rules imposed by Zeus.  One of those rules is that he cannot force anyone into the Hells that was not born in the Hells.
Pansy remained quiet as she thought about that statement.  After a minute she said, “I still don’t believe that Draco would have sex with you willingly.”
Ron looked mutinously at Aarik as he stood and asked, “Harry, what has that bloody ferret done to you?”
Seconds later, a woman’s voice said, “Welcome to the Ministry of Magic.  Please state your name and business.”
“What?”  Ron asked, clueless and beyond confused, of course, considering the circumstances, one could not really blame him for that.
“Is there anyway that we could see the real Tom Riddle?”  Nick asked, curious about his ancestor, who due to the nature of Tom’s prison, he was now technically a year older than.  “See him without alerting Voldemort?”
“Professor Weasley?”  Parvati asked.  “Could I have the pictures of Fred and George?  Fred is my boyfriend, after all, and Padma is dating George.  I’m sure they wouldn’t mind.”
Asheera smiled, nodded, and launched into the same explanation that she had given Draco only hours earlier.
Draco shivered at the thought of the Cruciatus Curse and prayed he never had to feel it again.  Having actually felt that kind of pain, an infinitesimal part of Draco wanted to feel sorry for Valshar, but in the end, he decided that Valshar deserved the pain for killing so many innocent people.
“Attention students,” Dumbledore said.  “At this time I would like to announce a Halloween Ball for all fifth year and older students here in the Great Hall on Halloween night, following the feast.  It is my hope that a night of frivolity will help to take everyone’s minds off of current events.  Rather than costumes, the Heads of House and I have decided that this will be a formal event.  Those of you in first through fourth years don’t feel left out as your Heads of House will make arrangements for smaller parties in your house common rooms.”
“That explains it then,” said Helga.  “Like most Muggle-born students, you probably didn’t know that you were a witch until you got your letter, so you never grew up with the education that non-Muggle-born witches and wizards receive before entering school.  As hard to believe as it may be, there are certain facts about the Wizarding World that are not covered as a part of the Hogwarts curriculum and they aren’t documented in many books, simply because it’s viewed to be such basic information that writing it in a book would be pointless.”
Bill walked over quickly and seeing what happened, he took Malfoy’s hand, pulled out his wand, and cast a charm on it to stop the blood.
At the bottom of the stairs, an archway opened up into a cavernous room.  Two walls were dedicated to bookshelves that were packed with books Nick assumed were about Potions.  The other two walls were dominated by cabinets with glass doors, which held a wider variety of potions ingredients then he had ever seen.  In the center of the room, a massive workstation held ten cauldrons of various sizes and materials.
When he was sure that Ryan was out of earshot, he smiled said quietly, “He certainly has turned into a well-rounded and capable young man since I saw him last.”
“Harry, what did you do to my brother?”  Dennis asked, although Harry noted that Dennis did not sound particularly mad, just amused.
“No need?”  Adrian asked as he turned on his fellow Chaser.  “You were at the game today!  You saw what happened and you’re saying there’s no need?”
“The person who added the clause is long dead, but you can thank them.  You see, it was Rowena Ravenclaw who added the clause in question and as you well know, Ryan, Rowena can be spoken to through her various portraits.”
“No, it doesn’t,” Rowena answered.  “Despite what some people might like to believe, Muggle-borns are just as magically capable as a pureblood.  It just sometimes takes a little longer and more practice for their powers to reach full capacity.  There is also a potion to help them reach their full potential; but I doubt you’ve ever heard of it because most of its ingredients are extremely rare.  Some people also think of it as a Dark Magic potion, because it requires a drop of blood from a pureblood witch or wizard.”
As Dumbledore said this, the door to the small antechamber off the hall where all of the Triwizard champions were sent after their names were drawn from the Goblet of Fire opened and Bill emerged. He waved to the students and then took his place in one of the empty chairs at the head table. This was certainly news to Harry, as Bill had never mentioned anything about being on staff at Hogwarts. Harry knew that Bill had an Outstanding Potions N.E.W.T, but he never expected him to teach the subject. 'Perhaps Dumbledore asked him not to tell anyone so it could be a surprise,' Harry thought. 'I'm surprised he didn't tell me at least. Of course, I suppose now at least the Gryffindors will be treated fairly in Potions class, but unfairly in Defense class.'
“How would that stop him?”  Dumbledore asked.  “Isn’t the King of the Hells supposed to be nearly omnipotent?”
“Yes, that would be me,” Zacharias spoke up.  “I found out a few days ago and I’m still in shock to be honest.”
"Of course," Kingsley Shacklebolt replied, before pointing his wand at Lucius' still form, and said two spells in rapid succession.
“You’ll find the book you need there,” Salazar said as he pointed to one of the bookcases.  Nick looked where Salazar was pointing and noticed a small cabinet in one of the bookshelves, a door with no visible knob.
There are books here written by Merlin himself, as well as Morgana Le Fey, and there are also copies of all the scrolls from the Great Library at Alexandria.”
Some people would find that to be extremely annoying, but few people question it, because while Lucinda was nowhere near being the most powerful witch alive at the time, she was considered by quite a few to be somewhere in the top twenty. She had also gained lots of respect through her long and successful career as an Auror, and her late husband, William Cromwell, had been a very generous philanthropist in both the Wizarding and Muggle Worlds. After he died, she continued his philanthropic pursuits, so most people tended to overlook her somewhat overbearing personality because she obviously had a big heart and was always willing to help those in need.
“Yes,” Ryan muttered, shocked by this news.  “Of course, that’s assuming that this Fiona Ravenclaw is descended from Rowena, but Ravenclaw isn’t a very common name, so I would think she probably is.”
Ron shook his head before pushing Hermione’s hair out of the way and leaning down to kiss her neck.  It wasn’t long though before he found himself falling backwards after Hermione pushed him away.  Standing back up, Ron asked, “Why in Merlin’s name did you do that?”
Dumbledore’s eyes were twinkling like mad, when he spoke up and said, “You’re quite right, Lily.  Draco and Aarik share many similarities to you and James.  It’s almost frightening.”
As Ryan stepped towards the doors, he couldn’t help but sneeze from all the dust and turning back to Rowena’s portrait, he said, “In a moment.  I think I’ll just cast those cleaning charms you mentioned first.  All this dust is making me sick.”
Speaking of couples, I did find Justin Finch-Fletchley snogging after hours with Ryan in a broom cupboard again.  This is the second time in as many weeks that I’ve come across them.  They really should be more careful or one of these days I fear that they’ll be caught by one of the other prefects, or worse, a professor.  Justin would be sure to lose his job as prefect, which would be a shame since he only just got the position this year after his classmate, Ernie MacMillan, decided to resign to concentrate more on his schoolwork.
“I’m going to make Matthew, Oliver, and myself invisible and then Apparate us to the Visitor’s Entrance,” Corelian answered.
“Thanks,” Harry said as he looked at the map.  “We’re in luck.  It looks like Justin and Hermione are still on their prefect rounds in the hallway outside Ravenclaw Tower and Draco and Susan Bones are two hallways over.”
“Yes, Draco Malfoy.  The night that Ryan found out he was an heir, Rowena told him and a small group of students how to cast the Mass-Book Restoration charm on her collection.  Draco was one of them, who then spent the night in Rowena’s quarters that night.  I’ve become an early riser because of our morning runs, so I’m now usually the first one awake in the mornings.  I saw that Draco’s bed wasn’t slept in, so since nobody else was awake yet, I messed up the bedding to make it look like it had been slept in.”
Lord Voldemort sat upon the ebony throne that he had set up in the drawing room of the Riddle house in Little Hangleton. Several of his Death Eaters were also in the large room, which was used as the main meeting room. Voldemort stared idly at nothing in particular as he petted Nagini’s head and plotted his next atrocity. After a moment, a large barn owl swooped into the room and landed on one of the arms of Voldemort’s throne. Taking the small scroll from the bird’s leg, Voldemort grinned as it flapped its wings and took off, not realizing it would never see the outside ever again.
Early the next morning, Ryan was sitting at the head of the dining room table in Rowena’s private quarters.  Matthew, Oliver, Justin, and Corelian were sitting around the table with him, enjoying the breakfast that Dobby had brought up for them.
“I’m sorry, Professor,” Nick said.  “It’s just that Bill is too humiliated to talk right now and I figured you wanted an answer.”
“Oh yes,” Angelique said.  “She hadn’t come into her powers yet, so you had no trouble resisting her charms.  Why would you wait until after Fleur and Phillipe were married though to tell your family that you’re gay, Bill?”
“Hello,” Harry said, causing a startled Bill to jump about three feet as he whirled around to see Harry lying on his bed.
Lane Waters looked at Adrian with a pleading look, “I know, but can I at least try?  Harry Potter joined the Gryffindor team when he was a first year.”
Harry nodded and watched as Hermione left.  Once she was gone, Harry quietly snuck upstairs to his dorm, went over to his trunk, grabbed his cloak and map, and left Gryffindor Tower.
Harry and Ryan nodded and then went over to the massive oak doors that Rowena pointed at and opened them.  Walking inside, they found themselves in a cavernous room filled with bookshelves.  Walking over to the fireplace, Ryan quickly lit the fire to provide more light and then looked up at Rowena’s portrait.  She smiled and said, “Welcome Ryan, Harry, to my private library.”
“Longbottom, Neville,” McGonagall called, and Neville went over to schedule his classes. It took a bit longer to sort out Neville’s classes, and since it was only McGonagall and the sixth years in the common room, Harry had no problem overhearing Neville and McGonagall’s conversation.
"This is Ryan Cromwell and Nicolas Delaney," Hermione said. "I almost ran Ryan down and we got to talking. They're transferring to Hogwarts for their... which year are you guys in?"
Aarik was at a loss for words and simply nodded his head, as Lily let out a cry of what could only be described as joy, as she threw her arms around both Aarik and Draco and hugged them tightly.  James came up behind his wife, looked at Draco for a long moment, and then asked, “I take it you are Lucius’ son?”
Later the next evening, after dinner, Hermione and Ryan were once again in the restricted section pouring over various books, trying to find some shred of information that would tell them who the heirs were.  In the last three weeks, they’d probably gone through about two or three dozen books apiece, but had to yet find anything.  What neither of them knew, however, was that their persistence was about to strike pay dirt in a very big way.
“If it makes you feel any better, Matt,” Justin said, “he hasn’t given me permission either and I’m his boyfriend.”
“I know how you feel, Helga,” Rowena said.  “I couldn’t believe it myself.  With all the curtains drawn, I never was able to keep track of time, but I could hardly believe it when Ryan and Harry came to my quarters that first night and told me that it was 1996.”
"Yes, I'm Matt's cousin and thanks," Ryan said. "Are you going to tell me who you are? It would be nice to know who I'm thanking."
“Why would a crush on Oliver Wood sicken you?”  Blaise asked.  “He’s very cute.  Professor Cromwell is a very lucky man, if you ask me.”
“Its standard procedure when a student is injured,” Madam Pomfrey said before Matt could answer, “for the Headmaster to inform their parents or legal guardian.”
“Would it really be so bad to leave the artifacts unprotected for a short while?” the portrait of Dilys Derwent asked.  “What’s the worst that could possibly happen?”
“So, when should I put my head together with Bill’s mom to start planning the wedding?”  Angelique asked.
“I’ve just become aware of a rather disturbing development,” Asmodeus said. “It would seem that a lesser devil is free on the Mortal Plane, Earth, and has designs to overthrow me as King of the Hells. Not that he has any chance of succeeding, but, I felt it necessary to tell the two of you, since he was your responsibility!”
Corelian and Asheera agreed that it could be a tactical advantage if certain students could learn and master Wandless Magic before Voldemort or his minions found out that such training was occurring.  To that end, they both agreed to not perform Wandless Magic in the presence of anyone who did not already know they could.
“Yes, I do,” replied Snape.  He was angry that they had planned to attack his godson, but it was not common knowledge among the students that Draco was his godson and he wanted to keep it that way.  Draco was not seriously hurt, so he saw no reason to punish his house and eliminate their chances of winning the Quidditch Cup.  “They will each serve detention with me every night for the rest of the week.  I think that is enough punishment.”
“Well, you know the old saying,” Draco drawled.  “Opposites attract.  We’re certainly that when you think about it.  I have blond hair, you have black hair, I’m a Slytherin, you’re a Gryffindor, and I grew up like a pampered prince, while you didn’t.”
“Valshar?”  Draco asked.  “I don’t think I’ve ever heard that name in connection with Tartarus before.”
Snape nodded.  “Well, while I obviously have selfish reasons for wanting that, we’d have to do it anyway,” he reasoned, “as if what Lady Asheera said was true, he can’t be sent back to the Hells while he’s bound to so many living mortals.”
After a few moments, they calmed down and Hermione asked, “So, should we go and see Professor Dumbledore?”
“Well, that’s not entirely true, actually,” Valen said.  “As requested, I performed background checks on all of his new friends here at Hogwarts.  One of them, a sixth-year Gryffindor named Harry Potter, was sent a warning letter in his second year for casting a Floating Charm, which was illegal since he’s underage and he did it outside of school.  I did some further checking though and it turns out it was actually a house-elf named Dobby who cast the charm.”
“Oh I do so enjoy torturing you, boy,” Voldemort said, as the boy collected himself and curled up against the wall.  “Causing you pain has definitely been a highlight of the last 54 years.”
Professor Dumbledore had just finished reading the article in the Prophet moments before the Minister’s arrival.  Dumbledore just smiled and said, “Yes, Minister, it’s true.  Would you care for some tea?  Or a lemon drop, perhaps?”
“I think I will,” Ryan said as he grabbed one of the thick leather-bound books, which was labeled, ‘A Genealogy of Noteworthy 15th and 16th Century Witches and Wizards, Surnames A through F.’
“Near as I can tell he’s fine,” Harry said.  “According to the diagnostic spell that Madame Pomfrey taught us, he’s under the influence of a Dreamless Sleep potion.”
“Well, I don’t blame you, I suppose,” Draco said.  “Cedric was certainly hot in his own way.  Not really my type though.  So, Harry lets get back to the subject of you liking me.”
"Well, in addition to what he left to charity," Dumbledore said, "Sirius also left a bequest to everyone in this room. Don't look so shocked, Arthur. Sirius really did like you and you are distant cousins after all, so he thought that it was only right that he include you in his will. He also left a bequest to Tonks, but she is off on an important mission for the Order and couldn't be here tonight."
“My cousin and Mr. Finch-Fletchley,” Matt answered as he ushered the two boys in. “Valen escorted them here, but he had other matters to attend to.”
“Yes, Professor Dumbledore is anxious to get it brewed,” Nick said.  “He wants to see Tom Riddle and try and assess how dangerous a rescue mission would be.”
“My late grandmother dated Tom for a brief period when they were in school together,” Ryan revealed.  “So, going to school with my grandmother’s ex-boyfriend should be plenty strange.”
Scanning the boxes, Ollivander pulled out a long black one and removed a wand from within.  "Here, try this one - a springy, 12 1/2 inch ash with a phoenix feather."
“Colin has been collecting naked pictures of various male members of the house Quidditch teams in the locker room showers since his third year.”
“Hmm, well, I think we should get the spell started as soon as possible, so, Harry could you check your map?  See if any of our friends are around?”
"Fiance actually," Oliver said as he wrapped an arm around Matthew's waist. "I'm sorry we didn't tell you, sir, but we were keeping it a secret because of Matt's mom."
“I’m afraid I have no choice,” Snape answered.  “Voldemort knows that Tom Riddle escaped.  I don’t know how he found out, but he knows and he wasn’t happy.  He called every single Death Eater in his service to headquarters tonight.”
“Could we get back to you on that?”  Matthew asked, after a moment of conferring with Oliver.  “We’d like to sleep on that decision.”
Silence ensued for several minutes, until it was finally broken by Percy Weasley.  “What if Atlantis was to acquire more territory outside of the shields?”
‘Cor, honey, you’re not getting anywhere with that man,’ Asheera said telepathically in Corelian’s mind.  ‘He obviously needs tangible proof, so I think you should take him to Atlantis.’
Half-an-hour later, Dumbledore walked into the Room of Requirement, which currently resembled a large conference room.  Taking the empty seat at the head of the table, Dumbledore waited for a few moments for everyone to quiet down, as Fawkes appeared and settled down on the perch next to Dumbledore's chair.
Ryan, Justin, Matt, and Oliver continued to chat for several minutes, before both couples went back into the main room for another dance.
In the sixth-year Slytherin girl’s dormitories, the girls were all getting ready for the Ball, although Pansy Parkinson was livid.
As the Sorting Ceremony ended, Professor McGonagall put away the scroll listing the new students and the Sorting Hat, before returning to her seat. Professor Dumbledore stood up and said, "I'm sure all you are hungry, so while there is a time for speeches and announcements, now is not it, so tuck in!" All of the empty serving platters on the tables magically filled with food and the students and teachers begin to fill their plates.
“Well, you give me too much credit,” Hermione said.  “You really weren’t all that bad when I started.  Bill may have gotten his feet stepped on fairly often, but he must have taught you something.”
“Veil?”  Harry asked, as he looked at Dumbledore.  The old man instantly knew what Harry was thinking and asked, “Is it known what happened to the veil?”
"Angelique Byrne," the older woman replied, "and this is my grandson, Nicolas Delaney.  I take it your nephew is a new student as well?"
“Pansy,” Daphne said, “you know the penalty for going against them on something as serious as this.  They will blast your name off the family tree and disown you.  And you’re a girl, so you know that Wizarding law will favor your older brother when your parents die.  Which means you’ll be lucky to get enough money to buy a candy bar at Honeydukes.”
“Am I correct in assuming that Cedric not being able to remember the circumstances of his death has something to do with the reverse Dementor effect that you mentioned, Asheera?”  McGonagall asked.
“Well, obviously Professor Dumbledore,” Harry said.  “Plus Professor Lasinius, Remus, Hermione, Bill, Nick, Ryan, Justin, Susan, Draco, Blaise, Zacharias, and Ryan’s father and step-mother.”
"Before I answer that question," Harry said, a sly grin on his face, "Why don't you put your curse-breaking skills to good use, and make sure we aren't disturbed?"
“No, actually now he probably could,” Asheera answered after taking a moment to think.  “In order to appear in his true form, Voldemort would have to bind himself to the Mortal Plane.  I could be wrong, but I think his way of doing that is through the Dark Marks that he placed on the Death Eaters.  Those Dark Marks bind the Death Eaters to him, which would prevent Asmodeus from forcing Voldemort to return.”
“Well, of all the books you could have loaned me, you somehow managed to give me my mum’s old book.”
“But my grandmother wasn’t born on the 23rd of June,” Nicolas said.  “Her birthday is the 18th of July.”
"No, Ron, I'm not mad," Hermione said. "It's just that I don't even want to begin to imagine how hard it must have been for Malfoy to see his own father kill his mother. The article also said that Lucius had been using the Cruciatus on him, so I think he deserves some compassion."
Looking at page ten of his book, Harry was annoyed to find out that the previous owner had taken the liberty of writing things in the margins and crossing out various instructions.  Judging by the flowing script, Harry guessed that the previous owner was a girl.  There were also little pink hearts drawn in the margins.  Despite the graffiti, Harry was still able to see the list of ingredients necessary and got up to get them from the store cupboard as Malfoy filled their cauldron with water and lit a fire underneath it.
“I’m not under a spell, Ronald, but I’ve seen a different side of Draco this year and I like what I see.  I also trust my very good friend Harry’s judgment.  If he believes that Draco deserves a chance, then I think that as Harry’s friends, it’s the least we can do.”
“Once eaten, the challenger is instantly transported to Tartarus,” answered Asheera.  “Instead of a pit, the peach has an obolus in the center – the payment given to Charon in order to cross the River Acheron, which must be crossed in order to reach the Palace of the Dead.  Once there, the challenger had to gain an audience with Hades and he was required to meet with them within an hour of their arrival.  During this audience, the challenger must claim the soul or souls that he or she wished to free from Tartarus.  Now, there is a limit of four souls, one soul for each of the pomegranate seeds that Persephone ate, and the Killing Curse is the required cause of death.  Any other cause of death renders the soul ineligible of being claimed.
“That is a good reason, Pansy,” Draco said, “because in case you’ve missed it the other million times I’ve said it, I’m gay!”
“I’m not,” Harry said.  “I never fantasized about doing it with Cedric’s corpse.  He was always alive in my fantasies.  Long story short, he let me use the Prefect’s Bathroom in my fourth year to deal with one of the Tri-Wizard clues and my fantasies always had him coming in while I was in the bath, stripping, getting in the tub with me, and then we’d start making out.  What sickened me was that I still had that fantasy a few times after he died.”
"Hogwarts Castle," Draco answered and the driver bowed slightly and said, "Get in," as the coach's door opened.  Draco helped his mother and Lily climb into the coach first, followed by Cedric and James, before getting in himself.  The coach's door promptly closed and the distinct sound of a whip broke through the silence as the horses neighed and the coach jolted forward and took to the skies.
"Ron, would it kill you to show a little compassion?" Bill asked. "The boy did just lose his mother."
The rest of the trip to the castle was spent in relative silence.  After several minutes, the carriage stopped, signaling that they'd arrived.  Charles opened the door and stepped out before helping Professor Byrne out of the carriage, followed by Ryan and Nicolas. They were greeted by a woman wearing emerald green robes standing on the front steps, and Charles smiled, instantly recognizing Professor McGonagall.
About three hours later, Molly Weasley was standing in the front parlor of Grimmauld Place when Percy's owl, Hermes, flew through the window and landed on the back of a nearby chair. Molly took a rolled up parchment and what looked like a copy of the Daily Prophet from the owl's outstretched leg and gave it an owl treat before it flew out the window.
As if on cue, Narcissa, Cedric, James and Lily chose that moment to enter the room, to shocked gasps and a couple of screams, while Emmeline Vance and Dedalus Diggle fainted.  Once Emmeline and Dedalus had been Rennervated, Dumbledore pulled out his Pensieve and showed everyone his memory of Lady Asheera explaining what had happened.  He used this method instead of having her do it in person because, for one, she wasn't a member of the Order, and two she had gotten sick and tired of explaining the situation.
“Ah, don’t bother,” Kevin said with a grin.  “I’ll just go find Stephen.  I’m sure he can take my mind off of that unpleasant mental image.”
“That’s true to a point, Aarik,” Asheera explained.  “It’s true that the arcane magic practiced by mortals cannot bring back the dead.  However, the divine magic of the Olympian gods is an entirely different form of magic, which can do practically anything.”
The driver turned his body to face the professors, before raising his right hand, which was holding his severed head by the hair.  The skin was the color and texture of moldy cheese.  A hideous grin split the face from ear to ear and the small black eyes looked like malignant flies.  The entire head glowed with the phosphorescence of decaying matter.
“Why are you capable of speech?”  Flitwick asked from his place next to Dumbledore.  “According to legend, you can only speak once on each journey you undertake and then only the name of the soul you are collecting for the afterlife.”
It was a major relief for Harry and Hermione that Ron had not caused any scenes.  They had both been sure that he would be angry when he found out that they had attended the Ball together, but thus far, they hadn’t heard anything from him.
"Their caskets?"  Ollivander asked, his tone clearly indicating his belief that he hadn't heard Dumbledore correctly.
Meanwhile, in the deepest pits of the Hells, otherwise known as Nessus, the Ninth Hell, the powerful King of the Hells, Asmodeus, watched the events unfolding on Earth with amusement.
“Oh, Ced, my boy,” Amos said, with tears in his eyes.  “I cannot even begin to tell you how much I’ve missed you.”
Godric looked ready to say something, but his retort fell silent on his lips as he thought about it for a moment and then said, “Oh my Gods, you’re right.  I did encourage him.  In fact, the night before he made the announcement I suggested he do it while we were... well, doing things.”
“You’re my boyfriend,” Draco said as he looked at Aarik.  “You’re supposed to comfort me in my time of need.”  At that moment, Madam Pomfrey placed the tip of her wand on Draco’s toe and prepared to cast the charm to heal it, causing Draco to flinch and exclaim, “OW!”
“I suspect there are a few, most likely in the wizarding government, who do realize that,” the woman said.  “They don’t, however, want that knowledge to get out because they don’t have the ability to trace magic that isn’t performed with a wand.”
“Success?”  Adrian asked.  “You call torturing and murdering hundreds of innocent people to be a successful route to anything?  The end does not justify the means, Vaisey, and even then I do not believe for a second that the Wizarding world would be better off by keeping all the bloodlines pure.  Actually, I think it’s causing more problems than its solving.”
“Mr. Delaney is your name Professor Weasley?”  McGonagall interrupted.  “Five points from Slytherin for speaking when you weren’t being spoken too.”
Wrapping his arm around Bill’s waist, Nick said, “This is my boyfriend, Bill Weasley, the Hogwarts Potions Professor.”
“Well, Harry, I’m confident I can help you,” Hermione said.  “Many people don’t know this about me, but I’ve actually taken ballroom dance lessons and I was the best student in the class.”
Arriving back at the Château De Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange both felt sick at the revelations they’d just gotten.  They both believed in the cause of pure-blood supremacy, but turning Earth into the Tenth Hell?  That was something that they would never have signed up for if they’d known what they were getting into when they accepted the Dark Mark.
Matthew sobbed and Oliver wrapped him up in a tight embrace as Matthew picked up a picture of him and his parents.  The picture was taken on the day that Matthew finished his education at Hogwarts.  Charles had been extremely proud of his son, since Matthew had been in the top five percent of his class and had earned N.E.W.Ts in all eight subjects he’d taken, five of which were Outstandings.
Madame Pomfrey was quickly on her feet; her wand pointed at the poltergeist, she said, “Peeves!  How dare you enter my hospital!  Get out!”
Harry smiled and got up to give Remus a hug, before they both sat down in front of Dumbledore’s desk and Dumbledore made the usual offer of tea or lemon drops.  Harry politely declined and Remus accepted a cup of tea.
Matthew produced his wand first and the security wizard dropped it onto a strange device that looked like a set of scales, except it only had one dish.
Colin nodded and turned to leave.  He was about two feet from McGonagall’s desk when she called out, “Creevey?  You might want this.”
The other Gryffindors at the table cheered and the entire Great Hall was soon abuzz with a new energy.  The students were obviously looking forward to the match tonight.
“Rowena, now that Brendan was able to visit you here, can I assume that you are capable of leaving your quarters?”
“I understand your wand’s core and the time it’s been in use was undeterminable,” Rufus said.  “I cannot allow you to have it back.  It is illegal to bring an unknown magical item into the Ministry, as the security wizard at the desk has already told you.”
“Doesn’t make a difference?  Hermione, how can you say that?  After everything, that slimy git has done to us?  Do you realize how many times he’s called you a Mudblood?  Why would you want to do him any favors?”
“Hmm, well, that does sound like Draco,” Harry muttered and when he noticed the curious looks from his friends, he elaborated.  “In third year Magical Creatures class he got a very minor scratch from a Hippogriff and then proceeded to miss classes and pawn his work off on other students for weeks.  He even used his injury to get out of playing a difficult Quidditch match in unfavorable weather, even though by then he was no more injured than any of us are now.”
“Valid questions,” Corelian answered, as he waved his hand and conjured three more chairs.  “If you’ll have a seat, I will do my best to explain.”
“And the worst part of this,” Dumbledore said, “is that until he makes his presence known to the Wizarding public, we can’t do anything about it.  Ideally, we’d get the Ministry involved, because as weak and ineffectual as they tend to be, we need to do everything we can to mount a defense.  Of course, with all the spies that he’s got working for the Ministry, even if they were effective, it wouldn’t necessarily be to our advantage to involve them.  They wouldn’t believe us anyway, since the only proof we have that he’s a devil are the words of a nine-year-old boy who died over a thousand years ago and a marked Death Eater – no offense, Severus.”
“Where have you been all these years?”  Ryan asked.  “Why were you never around when I was growing up?”
“Maybe with the attack on Hogsmeade,” Hermione suggested, “and now the attack on Inverness, they’ve decided the extra security wasn’t enough?”
Godric’s demeanor got very imposing, as if he was trying to scare Harry, and growled out, “Again who are you to talk to me that way, boy?”
Lily, James, Narcissa, and Cedric were now in a side room of the office so that Aarik and Zacharias could be filled in on what had happened and prepared for the inevitable shock of it.
Twenty minutes later, Harry was done eating breakfast when he noticed Ryan and Nicolas standing up from their tables and heading for the doors.  Hermione and Ron were once again distracted by each other, so they didn’t notice when Harry stood up and left the table to catch up with his newest friends.
"Agreed," Bill said, giving his younger brother a look that said 'Don't you even think about arguing with me.'
Harry smiled at Ginny before turning to Godric and asking, “Did you catch that, Godric?  When Ginny named Narcissa’s parents, she said Cygnus and Druella Rosier Black, but when she named my godfather’s parents, she said Orion Black and Walburga Black.  Do you have any idea why she said that?”
"Don't you dare tell me how to raise my son!"  Narcissa screamed, her anger making her forget that fighting with her armed, Death Eater-husband might not be the best idea, especially considering that she was unarmed and only capable of performing a handful of simple spells without her wand.
“Yeah, I’ve been thinking of trying to bury the hatchet with him myself,” Harry revealed.  “Um, look, if I tell you two a secret, will you swear to keep it to yourselves?  Nobody, especially Ron, must know about it.”
“Shouldn’t we try and help?”  Harry asked.  “Dumbledore said he’d send help, but we don’t know how many Dementors are loose out there, not to mention the number of Death Eaters.”
“Okay, Mr. Waters,” Adrian said.  “You can tryout, but I’m warning you now that I can’t let you join the team without Professor Snape or Professor Dumbledore’s clearance, so, you may not know if you’ve made the team today.”
“Rowena, don’t you dare call Alaric his son!”  Godric roared.  “That bastard gave up his right to be called a father when he killed Alaric!”
“Yes, it is,” Harry answered as he took a few steps closer and sat down on the floor across from Draco. “You’ve just never called me Harry before, so you caught me off guard.”
“It leaves an extremely bitter taste in my mouth to say this,” Lucius said, “but I hope that old fool Dumbledore and his Order find a way to reverse the path that the world is now on.  Because the alternative is…”  Here Lucius stopped speaking, unable to think of a word to adequately describe the alternative, as Bellatrix nodded her head in complete agreement.
Looking over at Hermione, Harry noticed that she looked a little put out that Bill hadn’t called on her yet, but she did flash a smile at Harry to let him know she wasn’t mad at him.
“We’re not in class, so please, call me Valen.  As for my type, well, I’ve always been partial to brown hair and gray eyes.”
“It’s true that when my parents learned they were marked for death by Voldemort,” Draco flinched at Harry’s mention of the name, “that they went into hiding under the Fidelius Charm.  It’s also true that Sirius was to be their Secret Keeper, but at the last minute, they changed their minds and made one of my dad’s other friends, Peter Pettigrew, the secret keeper.”
Before anyone could speak a word, the Dullahan waved his hand and the door of the coach slammed shut.  Everyone jumped as the sound of the Dullahan's whip, a human spine, cracked through the silence.  The six black horses neighed and flames shot out of their nostrils as they galloped forward and took to the skies.  Within seconds, the coach was gone from sight.
“Well, actually, I was, Malfoy.  Maybe it’s the Gryffindor in me, but I was concerned.  I was sitting right next to you when that teapot hit you after all.  Close enough to hear your nose breaking in fact.”
“Professor Dumbledore asked if I would brew the potion,” Severus said, “as I am a certified Potions Master, but I cannot brew a potion from a recipe I cannot read.”
“Take Charms,” McGonagall said, “and I shall make sure to send an owl to Augusta reminding her that the subject isn’t totally useless just because she failed her Charms O.W.L.”
“Actually, they are,” Asheera said.  “Your grandmother is listed, Nicolas, only, she’s listed by her name at birth and not her adopted name.”
Draco returned the now broken mirror to the pocket of his robe, as Valshar remained silent for a few moments, obviously trying to recover from the experience before he opened his eyes and said, "Truth is a truly terrible thing.  I have sat upon this throne for so long, I had nearly forgotten the pain of my enslavement.  You shall take the souls you have claimed and leave."  Valshar looked over to one of the black hooded guards and said in a strong and commanding voice, "You!  Find the souls he claimed and bring them before me!"
“I look forward to it, Mistress,” Valen said with a bow as the woman in the mirror disappeared, before Valen got ready for bed.
“War?  My, my, Ryan, how unpleasant,” Rowena said.  “Then, we must figure out who the heirs are immediately so that the other quarters can be found.  Backed up by the knowledge of all four founders, I’m sure the heirs will be able to help turn the tide in this war.  Who is the enemy, if I may ask?”
Adrian was at a loss for words.  He couldn’t believe what he was hearing.  “I can’t believe you two actually think that.  Who Draco decides to date is his business and he doesn’t deserve to get hurt because of it.”
“Valen Jorian Lasinius,” the woman said, “why on Earth are you still wearing those glamour charms at this hour?”
"Percy sent me this advance copy of a special edition of the Prophet," Molly said as she held it up. "Lucius Malfoy was arrested at his mansion this morning."
quoted are all good friends of mine.  Many of them have been studying Atlantis for over fifty years.  If they say it doesn’t exist any longer then it really doesn’t.”
Professor Dumbledore asked Valen to continue using his wand, simply so that it would not become public knowledge that he was capable of performing Wandless Magic.  Since Valen only taught two fencing classes a week, Professor Dumbledore asked if he would be willing to secretly teach a class on Wandless Magic to a group of select students at some future date.
“No, it’s Cedric,” Zach answered.  “He likes to be called Rick for short though.  And you’re right; I did tell you that he was dead, because he was.”
“How did you travel to Tartarus?”  Dumbledore asked.  “Why did you go to Tartarus?  I must say that I’ve never heard of anyone going to the Land of the Dead and returning with people who are supposed to be dead, looking very much alive.”
Of course, the Weasleys were not the only ones to get the urgent request from the Headmaster, as Amos and Hannah Diggory had also been asked to drop everything and come to Hogwarts post haste.  Unlike Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, however, the Diggorys were not worried as much as they were bewildered by the request, as they could not understand what could possibly be so important.  The only family member they had attending Hogwarts was their nephew Zacharias, but why contact them if there was a problem?  Surely, the Headmaster would have contacted Hannah’s brother Isaiah and his wife Katherine if there were a problem with their son.
Rufus stood silently for a moment, before he lowered his wand, and put it into a pocket on his robes.  “This tour had better be convincing.  If it isn’t, I’m afraid I will have no choice but to order Mr. Laitannen’s arrest and I will see that he spends the next several years in Azkaban.  The Dementors might have abandoned the prison, but it still is not a pleasant place to spend one’s time.”
“It’s good that you fear me, boy,” Voldemort hissed as he banished the whip and pointed his wand at the quivering boy.  “I shall have to reward you for that.  Crucio!”
“No, Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick,” Ryan replied sarcastically, as Kevin’s mouth dropped open.  “Of course I mean Professor Cromwell and Professor Wood!”
Blushing a shade of red comparable to a Weasley's hair, Oliver then said, "Okay, can we change the subject now?"
“Visitors to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk located at the far end of the Atrium.”
Susan looked at Draco for a moment and then said, “Alright, fine.  You’d better not be leading us on a wild goose chase though, Harry.”
Between bites of food, Ron said, “Great job, Harry!  I don’t know how you did it, but wow!  Two vials of luck!  What are you going to do with them?”
“Okay, that wasn’t in unison,” Rowena said.  “You all must say the incantation at the same time or it won’t work.”
“Well, that’s what glamour charms are for, Billy,” Nick said as he wrapped his arms around the redhead and rested his chin on his left shoulder.
Adrian asked Madame Rosemerta to make sure none of the students left the room while he was talking to Dumbledore and he then grabbed the pouch of Floo powder and threw some into the flames as he shouted, “Hogwarts, Headmaster’s office,” before sticking his head into the flames.
“I remember posing for this,” Matthew said, said clearing his throat and drying his eyes.  “Dad was so proud of me.  Mum, on the other hand, well, she was proud, but at the same time, she wasn’t.”
"A pleasure, I'm Madame Malkin. If you'll please just step up on that stool next to Young Mr. Cromwell, I'll take your measurements. What house were you put in? I can see to it that your house emblem is placed on your new robes."
Watching Voldemort torture the ten Death Eaters, Asmodeus laughed cruelly and said, “I must admit, he can be very cruel when he wants to be, but that is nothing in comparison to me. Hmm, I think someone needs to be punished for allowing Voldemort to escape the Hells.”
“You mentioned being Voldemort’s prisoner and being tortured,” Cedric said.  “How long were you his prisoner?”
“Yeah,” Eric said.  “I was with Lane when Bletchley decided to quit, so, since I also have experience with the position, I figured I’d come tryout.”
“Welcome to Advanced Potions, sixth-years,” he said. “I am Professor Weasley.  Now, before we begin, I just want to make a few things perfectly clear.  I don’t want any of you to think that you can get away with any misbehavior in my class simply because I am younger than your other teachers.  I also want to make it crystal clear, that I will be treating each and every one of you the same, regardless of any personal or familial relationships that I may have with you.”
After a few deep breaths, as Snape did his best to bring his rapidly beating heartbeat under control, he said, “Headmaster, before this evening, despite the presence of the Riddle boy here at Hogwarts, I did not wish to believe what Alaric’s ghost had alleged about the Dark Lord.”
"It's okay," Draco said. "I fully admit that I've acted very badly. Oliver has every right to not like me."
Asheera paused and Corelian took over the explanation, “The Atlantean spouse in turn sponsors his spouses’ non-Atlantean family and friends, donating a few drops of his own blood to be sealed into each piece of the traditional Atlantean wedding jewelry, which grants them the Atlantean lifespan and eternal youth.  So, barring death by anything other than natural causes, those family members and friends would be able to stay alive and young for as long as any Atlantean.”
“Nice to meet you, Ginny,” Godric said with a smile and before Ginny could say anything, Godric asked, “Is she your girlfriend, Aarik?”
“Professor, you should also know that the Dementors are here.  I don’t know how many the Death Eaters brought with them, but shortly after the attack began someone ran into the Three Broomsticks and said that the Death Eaters had the Dementors with them.”
Wiping away his tears with his sleeve, Harry turned the book around so that all of his friends could read the inscription on the inside front cover.
"Well, they didn't actually tell me," Ryan said as he walked over. "I put it together on my own after I um, well, suffice it to say that Matthew and Oliver really need to learn to use a silencing charm when engaging in certain activities."
“Well, I don’t think that’ll work,” Ryan replied.  “I mean, I think it would generate way too many questions if we both suddenly move out of our dormitories.  I don’t think that’s something that we’d be able to hide for very long.”
“What do you mean our sadness is soon to end?”  Hannah asked.  “Albus, unless you’ve brought us here to tell us that there’s been a mistake and Cedric is still alive, which we all know is impossible, then there’s nothing you can say that will end Amos’ and my sadness.”
A smile came to Harry’s face as he thought, ‘Maybe with lots of extra practice and instruction from Dumbledore I can even do well enough in Snape’s class that he can’t find any fault with my performance. Note to self: Put Snape in his place by being one of the best students in class.’
"Thank you, Mr. Ollivander," Lily said with a smile, as she tucked her new wand into the dragon hide wand holder that was hidden in the folds of her red and cream colored dress.
“Exactly, Harry. We can’t be together like that anymore. It’s against school rules for the professors to date the students.”
“Well, I mean no offense,” Corelian said, “but you short-lived humans can be rather short-sighted at times.  You tend to live in the moment, without really considering the ramifications of your actions.  I’m not trying to say that Atlanteans are superior, because we certainly have our shortcomings, but our long life spans do force us to look at the big picture a bit more often.”
By this point, Colin’s normally creamy white skin was tinged with red and it got redder with each bubble that emerged from his mouth.  At this rate, Harry was quite sure that by the time the spell actually stopped, Colin’s skin would be redder then the red used as one of the Gryffindor house colors.
"You mean that you and Bill?" Ron asked. "But what about Fleur? Why are you even still alive, Harry?"
“Hmm, well, that is true,” Hermione said as she thought about it for a moment.  “Of course, to be honest I’m not even sure why any genealogical text would be in the restricted section.  I would think that information would be harmless and not need to be restricted, but you’re welcome to look at them if you want.”
“Because I was using my private training room for Alaric’s lessons,” Godric said.  “If you remember, I charmed the room so that no harm could come to anyone while they were in the room.  I could have run Alaric through with a broadsword and no harm would have come to him!”
“Yeah, that’s true,” said Justin, “though I can understand how Ginny certainly needs to be forewarned before she sees Tom Riddle in the castle.”
“Bill, you now how fast news travels in this school,” Ron said.  “Those who didn’t see the Prophet this morning will know every detail before lunch anyway.”
“You’re grasping at straws, Pansy,” Tracey said.  “The sooner you admit that Draco doesn’t want you, the better off you’ll be.”
“Thought I’d do a little exercising,” Nick said.  “I meant to start sooner, but I wanted to settle in for a bit first.”
“He’s Ryan’s father,” Matthew revealed.  “He was madly in love with my Aunt Alexandra and they were going to be married.  I was supposed to be the ring bearer in the wedding.  Then Aunt Alexandra had Ryan two weeks before the wedding and died.  Within a week, Corelian had left him in the care of my grandparents and had gone back to Atlantis.”
Looking around the room, Harry noticed that the people in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff looked rather indifferent, but Ron and Hermione were smiling widely at him, as were, to his surprise, all the Slytherins in the class. ‘Probably because I just earned them points, since Malfoy is technically my partner.’
“Yes, Belial, he is from Phlegethos,” Asmodeus answered. “His name is Voldemort and if I’m not mistaken, he was born some three thousand years ago. I would simply force his return to your fiery pits, where I would expect you to put him in his place and remind him of the hierarchy of the Hells, but, I am unable to act at this time.”
“Yes, it’s one of the variations of my family surname,” Ryan confirmed.  “I don’t know if my family ever used the Cromnvell variation, but it certainly is possible that they used it and someone changed it.  Not to mention that with the exceptions of Thornton and Cordelia, all of those names are in some of the more recent branches of my family tree that I’ve seen: my great-grandfather, Edmund William, my grandfather, William Charles, my uncle, Charles Matthew, my cousin, Matthew William, and my mother Alexandra Fiona Cromwell.”
“Was he the Hogwarts champion?”  Rowena asked, before Brendan asked, “Did one of the tasks kill him?”
“Hmm, well, I haven’t told many people myself,” Harry mused, “of course, I’ve only known since the early morning hours of yesterday.  So what’s the deal with my name?”
“No, it isn’t.  The restoration spell is so powerful that it will start to restore all of the books in the library at the same time.  If you tried to direct the spell at a single book, it would likely destroy it because the book would be incapable of handling such a powerful saturation of magic.”
“Yeah and everyone younger,” Kevin said.  “I’m not sure if even the seventh years would now a charm strong enough to not be detected by the charm you just used.”
“Quite simply you will all cast the spell together, thus each expelling a smaller amount of energy for the spell.  Between the six of you, there should be enough power outlaid that you can safely cast the spell.  You all may feel a little tired afterward, but it’s nothing a good night’s rest won’t remedy.”
Harry didn’t say anything. Instead he just stood up and turned to leave. ‘I tried to be nice to him, but it’s obvious he doesn’t want my help, so what’s the point trying any further?’
Moving to a curtain near his desk, Bill said, “I have one more potion to show all of you before we move on to today’s lesson.”
Rather than going to the Great Hall for the lunch period, Harry invited Blaise, Draco, Hermione, Zacharias, Ryan, and Justin upstairs to Godric’s private quarters and Dobby served them lunch in Godric’s dining room.  Bill and Nick had also been invited, but they both had other plans and politely declined.
“No, that’s not possible,” answered Aarik.  “Not without saying goodbye to me first.  Not to mention that he’s supposed to be staying at Hogwarts for winter break.”
“Yes, it was the year before my grandfather died,” Ryan said.  “They took me to Diagon Alley to buy a wand, because they wanted me to practice with it, so that by the time I started school, I’d be comfortable using it.”
Harry remained silent for a few moments as he took in the information, before he suddenly had a thought and asked, “Wait a minute, if my name really is Aarik then why are my Hogwarts letters addressed to Harry Potter?”
"Well, I do have a friend," Harry said, "that I've, well that I've, um, slept with on numerous occasions. We've talked about it though and we both agree that we're better off as very good friends then we would be as a couple."
“Before you go, for homework I want a scroll from each of you that is at least a foot, but no more then a foot and a half, all about the properties, ingredients, and history of today’s potion.  The assignment is due when we next meet, on Friday afternoon.  Class dismissed.”
“Tom, it’s not what you think,” Zach said.  “The bloke you saw me hugging was my cousin!  While it is true that I may have harbored the occasional fantasy about him, I would never, ever act on any of them.  I’m not about to give up on what I feel we have together to pursue an incestuous relationship with my Uncle Amos and Aunt Hannah’s son.”
Bill noticed that Nick seemed to be showing off a bit, but he wasn’t about to complain.  He had after all been lusting over Nick since that first day he’d met him in Diagon Alley.  The two of them continued to exercise in silence for several minutes before Bill decided to break it by asking, “I heard you recently celebrated a birthday.  Are you enjoying being seventeen?”
“Well, I’m sorry to disappoint you,” Hermione said, “but that is not the reason that Tom Riddle released the basilisk.  He did it to purge the school of all Muggle-born students.”
“Well, would you believe,” commented Oliver, “that despite what it seems like, we are not actually outdoors right now?”
Bill and Nick nodded to Ryan, as the three of them sat down in the large, overstuffed blue armchairs near the common room fireplace; Ryan sitting in one, with Bill sitting in the other and Nick on his lap.
Not wanting to waste anymore time, Asheera quickly made her way over to the Floo and stepped into the flames.
“Matthew Cromwell.  My father was Auror Charles Cromwell.  I’ve been asked to clean out his cubicle and to visit the Office of Family Services to assume the guardianships of two minor wizards in his care.  I have two people with me.”
“Yeah, I assume the Death Eater masquerading as a professor turned it into one.  That was the night that You-Know-Who regained his body and Harry had to duel with him.  Harry probably would have died that night, but he was lucky enough to buy a wand that had the tail feather of the same phoenix that You-Know-Who’s wand core came from, so that it forced the Priori Incantatem effect and Harry was able to escape, bringing Cedric’s lifeless body back to Hogwarts with him.”
I am thankful for my sire's cousin Charles getting me out of there. He certainly seems like a nice person. Ryan, Matthew, and even Oliver all comforted me after Charles left for work. Ryan told me that he especially knows how I'm feeling right now, since he recently lost his grandmother, who had raised him from birth like her own child. He said that he can't possibly imagine how painful it must have been to actually witness my mother's death, but he could understand how painful it is to lose one's mother, nonetheless. Matthew also understands the pain, as he lost his own mother about a year ago.
"Well, come September 1st, I'll take you to King's Cross Station in London," Charles said, "and you'll take the Hogwarts Express to school. Today, however, I'm just going to apparate and you're going to Floo over to the village of Hogsmeade. Dumbledore said he'd have one of the school carriages waiting for us to bring us up to the school."
Harry thought for a moment and then a smile crossed his lips. Bill noticed right away and saw the mischievous glint in the younger man’s eye. “What are you thinking, Harry?”
“Creevey how dare you take pictures of me in the shower!”  Draco exclaimed.  “I should hex you for that.”
As the last of the students filed into the room, the large doors slammed shut and the enchanted ceiling, the one thing in the room that still looked the same as the Great Hall, burst into life with a display of orange and black fireworks.  As the fireworks display ended, what seemed like every ghost who inhabited the castle, and perhaps a few that didn’t, appeared and began dancing, as the organ began playing by itself.
Several of the Slytherins looked at Salazar’s portrait, shocked, and finally Vaisey spoke up, this time addressing the portrait, “You crazy old fool!  You’re just a portrait, you can’t take points!”
“What are all those statues decorating the palace?”  Draco asked as he looked at the numerous statues, which were too far away to see any clear detail.
Bill grinned as he walked over and sat down beside Harry.  "Who would of thought it?  Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, having dirty thoughts about his best friend's older brother."
Ollivander nodded and said, "Yes, I was a Hufflepuff.  All the Ollivander males for the past three centuries have been Hufflepuffs, while the females have been Ravenclaws.  As for Mr. Diggory being your heir, I completely forgot, Madam.  I'm afraid that my age does tend to creep up on me, at times."
“Their function is the reason they’re optional,” answered Corelian, “and why some couples choose not to wear the earrings.  The earrings are actually telepathy and empathy receivers.  That is, they allow the couple to speak to one another telepathically and be able to sense the emotions of their partner.  You can block your partner from your mind with Occlumency, but it’s very tiring to do it and your partner then may also get angry with you for hiding things, so some couples simply decide not to use the earrings to avoid that altogether.”
“None that I know of,” King Erevan answered.  “The problem is that it would be impossible for Voldemort to attack any Atlantean soil contained within Poseidon’s shields.  After Zeus had laid his own magic into them, Poseidon secretly laid another layer of magic into the shields which would cause them to not only protect Atlantis from the waters of the Atlantic, but would also prevent anyone with hostile intent from passing through them.”
Looking up, Harry smiled. It wasn't Ron or Hermione, but his new friends, Ryan Cromwell and Nicolas Delaney, who were standing in the doorway.
“Yes, he was the champion,” replied Bill.  “Harry Potter was also the Hogwarts champion though, because one of You-Know-Who’s Death Eaters was masquerading as a Hogwarts professor that year and placed a powerful enough Confundus charm on the Goblet of Fire to make it draw two names from Hogwarts, picking Cedric and Harry.  At any rate, it wasn’t the task that killed him, it was on You-Know-Who’s orders that he was killed by the Killing curse, after Harry and him were Portkeyed off Hogwarts grounds by the Tri-Wizard Cup.”
"My, my you certainly have grown into a fine young man since I last saw you," Malkin said with a smile. "I only wish it was more pleasant circumstances that brought you back. I was so upset when I heard about your grandmother's passing. Please accept my most heartfelt condolences, she was a great woman and I'll miss her dearly."
“Aarik, I never intended to create all of this purity of blood nonsense and you know it,” Godric said.  “I only wanted to malign Salazar’s name so that history would hate him as much as I did.”
“Yes, I know him,” Matthew confirmed.  “I haven’t seen him since shortly after Ryan was born.  I was only four at the time, but I still remember Corelian.  I should probably contact my father.  He’ll want to know that Corelian is back.”
“You’re Gryffindor’s heir?”  Remus asked as he almost choked on his tea.  “I knew about the name, but I didn’t know you were related to Gryffindor.”
“Well, let’s see if we can find him then,” Aarik said as he pulled the Marauder’s Map, which all of the heirs know knew about, from his pocket, unfolded it on the coffee table and said, “I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good.”
The two smiled at each other and they both felt very happy at that moment.  The happiness was short-lived, however, as someone had seen the exchange.
Lily calmed down under James’ touch, as she always did.  After a moment, she nodded and said, “Yes, you’re right, of course.”
The other members of the Circle nodded their understanding and Corelian gave each member the name of a person for them to summon.  Within moments, the once quiet room was filled with the sounds of eight chanting voices.  Much like what happened in Scrimgeour’s office, the eight Circle members standing around Corelian were soon surrounded by shafts of light and spirals of energy – the colors different, depending on their sphere.
“Mr. Diggory,” Dumbledore said and when both Amos and Cedric turned to look at the Headmaster, he specified, “Cedric, I’ve been meaning to talk to you.  When you died, you had almost completed your sixth year.  I have talked with the rest of the staff and they would like you to join in on their sixth-year classes.  It will mean repeating some material and possibly more summer homework than normal, but after two years of being in Tartarus, I imagine a little refresher course before taking your final exams would not be a bad thing.”
“A fact which you’ve made abundantly clear, Harry, and if you say that one more time, I’ll be forced to deduct points from Gryffindor for annoying a teacher.”
“You’ve been taking orders from something that someone wrote in a book?” Ginny asked, suddenly very angry.

"You is most kind Master Ryan," Barin said as he bowed again before disappearing from the room with a loud pop.
Wrapping the cloak around himself, Harry left Gryffindor Tower and made his way to the staff wing, making sure to check the Map at regular intervals to make sure that nobody was coming. Arriving at the door to Bill’s quarters, Harry mumbled, ‘Mischief Managed’, and placed the map in his pocket, before knocking on the door. The door soon opened to reveal Bill, who of course, didn’t see anyone.
Later that evening, after dinner and about an hour before curfew, Harry could be found aimlessly wandering the castle. Of course, he couldn’t be seen because he was wearing his cloak and using the Marauder’s Map to avoid everyone. Of course it turns out he wasn’t doing a very good job because as he approached the entrance to the bell tower, he heard what sounded like someone crying. Checking the Map, Harry’s eyes almost bulged out of his head when he saw that the only person anywhere near was the absolute last person he’d ever thought he’d find crying: Draco Malfoy.
“I never much cared for my Aunt Bella to be honest,” Draco said after a moment.  “Growing up I always wondered how she was my mother’s sister.  I mean I could see the family resemblance, because before she was sent to Azkaban, she was a great beauty like my mother.  Of course, unlike my mother, it was only her physical appearance that was beautiful.”
“In addition to that,” Asheera continued, “there is precedent for the King of Atlantis allowing two people who are not of Atlantean descent to marry under the marriage customs.  This was usually decided on a case-by-case basis and the only people who could take advantage of it were family members and occasionally the best friends of a non-Atlantean who married an Atlantean.”
“Well, magic can do a lot of cool things,” Ryan said.  “Although, somehow, I get the feeling that Rowena and Helga may have had a hand in the decorations.  I can’t be sure, of course, but it’s just a feeling I got.”
“Yes, well, it isn’t unheard of for people to adopt a child and then celebrate the day they adopted the child as the child’s birthday, instead of their actual birthday,” Asheera said.
“Hasn’t anyone ever told you never to assume?” Nick asked with a grin. “Of course, I can see why you came to that conclusion. I suppose I should rephrase my earlier statement: I’m the youngest of the Delaneys. My parents are still alive though, in a manner of speaking.”
At this point, Zach got up from the chair he was sitting in, walked over to Cedric’s chair and curled up in his cousin’s lap, hugging the older boy fiercely as he buried his forehead in Cedric’s neck.  Cedric wrapped his arms around his cousin and soon began to rub Zach’s back.
“My dads are patients at St. Althea’s Hospital in France, where they’ve been in comas since I was two. They were involved in a car accident, which left them with permanent brain damage. The healers try not to show it, but I don’t think they’re very optimistic about their recovery.”
“My ancestors were powerful, yes,” Corelian said.  “Sinking a continent, though, was beyond their power.  It was not beyond the power of Atlantis’ Patron Deity, however.  It was Poseidon who sank Atlantis, after creating nine powerful artifacts that would shield the kingdom from the ocean.”
“I don’t have it with me,” Nick answered.  “It’s in a book of Salazar’s most secret recipes, all of which he created himself.  He’s asked that none of his recipes be removed from his lab, so I’ll have to take you there.”
“Yes Ryan, I fear that it would be too draining.  I think in order to cast the spell you should have at least four wizards, preferably more because of your age.”
“Of course you did you bloody ferret.  Harry can’t possibly be in his right mind, because he would never willingly offer his friendship to the likes of you.”
Meanwhile, back at Voldemort’s lair, still chained to the wall was Voldemort’s black-haired, dark-eyed, teenage prisoner.  Unknown to him, two days had passed since Voldemort’s last visit.  He knew though that at some point, Voldemort would be coming to see him with food and drink.
“I’m a Malfoy, Pansy,” Draco drawled.  “Malfoys don’t give in to demands, they make them.  Now, I demand that you shut your mouth and leave me alone with my boyfriend.”
“No justifiable reason?”  Scrimgeour asked.  “He’s dating a student!  Not to mention the fact that he posed nude in Playwitch magazine!”
“That hallway with the armor, the ballroom itself, this terrace,” Ryan said, “it’s like a copy of the Grand Ballroom at Cromwell Hall.  With the exception of the house banners, the enchanted ceiling, and the Hogwarts coat of arms on the floor, it’s exactly the same.”
“Have you ever met him? The Pharaoh I mean?”  Nick asked as they finished their warm-up exercises and began running.
“Ah, yes, well, I can see how that could be a problem,” King Erevan said with a smile to Corelian, before turning to Rufus and saying, “Corelian Laitannen may be many things, Minister, but crazy he is not.  I’ve known him all my life and my Queen is his sister.  Whether you believe it or not, you are now in the Atlantean Royal Palace, overlooking the City of Atlantia, capital of the Royal Kingdom of Atlantis.  It was not destroyed, despite what your experts think.  However, I am fully aware that you may not wish to take my word for it, so if you will please put away your wand, I shall personally take you on the grand tour of the city and prove once and fall all that Atlantis, in all her glory, is still alive and well.”
Adrian was soon writhing on the ground in pain, screaming, as the bone-melting pain of the Cruciatus Curse coursed through his body.  It was the first time he had ever felt the curse and it only served to reinforce his resolve to never use it on another living thing as long as he lived.
“Yes, I am,” confirmed Valen as he quickly spun a full three hundred and sixty degrees and the glamour charms that had been hiding his true appearance vanished.  Valen’s hair grew about a foot and turned from black to blond, as his blue eyes turned green and his ears reformed to form sharp points.
“You found Rowena Ravenclaw’s quarters?” Oliver asked, the grin on his face clearly saying that he didn’t believe Ryan.
“Well,” Oliver said, “Ryan, we’re honored to be asked and all, but Matt and I were planning on being bonded.”
“No, Weasley,” Draco drawled, as he spoke up for the first time.  “It is very strange, but there’s not much we can really do about it, so why dwell on it?”
“Well, you could always send him an owl,” Bill said.  “It’ll take a little bit longer, but the owl will definitely find him.”
“Yes, Nicolas,” Valen confirmed.  “Ariana Merope Riddle and Professor Angelique Josette Byrne are one in the same.”
Meanwhile, in Helga Hufflepuff’s quarters, Zach was sitting in the common room with Cedric, getting him up to date on everything that had happened over the last two years that he had spent in Tartarus.  Zach had wanted to introduce Cedric to Tom, but Tom wasn’t there.  Helga was in her frame, though, and she was delighted beyond words by the chance to meet another one of her heirs – especially one that had returned from the dead.
"Oh, Matt..." Oliver moaned, as Matt speeded up his motions, which soon sent Oliver crashing over the edge, shooting load after load into Matt's mouth. Matt greedily drank all of it, before removing his mouth from Oliver's member and moving up to kiss his lover. The kiss lasted for several minutes, as Oliver darted his tongue all over Matt's mouth, tasting his own cum in the process. The kiss continued for several minutes, before Oliver broke the kiss and returned the favor that Matt had just given him. Nearly exhausted from the activity, Matt reached over to the nightstand, grabbed his wand, mumbled, "Nox," and then returned it to the nightstand as the all lights went off.
Draco nodded.  He would have said more, but the carriage had come to a stop at the large gates.  A guard came out of a nearby gatehouse and after seeing Asheera, he bowed, before waving his hand at the gates, opening them.  The carriage then continued to move as it went through the large gates into what Draco assumed must be the Temple District.
“Okay, then,” McGonagall said as she waved her wand over a blank schedule and handed it to Harry, “You’re all done, so why don’t you go sign up for some extra-curricular activities?”
“Is something wrong, Mr. Pucey?”  Dumbledore asked when he saw the face of the Head Boy in his fire.
“Quite right, Remus,” Dumbledore said with a smile.  “The reason I asked all of you to come here today has to do with something that young Mr. Draco Malfoy did earlier today with the assistance of Lady Asheera.  This may come as a bit of shock and I’m sure you’ll think that I’m both crazy and lying, but Narcissa Malfoy, Cedric Diggory, and James and Lily Potter are no longer dead.”
“Well it’s one of the towers,” Hermione said.  “The entrance is guarded by a statue of a gargoyle.  Harry can probably show you on the Marauder’s Map.”
“Yes, sealed,” Dumbledore replied.  “I’m the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, which means I’m basically the highest judge in British Wizarding society and I have the full authority to issue an order for records to be sealed.  Only the Minister could overturn the order, but Fudge and now Scrimgeour have no idea that I ever made such an order.”
After their initial shock had worn off, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny understood my reaction to finding out whom that Charms book I borrowed belonged to.  Ginny no longer felt it necessary to research the owner, as she didn’t think anything that my mum would have written in the book would ever be dangerous.  Hermione said that she might have been a little worried if it had been my father, seeing as how he was a Marauder and all, but she said she didn’t worry about my mother.
WILLIAM ARTHUR WEASLEY – HOW DARE YOU DISGRACE YOURSELF AND THE ENTIRE FAMILY BY POSING IN THAT DIRTY, PORNOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE!  I’VE COME TO EXPECT THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR OUT OF FRED AND GEORGE, BUT NOT YOU!
The longer his conquest of Earth took, the longer Asmodeus would have to formulate a plan to stop him and due to the difference in the passage of time between Earth and the Hells, the Lord of Nessus had more time than Voldemort did.  He was determined not to let that stop him, however, as he would be King of the Hells and nothing, not even the great Asmodeus, who wasn’t all that great in Voldemort’s opinion, was going to stop him.
“Yes, I am,” replied Zach.  “I’ve talked with Helga’s portrait and I’m living in her private quarters here in the castle now.”
“You’re right,” Draco said.  “It would also mean the end of the Gryffindor line.  The name may have died out, but the bloodline ends with you.  So, many in wizarding society would say that we’re both required to have children, if only to insure that the bloodlines reach another generation.”
Harry nodded and said, “Yes, Remus and Sirius were going to kill Wormtail that night in the Shrieking Shack in third year, but I stopped them, figuring that if he was alive, he could clear Sirius, so he owes me.”
“It won’t be weakening blood purity that drives us into extinction,” Adrian countered.  “It will be the weakening of the brain that’ll do that.  And many of the old pureblood families are well on their way to ensuring that the Wizarding race dies out.  Look at Crabbe and Goyle for Merlin’s sake!  They’re both purebloods, but their families are so inbred that they barely have the intelligence to lift their own wands, let alone cast a spell of any potency.  Crabbe and Goyle aren’t the only results of gross inbreeding in Slytherin house either, in fact, I can think of one example that’s even worse.”
"We will discuss what the Sorting Hat has said," Dumbledore said. "However, first let us take care of the Sorting and the feast to follow. I shall share my comments on this turn of events after we've all eaten and I make my customary start of term announcements. Now, Professor McGonagall, please start the Sorting Ceremony."

Taking the wand and swishing it, Cedric's face was soon covered in soot, following a small explosion which knocked Ollivander off his feet and caused him to knock over several of the boxes behind him.  Standing up and dusting himself off, Ollivander took the wand and said, "Definitely not a good match."
Cedric, however, was not laughing.  He had a very serious look on his face as he said, “I’m not kidding, Zach.  I’m deathly serious and having been dead, I’m sort of an expert on deathly matters.”
Harry was sitting quietly under a tree by the lake.  It was Thursday, classes were over for the day, and Harry didn’t have to report to the Room of Requirement for Defense Arts for another three hours.  The Halloween Ball was in two weeks and Harry had no date and zero confidence in his dancing ability.
“Tempus!”  Bill said and saw that the time was 8:45 PM.  “Well, I suppose you should be getting back to the dungeons now.  As much as I’d love for you to spend the night, I don’t want to arouse any suspicions.”
“Drawing too much power from one’s magical core can result in death, so only the most powerful of wizards would even consider using a charm that constantly draws power from their cores.”
I'm not sure where exactly the time is going, because it just seems to be going by so fast right now. Of course, I'm certainly not complaining, because I'll be very happy to get out of Grimmauld Place and back to Hogwarts. Even though it isn't nearly as fancy, I've always felt much more at home in the common room or in the boy's dormitory of Gryffindor tower then I think I ever will in the opulence of Grimmauld Place.
Well, I’m getting tired, so I guess I’ll stop writing and get some sleep.  I have Defense Against the Dark Arts in the morning and I should get some rest, since Severus’ classes are turning out to be very tiring.  So much so, that last week, I was glad that I had a free period after lunch, because I came back to the dorm to sleep.  Thankfully, Blaise did wake me up before I was late for Charms or I would have probably slept right through it.
“My prisoner is gone and I think the time for this ruse to be revealed has come,” Voldemort said. “The nine of you will pay, but not by your weak mortal magic. NOW YOU SHALL FACE ME AND ALL THE POWER OF THE HELLS!!”
“I didn’t mean that I wouldn’t be upset by it,” Aarik clarified.  “I only meant that I could imagine a year without it.  We already had one, in case you forgot.”
Ministry officials speculate that if the attacking force of Dementors was large enough, the Aurors and crew could very possibly have frozen solid from the cold of the environment and the fact that the Dementors would have robbed them of any of the artificial heat they had managed to produce.  Examinations of the deceased crew and Aurors indicate that those who didn’t die from the Dementor’s Kiss died from extreme cases of hypothermia.
As everyone sat back down, Dumbledore asked the question that was running through both Ryan and Justin’s minds, “What exactly is the Circle?”
Slytherin hissed the incantation to them and they both nodded, repeating it allowed a few times to get comfortable with saying it in perfect unison.  Harry and Nikolas then pulled out their wands and moved into position next to the cauldron.  Since Harry was right-handed and Nikolas was left-handed, it was easy to hold hands without either of them having to reach across the other.  Putting the tips of their wands together over the cauldron, they waited for Snape to prick his finger and let his blood fall into the mixture, before they hissed the incantation to activate the potion.
Bill never did answer the question, because at that moment, Colin’s next secret was revealed and it drew everyone’s attention away from Colin’s photo collection.
"Surely my Uncle Charles knows at least?" Ryan said. "I can't imagine you two going at it in his house and him not knowing about it."
“Well, Ryan, now I can.  You see until you found this room, the magic that hid it from view also prevented me from visiting any other portraits and other portraits from visiting me.  Of course, after all the time that’s passed, I assume the only portraits left in this castle that would even know I’m here are Godric, Helga and Salazar’s portraits.  Tell me, have their quarters been found?”
“Mischief managed,” Harry whispered and tucked the map into his cloak pocket before removing his cloak and saying, “Hello Draco, Susan.”
To be perfectly honest, I am a bit afraid because as things stand now, Blaise is my only true ally among my fellow sixth-year boys. I know for a fact that Crabbe, Goyle, and Nott have every intention of following in their fathers’ footsteps and becoming Death Eaters, so I do worry about having to share a dorm room with them. I don’t really know the transfer student, Delaney, well enough yet to determine where his loyalties lie. He seems nice though and my cousin Ryan has made friends with him, so maybe he’s okay.
“Not who, Ryan, what.  As you can see, I have a very extensive collection of books in my library and while I am highly intelligent, even I would have been unable to remember where each and every book was stored.  So, I devised a spell which I cast upon this room.  All you need to do is ask the library for information on the heirs of the founders and it will search through my collection, find the books, place them on the table in the center of the room, and even open them to the correct page.”
“Oh come on, Granger,” Tracey Davis spoke up.  “If Draco wants to do it, let him.  It’s not as if he can’t afford it.”
“Now wait just a bloody minute here!”  Blaise shouted.  “Pansy I have never forced myself on anyone and I highly resent that you would even suggest that I did!”
“Don’t you fucking dare, Pucey!”  Theodore Nott shouted as he pushed his way to the front, his wand pointed at Adrian.  “It’s time you learned some respect!  Crucio!”
Ryan instantly felt the hat come to life, and heard it talking in his mind, just as his uncle and Matt had told him he would.
“There was also a listing for a Cedric Jeremiah Dig in the book,” Ryan added.  “Professor Weasley was with Nick and me when we saw the clue and he said that he thought that was possibly Cedric Diggory.”
September the First dawned and Harry soon found himself on the Hogwarts Express, much to his delight. It was such a relief to be out of Grimmauld Place that he couldn't even put it into words. He knew that the Wizarding World was at war with Voldemort and that the times ahead were not going to be easy, especially for him because of Trelawny's damn prophecy, but for the moment, he was determined to put it all out of his mind and simply enjoy the trip back to Hogwarts, which he had long time ago begun thinking of as his true home. Harry found himself an empty compartment in the last car of the train and sat down.
King Erevan nodded and said, “I suppose providing that proof to the rest of their government would be out of the question?”
“Well, Harry found out about it from me,” Bill said.  “He came to see me in my quarters near the beginning of the school year wanting to continue our relationship from before I was a professor.”
“How did you ever get Lady Ayala do let you take that book out of the library?”  Valen asked.  “I know my sister and how much of a stickler for the rules she is.  There’s no way she’d allow you to take a book in the Reference section out of the building, let alone off the continent.”
“Excellent,” Rowena said.  “Now, I suggest you all get some sleep.  I think it would be best if you all stayed here for tonight.  Dobby!”
Aarik and Draco both began to cry tears of joy, as they pulled Lily, James and Narcissa into a hug.  Once the hug ended, Cedric said, "Aarik, I'm not family, so my approval doesn't count as much, but I got to know you pretty well during the Tri-Wizard Tournament and I really have thought of you as a good friend these past two years that I've spent in Tartarus.  Truth be told, being able to have nothing but good feelings and memories, I've developed a sort of crush on you, but I can see that you are totally committed to Draco, so I certainly am not going to come between that."
"Well, mostly because of Matt's mom," Oliver said. "While the wizarding world has no problem with same-sex relationships, it isn't the same in the Muggle world and Matt's mom would have been furious if she'd found out Matt was gay, so we didn't tell anyone. We got so used to keeping it a secret that we kept it up after Matt's mom died."
"I'm going to go out on a limb here," Hermione said, "and venture a guess that you mean that you've slept with one of Ron's brothers, am I right Harry?"
“Yeah, you heard correctly,” said Harry.  “You know the Time Suspension charm that Professor Dumbledore taught us in Defense Arts?”  Ginny nodded and Harry continued, “Well, it turns out that there is a Dark Arts prison version of the charm which draws the power to sustain it from the prisoner’s magical core.  Voldemort must have been providing Tom with food and drink laced with Magical Restorative Drafts all of these years and kept him as a prisoner, frozen in his sixteen year old form.”
"Hello Helga," Dumbledore said to Helga as she appeared in Phineas Nigellus' portrait.  The former headmaster was in his portrait this time, but he gladly moved aside to allow one of the founders to share his frame.  It was quite an honor, after all.  A fact which was made all the more clear by the fact that some of the other portraits, particularly those of Armando Dippet and Dilys Derwent, looked jealous of Phineas.
Arriving in the Headmaster’s office, everyone sat down in the chairs that Dumbledore conjured and, as usual, the Headmaster made his normal offer of tea or lemon drops.  Nobody accepted.
“Well, Ry, how could we refuse?”  Oliver asked.  “I mean eternal youth and more time together?  We’d be crazy to say no.”
“So, all of these buildings are temples?”  Draco asked as he looked around at the various buildings, all of which were among the grandest buildings that Draco had ever seen.
“Ah, I do so love a good ball,” the woman said.  “Perhaps it’s time that his Supreme Lordship and I come to Hogwarts.”
Colin looked apprehensive, as if he wasn’t sure, if he should go or not.  Finally, Bill, who was very upset about having his relationship with Nick splashed all over the front page of the Daily Prophet, not to mention his appearance in Playwitch that his mother didn’t know about, said, “Mr. Creevey do as Mr. Potter asks or I will see you in detention every night for the rest of the term!”
Leaving Gringott's, Matthew said, "Hey, Ry? I see some friends from school I'd like to say hello to. You think you'll be okay on your own while Oliver and I go over and talk to them?"
“Pucey, we can all take care of ourselves,” Draco said.  “We’re all in Dumbledore’s Defense Arts class and we’ve all mastered the Patronus Charm.  At the very least we should send our Patronusses out to help drive the Dementors off.”
Rowena smiled as the six students did as she instructed and she then said, “Okay, now, for the incantation.  I should warn you that the results will not be immediate.  It will take a little over six weeks to reverse all the damage to my collection, but if the spell is cast correctly, you will see an arc of blue light emerge from your wand tips which will spread around the room and cause all the books to glow for a few seconds.
“Well, all right,” Hermione said as she opened her coin purse and counted out ten Galleons which she then handed to Draco, “but I insist on paying you back.”
“Would it be possible for me to summon one of the house-elves into the room to take care of the rest of the cleaning?”
Corelian smiled, stood up, and placed his finger on his temple.  After a few seconds, he pulled his finger away and a long strand of silvery material followed it and fell into the awaiting Pensieve.  Corelian gestured for Ryan and Justin to come over and view the memory he had just extracted.  Hesitating for a second, Ryan and Justin stood, reached out their hands, touched the silvery liquid, and soon found themselves transported out of Dumbledore’s office and into Corelian’s memory.
It had really gotten Harry thinking more and more about putting his rivalry with Draco to a rest.  He knew that Ron would be furious with him, but he could only hope that once he knew about the prophecy, he’d understand why Harry didn’t want to have to worry about Draco this year.  Harry was so lost in his thoughts, that he hadn’t noticed anyone approaching until someone said, “Hello, Potter.”
“I’m afraid that’s a skill I’ve never quite mastered,” Valen answered.  “Of course, I expect his Supreme Lordship hasn’t quite mastered it either.”
“Yeah, that must be it,” Michael said.  “It’s really the one disadvantage to having a pair of lumbering oafs doing one’s dirty work.”
Hermione nodded her understanding and as Adrian opened the door of the Inn, he shot off two Stunners in rapid succession at two nearby Death Eaters as Hermione pointed her wand outside and said, “Expecto Patronum,” as a silvery otter leapt forth from her wand and joined in the battle outside.
“That’s for me to know and you to enjoy,” Nick said with a grin as he leaned down and pulled Bill into another kiss.
“I take it, however, that the book with the heirs’ names has restored enough to give you some clues nonetheless?”
“You’re right, I couldn’t,” Dumbledore confirmed.  “The records I couldn’t change I simply had sealed.”
She fully understood that Draco must act a certain way in public, even if Lucius isn't around, in case word were to get back to him somehow, but when it was just the two of them, she encouraged Draco to be his true self and not hide behind the cold and unfeeling mask that his father had always insisted upon.
It was Saturday, the 26th of October.  The Halloween Ball was fast approaching and almost everyone in the fifth, sixth, and seventh years of Hogwarts were going to Hogsmeade today to buy their clothes for the dance.  Many of them had wanted to do it last weekend, but Death Eater attacks had delayed several shipments to the various shops in Hogsmeade.  This weekend wasn’t even supposed to be a Hogsmeade weekend, but because of the shipping delays and the upcoming dance, Professor Dumbledore decided to make it one, but only for the fifth year and above students.
“Orchideous!” the six students said again, this time in unison, causing a huge bouquet of flowers to appear out of their wands.
Madame Malkin nodded and then said, "Well, why don't you browse the racks and let me know if there's anything you like. I can easily change the colors of something if you like."
“No offense, Albus, but will you please get to the point?”  Amos asked.  “Being in this school brings back a lot of memories of Cedric and it makes both my wife and me very sad.”
"Harry is reading a good book," Ron said, "especially if he intends to use one of those spells on that insufferable git Malfoy."
Continuing to kiss and lick his way down Oliver's right leg, Matt soon reached Oliver's sock-covered feet. Sitting up, Matt took the right foot in his hand and began to massage it, before planting a kiss on each cotton-covered toe, causing Oliver to giggle a bit. Being careful not to bite Oliver's toes, Matt then took the sock in his teeth and pulled it off of Oliver's foot. Resting Oliver's right foot back on the bed, Matt picked up the left and repeated his actions of massaging it and kissing the covered toes, before once again pulling the sock of with his teeth. Placing the foot back on the bed, Matt then leaned down and began to kiss his way back up Oliver's left leg all the way back to his lips.
Aarik looked at James and Lily and for the first time, he realized that Hermione was right.  He hadn’t thought about it until now, but he suddenly remembered what Asheera had said about souls not aging in Tartarus and realized that his parents were now only a few years older than him.
“You know, that doesn’t make any sense,” Ryan said.  “I mean, the Sorting Hat didn’t say who the heirs were, just that they were students at this school.  Which means, obviously, someone is going to know them.”
Hoping to change the subject before Hermione really lost her cool, Harry pointed at a pair of doors at one end of the room, and asked, “What’s through there?”
‘I was so worried about you,’ Harry thought as he looked at the blond; he wasn’t sure if he should talk, for fear of waking the boy.
As the moon rose above Privet Drive, a teenage boy with a mess of raven black hair sat alone in his small upstairs bedroom. He was sitting at his desk, looking through a leather-bound photo album. The boy, sixteen-year-old Harry Potter, sat in silence as he looked at the wedding pictures of his good friend and former Care of Magical Creatures teacher, Rubeus Hagrid, to Madame Maxime Olympe, the Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy. Hagrid had wanted to invite Harry to the wedding, and would have likely asked Harry to stand for him as his best man, but Professor Dumbledore decided that it would be far too dangerous for Harry to leave the Dursleys' during summer break and travel to France for the wedding. So, Hagrid sent several pictures of the wedding and, while it wasn't quite as good as actually being there, Harry was glad that Hagrid had found happiness nonetheless.
Draco nodded, before drawling, “Yes, for example the fact that while the Ministry can detect when magic is being used at a given location, they can’t detect who is actually using it.”
“No,” Corelian said.  “Only the special abilities that existed at the time of the ceremony are shared, but through a vow renewal ceremony, new abilities can be shared.”
Harry knew that this would likely not include him, and shortly thereafter that suspicion was made quite clear when Dudley said, "You're not invited."
“I’d still feel better if we knew who owned the book before you, Harry,” Ginny said. “We can research the person to make sure they’re okay and you should avoid using any of their tips until we’re sure.”
"Don't get me wrong, mate," Ron said. "I'm glad that you're still alive, but Fleur is part Veela. I would have thought that she would have killed you by now for sleeping with her mate."
Dean was soon scheduled for Charms, Defense against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, and Fencing. As McGonagall called out, “Weasley, Ronald,” Dean added his name to the lists for Defense Arts and Unarmed Self-Defense.
Five minutes later, a rather tired looking Hermione herded the sixth-year boys down the staircase from their dormitory, just as the portrait swung open and Professor McGonagall entered the room, carrying a pile of blank schedules, as she walked over and took a seat in an armchair by the fireplace.
“From the Weasley twins in my third year,” Harry answered.  “My dad and his friends actually made it when they were students.”
After that the conversation soon turned away from Harry's love life as the five friends started talking about a myriad of subjects ranging from school and the upcoming year at Hogwarts, to when the first Hogsmeade weekend would be, and even a little bit about the war with Voldemort; although the latter topic was avoided as much as possible. Arriving at the station in Hogsmeade, everyone disembarked from the train and everything was as Harry had always remembered it, with one distinct difference. Instead of Hagrid holding up a lantern and yelling "Firs' Years!" a tall witch who appeared to be in her late sixties or early seventies, wearing an emerald green cloak over a black dress was the one holding the lantern and calling out for the first years.
Moving so that he could look at the digital sports watch he’d bought in Muggle London, Nick said, “Damn, we should get back to the castle. Breakfast started twenty minutes ago.”
"Point very well taken, Draco," Cedric said, returning Draco's grin, before he noticed the smug look on Zach’s face and asked, “What are you looking so smug about?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry.  “It’s not something I’ve told many people, just a few close friends, but I figure I can tell you.  I assume you’re gay?”
A moment later, the house-elf Barin appears in the room with a pop and says, "What can Barin do for you, Master Charles?"
Voldemort laughed as the boy curled up into a ball on the floor, with his legs and arms blocking his face.  That didn’t stop Voldemort from continuing to whip him for several more minutes though.  When he finally did stop, the boy stayed in the position he was in, too afraid to move.
“I see your point.  Of course, we also have a few things in common.  We’re both Seekers and we both lost our virginity to guys we weren’t in love with.”
"Ah, well, I guess I can deal with Wood. He was a fairly good student for a Gryffindor, though much too wrapped up with Quidditch if you ask me. Nonetheless, I do want to be here for Draco, so thank you, Charles."
“As we told you in Professor Dumbledore’s office,” Asheera said, “pureblood Atlanteans often live an average of 750 plus years.  Half-Atlanteans generally tend to live an average of 500 plus years, rarely ever reaching the 600th year.  Although like pureblood Atlanteans, Half-Atlanteans are still eternally youthful.”
“Well, I told you about the potion used to help Muggle-borns reach their full power potential faster,” Rowena said.  “He also created a non-addictive variant of the Dreamless Sleep potion and if I remember correctly, just before he died, he was working on a potion which he thought would be able to cure lycanthropy, but I think he died before finishing it.”
Justin hated seeing his boyfriend cry, but the fact that these were not tears of sadness, but tears of happiness, was consoling to him.  Justin stepped forward, placed a hand lightly on Ryan’s back, and began to rub it around in circles.  Corelian noticed the gesture and smiled at Justin, happy that his son had found the kind of love that he had always hoped he’d find.
For months now, the entire Wizarding world has been abuzz about news that came out during the Hogwarts Sorting Feast in September.  The Sorting Hat told the professors and student body that all four founders of Hogwarts had an heir in the school.  Many have speculated who the heirs might be, but now, thanks to information and pictures received from a trusted source inside of Hogwarts itself, we now know who the heirs are.
“Welcome to Fencing, sixth-years and seventh-years,” Professor Lasinius said as he turned to address the class.  “I am Professor Lasinius.  Now, some of you might be wondering why Mr. Pucey and Miss Bell are here, since you usually do not have classes with other years.  The truth of the matter is that Mr. Pucey and Miss Bell were the only seventh-year students who signed up for my class, so rather than teaching a seventh-year class with only two students, I decided it best to just ask them to join in on my sixth-year class.
“Yes, Minister, we do,” Dumbledore said.  “Hogwarts rules clearly state that students and professors cannot date.  However, there is an exception to the rule which says that if the student has reached the age of 17 and is thus a legal adult in the Wizarding world, that they may have any relationship they desire with a professor.  As for, the Playwitch issue, as I said, I knew about it when I hired him.  I am not bothered by it and I see no reason why you should be.  It is not illegal to pose for Playwitch, so it has no bearing on Professor Weasley’s employment at this school.”
As had become their routine over the last month since Nick’s birthday, professor and student could once again be found stretching near the lake in preparation for their morning run. Before now, the conversation between the two had been focused on the Weasley family and Bill’s various adventures in Egypt. Running low on things to talk about, however, Bill decided that it was time Nick start talking about his family for once. But, first, he had another question about an observation he’d made recently.
“Yes, I am,” said Harry.  “Orion and Walburga were second cousins in addition to being husband and wife.  That, Godric, I’m afraid is a side effect of the lies that you implanted in the Sorting Hat.  Many of the old pureblood families have gone to extremes to keep their blood pure, to the point that many of the older families are now so inbred that it’s really quite amazing that some of them are even capable of doing the most simple of tasks, let alone studying magic.  The most obvious examples currently at Hogwarts are Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, both Slytherins and purebloods, but their families are so inbred that they probably have the combined brain power of a slug.”
“Donate some blood,” Dumbledore answered.  “Salazar said that the potion would require a few drops of blood from someone in Voldemort’s service.  I know that you are technically in my service, but you are a marked Death Eater, so, your blood will fit the bill.  We will also need to make use of your brewing skills.  You may not be the Potions professor anymore, but you are a certified Potions Master, unlike Professor Weasley.”
"Well, there's the prison variant of the Time Suspension Charm," Kingsley said.  "But, that feeds off the prisoner's magical core.  Nobody is strong enough to last over fifty years."
“Yes, that would make sense,” Professor Lasinius agreed.  “Now, I’m not really sure what to do with you, Mr. Cromwell.  Your ability outweighs most of the other students and I’m not sure I’ll be able to partner you with anyone who would be an appropriate challenge.”
“When we’re alone if you want,” Harry said.  “There are a few other people who know about it, too, but I’d rather it didn’t become public knowledge right now.  Professor Dumbledore changed my records to say my name was Harry after my parents died so that hopefully I could revert back to Aarik once Voldemort is gone and slip into anonymity.”
“My dead godfather,” Harry said.  “Last year, there was a battle in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic, and during the course of that battle, Sirius was dueling with a Death Eater and he fell through a veil in what is known as the Death Room.”
“Guess not,” Stephen said with a smile as he packed the last of his belongings and closed his trunk.
Colin’s eyes looked like they were about ready to bug out of his head and Andrew looked like he wished he had never done anything.  Soon another bubble floated out of Colin’s mouth, popped, and the voice said, “Colin sleeps with a teddy bear named Potter.”
“Okay, well, Ryan, you go get Justin and Hermione,” Harry said.  “They’re right outside the entrance to Ravenclaw Tower and there’s no sign of any professors.  Filch is in the dungeons and Mrs. Norris is in the library.  I’ll go get Draco and Susan.  I’m friends with Draco and Susan, so hopefully I can convince them not to take points from me.”
“Have you heard from him lately?”  Ryan asked.  “I haven’t.  With the battle in Inverness this past weekend, I’m rather worried.”
“All right then, Aarik.  You can call me Blaise, then.  So, back to my question, what brings you here, Aarik?”
Pausing to reflect for a moment, Bill then cleared his throat and said, “Now, I showed you the Felix Felicis for a reason.  You see, that is the prize for today’s lesson.  One small vial each of Felix Felicis, enough for a combined twenty-four hours of luck, will be awarded to the pair who best brews today’s potion.  From dawn until dusk, you and your partner will be lucky in everything that you attempt.  Now, I should warn you that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions, such as sporting events, in addition to examinations and elections.  So the winners are to use it on an ordinary day, which will soon become extraordinary!
The only difference this time was that he was only sending two groups of ten students at a time down to the village, each escorted by four professors and one of the head students.  Dumbledore made it crystal clear that everyone in each group was to stick together like glue and that any student who was found to have wondered off on their own would have their Hogsmeade privileges suspended, 200 points taken from their house and would receive a month of detention.
Six-year-old Draco Malfoy was sitting alone in his bedroom.  Unlike most children his age, he wasn't allowed to go outside and play.  He rarely ever saw the outdoors.  So when his father came in and told him they were going out for a while, Draco was overjoyed.  Outside, Draco followed Lucius down one of the paths in the formal gardens, just happy to be outdoors rather than cooped up inside the Manor.  It wasn't long however, before Draco's good mood slipped when he saw where his father was going: the Malfoy Family Mausoleum.
Charles nodded and then said, "Yes, that was probably a good thing. Katrina would have had your head on a platter if she'd found out you were gay, Matthew. She was mad enough as it is when I refused to pull you out of Hogwarts after your second year so that you could start at Eton."
“Yes, most,” Narcissa said.  “Are you forgetting Rule #11 of the Malfoy Code, Draco?  You remember, it says that all marriages are arranged at birth for social, monetary, or political gain, and not for love.  I never loved your father and he never loved me.  We were betrothed the second I was born, however, just as Bellatrix was betrothed to Rodolphus Lestrange from birth.  Arranged marriages are just the way of the old pure-blood families.”
“I’m warning you Pansy, don’t talk to my boyfriend that way,” Draco said as the patented Malfoy death glare slid into place on his face.
A few more minutes later, Ryan had finished his breakfast and was headed back upstairs to his bedroom.
“Well, I guess not,” said Ryan as he looked at his two housemates.  “Though I’m sure you probably will be the only boys at the Ball wearing pink dress robes.”
“For coming in second best to Granger in grades,” Draco elaborated.  “He felt that as a pureblood, I shouldn’t allow a muggle-born to achieve better grades then me.  It wasn’t the first time that he’d tortured me because of that reason.  That’s the biggest reason I think why I’ve always been so cruel to Granger over the years and started calling her that name meaning dirty blood in second year.  I was angry and blamed her for my pain.”
“Yes, before school started,” confirmed Bill.  “I broke it off though once school started, since Harry is only sixteen.”
“You said that this Draco’s father killed his mother,” Godric answered.  “Well, it wouldn’t be the first time that a Malfoy man has killed his wife.  In 830, Etienne Malfoy, the father of one of Salazar’s favorite students, Armand Malfoy, murdered his wife Giselle after he caught her in bed with the gardener.  He also killed the gardener and then killed himself.  It happened the summer before Armand started at Hogwarts, the first Malfoy to attend the school.  Etienne and Giselle were in the process of moving the family to England, but they never made it.”
Everyone who knew the full truth about the real threat to the Wizarding world were among those anxiously awaiting the end of the school day.  Professor Dumbledore took over teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts for the day so that Professor Snape could spend his time down in Salazar’s lab brewing the potion, which would be ready shortly after classes ended for the day.
The boy drank his water and the house-elf then began to feed the boy spoonfuls of the broth.  If Voldemort was angry that the house-elf was helping the boy, he didn’t say anything.  Once the broth was gone, the house-elf grabbed the empty tray from the table and left.
The ten students and the Head Boy nodded to the Deputy Headmistress, before following her out of the Three Broomsticks and back up to the castle.
Ryan continued to read quietly, rather engrossed in 'The Tempest,' when Frances Simmons, his grandmother's part-time housekeeper, walked in and cleared her throat, causing Ryan to look up. Noticing that Frances was wringing her hands and had a decidedly distressed look upon her face, Ryan closed his book, stood up, and asked, "Is something wrong, Frances?"
“I can’t believe this,” Bill said.  “I’m a Hogwarts professor and I’m discussing naked photographs of my brothers with a student.  There is something very wrong with this picture.”
"Oliver, if you are going to be a member of this family," Charles said, "I'd really appreciate it if you would refrain from insulting it's members."
“Erevan, just because you married Calliara Laitannen does not mean that I am going to give her brother Corelian any special treatment,” King Tyriand explained.  “The law is the law, and the law clearly states that no half-breeds are allowed in Atlantis.  The law also clearly states that Atlanteans who are first in line to positions in the Circle cannot live anywhere but Atlantis for any period longer than a year and a half.  So, I am sorry, Erevan, but Corelian will stay here and his bastard son will stay in England.  Nothing that either of you say will change my mind, so you might as well stop wasting your breath and get out of my sight.”
Rowena laughed again and said, “You’ll have to forgive my husband.  He was always a bit vain and obsessed with staying young.  Right up until the day he died, he cast glamour charms on himself to make himself look younger.”
“I didn’t even know that I was a wizard until I got my Hogwarts letter.  It’s also when I learned the truth about my parents’ deaths, as my aunt and uncle had told me they died in a car crash.  I never had any friends growing up, either, because whenever I was close to making one, Dudley scared them off.  Ron really was my first friend.  You offered to be my friend, but when we met at Madame Malkin’s and later on the train, you presented the same ‘I’m better then you’ attitude that the Dursleys have, so that’s why I didn’t want anything to do with you.”
“Correct, Miss Granger.  Do you by any chance now what it’s two chief, and very rare, ingredients are?”
"Why don't we all sit down," Charles said. "Once Ryan gets here, I'll explain what Draco is doing here. I assume Ryan knows about you and Oliver, Matthew?"
“Now, there is a variant of the charm which will keep it active longer than a minute, however, it achieves that by constantly drawing power off the caster’s magical core.  Can anyone tell me the inherent danger in doing so?”
Harry looked at Ginny for a moment, who looked completely confused, and then quickly looked down the hidden staircase to ensure nobody was coming up, before reaching up and tracing Godric’s initials on the seventh brick up from the floor and seven bricks over from the corner.  Ginny gasped as the initials suddenly lit up, glowing a bright golden color.  A bright golden line soon shot upward from Godric’s middle initial and traced the shape of a door and Ginny gasped again as a red door with a golden handle appeared in the formerly blank wall.
Looking at Hermione, however, Harry could see the determined look in her eye and he knew better then to think that he could talk her out of anything once she got that look.
Ryan did as he was told and went out through the swinging door to the small and informal dining room that he remembered was only used by the immediate Cromwell family. Whenever they hosted dinner parties at the manor they used the Grand Ballroom for dinner. Having been married to a Muggle, Ryan's Uncle Charles was rather keen on Muggle inventions and technology, so he had the floor in the ballroom changed so that with the press of a button it would open up and a large mahogany dining table with enough matching chairs to seat about three hundred people would rise out of the floor. After dinner, the table would be lowered so that everyone could dance.
“One moment, I’ll check,” the secretary said as she stood, knocked on the Minister’s door, and went in.  A few minutes later, she came back and said, “The Minister will see you now.”
“I know and that’s why I was so happy when I found out that Hogwarts allowed professor and student relationships if the student was seventeen or older,” Nick said.
“I won’t,” Nick said as he leaned down and kissed the tip of Bill’s nose. “Not like I would need it though; Potions has always been one of my best subjects.”
‘If you only knew, Albus,’ Valen thought as he simply nodded to the headmaster and then said, “Well, I haven’t told Ryan this yet, but, the fact of the matter is I met him for the first time when he was two years old.”
“What could they be up to now?”  Harry asked of nobody in particular, hoping that whatever the Prophet had decided to print wasn’t anything too bad.
“Those are the Olympians,” Asheera answered.  “All of the statues were carved from limestone and then painted so that they’re full-color representations of each deity.  They’re all twenty-feet tall, save for two of them, which are thirty-foot tall statues of the Patron Deity of Atlantis, Poseidon, and his wife, Amphitrite.”
“I’ll tell you exactly what you did, Dad,” Alaric said.  “You summoned the devil Voldemort out of the pits of the Hells to help you breed a basilisk and keep it alive until your heir found it.  The only thing you didn’t count on was that Voldemort would cast extra charms that would allow him to return, without the binding charms you placed to control him and force him to do your bidding.
Voldemort simply laughed as a house-elf entered the room to clean and dress Tom’s new wounds and swept from the room, cackling like a madman.
“Well, that would make sense,” Parvati said.  “He is obsessed with Harry and it’s already been revealed that he like’s black hair and green eyes, both of which Harry has.”
“It would be my pleasure, Albus,” Asheera answered as she launched into explanation mode for the, well, she had lost count how many times she had explained now.  She was beginning to consider magically recording her voice so that she would not have to repeat herself again.
"No, I was born in Yorkshire," Ryan answered.  "Lived there until I was ten, then my grandmother packed us up and we moved to Asheville, North Carolina.  She died two weeks ago, so I had to move back."
“It’s a long story,” Harry said.  “The short version is that Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me the night he killed my parents, including his ability to speak Parseltongue.”
“Now it’s getting interesting,” Seamus said with a grin.  “How much do you want to bet its Harry that Colin dreams about?”
“I don’t think a broken toe is going to kill you, Mr. Malfoy,” Madam Pomfrey said, as she finished examining his toe and walked over to gather the potions she needed to give her patient.
Harry wasn’t sure what else Draco could have read into the gesture or his comments, but then he didn’t have time to question it as Draco took his hand and shook it.
“Perhaps we should go someplace a bit more private first?”  Adrian suggested in a low voice.  “We can use my room if you want so everybody doesn’t know your private business.”
“We’re at war Godric,” Harry said.  “We’re at war with the same Dark Lord who killed my parents and tried to kill me when I was only a year old.  Voldemort is an evil and sadistic bastard who takes pleasure in torturing and murdering innocent people, simply because they’re Muggles, Muggleborns, or Half-Bloods.  Voldemort was a Slytherin at Hogwarts, in fact, he’s an heir of Slytherin, who believes the lies about his ancestor that you made up and preaches how good those ideals are.”
Both men moaned, muffled by their kiss, as their raging cocks met.  Moving one of his hands from its place around Nick’s waist, Bill reached up and began to run his fingers through Nick’s short, black and blond hair.
"You know Harry," Hermione said, "it's really good to see you so engrossed in a book for once. Although, I'm sure there are much more interesting things you could be reading than a book of spells meant to embarrass people and get revenge."
Dumbledore, Byrne, and Charles applaud and Ryan looked to Nicolas and said, "Well, I guess we won't be housemates, but I do hope that we can still be friends, Nicolas."
At this point, Dumbledore took a moment to explain Sirius’ true fate to those present who had not been present when the true nature of the Veil of Baazlebul had been learned.
Matt took a moment to smile up at Oliver as he set his wand on the nightstand and mouthed the words, "I love you." Matt just grinned at Oliver, before returning to the task at hand. Grabbing the waistband of Oliver's boxers in his teeth, Matt began to slowly pull them down. Freed from the confining material, Oliver's manhood sprang up and hit his abdomen. The underwear, followed shortly there after by Oliver's t-shirt, soon joined the growing pile of discarded clothes on the floor near the bed.
The five students stood in silence for several minutes, just looking around at the room, before finally a female voice said, “Hello all.  I’m pleased to see that someone has finally found my quarters.”
“As I said before, Godric,” Harry said, “I will not be intimidated by a portrait and while these quarters did once belong to you, they are mine now and I will not ask one of my best friends to leave just because you blame his however many times great-grandfather for your son’s death.”
“Personally, I always liked Harry,” James interjected.  “I thought Aarik was a bit too formal, but I respected Lily’s desire to name you after her late cousin.”
“Yes, Harry, I have,” Dumbledore said with a smile.  “They’re really quite good.  I know that some wizards would think I was crazy to say it, but I’ve got to give the Muggles credit, they really do know their candy.  Tea, lemon drops, M&Ms anyone?”
Bill cleared his throat, obviously a bit uncomfortable, as he said, “My relationship with Harry Potter was purely physical.  We both consider each other very good friends, but neither of us saw the relationship taking a romantic turn.”
"Well, it can't be Bill," Ron said. "He seemed so taken with Fleur. Charlie, well, I don't know. I thought he'd mentioned a boyfriend in one of his letters, but he said it was one of his co-workers in Romania."
Ron and Hermione soon entered the compartment and after sitting down, Harry cleared his throat and said, "Ron, Hermione, there's something I've been meaning to tell you. Ryan and Nicolas already know part of it, but I figured I should tell you two what I told them, before elaborating any further."
"Matthew William Cromwell, will you just shut up?" Ryan said as he held up his hand to show two of his fingers about an inch apart. "I am this close to breaking the Restriction for the Use of Underage Wizardry and casting a silencing charm on you, so shut up already! I am one hundred percent totally okay with your relationship with Oliver. I don't know why you keep wondering if I'm okay with it. I mean, you know the wizarding world doesn't care about things like that. Anyway, I'd be a hypocrite if I had a problem with you being gay, since I'm gay myself."
Salazar Sebastian Slytherin also has more than one heir at Hogwarts now.  One of them is Nicolas Phillipe Delaney, 17, the son of Stephen Nicolas Delaney and Jean-Luc Phillipe Byrne Delaney who have been coma patients at St. Althea’s Wizarding Hospital in Paris, France since a Muggle automobile accident when Nicolas was two years old.  Following the accident, Nicolas was raised by his grandmother, Angelique Josette Byrne, the new Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts.  In addition to being a Professor, Ms. Byrne is also filling the positions of Keeper of the Keys and Groundskeeper.  Like her grandson, she is also an heir of Slytherin.
“Oh, Lena, dear, please,” Brendan said with a grimace.  “I agree they were fabulous, but, please don’t remind me how long we were married; it makes me feel so incredibly old.”
“I so enjoy causing you pain, you insolent little whelp!”  Voldemort shrieked as he brought the tails crashing down onto Tom’s back repeatedly, leaving it covered in bloody gashes.
“Yes, my lord,” Belial and Fierna said in unison, as Fierna trotted a few steps away, which was rather hard as Belial tried to get the hang of making his new horse-like front legs to go in reverse. Within seconds, the now conjoined Lord and Lady of Phlegethos had left Asmodeus’ palace, leaving the powerful King of the Hells alone.
"Father, no!  I won't kill the puppy, and you can't make me!"  Draco cried and tears began to roll down his cheeks as he continued to lovingly hug the small puppy as it licked his hand.
“I understand, Angelique,” Bill said, “and I would never intentionally hurt Nick.  He’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“I’m sure you’re looking forward to our visit, Valen,” the woman said.  “I imagine you can’t enjoy wearing those glamour charms.”
“No, I won’t,” Ron said.  “Don’t get me wrong, Harry, I still don’t like him, but you do have a right to make friends with anyone you want and I have no right to try and dictate who is suitable.”
Pansy was shocked for a minute because while she had seen Draco give the Malfoy death glare to many people over the years, he had never given it to her.  She wasn’t going to let that stop her though, because she knew that Draco was destined to be hers and she was not going to rest until he was.
Asmodeus laughed at his handiwork and said, “Don’t think that this change is limited to your aspects, because it’s not. Now, BE GONE!!”
“See, Pansy?”  Tracey asked, as she pointed at the magical mirror.  “Even your reflection thinks you should give up on Draco.”
After about half an hour, Dumbledore stood up and called for everyone's attention. Once silence had fallen over the great hall, Dumbledore said, "For those of you who are new to Hogwarts, I say welcome and I hope that you will be a credit to the houses which you have been placed in. For those of you who are returning, I say welcome back. Now, at this time, I usually would make some start of term notices, however, in light of the information revealed before the Sorting, I feel I must address that first.
I'm still in a state of shock, as I'm sure many people in this house are. I invited all of the Weasleys to spend the night here tonight, seeing as Grimmauld Place was part of my inheritance from Sirius. I don't know what I had really been expecting, but I honestly didn't realize that Sirius was as well off as he was. I thought that since his mother had blasted him off the Black family tree, he wouldn't inherit all of the family holdings. As it would turn out though, Wizarding law favors the male heir when determining who gets what when the deceased doesn't have a will. Sirius' parents got the notion into their heads that wills were Muggle documents and hence refused to have them drafted. So, without wills to dictate who got what, Sirius inherited the majority of the Black holdings since he was the last remaining male heir at the time of his parents' deaths.
Corelian ignored Rufus, as he continued to chant.  Four bright shafts of golden light soon streamed down from the ceiling, surrounding Corelian, before a large spiral of white magical energy began to encircle him.  Corelian lowered his hands so that they were pointing directly at Rufus and incanted a few more words in Atlantean, before a beam of white-gold light shot forth from his fingertips and hit Rufus in the chest.  The Minister of Magic glowed an ethereally golden color for a moment before he disappeared in a puff of smoke, followed shortly thereafter by Corelian himself.
“Good point,” Ryan said.  “I’d introduce you to Rowena, but I haven’t seen her all day.  I’ve checked every room and she’s not in any of her portraits.”
Lucius didn’t waste anymore time with words as he pulled Bellatrix into his arms and kissed her on the lips.  Bellatrix happily returned the kiss, as Lucius guided her over to a nearby sofa.  Once there, Lucius pulled out his wand and cast the necessary charm to divest both Bellatrix and himself of their clothes.
“Fine,” Harry said as he opened the front cover of the book and looked for a name.  After a moment, Harry did find the name of the previous owner, written in the same flowing script as all the suggestions had been.  Looking at the name in the book, Harry was suddenly overcome with tears and clutched the book to his chest.
“I can certainly understand that, Minister,” King Erevan said.  “Atlantis has been under the control of the House of Rivarendell since the founding of the kingdom and I would not want to be remembered as the King who placed the welfare of my people in the hands of Muggles.  It does mean, however, no matter how much I may wish otherwise, that I will be unable to commit any Atlantean forces to help you against Voldemort.  The Kingdom of Atlantis has no choice but to remain neutral in the war. Now, let us return to the palace and from there the Circle can send all of you back to your homes.”
Ryan turned a few more pages and came across the pages with the names written in black ink, signifying the heirs of Helga Hufflepuff.  Skimming down the list, Ryan said, “I can make out several first and middle names, but I can’t make out many of the surnames or the dates.  Let’s see here, Barnabas Ephraim, Hepzibah Esther, Ephraim Zebulon, Zebulon Jeremiah, Jeremiah Isaiah, Isaiah, I can’t make out his middle name, Hannah Elspeth,” Ryan paused for a moment and then said, “Hmm, this next entry I can read part of the surname; it says Cedric Jeremiah Dig.”
