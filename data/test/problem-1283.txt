Harry just stared at him confused for a moment, before blurting out, “I’m gay.” Draco raised an eyebrow, and he continued, “Like, really really gay.”
Draco reached an arm out to him. “Harry, wait-“
Harry snorted and replied, “Yes Draco, I do know how to read.” He giggled. “Just because I’m not in Ravenclaw doesn’t mean I’m stupid.”
Draco sighed again, and said, “Potter. I’ll be there in approximately 4 seconds. Please try not to die.” The line went dead, and Harry heard the *crack* of someone apparating next to him.
“No, sorry, just me.” Draco smiled as he walked through the door. He set a mug of steaming tea next to Harry and said, “Three sugars and a pinch of cinnamon.” Harry looked up at him, squinting a bit as his eyes adjusted to the light.
Harry pursed his lips at the odd question but answered, “Of course. He works over at Gringotts now, right?”
Harry hadn’t come to this realization quickly. Obviously he knew he was into blokes, but he never really considered anyone he was already acquainted with as an option. His small dating pool consisted of first dates with internet matches and set ups with friends of friends whose only similarity to Harry was their mutual queerness.
“I don’t know why the Harpies don’t just go ahead and make Ginevra the starting seeker. She’s not doing any good on the bench, and she can fly circles around that Malcolm chap.” He sipped his coffee and continued, “I bet she could even give you a run for your money.”
“You don’t have to do that for me, I’m fine with anything, really.” He looked down at his fingers still tapping the counter.
Harry blinked and nodded, stepping out of the way. Draco walked to the sofa and sat down. He looked back at Harry, who was still standing by the doorway looking flabbergasted, and gestured towards the empty seat next to him. Harry swallowed and slowly walked to the couch, sitting as far away from Draco as the tiny love seat allowed.
Draco’s lips were soft and warm as they moved slowly against his own. Harry slid a bit closer and placed one hand on Draco’s knee and the other at the nape of his neck, twisting his fingers in his hair and deepening their kiss. Draco slowly slid his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip and let out a soft moan. Harry, in a moment of blind confidence moved his hands to Draco’s thighs and pulled him onto his lap, never breaking their kiss. He felt Draco skim his teeth along Harry’s lip as Harry slid his hands underneath Draco’s shirt, resting on his hips and gently tracing circles on his bare skin. Draco moved his hands into Harry’s hair and tugged gently, making him gasp and accidentally breaking their lips’ embrace. Draco pressed their foreheads together, eyes still closed and trying to catch their breath. Harry opened his eyes and silently traced his fingers across Draco’s facial features like he had longed to do last night. Draco leaned into Harry’s palm, still straddling him with his hands tangled in Harry’s ebony hair.
Draco looked at the water and laughed light heartedly. “Muggles are so odd. Why would anyone throw money into the water just to watch it sink? Do they know that it’s useless down there?”
There was a short pause, and Draco remarked, “Are you drunk?”
“Duly noted.” Draco said with another grin. “Come one them, I’ll make breakfast.”
Suddenly Draco’s hand covered his, halting his anxious tapping. “A bit restless, are we?” he teased softly. Harry looked up, about to respond, and realized Draco’s face was mere inches away from his own. He wasn’t sure if it was the leftover alcohol in his system or if it was his stupid, reckless Gryffindor heart, but something in him made him suddenly close the distance between them to kiss him.
not for an abandoned plaza.
Harry tries to get a grip of himself. He’s safe. He may be trapped in a cottage with Draco Malfoy of all people, but he isn’t in any danger. Malfoy may not be the most civil person to deal with, but he doesn’t seem to want to harm Harry. He seems almost… arrogant. But not like he used to be. More like he’s trying to impress Harry, in his own backwards way. The hot chocolate Harry had made himself last night in order to relax, had turned into a competition. One which Malfoy had won fair and square. It
As the cashier slides the gingerbread men into a brown paper bag, Harry clears his throat.
Potter’s hand is warm on his shoulder, making a sudden yet persistent appearance. “I’m so sorry Malfoy, I realise how that sounds. That wasn’t my intention at all.”
Draco nods. “I really want a dragon,” he tells Harry, who huffs out a laugh. “I’m very sorry for your time,” Draco says to the man.
Harry doesn’t agree, so he doesn’t respond. “What are
He makes his way outside, glancing at Harry as he warms up for exercise. His shirt is off, and Draco’s eyes rake over his exposed chest. It’s so muscly, defined in a way Draco’s could never be. When did he get so gorgeous? How did Draco get so lucky? He pulls the door open and settles a few metres away. His first canvas floats before him, slowly stabilising in the air as if on an easel. The paints, water, brushes, and palette sit on the ground next to him.
Draco pushes at his shoulders, and Harry takes a reluctant step back. He looks up at the ceiling, and wants to throw something at it.
“Yep.” Granger’s voice is way to cheery, and I want to strangle her.
When Harry rises out of his daze and looks back at Malfoy, he finds him falling asleep against the couch. His wine glass is slipping from his fingers, wobbling dangerously. Harry smiles at the sight and reaches for the glass. He sends it and his own empty glass flying to the kitchen to be dealt with later, and turns to Malfoy.
“What?”
Draco tries not to show how fond he is as he picks up a dark red marker, not wanting Potter to catch on to how much Draco
, I think you’ll find my gifts are superior!”
On my stomach where Harry left me, I allow myself to cry. Even if he came back now he wouldn’t be able to see the tears in the dark or from the angle. I know there’s nothing to be ashamed about for crying, but I don’t want to seem weak. I’ve kept up the illusion of strength for so long. First for my father and his lord, and now Harry. The boy I think I’m falling for. I can’t deny it to myself much longer, not when all the signs are there. “Fuck, fuck, ahh!” My scream splits my own ears, piercing in the night. I don’t know how I dealt with this the first time it happened. But then, it has to be different this time. I already have a skeleton. I have no idea what this could be for.
Malfoy groans in pain as he’s knocked against the wall, and Harry blurts out an apology. The sound makes him more desperate. Malfoy is seriously injured, he can’t be bumped into things like solid dirt walls! With that thought, Harry pulls even harder. His muscles jump under his skin with the strain, his face burning with the exertion. He gives another hard tug and stumbles backwards over a root. Searing pain spreads across his head and his vision blacks out, but he hears scrabbling from the hole and leaps up again. Pushing through the pain and blinking furiously, he sees that Malfoy has an arm thrown over the top of the hole. Harry rushes over and grabs his hand. He heaves the man out of the hole and is careful not to drop him too hard.
To be continued... 😏
“Oh, right…”
“You… really think that about me?” Malfoy asks, voice small.
A thought suddenly comes to Draco, and he pats himself down. What if his wand isn’t here?! How is he going to get back without his wand?! He begins panicking. It isn’t in his pockets, or in the holster at his waist, or up his sleeves, or even in his boots.
his wand he’d rather be out of the hole than in a deeper one that’s filled in. He sighs. His ribs hurt, impossibly so, and he is covered in bruises and cuts. He’s always healed his injuries immediately in the past, not keeping any of them longer than he has to. Well, not all of them are removed—some are kept as reminders and memories—but the vast majority are. Some of these cuts will scar, he’s sure.
“Alright, Malfoy?”
Thank you
He nods slowly. “Their hair fell out.”
When Harry finally shakes himself out of it, Malfoy has dropped his hand and looks smug and intrigued. He doesn’t say anything as Harry sets the game up again for a rematch. Harry
He closes his eyes and allows his hand to trail down his chest. Goosebumps rise to the surface of his skin, and he circles a nipple. It pebbles immediately, already sensitive from the December air. His shirt is in the way, and his hand slips under the hem. He moans at the contact of his hand on his chest, and his fingers press into his stomach. They climb back up his chest and pinch his nipples, and his cock throbs in his pants. There’s no delaying this, he’s too tightly wound.
, come on,” Draco whines, trying to move Harry so his tongue slips inside.
“Exactly,” Potter agrees excitedly. “So much pale skin…” he mutters so quiet Draco can barely hear it. He drops his head to nose along his hips, eliciting a sharp intake of breath from Draco.
Draco’s head snaps up, eyes meeting Harry’s. The world spins around him, and he falls back down.
I swallow hard, suddenly nervous about the role I might have to play. It’s guaranteed I’ll be fighting my family, and now? I might be able to rip them to shreds with this magic for all I know. “Of course,” I say instead.
Time passes, the banana long gone and the warming charms fading. Harry has walked through the forest all the way to the other side, only getting scared a couple of times—at one point he’d thought he was being followed, which he was, but it was by a squirrel and not a person. He gets to the part where the trees thin, and he pushes the branches aside to see the village once again. The same feeling of relief passes through him as he leaves the forest and walks onto open ground. The village is just as empty as usual, but it’s less unsettling now. Maybe he’s just become accustomed to the deserted buildings, but it’s not as off-putting as before.
“So you’re dealing with that by putting me in the Hospital Wing?” I ask coolly. Weasley just sputters. “I’ve not done anything to Harry, and you would have to be blind to miss that.”
covered in paint?”
“I told you that thing was hideous.”
“Oh Harry.”
Harry swallows again and nods, blinking rapidly. He squeezes his eyes shut; opens them again.
He strips his clothes off quickly and pulls on his pyjamas, not wanting to freeze to death before getting into bed. The nights are so bloody cold. Draco shivers, skin prickling into goosebumps even as he dives under the covers and piles them up. He pulls them over his shoulders, only realising as he buries his face in the pillow that the sheets were never cleaned this morning. They smell like Potter.
Harry smiles at the thought, no matter how far-fetched Draco caring about him is.
A minute passes, dragging on into another, and another. Harry sits on his haunches, toes going numb where they’re pressed into the floor, and tries not to move. He’s pretty sure Draco has gone to sleep on his shoulder, and he doesn’t have the heart to move him. He looks so peaceful in sleep, a mile away from the uptight man he presents to the rest of the world. Harry likes it, quite a lot. His legs are going numb though, pins and needles creeping up his thighs.
“Harry!” Draco quipped.
Potter shrugs. “Go for it. I had the bed last night.”
off,” Harry fires back. “Besides, it’s not like
“Are you a Legilimens or something?” Harry asks, more curious than annoyed.
“This has definitely been meddled with,” Harry murmurs.
“Unspeakable Malfoy, you’re late,” Draco’s boss scolds. She is a sharp woman, always expecting the absolute best; anything less than that is worse than bad—it’s inadequate. She reminds Draco almost of McGonagall. If McGonagall was interested in dark curses rather than Transfiguring rats into goblets, that is.
I start, fright spreading through my body.
“You awake?”
“Let’s go,” I call to Potter over my shoulder.
“I can’t sleep,” I murmur.
He starts by expanding the branches, certain they aren’t meant to be squished together by the end. He screws his nose up as the plastic crinkles and digs into his hands, but he puts up with it. Plenty of people use these things, surely he can figure it out. Taking a calming breath, he continues with the rest of the tree. Up and down, left and right, the whole way around. He’s utterly sick of these colours by the time he’s finished, and he hasn’t even begun decorating it! At least he didn’t have to put it together, piece by piece… That would have sucked.
“Shh,” he whispers. His tongue reaches out to wet his lips, and my mouth parts slightly. Is he going to kiss me? His other hand travels up to my face, cupping my cheek. The skin is warm and calloused on my skin, a sure reminder of exactly how real he is. And exactly
Turning away from the mirror, Potter nods an approving head and waves his wand over himself. The signature lightning bolt scar removes itself, as well as the black hair, which fades to sandy brown once again. The eyes stay though.
Draco cries out, back arching slightly.
He walks down the short hallway from the living room, and sure enough there is a door on the left. He pushes it open to reveal a blue and white bathroom. It’s very well decorated, especially in comparison to the kitchen. He spies a massive bath at the end of the room, and tells himself that he must have one. Baths are a luxury he doesn’t usually allow himself, but since it’s right there, he thinks he has to. He’s also pleased to note that there are plenty of towels on offer, meaning he will be able to
Harry nods over Draco’s shoulder, who’s pressing his face into Harry’s neck to hide his emotional state. His stomach flutters again, nervous that he’s revealing the name and therefore setting it in stone, but they’ll all find out eventually anyway. He says it, nice and loud so that it rings out around the table.
“Hello, Professor Parsons, this is Draidan.” Potter gestures to me. “He is the one in question today.” In question? Honestly, he really needs to learn how to phrase things more respectfully.
it Draco. It’s so beautiful.” Harry beams at him, standing up and pulling him into a hug. Draco smiles into it, before remembering the canvas in his hands and awkwardly holding it out of the way.
“Malfoy,” he returns the gesture. “How are you?”
“Fine, I’ll leave your thoughts secret.
“Mhmm,” Potter confirms. “Didn’t want you to leave,” he murmurs.
Draco doesn’t stir though, just stays fast asleep with his head under the blankets.
“Ugh, shit.” Draco can’t move, stars bursting behind his eyes and pain blooming beneath his skin. He shudders and spasms, his muscles still moving as if he’s running through a forest. Slowly, his heartbeat calms down to normal and the pain recedes a bit. He only sits up when the world stops spinning, and even then it starts up again almost instantly. If he thought he was sore when he woke up this morning on the sofa, he is now in a much worse condition. He grumbles and struggles to sit up again.
Harry deflates instantly. “That might be a problem.”
It pleases Draco incredibly that the cottage had a selection of gay books, and he intends to read them all. He may not be the quickest reader in the world—he has a habit of reading books as if he’s watching them happen, so all of the dialogue (and lets be real, all of the rest of it too) are read like a story being told aloud—but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t enjoy them. Refreshed after his bath, with a mug of tea in his hands and the book in his lap, it’s almost as if he’s back in Muggle London. No one bothers him there. He isn’t ‘a boy on the wrong side of a war’ to the Muggles, so they leave him alone since they know no better. Even though some of them have problems with the fact that he likes men, they don’t stick around long enough to be much of a bother.
“Harry?” I ask as I turn to look at him for might be one of the last times. His hands are in balls by his sides, his face set. His mouth is pressed into a grim line of concentration, and I want to change that expression for even just a second. Taking a step closer to him, I lean in and whisper, “Thank you. For everything.” I turn my head and see that Hermione has completely turned away, giving us some privacy. On a whim, I wrap my arms around Harry and squeeze. It’s our third hug. I allow myself to rest my head next to his as his wrists lock behind my neck.
Harry hums, smiling softly at Draco. He thinks he knows what he’s going to say, and he really wants to hear it.
“They’re all piled down there from the last time we crashed it to do research,” Harry explains.
“What? Why?” Potter asks, worry etched onto his face.
“Well,” he starts. “You lost a lot of blood, all of which was absurdly thin and runny. The others are all various healing potions to make you more alert and to diminish pain.”
Harry chuckles, grinding his hips down on Draco’s. It's the most pressure he’s had for a while, and he’s aching to touch himself. He won’t though, this is about Draco.
“Good, mate,” Ron replies. His face flushes red and he turns around. I follow his gaze to find him looking at Hermione.
“Just like that.”
Harry shakes his head with an affectionate smile on his lips. “I wanted to talk to you, actually.”
Harry pats me sympathetically before laughing to himself and standing up. He reaches his hand out for me to take, and he hauls me to my feet. My head spins and I fall, but Harry catches me before I hit the ground. “I’ll carry you,” he offers. I don’t have it in me to decline as he charms the blood on the ground away and walks us into the drawing room to firecall Granger.
“Yes yes, it’s very exciting. Well, as you all know today’s match is between Gryffindor and Slytherin. These two teams have been training very hard so far this term, and I’m sure through the holidays, even if you haven’t seen them.”
“Where do you think he is? Right now, I mean.”
Something in Potter’s broken sound halts him though. His subconscious mind doesn’t want Draco leaving. Potter’s arms tighten in their place around Draco’s waist, keeping him firmly against Potter. Draco sighs, eyes falling closed again. He’s always liked waking up next to people, light streaming through blinds and warming them. He looks into Potter’s face again, and is overcome by the urge to
“Fuck Harry,” Draco swears. “Please.”
Harry’s eyes widen. He hadn’t thought of that at all, but it makes so much sense! “Could it be just those? Or would there need to be something else as well?”
He runs his hands up and down Draco’s thighs, relaxing the wound-up muscles. It won’t do to have him stiff and uptight. Harry spreads his legs further and inches closer, pushing his face into the gap. It doesn’t work very well, and he can’t get close enough. He groans in frustration, placing kisses along the insides of Draco’s thighs.
I disguise my wince with a laugh, unwilling for Harry to see that I’m still in pain, no matter how slight. I shove him in response and lift my wand, readying myself for the tight spiral and swooping line of the required wand motion.
of all people, but his eyes begin to prickle and before he knows it there are tears tracking down his cheeks.
“Ahem. Susan, Anthony. Is there a problem?” McGonagall can quite clearly see the problem, and looks quite amused. The two of them stutter before shaking their heads. Bones extends a hand toward Goldstein, and he begrudgingly shakes it.
Shouts of fury fill the Atrium.
“The dragon is beyond awesome!” Harry exclaims, tapping Draco on the shoulder.
Draco doesn’t know when he’d thought of this new idea, but he can’t get it out of his head. It’s wedged there, stuck amongst his other thoughts. He’d tried to tell Potter, but the Saviour had rolled his eyes and said something about being irresponsible. Draco hadn’t liked that, so he’d snuck out to try it by himself. He absentmindedly strokes his wand in its holster around his waist as he pulls the second door the rest of the way open. It’s difficult to see inside the dark Cabinet, and the streetlamp is at the wrong angle to illuminate the interior. His wand slides from the holster easily, and when he casts his
Feeling brave was never something Harry was actually good at, despite the childhood he had. Most people think he’d bite the head off a problem first and then worry about the rest. And okay, maybe that is exactly what he’s doing right now. But maybe, maybe he’s also spent so long thinking about this, that now he just wants it over with, and this is the only way he knows how. Regardless, he’s doing it.
“Fuck me Harry,” Draco says, pulling Harry back to the present. His voice is desperate, filled with want but also affection. It’s raw, powerful in it’s brokenness, and Harry can’t help it as he follows Draco’s command.
I think I understand. Well, it could be one of two things… “Please tell me it’s the former,” I murmur.
With a restrained grunt, he lifts Draco off his thighs and holds him up. Harry pushes what he can off the couch, and rearranges the blankets and pillows with a mumbled spell. He then lies himself down with Draco still cradled to his chest, and shuffles them around. Draco groans in his sleep and snuggles in closer, hands wrapping around Harry’s waist. Harry smiles to himself and pulls the blankets up and over them, careful not to jostle Draco too much.
Harry feels him shudder at the words, the movement not noticeable to the others across from them. He knows Draco can’t mean that, remembers the shaking man he’d pulled from that hole. He also knows Draco’s too proud to be affected by it in front of his friends. Bloody Slytherins.
“You’re welcome. Always.” My body feels alight for a second, on fire. But then it fades to tiredness.
Harry is the one making dinner tonight, standing by the cooktop as Draco reads in the living room. He’s nearly finished his book, and is desperate for some relaxation after a whole day of painting. Draco’s newest romance is about a sailor falling in love with the man in the lighthouse. The lighthouse keeper stops him from crashing into rocks during a storm, no doubt saving the sailor’s life. It’s not a common trope—at least, not that Draco’s heard of—and it’s really well written. It also takes place over Christmas, slightly ironic, but even better for it in his opinion. If he imagines the characters as himself and Harry, who’s going to find out? It’s not like they can see into his mind; he’s far too good at Occlumency for that.
“Then what the fuck did you mean by that?!” I spit. “How else could I possibly have taken that statement?!”
It starts to rain softly as we walk, but eventually Potter drags me into a little shop in a quaint street. It’s a lot bigger inside than I would’ve thought, and I think of Undetectable Extension charms. The walls are coloured a soft off-white, and the carpet underfoot is a light grey. The whole shop is warm and cozy, welcome despite being the middle of spring. Rows and rows of bookshelves fill the room. There are paper-bound books, leather-bound, and hardcovers. Books that cover every topic imaginable. Some are clearly muggle, with science books explaining the world as well as their range of history. And then there’s books called ‘fantasy’ which seem to be mocking the Wizarding World and twisting it. But muggles don’t know about our world, so maybe they made these all up?
“I think so, yeah.”
[Two mugs, one a Santa and the other a snowman, both doing a handstand]
Malfoy doesn’t answer, just looks into the distance.
any pain. No sparks flying down my spine. No searing between my shoulder blades. Nothing. I shake my head slowly at the MediWitch, surprise etched on my face.
Once I’m down, I clean up with some charms and head into the drawing room. After my first day here, I spend all of time in this room. Well, when I’m not asleep like I have been. I feel a lot better now though, so hopefully I’ll stop sleeping for nineteen hours a day. I enter the room and find a spot on one of the leather sofas facing the fire. I pick up a book on the table in front of the sofa and flip open to the first page. A sudden urge overwhelms me, and I cast a
Harry decides, and continues down the path and opens the first shop door he comes across. The door itself is a beautiful, warm wood. It’s attached to a cobblestone wall, and when he tips his head back he reads a sign saying “Bakers’ Dozen”. Smiling faintly to himself and imagining a busy bakery filled with happy customers, Harry pushes open the door. The little shop is exceedingly cozy on the inside, with a sweeping counter and big tables. A large vase sits on the centre-most table, and the empty glass reminds Harry of the tragic atmosphere. Something has happened here, he can feel it. It feels off. Wrong, in a way. It could just be that it’s empty and that’s getting to him, but he isn’t sure that’s it. Shaking the feeling away, he steps back out onto the path.
“You know how I like my tea.” He stated blatantly. “But I’ve never told you that before.” Draco looked away, embarrassed.
Draco once again got that unreadable expression on his face, but his shoulders relaxed a little bit. “Well, I hope whoever had you ‘drowning your sorrows’, as you so eloquently put it, is worth it.” He started to stand up, but Harry clumsily grabbed for his hand.
At this point, Harry could feel his eyes starting to close on their own and his legs start to grow weak from exhaustion. Luckily, Draco led Harry to a bedroom with a beautiful wooden four poster bed. He sat down on the edge and rubbed his temples while Draco rummaged through a dresser. He pulled out a shirt and a pair of sleep pants and handed them to Harry.
“I’ll run and get you a glass of water.” He patted the top of Harry’s head before exiting the room and closing the door behind him. Harry quickly changed out of his stiff work clothes into the more comfortable ones Draco had leant him. He ran a hand through his unruly curls and moved to lay down. Draco came back with a glass of water and a small vial.
He didn’t realize he’d been caught staring until he looked up and his eyes met Draco’s. His cheeks warmed and he but his lip, embarrassed, but didn’t look away. He tapped his fingers on the counter anxiously. Draco stared at him for a moment longer then looked away, continuing his cooking. “Are cheese toasties alright? I always like a bit of comfort food when I’m hungover.” Draco smiled at him, a small but still dazzling smile.
“Hi.” Harry grinned drunkenly at him. Draco pursed his lips, looking equally amused and annoyed at the same time.
Harry sat on the stiff, wooden barstool, stirring his drink mindlessly and staring at the glistening ice cubes, possibly hoping they had advice for him, when he heard a familiar voice behind him.
Harry walked into the living room and noticed the blanket and pillow laid on the couch. “You slept on the sofa?” Harry asked.
Draco pressed his mouth into a hard line and retorted, “Who’s the lucky girl that got to break The Chosen One’s heart?”
Harry shifted his gaze towards his friend, frowning. “Yes I’m quite aware of that, thanks.” He sighed. “I think I just need to have a few more drinks about it.”
Harry looked and his vision swam. “Um. London?” He heard Draco inhale and start to say something, but quickly continued. “I’m just kidding, hah. There’s a street sign, but I don’t know what it says. Maybe I can’t read...” he trailed off. Then he spotted a familiar sculpture in front of a small park, and he perked up. “Oh! I see my statue!” He narrowed his eyes at the golden replica of him that had been placed there not too long ago. “It’s really embarrassing that they put that here. And I don’t think I’m actually that tall.”
They walked in comfortable silence for a bit. The restaurant hadn’t been busy, so Draco had a few minutes to spare before he needed to return to his shift. They decided to take a seat on the edge of an old fountain in the middle of the square.
"I get it," Harry finally mutters.
“I… Well, uhm…” Potter’s probably doing that infuriatingly charming thing where he scratches the back of his horrible nest of hair and slouches. “I asked your parents, actually.”
know what the stars are? Well, Adriana hasn't ever seen them herself, of course, but she still knows what they are! They're among the most important things in the world, and their loss is still heavily lamented even a hundred years after it occurred!
A lock of hair slides free from behind her shoulder and he watches as it hangs in the air between them, suddenly feeling a deep pressure in his head.
"Why wouldn't I dare, High Inquisitor Umbridge? What are you going do? Use illegal items on me to cause pain and try to torture me into silence?"
He pretends to sleep in Harry’s arms, while really listening to his would-be husband cry himself to sleep. They’re trying to shield him from it, he realises, but he wishes they would just be honest.
He shudders and turns on his side, squeezing his eyes shut.
"I really need to leave," Harry whispers, though his hands still hold Draco tight. "I really wish I didn't need to, but I do."
Harry rolls his eyes, but looking at Cassiopeia’s interest, he gets an idea.
Harry’s heartbeat is loud in his ears as his heart pounds in his chest. His lungs burn as he pants for air. His legs are screaming in protests as he continues to push them to their limit, forcing himself to run ever faster.
He makes sure to start immediately, while he can still write with a steady hand, before the tremors set in too terribly. Before his head hurts too much for him to be able to read or concentrate on what he wants to say.
Draco’s eyes widen and he stares at Harry in mute horror.
"Harry... Be careful okay?” Black’s voice is soft, but he still sounds determined. “I'll contact Dumbledore, and we'll probably set up some sort of trap for You-Know-Who to make sure that the Ministry can't keep their eyes closed to the reality of his return anymore. Just... stay safe, okay?"
Clearly unable to turn them down, despite the obvious pull he feels towards 'somewhere else', Draco ends up staying. He continues to sleep in one of the rooms above Adriana's mother's tavern, he continues to help working there, and he continues to make the most amazing works of art.
like he is. But how can Draco be entirely sure? Appearances
Draco shudders and seems to pull himself together, and then he swiftly opens the vial and before Harry knows it, one drop of Basilisk venom lands on each of the windows of the open locket.
"It's a kind of crystal that is tightly connected to life energies. Very useful for healing magic or fertility magic if someone is trying to have a baby." Draco bites his lip and looks back towards the crystal. "The larger they are the more powerful but... I've never seen one so large before. I don't know how they got it, but this explains how they've managed to create so many Inferi."
“Look. Harry’s a total dunce who doesn’t always think things through. But!” She raises her and Patil’s entwined hands into the air. “We were two bisexuals dating and we broke up before the war ever happened! And we’re both dating people of our own sex, currently. Well, unless you really
He doesn't like thinking about
"I… I understand if you don't trust what I say, because I've realised what it has sounded like for you, but… You parents ordered two Portkeys, and Ginny and some others—including your parents—are ready to come over as soon as I send a signal… If you need Ginny to back me up."
“Who have we lost?” Lavender asks. “Among the teachers, I mean."
Harry had just looked at him then and knew,
The idea that his parents hadn’t really fought, that instead they’d deserted the Death Eaters and started searching the castle for him was… Unthinkable.
think that they would have done so closer to the war, when the wounds were still fresh. Before Draco made friends with Hermione Granger. Before he mended the relationship between the Malfoys and the Weasleys—what a miracle that had been. Before Draco and Harry mended their bridges and were set to marry come summer.
But it's... it's
He hadn't waited a single second once he'd understood what Adriana was saying, instead heading directly towards... oh goodness, the God of the Sun.
“Ron! Malfoy’s…”
Potter enters Draco's bedroom, and all Draco hears then is a loud sigh. Of course he's somehow disappointed Potter, that has to be what that sigh means.
Life is good,
“I would
Harry grumbles, but sits up and rubs his scalp as he yawns widely.
He rubs at the tears on his cheeks, wishes the flow would stem so he could appear stronger than he is. So he could at least look a bit less pathetic than he is.
into Hermione's bag, so they'll at least be able to summon the satchel if not the locket itself if they need it. He's not sure why they would need it now that the horcrux is gone, but he supposes that it is an important historical artefact.
He wonders what it was that finally made him remember, what it was that finally caused it all to come back to him.
“I saw your dad at the cemetery when Voldemort rose, Malfoy. He has the bloody Dark Mark!” Potter’s
make Harry feel better about it, even though it wasn't the main thing he was dealing with. The Dursleys have always been... As they are, about things they consider different. And considering Dudley's snide remark about Cedric...
She looks flustered suddenly.
,’ Harry thinks.
He loses himself in the memory of being pressed against Potter’s back, screaming himself hoarse in fear and rage. Vince…
A glance back at Umbridge tells Harry that she sort of looks like Malfoy just slugged her in the face.
Harry shares a long look with Lucius Malfoy, and knows that they're thinking the same thing: they don't always agree, they don't like each other, but for Draco’s sake, they're both willing to do just about anything. Keeping each other safe is not much of a hardship, all things considered.
It could be a ploy. He could absolutely be lying, playing on their reverence for the gods.
to do with Potter's lusts.
Draco
“Leaping toadstools!” Hermione yells at the Fat Lady as they near the portrait.
He'll need to contact Pansy and Blaise immediately, make sure they're okay with heading off on Sunday.
They sneak through the house until they finally get to a blank wall. There's nothing but fancy looking wallpaper. They've already passed a few doors, but the place where Draco stops, there is no door.
Potter may think he’s an adult and nigh on unstoppable, but Draco
project—but he’s really not pulling his punches.”
When he opens his eyes again—he’s surprised that he does, he didn’t think he ever would again—he’s in a place he doesn’t recognise. The bed isn’t his bed, it feels different, smells different. The room isn’t his room, it’s white and small, it doesn’t have any of his furniture and… And the bed isn’t big enough for Cassiopeia.
Draco died, too, didn’t he?
Draco sneers. “And who says I’m going to answer them? Now release me!”
Draco sighed. “Bloody Gryffindor’s. Ridiculous romantics, the lot of you.” But he beamed at him and pulled Harry in to kiss him again before saying, “Harry Potter, you have the most brilliant soul I have ever had the privilege of encountering.”
Harry wanted to keep listening, wanted Draco to talk to him until his voice gave out, but exhaustion was slowly taking over. He softly squeezed Draco’s hand and murmured, “I’ll always know that. I’ll remember.”
He heard Draco’s breathing, not slow and even, but not panting either. Harry was vaguely aware that he was still clutching Draco’s hand. “I know that there’s no excuse for my actions. I’m well aware that I hurt more people than I can even begin to understand,” he hesitated, “but I hope someday I’ll be remembered as someone who eventually started to help rather than hurt.”
Harry giggled and grinned, and thought ‘what the hell?’ He stepped outside and clicked the call button.
Harry and Draco’s paths began to cross quite frequently, Harry working in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and Draco being the healer to patch up his wounds when his Gryffindor heart outweighed his rational brain and got him into dangerous situations. The fifth time Harry ended up at St. Mungo’s, Draco simply shook his head and muttered, “We have got to stop meeting like this, Potter.”
Put together, ready for the day Draco was already a sight to see; his pure blood upbringing instilled a need to constantly look flawless, no wrinkles or hairs out of place. He had immaculate posture, and one could tell by merely looking at him that he was someone important. But rumpled, hair perfectly messy, fresh out of bed blinking sleep from his eyes Draco? Well.
Ron looked startled, but replied, “Harry that’s great! Anyone I know?”
They paid for their food and began to walk towards the hospital. There had been a misfired jinx at Harry’s work, resulting in all of the plumbing pouring out fruit pastilles instead of water. It didn’t seem like that big of a deal to him, but he was glad to have the rest of the day off regardless.
Harry stared at his face, so gorgeously illuminated in the moonlight, sharp edges softened by the glow. Even in his drunken state, he wondered how he missed this; how he hadn’t recognized the burning need to stroke his ivory skin, run his fingers over his sharp nose, his lips...
“Here.” Harry said and reached into his pocket and pulled out two sickles. He handed one to Draco and closed his eyes. “I wish that the pipes get filled with candy at work more often so I can spend more time with my dear friend Draco.” He threw the coin over his shoulder, and it splashed into the water. Draco smiled. He stared at the coin in his hand for a long moment, and just as Harry was about to open his mouth and say something, he closed his eyes and closed his hand around the coin.
Draco shrugged. “My bed was a bit occupied for the night.”
As Harry drifted off to sleep, Draco whispered, “Thank you, Harry.”
“Wait no.” He frowned. “Keep talking, I want to fall asleep to the sound of your voice.” Draco’s face reddened (and Harry was way too drunk to consider what that meant), but nodded and sat back down.
Draco stood in the doorway with a tentative smile plastered on his face. He held up a brown paper sack and said, “You left without your breakfast.” Harry blinked at him, not processing what was going on. “Er-“, Draco rubbed his hand on the back of his neck, “can I come in?”
“I never showed you even an ounce of kindness, yet you risked your life just to save me. I didn’t know anyone could be that selfless.”
He would occasionally have a beer with friends at dinner or a glass of firewhisky on special occasions. He was typically the designated sober friend when Seamus and Ron wanted to get drunk and sing karaoke in muggle bars, ensuring that they made it safely to their homes at the end of the night. He didn’t mind; he loved seeing his friends happy.
Draco nodded and continued, “He and I had a sort of fling in our fifth year. Very casual, very secret, but still very real.”
“What would you like me to talk about, then?” Harry closed his eyes and relaxed. “Tell me more about your wish. At the fountain.”
Draco quirked up an eyebrow. “You mean why didn’t I tell you that I’m gay, or why didn’t I tell you that I’ve wanted to snog the hell out of you since I was fifteen? Either way, it’s not something that just easily comes up in conversation, Potter.” He rolled his eyes but stroked his thumb against Harry’s face.
After getting over the initial awkwardness of ‘used to be enemies but are now grown adults with bigger issues’, they started to form an almost friendship. They both frequented a small, family owned Middle Eastern restaurant on their lunch breaks that was nearby the hospital, and after running into each other one two many times, decided to start sitting and eating together. “Because there’s no need to give the staff double the work, Potter.” Draco had scoffed when Harry had raised an eyebrow at his suggested arrangement. But he never complained.
He quickly disapparated, leaving Draco standing in the kitchen looking confused, his arm still extended towards Harry.
Harry mumbled a thanks and slid his glasses onto his face. He downed the potion in one gulp and grimaced. Draco laughed at whatever face Harry was making. He grumbled, “Remind me never to go near alcohol again.”
Harry laughed and took a bite of his falafel. “She could definitely kick my arse at this stage in my life. I haven’t been on a broomstick since the last time I tried to give Rose Weasley a flying lesson, and I think even she was better than me by the end of the day.” Draco flashed an easy smile at him.
“Thank you for, um, all this. I-“, he pinched the bridge of his nose. “See you later.”
Harry snorted sleepily. “I’m usually not one to drown my sorrows, but there’s a first time for everything.”
Harry met Draco for lunch at their usual spot. They were talking about the recent Quidditch match that they had both read about in the Daily Prophet.
'Malfoy' with a little green snake emoji.
Harry woke up the next morning feeling as though he had been repeatedly run over by the knight bus. He groaned and sat up. With a start, he realized he was not in his bedroom. He looked around the light grey room as the events of the night before came flooding back to him. “Oh Merlin.” He moaned and put his head in his hands.
He frowned. “Uh oh. ‘Mione says baby Hugo’s got a stomach bug. I better get home and relieve her for a bit.” He stood up and said pointedly to Harry, “It’s not the end of the world, mate. If you think it’ll work, ask him out. If you don’t-“ he shrugged “I guess you’re on the right track.” He gestured towards Harry’s empty glass. “Listen, don’t try and apparate in your condition. Get a cab or something, and call me if you need anything.” Harry grunted a response, not knowing if he could say anything coherent in his state. Ron patted his shoulder again, then turned and headed out the door.
“How do you know it’s a bloke that’s got me gutted?” Harry replied, still staring down at his drink.
He murmured a simple, “Hello.”
Harry vaguely noticed that he didn’t quite recognize where they were, but he was focusing most of his attention on breathing steadily. He was extremely aware that Draco kept a firm hand on Harry’s waist as they walked up the stairs to a quaint little townhouse. Draco unlocked the door with the key and quietly let Harry inside.
Ron spluttered a bit, then finally said, “Well, it could be worse. At least he’s pretty attractive.”
“Hmm”, Harry mused happily, and said, “Extremely.”
Harry grinned and pushed him down on his back into the sofa and moved to hover over him. “Now who’s the romantic?” Harry stared into those granite grey eyes and smiled before kissing him once again.
Harry stared at him blankly until realization dawned on him. “So...you’re saying that you’re-".
He was so beautiful Harry could cry.
But Draco was...well, Draco. He would insult and tease you to your wits end, but was fiercely protective of the people he loved being their backs. He was outwardly cocky and arrogant, but when Draco sat next to Harry’s bed at St. Mungo’s chatting with him hours after his shift ended, he would confide in Harry all the ways he was immensely unsure of himself. He confessed how frightened he was that someday he wouldn’t be allowed to continue his work because the wrong person wouldn’t want an “Ex Death Eater” saving their life. He admitted that he had been utterly terrified during the war; that he wandered out early on, but had no idea how to get out without risking his and his parents’ lives. He even thanked Harry for the time he saved him in the room of requirement.
But after the day Harry had, he welcomed the blurred around the edges effect that crept into his vision as he downed his 4th drink at a local pub, and it was all because of Draco Bloody Malfoy.
Even after all that, Harry still hadn’t put a name to what he was feeling for Draco. He couldn’t pinpoint what it was until that morning; the morning that caused him to end up in the pub in the first place.
“Please.” Ron scoffed. “You’ve been staring at that drink like it might lay you on a couch and start giving you relationship advice.” He took a swig of his drink and added “Plus I’ve known you since you were eleven, mate. You’re not as mysterious and hard to read as you think.”
Just as quickly as it had started, everything suddenly stilled. “Harry.” Draco whispered. Harry opened his eyes to see Draco staring at him intently, with the same soft and confusing look as earlier. “Come on, I’ll help you up the stairs.”
Harry shook his head and sighed. “I’m drunk.”
Draco looked at him softly, expression unreadable, and asked, “Are you ready?” Harry swallowed and nodded, trying to ignore how close their faces were. Harry closed his eyes and hoped he didn’t vomit as the familiar feeling pulled at his stomach and the air swirled around him.
That made Harry laugh and then groan. He put his head in his hands. “Ron. I think that I might fancy someone.”
Draco let out an exasperated sigh, and there was a shuffle of movement on the other line. “Where are you?” He demanded.
that she was the leader he saw that day in the forest. He’s surprised she had it in her, but clearly her morals aren’t what Harry thought they were.
“Hold on,” he says, raising a hand to stop Draco starting on whatever rant he’s aching to go on. “If the cotton and leather are for the second and third year, and the bracelet is for the first, we’ve completed a set!”
“Then you can’t, can you?”
Harry moans around him again, sliding his tongue along his shaft. Draco curls his fingers in, his nails digging into Harry’s head. He thrusts even faster, hips hitting Harry’s face every time. Spit and drool escape out of his mouth with the increased speed, his stomach tightening at the sight he must make. He wants Draco’s come in his mouth, wants him to shoot down his throat. He’ll get it.
“Sam.”
Horror drips down my spine, but I smile and nod at the half-man in front of me. I tell him that I think it’s a marvellous idea, and will really
“M’lady,” he says, unable to help himself.
Draco feels his eyes widen. He looks down. Sure enough, his trousers are coated in a thin layer of ash from the fireplaces. Sighing to himself for not thinking of an anti-dust shield, he quickly spells himself clean. Ignoring the last half of the question, he answers, “Looking for a way back to London.”
,” he gestures around at the cottage and forest, “I haven’t gotten any shopping done. ‘Mione will kill me!”
“I don’t know…” I sigh before stretching my hand out to him. He looks baffled for a short moment, before reaching out his hand to shake mine.
“Because,” Potter explains with an annoyed tone, “it’s about your
“Hmm? Oh, yeah. Just thinking.”
“Shhh,” Harry says carefully. I can feel his eyes staring, burning holes into my bare back. “It seems,” he murmurs into my ear, “that they are retreating into your skin.” I was right.
“Good, I wouldn’t have changed my mind even if you thought it was the worst thing on the planet.”
Harry is so close to me my brain is melting and I’m no longer thinking straight. My gaze slides down to his lips for a split second before I pull them back to his eyes. They are sincere and filled with longing, and I don’t know how I managed not to realise. I shrug Harry’s hands off me so I can move, and throw myself at him. Our chests collide with a dull thud and I wrap my arms around his neck. Our faces are nearly touching, mine slightly higher than Harry’s. His eyes are even more green this close up, his glasses reflect me in the transparent and fragile lense. Harry shifts his arms so they are around my waist, and pulls me that last fraction closer.
“Much better,” he murmurs, a beat too late but not caring.
“Calm down, Malfoy. No one knows it’s you, you’re Glamoured.”
Granger’s head of wild, curly brown hair pokes out through the Common Room door and squints into the darkness. Her face lights up when she sees Potter, and hurries to embrace him.
“What do you
Harry shrugs. “Didn’t know it needed one.”
Harry never backs down from a challenge. “Relax, I can see your hands grabbing the sheets, I’m not here to talk about
down to get started.
He forces his thoughts away from Draco and to what will happen when he’s completed this. Hopefully, McGonagall will get all the students back to their dormitories where they will be able to sleep tonight. The only problem with that plan is that the box is still down in the dungeons, so the Slytherin’s won’t have access to their common room. Harry realises now that there is a set of rooms that have been all but abandoned for 16 years, sitting in one of the towers. He shakes his head. No, surely they wouldn’t reopen those rooms. But what other choice is there? His stomach twists at the thought of another group of students using the rooms his own year group had been forced to occupy.
“And it is sometimes possible for them to get their wings back.”
they won’t
that, but Draco Malfoy is here too, and…” Harry says, voice trailing off at the end. Draco sits on the sofa silently, waiting for the invitation to be retracted at the knowledge of his presence.
“You can say that again.”
Harry arches his back, desperate for more. “Anything,” he whines, heading tilting and his hands seeking out Draco.
“I don’t know,” Draco confesses, rubbing the back of his neck. “Don’t you ever want to shut off the people judging you, or those mindlessly worshipping you?”
They stay like that for another half hour, but then Harry’s legs go numb and he can no longer feel his hands. He pushes Draco off him, grumbling, and stands up. He stretches, shaking his legs and arms out. Draco mumbles something Harry doesn’t catch, and when he faces him again he finds his eyes glued to Harry’s stomach.
“Do you… do you think it’s working?”
I offer the woman my hand, and she shakes it gladly. “Mr?”
Once everything clicks into place for the first 10 metres away from the Great Hall, Harry drops his shield. He holds his breath, waiting to be hammered with rain and hail. When that doesn’t happen, he exhales harshly. It’s so draining, and he has hundreds of metres left. Quite possibly over a kilometre. He chews his lip but paces towards the end of his shields, watching as snow falls around them. At this rate he’ll be going all night. He wipes his forehead, flicking off sweat that’s somehow formed in the bitter cold, takes a breath, and starts the process again.
Harry pulls things out from the first tub, laying them out on the floor. Fingers crossed for neutral colours (aka silver and literally nothing else) he sorts through them. He finds multiple strips of tinsel, a weird thing of beads, and a lot of glass ornaments. Everything else is red, or green, or gold. Gold might be okay, but it might also lean into the yellow and orange of the tree, and over power everything else. Damn rainbow tree. He’s going to kill whoever thought this tree was a good idea.
“No!” Potter cries. “You can not leave this house!”
~~~~~~~~
Malfoy swallows, and Harry watches his Adam’s apple bob. “I was painting.”
“You keepin it?” Harry asks in broken English. I scowl at him and he grins at my expression.
The food arrives on the table, a platter of fruit and sandwiches appearing out of nowhere. Draco makes a mental note to thank the house elves, even though they won’t appreciate the gesture. Once the food is eaten, tea is brought out along with an array of small cakes. Then it’s time for gifts, and Draco has no idea what to expect. Normally, there’d be dozens of people here, with all the presents on a table divvied up by the house elves. With only three people in total though, he doesn’t quite think that’s necessary.
hate him. He is in the middle of a very thick, very snowed-over, evergreen forest. He screams a string of curses, safe in the knowledge that no one could possibly hear him.
Draco feels his arse being kneaded, and he forces his hips to stop rocking into the mattress. Air moves over his entrance as his cheeks are pushed apart, causing him to gasp. Harry runs his finger gently over his hole, and Draco shudders.
the village was abandoned. It can’t have been all that long ago, considering that the parlour looks quite modern and up to date with standards. Harry would know, since his job is literally catching criminals hiding behind store fronts—of which the most common mistake is that they don’t match requirements after a while, so Harry is very familiar with them.
*~*~*~
which one he’ll use. The cottage is proving itself to be a very good find. Closing the door, he continues down the corridor. It opens up to a massive room the size of the kitchen and living room combined. Only… there seems to be a problem. Quite a big one at that.
“If I could invite the Heads of House to pin the badges onto these Representatives, I would love that.” The teachers stand up and walk over to us, each holding a shiny, black brooch. Professor Slughorn happily approaches me, pinning the badge onto my robes. He nods at me and then stands at my back. I feel eyes on me, and I turn to my right. Potter is staring at me, confusion etched onto his face. I sneer at him, and he hurriedly turns back to the audience. McGonagall finishes her speech about our roles in the school, and the rules we have to follow and enforce on the others. She then closes the assembly, and sends us off to our classes.
Harry smiles, hand moving up his face to brush some of his hair away. “Thank you,” he murmurs.
“Shit!” Harry shouts, leaping out of bed and tugging me after him. “It’s Narcissa! She’s awake.”
“And what is that meant to mean?”
Cautiously, he reaches out a cold hand to the door handle. The silver burns his hand in the freezing air, but he grits his teeth. He’s still in the courtyard, so it can’t be activated through the handle. Pursing his lips, Draco turns the handle and tugs it open. The door slides out smoothly, the sound of wood against wood is pleasant and homely. When Draco opens his eyes—he hadn’t realised they’d closed—he finds himself still in the courtyard. This time he does curse the gods. They deserve it, he thinks. They’ve put him in this exact scenario, probably deliberately, and Draco thinks he’s very much in the right to be angry with them. Breathing heavily in his anger, he runs his eyes over the inside of the Vanishing Cabinet.
“Oh! You’re alive! Great!” Harry says the second Draco comes into view. “
cold. Draco pulls the blankets tighter, wrapping himself in them further, and takes a step. He is so tired. All he wants to do is flop into bed, go to sleep in the sun. He can’t. Draco physically shakes himself. His brain is shutting down with the cold, but his mind is still capable. He can beat the instinctive need to hibernate like an animal.
He shivers, cold shooting through his body as he becomes drenched by the rain. It’s freezing, made even colder in the winter air. There’s nothing he can do to get out of it, trapped as he is at the bottom of a hole. A thought occurs to him. It’s stupid, it could never work. But what if it does? He clutched at the idea like a beacon of hope. Draco heaves himself up from his knees, scowling at the mud stains. It’s worth a try at least—he can’t get much worse off than he is now. He pulls himself to his feet, hands clutching at the wall for balance. The dirt is mixing with the rain, and mud runs down the wall and onto the wet floor. He purses his lips and steadies himself. His freshly-cleaned wound is covered in dirt again, but there’s nothing he can do about that. The rain will wash most of it away over time anyway. Besides, an infection isn’t going to matter when he’s dead.
“What if we swapped over and looked at what the others have done? And then meet up at the end to discuss opinions?” I counter Bones, and smirk at her. Goldstein shoots me a thankful look and nods. Harry just laughs and passes over the parchment with all of our plans on it. I receive an answering page with the plans for the lake carefully written on. I run my eyes over the neat lines, before Harry rips it from my hands and reads it with a First Year’s excitedness.
Potter grunts from under the covers, goosebumps tracking down his arms even as his breathing evens out. Maybe Draco’s watching him too closely…
“Alright then,” he murmured. He didn’t want to put any pressure on Harry, so he stood in silence. The cabinets were cold where his back was pushed against them, but Harry in front of him was warm and alive. Even if he was crying and shivering. Harry had stood there for a while, long minutes stretching, not that Draco was counting. His bath could wait.
fell short.
“The tree…” Draco mutters, and Harry follows his gaze with a raised eyebrow.
“No idea,” Potter confesses.
“Fucking cottage.”
Harry tugs me out of the room the second I’m clothed, closing the door behind us and not looking back. It’s strange. I assumed that he would want a bit of time to look around. To remember everything that’s happened here, to take time to say goodbye. Chances are we won’t come back here after today. I thought he would have wanted to grieve his godfather’s house, but apparently not.
Harry snorts. “You up for one?”
“Did you?” Draco asks, hurt buried deep beneath his tone, as he turns around to face Harry. “Or did you make the right decision?”
“I really need to run more,” he says.
“Not the time,” Ron snarls, pushing the Slytherins aside to approach Harry and Draco. “I’m sorry mate. What we did was uncalled for, I see that now.”
Harry laughs at him from the kitchen. “There’s a potion for you on the table.”
“Well we most definitely aren’t
“They’re re-emerging!”
Potter gets up after a minute, and Draco watches as he shuffles slowly towards the fireplace. Draco kicks himself, having totally forgotten it was there despite it being right in front of his face. Potter swishes his wand and lights it, holding his hands out to warm them up. He moans as flame licks around his skin, even as Draco cringes. Fire doesn’t sit right with him, and Potter looking so happy in its presence has his chest tightening painfully.
The second Harry claps twice, the game commences. Light is immediately extinguished, and everyone runs off in the dark. I look around, squinting and willing my eyes to adjust to the lack of light as quickly as possible. The point of the game may be to test my skills, but I would also like to get used to being in darkness. I turn around, lazily walking in circles and keeping my ears peeled. A scuffle off to the left of me alerts me to another person close by. Determined, I dim the lights even further and creep off away from them. The person turns out to be Ron, his disgruntled slurs very distinct.
Potter’s smile drops, but then picks up. “At least we made some progress today. I say that calls for hot chocolate.” He swipes the leather out—Draco winces as Potter forgets to check for curses—and pushes the drawer back into place.
“Technically, it’s two weeks tomorrow. May second.”
Harry’s heart hammers in his chest, his mouth going dry. He wants to say it. Even though it could ruin him down the line, he wants to say it. “I…”
shut it properly. Meaning someone else has opened it.
“You?
A part that’s actually on time for once *sweats nervously* I hope you enjoy it!
from his surroundings.
Harry is quick to respond, and Draco can taste himself on the other man's tongue. Realising that Harry has both sucked his cock and rimmed him, and received nothing in return, Draco starts running his hands over Harry’s chest and back. Harry groans, which only encourages Draco more. He pushes Harry back and climbs over him, hands splaying on Harry’s chest to keep his balance. Draco runs his hands down Harry’s stomach and follows them with his tongue. Harry shivers as Draco reaches his navel, and Draco licks a strip up Harry’s cock. Delighting in one of Harry’s many sounds, Draco sucks the head into his mouth. He’s very aware that he can’t do this for long, not willing to have his rim tighten again before Harry’s glorious cock can enter it.
He sighs, scrubbing his hand over his face. He shouldn’t think about it. Tries not to. Hermione and Ron are great, but they are so preoccupied with each other that Harry always feels out of place around them. Molly doesn’t understand, and although she tries she’s being more bothersome than anything else. The truth is, Harry doesn’t have many friends at all. He’d never thought about it, but it’s true.
Robards startles out of his thoughts—a habit he’s picked up recently—and rushes over himself to explain the situation.
“So. Spells.”
“You don’t even like decorating! Actually, I know for a fact that you hate it!” He states, acting like that changes the need for common sense. I roll my eyes like I usually do and gesture for him to start walking again. He releases a breath, calming himself down, and takes a couple of steps towards me. He is less than an arm’s reach from me, and I feel my face starting to heat. He then leans in close to me, his hand reaching up to my jaw. Running a finger along the angular line, he smirks. I feel my stomach clench and twist violently, just as he pulls himself away.
“Morning,” he grumbles, burying his face into Draco’s chest. His morning wood aches, begging to be touched. He doesn’t want to deal with it though, just wants to hold Draco and go back to sleep in his embrace.
“I know you’re in there, Draco.” A shiver goes up through my body when Potter says my birth name, and I relax considerably. “Come out, its okay,” he tries again, his voice softly spoken. I unlock the door and pull it towards me, standing awkwardly in the small cubicle. His eyes meet mine, and I’m overwhelmed by the sincerity of them. I must look a mess, and I run my fingers through my hair in frustration.
“Is he that bad?” Malfoy asks, eyebrow curving into an arch.
“You too,” Draco agrees, leaning in to kiss him.
“I wanted to go swimming.”
“Let me see,” Draco asks, voice small and detached. He coughs, trying to hide his fear.
“True,” Harry agrees after some consideration. He feels kind of bad for teasing Malfoy about the shit he’s reading, even though it
will pull out in front; he’s been running for years as part of his Auror training and fitness maintenance. He may not be a Muggle Olympian, but he can definitely hold his place.
“Okay,” I breathe in relief. But my relief stops cold, because I remember why I’m down here.
“This seat taken?” Ron Weasley sat down next to Harry and gestured to the bartender. “Can I get a pint of whatever you have on draft?” He turned to look Harry up and down. “You look like hell.”
Harry swallowed loudly but managed to say, “I’d like that very much.” Draco smiled and slowly raised his hand to stroke Harry’s cheek. He moved towards him painfully slow, and Harry closedhis eyes and exhaled, parting his lips in a slight ‘o’ shape. Draco closed the last few inches between them and pressed their lips together.
“And”, he began, ”I think that I’d like to give you a proper kiss, if that’s alright with you.”
Draco looked at him questioningly. “Are what?”
They were both silent for a moment. Harry started to tap his fingers anxiously on the cushions, but he remembered what had happened the last time he had done that near Draco and decided to put his hands in his lap instead.
Harry raised his glass a bit and mutter “Cheers, mate.”
“I’m- er, sorry, I’ll just...” he stuttered. “I’m going to go.”
Harry couldn’t help but smile. “It’s a superstitious tradition. You throw the money in and make a wish, and it’s supposed to come true. I’m not really sure why, though. Maybe because you made some odd kind of offering to the god of water fountains.” Draco pursed his lips and considered this.
Draco’s mouth turned up slightly at the corner, and he simply replied, “Quite.” He turned to look around. “We can side along apparate as long as you don’t try to do it yourself. Otherwise we’ll both end up splinched between here and Merlin knows where.” Draco put one arm around Harry’s waist and the other firmly on his bicep so they were chest to chest, while Harry tried to ignore the butterflies in his stomach.
“I wish that the world will someday see me for the good things I do in the present and will do in the future rather than the bad things I did in my past.” He tossed the coin over his shoulder and opened his eyes.
“‘Like, really really gay’ as you so eloquently put it last night.” Draco smirked at him, and Harry gave him a tentative smile in return. Draco nonchalantly slid his knee closer to Harry’s and looked at him until he finally met his eyes.
Harry rested his elbows on the sticky bar top and groaned again. He fancied Draco Malfoy, and now he wasn’t sure if he’d ever recover.
Harry hadn’t moved from his spot on the couch since he had arrived in his flat 3 hours earlier. He laid on his back with his arm flung over his eyes, his head still pounding from the hangover and his mortifying actions in Draco’s kitchen. His heart sank every time he thought about it. The truth was, even before Harry’s discovery of his more than friendly feelings towards Draco, he’d cherished their relationship. Ron and Hermione were great friends, but they were everything to each other and often were lost in their own bubble, which was something Harry couldn’t and didn’t want to compete with. His relationship with Draco was something Harry had all to himself. It was effortless and easy, and he found himself looking forward to any time they spent together. He knew he’d ruined everything, and he was already grieving the loss of their friendship.
“I would have shared.” Harry replied without thinking. Draco looked away and busied himself in the kitchen.
As soon as he did it, he regretted it and pulled away. He leaped down from the counter and stumbled away towards the living room.
Draco finally broke the silence by saying, “Do you remember Blaise Zabini?”
Harry honestly didn’t drink very often.
There was a soft knock on his door. He groaned. A local football team had been going door to door selling magazines to raise money for some kind of tournament for the past week. He got up and slowly walked to the door. As he opened it he said, “Look guys, I already bought a subscription last week, I’m really not interested in-“. He looked up.
What on Earth was wrong with him, Harry wondered idly. Draco apparently had the uncanny ability to make Harry say whatever was on his mind, both drunk and hungover it seemed. Draco started to hum to himself while he buttered bread, and Harry walked over and sat himself on the counter and allowed himself to really stare.
When Harry first “came out” to his friends, Ron was the first to accept it. He had a conversation with all of their male friends and told them if they ever said anything cross to Harry about it, he’d hex their bollocks off. He was so grateful for Ron’s unwavering loyalty.
Harry pushes his face into Draco’s groin, breathing him in again before pushing his fingers into the legs of his briefs. His fingers touch the smooth skin and Draco’s breath catches. Harry runs his hand along the leg holes, drawing moans and shaky exhales from Draco. He presses his nose into the gap, taking a deep breath.
Draco sighs but nods, a smile appearing on his face. “I guess I could do some shopping too,” he mumbles.
Harry’s heart stops beating for a second, and when it picks back up it thuds loudly.
“Three.”
I open my mouth to try to argue, but she gives me a pointed look. Sighing, I say, “Okay. We are very close.”
“Look at me, Draco. He only did that to appeal to the public. The motive behind the donations was not pure. You help others for the sake of it, not to gain popularity.” Harry takes a breath, shaking his head in exasperation. Like he couldn’t
Potter just laughs again, louder still. “Okay, but at least that was for a good reason.”
Malfoy seems startled by the response. “You have to be afraid of missing
Harry reaches for his button and slips it loose, tugging the zip down the second he can. His underwear doesn't hide anything, and his cock is a bulge clearly visible through the flaps of denim. Without thinking twice, Harry pulls his jeans down, lifting his hips from the couch cushion and sliding them down to the middle of his thighs. His hand seeks out his cock, and he roughly palms it. His hips buck up into his hand and he moans quietly. Harry’s head falls back as he slides his fingers under the elastic.
as he watches Draco breathe in and out.
“True. Very true, Draidan,” Potter says pensively. I can’t help but notice that my name is being repeated a lot. He is clearly testing it out, seeing how his mouth forms around it, how it feels in his mouth. ‘Peter’ feels very similar to ‘Potter’, so I refrain from saying it.
“Without giving you a full history lesson, that’s not what Halloween is to us. Halloween, is about possessing magic and using it in creative and new ways. The only reason we make it scary is because there was a battle that took place on Halloween centuries ago. The ‘bad side’ used Necromancy to raise people from the grave, and created an undead army.” Potter looks gobsmacked, utterly shocked.
Harry shakes his head but steps back. His voice drops lower, but Draco doesn’t pay it any attention. “I was awake for all of it.”
“Wow,” he murmurs, not taking his eyes away from Harry’s.
. That’s no excuse for abusing him in the morning though.
“You cheated!”
He turns the shower on and scalds his skin, rubbing it red and raw. If he can’t allow himself to feel love for Malfoy, he can allow himself to be angry. He decides that’s good enough for now, even if his anger is just a cover-up for despair.
colours! The same identical shade of purple, even, which is quite unusual with most people not being able to tell the difference—”
Potter lets out a pained breath and looks at me like I’ve suddenly grown a second head. “Oh Draco.” he shakes his head and my gut twists. “I want to be friends. I don’t know why I want to be friends with an arrogant bastard, but I do. Okay?” I feel the room go warm and I swallow thickly.
He loves her, he really does, it’s just
