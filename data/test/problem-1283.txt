Daisy nodded. “Yes. Thank your father. He paid for all of these.” She gestured at the neatly folded clothes in front of him.
Draco is completely silent, still shaking. His mouth opens to let out small whimpers in between the trembling of his bottom lip.
Harry helped him pull the sweater over his head and guide his arms through the sleeves. Draco looked down at himself, still half buried in the couch, and ran his hands down his front.
The Healer nodded. "Yes, that's all quite expected. Once your hearing starts to disappear, it will likely begin to be more uncomfortable. The pain will become more noticeable."
It wasn't long after the taste incident that Harry started taking Draco's work home with him for Draco to complete in the comfort of their apartment.
They’re in greenhouse four, so Draco can collect clippings for a potion in his classes the next day. Harry hovers by Draco’s side, not doing anything particularly useful.
Draco let a soft laugh slip out of his mouth, and took the last sip of his lavender tea without replying to Kit.
”So tell me if I’m wrong here,” Draco said, later. His head ached where his eyebrows were furrowed, and his arms had long ago gone numb from directing papers, photographs, and glowing links through the air with his arms.
Draco sat, in the same way and in the same place that he did every morning, and pushed his weight back in his rolling chair. He held his mug of tea close to his chest and smiled. By this point, the pounding had turned into a dull throb, but Draco hardly noticed. He was too busy thinking about Harry, and his earl grey tea, and his plans for the pub this evening, and also Harry. In summary, this day was to be just like every other day. The same walk to work, the same woman at the front desk, the same conversation with Wilson, the same tea, the same thoughts. In fact, it wasn't altogether unusual for Draco to have a headache at this time of the morning either. Although usually the headache had to be instigated by one of the Unspeakable interns, who still hadn't figured out how to keep their mouths shut about just about anything, and were always making problems with the other departments.
"Sure," Harry said. "But that doesn't mean we have to get wildly drunk and make love over our kitchen table."
Draco pushed Harry's shoulder, not hard enough to make him wobble, and turned bright red. "Just hold the baby when they come back with her."
Harry made spaghetti, Draco's favorite, and wobbled both plates between his hands as he took them back to the couch, where Draco still lay. Draco would've gotten up and helped make the garlic bread, but he honestly hadn't had the energy to get off the couch, and Harry had insisted that they could live without garlic bread for one night.
Just then, Harry’s head lifted from where it had been downturned over a bed of struggling daffodils. Draco threw himself back into his rooms, nearly ripping the curtains off the rod in the process. He tumbled over the lip that marked the entrance to the balcony and fell face first onto the polished floors. Draco groaned, and hoped desperately that Harry wasn’t aware of what had just occurred.
"Do you think," Harry said, after they were both dressed and tucked into bed, "that Robards will let me quit the Aurors?"
Scorpius sighed and dug his fingernails into the dirt. Draco ran a hand lightly over the top of his head, letting his white blonde curls skim back with the movement and the slight breeze.
“Because she’s the exact same with me,” Draco sighs. “Always playing with that bloody hair of hers.”
Their fight from the bathtub was forgotten. All the same, Draco could not forget that the last words he'd heard from Harry had been ones of lost disappointment.
They didn't mention how ugly he'd been to Harry in school. How that had been part of Draco's truth too, before the very end of the war. They didn't mention the things Harry had done in return. They'd already talked about all of it, years before; it didn't need to be said.
But not now, not like this. Not when Draco’s hands are on him, all over him. Then he talks without letting out a breath, filling up the spaces Draco has left empty.
“You’re completely oblivious to it,” Draco is saying to Harry. “He has an excellent aptitude for Potions. He’s very talented, really.”
It's a howling mistake bringing Draco Malfoy instead of Bill Weasley to get locked up in Dudley Dursley's house. Despite Bill's helping hand Kingsley has pulled Draco out of his holiday in France to make things worse.
He nods gasping wrapping his cold shivering fingers around his iron wrists his eyes still closed breathing him in.
It was black and white seven long years back before Potter kissed Draco. Before Draco kissed him back. And then gradually colours invaded life bit by bit. How pathetically he tried to paint it all black and white over what was happening between them. How pathetically he tried to think that he was just having sex, he was fucking Potter, being fucked by him.
They spent the whole glamorous morning in the magestic living room now gleaming thanks to Kreacher's renovation and cleaning, in silence listening to each other's breathing or Kreacher's working.
Malfoy stood up and turned taking in a large gulp of smoke. He was extremely cool and maintained his calm and Harry knew he just wanted to provoke him.
'Come!  kneel down on the sofa and bend.' he ordered which Harry found quite seducing and hot.  'You have lube.?'
'Look! Look at the sunrise! It's remarkably colourfu. See the mountain peaks are gleaming in red and orange. You idiot look at it!' he tried to show him the rich magnificient Amazon sunrise but Draco would stare at Potter transfixed.
'Why don't you come live with us for a few days?' She invited softly looking at the clothes he was wearing since yesterday evening.
'Because I knew the magic wouldn't allow it. Besides, I told you to go!' he stares at him intently with a sparkling glee. 'Why didn't you?'
'I don't know. He goes here and there!' Facing him directly Harry leans against an armchair with his arms crossed eyeing his recovered details along with his usual details; which are, neat clothing, the black blazer with a mat sheen over the vicuna pullover and black shoes shining. Hair silky silver blond, combed and tied to a very neat pony tail.
'I couldn't. I was devastated. I was angry. I looked for him everywhere in the castle. Then...,' he paused for a while and smiled. '...She happened. Luna. She said....,' He reached out for his wand and cleaned his hands and cupped Draco's head and kissed his hair, forehead and cheeks.
'And then you said that you never could move on. That there was no such thing. You said that you would just change. You would rebuild yourself from the broken pieces and you would reform.' Draco did not smile. He finished eating the sandwich peacefully and cleaned himself with a simple cleaning spell.
'I don't know... I don't care.... When you are next to me I'm complete. And I love you... That's all... Just leave me alone.' he shoved Harry off.
Several times he looked at Harry and quickly looked away. When the class was taking notes Harry was sure he stole long moments to stare at him.
'Oh for fuck's sake Potter!' he cast a revealing spell to reveal the password and gaped thunderstruck. He sat on the chair and waited for awhile. Then he stared into the emptiness. Finally he sighed and read again the word 'Dragon' and a latitude longitude coordinates. He found the location and simply stared at the result.
Switched off the alarm and thought. He inhaled the light lavender air freshener lying still in his black and white sheets. He was strangely happy with a soft warmth in the core of his heart. Everything was colourful in him. It was not that bad but it felt exhotic.
He caught Harry's green gaze and blinked twice. Harry watched how beautifully his pupils dilated and his skin flushed and his pretty lips parted. Harry dropped his bag and caught his face in his hands and kissed him forcefully. He didn't object. On the other hand he wrapped his hands around Harry's body and pulled him towards him kissing him back.
He avoided Harry's gaze and sat on his bed. His eyes were red and swollen. He was dressed carelessly and barefoot.
Later in the morning he knocked on the door of Dudley's room when Harry was getting dressed, entered before he had answered with two mugs of steaming coffee. Harry, who was half naked blatantly looked up for the unspeakable astonishment but in he cooly swaggered.
One Saturday morning while having breakfat as usual Malfoy read the newspapre aloud while Harry made waffles.
Potter smiled, pulled him up and kissed his cheek. He kissed his body, legs and slowly his inner thighs. Draco arched his body inviting him.
But he doesn't leave, looks all around including the ceiling and tapestries and gaudy curtains Kreacher would not let Harry change.
He was feeling cold. So cold and hungry. He hadn't eaten anything since yesterday afternoon. Pansy Parkinson had dragged him by force to  her place in the morning and he had to eat whatever she had given him. She invited him to stay for awhile but he came home. Draco wanted to stay at home. Potter's home. His home.
She had asked him to be there to represent family. Harry knew she didn't like Ron, and Goerge doens't even watch Quidditch anymore and Bill was out of the country on work. Harry knew he had no option.
Day 3 was the beginning of frustration. Having scanned the whole house for a way out Harry realised that he was actually trapped in the very house full of grim memories with a man who is obnoxiously full of himself.
'This is not a curse. It's the protective charm you had around this house when you were small' He leaves the book lay open, walks towards where Harry is seated. 'It got tampered I think.' He leans against a massive glass cabinet eyeing him mildly. Enjoys his frustrated stance, the smoke coming out of his mouth and nose, eyes closed head turned up. 'It's smart magic Potter. It upgrades and thinks it's guarding you though it is actually imprisoning you.'
And Draco loved whatever was happening between them. He loved fucking Potter. He loved his rough battle scarred hands all over his body. He loved Harry's tight abs, hard muscles and strong biceps. The auror trainig and fighting the Dark Lord had made him a hard rough man. But he was a Rescue Auror. He saved lives. He risked his life to save others. He was smooth from inside. Draco just wanted to give him everything he had, do everything he could to please him. He really wanted to stay next to him and hold him till he fell asleep but Draco knew better not to.
'I need a favour!' he gives the shirt back with a mild expression, shows no reluctancy watching him putting the shirt on, fabric touching his skin and then the  fingers working on buttons. 'Can you call your elf?'
From that moment onwards what he felt was beyond even his understanding. Every bit of his body was on fire. His flesh and bones were melting. It was as though every pain in the whole world was concentrated to one spot and placed upon his chest cutting it open. He wanted to scream to the whole universe in spiteful scorching agony on his chest riping the skin open revealing his own bleeding heart.
'I won't let the healers mess with my son. Besides they know nothing about these,' she conjured a bed and placed him in it and took him out of the entrance to disapparate. Harry helped her and went back to Kingsley, excused him and fetched Malfoy's tool kit and apparated at Malfoy Manor.
Harry sat and Hermione hugged him holding him tight Harry spent a few more minutes holding her listening to Ron and Malfoy yelling.
He remebered one by one the events of the day, and dragging and tedious that he wanted to drift in to nothingness and never come back. Draco counted the five cigarettes in the ashtray. Drank some water and sat back on the floor of his room in Malfoy Manor.
Draco knew that he was gaping because Potter pulled him in to a very intimate deep kiss that he yielded wrapping his arms around his body and clinging to him.
He sat back and waited. Allowed Harry run his hand down his spine, kiss his hair, massage his shoulders. Harry felt Malfoy was slowly yielding to him. He naturally leaned against Harry's body and relaxed between his legs. Harry wrapped his arms around him and stroked his chest embracing him, kissing his hair more.
'I said stop calling them that.' Harry stepped towards him slowly with his wand pointing at his heart but Malfoy didn't move.
Draco walked toward him and sat at the foot of his chair and held his hands. 'I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.'
He pulled one knee towards him and rested an elbow on it running his fingers through his hair. He didn't know if he should have prevented it or could have prevented it. All in all he dragged Potter in to this. He could have just come home. But he loved everything about it. every detail, every second of it. He loved everything about him.
Harry shook him desperately, hugging and kissing him. 'Baby please don't do this! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!' He shook him hard, and felt his heart horrified. His heart was beating and he was breathing but he didn't wake up.
Draco entered his living room, threw his cloak on the sofa, closed the door and sat on the floor leaning agaist a wall.
Harry ignored again. If the man hated Harry that much probably he'd better leave. He didn't want to dive head long in to an unnecessary brawl with him but for some ridiculous undying reason he couldn't leave. He yearned to stay. He craved that moment. There. Right there. He knew this was exactly what happened in the boys' bathroom six years back but still he couldn't make up his mind to walk away. It was as though he was very much cursed to thrash himself again and again against this man.
Draco felt the warmth. The beating heart he loved to feel all his life. He's on fire. He's on fire with his weeping cracked bleeding heart beneath him. Draco nodded. 'I know...!' he whispered. He buried his face in Harry's chest and sank in to his knees hugging his body.
Harry apparated on Kingsley's instructions with a new portkey at a vast unfamiliar territory deep in Amazon, surrounded by gigantic mountains and rocks. It was three o'clock in the afternoon there. Bright and sunny and covered in lush green. A group of four wizards and three witches were waiting deep in conversation while one of them was watching the beautiful mountain range beyond something Harry could not see.
After a stormy argument or yelling at each other over a good for nothing issue Draco would come to sleep on the sofa and Potter never slept alone in their bed for the past seven years.
Harry was dreaming of going home. He finished his work around nine o'clock and was dreaming of spending the rest of the night in peace. Watch some TV or read the sports page or just relax with a mug of cappuccino made from the fancy muggle cappuccino machine he had bought recenty. He loved his new apartment in Edinburgh. He was planning, to spend a perfect relaxing weekend and, on going to visit Edinburgh castle on Saturday if Kingsley didn't send an urgent owl asking him to report to work.
Harry had to tell him where his heart is. Where his heart sleeps at night. To whom his heart makes love. He coldn't walk down the aisle without telling him everything. Without letting him know how much... and for how long.
'You are pretty! Stop worrying!' Potter would lalways augh at the very many products he had on the dressing table.
For a few seconds Harry, Ron and Malfoy relaxed in total silence while Hermione continued to sob softly holding Harry.
Draco took his hungry invitation wholehearted, embracing it, hanging by that very moment, falling even more in love with him, just before his wedding day.
'Fine!' Harry threw away his wand and stepped towards him. Malfoy simply loved it. He waited with an evil mirth on his pale grey eyes now on fire by the evening sunlight and still he wouldn't stop taunting Harry.
And he woke up smoothly, switched off the alarm, set the bed, had a bath, cleaned his clothes, prepared himself a coffee and set to work in his black and white life.
Malfoy opened it slowly. He was not bothered like Ron or Neville. He was calm. and the howler did not yell either. It said in Narcissa Malfoy's sharp quiet cold voice, 'DO NOT ACCEPT!'
'We can't apparate. You, I and Weasley need blood replenishment. Tell Granger to go fetch mother. She'll do it.
Harry turned to look at his face asking for a kiss. He gave it. He didn't have to say anything. Harry knew he sickly loved him and it was a fatal sickness in his blood.
Potter didn't answer. He slowly pushed Draco in to bed throwing his towel away. Draco tried to push him away but he pulled Draco and locked him in his arms. He held him till he calmed down.
Malfoy stared, his gaze getting hard too. He stood up and took a step towards Harry and his usual nasty sneer apeared on his angry pale face. 'Because you don't have any reason.'
When he entered the living room Father looked up from his book and beamed happpily. Draco walked towards him and stroked his hair and kissed his forehead.
He smiled sweetly. Harry observed the smile. It was soft and genuine. But he didn't thank him. He poured Harry a drink from a bottle he got from the cupboard and examined the files. He signed an already written parchment and gave it to Harry.
He removed his tailored cloak, shirt and trousers revealing his flawless body and got dressed in a set of thin leather jacket and a pair of jeans which gave him a look of a muggle biker. Then he covered his hair with a leather cap. First he walked around the object as though studying it fiddling with his enchanted 'hammer like tool' among his fingers. Then he pulled a chair closer, sat and worked. His usual sneer and proud gaze vanished when he concentrated. He frowned and bit his lip time to time and grimaced. Then he did his naughty sneer when the curse was broken. Harry had leaned against the wall and admired him the whole time.
'Goerge should have a cream or something for that or...' he stopped pushing his hair back to kiss his forhead.
Harry beamed, 'I guess I should leave now?' and accepted the parchment brushing his soft fingers with his. He swallowed and thought for a moment stuffing his hands in his pockets. A moment was enough to change your whole rhythm. Your whole life. He took that moment. And in the next moment he pulled Harry and kissed him.
He came in him jerking hard holding one of Potter's strong arms for support. Then Potter came seconds later in Draco's hand.  Both of them were exhausted. Draco cleaned them and fell on to his body. He felt Potter's fingers in his hair his hands running up and down his body, his mouth is kissing his forehead and settling him between his legs. They fell a sleep.
Draco didn't protest. He led him to his bedroom. Soon they were naked and more kissing and more groping.
He sat on the flat stone where he had sat and smoked when Potter barged into his life, and watched the missed sunrise.
Neiher the researcheres nor Kingsley seemed to mind that the teamleader had stayed back as though it was quite normal.
'You've got to stop this sick habbit. You know every once in a while I get a trying job but that doesn't mean you have to kill yourself like this.'
He didn't apparate after he left Draco. He walked down the emply, lonely road with his broken heart. He was holding his cloak in one hand letting the frozen air beat his skin. Knowing nothing was going to change the fact that thereafter, he, a married man, a family man, a father, the man who defeated the Dark Lord had already left his soul at that one room in Malfoy Manor, he walked home with his broken heart. He knew he has left his all by his side and brought a huge part of Draco with him. He was everywhere. Harry felt his kiss, his touch, his smell, the sound of his beating heart all over him. And he knew this will live with him. It will be there like an invisible member in the house. Every single moment. And it will be until their hearts stop beating. One day. And even after that.
'OK!' Harry pulls out his wand and without a warning locks the doors and casts a sealing charm around them.
'You performed dark magic out of a Malfoy Grimoir. I have to talk to Kingsley and Mrs Weasley. Ms Granger I consider you as Mrs Weasley's responsibility too, so please remain here all of you till I come.'
Two days later when Harry saw him in the ministry he ignored him as usual. He had come to see Kingsley. Yet at the end of the day just before leaving they caught each other's gaze. They spent a few seconds trapped in it. And then Malfoy walked away towards the deserted staircase avoiding the elevator and Harry followed him.
It was not once or twice he wanted to corner him and tell him to be careful, to avoid risky curses. But Harry was more afraid to influence him, interfere his personal judgement and ruin what they were having. He didn't want to lose him. The bottom line was he thought he didn't have any right.
Day 2 was threateningly silent for Harry. They worked every spell detecting the magic and the source of it. Kingsley and Arthur Weasley sent a patronus. Hermione sent an owl asking complicated questions and giving even intricate instructions which he read and gaped at Harry dumbfounded. Then he hogged the floo to talk to Lucius Malfoy for half an hour.
Draco didn't need anything else. He wanted to shut down all the doors and protect this moment in his black and white bedroom. He felt Potter was falling asleep totally forgotten his duty. He didn't want to wake him up. He didn't want him to leave.
'Why is it necessary?' Harry's voice sounds uneasy enough to stir the calm, and he doesn't want to hide the reproach.
He was fine with his lonely evenings and quiet weekends. He would meet Ron and Hermione or the Weasleys but this haze of freedom and lonesome was fine too.
Draco obeyed. He felf his mouth on the back of his neck kissing, breathing him in, sucking. That mouth slowly went down the length of his body. He stoppped at the buttocks and kissed them. Kissed each buttock properly, cupped them, slowly parted them and kissed so intently in between. Licked and kissed deep and smooth longer than usual and Draco felt his rough fingers trembling slightly between his buttocks and his lips wet and quivering. Yet eventually his usual tantalizing rough approach came. Draco gasped breathlessly. They made love silently. He came in Draco once. He sucked Draco in an intolarable thirst. They went back to the bath and stroked each other kissing painfully. Draco threw him against the wall and shagged long and deep and then sucked him till he was breathless. They came back into the room. Dried themselves, kissed wildly and stroked again and again. They had never reached that many orgasms in one day. They fell asleep in each other's arms.
They waited without a word for a few minutes. Malfoy went away into the house and brought some books and gave them to Hermione.
Malfoy was totally distracted. He knew he could not concentrate on his work. He looked at Harry nervously.
Narcissa looked at him sharply. She observed him quietly. Then she turned to a page of the grimoir and gave it to him.
He kissed him. He pinned Draco to bed and kissed him intently. Draco felt his warm mouth kissing all over him, soft but a little aggressive.
On the other hand the world needed a hero. Draco's hero. Draco didn't want to share his Potter. Then again...
But Harry wanted to warn him. He simply wanted to stop him but the words have left him maliciously. Dark objects are toys to Malfoy. What if Harry was just worrying for nothing? It will clearly offend him trying to tell him off his work.
'Drey, come here please!' Harry pulled him for a very intent kiss and kissed him with every energy he had remaining in his body.
'The ministry received an Egyptian chest a fisherman had found and is suspected to be a serious dark object belonged to the Pharaohs and.... ,'
There were millions of things to tell him. But he couldn't. Draco didn't know if he could love him enough. He didn't know if he had given him enough. He had always wanted to love him more and more. In every possible way he could. He wanted Potter to know that. He wanted him to know how unbearably he loved him.
Harry leaned against the closed door burying his face in his hands embracing every word he had said. Now his scar didn't hurt but his heart ached and he knew it was already cracked and bleeding inwardly and he was soaked in his own blood. He ached to tell him that it was him, it had always been him, him more than anything. He rubbed his chest breathing heavily. He had lived his life a motherless, loveless, ill-treated, yet he gave his everything to this cruel world. He died for this world. He masterd death. But he couldn't master love.
Throughout the session Harry did not grasp anything. He simply watched him. He knew he had to concentrate but his movement, his clear speech, gesture and even the frown mesmerised Harry. So he made a mental note to find a document or something on the subject later or ask for the notes from a "Hermionish" auror.
Harry kissed that rosy mouth againg breathlessly. He felt his hot wet mouth opening wide letting him in. He felt Malfoy's whole body relaxing under him accepting his kiss. He kissed slow and deep. He kissed properly, taking time, sucking one lip and the other lip and both lips together and found his way in to his wet tasty mouth again, met with his wet tongue, embracing sucking, playing, dancing, grunting softly for sheer delight and finally let his hands go and pulled away to breathe.
He takes three more intakes of smoke watches how the smoke swirls around his head like sinful haloes and drifts into thin air as nothing happened.
Despite a mild scar on the forehead he appears quite well and radiant after staying at home a mother's boy. He acts his usual Malfoyish snobbish manner eager for the document refusing any refreshment stating his eagerness to leave.
He went to Peru the next day to see the missed sunrise. He disapparated around twelve o' clock and it was the beautiful, colourful, enchanting Amazon sunrise in Peru. He sat where he had kissed him above the dead city of the dead civilization, where death was everywhere, loss was everywhere but smeared with pouring grace and enticement.
'That's interesting!' his glee is incomprehensible but what's more incomprehensible to Harry is Draco's attentiveness to learn the mechanism of the cappuccino machine.
They kissed, Malfoy on top of Harry grinding their hard cocks agaisnt each other, stroking and sucking, they flipped, kissed more, more skin, more sucking, and more stroking, they came in each other's hands gasping for air tightly wrapped in each other. They didn't bother to clean and stayed with wet all over them.
'Somebody barges into life if I don't go to work and drags me somewhere to feed me or these people send me food.' he pointed at the neighbourhood. 'I'm going to put on,' he poked his belly with his forefinger.
However it takes nearly three days for him to fully recover and visits Harry at No 12, Grimmauld place, London to obtain Dudley's letter of approval to study the No5, Privet Drive, Surrey.
But he still couldn't stand the howling quietness inside the house at night. He thought the house was screaming or crying of unending agony. He preferred staying outside.
'I mean you had a duty. You are duty oriented braveheart. The whole wizarding world was depending on you. You were their only hope. You could always choose them over me? That was the rational decision you had to make. Save the people. I was enemy. So why me?' he demanded.
He breathed hard, wiped his eyes and looked aside. He was sleeping soundly, facing the other side of the room with his hand under his head. Hie skin was glowing in the golden light in Harry's bedroom and Harry could see the love bite on his back which he had given him the previous night.
Draco always woke up before him so he usually had had a few minutes to watch him sleep in his peace and he was so thankful to life for this lovely moment, to wake up by this brave man's side. He could play with his very untidy hair, kiss his scar, play with his calloused limp fingers for a while before waking him up. He always kissed his mouth touching his body and his cock beneath the sheets until he woke up.
'You think I wanted to let it happen. I don't give a flying fuck of your sick life but he was anyway going to die for you.' Ron yelled back.
He watched Malfoy getting ready quietly. He didn't mind if Malfoy stayed the night because this silence and whatever they were having between them did not make him feel bad or awkward. It felt so raw and real to Harry. He had never felt this way. Never. Harry didn't have to pretend, to be nice or gentle. He didn't have to bother about, how Malfoy would feel or his judgment or any of such bullshit. He just let him have him his way and totally absorbed the joy.
Harry wanted to reach out and stroke his beautiful blond mess but he bit back the desire. He was not sleepy and wanted to say something. Say something nice. Ask something. Or just hold him close. But he held back. Perhaps another time.
'Told you not to stay up at night you crazy arse, come here!' he pulled him into his arms to check on that, one lovely day when he was sulking infront of the mirror about the lack of beauty sleep.
'Don't!' he snapped quietly. 'Just don't....!' he looked up at Harry with his swollen eyes and blinked, 'I've always wanted....,' he stopped. Shook his head and looked away. Then he looked back and uttered quietly, 'I've felt everything for you.... and it's wasted...!'
Malfoy was standing with his usual frown on the face with one hand in his pocket and the other hand clutching his tailored cloak. He had not bothered to button the top most buttons of his pure white slim fit designer shirt after Harry had unbuttoned it. He looked clearly very attractive and a little messy. But George ignored. Harry knew George too well not to be fooled by his mock ignorance. But George didn't mind and seemed very happy to see Draco.
Both Ron and Harry heard him say it but gaped at each other for he had said it with much admiration and Hermione chortled to which Ron made a sick face. Harry chuckled.
But the next minute he stood up and started getting ready quickly. Harry wore his pants and escorted him towards the door. He left without a word.
Then Harry started dreaming. The horrendous dream that made him shiver in fear. The dream that did not let him sleep.
The wound healed. Malfoy woke up, looked around and stood up. He reached Harry in a start. Harry tried to smile but he knew he could not. He was shaking uncontrollably and Hermione was weeping hysterically. Harry could see Malfoy going so red in crisp anger that he gritted his teeth and snatched the grimoir. He grabbed Hermione's wand and chanted a complicated spell placing the wand on Harry's Heart. Harry could feel the pain ease but he was still shaking and the vision getting blurred. He felt his heart was getting slow and realised that he was dying. Slowly and softly.
They came home and spent hours sitting on the living room floor holding and embracing each other in silence. In that spacious house, they spent the whole afternood cuddled in each other on the living room floor.
The result of the screen absorbed the remaining bit of sense out of his floating life.  He just spent long moments transfixed galring at the beautiful mountains of untouched Amazon and Peru. Where he kissed Draco for the fisrt time. Where they desperately breathlessly kissed each other. Where everything started.
He gasps in terror. 'It's alright. I don't want the house. Your boyfriend can have it to work on the curse.'
He wouldn't answer. They would just make out which would turn into violent sex and would not discuss anything at all. Even if Harry was worn to the bone they would still make out and have sex.
He hugged his knees and cried while the rain poured down on him. His everything ached and throbbed with pain and he felt exhausted. He curled on the earth and passed out under hammering rain.
It was amazing that sweet vanilla sensation of his smooth fingers working graciously on his cock and his hot breath on his neck. He enjoyed his lips, tongue, kissing and his teeth biting into the skin and again kiss sucking hard. Harry gasped in pain but strained his neck giving him more to kiss. He kissed more moving up and down the side of his neck, neckline face and forehead while his hand moved wonderfully.
Then he pulled out many things out of his pockets such as clothes enchanted torches, sweets, shoes, socks, books and cigarettes as if he has come for a holiday.
He coughed, looked here and there. He was thirsty. He felt  cold. His head ached. He ran his fingers in his hair and felt the short silky flop that the styling charm he had cast was wearing off.
'Granger, I don't think Potter will ever stop his shit habbit of blind decision making and he will always risk his life with or without me. Please read these grimoirs but don't let anyone know you have these and be kind enough to return them in one piece.'
He had a bath. Looked in the mirror. His dark circles had vanished. He looked good. Hair grown. No styling charm on. He used all his hair care, skin care products, shaving lotion, cologne, perfume, everything. And got ready.
His pale face flushed, his gaze hardened but he mastered it so well that Harry really envied his control. He smiled a little, stepped closer towards Harry that they could even feel each other's heat, hear each other breathing in the tropical quietness.
He literally lived in Grimmauled place and slept in Harry's bed. Some weekends and some days if Harry had to go out on field duty he spent the day at Malfoy Manor. Narcissa Malfoy was not concerned the slightest about him sleeping at the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black" at all. She sometimes sent a box of sweets including a generous amount of treacle tart.
He watches the third smoke ring ripples up, touches it with his forefinger and taps it.  Watching the disturbed smoke ring making designs in the moonlit darkness he drags in the next intake and fills his lungs. His head tilts back in bliss rests against the wall tapping the cigarette with the tip of his finer shedding ash.
The sky was bright blue. The sun was blazing over the mountain peaks but it was raining. The tropical rain was hammering on every green and rocky mountain, on the dead city. On him.
He ignored the staff at the ministry, made the conversation very short and sweet with anyone who reached him and straightaway went to see Kingsley. Kingsley went through the report and invited him to sit.
But they wouldn't say something, anything. They simply gave everything each other wanted. And even after these steamy violent love making, Malfoy didn't cuddle. Harry didn't bother him either. They would just sleep side by side.
They woke up on the quiet Sunday morning, had a bath together. Harry wanted him in and Malfoy pinned him against the bathroom wall gleefully. They had sex in the bath. Pushing Harry to the marble wall Malfoy fucked him. Harry turned and found his hot mouth time to time and his warm hand on Harry's cock, with water running down them, moaning and grunting in sheer pleasure and pain they had each other. They sucked each other, stroked each other until they were dry. Both of them had never came that much in one day ever before. Their bodies sore and could barely walk. They lay naked side by side in the bed awhile.
Kingsley wanted to give him a project in Egypt but he flatly refused saying he had to spend a few days at home.
Magic wakes up, screams in agony the force trying to part them. He gasps in pain wraps his legs around Harry holding on, clinging, against the force, shaking violently.
Potter always cooked. Draco loved his cooking. Mostly breakfast. But today Draco wasn't hungry. He had to finish the report before 8 o' clock in the morning and hand it over to Kingsley. He used to hate to go to the ministry a week back but now he had trained himself just to ignore them and act normal.
” Harry practically demands. Draco doesn’t do it, won’t do it, won’t go back to this world. He’s found safer, better worlds, like a Muggle grocery store, a hollow tree, a beaver dam, and a house shaped like a fungal growth. Like this well. Like Harry, and his stupid glasses and stupid eyes. He doesn’t want this wand, which has cast Crucio on eleven-year-olds. But then Harry puts his hands over Draco’s, and says
us. You clearly haven’t changed all the ways you said you would, because you still show it in a really weird fucking way.”
So at the end of the night, Harry doesn’t notice that Draco has politely seen his guests to the door, kissing Pansy’s hand in goodbye, reaching up to ruffle Blaise’s hair, waving to Ginny leaving on a broom, promising Luna he’d sign her petition. He exchanges one last “The worlds revolve like ancient women, gathering fuel in vacant lots” with Ron (“You forgot to say ‘Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh’! That’s the best line!”), and bids an uncharacteristically stiff farewell to Hermione. Harry doesn’t notice that he’s the last one left, because he’s occupied by how Draco’s hair looks, whipped into a feathery mess by the wind through the open door. Occupied by complexities, loving the interactions that live within a kaleidoscope, turns and change and familiar strangeness.
Draco snorted. "Come on, he talks about us, but he's been obsessed with her since we were eleven.  We all saw that one coming from the start."
Draco thought about the ones he had shagged.  No one could be Potter, but Draco picked them with dark hair and light eyes and they all had something that reminded him of Potter.  Not that there had been many with his work.  "Touché.  That doesn't make it better. Neither of us seems to know how to do a relationship."  Circe's tits, why was he arguing when this was exactly what he'd been dreaming for years?  Oh right, because he knew how fucked up this would be. "And there are always explosions when we're around each other."
"We haven't come out, because we don't want the publicity," Potter continued, "and with all the history with us, we haven't told our friends.  Ready?"
"You're dating Malfoy!"  Ginny Weasley was the first one to point out the obvious, although Draco had mentally thought that it'd be Potter's sidekick.  "Ron, why aren't you saying anything?"  And apparently she agreed with Draco.
"I see."  When they stepped inside, Potter put a hand over his mouth, indicating to be quiet, until they walked upstairs into a drawing room. The room looked old, but Draco was drawn to the large tapestry.  "The décor is circa 1978, isn't it? Dreadful, Potter.  I don't know how you can live here."
"I'm sure you already knew about the fundraiser, given your connections.  I look forward to officially meeting your boyfriend," he said.
Draco snorted.  "No, you old man can wait until the morning." He sighed. "You still haven't answered."  At the frown, he rolled his eyes. "Do you think you wanna marry me?"
"Hopefully shagging," he said.  He put his glass on the coffee table, before reaching for Draco's and putting it away as well.  Potter stood up and offered Draco a hand. "Let me show you my bedroom."
"How did you even dance when you're so hard?" Harry asked, as his hand moved down to Draco's balls, roughly playing with them.
, if he said so himself, which he did. Often. Loudly.  Not that anyone could argue with him, since he was
"Good."  Draco had been embarrassed when they had first started, spelling the marks of their lovemaking away, then he tried to hide them with clothes, but now, he wore them proudly.  He belonged to Harry and he couldn't care less if it was front news on the Daily Prophet.
"When you decide that you want to shag someone other than Hermione, then you can pick a man," Potter answered.
"I won't be so careful with you." Harry crushed their lips together so hard that Draco put a hand on Harry's shoulder to balance himself.  "Mmm, did I say that you could touch me yet?  I'll have to punish you for that."  Draco groaned, from anticipation as much as anything. "Bend down, hands on the bed."
This was more than he had hoped for, despite having asked.  "Of course, anything you want.  I'll take the oath right now and I'll make sure to tell him."
Potter pushed the spectacles up his nose while pinching the bridge of his nose.  "Malfoy, if you don't tell me what's going on, I'm going home."
"I think we both deserve firewhiskey after tonight."  Draco sat on the couch and was surprised when Potter sat right next to him and gave him a glass of liquor.  "Thank you.  So… I guess we'll need to figure out how to break up, before you're forced to bring me to more parties."
"This isn't easy," he started.  "There's really no good way to say this, but I'm in a bit of a pickle."
"Before you go up and sing, another round," Ron said.  "To my beautiful and talented wife, for finally getting the Winzegamot to approve same-sex marriages, and to Draco, who's not as beautiful and talented-"
"You sound… better. In school, it was about doing what was right, what Dumbledore wanted, now, you sound like you know what you want and won't let anyone get in the way."  Draco rested his untouched glass on his thigh and turned his head to look at Potter.  "Pretending isn't you, though.  It hurts you. I could feel it in your body.  I don't want to be why you're hurting, not after all this time.  As I said, I'll take-"
"Oh, he's dating Harry Potter," Pansy said with a polite smile, watching Healer-in-Charge Macmillian pale at her words.  "You know how private Potter is.  It's why Draco didn't want to say anything.  I hope you understand the need for discretion."
The party was held in a tent right outside the house.  It was a smart decision, because after one look at the house, Draco feared that it might come down at any time.  Once they stepped inside the tent, silence fell around them.
"Because you've been here for years, three for studies, another three of specialisation, and two just dicking around.  You are twenty-six years-old and you're still not able to get your specialisation, they are giving you the worst shifts as if you were still doing your basic course and all because they all think that you can't be trusted," Pansy said.  "Well now you'll be trusted.  Besides, Potter is notoriously private with his dates.  No one knows anything about his sex life since he split with the Weasley girl, and
"I'll take the credit when it goes right," Potter answered, before kissing Draco again and Draco knew that he had lost, because he couldn't say 'no' to Potter, and while he didn't know if this relationship could go anywhere, he'd enjoy the ride.  And the kissing.
Potter snorted. "And I would bring him to the house with screaming portraits and house-elves?  No, I don't have one, at least not one serious enough that I'd tell him about magic."
was four years ago.  This will work out perfectly; you'll see," she said with a grin.  “Now, can we go and have lunch? I’m hungry."
"I wasn't lying.  Hermione and I have been waiting for this.  You've always been obsessed and so was he.  It was inevitable.  He's not my first choice, but Hermione pointed out that I don't get to pick your boyfriend, which is a shame, because I have much better taste than you do in men," Weasley said with a grin.
"That's because your family and friends still worry about appearances and what's best," Weasley said.  "If we did, we'd have kicked you out already, but if you are Harry's choice, then you have our support.  Harry knows that we'll support him no matter what."
"You came back for your check up a month later."  Draco remembered, because he had made sure to be around and see what the other healers were doing.  He remembered how furious he had been that he hadn't been able to have any real responsibilities, but since it was Potter, they wouldn't let him near the man other than to check his temperature and fix minor things.  "That's when we started talking, and then we had coffee a few times.  We both have terribly busy schedules so it was hard at first and then we got used to working around our schedules and the secrecy."
"And he'd be so wrong," Potter said with a sarcasm that Draco didn't recognize from their school days, reminding him that they had both grown up.  "Fine, I'll go along, but I have two conditions.  Both you and Macmillian have to take oaths.  I don't want either one to rat me out. And, two, you come to a party with me after the gala."
"What do you say, Harry? Do you think you wanna marry me?" he asked as silence descended around the bar, everyone waiting for the answer.
Draco took the time to look around.  He'd been here, right after the Battle of Hogwarts, dragged in before going to the cells on the tenth floor.  Not much had changed.  The same magical sky, the same cubicles, the same old desks, but the people were different, much younger and without the anger that had washed over him in those days.  He was still looking at the different Aurors when Potter spoke up. "I'm done.  We can go."
“Well, Potter, Draco told me I was to prevent you from befriending me at all costs. Not that I wanted your friendship-” Pansy sneers the word, “-in the first place. But this is getting interesting.” Pansy rises, and extends a hand.
Tom scampers self-importantly back to his parents, who are now wearing identical expressions of panicked fury.
A few moments later, a cat stalks by, licks half-heartedly at the canned fish, and continues on. As all things eventually do, one way or another.
Of course, why does it matter that Harry literally can no longer experience emotion, not in any human sense of the word? Or that they’re both dead? Draco’s ability to annoy Harry is clearly just a universal constant.
“I’m not a bad person,” Draco says, and the lie sounds false even to his ears, but Tom’s eyes widen, and he gasps.
Draco murmurs again, and feels the power flow through him, something so small he wouldn’t even have noticed before, but now it feels like a torrent, like everything he shouldn’t be and yet still is, like a distant circle of light above him rushing towards him. Like freedom, open air, clinging to a broom and mocking the boy across from him. He opens his eyes, and sees Harry Potter, and for a second he sees him as a second-year in Gryffindor Seeker robes, sneering back at him. But Harry is not Potter, and Draco is not Malfoy.
“Draco, we both know you can’t do that.” Another reminder of the chains around his shoulders. But Potter continues, “Do you know how many people I’ve met who deserve their lives less than you? So many people suddenly switched to Muggle-loving upstanding citizens the second I killed Voldemort. At least you’ve never been a fucking two-timer. And at
Draco waves the application in Harry’s face, and on a sudden impulse, the kind that stems from human agency and self-indulgence, hugs Harry, almost dropping the papers.
“Yes, of course.” Pansy smiles at her, and slips an arm around Luna’s shoulders, Luna melting like butter into the touch. Harry begins to feel very much like an intruder.
“Oh, Harry, that reminds me. I’ve been wanting to show you this research on the rafters. Did you know they’re all made of magical ash trees from a particular forest? Each tree can only produce one plank, because of their irregularly shaped trunks, but the wood is highly prized. They’ve almost been logged to extinction.”
Beater?” “Well, yes, Gurt isn’t the best they’ve ever had, but they actually used an actual Quidditch strategy last game! There’s hope!”) until Luna manages to sidetrack all three of them into a discussion about the relative merits of dragon blood and oven cleaner.
Harry drops his cards on the grass trying to play Opt, but it’s worth it to hear the sounds of Draco laughing at him, warm and soft.
“It’s quite alright.” Draco stares at his glass, then looks up and smiles sweetly at Harry. Harry’s breath catches.
“I accept,” Harry growls reluctantly, and the line relaxes. Malfoy smiles happily at him, and Harry is suddenly struck by how wonderful it is to have someone, still somewhat human, smiling at him. Even if it has to be former Death-Eater Draco Malfoy, who is
Suddenly, Potter’s fury is turned upon him, green eyes blazing. “I don’t understand why you care so little. It’s your own bloody life! And don’t think I haven’t seen how you let people treat you.”
Without even looking at him, Draco can feel the shift in his mood. But all Harry does is climb down the walls of the well to Draco. He smells like pine and chamomile. He presses a wand into Draco’s hands. Fourteen inches, hawthorn, unicorn hair, and a distinct crack around the middle where it has been snapped and then put back together.
“Hi, Luna, thank you for having me! Hey, Malfoy.” Harry allows himself another smirk. Malfoy looks ready to explode.
“What-” he hears, somewhere from the doorway, and then the sound of footsteps following him over, picking through the messy living room.
“It’s just people like that awful family in Diagon Alley who care, because they probably see you as a symbol, the same way they see me as a symbol. But I wonder what they’re trying to prove, and who to. Anyways, that’s about all. I hope your wand works the same. Bye, Malfoy. Let yourself be happy for once, will you?” The Howler stops.
Anyways... that’s Blaise taken care of, who leaves with a much more amicable “see you around, Harry, and thank you!” at the end of the night
“It’s Draco’s.” Pansy smiles lazily. “You should crash Malfoy Manor. Me and Blaise will be there. I would
Malfoy gives him a mocking little wave as he declares “Malfoy Manor” to the fireplace flames and steps primly away.
“Thank you very much,” Malfoy says, and smiles irresistibly sweet at Harry. Harry smiles back, but quickly realizes what he’s doing, and wipes it off his face. Draco stares at him.
, you can’t just tap it for mana. Read the description.” Harry looks at the card description obediently.
He should’ve known Malfoy would be one of those people who tried to resist cosmic forces. Merlin knew he had always been stubborn. Then again, who was Harry to talk, when he had challenged Death for his own life?
“You too, Draco.” There’s the sound of footsteps approaching the door, but they hesitate for a moment.
But Draco doesn’t speak. And because everything is backwards, when Harry walks softly towards him, Draco doesn’t turn away or draw his wand. When Harry says “Show me your arm,” Draco rolls up his sleeve obligingly. There’s poetry in Harry now, in the way he moves and speaks and exists. Harry, so rough and practical, is now a sonnet to Draco. And Draco isn’t much at all. Potter, Potter, Harry.
Harry is only slightly mollified when Blaise drops off the ceiling to stroll over and wrap an arm around him, whispering “hey, Harry” into his ear, wiping the victorious grin off of Draco’s face.
“Oops, how clumsy of me,” he says. The line between their wrists recognizes Harry's second loss, flares, then dissolves. Draco’s eyes go wide. Harry takes out Draco’s lifetimer, the top bulb empty and still.
Draco talks to Ginny, asking her politely about work and thanking her for something, quiet and restrained the way he had been in Luna’s parlour. He talks to Blaise, heads bent close together, one of Blaise’s arms slung casually over his shoulders, both of them smiling seriously.
And with sudden knowledge, he realizes that he walked all the way here to hear Harry say his name. His first name, free of hatred and pain, the way Sarah says it, the way Harry had said it that day in Diagon Alley, and the time before that, in the cottage.
Somewhere, in some corner of Harry’s mind, is the sound of Draco’s voice, singing the lyrics of the lullaby that have winded their way into Harry’s soul. Outside, it begins to rain.
“No. Just doing my job. I don’t care,” and the three-word lie slips out easily from between Harry's lips.
“No, it’s fine, he apologized, remember?” Harry grits out. They’ve been laughing at each other’s stupid jokes for half an hour now. Hermione looks just about as irritated as Harry feels, and no matter how hard he tries, he can’t talk to her without being interrupted by some minor catastrophe caused by either Ron, or Malfoy, or both.
Luna looks wonderful. She’s wearing casual white and pale yellow robes, and miniature plum-coloured Sorting Hats as earrings. Harry tells her so, and she grins and thanks him. Since school, to everyone’s surprise, Luna had managed to prove that the imaginary life forms she saw all around her weren’t so imaginary after all, through careful photography and a lot of patience. There are still many strange things about her, however. For instance, right now she's launching Harry into a discussion on what it must be like to be a building rafter.
OR PERHAPS, THEY WERE ALREADY CLOSE DURING SCHOOL, Death muses. He picks up Harry’s scythe, abandoned on the floor.
So Harry cuts lifelines, consoles lost souls, helps the dead across asphodel fields, and is challenged to chess.
On June 5th, Harry goes downstairs to Grimmauld’s wine cellar, and picks out a bottle. It’s easy to choose. Draco had gravitated to the same wine both times he’d been drinking in Harry’s house. It’s some sort of rosé, Harry doesn’t bother trying to memorize the name.
as Harry kisses him back, with much less of the chasteness. Harry ends up hoisted onto the countertop, the whole of Draco’s body pressed against him, Draco’s legs wrapped around his waist, and doesn’t know whether to close his eyes or never blink again. The rain and wind sing on through the open windows, droplets and gusts whiling through the lights, wetting Harry’s hair, Draco’s clothes, their lips. Harry is struck by a sudden thought, and pulls away gently.
“I want you,” Harry had said, constantly, whenever he thought Draco wasn’t sure, or even just for the sake of saying it. He had been like that, the thoughts spilling from his tongue and teeth, thoughts that were repetitive whenever they were about his love for Draco.
Harry snaps his fingers, and a Monopoly board appears in the distance, floating in mid-air, along with two white plastic chairs. The background of the spectral Manor fades from view, leading only uniform greyness.
The affirmation is barely out of Harry’s mouth when Draco says frantically, “okay I challenge you.” The words create a glowing blue line in the air between Harry and Draco,  connecting them by their right wrists, and Harry sighs. Cosmic rules were exhausting.
“I’m sorry sir, I just really cannot understand you!” She looks at Draco desperately, so he immediately walks over. The man redirects his incomprehensible tirade at Draco.
You’re weird, Malfoy,” Potter suddenly declares, and walks away. A few minutes later, Draco smells chamomile. Potter returns, balancing two cups of tea in one hand, and places one by Draco’s feet.
“What- oh. Ministry letter. Did you do something wrong?” Harry says, as he stoops to examine the crumpled paper.
“Not for long. Excuse me, Malfoy, I’m gonna go acquire your mother.” And it’s all Harry can do to not follow his words with a hug, beg Draco to stay, ask him if he’s free later.
Pansy, on the other hand, is more difficult than anticipated, sitting posture stiff in her drawing room and staring thorny at Harry, holding hands with Luna. But Harry really wants her, because he suspects that him befriending Pansy would really piss Draco off.
“My parents say you are a bad man, who did terrible terrible things, but I don’t need to worry, because if you do more terrible things, they’ll send you back to Azkaban. They say because you’re bad, it’s okay to be bad back at you,” he proclaims.
He had thought Draco was using even his clothes in his, well, clearly successful attempts to get people to like him. Was that true? Or was it just coincidence that Draco targeted Ginny while in uniform, who was famous for her passion about work? Or that he was wearing Muggle clothing to talk to the blood traitor Ron Weasley? And wearing Slytherin green for Andromeda? Or was Harry reading far too much into it? He probably was.
“Yeah, Draco was assigned to be on that dragon trafficking mission with him, because, you know, department-wide fame for potion brewing skills-” Harry sighs. He has heard more than enough about Malfoy’s multitudinous talents. Harry listens as Ginny explains about the incredibly rude and rather creative insults Malfoy had thrown, after Peasegood had forbidden him, basically, from contributing to the mission at all.
And then Draco is tearing his hand away and wrapping it in Harry’s hair instead, slipping the other under Harry’s robes, kissing him chastely with a finality more crisp than the sound of marble against glass. Saying things like
“Whatever, Malfoy. It’s none of my business. Not to mention, I still don’t get what’s so great about this well that you come back here day after day.”
The first thing Draco sees is a small piece of furniture against a wall. One side of it is made of drawers, while the other half serves as a tiny table, a small space under it. It’s light brown in colour, and even from here Draco can smell the familiar scent of clean pine. Vaguely aware that there are other things in the room, he walks entranced towards the table-drawer, and without a word fits himself into the space under it, drawing his legs up and sighing gratefully. He tucks his head into his arms.
Minutes after, or maybe days, time is always confusing in these places, He showed up and stood next to Harry, watching the skeletal fish swimming in the pond.
Harry snorts. Malfoy sits there with one leg casually flung out, putting together what looks like a improvised bow, loose bits of hair that have escaped from his plait swinging into his eyes, and Harry
“Thank you, Narcissa. Actually, uh, I was hoping to talk to you. I realized I never actually thanked you for saving my life. Even if it was only for Draco’s sake. So, thank you.”
Draco can pinpoint the exact moment the Auror realizes who Draco is. He looks like he’s about to argue for a second, but he simply replies with “Basic qualifications include five NEWTs of at least Exceeds Expectations, preferably including Defence, Potions, Transfigurations, Charms, and Potions.”
It all starts with the house. It's ridiculously thin, like a pancake, about two metres wide and ten metres in length. It's two stories. Because of its thinness, it has a staircase at the back end, with steps so narrow they were more like ledges, on which you can barely get any purchase. At the other end, there's a cramped kitchenette, which leads into a cramped foyer, which leads to the door. Draco isn’t sure how it passed building regulations, but it was all that he could afford, after the post-war restitutions on the Malfoy fortune, and the impossibility of finding work.
Pansy rolls her eyes. “Call it pattern recognition. He seemed more smug than usual last night, which you wouldn’t think was
Harry hands the wine to him, who accepts it with a “Oh, thank you. I love this one.” Then Draco offers his own arm in replacement of Pansy’s, and they walk together down the winding driveway to the Manor, Draco’s boots and Harry’s shoes crunching on the gravel.
Draco pushes himself off the counter and pivots around to rest a hand on either side of Harry, with the quickness of a toy twisting in a child’s hands. Harry swallows.
Harry walks to the doorway, standing next to Andromeda. It’s Malfoy. It’s Malfoy, wearing Slytherin green robes and singing Teddy to sleep. But Harry has no right to be annoyed by this. Draco is Teddy's cousin, isn’t he? Just like how Harry is Teddy’s godfather. And Andromeda, still watching them, looks so serene.
“Sorry,” Draco can’t help but say, enjoying the expression on Harry’s face. He looks torn between frustration and confusion. Draco allows himself a small smile.
“I’m actually not the one with the complex here. Are you even listening to yourself, obsessively trying to thank people?”
Luna and Malfoy are sitting on a long sofa, talking quietly. Malfoy nods silently at her, evidently listening to some story or another, leaning forward with what looks like genuine interest. Occasionally, he asks a restrained, muted question. Huh. Strange. Harry thinks back to a presumptuous Malfoy flopping all over his couch, screaming out some horrid drinking song with Ron.
It appears that Slytherins are far more likely to bother talking to you when they’re in your bed. It’s nice to have uncomplicated sex. But Harry feels shocked at the sheer simplicity of it all. Should it be
“This is something I’ve wanted for a long time,” Draco says, and is shocked when he hears the honesty in his own voice.
Draco thinks. He remembers some kind of happiness, looking up through the darkness of a well, looking up at Potter while sitting half under his living room desk. But those places were from a different world, one in which Draco had been fettered and festering.
Malfoy glances at him, and he momentarily looks like he's gearing up to say something scathing, but he rapidly deflates.
in sloping cursive. Fifteen more minutes. Harry huffs impatiently, leaning against the brick of the Manor’s back walls, his scythe digging into his shoulder blades. He squints up at the afternoon sun, and inspects the vibrant gardens around him lazily. Somewhere, blackbirds chirp. Eleven more minutes. A spider drops onto his nose. Harry shakes it off carefully.
He finds an abandoned beaver lodge in a quiet pond, the branched knotted mass looming in the water like a dying beast. He swims up into it on days when the sun has warmed the water, poking his head into the inside while his feet remain on the silty lakebed, marveling at the industry of creatures long gone or dead.
Draco sighs, with an amount of exasperation that Harry feels is rather unnecessary. “Which, of the dozens of things I could feel guilt about, are you referring to?”
“It’s also funny that the deck you happened to summon, knowing almost nothing about the game, is extremely good against mine.”
He finds a broad, dead oak tree in the Wiltshire woods, the branches still reaching optimistically to the sunlight, a few naive young leaves still growing. But there’s a small gap in the bark, which is just big enough to allow Draco to squeeze through into the hollow, dark interior of the tree. He spends a lot of time reading by the glow of a Muggle penlight, in that cramped, quiet space.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE MY SERVICE AT THAT POINT, IT WOULD, Death struggled uncharacteristically for a moment, ALSO BE ALRIGHT.
Draco takes a step closer, almost crossing over the threshold into the house. It smells familiar, like chamomile tea and splintered pine.
He wonders about Harry’s pause for a second. But as Harry's words themselves register, hope flares up within Draco, bright and unkind. It leaves him feeling nastily exposed.
“Oh shoot, sorry, completely forgot.” Potter fumbles for his wand vaguely, gets frustrated, and says
“Were you looking for something, Mr. Potter?” Narcissa says, turning back to her supply of fertilizer.
When the boy nears him, Draco lowers himself, taking a knee, instead of walking on unseeingly as he usually does. The child stops, surprised.
Harry decides that he was wrong. It’s not any one reflection he was drawn to, but the components within, that are rearranged time after time, forming images that are at once the same and different. He likes Draco when he’s with Blaise, Ginny, Ron, Sirius, Narcissa, he likes Draco with anyone and everyone.
“Thank you thank you thank you,” Draco says, barely in control of his faculties anymore, delirious with relief. “Also, see? You’re gay. Told you.”
And so, galaxies turn, planets spin, bigots exclude, children keep secrets. The small worlds live on within the big ones, and something a lot like happiness lives on within Draco Malfoy, as he finally finds, in the swirling chaos of the worlds, a quiet kind of liberty.
He has stolen one last dance from the stars, but the time for waltzing is over. No more threes, because war drums beat in four. Deformed, sad, spineless, lame. Draco can finally be happy in a winter of discontent.
“Are you alright? Oh, fuck.” Draco’s braid is half burned off, and his robes are charred, flaking away onto the ground. There’s what looks like first and second-degree burns on his face and hands, which had been directly exposed to the fire.
The animated golem fires off another round of attack spells, narrowly missing Harry as he runs for the cover of a low-built stone wall. Malfoy, irritatingly, is already there, lighting a cigarette. As if the middle of an assignment is an appropriate time to have a fucking smoke. Harry glances around the Magical Gardening Society’s park, spotting two more golems skulking behind a set of greenhouses.
On his fourth visit, he finds Harry Potter standing there grimly against the well, arms crossed. Draco doesn’t even blink, but instead just stares at him warily. Potter’s wearing a Weird Sisters T-shirt and Muggle jeans.
“I wouldn’t expect you to understand, you who are used to the comforts of magical life,” Draco says, grinning.
good-looking. Tan skin, curly dark hair that wound chaotically over his ears and fell onto his neck, smiling brown eyes, always trying to get something. Or, apparently, someone. Harry allows his own eyes to wander, taking in Blaise’s lanky figure and easy confidence. And it’s not as if having a one-night stand
Harry snaps his fingers in reply, and two decks of cards and a playing mat appear. Draco spreads the mat out with long fingers, and settles himself grimly on the grass.
accompanied by Ron pretending to be a marmoset, counts as having it in hand, Harry thinks to himself.
Anyways, there’s no more time to hide from whispered insults in trees, is there? If anyone sends an owl with a response to his letter, he
“I and the others sort of imprint off of Him. I met Him once, outside of the challenge. He told me it takes the edge off.”
He begins to make himself a late supper, chopping up potatoes and dropping them into boiling water. He’ll pan fry them after in olive oil. The boil of the water and the rhythm of the knife reassure him. His wand never leaves his hand, even though he never uses it. He reaches for the dried rosemary in the cabinet, which is the only seasoning he has other than salt and pepper.
“Probably not wise words to say to an ex-Death Eater holding your wand in a small enclosed space. Who knows, I might go rogue and follow through.”
“I noticed,” and then Harry does start laughing. Draco looks outraged, which only makes Harry laugh harder. Harry accompanies him to the drinks cabinet in the living room, where Draco pours himself a copious amount of alcohol.
And maybe it’s because everything is backward, because he fails his favourite subject but succeeds where he is weak and unwilling. Because the innocent flowers of the Manor and the snake beneath them are now one and the same. All facades are truth now. That’s why when he sees Harry Potter in the mirror, like the lost child of an insubstantial ghost, he doesn’t move. Ghost, ghost, ghost. Potter, Potter, Potter.
Then an owl swoops in through an open window, narrowly avoiding ceiling fans and security cameras, and drops a letter directly into his face. And he can’t even Confund Sarah, who’s staring at him open-mouthed. He shrugs at her with all the haughtiness he can still muster, and stuffs the letter into his pocket. From the way the letter refuses to fold, he can tell there’s some kind of long object within it. He had caught a glimpse of a bronze wax seal, the Ministry’s seal. The very, very faint scent of splintered hawthorne wood makes its way into his mind, but he must be imagining it. He sweeps his way through the rest of his shift, the object within the envelope pressing against his right hip when he bends his knees.
Draco doesn’t think about open spaces or small spaces, and what they mean, or the guilt inexplicably tied to the wand in his pocket, or the way the Auror at the front desk had shrugged and smiled, or Muggle girls or beaver dams or the parents of boys named Tom, or dry wells and narrow staircases. All that matters is Harry Potter in front of him.
When he wakes up at six in the afternoon, he walks back to the abandoned well. Why, he’s not sure. Like the corner under the staircase, and his other spots, he doubts it will be the same as it was before.
Draco considers this. “Sure,” he says. Potter climbs out of the well, Draco extending a hand and pulling him up the last few feet.
Draco remembers when Harry used to touch his wrists just as tenderly, in hidden corridors and dusty classrooms, in second and third and fourth year. Harry touched all of him, then, when Draco was his. Ankles, calves, stomach, back, hair, eyes, hands. But now, all Draco gets is Harry’s fingertips on the short lines of the Dark Mark. For a horrible second, Draco wants the lines to be a little longer, the scars a little deeper, so that he could have that much more time with Harry’s fingers tracing along them.
“Malfoy!” a familiar voice bellows from behind him. God, this was all such a mess. Should have just let the bugger crawl onto Draco as usual.
When Malfoy returns, Harry tells him “Yeah, I know you’re not just being an Auror for cred,” which astonishes Harry himself, and clearly surprises Malfoy too. “So why? Honestly, I thought it was for the power.”
He looks at his cursive handwriting, scrawled line after line, then taps the letter with his wand, duplicating it with a copying spell, working a page at a time. Finally, he addresses each of the letters. Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley, what the hell, write all the Weasley’s in there, might as well send one to their parents as well. Lavender Brown. Parvati and Padma Patil. Luna Lovegood. Harry Potter. He sends the owl off, the many rolls of parchment clutched precariously in her talons, asks her to not accept return letters, and to return to Eeylops afterwards. She twists her head at him in acknowledgement, and flies away, flapping heavily.
Harry turns too, and sees Draco once again leaning against a tree, an ash tree, the irises and roses around him swaying in the wind.
“Guess we’re about even then, Harry.” He flashes a quick, bright smile, taps Harry on the shoulder, his hand lingering slightly longer than necessary, Harry thinks, hopes, wants. Draco wanders straight back into a conversation with Pansy, Luna and Hermione, laughing, listening and talking in turn. And so the kaleidoscope rotates again.
“All right. In that case, you may call me Narcissa. But I assume you wanted something other than idle chat.”
But it’s just Pansy, looking beautiful, her dark hair swept over one shoulder of an icy white short-sleeved dress.
Harry waits a moment for the revelation, then realizes there is no revelation, and gasps melodramatically. “
The balloons and streamers that someone has put up in the foyer do not mix well with the old-world stateliness of the Manor, but nobody seems to care. Pansy is chatting with Ginny near the punch bowl, Luna is talking to an upside-down Blaise, hanging gracefully off a chandelier, and- there’s a flash of Weasley red in the corner, speaking earnestly to a head of bushy brown hair Harry would recognize anywhere. Oh
“Aurors are also technically required to have a clean record.” It takes Draco a second to realize he’s referring to criminality.
“Yes. You have to promise not to tell anyone.” Draco glances up, to see Tom’s mom and dad looking nervously at the two of them, Draco still on his knee.
“Thank you.” He shuffles partially out of the desk so that he can drink without spilling, and when he does, he’s surprised to find that Harry looks intensely relieved. They sit in silence for a few minutes, before Draco says “I believe I was promised spells?”
When he returns home (but the pancake house isn’t his home, is it?) half a night later, Draco thinks about how happy, reassured, relieved Harry had looked, every time Draco asked for something or came out of a small space or stood up for himself. He looks out at the night through his tiny kitchen window, sprinkled with stars that have shined their way through the foggy skies of England. The weight of his wand in his hand feels like an old friend who’s been out of town.
“Look, Malfoy, you had your time,” Harry holds out the empty lifetimer helpfully, “now it’s time to go.”
Harry discovers that Blaise is actually much easier than Pansy, especially once he realizes the man is trying to get Harry to sleep with him.
“Is that what you do? Smile at people to get them to like you, so that you can get what you want?” Harry asks. He regrets the words as soon as he says them, but he’s unable to stop himself. It’s better than the other thing he wants to do.
Never has he heard his name said so casually, without the years of horrible decisions weighing upon it. It’s not a bad feeling. He hides a smile.
After seeing Malfoy with Ron, Ginny, and Luna, Harry actually finds it bizarre that he’s also friends with Pansy and Blaise.
Harry spends the rest of the night politely shutting down anyone who tries to start up a conversation with him, and instead watches the fairy lights dancing over Draco’s hair, landing on his suit jacket, and listens to the sound of Draco laughing. Because the nameless feeling that has overtaken Harry is awfully lonely. And horribly simple.
Malfoy smiles at him again. God, Harry doesn’t want him to stop doing that. But this time, he checks himself and makes sure that he doesn’t smile back, instead accepting Draco’s rent payment with good grace.
“Oh yeah? So you stared at Cedric Diggory platonically every breakfast in fourth year, then? And if you’re not homophobic, prove it.” Draco stares at him challengingly from the top of the well, then presses a palm to his forehead, rewinds what he just said, and winces. “Sorry, sorry. Not my place to tell you what your own sexuality is.”
The rain does, falling thick and sweet on Narcissa’s roses, pattering on rooftops, soaking those foolish enough to be caught out in it. But fools know, it tastes like lonely summers and wind-blown hair, beautiful complicated things and citrusy rosé and desire.
“Hey, hey, uh, Harry, you’re not,” Ron’s words slur, “not still mad at Malfoy? For being a piece of shit?” Ron falls half off the couch.
Draco leans in sideways towards Harry, trapping him against the peeling white paint of the doorframe. Harry leans back, gazes easily back at Draco, and stops breathing again.
Unfortunately, the next day, Malfoy retaliates by taking Ginny. When Harry walks into the crowded Auror cafeteria for lunch break, the first thing he sees is Ginny and him sitting side by side at a table, both still in their work uniforms. Ginny is almost bent over double laughing while Malfoy sits with his chin in one hand, smiling at her. Ginny punches Malfoy in the shoulder (those punches
“Yep.” Draco looks up, and sees Potter’s green eyes gazing at him through his glasses. Potter sitting cross-legged across from him, leaning against nothing at all. Suddenly, he feels the exact same way as he did in the well, looking up in darkness at a circle of brilliance. Reflected, seen, understood.
“Don’t be stupid, Draco, I could never really hate you,” he’d said on Draco’s birthday. A year later, when Draco broke up with him, he told Draco he despised him and his cowardice and everything else. But it was unfair to compare the beginning to the end.
Seven minutes. He wonders how Draco will be spending these last few moments of his life. In the distance, he can see the figure of Narcissa Malfoy kneeling, tending to her flowers gracefully. Well, he might as well go and find out what Malfoy’s up to. It’s almost time anyways. He stamps his foot against the ground, hard, and the world fades into grayscale. He walks through the walls, drifts upwards through a ceiling, then a corridor, until he finds Malfoy sitting against a desk, brewing some sort of potion. He’s currently crushing aconite flowers. Wolfsbane?
do you have to wear your hair like that? It’s fucking annoying. Can’t you make it look less good or something? It’s practically a workplace hazard. And also do you get your robes tailored? Because I don’t think Auror robes are supposed to look like that. It’s a fucking distraction.”
“Indeed.” The Auror eyes him. “You would also have to undergo a series of character and aptitude tests.”
“Alright, Malfoy. But I’m not sure how much you’ll get out of it, if you can’t try it out yourself.”
Like right now. Malfoy touches the end of his cigarette to a small flask of something, then turns around and hurls the flask at the golem’s feet. Gears within the golem clank for a second, turning its head to examine the object at its feet. Then, the flask explodes, blowing off the golem’s legs. Malfoy produces a small victorious smile.
Malfoy gives a short and brittle laugh. “Believe me, I’ve seen very well what happens when you do things for power.”
“It’s a secret. Dad says you can’t go around telling secrets,” Tom says, and pops his candy back into his mouth. Draco is reminded of himself, aged eleven, also parroting his father’s words. But Tom is so much better than he was.
He wishes Harry would come back and hug him. Before this bubble of time ends. He wants to hear those little lies again, all three of them. He wants to apologize for everything, to explain why, but Harry probably already knows why. He wishes that he'd go to Harry and hug him.
“What?” says Tom’s father, evidently surprised that Potter hadn’t immediately pulled out his wand and hexed Draco into little pieces. Draco gently pries his robes out of the man’s hands.
The next day is Gringotts day. He walks through the sunny streets of Diagon Alley. It’s almost a nice day. Well, not anymore, some little snot of a child is bearing down towards him. The parents hover vaguely nearby. He’s really, really sick of this routine.
“Oh. I meant to say Malfoy, but I suddenly felt so much hatred for you that I slipped up and said your first name instead. Sorry about that.”
Malfoy sits diagonally across from Harry, modestly eating fried rice with chopsticks as Ginny tells his story. It is indeed a very amusing story. Harry can’t help but grin at parts. Peasegood had always been a bit of a snot.
To his surprise, when he looks into the well, Potter’s already kicking around inside, muttering to himself.
smiles at Harry, then. Harry stares at his mouth, curled upwards in the ferocious joy of victory, of trying to exist, live, improve. Harry’s forgotten what that was like. He thinks about a tiny potions spoon, diligently ferrying aconite into a cauldron, about Draco, washing his hands clean, about “yes, Potter, things that are played earlier sometimes execute later, what’s so hard to understand about that.” He thinks about former Death Eaters playing Magic: The Gathering and about a handshake, offered to him when he was eleven.
Potter looks at him dubiously, but evidently he pays no heed to what happened to the proverbial curious cat, because he gestures Draco towards the well.
Harry’s also almost forgotten what it was to want someone. But he feels it now, curled up like a purring cat under his ribs, the hunger for pewter eyes, silver hair and a former Slytherin's unflinching determination. It’s the thrill of the reaper man as he watches the corn strive ever higher. But it’s also the melancholic warmth of watching a loved one try so unthinkingly, inconsolably
“Mr. Potter. Are you looking for the party? I believe it should be confined to the front of the house, unless it truly has gotten out of hand.”
Harry taps his foot against the ground, and Death’s gardens come into view. They’ve been meticulously planted by someone who learned what colour from a book and clearly not really understood what it was. The flowerbeds are full of blooming pale ivory lilies and passionfruit flowers so purple they’re black. There are tall spires of strange bulbous blooms, in all the shades of darkness. Albino lavender sways gently in the breeze, next to trellises of very, very dark red roses. Trees with black leaves and black trunks reach like concrete telephone poles to the sky. A path, paved with tar, winds through the flowers. Harry takes Draco’s arm, and drags him along, neither of their footsteps sticking in the tar. They walk past a pond, full of splashing skeletal trout.
But as always, he finds it impossible to understand why Luna’s close with Malfoy. Their natures don’t seem to complement, Draco loud and obnoxious while Luna is contemplative and considerate. On the other hand, you only had to watch Pansy and Luna together for five minutes to understand why they worked. Luna’s softness tempers Pansy and Pansy’s acerbity grounds Luna, despite how weird it had seemed at the beginning. So maybe Draco and Luna’s friendship was the same sort of thing.
Draco sighs dramatically, and then picks a Basic Island for Harry, his fingers brushing against Harry’s. Harry swallows.
“Merlin- Could you stop apologizing? It’s really throwing me off, hearing ‘I’m sorry’ coming out of your mouth.”
“Good grief Potter, we’re dead now, stop feeding your own Savior complex and let me thank you for something!”
Yes, he’s been hurting Potter. Insulting him, distracting him, using what’s left of his affection for Draco to catch him off-balance. If exploiting the remains of a schoolyard romance will keep his mother safer, he’ll do it! He’s not a monster. Schoolyard, monster, romance, his mind recites.
Potter follows him down, almost slipping a few times, and seems surprised when he hits the ground hard. He eventually rights himself, leaning against the wall opposite from Draco, the combined heat of their bodies making the well warmer than usual.
Ron? Wh- Draco?” The light spills out into the night from the open doorway, Harry standing just inside.
It’s funny how the shame of punishment resolves you from guilt, and when the punishment is lifted, you remember that the guilt has been there all along, hovering over your head like an old friend who’s out of town. That you don’t actually deserve open air, or wide fields, or smiles from Muggle high school students, or small children believing you when you say you’re a good person, and you
The leather chair creaked a little as Harry stood, and his socked feet padded across the rug as he shuffled over to the couch. He sat down over Draco's feet tucked into the couch. Draco looked up at him.
Draco looked to her. He didn’t need to ponder the issue. There were very few people in the world that Draco held interest in, very few that he enjoyed spending time with. Only one that he enjoyed spending time with, really. “I would love that,” he said.
Finally, Draco’s eyes lift to Harry’s. His eyebrows run straight across his face, his mouth relaxed. Harry isn’t sure if Draco is calm, or if he’s only pretending to be so he won’t scare Harry off.
Mrs. Weasley had put her hand on his cheek, and smiled with watery eyes. "You can call me Mum, dear."
Harry sits up, drawing Draco’s mouth up with him before coming apart. Harry lifts his arms into the air and smiles down at Draco sprawled back on the pillows.
"Well, that's obvious." Draco almost rolled his eyes before remembering that that was rude to do to anyone who wasn't Harry. "Polyjuice Potion. Robards could have cleared Bailey before he left, and then someone could've taken Bailey's place after he took up the position."
He finished work, glared at the interns, and walked out of the Unspeakable offices. Took the elevator, nodded to Bailey, who was filling in as head of the DMLE while Robards was on leave, and left the Ministry. He apparated home, and then stood on the front step outside his and Harry's apartment, and tried to imagine how he would explain to Harry that he didn't feel like going out to the pub with Ronald tonight after all.
Scorpius set his head down in the crook of Draco's neck, and Draco soothed his hand over his back as he walked around the edge of the house to the pathway into the main cobbled road. Harry stood waiting, his head down and his hand resting on the fence. Draco approached slowly and hushed to Scorpius to keep him calm and quiet.
Draco startled and glanced down at the Oxfords Pansy had sent him for his birthday a few weeks ago. They came late, which Pansy apologized endlessly for while simultaneously cursing out the Owl Post.
Bailey had continued on as if he hadn’t heard. “So I thought I’d make you a cup. As a show of interdepartmental cooperation. And you don't have to worry about poisoning,” Bailey said with a wink, “Because I made it.”
"-passing the baby all around," Mrs. Weasley was saying, gently stroking Molly's arm, who was giggling up at her and reaching out to tug on Mrs. Weasley's silvering red curls. "Percy kept saying you'd want her back before she got lost among all the other Weasley babies being handed off, but you know him." Mrs. Weasley sighed and looked down to coo at Molly. "Babies make him uncomfortable, don't they? Even pretty ones like you!"
"Yes, yes," Draco said. The cashier coughed. Draco reached over and handed her some bills Harry had counted out for him before they left for the market. "Is that what you were thinking?"
"I am very, very murderous," Draco said, glaring down into his earl grey tea. "Very. Did I mention how murderous I am?"
Often times, a deep pit would twist in Draco's stomach, and he would have to step away from Harry for a moment. As much as he loved these moments, uninterrupted stretches of time with Harry, the guilt was unavoidable. Harry was supposed to be happy, in his prime, preparing to be a professor at Hogwarts, and instead he was dragging Draco around in a wheelchair to entertain him until his death. Draco couldn't help but feel as if he was holding Harry back from his life.
Harry stood abruptly. His cheeks went ruddy, then blotchy, and his eyes squinted up tightly in the way they always did when Harry was trying really hard not to cry in front of Draco. "You don't know that, Draco!" Harry exhaled harder and shoved his hands through his hair, turning half away from him. "It's happening right now! What if I had been gone on mission when you collapsed onto the coffee table? What if there hadn't been anyone there to take you to Mungo's when you were burning up in the middle of the night?" He dropped into the small folding chair in the corner, shoved in beside a collection of half dead flowers. "You could've died. You
"Very," said Harry, and pulled on Draco's hand. Draco moved with him, barely a step towards the bedroom door. He knew what Harry wanted, and knew that he was right. They both needed to sleep, to rest, and know that for once一for the first night since Draco had collapsed onto the coffee table一Draco wasn't in danger of dying in his sleep. "I bet it'll be even faster tomorrow."
He knew, without knowing how he knew, that this was the last time they would do this. That it needed to count.
The next morning, Harry made Draco pancakes before work. They walked to the Ministry together even though Harry usually liked to use the Floo (because he was always running behind) and Draco usually walked to the phone booth entrance so he could stroll through Muggle London (because he was always too early). But they went together and held hands and did not speak about
.” Draco tilts his head and looks at Harry so earnestly and sweetly, that all of Harry’s thoughts and doubts tumble down him and away in dizzying cascades. “I love you.”
Harry inhaled deeply and held it there for a long second. "I worry when we're not together." He looked up at Draco, and Draco followed him with his eyes. "I don't like being away from you. I get scared something will happen if I'm away for too long. Like I'll come back and there will have been some random attack. Or some Ministry employee will have harassed you straight out of your job. Or you'll get sick and I'll come back and it'll be too late, and I won't be there to say goodbye一"
Draco walked slowly around his desk and pulled his chair out. All his files were still stacked neatly where he’d left them the day before, his mug set out with dregs of earl grey tea. Nothing seemed out of place.
Harry huffed. “You were supposed to be dead by now. I wasn’t planning on going back to teach at Hogwarts.”
Harry winds his arms around Draco, one hand tangled up in Draco’s hair, the other pressed into Draco’s spine. Harry runs his fingers over the ridges of bone and lets Draco move them together.
Draco smiled and took several of the packages out of her hands and set them aside on the couch. “Very glad indeed.”
Draco looked down at the top of Molly's head, a tiny pink bow lost in the dark curls. He smiled and pressed his lips to her head and breathed in the sweet powdery scent of her skin and hair.
With five days left, Harry lifted Draco out of the wheelchair and crowded him onto their bed. Draco couldn't move many of his limbs without help beyond the turning of his head and general lifting of his shoulders, so he lay on the bed, and let Harry move him how he wished.
Draco set the bag down carefully and didn’t push the subject further. He wasn’t sure if he was allowed to leave the estate. He supposed nothing would stop him. His parents couldn’t drag him away from the nearby towns from where they were residing in Wiltshire, so the choice was his. But Draco didn’t want to go out, and have to deal with stiff letters from his father if word got back to him that Draco had been going against his wishes. Best to write to him about it first before taking off. Draco was expecting a letter from Lucius any day now anyways. In his next reply, he would inquire about going out to town.
“Yes.” Draco spun around in his chair. “Where is the revenge, the dirty grudge? The complex and diluted motivation?”
Draco nodded in agreement, smiling openly at Mrs. Weasley. He had not always been able to smile at her so easily. It had been hard to even look her in the face when Harry first took him back to the Burrow in eighth year, almost a year ago now. Draco had thought that getting pregnant with Harry's baby would make it all worse. But, in all actuality, it turned out to be quite the opposite.
Daisy jabbed a pin through the sleeve dangling a little loose around his wrist before turning her attention to what he was holding up. “Oh! Every young gentleman and lady needs a nice bag to carry their things.”
Daisy bent over and unfolded the brown paper of the closest package. From it, she pulled out a bundle of ivory fabric. Draco squinted at it, but it was indecipherable until Daisy shook it out to reveal numerous creamy shirts, folded together haphazardly. Draco picked one up by the sleeve and held it out in front of him.
Harry set one of his hands over the swell of Draco’s stomach and pressed into his back just to feel the warmth coming off of his body. Draco only wore pajama pants, pushed under the roundness of his belly, and no shirt, and Harry wanted to press closer and closer to him until they were merged together for life. “How’s the little one?”
Draco took him by the hand and led him to their room. Harry followed blindly, unable to pull his attention away from Draco’s glowing face until they were falling back into white sheets and a nest of duvet and pillows. And from there, it was Draco’s stomach, and his legs, and the divet between his shoulder blades, and the dimples etched under his waist, and the skin under his ear, and the press of his jaw into Harry’s clavicle.
"Some curse." Harry dropped his chin back and stared up at the ceiling, his breath coming out too hard and fast. "Hermione said it means 'the loss is slow.'" Harry slowly lowered his gaze to look at Draco. "They were waiting for you to wake up to tell them if you got cursed in the past four months." Harry shook his head. "I told them you would've told me if something had happened to you, or if you'd gotten hit by an unknown curse, but they didn't believe me. I mean you would've told me, right?"
Thankfully, he did no such thing. Instead, he simply stood on the balcony and glared down at the top of Harry Potter’s inky head, sun reflecting off of his dark curls and the breeze lifting the fringe off his forehead in such a way that Draco rather wished Harry Potter would shave his whole head bald.
Draco said, “It’s alright.” Draco sighed and looked down at his hands, muddied up in the roots of dandelions. His anger at his father drifted away, not forgotten, but no longer at the forefront of his attention. “The burns weren’t too bad anyways. Wide, but not deep.”
"Yes," said Draco, and continued. "It is important to me that, after all this, you move on. Spend time with your friends, find another job, date some new people. I want you to get married, and have kids, and grow old with someone."
He wanted to absorb everything about Harry in these moments. In all moments, truthfully, but these ones especially. When Harry's hair stuck out in little tufts above his ears and the back of his neck, and his glasses sat on his nose slightly tipped to one side, one of his cheeks pink from laying on it. Draco wanted to be so close to Harry that there was no telling them apart, no pulling them away, no way to ever divide them.
Draco lifted his hand back to the top of Harry's spine and swirled his finger between his shoulder blades again.
Draco’s cheeks heated up, and he looked down. This was his way of showing friendship. He hadn’t had many opportunities to do so in the past, but now seemed as good a time as ever. No matter how it made his stomach turn and his face go blotchy. “I read a lot. Recently, I’ve been reading about the language and meaning of flowers. It doesn't all make sense to me yet, but I like learning about it.” Draco took a deep breath and ignored Kit’s wide eyes observing him. “Lemons happen to be a certain interest of mine.”
Kit leaned forward in her seat, positioned under an umbrella that was currently open and casting shade over a patch of pink peonies. “What do you think it means?”
Draco shut the door behind carefully and hung his bag on the hook nailed in to the wall. “Here I am.”
But instead of moving forward to sit down across from Draco, he walked around the table and kneeled down by Draco’s chair and set his hand on his thigh. He sat there, staring up at Draco like a pious man wouldn’t dare to look up to God. Draco looked down at him questioningly, still smiling.
Draco looked at Harry, at the cross of his eyes without his glasses, the yellow gold of the night lights reflecting over his nose and cheekbones, the curve of his bottom lip chipped by the slight bite of his teeth. "Hyphenate?"
The paramedic nods. “She’s okay,” she says gently. “There was no one else in the car with her. She’ll be bruised tomorrow, but she’s very lucky. Your partner - Draco -” she gestures to him. “He hit the left side of her car. The air bags on the driver’s side didn’t even go off.”
Draco stared. “Why, no. The Unspeakables do not require any additional assistance. Thank you for the offer.”
“Also,” Harry added. “I do care. I care too much about things, my parents always say. It bothers me when people don't care about the things that belong to them.” Harry laughed and shifted his position so he was fully facing towards Draco. “I didn’t think you would care. Nature and nurture and all that. But you… it was so clear in your face how much you did care, how reverently you looked upon these flowers that I believed to be dear only to me.” Harry laughed again and tipped his head back. Draco’s stomach dropped through the ground, and he stared at Harry unabashedly. No one had ever spoken to him in this way. “And you knew these things that I didn’t know, and all you wanted was to share this with me, without even knowing anything about me.”
Draco doesn’t argue, but he’s shaking so bad that Harry has to help fold his knees underneath him so he can sit down.
Most Sundays, Harry seemed almost normal. He smiled small smiles that Draco knew were for his and Scorpius's benefit, and kept up polite conversation until they reached the gates into the cemetery. Then he'd get awful quiet, and go on ahead without them. He'd take his time with his parents, and then he'd come back with red eyes, and wouldn't smile until they were home again. That was most Sundays.
Harry wouldn't look at him. "A couple weeks," he said. "I know this isn't my thing. You're the one who's sick, and I have no reason to complain or pretend I'm suffering just as much as you are一"
He hadn’t expected this moment to come so soon, to be so real. There was still several weeks until their actual wedding celebration, and Harry had still been building this moment up in his head at this time yesterday. Waiting for the precise moment when the ring would slip over Draco’s knuckle and come to rest in the place it would stay for the rest of his life.
A movement out of the corner of his eye brought his face up, and Draco saw Harry skid into the doorway of the kitchen, his eyes wide and panicked. Harry glanced down at the shattered porcelain, than at the puddled tea, and back up to Draco.
Harry swallows. This is the part of the conversation he’d been worried about. Not because he thinks Draco will judge him, or shun him, or think he’s weird, but because it isn’t what Draco wants. Draco wants this, and he likely wants it with Harry, and Harry doesn’t want it, so where does that leave him?
In the end, it turns out to be the fault of a malfunctioning light. The girl has insurance, Draco has insurance. No one is hurt. Draco gets a little bandage over his eyebrow, but doesn’t need stitches. Harry is so relieved he could cry.
Harry runs a hand over Draco’s hair one more time before turning to the clusters of police and the second car - the one Draco must have hit - run headlong into the rails on the edge of the road. Harry swallows hard. God, but he hopes everyone is okay.
It was all very mundane considering the fact that Draco had nearly died, and then promptly came back to life. And the first thing he was doing happened to be finishing a case he'd been working on for months. Not resting, or snogging Harry, or calling his friends in relief, but going back to work.
Harry dropped a kiss on Draco’s head. “Don’t forget to give Archie the card from us, and buy him coffee for the next two years.”
Not that it mattered. The Mortem case was still occupying the entire Unspeakable department with no new leads in weeks. Draco was about ready to punt someone's head off their shoulders about it.
Harry looked down at his hands, where he was holding onto Draco's full mug in one hand, and his own empty mug in the other. "Yes, I can see how she would do that," Harry said quietly. "Although I wouldn't have looked up the Latin phrase anyway. I didn't even know it was Latin. I just thought it was a curse."
“There’s no embroidery,” Draco remarked. And indeed, there was not. The shirt was made of a light linen with loose buttons lined up the front, and a relaxed collar folding down over where Draco assumed his collarbones would be.
“Yes,” she says, looking rather pleased with herself with her chin all drawn up. “The book says that the enchantment provides a binding connection to the user’s true love. One that doesn’t break until death.”
Harry slid a piece of parchment over to Draco across the table, a ballpoint pen gripped tightly between his fingers. Draco picked it up and read it.
In any case, Draco would rather not interact with Harry Potter considering his conflicted emotions and the strung up tension between them.
Harry dropped his forehead to Draco's, and smiled so big and happy that Draco thought his heart would burst open like the peeling swell of overripe raspberries. "Molly Potter," he whispered.
“Cleansing,” Draco answered after a long pause. “Lemons are a natural disinfectant, so I suppose it must symbolize being clean.”
Draco slid further and further down until his head was completely submerged in the water, and he could neither hear nor see anything. He stayed like that until he could no longer hold his breath, and then he came up for a breath, and then went back down again. He did this until the bathwater grew cool, and he was required to turn in for bed before he caught a cold.
Wilson was shaking his head vividly. "No, no. We got it wrong. Mortem wasn't the man; Mortem was the smuggling ring. The man was Adam Hornby."
The financial record crisis had been averted for the most part. Draco didn’t greatly mind writing a report on the Malfoy records, although it would be incredibly tedious. As for the stash under the bed, Draco was both relieved and strung up.
Harry wants to pound the steering wheel of his car under his hands. He needs everyone to be moving five times faster, needs to already be by Draco’s side, run his hands over him, make sure he’s alive. Traffic inches along with the lethargic roll of the end of the work day.
"What?" Harry asked. A hand came up to hold onto the back of Draco's hair. "What is it? Did I do something wrong? You don't want to right now? Are you okay?" Harry inhaled sharply. "Draco, say something."
"Right. Robards set it all up before he even left," Wilson said. "That's what I'm confused about. Robards knowingly, in advance, put someone in his position. How could someone have tricked Robards into handing over the DMLE for six months?"
"What?" Draco dropped his book off the side of the couch. He'd find his place later. "I don't want to tell people, okay?" He dropped his eyes to his hands, resting in his lap, and waited for Harry's desperate attempts to convince Draco otherwise. They didn't come.
Harry took a sip from the mug of tea and then held it up to Draco's mouth to taste. Draco did not taste, but he drank.
Harry stands, already running to the coat rack to grab his jacket off the hook and snatch the keys from the dish by the front door. “Draco. What happened? Are you hurt? Where are you?”
Draco sat then, staring down at the halves of lemon in his hands. One of them was squeezed out, the juice swirling and stinging in the bath. The other laid in his hand, warm from his palm, and the juice welling up between the wedges.
Draco grunted. "I just know they do. They have to have it on their job application to get into the department. Must add excessive cream to every mug of coffee in sight."
"I know." Draco shrugged and smiled. He pushed himself up out of his chair and walked over to Harry, slinging his hands over his hips and pulling him in. "I wanted to get up with you."
Draco rolled his eyes at himself and pushed his body off the ground into a sitting position. He rubbed his hands over his face, and mumbled incoherently to himself. There were few greater fools than he.
Harry thinks of that smile on Draco's face when he got his license, the bright light coming down through the cracks in the trees, white blond hair fluttering back under summer breeze.
He sits down, drawing Draco down with him, until they're curled up together in the water with bubbles foaming up around them.
"How can he not?" Draco said. He ran his fingers through the sheets, skimming through folds, edging around creases, until he found Harry's hand. "You're Harry Potter."
Draco dropped his things by the door and moved through to the kitchen. Harry looked back over at his shoulder and grinned at Draco before turning back to stir something on the stove. Draco came to stand behind him and pressed in close, setting his chin down on Harry’s shoulder and pressing his palms into Harry’s stomach.
The chant of Draco's name began again in Harry's voice. "Draco, Draco, Draco, Draco." A pause for air. "Draco, Draco."
It was a sweater. A navy blue cashmere sweater. Draco smiled. A muscle somewhere close to his temple twitched uncomfortable. Draco held the smile.
“I wasn’t being judgemental,” Harry said. His words came fast, honest and without filter. He caught wind of Draco’s expression, and said, “I really wasn’t.” Harry glared down at the dirt caked into his fingers. “I was surprised, but I wasn’t judging you.”
Draco sighed and set a hand gently on Harry's arm. "Darling, it's really nothing. I had a crush on you throughout school. Yes, I was an asshole and a bigot. That didn't cancel out the existence of my feelings. You honestly have no idea how lucky I felt when you actually wanted to go out with me in eighth year."
“You’ve got a bit of a problem with the interns down here,” Bailey said. “They run around with all kinds of information from the Department of Mysteries.”
“There’s people here,” Draco says, panic running rampant in his voice. “A woman. She helped me out of the car.”
"I thought you didn't want Molly to be a Potter," Harry said. "You were all 'who carried this child?' I thought that meant you wanted her to be a Malfoy like you."
Harry turned back to face Draco, settling Molly in his lap. He looked up and caught sight of Draco's panicked expression. "Draco? What is it?"
Harry picks up a piece of bacon. “Almost correct. The enchantment doesn’t die after death. That’s why it’s so complicated. It must be a mutual bonding, and both parties must be truly in love with the other. And the bond doesn’t break after death, which opens up a certain realm of questioning about putting intention behind spells.”
She was beautiful. A smudge of dark hair on the top of her head, a tiny wrinkled face, a little mass of Harry's pretty skin and Draco's moles. He kissed her face softly and she opened her eyes.
Draco smiled a little and reached over the edge of the bassinet to lift her out. No matter how many times he woke to the sound of Molly's desperate crying, no matter how many times he had to pat her back to sleep, or wipe her spit up from his neck, he never got tired of her. Her cries, her thick curls, the cast of her eyelashes over green eyes too big for her face. Draco was addicted, obsessed, in love with her.
Draco’s hands went slack. The mug and tea kettle dropped from his hands, almost as if in slow motion. Draco watched, apart, silent, as they fell and fell and clattered to the ground.
Harry drops his head into his hands and Draco rolls his eyes. Headmistress McGonagall stands up briskly and walks right out of the Great Hall. Hagrid bursts out laughing before knocking over the entire front table, and Professor Flitwick along with it.
Red welts rose up from his skin, marking from the middle of his chest down to the tops of his hip bones. Draco sunk down lower into the hot water and stared at himself. It would go away, Daisy had assured him. The bruises from the falling pots would too. And they didn’t even hurt so much, not now. The burns needled at the surface of his flesh under the bathwater, but the worst of it was over.
Inside their apartment, Harry walked into their bedroom while Draco followed close behind him and pulled open his sock drawer.
Harry watches him for a long moment from the doorway. The fall of his hair over his eyes, the curl of his fingers into his palm, the sway of his back. Something tight is still clenched up in his stomach. He could have lost Draco tonight. Easily. Just from pure bad luck.
Harry said, "Right," and then walked on, letting go of Draco's hand and walking right past him and on to his parent's graves.
They were still lying on the ground and Draco could feel the hardwoods clearly under his back. Harry didn't seem to notice. And Draco, sprawled on the floor with Harry’s body draped across him and his coworker standing hesitantly off to the side, was so relieved that he could feel anything that he didn't even bother to complain about it.
Draco knew this wasn't exactly true. Unfortunately, it just so happened that Pansy was off in America, and Blaise was gone in Russia somewhere, and his father was locked up in Azkaban, and his mother was locked in a mental ward, and - did he mention he was nineteen? And no one had minded enough to come back to England when Draco told them he was pregnant, and so that's what it was.
However, Draco had stopped working on the case files Harry brought home, and he had no idea who T.A. was, so he ignored it in favor of spending his hours alternating between reading Muggle true crime novels and napping.
Draco pulled back and rubbed his fingers over Harry's neck. Harry turned his head to the side and smiled lazily up at Draco.
Draco sat in the silence of his office for a minute before standing and pulling out his wand. He didn't think he'd be returning to this office any time soon. He'd only come in the first place to pick up a file Harry'd forgotten to take home with him last week. Draco waved his wand and orchestrated the packing of his things into conjured boxes. With one last flick of his wand, a stripe of tape sealed the last box. Draco levitated the boxes and walked out of the Unspeakable Department with them trailing behind him. Wilson was no where to be seen.
They watched television. Harry kissed the back of Draco's neck. Draco stuck a hand down Harry's pants, and they made love on the couch. Harry cried, and Draco tried to pretend like there wasn't a bottomless empty pit expanding outwards into his entire existence.
Harry inhales, exhales, presses his chin tight to a knob of Draco's spinal chord. "Okay, my love. You don't have to do anything you don't want to."
? You're the one that sent me a letter that said 'will fix you.' What in Morgana's name needed to be fixed about me?"
I have no idea if this story is cohesive at all because of how I’m writing in increments, but I hope you like it!
Harry shook his head. His cheeks were ruddy and his eyes squinted tight. "No, it's not your fault at all. You're the one who's sick, and it's your decision. It's no burden to me at all."
He closed his eyes and sighed.  "My boss wants to meet you at the gala.  Officially.  As my boyfriend."  He opened his eyes again.  "He cornered me today and I panicked so I said of course you would.  I didn't know how to explain that it couldn't happen."
"Or maybe I should keep it more private, like this," Harry teased, before closing his teeth around Draco's nipple. He flickered his tongue over the nub while he tightened his bite.
Right, stop thinking.  Draco did a lot of thinking and worrying and that was how this had started, so Harry could get Draco to stop thinking for a few moments.  Apparently he was thinking again, because there was another smack.  "God… Harry."
"You. You three are just so at ease with each other, and I mean you and Granger have been married for a while, dating forever, but it's just different than what I know," Draco answered.
Draco nodded.  "You will, go play the hero," he said with a huge smile.  He wasn't faking it. The entire exchange with Macmillian had made him giddy.  "Sir, I probably should return to my friends as well.  Have a good evening."  Macmillian did not speak with Skeeter again.
"School was the first time that I was able to do what I wanted.  I wasn't about to let you tell me what to do," Potter answered, making Draco wonder about his childhood.
"All right, so we've been together over a year."  They needed more than that, because he knew that they'd be drilled and while Potter might get away with not answering, he wouldn't be so lucky.  "Remember that time you got yourself hexed, that was-"
"Why?  I know you want me.  I can see the way you react when I get closer, the way your pupils get big, your breath quickens. You want me, and I want you, too. You know those Muggles I shag?  They look like you."
"Hello, everyone.  Happy birthday, Arthur."  Potter handed the man his present, while keeping Draco's hand tight.
"I do," Potter answered, calmly, although Draco could see Potter thinking behind those glasses. "Aurors have special entrances.  Anyway, I'm almost done.  Have a seat, give me five minutes and we can leave together."
"Fourteen months ago. Forced vacation, I remember," Potter said.  "That works.  You were part of the team helping me.  We started talking."
"No, I mean there's no 'her'.  Pansy mentioned that I have a boyfriend, which I don't.  She made it all up.  I had no idea that she was going to do that, I swear."
"I'm getting there." Harry soothed Draco's arse with the palm of his hand, before reaching for the plug.  He yanked it out, smiling at the gasp from Draco. "Anything you'd like to say?"
"As I'll ever be."  Draco took Potter's hand. He told himself that the little flutter in his stomach was due to the upcoming Apparition and had nothing to do with the fact that this was Potter. Draco was good at lying to himself when he wanted to.
Draco made sure that he wouldn't be given any new cases that day.  When Macmillian tried to give him a very interesting case, he had to back out, although the word 'boyfriend' was enough to ensure that he got home in time to change and be ready at the gates when Potter Apparated.
"Great, then if you don't mind."  Potter didn't actually wait for an answer to cast the oath.  It went slowly because the healer was too afraid to speak and the oath required a verbal acknowledgement.  Draco could admit to himself that he was rather attracted by this new and scary Saviour.  "Thank you for your understanding," Potter continued when he was done.  "Draco has told me how much he's learned from you, especially considering that the specialisation course is meant to be three years and not five.  You truly wanted him to learn."
"Fireworks make things fun. Come on, Draco, are you really so afraid to take a chance?" Potter asked.
Draco moved without hesitation, spreading his legs wide, just like Harry liked.  His breathing was getting erratic, waiting for something, although he never knew what would come.  He felt the warm oil slide down his crack and gasped.  It was going to be one of those nights, when Harry drove him mad with pleasure.
Draco rolled his eyes, although he really deserved that.  "You see, at work, the higher ups weren't willing to let me move forward.  St. Mungo's is half healing and half politics and as you can imagine my name comes with some baggage.  Pansy was trying to help, and well… she mentioned that I'm seeing someone, not just someone, but someone who could help with my position."
Harry pushed a finger in, thrusting it a few times.  He added a second and then a third, stretching him just enough not to hurt, and when he thought he was finally getting fucked, he felt a glass tip pressing against him.  The tip was so small, barely felt, but he knew from experience that its middle was extremely thick, stretching him wide and going in deep, constantly pressing against his prostate. "Oh Merlin."
Draco tensed up. "I would never do that.  I earned everything I was given and more.  I should have been granted my specialisation two years ago. I did all the work, took all the tests, worked on the right cases, but there's always something missing at the last moment and I must redo some exam or my notes on cases weren't precise enough to show that I knew what I was doing, all dragon's dung. Suddenly, I have a boyfriend and everything is fine, because two days later I got my specialisation"
After the trial and Potter's testimony, Draco had gotten a little obsessive, just a little no matter what Pansy said.  He'd read everything that had been written about the man, bought every magazine with Potter's pictures and if those were wanking material?  Well, no one had to know, right?  Oh right, he needed to stop thinking and start talking, because Potter was looking at him weirdly.
"I… never thought of that, house decorating isn't one of my strengths.  Would you like something to drink?" Potter asked as he went to a trolley with several bottles.
Despite the many years, Draco still blushed. They said that if you couldn't say something, you shouldn't do it, but they were all liars.  Draco had grown up in a very reserved environment and he was happy to do things that he'd never mention aloud.  Harry knew it, too, which was why he was chuckling. "Do you know why I like it?  Because with a little spell, I can see through the glass, inside you, where no one else has been, because you're mine. Every part of you is
Draco looked on terrified as Macmillian studied Pansy, before leaving them alone.  "Why did you say that?"
"Stop, I do not want to hear it.  There's absolutely no reason for anyone to share about their sex life." Ron shivered.  "As I was saying to Draco for finding the spell that made same-sex marriage possible.  So cheers."
The gala was going better than expected.  Potter was being the Chosen One.  Draco avoided him as per their agreement since they didn't want to be outed for real.  Potter had been too careful to ruin his reputation now.  When Draco saw that Potter was back with his friends, he approached Macmillian who had just moved away from Rita Skeeter, possibly creating some report to sell the story.
"Of course, Sir.  Harry will be delighted to get to know you," Draco answered, while thinking how screwed he was.  Majorly screwed.  They couldn't take away his specialisation, not anymore, but they could fire him.  They wouldn't say that he was being fired for lying about Potter, because that was ridiculous, but they'd find a way, a mistake, something, because even the best Healer made a mistake here or there, and with some cases, it was inevitable.  They would give him one of those cases, note his mistakes and fire him.
How the fuck could Harry manage to sound so in control when he was barely holding it together?  Draco didn't know and didn't ask, but he went to bed.  He didn't try to look sexy or pose.  Harry would tell him what he wanted, like he always did in nights like this.  He didn't have to wait long before the order came. "Legs up, hands holding the headboard, no touching for you tonight."
The rest of his words were cut off when Potter kissed him. It happened slowly, almost as if Potter was giving him the chance to move, but he felt like he was hypnotized, unable to look away.  Truth was that he didn't want to and when their lips met, Draco leaned against the other man, pouring years of desire in one single kiss.  His fingers closed around the robe and pulled Potter closer. Their mouths met over and over in a teasing dance, until Potter pulled back.   Potter's spectacles were fogged up and he took them off, revealing his bright green eyes.  "What are we doing, Potter?"
Harry seemed to know how Draco felt, because he took his time getting the lube and spreading it over his cock.  The thick head of his cock pressed against Draco, teasing for a few more moments and then he slammed in, his balls pressing against Draco's arse. "Merlin, you're so tight."
"And he is very gorgeous and talented. You should see what he can do with his tongue," Harry said with a grin.
"Promises, promises."  Harry's hand landed hard on his arse before it even registered, and when he clenched he drove the plug deeper into his body. "Fuck."
It was the talk of the hospital.  Only a mere month after Draco becoming a Healer specialized in spell damage, news of a fundraiser spread like fiendfyre through St. Mungo's.  It was their very first gala.  Shacklebold approved of the idea and now the gala would be held at the Ministry's atrium.  Potter would be the guest of honour, hoping to help with the fundraising.  Everyone was ecstatic.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, taking a deep breath before turning around and smiled.  "Healer Macmillian, how can I help you?"
The clapping and cheering got louder as he sang.  The word 'girl' was changed for 'Harry', but otherwise he sang it perfectly, not that it mattered at the moment.  The only important thing was the look in Harry's eyes when at the end of the song, he went on his knees and took out a wedding band with the Malfoy crest.
Harry rolled to the side, a hand over his eyes as he tried to slow his breathing down.  Draco cast a quick cleaning spell and rolled to his side one arm across Harry's chest.  Long breathes were the only sound for a few minutes.
"You, plonker."  Harry slid down his chair and kissed Draco as the bar erupted into an applause.  "Let's go home."
"No, I'll tell him.  I don't want any misunderstanding that this is coming from me, and I will go after him with everything I have if he tries to sell the story to the papers," Potter said. "St. Mungo's is half politics, right? Turns out, I have plenty of political pull."
Walking inside a room of Aurors with no wand, even years after the Battle and the trials put him on edge, but he had no choice.
"Right, the Weasleys. I'm sure they'll love this surprise.  May I ask why you need a fake boyfriend?"
With his new specialization came plenty of new responsibilities.  He was working hard, but it was rewarding work and he spent plenty of time at St. Mungo's.  Macmillian had become the champion of his cause at the hospital, making sure that Draco had access to the high profile cases that would help him move up the chain eventually.  With all of that going on, he barely remembered the 'conditions' until he got an owl from Potter, telling him that they'd be going to a party.  The date and time were listed.  Potter added (because he certainly wasn't asking) that they'd meet at the gates of the manor beforehand.
"I never wanted to get you killed.  Definitely expelled, and it's your own bloody fault.  I just wanted to be your friend and you hurt my feelings.  I wasn't really used to hearing the word 'no' until you came around," Draco admitted.  "It made me hate you and… obsessed, I guess.  Why didn't you want to give me what I wanted? I mean I know why now, but back then, I couldn't conceive the idea that anyone would deny me anything."
good.  He approached Karaoke like anything else in life. He picked the songs at the end of the night for their next visit.  He got Granger to get him the records and then he learnt the songs, but not just the words.  He mimicked every gasp, every change in tone, absolutely everything.  He even tried to match the look singers had in their album covers. He really did love all the long hair from the late 80s and 90s.  His rendition of
"You're not an Auror, no reason for you to know," Potter answered with a calm that was becoming infuriating.  Sure, Draco needed a favour, but that didn't mean that he was truly rational when it came to Potter, and he was looking forward to some of their banter. The conversation was not the only change.
He worked through his lunch hour so he could leave early and at four, he went through the department store window exiting the hospital and Disapparated.  His next stop was a phone box in the middle of nowhere.  He dialed M-A-G-I-C and was able to get access to the atrium of the Ministry. Getting access to Potter proved to be a lot harder.  While people could go to several offices without any problem, the Auror office wasn't one of them, it took a lot of convincing before he was finally allowed upstairs (he had the suspicion that him being a Malfoy asking for Potter increased the waiting time, but there was nothing to be done).
"Of course, and we both appreciate your diligence.  I'm sure that now he'll be able to advance like he deserves.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to keep moving. As you can understand, Draco and I can't be seen together."  He turned to Draco.  "I'll see you later at home."
Potter had grown up quite nicely.  He was still an inch shorter than Draco and yet seemed larger than life.  Annoying self-righteousness had turned into a quiet self-confidence.  He had worked undercover and that couldn't have been easy considering that everyone knew the Chosen One.  Even with polyjuice and glamours, Potter had learned to change who he was.  Or maybe people in general didn't know him as well as Draco did.
Harry laughed. "I did tell you you'd be punished."  He pressed it all inside, before smacking Draco's arse.  "On your knees, my love."
Potter joined them not too long after.  "Healer-in-Charge Macmillian I presume.  I need you to take an oath.  You see very few people know and it's unfortunate if one of those people decided to speak. I go to great lengths to keep my life private and I ask everyone to take an oath.  For their safety as well as mine," he said with a smile so cold that it sent shivers down Draco's back.  "Because if this were to be leaked, then I'd have to go after everyone I know, but this way, I can destroy the ones who didn't take an oath.  I wouldn't want to get you fired and be knutless. You understand."
He knew he was shaking in sever pain and tears ran down his closed eyes. He felt blood being removed from his beating heart and he opened his eyes despite the throbbing pain. A stream of blood was going in to Malfoy's heart. Despite the murdering pain in his chest he turnd to look at him. He was not shaking now and his wound on the chest was healing on it's own. In spite of the burning pain in his body Harry's heart swell in massive joy and he smiled in peace.
Potter dragged him towards his laptop and showed him the muggle beauty products and a wizards' website that sold some witch beauty products online. He ordered concealer and foundation for him which worked properly hiding his paleness and the dark circles.
Draco loved Potter's job and knew he was best at it but they had always argued and yelled at each other regarding risky tasks he always accepted. Potter was a true Gryffindor who was blindly brave and, well Draco thought very stupid.
Draco nodded. He waited till Potter take the lube and settled between his legs. Potter caressed the hole and slowly entered his finger. Draco moaned when he felt his finger in and the other hand around his aching cock working wonderfully.
Before playing with the refrigerator he placed six wine glasses on the pantry in a perfect line and poured red wine into each one of them with profound practice and artistry as a trained bartender. Then he made the bottle float towards Harry and knocked against his head rousing him from his work.
'I want to tell you this. You have to know. If I don't tell you this I might burst in to a million pieces.' Harry removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes.
She hugged him and then she held Harry's hand in both her hands. 'Once again Harry Potter. You did it once again.' Then she nodded at Hermione and Ron.
First Harry hit the climax in his hands and wet all over the sofa gasping and moaning loudly. In a while Malfoy released his ecstacy in Harry hugging him. He placed a prominent kiss between his shoulder blades and rested his head agaist the back of his neck. Then he released Harry and sat on the floor leaning agaist the seat of the sofa, running his hand through his hair while Harry turned lying on his back. They spent a few long minutes in pin drop silence.
Harry went for a walk in the Royal Mile Old Town and ate from a muggle cafe. For some reason he imagined if Malfoy was with him. He would grumble but it would be nice to walk in the city with him. Do some shopping and kiss him in daylight. The thought made him happy.
'Was it true you walked away from that creepy woman at Hogwarts?' Harry heard him asking Hermione in the kitchen. Ron and Harry were playing chess one Sunday evening when they were visiting them.
He knew he needed more. He could still smell him and taste him in his mouth. He loved it but he had to forget it. Perhaps a bath and a smoke would do the trick to cast it away.
Draco noticed that the sun had set and there were stars in the sky. It was very cold and his nose was bleeding again. He realized that blood stains were on his shirt. He cleaned it, kissed the tombstone and came home.
That night they had sex. As though addicted to each other, mad about each other, they had sex. Harry fingered Malfoy's yearning hole lovingly with lube and then entered his desperate aching cock gently, caressed his warm moist back. He held Malfoy's warm beating chest and kissed the sweet smelling skin of his back.  He loved when Malfoy moaned in pleasure. Harry wanted to say how much he loved this. He wanted to say how much he wanted him, how much he wanted to do this all night long. But he did not. He caressed him, kissed his back, hugged him, ran his fingers in his hair, turned his head and kissed him. He shagged him. He shagged him hard, slow and deep calling him his baby  while holding his already hard cock and stroking.
He watched Potter's face, took his glasses off and gazed in to his eyes. They were full of passion and adoration. He touched Potter's face and watched how he closed his eyes to his touch. He had never done that before.
Harry let go of Hermione, put his shirt on and walked towards Ron and Malfoy. He hugged Ron and told him to go for Hermione and walked towards Malfoy.
Went to see Hermione and Ron and thanked for coming to see him, taking him out for lunch and dinner. Came home and fell asleep on the bedroom floor.
Potter brought dawn to life. Summertime and butterflies and all the colours. In his arms, in his warmth, in his smell, listening to his brave heart, it was alway the golden colourful beautiful dawn to Draco.
Harry yelled horrified, bent, hugged him from behind wrapping his hands around his body and pulled him towards him, away from the book. The force of the book was so powerful that Harry's whole body strained in pain. He pulled his wand out cast a rope to bind him to the sealed door and he hugged Malfoy and tugged both of them towards the door. finally the force of the book broke and Malfoy leaned slack against Harry's body.
'Hmmm!' Goerge waited till he finished eating the second sandwich. 'I remeber you telling me that though it was hard on me, Fred's in a better place, away from all these crap, and I should be happy about it,' he said quietly tooking at the stars.
Potter had just finished buttoning his pants and was going to wear the shirt. He stopped getting dressed. He put his shirt on the chair and came towards Draco who was sitting on the bed still wet, in his towel.
Draco bought white roses and walked when the sun was setting. Kingsley had created a cemetery for war heroes. It was a beautiful peaceful home for the brave hearts. He found him. He touched his name. He placed the flowers. Sat there and waited. He didn't stare into nothingness. If he dug this grave he could get his bones. He could find some other ingredients and cook up a dark spell and bring him back to life. He knew he could do that. Potter would surely yell at him.
He turned his head and smiled at Harry sweetly closed his eyes and rested against his body. He didn't respond to Harry's call. Harry called him again and again but he remained motionless in his arms.
Narcissa Malfoy was reading an ancient grimoir belonged to the Malfoys regarding curses. Malfoy was lying in his room and Harry could see he was turning very slightly grey.
He sat on the bed, drank some water to calm himself. He knew he was going crazy but he could not brush off the compelling need to touch the sleeping man next to him and make sure he was not dead. He watched him sleeping for awhile and ran his hand down his back caressing softly.
Draco's face lightens up with a strange smile. He walks towards the sofa and drops himself next to Harry. 'It's like obsessive love.' He toes off his shoes and pulls a barefoot up the sofa towards him resting his head on the back rest and smiles to the gaudy chandelier Dudely has replaced which was very Aunt Petunish. 'You know Potter?'
Potter removed his fingers moaned in sheer pleasure and entered Draco. He winced first but caught up the rhythm and found the glory in it.  Potter bent and kissed his parted lips hungrily time to time and they both moved so in unison losing control and losing every sense of time and space.
Not just a curse breaker, he was the best curse breaker the Gringotts had. Harry had heard some aurors say that he was even better than Bill Weasley. Everybody knew he was paid well by the goblins and he accepted ancient, complicated curses and curses with a potential high risk wordlessly. He had started his job probably the same time Harry had started his work as an auror in the ministry. Time to time Kingsley invited him to help him with the curses of dark objects ministry had to deal with and Harry knew Draco Malfoy did not charge a Knut for working for Kingsley.
Harry  brought dying Draco Malfoy to Scotland to the Stonehenge. Hermione had marked a circle and while Ron frowned the whole time she performed the dark magic from the grimoir.
While he was living a luxurious life in Malfoy Manor very much spoilt by mother's and father's adoration Potter might have cried for milk in that muggle house. No one might have sung him a lullaby. No one might have cuddled him, pampered him. Then he grew up to die for the world. If these two people had lived Potter would have lived a happier life.
He loved staying at home shut down, sitting on the floor, sleeping on the sofa or doorstep drinking coffee from the machine, wearing his clothes, smoking. He found peace in it.
Potter would always wrap his arms around Draco and hold him. Draco loved leaning against his body. To feel his beating heart. His brave heart. His pure heart.
He felt calm. He coughed. The chill was strangely comfortable though he was shivering. His nose started bleeding again. He held the badge and  leaned agaist the railing. He had tried enough. He was tired. His heart was tired. Tired of trying to let go. It doesn't matter what people say.  His heart cannot beat anymore without him. His heart ached. His soul ached. He closed his eyes and the world became so colourful.
Harry put the book aside, took off his glasses and kissed him back thoroughly stroking his hair gently. He was happy. He was happpy with this family. No more dreams haunting him. No more fears.
Harry couldn't understand that beautiful mild expression he gave George and the sweet moment they shared.
Draco felt his hand going through his skin, flesh and touching his heart and trying to make it beat again. 'Draco come on! This is not your time.'
Draco woke up. He was sleeping on the kitchen floor. No cigarettes. He was wearing his own night shirt and jeans. The heater was on. He was warm. He made coffee. He cleaned the house. Washed the clothes.
'This is the second time he did this Weasley and you let it happen. You let him fly in that burning room for me and you didn't stop.'
At the end of the session Malfoy was extremely tired but spent another hour answering all the questions and talking to those who had reached him.
Draco felt something was breaking in him. He was vulnerable and bare in Potter's arms. It was not that he had just fallen in love with Potter. He had always loved him. Draco had never loved anyone else. Potter was his every love. He finally accepted that he had no way out of it.
And Potter would use the bath first while Draco tidied their bedroom and then Potter would prepare breakfast while Draco washed himself. Potter left for work early and Draco cleaned everything spotless before he started his work because living with Potter was like living with a real life Quidditch player. He would drop his towel and cloak and shirt and T-shirt and everything everywhere. Mrs Weasley once said he always waited till the last minute to do the laundry. After the usual cleaning is done Draco would start his work. He didn't have to report to work everyday and usually prepared his research reports at home or in a library.
"It's not my fault. You know I'm slow unless you tell me what's going on.  You should have told me and we could have saved ourselves the trouble," Weasley answered, easily.  "And what are you staring at, Malfoy?"
"And?  There's no way you came to the Ministry to tell me this if it were over," Potter said, crossing his arms and staring Draco down.
Dating Harry Potter since they were twenty-four meant that in the past eight years Draco had learned a lot about Muggles.  Not that some things still didn't leave him bewildered.  For example, why eat fish and chips with your hands when Muggles had come up with little plastic forks that were right there to use?  Or why go to the cinema, order a large popcorn, candies and chocolates and then ask for a diet coke?  Better yet, why did they take their shirts off as soon as the sun came out, sprayed themselves with sunscreen to still get sunburnt since Englishmen were too pale when they could have solved the problem by keeping their shirts on?  These questions had yet to be answered, but there was one Muggle tradition that Draco had embraced: Karaoke.
told him that he had completed his specialisation and was assigned his first solo case.  It was fine.  It was perfect.  He could do his job (and he was very good at it) without any problems.
Potter shrugged before taking a sip of the firewhiskey.  "I enjoyed myself.  You're not terrible now that you don't want to get me expelled or killed."
"Where are we going? Is this good or should I change?" Draco asked, always aware of the way he looked.
"Thank you for having me, Mrs. Weasley, and happy birthday, Sir," Draco said, politely, although he wished that people would stop staring right about now.
Draco rushed up, forgetting the plug for a moment, before a shock of pleasure ran through him.  His cock twitched in reaction, come leaking from the tip.  Fuck, he was so close. He'd wanted Harry's cock since the club, and then-   A hand connected with his arse, making him clench, moaning at the sensation.  "Stop thinking and get in bed."
"And on that sappy note, we need to go and talk to your father and make sure he doesn't explode." Harry pulled him away with a smile that fell as soon as they stepped away.
Draco dropped to his knees gingerly, the butt plug feeling big and heavy. He should hate it, but it only made him harder. Harry's cock was right there, in front of his face, but he knew better than to start without permission, not if he wanted to get fucked properly, and he really did.
Potter snorted.  "No one ever thinks that there's an entire Muggle world with billions of people and that's exactly why I date Muggles.  Wizards don't suspect, Muggles have no idea who I am and they can't sell my story to the papers.  So, why hasn't this Healer said anything yet? Harry Potter Is Bent would sell quite well."
"No, I don't want them to hate you.  We'll find another way."  The kiss took Draco by surprise, but it was soft and quick and he didn't have time to think about it too hard, because Arthur Weasley was only steps away.
"Yes… well, he's such a good healer, I wanted him to know everything before moving forward on his own," Macmillian said.
Weasley shrugged.  "Figured it was him.  Harry's always been obsessed with him and when he stopped telling us about his boyfriends, Hermione and I figured that there was only one person it could be. Git-  I mean Malfoy showed up at the office a few months ago and that was pretty much it."
"Open your mouth."  Harry stroke his cock a few times lazily. His fingers raked through Draco's long hair and Harry gripped it at the back.  He ran his cock over Draco's lips, before pushing it in.  He sat the pace from the start, rocking his hips and driving his cock deep into Draco's mouth until he was gasping.
Draco nodded.  "I'm not here on work matters.  It's… personal, but I didn't know how else to get in touch with you.  I wasn't sure that you'd answer owls from random people."  It was known that Potter got hundreds of pieces of correspondence and if rumours were true, he burned them without opening them unless they were delivered by owls he knew.  "I can wait in the atrium until you're done.  I came here because I wasn't sure if you left from somewhere else."
