“Harry, I ―”
“Where to, Potter?” he calls.
on board, Draco’s team never lost. He’d hover around awhile, watching the match; but as soon as he became bored or they started losing, the Snitch would suddenly appear in front of him, an easy catch. He tried ignoring it, but the damn thing would practically smack him in the face until he gave in. As a result, their matches were getting shorter and shorter. Even Draco’s teammates – initially pleased to be unexpectedly top of the league – were becoming annoyed at the predictability, making loaded jokes about how

Pansy and Lee, sprawled languidly across their respective deckchairs, were apparently entirely unaffected by his tragic tale. In fact, as he watched, they exchanged knowing smiles. He rolled his eyes, hating them both a tiny bit.
” Malfoy called back – but he didn’t look over, or slow down in the slightest, and so, slightly helplessly, Harry pulled up alongside him. Malfoy glanced over then, taking in Harry’s face, which was definitely flushed and sweaty, before shaking his head in exasperation. “Potter, I already

Thank you so much for reading!

“No, I…”
Draco trusted Lee, he really did, but if there was one thing Pansy Parkinson was good at, it was extracting gossip. He lifted his head, thinking hard. “All right, all right, I’ll tell you.”
“…So I asked Hannah, and she thought of someone, and last night we went out – double date, you know, to make it less uncomfortable? I picked a Muggle place, thought we’d be fine, but we must have been spotted, because this morning Rita bloody Skeeter Owled me for a comment. We’ve all spent the morning trying to suppress it, but it looks like the story’s going to break tomorrow. I just feel so guilty, you know?”

Draco pulled himself forward a few more inches and felt above his head for the rim of the bath. It was cool and pleasant under his sweaty fingers, and he allowed himself a brief rest before taking a deep breath and hauling himself to his feet. As his vision started to narrow again and the rushing in his ears got louder, he surged forward and grabbed at the cabinet door, yanking it open so hard that he heard one of the hinges snap, opening the inner drawer and finally, blissfully, closing his fingers around a vial. He snatched it to his chest and let himself drop to his knees, before rolling onto his back.
that at times she hardly stirred from her bed. Draco understood. Some days, it was all he could do to leave his own room.
?” Draco’s outraged voice echoed through the cavernous entrance hall. A group of schoolchildren paused, halfway up the ornate staircase, looking around curiously for the source of the outburst.
Potter’s eyes narrowed. He folded his arms across his chest. Draco’s gaze automatically flicked to his biceps where they flexed against the tight dragonhide. “Yeah, and I know what you’re going to say, so don’t bother.”
He’s so slight – almost fragile – like this, hunched over before Harry, swamped by lime-green scrubs. “You know what’s going on, Harry.” His words come out small and flat.

The third time Draco woke, hunger was gnawing at the pit of his stomach.

another way out. Maybe all he needed was a little more… clarity.
“So, you’re an Unspeakable now.”
. It always felt detached, unreal, like the end of a very pleasant dream, and Draco regularly found himself wandering around the shop with a smile on his face, lost in his fantasies. So, it was with some considerable surprise that, one afternoon, caught in up such thoughts, Draco exited his lab to find Potter– the real Potter – standing directly in front of him. He was dressed casually, in an oversized maroon jumper and blue jeans that reminded Draco of their school days. He nodded amicably at Draco.

“But – but that’s not what I said!” Draco choked out, desperate.
Hermione pursed her lips, but before she could formulate an appropriately sarcastic response, Malfoy let out a great heaving groan and rolled onto his hands and knees. He was still staring off into space as he struggled to his feet, his lips a garish cherry-red arc, tongue visible through the gaping hole where his front teeth had once been. Most disconcerting of all, though, was the blissed-out, beatific expression writ across his broken face.
. Apart from a hazy outline – tiny flashes of events – he could barely even recall the night of the ball. Worse than that, his memories of time spent with Harry before then were reduced to a jumble of scenes and snippets of conversations – a shy smile here, a brush of the hand there – nothing concrete. Thinking hard about Harry made the room seem brighter, made Draco’s breath catch in his throat and his cheeks flush, but he couldn’t for the life of him put a finger on
“Only every day,” Draco said, truthfully. He shivered, suddenly exposed, and wrapped his arms around himself defensively, waiting for Harry’s response. But none came; instead, Draco found himself surrounded by a cloud of warm air, his frozen face tingling pleasantly. He nodded his thanks and was rewarded with a shoulder bump from Harry.

Draco took pity on her. “Pans, I… I’m really sorry about what I said before. I was hurting back then, and angry, and far too sensitive. I should never have reacted the way I did. I― ”
For some reason, her words made Draco think of Potter, of rumours about a cupboard, beatings,
Draco’s heart sank. It made sense, he realised. Obviously, it would be too much for Harry, to be back here – back in the place where he’d discovered Draco’s betrayal, where he’d sat by Draco’s bedside and nursed him through his illness, where he’d kissed Draco for what he’d believed was the very last time. But this – his little flat, over his little shop – this was Draco’s home, his comfort, his world.
Draco frowned, feeling vaguely unnerved. No one had ever criticised him after he’d taken
“Lee!”
“That you pitied me? I don’t want your pity.”
“And…?”
favourites! I want to make you happy – come on, give me a clue. Anything.”
“Mmm, thanks,” said Harry, biting his lip. “I like your robes too. Bit more understated than last time, I guess, but that’s no bad thing.” He leant in, eyes sparkling. “Especially if they’re just going to end up on my floor anyway.”
“Sorry, sorry, I… of course,” stammered Hermione, rushing over to the crumpled figure at Pansy’s feet. It was Malfoy, of course, although barely recognisable. His head was turned to the side, an awful mask-like impression of his face stamped in scarlet on the parquet floor beneath his cheek. Watery blood poured from the crooked wreck of his nose, splashing onto the edge of the rug and seeping into his unkempt hair. The thin line of his top lip was distorted by a gash on one side, and his breathing was heavy and wet-sounding. She could see his throat working continuously above the neck of his pyjama top as he swallowed again and again.
"Alright," Ginny said once she was certain that they were out of earshot and walking down the deserted Hogwarts corridors towards Gryffindor Tower. "Here's what's going on. I heard from a little birdie that Harry's going to go meet his girlfriend tonight, as he has been doing for the past few nights."
Hermione sat up straighter and cleared her throat before replying with, "Truth."
"Merlin, Harry when did you get so evil?" Justin asked him, his words muffled by his hands. Harry just shrugged, "Well about a minute ago," he replied.
When Draco returned to their work station, grumbling about how Potter was absolutely useless, he was met with a sight that wiped the scowl right off his face. Harry was bent over their cauldron, stirring lazily and leaning forward, with his arse pushed high in the air.
Draco then thought about a lubricating charm, but the amount of slick Harry was producing made that unnecessary. Draco ran his prick along the crack of Harry's arse, his head catching on Harry's rim deliciously. Harry began to thrust back, trying to get Draco's prick inside of him. Draco laughed before slowly pushing his spongy head into Harry's eager dripping hole.
"'Mione he'll be like this for a week," Ron told her scratching the back of Harry's ears. "You'll have plenty of time to pet him."
Harry scowled at that. "I don't need a babysitter."
Ron still seemed sceptical. He opened his mouth and closed it again, not knowing what to say. "Please Ron," Ginny begged, "I haven't been able to move on since, and I know this sounds crazy and I'm actually happy for Harry it's just......"
"You better not fucking hurt him Malfoy or else-" Weasley shouted after him.
With their mouths hanging open, frozen to the spot with no control whatsoever of their legs, staring at Draco and Harry cuddled together on the bed, dozing off happily.
Harry was sitting at the Gryffindor table stabbing his fork into a very sad plate of pancakes. He had hoped that his last year, now free of Voldemort, would be quite normal. As normal as it would be for the boy who lived. Yet, he was misconstrued once again. Ginny had wanted to loose her virginity last night. After about and year and a half of dating, he couldn't blame her. It wasn't Harry's fault that he wasn't emotionally or physically invested in their relationship as he once was. Or was it?
That's how they ended up knocking over the cauldron for the second time. Only this time, fortunately for Malfoy, he had let go of the rod and jumped away in the nick of time, leaving Harry spiraling to the floor with the force of the pull, bathing him in the potion from head to toe.
Harry whimpered and turned his head over his shoulder biting his lip in an attempt to be quiet. He reached an arm around Draco's neck and brought the blonde's face closer to his.
"Ron! I need to talk to you, it's important!" she said panting.
Ron looked as miserable as Harry felt. "Fetch!" he squealed, "Fetch, mate! She thinks I'm a bloody dog!"
Madam Pomfrey furrowed her eyebrows, "Appears he's cold, or in need of comfort, poor little thing."
"Merlin, Harry, you're so wet...you must be aching for it, such a slut for my cock." Draco stuck two of his fingers into Harry's hole and they slid in without any resistance. It was as though Harry's arse was a toy, meant to get fucked. Harry moaned wantonly and thrust his arse back onto Draco's fingers, fucking himself on Draco's digits.
Draco flinched, cowering in the bright light. Once faded away, it revealed Potter crouched in the fetal position, clearly unconscious. However, that wasn't the most bizarre part.
Harry scowled at his boyfriend. "Yes eager you git. What part of fuck me don't you understand?"
"Nothing 'Mione," He lied, "I just need to go to the bathroom."
"You're sensitive here," Draco mused continuing to caress the cute tail. "Hmmm," Harry hummed in response.
Hermione scowled at him but obeyed, giving Draco a petrifying look.
Hermione just stood there listening to his rant, not moving a muscle. "Are you done?" she questioned, with a raised brow.
Draco just couldn't take it anymore. He reached out with his fingers to touch Harry's cute little bunny tail which was sticking out right above his arse. The tail was even softer than he expected and soon he was running his hand through the fur and tugging at it, while it twitched under his fingers. Draco started petting Harry's ears with his other hand and immediately noticed the pleasurable noises Harry was making muffled into his chest.
Ron had stopped walking and was staring at her with wide eyes, dumbfounded. "Oh come on Ron! I know you want to find out who she is as much as I do! It's been the only topic of conversation of yours for weeks!"
Harry didn't know what was happening to him. Sure he didn't find Ginny all that attractive as he once had but the thought of being gay had never crossed his mind. He had never had such a strong urge to have a cock or anything up his arse. He whined, thinking about how amazing it would feel filling him up. Just when he was about to cram his fingers up his arse again, he heard the shuffling of footsteps.
Suddenly with Malfoy so close to him, the heat radiating off Malfoy's body, Harry couldn't take it anymore. Draco Malfoy had never looked more handsome.
Ron and Ginny were glaring daggers at him, and inevitably, Harry began to stir. He rubbed his face on Draco's chest and opened his eyes taking in his surroundings. Frowning he noticed the hard, yet warm chest he was resting upon and looked up to find none other than Draco Malfoy.
They watched in shock as Harry hadn't even bothered to acknowledge his boyfriend and was pretending to be extremely curious, inspecting an old Malfoy heirloom on Draco's nightstand. Draco went up to Harry and hugged him from behind, his arms curling around Harry's abdomen as he sucked on Harry's neck.
"All right everyone! Gather around, as I'm sure you've heard, we are gonna be playing truth or dare again this Friday, however tonight, we'll be playing the extreme version." Hermione addressed the whole group of eighth-year students sitting around in a circle. The only non-eighth years present were Ginny and Luna. Luna was sitting next to Neville, whilst Ginny found herself on Harry's lap. Harry managed a smile as Seamus gave him a thumbs-up.
"God, you feel so good Harry, so tight!" Draco kept pushing his length into Harry until finally, he bottomed out. After a few moments of heavy breathing and allowing Harry to adjust to the intrusion, Draco pulled all the way out and slammed back in again. Harry cried out in pleasure, and soon they established a good rhythm, Draco fucking into him from behind thrusting harder and deeper each time.
"Oh, shut up!" Harry muttered, clearly annoyed at the whole ordeal. "Awww Harry you're so adorable," Hermione cooed, her hand moving towards the top of his head, "you really can't blame people for wanting to pet you."
"It just looked really soft, Harry," was his response. "Hmmm," Dean said reaching out and stroking Harry's ears, "They are really soft, not to mention adorkable." Harry scowled at both of them and swatted their hands away, getting up and walking over to wedge himself between Hermione and Ron who were laughing at the situation.
"Has Harry been wearing that all day?" he screeched. "Dear Merlin I never wanted to find out about Harry's sex life. God, I thought he liked to fuck girls! Not get fucked by Malfoy!"
"Draco! Please!" Harry cried unable to take the tease any longer. "What do you want my sweet little kitten?" Draco asked.
Harry's eyes widened and he jumped back in fear and shock. "What the hell?...." he murmured.
Harry pursed his lips, his eyes catching sight of platinum blond hair. Harry watched as Malfoy strode in wearing a white button-down and black trousers. The button-down hugged his figure, displaying a good amount of muscle and the trousers accentuated his long legs. Malfoy's hair....god lord, he no longer gelled it, allowing loose strands to fall onto his face gracefully. "Me too Ron," Harry sighed, "me too."
Pansy looked at him apologetically, "Oh come on, Draco, you know that was Finnigan, not me. Besides, don't worry we've upped the stakes a little bit more this time. Trust me, you're gonna have fun."
"N-no........." Ron stuttered as his blood ran cold, "it can't be... Ginny tell me I'm stuck in a nightmare..."
She and Ron scrambled to get under the clock just a millisecond before Harry made his way out of the bathroom. Wow, Ginny thought. He looked really good, really good. Turns out Harry had cleaned up well after the potions accident that afternoon. His messy hair was tousled and his green eyes were brighter than ever. Harry was dressed in his usual school uniform, white shirt, black trousers and the Gryffindor tie.
Harry blushed and looked away from him, then it hit him. "Adorable?" Harry questioned.
Madam Pomfrey turned to Draco expectantly. Draco finally gave in and sighed muttering, "Fine, fine, I'll comfort Potter."
"Are you still filled with my cum?" Draco purred, fucking Harry roughly with the plug and twisting and turning it inside Harry as Harry was crying out in pleasure. The plug was now charmed to vibrate as it thrust in and out of Harry's eager hole faster and faster.
"Alright everyone, settle down please," Hermione raised her voice atop the whistling, "let's carry on, shall we? Harry, spin the bottle and make sure it's a good one. I think you got the gist of the game."
"I like the sound of you saying my name, Harry," Draco said, "Harry, Harry, Harry, hmmm...I like the sound of 'Harry' too." Harry blushed and looked away.
"What?" Weasley questioned his head snapping up, "that's not what I-"
Draco stiffened behind Harry, unconsciously tightening his arms around Harry's body.
"Come on Harry it's almost dinner time. Let's go you must be starving, you missed lunch." Hermione informed him.
"Yes Ma'am," Nott saluted and strode over to Padma. Harry watched in shock as Padma undid Nott's trousers and his cock sprung free from his underwear. She tugged it at first and ran her hand over his length before licking the tip and wrapping her lips around his shaft, taking in his whole length. Nott moaned and fisted his hands in Padma's hair as she bobbed her head up and down his cock, sucking him thoroughly. Soon Nott's breathing had become more erratic and his moans were getting louder and more frequent. He managed to utter, "I'm gonna...I'm going to com-" before Padma pulled her mouth away and thick ropes of cum splattered across the common room floor. After everybody got over their initial shock, the whole group fell into applause as Padma bowed and took her seat back in the circle. Theo cast a cleaning charm on the floor, zipped his jeans up and winked at Padma as he sat down between Blaise and Zachariah.
Harry squeaked in protest but got up anyway, knowing he had to face the inevitable.
Malfoy smiled back at him although a bit sadly as though the reality of things had just caught up with him. "And you'll have to break up with the weaslette-uh I mean...Ginny," he corrected with much difficulty, "You'll have to break up with her first."
Draco smirked at Harry, staring into the pools of bright green, pushing Harry's fringe away from his forehead. Draco got lost in them and hadn't even realized that he had been staring. "Your eyes...." he said softly, "they're so green..."
Harry felt very bereft and empty without a thick plug filling him up. Draco however, was enjoying seeing Harry squirm as he still denied to give Harry what he truly wanted. His fingers prodded Harry's hole. He was indeed filled up with Draco's come from earlier as it started flowing out of Harry's hole and dripping down his thighs. Draco pushed two fingers in and start finger fucking Harry, gently as though to further aggravate Harry. Harry was fuming, he was so well prepared couldn't Draco see that? But no, Draco was doing this on purpose.
Snape sighed, obviously unfazed. "Draco, take Potter to Madam Pomfrey," he drawled in his usual monotonous voice.
Everyone turned to Pansy and Hermione who were both nodding, only Pansy seemed very delighted and entertained, in comparison to Hermione who was biting her bottom lip.
"It has not!" Ron countered, but his argument was feeble and he knew it. "I can't steal from Harry and it's an invasion of privacy."
"Gin," Ron whispered frowning, "Why is Harry in a Slytherin boys' room? And why is there only one bed?"
"Harry," Draco all but growled, "if you don't stop that now, I'm gonna come so deep inside you it'll never come out."
Draco put his face in his hands and groaned, "Oh no, what have you done?"
"Right then," Blaise spoke up, "now that we've all admitted to ogling Potter's delicious backside and wishing to have our cocks up his bum," Harry squeaked at this, "how about we actually see it happen?"
"You're not stealing from him, you're borrowing," Ginny said, "And I promise you we'll find out who she is and leave right after, trust me when I say I'm the last person who wants to watch my ex-boyfriend make out with another girl."
Harry looked around, his face scrunched in confusion. He could have sworn that he had heard someone in the dorm earlier. "Hello?" he called, to no response. Shrugging he went back to tugging at his hair, attempting to comb it out. Ginny and Ron let out a huge breath of relief from under the cloak.
Draco gritted his teeth, this was going to be hard. If Potter continues to bend over like that, shoving his perky butt further back into the air, Draco- or more so Draco's cock was going to have a problem.
"Rightfully so," was Weasley's response.
He could feel Malfoy tensing behind him, so he decided to ease the tension a bit. "It's alright Malfoy, it's just a dare." Harry spoke, turning his head back to look at Malfoy. "I know Potter," came Malfoy's reply. He gave Harry a small smile and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. Harry leaned back onto Malfoy, his back plastering across Malfoy's chest as Malfoy grasped Harry's hips and pulled him back, drawing him closer, his groin resting against Harry's arse. Harry shuddered as he felt Malfoy's warmth breath against his neck, his lips slightly graze Harry's ear. As Harry snuggled further into Malfoy's warmth, he felt strong arms wrapping around his body.
"As expected," Padma mumbled, "Alright Hermy, have you and Ron had anal sex?"
"Draco!" Pansy screeched from outside his door, "Hurry up, enough with the hair potions! We're gonna be late...again." She groaned.
After numerous failed attempts to try to get Harry to reveal his new girlfriend, Ginny and Ron turn to their last resort: Harry's invisibility cloak.
Harry grumbled, "I figured that out for mysel- ahhhhh!"
Dinner was unfortunately very eventful. As soon as Harry entered the Great Hall, he was met with cooing from most of the girls, who were mumbling to each other about how absolutely adorable Harry was.
"Precisely," Hermione stated, "You're not going anywhere. Remember the deal we made? I let you and Harry go watch The Montrose Magpies play against The Wimbourne Wasps last week when you clearly ought to be studying and in exchange you
"I like the sound of 'Draco' too..." he admitted softly, gazing once more into Draco's eyes, the grey a shade of molten silver.
Draco didn't want to put Harry down, but he did as he was told, gently placing Harry on one of the beds. When Draco started to leave however, Harry started whimpering.
"Heavens, what is the matter here, there's a huge crowd gathered outside the portrait as you lot have yet to move your limbs past the entrance. For goodness sakes.."
"Ehhhh I don't know, ummm I remember there was an accident in potions, the last thing I remember in the cauldron getting toppled over and......Oh no......" Harry's voice stuttered in fear and realization dawned on him.
"Alrighty, Justin," Harry began calmly unable to keep the smirk out of his voice. "Are you a top or a bottom?"
Almost everyone cheered, with the exceptions of Ginny and Ron. Hermione had a mischevious smile on her face.
Potter frowned hard at him, "What if I don't want to? You ought to give me a turn to tend to the potion too, Malfoy."
Harry wanted to cry, he was still painfully hard and whimpering. As if he thought having a pair of ears and a tail would be embarrassing enough but no, his body had to betray him in a way he never would have thought possible.
Hermione pried her eyes away from her Charms textbook with much difficulty to glance at Ron. "Oh, honestly Ronald! We've talked about this. Harry will tell us when he's ready."
"I think it's really cute actually," Ginny cooed.
"The whole male population here wants to fuck you, Potter," Draco glowered, "they won't be able to though, you're mine."
Harry looked pleadingly at Hermione, the only one of his friends who appeared to not have suffered severe nerve damage in the last few minutes. Hermione gave him a thin, yet reassuring smile as she got to her feet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ginny scowled at him and whispered in his ear, "It's about Harry...."
Just when Harry thought that he would fall asleep on the Gryffindor table, he noticed his underwear become wetter and wetter, an odd itching sensation spread across his body and his cock started to become achingly hard.
Harry smiled at him genuinely. "Works for me, although you might have to ask me to dinner first."
"Oh come on, Draco! I know your hearing is perfectly fine, and don't give me that look!" Blaise scoffed, "You know you wanna fuck Potter! Hell, you wouldn't shut up about him for months. You two were having so much fun, we just wanna push it to the next level."
Clearing his throat Draco dropped off the vial of rat's blood next to Potter's cutting knife and grabbed the stirring rod out of Potter's hands. "Go chop up the earthworms Potter, I'll deal with this."
Harry sucked in a breath. Oh no...he couldn't...he'd rather eat Ginny out, Ginny can't find out how he really feels when they have sex, it would crush her, oh no...
Draco huffed before kissing Harry's cheek, muttering a goodnight and turning the lights off with another wandless spell, leaving Ron and Ginny in the darkness.
"Truth or Dare, Harry? We've already started in case you didn't notice."
"Everyone else, back to work," Snape called making his way to the front desk.
"Do it," Harry said hoarsely. "I want you to come inside me. I need your come filling my arse."
Hey! New chapter! Hope you guys like it!!! Don't worry there will be smexxy times in the next chapter for all u pervs! Turns out Ginny and Ron aren't as innocent as u think.
Hey u guys! The worst thing happened to me whilst writing this. About half of the work got deleted and I had to write it again. I cant tell u how mad I got. Anyway, there will be another chapter filled with Ginny and Ron's reactions and Harry finally coming out to his friends and revealing his relationship with Draco. The next chapter will pick off exactly where this one ends, with Ron and Ginny and their whole output on the situation. Also let me know what you think because this is my first time writing smut and I'd appreciate some constructive criticism. Happy reading!
"Ron," Terry began softly, "it's okay to not know everything about your best mate, in fact I believe Harry's just starting to figure it out himself." Terry darted a glance at Harry who was still snuggled inside Draco's warm embrace.
*************** 3 months later*****************
Harry patted his knee apologetically. "There we go," Harry said, "wasn't so hard, was it?"
Ginny shut her eyes tight, taking a deep breath now that it had been confirmed. Ron's jaw had dropped to the floor, he looked as though he's gotten petrified by the basilisk.
So here he was, crouching against the wall, with a painfully hard erection. He had realized that the wetness in his pants was from his hole producing slick, but he couldn't understand what was happening to him. He had a sudden urge to shove his fingers in his arse, but no matter how many fingers he could cram up there it wouldn't be enough. He came repeatedly to the thought of a thick cock pounding into him, but no matter how much he came, it still wasn't enough.
Malfoy huffed and rolled his eyes, "You are such a child, Potter. If we were to ever get married, you're taking my last name."
"Draco..." Harry cried, his fingers tightening in Draco's blond hair, "what was that? Oooohh there...right there!"
Dean grinned maliciously, "Okay loverboy, have you and Ginny had sex yet?"
Harry swallowed, his lips trembling in fear of what's to come. "What happened this time?" he asked his voice barely a whisper.
After about ten more minutes or so of working in uncomfortable silence. Malfoy suddenly cursed. "Bollocks, Potter you completely forgot to get the rat's blood. Can't you do anything right for once?" He looked over to Harry, who just sat there blinking.
Harry cringed, he really needed to talk to Ginny and tell her that he isn't interested. "Errrrr thanks, Gin....."
Weasley who was kneeling on the floor trying to wake Potter up snapped, "This is all your fault, Malfoy!"
"You alright?" Draco asked. "Mmm hmmm," Harry replied, "Now can you fuck me?"
Harry felt Draco's hot sticky come splattering inside him, coating his sensitive walls and was soon tipped over the edge his own orgasm approaching. Harry came with a cry of
"I'll be back with a few potions for him to take when he wakes up." With that, she was gone, making her way to the potions cupboard.
"I'm gonna fuck you, you cute little bunny..." Draco purred, "Gonna have my way with your pretty arse."
"Oh, would you shut your pompous mouth and let me speak for once? Dobby had also said that Harry is likely to leave at eight-thirty which is fifteen minutes from now," she confirmed with a quick tempus. "So what we have to do is get Harry's invisibility cloak and follow him when he goes to meet her, then we'll finally know who she is."
"And you have a bunny tail," Hermione added helpfully.
"Madam Pomfrey told me this would happen," he told Harry patiently. "You're a magical creature now. You need to mate, hence why you're producing slick, you're in heat."
"Harry? HARRY?" he was brought out of his stupor by Dean's voice echoing through the room.
"Go away Ginny, I'm trying to eat in peace," Ron grumbled with a mouthful of potatoes.
Terry smiled, a bit sadly, "there's nothing wrong with bottoming, or 'taking it up the arse'. I do prefer to top, but I've had cock up my bum multiple times and it's nothing short of mindblowing sex."
The whole room fell silent, eerily silent. Harry couldn't bear to see the look on Ginny's face. Where had all his Gryffindor courage gone? He heard her draw in a sharp breath as she removed herself from Harry's lap and went to sit next to Luna, burying her face in Luna's shoulder. Harry couldn't bear it, he knew she was crying from the soft sobbing which broke through the silence. Malfoy was staring at him, his brows furrowed and eyes unblinking. Harry tore away from his gaze to look at Hermione who started to soothingly rub his back, whispering words of comfort into his ear. Ron was on the verge of laughing at sister being so terrible at sex, or scolding his best mate for making Ginny cry.
Ginny was still sniffling into Luna's shoulder refusing to look up and Hermione started to comfort Ron, rubbing his back as Ron reluctantly sat down next to Seamus.
Harry's eyes shot up at that and Draco wanted to kiss his adorable big green eyes. So he settled for kissing Harry on the lips instead. He tilted Harry's chin up and leaned forward, allowing Harry to move away if he wanted to. Harry, however, did no such thing. Their lips met, softly at first, nothing more than a peck. Harry then immediately threw his arms around Draco's neck pulling him closer and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. Harry relaxed into the kiss, allowing Draco's prodding tongue to enter his mouth. Soon they were snogging passionately, Harry submitting into the kiss, with Draco's tongue exploring every inch of his mouth. Draco pulled Harry up from the floor, clutching on to him even tighter. Harry moaned into his mouth as Draco's hands wandered down to his arse, squeezing Harry's perky bubble butt.
"I have no idea," Ginny said, confusion etching her features, "maybe Harry doesn't know the password to the girls' dorms or he's afraid of getting caught and this just happened to be a spare room with a single bed............"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry sighed. Here he was again in double potions, being paired up with Draco Malfoy; of course, courtesy of Severus Snape As if things didn't turn out horribly the last time. They had both gotten drowsed in an itching potion which had left them scratching like animals for a week. Needless to say, they most certainly did not work well together at all. Had Snape not understood that? But of course he did; this was Snape's way of torturing Harry. For what reasons Harry may never find out. After Snape's true intentions were revealed during the war, Harry had dared to hope that things may be different between him and the infamous potion's master going forth. Harry had never been more wrong.
Draco continued to grope Harry's bottom, muttering between kisses, "You've got the perkiest bubble butt in all of Hogwarts, you know that? You need to stop shoving that pert arse into the air."
Draco climbed into the bed beside Harry and pulled a trembling Harry into his arms. Harry immediately stopped whimpering and snuggled into Draco's chest, falling asleep soundly sprawled across Draco.
"Harry I hope you know that I'm not mad at you for breaking up with my sister. To this day neither you nor she would tell me what happened between the two of you." Ron said gently. "I admit I did want you two to get married, hell you're my best mate Harry! I wanted us to legally be family. But I see how incredibly happy you've been recently. Truth be told, I was so worried about you after the war. It pained me to see how broken you looked and that's when I realized that it would no longer work with you and Ginny. You both deserve better. You'll always be a part of the Weasley family mate, we don't need a piece of paper to know that."
"Ronald, what do you think you're doing?" Hermione questioned, towering over him. "Ummm I-uh," Ron stuttered, his eyes darting across the room.
Ginny was feeling very indifferent. Harry had clearly moved on by now. He hadn't told anyone about his new girlfriend, although he truly didn't have to. Anyone could see how his eyes were shining with life or the small smiles his lips would curve into from time to time, when presumably he thought no one was looking.
to grab Potter, push him up against the counter and snog him senseless, did he speak.
Draco emerges, child in tow. Defensive. “Look, before you –”
The usual anxiety began to well up inside him, making his head spin. Gasping for breath, his legs carried him over to the wall, where he closed his eyes, pressing his forehead and his palms against the bare plaster. God, this was a bad one. He could even hear the distant crackling of Fiendfyre, straight out of his nightmares, as he tried to focus on his breathing.
. “I’m still convinced that I’ll be laughed out of town. Or hexed.” Draco turned to Potter. “You know,” he murmured sotto voce, “opening this place was all Neville’s idea, so any harm that comes to me is on his head.”
The addition of the ‘ex’, he thought, biting into his toast with great relish, was definitely a step forward.

Harry traced his finger down to the top of Draco’s collar. With a whispered
“Oh yes,” said Professor Sprout, proudly. “He’s excellent. ‘Course, it doesn’t matter if you’re a wizard or not, green fingers run in the Sprout family.”
“Merlin, I love her,” said Potter, as they traipsed out front like a bunch of naughty schoolkids. “I wish she’d been at Hogwarts with us. I can’t believe you’ve hired a teenager even brattier than you were. I mean, you’re her actual boss, and even
happening – almost every day, in fact. As soon as Lofts popped out of their shared office for any reason, Malfoy would appear. He spoke a little too loudly, and smiled a lot, and skilfully managed to maintain a stream of inane chatter without pause whilst hunting high and low through the office for any goodies on offer. But the strangest thing of all – the thing that Harry could never in a million years have anticipated – was just how
“Look, I was trapped at the Manor, okay?” Draco said, scowling. “Day in, day out, for two years. Howlers coming every day, reading the
Harry steps forward. “You want me.”
Harry snorted, relieved. “Merlin, Leonie. I don’t half miss that little hellraiser.”

this place. I can’t go in the bathroom – there are probably potions in there, and I bet there’s booze in the kitchen, and drinks cabinets, and… I just… I can’t. Not while I’m feeling like this.”
Draco rolled his eyes, still more than a little self-conscious. “Well, when you look at it now, do you still remember what happened last year?”
“Draco.” Harry’s voice is steady and sure. “There’s no-one else. I’ve tried, believe me, but it’s true. And I think maybe it’s time to stop trying.”
“Right,” said Harry slowly, watching the young woman’s back as she stomped off in a huff. “Bit young for you though, isn’t she? Can’t be more than, what, eighteen? I mean, personally, I draw the line at dating people who don’t even remember the war, but―”
“Ha. You’ll have to take that up with Leonie. She’s convinced that this is going to be our big moneymaker.”
It was a facsimile of a life. A lovely, gilded facsimile, most of the time, like an enhanced version of reality. It wasn’t far off the life he had enjoyed growing up, where it had seemed as though everyone around Draco existed exclusively to make him happy. But occasionally, this imitation Draco living in his imitation world found himself doing things which deep down he knew his real counterpart would have balked at.

“Mmm. Hey, Draco,” Harry said softly, “tell me something. Do you remember the day I came round and you took me into your lab, right after that curse had taken a bloody great chunk out of my thigh?”
“I guess we can agree we were both young and stupid, then?”
, always besting him at everything – and for the first time, Draco’s certainty had begun to waver. But he consoled himself with thoughts of everything he had that Potter lacked: parents who adored him, an enormous family home (
Draco’s heavy woollen robes flew up from the bottom of the pile and straight into Harry’s waiting hand, hats and coats toppling over to litter the dirty floor indiscriminately. Harry handed the cloak to Draco, who stared at him in surprise.
“Half our suppliers have dropped us, the other half want more money, there have been complaints about the quality of our ingredients – one person even wrote in to the
As expected, his mother didn’t bat an eyelid when Draco caught her on the way out to the garden and told her of his plans – she made some vaguely positive noises about his ‘using his time productively’ and that was that. Equally predictably, the Ministry was unable to fabricate an excuse to deny Draco the chance to study for his Diploma, and he was gratified when, at the end of Collins’ next visit, he reluctantly performed an expansion charm on the lab. So excited was Draco by the success of his scheme, he had to work hard to keep his face neutral when Collins threw him a cursory “don’t even think of getting up to any funny business, all right?” on the way out.
He leaned out into the rain and hissed, “Potter. Can’t you please just leave me alone?”
Neville pursed his lips, making an indecisive humming noise, and Draco leant forward to rest a hand on his arm. “Come on then, what’s bothering you?”
Malfoy ignored him. “Look, you remember Wood, yes? Oliver Wood?
There was a chime as the door opened behind him, and he whirled around in surprise. “I’m afraid we’re not actually o…”
As Draco half-listened to her chattering away – his headache returning with a vengeance – he found himself growing more and more irritated by her blatant self-centredness. She’d ignored him for over a year, off swanning around Europe with her new friends, knowing that he was miserable at home, and now she wanted to pretend that nothing had changed? Blathering on as though he was desperate to hear about her passionate tryst with a minor Swedish royal, or how she was landscaping the roof garden at her Chelsea townhouse?

His voice cracked on the last word, and he pulled back sharply, turning on his heel and storming away once more. Barely-contained magic crackled in his wake, the
All at once, the telltale whoosh of a Bludger sounded from below, clipping the tail of Harry’s broom and forcing them both to throw themselves backwards. Adrenaline flooded Harry’s body as he clung to his spinning broom for dear life, trying to regain control over its movements. Suddenly, a firm hand settled on the handle, pulling him forwards and bringing him abruptly to a stop. Harry could feel the heat from Malfoy’s body, and, on wiping his glasses, found himself mere inches from a pair of concerned grey eyes. They were both still breathing fast; Malfoy’s soft pants ghosting over his cheek. His heart was pounding so loudly in his ears that he feared Malfoy might hear it over the faint whistle of the wind, and all at once he found that he could stand the proximity no longer.
“Do you…?” Harry spun around, indignant. “You’re the one who numbed my muscles with your cowboy superpowers and then practically massaged me into a coma. We’ve been flying for nearly nineteen hours now – I’d like to see

They sat back down, Harry immediately picking up his Omnioculars to follow the action. But Draco was itchy, restless – no longer content to sit silently beside Harry. He spent the rest of the match debating with himself whether he should try to strike up another conversation, even ask Harry out for a drink again. And then, all at once, it was over – yet another defeat for the Cannons, although Harry cheered loudly when it was announced that Ginny Weasley had won Player of the Match. Draco turned away to gather his things, trying to hide the way a thin thread of jealousy tugged at his chest, when to his surprise, Harry tapped him on the arm.
“Malfoy, you know
“Right,” Draco said, faintly. His whisky-soaked brain felt sluggish, not used to conversations unassisted by

that noise? It sounded like it originated from behind the armchair, but it was hard to tell. Draco leant forward, moving with difficulty to his knees, to look around the room. This seemed to increase the feeling of pressure in his skull, as though he’d been holding his breath too long and was close to passing out. He pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes.
Caught offguard, Draco’s eyelids flickered open, and he found himself staring deep into Harry’s eyes. They were the same eyes, of course, which had occupied his mind and haunted his dreams since that awful
“Mmm. Shall we go?”
“As I was about to say, there’s even room for a little table and chairs. Picture sitting out of an evening, you and –” he glances quickly at Harry’s ring finger “– a friend, sharing a bottle of red…”
“Nothing. Nothing.”
wandless; my healing spells are shit at the best of times, and by the time I got to St Mungo’s, all they could do was patch me up. Told me it’s going to take two weeks to heal properly, and I’m off field work until it’s sorted. It’s all right, that’ll give them time to find me a new bloody partner, at least that’s what I said to Robards…” His frown deepened as he caught sight of Draco’s face. “What?”
One long, painful, silent minute later, Harry shook his head as if to clear it. He walked across the room, gathering up his clothes and shoes haphazardly in his arms, before turning back to Draco. His bloodshot eyes sparkled in the dim light.
“What do you mean?”
A quiet huff of laughter. Harry brings their joined hands to his mouth, kissing the tips of Draco’s fingers one by one. “To be fair, it took me three months. And the Ministry don’t quite share my level of… motivation. It was a trace – barely even that – of your magic at the Portkey station in Naples. That was all I could find.”
“Merlin, Potter,” said Malfoy slowly, rubbing his eyes. “Let a guy wake up first, why don’t you?”
Malfoy shifted on his broom, clearing his throat. “Your cakes, Potter,” he said, with a forced-sounding chuckle. “Obviously I’m talking about your cakes.”
“Possibly because you’re an obnoxious little shit when you’re
“Spent three months undercover there. Some rich arsehole trying to raise an army of ancient spirits, yadda yadda. It was a long, boring job, and I had to pass the time somehow, didn’t I?

– was long forgotten. Things were going far too well for that. It had been his childhood dream to own an apothecary – a dream he’d thought he had given up for good. It just wasn’t worth taking any risks; and besides, why on earth would he want to share his good fortune?

“Well,” said Malfoy, looking slightly shifty, Harry thought, “they asked me to help set up the new Field Division, for starters. Offered me a pay raise too. And, well,” he looked at Harry slyly, “I suppose you could say that at MACUSA, there wasn’t as much temptation in the next office over.”
“―flying,” Harry finished for him, blinking slowly.
Draco frowned. “My what? What do pigs have to do with my salve?”

“Surprised you know what a haircut is, Potter,” Draco shot back, before he could help himself. He was unsure whether the insult was borne out of habit or
“I’ll say,” replied Draco, stretching languorously and reaching for another cherry, biting it sharply off the stem. Harry knelt next to him, bringing a delicate foot to his lips. “That blouse was… mmm… Gucci. Bloody philistine.” He threw his head back as Harry ran the tip of his tongue over the bones of his ankle.
had successfully pushed all guilt out of Draco’s mind. He headed back down to the shop, lost in plans for potion orders and well on his way to forgetting about the whole unpleasant incident. But as he rounded the corner at the bottom of the stairs, he bumped straight into Lee. Her arms were folded; her expression like thunder.
Ron turned his head in such a haste that he might have popped a vein in his neck. Ginny smirked at him. "Knew that would get your attention,"
"Harry, you're gonna have to stop squeezing my cock with that arse," Draco managed to croak out. Harry, of course, gave no indication whatsoever to have heard him.
"Hmmmm you were saying, Harry?" Draco kissed his nose looking affectionately at the Gryffindor in his arms. "You're so goddamn adorable!"
"Love what, Harry?" Draco egged on. "I love hav-having your cock in my arse! Please fu-fuck me, please!" Harry cried out. Draco, very obviously pleased with Harry's reply, resumed thrusting in and out of Harry's arse, grabbing onto Harry's hips and trailing kisses down his back. He grasped Harry's chin and turned Harry's face, catching Harry's lips in a hungry kiss. Harry moaned into Draco's mouth.
This apparently allowed Ron's central nervous system to start functioning again.
Harry looked at him with glassy eyes and tackled him with a bear hug. "Thanks, Ron. You have no idea how much that means to me." Ron tightened his grip on Harry's back. Once they broke apart, Harry gave him a genuine smile whilst clutching Ron's shoulders.
Harry being the gentleman that he is had apologized to her during breakfast the very next day after she kicked him out of her room. That didn't mean that it didn't hurt. Ginny knows she has to move on, and that's exactly what she'll do. Starting with finding out who Harry's mystery girlfriend is. No one seems to know. Not even Ron and Hermione. But Ginny was going to find out.
"Well well, what do we have here?" Draco mused. "Is this the same plug from this morning, Harry? Have you been walking around plugged up all day after I fucked you in the alcove just before transfiguration?" Harry moaned as the plug moved inside him, grazing his sensitive walls.
Harry picked up his potions and unintentionally made eye contact with him, and stood there staring for a few moments and gave Draco a curt nod, before following his friends out of the infirmary.
At that, the whole common room fell silent as everyone's gaze made its way to Dean. Dean grinned sheepishly, wondering if he'd been that loud. Harry was blushing violently, opting to snuggle into Draco's chest and never crawl out of his lap. Ron lookedas though he was ready to faint.
Dean started smirking, having overheard, "there you go, maybe this won't be so bad after all. Just saying, Harry has a really nice arse, Malfoy's pretty lucky."
Harry's eyes flew open in shock and he startled, trying to get up from the table. Both Hermione and Ron looked at him worriedly, "Harry, are you okay?" Hermione asked softly, worry tinging her voice, "What's wrong?"
"Appears so that since the potion wasn't completed, Mister Potter has gained a few new appendages. Good news is that he'll be back to normal after a week." She confirmed happily.
Harry obeyed and rolled over, getting up oh his hands and knees. Draco moaned as Harry pushed his arse into the air, displaying his arse to Draco. Draco began to knead the globes of Harry's cute little butt, fondling it and doing his best to fight the urge of fucking Harry right then and there. That's when he noticed the small black stud that was settled deep between Harry's cheeks. Draco gasped as his fingers grasped on to the base of the plug in Harry's hole. Once Draco started wriggling the plug, and it pressed up against Harry's prostate, Harry lost his upper body strength and his arms fell onto the bed, his face resting on the soft pillow. Harry unconsciously thrust his arse back onto Draco's fingers.
"You may want to see for yourself," said Ron shifting uncomfortably.
Draco swallowed. He had always thought that Potter had the finest arse in all of Hogwarts. Merlin, the way Potter would lean forward whilst trying to catch the snitch, displaying his bum for all of Draco's glory. Draco longed to grope Potter's cute bubble butt, some of his fantasies went as far as to pondering what Potter's arse would look like wrapped around his cock. Speaking of, which seemed to be getting a sudden rush of blood flow after witnessing the conspicuous curve of Potter's arse.
What he didn't notice was that Draco Malfoy who had just exited the Headmistress's office, was looking in bewilderment at the retreating form of Harry, and without much thought, Draco began to follow him towards their common room.
"Indeed," Harry agreed, hands against the wall, smiling and looking over at Draco who proceeded to capture their lips much more sweetly than before.
At this point the only sounds that could be heard were constant moaning and the sound of skin slapping against skin.
“No, it’s not… it’s not that,” Theo got out, shuffling right to the end of the bed. He was looking down at the floor. “It’s – well, I’ve just started seeing someone.”
Afterwards, Harry slumped forwards, resting his cheek against Draco’s chest, damp hair tickling at Draco’s chin. Harry’s come was still tacky on Draco’s stomach, and that crazy urge to laugh resurfaced once more, but he swallowed it down, settled for trailing his fingers along the curve of Harry’s spine, enjoying the slow, languorous shift of Harry’s muscles as he stretched contentedly underneath Draco’s palm.
too hard. There’s no time to rectify that, though, as the force of the spell blasts the tray right onto the tiles with a metallic clang, at the exact same moment that the pile of smiley faces erupts into an inferno of waist-high flames. Harry jumps backwards away from the searing heat, panic rising as the fire begins to lick at the counter top, emitting clouds of acrid-smelling black smoke. Suddenly, a single warning

“Draco!” Harry’s voice was deliberately loud as he stepped deftly between the two men, grinning at Draco. “Glad you could make it!” He turned to Collins. “I’m so sorry, Mr…?”
“Er,” said Harry, cleverly.
But no sooner had he swallowed, shuddering as energy began to return to his exhausted body, than the roar of the Floo sounded unexpectedly from outside. Guiltily, he hurried out into the bedroom, where he was met by the sight of Harry Potter’s head, twisting hither and thither as he searched for Draco from within the flames.
“Anyway Potter, as I told you in my letter, I’m very grateful―”
Draco summoned the mental strength Aunt Bella had beaten into him during his Occlumency training, forcing himself to stop, step back, and lean casually against the front of his counter.
“It was shitty. But it’s alright,” Draco repeats. He clears his throat. “I forgive you, Harry Potter,” he says, in a mock-grave voice. His eyes are alight with mischief, and Harry’s heart leaps into his throat as a hand settles lightly over his own. “There. Feel better now?”
“Don’t be. She’s much happier now. We both are, really.”
“No problem.”
Neville stood back up and looked at him. “So…” he began.
Potter leaned slowly to the left, taking his weight off the chair arm and letting his injured thigh rest down on the seat. He sat back, without attempting to pull his trousers up. His legs were still pressed close together. Draco swallowed. He should definitely move. He should
Mouth full, Draco gestured at his surroundings. “Not a lot.”
Pansy snorted, recasting the warming charm which covered them all, and sat forward. She took a long sip of her cocktail through its straw, before counting on her fingers for emphasis. “Okay. One: he could easily have told you to bugger off when he first saw you. In fact, Draco – and don’t take this personally – I was absolutely certain he would. We both were, actually.” Lee nodded her agreement, and Draco let out a squeak of protest. Pansy roundly ignored him. “
writes about it – I mean, wasn’t there literally an article about him having a cold last week? The girl must have known it was a risk. It was only a first date, they’ll write about it and they’ll move on – probably to his latest hair disaster, or something like that. What’s the problem?”
“Bloody awful. There was this one Saturday, right before we played you in third year, he had us flying for seven hours straight.” Harry chuckled. “God, I was so sore afterwards, I could barely…” Harry paused, a nasty realisation washing over him. “Oh. Oh shit.”

“Should you?! I don’t know. I suppose it might be too much to expect you to recognise every kid you and your cronies tortured at school. Let’s see.

“And what about food? Does he eat?” Hermione cast a wary eye over Malfoy, who was gazing fondly into the distance, fingers at eye level as he cupped the cheek of his imaginary dance partner. He was unpleasantly thin, she thought, eyeing the way the knob of his wrist jutted out from under his sleeve. His cheeks were hollow, the line of his jaw even sharper than usual, his stomach practically concave.
“They gave up their ancestral seat in Parliament in the 18
? That might be taking it a little far.
“Fine.” He leant in to press one more quick kiss to Harry’s lips before pulling back to grab his hand, lacing their fingers together and tugging him towards the nearest Floo. Harry stumbled along behind him, awkwardly trying to adjust himself in his trousers, struggling to keep up with Draco’s relentless pace.
“We don’t have any other choice!”
Draco looked down, self-conscious. Merlin, Gryffindors didn’t half go on. If Pansy were here, she’d have jabbed him in the arm and told him to stop feeling so bloody sorry for himself. Which would have been much easier than having to listen to Neville wax philosophical about

By the time the clock ticked round to eight – the normal time that Draco would take his evening dose – he felt as though
Draco hummed, bit the nape of Harry’s neck gently, thinking.
Harry didn’t speak again. Draco felt a trance-like detachment. He hardly noticed Harry drying him off, casting a breath freshening charm, helping him back to bed, or tucking him in. But as he burrowed his head deeper into the pillow, fresh sheets cool against his body and the tube in his arm connected once more to some unknown Muggle concoction, he felt strangely at peace. He’d been off potions for two days already. He wasn’t in Azkaban. He hadn’t died.
“Oh, well,” said Harry, still grinning, “if you
Draco groaned. “Why do you have to do that?”

Potter shrugged. “Only for precision work. Easier without, for most things. More powerful, too, these days.” He smiled sheepishly at Draco. Silence fell once more.
Worse was to come – poor Vince, hapless to the last; Voldemort defeated, and his father, half-crazed, muttering under his breath:
had coerced this stranger into propositioning him. But pushing those disturbing thoughts aside, even in his current state, Draco knew for certain that letting someone wank you off in the back of a club and then buggering off without reciprocating was not okay. No, Draco was going to make damn sure that the man at least enjoyed himself, he thought, as he sank to his knees on the sticky floor.

When Harry finished, he sat back, patting his stomach, eyeing Draco’s full plate warily.

So engrossed was he in these wonderful new sensations that he hardly even noticed his legs carrying him towards the stairs and into his bedroom. When next his vision cleared, he was standing in front of his writing desk. Draco had often fantasised about the day he would finally get to sample his

“You can’t, not really,” she said, plainly. “Only time will tell. I do trust Harry’s judgement though, and he seems pretty sure about you. And I suppose taking on Leonie must be a step in the right direction.” She smiled at him, gesturing towards the door. “Now, I have to get back to the Ministry, but Harry said that you could do with a hand to set up Leonie’s pay? We can drop into Gringotts together, if you like.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Lee’s head poke curiously out of the lab. He Apparated himself and Theo upstairs into his bedroom just as packets of herbs began raining down all around them, and dragged Theo over towards the bed. But as they stumbled across his bedroom, Draco started to feel uncomfortable. Sure, it felt
“Charmed,” said Draco politely, taking a seat. Lila was all angles, her hair thin, her skin scarred and pitted, and although Draco had assumed her to be elderly at a distance, as he looked closer he realised she could probably have been any age from forty to eighty. Her close-set eyes narrowed with suspicion as Draco extended his hand – a look all too familiar since Draco had given up the
“What happens now?” asked Draco, unsteady voice breaking the silence.
Spotting him should have been easy in the half-deserted stand, and when Draco’s eyes failed to discern that familiar form, his heart began to sink. But he dutifully walked down to Row B anyway, peering down the bench. First sat a father and son, ridiculous in cannon-shaped hats which regularly huffed out orange balls of smoke. Next, a young couple, hand-in-hand, a wind-swept pygmy puff poking its head up from inside her coat – then – then an old wizard, beard down to his waist, eating a foot-long hot dog…
Lee was initially nowhere to be seen, and Draco was wondering if she was here at all by the time he finally spotted her, lurking over in a shadowed corner behind the orchestra. She was dressed in a crimson Muggle evening gown, worn off the shoulder, her wild, tangled mane tamed for once into shining ringlets, which cascaded softly down her back. A young wizard with curly brown hair was leaning down to talk to her, and as Draco watched, she laughed and leant into him, resting a casual hand on his bicep in possibly the most blatant display of flirting Draco had ever witnessed.
“That’s… that’s really great.” He smiled, tightly. “So you must be nearly ready, then.”

. An angry wind followed him, swirling through the garden; Draco could just make out the shocked cries of the guests over the sudden cacophonous rustling of leaves. He watched as Harry muttered something to Ron, hardly breaking his stride, before disappearing back into the house. Ron looked straight over at Draco, followed by Hermione, then Hannah. Slowly, as the gale subsided, more and more heads turned until, before Draco knew it, the entire crowd was staring at him. He could hear their confused murmurs rising in volume as he desperately fumbled for his wand. Hannah’s pitiful expression was the last thing he saw as he spun on the spot, vanishing – far too late – into blissful nothingness.
as his body shudders and stills.
He rather regretted raising the subject in the end, as he found himself embroiled in a tedious discussion about the minutiae of the Manor gardens with Professor Sprout and an awkwardly grateful Bryn, which went on for what felt like hours before he finally managed to extricate himself and catch up with Lee. She was deep in conversation with Luna Lovegood and a group of other Wizarding-Adjacents, and she looked at him desperately as he slotted in next to her, giving her arm a squeeze.
“…nothing,” Harry finished. “Three months is nothing.”
To his shame, Draco spent the night overcome by a violent, all-consuming desire for
mass of people surrounding him – this was too much. Too overwhelming. The bassline resonated through his body the way his own pounding heart regularly dragged him, screaming, out of sleep.
Self-conscious, he looked at Potter, who was staring down at him with a glazed look, lips slightly parted. Draco cleared his throat.

Hardly anything phased Hermione, these days: pragmatism came with the territory. Last week, a man had been brought into her department, splinched from left nipple to navel. Her clever hands had slipped through the blood pouring from his ruptured spleen as she tried desperately to stem the flow; small bowel forcing its way out of the gaping wound as he retched and moaned. She’d watched his knackered heart beat its last then, and felt next to nothing – but this? Bile rose, unbidden, in her throat at the image of her former schoolmate looking up, teeth black with mud, that absurd, vacant smile still plastered across his face.
His robes were a royal blue, different shades woven through to produce a slight iridescence, the effect heightened with a clever charm. They were traditional robes with no fastenings, but cut tight to his chest in a modern style. The high collar featured a delicate gold design, with two thin lines of gold trim running downward to Draco’s waist, where the blue fabric opened up into a split, revealing golden silk underneath. More golden embroidery shimmered from his wrists, snakelike patterns winding their way around his arms up to the back of his shoulder blades. Although the original fabric was heavy and crisp, the robes had been imbued with a lightening charm, and moved smoothly with Draco’s body, emitting barely a rustle. Over the last couple of weeks – always finding himself too busy to eat – Draco had lost some weight, and he’d briefly wondered if he might look awkward, or scrawny, underneath the expensive fabric. But no – he moved gracefully, tall and slender, filling out the flattering cut nicely. The whole effect was dazzling, and Draco couldn’t even pretend to regret the many Galleons he’d spent.
hard work. It was sad, really – barely an hour in a room together and it was as though they’d never been friends.
“Listen,” Harry begins, going on instinct. He’s not quite sure what he’s doing, but hell if it doesn’t feel bloody fantastic to be here, sitting next to Draco again. “I’m glad I saw you today. You look – you look really good, Draco.”
. And it was crystal clear that people

was a temporary measure, after all. Perhaps things had gone too far. Better to end it now, his most recent transgression fresh in his mind, than wait for another shameful incident to occur. And it would have to be cold turkey. That was the only way Draco could think of to be sure.
Bizarrely, he had enjoyed his afternoon with Longbottom – no,
“Nice haircut, Malfoy.”
“She’s falling asleep again, Max.”
“Harry’s date. It was this guy Will – he’s a junior Healer. Seemed like a really nice guy too, but it’s just…”
Lee held up her hand. “And…?”
Harry does.
Despite the t-shirt he’d hastily pulled on over his pyjama bottoms, Draco felt strangely naked without his wand as he padded barefoot down the hall. He wasn’t sure why he was so apprehensive. An intruder was hardly likely to light a fire and sit down at the kitchen table, after all.
Draco frowned, wanting to object, but Harry waved him away.
“It… it wasn’t your fault, all this. You know it wasn’t.”
“Ugh. Bad luck,” he said, wrinkling his nose. “Fitting end to a crappy day, I suppose. Although…”
. And Draco had squirmed and laughed and said
“D’you know, as it happens, Bryn, I think I might have just the job for you.”
. She’s got a whole
“Oh, fuck off, Potter. Take all that sanctimonious shit and get lost, won’t you? This whiny little prick is Death Eater scum, and he deserves everything he gets.”
Afternoon, now, and you’re following once more as they stroll hand in hand through the narrow streets, out to the quiet end of the beach. Harry casts a Disillusionment and you sit next to them on the sand, listening to their low voices as they talk for long minutes, saying almost nothing. You watch intently for the moment the charm will flicker, the moment when you might catch a glimpse of Harry’s soft expression, might watch him guide your younger self gently down onto the warm sand.
“Darling,” Harry says; helpless, imploring.
Draco paused, trying to collect his thoughts. Being well enough to wander around the flat in his pyjamas, making toast the Muggle way and taking long, relaxing baths was one thing. Running a business and dealing with the general public, without
Hello?” Harry’s voice grew louder and more impatient by the second. “
But Draco had determined to go through with it – and so he waited, and he waited, until eventually he managed to slip into the room unnoticed, hiding behind a group of chattering witches wearing jewel-tone robes. His nebulous plan – if it existed at all – was to keep his head down, his back against the wall, and stick with people he knew.
