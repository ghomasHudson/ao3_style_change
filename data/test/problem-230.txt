“Wash? Sweep? You’re kidding, right?” Draco’d never had to so much as brush lint off his clothes before. He had no clue even how to go about it.
Returning to his rooms, he took a long bath, then dressed in the second set of robes his mother had prepared for him, and managed to be finished just in time to go down to the ball. If he hadn’t had a chance of seeing Harry there, he’d likely have run for the stables and out into the fields around the town, and away from all the leering looks and simpering maidens. He wasn’t sure if he’d be able to stand it a third time.
Draco blinked, unsure what to say. He hardly wanted to speak ill of his father, but he knew Lucius held few limits when it came to his own power. But what if Potter told the MLE, and they used it against him in court?
Draco blinked at him. “What kind of question is that? It’s sex, Potter. I’m sure you understand the point of sex?”
Draco nodded, then sighed, letting out a small puff of smoke and nodded again. He’d go. But only halfway. Just out of sight of the gate. He didn’t want to scare people, after all.
Obviously, Blaise was going to have to be repaid with a Baronetcy. Perhaps even a Duchy, Draco thought to himself as he tangled with Harry on the soft, wide bed, their fingers and limbs entangling.
The full party did not arrive for almost another hour, and by that time, one of his father’s guards had joined him, as had Weasley. Draco’d tried to engage his father’s guard in talk, but the man seemed so bewildered to be talking to his prince that Draco finally gave up. Instead, he talked with Weasley, who seemed bemused at Draco’s interaction with the guard, but asked no questions.
“Is that possible?” The last had accidentally fallen down the stairs leading up to the throne room, and had needed to stay on an extra week to watch for head injuries.
But Harry kept going, as though one exclamation of horror hadn't been enough. “And I snuck into your bed? Why would I do that?”
And only we are left to witness Harry's face crumple. He stays alone in the living room for a very long time.
After a rather annoying breakfast, Draco went out with his broom, hoping to distract himself. It was great—right up until Potter caught up with him. “Still no training?” he asked him dully.
“Ow…” Draco wrinkled his nose, hand going to his hair before he could stop the gesture, rubbing at his scalp in empathy. “That must have hurt.”
Moreover, someone who could convince his aunt he might be worth saving. That was a job all on its own. Unless they knew her well. She was much too much like his mother--Black pigheadedness which wouldn't let them believe anything other than what they already believed.
"The headache is only a side-effect of the spell, Potter. Once it's broken, it won't be able to have any effect on you any longer."
"Very well. Dismissed. We'll consider this dealt with, then, Severus. Do come up and try some of this soup. It's lovely."
She sighed. “Fine. I’ll see if there are any possible candidates left. But…I don’t know what we will do if this doesn’t work…” She turned and made her way back into the castle, and Draco turned back to his new friends who were talking softly. He saw Remus put his hand on Sirius’s shoulder and whisper something that seemed to calm the other man. And at the sight, something flared inside him. Yes, that was what he wanted. That kind of love.
Shacklebolt nodded and pulled out a set of keys to unlock the cell. "Two steps away from the door, Malfoy," he said in the same calm voice.
“Of course I do, father. But it hardly means I have to give it up entirely. Besides, I barely know him. I would, however, like the opportunity to get to know him better…”
Still, soon enough, Draco convinced his friend that they needed to go clubbing, and it was easy enough to get caught up in the music and lights and smoke and alcohol, and soon Draco felt the most relaxed he’d felt in ages.
“Harry! You made it.” Draco moved to his friend’s side then looked wide-eyed at what he was wearing. “Where did you get that?”
Draco knew he would, but what if he made a bigger fool of himself in the meantime? Still, he nodded. “Okay.” He let Harry lead him back to the couch, closing his eyes when Harry settled beside him rather than across from him. Bad sign, that, but he couldn’t manage to get his tongue working right to tell him so, or to ask him to move away.
He was dishing out a bowl for himself when Potter entered, taking the bowl from him and taking a careful bite, then smiling at the taste. “Now this is more like it!” he said with a grin.
The grand ballroom had been decked in flowered garlands strung from the columns and chandeliers, and along the edges of the tables that had been draped in white and gold tablecloths and overburdened with food for the guests. The room itself was already full of horribly giggly girls when Draco arrived with his parents. When he failed to see Harry anywhere, his heart dropped, and he braced himself for a long, boring evening filled with simpering girls and knowing glances. Hopefully he would manage to last through the evening with his sanity intact.
Shacklebolt entered the room with them, activating the recording and protection spells in the room before removing Draco's bonds. "Remember, I'll be right outside, Harry. If you need anything…"
And over there? In the corner with the red-headed boy and his girlfriend with the fall of thick curly hair? That is Harry. He is beginning to realize that his friend Ron’s sister is simply no longer what he wants. Draco is.
“Well, yeah. I do stay out of that drawing room, but otherwise…I’m sure you’ve got memories here you’d rather forget…”
Setting the metal shoe aside, Harry stood and dusted himself off. “Egan should be up to a ride, so long as you don’t run him. I’ll go get him saddled and ready for you.”
“Give her a chance, Moony. She’s still got plenty of time,” Sirius said, sinking to the bench Harry had procured for himself. “Likely she’ll tell dear King Lucius, and he’ll have us tossed in the dungeons. He won’t much care that Harry has his own kingdom and that it will likely cause an incident…”
“And how do you know? Do you know this boy? For all you know, it is. Perhaps what Draco truly needs is a friend.”
Draco closed his eyes, nodding. So he’d have to last that long, at least. He didn’t want to, but until he could think of another way, at least he knew that was an opportunity. “All right. How…do I wash clothes?” Washing dishes seemed like it would be simple enough. Get them wet. But he had a feeling that washing clothes was a bit more complicated.
When he made his way down to the dining hall, refreshed and well-dressed, his mother was waiting at the head of the table. “Draco. And where is your bride-to-be?”
Before their conversation could continue, however, the Queen returned, not only with another gaggle of girls, but also with the wizard Dumbledore. He made his way across to where the group sat, smiling fondly. “Sirius, Remus. It is good to see you again.”
Potter shrugged. “There was an accident. Spilled something on mine, so I decided to come in here and sleep while the elves fixed it, since you’ve been gone all weekend. I figured you wouldn’t mind.”
He couldn’t let that stop him, though. He had to get rid of these dreams. The last had been the most vivid yet. And if they didn’t stop… He shivered, hugging himself, and tried to banish the images from his mind.
"Please, Potter. You're not even an Auror. Don't you think you're being a touch full of yourself there?"
Finally, he threw the wet clothes over a line. It would have to do. And apparently it had taken all day to do. The sun was beginning to set. He hadn’t even noticed the time in the midst of his chores, but now his stomach grumbled. He’d been so distracted by the futility of the chores Potter had given him that he hadn’t even stopped for lunch. All he could do was hope Potter would be home soon with food for them both. He stumbled to his bed, and though he tried to wait for Potter to reappear, he soon fell fast asleep.
"It’s alright, Draco. He can’t reach us unless he’s got a broom. But we’ll keep higher, just to be sure, okay?"
Once the courtroom quieted, Shacklebolt spoke. His quite voice still filled the room, even without a spell.
"Yes. I do." Even despite the gauntlet of passing the other cells. He couldn't handle being alone here with Harry any more.
And through it all, the food, the arrangements for the contest, Harry sat and talked to him. Apparently, Harry had lost his parents when he had been quite young, and had only just managed to regain his crown. Remus and Sirius—also known as Moony and Padfoot, had been his father’s two closest advisors, and had helped Harry recover his kingdom, along with a small group of others, some of whom were working now to restore his father’s castle to its former glory. “It’s not nearly as beautiful as your family’s palace, of course, but I’m fond of it…”
I never knew anything different. Our world was filled with people like us: purebloods, moreover, purebloods who supported the Dark Lord, whether openly or in secret, though more in secret than not. Many, like father, claimed they were merely spelled to obey, but we, their children, were told differently. We were all merely biding our time until the Dark Lord could rise once more.
Draco might be upset, but Ginny seems to believe that finally all is right in the world. She plots and imagines, talking to her Harry every day about their plans (her plans, of course) for their upcoming wedding, and failing to notice his ever-increasing discontent.
Lucius ignored him. “Very well. We will prepare a guard and a few servants to go with you and help you on the road, as you will have gifts for your impending nuptials to take back with you.”
He had to pull away quickly when several of the archers, who had obviously been positioned on the battlements at the sight of Draco’s new form, began to fire upon him. The few arrows that did reach him only bounced off, but it was enough to tell Draco that he wouldn’t be able to land without terrifying everyone below.
With a few experimental flaps of his wings, Draco stretched, then crouched low, hoping this would work, and leapt into the air, his eyes opening wide as his wings caught at the air and pulled him higher into the sky. It took him a moment to get a hang of it, but once he had, he couldn’t understand how he’d ever managed to survive without this. He’d obviously been born to fly.
“Sirius…that was then. Things are different now. And if Draco and I start on the right foot…” Harry met Draco’s eyes. “I’d trust you, Draco.”
Draco stood and met his eyes. "You didn't put me in here. My choices did. I deserve what I get." He felt a choking sense of dread at how they would punish him, but he couldn't deny he deserved it. "May I go back to my cell now?"
Draco did consider enlisting his father’s help in ridding himself of Potter, but there was part of him that fought that. He convinced himself that it was because he was worried his father would do something unwise, and end up back in Azkaban.
Finally, nearly a month after Blaise had left on his quest, he returned late one morning after a particularly stormy night, a bedraggled and wet girl in tow.
The party was such a success that they repeated it the next week, and the week after. The only break from the parties was the Winter holidays, when most of the school returned home to visit their families.
Draco wondered at that. Did it? Maybe he could convince his parents that? But as quickly as the thought came to him, he knew it would never work. It wasn't like he had time to shift their opinion, after all. The ball was tomorrow. So instead, he sighed and nodded. “True.” He glanced over at the horses where they were grazing, unable to meet Harry’s eyes again. “So…what did your power end up being like?”
“Too late, mother. You agreed. Formally. In front of witnesses. Harry and I will marry come the midsummer holiday, and he and I will take over the kingdom.”
He shifted to see a young man with bright red hair riding a chestnut stallion, staring at him from the road.
Afterwards, he pointedly ignored Harry each time he came to watch the cell. He deflected any conversation, whether about their day together, or anything else, even when it became the teasing banter with Potter. He couldn't handle talking to him at all. He wanted this over with, and Harry couldn't be the simple distraction he'd wanted, no matter the subject.
. He wasn’t sure how he would be able to pretend it didn’t affect him for long if it continued. “Let’s get this straight, Potter. Dreams or not? We are not friends. You made that decision a long time ago.”
When Draco had finished, Harry looked at him for a long moment before he spoke. “You know…that kind of reminds me of a fairy-story they read us in nursery school. Rapunzel. Ever heard of it?”
Draco nodded and stood up, mounting Egan and giving him a soft pat. “Ready to go for a ride, boy? I bet you’ve missed this.” Egan had suffered from colic, and so Harry and his stable hands had been caring for the horse carefully to help him recover. The stallion threw his mane a bit and gave a snort that Draco interpreted as “yes,” and Draco couldn’t help but smile. He had his horse back, and Harry would be riding with them. What could possibly be wrong with the world?
Once upon a time, there was a prince whose mother wanted him to marry a proper princess, but he had his sights on a different sort of mate.
But Harry was already reaching out to stroke Draco’s muzzle. Draco pressed into the caress, glad someone, at least, didn’t see him as dangerous. “Calm down, Sirius. He’s fine. He’s…purring.” Harry smiled. “I think he’s friendly.”
Draco tried not to respond to that, but it was a difficult thing. He hadn’t realized the man’s senses were so strong. All he could do was try to bluff it out. "You mean the bird that came to see me?" He asked.
And the clothes? That was true hell. Potter had pointed to the soap, a goopy syrup to pour onto the clothes after he’d gotten them wet, but when they were in the tub, he couldn’t tell if anything was coming out, and when he tried to scrub them, he couldn’t find a discernable difference either before or after.
Then Moony spoke again. “Why don’t you go back with him, Harry? We’ll follow behind. I doubt he could carry all three of us, after all, and hopefully the two of you can come up with something?”
“Ah, but at no time did I tell you that you were above all, Draco. You are a being of this world, just as others are. And you must find a way to reconcile yourself to that. Otherwise, yours will be a lonely and short existence. People do not like being insulted. No matter who does the insulting.”
“I am here to claim your son. I heard that you would make king whoever married your son, no matter who they might be.”
Draco grinned, then shifted closer. He knew they shouldn’t, and yet, all he wanted was to taste those lips. Surely that couldn’t be such a bad thing? Apparently, Harry agreed, for those soft lips pressed against his, and the two of them pressed against each other as hands began to roam.
For a long moment, it seemed as though even Harry didn’t know. Then he let his hand slide up Draco’s spine, sending a thrill through him, his fingers settling at the base of Draco’s skull, and pulled him forward. Draco gasped as their lips met, and Harry pressed his tongue between the parted lips.
“How can you say that? Everything I ever learned from you says that I must have dignity. Grace. That I must never cave under pressure. You have never said that I must bow and scrape to others!”
to seeing Potter again. It was ridiculous. He didn’t miss the git. He just wanted this over and done with. Now.
He glanced toward Harry, who was smiling at the other two, and couldn’t help but wonder. If Harry approved, did that mean that he had the same leanings? Or was he just fond of them, so he let it slide?
“So…we should take you to them, then,” Harry said, seeming far more certain now, but Draco shook his head. That was a bad idea. He couldn’t care less if his parents found out he’d gone outside, but learning their heir was a dragon? That would just not go well. And then there was the fact that the knights would probably slay him before Harry got a word in edgewise…
"Harry?" he asked, his voice trembling, his arms aching as he felt the window somehow pushing him back into the room. Bella’s spell. It had to be!
Harry's cheeks darkened. "Not what I expected, but no." He looked at Draco for a long time, both of them silent. "Did you want to ask a question?"
As it was, he was only able to force himself to dance with a small handful of partners before he made his way to where his parents were sitting on their dais, watching the dancers.
Still, a good burst of flame should take care of that… He swished his tail again to clear the way of any stragglers who might get in the way, then took a deep breath, hoping he could manage a good blast of fire. After all, so far, he’d only managed a few puffs of smoke. In the background, he could hear Harry arguing with his father, but somehow, he knew this was more important. He let out the breath, and with it came a gust of flame, causing the vines to wither from the walls.
He was beginning to fall into a truly panicked state when Harry alit on the windowsill once more, the late afternoon light lighting him from behind and making him glow, and for a moment, Draco just stared at him, wondering if he were simply a hallucination. Then he spoke. "Sorry it took so long, Draco. He had to make a potion. But it should work…and he gave me a few others…"
Draco shook his head, but immediately after, Harry cleared his throat and stood. "May I say something, sir?"
“If I can sleep in here with you for the night. I stay the night, and in the morning, if you really, honestly can’t feel a thing beyond disgust for
"No," Harry said, looking regretful. "I realize I shouldn't take credit for the parties, but I knew McGonagall would be more impressed if we were working together. And, well, I knew it was you."
Potter shrugged as he led the way to the road once more. “You were sleeping so peacefully, I didn’t want to disturb you, Draco.”
“It will be dealt with, mother. And none of your concern.” His arm went around Harry’s waist and led him to his chair. “Sorry I kept you awake so late, love. But it seems to have worked in our favor, doesn’t it?”
Harry smiled, too, pleased that Draco didn’t seem upset any longer. “I guess so. And…I can’t imagine this with any other guy, Draco. Just you.”
Potter shook his head. “Ah, that will be unnecessary, sire. Simply stack them in a wooden cart, and my betrothed can tow it.”
Gryffindor? Draco looked at his guard, horrified. Was Blaise out of his mind? He could hardly ask the words out loud, though, for fear his mother would take the words themselves as rejection of the girl. Still, it was unthinkable to suggest that a Gryffindor could marry one of the Royal family of Slytherin. The two states had been on the verge of war for centuries.
Whimpering, Draco stumbled to his feet, though all he wanted to do was curl into a ball where he lay. When he took hold of the handles for the cart, he whimpered again as his aching fingers closed around them as tight as he could manage.
“I welcome that friendship, sir. I would be quite pleased to have you and your son as my allies. I think both our kingdoms would benefit from it.”
Padfoot shook his head. “Afraid not. Dogs and dragons don’t really have much in common, I’m afraid. I wouldn’t be able to understand him any more in that form than this.”
“Fill your stomach and keep you warm until lunch, at least,” Potter said, and Draco nodded and sighed, picking up a spoonful to take a bite. Bland, but not horrible tasting. Just a bit slimy, though, he thought.
"You'd be dead?" Draco suggested. "You know father would have handed you over to the Dark Lord, Harry. If I'd had any more access to you, he'd have made sure of it."
We watch as Harry opens the door, and can see his expression soften with pleasure when he finds Draco there. “Dr—Malfoy. I’m glad you could come.” He opens the door wider and steps aside to let Draco in.
All to no avail, though. Potter shrugged. “You need the toughening up, pretty boy. Now get some sleep. You’ll need it if you’re going to pull the wagon again tomorrow.”
Lucius sighed, then slipped the silken piece of fabric over his son’s eyes, then tied it securely. “And now?”
“A deadly threat, indeed.” Blaise bowed to his prince. “I will see you soon, Prince Draco. A proper ‘bride’ for you in hand.” And with that, he was gone.
It wasn't until Potter brought his tray for supper he got his answer. "I agree to your terms. But I can't stay too long. So for every story, you get one question. Okay? And I promise to answer them as truthfully as I can. If I can't…"
“What do you think I’ve been trying to say? You’re not that dense, Draco. Surely you have some clue?”
Potter frowned. "I can't pass on any substantive messages, Draco. I could get into real trouble if I did."
Draco pulled away at that. The king hadn’t even arrived yet? He was still out of the country? He must be retrieving his consort, Draco thought to himself. And now he felt a fool, being worried his former suitor would see him. Weasley was right. If the king knew what a peasant was doing to the man he might have married, he’d never have allowed it. Even if he
Muggle or not, those people were hurting this boy, and he wasn't going to allow it. "Want to stay with me?"
The king nodded. "Narcissa’s sister was never a kind woman, and we feared she had hurt you, or worse. But you seem…quite whole," he said, a near-smile tickling his lips.
Draco felt his cheeks heat. "I was a right prat, wasn't I? I just used us, because… well, it's easier." Not that it hadn't meant anything, but he could hardly say so to Potter's face.
Still, it didn’t stop him from glancing up to look for him every five minutes. He tried reading, but got no further than a page or two before he gave up.
He moved to his own side of the bed, hanging his robe up before slipping under the covers, then, not looking at Potter at all, shut off the light. “Just…stay on your side, all right?”
It didn't stop them from trying, though. And each time a partygoer got caught, the punishment seemed to go up. Draco knew they hoped to discourage the gatherings, but none of the students seemed willing to give them up now.
It was difficult for Draco to hold back the disbelieving laugh at that. “No…just…dreaming about my dearest foe that way…wasn’t what I expected.” Neither had been wanting Harry as much as he had. He felt his cheeks flush at the thought, and he felt Harry stroked a finger over one again.
For lack of anything else to do, he stretched out on his side, turning his back to Harry, and dozed off.
“Twenty is just around the corner, I assure you. And if you have not found a bride within that time…who knows what might happen. You cannot keep rejecting every girl you see, Draco. There must be someone out there who would appeal to you?”
When Draco returned to the Manor, it was late Monday night. He snuck through the halls hoping that Potter would already be fast asleep. The door joining their rooms was ajar, but Draco was quick to close it, then moved to his wardrobe to peel out of his clothes. A quick shower, and then he stumbled to the bed, climbing in and shutting off the light before falling fast asleep.
Turning back to Draco, Harry watched him for a moment before speaking again. “So…you’re from the castle…you live there all the time?” Draco nodded, more excited. “And…are you friends with the Prince?”
"Oh, nothing for you to worry your pretty little head about," she said, continuing with the same evil grin.
The words alone were enough to bring heat rushing to his cheeks, and Draco turned away again, the cooler air coming from the window helping him calm a bit. “It’s getting dark. My parents will be worried.”
The thought of being dragged before his one-time suitor was enough to have Draco shaking. “I…my…betrothed told me I was to…collect wood. Not the king.”
Finally, he turned toward the cottage. He still couldn’t call it a home, but his bed was there. And Potter would probably look for him if he went missing. He hadn’t exactly seen the other man’s temper, but he wasn’t particularly sure he wanted to, either.
He was distracted from his reverent examination of the world around him at a crack to one side. This time, it was Bella who had appeared. She was flying. Without a broom. Draco’s arms tightened around Harry in horror once more.
Turned quickly to turn to his father. “Look at him. He couldn’t even be bothered to change before coming to see us, father. He is hardly a worthy spouse for your only heir.”
He dressed and walked downstairs, only to find Potter chatting amiably with his mother. It was unconscionable. Potter was taking everything from him! His home, his mother, his club, his bed… He viciously clamped down on the bit of his brain that assured him that it wouldn’t mind waking up to that rumpled hair and husky voice each morning.
Draco’d thrown the third potion, and Fenrir had again backed off, wailing. This time Draco caught a glimpse of Fenrir, and noticed that the area where the potion had hit was bubbling. Obviously, it was toxic stuff. Except that couldn't be true, could it? Around Bella, it had just made a bubble. Maybe each potion was different?
Potter shrugged. “I’m afraid I can’t afford that, Draco. But if you’re good, I might offer to send for your father when the time comes…”
Harry watched him for a few minutes, thinking. Draco wished he could read his friend’s mind, so that he knew what the answer was likely to be, and so that he would be able to counter it if he needed. Finally, Harry nodded. “All right. But only if you can find me an outfit. I’m not wearing my leathers to a ball,” he added with a grin.
“Indeed.” She glanced back at Harriet. “Very well. And how many heirs do you intend to bear my son?”
Weasley raised an eyebrow, then shook his head. “Look, why don’t you let me take that, and you can go home. You look ready to topple.”
Then Potter had stopped the others. "No. Mrs Malfoy helped me. And I doubt she was doing more than standing here with her family."
Snape watched him for a moment, then nodded. "Very well. You may go. But if I hear even a hint that another party will take place…"
“Thank you. Look, we don’t know each other, and I’m sorry if I’m being a bit snippy. It’s been a long week.”
“A prince?” Potter looked almost like he wanted to snicker, but he didn’t, so Draco did his best not to glare at him. Instead, he focused on the next dream.
Draco shook his head. If Harry wasn’t there, there seemed little reason to ride. He turned around and made his way to the gardens, settling by the pool at the centre of the main garden.
But why is it that Draco seems so upset by this sight? Surely he should be happy, or at least care not at all, given that he was in such a rush to get away from Harry?
"No, wait," he said, trying to catch the man's hand. "Please I know you have no reason to trust me. You think I betrayed your trust, but that list… I made it before our agreement. I swear it. I wanted nothing more than to know who you were. But not at the expense of losing you. I couldn't bear it."
The slim hope Draco had had for praise for what he’d managed to accomplish faded in that moment. Not only had he not even considered supper, but he still had to get the basket back up to the palace before nightfall, which was in less than an hour. He’d never manage both.
Nodding, Draco moved to straddle the handle, then put his arms tight around Harry’s waist. "Like this?" he asked.
Approaching the sables, Draco smiled to see Harry sitting out in the front of the building, pounding away at the anvil and working on shaping what he assumed was a horse-shoe.
The man walking next to the young man was the first to notice Draco when he came out of the bushes. His eyes went wide, and he motioned to Harry to move back, then called out to the man ahead. “Um…Padfoot…?”
"I don't know." He frowned, then stepped back. "I need to finish my rounds. I'll let you know later, okay?"
Potter shook his head. "I can't, Malfoy. Not until your trial's done. You're supposed to be kept separate from the trials. They don't want you using someone else's defense to get free."
The conversation he’d had with Harry the night before wore on Draco the next day, so he escaped the final fitting for his next set of robes, and made his way down to the stables to see Harry once more.
That statement astonished Draco. It touched on a particular interest of his own, and that Harriet might be interested in the same story seemed almost too much of a coincidence. “Were they?” he asked her.
He settled on the edge of the cart and began to eat his lunch, but was interrupted by a voice. “Oi!”
Most times, he was retrieved and placed on a much stricter guard for the next day or so, but there were occasional times when he managed to find a few moments to himself with no one the wiser. He simply didn’t understand why everyone was so tense about his upcoming birthday. After all, he’d had seventeen of them before. Surely this one would be no different from any other?
When King Lucius arrived, Draco was the first to the door of his father’s carriage, opening it himself with a grin. “Father.”
Every time he speculated on who it might be, his mind always ended up with one conclusion. He really wanted it to be Harry Potter.
The entire crowd turned to look at Draco at Harry’s pronouncement, and he couldn’t help but be glad that he wasn’t able to blush through his scales at the unexpected attention.
Draco couldn’t imagine growing up anywhere but the palace. He’d never even considered that there even
By the time he’d danced with ten young ladies, and three gentlemen (including Zabini, who had been far too grabby for Draco’s taste), and Harry still hadn’t shown, Draco decided he’d earned a break, and grabbed himself a goblet of wine, then made for the gardens, hoping for a bit of privacy.
Draco glanced at Harry, then met the Minister's gaze. "Sir, I have no defense." Harry hissed at the words, Draco but ignored it. Harry could fight this all he wanted, but it was true.
When he caught sight of him, recognizable by the set of his shoulders and the way he scanned the room, Draco moved to intercept him. He saw the moment the other boy caught sight of him, and couldn't help but feel a warmth fill him as the other boy moved to meet him halfway.
"Sixteen, sir." Draco couldn't see why it mattered. After all, he'd chosen to be Marked on his own. "No one forced me into it, if that is what you believe, sir."
“Yeah,” Harry said with a smile. “She’s pretty cool, actually. She’s actually able to look like whoever she wants.”
Why it was so important to him Harry remember their day together, Draco couldn't have said, but he felt desperate for him to know he hadn't always been the boy Harry remembered from school.
Unfortunately, this does not go over well, and we can see the temper rising in Draco. “No? You don’t want me here? Perhaps you feel a touch uncomfortable having me here?”
The words sent something warm radiating through Draco, and if he’d been able, he would have smiled. Instead, he nodded once to Harry, hoping he would understand that he felt the same. They would be allies as long as Draco had anything to say about it.
Harry’s fingers settled over Draco’s lips. “No buts, Draco. Not tonight. There’s just you, and me.” Then, before Draco could say anything to dispute that, Harry pulled him into another kiss, robbing him of the little breath he’d managed to keep from their last kiss.
Draco sighed. "Fine. Right." He was silent for a moment, then moved to pick up the tray and hand it to Potter. "Here. And Potter?"
There. That blond in the sleek and expensive outfit, dancing with everyone and settling on no one? That is Draco. He likes to pretend he is happy, but he knows something is missing. Though he would never deign to notice his one-time-obsession. Or ever guess that that obsession might now be obsessed with him.
“Of course not!” Draco relaxed infinitesimally. “Just bring the cart with you!” Potter said in a generous tone.
Draco scowled at him, ready to lambaste him for the gaffe, when he noticed the clothes Potter was wearing. Thick black velvet embroidered with gold, and glittering with gemstones along the front. A far cry from the clothes of a peasant. What was going on?
Harry smiled and nodded. "Yes. Very soon." Then he mounted his broom, and flew away, Draco watching him once more.
For a moment, Potter was quiet. Then he tugged took Draco’s wrist and pulled him closer. “I should have tried this before,” he said softly. His hand moved up to tangle in Draco’s hair before he could pull away, then pulled him into a kiss.
For a few days, Draco’s heart was lighter. However, when a week had passed, then two, his mother began to harp once more on his marriage. He knew it wouldn’t be long before the next contender to be his bride appeared.
But the problem was, Draco had been so wrapped up in being upset about Harry not being anywhere he could find him, he’d had no thought as to what his new power might be. “I…” He glanced at Harry, as though to ask him what he should do, when something clicked inside him, and he smiled. He turned back to his father. “I’ll show you. And if it leads me directly to Harry?”
Once there was a boy who had always been obsessed with bettering his rival, until the day when his family’s survival overrode everything else. But then the rival became obsessed with the first boy, and between the two, obsession slowly grew, until they were finished with their schooling, in the real world, and seemed to separate forever.
"For your information, Malfoy, I happen to be trying out as an Auror. Not that it's any of your business. But I figured if I helped with the trials, it would at least show I can do things other than destroy madmen."
Snape whispered in his mother’s ear again, and she smiled. “So, tell me, girl. How do you feel about marrying into the Slytherin Royal line?”
The man seemed content to watch Draco quietly, though his golden-brown eyes followed Draco as he moved to settle on the bench—then jumped back when he heard a growl from near his feet. A great black dog lay in front of the bench, and raised its head to bare its teeth at him.
It was on the tip of Draco’s tongue to say it was too late to worry about that, but he repressed it, smiling instead and kissing Harry again. After all, Harry wanted this. That was a big improvement all on its own, wasn’t it? He shifted to roll them over on the couch, settling on top of Harry. “So let me lead the way, then?”
Harriet shifted, then looked up to meet the queen’s eyes and replied in a soft, sweet voice she’d obviously been practicing on the road with Blaise. “It is possibly my best chance for marriage, Highness. Any other marriage would probably see me marrying a much less…worthy candidate.”
“No…please. It’s been unbearable. If you don’t want to go inside, just…stay out here with me for a bit?”
Potter glanced down the corridor, then moved closer. "They released her," he said softly. "She helped me and, well… because she did, this is all over. It was enough to get her a commuted sentence for her part in the rest."
After a moment, Potter pulled reluctantly away. There was a great deal of wariness on his face. “Draco?”
Part of Draco wanted to deny someone could force him, even Voldemort. But he'd also expected no one would believe him if he'd said the spells had been used under duress. "It did, sir," he finally managed.
In the morning, when he woke, Potter was sitting at the table, watching him. “New chore today, Draco. I told them you’d help up at the palace, preparing the feast. The king will be married tonight, and so they’ll need all the hands they can get.”
There was a long silence when Draco finished. When Harry finally spoke, he was as horrified as Draco had expected he would be. “Wait…I…kissed you?”
“It’s…going to hurt?” He’d heard it hurt for girls with their first times, but he’d always heard that with boys it was simply a matter of getting it over with.
Potter flushed. Draco’d never seen that before. “You never did take a good look at me that day, you know. Surface only?”
He heard the rumble of the cart-wheels rolling over the ground behind him, and turned to see Weasley approaching. He looked a bit surprised. “Wow. Pig doesn’t usually let others touch him. You must have the magic touch.”
Staring after his betrothed for several minutes, gaping, Draco found himself wondering who the King had chosen in his place, and if they in any way compared to him. It took several growls from his stomach before Draco finally stumbled to his feet to scrounge up something for breakfast. Finding bread and cheese, he made a makeshift sandwich, then tried to clean himself up the best he could before he went to his former suitor’s palace. He was in no way presentable. He hadn’t washed properly since they’d left Slytherin, his hands and nails were in abominable shape, and his clothing was smudged and beginning to be tattered. He considered pulling out a new outfit from his bag, but he was scared of the same happening to it. Enough not to want to waste it on a man he hadn’t wanted in the first place, even if it did make him look bad. Let the man think he preferred this to marrying him.
Snape lead the way down the stairs, past the last dozen or so hopefuls who had wanted to meet Prince Draco, and to the doors at the far end of the hall that led to the gardens. “He is waiting for you out there,” he said, opening the door for the prince. “I will do my best to give you as much time to become—acquainted—as you can before your father interrupts,” he said.
The relief overwhelmed Draco, and he sagged slightly in place. Andromeda. Of course. He blamed his tension for his reaction, grateful when Harry helped him straighten once more.
The use of his surname felt like a slap. Did Harry not remember? "Potter… did you ever spend time at the beach as a boy?"
But Draco isn't so easily won over with pleasant words, dear reader. “I wasn’t aware that I had a choice. Father said something about family honour. Let’s just get this over with, shall we? So…where is my room?”
Potter glared at him once more. "I told you to shut your mouth, Malfoy. It so happens I have other things to concern myself with than you. Now be quiet, or I'll make sure you stay that way regardless."
Ah, and there is the famed Malfoy glare. “Free.” And with that word, Draco makes his way down the street, forgetting whatever reason he had come to shop in the first place. It will only be when he returns to his own over-quiet flat that he will remember that he needed to get a few new potions. He promises himself he will go tomorrow—when Potter and his girlfriend (that’s fiancée, he reminds himself) are no longer there.
The next few weeks were miserable. The house-elf continued to bring food, but there were no more visits, no more assignments. No more word from his benefactor. He was alone. Far more so than before. And he knew it was his own fault.
Raising an eyebrow, Lucius stepped out of the carriage. “You seem in excellent spirits. I expected…well…different than this.”
The ‘our’ made Draco’s cheeks heat for some reason, but he nodded. “But if I don’t see you within a half hour, I’m coming to find you.”
“It wasn’t just that. I see you are angry, but…can you honestly say you aren’t happier now than you were before all this?” his father asked.
Harry opened his eyes looking down to meet his eyes, a goofy smile on his face, his glasses slightly askew. “Wow…” He kissed Draco again, softer this time, then stroked his cheek again. “That was…”
Draco’s aunt appeared that night, and Draco was even more glad he’d told Harry not to return in the darkness. Unfortunately for Draco, Fenrir was with her.
The kiss didn’t stop until they heard an angry shout from across the garden. A shout from a very familiar, and rather horrified voice. “Draco! What are you…! Dear god!”
“Right…” Harry seems at a loss, but he smiles at Draco, his heart on his sleeve for the other to see, if only he cared to look. “Why don’t we go into the kitchen and I can make us a late lunch? Unless you’ve eaten?”
“With a wizard in your midst! How do you know he didn’t trick you into it?” his mother asked, horrified.
Horrified, Draco nearly found himself sitting down in the puddle once more, his legs went so weak with shock. “So this was all just…what? Your way of getting back at me?” Even as he spoke, anger began to take hold. Draco was trembling slightly, thinking of all the things Potter had forced him to do. “You…bastard!” He shoved at the man, but Potter stepped back, not wanting to muss his own clothes, obviously, and Draco growled. “As soon as my father appears, I’m leaving. I don’t care what he says!”
It was a ground-shaking moment for Draco. Harry Potter had just said please to him. It was enough to shock him into returning to the couch and settling there once more. “All right.”
Draco blinked, staring at Potter, waiting for the rest of his little gang to appear and tell him the joke was on him. It didn’t happen. “What? Why on earth…Potter, that makes no sense.”
Unfortunately, Lucius knew he could not back down now. Whoever this man was, this was who his son would marry. He gathered his dignity best he could and greeted the man. “Welcome, stranger. And what can I do for you?”
So much so his benefactor stayed longer than usual. Draco sent him into the living room to mix them drinks so they could continue their debate while he cleaned up in the kitchen.
"There's an original comeback." Draco turned away and settled on his bunk once more, watching the two friends as they talked softly. He caught a few words, particularly the Weasel's name, but held his tongue. After all, getting Harry angry about his best friend wasn't likely to get Draco on his good side now.
"Who would be better placed to cast some of the spells cast to keep your little soirees secret from the professors? And who would benefit more? I assure you, Draco, this has gone on long enough. If you truly wish me to get the Headmistress involved, do continue to pretend innocence. I assure you, she will be even less pleased when I tell her."
The man dismounted, then approached Draco, his blue eyes narrowing. “What are you doing in here? You know this is the king’s forest, right?”
Shacklebolt turned to him, surprised. "About the curses? Otherwise, your statement will need to wait, Mister Potter."
Harry nodded. "I was surprised when I realized, but then I realized it made sense. I mean, we're alike in a lot of ways, Draco. But if you don't want—"
“No? You’re not? You don’t like him?” Well, that wasn’t a helpful question at all. Draco huffed again. “So…you do like him, then?” Harry asked, confused.
The two took a few minutes to recover from the magical backlash, but once Draco recovered, he turned to check on Harry. Harry stared at him with wide eyes. Even if he hadn't known before, Harry's reaction let him know the spell was gone.
You see, I never thought I would have a chance to fix things. Then Potter and his friends showed up in our Manor. It was him. How could I not know? I'd seen him after so many Quidditch matches and scrapes. I knew what he looked like as well as my own face.
Potter snorted. "No. Lifetime of dealing with goading. You're nowhere near as good as my cousin Dudley was."
Still, it didn’t stop him from going to visit him in his stables. And it had been the perfect excuse to get away from his parents. That he needed a bit of fresh air to help him think.
This family that Harry had told her about…were they waiting at the palace? Draco desperately wanted to tell Harry to turn around. Yet…where would he go, if not to his true family? It stumped him. Now that he was free, who was he? Where was he to go?
Each man and woman exclaimed at the Prince’s beauty, and how pleased they were that he had finally been born, but hidden among them was the wizard. He watched with growing hatred as the King, Queen, and all their subjects adored the Prince, then went away to plan.
“You are home, Draco,” came Lucius’s drawl from the door. “When I arrived, you looked happier than I have seen you since you were a boy.”
Draco’s heart sank at that. He wasn’t sure if he should be pleased or scared of what might happen if the man were to say anything to Potter. Still, he doubted it would be good.
“All right,” Draco sighed. He wasn’t sure this was a good idea, but who else could he tell? “The first…You decided you wanted to make peace. So you came to ask me a favour…”
If the walking didn’t do it, or the sun, Draco was beginning to think that Potter’s “food” would. But he’d learned his lesson. He always tried to eat a bit at each meal he was allowed, even if he felt as though he were about to throw it right back up. He had to, or he knew he’d never make it. And then how could he send a letter back to his father telling him how this man was torturing him into an early grave? How could he rule their kingdom if he was dead?
She smiled. “Hm…well, it might to me.” She turned to Lucius. “I say we let him. If my assumption is correct, he’ll be very controllable. And we could always use the favour of a hero, couldn’t we?”
time, when it would finally alleviate his suffering, remembering all the times he’d just randomly appeared where Draco’d been going. Still, he shook off his annoyance and sat down near his father, who looked about ready to blow as well.
to have another of the bloody things, and easier, because as time went on, the dreams were becoming increasingly more attractive to him somehow. The idea of those green eyes on him, that smile…
Draco nodded, unhappy he wasn't able to get more from him. But pushing wouldn't make him more likely to agree, so what else could he do?
looked forward to a single one of his aunt’s "visits," for once, he was highly impatient. Time seemed to drag. And yet, at the same time, it was slipping by far too fast. He just wanted Harry to appear once more. Before Fenrir arrived. Because if he showed before Harry… Draco shuddered. It couldn’t happen. It wouldn’t. Harry wouldn’t let it. Still, it didn’t stop Draco from worrying.
“Oh, the man over there.” Harry nodded back towards the glowering man who had directed Draco to Harry.
Draco had been playing chess with Pansy at the time, trying to convince her of Blaise’s good qualities.
Generally, during these introductions, Draco’s parents stayed silent, apparently wanting Draco to make up his own mind about the applicants. But this time, Lucius stepped forward. “Gryffindor?” he asked, looking alarmed—for him, at least. “That is impossible,” he said. “The Gryffindor Royal family died out nearly twenty years ago.”
Draco couldn’t see the expression on his father’s face, but the huff told him easily enough that Lucius thought this a waste of time. Still, he took his son’s arm and guided him slowly to the door.
Draco looked up at the familiar voice and glowered at Potter. Normally, he’d have said nothing, but after more than a week of not being able to escape the git, plus this weekend, and even worse, this morning, the Firewhiskey seemed to be all that was needed to loosen his tongue. “Why can’t you just leave me alone? Aren’t we even yet?”
“Never mind. Just remember to have something waiting for me when I get home tonight. You did such a great job with our clothes that I offered your services to the King for his wedding banquet. So you’ll need to go to the servants’ entrance of the palace and retrieve the tablecloths and napkins, wash them, then return them before nightfall. And don’t forget to make something for us to eat for supper!” And then Potter was gone before Draco could protest.
Draco wasn’t sure whether he should be relieved or not. As of yet, he hadn’t touched on Harriet’s true identity. “What exactly are you implying, Severus?” He used the man’s first name pointedly, hoping it would quiet him.
There was a long pause before Harry spoke. “Well, it’s…kind of a weird story, really. This guy and…well, his dog, I suppose…” He looked as though there had been a great deal more to it, but wasn’t quite certain how to put it into words.
The words seemed to have a cheering effect on Harry, and he smiled. “What? You actually want to miss out on having all the attention on you? Don’t tell me…the world has come to an end?”
Dumbledore nodded, then set to work. “Intelligence will stand him in good stead. But his ability to change form will not appear until the day Tom’s spell takes effect. He will change to his alternate form, and there stay until someone comes to break the spell. The vines will grow around his resting place until that day, and keep him safe from harm. He will live.”
Well, that was different, wasn’t it? Still…not so bad an idea when he thought about it. “Really? So…in a way it’s your First, too.” Draco couldn’t help but smile at the idea.
That is when the door opens, and Draco looks out at him. The startled look on his face says everything we need to know. “I am?”
All in all, it was nice to have someone to talk to. Even if it wasn't someone he'd spent much time with before.
For some reason, the words took the fight out of Draco. He pulled away, the vague memory of his dream tickling at the corners of his consciousness, the word far too familiar on his tongue, though this time he didn’t speak it. “I didn’t. I wouldn’t…”
“You said that if I could ever think of anything you could do to repay me for helping you and your family, I should let you know. I’m letting you know, Draco. I want to come live in the Manor with you.”
If Draco had been human, he might have bit his lip at the question, but he refrained, not sure how to answer. The archers were still fresh in his memory. What if they were still up there? They might hurt Harry. Finally, he nodded slowly, then bent down to let him climb on once more. After all, he could stay out of reach until he was sure, then decide from there. He’d keep well away so that there would be no risk to Harry at all.
Harry’s response was easily as simple. “I will,” he said with a smile, then pulled Draco gently down onto the bed.
Harry nods slowly, his shoulders slumping. If only we could give him a hug. “All debts settled.” Draco doesn’t seem to notice his dejection. He’s too pleased that he has been given permission to leave.
Narcissa seemed impressed with the answer. “Oh? So…you have no objection to marrying the foes of your family?”
Despite his fear and his hunger, Draco did manage to fall asleep. When he woke in the morning, it was to the sight of a new and yet familiar face.
He didn’t wake for several hours, and when he did, the cloth under his cheek, as soft as it was, didn’t feel like his pillow. And his legs were tangled around…something. And then there was that soft sound in his ear.
Draco dreamed of kisses. Of being released. Of long walks in the park where they finally and truly came to know one another. Where his benefactor finally realized Draco wanted nothing more than to be with him, to love him. Eventually, he admitted he loved Draco back.
Then came Hogwarts, and with it, the realization of Harry Potter, and of what Muggles and Muggleborn were truly like. Somewhere, in the back of my head, I could see Muggles and Muggleborn were different, but my annoyance at Harry Potter and his friends, particularly the know-it-all witch who seemed to want us all to think her better than all of us, kept me from acknowledging what I could see plainly for myself.
The problem was Draco wasn’t really interested in marrying. Not any time soon. And the one person he could think of he might be interested in that way was of such a low rank, likely his parents would both die of heart attacks on the spot if he were to suggest it.
Draco echoed his father’s glare at them, then swished his tail, causing the crowd around them to scatter before moving towards his tower. As his father had said, it had been covered in vines somehow. Draco couldn’t understand how that had happened.
Draco held his breath, but nodded slowly. What if Harry said no? Of course, if he did…he somehow knew that he’d be stuck in this form forever more.
Potter obviously sensed the change in him, as his eyes narrowed. “Yes. You’ll need to get up there soon. They’re expecting you.”
Finally, Harry stretched out beside him, kissing him softly as his fingers moved. Draco’s whimpers soon turned to moans, and then Harry was above him once more. “Say it again,” he whispered roughly to Draco, and after a moment, Draco’s lust-fogged mind remembered the words. “Harry, please…be my First?”
Of course, that was when Bella chose to appear once more, directly in front of him. "He will never be free, and he knows it. What is he fit for, anyway? King?" She laughed. "He knows he’s fit for nothing more than to become my pet as I planned all along. After all, Fenny can only last so much longer. He needs someone to train…"
So what could Draco do? Confront Potter, of course. After all, the git didn’t seem to be leaving on his own…
Once they were gone, Lucius turned to his son. “It cannot be anything beyond friendship, Draco. Are we clear?”
“Not like that, Pansy. Just…he finds you interesting, that’s all,” Draco said, pushing forward his rook to check her king.
“I don’t want to hurt you, Draco. Not ever. I promise.” He pulled up Draco’s chin. “Just…give me a chance?”
If he thought about it, he supposed he should be, but he wasn't. "It's not that. I just… I wish… he'd been able to trust me. Save me. From myself."
They don't know. Can't understand I'm far more responsible than they could possibly give me credit for.
“Well, you look wonderful,” Draco said, glad it was dark there in the gardens, so that the blush on his face wouldn’t be easily noticed by his friend. “And I’m glad you’re here. I didn’t even get to talk to you today when I came down to the stables.”
Before he could say more, Fenrir was over him, his grin echoing the one Bella had used. "Let me do it, Bella. He’ll never think of leaving you then…"
Biting back his annoyance, Draco shook his head again. "No. Meeting a boy in Brighton when I was young. We spent the afternoon together. He was the first friend I ever met father had nothing to do with." He watched Harry's face as he spoke, but there was no spark of memory there.
King Lucius tried not to frown at this pronouncement, but there was nothing he could do. Draco would have to learn that he had made his own choices, and this was what had come of it. He would worry about what would come once his son had learned his lesson. If that did not happen, well, he would have to find another heir anyway. He nodded. “And so I shall. And your name, sir?”
Still…he had to get some help. People would start looking for him soon, and when they found a dragon in his place…better to not be here. All he could do was hope he found someone who would at least try to understand him before running away.
It didn't make Draco want to answer. "Why don't you access the memory and find out, hm? Because it's a spell that needs to be done as close to the original moment as possible, or it doesn't work too well." He raised an eyebrow at Granger. "Right, Granger?"
“Indeed. I am hardly going to give you the hand of my closest friend if you can’t bring me a ‘bride.’ In fact, I might well marry you to the next girl my mother dares to shove at me just to get her out of my hair.”
He tried to send messages through the house-elf, but it refused to take them, and any he snuck into the things he knew the house-elf would take with it found their way mysteriously to his desk once more.
"All right, Harry. I'll be right outside. He might not be his father, but he is still a high profile prisoner. If something were to happen…"
It was full dark, now, and Draco pressed his face into Harry’s back, trying to relax, waiting for another attack. But even if one never came, what awaited him at the end of this journey? He’d never known anything but Bella and Fenrir. And while Harry was sweet and kind, or at least seemed so, Draco couldn’t be sure that others would be. That was one thing, at least, he had learned from his aunt.
Draco settled next to his friend on the bench. “So…where did the outfit come from? It’s…” Well, frankly, it was gorgeous. And it suited Harry’s looks. It was a tabard made of black velvet, and was trimmed in gold with leggings and even boots to match. Harry's outfit was almost a dark version of Draco's. And it suited him at least as well as Draco’s own hand-made robes. “You look…wonderful.” True, Draco had always admired Harry in his leathers, but still…the effect was enough to make him almost forget that Harry couldn’t be the one he chose.
After a moment, Harry nodded, smiling at the memory of the night before the words had provoked. “All right. But if I don’t see you soon, I’ll be sending Sirius after you.”
Draco realized nothing he could say would help. He took a last look at Harry, trying to apologize to the other boy without words. Harry seemed resigned, and nodded, and Draco turned and went into the house.
For some reason, Harry seemed to go almost calm. "I’m afraid I can’t do that, ma’am. Need to get him to his family."
He nodded. "We'll give it a couple of days, then send out a new invitation." He'd have smirked, if not for the butterflies in his stomach. "Thanks, Pans." Draco headed off to his dorm. Time for some serious thinking.
”Wonder what?” Draco asked, his breath coming faster now. But he couldn’t find it in himself to pull away.
He didn’t have to hold it long. “I like.” He kissed Draco again, and Draco happily responded, feeling his heart lighten just a bit. But then Harry pulled back. “But…I…can we really do this? I mean…your parents…”
"I found a description of a memory spell causing headaches when the memory comes to the surface," she admitted grudgingly.
Draco watched as Harry looked down the hall for the third time in the past hour. "I'm sorry if I'm boring you, Potter."
will notice, I am no longer a dragon. Doesn’t that make any difference? Harry kissed me, and I changed back.”
So it came to pass, the war of Voldemort ended. Harry Potter was victorious, as he was always meant to be, the Wizarding World was safe, and those who served the Dark Lord were rounded up for trial. At least, those who remained.
That confused Draco, and then he was shaking his head, negating Harry’s statement for a moment. “But what about the fact that we were on opposite sides? And what about Weasley’s sister?”
“Were you sleeping with anyone else last night?” he responded, the chuckle there just on the edge of his words.
The Queen urged the first girl forward, and Draco had to restrain himself almost as much as it looked like the girl was trying to do to keep from running the other direction. She leaned in, her eyes squeezed tight, and…nothing. He could barely even feel the touch on his scales. He looked down at her, then over at his mother and shook his head. It hadn’t been bad. Just…nothing, really.
Once in ‘Harriet’s’ room, Draco sent Blaise off to get Pansy so that they could talk. When Blaise had left he turned back to ‘her.’ “Is that really your hair?”
Harry stayed with him while he waited, though neither of them knew what to say, aside from a couple failed attempts of thanks from Draco, and even more failed attempts to reassure him from Harry.
“Yeah. It doesn’t quite…feel like a dog. Anyway…the guy…he said…that it was part of my inheritance.”
“All right. Come on. There’s another sitting room upstairs. We can use that.” He led the way, and Draco followed, trying not to notice Weasley’s increased glares as he passed by.
But as his eighteenth birthday approached, the King and Queen began to worry. What if Dumbledore’s enchantment failed? What if the Prince still wasted away? Neither of them could bear it. He was their only heir, and their joy. And to lose him would mean the end of their line.
Now very annoyed, Draco turned to her. “Because, mother, the idea was mine. Not his. None of them even suggested it. I wanted him to.”
"Of course! Though…you must never come at night. When she comes, it’s always night. And…I don’t know if she would be pleased to find out I've had visitors."
"You have seen something else. Once." But he supposed once wouldn't be enough to save him. "Never mind, Potter."
Surely that couldn't be right? Draco started again. And ended up with the same answer. He wrote it out once more, but still there it was, in black and white. Harry Potter.
Harry looked up, startled. “Prince Draco! Um…hold on. Let me get Egan saddled for you.” He smiled distractedly then disappeared into the stable.
See now how Harry flushes. Not the usual action of a happy man. But he manages a smile for his rival. “Yes. Thank you. How are you doing these days?”
“Mmm…” Harry nodded, then dug into his food, completely oblivious to the glares the queen mother was sending their way now.
The Minister frowned at him. "Mister Potter has asked to speak with you privately in one of the interview rooms."
She came across the lawn to where he was sitting, then glared at him. “Do you truly want to be a dragon for the rest of your life, Draco?” He shook his head. “Then please allow me to do what I can to help you,” she said, her eyes slightly narrowed. He nodded, then watched as she moved back across to the girls.
Lucius pulled his son away from the other boy. "Go into the house, Draco. I'll deal with you later."
Harry shook his head. “No. Sirius and Remus, my personal guards are with me. But Draco needed help so I came back here with him after he finally made clear to us who he was.”
Scowling, Draco was about to let the other man learn of his displeasure, but then the door opened, and Blaise and Pansy appeared, a dark green dress draped over her arms. “So, where is your bride-to-be, Draco?” she asked.
Harry made his way back to where Draco was hiding. “They won’t let me talk to anyone. And wouldn’t say why. How did you get out here, Draco? Were you out here when you changed?”
The reception line seemed to take forever, and, of course, each girl as well as a few of the younger men, did their very best to catch his interest. The closest he could come to feeling interested in any of them was when the duke of the lowlands introduced himself. Duke Zabini was a lovely man with dark brown skin and a wicked smile, with twinkling eyes to match, and hair that looked like it would be glorious to wrap his hands in. But he wasn’t Harry. Even as he shook and kissed hands, his eyes scanned the room every so often for his friend, hoping he would appear.
Upon hearing the words, Draco nodded vigorously. Harry glanced up at him. “You’re…the Prince?” he asked, his eyes wide. “How…? I mean…no one ever said anything about you being a dragon before…”
Potter pulled him back, gentle but firm. “You did, Draco. Please…stop fighting this? Let me at least try?”
“I hate this. Being forced to marry someone just so I can have my power. Why do I have to marry anyone?” He met Harry’s eyes, and felt his heart beat faster. He’d never told his friend his true feelings for him. After all, it would hardly be fair to Harry to know it. It wasn’t like they could act on it, even if Harry were interested. “I wish you could come to the ball, at least. Then there would be
Even though he wanted to say yes, it was difficult. What if this was a trick to make him look bad. “What about your horse?”
"Ugh, god, Potter… haven't you heard of the Enervate spell? Works far better than shaking, and if someone is injured, it has far less chance of causing further injury."
Draco looked out the window. It looked to be sometime around mid-morning. "How far do you have to go?" he asked.
Hadn’t he himself thought that he’d like a relationship as pleasant as Sirius and Remus’s? And he liked Harry. It was true, they didn’t know each other well, but they’d have to be allies. Wouldn’t that be easier if they were friendly?
When he woke, it was morning. He could barely move from his sore muscles, and his stomach was demanding food—
“Ah, well, you’ll prettify the place up, now, won’t you?” Potter asked. “Come on. I’m just aching to try out those down mattresses your father gave us. And in the morning, it’s to market.”
Narcissa turned to glower at her cousin. “He hardly needs you as an example, Sirius. Personally, I worry about Harry, with you at his side. Does he know just how deviant you are, Sirius?”
It was. Potter gave him instructions, most of which went entirely over his head, then left for the day, taking the cart with him. Draco sighed and decided to start with the dishes and the sweeping. Hopefully those would be easy enough, at least.
Draco turned finally toward the ‘girl.’ Her hair was long and rather bedraggled, her clothing covered by a thick woolen cloak. But at the moment he looked at her, she glanced up, and suddenly he found he could do nothing but stare into a pair of the brightest green eyes he’d ever seen in his life. Mentally shaking himself when he realized he'd been staring, he turned back to Blaise. “A princess? And does this princess have a name?”
Harry turned to look at him. “Too bad you can’t stop it. You see…turning down an offer of this sort for your son would mean that people would wonder. After all, why would you not want your son to have a match so good? Unless you had a hand in deposing the family of said match, and are worried people might find out?”
Draco glanced back and forth between Harry and his father. Lucius did seem to be accepting this far too easily. And while he’d been scolded for playing with Harry as a boy, now that Draco thought about it, he’d gotten off then far too easily. He couldn’t help wondering if his father had, indeed, known who Harry was all along. “Besides. It’s too late, father. He is my First. Or…he was.”
“Will he?” The voice wasn’t Draco’s. Nor was it Sirius’s. Instead, Lucius was standing off to one side of the path, glowering at them both. “And why would he do that when I cannot see you ever marrying my son, Prince Harry?” The last two words were sneered as though he refused to believe them.
Unable to find the words for his relief that he wasn’t being asked to stop, Draco nodded, a spike of happiness filling him. He leaned in to kiss Harry again, his fingers once more moving down his body, stopping to undo Harry’s jeans. He fumbled with the buttons for a moment before managing to work them free then slid his hand inside and curling it around Harry.
Unable to speak, Draco nodded, the fear back once more then tried to relax as Harry began to touch him. The first touches made his skin prickle, and then, there was pressure, and Harry was urging him to relax, to breathe, but how could he? The feeling was simply far too intense, and each time the feeling lessened, there was soon more.
Draco shook his head quickly. "No. It’s late. I wouldn’t want to wake them. I can meet them soon enough…"
Draco felt Harriet still beside him, and shifted his hand, pulling her gently with him. “It’s all right. He’s not as bad as he seems. Really.”
True to his word, Draco's host visited, usually during meals once or twice a week. Compared to what Draco'd become accustomed to, it was wonderful. Of course, he still suspected Potter was behind the shadow which hid him from Draco's eyes. He never called him by name again, though.
“Mother…” She raised an eyebrow, and Draco sighed. “Yes, mother,” he said, sitting up straighter, then spreading his napkin across his lap as his breakfast appeared. He dug into his food, trying desperately to ignore his mother and Potter’s chatting.
So when he found a chance to escape on the morning of his birthday, he took it. His guards had been distracted from watching him by the parade of food being brought in to the kitchen, and Draco slipped out a side door, and into the gardens. He hadn’t managed to be outside in several days, and the need to feel wind and smell fresh air was beginning to distract him from anything else.
"Draco…" The woman was speaking now. "He’s already left. I think he wanted you to have time alone with your family."
made that decision? Draco…Malfoy,” Harry said, switching names with a sigh at another glare from Draco. “I only did what any kid would have done. Protected his friend from a bully. It’s not my fault you were a git.”
Draco sighed, then reached out for the water skin, wincing as he tried to open the thing, then took several large swallows before handing it back. “When will we stop for lunch?” he asked.
Biting his lip, Draco met Harry's eyes. "Are you straight?" he finally managed after a few minutes struggling to find the words.
“Your family owes me, Malfoy. And if your son is to have any future in our world, he’d do well to cultivate new friends. I can help him with that.”
Not that Draco had much to go on. Just this house, which was fairly generic, the shadowy figure he'd met when he'd tried the front door, and the fact they'd probably been on the side of Harry Potter, since they'd been given the chance to watch over him.
“He’s hardly likely to send you back to the place he saved you from, Lucius… Do calm down. You’ll give yourself a heart attack. I’m certain it won’t be as bad as you seem to think.”
Shacklebolt and the others looked shocked at the suggestion. "Did Malfoy ask you to speak for him, Mister Potter?" Shacklebolt asked him after a moment.
With only one more tale to go, Draco wonders if he can even get the words out any more. But Harry insists.
“Cook?” Draco twitched, his first reaction horror at the idea, his second, the memory that Potter was hiding all this from his king. “In the palace, you say?”
Still, whether or not Harry went to talk to his family, Draco knew nothing would change unless Harry himself remembered. So he'd have to find a way to break through the spell, despite the headache he knew it was likely to cause him.
At this Robards snorted, but Shacklebolt sent him a quelling look, then nodded at Harry to go on. "I do, Harry."
Draco nodded. He couldn’t help but hope that this was the thing Harry had been hiding from him, but when he stepped out into the gardens, the man he saw there looked nothing like his lover. “You’re not Harry.” It was hardly politic, he knew, but he had so hoped…
When Potter returned, Draco wanted to pick up the story immediately, but Potter seemed to want to talk about the first part of the story.
Instead, he made his way to his favourite fountain. But someone had beaten him to it. He hid behind the hedge, watching the other man, wondering who he was. He couldn’t recall ever seeing him before, but that didn’t mean the man wouldn’t know who he was. And as he’d escaped his captivity for the moment, he wanted to prolong the time he had out in the fresh air.
"Please. You can tell me some things. Just little things. And I'd be willing to offer something in return for each piece of information. I'd even be willing to sign a wizarding contract not to use anything you tell me in my trial, if it will make you feel more comfortable."
"Very well. We wish to verify the facts of this case, then." He flipped open the file in front of him and glanced over the papers inside before looking once more at Draco. "you are the son of Lucius Malfoy and his wife, Narcissa Malfoy, formerly Narcissa Black?"
Draco's anger choked him at the words. "How can you… have you ever been left alone? Completely? No one to talk to for months on end? How the fucking hell would you know how bad it feels? You have no right to judge my feelings!" Draco struggled to get out of bed, only to find it had been too long, and his legs weren't ready to let him stand. "Fuck… get out. You don't want to know me, then don't. But don't you fucking judge me, P…" He realized what he was about to say, and stopped abruptly, closing his eyes. "Get out. Whoever you are."
The tone of voice made his host's identity all too clear now, even if he hadn't guessed before, but Draco ignored that for more important things. "Did I look for a way to use it against you? Did I call you Potter again? Never. I wanted you here. To talk to. To get to know you. As much as you'd let me. Regardless. I don't care if you're Longbottom or Weasley… or someone I don't know. I just…" Draco felt the panic rising in his chest, filling his throat. "I just wanted to become… friends."
Draco moved back away from the wall before he took flight. He was really getting the hang of this, but he wanted to be well away so that the arrows wouldn’t be able to reach when they came into view. He swooped high above the walls, then relaxed when he didn’t see the archers. But he did notice something further inside the walls. Near the tower that housed his room. There was a small crowd there. He flew toward it, almost forgetting about Harry.
Before Draco could retaliate, though, Harry flipped them again, his lips finding Draco’s neck once more, fastening on the spot he’d been sucking on before he’d flipped them as he ground harder against Draco. “God…yes…” Draco arched up against him, finally letting his eyes fall closed as Harry took over. The sight of him was just too much now. He knew he wouldn’t last too much longer at this rate. He’d needed this ever since he’d woken from that final dream, and with Harry, here, pressed against him, willing and warm and kissing back; it was all he could do to hold on. “Harry…oh…” He shuddered. “Close.”
"Right…" Draco said again. He searched his brain for something, anything to tell Potter. Then the perfect idea came to mind.
The first few minutes, the two of them exchanged nothing more than kisses and touches through their clothes. But as soon as Harry began to try to undress him, Draco’s inexperience caught up with him, and he began to panic. This was something he’d never even attempted before. Even more than a peck on a hand or cheek was beyond his experiences.
Draco woke with a start, the memory of bright green eyes and a wide smile caught in the moment between sleep and waking. This had to stop. He stumbled from his bed, glancing up into the mirror over his dresser, looking at the flush spread across his cheeks and the shadows under his eyes.
It seemed he dreamed, as there was a whisper somewhere in his memory. “Silly boy. You don’t have to make it this difficult on yourself…” He felt someone draw a cover around his shoulders, and he snuggled deeper under the warmth, sinking deeper into sleep
Remus nodded again. “Things are beginning to come together, yes. We thought it would be prudent for Harry to make a few contacts while the palace was being worked on, and what better place than a royal birthday celebration?”
Harry thought about that, then smiled and nodded. "All right. Come on. Let’s go find a room for the night. We’ve got a long way to go." He put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, and together, the two of them walked down to the village, where Draco’s life would finally begin.
Apparently, it was the wrong thing for him to have done. The larger boy, deciding Draco was too much of a threat, seized on his companion to bully once more, and pushed him. Hard. The smaller boy fell to the ground, his glasses falling from his face and sliding across the pavement.
Potter shook his head. “Actually, your father gave them to me. And…well…you see how small my home is. It’s not like all of it could fit in there anyway…”
Potter was watching him, eyes narrowed, and Draco knew the next step would have to be his. His hand came up to curl around the back of Harry’s neck, then pressed his lips to Harry’s. And when he’d become Harry, he couldn’t remember, but the moment Harry’s lips responded to his, he knew he was forgiven. Maybe not of everything, but now they could at least work on the rest—together.
Draco wasn’t sure he liked that idea. But Harry seemed to think it was a good idea. “You need to get back, Draco. At least I’ll be able to explain a bit, right?”
Draco blinked. He’d never really thought about it. "I…don’t know. I don’t know any magic, but…she says I’m her nephew, so I must be, right?"
Looking up, Draco met his friend’s eyes then nodded. “True.” Too bad he couldn’t just ask Harry and have done with it. But things between them were already strained and awkward from their difference in status. He didn’t want to hurt Harry for some whim of his own. “Still, maybe I’ll get lucky and find the person meant for me at one of these balls.” Unlikely to happen, but he had to let himself hope, didn’t he?
“Apparently so.” Draco took Harry’s hand. “And even more? I’ve Chosen. Whatever you do? Harry’s right. People
“What do you mean, ‘It worked?’” his father asked, barely holding back the snarl. “You were kissing a
All three men turned to look up into the stands, but Draco didn't check. He knew who had spoken. Harry. He shot him a glare.
While Draco didn't doubt the Headmistress would take Snape's word over his, he refused to give in easily. Snape's true loyalties, attested to by Harry Potter himself, meant Snape was second to Harry himself when it came to adulation of the Wizarding World. He could do no wrong. Especially with those who worked alongside him, but doubted him upon Dumbeldore's death. Now that his name was cleared, they refused to doubt him again.
Lucius was watching him closely. “Do you have a choice for us, Draco? There is no need to put you through this if you are not up to it, and have made your choice, after all.”
Draco shook his head. It was very annoying that he couldn’t, really, but there was no way to change that, so he would have to find another way to communicate with these three. If he wanted help, anyway…
That night, in the great hall, three tables holding golden plates and goblets were laid out on the kingdom’s finest linen, and the great witches and wizards lined up to bestow gifts on the Prince. Each had conceived a special spell as a gift for the boy, and one by one, they began to cast them over him.
Weasley sighed, but he didn’t stop them as they made their way up the stairs. Once Potter had shown Draco to the sitting room, he let Draco enter first, closing the door behind them. “So…what’s this about, Malfoy?”
"Why are you telling me, Potter? It's no business of mine." Not that Draco didn't want to know, but he was startled Potter would share something like that with him.
"Never mind," Draco scowled. He didn't want pity. "What do you want? Beyond absolution, that is, because I can't say I'm feeling up to offering it right now."
The first time he'd seen him, Draco was shocked. "What are you doing down here, Potter? Shouldn't you still be celebrating your victory?"
Right up until the moment Potter appeared. How Potter had ended up in a place like this, Draco didn’t know. He hadn’t even known Potter
He was a good deal older than the other applicants for his “affections.” Nearly as old as his parents, if he guessed right. And while he was dressed quite well in a formal black robe with what looked like a million buttons, the sour look on his pinched, pale face was enough to make Draco shiver. The nose wasn’t bad, though some might have seen it so. But the hair? Black and greasy, as though he had never washed it in his life.
Draco wanted to ask what he meant when Snape turned him and pushed him toward the door. Would Snape take him to the Headmistress? The idea wasn't a pleasant one. McGonagall could be worse than Snape when riled. Especially when it came to Slytherins.
Draco laughed. “Exactly, Po—Harry.” He flushed, still not used to using the name, but glad for the chance to be so familiar. Once he’d caught his breath, he looked up at him. “So…?”
“And if I could help you find someone who would please her, and give the kingdom the connections it needs, and also fit your requirements?” Blaise asked him.
“Maybe you’ll be able to fly,” Harry said with a laugh. It was a joke between the two friends. When Draco wasn’t running from place to place, he was gazing up at the sky, watching the birds.
Then, too, Harry wants his friends to visit, but their attitude towards Draco shows just what they think of him, and Draco’s attitude towards them is little better. So Harry eventually asks them to stay away. Too bad Draco doesn’t seem at all grateful for his sacrifice.
There was just something about the other young man. They’d known each other since the other boy had appeared at the doorstep of the kitchen when the two had been quite young. As children, the two had explored all over the kingdom when Harry had been allowed out to play, their adventures growing in scope and excitement until the day Draco’s father had learned of them, and the adventures had been deemed too dangerous for the Crown Prince, and Harry far too common for Draco to be playing with. After that, they had been watched too closely to be allowed to spend much time together, though Draco had still made certain to seek him out as often as he could manage.
Being called by his last name stung a great deal more than he’d have otherwise expected. “I want to talk to you.”
Finally, Draco shook his head to clear it, then nodded. “All right. Just…let me talk to my parents before you show up, baggage in tow?”
The wizard shook his head sadly. “Unfortunately, that is something I am unable to do. No wizard can completely undo that which another has done. But I can weaken the effects enough until someone can find a way to break the spell, sire. If you will allow?”
Sitting down, Draco folded his hands in his lap, looking down at them. “Because…it left me shaken.” He looked up at Harry, who settled next to him, his arm pulling Draco close.
Draco jumped up, pulling his hand from Potter’s grip, horrified. “No! You…no!” And with that, he ran from the room.
"Of course not," Draco sneered. "Because you'd have to admit I might actually be something other than evil, and that is something you'd never be able to do."
This round ended much the way the first had done, though Draco managed to repress the snort of disgust that had caused the final girl to run off last time.
He'd pulled the bench closer to the bars, so he could see Potter's face better while he talked. He wanted to be able to change the story if he needed to.
"No. I… I mean… Ginny and I… we're not. She's back at Hogwarts, and, well, I told her she should see others. It wasn't fair to her after everything else."
Then Harry nipped at his lip, shifting to nibble down his neck, and Draco forgot all about his worries and fears, arching his neck and grinding harder against Harry as he moaned again. “Oh…yes. Like that…ah…” His fingers slid up to stroke over Harry’s chest, delighting in the groan that tore from him. “More?” he asked in a whisper.
Draco sagged back onto the bed, defeated. That damned cart. His fingers had yet to really heal, and now the blisters that remained would probably break open. He rolled onto his side, away from Potter, and though he thought he’d be up all night, upset, somehow he managed to fall fast asleep almost immediately.
Draco was pleased to finally leave them behind, but the image of that boy draping himself over Potter didn’t leave his mind all weekend.
They walked towards the front gate, Draco stopping in the shade of some bushes as Harry approached. He could tell that the guards were still on high alert from seeing him earlier. However, when Harry approached to talk to one of them, he was waved away. Draco noticed that there were many people on the road, waiting for…something. Why were they just waiting? Why weren’t they letting people in?
“That’s what I said. You’re saying you didn’t…” Potter's honest shock was surprising. If he hadn't done this, then why…?
“Fuck yeah,” Harry said with a smile, one hand settling on the back of Draco’s neck to pull him down into another kiss. “Don’t stop.”
Before Harry could answer, the Minister interrupted him. "Very well, Mister Potter. You will be allowed to speak before we determine Mister Malfoy's sentence." He conjured a chair for Harry to sit in, then once more focused on Draco. "Do you want to say anything before we continue, Mister Malfoy?"
"That useless lump is your cousin?" Draco asked, appalled. He'd never have guessed. The two were so different. Was this boy a Muggle, too?
The other change was the addition of "assignments" for the day, conveyed by the house-elf. Sometimes they were simple tasks—sorting through the books in the library, and boxing up a certain number to donate. Other tasks were more complex, like figuring out the missing line to a potion where it was worn or cut away in the book it was in.
"Never mind. It doesn't matter, Malfoy. You're just…" He met Draco's eyes. "What are you doing? What do you expect to get out of this little story, anyway?"
Draco closed his eyes. Either way, he would lose the chance to know for certain. It was an unfair choice to make. "I can't—"
“Well, I didn’t,” Potter said, and as he turned away to move to the couch across from him, Draco could hear a soft snort. When he looked at Draco once more, his face was calmer, though Draco thought he saw a gleam of interest in his eyes. “What kind of dreams are they? I’m not…hurting you, am I?”
him. "Please… you don't have to remove the spell, if that's what you're worried about. Just… stay and talk. For a bit."
When the two princes—or rather, prince and princess—emerged from “Harriet’s” room once more, the Gryffindor princess looked far more suitable to be the betrothed of the only heir of Slytherin. Her hair had been pulled artfully back from her face, done in braids that wrapped from front to back, then wound into a bun at the back of her head, and set off with sparkling pins that matched some of the trim on her bodice. Her lips were even more lush and full than before, with a soft pink color that made Draco want to smear them with his own lips. Her long, full lashes had been complimented with a soft green-grey shadow that gave her eyes a smoky look and set off their green color even more. Around her throat she wore a simple velvet ribbon that easily hid the Adam's Apple that would have given everything away. And the long velvet dress gave her soft curves that Draco knew for a fact she did not possess. Pansy was a genius.
Draco smiled. “Oh, that one’s of particular interest to me, of course. Given my predilection. But then, I suppose the same is true for you, isn’t it? It’s almost like we’re them, reincarnated. To heal the rift.” Okay, perhaps it was a bit over the top, but there had never been anyone else who he could share his speculation with about the two kings, and now, here was Harry, who obviously believed the same of them. And who was here to marry him.
“Draco? Are you all right, sweetness?” his mother asked when he appeared, brushing some hair from his forehead.
With that, he turned and stormed back to his room, locking the door behind him. He would never be free again. Not unless he took freedom for himself. Let Potter have his kingdom. If there was one thing he’d learned in the past few weeks, it was that he could do anything if he was desperate enough. He’d learned enough to take care of himself now. He didn’t need anyone.
So this note stated that if he wasn't let out for a day, he would commit suicide. He gave them a week to allow it, and then… well, the note made it quite plain Draco would do something drastic.
They both laughed, and with that, the tension from last time faded. "I wasn't sure you'd been up to more. If you haven't—"
At least the other boy seemed to understand the stakes. "Yeah," Draco said softly. He reached out for his hand, needing to comfort as much as he needed the comfort himself, then froze when he felt a hand on his shoulder.
Because there was obviously more to it than even Draco had realized, and with the retellings, the feeling of that last dream was growing inside him. As was the urge to lean over and kiss Harry to find out if it really felt as good as it had in his dreams. “I don’t know…”
“Ah…fuck…Draco…oh…” Harry’s hands settled on Draco’s hips, pulling him down against him as they moved together. “Yeah.”
“Mostly…just feel their emotions. I can always tell when the mares are ready to foal,” he said with a bit of a laugh. “They get so annoyed…”
Finally, at long last, their son was born. Prince Draco was everything the King and Queen had wanted in a child, and they wanted him to have the best of everything, so they sent for the most powerful witches and wizards in their land as well as the neighboring kingdoms, inviting them to a feast in their son’s honor, knowing that each witch and wizard would give the boy gifts that would make him even greater than he was.
"It’s okay, Draco. All you have to do is drink this." Harry handed him the potion, and Draco tossed it down, shuddering at the taste.
Narcissa was telling the girls that there was nothing to worry about, that he was still Prince Draco and that he would not eat them. Draco decided to give them a look at his new form, and see what kind of—awe—it could inspire. He stood up to his full height, stretching his neck out and towering over the others. There were a few shrieks of horror from the girls, but for now, Draco ignored them. He swished his tail a few times, banging it into the tree he knew was behind him, and then, for good measure, he gave his wings a few flaps—just to get out the kinks, of course.
“He’ll follow just fine, Draco. Really. And you can walk with us most of the way, so you could even lead him, if you liked.”
Draco had decided that grand balls should be banished. In fact, he would banish them himself, just as soon as he became king. Especially ones where anyone would be forced to find a bride.
"All right." Harry waved for him to mount the broom, and Draco did, clinging to him, four vials of…something in his hands. He only hoped whoever was helping Harry knew what he was doing…
And why is it that this sight, of all things—his rival and his rival’s fiancée—makes Draco so upset? Why would he care what they do? But he does.
The dishes had seemed simple enough—right until the moment he’d pulled the bowl from the water and noticed that it had food still clinging to it. And not only that, but that there was food along the outside of the stupid thing as well, now. He’d stuck it back in the water, wincing with disgust as he put his hands in the dirty pail with it, then began to try to wipe it clean under the water.
With Harry’s disappearance, Draco’s doubts had started up once more. Had Harry regretted it? Had Draco disappointed him somehow? Worse, had King Lucius found out and done something to Harry?
Soon, though, that wasn't enough, either. Despite being unable to see his host's face, Draco realized he was growing more and more attached to him. Twice he drew close to asking his name again, the other man disappeared and left Draco alone for a full week after. He hadn't done it a third time.
"Who hates me for being here when her daughter isn't! Please!" It wasn't strictly true. Their visit was tense at first, but after some tea, they'd been able to at least focus on what they had in common—Draco's mother. Still, it wasn't the same as talking to someone who actually
Draco flushed. Even though he'd hoped Harry might get the message, he hadn't considered how he might react. "Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you."
Draco decided to plan the next gathering for the middle of the week. Enough time to let Snape relax a little—not that Snape ever relaxed, but at least lull him into a false sense of security—and still far enough from the weekend the professors wouldn't expect it yet.
There was no one to complain to. The elf refused to answer questions. It merely brought him food and cleaned the house before vanishing off to wherever it went at night. Soon Draco began to think the house-elf would be better than nothing.
Draco felt his breath speed up at that. Someone else who suspected the true story behind the feud between their two kingdoms? It was too good to be true. “I…did. I simply didn’t realize any Gryffindor would ever admit to it.”
Draco’s heart rose at that. So long as Harry asked the right questions… He nodded again, this time more eagerly.
Draco looked up to meet those leaf-green eyes that had featured in so many of his dreams. “Then what
"Yes, father," Draco called out the window. "Come on, Harry." Never did he consider his father how his father might react to his new playmate.
Potter seemed to be enjoying them, too. For the third story, he seemed to appear earlier than he had the previous visit. "Here's your supper, Malfoy."
So when father asked, I did the only thing I could do. I set my hope in Potter, just like the rest of the Wizarding World. If I'd been given a chance, I might have done more. But then aunt Bella saw the sword they carried, and everything else was swept aside.
The words made Draco beam at him, and suddenly, it was like no one else was there at all. Draco stepped towards him. “Quite a morning. Wizards, dragons, new friends… Still, at least I haven’t missed the feast. Would you…like to come up and help me change?”
"Draco Malfoy, you are charged with several counts: attempted murder, sedition, being part of a terrorist organization, and use of several Unforgivable Curses. How do you plead?"
Narcissa looked as though she wanted to object, but was scared to discourage the only interest her son had shown in any girl. “Very well, then. I will see you both shortly.”
"Yeah, well even before the Manor, I knew you didn't want this any more than I did, Draco. Which means you deserve help."
Harry bowed. “Majesty. My name is King Harry. I came to celebrate our countries’ alliance and bring your son a gift for his birthday.”
The man halted in the doorway, then turned back to him. "Trust me. You wouldn't want that." Before Draco could say otherwise, the man apparated away.
Draco was quite certain this boy was exactly what father always talked about when he talked about Muggles. So that must mean the other boy must be magic, right? He advanced on the larger one. "You take that back."
Potter snorted. "Why on earth would I? Can't stand the prat. Always bullying me, pushing me around. One of the best things to happen this year was getting away from the Dursleys."
Fingers swept across his forehead, and he opened eyes he hadn’t even realized he’d closed, looking up into Harry’s worried eyes. “Hurts?” he asked. Draco didn’t bother with words, just nodded. Harry kissed him again, then shifted and took him in hand, pulling a moan from him.
There was once a King and Queen who wanted nothing more than a child. They tried so many things, but finally, just as they were about to give up, an old and very powerful wizard offered them help in conceiving their child. The couple gratefully accepted, and soon the Queen became pregnant, and they and their people celebrated.
The guards his mother had obviously stationed at the princess’s door were easily enough distracted with a spell, and soon he was closing the door to her bedroom. “Harry?”
Something told Draco Harry might have other reasons, and now they weren't facing the Headmistress any longer, he couldn't keep from asking. "But you could have gotten in trouble with me. I mean, you don't know why I did it."
With a beaming smile, Blaise bowed to his prince. “Then I should set out immediately, if I am to marry her any time soon,” he said with a smile.
It was hard to keep his face from going red, Draco looked away again. "Yeah, well…you didn’t dream it. And you weren’t the one so badly used, either."
He pulled out the bowls, then dished himself out a spoonful to taste it, smiling when the taste of the food he’d been imagining crossed his palate.
Harry scowled. "Like they'd ever waste that kind of money on me. They always left me with someone when they went on holiday. Why do you care? Trying to find more to taunt me with?"
Draco managed not to let his relief show at that. Snape didn’t know. The relief gave him courage. “I assure you, Snape, if I marry Princess Harriet, that will not happen. I have fought too hard to find an appropriate bride. I would not be so stupid to throw everything away.” And then, before Snape could continue to berate him, he turned away and made his way to his own rooms.
Draco supposed it was true. "I guess that makes sense. It seems silly not knowing for sure who you are."
Harry managed to open his eyes meeting Draco’s eyes, but Draco knew neither of them would last long, so he pulled his hand away.
He made his way down to the courtyard to see if he could find Weasley, and was astonished when he saw his father’s guards ride into the yard. He knew that his father couldn’t be too far behind, and the thought lightened his heart. He smiled and greeted the guards by name, not even noticing the shocked looks the men were giving him in his delight that he would soon be able to return home.
Draco took the stallion’s reins, then led it after the cart, not sure what to make of the man who had helped him more in one day than the man he was to marry had since the moment they’d met. What he was sure of was that he
“Yes.” Harry leaned down to kiss him, and then the fingers were gone, and something else took their place. The pressure was intense, and Draco clung to Harry, the pleasant feeling of need he’d had before doused in the pain. He couldn’t help but hope that the feeling that he was about to be torn apart was just part—a very small part—of the First time, and that it would fade. When Harry stilled once more, and the burning had only faded a bit, Draco whimpered. This couldn’t really be It, could it? This was what everyone craved so much?
There seemed to be a bit of electricity between them at the words. Even Harry seemed excited. “You mean…he’s…human?”
Draco had kissed before. Had done a good deal more, in fact. But this was like nothing he’d ever experienced before, and without his own urgings, he found his own hands going up to thread in Potter’s hair, pressing against him as they kissed.
When Draco entered the chosen room during lunch break, he found himself even more nervous than usual. This could all go incredibly wrong. What if he hated him even more than he might have before all this? What if he wasn't even Potter? Would it matter? Should it? After all, they got on well.
Harry looked at him sadly. "I can’t take you with me. She’s obviously enchanted the room to keep you here. Which means we’ll need to make our own door. And for that, I’ll need something else. I promise to be back before nightfall, okay?"
He really wasn’t a pet. He was a man. A very creepy man. She called him "Fenny." They both seemed to find that funny. Draco wasn’t sure what the joke was. To be honest, the man scared him. All the more because when Draco didn’t do as the witch asked, she threatened to let Fenny play with him. Whatever else, Draco knew he didn’t want that to happen.
to him, at least. Even just that he wanted to talk to him elsewhere. But not this…not ignoring him all evening. This was ridiculous! Potter had said he would explain! Throwing his napkin on the table, he got up and stormed after him. “Potter!”
They fell into a pattern. His host would generally join him Tuesdays and Thursdays, and after a short while, he began joining him on Sundays as well. They kept their talk on the news of the day or the latest potion Draco was working on. It was comfortable.
The Minister nodded. He flipped through a few more pages, and Draco waited for him to mention Dumbledore's death.
Harriet grunted. “Two older brothers. At least this way I have a hope of having some sort of effect on the world at large.” She shot Draco a look, and those green eyes caught Draco once more. “Unless you don’t intend to share power with the one you marry?”
This reverie was broken when Harry appeared, leading two horses—Draco’s own stallion, Egan, and a docile mare that Harry was allowed to use for his own needs that he had named Lily. “All ready, Hi—Draco. Shall we?”
“Of course, Draco,” Potter said, far too pleasantly. He settled in under the covers, and fell easily into sleep. Draco watched him with a scowl before rolling on his side and away from him so he wouldn’t have to see him.
The other man smiled, then pulled a small stick from his back that he enlarged into a broom. "I’ll be right up!"
Draco scowled at a point over Snape's shoulder. He couldn't. Not yet. "I understand. Sir," he said, voice stiff.
Sounded like excuses to Draco. Whatever reason Potter had for doing this, it would be over as soon as the King returned. And really, aside from what little he had to do for his own survival? He refused to do any more of Potter’s ridiculous chores. Especially the ones for the king and his betrothed.
“You certainly seemed popular,” Harry said softly, a note in his voice that Draco had never heard before.
"I mean, come live with us. We won't call you a freak, I promise." He held out his hand. "My name's Draco. What's yours?"
At one point, when he had been younger, he had asked her who she was, and she said she was his auntie, and that she had taken him to raise as a favor to her sister. Draco personally refused to believe this, but he kept any guesses as to the truth to himself. He didn’t want her to let Fenny play with him. Ever.
Draco snorted and shoved at him. “Not funny. You see how you like it when someone is trying to force
“God, no. Your mother insisted. Said I would have to be comfortable for my first night here. Particularly if I was to become her daughter-in-law.” He made a face at that. “Hold on. I’ll come down.”
Potter flushed again. “I’ll have Ron show you up to your room. And send someone to draw you up a bath. And retrieve your mattress.”
Finally, he took his broom and went out flying again. It was almost enough to distract him. Except for the flash of green eyes that he kept seeing every time he let himself relax. What the hell was wrong with him, anyway?
It would have been funny to see the expression on his face if it hadn’t been so serious. “Who could I trust the way I trust you, Harry?” Draco put his hand on Harry’s arm, wanting to keep that contact now that he’d had a taste.
She waved off the girl, who looked disappointed, but left the throne room with a curtsey. Once she was out of sight, Queen Narcissa turned to her son. “You have been putting this off for far too long, Draco. You are nearly twenty.”
Finally, Lucius nodded. “Very well, Draco. But remember—the future of our kingdom rests on your decision. Be very certain you choose not only what is best for you, but also what is best for them.”
"Because now we both have a chance. To be something more than what people expected us to be. Maybe even to be friends?" He held out his hand, and now, the bitter memory of a similar moment on the first train ride to Hogwarts tempered with a fonder memory.
"Right." The problem was, now he had the chance, he didn't know what to tell Potter. "Um… did you want to hear anything in particular?"
He stopped abruptly in the doorway of the chamber when he saw Harry sitting on his bed, dressed only in leggings and a loose shirt now, which made Draco wish it were tighter; or better still, completely gone.
If Lucius’s eyebrow could have climbed any higher, it would have. “And why would I let that happen, Draco? You are betrothed, are you not? I was under the impression I was here for a wedding?”
The pressure from his parents to find a bride was increasing. And Draco truly didn’t know what to do about it. They weren’t really in a rush to be grandparents. No, the issue was more complex than that. They wanted him to come into his power in a controlled way. It needed to happen before his twenty-first birthday, when his chance to achieve his power could be lost forever. And since the one he slept with would forever after have a connection to whatever power Draco gained in consequence, they wanted to be assured that the person he was with was well under their control. It would be a true disaster should someone seduce the crown prince and forever after be able to manipulate him because of it.
Potter seemed sad, and sighed. “Look…” He shook his head. “I really do need a shower. Let me do that, then I’ll meet you in the sitting room across the hall from our rooms?”
“I do not see it that way, Majesty. I see it as a chance to reconcile our families. After all, they were once quite friendly, were they not?”
“We’ll be right behind,” Moony assured him with a smile. The two men waved, then Draco gathered himself and sprang into the air, hoping that Harry had a good grip. At least it was a quick flight, he thought to himself.
So many answers came to Draco in response. It was easy to reject some, but others not as much. “And your friends? My family?”
Draco's gaze didn't move from Shacklebolt's. "Yes. Either under command from Lord Voldemort or the Carrows, sir."
And that was where Draco’s dreams always cut off. After all, he had no clue what two people did together in that sort of situation. Let alone two men. He knew it had to be much more complicated, then.
His host was silent for too long after, and Draco was about to shout at him again when he finally spoke. "No. Never completely alone. Though I felt like it sometimes. Is it truly so bad?"
All Draco could do was hope he was right. He’d flown so far already. Whoever these three were, they were his last chance. He took a deep breath, and stepped out from under the cover of the trees he’d been hiding in to listen.
“How should I know that, Potter? I can’t get into your head!” Draco felt brittle and ready to snap. If Potter was having this much trouble with the first story… “Look…forget I said anything. I should go,” he said, standing up.
But the moral isn't Hope can destroy evil. Quite often, the two exist side by side, one never touching the other. No, the true moral is so long as Hope exists, evil will never win.
Draco blinked. She wouldn't punish them? Before he could say anything, though, Harry was tugging at his sleeve. Draco glanced at him, then nodded. As they left the hall, he shot a last look at Snape, the man fuming at not being given the chance to crucify them all.
“Over here.” Draco heard Harry’s voice coming from just around the bend in the path, so he moved forward to see him, smiling at first, but then stood agape as he saw the new clothes that Harry was wearing. “Look at you…wow.” Not that Harry had been difficult to look at before, but this outfit was even more flattering than the black one from the night before had been. It matched the green of his eyes almost perfectly, except for the fact that it was a few shades darker.
Before an hour was up, he’d had enough dancing, and headed for the gardens once more, hope high in his heart. He waited to call out until he’d closed the doors behind him. “Harry?”
Finally, Draco’d had enough. It had only been a week, but he needed to get away. He went to spend the weekend at Blaise’s, not bothering to let anyone know.
“No! I have put up with your tantrums and insults to our guests long enough. You will marry who I say. And I say you will marry the next man to come through those doors, be he peasant or king.”
The first came in the form of his aunt Andromeda, who Draco had never seen but from afar, or in the few pictures his mother owned of her from when they were young.
Narcissa cleared her throat, and the two looked back at her once more, both chastised. “So…a…joint interest, Draco?”
When he'd arrived, he'd been taken to one of the interrogation chambers, but after only a few questions, they decided he knew very little, so he'd spent the rest of his time in a cell, waiting his turn to be told he would spend the rest of his life in Azkaban.
"I said so, didn't I? So long as you don't attempt to figure out who I am. I won't tell you, so don't ask."
Harry stayed silent for a long time before answering. “We were kids, Draco. I’d say…a few things have changed since then. At least…I’d like to think so.”
The next morning, he woke up in his own bed. He had no memory of the other boy or even their visit to the beach that summer.
Those green eyes met his once more, and Draco allowed himself to believe that what he saw in them was hope. “Really? Me? But…”
Draco’s head turned quickly to where Harry had been standing. But he was gone. "No…" He hurried down the steps after him.
Draco wasn’t sure if his friend was wishing him luck in finding someone, or in surviving the ball entirely. “Thank you. I’ll need it.” He smiled, then turned and headed back inside.
Draco’s eyes widened even as he took the man’s hand. No wonder he felt it necessary to protect the king’s interest, if he were so personally connected to the king. It must be why he was worried about the way Potter was treating him, as well.
The blond seems not to want to answer, but he has been caught peeking, so he nods at the happy couple. “Potter. Weasley. I hear congratulations are in order?”
Ignoring his growling stomach, he used magic on each long strip of cloth, then folded them and returned them to the baskets, more pleased than he had been with the work than that he’d done the day before. Then he started on the napkins, finishing the last just in time to pack it away as Potter walked through the gate.
“I’m fine, Potter. Don’t worry about me. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?” Potter was correct, of course, but even so, Draco wasn’t about to tell him that.
Draco waited until nearly midnight before sneaking out to see ‘her.’ All he could do now was hope that his mother hadn’t said something to scare Harry off. The longer he knew him, the more fascinating he found him. And he found himself hoping he would get to know him a great deal better.
Draco saw Weasley at the end of the hall, glaring at him as well. Granger looked ready to hex him, and Potter didn’t look much more pleasant than the other two. “Can we talk somewhere more private?” Draco asked.
Draco turned away. Potter wasn’t the sort to prevaricate easily, so it really looked like this wasn’t some sort of trick. “I know. But…not…not in my dreams.”
The man looked at him as if he were mad. “Potter?” There was a long pause. “Wait…the little run-down hut? That’s barely standing? He’s making you live there?”
Draco sighed. “Fine. I can have the elves prepare you a room in the guest wing, I suppose. Shouldn’t take too lo—”
Every possible solution felt more hopeless than the last. Now he knew nothing would convince him to return.
Draco nodded. He didn't want Potter getting in trouble. That would only mean he couldn't come watch him any longer, after all. "Okay. See you soon, then?"
At first there was nothing, but just as Draco was about to give up and try something else, he saw a flicker out of the corner of his eyes. Silvery blue. He tried the same motion again, pleased when he saw the tip of a wing appear. The question was, could he use them? After all, flying wasn’t something one did every day. Not as a human, anyway.
Harry had found a spot on the top of Draco’s head, and was scratching it in a way that was utter perfection. Draco leaned into his hand, but hadn’t realized he was making any noise until Harry’d said something. He blinked at the young man, then tried for a smile before realizing his face just didn’t work that way any longer.
"I'll let you know." He was watching Draco now, which made him nervous. He covered his reaction by settling at the table in the centre of the room. The chair wasn't comfortable, but at least it wasn't his bunk. He tried to be grateful for the change of scenery. Even if it was just more grey walls.
Narcissa was waiting for them, seated upon her throne, her closest advisor, Minister Snape, at her shoulder. He shot a look at Harriet, then whispered to the queen, and her eyes narrowed.
Blaise turned and looked in the direction Draco was glaring and upon seeing Potter, he let out a laugh. “Oh, come on, Draco. He can’t be that bad, can he?”
“No. Not exactly. But…I think he’ll be gone, either way.” Or at least, he hoped so. If he was here much longer, Draco was certain he’d have to kill the git.
This process was repeated with the second and third girls, with no discernable effect. As the last remaining girl approached, Draco couldn’t help but give a sigh, which resulted in another cloud of smoke that enveloped the girl, and with a shriek, she hurried after the girls who had already failed and left.
“He’s not. I just…” Harry looks around, as though he hopes Draco will pop out and shout ‘surprise!’ but he does not. “I wanted to talk to you about him.”
But as days pass, see the news articles appear. Each is greeted with greater temper by the Malfoy heir, and soon he can stand it no longer. Watch as he dresses to kill—he so wishes it could be literally, but he knows that he cannot.
Until the day the house elf didn't come with the food. Harry did. Not his host, a shadow with no face or distinguishing features, but a Harry, who looked distinctly rumpled with dark circles under his eyes.
After supper, Draco was separated from his prospective bride by Minister Snape and his mother. Narcissa took Harriet’s arm and led her off to her rooms, talking to her so quietly that Draco couldn’t hear a word. All he could do was hope that Harriet would manage to answer her well.
Draco snuck out in the wee hours of the morning and returned to his room for a long bath, quite relaxed.
Draco looked up to see not only his mother, but his father storming towards them. He jumped off Harry’s lap, then looked down at himself, and back at Harry before facing his father once more, a wide grin on his face. “It worked!”
It took him a bit to be certain of the house, but once he was, he walked up the steps confidently. He only hoped the circles under his eyes weren’t too obvious. He clacked the knocker against the door, harder than he might have otherwise, then waited for Potter to answer. He kept his breathing steady, though he did jump a little when the door opened.
Draco wasn't about to say he'd already guessed, so instead he nodded. "Of course. Can I ask why you won't stay here with me? Or are we all being kept this way?" After all, maybe this was part of the punishment.
Have you heard the legend of Pandora? The one about the girl who opens the box and lets all the evil out into the world? That's me. I'm her. I'm Pandora. I'm the one who let the evil into Hogwarts. The evil which caused Dumbledore's death.
“Isn’t it obvious?” Potter looked so earnest, but Draco’s head was spinning, and all he could see were those bright green eyes.
“Of course, Prin—Draco,” Harry said with a small grin as he corrected himself, and Draco felt himself smile wider in return. “I’ll saddle up one of the other horses as well. Shouldn’t take me too long.” He disappeared into the stables, and Draco settled on the bench Harry had been sitting on with a soft sigh.
She smiled. "Once, Draco, your mother and I used to be close. I hope we will be again. But you shouldn't thank me. I hadn't even considered it. Not until Harry suggested it."
Finally, Draco tried the only thing he could. He sought out Potter. It took him a few days, because he refused to go anywhere near the Weasleys’ hut, so he had to stake out the Ministry and hope he would run into Potter there.
Harry met his eyes. "I've always been on my own. I never thought about what it would be like to be completely alone. I should have worked out something, Draco. I realize it's too late for a simple apology, but I'm here to give it a shot."
Draco slumped by the fountain. What was he going to do? Even if he’d wanted to explain to his parents how this had happened…it was still his fault. After all, if he’d done what they’d wanted, he’d never have been out here in the first place. But he wouldn’t even be able to do that. The first glimpse of him they got, they’d likely try to kill him.
The dark wizard turned to glare at the man who had spoken, then laughed. “Dumbledore? Are you their protector now? Go home, old man. Your power is fading. You can’t save them.”
Draco shook his head. Even if he'd wanted to defend himself, there was no true defense for his actions.
Draco felt a sharp flash of annoyance—and possibly something else—lash through him. “No! You’ve been hounding me this whole time, and…I don’t understand. What do you want from me?”
Oh, to be sure, they think I've more than earned a trip to Azkaban, but they see me only as a minor irritant. A boy from a pure-blood family, twisted to his family's needs.
Something seemed to light in Weasley’s eyes, and his lips twitched. “Draco. We should get back to work if we’re to get this all to the palace by nightfall, though.”
Though he struggled to return to his dreams, he found it hard to sleep in the days that followed. Perhaps he'd slept too much. Instead, he began exercising and organizing the house, moving the books from shelf to shelf, rearranging them in alphabetical order, then again by size.
On a far hill, in the tallest, most crooked tower in the land, there lived a very lonely young man named Draco. He knew he must be a prince, though he could not remember his parents. He had to be. Why else would the witch have captured him and taken him from them? All he knew was this tower and the witch who visited him here, and the "pet" that she often brought with her.
Draco didn’t want him to go. Or rather, he didn’t want to be left behind. But since he had no choice… "All right. I’ll see you soon?"
Draco was more prepared the next time Potter came to bring him supper. He'd been thinking more about what he could tell him, and what he could ask. Sometimes, though, he wished he could write it all down. It would make telling the stories easier.
Bella’s words buzzing in his ears, Draco squeezed his eyes closed, throwing the last potion. He heard her scream and drop away, and felt Harry swoop around her, then zoom away. But he found he could no longer open his eyes. He just clung to Harry, waiting for the end to come. Either they would land in the Palace, and his life would change forever, or Bella and Fenrir would take him, and he would become like Fenrir—until Bella became bored with him and replaced him, apparently.
"You are smarter than this, Draco. Don't go against me. Now, the parties will cease immediately. Are we clear?"
The clerk hurried down from his place below the Minister, with papers for each of them to sign, and Draco had to fight a shaking hand to manage his signature, still not sure they would let him walk out of here without ever being sent to Azkaban.
“I won’t. I just…” He fumbled with his own trousers now, pushing them down then pressed down against Harry, which drew a strangled moan from both of them.
Draco looked up into those green eyes that he’d always hated because they had always glared at him before now, even though they were a colour he knew Potter would never properly appreciate himself. “I don’t know. I’ve…never had to choose. That choice was taken from me.”
The two boys looked at him with shockingly similar expressions, but neither spoke, so Draco tried again. "Is he sick?"
After dinner one night, almost a month after Potter had first arrived, Draco knocked at the door between their rooms. “Potter?”
The solution came to him in the form of a six-foot, two-inch young man with long black hair and golden eyes and skin. This vision’s name was Blaise, and he was Draco’s personal guard. Upon seeing his prince’s dejected countenance, he moved to walk next to him. “Another?” he asked him as they passed the serpent-headed fountain at the centre of the garden.
Draco ignored the sour expression on Robards' face, then turned to his aunt. "And thank you for helping me this way."
This latest one, Daphne something or other, seemed even more brainless than his mother’s usual finds. Even as she answered the questions they asked her, his estimation of her intelligence shrank.
Then Harry was behind him, a hand on his back, and it was all Draco could do not to turn and curl into his embrace. “No. But my parents…”
”At the end of the ball, yes.” Lucius’s lips thinned. He obviously knew Draco was hiding something, but had no clue as to what.
By the time the sun had sunk halfway towards evening once more, Draco was finding it hard to breathe. If Harry didn’t come soon… He began to pace in front of the window, glancing out at the woods every so often, hoping for a glimpse of his new friend flying back toward him to help free him.
Still, it was one thing to know he had to talk to Potter. It was quite another to gather his nerve to do so. He knew where the prat lived, of course. It was the Blacks’ ancestral home, after all. Not something Potter could truly keep from him. But facing him…how could he do that? Just the thought made his throat close, the memory of the dreams returning far too quickly. Not to mention he was certain to get a less-than friendly reception when he arrived unannounced.
Harry seemed surprised at the name, then looked thoughtful. "You’ve…been here your whole life?" he asked slowly.
Draco knew what that meant. It meant if Fenrir arrived and the smell was at least as strong, if not stronger, that worse than what Bella could do herself would likely happen. He swallowed. "Yes, aunt Bella," he said softly. The two vanished once more, and Draco curled into a ball on his bed. Could things get any worse?
“No, that’s all right. I’ll be right up,” Draco said with a smile, then cast a quick levitation charm on himself to make himself float, then used the edges of the mattresses to pull himself up to the top. He didn’t think to wonder what his mother was up to. He was more intent on seeing more of those green eyes and full lips again. Finally, he pulled himself over the edge of the bed, then settled next to Harry.
Which meant he still hadn't confessed the night Professor Snape interrupted their party. Worse, Draco was the one he managed to catch.
My suggestion was accepted gleefully. After all, he only ever managed to get one spy into Hogwarts. This would give him as much access as he wished, any time he wished. But it was not enough for him, even despite being a great advantage. No, he had another task for me. One that chilled me to the core—Kill Dumbledore.
After Draco finished, he watched Harry's face silently, waiting for his reaction, worried the longer it took for him to do so.
The words were enough to pull Draco out of his daze. Shifting, he scowled and rolled his eyes. “Oh, dear god, Potter. Starting off that way hardly lends me confidence…”
Draco sighed, then nodded. Hopefully by tomorrow, Harry would have rescued him. He had to hope for that now. "I will see you then?"
Draco stood there awkwardly, not sure if he should greet the man. He was rather wary of strangers, especially ones as ragged as this one.
"The guy I spent all my time with at the parties." For the first time, Harry seemed uncertain. "I know we never got on ever. It was why I kept putting it off. And then Snape came in before I could tell you, and—"
“You do realize those are your only shoes, right?” Potter asked cheerily from the fireplace, where he was stirring up a pot.
Draco glanced at him, then back to the two he knew were his parents. Their robes were quite luxurious from what he could see, and now he knew why Harry had brought him to the palace. He was the son of the king and queen.
“That’s impossible! Who would possibly fit both mother’s wishes and my needs? No man in his right mind would pretend to be a woman for the rest of his life!”
“Oh, right!” She stuck out her hand to be shaken as though she were a man. “Tonks. At your service, sire. Or…is it majesty?”
Lucius seemed to be considering this when Potter appeared. “Ah, King Lucius. It is good to see you again.”
There was something dark in the man’s responding smile. “In a way. I was simply here to meet you, precious Prince. Eighteen today, is it not?”
Draco glanced up from the parchment he was writing on. "Thanks. You've already gone round?" he asked, surprised.
“Right, Potter,” Draco sneered. He knew that Potter had somehow planned this, but he wasn’t about to say so. “We were just leaving, anyway.”
“No! I…would have done the same with anyone!” The truth was, he’d never been the sort to snuggle in his sleep, but he had to find some excuse for his behavior that Potter would believe.
Harriet stumbled on the step at that, and Draco thought he saw a blush spread across her cheeks. “Are you all right?” he asked.
“All right, then.” Yes, this year definitely was shaping up to be at least as difficult as the previous two.
Draco swallowed, then met his eyes. "The cabinet was half of a pair. Once working, if one entered one cabinet, one would be transported immediately to the other. The…several Death Eaters—"
“Draco?” Draco turned to glare at him, and Potter dropped his hand. But the touch wasn’t what had really upset him. Potter calling him by hi first name was something he had to discourage
But apparently Harry could. “Good. Does that mean I can take this off, now, Draco?” he asked in his normal voice, pulling off his wig.
"I thought it would be simplest in the long run. You'd be comfortable, and without any preconceived notions of how I might treat you."
The night Draco set as his deadline, he set out a potion next to his bed before dropping off to sleep. It was only a headache potion, but if taken in high enough quantity, it could cause death. He woke to a footstep outside his door, but feigned unconsciousness, waiting to see if his host would come in, or stay outside. He heard a whispered spell, and saw the room grow faintly brighter as his host entered.
The first few minutes felt like an hour all on their own, and finally Draco set a timer spell, just to stop himself from checking the clock every five minutes.
Swallowing, Draco nodded. He couldn't offer a defense against that. After all, he'd used the spell. Did it really matter why?
So who did she know who would be able to convince her? The Minister, perhaps? And at least some of the Order. No, that was already too many people. He took out a sheet of parchment and listed off names of those who fit. Who was left from the Order? He could at least cross of the girls. His visitor was definitely a man. It didn't decrease the list much, though.
"Don't ask questions, Malfoy." Harry didn't even bother looking at him, but kept his gaze on Shacklebolt. "I'm sure, Kingsley. I can handle him."
Draco blinked rapidly, barely fighting back the prickling in his eyes. This was utterly horrific. He couldn’t live this way! “May…I send a letter to my father?”
They’d brought him food, but the only thing he’d been able to stomach was the roast that the kitchen had been roasting for the feast that night, which had made Draco a bit embarrassed, but then, he’d been doing quite a bit this morning, and he’d needed it. When his stomach had rumbled, the ground had literally trembled. He’d heard his father send out the hunters. They had enough for the feast that night—just barely—but it would mean that there was nothing left in the stores after.
