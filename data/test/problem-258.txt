Harry nodded, understanding – he had passed so many nights sat alone in his living room just watching the night sky turn orange and pink.
The sound of the door opening crashed him out of his thoughts and he looked up to see a tall elderly woman bustle into the shop and head to the counter. A few minutes, she sat at Harry’s table, opposite him, and introduced herself as Suzanne. She was the village librarian, and she’d met Cressida several times, apparently.
Harry thought back to a case about six months ago, when a young French witch had made multiple obvious passes at Malfoy, and coincidentally Harry had instantly hated her.
As Bellchant bought his coffee from a muggle-born Auror in disguise, Malfoy faked a phone call to his girlfriend and Ron aimed his apple core at a bin, threw, and missed. The six year old girl kicked it merrily as she passed by with her mother on the way to drop some change in Scratch’s cup. As planned, he grinned at her, and she shied away at the sight of his teeth.
Countless memories started to flash through their minds, but some stood out – Harry’s nightmare of slashed bodies and sprayed blood made both men flinch. Ron followed this thread of violence and pain and found himself watching Harry’s wand streaming green towards black-hooded figures, and then saw Greyback’s hunched form crouched over Lavender, and then saw Voldemort’s screaming face looming.
Harry greeted the figure, recognising Susan, but there was no response as she turned in circles, looking around the room.
“No, I’d have mentioned. She never replied to my letter, and after a few days I filed her missing, after trying to contact her via Floo.”
As the four young adults stood in a circle around a Portkey and a large map of England, Harry had a sinking feeling that whatever came next would be bad – it might be the coffee, he knew, but there was a bitter taste in his mouth and his heart was fluttering. Hermione and Ron finished reciting the spell and the Portkey glowed, turning everything upside down as the group flew halfway across the country.
Harry vaguely wondered if it would be rude to ask what Malfoy’s sexual orientation was (he’d never mentioned it and Harry had never thought much about it before) but decided that it would be too awkward and intrusive.
He’d had four years to make it homely, and he loved it – there was no true colour scheme, no themes, but everything in it was his. He’d packed it full of souvenirs he’d collected on his travels – porcelain figures, colourful rugs, ornate lamps, ancient jewellery and much more. In the first few years after they’d won the war, he’d been invited to meet key figures from every Ministry of Magic across the world, and he’d delighted in the freedom – he’d come home from every trip with a souvenir for each of his friends, and three more for himself. As heir to the Potter and Black fortunes, and with his Auror salary, he had more than enough money, and he knew it was terribly materialistic to want things, but when he stood in the doorway of his flat and saw what was entirely his own, he almost forgot about the cupboard under the stairs.
“I only found the one memory of casting the Sectumsempra, and that was of Malfoy. The dream was, as far as I can tell, just a dream.”
Harry quickly followed, and couldn’t help the gasp that escaped him at the sight of Malfoy’s bedroom.
“Potter, you haven’t changed your face shape at all.” Malfoy hesitated, then gripped Harry’s chin, not ungently, twisting his face up and sideways towards him. “Here, let me do it.”
“Yeah, that’s me.” Harry paused. He didn’t want to seem rude, but he really didn’t want to make any new friends right now. Even tall, attractive men didn’t hold much of an interest for some reason.
“I don’t let anyone in. All my friends are people I met when I was eleven, when everything was new and shiny and exciting. I’m terrified to let anyone in in case they’ll see how broken I am.”
Harry woke up screaming. His mind was filled with pools of blood and cut up faces and voices howling in pain. He lay on his back, panting, crying, for a long while, trying to understand his nightmare, but only one thought kept returning – he’d just dreamt of casting the Sectumsempra curse on multiple people, and it had felt like real memories. Was it possible the Elder Wand had won? Could he be the one killing those werewolves without knowing?
Malfoy shot Harry’s receding back with a helpless glance and followed Hermione away. Although Harry had warned him, he hadn’t believed in Ginny and Luna’s wackiness, or in Hermione’s perfectionism. She had said at least five times so far today “it has to be perfect, or you’re doing it again.” It was almost enough to drive a man mad, except how could he be mad when they loved him enough to want him there?
It was the use of his first name that shocked Harry into replying – he and Malfoy so rarely used their given names in this strange friendship of theirs.
As Bellchant offered Scratch a pastry, making friendly small talk, Harry knew that Hermione, watching from the clock tower, was quickly casting an anti-Apparate spell. They couldn’t make their move until she’d finished and given them a signal, and so Scratch patiently accepted the pastry, grunting as he scarfed it down.
There was a strange thumping sound in the next room and both men jumped up – Malfoy whipped his wand out of his sleeve holster and looked on curiously as Harry, panicked, double checked that his wand was still stuffed in his pocket under his robes. Both wizards approached the door and Harry stepped back as Malfoy carefully eased it open. Malfoy let out a loud laugh and Harry stuck his head into the room, coming face to face with an elderly grey cat that had clearly just knocked over a large stack of books.
Harry paused at the fireplace, looking back into the rapidly darkening room at Malfoy, sat alone at the table, and flicked his fingers, lighting the lamps in the corners of the room. Not waiting to see how Malfoy reacted, he stepped through the green fire.
It was a scathing review of a really rather nice bloke, but Harry felt particularly ruthless in that moment – Connor had moved from America several years before, and hadn’t been involved with the war that had so affected Harry. Harry knew he could never be involved with somebody that didn’t truly understand what he’d been through.
“He’s too…flashy for me. Besides, I can’t date a professional Quidditch player, can I? They’d inevitably come up against Ginny, and obviously I support her. She’d thrash them on the pitch and they’d never forgive me.” Harry joked, turning his attention to the pan of boiling water and home-made spaghetti in front of him. Neville quickly sobered up and watched Harry’s actions.
“Yes, but not just that. Look at this bit – she says she thinks werewolves are being murdered.” Malfoy replied. “Actually, she calls them people with lycanthropy, which I think is a term she’s trying to get legalised, but that’s beside the point.”
“You can’t just use it whenever you want. It infects you. It…I dream of it at night, I think about it all day.” Harry clenched his fists together and rubbed his eyes. “You’ve heard the story, Malfoy. It wasn’t a gift, it was a curse!” Harry turned to Hermione, imploring her to step in.
They had ruled out the three before, deciding they were incredibly unpleasant, but unlikely killers. Each unsuccessful visit had put Harry more on edge, as though something was on the tip of his tongue and he couldn’t quite remember what. A dark, unnerving thought was stirring inside him. Trying to shrug off the feeling, Harry reach out and knocked.
Harry took the notebook and set about copying across the information, noting grumpily that Malfoy’s handwriting was perfect on every single page – elegant calligraphy compared to Harry’s chicken-scratch.
“To the best of friendships.” Hermione spoke softly, smiling at both Ron and Harry, who both grinned back.
Harry startled, uncomfortable. He resisted the urge to sniff for this apparent stench, instead focusing on dampening the fire inside of him. Ginny had once mentioned that his magic felt like fire when it spilled over, and he’d been self-conscious ever since.
“I didn’t say anything, actually. You interpreted my silence yourself.” Harry regretted it as he said it – it was sarcastic and rude – totally not appropriate, but Malfoy ignored it, face changing in a blink of an eye as he realised. His eyes lit up.
Harry quickly explained his nightmare and the generalities of his and Malfoy’s case – Ron had been an excellent Auror before heading up the Strategic and Tactical Analysis department, and if anyone could understand, it would be him. Ron listened in silence to Harry’s worries and fears, face unusually grave.
Ron cheered, throwing the pillow in the air, which hit Harry firmly in the face, who, laughing, cried out “Oi!”
“Dickhead! There’s no emergency, we’ve got a case we think you’ll want to be involved with.” Harry patted the top of her head awkwardly as she panted, and she snorted slightly.
The crowd fell back into a low rumble of noise as soon as Pansy and Blaise, now husband and wife, started to make the rounds, greeting all their friends individually. Some looked terribly upset not to have gotten them a wedding gift; Hermione was included in this group, of course, although Ron did his best to persuade her they wouldn’t mind.
Hermione talked a little about her pregnancy, which Harry had admittedly not thought much about recently, and he was glad to hear she and the baby were doing well so far. Ron looked proud enough to burst.
“No, only once she was already in Northumberland. She wrote to me and explained that she’d come across something I needed to know about, and I should let her know when I was available to meet her.”
“It’s the most powerful wand ever created. It could make a bad wizard far, far worse, and it could make even a good person bad. If I don’t use it, no-one can.”
“Oh, of course. I anticipated this, actually, so I’ve written out a few things that you might need.” She handed over a large pile of parchment.
Neville and Calliope were also on the dancefloor, trying to imitate Dean and Seamus’s bizarre chicken dance. Everyone in the vicinity could hardly control their laughter at the sight of four adults clucking like chicken.
Harry stood up, furious. It had been a long time since someone he cared about had believed the lies the Prophet told on a regular basis – since fifth year, in fact, when people had refused to believe Voldemort was back. It hurt more than he would have expected, not to be trusted.
“If you guys ever want any advice or anything…” Ron offered. “Hermione’s got a few folders with all our wedding information in it.”
“You could stay here, if you wanted to.” He sounded very casual as he said it, but Harry thought (hoped) he could hear something nervous in his voice.
Neither said anything for a long time. Harry didn’t know what Malfoy was thinking, but he couldn’t help but feel responsible – someone must have known they’d interviewed Susan again, and had killed her before she could talk. She had suffered for a long time before she’d died – there had been an immense amount of pain, he was sure. Finally, he forced himself to look away.
In each corner of the ballroom was a huddle of gold and silver balloons, streaming a shower of tiny stars that didn’t seem to puddle on the floor – an impressive piece of spell work. Streamers hung from the high arched ceiling, coloured silver and pale pink, shimmering gently. Huge bouquets of white and pink flowers were dotted around the room, and Harry could smell their sweet fragrance.
“Of course I have, Potter, what do you take me for?” For a moment Malfoy looked as though he was going to say something else, but instead he pulled open the door to The King’s Head and ushered Harry into the warmth.
Ron and Hermione embraced, and Harry realised again that, surrounded as he was by all his friends, he was the only single one amongst them. But although that thought tugged at his heart, he couldn’t help but feel the same joy that Pansy and Blaise, spinning in circles in each other’s arms, were clearly feeling.
Harry looked sideways at Malfoy’s fourth glass, half finished, and fished it out of his hand, downing it himself. Malfoy, mock-outraged, jabbed him in the side and Harry shifted out of the way, smirking. Malfoy wrinkled his nose at Harry and returned to his conversation with Ron, and Harry relaxed back into the chair, realising a moment too late he’d slumped too close to Malfoy – their arms and thighs were pressed against each other. Flushing with embarrassment, Harry didn’t shy away, thinking it would be too rude, and besides, Malfoy was probably too drunk to have noticed anyway.
“You don’t want to be disarmed.” Malfoy realised, eyes widening as he looked between Harry’s pained face and the wands on the table. Harry hadn’t realised it, but his hand had crept across the table to lay protectively over the Elder Wand, and he almost gagged – the whispering of the Elder wand rang through his mind all the time, even sang in his dreams. It took every ounce of his self-control not to succumb, not to finally wield it. He lived in perpetual fear that one day, he’d fail.
Without thinking about it, Harry reached his own hand out to still Malfoy’s shaking hand. He relaxed and loosened his grip on his wand, allowing Harry to pluck it out of his hand and tuck it gently into the pocket of his jacket. Harry felt on fire where he’d touched Malfoy, and he coughed awkwardly to cover up his embarrassment.
Hermione looked pleased that Ron had remembered the folders (although he had rather undersold them, Harry thought – there were at least ten) and nodded along with him.
The dragon suddenly came to life, flying on cloth wings into the middle of the room, coughing up smoke and sparks. It flew for some minutes around the impressed and excited group, landing on Ron’s ginger head and Harry’s shoulder, and Malfoy looked pleased as it flapped its wings in his face for a moment. It finally completed its cycle around the room, stopping in front of Ginny, where it coughed up bright red sparks spelling out “Will you marry me?” Everyone turned to look at Luna, who held out a beautiful silver ring to Ginny, who burst into happy tears and leant down to kiss her, saying “Yes, yes, yes!” Over and over again.
“Because she realised what he was doing to her. It’s the only explanation.” Harry felt sick, he could feel his stomach roiling at the thought of what she’d experienced. Malfoy closed his eyes, imagining the scene before him.
A few minutes later they found themselves standing in a small, dark alley cordoned off by muggle police tape. The murder had happened only a few days ago, and although the muggles didn’t realise what it was, the connection to the other cases had been made. They’d pretended to be muggle cops from London, Malfoy’s idea, actually, which had worked surprisingly well. It surprised Harry to realise Malfoy must pay more attention to the muggle world than Harry had ever understood.
Malfoy’s suggestion was a good one, and they all knew it was their best bet, so with Hermione’s permission he and Harry started to create a plan to take to the werewolves that afternoon.
Luna and Ginny were now twirling around the dancefloor, narrowly missing the other dancing couples – Ron and Hermione were wisely sticking in one corner, swaying. His large hands were placed protectively on her belly, and both were smiling widely.
“Wait!” Malfoy reached out, whip-fast, and grabbed Harry’s wrist. “I’m not sorry. I thought you would be.”
“But what do I do now?” Harry’s voice hurt Ron – he sounded so desperate, so hopeless. They both thought about it – Harry’s fear of causing and violence and pain was making him an easy target, and miserable to boot.
Glad he’d been to see Ron first, he replied “No, of course not.” She nodded, and waited for him to speak again.
He left Luna’s shop and, checking the time, swore – early afternoon already and he’d done nothing he’d agreed with Malfoy. Malfoy was checking out other werewolf murders in the country, so Harry had to interview anybody who’d known Cressida Boone was in England. That included Hermione, but he figured he’d check in with her last – he knew it was biased, but he couldn’t ever imagine suspecting her for something like this.
“Oh, no, sorry, Ron, you’ve got Durmstrang, Harry, you’ve got Ilvermorny and Malfoy has Beauxbatons.” Without waiting for them to reply, Hermione buried her head in the large pile of parchments and began rapidly flicking through them, making notes.
“I’m going to ignore how stupidly offensive that was, Potter, and instead ask you this – how can I trust you if you keep lying to me?”
“She’s totally different tonight. I know people are different out of work, but this is ridiculous.” Harry gestured, small hand movements, to Susan, who was now trying to catch pieces of food in her mouth that her friends were throwing to her.
Several days later Harry and Malfoy sat around Cressida’s little table, reading and rereading the notes on werewolf etiquette that Hermione had sent through. Malfoy had been quieter than usual, and Harry knew what was coming.
“We are not trusting creatures. We are not forgiving. But we will grant you one chance. Work with us and find our killer. If you betray us, we will rip you to shreds.” He growled and turned away, bored of the conversation.
Malfoy’s face barely changed as he stared down at Harry’s hand for a long moment before looking back into his face, expressionless. His face was blank, but Harry could see his eyes, steely and cold.
Harry immediately looked for Malfoy, wondering why they hadn’t had time to talk yet, but Malfoy was gone, no longer standing beside the gong Blaise had rung just minutes earlier. Where the hell has he gone? Harry thought, feeling a burst of impatience bloom inside him. Perhaps he only wants to be friends in private, he thought grumpily, and decided to put Malfoy out of his mind for the rest of the evening.
“They’re not reunions! Well, not really – it’s every week, same pub, and anyone who is free comes along.”
“Well, do you think it might be time to tell him? I mean, you’ve worked with him for three years now, surely you can trust him.”
“Hang on, mate…those clothes aren’t yours.” Ron narrowed his eyes at Harry’s clothing – Malfoy’s trackies and t-shirt, both of which were a little long on him, and designer to boot.
Scratch glared at him, but remained standing still, apparently giving him permission to continue talking. Harry thought fast.
“Malfoy almost chickened out.” Harry smirked at Malfoy over Hermione’s shoulder as Ron started to laugh.
“Enough of the French now, dear, Harry doesn’t speak any.” She chastised, sharing out the drinks. Malfoy rolled his eyes and sighed, and then winced. Harry felt Pansy’s high-heeled foot returning to under the chair, and he smirked at Malfoy.
When Harry woke up, Malfoy wasn’t in bed. The space left by his body was still warm, thought, and Harry rolled lazily into it and closed his eyes again. Neither Harry nor Malfoy had been disturbed by nightmares.
“I had to give Savage our report by myself.” Malfoy scowled at Harry over his cup of coffee, who frowned back, guiltily remembering the memo on his calendar.
The man had a French accent and a deep, low voice that matched his incredible height. Harry considered himself fairly tall (although truthfully he was just above average) and he found himself looking up at this man.
“Do you realise how much this could have change everything? We can solve all our cases so much quicker!” Malfoy reached out his hand to touch it, but Harry panicked, pulling his hand away, suddenly pale and sweating.
Luna bowed down over Harry’s left arm for what felt like hours, slowly, painstakingly carving an image into his skin with burning silver ink. He tried to think of what it might be, but Luna’s mind had always been a mystery to him. Finally, she pulled away, carefully casting a pain releasing spell and showing Harry his new tattoo.
Harry replied in kind, and they turned to see Draco carefully disentangling Pansy from around his neck. She was dressed in a slinky black and gold dress, and her black hair was cut short, to her chin, as always. She looked, for all intents and purposes, like she was calm and relaxed, but Harry could see her wand strapped to her right thigh, within easy reach. He felt relieved to know someone else was always prepared for danger.
“You’ve got muggle money, right?” Harry asked, suddenly afraid Malfoy was going to produce a sickle at the bar.
“He cast the killing curse on me. Again. Except this time, it worked.” Harry’s voice shook with the memories, and he instinctively put his fingers to the pulse point on his throat (as he always did when he remembered that night), reassured only by the beating of his heart. You came back, he said to himself, as he always did. You came back.
Harry and Malfoy made their way through the thronging crowd to the front, joining Ron and Hermione, who shared a smirking glance before greeting them with smiles. Dean and Seamus worked their way through countless pieces of artwork, one of which included a portrait of Diagon Alley, which Ron and Hermione bought, before reaching a beautiful set of magical photographs taken at the previous art gala, just a few months ago.
Harry sat alone in his flat all Saturday evening, too numb to cry. Or perhaps he was too angry to cry, he couldn’t tell.
“There are fifteen clippings here. Ten of them are about murders, three are about muggings with serious injuries and these last two are…hmm. They’re about animal attacks, which I guess is relevant to the werewolf pack’s activites, rather than the crimes committed against them.” Malfoy was very matter of fact – it was one of his strongest talents in this job, Harry thought, comparing it to his own habit to connect emotionally to anything possible. It was part of the reason they worked so well together.
“I’m having nightmares again.” He told her, and subconsciously traced his fingers over the single therapeutic tattoo she’d given him four years ago, when his guilt over the war had been overwhelming and he’d had nightmares every night for a year – placed just above his heart, a silver lily pulsed with his heartbeat, to remind him with each beat that he was loved and loving.
Harry sat across the table from Malfoy, Ron and Hermione, fists tightly clenched. He’d finally slept, although not well; he’d been in such a state after finding Cressida’s body that no-one had been willing to leave him alone, and so he hadn’t returned to his flat. Instead, he’d slept on the sofa at Hermione and Ron’s.
Without waiting for a reply, Harry stormed out of Malfoy’s flat, slamming the door behind him, and apparated home.
“No, that’s just it.” Harry replied, wondering if he was about to sound like a madman. “Everything Susan Darling said was perfect. She was really polite – nice, actually.”
The hall was bathed in silvery lights that danced across the ceiling, and pale blue streamers fluttered gently. The guests had been instructed to wear what made them feel attractive and comfortable, but somehow the result looked better than it should have – many women had chosen to wear flowing summer dresses, and the men, on the whole, wore smart trousers and a shirt.
Shuddering, he leapt away from the darkening thread and soldiered on, finding himself watching as Voldemort pointed his wand at Harry and…Harry fell, everything going black. Ron panicked, threw himself out, found himself watching Malfoy’s pale face crying in a bathroom mirror. Curiosity getting the better of him, Ron followed this thread, flicking through countless memories of Malfoy frowning, smirking, casting spells, ending at a memory of Harry and Malfoy watching each other as people crowded around Luna and Ginny. Last night, Ron realised, and finally withdrew from Harry’s mind.
There was an awkward silence that spoke of all the years they’d spent hating each other at school, each believing the other had it better, and was a worse person for it. Harry didn’t want any more silence – he was tired of it.
“Oh, yeah, they hated magic, didn’t want me knowing anything about it, especially not a magic school. They kept destroying the letters.”
“So we won’t be having a repeat of last year!” Ron crowed, wrapping an arm around her shoulders kissing the top of her head, narrowly avoiding her elegant up-do.
“You’re late.” Malfoy’s voice was sharp and Harry winced as he closed the door of their shared office behind him.
“Oh, Harry, what lovely robes you’re wearing! What a beautiful colour!” Hermione cried, finally releasing Ron and straightening up, slinging her infamous tiny bag over her shoulder. “What made you choose that colour, Harry?”
Talk then turned to Pansy and Blaise, who were on their honeymoon somewhere in Africa – somewhere they wouldn’t be sent for work, so it would remain a special, cherished place for them. Harry in turn told Malfoy about Ginny and Luna’s wedding planning – it was sure to be a wonderfully wacky event, judging by some of the hints Luna had given.
“Sorry, sorry, I overslept.” He replied, throwing himself into the uncomfortable chair behind his desk. He glared over at Malfoy, who lounged so casually that Harry thought he must have spelled his chair into shape somehow.
“Very polite, for an American, she is. Said she’s researching something in the area, needed access to books and the internet.”
He wanted to run back to Malfoy’s flat and punch him in his stupid, smug face; he wanted to apparate to the Daily Prophet offices and cause a huge fucking scene about their awful article; he wanted to find his friends and cry into their shoulders.
“Aha! A bakery, perfect.” Harry led Malfoy into a small shop smelling strongly of fresh bread and sweet jam, where they were cheerily greeted by a large blonde woman smiling brightly from behind the counter.
“Well, it’s mine. It has been for years, since the before the battle.” Harry hesitated, tried to speak, failed. He tried again.
“Yeah, and we have to make some sort of progress on either who took Cressida or who’s killing the werewolves, assuming they aren’t the same person.”
Hermione actually did throw up after they all watched their memories of the scene, and Harry couldn’t blame her.
“Jesus Christ, we’ve been here almost six hours!” Harry folded his hand over the part of the table he’d cast the Tempus charm on, feeling the tingle of magic fade away under his skin. “I should probably get back to the flat.”
Malfoy didn’t reply, just stared at Harry with wide, grey eyes. Harry gestured with his hands as if to say ‘well, get on with it!’, and Malfoy nodded. Hesitantly, he rolled up the sleeve of his left arm, the one with the Dark Mark. Harry flinched as he saw the blackness, and then froze as he saw what was above it – a silvery, human bite mark scarred into the skin just below Malfoy’s elbow.
“Nah, not at the moment. Connor Johnson from the Falmouth Falcons asked me out last month, but he’s not really my type.”
Ron joined them on the sofa, holding out a full bottle of wine, much to Neville’s delight. Neville hiccupped and made a blind swing for it, and Ron chortled, telling him he’d never been able to hold his alcohol well. Harry switched his TV on, to the glee of both Ron and Neville, and they started to watch a game of football, each taking a swig when they didn’t understand the game. It wasn’t long before they were totally hammered – Ron curled on the floor hugging a pillow, Neville still wearing his cooking apron and Harry’s glasses somewhere in his lap, hair stuck up straight.
“That’s it! Harry, well done!” She planted a kiss on his forehead and darted out the door. The three men listened to her shoes tap-tapping down the hallway in stunned silence.
“I don’t suppose Cressida mentioned what she’s doing here, did she? She’ll only tell us it’s a surprise, but, well, we like to be prepared for anything!” Malfoy was all smiles and sweetness, and Harry had to twist away to turn a snort into a fake sneeze at the sight of Malfoy’s bright, innocent smile.
Harry made to move forward, heart in his throat, but Malfoy and Ron had already gotten there – Malfoy disarmed Bellchant as Ron tackled him to the ground. Disguised Aurors swarmed in to pull Scratch away as Hermione appeared in the courtyard, breathing heavily, wand held out towards Bellchant.
The village was peaceful and picturesque, with little brick houses and tiny, winding lanes. Screaming seagulls flew in circles high above them and the salty scent of the sea filled the air. Harry and Malfoy chatted quietly as they walked, Harry cheerily pointing out an old sweet shop and declaring that before the case was over he’d buy one of everything in there. Malfoy laughed, as though he was joking, but Harry was serious – it had been a long time since he’d lived with the Dursleys, but he’d never quite gotten over that sickening feeling that he was missing out.
“Pansy…You and everyone know I’m not normally one for showing my heart on my sleeve, but I think we can both agree this is a special occasion.” He paused, and Harry was amazed to see that he, usually so cool and calm, was collecting his thoughts. “We have survived more than I ever thought we could, but you didn’t just survive – you thrived. You shine like no-one else, Pans, and I’m going to show you every day how much I love you.”
Harry continued, heart in his throat, ringing in his ears. He could already feel the compulsion to call up his parents, Sirius and Remus. He shook his head like a dog shaking off water, but the feeling didn’t lessen.
“We’re partners.” Malfoy said matter-of-factly, not looking up from the meal he was rapidly devouring.
Malfoy outlined that Hermione needed to give them any information about the Northumberland pack she could find, as well as any known werewolf haters that in the surrounding area that they should visit. Additionally, they wanted to know about other werewolf murders in the country. Finally, they wanted Hermione to put them into contact with anybody who might have known Cressida Boone was in England.
“Salazar, what’s with all the mess?” Malfoy gingerly picked his way across the room towards the table, followed by Harry, both of whom tried, unsuccessfully, to avoid stepping on any of the papers and books strewn across the floor.
Last night had been the best night of his life (although Harry recognised that thought as a bit a cliché) – Malfoy had been gentle and kind and patient, and Harry had been unafraid, instead feeling the passion and intimacy of the act.
Harry couldn’t help but look for signs of Greyback on her skin, but her white skin was unblemished everywhere he could see, and he thought back to Malfoy’s broken voice saying “He did worse to Pansy” and realised he probably would never know quite what happened to her.
“Good god, Granger, your hair has a life of its own!” Malfoy snapped, waving her frizzy hair out of his face.
“Good!” Connor looked relieved to be on a familiar topic. “We won our last match. Not looking forward to coming up against Ginny, though.”
“Oh, good catch!” Malfoy whispered, distracted, and then caught himself. “What are you saying, Potter?”
Harry didn’t know how to explain it without mentioning the Horcruxes, but he had to try. “I died. I saw Dumbledore. And then I came back, and your mother lied to him. She saved my life by telling him I was dead, and all because she wanted to save you.”
“Don’t need one, do I? I’m a Squib.” He spat, and Malfoy relaxed beside Harry. This cleared Jeremiah as a suspect, and additionally it suggested some strange, unpleasant things about his relationship with his sister, who so publicly had denounced Squibs as true wizards.
Thankfully, before his thoughts could spiral any further, Malfoy reappeared, gently knocking on the door before entering. Without any talking, both men got under the covers, Harry on the side closer to the door.
“No-one knows. Well, Ron and Hermione, obviously, but no-one else knows. People probably think I was mad, talking about a children’s story to a murderous megalomaniac. No-one ever asked, and I never told.”
Harry got up and walked towards Malfoy, who held out Harry Two (as he was sometimes affectionately known) towards him.
“I’m sure you will.” He replied sarcastically, before adding. “Well, I look forward to seeing you there.”
“Actually, I reckon it was that kidnapping case in Wales – I hated that French witch so much for no reason.”
Harry didn’t bother asking how Pansy knew – she was a born and bred socialite, and as a result knew everybody and everything. Instead, he nodded and told her of their hopeful name choices, and she cooed in delight.
The sun had set by the time the plans were made, and they agreed to meet at the edge of the forest early the next morning to set everything in motion.
Harry stood beside him and stared at the painting, looking at each detail until he thought he knew it by heart. There was Ron and Hermione, faces tired and sad, but relieved, hands tightly clasped as they looked towards Harry, centre frame, on his knees on the dirty floor, face terribly pained. Just behind him was the shadow of Voldemort’s dead body, still crumpled where it had fallen.
“I’ve always been wise, Harry!” Hermione replied as Ron, Ginny and Luna burst into the room carrying pots and pans of curry and rice and naan bread. Everyone settled around the table and started to eat, talking loudly and merrily.
Ahh. That made sense. Pansy was matchmaking, again. Every year she sent over a friend or colleague to chat him up, and every year she was unsuccessful.
Malfoy had yet to say anything, instead staring wide-eyed at the ghost-like figure in the centre of the room. Ron had his eyes closed tightly (Harry knew he was hearing Fred’s voice, the same way he was hearing his parents crying, Remus and Sirius whispering his name) and Hermione was writing notes. Harry couldn’t imagine what she could possibly have to write about yet, but that was Hermione through and through.
This was the flakiest part of his plan, and it had caused Harry a sleepless night – if they were wrong, the whole operation would be for nothing – Scratch would refuse to work with them again, and Herman Bellchant would remain at large.
“Some American witch has been missing for three days now – Missing Persons sent over her file to us because she’s high profile and she worked with Dark objects sometimes. Want us to take a look.” Malfoy finally answered Harry even as he read the memo for himself.
Malfoy frowned at him across the room, and Harry stared back, refusing to back down. Malfoy flushed, slightly.
“I never knew.” Harry said simply. He’d never once thought that the Dark-aligned people might have suffered under Voldemort too.
They found their own way this time, although Harry was sure a werewolf or two was lurking just out of sight, and they soon found themselves in front of Scratch.
“I’ve seen countless of my friends and family die right in front of me! My parents, Sirius, Dumbledore, Cedric, Dobby, and that’s all before the war really even started! I was abused and tortured by my muggle relatives, by Umbridge, by Voldemort himself! I was on the run being hunted for a year! I was forced to become a cold blooded murderer! I died! I sacrificed myself because I trusted Dumbledore and he led me like a lamb to the slaughter! The only people in the world I could trust to have my back were Ron and Hermione. After all that, why should I believe it’s any different now?”
“Yes. Fenrir Greyback.” Malfoy said the name with equal parts disgust and fear, looking as though he may vomit. “It was torture. He was allowed to do whatever he wanted, except kill us. I got off easy – I’d taken the Mark, and even Greyback was afraid of the Mark. But Pansy…” Malfoy’s voice broke. “He did worse to Pansy.”
A thought occurred to him, one that before now had only surfaced in the deepest dark of night, when he woke sweating and sobbing. What if he didn’t deserve a great happiness? What if there never was a moment where Harry realised everything had been for a reason, and all his trauma had led him to some wonderful thing? What if everything he’d done, all the terrible and monstrous things he’d had no choice but to do, had condemned him?
“No. There will always be someone like Voldemort or Grindelwald, who want more and will do anything to get it. I have to stop them – I have to protect it.” Harry’s voice broke, and he turned away, embarrassed to cry in front of Malfoy.
Monday morning came and went with no sign of Susan Darling, and Harry and Malfoy grew worried. They ate lunch in their office, hoping she was just late, but with no luck. They’d received no message from the Auror stationed outside her home since the night before, and after checking the entry logs for the building they discovered Susan hadn’t come into work that morning.
“This is very new to me, letting someone in that doesn’t already know my baggage, wasn’t living through it with me. I know I’m not doing it right, but I want to.”
He swung open the door. The first thing he noticed, looking through the window, was that it was dark outside – what the hell had he done all day? The second thing he noticed was Malfoy, stood a few feet away from the door, leaning back against the wall opposite his door. He looked impossibly casual and relaxed, although his face was paler than usual.
Harry pictured Pansy, beautiful and charming, smiling her knife-sharp smirk. She worked in the Department of International Magical Cooperation as a diplomat, along with her boyfriend, Blaise. She was sarcastic and funny and surprisingly cheerful, and Harry felt sick to think of the horrors she could have been subjected to.
“Teddy’s great - he’s six now. He looks a lot more like you, but he likes to dye his hair crazy colours like Tonks did. He’s very brave, and curious, and he’s so full of love. You’d be proud of him, Remus. You both would.”
He admittedly spent a long time looking through all his muggle clothes, trying on multiple outfits, wishing Ginny and Pansy had thought to revamp his muggle clothes as well as his wizarding wardrobe. Trying to predict what Malfoy would wear, Harry tried on a plain t-shirt and jeans, before wearing an uncharacteristic button-up shirt for approximately five seconds, finally settling on a clean, light blue sweater and his most fitted jeans.
Malfoy pulled his own hand back and seemed to realise for the first time that Hermione and Ron were now both watching Harry’s face keenly, barely blinking, watching and waiting for something.
“Four Hermans at Ilvermorny, but only two are possibilities – one is dead, and another lives in New York.”
Harry smiled and rolled his eyes – in the six years since the war had ended Neville had dated a surprisingly large number of attractive, successful witches from around the world – he chalked his success in the romance area up to karma and his early lack of luck, whereas Harry and his other friends insisted it was because he’d gotten, in Ginny’s words, ‘hot and hunky, with a healthy helping of hero’.
Malfoy coughed but didn’t reply, instead holding out his arm for Harry to clutch as they spun away, landing in a dark alley. Malfoy led Harry out of the alley towards an old-looking pub named The King’s Head.
“Shit!” He swore, snatching back his hand and cradling it against his chest, burning tears springing up in his eyes.
Before Harry could process his words, he vanished out the door and down the hallway, leaving Harry to sit on his own, still clutching the whispering stone in his tightly clenched fists. Although the whispering had never been louder, Harry couldn’t hear it, instead hearing over and over Malfoy calling him Harry.
Harry was pleased – this was a subtle way to find out what Malfoy was into, as well as who he was into.
Harry darted down an alley and turned on the spot, appearing by his bed. He fell face first onto it, passed out.
“Right, well, let’s see what we can do.” Harry rolled up his sleeves and snagged the second apron from behind the kitchen door. As he carefully instructed Neville on what to do, they caught up on each other’s news from the last few months, from travelling to work to friends, eventually landing on the topic of dating.
Ron and Harry grinned at each other, amused at the memories of tiny eleven year old Hermione rushing around with books and talking a mile a minute while they waited in suspense.
“What were you doing walking around at midnight?” Harry laughed, surprised – he’d always pegged Malfoy as someone who was in bed by eleven.
Without waiting for Harry to respond, Malfoy knelt on the ground, pulling out a small velvet ring box from his pocket.
There was a couple of seconds of silence where Harry’s friends watched him, knowing he had something to say.
Harry added the date of Pansy’s event (with ‘REMIND RON’ written next to it in large letters) and sent the letters through the flames to Hermione’s office.
And so it was less than ten minutes later that Harry stumbled into Ron’s office, pale and shivering. Ron opened his mouth, prepared to make a hangover joke, but he stopped short at the sight of Harry’s tearstained face. Ron swung the door shut and pulled out a chair, forcing Harry into it.
“Shit, Malfoy, I’ve got to go or I’ll be late to dinner at Ron and Hermione’s.” He paused, and asked, as always, “Want to join?”
“How’s Potter managed it, then?” Malfoy snapped, rudely, angrily. Harry thought that perhaps his anger was at Harry’s lies and secrets, not that Harry hadn’t used the Stone for their cases. There was a faint pink-ish hue to Malfoy’s pale cheeks. Harry didn’t know if it was anger, or excitement, or something else entirely.
“No! Wait!” He stumbled over his words, trying to line them up. “You don’t understand. It’s dangerous…it’s evil.”
Harry, too surprised to do anything, let him. Malfoy rested the tip of his wand against Harry’s cheek for a moment, fingers tightening on his chin momentarily before letting go. Harry’s face was now thinner and the chin was weaker, less pronounced.
“No, we’re not. I wrote to Savage and told her we’d be taking the day to meet with the Northumberland pack for a mission debrief. She wasn’t best pleased but I highly doubt she’ll take the time to check.”
“Have you heard of Cressida Boone?” Harry asked. It was a risky question, and Malfoy’s glare showed he thought so too, but he didn’t say anything, perhaps still shaken by the guide’s keen attention to his Dark Mark. His face was paler than usual, and he was breathing deeply – Harry could see his chest moving from where he sat.
“I don’t believe anything is inevitable, Harry.” Luna said disapprovingly. “Besides, you’ve got the strongest will of anyone I’ve met. Nothing can control you if you don’t want it to.”
Harry let himself into Malfoy’s flat several hours later – the door was unlocked, although Harry was sure there were spells in place to prevent intruders.
“Quiet!” Harry snapped. “She’s been cursed with the Imperius recently, and more than once. And some kind of memory charm, too.”
“He’s certainly a cold-blooded killer – Susan and Alison mark the 13th and 14th of his kills that we know about. The first ten are werewolves from the Northumberland pack, and another two that you two believe are his, but haven’t identified yet.” Hermione resurfaced from under the table, face pale, sweaty, but determined.
“That’s great – we’ll be here for a week or two, I think.” Harry replied as George emerged from the kitchen with a steaming paper bag, which he handed over to Harry.
Harry left the Department of Magical Transport with more questions than he’d had going in – he’d spoken to four people in the last few hours, and three of them had seemed totally unaware that Cressida was missing, or what she’d been doing in the UK. He would check them out anyway, of course, but he was pretty sure they weren’t involved.
“Please, be careful.” She added just as they turned on the spot and vanished, leaving her alone in the silence of the cottage.
Harry could have been blown over by a stiff breeze – he could count the number of times Malfoy had apologised to him on the fingers of one hand, and none had been said as passionately as this. And on top of that, what he’d said, or at least suggested, about his feelings for Harry…it was a lot to take in.
“We know who’s been killing your people. He’s killed a few of ours, too. We have a plan to catch him, but we need your help.”
“Is she serious? She managed all that in under twenty minutes?” He hissed, wide-eyed. Harry saw Hermione smile to herself through all her hair. Triumphant with Malfoy’s eyes finally on him, Harry replied.
“After the war I let all the house elves go, and then I didn’t have much choice but to learn. It’s mostly spells, though.”
“What are you doing in our forest?” He snarled. Harry frantically thought back through everything he’d learnt, but Malfoy answered first, voice trembling ever so slightly.
He’d missed out on his weekly Wine and Whiskey Wednesday with Ron and as many old Gryffindors as they could round up each week (he knew he’d receive a Howler from Ron about it sometime this morning) and by God did he regret it – he’d never have gotten that drunk with Ron and their friends around to prank him. Strange, he thought, that he trusted ex-Slytherins more than his old housemates not to mess with him when smashed.
Malfoy held out his arm for side-apparition, and they turned on the spot, arriving in a small, dark alley in Camden. Malfoy quickly directed Harry towards a fancy bar, but he hesitated.
Malfoy had pretended to be offended, but really he was delighted to be included in the wedding. Six months of dating Harry and he could still hardly believe he was now a part of the family.
Harry stared at him, suddenly unable to remember why he’d come, and Malfoy stared back, clearly waiting for Harry to speak first.
“Sort what?” Malfoy’s voice sounded loud and clear above the noise inside, and Harry whirled around to face him, heart in his throat.
“He’s a bloody psychopath, whoever the hell he is.” Ron spat as he carefully tied Hermione’s hair out of her face as she retched, his words and facial expression at odds with the gentleness of his actions. His ease at handling her mane of hair as she vomited spoke volumes of how the first months of her pregnancy were treating her.
“Your sister committed horrific crimes. She deserved the punishment she got and worse!” Harry snapped back, mind racing – anyone as angry as Jeremiah seemed to be would have pulled his wand by now. Clearly it wasn’t respect for the government that was holding him back, or an ability to control himself – even as Harry thought, Jeremiah was ranting and raving, red-faced, about poor Delores locked away for trying to help the true wizards.
“Oh, aren’t you two a picture! What a lovely couple you make.” Suzanne seemed delighted by this scene, and Harry blushed, about to set her straight.
Harry stayed with Ron and Hermione for perhaps another hour before he returned home to shower and change clothes for his drinks with Malfoy. Ron had called after him that people only changed clothes if it was a date, but Harry had ignored him – no point listening to someone who was wrong, he figured. Besides, Malfoy always looked unreasonably smart, so it was only polite to look somewhat respectable.
Harry laughed, loudly, caught off guard by Malfoy’s openness and lack of embarrassment when talking about sex – it was still something Harry couldn’t talk about much. Vernon’s disparaging and offensive comments about ‘fancy men’ and ‘faggots’ had obviously had a lasting impact.
“In the meantime, I did some research and I think I found a locator spell that should help us find Cressida Boone.” Ron produced a large, dusty book from his bag and Hermione beamed up at him, delighted, as he handed it over to Harry and Malfoy to peruse.
He couldn’t believe he hadn’t known how he felt about Malfoy – it was a constant drumbeat in his heart now, he wasn’t sure he’d ever forget. How long had he felt that way? How embarrassing, to be told by Ron he was in love with someone.
Harry prepared himself to answer, unsure of what exactly to tell her, when she wailed. Her silvery form collapsed in half, and Harry realised she’d dropped to the ground in a crouch. She’d remembered what had happened to her.
There were countless about his relationship with Ginny – “Poor Weasley shacks up with arrogant Potter”, “Potter cheats his girl and his best friend” (a photo of him and Hermione), “The Boy Who Lived can’t love” (after their break up).
If he was braver he’d go and confront Malfoy, but he didn’t think he could bear the thought of Malfoy saying he believed everything he’d read, that he thought Harry was a coward and a cheat. And if he was braver even still, he’d go and apologise, try to make up, tell Malfoy they could work it out.
“You’re right, it doesn’t. There’s more, but I can’t, and won’t, ever tell you. If you want to be my partner…and my friend, you’ll have to accept that.”
“You came because you believe many of my pack have died?” His voice was emotionless and his face was blank – Harry couldn’t decipher his thoughts, but he thought he better not lie.
“You had his textbook? No wonder you were suddenly a Potions prodigy that year!” He sounded jealous, and Harry was reminded of his obsessive love for Potions back in school.
“Oh. Potter.” Malfoy looked miserable, for some reason, as though it wasn’t the question he’d been expecting, or hoping for. “I’m sorry about that.”
“Fine, Potter.” Perhaps because Malfoy’s parents lived in Azkaban and France respectively, and because the friends he’d lost in the war were long dead, Malfoy seemed sincere. He had no interest in using the stone himself - he was watching Harry now, not the stone. His eyes were still cold.
“And for a boy, well, we wanted to go with Harry Frederick Granger-Weasley, if that’s alright with you?” Ron asked, looking towards Harry, who felt his eyes fill with tears.
“Try to look casual, Malfoy – we’re not going on a catwalk.” Harry called out as Malfoy left, laughing at his mock offended face as he stepped through the fireplace.
He held out a hand to Malfoy, who grudgingly took it, standing up awkwardly. Harry grabbed his other hand and started dancing about wildly, forcing him to move along or fall over. After a few moments, Malfoy started to smile, and then full on grin as he started to dance in time with the music.
“It is right. Thank you, Luna.” Harry hugged her, tightly, feeling calm for the first time since his nightmare.
“Aunty Gin! Look! I’m you!” With her shock of ginger hair and impish smile, she did in fact look like a mini Ginny, a fact that both took great pride in.
“This is my favourite time of year.” Malfoy said, smiling as he ran his fingers across a tree trunk.
An hour later found Harry and Malfoy watching men and women dressed in white taking away Susan’s body while others collected samples from the scene.
Harry swallowed loudly, and shook his head slightly, trying to dim the ringing in his ears that always came with using the stone.
Malfoy laughed, a quick burst of noise, and his whole body relaxed. Harry smiled up at him, glad that he’d cut the tension and told the truth at the same time.
Both faces were the excellent transfiguration work of Headmistress Minerva McGonagall herself early that morning, as were countless others around him. In fact, as he surveyed his surroundings, he saw that Hermione and Shacklebolt had done as they’d promised: there was not a single muggle in the entire courtyard, including the people working in the shops. Instead, there were thirty odd wizards and witches, transfigured to be unrecognisable, ready and waiting for Herman Bellchant; even the six year old girl begging her mother for a chocolate bar was an Auror, wand tucked in her pink wellies.
Malfoy finished their weekly ritual by replying, as he always did, “Not tonight, Potter, but thanks.”
There was a light ripple of laughter throughout the crowd as Pansy turned serious and faced Blaise again.
Harry stayed with the three ex-Slytherins for hours, drinking merrily as the sun dropped behind the city skyline and the bar filled with noisy muggles. The bar grew warm, and Malfoy rolled up his shirt sleeves, and Harry saw he hadn’t glamoured his Dark Mark, as he usually did in public. Harry understood – here in muggle London, nobody would spare a second thought for what looked like an edgy tattoo – there would be no shame in Malfoy baring his arms.
It was hard for Harry to see Lupin’s pale, scarred face – it was always hard for him to bring someone back and know it was temporary, which was why he only used the stone for work, and only when it was absolutely necessary. The first time had been Sirius – Harry had needed information about a criminal blood-purist relative of his, and he’d cried for hours after saying goodbye. The second time Harry had brought back Dumbledore to ask about a highly secret organisation of Dark witches, and it had been very hard for Harry to put away the stone.
“Oh, Harry, wait a second.” She waited for him to turn around before continuing. “You’re going to Dean and Seamus’s art gala tomorrow, aren’t you?”
“I’ll do that on Monday then, and if you send over all your Cressida notes I’ll have a look this weekend.”
Keeping a firm grip on her back and the end of the broom, Malfoy swung Roseanne through the air, and she squealed with joy.
“You all know the theme is celebrations, but what are we celebrating? Well, I don’t want to ruin the surprise, but…today is a good day.”
Sat alone in his flat, Harry wondered: Where was his own great happiness? Where were his rewards for his efforts and sacrifices during the war?
Harry talked to Connor for a little longer, no longer desperate to get away but certainly uncomfortable, until he saw Ginny and Luna arriving. Seeing him, they called out his name. Making his excuses to Connor, he made his way towards them.
The next item up was the painting he and Malfoy had looked at earlier, and Harry was determined to have it. He started out bidding against several Ministry workers, along with several people who’d fought that night, but, to his great relief, the painting was finally his, albeit for a rather large price.
“I didn’t realise you were so popular, Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was quiet as he shifted the paper, revealing the other photos – Harry laughing with Connor, Harry smiling up at Francoise, both photos from last night.
Harry frowned at having to work on the weekend, but he had nothing better planned, and he knew he couldn’t complain.
Having finalised a plan for Scratch and the Northumberland pack, scoffed down a quick lunch and changed out of their Ministry robes into muggle clothes, Harry and Malfoy arrived at the outskirts of the forest.
“It’ll take a while to get the ingredients ready for the spell, so I suggest you three go home, collect a change of clothes, maybe get some sleep.”
Harry nodded, no longer surprised, now cautious. He wondered how much to tell Malfoy – his knowledge on the subject was more considerable than he had realised – he could piece together the details if Harry wasn’t careful. And he had to be careful – every single day, every single night.
Malfoy nodded his head in agreement, too busy thinking to even make a dig about Ron, and watched as Harry flagged Ron and Hermione down – they’d been chatting with Neville and Luna, but had stopped to watch Harry and Malfoy fly across the room away from Susan.
Less than half an hour had passed when Hermione came tumbling through the fireplace, bright eyes framed by wild hair and cheeks stained with ink.
Something about the look on his face (concern? pity? affection, even?) struck a chord in Harry, set something alight, and thoughtlessly he lunged forward, almost falling into Malfoy’s lap as he kissed him.
It was Harry’s turn to share an amused glance with Hermione, which Ron missed as he shoved another handful of crisps into his mouth.
Contrary to Harry’s belief, neither Ron nor Hermione had been terribly worried about him (Pansy had tipped them off that he was fine, although she clearly hadn’t told them everything).
Harry quickly wrote out a note on some scrap paper and tossed it into the green fires of the Floo, knowing Hermione would come when she could.
“I’m going for a drink to celebrate the end of this case. Don’t suppose you’d be interested?” Malfoy asked, resolutely not looking at Harry.
He held the stone gingerly, as though it might explode, and turned it over three times in his palm. A shadow appeared before him, slowly transforming into the grey wispy figure of Remus Lupin.
The drinks were made and the two brought them to the table in the corner, where Malfoy and Blaise were having an animated conversation about something in French. Malfoy looked flustered, and Blaise looked almost bored, although that wasn’t much of a change, Harry thought. Pansy scooted into the booth and quickly kissed Blaise before turning to Malfoy.
Trying to ignore Hermione’s shrewd glances, Harry suggested a toast to the happy couple, and he and Ron vanished into the kitchen to get glasses and a bottle or two of wine. Although it would be just as easy to do it with magic, they often did this to catch up, just the two of them.
“You’re dreaming of causing violence again?” Luna’s voice was without emotion, as it always was when someone came to her with troubles, and it reassured Harry. She knew which part of his nightmares worried him the most – he hated that the war had changed him, that hunting and hurting people now came easily to him.
Ron was quiet, thinking. Then he leaped up and closed the shutters of his office window. Then he locked his door and turned to face Harry.
“You’re…wearing jeans.” Harry said dumbly, unable to take his eyes of Malfoy’s black, fitted jeans and dark blue V-neck sweater.
He knew it would look shabby compared to Malfoy’s pressed shirt and slacks, but Malfoy had been his partner for years now, he knew what to expect when it came to Harry. Besides, it was just a work meeting, so there was no reason to dress up, really.
It was true. Harry wasn’t even sure he owned any clothes that would be suitable – he always valued comfort over just about anything else when wearing muggle clothes, although he had plenty of flashy wizarding robes for all the events he had to attend. Although, now he thought about it, that was probably a mix of Ginny and Pansy’s interference.
“Thanks, Malfoy, always good to hear.” Harry replied, rolling his eyes as he joined Malfoy at Cressida’s table. Malfoy pushed over a plate of toast and a mug of coffee. Harry immediately took a bite, thanking him through a mouthful of toast.
Harry returned to Cressida’s cottage early the next morning with a dreadful hangover, expecting to find an empty cottage he could recover in. Instead, he found a sleeping Malfoy slumped over the table, surrounded by papers. Surprised, he conjured a woollen blanket and laid it gently over him, before writing a note telling Malfoy he’d gone to the village for food from Sue and information from Suzanne, and he was welcome to join when he woke up.
Aha! Harry thought. He’s into guys! He was triumphant for a short second, before thinking, why do I really care who he dates? It’s not like he brings them into the office, so it doesn’t affect me.
“I’m sorry, Francoise, but I’ve just seen one of my friends. Can we chat later?” Harry didn’t wait for a reply and darted over to Ron, snagging a champagne glass from a waiter on the way over.
Luna’s dress and Ginny’s dress were made in the exact same style – long and flowing, lace and silk, with a flowing train behind. Luna’s was pale blue (“the sky in winter” Luna called it) and Ginny’s was startling silver. Harry had never been so proud and full of love for his friends.
“Probably shouldn’t spend any more of my salary in one night!” Harry joked, and everyone around them laughed. Malfoy smiled brightly at him as he signed the paper Seamus held out to him.
“Oh, he’s still asleep.” He tucked into the food happily, feeling better with each mouthful. “I thought I’d go see Suzanne today, is she in?”
“Should you be carrying it around with you, though?” He sounded slightly worried now, as though he had suddenly been made aware he had a target stuck to his back. Harry knew the feeling.
As Harry stood at the edge of the town square, hidden by his cloak, watching Scratch linger outside of a small bakery, he prayed that Scratch would be able to play his part – that of a lonely, homeless werewolf, hiding from the magical world, unable to fit in with the muggle one. Scratch usually stood tall, stood proud, broad shoulders and furrowed eyebrows, but even as Harry watched, he shook himself apart, head drooping, wilting in on himself.
Harry couldn’t argue with that, nor did he really want to, so he turned and stepped through the fireplace into his flat.
Malfoy deliberated for a second, thinking whether to charm himself dry and leave the bathroom. He took a glance at Harry, naked and smiling in the shower, and instead stripped off and stepped into the water.
This was so accurate and appropriate for the situation that Harry wondered, not for the first time, if Luna knew more than she let on. But her face was innocent, and so he continued to talk, about his fear and his loneliness.
“Well, Mrs Granger-Weasley, I’d like to ask you a few questions.” Harry answered in an overly formal voice, knowing she’d laugh, which she did, amused.
Instead Harry stood against the railing, trying to calm himself and slow his heart. That kiss had been perhaps the most electrifying moment of his whole life to date, and Malfoy had just walked away without a word.
Harry was both relieved and disappointed – relieved that they hadn’t ventured deep into rogue werewolf territory for nothing, but still deeply disappointed that Hermione’s work with and for werewolves had yet to be effective in the general population.
Scratch’s long messy hair was tied back now, but his nails were as long as they had been before. He smiled this time, and Harry felt Malfoy flinch at the sight of his yellowing, sharp teeth, although Malfoy’s face remained pleasantly blank.
“And the Resurrection Stone?” God, Malfoy was shrewd – he’d noticed Harry’s omission. Harry panicked, shrugging casually as if to say ‘no clue, not a clue about that one, no ideas here’. Malfoy bought it, or at least decided not to push someone who looked like they might be sick at any moment. It struck Harry as bizarre he was so worried about someone finding out he had the least useful of the three, but it was the only one that couldn’t be connected to him, and he wanted to keep it that way.
“Draco, are you – oh!” Pansy’s voice broke off with a high-pitched gasp, and both men pushed each other away, breathing hard, avoiding eye contact. Harry was staring, stone-still shocked, at Pansy. Malfoy had turned away, leaning over the railings, face invisible in the dark.
“What do we do, Hermione?” Harry implored her for an answer, and was surprised when Malfoy asked Ron for his advice.
“Hermione!” Harry and Ron chorused in sync, scandalised. Hermione rolled her eyes as Ron leaned forward.
“Besides, you’d only have to tell him about the Elder Wand and the other Hallows, you wouldn’t have to mention the Horcruxes.”
“Jesus, Potter, what happened?” Malfoy looked horrified, and Harry looked down at his hand for the first time, seeing the deep gash in his palm, studded with shining glass splinters. His left hand, hanging loosely from his slack arm, was streaming blood down his fingers onto the marble floor.
“Merlin, even now, you’re a bloody martyr, aren’t you, Potter?” But Malfoy’s voice wasn’t condescending or cruel – he sounded almost proud, or at least mildly impressed.
Francoise seemed proud to have met Hermione, and Harry smiled – she was a famous war hero and a prominent Ministry figure dead set on making the world a better place – there really wasn’t a better person to be found, except perhaps her husband, who Harry thought fit the bill just as well.
The three of them were quickly joined by Ron and Hermione, and all five tried to work out the reason for the vague theme.
He’d used the stone twice since his conversation with his parents and the rest of his family in the Forbidden Forest, and each time he swore he’d never use it again. Both Ron and Hermione had been willingly sworn to secrecy, vowing never to tell an outsider that Harry had kept the three Deathly Hallows, and neither knew where it was hidden – Harry had cast a Fidelius Charm and had become the Secret Keeper to the location. It had taken weeks for them to come to the decision unanimously - Harry had been adamant he didn’t want them, but Ron, and then Hermione, had convinced him he was the only hope of ensuring they stayed safe and secret.
Both men looked at each other for a second, and Harry felt a strange heat in his chest as he realised he and Malfoy had yet more in common with each other.
“Blaise, darling, show Draco to the table while I get another round.” Pansy pushed Draco gently into Blaise’s direction, and firmly took Harry’s arm as she led him to the bar. She ordered four gin and tonics, and then turned to Harry with a wide smile on her face.
“Potter. Look.” Malfoy gestured to the other side of the large double bed Susan had died in. Harry looked dumbly for a moment, before he realised.
Dean, trotting at a fast speed, led Harry away, into the maze of artwork in the centre of the room; he always earmarked a piece or two that he thought Harry would like, and he was always right. Dean slowed to a stop in front of a small painting of Hogwarts in its heyday, before the war and the renovations that had followed.
“Why are you reading that crap, Malfoy?” Harry sat down beside him, only to see his own face splashed across the front of the page.
Harry joined Hermione and Luna at the table, watching his husband twirling Roseanne around in circles.
“That’s alright, mate, you just startled me a bit. Are you cooking something?” Harry suddenly realised that Neville was clutching a spatula and was wearing Harry’s goofy cooking apron, which was covered with cartoon foods saying things like “It’s a bit chilli in here” and “lettuce do this!”. It had been a Christmas gift from Luna the year before, along with a matching object cartoon one.
And there were countless others, which called him arrogant and stupid and cruel, which said he hadn’t been a hero after all, just lucky.
“Why have you never told me this before?” Harry had expected him to be angry, but that didn’t seem to be right – he seemed more hurt.
Harry took a deep breath, fortified his soul, drawing deep for courage. He moved, finally, towards Malfoy, knelt on the floor at his feet, looking up at him.
“Don’t you talk about Dolly to me! Locking her up in that loony bin! It’s a crime against humanity, it is!” He leapt up, hands curling into fists.
The four ate at a leisurely pace, discussing everything from Hermione’s pregnancy to Ginny and Luna’s wedding. Harry had been right – Ron and Hermione did like Malfoy, and in fact liked him even more now that he and Harry were an item.
“Malfoy, I can’t leave you here with Harry and the stone. It’s too dangerous.” Hermione made to come back into the room, worried, but he stopped her.
Perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes later Hermione ran back into the room clutching several large envelopes. She distributed one each to Harry, Ron and Malfoy, keeping the largest for herself, looking pleased with herself as she sat back down.
