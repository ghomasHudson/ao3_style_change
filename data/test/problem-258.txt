“I figured,” He said, with a smirk. “If you are quite satisfied with the view –
“You wouldn’t understand about family, Potter.” Malfoy said in a low voice. “You don’t have one.”
Draco cursed under his breath. Confessing about the

It was Steve The Seashell – the one he had levitated countless times and he was certain that Steve was directing curses or pleading the brunet to quit with the levitation. “Ste – erm – the red one?”
Harry does not react very well to Draco touching the pocket-watch which is an artifact under a disillusionment charm.
Harry frowned. He wasn’t intent on tolerating Malfoy, even if he was stranded on an Island with him. Harry Potter did not care about Draco Malfoy. And he never would.
I never know what to say-
If Potter wasn’t here, his father would’ve still been alive.
Draco’s lips curved into a fond smile as he raised his eyes to peer into the startling emerald green ones.

Briefly, a dark, wispy cloud eclipsed the moon, and it was like a soft halo around the cloud, a dull aura of lunar luminescence. It was a cold, gusty night.
"Yes," Draco said with a small smirk, and his mind traced back to the train in the sixth year. "It's a rare privilege to break the Chosen One's nose, isn't it?"

“Right,” The air which was comfortable a second ago, was now taut. He untwined the fingers with a slight reluctance and curled it around the cup. It was warm. “former rivals, now friends.”
“You – what did you want to do?” Draco asked, voice soft and slightly worn-out while he wiped the beads of sweat which had formed on the forehead. “after Hogwarts?”
Harry could vaguely imagine Narcissa reading to Draco at night, when he was eleven, probably stroking the blond hair fondly as she recited it. He didn’t comment on it and instead, he remained silent.
Another snort. “On second thought, I suppose I should have a to-do list, it’ll have ‘
The blond closed the door with a soft thud. A small whistle of wind revealed it was open in the slightest. A small crack. He cursed. Fantastic. He had to figure out how to fix things with Draco Malfoy.
part?”
“It is.” It was his concern, because Lucius Malfoy had sent him here. He wanted to know the reason he was here. If it was a plan, or a story he hadn’t heard of yet. Malfoy stared at him curiously. He would’ve been hunting horcruxes, if he wasn’t here. He fucking had to know.
“I want an elaboration.”
“I – Malfoy, I don’t trust you” Potter said, his gaze drifting back to the waves. The waves that softly crashed against the shore were insanely calming. They always had been. “Don’t you have to be infuriating somewhere else?”
Malfoy had a faint smile on his lips. It was kind of a small amused smile and it caused a tiny flutter in his chest and a warmth coursed through him briefly. “You?”
Draco lowered his head onto his shoulder, as he cried softly. “Don’t leave me, Harry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He raised the trembling numb fingers to his temple. A chill raced down his spine, the cold settling within, and the thin cloak he was wearing wasn’t offering a layer of insulation. A soft exhale condensed into a misty plume.
At night, he left another note with the dinner:
“I’ll read on the couch, and rest if I want to.” He said with a soft grunt of pain and clutched the bed post. An act of protest in pain. Sort of idiotic. “You can find the peace and quiet in your own room.”
“Malfoy,” He said with a tone of warning, a pained mien crossing his features for a brief minute at the mention of Ron Weasley, the fear rising within. “It’s Ron Weasley. Not Weasel. Clear?”
He waved a hand through the air in front of him, as if doing so would help him search for the right words and grab them out of thin air. His mind was still muddled with regret from his ignorance of wording and whiplash from Draco's sudden change in attitude. “Our fight, right now,” he couldn’t, however, obtain them. It truly wasn’t his forte. “Lord of the Rings,” he cleared his throat. “Poetry? Be more clear, please.”
“Oh, shut up.”
He shifted in place with a low grunt. It must’ve impacted his head – one confession wasn’t worth forgetting six years of animosity. Yet, unprompted, in a soft voice, Harry whispered, “Wanted to?”
He nicked the cup of tea off the counter. It was cold. He cast a warming charm on it with a curse. An ancient relic. It had a badger on it. A frown creased his forehead when he observed it.
“No,” Harry said, fingers placed over the soft fabric, circling over the pocket-watch. He couldn’t contain the rising frustration, “no, fuck you, I will not elaborate it for you.”
“Maybe I do.”
With his eyes closed, to the endless chatter. The two of them had very different schedules, and with that being said, Draco found it almost surprising that Harry was awake.
In retrospect, ‘still mourning your sorry-excuse for a father’ or ‘the bastard’ would’ve sounded rather fitting, yet he was certain it would’ve turned into a fight – including a cracked jaw or a bleeding nose.
“Oh, of course.”
– I can’t stand you – I wonder if the weasel can.”
Harry tilted his head up to accept another kiss, jumping as the clock struck midnight, and the end of the Yule Ball. "I suppose that forever is a fantasy that we can't have, can we?"
Draco’s staring at him with the softest smile on the face, yet a flicker of panic crosses his features. “You and I – we can’t come out – it’s not what –”
"And what do you want, Malfoy?" he sighed out.
He was almost half a mile away from the sea. He never ended up at another location, and that was utterly infuriating. He knew that the only way he had was to alert the Order, and he wasn’t going to trust Draco Malfoy – Who would set him on fire while he was asleep, given the chance.
Harry didn’t leave a note with dinner. As he rested on the couch, he heard a soft turning of the doorknob and a disheveled Draco Malfoy striding out of the room to the kitchen counter with a frown on his face.
“I’ve lost track of our conversation now,” Draco closed his eyes for a brief second and carded his fingers through his hair, “can you forget about the skin and hair care routine or will I have to
"We're dancing underneath the Draco constellation, of course it's on purpose."
He painted, and painted and painted as the hours passed by.
Draco curled his fingers on his neck, and leaned forward, pressing his lips against his exigent, but soft ones.
Malfoy laughed and unclenched the fists at the side. The tension lingered, yet a part of it had vanished. “Don’t mistaken the fact that I didn’t light you on fire for trust.”
The blond was chewing on his bottom him while frowning at the counter. He was tense and unsure, yet with the similar uncertain voice he said, “I saved
prat,” He whispered, knocking Harry onto the ground, wedged between Draco’s side and the rough bark, a small fallen branch poking his side. “now, if you’re finished –”
on Draco’s face. It was an ongoing nightmare. “Right, of course.”
“I won’t,” Potter said, returning to the novel and turning the page with a sigh. “Cry about it, if you want to.”
When he tried to move to get closer to the blond, he felt his skates slip out to the side. Harry yelped as they fell onto the ice. He landed on his bottom, his leg out to the side, tangled with Draco’s. “Not the worst way to spend Christmas.”
With a soft chuckle, he nicked the novel and closed it. He placed it on the bedside table and crawled out of bed, flicking his wand at the covers and draping it over the brunet and closing the curtains. When the blond walked out of the room, he whispered a soft, “Rest well, Potter.”
“Oh, it’s first-name basis whenever it’s convenient for you, is it?”
“Draco I –” With a frown, Potter perched up on the edge of the couch, and his shoulders tensed while he fidgeted with the cup in the hand. “what I said to you – it’s – none of it is true.”
“You can’t cast an
“Fuck you, Potter.”
“Why don't we start,” Draco said, turning his head to squint at him, and inching closer until they were nose-to-nose. “with you enlightening me on why you can’t stand to be around me?”
coaching.”
“Oh, shut up.” Malfoy said, flipping the crepe with an irritated sigh. “You’re not smart. Or wonderful.”
He smiled.
It was a subtle way to ask for a clarification, because he was insanely confused. Weren’t Pure-blood supremacists like Draco Malfoy supposed to ‘detest’ the ‘outrageous inventions’ of a muggle?
“You just said it’s ridiculous.”
The retort was on the tip of the brunet’s tongue, but before it could slip, he paused and focused on Malfoy’s eyes. One of it was the lightest shade of blue and almost in a trance, he whispered, “You – Your eyes.”
“Oh, shut up or I’ll punch your perfect face.”
Harry frowned. Malfoy was watching him with a hint of curiosity. He waved his hand dismissively in the air, and muttered a quick cleaning charm on the kitchen. One simple charm drained him. It wasn't a lot, but it did.
It barely twitched. And the cause of that was debatable – It could’ve been the magic, the strong wind or a figment of his imagination.
It wasn’t laced with malice. Instead, it was sort of a sarcastic, offhanded quip, which caused a Potter to smile in soft amusement. “I’m sorry?”
“Oh, well – why don’t you start with levitating the seashell – the basics, considering you can’t perform a proper spell without a wand, Potter?” Malfoy countered with a smirk. “You can swear, I can come up with retorts.”
The throbbing wouldn’t cease. He wanted Draco to retort with the familiar venom laced in his voice. Wanted a fight, instead of watching the lingering flicker of
“Malfoy.”
"Don't you worry, Potter." He smiled, rightening Harry gently so they could continue dancing. "I didn't bring you out here to hurt you.”
He started to hum in a soft voice – The familiar song – The one Narcissa would sing to him at night when he was eleven. It was distant. He was seventeen. He wouldn’t find that childish innocence again.
“No, fuck you, you don’t care,” Draco countered in a hoarse whisper. He sounded wretched. Yet, he had a bitter lilt to the tone, “you and I, we’re rivals and I would prefer it to remain that way.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s a blackout,” He said with an uneven exhale, fingers curled into the back of the brunet’s maroon sweater, “occurs once or twice a month,” Draco leaned into him, which caused a small, incessant flutter in his chest, “Do not,” He whispered with a soft snort, “plot
“Yeah, about that –
“Potter –”
“An astute observation, Malfoy.” He said with a sharp edge to his voice. “It isn’t working.”
“Hot chocolate?” He whispered into Harry’s ear.
“You’re a menace, Potter.”
“I’m not. It’s an emotion specific to those who care. I don’t care about you, but your arrival here is quite inconvenient, Potter.”
And it left a note (Or a symphony) of curiosity in the air. Harry always used those sappy endearments, and he secretly loved those. He didn’t understand the sudden change in his behavior. “Harry, love, are you sure that everything is alright?”
He set the cup down, and let out a suffering sigh. Vaguely, he could hear the slight turning of the doorknob and a soft whistle of the wind. A hum – Potter was a decent hummer – A shuffle of footsteps.
I shouldn’t have kissed you and you shouldn’t have kissed me back. I was utterly lost when you grabbed my neck with such hungry fingers. I remember everything, even though I wish I could forget: the sound of your breath when we got away from the road, that gasp you had when you touched my stomach under my clothes, my own urge to pull your hair and get you closer. I wonder what we could have done if you hadn't uttered a French curse that made me laugh? It ruined everything then but if I see you again, will I make you moan? If I caught you and pulled you between closed doors, would you follow me?
What does it make me, that I had to see you tremble to believe you were human?
Yours, deeply,
Did you change views on society? What are your thoughts on muggleborns now? Do you still think you’re better than them? Are you totally free of this prejudiced bullshit?
It’ll soon be two years since you’ve been gone and I can’t find any reason why you would want news from me. If I ever send you a letter you’ll certainly rip it before opening it, dramatic as you are. There is no way you would answer my questions or explain to me how you’re coping with being imprisoned. So why do I want to know?
I will get this done. I’ll survive it. You’ll get whatever you deserve and do your time, away from us. Then you’ll get out and everything will get back to normal. To any kind of normal my life can be.
I’m going to sleep tonight and, tomorrow, I’ll see you and it’ll be the same as always. You’ll be mocking me, I’ll be joking around, we would mean it a little and then everyone would get us on two opposite sides of the group and we’ll have peace.
Everything would be easier.
You make me feel alive, complete, you give me that thing, that spark that I had to give away but that lives inside of you. I can’t risk my life anymore, Draco, I can’t live of dangers and adventures but you, you do. You can talk to me about the strange things that live in this world, the dark alchemists, the strange treasures lost in the sea, the multiple meanings behind a poem and the enigmatic sentences that you can find sometimes under the dust and the magic protection of ancient buildings.
I don’t think Sirius could do that at the time. It must be something new.
I won’t cry, I won’t complain, I’ll stay with you, I’ll be your shadow, devoted to you and asking nothing in return. Hoping that, one day, you’ll get down to me and kiss me again like all those other times when you made me feel alive.
With deep shame and regrets,
I won't ever be able to say it to you but here, in this alter-life where you can read this letter, know that I care about you. That if I could, I would keep you warm every night so you don't ever remember Azkaban. I would listen to you for hours talking about all those dead poets you love so much. I would follow you in France and wait for you naked on the hotel bed. I would make you forget about your worries and that thing that makes you run so fast. I would make you feel welcome and wanted, loved and cherished, you would stop chasing after a redemption you don't need because I would have gotten it for you.
Hermione has her career in the Ministry, Ginny flies, Ron takes care of his family, Neville is back in Hogwarts, Luna is… Well, before you came back she was just being Luna but now, I guess she’s spending her time with you, right? How fucked up with that. Trying to lift the curse on Azkaban, are you? As if you would do something for the science or the morality of it. Curing Azkaban even though you’re not there anymore? Even though it can’t reach you anymore? As if.
He shrugged. She didn't seem satisfied with the answer.
He holds his wand up, pointing it at Voldemort.
Hermione looked thoughtful. "I told Ron I would help him with something once he woke up... but it has been a while since I've talked to McGonagall..."
Harry groaned. "I will, Hermione, but it's currently seven in the morning, on a Saturday, and I don't think he will appreciate me showing up to wake him if he's not already up."
He cut her off. "They've been married for years." He was already halfway to the door. "And besides," he said, though he wasn't sure she was even close enough to hear over the noise. "It wasn't her I wanted anyway." And he was gone, the bell over the door tinkling as it swung shut, closing in the bright lights and loud party life once again.
Harry let out an exaggerated sigh. He conjured a patronus, sending it to seek out Hermione.
Word Count: 2150
When they arrived at the great hall, Harry almost crashed into someone for the second time in not even twenty four hours. "I'm so sor- Draco," he said looking up in surprise. "Seems we have a habit of running into each other lately," he said with an awkward laugh.
He hugged Harry's body to his chest letting out a sob. Every one is watching and he hates it. They all cry like they knew him. They don't. Didn't. They've heard of his name, seen his face, but never really knew him. Not like Draco did.
It ensued a lot more cursing.
He could act cold or detached, instead of forcing out a conversation with Potter. Or could he? He couldn’t contradict the fact that he wasn’t in a never-ending circle of self-pity when Potter was around.
, aren’t my favourite Gryffindor.”
“I – are you,” He paused, calculating the next words, careful to avoid a curse. “still mourning your father?”
The watch wasn’t warm against his palm now, and the dark feeling had reduced a bit. Only a bit. It was a fucking menace. He placed it back in the pocket and sighed softly, as he carded his fingers through his hair.
“No,” Draco said in a trance, the thumb tracing small circles on the artifact, inspecting it with a strange interest which caused Harry to think of one ring to rule them all. “it’s not an ordinary watch, is it?” He wanted to comment on how it wasn’t a watch. “if it’s not one, what is it?”
Or not.
to subdue the fear.
It was a trap, wasn’t it? Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t willingly risk himself. He stared at the lilac grey sky, and the stars. Harry gritted his teeth, and walked to the coastline.
In hindsight, he should’ve announced the ‘save him’ a bit more carefully. BRIC had been pointing that out for a while. And he had realized it. He certainly had an utterly infuriating conscience.
“You should rest.” Draco cut him off with a relented sigh. The Patronus charm was complex with a wand, and to conjure a corporeal one without a wand in Otryazan was undoubtedly insanely exhausting and he didn’t want it to worsen.
He feared the impermanence the stars signified.
Yeah. Bold of him to assume. In his defence, Malfoy had draped a fucking blanket over him. And it seemed like Draco Malfoy did care. A bit. He couldn’t get used to that either. He didn’t retort. The crepes were divine and he wanted to eat in peace.
He was growing a lot more frustrated than he had been. Harry hadn’t used even one of the pet names since yesterday. Not a single pet name. “Are you mad at me, Potter? If you are, I’m sorry –
“Right,” Draco was, of course, not intent to continue with the conversation. He would rather save the civility for a Kneazel instead of forcing it with Harry Potter who was an insolent, self-righteous prat. “if your two minutes of ruining my moment of peace are over –” Draco flicked two fingers at the door. “Out,
“Draco,” Harry crouched down in front of him, and stared at him uncertainly with softened features. “I – what – I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
Malfoy gave him a nod, but he wasn’t smirking anymore. “It’s pitch black. My sky doesn’t have a star. It’s bigger. It’s quiet, and it’s empty.”
“You let the death eaters into the castle, Malfoy.” Harry grimaced, his mind tracing back to the Astronomy tower. The night he had retrieved the fake locket with Dumbledore. “You couldn’t kill him. You were lowering your wand.”
Harry didn’t suppose it was wise to detest a dead man. A dead man who cared about his son in his own peculiar ways. Cared enough to risk his life.
No one had learnt anything practical in the fifth-year. Plus, Malfoy wasn’t a part of the Dumbledore’s Army. In fact, none of the Slytherins were, considering a few of them were in the Inquisitorial Squad. “It isn’t tricky.”
"Honestly, love, you should've seen the look on his face; poor bloke was shitting bricks." Gasped out by Harry between wheezes and Draco was laughing along just as hard. His wheezes simmered down to giggles while watching Draco, having the ability to make his angel laugh uncontrollably without any inhibitions would still be one of Harry's proudest achievements.
Draco leaned into the touch and closed his eyes for a brief second. "I wish you would."
It was working perfectly.
The entire situation was kind of odd. He was on the rooftop with Draco Malfoy, who was leaning on him and snoring and he couldn’t move until the blond would wake up.
Draco tilted his head to the ceiling, perhaps to offer a distraction, and a small, soft smile formed on his face. "On purpose?"
“Fuck you,” He had to resist the urge to hex Malfoy's mouth shut. In fact, he had no patience for Draco's antics or his incessant rants. “It’s
(See the end of the chapter for
A shrug. He brushed a strand of blond hair out of his face, with his mouth set in a thin line. Not the perfect time to utter a subtle apology. “If I would’ve, I wouldn’t have implied – you know.”
In a spur of moment, the silvery clouds started to turn grey-ish. The sun was engulfed by grey clouds, and the sea was slightly turbulent. Yet, the seagulls didn’t flinch and were staring at the water. Odd.
Draco's breathing turned erratic and the wand slipped out of his grip, falling to the ground with a soft sound. The vision started to blur. He couldn't focus on the source of the voice.
The sunlight leaked under the curtain, flowed over the windowsill and saturated the duvet cover. He wiped the beads of sweat on his forehead with a soft sigh.
“It’s worth it, isn’t it?”
“Draco,” Harry said, his gaze flickering to his lips as he swallowed. “You – I – I don’t know.”
.” In hindsight, one chance, perhaps, wasn’t a wise idea. “I’ll light you on fire if you screw up again, Potter.”
“You’re alive.”
“Are we surprised? You flipped a crepe in a perfect manner. You’re Draco Malfoy, need I say more?” Harry said with a soft chuckle as he carded his fingers through his unruly hair. “It’s self-explanatory.”
An hour later, he walked in on Draco, surrounded by wrapping paper and eating the oh-so atrocious chocolates. Almost all of them. “Draco Lucius Malfoy.”
’ without the subtlety, Malfoy.”
Draco placed the wand in the cloak while he muttered a colorful variation of profanities, pointedly avoiding the brunet’s gaze. “You – weren’t you focusing on the one with Narcissa – Of when you were eleven?”
I'm quite pleased with how this chapter turned out, really
Draco couldn’t conceal the small, small smile which had formed on the mouth. It was a definite improvement for

“You’re a pure-blood, and I’m certain you aren’t supposed to read a novel written by the ‘non-magic’ folks. Plus, in the drawer of the bedside table is the collection of Lord of the Rings – a gift – I figured it out.”
“If I detested you, I would’ve ignored your presence. I’m not, am I?”
as he draped the warm cloak over his shoulder. The moonlight was dancing off his hair. It was unruly and wild in its short-but-not-too-short style. The stands were falling over his forehead.
He chuckled.
not to touch it,” The trace of malice was clear in the voice with a note of impatience. He was, however, forcing a stoic, calm mien on the face. “yet, you touched it on purpose –”
Harry frowned. Malfoy should’ve been starving, considering he hadn’t eaten in a while. Not that he cared, of course. He was merely curious. Besides, he didn’t have an appetite either. “I suppose we could bake cookies, if the oven –
He walked out of his bedroom and smiled. Potter never failed to cast a warming charm on the plate. Even if the wandless magic drained him. And he had left a note, beside a broken teacup.
“If you didn’t shut up about it and your father had to endure it a ‘
“If you behave, I’ll decide not to be Rapunzel for a while. And you won’t have to place notes to lure me out.”
Third December, 1996 – The flash of sliver. The falling stars. A whisper – He had to find out the fragment. A part concealed in his own mind. A blank canvas, he had already painted, and yet, the colours had been erased. Erased. Erased. Memories erased.
“Oh, shut up.” Malfoy mumbled, underlining it with a glare. It didn’t have the effect the blond had intended it to, and he cursed under his breath. “I can’t stand you.”
That he couldn’t get used to.
“Not patient, are you?” Draco turned the right ankle – uncurled the curve of the back – adjusted the position of the shoulders and pointed the wand in front of him. “and quit with the quips, Potter.”
“It’s not the end of the world, Malfoy.”
He sipped his tea, hot and sweet with a slice of lemon perfectly placed on the side of the cup. He stared at a picture on the mantle. Lucius Malfoy was laughing and Narcissa was watching him with a soft smile on her face. He had done a lot of damage. A sort of damage only a father can do.
Harry stared at the blond with a confused frown.
Harry arched an eyebrow at the blond and in a sarcastic drawl, he said, "Can you quit repeating your question, Malfoy?"
“We’re even,” He said, with a sly smirk. “You dislocated my jaw, and I would return the favor without hesitation. But – We’re even.”
"Could you make me a cup of tea, darling?" That was whispered with a soft eskimo kiss from Harry.
“A father is supposed to protect you,” Malfoy whispered with a scoff. “not put you in league with – what’s the reference you came up with – oh, yes, the wicked witch of the west with red cat eyes.”
He smirked, before finally taking the skates from him. He laced them up, and he followed him to the ice. He scowled, looking at the ice as though he wished to be anywhere else. Harry stepped onto the ice and moved to the side to give him some space. He held his hand out to the blond. “Give me your hand, I’ll help you.”
“Always the modest one,” Malfoy drawled sarcastically, and rolled his eyes. “I can’t detain you for seven years. I can’t even stand you for seven fucking minutes – And I don’t want you to be my immortal husband, Potter.”
"Don’t.”
Then again, he was convinced that Potter wouldn’t leave a note with lunch. Yet, he had.
Harry didn’t react. Not a scoff or a snort. If he did, he knew that he wouldn’t know the reason Malfoy was here. Malfoy wouldn’t talk.
Harry waved his hand dismissively, as he walked into the kitchen again. He opened the cabinets, only to close them again. He was starving. And he wanted to avoid Malfoy’s curious gaze. “Breakfast?”
“No. you can’t retract it. Not when it’s
A small wisp of white smoke came out from the end of his wand. It drifted lazily for a moment or two, before it faded. “well, it’ll take a dementor two seconds instead of one to take your soul.”
Harry clasped the right hand into his and couldn’t resist a small quip: “I’m Potter. Harry Potter.” Draco’s chuckle was light, laced with a soft him of amusement, which caused a small, familiar flutter in the brunet’s chest. “think my name is funny, do you?”
Harry felt a pang of guilt in his chest.
well, thank you for reading the fic so far<3 Comments and kudos are always appreciated uwu
If he wanted to perfect it, he had to focus on the flow of the charm and he had to avoid a sporadic result. He figured that Hermione would’ve taught him to control it. She wasn’t with him though, and he had to figure it out on his own.
“Christ, it not true,” Potter had a slight quiver to the voice, a flicker of regret crossing the features. “I swear, it’s not what –” A sigh. “well, you’re sort of bearable
It wasn’t working. The simplest spells weren’t working.
He smirked, as he stared at the blond. In the soft light of the moon, his pale skin had an almost angelic glow and he had a glint in his grey eyes. “We’ve already established that, haven’t we?”
“I can’t find myself among the stars mother,” Draco said, staring at the painting on the wall with a pained grimace. And he wished that she was here. Wished that she would ruffle his hair again and smile. “I am the dark sky without the stars.”
“And, for what it’s worth,” Malfoy half-turned to face him, and the eyes glistened with faint tears. “it wasn’t kind of father to send you to Otryazan amidst a war and certainly not for – well, your arch-nemesis.”
“Or a few years?” In the words laced with sarcasm was a trace of an odd, unfamiliar part which the brunet couldn’t quite pinpoint. A hope, perhaps? He forced it out. It wasn’t the right moment to ponder over it.
He frowned, tracing his finger over it as he continued to walk to the shore. In retrospect, he should’ve considered concealing it in plain sight. He didn’t wish to carry it.
Harry smirked, and let go of his hand, and Draco pitched forward. The smirk was wiped off his face, when he realized that he could skate without his assistance.
“Or we can curse,” Draco continued to curse, undeterred with the fact that he couldn’t string words into coherent sentences. It was sort of comical to watch the feeble attempts. “Finished, Malfoy?”
“You’re leaving tomorrow, aren’t you?” Draco asked quietly, schooling his features into the usual bored mien. But Harry could see through him. “To New York?”
“I’m not, Malfoy.”
Draco leading the way and Harry following, falling into step with Draco in an effortless way he never managed with Parvati. After a few minutes he looked up at Draco.
“Oh, Potter?” Malfoy said in a sarcastic monotone. “I’m certain I’ve provided one reason at least.”
Malfoy schooled his facial features into the usual bored mien, but he was uncertain. Harry was growling, his fingernails digging into his palm.
“Pfft. Can you imagine?” Draco said, with an ironic drawl. He could’ve never been a Hufflepuff. He wasn’t raised to be one. “father would’ve –
Malfoy chuckled. A strand of blond hair rested over his right eye, and he didn’t brush it off. It was kind of attractive in the silver light – wait, he wasn’t – He didn’t want to think about it.
“Pardon?” He had a soft, confused smile on the face at the abrupt change of tone and for once, Harry was reluctant to wipe it off Draco’s face. “why didn’t I, what?”
He felt a breath claw of his throat and the confidence returned in him while he dipped the blond to the floor in accordance with the music. He did not, however, raise him up. “Is it the right moment to mention how beautiful you look tonight?”
The argument continues
He had a perfect incentive to infuriate Draco Malfoy with the sarcastic retorts or quips – minus the insensitive ones, considering he wasn’t in a condition to fight. “Won’t.”
“Hey,” He whispers while he traces Draco’s cheekbone softly with the pad of the thumb. “why not?”
He placed the cup on the counter, and figured he could read a bit. Hermione would've been ecstatic if she saw - No. He could not think about her. Or Ron.
Draco and Harry have a civil conversation for once, with one quiet moment, a small confession and it went well until the mention of Lucius Malfoy.
With an uncertain sigh, he placed the back of two fingers on the warm neck which caused the blond to flinch within the grip. “Christ – wait – you’re feverish.”
"Yeah I'll come," she said eventually.
Harry nodded. "Yeah," he said, breathlessly. "I think maybe-" he paused, smiling into another one of Draco's gentle kisses.  "I think maybe I could try us for a little while."
Harry raises his wand, and deatheaters scream and start apparating away.
"No. Some other Draco," he said sarcastically. "Yes, Draco Malfoy."
"I love you too."
"Draco, stop. I was the one who couldn't see over the pile of books I was carrying. It was bound to cause a disaster sooner or later." Harry stood up, the pile of books in his arms.
Who was he kidding, his mail was delivered by owl through the window. He hadn't left the house in ages, Hermione was right. But leaving the house meant seeing people, and seeing people was not his strong suit. Especially if he might have to shake hands with some one. He didn't mean to appear rude, or germaphobic, as some thought him. He simply hadn't found his soul mate yet, and rather liked it that way.
Harry lifted a pile of books, heading back towards his office. He could barely see over the top of the pile, and he could feel it swaying as he walked.

"Draco, just leave it," his father says. "It's just a stupid boy."
Later that night Harry stood in his bedroom, tiredly rubbing his eyes as he let out a yawn. He pulled of his hoodie, tossing it into the corner of the room. He knew Hermione wouldn't be happy with him, but right now, he was too tired to care.
Harry groaned. Work was the last think he wanted to think about right now. He had tried using it as a distraction, and ended up getting himself too far in. He hadn't been in in almost two weeks. They were easy on him, because of the whole 'golden boy saved the world' thing. Usually he hated that rep, but recently it's been nice not getting a billion calls from work when he didn't go in, though he knew there was at least two people on staff, just dying to call in and get him fired.
After all that happened, you deserve that much. You deserve anything I can give you.
Hermione’s only trying to make me pity you and take care of you. I need to take care of your feelings, she says, to make an effort, to come to you and… what? Become your friend?
I guess this letter is an attempt to get you away from my head. There, it’s written and I’m writing it again : you can’t be in love with me. I don’t want to be your friend. End of discussion, no need to fuss around about it.
Potter.
In fact, to be perfectly honest with myself, I kissed you.
For once, I’ll forget my pride and stop trying to be so composed in front of you, who’s always so calm and strong, who’s got wisdom somewhere in the last years Merlin’s knows how. I beg you to take pity of me, of my misery and my loneliness. I need you and I never knew how much I did before I lost you.
Even since you’ve left me, my life has been shit. I don’t sleep, my nightmares came back, my house is a prison, my wife can’t understand what’s happening, neither do my friend; I don’t know how to speak about all those things inside me and I can’t, I simply can’t live without you. I won’t. I refuse to let you go without a fight.
The good part is (I really, really can’t send this letter) you may get out now. Luna thinks so, anyway. Your mother is doing well for the community, it seems like you’re not doing anything stupid in there so… Well. Maybe you’ll be out next Christmas.
I’m sorry I made you feel like a third wheel. You never were and never will be. You have no idea how much you attract people, how much they come to you and think of you, must it be in a bad or a good way. I know something about that.
I hate you, I truly do.
But if you have anything left for me... any love, any hope, anything in you that can give me that second chance, please keep that letter. Don’t come back, take a day or two, I’ll wait for you. Give me a chance and I’ll do anything, absolutely anything to deserve you.
Fuck you.
Potter
I hate that feeling almost as much as I hate you.
The look in your face when I said that to you...
Harry.
Call me self-centered but I can’t help but think that this is about me. In one way or another. One fucked-up way or another.
Well, of course there is Luna, who says that you’re getting better and better now. “You know Harry, he’s changed a lot the past few years!” she would say to me, but I just can’t figure it in my head. I wouldn’t know, would I? I have no way of telling what changed in you, what happened in your head. After all that went on, can you really go back that much in the right path? Sometimes I remember what I said during your trial and I don’t know if I believed it at the time. It just seemed the right thing to do.
You, kicked out? The little boy who always cried for his dad and mom to come solve anything that would upset him? Of course, I didn’t believe her at first. Surely you simply left the house to get a flat by yourself and live in leisure now that you’re rich and free.
You can’t imagine how much of a burden it is to me.
In my defense, it was a very strange night. You got too close to me, in too many ways, and I wasn’t supposed to see you weak like that. For the first time in years I saw you without your walls up. You were looking vulnerable, soft, human.
Malfoy,
It’s just that I have a mission, a mission you couldn’t understand. Sometimes I think about that, about all those things that happened and that you couldn’t understand. Who could believe that you were, once, the master of the Elder Wand. You never wielded it but, if you had, what would have happened?
But here I am, once again, writing to you even after you sent back all of my owls, my letters unopened and not even a word of hate from you.
I hope this is a fluke, a one-time thing, a stupid mistake because Ginny is on her period and you've been single for all your life.
If I ever sent a letter to you (certainly not this one), I guess I would ask you exactly what you regret.
And sometimes I wish that you end up doing something in prison, something bad that gets you a life-sentence so you never get out, never travel the world, never live the life that’s supposed to be mine.
The ways your eyes grabbed mine and made my stomach turn on itself. It hurt so bad to realise the power you had on me.
Is it the way you treated Hermione? Or me? The time when you tried to have Buck killed? Even though it was clearly your stupid ass fault?
I'm in love with you.
Harry Potter.
I’m sorry I lied to you about Ginny, my marriage, my sexuality. I wanted you to think I was unhappy with her so you would take pity on me. I couldn’t explain to you how I could want you both, and need you both, each of you in their own special way.
My love,
Luna says it’s because of your friends and your upbringing that you ended up like that… And she says that with such a sad voice that I start to wonder if I could have made a difference. Could I have treated you in a way that could have helped? I don’t think about the first years, because you were truly insufferable. But something changed in sixth year, right? If I hadn’t attacked  you, that day in the bathroom, what would you have done? Do you think we could have talked?
Yours,
We kissed.
I don’t know what you’re trying to pull, Malfoy, but it’s not fooling me.
I am in Paris with you, I found you, I made you listen to me and I made you take that letter. Now you’re reading it and I’m waiting for you, somewhere, certainly not far, waiting for your reply.
Maybe we shouldn't have talked. We shouldn't have walked under the moonlight and shared stories. But you were so close and I understood you for the very first time, how could I not forgive you? Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything, nor  that everything was in the past or that I could see you were trying to be better.
I want you to understand that I didn’t know before you, I had no idea that Ginny was pregnant before she announced it on my birthday. It was her surprise to me and I would have never, never wanted you to hear about it like that.
I still feel the heat of your mouth on mine, I remember vividly your shaking hands, your flustered eyes, the way they expanded with fear when we stopped doing it. You have the deepest eyes Malfoy, do you know that? And you look at me too much, with such intensity I feel myself shiver every time I notice it. It’s because of them, entirely because of them that I let that kiss happen. Believe me I didn’t intend to prior to tonight, I didn’t plan it or anticipate it. It simply happened. And those eyes, they were different after we stopped. They reminded me of that day, in the bathroom at Hogwarts, when I attacked you. You had seemed so scared, so fragile in that moment. As you did just after our kiss, when we looked at each other in silence, while I was still trying to understand what happened.
“I can’t operate an oven.”
“You didn’t use any of the sappy endearments for once today.”
hello!
He didn’t suppose that Potter would leave a note with lunch. He would find the crumbled piece of parchment, and read it. He wouldn’t leave another one.
“An astute observation, Potter.” Draco said with a scoff and tilted his head at the sky. It was starting to lighten, tinted with a bit of gold. “So, you can hum and conjure a corporeal wandless patronus. Show off.”
“If the genie can fulfil wishes, you could wish for the war to end instead of flying out of Otryazan with a carpet and fighting a war against The Dark Lord.”
It was pitch-black, for a while. He waited. Waited for his pupils to adjust to the absence of light. Within a moment, the outline of Draco’s figure was visible. A faint luminescence of the moon cascaded inside through the windows. “Godric, what –”
“Mhm, sure.” The brunet said, oblivious to the fact that Draco Malfoy had cast a wandless warming charm over them in a rather subtle manner. After all,
It was almost a whisper.
It was Draco Malfoy.
So cold. So tired. So hollow.
“Hush, we’re having a moment, Potter.”
He didn’t find a note.
“I figured, considering you’re as graceful as a cat on ice.”
Draco had asked him for a dance, leading him away from the castle. At first, he was taken aback by the change in behavior. Yet, he had agreed.
Yet, the smile on Draco’s face didn’t leave. A comfortable silence lingered in the air with an occasional murmur or a soft curse and when the brunet muttered incoherent curses, he couldn’t resist a smile.
Malfoy paused.
The storm retreated in an hour, though a soft drizzle still remained. He closed the novel and stared out of the window. The sea wasn't turbulent, and the sky wasn't leaden with the rain clouds. He couldn't spot the peculiar seagulls, and it was certainly an improvement.
The closeness was sort of overwhelming. He wasn't touched often. Or embraced. He had never been the recipient of a soft, warm touch or of an intimacy and it caused the flicker of panic in him.
“I’ll consider it,” Draco said, underlining it with a well-practiced smirk. It was amusing to rile up the brunet, and the muffled groan he received in response was worth it. “You want to read another novel or –
“Or about the task you were given by your precious Dark Lord.”
Draco’s stomach clenched and his fingers curled into a fist at the side. He wasn’t certain if he could forget what he had said with one simple, forced ‘
“– Why don’t you? I’ll befriend Peter Pan, and defeat Captain Hook instead of dealing with Wicked witch of the west with red cat eyes.”
“I have the essence of dittany inside,” Draco said, clearing his throat as he pulled away. The corner of his lip twitched, before curling into the well-practiced smirk.  “I’ll kick you out if you snore.”
, would’ve said if they were in the situation that we are in and, then, you say it yourself?”
He felt like he was drowning, breathing in heavily and quickly, but none of it was reaching his lungs. His vision was going blurry and his whole body was shaking. He felt his body shake with the intensity of the emotions roiling in his gut, clambering to climb out of him in static bursts of wild magic.
(See the end of the chapter for
With a chuckle, he dismissed the painful anagrams out of his mind, and wandered off to the kitchen, humming a song he would often listen to on the radio as Aunt Petunia would clean the house.
If Malfoy heard that, Harry wouldn’t live to see the light of the next day. Not that he cared. He would willingly die than be around Draco Malfoy and lose his sanity in Otryazan. Provided he hadn’t already lost it.
“At Thirteen.”
He inhaled sharply, as his mind traced back to the night near the seashore. He had painted a sky of Harry Potter’s fancy on the canvas. A sky that was alive. Chaotic. A sky with dim stars. And it was – beautiful.
“Against a Death Eater?”
"Consider what exactly? Whether you can actually trust me? And what, now you do?" A scoff made its way out of Draco's mouth before he could even stop it.
He had never been safe.
He had been suffering ever since he had been sent here. And he had a lot to worry about. It was so ridiculously infuriating. To put it mildly, he wanted to drown in the sea. Malfoy would be amused, and he would probably eat popcorn, and watch.
Why? Lucius could’ve presented his head to Voldemort on a silver platter. Yet, he hadn’t. He had only disarmed him, and sent him here. To Draco Malfoy.
He decided to wait.
“I’ll take two, considering they don’t even qualify as chocolates.”
“Oh, thank you.” He said with an irreverent snort, resisting the urge to punch Malfoy in the face and fracture the straight, perfect nose. “I can’t tolerate your voice with your elbow inside my rib cage.”
Harry let out a soft sigh.
Draco scowled while he rose from the chair. He curled his fingers into a fist at his side and with a derisive sneer, he asked, “You want answers to what, Potter?”
And so, the war began. They reached for clumps of freezing snow as the morning sun shone brightly in the sky. Harry had snow in his hair, jacket, boots, sweatshirt, and mittens, but he laughed in delight as Draco got him with another snowball.
“You were thinking about what I figured was lighting
“It’s –” Draco’s warm breath brushed on the side of the brunet’s neck, causing a shiver to travel down his spine, his arm circling around Malfoy’s waist in a firm grip. “It’s not – no.”
He didn’t understand Malfoy. Yet, he didn’t suppose that he wanted to be on the other side of the war. It was self-preservation. A price to pay, to keep his family safe. To keep them alive. And it would induce a sort of fear. Fear of death if you don’t obey. To watch death. No, he didn’t understand Draco Malfoy.
He didn’t want to strike a conversation with Harry Potter. Yet, he couldn’t watch the boy drain himself, and he didn’t suppose that Potter had a wand, because Draco was still in one piece. He traced his fingers across his jaw absent-mindedly, and let out an irritated sigh.
Draco’s brows knitted together, “Right, of course, why wouldn’t you, the precious chosen one, our dear saviour, care?” He said with a scoff and underlined the words with a cold stare, while he continued to tap his fingers on the kitchen counter. “I’m sorry, it was rather presumptuous to assume otherwise.”
“No you don’t –” He cleared his throat, carding his fingers through the unruly hair and in an uncertain, voice, he whispered, "wait, no, right now, you do,” It elicited a laugh out of Draco “it’s a rare privilege.”
The blond whirled on him, fists clenched at the side and the nails digging into the palm, face reddening with rage. “Right, perhaps I didn’t provide a reason but neither did you, Potter.”
"Nonsense. You're the sweetest and most precious little thing ever. Salty and bitter my arse, you're my delicious boyfriend, aren't you?" Punctuating his words by squishing Draco's cheeks and making him pucker his lips, placing a chaste kiss on them.
“And I love galaxies.” Draco whispered, and all the nervousness he was so prone to feeling washed out of him like a tidal wave, flooding from the tips of his fingers and crashing out of his mouth as it parted in the slightest way, almost invisible.
“Set you on fire in your sleep?” He asked, a smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. “No promises.”
“You had no idea of the fact that you were Harry Potter – The Saviour of the Wizarding World?”
“You could write articles about yourself,” A beat. “of how you’re a moronic fuck with a saviour complex.”
“Oh well,” Harry said with a slight sarcasm to his voice, one corner of his mouth curving upward and into a satisfied smirk. “six years without Draco Malfoy to show-off to isn’t an idea I want to entertain.”
“Oh, you’ll wish I had spoiled it for you as you reach the end.”
said?
He let his mind wander, and it drifted to various memories. Memories at Hogwarts. At the Manor. The dark ones. The beautiful ones. And the most recent ones.
The clinking paused, and he heard a soft scratching of a quill. A crumbling of parchment. Light footsteps. And it caused a tiny flutter in his chest. A warmth coursed through him. Potter cared. If only a little.
’ with a chuckle while one of his fingers traced a small circle on the pocket-watch and he said, “You’re familiar with my tea preferences, why are you asking?”
Draco scrambled to his feet, and cursed under his breath. The rage was subsiding slowly, and it was replaced by grief. He was dead – Lucius Malfoy was dead. And Draco was numb inside. “Why didn’t you fight back?”
“Wait,” Malfoy cut him off, a confused frown etched on his face. “Why were you – Harry Potter: The epitome of light – in Borgin and Burkes? It’s not a place for the boy-who-lived, you know?”
A brief flicker of rage flared in him as the words settled in. He couldn’t – wouldn’t – stop searching for a way out. “Oh, only because you’ve quit trying –
"Oh, does it include the time you broke my nose?"
“Oh, no.” Draco said with a short laugh and re-adjusted to cast the Patronus which still wasn’t precise. “I’m better than everyone else. An opinion that is backed up with sufficient evidence, Potter.”
In retrospect, he should’ve been a bit calmer. Sadly, it wasn’t his forte around Draco Malfoy. Fate was cruel. He would’ve tolerated Gollum – an evil, little hobbit with a ring fetish – He could not tolerate a full tilt diva with a skincare routine or – Oh, forget it.
“If we’re clear about the fact that I still can’t stand you and I fucking don’t want to be around you –
“I regret to inform you that I must Obliviate you, now that you are clued in on the fact that I have a skin and hair care routine,” Draco’s mouth curled into a familiar smirk. “One charm and you’ll forget.”
Harry couldn’t maintain a serious voice, and his lips were slightly upturned as he said, “Was it amusing to watch the entire
He didn’t write the last bit. He had hinted at it subtly. If Potter broke a few more teacups, and ruined the kitchen slightly, he’d be forced to come out of the bedroom. Not that he wanted to. He wasn’t ready to forgive Potter. Not yet. And he didn’t suppose that Potter was ready to forgive him.
A beacon of light pierced through the delicate glass. Warm yellow rays were drifting through the window. Dust modes floating, suspended in the air. Draco mused through the kitchen cabinet, only to close it with a loud thud. He set the saucer and the cup out, pouring the tea with a delicate swish of his hand.
“Yes, your royal highness.” He said in a slow, sarcastic drawl, “wait, right, no quips,” he forced on a serious mien on the face. “I’m sorry, continue.”
The painting of the sky crossed his mind. As intrusive as it was, the painting had intrigued him. Or maybe the fact that Draco Malfoy could paint such a beautiful sky was intriguing.
When he had paused, he had seen a flicker of understanding in Potter’s eyes. It was almost as if he had known. Or he had been there. “Why?”
He clenched his fists at the side, the familiar rage rising within. The artifact was warm, pulsating in the pocket, weighing down. Then, in a spur of moment, he half-yelled, “Oh, what if it is?”
He couldn’t react to it – was rooted to the spot – fingers trembling at his side and brushing over the warm, pulsating artifact. A small part of him was concerned that Malfoy would come up with a sardonic comment and it would cause a fight, considering the unfolding of recent events, when it was a family-related topic.
“I would be dead if I drew him in a dress, Potter.”
“I - I don’t know.”
With that, he drifted off to a dreamless sleep.
or a quip at least. Yet, he didn’t feel like it now. Because – Draco Malfoy was kind of beautiful.
What the fuck are you doing here? Why the fuck must I deal with you again? How dare you, how fucking dare you talk to my friends? Get close to Luna? Invade my life like that?
I wonder if you feel guilty. Or if you think I’m responsible for his death, when I’m not. I’m not an Auror you know, I don’t know if anyone told you.  I don’t investigate, I don’t take any risks anymore… I wish they had been more careful when apprehending him. I wish they had restrained their fire.
At the time I didn’t care but now, back in my room, alone with my thoughts and my quill, I can’t help but wonder. What were you so afraid of, Malfoy? Was it me? It seems absurd to be because you seem invincible ever since you got out of Azkaban. Scared of nothing. I had been expecting you to be weak and dirty, with an edge in your voice just like Sirius. But you were nothing like that. In fact you lost that edge you had for so long in Hogwarts, as if Azkaban had taken the fire in your veins and replaced it with liquid ice.
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you we were trying to have a child. I never thought it could happen, especially this fast. I didn’t think I could and we were talking about adopting if it didn’t work. You see, I died once and I had always thought, always felt I couldn’t give life to someone after that. I had used that right, you see? And it seemed fair, truly, to sacrifice my right to give life so I could kill Him. Even though I wanted children so bad. Even though having a family is what I want most in the world, terrifying as it may be.
Draco,
And then, she told me you got kicked out.
So yeah, I guess I wanted to put that somewhere, say it to someone: I may defend you tomorrow but it’s not because I like you or because I forgave you. It’s because I’m better than you’ll ever be. I’ll save your stupid ass every time you need it because I won’t let you die if I can help it.
Fuck you Malfoy.
You were supposed to go to France! Maybe pass by, spend a little time with us but… not invade my life, my friends, my house… As if I wanted to see you and be reminded of you when I am with my friends. I hate it, I hate you.
I can’t think of Ginny right now, I simply can’t.
It’s been two years since our first kiss and I still don’t know where we stand, or what the fuck we are doing. Getting close to you was nothing like I had expected. Getting into your bed was something I had never experienced before, something so far from what I do with Ginny that I could easily believe we’re not having sex. I thought it was something that took control of me in the fever of the night, something I had to try because I never did something with anyone beside Ginny, least of all a man. I wasn’t supposed to get caught up in it. I wasn’t supposed to miss you like crazy every time you went to France. But it’s true. I fake it with all my heart but I can feel the unjust feeling of jealousy creeping in. I hate it when Hermione and Ron joke about finding you a boyfriend. I hate it when I have to leave your flat and I feel you watching me, taking me in, like you fear I'll never come back. If I could, I would stay overnight, from Friday night to Monday morning, I would sleep naked next to you, and your skin would never get cold from not being touched.
Harry.
I feel like if I were to say to anyone that I have forgiven you they'll see right through me. They'll see everything I can't understand myself and everything will come crumbling down. I hope next time I see you we will control each other, keep away from one another and forget everything that has happened. I'm scared of you kissing me again and how it would make me feel to be in your arms.
I need you, Draco.
I have no solution for you, I have no magic trick that can solve this situation easily but I’ll try, I’ll do my best.
Seriously?
Malfoy,
If you’re reading this letter, I have succeeded in finding you.
I am myself in a cell.
Your father died yesterday. It happened last night and they (The Ministry) announced it today, it’s Ginny that told me and I cried without understanding why. It’s the strangest feeling, to have that sadness thrown upon you without knowing where it comes from. It was like I was freed from something and pain entertwined with relief before I thought of you. Did you know? Who told you? Was it a friend in a letter or someone from there, throwing it at your face with a laugh?
I have ruined everything. I have lost you, you’re gone and I’m alone, now, with letters I never sent and words I should have told you. You’re gone and you think I despise you, that you’re nothing but a strange mistake I made on a whim, to get sex and to distract myself from my marriage. You’re not, you’ve never been and you’re much much more than that.
The point is, you’ll be out someday if all goes according to plan. You’ll be out and for Merlin’s sake I sincerely hope you’ll get on the first Portkey to France to live with some distant family and leave us in peace. No more Malfoy, no more Draco, no more of your stupid and pointed face popping in my mind when I want to relax.
With this wish I go to bed.
Fuck.
Let me come back to you, let me prove to you how much you mean to me. I have treated you so bad, I have made you feel like such shit, it’s only natural that you could do the same to me.
We kissed.
It’s hard not to think of you. Luna speaks about you nearly every week, like you’re her new project or something. You’re exchanging letters, apparently. I must be stupid because I didn't even know that you could send letters there, or that prisoners could write back.
I’m married now. I’m married to the most beautiful and amazing woman I've ever met. I’m happy. My friends, the few ones that are left, are happy too. We got out of this war, one year after the other and we did it together. Of course we have nightmares and times that are rough but who doesn’t?
And now I’m not going to sleep tonight because you’ll be at the pub with everyone tomorrow and I know, I just know I’m going to overthink it.
In this other world I sent you all those letters, I'm not in love with Ginny, I can convince you to stop your journeys and your quest, you love me so much you want to live in the country too and your biggest dream is to get settled down and have a family with me. You like children, you like whatever job you could get, you help me get through this life I molded myself into. We spend our lives together and we grow old together. And you were never a second choice and I was never a cheater.
I didn't intend to catch you when you tripped. I didn't intend to grab you by the waist or feel your wrist under my fingers. Your skin is insanely cold, Malfoy, or I was the one burning up. And you have the deepest eyes when you stare at someone, it makes one drown and forget oneself. I certainly forgot who I was when I kissed you in that moment.
I guess you’ll get a few years? Three at the most, if you haven’t hidden something from me. Again. Any murder hidden under your bed, Malfoy? What did your father make you do? Your aunt, your mother? Luna told me you killed “almost” no one in the battle, and you could call legitimate defense. As if.
You will never read those words, you will never get this letter. There is no way I’m going to let you understand me that much, even if insulting you to your face is so very tempting. Nobody is going to see it, not Hermione, nor Ron, nor Ginny. I can’t talk to them about that, everything is too fresh, the battle was only a few months ago, and I still hear those voices and crashes in my head, awake or asleep. I know that everyone else does too. It’s not easy to talk about it.
With hope of never seeing this letter again.
It’s no use asking myself that though, because I’m master of it now, and if I want to break its power I have to die a natural death. That’s the promise I made Dumbledore two years ago. I have to die of old age, I have to live a life without any risk and any danger. I can’t become an Auror, I can’t travel the world, I simply can’t anymore because if I do, if someone kills me, then they will have a power no witch or wizard should possess. And I can’t let that happen.
Fuck it, it’s not because someone is gay, or likes blokes, that he’s hot for all of them… It doesn’t mean that you would, that you of all people would want me. I’m married. I must have ruined your life just as much as you ruined mine. If I hadn’t been there, everyone would be under Voldemort’s rule and everything would be fine for you, right?
I'm in such deep shit because I love you, because if I ever said it to you, you wouldn't even believe me. How could you? I’m so caught up in my lies I don’t remember which ones are true and which are false when I’m with you.
“Careful, Potter.” Draco said, the corner of his mouth curling into a well-practiced smirk, yet it wasn’t enough to conceal the pink tint on his cheeks. “That was a compliment.”
Draco’s mind traced to one of the recent memories – of when Narcissa and Draco had escaped the Manor for a few hours and had wandered into London – a few care-free hours. “
“Where are we going?” Draco asked, out of curiosity. Harry only chuckled, because the blond had absolutely no idea and he would probably have a stroke if he knew. “Will you just – I won’t kiss you.”
"Have you, really? It's quite hard to believe considering all that you've said to me recently," Draco hated to continue bringing it up but he really couldn't help it anymore, "I'm certain you wouldn't have had the reaction you did if you'd understood the extents of my self-preservation tendencies at all."
“Yes,” With the thin, weak fingers curled around Harry's right arm, Draco’s body untangled itself out of the confinement and steadied. “Yes, I can –”
Draco flinches, lifting his head, staring at him in confusion while Harry figures out how to funnel what he wants to say to Draco into words. “You – you want to come out to the others?”
’ face,” He said in a slow, sour drawl. “I will, if screw up your chance, clear?”
Draco arched an eyebrow at him. The fact that Potter had survived over the course of seven years was rather astounding. The idiot had no regard for his own well-being. “Define complex.”
Malfoy smirked, and gave a slight shake to his head. With a sigh, he poured the chocolate chips and started folding the dough.
“I – yeah,” Draco’s fingers were trembling at the side and he couldn’t focus on the words or on the motion of the wand – instead, he was focused on the touch – on the warm breath on the back of the neck. “Right.”
It was a light-hearted, carefree conversation. Quips, instead of venomous retorts. He wanted it to continue, that's a first. “Draco, you wouldn’t Obliviate your friend now, would you?”
glare towards him. “Not another word, Potter.”
In the morning, a warm cup of tea was waiting on the kitchen counter. Draco almost smiled as he sipped the tea. Almost. It faltered as he traced back to the conversation near the seashore at night.
“The chosen one who fainted when he saw the Dementors which was rather amusing to you and your house-mates and you created quite a spectacle out of it.”
The silence returned, and it was rather uncomfortable. He turned to leave, and Malfoy reached out and caught his elbow without thinking, tightening his grip and he only half-turned back.
“Apart from being trapped in a place that doesn’t exist on the globe, suffering from broken bones, tolerating your presence and humiliation that I’m not capable of handling – I’m dandy.”
"Hey," He said, as he placed a single finger under his chin. "It was a panic attack, wasn't it?"
and flip the bird at fate. Or not. It would worsen the situation. Not that he never wanted a vacation, but to be stranded on a severed Island with Draco Malfoy was not a fucking vacation.
?” A breath clawed out of the brunet’s throat. He winced at how venomous his voice was, cleared his throat and softly whispered, “why not?”
He bites his lip to keep himself from grinning as Draco furrows his brows and nods distractedly, going along with the change of topic.
"The point," An uneven breath stuttered out of his mouth, while he reconsidered the words, "Is that our fight, right now, isn't about how I said you were the one person I didn't want to be with," He winced at the words. "It's your self-preservation tendencies on how I said I won't stay in Otryazan for over a year.”
“I’ll ignore it,” The blond said with an unamused snort, yet he had a faint smile and the flutter returned. A small irritating flutter. “You can’t resist a reference, can you?”
“Point proven.” The anxious frown was replaced with an amused glint while the corner of his mouth curved upward into a lopsided grin. “Scoreboard: Harry Potter – 1, Draco Malfoy – 0.”
Harry frowned, mouth simpering, while carding his fingers through his unruly hair. Once, the prospect of working in the Ministry had been sort of appealing. Now, when he considered recent events, he was conflicted. Plus, he wasn’t concerned about a career when he wasn’t certain if he would win the war. If he would survive. Yet, he had an ambition once. “Oh, I wanted to be an Auror.”
With a nod, he pointed the wand in the front – Narcissa reading at night in a calm voice, the soft hums – walking to the lake in the evening when he was in London with her. “
The sky was painted in water colour splashes of a variety of deep blue shades, speckled with little white stars. And while Harry Potter was pointing out different constellations and rambling on about space and just how interesting he thought it was, Draco was just listening.
One song drifted to another familiar one. A song he was rather fond of. It was a song he would play on the road-trips with Draco. “Oh, it’s our favourite song.”
“I might’ve mentioned a while ago that I wouldn’t’ve solved the complex riddles if not for Hermione,” He had a distinct change to the voice. It was softer, drenched in fondness. It had a small trace of fear as well. He wouldn’t’ve survived for six years without his best friends. “Ron, too.”
With a faint chuckle, Harry opened the front door. It created a soft creaking sound. The candlelight added a warm glow to the living room. Draco flicked his wand to the grate, igniting it. “Can you quit cursing in French?”
“Oh, you’re still the envious prat, aren’t you?”
Harry growled, and a punch landed on Malfoy’s jaw. Another. He couldn’t focus. He wanted to scream, and get away from Malfoy. He stumbled back, his chest heaving. “You deserved that, Malfoy”
“Captain Hook, only to cleverly deceive him and push him into the water where the crocodiles will feast on him, while you find a way out of Otryazan with the ship?”
“Oh, Of course I’m well-versed with the term, Malfoy.” Potter said with a scoff, fingers unclenching at the side as he regained composure. “It’s – I’ve never noticed it before.”
“Of the infinite lights,” He cocked his head to the side with a slow exhale while his eyes were fixated on the sky, and in a soft whisper he said, “Quite prefer the stars over the moon.”
Harry arched an eyebrow at him. If Malfoy was aiming for the element of surprise, it wasn’t working. Granted, he hadn’t been anticipating Malfoy to be out by supper, it was certainly another small victory. “Out of the room you imprisoned yourself in, Rapunzel?”
Harry groaned in frustration, carding his fingers through his hair and moved away. “If it’s one of your twisted plans to get a piece of information out of me –
“Save him.” Harry said coldly, as he stared right into Malfoy’s eyes. “He asked me to save you. And yes, I had the fucking audacity to keep it from you because I. Don’t. Fucking. Trust. You.”
The throbbing was fainter now. Fainter, but still there.
well, shit, I forgot I had to post the next chapter but anyways, here it is-
“I prefer fairly-tales.” He chuckled, and inched a little bit closer to him. Only a little. “A bit of angst, and a little bit of an adventure, yet it turns out well in the end.”
Words had vanished from Harry's mind. His throat was left parched and the twinge in his chest intensified. He had a strange and compelling urge to comfort Draco but he couldn’t figure out how. Now, his thoughts were a whirlwind. “Draco -"
“Can you remember who you were, before the world told you who you should be?”
“Right, you can revel in your glory – It doesn’t fucking mean you can come up with sarcastic retorts to rile me up, Potter.” Malfoy had a rather inscrutable mien on his face.  “Plus, you’re rather daft.”
“I was,” He said carding his fingers through his hair, as he forced it out of his head. “I saw you. You didn’t want to do it. You couldn’t kill a man – So, Snape did it instead.”
– fucking – oh,
It was sort of odd. A serious conversation – A civil conversation about family – with Draco Malfoy would’ve sounded far-fetched a year ago. “I – why not?”
Draco opened his eyes to a silver light and soft humming. It was a familiar song. In hindsight, he should’ve thrown a fit, considering he was resting his head on Potter’s shoulder. But instead, he paused and felt his breath hitch.
menace.”
“Oh.” Harry couldn’t decide the next words. Plus, he didn’t want to screw up a civil conversation and turn it into a fight. “Right, it’s obvious.”
“Right, of course,” Draco’s tone went light, clipped, superficial. A tone Harry was familiar with. It was laced with a trace of venom but it was forced. “Why would you, indeed.”
He was convinced that the front page of the prophet would contain an absurd headline with a picture of Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter. It would cause a stir. "You're certain?"
Neither could he lose it. The ordeal was slightly infuriating. It was warmer, and pulsating in a rather familiar way. He couldn’t un-glamour it either. Or else Malfoy would find out.
which refrains from sarcasm,” One corner of Draco’s mouth curved into a small smirk. “you can’t censor your sarcasm, Potter.”
“And you’re sad that you couldn't drizzle the chocolate syrup over your crepes, Potter.”
He had perfected the levitation charm and it felt fantastic. He was content with the little progress. Hermione would’ve been insanely proud. And Ron would’ve been Ron about it.
“And to find out about the wizarding world at eleven was insanely absurd, I didn’t complain about the existence of wizards. You shouldn’t complain about the existence of hair induced with magic.”
He was in the living room with Draco, surrounded by chocolates and The Lion King was playing on the television. Draco was insanely fond of the movie. Harry absolutely adored the glint in his eyes – the pure childish delight – as Timon and Pumbaa danced.
"You can’t be serious, Malfoy.”
Harry snorted. He cracked an egg in the bowl, and started whisking it. Malfoy fetched the flour, and the rest of the ingredients for the cookies.
“I would’ve preferred it as well,” He muttered softly, as a twinge of nostalgia hit him. Of course, he had used magic to build the house, but it had drained him. He hadn’t focused on the details, because it wasn’t home. It never would be.
He placed a folded parchment on the side of the plate, and it read:
He frowned in confusion, as he scanned the area. To the south-west, he saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was still buried in the mist. They were sharp and conical in figure.
A panic engulfed Draco’s mind and he focused on forcing the cold, disconcerting thoughts of the manor out of the mind. With a slow exhale, he whispered, “I can’t.”
“I figured you were rather pleased with the view when I caught you staring,” Draco said with a small snort. “you weren’t very subtle, Potter.”
He paused abruptly. He felt something in his chest swell almost painfully at the thought of his father. The pain still ebbed and flowed, but the turning tides were less intense, less overwhelming. Yet, it didn’t cease to hurt.
“Yes, well, you’re the one casting a glamour on the eyes to conceal the fact that you’ve got heterochromia, Malfoy – Plus, I can’t figure why you want a glamour on the eyes – It –” He paused. “It – er – suits you.”
It made Draco's face almost glow, like some heavenly being. Harry thought with a soft blush, brushing the light dusting of snow from Draco's robes. Draco smiled as he noticed Harry's flushed cheeks, pulling the brunette close.
Draco cleared his throat slightly and nodded softly. "Yeah. I've been having the panic attacks for years."
And with the half-finished tea, was a note:
Draco gave a dry laugh. An actual laugh, and not the usual snigger.
"Yeah.”
. Now, if we’re quite finished with pleasantries – we can begin – so, force out the distractions in your mind and focus solely on the flow of your magic and direct it to the desired result while -
“A ferret.”
“I wasn’t staring at that ridiculous arse of yours, in those hideous jeans and – Fine, I was staring at your arse.”
"Changing your mind awfully quick, aren't you, Potter?" Draco couldn't contain his skepticism which was overshadowed by the incessantly reigniting hope in his being that wouldn't blow out no matter how much he wanted to it
“You’re cruel, Malfoy.”
“You’ve ruined me, father.” He said softly, a weak smile on his face. He didn’t want to be dragged into a war that wasn’t his problem. He never wanted to choose sides. “I never wanted to be a part of a war. I wanted to be safe. You were supposed to keep me safe.”
“Oh, fair enough.” He said with a snort. A pause. Draco placed a hand on his mouth, stifling a laugh. Christ, the situation was an ongoing catastrophe. “wait, perfect face?”
He collapsed on the floor as realization dawned on him:
fond of. “Rule six in Draco Malfoy’s
Draco kisses him softly, slowly which causes a warmth to course through him. "Is that a yes, love?"
No, he didn’t get splinched. That would’ve been paradise, considering he was still on the Island, only a few yards away from the seashore. In the same Island as Draco Malfoy.
Harry crossed his arms over his chest and as he opened his eyes, he recognized it as a mirror to Malfoy’s tic and uncrossed them. “You’ve been an arse to me in the recent years, Malfoy. In case you've forgotten. Six fucking years.”
. What do you want to be rewarded with, Mr. Malfoy – A gold star?”
"Pansy, for starters, might've mentioned it once or twice when we were working on a case," He said with a sigh. "she was on about a black dress for four hours," Draco shifted slightly, curling his fingers around the soft fabric. "for what it's worth, it suits you."
“Er,” Harry said, clearing his throat awkwardly. “Is eggs and bacon alright? Or I could make crepes.”
Harry remained silent. He didn’t imagine that Malfoy could’ve said ‘no’ to Lucius. If he wanted his son to be a death eater, then he would be one. And Lucius wouldn’t reason with Voldemort. Not even for Draco.
He placed it in the pocket and Draco’s eyes drifted to it, as though the gold artifact was visible through the fabric. It was warm. “It’s – nothing.”
He had a chaos to deal with – The chaos of a war – A war he had to win. If he was in Otryazan, he couldn’t win the war. He had to find the rest of the horcruxes. He had to face Voldemort and defeat him.
He had been turning in his bed all night, and had the incessant need to punch his arch nemesis. In retrospect, he shouldn’t have been insensitive. He didn’t stand by his father. Yet, he still loved him.
He wants to come out to the others. He wants to kiss Draco whenever he wants to. He wants to walk Draco to class. He wants to study with Draco or play capture the snitch with him. He wants to whisper a soft ‘I love you’ with a tender kiss in front of the others instead of coming up to the Astronomy Tower at night. “We can.”
He laughed. Again. Only Malfoy had that effect on him. And he didn’t know if he felt particularly thrilled about it.
Draco shifted closer, and the blond hair tickled the side of the brunet’s face. The strands of blond hair were tousled and falling on his face. The fear started to subside, and he averted his eyes to the sea with a sigh.
“At least I have the skittles.”
“Quit with the orders, Malfoy – You’re not the fucking prince of Slytherin in Otryazan – and you will certainly not order me around.” He countered in a low voice. “If I could get off you, I fucking would.”
The soft silver light of the stag was comforting. The presence of a patronus twined and circled around him in a cocoon of warmth. The hum was slower. It was nearing the end.
A click. The ring was on the mantelpiece. Draco cast a final glance at the ring and turned to the door of the bedroom. “Perhaps –” Draco said in a soft voice, pausing for a brief second. “you and I – we can’t be friends.”
Draco smiled. “Or a side with a pitch-black sky, where infinite falling stars streak the night sky, and live instead of burning out.”
The spells were flying fast, and a haze of smoke hung over the place, mixing with the acrid scent of ozone. Blood dripped slowly from a cut above his eyes. Thunderous booms echoed around him, until he wasn’t sure whether the sound was coming from the surrounding or reverberating inside his skull. Smoke drifted around him, obscuring his vision.
A medium-sized couch was to the adjacent left. A side table was on the immediate right of the couch he was on and a fireplace in front of the couch. On the mantle, there were a few photo-frames. He traced a finger over his jaw, and it was tingling slightly. With a soft groan, he walked to the kitchen.
“Clearly,” Draco muttered. “with your deficient vocabulary, I’m not certain if you can string words into sentences to write a proper article for the Prophet,” and after a moment, “but you could work on the trash section idea.”
He chuckled as the snitch fluttered and ascended in the air, only to pause mid-air in front of him. The familiar flutter of the snitch was kind of calming. Kind of close to Hogwarts. “I’m not certain you want to hear it.”
“No, I’m not coming in there.” He said, planting his feet firmly to the ground as his voice grew louder. “I don’t –
“Draco –” He flinched when a warm hand was placed on his shoulder and he couldn’t figure out if it was the touch or the first name that caused the reaction. “thinking about setting the precious Chosen One on fire?”
Harry cleared his throat, and turned his gaze towards the sky.
Harry Potter was standing near the edge of the shore, staring at the water. In the spur of the moment, he disapparated with a faint pop. It didn’t work. He was fairly away from the shore. An amused smirk was playing across Draco's lips as he watched the brunet. He never slept much, did he?
"I don't care. Now put your skates on, or I’ll do it for you. Besides, you draw more attention than this just walking down the street."
He poured the water into the kettle and placed it on the stove, igniting it with a wave of his fingers, fishing out the tea leaves and one lemon. “No sugar in your –” Draco was staring at the watch “night tea, right?”
“It’s my code of conduct,” Draco said with a slight quiver to his voice. He unlaced the entwined fingers with a curse and said, “why can’t I write it?”
When he moved away, Malfoy cast again. The wisps curled out of the wand, and it was a bit brighter than before, hovering in the air for much longer. It was a start.
“In case you’ve forgotten, we’re both stranded in Otryazan –”
Harry and Draco bake cookies together (yes, they sorted out the fight)
“Yes, the red one.” Malfoy said with a confused frown and he was certain if the blond had figured it out, it would’ve turned into a feud-fest. “No trouble with levitating a small seashell, is there?”
“Yes.”
“You’re Calypso,” Harry said, with a smirk as he cracked an egg into the mixing bowl. “You’re in an Island, with me – Harry Potter – The hero of the wizarding world.”
There was a long pause.
He stared at a distance and with a faint smile, he said, “well, I suppose you did, considering you still didn’t light me on fire. Yet.”
“I couldn’t take it,” He continued, with a pained mien on his face. “I had failed my task in the sixth year, and the dark lord wasn’t thrilled with that –
He cleared his throat as he waited for a brief second, and half-turned to return to the couch, when he heard a soft whisper of: “I’m on the roof, Potter.”
Draco simply smirked, and picked up a handful of snow. With a chuckle he tossed it towards him. Harry didn’t make an attempt to avoid the snowball. It hit him smack in the face, and he sputtered.
, Malfoy,” He raised his hands in surrender when Draco lifted a brow, not amused the poor imitation, “your words, not mine,”
In the evening, Malfoy opened the door to prepare tea. He lifted his gaze from the novel, and watched the blond with an arched eyebrow. “Will you prepare a cuppa for me?”
Malfoy frowned, as his gaze landed on the cup of tea placed on the peninsula. “You – Harry Potter – The Golden Boy – The chosen one – made tea for me?”
Why – In the name of Merlin – Did Lucius Malfoy find it amusing to send him here?
–” He could detect a hint of sarcasm in the tone. “if you want to sort out a fight with Harry Potter, you must remain subtle, instead of a –”
The usual raw energy pulsing around Potter was much calmer considering he was asleep. Draco stared at his face. He looked different while he was sleeping. He had a childish innocence on his face. It was probably because the eyes weren’t glaring at him. Weren’t sending cold stares.
Malfoy grimaced, and pain flickered across his face – And Harry wished he wouldn’t have said that last bit – The flash of hurt faded within a second and it was replaced by the familiar cold mask. “And you trust your instincts? Your Godfather died because you ‘trusted’ your instincts.”
“Are you out of your mind, Draco?”
Harry paused, only to whisper softly against his mouth, "I would."
Draco straightened the white sweater and his fingers curled into it, perhaps for the warmth, while he shifted in place, forcing a neutral guise on the face which could’ve fooled the brunet if not for the trace of impatience in Draco’s voice while he said, “If you want to continue staring while you search your deficient vocabulary for the perfect words in order to continue, you –”
A soft, slow music drifted in the air and the light of the enchanted ceiling cascaded a silver, beautiful glow on the room. It was a faint luminesce of the night sky. The sight of the stars - of the constellations - was, in fact, a wonder to behold.
All sensible thoughts were drowned out by his pitiful, rasping breaths, and his vision began to blur.
"I trust you, Draco," He said with a small, uncertain smile, "if only a little."
(See the end of the chapter for
“You could’ve said ‘
“Six years, Draco?” Harry tilted his head to the side with a small upturn of the corners of his mouth at the retort while he asked, “why were you a prat for six years, if you wanted us to be friends?”
A pause.
Harry watches as Draco blinks. The response evidently having caught him off guard as though he was expecting a bit more argument.
He could go to the Order base. Ron and Hermione would certainly be there, and he had no other location in mind. Besides, he wanted to see Remus.
"I can’t explain,” Lucius said, the panic evident in his voice and whipped his wand through the air. Harry leapt to the side and rolled, narrowly avoiding the spell.
He focused on the cuts across Potter’s jaw, and frowned. He hadn’t even realized that they were so severe. He never wanted to injure him. Not so much. Draco pressed the damp rag against the cut, and Potter winced as the green smoke billowed upwards. “Potter, who in their right mind let you into our common room?”
“Oh, no you can’t,” He said, and the corner of his lip twitched and curled into a smirk. “Previously on
It elicited a soft laugh out of the brunet and the flutter returned in Draco’s chest. “Can we continue with the Patronus, Potter?” Draco fished out the wand and fiddled with it. “Or do you want to rest?”
“Oh you had to remind me, didn’t you?” If he intended for it to sound sarcastic, it didn’t because his voice had a strained edge to it. The after-effects of performing a spell in Otryazan was taxing. “I – erm – we should head in.”
“One night, he asked Antonin Dolohov to kill my father.”
on fire.” Malfoy turned an interesting shade of crimson. It was rather amusing to watch, and he couldn’t resist another quip. “I was flattered, you know?”
I really don't.
, I’m sorry to interrupt you, continue with your rant.”
Perhaps, Potter couldn’t figure out a way to argue with that because instead of a snide remark, the corner of his lip twitched and curled into a wide grin. “well, I can’t oppose to that.”
“Right,” He said with a confused frown, pointing the wand in front of him and adjusting the stance with a soft groan and a curse. “must you point out my stance every single time?”
The brief touch of fingertips – the one fraction of a moment – had caused a tiny flutter in his chest, and a warmth had coursed through him, as if it was the touch of a warm, soft star.
The pocket-watch was resting on the novel, pulsating with an odd sort of induced magic. A shiver trickled down his spine and he exhaled unevenly. It was emitting a rather familiar feeling – as if he had been in the presence of the artifact at the manor. Yet, he couldn’t recall a pocket-watch.
Harry arched an eyebrow at him.
And as he started preparing supper, determined to continue the plan – Draco Malfoy walked out of the bedroom with an all-too familiar smirk on his face.
“I can’t forget when you were a
He had found it in the Manor. It was the reason he wasn’t with Ron and Hermione and was in Otryazan with Draco Malfoy. He had screwed up. He had to fix it. “Fuck you, Tom, you obtuse fucking prat.”
In retrospect, it wasn’t a clever idea to confess that he trusted Draco Malfoy. It was rather daft. In his defense, he was proficient at unwise ideas which would cause trouble in the future. Yet for once, it was sort of worth it.
He received a note in potions. An anonymous note with a familiar elegant cursive. The parchment was sort of crumpled, and it said:
“Yes, continue to flounder,” Draco said in a sardonic, apathetic tone, yet the brunet could detect a trace of uncertainty in it. “It’s very
For once, a simple levitation charm wasn’t wearing him out and he was a tad bit pleased with it. Malfoy was a decent tutor. “I could practice a few more simple charms.”
“I can’t – well, I was convinced you were a moronic fuck and – not that it’s an excuse, but Ron was well – the first friend I had in eleven years and I couldn’t tolerate your biased opinions about the Weasleys.”
The sky was blue-ish, and silvery clouds glided almost imperceptibly against it. The sun was casting a warm sort of glow, and its silver light cascaded on the water, the waves crashing softly against the shore and the seagulls standing over the water like a silent vigil.
Draco stared off into the distance, as the sun cascaded its light, and a quivering path of silver shone on the water. The waves crashed softly against the shore.  “I want a little bit of a fairy-tale life. Or a small quest.”
He felt a stab of pain in the chest and for a brief moment, he felt sort of insulted, felt the familiar itch to retort with an insensitive comment, to refute the untrue accusation. Or, perhaps, comfort Draco, for once.
“Your rib was –” Draco said with a sarcastic tone, squinting in place with a low grunt. “– fractured, wasn’t it?”
The moment he had lost the one actual family he had left.
. It wouldn’t change anything. Only torment him with phantoms from the past and the future.
“Or a genie, which can fulfil our wishes.” He was certainly amused with the confusion with a hint of curiosity flicker across Malfoy’s face and he couldn’t resist a smile. “Aladdin had a flying carpet with a genie.”
Draco felt another stab of pain in the chest. He reached out, and caught his elbow without thinking and the brunet paused. He wanted to hold onto the self-preservation. Yet, he didn’t. A silence engulfed them, and he was unable to string a coherent sentence.
"You were sort of covered in blood when we were at Hogwarts."
“Oh, can you not be melodramatic, Malfoy?”
He tilted his head at the sky, and could vaguely trace a constellation with his fingertip, lining it with the three stars and at a bluish star – Regulus.
“Altruism isn’t a trait known to Slytherins,” He chuckled, and slipped into the warm coat. “Thank you.”
“Not the idea I had in mind,” He said with a small grin, yet it only lasted for a brief minute until the brunet winced and the grin turned into a grimace as he forced out, “but it’ll work.”
whenever you want to,” He was, however, certain that if Draco Malfoy wanted to cast an Obliviate, he would, without a doubt. “I will
“It’s not nothing,” Draco said with a scoff, resisting the urge to reach out and when his fingers twitched at the side. “You performed a complex spell without a wand and it’s taxing you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And Dobby had arrived at the manor to break them out. He hadn’t escaped, but Ron and Hermione had, with the rest of the prisoners. If he could use the broken piece of the mirror, would he find a way out? Perhaps the man in the mirror would send Dobby. The magic of a house-elf would probably work in and out of Otryazan.
– Oh wait, you did that last night.”
He turned, glancing over at a dishevelled Malfoy. Instead of the narrowed eyes, or disgruntled look he had come to expect from the blond, there was a softening of facial features and an almost smile directed at the him.
He was certain that the brunet wouldn’t figure it out considering the prat was oblivious. Besides, he was focused on teaching Draco to cast a corporeal Patronus, yet he had a small smile grazing the corner of his mouth. A small, eloquent smile.
thank you for reading it so far<3 I'll be back on Tuesday with another update!
Draco narrowed his eyes, his demeanor immediately stiffening with both curiosity and suspicion. He wasn’t even supposed to know.
“Pray tell, why are you certain it’s a gift?”
And failed.
His voice trailed, as he saw a flicker of hurt cross Malfoy’s face. Only for a second. “You should go have the quick shower, Potter.”
He was slightly irritated when he didn’t find a note with the sandwiches. Not that he was planning to knock on the bedroom door and ask him to fucking get over it but he was considering it as an option.
"Would I, what?" Harry said with a small, confused frown while he slowed the pace.
“I’m an –” Harry doubled over, a hand to his stomach, a boisterous, carefree laugh flying out of him on the sardonic comment. It caused a stutter in Draco’s chest. “we’ve already established that, haven’t we?”
“Y-yeah, sure.” The light was reflecting on Potter’s tan skin and gave it a bronze glow and it was kind of – beautiful.
He heard a soft turn of the doorknob, and the bedroom door creaked open. He opened his eyes, staring at the cup with a smirk playing on his lips. Right on cue.
In hindsight, he would’ve not asked had he known it was a private, family-related memory. It was a sore subject. Plus, when he paused to think about it, it was sort of intrusive. “Mhm, yeah.”
"In that moment, I felt what I hadn't felt for over six months," Draco croaked, “A small shed of hope.” He was focused on a point on the mantel, resolutely avoiding eye contact. His silver eyes were suspiciously shiny and glistening, “a small, small shed of hope.”
“Not your concern.”
He frowned as he felt an intrusion in his head. An unwelcome presence, and he didn’t want to be vulnerable. He inhaled sharply, as he pushed it out of his head.
“Oh, what, in Godric’s name, are you on about,
“It’s a fairy-tale, Malfoy,” Harry chuckled, walking towards the oven with the tray and placed it inside. It would barely take ten to fifteen minutes for the cookies to bake.
He sighed, incapable of fighting the faint smile on his lips. The quips were absurd, yet sort of comical.
’ were sort of – unkind, to put it decently. “You are, for once, not wrong.”
As the argument continues, Draco starts to grow weaker and weaker
Potter arched an eyebrow at him as he circled his fingers around the cup. “A burnt tongue won’t stop the sarcastic and clever retorts, if it’s what you’re aiming for.”
“Oh, I can vaguely recall the Patronus charm you sent our way when you were in the air in the Quidditch match and I had the guise of the dementor – Quite notable – and you knocked us off our broom, Potter.”
was around – Plus, he was accustomed to Potter’s presence – accustomed to the nonsensical arguments or the sarcastic retorts and quips. Yet, a small, small part of him was afraid.
“I’ve been reminded of that since you landed in Otryazan, Potter.”
"Yeah, I've – begun to see that a little more these days," came Harry's answer a few beats later.
He shivered slightly, as he rubbed his palm to produce a bit of heat. Malfoy chuckled and he slid a spare cloak towards him. “I was fairly certain you would come to find me.”
Draco didn't know.
If he was the night sky, and the stars were the ones around him, he didn’t want to hold the weight of those stars. He didn’t have everlasting stars in the sky – It wasn’t the silver, small speckles he feared.
He didn’t want to wait until dinner for the next one.
“Are you going to leave it all behind?” Draco asked, his voice wobbly, unsure. “All of it?”
“You’re staring,” Harry said, his lips curving into a soft smile. “And there is a certain way you stare at me, you know? As if you’re staring at a galaxy, and –
’ in front of the others with the clichés. I want the others to know you’re mine and I’m yours.” A beat. “I want to walk you to class or read the oh-so cliché poems with you in our common room, near the fireplace without care.”
The pause returned for a brief moment. Harry half-expected Malfoy to retort with an insolent, or sarcastic quip. Yet, he didn’t. The blond pointed vaguely upward at the inky black sky. “It’s the one close to – wait.”
It was a waste of time to tame the unruly hair. Instead, he rubbed his hair viciously with the towel to untangle it. He flinched as he heard the soft creak of the door.
He quivered in place, forcing out the familiar urge to refute with malice. He was, however, intent to maintain the well-practiced cold mien. Or he could simply just ignore the dear saviour. “Malfoy, can we –”
It was precisely the sardonic retort Malfoy was waiting for. And he didn’t write one. Instead, he crumbled the parchment and tossed it aside. It was oddly satisfying to have a small win over Draco Malfoy.
“I’m not.” He chuckled, while opening the door, just wide enough for his skinny body to slip through to avoid the loud creaking sound it would create. The air was cold enough for the breath to appear in icy puffs. Malfoy closed the door with a soft ‘thud’ and turned to the sea. “for the record, I’ll never be finished with the remarks.”
He clenched his fists to his side, his knuckles turning white, but he couldn’t get it under control. He inched closer to Malfoy, and they were nose to nose.
Harry had an incessant throbbing sensation in the chest. It was insensitive. He wishes he could retract it. Yet, he couldn’t form a coherent sentence. He cursed. “I couldn’t –”
Draco arched an eyebrow at him with a faint chuckle. The brunet scowled, turning his head to the sea, staring at it with an unfocused gaze. “Can you?”
couldn’t find out that he cared. If only a little.
"If I said I want you to dance with me forever or if I want you to kiss me under the light of the thousand ceiling stars," Draco whispered, in a soft, vulnerable voice, "would you?"
A teacup shattered, and the sound reverberated in the house. He barely resisted the urge to slightly open the door and watch Potter as he tortured a poor teacup. And curse in French, in the process.
He carded his fingers through his unruly hair, and tilted his head at the sky. He shifted, and clenched his fists to the side. With a sigh, Draco opened the front door, draping a warm cloak over himself as he walked out. The cold wind tousled his hair as it brushed against him.
He opened his eyes, yet he didn’t turn to the blond and stared at the sea instead. If he did, Malfoy wouldn’t elaborate. Malfoy paused for a minute or two, almost as if he was calculating the next words.
“It wasn’t fair?” He muttered with a snort, and caught the snitch as it started to move slightly. The wings closed and it rested against his palm. “I didn’t have to buy my way in –
Harry could almost hear a silent: “If I were dead, the notes would’ve been in the same place, Potter.”
“Mine are just as good as yours, Malfoy.” Harry said, with a scowl. “And I’m only asking for one, you don’t have to be so dramatic.”
“I’m not going to walk on ice, and wear those hideous skates.”
” He whispered with a soft brush of fingertips. A brief touch. It caused a familiar flutter in his chest. A flutter that wouldn’t cease. “I want –” He paused. “wanted to be your
Panic engulfed his mind; his heart hammered in his chest so hard it could have shaken the whole place. All rational thoughts were drowned out by his pitiful, rasping breaths and his vision began to blur. The anxiety battled ferociously, waxing and waning in intensity, threatening to overpower him one moment, and reducing the next as his knees dropped to the ground. He never remembered being so cold.
Draco walked into the bedroom, and closed the door softly.
With a sigh, he added another small request in the note:
"Draco, do you want to head in to our dorms?" He curls a finger into the strand of hair and tucks it neatly behind Draco's ear. "you're -"
“You – I – You weren’t there.”
“I’ll leave dead flowers on your grave.”
“Not all of us were trained in ballroom waltzes since we were four.”
Not a fucking watch, for starters. Yet, Malfoy couldn’t find out what it was, considering the truth of the artifact was a classified information. “Malfoy, put it on the counter –” He earned a ‘no’ in response. “Christ, Malfoy.”
He was vulnerable, yet intimidating. And Draco found it to be both intriguing and irritating. He was almost beautiful. Almost. Draco decided he wouldn’t think about it again. Or even let the thought enter his mind.
The silence returned.
“You’re an arse.”
Draco didn’t visualize it. He wanted his mind to colour the canvas. And with that, a splash of paint covered the white canvas. He focused on the movement of his hand – slow and precise.
It didn’t work.
It caused the brunet to laugh. A soft, amused laugh. With a faint chuckle, he moved closer behind Draco and placed a hand on the back while adjusting the position of the arm. “Relax, Draco.”
He could get used to the banter. Or the forced civil conversations. He could get used to preparing breakfast with Draco Malfoy. It was absurd, but he didn’t have a choice. He was starving, and he didn’t want to stress over the fact that he was in the fucking kitchen with Malfoy – Draco Malfoy – making crepes for breakfast. “Get a mixing bowl, a pan and a whisk, will you?”
He was familiar with Malfoy’s sardonic tone and the antagonistic words. He was familiar with the retorts. Or the venom laced in the retorts. He was
A small click cut the silence: Draco had taken a ring off his finger and placed it on the mantle, fingers curling into a fist at the side, the flickering lights of the fire dancing on the pale skin. “Draco I –”
He stared at the sky ahead, as the thoughts raced through his mind. He didn’t know if he should trust Malfoy. He couldn’t. He wanted to get out of here. Why would Lucius send him here? He couldn’t save Malfoy – He couldn’t even save himself.
“You could’ve,” He said with an uncertain voice, tracing the crest of the badger with the index finger, while he forced a guise of indifference, “you chose not to refuse,” Harry’s eyes flickered to Draco’s face. “Why?”
The world dissolved around them, as he was drowned in the heated gaze. His fingers brushed the hem of his shirt: worn cotton, old and blue. Harry enclosed his lips on Draco’s; soft yet immersive, gentle yet powerful all the same. He paused, only to whisper softly against his mouth: “I’ll stay.”
“Potter?”
to argue. “I can’t – cry about it.”
In retrospect, it probably wasn’t a wise idea to continue without censoring the conversation. In fact, it was a nonsensical idea, which was Harry's area of expertise. “Yes, my first friend in eleven years.”
He raced to the further end of the dining room, firing blindly at the death eaters shooting red jets at him. He had to find a way out of the Malfoy Manor.
“Well, Twix was fantastic and I couldn’t resist the M&M’s – And full disclosure, I finished all of the M&M’s.”
. To Draco Malfoy, he was only Harry Potter. “It wasn’t – isn’t – because I’m the chosen one, is it?”
“A quest?”
And he had seen the light fade. Because if stars were the ones around him, he had watched the slightly bright stars fade out of existence. And he didn’t want to have a bright star if it would eventually fade and darken the sky.
He snorted, and pitched forward. Unfortunately, he fell onto the ice.
. A beat. “I – No. No, we’re not.”
The knife wouldn’t work. He could work with a teacup, and possibly shatter it. He wanted to get a reaction out of Malfoy. Only once.
He laughed, brushing his lips softly against Harry’s. His were warm, even with how cold the air was.
“I’m half-way through it.” He said, dismissing the relentless thoughts in his mind. He didn’t want to think about it. He couldn’t. If he started to count the faded stars, the sky would be a little darker. “No spoilers.”
Outside the window, a storm steadily crept closer. The beams of light break through the sky again, followed by a crash. Harry was startled, yet unfazed by the thunder. He wasn't afraid of storms.
It wasn’t wise to go out and argue with Potter. As satisfying as it would be, he didn’t want to give in. If Potter wanted to get a rise out of him, he would only fail. Draco Malfoy didn’t want to give Harry Potter a win.
Draco turned, walking towards a quaint glass house, half a mile away from the water. The windows glinted at him. There was something more inviting about it than usual.
“Oh, shut up, you prat,” Draco warned, “I’m not finished yet.”
The blond paused all movement; his face bore an inscrutable expression. He moved forward, the anger seeping in his voice. “I regret it. Every fucking day. I couldn’t stand the thought, that I was capable of murdering a man. And I know It’s not worth forgiving.”
“No, you were clear when you said you won’t clue me in on the artefact and your words of choice in our small row were convincing,” Draco was, however, indeed still curious about the artefact. He wasn't going to succumb to his curiosity driven urge to prod though, not after what went down the last time he did. “Insensitive, yet convincing.”
“I wasn’t – You find it amusing to rile me up, don’t you?”
“Would you rather prefer ‘temporary acquaintance’, Malfoy? I still can’t stand you, and you can’t stand me either. I will find a way out of Otryazan because I don’t want to be around you and –
Malfoy had the faintest trace of a smile on his lips, only for a brief moment. He cast a warming charm on the cup of tea, and left it on the kitchen counter, striding into the bedroom. But he didn’t close the door.
“You can’t leave.” He said patiently, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt. “If you do, you’re going to get splinched. No offense, but you aren’t in a spectacular shape at the moment.”
“Oh, shut up, why would I –” Draco paused, repeating the statement in the mind, fairly certain that a flicker of concern had crossed his features with a mix of annoyance. “No, it’s not.”
“When you die, I’ll place the can of whipped cream in your grave with you.”
“No chance – Although, I do want you to ask nicely – The conversations are easier with verbal jabs and quips.”
Malfoy stared at him. A second longer than required. And Harry was only wearing the sweater and boxer briefs. Another awkward silence ensued and he couldn’t resist a quip: “Hey Flynn, are you escaping the royal guards? Because you’re in Rapunzel’s tower.”
He placed the finished plate on the kitchen counter, casting a quick cleaning charm on it. On the back of the parchment, he quipped:
“Yeah.” There was a ghost of a smile at the edges of his mouth. “I’ll come if you promise not to–
“Of course,” He whispered, with a reluctant smile of his own and ignoring the small flutter. “I wouldn’t forget the matches, considering I won against you, would I?”
“Yes, friends.”
He chuckled, as his gaze flickered to the brunet. His glasses were askew, and the red blanket was on the edge of the couch. He couldn’t hold himself in the way Potter did. Even if he was trapped in a severed Island, he was calm and collected. Or maybe he had been through a lot worse.
“I should remind you about it a lot often.”
Draco stumbled into the sand first, on his back, with the brunet landing on top of him. “Oh, Salazar,” Draco said, muffled and echoing in the ears. “
