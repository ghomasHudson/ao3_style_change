However, now that Harry was staring at the empty piece of parchment in front of him, he thought it might not have been such a good idea. He didn’t have a way with words, not at all. At least when speaking to someone you could always pretend you didn’t hear them, claim they heard you wrong, or that you were merely joking about that thing that they got offended over. With writing, it was all there, evidence most damning, clearly intended to be read. Minutes went by as Harry tried to compose a coherent note in his head that wouldn't sound too urgent, but that would convey the prevailing time pressure, and a note that wouldn't be too clingy, but not too distant either. Something that would warrant a response.
Draco Malfoy who had sided with Voldemort. Alas, a small voice in Harry’s head added that he was also
When the elevator doors opened with a ding, Harry started for the large doors at the end of the corridor, Evergrey walking close behind him. Before Harry could perform a forceful knock on the doors, they opened in a welcoming manner and he marched right in. “I hate when you do that,” he announced and stopped in front of Kingsley’s desk without a greeting.
Kingsley leisurely lifted the paper and conjured his reading glasses from the side table to read the task description. Harry tapped his foot impatiently and scanned the office: it was larger than his, but it also featured a personal fireplace connected to the Floo Network, some maroon armchairs, a chessboard, a bookcase, and no portraits of the Minister’s predecessors. Harry reckoned he also wouldn’t want a portrait Cornelius Fudge or Rufus Scrimgeour looking over him every day, or worst case, Pius Thicknesse, though he figured that any portrait made of the former Death Eater was surely already destroyed. A cold shiver still ran down his spine.
Finally, Hermione took a gulp of her water and said. “I have to admit, that’s a lot of information to take in,” she tapped her mouth with the cloth napkin gently, and laid it back on her lap. She had returned to looking reflective as she continued to shove fries in her mouth.
Now he got flustered by the question and ran his fingers through his hair to… what? Make it seem less bushy? A hopeless undertaking. He picked up a pillow from the bed to hold so that his hands wouldn't be continuously fidgeting, giving away his agitation. “Well, I was. It’s just… it’s not customary for the Head Auror to visit people’s houses personally, delivering messages,” now he was fidgeting with the pillow instead, rolling its corner in and out.
Harry got up from the ground, to stand next to Malfoy, who infuriatingly did not seem to be affected by the horrid journey at all, even landing feet first. He was still squeezing his bag, and Harry picked his off of the wet ground. The door swung open almost immediately, and a weathered-looking Narcissa strode across the yard to wrap Draco in a tight hug. She looked like she hadn’t slept at all: dark circles under her eyes, face puffy, hair messy. She had been crying, Harry realized awkwardly. He didn’t think he’d ever seen the woman in this state, not even in her own trial. Now Draco put his arms gracelessly to touch her back, in what seemed like a reluctant embrace. Harry realized that he didn’t want to be here, he didn’t want to confront his wreck of a mother and deal with the execution of his monstrous father. Again, Harry couldn’t blame him one bit.
“On Ministry business, yes,” Harry said assertively, but was careful to stick to the topic, “was she upset?” he didn’t exactly know why he was asking that, true he had made sure to be considerate as to not give her any additional reason to be concerned, but still, he hardly cared for her son’s opinion on his table manners.
Late in the afternoon, when they had already packed up their stuff and were walking towards the promenade to find a private place to Disapparate, they passed a group of people playing beach volley. Harry was looking at them, intrigued. Of course he was familiar with volleyball, having grown up in the muggle world, but couldn't recall playing it since primary school. It looked fun what they were doing, running around in the cooled down sand. When they saw Harry looking, they motioned him and Draco to join them,
After a short while the young bartender in a white blouse and a black apron slid the glass over the counter, it had a thick frothy foam on the top, and it was ridiculously overpriced. Harry picked it up and spotted an empty booth in the corner of the room that was still deserted. He started to make his way over.
“I guess you’re right…” Ginny’s face turned reflective, “speaking of Krum, you haven’t, er, seen his latest achievement, have you?”
“Yes, is that a problem?” Harry asked. He really hoped it wouldn’t be a problem, otherwise it would be a problem for him too, because each passing second, he was falling more in love with Malfoy, and didn't think it likely to want to start a family with anyone else. He had to remind himself that it had only been a couple of days, and that he was getting ahead of himself.
A smile spread instantly to Harry’s face when he hugged Ron back, every time he saw his old friends he felt an inexplicable wave of happiness and comfort. He knew he could count on Ron no matter what, and he could trust him with just about anything; it just made him feel so much more comfortable. “I’m good, I’m good, how are you? How’s Hermione?”
Now Harry understood that Narcissa was referring to the Ministry when she said ‘they’. “I’m sorry,” he mumbled awkwardly, despite not being in any way responsible for what the Ministry had done to the Malfoy family at the time. The trials had been ruthless, and the Ministry had been cold-blooded in the execution of the court’s orders, to say the least. Although, Harry had to admit that the Malfoys had probably taken the most hit from the aftermath of Voldemort’s death. They had lost their house, almost all of their possessions, along with huge fines imposed upon them. Draco had lost both of his parents, his mother for nine years, his father forever.
Malfoy went a bit red and scratched the back of his head, not looking at Harry anymore. “For Merlin’s sakes, er,” he was now looking out the window at the summery view, “remember when we had that Care of Magical Creatures class where Hagrid showed us the blasted Hippogriff, and he made you fly it?” Harry wasn’t sure where this was going, but whatever it was, it was making Malfoy almost squirm where he was sitting.
“Well that went well, don’t you think?” Harry almost jumped out of his skin when he heard Theseus’s comment.
Now Penelope took a deep breath and clearly gave up whatever fight she had been trying to put up. “I can’t say that it would,” she said quietly, and Harry nodded half as a confirmation and half as a thank you.
“Tell her I said thanks,” Harry tried smiling at him carefully, but Malfoy wasn’t looking at him. Now Harry was holding the plant and understood the awkwardness the man had been demonstrating; the pot was surprisingly heavy, and an uncomfortable shape to hold.
Narcissa’s eyes widened a little, and she was rapidly taking turns between eyeing the two men in front of her. “Very well,” she replied, and glanced at Harry apprehensively, like she was trying to assess if anything had happened between them that preceding week, “thank you for seeing that my son got home safely.” Her tone was suddenly very formal, and Harry held his tongue about how he did not contribute that much to the already safe mode of traveling that was the portkey (it was literally just going from A to B). Harry settled to nodding at her.
“Yes, they do,” Draco said quietly, more to himself than anyone, “but I think it’s time for me to be Draco Malfoy – Head of Slytherin House instead of just Draco Malfoy – former Death Eater, don’t you think? Besides, I don’t think I care for the solitary life anymore, I think I’ve met someone worth abandoning that for,” he turned his head to look at Harry, underlining his implication that was already hanging in the air quite clearly.
It was quiet for a moment. “I’m sorry,” Malfoy whispered and squeezed Harry’s hand he was still holding. It was all he needed to say, and all Harry needed to hear. Sorry that he had to see it, sorry he had to dream about it, sorry for the whole sodding mess.
“He cleans up well, who would’ve known?” Harry spun around when hearing Malfoy’s voice from behind him. He had appeared in the doorway of the bathroom, Harry hadn’t even heard him coming down the stairs. Harry wasn’t sure what the man meant by ‘cleaning up’, since Harry didn’t think he looked very different from usual. The same couldn’t be said for Malfoy: he had shaved, already looking much more like his former self, his hair was styled back, and he was wearing a neat dark blue button-down, tucked in his black slacks, which also made him resemble, well, himself, much more. Harry didn’t feel like he was with a stranger anymore. And the man looked good, really fucking good.
I urge you to trust yourself and yourself only, when it comes to ensuring the health of any sexual acts. This has been a PSA. Happy wizarding!
“Er,” Harry wasn’t sure if what he’d done had actually made anything better – he tried to think of what they could tell the Ministry board the next day that could safe Lucius’ life, “I went to see Kingsley, he was at the office already.” Draco’s eyes widened as he shot to look at Harry, his expression a mix of horror and realization. “He set up a meeting with the Ministry board for tomorrow, they’re going to hear my case to save Lucius, but it’s going to have to be a good one,” he bit his lip, and looked at Draco expectantly.
Malfoy shrugged, not even looking at Harry, the coward. “Pretty much, yeah,” he said and turned around to face Harry. What an unbelievable tosspot he was. An arrogant fucker, who Harry still wanted to snog, who he still wanted to pin him down, and if he were to do that right now, Harry would let him, even after what he had done, even after everything.
Well, as it turned out, it wasn’t exactly off his hands yet. An amused expression spread across Kingsley’s face as he sat more straight in his chair, and looked at Harry like he had only made his life harder by voting for the motion. “Don’t thank me,” he asserted, “after all, it’s you who now has to convince mister Malfoy to appear in front of a judge.”
“Tell him how you feel,” Hermione said simply, raising her eyebrows in an expression that made it seem oh-so-easy. She lifted her fork and dug it into the large piece of cake she had ordered for the two. Harry noticed that he’d have to stick up for himself if he wanted to get even a piece or two for himself, so he grabbed the small fork and aimed for the part with the most frosting.
“Oh, no one… just some guy from the gym,” Harry tried to shrug nonchalantly. He definitely had never been caught looking at his bum, and worse, ever since, the bloke had had the audacity to greet him. Harry didn’t know what to do about it.
Now Malfoy shrugged, not seeming surprised about the question, but not very intrigued about it either. “It was normal, a bit late in my father’s opinion, came with the mail one day, mother was pleased, she wanted me to go to Hogwarts anyway.” Harry thought back to his first encounter with Malfoy, in Madam Malkin’s, when he had been shopping with Hagrid, and Malfoy had had his robes fitted. What an insufferable git he had been. “I suppose your horrid aunt and uncle were glad to be rid of you?” Malfoy asked in return, and Harry couldn’t hold back a snort.
Harry took a seat in the other chair on the balcony. “Good, er, how long was I asleep?” it felt as though he had been unconscious for hours on end, he hadn’t woken up once, not even to change position on the sofa. His body felt heavy, even though the fruit in his stomach was now waking up his system again. He felt awkward thanking Malfoy for presenting him with all this food, and just hoped that he knew he was grateful for the gesture.
and threw himself at Harry. There was simply no way, the entire situation had an odd aura to it, like it wasn’t real. Though it may have been the time of night that made it so ambiguously intimate.
, the man looked distinctly like someone who had just eaten a spoonful of baking powder, “me, I’d rather get my teeth pulled out, but since that’s not an option either I decided to do the equally unpleasant thing and come crash at your flat for the time being.” What a lovely thought, Harry especially liked the part where Malfoy compared his company to getting one’s teeth pulled out, how charming. He appreciated the heads up as well, though on second thought, the Ministry probably didn't give them one either.
Now Hermione turned to Harry, and crossed her hands on the thick tablecloth. “How are you Harry?” she asked in a very sympathetic voice, a little
Apparating straight into Harry’s bedroom did not hinder the conversation now picking up, even if Harry’s stomach was feeling a bit queasy from the Side-Along. “I tried to talk you into taking that position for Merlin knows how many times, now a few words from Hermione and you’re suddenly jumping at the opportunity? I’m positively wounded,” Harry scolded Draco, scowling, not sure if he was being entirely serious or not.
“What?” the man asked in an almost curious tone, he finally sat up straight, monitoring Harry’s actions closely.
Harry sighed and let Malfoy pass, one of these days he was going to stand up to him, really. But for now, he had a thought in his mind; if Malfoy was going to hang around for a few hours, Harry might as well use the time fish out some answers of what the hell was happening. “So why didn’t you go visit your dad? I thought you’d like to see him, what with how much you looked up to him back in school.” Harry couldn’t not think about the countless times he’d heard
Harry didn’t know how to respond to such an unexpected revelation, so he just decided to go with the truth. “Well, that makes one of us,” he raised his eyebrows quickly and lifted his chin to meet Malfoy’s calculating eyes.
Harry was taken aback, he didn’t realize he had been imposing on something private, if that indeed was the case. “Sorry, er,” he stammered, “I just feel like I know so little about you nowadays,” he confessed, not knowing where the sudden bout of honesty had come from. Perhaps he felt that he had nothing to lose with the man anymore, so he might as well just tell the truth. In school he had known Malfoy, at least enough to hate the git, but now, this new Draco was still mostly a big mystery to Harry, and he wanted to know more.
Harry obeyed, though reluctantly, and pulled off the upper part of his hospital robes. They were open in the back so he just tugged his arms out of the sleeves with a rustle, and waited for Malfoy to approach. “Big inhale,” Malfoy muttered and gently pressed the cold round end onto Harry’s bare chest. It felt way too intimate for comfort. Malfoy was standing very close, and smelled of green apple and peppermint, his hand warm and firm on Harry’s shoulder. Why that sent a pleasant shudder through Harry, he didn’t want to think about. He was grateful for the inhale, it steadied him. Malfoy moved the stethoscope on the other side of his chest, and then on his back, listening quietly.
Now Malfoy shook his head in disbelief. “How the hell did Dumbledore leave you with these absolute monsters?” his tone was baffled, and he was staring into the middle distance, like he was trying to place Harry into all of these scenarios in his head that he’d learnt.
The pub had a slate floor, and the wood used in the tables and the chairs was lightly coloured. The upholstery was jade green and in the tables there were singular flowers in tiny glass bottles. The place was semi crowded, but not loud, and a gentle chatter filled the space. Harry headed on to the bar and ordered a pint.
have to share with Malfoy, and he really should not, “so, er… you haven’t been in England for a while then?” Harry tried to change the subject, perfectly normal for someone who is not at all uneasy in the conversation, right?
“It’s a permission slip, quite literally, to make an arrest,” Evergrey went a funny colour, but seemed a bit annoyed at the situation himself, “you know re-elections are coming up, the Minister isn’t taking any risks for something to go sideways, all larger missions must be approved by him personally.” Harry had to pinch his nose for a second before taking a deep breath and composing himself.
. The sun was already high, but he had once again had trouble falling asleep, and couldn't be bothered to get up early on a weekend. Now the light was flooding his kitchen, making sharp shadows appear behind his glass of orange juice and the coffee cup; outside it was turning into a warm April day, and the kitchen had warmed up quite a lot from just the sun shining in. A smell of coffee was still lingering in the air as Harry got up to change. He glanced at his garden, slowly illuminated by the sun climbing higher and higher in the sky, the white garden furniture were almost blinding, reflecting all of the light hitting their surface.
Talking to Ginny made Harry admit to himself that he was lonely. He was happy when he was with his friends, but every time he returned home he was faced with the bleak feeling that the only thing waiting for him was an empty house with a cold bed. Harry envied people who weren’t bothered being by themselves, and while he couldn’t claim that he was the most social person, he craved to be with someone. The problem that he had, the problem that he’d had for the last four years, was that there was simply no one out there who could understand what he’d been through. Who had seen some of the same horrors.
“By the way, my mum hasn’t invited you to her Easter dinner thingy, has she?” Ron asked cringing a little, he took a big gulp from his pint.
“You want romance?” Malfoy sprawled himself on the chair, but looked at Harry with challenge in his eyes. “Oh, a thousand apologies,
“Uhh… so, your mum told me that you used to be… well, obsessed with me,” Harry blurted out and regretted it immediately, he should just have kept his mouth shut to begin with, although he had to add, “I swear I didn’t pry, she just kind of said it.” Now Malfoy was turning a deep shade of red, and immediately looked away from Harry, he smoothed his hair and put his hands in his pockets, then took them out, then rocked side to side switching which leg to stand on. Harry didn’t know what to say, but he was pretty sure that nothing he would say would make the situation better, it would most definitely make it worse.
“Maybe next time I’ll stay for tea,” Draco hummed and took a step towards Harry, making him lightheaded of the implications. Harry felt himself swaying were he stood, he felt extremely aware of how small the gap was between him and something very tempting. “You know…” Draco continued, his nose almost nuzzling Harry’s now. “If you’ll still have me–“
Harry sighed. “There is something you have to agree to in return,” he revealed, and even though personally didn’t think the bargain too bad (Lucius would get to live, but also get out of Azkaban, mind you), he was sure he would only see downsides, the ungrateful bastard.
sun cream?” He couldn’t believe his eyes. Draco Malfoy, the number one cynic of muggles, laying his hands on a peasant product?
proof of something: it was proof that whatever had happened, it hadn’t just been in Harry’s head. It was proof that Malfoy’s own
,” Harry scoffed and shook his head slightly, rolling his eyes. Even it had been, Harry had been much worse off loads of times, and this little incident was not even close to breaking the top ten of every time he almost died. Malfoy turned to look at him drearily, and Harry faced his stare. A few silvery hairs escaped from behind the man’s ear to frame his pale face. Malfoy’s grey eyes were measuring Harry, but his face was unintelligible. Somehow it made Harry’s scalp tingle, but he didn’t look away.
“You wouldn’t get it, Potter,” Malfoy mumbled and looked away, his hand still curled around the warm cup. Harry took note of the Malfoy family ring and another, more subtle, silver ring on the man’s long finger.
Malfoy nodded slightly and faced Harry’s stare. “What about you then? Except abusing the magical legal system with your presence,” he sneered, but more amiably this time, “how many kids do you and that Weasley girl already have?”
Once at his house, Harry left his bag in his bedroom, and impatiently Apparated downstairs into the living room. Everything looked exactly the same as he had left it, and for some reason, it made him feel more grim than he thought it would. His Dittany looked a tad droopy, and Harry quickly watered it, before taking the determined steps towards his fireplace. He hadn’t bothered to change out of his muggle clothes, he had grown quite fond of them the previous week, and frankly, he thought that his point would get across stronger if he looked like his vacation had been interrupted so greatly that he had been compelled to march straight into the Minister’s office (which was exactly what was happening).
– “but they give the truly hopeless cases to us rookies.” So, Malfoy was still a fairly fresh Healer out of training then? Harry had no idea how long the Academy lasted, only that it was extremely selective of its candidates ­– clearly, someone had bungled there. “Tell me again exactly
Malfoy was nodding slowly, as in deep in thought, “Indeed it would,” then moved his gaze to Harry, “suppose you wouldn’t approve, you always hated Slytherin… and me.”
“So, Harry, I heard you work at the Ministry, what do you do there?” Isabel picked up the conversation quickly and Harry realized how much he hated small talk with people he had never met before and had nothing in common with. He liked Isabel, but disliked himself for being such a knob when it came to holding a conversation with her.
thick, Harry would never have the suaveness to charm Draco. “Anyway,” he continued, and Harry was once again aware that he was calling Malfoy Draco in his head, “I’m not that kind of a man, and more importantly, you’re not either.”
Once they got their act together, they Apparated on an alleyway near the restaurant, which was located on the promenade. The building was old, but had been renovated to be modern, with doors made fully of glass, and the interior completely renewed to contain a large bar area, and seating near the windows on two floors. The head waiter showed them to their table on the upper floor, overlooking the cove with the setting sun painting shades of pink and orange on the sky and in the water. After trying to make out something to choose from the list, they ended up ordering a five-course menu with traditional Italian dishes, and then were left to swirl the very fancy wine in their glasses, neither of them coming up with anything to say.
Azkaban was somehow worse than Harry had imagined it. The air was cold and humid, making its way under Harry’s clothes and into his bones, making him shiver despite the layers. This part of the North Sea was not experiencing a heat wave like the rest of Europe, Harry doubted they ever did, he doubted anything good ever happened in this place. The bleak rain clouds made it almost dark even in the middle of the day, and the wind anywhere else would’ve whipped up dirt and trash, but everything in this place was made out of stone, and the only thing the wind was pulling now was Harry, as he took the few short steps inside.
Harry took a deep breath to steady himself, grabbed Malfoy’s hand in his own and looked at him as gently as he could. “I think I’m a bit hopelessly in love with you right now,” he replied, feeling his cheeks flush hot. The look he got back from Draco sent a warm shiver down his spine, in the best way possible. He noticed he was gently rubbing Malfoy’s left-hand ring finger, and hoped that he didn’t take note of the absentminded action, no matter how hopeful it was.
“In the north? Why?” he asked. Hogwarts was so much closer, though he hated to realize that the thought of Malfoy in the Durmstrang uniform was indeed an immediate thought that he had. Harry tried to stop a blush from creeping onto his face again while he was measuring Malfoy with his gaze.
Kingsley gave a long, tired sigh, and rubbed his temples, “And why, pray tell, should I do that?” he asked, clearly only entertaining Harry, but unbeknownst to himself giving him an opportunity to jam his foot in the door.
Another new piece of news was that McGonagall had offered Malfoy a job at Hogwarts. Harry had to admit that that made him trust Malfoy a bit more, knowing that McGonagall trusted him. Malfoy had said that he wouldn’t accept the position, but Harry had still entertained the idea of him as the Head of Slytherin house. To him it suddenly seemed so obvious for Malfoy to take the job. Harry had wondered what it would be like for him to send his kids to Hogwarts one day and have Malfoy, his former rival, teach them, even be their Head of House.
“No, nothing of the sorts,” Harry blurted out, a little too eagerly, “I actually came to tell her that, er, she is no longer a suspect in the case.” Malfoy’s face cleared immediately, and Harry took another deep breath, “but she should stick around, in case we, er, need her as a witness in the case.”
, Harry thought as he fell back on the bed, momentarily forgetting that he was still holding a glass of water, and spilling it on his robes and the covers.
“Can I tell you something?” Draco asked suddenly. He had a very calm look on his face, like he had come to some sort of a resolution he was now revealing.
“You were never alone, Draco,” Malfoy’s first name kind of just slipped out of Harry’s mouth before he had the chance to stop himself, he hadn't even thought about it. Malfoy flinched and gave a quick glance at Harry, before seemingly stopping himself and firmly staring out of the window again. It was possible that Harry imagined it, but he could’ve sworn that a light red colour was creeping up Malfoy’s neck.
Harry sighed again. “Right, I know you have nothing better to do apparently than to stand around waiting for people to come home from spending their Friday nights, but I can guarantee you, Patrick Evergrey is the best of the best, she believes in Narcissa’s innocence.” That was the only thing Harry could say, and even now he felt like he was repeating himself, he had already told all of this to Narcissa, so why the fuck was her prodigal son here now?
Ackerman?” he asked suddenly, “You work for the infamous Syrena Ackerman?” Harry wondered if Draco knew something more than he did, but didn't think it the right moment to inquire about it. He knew Ackerman was the best of the best what it came to public defence lawyers, she had abandoned her job at a prestigious law firm to “fight the good fight” or whatever it had said on the cover of the random magazine Harry remembered seeing some years ago.
Now the door opened carefully, and Narcissa’s figure appeared in the entryway. Her hair was in a bun, and her face was tight with nervousness, although it seemed to ease a bit upon her seeing that it was Harry who was standing on her yard. “Potter, how unexpected to see you here,” she said politely, but struggled to produce a smile, “are you on official business?” Again, she thought that Harry was there to arrest her, or interrogate her, or some other thing related to police showing up at one’s door.
Harry had plenty of material on the Dursleys and how ghastly they were, the lot. “For ten years, my room was a cupboard, that was under the stairs in the hall,” Harry asserted and monitored Malfoy’s face for a reaction.
Draco looked taken aback, like Hermione had just personally promised to break Lucius out of jail. “I… thank you,” he stammered, and gave a nod at her. Maybe, for the first time, he was starting to see a light flickering at the end of what was admittedly turning out to be a very long tunnel.
The speech was followed by everyone quickly hurrying up the stairs to their assigned places. Harry saw Rivers and another Auror who Patrick had called Griffiths quickly transfigure their Ministry cloaks into regular ones and step out of the store onto the dark street. Patrick cast the Anti-Disapparition Jinx as he and Harry shuffled into the back room of the store, nodding at the owner behind the counter who looked a bit nauseous.
Malfoy’s eyes went wide. “I don’t know, when you almost murdered me? When you stole my wand?” his tone went up an octave, but he kept his voice down to avoid being heard too clearly by the tea lady.
Harry was staring at his reflection in the mirror of the guest bathroom. He had been going over the contents of his bag, and realized that he hadn’t packed anything nice to wear. In the midst of leaving, he hadn’t even thought about the possibility that they would actually go on a date, if this even was one. Was this a date? They were going out together, was that a definition of a date? Whatever it was, Harry was underdressed for it. The only thing with collars he’d packed was a wrinkled denim shirt, which he had managed to iron, after minutes of rummaging around his brain, trying to remember the correct spell, that wouldn’t turn the piece of clothing green, or accidentally wash it. So, Harry was wearing a white tee, over which he had thrown the denim shirt, unbuttoned, paired with some new black jeans and the sneakers he had on before. The only shoes that he’d brought.
“Alright, follow me, you dickhead,” Harry rolled his eyes and tried not to respond to the smirk that spread on Malfoy’s face. Harry led him to a spacious office space with six large desks and piles upon piles of paperwork, parchments laying on every feasible surface. Only two other Aurors were there aside from them, and they were so deeply buried in their stacks of paper they wouldn't flinch when Harry entered, Malfoy a step behind him.
“More than I’d like to admit,” Malfoy raised his eyebrows quickly, “I came here the first time I ever visited this place, best pizza I’ve ever had to this day.” So, they were having pizza then. Harry wondered what else was even on the menu.
Next, Malfoy kissed Harry’s stomach softly, and mouthed his hard-on through his pyjama bottoms. Then, in one smooth motion, he pulled both Harry’s pyjamas and his pants off. Malfoy then pressed his tongue flat on the base of Harry’s cock and licked from the bottom up in one long motion, before taking the tip in his mouth. Harry’s eyes widened when he watched Malfoy do this to him, it was too much, he had to lower his head on the pillow.
Why was he there? Harry was anxious to even think about the answer, to truly examine his motives. He wanted to know why Malfoy was acting so strangely, he wanted to know if Malfoy wanted to be his friend, if he wanted… Harry decided to cut himself off right there, he had been silent already for too long. Eventually, he decided to go with the half-truth, and admit that “I… don’t know.”
Harry shot a pleading look at Malfoy, who was reluctant at first, but clearly wanted to oblige Harry. He finally followed him on one side of the net, joining the Italians, leaving their stuff on the side lines. Harry couldn’t understand anything the locals were saying the whole game, but nevertheless had a blast, running after the ball, only hitting it nearly. Even Malfoy turned out to be quite good, pitching the ball over the net multiple times. Probably because he was taller, Harry thought jealously. Why did wizards only have one sport? Not to say flying wasn’t exhilarating, but running and jumping around after a ball just to hit over a net, only for it to be returned back like a hot potato, was quite fun, too.
Even though Harry was antsy to get a move on, he had to do one more thing before leaving for a month. He strode through the busy corridors of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, past his own office, and took a left to find the right door. Harry placed a brisk knock on Patrick’s door frame, and entered before hearing so much as a ‘come in’. Patrick looked surprised to find Harry in his office so suddenly, and but down his quill. “Harry, what is it?” by now he knew to skip whatever pleasantries would normally be exchanged between co-workers, especially when Harry was clearly in a hurry.
, he wanted his company, he wanted his attention, by Merlin he wanted his touch. Harry went a little red from his cheeks, “I think I might be,” he confessed.
But Malfoy didn’t seem the least bit thrown by this. In fact, the corner of his mouth turned upwards into a smirk, and his eyes were gleaming bright. “To be fair, I only asked you for a drink, and as I recall it was you who turned it into a date, so actually–“
. They have been underground for almost a century, there’s not much information recorded,” Evergrey took a seat in front of Harry’s desk.
helped me in the slightest? Because they didn’t!” the man was clearly only revving up for more, “That Malfoy bitch didn't happen to just be there, you pitiful twits,
“But what if I make the wrong choice?” he had to ask, “What if they don’t like me? What if I don’t like them as much as I think I might?” In his ears he sounded pathetic, but Ginny didn’t seem to think so.
It’s all about you prancing around pretending to be horny for the law, but then arresting innocent people LIKE MY MOTHER,” Draco was now yelling, and looked at Harry like he was a pile of steaming hot dragon shit, “face it, you’re just a phony who got in his head that he is above everyone else, because he managed to not get killed a couple times.”
“Right,” Harry said dryly. Technically, it wasn’t his problem anymore since he wasn’t on the case, which also meant that he didn’t have to deal with the Malfoys anymore. That’s why he had wanted the case to be over after all. Why didn’t he feel any type of relief?
“You told her before me?” Hermione’s voice intensified in volume, but she quickly composed herself as the waiter came to collect their empty dishes, “Never mind that, she’s right,” she leaned back in her chair, looking unhappy that Harry had confided in Ginny with his secret. It wasn’t his fault! She had been right there, interviewing him about his love life.
As Rivers and McGallon were taking Lucius back to the holding cells, Harry stalked behind them with Mrs Ackerman. Together they agreed to let Narcissa and Draco see Lucius before his transfer to a more permanent confinement cell. Once Lucius had been escorted back to his cell, McGallon agreed to bring ‘his wife and son’, while Rivers and Mrs Ackerman slid out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Lucius.
Dargan was throwing more hexes at Harry, without saying a word, forcing Harry to back away towards the window, trying still to cast Expelliarmus and Reducto at the man. Finally, in one swift movement, Dargan hit Harry right in the chest with Stupefy, whose force sent Harry hurling through the window behind him.
Harry ended up just staring at Malfoy, who was staring back at him. Harry was trying to conjure his most scornful look, but realized that he could never beat the master. Truthfully, Harry was getting pretty sick of Malfoy’s games, always avoiding some personal elephant in his mind’s room and hiding behind sneering remarks and arrogance. Before Harry could challenge him to speak up, Evergrey entered the room with a start. Malfoy looked like a bucket of cold water had just been thrown in his face, and he gave a hurried glance at both Patrick and Harry. “Right, I was just leaving, I’ll leave you two to it,” Malfoy nodded at Evergrey but did not make more eye contact, and swiftly left through the open door.
He felt like an absolute tit having to ask what it meant. He had not paid any attention in Latin class in school, and had barely passed, cheating off of Hermione. To be fair, he had had a couple other things on his mind at the time.
“It’s just my bedroom,” Malfoy said almost too nonchalantly for it to be natural. Harry nodded in order to bypass the reply as swiftly as possible. He then carried his stuff to the small guest room. There was a double bed there, and a closet, the window displayed a view to the plaza. A door led to a bathroom with light blue towels neatly folded onto a shelf. Harry threw his bag on the ground, and checked his reflection in the mirror. He looked passable, but still performed a quick cleaning spell on himself. Then he returned to the living room.
Harry let out a dry laugh and shook his head. “You’ve only heard two stories, and I lived with them until I was seventeen, believe me when I tell you that you haven’t heard anything yet,” he gave a Malfoy a bashful glance from the corner of his eye, and saw the man quickly look away from him, as in a reflex. He noticed that Harry had seen the rushed twist of his head, and turned to look at him again. His expression was vexed but curious, like he was fighting an inner battle of wanting to know more, but not wanting to make Harry relive memories that might be painful. Harry appreciated his silence, but was glad to be talking about the Dursley’s with someone, convince himself that he wasn’t crazy thinking that they were horrible.
“The plaque says that there’s a rumour, that lovers who share a kiss in the fountain have eternal good fortune,” Malfoy said, and Harry couldn’t come up with but one reason why he would tell him that.

her, she’s behind everything, she used the Imperius Curse on me, I swear!” The man’s tone was almost mocking, he was clearly trying to fuck with them. His lack of seriousness really irked Harry’s nerve, who was not in the mood for dancing around one another, he had done that enough with you-know-who (Malfoy). What he really wanted was to get to the bottom of the matter, but it seemed that the harder they pressed, the more difficult it was to get answers out of the man.
“I know,” Malfoy replied, his response quiet but immediate, Harry realized that he wasn’t the only one feeling the finality of the moment, “I’m sorry, I’ve got to go.” Whereas Harry wanted to drag out the time, Malfoy had decided to end their torment, coldly but mercifully. Leaving now meant that they could both start processing the past weeks quicker, to get over them faster.
Harry folded the piece of parchment carefully and threw it swiftly across the room. It didn’t stop its flight, instead, it flew right out of the open door and towards the office of Kingsley Shacklebolt. Harry knew the matter would have to wait until Monday, and there wasn’t anything to do at the office anymore, and it was Saturday after all, so he decided to leave and go home to get some sleep. He was meeting Ron in the evening for a pint at the Jade Toad.
There was a sound of clothes shuffling, and Harry saw Malfoy’s silhouette shrugging below him. He still wasn’t moving, he was just standing there, arms to his sides. “I wouldn’t go as far as
It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes, grateful for the change in topic. “If I had, I’d assume you’d know about it.”
After what would have been a heated conversation, if either of them would have had solid arguments against making an offer, they went through with it, after which they marched straight into Gringotts, like sensible people do, and applied for a mortgage. It was all worth it, even though they would be paying off the loan for two decades to come.
Lucius eyed him bitterly, but not quite as murderously as before. He was sitting on the hard bunk that was propped against the far wall, and now turned his gaze to glare at the toilet bowl. “I can’t believe you pulled it off,” he said quietly but very scathingly, as if Harry had somehow properly managed to fool the court into salvaging him.
“Right then, see you tomorrow, Saviour,” Malfoy quirked his eyebrow while pocketing his wand, and before Harry could protest, vanished out the door in a swish of green robes and blond hair.
Harry frantically made his way into the hallway, and looked at his reflection in the mirror: he was wearing his muggle sweatpants and an old Quidditch t-shirt that was too tight. Harry tried to quickly smooth out his hair with his fingers, he had left his wand in the kitchen, shit. It was too late to get it now.
he in love with Malfoy? It seemed to be clear to Narcissa, who was now sitting at the edge of her seat, hands clasped together in her lap. Was it that after all of this time of being alone, and an even longer time of hating Malfoy, Harry was in love?
Now Harry tried to loosen the tight collar of the robe with his finger, peering into the mirror, and just opted to open the uppermost button in order to breathe. The silver embroidery of the jacket was scratchy against his neck, and he thought that the decorated buttons were too much, but the black robes also made him look official and esteemed. He picked a hair out of the outer robe and strode over to the fireplace in his living room. Harry grabbed some Floo-powder from a decorative pot on top of the sill, and was quickly off in a flash of green fire.
Ron and Hermione’s place was the same as always: clean and organized. Freshly cut flowers in a vase, the smell of food wafting throughout the house, the afternoon sun hitting the potted greens in the living room, fresh herbs sitting side by side on the kitchen counter, and the radio silently playing on the background. Harry was a bit apprehensive about bringing Malfoy with him, but he didn't see another option. If Ron and Draco wanted to fight it out, Harry and Hermione would be ready to tackle them both at the spot. Harry sensed that Malfoy, too, was a bit jittery as they walked through the blooming front garden and over the threshold.
“I told you, thanks to you, the Ministry’s turning my mother’s house upside down,” Malfoy voiced his previous explanation bitingly, but it felt as flimsy as Harry’s had sounded when he had been asked the same question by Malfoy a week ago.
Harry thought to himself bitterly. “And, and this is just my personal recommendation, no more flying out of windows, clear?” She gave Harry a stern look followed by a crooked smile to which he responded in kind.
“The Clarence? It’s pretty close,” Hermione had also lifted the hood of her robes up to protect her from the constant rain. They were walking quite briskly, and Harry hoped that the place would be very near – the weather made him feel more gloomy than he already was. Also, he was cold.
Harry couldn’t have gotten out of that Merlin forsaken place faster if he flied. He remembered gliding through the seemingly endless corridors and toward the portkey, eventually handed to him by the front clerk. Harry grabbed it tightly, and waited for the twisting and turning to start, taking him back to the Ministry, where he had left. After the (once again) horrific journey, and after surviving the strong bout of nausea that invariably followed, Harry took a deep breath to steady himself, and Flooed back to his place.
. But, woe was him, he was at the hospital again, and he was uncomfortable in the knowledge that he might have actually come here instead of going to the matron at the Ministry just so he could see Malfoy again. But no one had to know, right? It wasn’t like it was painfully obvious why he was here again, was it? Except that it was, since Malfoy himself had brought it up. Harry wanted to die just a little bit.
However, he settled for nodding. “Yeah, he’s at lunch with Hermione,” he clarified, “where I would be too right now if Robards hadn’t told me that someone was coming from St Mungo’s to report something.” Harry cleared his desk from the previous parchments he had been going over, and opened his desk drawer to pull out a stack of forms. Oh, how he loathed paperwork, he’d rather get blasted off a roof than see one more interdepartmental memo on his desk. Especially if Malfoy would be there to take care of him with his warm fingers. Ahem.
“Oh, and this arrived for you,” the woman pulled out a Ministry envelope from her pocket and handed it to Harry, who thanked her. She didn’t stick around to find out what the letter said, but politely left the room.
“Making progress in the memory potion case I see, very good,” Kingsley said, and signed the paper. He handed it back to Harry and removed his glasses with his other hand.
Before Harry could be sucked deeper into his personal pit of despair, Malfoy returned with a vial. Harry hated how fast his heart was suddenly racing, being startled from his thoughts. The liquid inside the small bottle was light blue and swirled around a little. Malfoy handed it to Harry, who uncorked it and, after a suspicious glance at Malfoy – who looked intrigued like he was observing an exotic zoo animal –, knocked it down in one go.
Where he expected the git to storm out, he heard him let out a light laugh, and his head all but jerked to look at him in shock. Malfoy was making such an annoying, Malfoy-ish face, that Harry was briefly connected to his eleven-year-old self who just wanted to punch him in the face. “So, you’ve been treated by me three times now, and you’re still wondering what I’m doing these days? Honestly, Potter, it will forever remain a mystery to me who ever allowed you to be an Auror, with your infallible skills of deduction.” Malfoy looked like every word he spoke rejuvenated him from some kind of a rut he had been in: his face was positively glowing being able to make a jab at Harry. “How’s the ankle, by the way?”
“First full day of being a wizard? I’ll never forget it,” Harry replied, smiling back at Malfoy, recalling the feeling he’d had as an eleven-year-old, stomping along Diagon Alley for the very first time. First day of being away from the Dursley’s, hopefully for good. First day of living in the truth, of being free, of being somebody special. He remembered seeing the Nimbus 2000 in the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies, and getting Hedwig from Hagrid. Maybe he should get another owl, he thought, name it Hedwig II.
Harry sighed, unsure how to formulate the thoroughly vile description of Snape’s death. “Voldemort made Nagini attack him, I saw him bleed to death,” he said carefully, deciding that there was no benefit in talking about it in an embellished way, Snape would certainly not have wanted that, “I stopped dreaming about it perhaps two years ago,” Harry admitted.
He Apparated into the neighbourhood the man was reported staying at. Harry strode to knock on the door of Ms. Birch, who happened to be home. After a quick chat with Rory’s mother, a pleasant lady – worried about his son’s behaviour, Harry had to use Petrificus Totalus on the git trying to climb out of his window and run away. “Sorry about that,” he said to the mother, mainly. No one wants to see their son get arrested.
Harry didn’t have time for small talk, he was terrible at it anyway, but what he was not terrible at, was duelling. He grabbed the closest jar in his reach and hurled it backwards over the counter at Dargan to distract him, while standing up and casting a very powerful Stupefy. The man managed to conjure a Protego, but it wasn’t strong enough to shield him from the strength of Harry’s spell, and he stumbled a few steps backwards. Harry saw the opportunity and cast Expelliarmus and Petrificus Totalus, which Dargan swerved, but only nearly. He responded with Reducto and a stinging jinx that hit Harry in the shoulder. Harry fell backwards against the cabinet and very closely ducked a Confringo blasting the cupboard to pieces falling on him. He got hit by another stinging jinx right on his chest and yelped. Right when Harry thought that his opponent was going to deliver the finishing punch, an Expelliarmus sent Dargan’s wand flying across the room.
The third stop was an old church in the centre, still open for tourists at such a late hour. It wasn’t large, but its stained-glass windows were a work of art, and knowing that it was built nearly a millennium ago, one couldn’t not be impressed by the details of the stone work. Draco and Harry stepped into the cool church, with its huge slate flooring and tall ceiling. Malfoy told him that there was a rumour that the legendary warlock Merlin’s son was buried beneath the floor tiles. Apparently, everyone had a different story as to why it had come to pass, and thus it was not taken overly seriously.
“Unfortunately not, just honest work lifting weights,” Harry mumbled and managed to open all the buttons of Draco’s shirt, he pulled it completely off. Underneath the shirt his skin was pale, although traces of a tan were still to be found. Harry had an irresistible urge to touch Malfoy's bare skin, and when he did, for some reason he was surprised to find it warm. He had always assumed that Draco ran as cold as his manner. Harry bit his lip while running his hands on the man’s sides, and leaving them to rest on his waist.
Isaac shrugged gently. “Impossible to say. Based on the inscription inside though it seems that it is indeed an M and not a W. They are inscribed in the same direction.
sounded clunky and self-centred, Draco was trying to accept his past, not atone it, and the words got stuck in Harry’s throat. Gracelessly, Malfoy got up from the floor and flopped onto the couch, pulling Harry’s legs in his lap, “but to be fair,” he continued, “I was a bit hopelessly in love with you back then, or at least, I was going to be.”
Just when Harry had cleaned his breakfast dishes and put them away, there was a sharp knock on his front door. Demanding yet polite: his heart jumped into his throat. What was Malfoy doing at his place,
, she would be Harry’s path to convincing the others – he already had his next question lined up. “Would you agree it important information to have, not only historically, but practically?” Harry continued. Investigating the unknown dark magic behind the symbol might well be Lucius’ way to freedom, or at least, back to life.
“Is this going somewhere, or am I free to leave?” Malfoy sat straighter in the chair, his hands on the arms, looking like he was ready to jump up and stride out any second.
It went on like this for the better part of twenty minutes as Harry – or rather, the self-writing quill – was taking Malfoy’s statement. Someone had been stealing some very valuable, rare potions from the third-floor cooling storage, and they couldn’t find out who it was, so they were forced to report it to the Aurors. Finally, the quill set itself back down into a bottle of ink, and Harry leafed through the details, it seemed that he had everything he needed. “Right, and you have been working at the hospital for how long now?” he inquired, trying to sound like he was still trying to fill in some gaps in the investigation, rather than pry details of Malfoy’s life.
Draco drew a sharp gasp like he had been holding his breath for the past hour, and collapsed to sit right next to the sofa, leaning onto the cushion and stretching out his legs. His placed the tea out of his hands and let his head fall backwards to lean on the couch cushion, eyes facing the ceiling. “It’s going to be alright,” he said, like a whisper. Harry hadn’t truly realized how hopeless Draco had been about the whole matter, until he saw a tear escaping the corner of the man’s eye, and streaking its way down to his ear.
“Always,” Harry replied, heart suddenly beating faster. He hoped Draco couldn’t feel his pulse, holding his hand, while he raised his eyes to face the grey stare now looking straight at him, making him feel more seen than he had in a very long while. Eyes open, arms open, heart open, Harry was ready for whatever Malfoy was going to say next.
But now, there was Malfoy. His arch nemesis from school with an insufferable manner but with a tendency to show up wherever Harry was. Narcissa had said that Malfoy was lonely, and Harry could relate to that; seemed like they had similar reasons for it as well. He wondered if Malfoy wanted kids. If he would ever consider moving back to England.
Harry agreed immediately, “Absolutely, I’d love to,” he nodded eagerly. How he wanted children of his own too, but for now, he loved being godfather to however many children Ron and Hermione would have.
Somehow Harry was able to open his mouth and say something, even though there were a thousand things going through his mind at that moment. “Mrs Malfoy, I don’t mean to be impolite, but, I’m pretty sure your son doesn’t like me. As a matter of fact, it is quite clear he doesn’t want anything to do with me.”
Harry woke up with a startle. It felt as though no time had passed, while simultaneously his body felt as stiff as if he had been sleeping for three days straight. He sat up, not knowing where he was or why he was there. He looked at the sofa and his shoes on the ground confusedly, while slowly coming to. He sat up entirely now, and felt a warm breeze on his face, smelling of seawater. The door to the balcony was open, and the sun had dropped considerably from when he had fallen asleep. What time was it?
Harry stared back at him, unsure how to respond, “I don’t know… is it?” He hoped that Malfoy would give him an answer, that he would say something along the lines of
?” Harry insisted, but now sighing tiredly, laying on his side beside Draco, one of the man’s arms squished between his side and the covers. He made a complaining sound but didn’t try to pull his limb away.
The weather was gloomy, the clouds of late February were hanging low and down fell a light but persistent drizzle. The three Aurors in their dark rain cloaks were making their way in the shadows down the paved street. When they passed Borgin and Burkes, Harry couldn’t help looking its way – the door had been nailed shut, some of the windows were broken, and the paint was slowly peeling off. Harry tried to shrug off every piece of memory he had of that ghastly place, beginning from when he had accidentally Floo’d there when he was twelve. It felt like a lifetime ago, fifteen years for Merlin’s sakes. Harry wished he could have said that times were simpler then, and in a way, they were, but trying to be offed by Voldemort constantly really put a damper on his school years.
In the meanwhile, Harry had fetched the wretched ring from evidence and gone through the Ministry’s library in the search for books that could maybe help him solve what the hell that M meant. He wanted to rule out that it denoted M for Malfoy, he didn’t know why, or perhaps it was because he was sick and tired of that family’s shenanigans, but he didn’t want it to be Malfoy. Or maybe, just maybe, he had had to admit to himself that Draco had moved up from
Evergrey slammed his fist on the table, and the loud sound was magnified in the austere room. “We know about your grandfather, and the Marigold, now tell us…
However, as soon as Malfoy had said that, Harry realized how heavy his limbs felt. Perhaps a little lie down wouldn’t hurt, maybe he would then have the energy to be eventually kicked out by Malfoy. Harry carefully stretched out on the sofa, kicking his shoes off, and pressing his head on the cushion. Maybe he wasn’t that tired, after all. But when he closed his eyes, he didn’t even notice how the screeches of the seagulls were rapidly fading away, before dozing off into a deep slumber.
“It’s about the case,” he started and realized that that was probably not the thing to say to put her mind at ease, “but don’t worry, er, you’re not in any kind of trouble, I’m just here to talk.” Harry wasn’t sure if that was any better, but the woman’s expression did change to a little less agitated one when she heard what he had to say.
Harry heard Malfoy snort. “I’m sorry to inform you that this is not a dream,” the man said in a scornful tone, “though I would much prefer it to be,” he added dryly.
Draco’s face split into an amused smile, and he straightened his posture from where he had been hunching against the doorframe. “Pleasure to meet you again, Miss Rose,” he smiled politely and bowed – bowed! ­– his head the tiniest bit, his blond hair falling on his face.
“Well,” Harry started, thinking about how to phrase the logic Dumbledore had had at the time, “he believed that, since aunt Petunia was my mum’s sister, it would somehow protect me from Voldemort, you know, through her sacrifice.” Harry hated saying that, he hated saying that his mum had sacrificed herself. It wasn’t that it wasn’t true, but Harry was so sick of everyone having to risk their lives for him for so many years, Lily being the very first one.
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled, ashamed, and noticed that his pizza didn’t taste as wonderful as it had before. It had gone a bit cold, too. Harry was chewing on the dough that was just rolling around in his mouth, not making its way to his stomach. He hated how insufferable he always had to be.
“Signore Malfoy, you have a visitor!” the man exclaimed and gestured towards Harry, and Harry realized he had never gotten his name, how rude of him. Though right now, little other mattered than the way in which Malfoy’s silvery eyes met Harry’s. Harry’s eyes were locked with his, his palms sweaty and his arm hair risen up in gooseflesh. Even though he had come all this way to see the man, Harry still felt utterly unprepared to actually face him now. Malfoy was carrying a brown grocery bag on his arm, and another, smaller plastic bag in his other hand, but now, he had stopped in his tracks when he had caught sight of Harry.
Immediately, his flow was interrupted, when Edward Scot started speaking. “Don’t thank us,” he chortled, “thank Kingsley for bloody forcing us to be here!” Edward was a short, plump man in his sixties, with a red face and a balding head. He was a man of reason and a fair judge of character, but his opening line did not encourage Harry about his mission. A light chuckle went across the room, Harry tried to go along with it.
Harry’s heart ached for Draco and Narcissa. He wished the man hadn’t had to go through all that he’d been through, or at least, he wished he could have been there for him. He wanted to show Draco that not everyone was just looking for something to gain, that there was some good in the world, people willing to help others.
“That’s enough, Malfoy,” Harry interrupted. He didn’t want to hear him insult Ginny or anyone else Harry cared about for that matter. He felt quite overwhelmed. Malfoy had… had a crush on him? It was beyond Harry’s comprehension; the wanker had always been so incredibly horrible to anyone and everyone. If someone had told him then… well, he would have hardly believed it. He simply wouldn’t have.
Harry had managed to calm her down and tell her how heroic Patrick had been, and that he only had a few broken bones, nothing serious. She and Harry sat in silence for a long while, watching people come and go, before a Healer appeared to let them know that they could see Patrick now. At that point, Harry had excused himself, not wanting to intrude on an intimate moment, and Kathy had thanked him for bringing her husband to the hospital.
Harry got up from the chair, and sat down cross-legged in front of the fireplace. His hands were trembling slightly, and he had to draw a deep breath to steady himself. Was this stupid? Was he being stupid? Just the other day he had been convinced that Malfoy didn't give two trolls’ arse about him, yet here he was, holding a note that had the potential to change many things. Or more accurately, one great big thing. But Harry had to know, he
Harry froze, he was sure he had misheard. For some awful reason his heart sped up for a few beats when he heard this. He hated himself for wanting to know more, if he legitimately hated Malfoy, he would have simply claimed he didn’t know what she was talking about and left the scene, never seeing another Malfoy again. But instead, he said, “Er, what do you mean, exactly?”
was forecasting a heat wave to hit the UK later in July. Kingsley Shacklebolt’s re-election campaign was going strong with advertisements in papers, posters put up in the Ministry, and repeated public appearances, whether it was to personally visit young patients in St. Mungo’s, or shaking the hand of some small business owner at Diagon Alley.
The man, his posture suddenly rigid again, grabbed the couch cushion like a stress ball, and stared at the ceiling. “Well fuck me,” he huffed, “what the fuck can we even say?” he clasped his hands together in the air in front of him, and pleaded ironically, “Please mister Minister, please don’t kill my dad, I know he’s a murderer and an accessory to intended genocide, but he means so much to me,” Draco lowered his hands and made a disgusted sound.
Then he withdrew from the kiss and sat astride on Harry’s waist. He slowly took off Harry’s glasses and placed them on the side table. “Don’t think I’ve ever seen you like this,” he mumbled.
“How did you feel when you got your Hogwarts letter?” Harry asked. It seemed like such a regular occurrence to magical children, kind of like getting your tax returns as a muggle, expected yet pleasant, that he hadn't heard many stories about it. But he wanted to hear the normal version of getting one’s letter, the one that doesn’t include someone taking off with their entire family to avoid Dumbledore’s power.
“Fine,” Harry said, but demanded one more answer from Malfoy before he would piss off again, most definitely leaving him feel like an utter tit with some smooth one-liner, “so why’d you stay, if you weren’t waiting to tell me off?”
Wherever he looked, there was someone there. Bill and Fleur with their three kids, Molly and Arthur, George with someone Harry didn’t know, even Charlie and Percy were there. Harry had arrived at the same time as Ron, Hermione, and Rose, and they were now being greeted by everyone as they walked in the door, Harry following in their footsteps. The front door had received some fresh paint since the last time he was there, and it seemed that Arthur had installed some kind of a muggle doorbell to the outside wall. Harry couldn’t help being amused at his never-ending fascination with muggle artefacts.
Harry yawned so big it hurt his jaw. Over the weekend Kingsley had implemented small scale permission slips in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, which in practice meant that not only did Harry have to file for permission for everything from Kingsley, but now the people working in his department also had to file permits for Harry to approve. This caused dozens of memos to now find themselves on his desk, all hours of the day. It didn’t help that Harry had slept poorly the previous night; every time he thought the nightmares had stopped, he woke up in cold sweat from one horrid dream or another.
“Oh yeah, sure, so… first of all, we did get Ridgenorth, but he managed to take a gulp of his own medicine, so to speak, er… so now he can’t tell his hat from a Flobberworm. The Department of Mysteries is trying to brew a potion to counter the effects so that we can interrogate him, but they say it might take weeks,” Harry tried to describe everything as concisely as he could, Patrick was just nodding slowly, frowning at the empty fireplace.
“Cut it out, Malfoy,” Harry huffed in frustration, “I never asked to be… you know…” he hated when people used those terms to talk about him like he was someone other than an orphan who had been forced to try to save everybody every year. It made him sound so big-headed when the reality had been something else entirely. Far from glorious.
He came to a couple of seconds later when the man was shaking him gently, Harry drew in a sharp breath, something somewhere was definitely broken. “Bloody hell, Harry, what the fuck were you thinking?!” Evergrey was talking loudly and frantically, trying to keep Harry from passing out.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. “Potter, am I having a sudden aneurysm or did you just pay me a compliment?”
, which had made the topic definitely off the table. He didn’t consider himself a private person, but wasn’t that quick to share either, he couldn’t imagine talking to someone about such intimate things as desire.
The blond man gave him a one last glance, something hiding behind his eyes, a dark fire. A determined look someone gets when they have decided to do something bold. He stood there for a few seconds too long, and just when Harry thought he had changed his mind, and was going to… do
“Office of the Minister, please,” Harry huffed through semi-gritted teeth, and the wizard working the elevator pressed the button for
“I know you visited my mother today,” Malfoy started, but lacked the aggressiveness that usually accompanied his statements. Harry’s heart jumped again, did that mean that Narcissa had told Draco what they had discussed? Harry wasn’t sure if he could deal with such a conversation right now, even though he had so boldly intended to have it. On the other hand, though, he was still a bit drunk, and maybe that would be all the courage he needed.
What was Malfoy afraid of? Harry was just as vulnerable in the situation than he was. What held him back on letting his guard down just once, for Harry to sneak in? Was it that his dad had always been such a stone-cold bastard that Draco had never learnt how to express his feelings? Give in to them? Or was it that the man had been thrown around, used as a pawn, too much for him to ever trust someone again? He could trust Harry. Harry, who had been the pawn of Dumbledore for seventeen years. He better than anyone understood what it was like, but closing yourself to anyone and everyone was not the solution. Harry could show him that, he would have.
“A lovely place, are you getting settled in well, Mrs Malfoy?” Harry asked politely, because he sensed that this conversation was to be handled very gently. Ten years in Azkaban was surely a traumatizing experience for anyone, Harry remembered a bit too well the feeling that an approaching Dementor caused, and didn’t want to give Narcissa any more reason to feel afraid. He quite firmly believed in her innocence.
Why should he? Why should Harry? Because he was in love? Because… “I owe his family that much, Kingsley, and so do you, they’ve been through enough as it is,” Harry heard himself say, and wasn’t quite sure how his argument would go over. He didn’t really have firm grounds on which Malfoy’s life should be saved – he had marched here in such a hurry that he hadn’t really had the time to formulate a solid defence yet.
Now Harry all but jumped up from his chair. “Patrick!” he yelped, but didn’t know what to do next, hugging would be a bit awkward, but a handshake would be too official. Harry just ended up nodding at the man. “By all means, come in, take a seat. How are you?”
Syrena Ackerman, on the other hand, was a thin witch wearing dark red velvety robes, her grey-streaked hair in a neat bun. Her sharp eyes were focused as they scanned the room, and her lips were pressed tightly shut. Harry could almost hear the sigh of admiration Hermione emitted.
“Er, thanks,” Harry said awkwardly, desperately trying to figure out how to return Malfoy’s careful compliment, “you too.” Maybe it was too obvious a reply, but the man seemed to take it well, at least he was not rejecting Harry’s cautious attempt at approaching him. It was definitely a start.
Malfoy snorted. “Mhm, suppose you’re half right, then,” he muttered, and that ended up being the end of that discussion. Harry decided to let it go, and moved carefully closer to Malfoy, giving him a light kiss on his temple, but not staying to cuddle as to not make him feel too stifled. Harry tried to balance between showing his support and attention, and giving Draco the space he needed.
Harry almost jumped when he heard Theseus Scamander start talking from his portrait. He so rarely said anything Harry nearly forgot he was there half the time. “The
However, when Syrena Ackerman entered the room with Lucius in her footsteps, Draco looked like he was about to be sick. Something deep inside Harry’s stomach turned, and he tore his eyes off Draco to look at Lucius now taking a seat in the large chair in the middle of the room. He had shaved, and his hair looked cleaner, his robes changed from prison garments to a simple black outfit which he seemed to hate wearing with every fibre of his being. Despite these adjustments, he still looked rough, the dark circles under his eyes visible even to Harry, who was sitting high up in the crowd, and his presence somehow worn from what it had once been.
“Sorry I had to come in these clothes, I have a work thing after,” Harry said apologetically, referring to the Auror robes he was wearing, but Hermione waved it away, “We’re just glad you made it.”
Harry nodded, blushing. He didn’t really know how to reply, he was only doing what was right, right? At least he hoped he was, and in any case, Draco was already sick and tired of hearing about ‘the right thing’ anyway. “Of course, you know,” Harry tried to put into words what he wanted to say, but wasn’t quite sure himself what that was, so he just settled at lifting his hand to give a squeeze to Draco’s bicep and saying, “let’s just hope all goes well.”
Just as Harry had expected, the Minister sat behind his desk, looking very tired, reading through a huge stack of parchments that looked like enough paperwork to start an entirely new Ministry somewhere. It was Sunday morning, but the poor man gearing up for elections in three weeks was not resting. Apparently, he didn’t even notice Harry appearing into his office, because he only looked up when Harry cleared his throat loudly. “Harry,” he exclaimed, voice breathy, “back already? I thought you were taking the month off.”
Before Harry was able to come to any specific conclusion, the door to his room opened, and a plump lady in nurse’s robes entered. Her eyes widened a little upon seeing Harry look back at her, but just cleared her throat in a most friendly way. “Good morning dear,” she chirped at Harry, conjuring up a glass of water and pushing it into his hand, “I thought my charms detected some movement here, glad to see you’re finally awake, how do you feel?” She pointed her wand at the window and the curtains pulled themselves aside swiftly, ribbons tying the fabric neatly to either side.
“Anything that wasn’t Quidditch didn’t live up to it, so I had to buy my way in, or rather, my father did,” Draco said, very neutrally. He didn't seem to have any emotion when talking about his reputation and his dad. He seemed to be working hard to suppress it, and Harry couldn't blame him.
“But you thought it,” Harry muttered, “look, I know you don’t like Ron, and frankly, he’s not exactly in love with you either, but the Weasleys are good people, no matter what your dad told you about them, they took me in when I didn’t have anyone.” Suddenly Harry felt that the conversation had become very personal, he would defend Molly and Arthur like they were his own parents. They had practically adopted him from the start with their Christmas gifts and family holidays, not to mention that Ron was his best friend.
Evergrey nodded reluctantly and silently slipped into a side alley with his wand raised, his cloak flying in the wind behind him.
“Excuse me?” Malfoy sat up again, “You’re telling me that you were raised by these monsters? No wonder you were so horny for Hogwarts and Dumbledore and all that,” he shook his head while delivering his dig.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Come on, get a grip, what’s the worst that can happen?” To Harry’s misfortune, he had quite the imagination when it came to worst case scenarios. Be that as it may, he would have to pick up the check to make up for this therapy session.
The warmth from Draco’s chest combined with the utter peacefulness of the moment made Harry’s eyes close unwillingly. He planted a small kiss onto Malfoy’s skin, hoping that it wasn’t too much. Draco gave him a quick peck on his head, and that was it. After that, Harry drifted into a dreamless sleep, the first of many.
The portkey was just outside the house. Since it was a wizarding neighbourhood, and also quite early in the morning, they didn’t have to sneak anywhere private to start their journey. Both of them grabbed the portkey, which was scheduled to leave any minute, and held on to their bags, knuckles almost white. Harry had decided he hated international travel, and the early hours combined with the lack of breakfast had created a heavy pit in his stomach, that sure as hell would not be removed by being dangled around in a never-ending spiral of the portkey.
“I know, Hamish,” Harry nodded, and prepared for his first argument, “I hope you’ll still hear me out, and if you don’t mind, I’ll now present my first point of reasoning.” Hamish nodded approvingly, though still seeming to think the whole affair was a waste of his time. Harry cleared his throat nervously, hoping no one noticed the slight tremble in his hands, and then turned his attention to Penelope Jameson, who was sitting closest to him on the left side. She was the Head of the Department of Mysteries, and Harry’s best bet to get his foot in the door. “Penelope,” Harry addressed her, and she looked a tad startled to be talked to directly, “how much does the Department of Mysteries
“Thanks, but I think I’m okay for now, I think I’ll only become a Quidditch legend in my sixties,” Harry was able to conjure up a snort despite of his current state of agony.
, Harry still couldn't get over it. He felt like he had so many questions, too many to ask right now, anyway. So, he just nodded. He would be off tomorrow, that was good, right?
Ron took his wand out of his pocket and skilfully made three plates, along with glasses and cutlery, fly over to the dining table. “I’ve had lots of practice,” he demonstrated, and Harry gave the performance an approving nod but, for the safety of the dinner, decided to carry the casserole with oven mitts to the table himself, muggle style. The fire was crackling in the fireplace and the tealights in the middle of the table cast elaborate shadows on the place setting. Harry loved Ron and Hermione’s place, it was cosy and warm like the Burrow, but without the chaos, thanks to Hermione’s resentment towards clutter and untidiness.
“Well, sorry to disappoint,” Harry shrugged simply. He was used to disappointing people, and though he never tried to please Malfoy per se, he definitely knew there was no scenario where Malfoy wouldn’t have something negative to say about Harry.
“I suppose so,” he uttered in response, “though I have to admit, if I see one more permission slip on my desk I think I’ll lose it for good,” Harry gave a crooked smile at Patrick, who snickered. He had had to send a couple to Harry himself, too.
and he had been better off that way, but he knew what it was like, seeing somebody die right in front of you. Seeing Cedric die, seeing Sirius die, and Dumbledore, and Dobby, and so many others. Too many others. At least Malfoy hadn't personally known Charity Burbage, though that was a lean comfort, and Harry would not mention it.
After only a few minutes, Harry saw a growing dot fly towards him, and first only thought it a regular bird, hunting for breakfast. But soon Harry realized it was an owl, and it was carrying in its beak a letter. It clearly noticed Harry on the balcony, and in a massive swish of wings and feathers, landed on the railing, wrapping its long claws around the metal. It looked at Harry with its large eyes, waiting from him to grab the letter, so he did. It was addressed to Draco, in Narcissa’s handwriting. There was a twist in Harry’s already knotty stomach, like he just knew something was wrong.
“Why are the fancy sheep so scratchy then?” Noah demanded, face scrunching up, as he returned his arm to his side and moved to scratch from under his sleeve.
Malfoy caught sight of him staring at his face and Harry was sure the git would somehow hex his dick off with his mind, but instead he said quietly “Now, now, Potter, don’t get soppy on me.” Harry was speechless, he had never heard Malfoy so benign, but before he could reply… “Right, let’s do something about this, then.” The man shifted downwards and brushed his palm against Harry’s hard cock, Harry let out a sharp breath.
Harry opened the seal with the Ministry’s symbol on it, and quickly glanced the neat handwriting on the other side that said
Ron and Hermione stayed for about an hour, talking about this and that. Harry was grateful that they knew him too well to make more of a fuss about the incident. Instead, they talked about work, about Rosie’s new love for flying, and about the new Quidditch shop that was about to open next to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes on Diagon Alley. Ron also mentioned that the long-awaited opening for a second WWW in Hogsmeade was planned to take place in September when students would return to Hogwarts. The next one would be in Edinburgh, which made Harry think about Ginny. Not yearningly, not bitterly, only with a hint of past nostalgia.
“How did you suddenly decide that they had to go?” Harry asked, and at the same time, realized what was going on, “it’s to get votes, isn’t it? You’re executing a bunch of criminals who are already serving their time, to get re-elected, aren’t you?” he was now almost hissing at Kingsley. This was not the man he knew, the man who had been elected as Minister after Voldemort had been defeated was strong, compassionate, and honourable, the cowardice man now sitting in front of him was only a shadow of his past self.
But instead of mocking Harry, Malfoy spared him the embarrassment by continuing the argument. “When!?” he demanded, and his voice rose an octave, upon which the two other Aurors at the front of the room gave an absentminded glance their way before returning to their paperwork. Malfoy cleared his throat but didn’t repeat the question.
Draco rolled off of Harry, and stared at the ceiling contently, “Countryside, definitely countryside.”
The case itself was pretty clear-cut: someone had thrown a brick through the shop’s window the past Saturday night and managed to escape with multiple professional racing brooms. Harry had to shake his head at the crude style of the break-in; one would think that magic folk would have some sort of creativity when it came to robbing things, at least vanishing the showcase or something. Anyone could Reparo a window!
Harry darted after him, kissing him everywhere, undressing them both. A few moments later, they were naked, rolling around in the white sheets. Malfoy’s hands were everywhere, it felt like, they were in Harry’s hair, on his waist, cupping his arse, caressing his balls, it was too much. His arse was great, Harry noticed in the faint light, but didn’t have the time to admire it further. Draco was tan against the white sheets, and Harry hovered over him, kissing every inch of his body, something he’d waited to do for what felt like ages. He smelled like a cleaning charm, not unlike the one Harry had performed on himself, and he smiled into the crook of Malfoy’s waist.
After, the pair got out of the fountain, and dried themselves up, all without saying anything. The moment was perfect as it was, and in a way, they were both afraid that if they were to say something, it would break the illusion. So, they walked home in silence, hand in hand, through the warm, dark, Italian night.
The git seemed to falter half a second, before giving Harry a tight half-smirk from the corner of his mouth, accompanied by an eye roll. “Don’t be a knob, Potter, I hope I never see you here again.”
Next Saturday, Draco showed up at Harry’s door, dressed in formal robes. He kissed Harry’s cheek politely, and Apparated them into a very posh restaurant off Diagon Alley. He was very much himself the whole night, only nicer, and funnier, and infinitely more beautiful than Harry ever remembered him to be. He tasted the wine for them, he taught Harry which cutlery was used for which course, and he paid the bill, all the while making fun of how utterly dull and old fashioned all of it was.
Malfoy let out a heavy sigh, following Harry onto the sofa. “Not well, but I just can’t stand to be at the house, I told her I’d come here and make a plan with you, whatever that is,” the man lowered his head on Harry’s lap and threw his limbs up on the sofa. Harry’s fingers started to absentmindedly curl in between the golden streaks of hair, caressing it gently. The dark circles under Malfoy’s eyes, which mysteriously only appeared when he was in England, had deepened in shade, and Harry realized how exhausted they both were. “So,” Draco let out another tired sigh, “what’s the plan then? Where even were you, I thought you’d be home?”
Without thinking, Harry fell on his knees in front of Draco, whose cheeks were flushed red and whose eyes were hazily looking at Harry, now fumbling to pull Draco’s pants down. It was sloppy and wet and awkward, but Harry couldn’t shake the feeling of how kind of lovely it was at the same time. He let Draco lay him down on his bed and kiss him so gently a soft whimper escaped his lips as his eyes pressed tightly shut.
, against my better judgment.” Harry wasn’t in the mood to talk about it, granted he had brought it up, but hopefully Lucius would still have plenty of time to process the news, without Harry there.
Harry spun around, victorious, “We’re going to ask Hermione for help, she’ll know what to do, she always knows,” a huge wave of relief was washing over Harry, but the feeling was obviously not reflected in Draco’s face, which now turned a tad nauseous.
“Do you think that’s the best idea? I would guess Granger would happily side with the Ministry on this one,” Draco hesitated.
Harry got up from the chair and realized that he was already quite buzzed. He carefully made his way over to the bar and ordered two of the same draft they had been drinking. As the bartender was filling the pints, Harry noticed someone on the other end of the bar, blond hair, and at first, he thought it was Malfoy. His heart involuntarily skipped two beats, until he realized that it was the man from his gym. He had seemed to have noticed Harry as well, because he mouthed
“Can I, er, have a moment with your son?” Harry asked sheepishly. He didn’t know exactly what he wanted to say, but a part of him was afraid that Draco would somehow get it to his head that he had to handle everything himself, and then piss right back off to Italy to be miserable by himself, leaving Harry behind, without as much as saying goodbye. Even now, Draco seemed reluctant, and frankly, disinterested, in having a chat with Harry.
Harry had too many questions that he wanted answered quickly, but only after Malfoy would find his way out – what was he doing here anyway? Unfortunately, it seemed that the tosser had noticed Harry’s movements, “You know, there is a very fascinating quiz here according to which I have the perfect qualities to be the famous Harry Potter’s dream girl.”
Malfoy scoffed and looked down, shaking his head. “You know it’s only a rumour, right? It’s not like you’ll actually get good luck,” Malfoy’s remark lacked the sarcasm it would’ve taken to convince Harry he didn’t want to do it.
case, as if the Malfoy family was once again the centre of the bloody universe. It was also a nice touch to insult him in the middle of the statement as to remind Harry that no matter how badly Malfoy needed him he would never respect him. What an absolute arse. Then there was one more thing that Harry had to point out.
After lunch that day, Harry headed for the Carkitt Market just off of Diagon Alley to get groceries, real ones for once, not instant magic meals. The weather was quite beautiful, though rather cold, and the market was full of wizarding folk going about their business. Harry felt refreshed being out and about among the regular people, and not either hunched up in his office or at his house.
Lately though, Harry had been sleeping much better than he used to. He hadn’t had a single nightmare in what was nearing to be three months already. Though now his dreams were filled with visions of a tall blond git, be it just flashes of his hair, or him mumbling Harry’s name. Sometimes the dreams were memories, sometimes Harry dreamt that he heard a demanding knock at his door, and sometimes, though most rarely, he dreamt a conversation. Nothing special, just the two of them talking, laughing. After those dreams, Harry usually just stayed in his bed, trying to remember as much as he could. Occasionally, when he felt like it was all too much, he rolled over in his bed to occupy the place where the man had once lied, all those months ago, and tried to imagine he was still there.
“Oh yeah,” Harry agreed, “he was a fraud through and through,” he nodded. Only after a few seconds, he noticed the weird look Malfoy was giving him, as if he was trying to evaluate if Harry knew something he didn’t. And Harry did. “He told me and Ron that in the Chamber of Secrets,” he specified, realizing that there was simply no way of explaining it and not make it sound completely mad, “he threatened to Obliviate us, like all the other people whose stories he stole to sell his books.” Every sentence he added to the story made it sound more like a fever dream, so he decided not to add that after, he had to fight an enormous basilisk controlled by a piece of Voldemort’s soul hidden in a journal slipped into Hogwarts by Draco’s own father, or the fact that he almost died from the snake’s venom only to be saved by Dumbledore’s magical phoenix Fawkes who had also brought him the Sorting Hat with Godric Gryffindor’s sword in it.
“Eventually, though I must admit there were some horrid turns there,” Malfoy grimaced, still staring at the tulips on the ground a short distance away from where they were sitting. Horrid turns?
so many times that when she let go, Harry’s face was completely red with embarrassment. He didn’t know how to respond, but Narcissa didn’t seem to be expecting him to, and turned to follow McGallon, who gently guided her inside the cell.
Malfoy looked at the fireplace for a moment, looking in thought, like he was trying to decide something for himself, and then turned to Harry again. “Try me, I’m in a good mood today,” he declared. Malfoy in a good mood? This was a rare occurrence Harry had never encountered. Why was the man in a good mood? Because he was leaving? Maybe Harry had caught him in the middle of packing.
Now Malfoy’s face scrunched up in distaste. “Forcing? How sexy of you, Potter,” he spat out, perhaps attempting to be teasing, but there was no trace of glee in his voice. Now he gave Harry a cold look before he swiftly walked out of the room and started heading towards the stairs. His socked feet made no sound in the hallway.
Permission slips were now flying about the Ministry in herds. Every move that wasn’t strictly a day-to-day routine had to be signed off by someone else. It felt as though anything more drastic than going to the bathroom was monitored. ‘There can be no side steps’, Kingsley had announced in the weekly internal newsletter, probably not realizing that the system he had implemented was probably doing him more foul than good.
The hooded person moved their gloved hands on their hood and lowered it slowly. The witch’s black and silver hair caught the dim light of the alley, and her face was white with terror. There were dark circles under her eyes and she looked starved, she was merely a shadow of the woman Harry knew from all those years ago. Needless to say, Narcissa Malfoy had seen better days.
Kingsley let out a very long sigh, before nodding and turning to Harry. “Fine, you’ve convinced me, but don’t take it as any kind of indication that I am to be manipulated this way in the future,” Kingsley stated very sternly and returned back to sit at his desk.
I urge you to trust yourself and yourself only, when it comes to ensuring the health of any sexual acts. This has been a PSA. Happy wizarding!
Harry could feel himself blushing slightly, although that could have been the wine, and the fact that it was quite warm in the house, “Thanks, er… so what’s he like then?”
“So,” Hermione started finally, clearing her throat, “I assume that this is about your dad, Draco?” she looked a tad disturbed at the situation, but didn’t fall back into silence, “When I read about it in the paper I couldn’t believe my eyes, it’s horribly vile, what they’re doing.”
Ginny shrugged and moved back to staring into the mid-distance, “He’s nice… smart, funny, you’d like him I think.”
“Relax old man,” Malfoy retorted and returned the quill to his pocket, “just give me a second.” Then he turned around and marched through the curtain to the busy hallway, leaving Harry scratching his beard and swinging his legs over the side of the bed. Once he was out of the hospital, he would never return there again, not before he was certain that it was a Malfoy-free zone. He didn’t welcome these new thoughts that his brain was generating at full speed.
Now Harry turned to his side and stared at the wall. Was it going to be like this the whole time? Excruciatingly polite and distant, only sharing a moment or two, before Harry had to leave. This wasn’t how he had imagined the trip to go. He had pretty much assumed that the scales were going to be tipped on one side or the other when they first saw each other. But there he was, still not sure where he was standing with Malfoy. The man had taken him on a date, and wrapped him in one of the most intense snogs Harry had ever experienced, and then let him slip away, just like that. Harry had tried to sleep, figure it out in the morning, but his heart was racing, and his limbs felt burning hot.
“Homenum Revelio,” Twigs whispered and raised his wand a few inches, “there’s someone on the first floor but that’s it.” Harry and Crooker nodded and the three of them carefully made their way up, trying to make as little sound as possible. The stairs creaked under their boots in the otherwise silent establishment, and Harry had a bad feeling that whoever was in the first floor wasn’t going to like them being there.
Now he gave the git the politest smile he could muster. “Malfoy, fancy seeing you here, what brings you to the Ministry?” Harry had to step aside as Malfoy stormed into his office, white hair only lazily combed back, black robes dramatically flailing behind him as he turned to face Harry, who was now closing the door behind him. Harry was preparing to draw out his wand at any moment.
When they had all Apparated there fifteen minutes ago, Harry had felt the need to apologise to them for having to come into work at such a time on a weekend. “Are you kidding? We all want these maggots caught, don’t worry about it boss,” Blackburn had said and everyone was nodding in agreement, Patrick had squeezed his shoulder in support. Harry had smiled at all of them before saying “Right, positions then.”
After the lady had left, Harry raised his eyebrows at Malfoy, who shrugged defensively. “I have a sweet tooth, what about it?”
Now Harry determinedly sat up on the sofa, he wouldn’t give up that easily. They had at least gotten an audience with the board, and that was already something. “No,” se said, “we’ll come up with something, I know we will, we have to.” His mind went back to searching for possible reasons for the Ministry to exempt Lucius. Had he ever done anything that even resembled anything good or unselfish? Donating some brooms to the Hogwarts Quidditch team hardly counted. If there was one thing Harry thought might count was the fact that Lucius had not fought alongside Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts, but rather, huddled up with his family in some distant corner. Granted not the noblest move, but at least he didn’t side with the Death Eaters in the very end.
Harry gave a deep sigh, trying his best to make Malfoy feel even a little less shit. “You’re too hard on yourself, everyone’s moved on,” he said gently, and didn’t stop caressing Malfoy’s shoulder, moving his hand up to his hairline, “besides it’s only like, half your fault anyway, what with your dad being a right dick.” Lucius Malfoy was probably one of the most cowardice and vile people Harry had ever known, and Draco was unfortunate enough to have landed him as a dad.
Malfoy cleared his throat. “There are certain things I wish I could bring with me,” the man asserted, and the look he gave Harry while saying it sent a powerful shiver down his spine. Did he mean he wished he could bring
“Good, good,” Harry replied, nodding. He didn’t know how to continue, even with how things were, he probably didn’t want to learn more about this new boyfriend. Thankfully, Ginny seemed to have picked up on that, but then followed it up with a much worse question.

Harry could feel the blood leave his face when he saw the cover – it was Krum on a broom, flying around a Quidditch pitch. Aradia picked up a copy and presented it to Harry, on the back, Krum was smiling like the teenage heartthrob he had been. Harry cringed and made sure to never mention this to Hermione, and certainly not to Ron.
This had been three years ago, and Harry had steadily managed to get himself and Ron in on bigger cases until they had finally been able to answer calls themselves. Perhaps Harry had gotten too confident… no, not perhaps, he had
“How did he seem?” Hermione inquired carefully, “It must have been awful for him to see both his parents go to Azkaban, and his childhood home closed forever.” Ron made a muffled sound that sounded something like
Now Lucius looked like he had just eaten a vomit-flavoured Every Flavour Bean. “I am aware, and would prefer to spend the time I have left
Some twenty minutes later Harry Apparated onto a quiet street. The weather had cooled down from the previous day, but a warm breeze was pampering London, and was now messing up Harry’s hair, he was glad he selected for a lighter cloak. All of the houses on that street were behind tall hedges, so that from the road one could only see the upper floor and the roof of a building. It was dead silent, and Harry’s boots made a light sound against the pavement.
“But seriously,” the man said between kisses, “I come back after ten bloody years, and you have the audacity to not look at least a little bit worse than you did before,” as he was talking, Draco was planting kisses on Harry’s lips, his face, his neck… he was running his fingers on Harry’s sides and back, “I mean, how on earth am I supposed to resist
For these reasons and others, Harry couldn’t bring himself to ask anyone on a date, even though he did sneak an occasional peek of a butt at the gym. Once he had been caught by a blond bloke who had just smiled and winked at Harry from behind his weights.
That evening, Harry left the Malfoy residence, not with a peaceful mind, but with a stormy one, now gripping another piece of parchment in his hand. Only this time, it was Draco Malfoy’s address in Tuscany.
Harry wanted to act offended about the quip directed at him, mostly because it was true, but then something more provocative dawned on him, and a self-satisfied grin spread on Harry’s face. “So why’d you want to look nice here, then, huh Malfoy? Aren’t you just here for work?”
Harry smiled, and it was quiet for a while. It was quite a comfortable silence, but of course, Harry had to go ahead and blurt out: “So, why’d you ask me on a date?” He had asked the question before he could stop himself.
by the wizarding community,” Malfoy was frowning at his pint, and Harry did feel a tiny stab of pity for him. It must not have been easy being him, at least lately.
Evergrey seemed to think along the same lines, but thankfully held his tongue. “Good, went to fly for a bit with the family in the Quidditch pitch outside the city, they open it to the public for a few hours every Saturday, you can rent a broom there so… yeah… how about your weekend?”
“Right, right, I can imagine,” Harry just nodded without having a clue what else to say about the subject. Clearly Isabel was a woman of business sense, she seemed very pleasant, and seemed to make George happy, so Harry was happy for him. He didn’t feel jealous of them at all. Not in the slightest.
They stayed that for a bit. When they parted, letting to reluctantly, Harry saw Malfoy hastily wipe away tears from his face. He hadn’t realized the man had been crying, but didn't dare to mention it. Instead, Harry collapsed on the sofa, exhausted. “How’s your mum?” he asked. He imagined her to be quite distraught, she looked she had been crying the whole morning, and frankly Harry was quite bewildered by the fact that Malfoy was now here, at his place, instead of at home comforting his mum.
“Well… thanks, heh,” was the only thing Harry could say while still being fully convinced that he was utterly fucked with ever convincing anyone to date him. He ran his hand through his hair awkwardly.
“So you’re happy to leave then?” Harry inquired. He hadn't meant to sound like he was interrogating the man, he was just presenting an honest question, to which he wished to receive an honest answer. He started to feel calmer noticing that Malfoy was engaging in conversation, and didn’t have one foot out the door anymore.
“I’m glad these dinners are only a few times a year… let me tell you… this baby would come out plump as an Erumpent,” Hermione was leaning back in her chair, eyes closed, legs stretched out.
“I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to ask,” Buckthorn was rubbing his chin thoughtfully, but eventually conjured another one of the damned permission slips in his hand and handed it to Harry, “it does take a month to brew, though.”
As soon as they had started to make their way to Malfoy’s place, they found themselves climbing uphill at every turn. They walked through dark, narrow alleys, and deserted squares. It seemed that everyone was gathered at the centre to dine, and the further from it they got, the sparser the bars grew. They were walking on a sideways street towards the sea, when Malfoy opened his mouth: “So what do you know about our schoolmates? What are they doing these days?”
Harry took a seat at his desk at the back of the room and motioned Malfoy to sit down on the chair next to the table. The git gave a look of distaste at the space, and then a more suspicious glance at the desk next to Harry. “That Weasley?” he asked, and inspected the table with such distrust that Harry was about to tell him that desks at the Ministry weren’t in the habit of devouring the employees.
Now it was just the pair of them, standing in the corridor. Draco stepped closer to Harry, and raised a hand to gently tangle in his hair, rubbing his scalp. They were very close, the gap between them almost invisible. Harry could feel Draco warm breath on his cheek, but didn’t think it the best time to start snogging him, so he raised his hand on Draco’s waist and rubbed his side. “No matter which way this goes,” Draco said quietly, “I just want to say thanks… for doing this, for helping my family, you know how much they mean to me.”
Patrick snorted like he thought it was a joke. Soon enough he realized that there wasn’t a glimpse of humour in Harry’s face, and cleared his throat. “Excuse me, I’m a what now?” he asked, dumbfounded. Harry didn’t really know what Patrick had been expecting, since he was Harry’s right-hand man after all. Naturally there always had to be someone in charge, especially now that Kingsley was imposing all these absurd rules on everyone at the Ministry.
“Because he didn’t fight alongside Voldemort? Or because he did?” he pressed, his jaw was clenched. Harry stiffly leaned back in his chair, thinking back to all of the times Lucius could’ve helped him, but didn’t. Even in the Battle of Hogwarts when he abandoned Voldemort’s agenda, he hid away with his family, letting people on both sides die. Malfoy was right, his father was a coward.
It took Harry a second to process what achievement Ginny might be referring to, before he remembered the autobiography Aradia Horntail had displayed him, “Merlin, are you talking about that book?” he grimaced and made Ginny snicker.
Harry half expected Lucius to throw a fit, to somehow break out his chains and hex Harry dead, but he just looked perplexed, though suspicious. “Involved? What does that mean, involved?”
“Almost?” Harry heard the question escaping his mouth before he could control it. Who was it that didn’t support the proposal?
,” Malfoy rolled his eyes and then returned his bored gaze back to Harry. No matter how dreadfully he was behaving at the moment, somehow Harry felt like the git was overplaying his manner, not that he hadn’t always been a right bastard, but somehow the situation felt ingenuine.
“Fancy a swim?” Malfoy asked, already taking his shoes off, and walking past Harry towards where the sounds of the sea were coming from. Harry shrugged at no one and followed Malfoy, casting Lumos as to not step on anything suspicious, like a sea urchin drifted to the shore. The lights of the promenade illuminated Malfoy’s now naked back. He had already pulled his shirt over his head, and was now unbuttoning his pants. Harry followed suit, and they left their clothes a safe distance away from the water. They were both wading in the waves in their pants, the water still as warm as during the day.
“Er, yes,” Harry confirmed. He wanted to know Malfoy, wanted to know the man he already fancied for some Merlin forsaken reason.
, I feel… confused,” he shook his head and looked away, “I don’t know what I want. I guess I’m here to find out. I didn’t think you’d be stupid enough to actually agree.”
,” his hair shifting in the dark room, which signalled Harry that he man was looking up at him again. “To tell you the truth, I haven’t got the faintest clue of what’s going on,” his voice was low.
like that. Malfoy looked positively pained at having to be in this position, which invariably raised the question, why had he come?
“What is it Harry?” Now Hermione seemed truly worried. She reached over the table to give Harry’s hand a comforting brush. This was exactly why Harry hadn't told her, she always treated her friends’ problems as her own, and as heartfelt as it was, Harry never wanted to burden anybody.
“Morning,” Malfoy answered vaguely, and gave Harry a suspicious glance, maybe he was onto his plot, or maybe he was unbelieving that Harry was actually that interested in his schedule. His hair was turned golden by the evening sunlight shining through the window above the door, giving him a brilliant glow. Harry was sure he would never be tired of looking at Malfoy, it seemed that he looked different every time they saw each other nowadays.
“Not exactly,” the man muttered, and looked even unhappier than before, if possible. His eyes had gone darker and the corner of his mouth was twitching.
The next paragraph already changed the subject, and Harry, with his shaky hands, was left wanting to know more. What mistake? Was he talking about them sleeping together? Because if it was so, Harry would hope the ground to swallow him at any moment now. But he did say ‘for the second time already’, what was he referring to? Why did have to be so cryptic, even in letters to his own mum? Harry checked the date, it was a few days after Malfoy had left England, and it still didn’t quell his anxiety about the time that had already passed.
. He tried to ignore how fast his heart was beating, a flush once again spreading to his face. But he was glad for the switch in setting and dynamic – he wasn’t at St Mungo’s, being treated by Malfoy. No. This time the git had come to him.
“Even after meeting my father again?” Draco asked instead, a look of hesitation spreading over his face.
Fortunately, Malfoy started taking off his robe and unbuttoning the jacket underneath. He dropped them on the ground and ran his long fingers through his hair. Harry wet his lips at the sight. “Right, Potter, escort me to your bedroom.”
“Harry, I… was just fetching some water,” Malfoy stammered, like he had been caught doing something. He didn’t have a glass with him. He was eyeing Harry sceptically, as if he was evaluating whether he bought the explanation.
“Excuse me,” Kingsley’s deep voice said, “you said you’re doing what now?” He had stood up from his chair behind the large desk in his office, his reading glasses propped up on his forehead, still holding some papers in his hand, more squeezing them now, really. It was the first Friday of July, and after having his insightful chat with Narcissa the day before, Harry had gone home and started packing, with a newfound sense of purpose. That morning he had marched straight into Kingsley’s office to announce that he was going away on a holiday, even though to him, it felt much more like a crusade.
“Very much,” Harry replied, keeping his eyes sternly at Malfoy and reached to brush the hair from his face. The man made an expression that signalled that he was simultaneously amused and put off by the mawkish comment, but kept looking at Harry. He extended his arm to caress Harry’s spine, and Harry carefully pulled the blanket downwards, placing his hand on Draco’s hot skin, on his side, then on his inner thigh. That’s when he’d noticed that the man had had a raging hard on.
