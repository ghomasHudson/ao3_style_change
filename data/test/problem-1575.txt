Draco blinks, and Harry's hand appears in front of him. He swallows hard and makes the split-second decision to take it.
"For bringing you here," Harry replies. Draco focuses on a particularly tough section of his steak, staying quiet. "I forgot about our sixth year."
Still, he doesn't have a freaking memory to use.
The words take a second to register in Draco's mind, but once they do, they spread throughout his body like a balm, instantly calming him. He turns to Harry, still sitting at his side. Harry's grin reaches his eyes, and it makes Draco's good feeling spread. He wants to go to Harry, and hug him, and place his face in his neck, and breathe him in hard.
"He," Draco corrects, and the single word feels daunting and scary and it feels like he just changed his life.
Of course Harry is testifying, just like he said he would, the noble dick.
Harry beams at him and then waves at the Malfoys and turns to go. After watching his retreating back leave the room, Draco turns back to his mother. His mother is still watching the place where Harry was standing, her eyebrows raised, and her eyes wide.
it," Draco admits. He learned it, sure, but teaching is different than learning it.
"Great!" Draco says, probably being overly excited, but what else is he supposed to say?
good.
And doesn't that just break Draco's brain?
"No," he makes himself say. He has a number of rude things to tell her, but instead he keeps his mouth shut. Honestly, she didn't do anything to warrant him being rude to her.
Harry knows about Draco's crush. He
"Doyouwanttogooutwithme?" he blurts out, all very fast and all one word.
"So let's keep talking about it!" Draco exclaims, throwing down his knife and fork and looking up at Harry. Anger is coursing through him and he should probably just accept the apology and ask not to talk about it and
Except, now, does it even matter? Everyone in the Wizarding World knows their names, yes, but as Death Eaters. The family that supported the Dark Lord. They're going to have a bad reputation anyway, no matter what they dress like.
"It might make things easier. It'll give me maybe an idea of what happy memory we can use and then we can practice after," he responds. Draco looks away from him, and he nods.
"For dressing up as a Dementor to try and scare you. I was a dumb kid and I —" Draco doesn't know what to say because every excuse he has seems fake. He honestly doesn't know why he did it, or why he did the dozen other things he did to harass Harry and his friends. "I don't know why I did that."
When Draco thinks about it, it's actually quite insane. There's no way that him and Harry should've ended up together. It just doesn't make sense. But still, somehow, Draco thinks that they were meant to be.
dreams? — because he thinks he would've remembered it happening in real life.
"That…" Harry says, cutting through the silence. Draco averts his eyes, because he doesn't want or need Harry's pity. "That
His parents have a trial date? He didn't even know that they were having a trial at all. Is it because they were Death Eaters? Is he going to be expected to have a trial? He wasn't told he was going to have a trial. Are his parents going to Azkaban? Is he going to be able to keep on living in his parents' manor?
"I think that's enough for you, today," Harry says, and Draco's chest is still heaving a bit, so he agrees with a nod.
to Draco. Well, that's —
Draco lets out a breath that he didn't realize he had been holding. Something settles in him, a feeling of hopelessness that has been living within him for the past year. It's how he felt, especially, when he was at home. There were Dementors all around his house at all times; they came with the Dark Lord.
is introducing Harry to his mother? They both know each other, honestly. Plus, Draco doesn't
"You ready?" Draco asks, brandishing his wand. If this is their last lesson, he wants to give it his all. He owes Harry that, at least. Harry nods. "
," Draco says, showing Harry his Dark Mark in all its terrible glory.
And then he laughs a little bit more. And he's probably freaking Harry out, just a little bit, but he can't stop laughing. He laughs until his ribs hurt, and he has to double over.
His mother's trial is first, and Draco makes his mind go blank. He doesn't want to know about all of the bad things his mother did, and frankly, he doesn't care. What does catch his attention, though, is when Harry himself goes to testify. To Draco's shock, Harry tells the judges about how Draco's mother saved his life — when he went to the Forest to confront the Dark Lord, Harry pretended to be dead in front of the Death Eaters, and Draco's mom went along with the lie.

Laughing, Draco combed a hand through his hair. “Nothing, yet. It shouldn't be too long, though. He's a helpful bloke. We were roommates, at uni, and he was constantly helping me with the nuances of Muggle culture.”
“No, no. Just the two of us, Teddy, and Scorpius.”
“Hello. I’m Sarah, and this is my son, Jamie.”
It was a simple piece, not something one would expect to pass through the hands of royalty. Frankly, it seemed at odds with the era of its purported origins. The golden chain was intricately woven, a thick plait that seemed to curl in on itself like a mass of writing snakes. That pattern continued, tapering and wrapping around the metal plate that held the stone to frame it in a fine gilt rope. The stone itself was small, unlike its more extravagant counterparts, a mere chip of blood red by comparison.
“Enough. Just, put a stop to this. Now, get out of my office.”
"Nott," he smiled, holding out a hand to shake. "What brings you here?"
"What happened?" Pansy demanded, hurrying to Draco's side.
If the necklace was real, it would be much older and worth much more than the listed value. Draco still needed to get down to the Ministry’s archives, but he doubted he would find anything there, either. It was likely that the necklace, and its myth, were strictly a Muggle phenomenon. What that necklace had to do with a cheap, wooden mobile, though, was anyone’s guess.
“Alright,” Harry said. “What are you waiting for, then? Go grab your kit and let's get to it!”
The bed dipped beside him and an arm came around his shoulders. "He's perfectly fine, Draco."
I nodded, still a bit overwhelmed by Teddy’s neverending enthusiasm. Harry and Draco got a sad look in their eyes, though they smiled brightly. They were worried about me, I knew. I still wasn't eating much and I didn't speak often. But I loved them—I still do—so I smiled as big as I could, nodding emphatically.
“Yes, yes. Up.”
“Well, that's nice. That boy works too hard.” Sliding him a knowing smirk, she lifted an eyebrow. “Things are going well between you two, then?”
Draco pulled his arm from Hermione’s grasp, crossed the distance between himself and Creevey, and drew his wand, levelling it at the bastard’s nose. “You did this,” he said again, his voice hollow, his limbs numb.
Thank you for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
“I suppose you’d rather I fetched food while you filled out the Sullivan report, would you?” Harry challenged, finishing with a flourish and sending Ron a cheeky grin. “Now, what is it today?”
"I've given this a lot of thought, and… I-I'd like you to call me Draco, p-please."
"He's not even born yet, you fucking imbecile," he ground out, only to be met with more laughter.
Draco glared, but took another bite. Grinning, Potter turned back to the detective, something Martin, and Draco turned to gaze longingly at the shop he couldn’t enter. Not until he finished the sandwich; he had no intention of contaminating a crime scene.
Harry obliged, chuckling, and watched Draco march from the room. He had time to convince him, and lunch would be a good opportunity for some wheedling. It was still a win.
“So,” Harry asked, turning to face him. “What was the hurry, yesterday?”
"Oh, you know. Come to watch a good friend marry an idiot."
Chewing thoughtfully, he considered the list of items stolen. There had to be a connection between them, they were too specific. If one wanted to go for highest value… well, they’d never rob a charity shop, would they? Especially after two antique shops. Not to mention that stolen antiques were difficult to move, regardless of value. If they were exceptionally rare, maybe, but these were considerably less than.
“Is the Leaky Cauldron the only place you know how to find?”
“Oh, I'm sorry grandma.” Contrite, Teddy lowered himself to his seat, again. “Please, may I be excused?”
Chuckling, Harry took his hand and led him through the Floo.
"Draco."
“I couldn’t have put it better, myself, Potter,” he drawled, as if Harry hadn't spoken to him directly. Sweeping into the room, he bent over the desk, snagged one of Harry’s chips - one that looked particularly crispy and delicious - and popped it into his mouth.
With a weary sigh, he pushed through the door, blinking as his eyes adjusted to the dim, windowless room within. There were rows of racks of hanging clothes and aisles of all manner of wares; bedding, furniture, toys, knick knacks. Everywhere he looked, merchandise fell over itself in a mad, disorienting jumble that reminded him of many of the shops in Diagon Alley. Spotting the men and women gathered against the back wall, Draco made his way toward them. Four uniformed police officers, a woman, and a boy of about fourteen, stood just outside the nearest aisle while a team collected forensic evidence within.
Harry watched Draco go, a confused little frown slowly morphing until a lopsided grin replaced it. It was anyone's guess whether Draco remembered their lunch plans for tomorrow or simply forgot it was Friday, but he was perfectly happy with either, as Draco clearly expected to see him. That was more than enough for Harry.
Harry flashed a grin, sure Ron was rolling his eyes. “Oh, right.”
“Yes, but he doesn’t.” A fact Harry worried about more often than he might like.
"Harry, what are you doing down here? Pansy's waiting for you!"
“Yes, you may. And
(See the end of the chapter for
Laughing, Draco left and Harry smiled, watching him go.
“Thank you, no.” A light flush coloured Draco's cheeks as he tucked a few wayward strands of hair behind one ear with his free hand. “Don't worry, Potter, I promise to eat, okay?”
When it came, it was worse than Draco could have expected: murder Dumbledore or lose his parents and his life. He had no great love for the man, but… murder? His doubts must have shown on his face.
A wave of pain surged through him and Draco finally spoke through gritted teeth. "I was there, Potter. I fucking heard her."
This was his favourite time of day.
Scorpius squealed in delight, reaching for Harry from Draco's arms. The two men laughed, using their proximity as Draco passed him over, for an excuse to share a kiss that only became more beautiful every time I saw it. At my side, finally taller than me—though not by much—Teddy danced excitedly.
"Malfoy, you're safe. Pomfrey said--"
"Father, please…"
“That's right,” Draco agreed, nodding solemnly as he poured chips onto Scorpius’ tray. “The entrance is hidden.”
A quick exam later, Hagrid spoke. "Better fetch Pomfrey, 'arry."
"What more is there to do?" Draco asked, swiping the shiny green apple off the antique vanity and polishing it on his robes. "Hair, make up, robes. It's all done."
Not for the first time since Harry and Draco told me they wanted to take me home, to give me a home, I stared in awe at the little family. My family.
“Do you have to do that?” Ron hissed, falling back to walk alongside him.
The first article about the robberies caught Draco’s attention immediately: Mysterious Break-In! The Only Item Stolen: A Necklace Rumoured to Possess Magical Properties. It was bunk, obviously, but he did the research anyway, while waiting for Robards to act.
“No!” he cried. “Harry! It was supposed to be you, Malfoy!”
"Calm? It's my wedding day, Pans! This wasn't supposed to happen!"
As he and his friends retreated from the compartment and Weasley's blasted rat, Draco vowed he would make it up to Potter after he'd cooled down.
Antique tea set, china, gold filigree, circa 1890, valued at 650 pounds.
“So Ted,” Harry began after they'd ordered. “Are you excited for Hogwarts?”
Enraged, he turned back to Potter. "You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there." And he held out his hand, willing the boy to take it, take his side.
“Malfoy. Don't you have evidence to analyse?”
I lifted my arms, the smooth wood digging into my ribs and aching stomach as I leaned over the baby's cot, until I felt the sharp sickle of metal, heard the clinking of stars and moons as they collided. As carefully as I could, I detached the mobile and tucked it under my arm, the spider web of wooden beams flush against my side, then made my way back to the front of the shop. When I reached her side, she yanked the thing from my grasp, wrapped cold fingers around my wrist, and spun on her heel, dragging me along into the sickening darkness.
Narcissa frowned, lifting a hand to the pale curls trailing past her son's narrow shoulders. "Don't be absurd, darling. That's a boy's name."
“Yes, sir,” Draco intoned with a mocking salute.
“Well let's go, then.” With one last smile at Andromeda as Teddy hugged her goodbye, Harry shuffled him out into the corridor. “We'll pop over to mine and drop your stuff off,” he said. “Can't go to the cinema with a broomstick.”
“Not to worry. He's old enough to know better. You are awfully early, tonight,” she noted, continuing with her own dinner. “It was a good day?”
“Unfortunately. But, if you know about him, that eases my conscience some. I detest this subterfuge.”
“Ravenclaw,” they said, together, before dissolving into giggles at Teddy's exasperated expression.
“Good morning,” he panted, resting his forehead against Harry's.
In reality, it was a small warehouse; small by warehouse standards, at any rate. It felt small because of the haphazardly jumbled merchandise that seemed to close the space, especially in the dark. It was a charity shop, a place where people send an unwanted or outdated belonging when they harbour enough nostalgia to cringe at the idea of binning it, but not enough to keep it. And a place where those with too little money to buy what they want go to buy whatever they can get.
"The apple, I don't know. I thought he was choking on it, but I cleared his throat. Pansy, what do we do?"
"Oh, were we having a moment?" he asked, affecting a confused look before side-eyeing Draco with a cheeky grin. "Better call me Harry, then."
Now, it sounded vile, dripping with sarcasm and disdain. Now, Draco fought not to cringe at the sound of it.
Tired, silvery-grey eyes narrowed, and Draco tossed his head again, hitching the satchel onto his shoulder. “I’m sorry, Potter, I have plans tonight. Why don’t we schedule a time to discuss the case, during work hours?”
Thanks for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Draco!" Pansy cried. "Have you learned nothing?"
But Draco enjoyed teasing him. “I don't know, Edward. That's a pretty big responsibility. Are you sure you can handle it?”
"Alya, what have you done?"
With a small nod, Draco wandered away, leaving Potter to his own interviews.
"Good," Harry said, clapping him on the back just as Theo entered the room. "If you'll excuse me, one of the porters can see you to your room."
Taking the bag, Harry rolled his eyes. “You have a problem, mate.”
She, of course, was the epitome of perfection, as usual. Her long, elegant robes fell just right, her hair styled to compliment the long line of her throat, the sharp angles of her face. There was no one he'd rather have by his side as he married the man of his dreams.
Draco looked out through a window across the room, started. “Is it that time already?” The sun beat down outside, casting short shadows and forcing the passing people to remove any heavy robes under its onslaught. Summer was definitely still in full swing.
Chuckling, they rose and filed out of the office. The sense of camaraderie wasn’t lost on Harry. Even Ron was sliding amused glances at Draco. When they reached the corridor that branched, taking them in different directions, Draco paused, still smiling.
“No, Weaselbee, he couldn’t. This one’s more complicated.”
“Lunch,” Ron called, striding through the open door, into the office he and Harry shared. Without looking up, Harry grunted his reply. His report was nearly done and, regardless of the appetising scents wafting from the takeaway bag Ron carried, he intended to finish it. “Well isn’t that a fine way to greet your best mate? Who came bearing lunch, mind you.”
And Potter smirked. "Well, that's a good place to start."
“Fish and chips!” Ron confirmed, bowing low and holding the bag out to Harry.
The garden at the Burrow was resplendent, everything in full bloom, the afternoon sunlight trickling through the leaves of the overhanging trees. There were folding chairs in neat lines starting at the house and marching forward to the end of the garden where, on a platform built just for the occasion, an ornate coffin of metal and glass lay. Around the coffin, the Weasley children and Hermione Granger stood like sentinels, guarding him, mourning him. Ron was the first to break ranks, falling forward to run a hand along the lid of the coffin, tears streaming down his reddened face.
The article detailed the highlights of the case, Harry and Draco's testimony, that of the other members of Harry's "Official Fanclub," and the pensive memory of the interview with Creevey, himself.
Thank you for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Teddy raised his invisible wand, still gigging, then stilled. “I can't remember the countercurse,” he said, looking to Draco for help.
“Harry!” Draco exclaimed. Somehow, in his haste, he'd forgotten the man's habit of shooing him home after work. Beaming up at him, he stood up a little straighter to peck a chaste kiss to his lips before pulling away and continuing, backward, down the corridor. “Sorry, I have to dash. I need to get to the public owlery before they close.”
Nothing happened. There was no swirl of light, no gasp of breath, no twitch of muscle. His last chance.
Harry winced, fully aware of his own influence. “Sorry, I didn't think.”
Slipping his hands into his pockets, he strolled toward the lift, whistling. That encounter had taken up less time than expected, so he was content to meander all the way to the Floo banks and through, and he was still grinning as he stepped into Andromeda’s receiving room.
Try as he might, Draco couldn't stop the warmth spreading through his chest, tingling in his fingertips. Flipping the takeaway tray open, he settled into his chair with his lunch and the stack of records.
Draco started, whipping around in his chair to face his mother. The house elf beside him dropped her kitchen shears and scrambled for cover.
“It's not,” Harry assured him and Draco jolted when he felt a warm hand on his thigh. “Andi just wants to get it done as soon as possible.”
“Okay, thank you,” he said, discreetly shrugging Potter’s hand away and passing him the pad. “This is Agent Potter, he’ll take over.”
“And you checked the security cameras?” Draco asked, his gaze sweeping across the ceiling and taking in the four devices, one in each corner. “How did you determine what was stolen?”
“Everything is fine, I just need to post a letter to a colleague. I'll tell you about it tomorrow.”
“I’m working that case,” Draco answered. He seemed poised to continue, but frowned when Robards lifted a hand.
Casting a glance to where he and Weasley were interviewing the detective on the case, Draco scowled again. That could only mean Potter didn’t finish his own lunch, the prat. Which, in turn, meant Draco was obliged to eat the blasted sandwich. Just then, Potter turned, narrowing his eyes. He flicked them down and back to Draco’s, pointedly.
Checking his charms, he pasted a broad smile on his face, turned on his heel, and Apparated from the rocky outcropping to the other side of the cove, quickly slipping in amongst the crowd and making his way through the house. He had work to do.
“Of course you can. I never said otherwise.” Without giving him a chance to retort, Harry took Teddy's hand and made his way to the counter.
Draco pressed a hand over his mouth to cease the flow of convincing arguments and smiled up at Harry. “I'd love to,” he murmured, then pressed a chaste kiss to his cheek.
Later, when they stood side by side, reciting their vows, exchanging rings, it was never clearer: nothing could touch them, take what they had, what they were. And, when they kissed, the whole wizarding world cheered.
When he left the parlour, he found Harry and Teddy in the middle of the Alley, arms raising invisible wands in an imaginary duel. Holding Scorpius close as he yawned hugely and his head nodded to Draco's shoulder, he watched, allowing the warmth to spread and his heart to clench.
“You aren't an Auror, Malfoy.”
Leaning back, Draco frowned. “Shit, what time is it?” His eyes flew to the clock on the opposite wall, and his face fell when he saw his name wobbling dangerously over LATE. “Fuck!”
It was a fine morning in late spring that found Draco Malfoy on the streets of Muggle London, sipping his coffee and staring up at the small shop front. Over the years since Hogwarts, he had become accustomed to the din and bustle of Muggle cities, so could easily ignore the automobiles rushing by behind him. They were of little importance, after all, in the face of the puzzle occupying his mind.
The baby in his arms began to fuss, so Draco sobered, but still greeted his son with a smile as he looked down and began rocking him.
“Maybe we’ll get to be on the Quidditch team like Harry was when he was a first year!”
"Draco," the Dark Lord said icily, and Draco was reminded of the first time he'd heard himself referred to by that name. The pride he'd felt when he saw his Hogwarts letter. The joy when McGonagall called out his name at the Sorting.
“You’re a twat.” Chuckling, Harry tore off a bit of fish, swiping it through the vinegar soaking the bottom of his newspaper, and brought it to his lips, then paused when he glanced past Ron. Standing in the doorway of the office was Draco Malfoy, his arms folded over his chest and frowning disapprovingly as he looked down his long, straight nose at them. “Hello gorgeous,” he said, grinning when Draco frowned.
Draco seemed to respond subconsciously, leaning away even as he nodded. “Fine, Potter, but you’re buying.”
“Wait, don’t tell me. Fish and chips?”
“What's happened?” Harry called after him, looking a little dazed, still standing in place in front of the door to Draco's lab. “Is everything okay?”
Draco cried out into the cold night air, his pain ringing through the silence of the grounds. He couldn't do this alone. He knew he couldn't, but he was too far from the castle and his salvation…
“Potter! Weasley! Get in here, I haven’t got all day!” Robards boomed.
With one last sip from the paper cup, Draco dropped it into a nearby bin, tucked his hands into his pockets, and turned on his heel. He stopped to remove the disillusionment charm before striding into the Ministry, bypassing his normal route to the laboratory on the sixth floor, and headed straight to the office of Gawain Robards on floor two.
"Hagrid!" a voice shouted near him and, suddenly, the heat of another body seeped into his as hands lifted Draco.
“Oh?”
“Fine,” he said, picking up his quill to indicate Draco's dismissal. “I'll send a team of Aurors to investigate. In the meantime, I need you in your lab, so get there.”
Digging out another sheet of parchment, Robards handed one to each of them. “You’re cleared to use a Confundus, if necessary, but your cover story should suffice.”
“I-it was okay,” Dennis stammered, a shy smile splitting his narrow face.
Chuckling, Potter rubbed rapidly at Draco's shoulder, then stood and paced a short distance away. "I was wondering that, myself."
While she primped and preened him, Draco tossed the apple lightly from hand to hand, the only outward sign of his own nervousness. He didn’t have anything to be nervous about, of course. He was marrying the man of his dreams, the love of his life, one of his best friends, and all of those things you get when you marry the right person. He knew, without a doubt, that this was exactly what he wanted, what Harry wanted. Any doubts he might have had were put easily to rest with the way Harry had broken every curse his alleged fan club had cast.
“Sure, it is. Just ask ‘Mione. She never asks me to do the shopping list anymore.” Lounging in his chair with a wink, Ron swallowed and shoved three more chips into his mouth, grinning.
Draco narrowed his eyes, but gave a curt nod. “Very well, Potter, but let's not make a habit of it. I can pay for myself.”
A thought had been running through Draco’s mind for almost a week, one he didn’t dare to hope could be true. But now, as he stood over Harry, on the day he was meant to say goodbye, it was his last chance. The last moment and, if it worked… No, he couldn’t hope. Instead, he leaned down, laid his lips on Harry’s, and sighed.
“Oh, thank goodness,” she sighed, dropping a hand to the table dramatically. “I will never understand why Draco insisted on keeping his son a secret.”
"Like us," Harry said with a nod. Leaning forward, he captured Draco's lips in a warm, slow kiss. "Okay, get out of here so I can finish getting ready."
"It's Malfoy," Potter said in awe. "Wha-- what's happened to him?"
Sighing, he started toward the ridiculous pair and lifted an eyebrow—Harry was lying on the ground and flopping like a fish out of water. At the unasked question, Harry widened his eyes and flopped more erratically, mumbling a frantic plea through sealed lips.
For Muggles.
Sweeping his robes aside, he perched himself on the edge of Robards’ stiff, wooden guest chairs. The man did not like guests, Draco learned. Him, least of all. Armed with that knowledge, he crossed one leg over the other and stared until Robards deemed the easiest route was to request elaboration.
Aiming his wand at the nearest puddle, Harry vanished the water before turning to the latest arrival.
In fact, the only reason it was in that dingy shop to begin with was that the bumbling idiot who ran the shop didn’t realise what he had. His inventory photo was recognised when the necklace was stolen, ensuring the case was firmly in the public eye.
“What would anyone want with all of this?” Ron asked.
He nodded to the man's secretary, gave a sharp knock on the door to his office, and stepped back to wait, arranging his features into a hard mask for the impending encounter. Before long, a barked “What?” could be heard, so Draco turned the handle, marching into the office.
“I’m just saying, he’s a grown man, Harry.” When he turned his attention back to Ron, he was also scowling at the back of Draco’s head, though Harry was sure his thoughts weren’t as kind. “He should be taking care of himself. It isn’t your job to feed him, and you wouldn’t bother if it wasn’t for your obsessive need to help people.”
Committed to his role, Harry let out a muffled shriek and flailed about some more. So Draco took pity on him. Lifting a hand in a casual wave, he called over his shoulder, “
He was past believing that everything he did would incite untoward gossip in the
“That wasn't a plate,” Harry argued, smirking.
Book of fairy tales, antique, circa 1550, inscribed, valued at 200,000 galleons.
There was no doubt in his mind that he was in love. Foolish as falling for the saviour of the wizarding world was, he'd expected no less in dealing with Harry Potter. Nothing about him was easy, nothing ever had been. From his first stirrings, at the Yule Ball in fourth year, Draco had known he was irrevocably fucked.
“Draco?” a voice above him asked, and he froze. “Baby, what’s wrong?”
“I not sure, either. But it's his decision, isn't it?”
“Well? What is it?” he finally growled, tossing his quill to the desk and folding his arms over his rotund chest.
Draco was nearing the end of his patience. Twenty minutes to dress the boy and by the time Draco was dressed, another ten minutes later, Scorpius’ shoes were on the floor and his shirt was in the process of following, dropped by little hands over the guardrails of his cot.
I turned back to the room, loathe to upset her further. She had quite the temper and I knew from experience what would happen if I dawdled. Picking carefully around the merchandise, I made my way to the back of the shop. We’d cased the building the day before, and a few days before that, so I would know where to go, where my objective lay. Trailing a hand along one shelf to keep my balance and remain oriented, I walked down the aisle, careful to keep my footsteps light. When I felt the shelf end, I moved to the other side of the aisle, arms outstretched until they knocked against smooth wood. That was my goal. Well, above that was my goal.
Robards scowled at him, but didn't comment on the informal pose. “Someone is using magic to rob Muggle shops.” he began, jumping right into Head Auror mode. “Scotland Yard just had their third break-in, no evidence of forced entry, no clues as to why, and all that was stolen was an old mobile.” Shuffling through a stack of parchment, he pushed a sheet across the desk, hard gaze landing on each man in turn. Ron lifted it first, scanned the contents, then passed it to Draco.
“I did check the cameras, yes. Only, I can’t afford the kind with night vision, so you can’t see nobody, and nobody says nothing. But you can hear them moving about, and a grunt when they trip over the ottoman.”
Hermione rushed into the room with Pansy on her heels. "What's— oh! I'll get a healer!" Hermione cried, then rushed back out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco barely heard him. After he was satisfied his son had all of his limbs intact, he hunched over him and sobbed. Potter was right, he was beautiful. His tiny hands curled into wrinkled fists, his eyes sealed in sleep, a small tuft of white blond hair standing wild on his head.
“I can't wait, Alexi! This is going to be great! We’ll both be sorted into Ravenclaw and we’ll do everything together!”
“That's right.”
“Well,” Harry sighed, pushing to his feet. “What are we waiting for?” He smiled when Draco stole another chip, then gestured toward the door and waited for Ron to rise, as well, before following.
“I’m working here, Draco. Merlin, can’t you wait?”
Luckily, he knew one.
Hermione reappeared, gently guiding his shaking hand down, even as his eyes continued to burn into the pale green of Dennis Creevey’s. “You’re going to prison,” he snarled. “Was it worth killing someone you claim to love?”
A chime was echoing through the house, announcing his arrival, and Harry followed it out into the corridor. They would still be in the middle of dinner, so he took his time reaching the dining room. When he entered, it was to an exasperated eye roll from Andromeda and a vibrating, teal-with-black-tips headed Teddy.
“Well, that’s his own fault, isn’t it? He could prise himself away from his bloody potions for ten minutes to eat something.”
His coughing intensified, his face darkening with the effort, his hand reaching up to loosen his tie. Draco was on his feet in a moment, rushing to help, wand in hand. He cast a series of spells to clear his airway, calm a cough, then conjured a glass and cast an Aguamenti to fill it.
Draco watched him go, frowning in confusion, before charming his own pile of records to float along behind him as he made his way back to his lab. As expected, Harry had dropped by with lunch—chicken tikka masala—and left a scrap of parchment with a cheeky “Couldn't find you. Hope you haven't fainted from hunger” in his ridiculous chicken scratch handwriting.
"I'm," Draco began, then paused and inhaled deeply through his nose. "I'm a bloody mess. Maybe I'll tell you about it sometime."
With that, he turned and jogged the remaining distance to the lift.
“Of course. I'm sure you'll sort it out, Harry.”
Some bloke claimed, two hundred years ago, that the necklace was magical. Nothing he read, though, indicated quite what kind of magic it possessed. But that wasn’t enough for Muggles to disbelieve the claim. It amassed quite the history, passing from hand to hand, disappearing and reappearing over time, even passing through the hands of the royal family, on occasion.
“I'm ready!” Teddy called, barrelling back into the dining room. His backpack was slung over one shoulder, the Wolverine badge winking into view, and he carried his broomstick in the other hand.
"Hey, I'm telling Draco you called him an idiot," Harry said, grinning as Theo closed the distance between them for a quick hug.
“Call me Harry,” he insisted. He shot Draco a warm smile before turning to address the shopkeeper.
Stepping carefully, Harry moved into the room, slipping his hands into his pockets. When he stood just behind Draco, he bent over him and said, in a low voice, “Are you aware that everyone else has left for the evening?”
Lifting him from the cot, Draco sat on his bed to shove the shoes back onto squirming feet. After another nappy change and considerably more squirming, they were finally on their way.
“It's okay, Draco,” Teddy assured him, slipping a small hand in his. “Babies love that stuff. Ron does it to Rose all the time, and she's way littler than Scorpius.”
“Ten minutes?” Ron groaned, but Harry nodded, lifting a hand to Draco's shoulder.
“And you let him eat off your plate? You don't let anyone do that!”
“And miss lunch, again?” Draco asked, amusement twinkling in his eyes and twitching around the corner of his mouth.
Ron flinched, his face paling, slightly. “Oh, don't I know it. What do you see in that skinny twat? He's not even ga-”
Teddy giggled, doubling over. “I used a full body bind,” he explained. “Harry can't move.”
When Draco next woke, he wasn't sure exactly where he was. It was only after a few moments that he could even recall the events of the night. Springing up in bed, he felt around wildly, first his stomach, then the bed beside him. It was another panicked moment before he looked up to find Potter sitting at his bedside, Draco's child curled in his arms, asleep.
“Of course, but you should probably ask Harry. It's his weekend.”
“Wait,” Harry said, catching his hand as he passed. “Have dinner with me.”
“Well, it's settled then, isn't it?” Harry asked, clipping a crooked finger over the pudgy, drool dampened chin and averting the boy's attention to himself.
“Muggle-born?”
Mother had insisted they have their robes custom made and had gone directly to the designer with their ideal robe ideas. The results were magical.
“We're here for you, Alexi,” Harry promised, kneeling beside me. Scorpius babbled, reaching out toward me and I took his hand, gently.
In the foyer, Harry greeted guests as they arrived. He knew it wasn’t his job, but these were his friends and family. Every living Weasley was in attendance, as well as the Grangers, the Malfoys, Andromeda and Teddy, and countless friends from school and work. It was already shaping up to be a massive party, he thought as George chased Ginny through the door and out onto the beach, Blaise following at a more sedate pace. Many of his friends' children had been permitted to swim for a while before the ceremony, so little puddles of water turned the tile floors into a maze of landmines.
“That's fine,” Harry assured him. “Take your time, I'm early.” Ruffling the boy's hair as he passed, he bent to kiss Andromeda’s cheek, sharing her tired smile. “How are things, Andi?” he asked, settling into the seat between them as Teddy returned to his remaining mash and roasted vegetables.
With that, she took his arm and dragged him up the stairs, leading him down the corridor to his dressing room. Which was across the corridor from Draco's. Hesitating outside, Harry shot Hermione a grin, holding up one finger to indicate he needed a moment.
"Is it true?" he asked, ignoring the redhead for the time being. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter is in this compartment. So it's you, isn't it?"
Comb and brush set, silver, circa 1927, valued at 200 pounds.
Celeste chuckled, getting into bed. “Cuddle me. And no letting it

Poppy rolled her eyes. “We all do it, get used to the idea. Is your morning sickness completely gone, Dear?” She asked Harry.
Harry chuckled. “I don’t think Blaise is going to agree. Ever.”
*throws chapter and runs, shouting "I'm sorry!!"*
Draco began moving again, faster this time, purposefully working to bring Harry off. He had no idea what had prompted the sudden decision to engage in exhibitionism, but he was going to take the opportunity while he had it.
As soon as she was out the door, Harry turned to Draco, wrapping his arms around the blonde’s waist, and claiming Draco’s mouth hungrily.

Harry turned to face him, brushing his hair. “Yeah?” He asked.

Draco sighed. “Just try not to make that a habit, alright?”
“What?” Harry asked.
“Well, I can’t hurt you while you’re carrying my child, but I

Harry frowned. “Well, why not?” He asked. “It’s not because I’m a Gryffindor, or anything like that, is it?”

Draco smirked. “I think I can handle it.”
Celeste nodded. “I need

Pansy’s eyebrow nearly hit her hairline. “You'll

Draco glanced back. “Did it sound like one? You tell me, Golden Boy!” He shot back, then laughed, doing a few loop-the-loops and then going into a steep dive. He pulled up at the last second, but his toes caught on the ground, and his concentration was broken as he hit the ground with his hip and skidded a good three meters on his side.
“Have you come into your powers yet? You haven’t felt anything weird yet, have you?” Draco asked curiously.
“So if we weren't soul-bound, I wouldn’t be able to share your room?” She asked hesitantly. “What about Narcissa? You said you've been here

now, you tosser!” Harry screamed, throwing another bottle, shampoo this time. He screamed incoherently as Draco dodged the bottles and retreated.
Harry just smiled and took Draco’s hand, leading the teen into Gryffindor tower, closing the portrait behind them and sitting with him on the couch.
Harry glared at him.
Ginny glanced over at Draco, who sneered at her, though it looked forced. “Yeah, about that. Why’s he even here? It’s not
! He levitated me and dropped me in the lake—”
Draco huffed, then stalked out of the room, heading down to the Quidditch pitch alone. He stood in the center, then unfurled his wings, slowly flapping then, getting a feel for how they moved.
“Goody. First order of business, then. Shower’s over. Get dressed and you can give me a piggy-back ride to the dungeons.”
Draco made a pleased noise from behind him and pressed a chaste kiss to the nape of his neck. “Good. I’ll be by your side the entire time. You and Delphini have nothing to fear with me there. Even if things go completely pear-shaped.” He added lightly.
, but he believed that Harry could afford to fund the research, since he hadn't told Severus to stop looking for a way.
Pansy, Millicent and Blaise were waiting for them outside their door. Harry flushed a bit when he found them there, but he let them look him and Draco over until their eyes fell on the bonding marks and they all nodded, Pansy and Millicent grinning.
Potter would be
Harry pulled out of their kiss, placing small kisses along Draco’s jaw and the top of his neck, then he looked Draco straight in the eyes, intently. “Merlin, Draco…” Harry licked his lips, searching for the words, then he finally found them. “Te iubesc.” (I love you.) He said wonderingly, then smiled brightly. “Te iubesc.” He happily repeated, tightening his hold on Draco.
Madam Pomfrey came into the room with a large black bag. “No one needs to be scared, this is perfectly timed. Celeste, your body clearly knows what it is doing.” She sterilized her hands and vanished Celeste’s underclothes and rucked up the nightie. “Let’s see what’s going on here.”
Draco groaned. And there was the Weaslette. A lover’s spat. What were they doing at Hogwarts in the beginning of June? They’d only spent a week at home.
Thanks for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
“I was planning on it,” Harry said, then remembered. “Oh, and you're coming to the pub this weekend, right?”
“I missed lunch again?” Draco asked, sighing. “Potter will have my arse.” Rising, he gathered a few records and set them in a stack before Flemm. “Is it alright if I take some of these up to the lab?”
“Ah. Yes, of course.” Nodding, he shook himself. He was having lunch, not facing a firing squad. He needed to relax. “What house do you think you'll be in then, Teddy?” he asked, ignoring Harry's smug look at the use of the nickname.
Standing, Draco walked slowly to the coffin, facing each Weasley in turn, nodding his thanks and condolences in one, reticent motion. Several of them reached out, clasping his hand tightly, as if they could convey everything with the gesture. And, when he thought he could bear it, Draco looked down.
So, it’s clichéd, I know, and it’s well past the beginning of my own story, which I have long since forgotten, but it’s where this story begins nonetheless. In a dark, musty room that felt much smaller than it was.
Draco grit his teeth and fought the urge to lift his head and meet those mad eyes. To fight like he hadn't needed to in nearly five years. At his side, his father cowered, a shell of the man Draco had always thought him to be. He wasn't nearly so intimidating like this.
"Help!" he screamed, frantically tugging at Harry's robes. "Someone help! Harry? Harry, come on. Not today, this can't happen today!"
“Your handwriting isn’t worse than mine,” Harry said, frowning.

“No, no,” Taking her wrist, he urged her back into her seat. “I'm fine, I'll get something at the cinema.”
“‘Course. You just be sure I get them back.”
"My name is Draco, Mother!"
“A week,” Hermione answered.
“Not on my watch!” Harry paused, smirking, and leaned over the desk. “How about during lunch?”
Draco sighed. "I'm really not. I'm sorry; you never had the chance to see who I am. I never gave you the chance to see who I am."
We all know how the most captivating stories begin: in a dark room, with a mysterious figure doing something of questionable legality.
beside the kitchen.” Their food arrived and just as he said that and his eyes lit up at the sight, pulling laughter from Draco and Harry.
Although, frankly, he was more impressed Harry seemed to understand that. He never even tried to take Draco's hand again. He walked close, their elbows and shoulders brushing, but Harry seemed to pay close attention to Teddy's ongoing enthusiasm, which had switched to Quidditch at some point. That was, until he leaned over to murmur in Draco's ear.
“It's our weekend,” Harry said, frowning at him. “And of course we can, Teddy.”
“Yes, but theories and hunches don’t go into reports, do they?”
“I need to gather my supplies. You finish your lunch and I’ll meet you in the atrium in ten minutes.”
“A pleasure to meet you.” He nodded to Jamie, then pulled out a slim pad of paper and a pen from his pocket and watched Sarah, expectantly. “Could you tell me about the break-in?”
“I've some money in the nappy bag, Harry, if you don't mind settling our bill while I change Scorpius.”
“Again.”
Thanks for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
With Teddy close on their heels and babbling about X-Men, they made their way out into the gardens to Apparate to Diagon Alley in pairs. The litany of childhood joy resumed the moment Draco set foot on the bustling street and he nodded along, utterly ignorant of anything the boy was actually saying.
"Alya--"
(See the end of the chapter for
Glancing up at Potter, Draco froze. Potter was staring at him with the most intense look he'd ever seen on the man. His hair falling forward over his glasses and casting a shadow that didn't touch the brightness of his eyes, razor sharp on Draco.
Thanks for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
He stopped for a moment to compose himself. Lucius had failed to force him to "fix" his hair, so it had been trimmed into a neat cut and he'd styled it that morning, before they left for the train. It lay flat and sleek against his scalp, the pale strands held in place by his favorite hair tonic, just as it had when he'd met the boy in Madam Malkin's.
“Oh, not you, too,” Harry groaned.
"But you're
"You really should try to sleep more, you know", Theodore commented. "We have to wake up early..."

"Yeah... but you deserved it that time, Malfoy", he pointed out. "Talking about our moms like that... You were an asshole."
Ginny had been giving him angry glares ever since breakfast time and Harry had no clue what to do. Even if he couldn't always see her angry looks, he could feel them. He didn't know if Ginny wanted him to apologize or if she wanted to be left alone, and to tell the truth, Harry wasn't sure if he even wanted to apologize to her. His thoughts were mainly on someone else.
skipped the breakfast, even if he barely ate. There was something wrong.
Ron rolled his eyes. ”I was just asking if you still need that book? My essay is far from ready.”
"I never wanted to hurt you, Ginny, I swear!" he said, devastated. "I do care about you."
he repeated questioningly.
An hour passed and so did other customers, but Harry was still sitting on the same spot, deep inside his thoughts.
"Damn", Ron sighed. "I wish it was Friday already..."
to sleep. And then, one night, Harry didn't come home at all.
While speaking, Harry had surreptitiously moved himself so close to Draco that their bodies were pressed tightly against each other and Draco could feel the hard bulge in Harry's crotch pressing against his own.
Minutes passed and he was still deep in his thoughts when he suddenly heard Malfoy closing his book and getting up from his chair. Harry opened his eyes slowly. His gaze followed the Slytherin walking past him to the bookshelf and turning sideways to Harry, clearly looking for something.
needed some time alone.
"Well, there's two of us loners then", Harry said. "I don't have a family at all, and now I can't go to the Burrow either, so..."
"...See? This one here... What does it say? Doesn't make any sense to me", Malfoy continued, pointing at the middle left corner of the parchment.
"I'm so sorry, Draco... If I had known...", Harry said sadly. He took a step closer to Draco, moving his hands up to cup his cheeks and caress his pale, teary face with his fingers. "I've been a terrible boyfriend. I was so stressed, so caught up with work that I neglected you..."
He was kissing the Slytherin's throat now, inhaling the beautiful scent of his skin and moving his hand on the blond's cock at the same time. Draco kept whining desperately under him.
", Draco had commented, his eyes following Harry's hands closely.
Soon Harry was standing in front of his and Ron's door. He was already holding the doorknob in his hand, but he found his eyes instead fixating to another door, not that far away from theirs.
"Of course not", Ron said.
"I also cast a Silencing Charm every night because of my nightmares", Malfoy continued, breaking the eye contact. "Your dirty little secret is safe."
Ron let out another exasperated sigh.
be. There was
"Oh..." Ginny's face brightened to a smile and her cheeks flushed. "Really?"
However, as the night went on and they'd had some more drinks, they were able to find something to talk about after all. At one point Harry was very surprised to see Ron, Goyle and Malfoy all discussing about Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes that was owned by Ron's big brother George, and Harry felt glad that they were able to talk like civilized people, even though they had quite a history behind them. He really hadn't imagined that Ron would be able to do that, simply because Ron had always hated Malfoy even more than Harry and that told a lot, but there they were now, talking.
And just like that they found themselves at the Three Broomsticks later that evening. The inn was very crowded because it was Saturday, but they were still able to find a free table.
Harry returned to eating, forking a piece of bacon to his mouth. He lifted his gaze back to his friends, only to see Hermione's brown eyes still observing him.
"Potter?" he heard the Slytherin's voice again. This time, instead of fretful, his voice was different and calming. Harry lowered his hands, finally facing the other man's stare. Malfoy was beckoning for him to join him on the couch. "Come here."
Harry's fingers gripped Draco's silky hair as they were kissing each other passionately. He could smell the delicious, alluring scent of the other man's cologne, he could feel the other man's perfect body against him, he could feel his heart almost exploding in his chest... He had never felt desire like this before.
It didn't take long before they had changed the position so that Harry was now lying on his back, facing Draco, and their pace was already harder as well. The Slytherin kept pounding into Harry madly by now, the stormy grey eyes boring deep into his own emerald ones, and Harry held onto him tightly, his fingernails sinking deep into the flesh of the other man's back.
Harry nodded. "I am", he whispered back, slowly lifting his gaze.
"Listen, Malfoy, I'm trying to finish my essay here", Harry said, sending a glare at the other man.
someone else to do those things to him. Someone who just wasn't there with them at the moment. Come to think of it, why
to take you shopping. You look really good, Harry", Hermione said and Harry thanked her. "How have you gotten along with him?" she added.
"Yes you are", Malfoy snarled. "Sod off."
Harry stood up, strode to their dorm corridor and straight to the bathroom, vomiting. He was feeling so sick right now, sick of jealousy. He could imagine Malfoy in Theodore's arms, kissing him passionately... The thought was killing him.
Harry let go of Draco's hand and moved his hand up to caress his platinum hair instead, just looking at him for a long while.
His eyes automatically travelled through the Great Hall, this time meeting Draco's intense glare. To make the matters worse, Draco wasn't the only one looking at him and Ginny. All of Draco's friends were watching him too, including Theodore. At the moment Harry almost wished to punch Ginny for making the things even more difficult than they had already been.
Though Harry was far from a shy, blushing person, he couldn't help but to feel a little nervous at the moment, and he kept absentmindedly playing with his messy hair in between his fingers, feeling Malfoy's eyes resting on him again. Was it because he had been caught in action or was it for some other reason that he was not aware of? Harry felt a tiny amount of hope rising in him. Wait a minute, could it be possible that Malfoy was checking him out too? Could it?
"Love you, Draco", he heard Harry panting on top of him. "Love you so fucking much."
"What are you suggesting me to do then?" Draco asked quietly, looking at his friend with sad eyes.
Harry asked, slightly amused. "Really?"
"Greg, could I sleep on your couch tonight?" he asked thoughtfully.
"What is it?" Draco asked after seeing his face, coming closer to have a look.
Harry grimaced. "I didn't mean it like that", he said quickly. "But you have to admit that many of you are, so-"
say Theo wants it", Malfoy interrupted in a cold tone. "But I
"Of course it's allowed, Harry", Hermione said. "Just ignore Ron. He's just disappointed you're not coming and going to be with Malfoy instead. He's jealous."
Harry felt a knot in his stomach. No. He didn't want it to happen. Just thinking about it made him feel sick. Theodore was not right for Malfoy.
Draco Malfoy wanted to be taken by him, by Harry. He was definitely the luckiest man on the entire planet.
Harry shook his head. He took a few scoopfuls of meat stew and some roasted potatoes to his plate, digging in.
"Did you even knock?" Goyle asked, eyebrow raised curiously.
Harry was feeling very stressed. What the hell was he supposed to say?
lock it at night. I only changed the charm on it tonight so you could enter."
"Great", Malfoy said with a diabolic smile on his lips. "I'm going to
leave me alone, Potter!" He had lost his temper now.
"Harry! Harry! Wake up!"
His eyes turned to Theodore who was still standing at the same spot. Their eyes met and Theodore opened his mouth to speak, but before he got a word out of his mouth Harry had already attacked the man. He wasn't going to listen another word from Theodore or see another satisfied smile.
"Since
"Umm... Harry?" Hermione asked after they had finished laughing. "Does this make you and Malfoy... friends?"
"He won't take it well", Draco said, sighing. "He hates Harry, and to make the matters worse, he's expecting me to marry a pure blood witch and make sure that there will be more Malfoys and... well, Harry's a guy..."
as parents though? What kind of parents would the two of us even be?" Draco still wondered, shaking his head.
to Malfoy... They had hated each others for years and they still weren't exactly friends, but maybe he had been hoping for them to become something close to that.
Both of his friends turned to look at him. He had really scared them. And they were not the only people staring, they had already gained lots of inquisitive eyes on them, from all over the Great Hall. Even Malfoy was watching them, mouth slightly open, clearly enjoying the show.
to Harry's life, something that he couldn't quite explain to himself. And now it was just... gone.
"Let's just say that...", Malfoy started, now sounding quite tense. He began steering the new furnishings to right places. "...things have
Draco glanced at Harry and seeing the look on his face immediately stopped what he had been doing. Harry was panting, his body still shaking, his slightly opened eyes following as the Slytherin slowly moved closer again. Their eyes met.
She took Ron's hand in her own. Ron and his whole family had had a really rough summer because of Fred's death, but they were finally starting to get over it, though very slowly.
shouldn't wander around the village alone, not this late! Not anymore", Goyle pointed out. "Someone could-"
"What am I supposed to do then? What do you suggest?!" Malfoy grunted. "Because I don't know what the fuck am I supposed to do anymore!"
"She'll forgive you eventually", Hermione said, interrupting Harry's wandering thoughts.
day during the war. I heard about the dreadful plots against you... but I couldn't do anything. Then one day you were brought to the Manor and I was so afraid that you were gonna die, and... I wanted to save you, but... you know." His voice faded.
about you, I thought you were kidnapped or something. And then you arrive back, on afternoon, bragging that you've been clubbing, not even telling me with who, and you are wearing clothes like
Harry finally pulled back, licking at his swollen lips. "Turn around", he ordered.
Malfoy answered by moaning loudly, lifting his hips up against Harry's. Malfoy's hands were now working on his lower back, desperately trying to get rid off his pyjamas and underpants. The next thing Harry knew was that his rock hard member was already free and immediately grasped by the Slytherin's hand, making him gasp. Malfoy's long, thin fingers were firmly moving on his throbbing cock and he felt like he was losing his mind
"Do I look like I'm joking?" Draco asked, now sounding a bit irritated. "You kept harassing me through the game, flying so close to me and... wherever I looked I saw you. I don't know
"Draco, look at me", Harry said, feeling terribly guilty though he hadn't even actually done anything wrong. It had all been nothing but a huge misunderstanding, but he still felt guilty as hell.
He moved his hand up to caress the smooth pale skin of the Slytherin's cheek, and the other man pressed his face smiling against his hand. Harry instantly felt his stomach fluttering. Draco Malfoy naked in his arms... He would definitely not mind at all to wake up to a sight like this for the rest of his life.
"You don't know?" Malfoy repeated. "You don't know how it would make you feel?"
Theodore, who was once again sitting next to Malfoy, was looking straight at Harry, a strict look on his face and Harry, whose brain didn't seem to be fully working at the moment, found himself staring absentmindedly back to Theodore's dark eyes for a good long while before he realized what was happening. Shit! He startled, breaking the eyecontact as fast as he could. He turned his attention towards his lunch instead, feeling a lump in his throat.
"Nah ah ah, not gonna happen", Malfoy said, shaking his head. "We just rubbed our dicks together so sleeping in the same bed should be no problem."
small. Dean and I never had any problems fitting there, you know..."
"It says fang", Harry mumbled, his heart racing.
”You know?” he asked.
it." His voice was cracking.
Draco couldn't help but to chuckle at his success. "Well I did get a little help from Greg, Theo and Blaise", he admitted with a smirk. "They told me to teach you a lesson, and so I did."
Harry grinned. "Well, if you're going, bring me some fudge and... some chocolate wands?" he asked after pondering between different kind of treats for a while in his mind.
Once again there was some laughter in the hall.
"What do you mean, Harry?" she asked.
"I know it's too late to say this but...", he started. "I'm... sorry." Malfoy didn't turn to look at him. Instead he seemed to be staring blankly into space. "You're right for saying that I dragged you into this. I know I should have considered things more first but I didn't and... I really am sorry."
Harry had never considered himself as handsome. His hair had always been and still was a dishevelled mess. He didn't like shopping so he hardly ever bought new clothes to himself and because of that most of his clothes were already a little worn-out. He didn't have any fashion sense like Draco, and he didn't even have as many muscles to show like so many other young men his age. Not to forget that he had a weak eyesight so he also had to wear glasses, and of course he had an ugly scar on his forehead. So, what in the Merlin's name did Draco see in him, and especially why had the Slytherin had a crush on him since third grade, he would never know.
The sofa was starting to feel a bit too comfortable and Harry turned to his side, closing his eyes. He'd rest just for a while and then move to his bed, he thought to himself.
Malfoy was lying on his side next to him, face towards Harry, eyes resting on his face. "Care to share what's on your mind?" the Slytherin asked.
Harry, totally flustered, shook his head slowly. "Of course not", he said with a tiny smile on his lips.
It didn't take long before the Slytherin already cried out in pleasure, back arching as he came in between their bellies, shouting at Harry's name, once again, his whole body spasming uncontrollably.
"Mostly bad", Draco commented.
Malfoy nodded. "Tell me about it", he sighed.
But it was all fine.
it then", Ron said quietly, cheeks red. He was clearly nervous about everyone staring at them. "No need to freak out like that. Besides, you're the one who told us in the first place. You're the one who's been talking about them all the time..."
Goyle and Malfoy quickly glanced at each other. Malfoy wasn't able to hide his satisfied smile as he took another sip from his drink.
Greg didn't answer anything to Theo yet and Draco found himself just crying against his friend's shoulder, his whole body shaking, wetting Greg's shirt with tears. Greg's hands were gently, comfortingly caressing and tapping his back as Draco sobbed uncontrollably against him.
Suddenly Harry started feeling sick in so many different ways that he couldn't even decide which feeling was the worse of them all. His stomach was aching. His throat felt like he was being strangled. The food in front of him started to make him want to throw up...
He still couldn't believe he was going to spend his Christmas break with Malfoy, either. The most confusing thing was that he didn't even feel disappointed in not being able to spend Christmas at the Burrow anymore. No, he was happy to be with Malfoy instead of the Weasleys. Two forthcoming weeks, just the two of them, at his place... Damn, his stomach was tingling with excitement just thinking about it.
"Welcome to the family", Narcissa said to Harry and hugged him after her husband had moved to the side. Harry could see Lucius's mouth tightening to an even tighter line.
"And I'll always carry this one", Harry said quickly, stroking some of his messy hair off his forehead, revealing his own scar.
He felt a giant flash of guilt overflowing him. His eyes flew wide open.
This time it was Ginny who gathered some curious looks aimed towards her. She had really flown off the handle, although not as badly as Harry himself had yesterday.
"I know", Harry said with a sigh, resting his forehead against his hand on the table. "I wasn't expecting things to go this way either, but I know it's the right decision. Sorry, Ron."
Ron hissed back. "It
much. His eyes kept slowly going higher, still a little higher...
They spent an hour at the hospital, discussing school, their relationship, and of course Narcissa's health. Harry and Draco were glad to hear that Draco's mum was already doing a lot better and she would be ready to return home soon.
"Yeah", Harry admitted, grinning. "But at least he's having fun."
"Hah! Who's the best!" the Slytherin cheered.
"What is there to talk about anymore?" Malfoy asked tonelessly. "I thought you already said everything necessary last night, and today just confirmed it."
His fingers were caressing the silky platinum blond hair again. Feeling Malfoy's warm breath against his skin gave him shivers. He really cared about this man and tonight had been the best thing that had ever happened to him. Even though it had probably been just sex without feelings for Malfoy, to him it had meant everything, and the mere thought of having to let Malfoy go now was killing him inside. Just thinking of someone else getting to hold Malfoy like this in the future..
"Me too", Ginny said, letting out a small sob. "I really care about you Harry... A lot more than I probably should... I spent years waiting but... I don't
"But...", Harry started, glancing towards the door with a worried face. Everything was blurry because of his missing glasses.
"Draco?" Harry repeated, a little concerned, caressing the Slytherin's back gently with his fingers. "How long?"
"Yeah... You’re probably right", he muttered, absent-mindedly tapping his fingers against his glass. Did he even want to make up with Ginny anymore? He wasn't sure… At times he found himself missing her but then again…
Harry, however, wasn't really listening anymore. He had heard a door open a few seconds ago in the back of the room and had already turned towards that direction. Oh sweet mother of…
Draco's heart skipped a beat. He was staring at the other man, cheeks turning even redder than they already were after sex. "What?" he managed to ask.
Malfoy actually looked a little bit surprised at Harry’s suggestion. "Perhaps", he answered. "I don't think your girlfriend would be happy about it, though."
Harry's face darkened at the thought.
"But you did", Malfoy said. "What's done is done."
"Have a little trust in me, will you?!?!"
As the Christmas break came closer to an end, Harry and Draco visited Narcissa Malfoy together in the hospital. Narcissa was confused to see Harry Potter arriving with her son, and without any hesitation Draco told his mum about how things really were between him and Harry.
The room was soon filled with a lot of noise as he was thrusting in and out, first slowly and then harder, making love to Draco who turned out to be a really loud one in bed. At first Draco being so vocal confused Harry but in the end, after getting used to it, it only aroused him more. In Harry's dreams Draco had usually been a little shy but this was a lot better. It was intense and kinky, and Harry loved it.
Harry was left surprised. "I don't think I follow", he managed to say.
"I don't know. He
there was also Malfoy with him, coming in through the door right after his friend.
For the first time in his life Harry found himself crying silently in Draco's company, and Draco wasn't laughing at him. Instead of laughing, the Slytherin wrapped his arm around Harry's shoulder and simply held him close, comforting him.
He finally finds a series of books, all about Occlumency. Just what he wanted. He takes them all to his room, and he starts to read.
"Owl me, okay?" Harry says, and Draco doesn't know what else to do but nod. "I'd like to do this again."
"Professor Lupin," Harry replies, after a beat.
After taking several deep breaths, Draco decides that he's just going to ignore it and try to have a nice, normal dinner. With any luck, he won't have to talk to Rosmerta at all. With one last deep breath, he exits the bathroom. He spots Harry in a booth in a little corner of the pub and makes his way over to him quickly, a fake smile on his face.
. The delicate balance that they've built to be friends has been shattered by Draco's realization.
Which, of course, is exactly what Draco should
that he grew up with a lot more than other people, but it was still stressful, trying to live up to his parents' expectations. He rants about how he doesn't really feel any remorse that his father's in jail, and he hates that he doesn't care.
be a Gryffindor for one second, and realize what he's saying. He doesn't think he's capable of saying much more right now. Draco sees Harry's feet move, and in a moment, there's a finger under his chin and Draco's looking into Harry's green eyes.
"Here," he says, holding it out to Draco. Draco looks to see Harry offering him a bar of chocolate. "It's medicinal. Against Dementors." When Draco doesn't take it, Harry sighs. "It's stupid, I know, since we're not using a Dementor, but when I was learning, my… instructor… gave me a lot of chocolate, so."
mark, staring right back up at him. He's an
"Teach me how to conjure a Patronus."
Instead of saying anything productive — praise, happiness at Harry finally getting what he's been working so hard to do,
Despite himself, Draco can't help but soften at Harry's smile.
"You ready?" Harry asks. Draco nods, thinking about how soft Harry's hand is. In a moment, he's sucked into the still-unfamiliar darkness of Apparition. When he can see again, they're standing in front of an all-too-familiar building. Draco bites his tongue.
Draco looks back at Harry, and he doesn't like the pitying expression on his face. Draco doesn't like the conversation at all. Why did he want to learn something that is causing him to talk about his emotions? He really regrets it.
"You're not," Harry says, cutting Draco off. He looks adamant about it, and somehow that makes Draco angrier.
," Draco says, feeling anger fester up inside of him. "
After a few moments, his mother pulls away and squats down so she's looking up at Draco. She waits.
"Are you sure it's nothing?" Harry asks, all calm and collected. Draco's starting to wonder why he thought liking Harry was a good idea in the first place.
"Your father and I have gotten trial dates," she finally says, and Draco can't help the thoughts that pour into his head.
"I'm sorry," Harry says, once again. Draco wants to make him shut up. "I should've thought this through more. Maybe we don't work as more than friends but… Can we stay friends?" Harry asks, sounding hopeful. Draco makes himself nod, but that's just as painful. How is he supposed to just forget that he likes Harry as more than a friend? How is he supposed to just move on and just be friends with Harry?
"So, Occlumency," Potter says as they enter the Malfoys' study. Draco turns around to see him looking around at the walls of books. Draco raises his eyebrows.
There's not even a signature. Draco hesitates before responding — what if Harry's upset at him for some reason? — before figuring that Harry was probably just in a rush when he wrote the letter.
. He's a coward, really, when it comes down to it. Maybe, eventually, he could make himself to it, but not yet. Not now.
When Harry arrives, right as scheduled, the jitteriness doesn't stop. It's weird. But it's good.
His mother sits on the edge of his bed and runs her fingers through his hair. "It'll be okay," she whispers to him. Draco realizes that he hasn't even acknowledged her presence. He's been too busy freaking out. He appreciates her trying to comfort him, it just doesn't work.
too happy, he knows that, but for some reason, he can't make himself stop. "I like steak!"
With a small sigh, Draco's mother gingerly sits at the edge of his bed. She studies Draco's face, which probably doesn't have the happiest expression right now, and he waits for her to say something.
"Alright," he says instead, hoping none of his nerves shine through. Knowing his luck, they probably do.
Draco doesn't know when he sank to the ground, but he's staring at the floor of his father's study and breathing hard. The remnants of pain from nearly two years ago are still coursing through his body, and he can feel moisture slide down his cheek. He's not sure if it's sweat or tears, but he keeps his gaze away from Harry's and wipes it away with his sleeve.
"Of what?" Draco asks slowly. Harry hands the parchment over to him, and the top of the page says
how thick his voice sounds. His mother gets to him quickly, and Draco doesn't remember the last time he got a hug from his mother, but it feels
Draco's freaking out. Draco's been freaking out, ever since Harry told him that he had to have a trial. He had started freaking out when the words finished leaving Harry's mouth, he continued to freak out when Harry told him the date and what to do on the day, and the freaking out persisted even after Harry had reassured him that he was going to be fine. He had freaked out after Harry had left, and he had freaked out going to bed, and he had woken up freaking out, and now, two weeks later, the day of his trial, he's still freaking out. He doesn't know how to stop it.
He thinks his lack of an answer is one in itself.
"A dream," Draco says, looking down at the floor. "I
"Shut up," Draco says, standing up and brushing his pants off with his hands. His heart is beating so fast with the thought of him kissing Harry. It's like he can feel it on his lips, as if it were real. It's so
Harry comes over the next Thursday, as always, but it feels all wrong. Before they decided to ruin their friendship, it was easy to have Harry over. They didn't need to talk much, they just
There are a few things that Draco picks up on right away:
Harry. He hasn't had the thoughts to spare about his mother.
Harry finishes, and Draco fidgets in his seat when the judges say they need a minute to deliberate. He expects Harry to leave his seat, but a quick glance to his right tells Draco that Harry's still sitting there, looking as stressed as Draco feels.
"I made a list," he says, as Draco stares at him in astonishment.
"If he does," his mother says, "it's worth it."
"It depends on what you mean by avoiding," Draco replies curtly. His mother lets out a deep exhale and walks over to the kitchen table, into Draco's line of vision. Draco looks pointedly down at his coffee.
"Besides," Harry continues, and Draco realizes that he might be having his own bout of word vomit, "I almost killed you, which I think makes up for trying to humiliate me." Draco doesn't respond, because Draco doesn't even know what Harry's talking about. "In sixth year," Harry elaborates.
"Are we still on for Thursday?" Harry asks, wiping his hands on his pants. His mother clicks her tongue from beside Draco, but he ignores it.
Harry raises his wand. He hesitates, but Draco sees it and nods at him.
—" Draco says, and he feels like he doesn't really mean it, and he's afraid to complete the spell. It might not work. He wants it to work, so badly.
He tells them about him taking the Dark Mark when he was sixteen, and he wants to build up his walls so badly. He wants to say that he didn't really care about it, or that it was his choice or anything to save him the embarrassment of saying his true feelings. He knows, though, that it could be that the difference between him getting locked up and him going free.
"Nice that you can forget," Draco says before he can think about the words. He bites his tongue, his mouth feeling bitter.
"Do you want to talk about it?" his mother asks. There must be something showing on his face and Draco doesn't know what, because he's feeling about a million things at once, and he doesn't want to talk about any of them with his mother.
"Draco," Harry says, and Draco feels like his heart is going to beat out of his chest. That, or he's going to throw up. "Did you just ask me out on a date?"
And, instead of the blankness Draco expects to meet, he meets a memory. So maybe he's not the only one who's a little bit distracted. Harry didn't block him.
He's not sure if it's for the better.
he's so bad at teaching Occlumency — he had a bad teacher in the first place.
He thinks that he needs Harry to
He should probably be optimistic.
Harry stands up across from Draco and pulls out his wand. With just a slight hesitation, he exclaims, "
And humiliatingly, tears start to come out of his eyes.
"I don't know," Draco spits out bitterly, his eyes flying open.
Except, when Harry comes over on Thursday, right as scheduled, and Draco closes the door to his father's study, Harry announces, "I think I might have gotten it."
. Maybe it's an invasion of his privacy — no, it
"Maybe this doesn't work," Harry finishes.
"I love you," he says out loud. It doesn't matter that Harry can't hear him, because Draco will say it again and again when he's awake. Besides, Draco knows that Harry knows that truth through and through.
There's nothingness, for a moment, before Draco pulls away, breathing hard.
At the same time, Draco can't help but love Harry's lopsided little smile.
" he yells definitely. Silvery vapor shoots out from his wand, and he's so surprised at him actually doing something that he immediately drops it. Exhaustion runs through him, suddenly and he hunches over, breathing hard.
There's a hole in his stomach that feels like a Dementor sucked it out.
"Oh," Draco says.
"Yeah," Draco replies, trying to sound upbeat. He gives Harry the most real smile he can muster, and then, together, they walk into the Three Broomsticks.
And Draco doesn't know what to say to that. Somehow, he finds himself not caring. That's what makes him feel terrible. Not the fact that his friend broke up with his girlfriend that he's been dating for however long. He doesn't care about that, and somehow not caring makes it worse.
"Yeah," Draco says, pulling out his wand. He wonders if Harry also feels how
Draco wasn't expecting him to be that honest. It makes him feel a little bit grateful, because he might not have the best relationship with his parents, but he never had to hear them die.
"That was good," Harry says. When Draco looks back up at him, he's beaming. "I wouldn't expect you to produce a corporeal Patronus, but if you met a dementor, you'd be okay, with that."
Draco looks over at Harry, who's giving him a light smile. Draco drops his hand and he feels slightly sick.
There's a moment of hesitation, and then Harry leans in, pressing his lips to Draco's. Something inside of Draco bursts, and he can't remember ever feeling so giddy in his entire life.
Yeah, Draco's going to get rejected.
planning on that. He doesn't need any more attention than his family already gets. Him, a former Slytherin and Death Eater, being friends with Potter,
, but when they ask you what's wrong, you'll say that you're fine, just tired, because you
"Oh," Draco says, and oh Draco thinks, because the scars on his chest hurt again — or maybe that's his heart pounding. In the blur that was their sixth year, that detail seemed irrelevant. It's as faded as the scars on his body.
"I'm sorry," Harry says, and Draco sees that Harry looks upset.
. Which means, using this thought, and how he feels right now —
, seems so right as his best memory.
Or maybe he does. Because he was lonely, and he was jealous of Harry's friendships, genuine, not-bought friendships, and he was upset that he was rebuffed by Harry, and he was sick of his father telling him that he should've been friends with the Boy-Who-Lived.
A part of Draco hates that he's noticing the small things like that. Another part of Draco is just wondering if Harry is okay.
Draco doesn't remember getting dressed or going to the Ministry, but the next thing he knows, he's sitting in a chair in his best suit, with three dozen people staring down at him.
He says nothing.
like him that way, and he could stop talking to Harry and die sad and alone.
"What did you think about?" Draco asks, and he doesn't even think about if he's asking too personal of a question. He just knows that he wants to be able to do that.
Draco can't stop thinking about how he has a crush on Harry Potter.
Draco's ruined it. He can feel it, even without talking to Harry for another week. When Harry arrives at Draco's house, right on schedule, everything feels
, but
Abandoning his half-eaten breakfast, Draco gets up to get parchment, a quill, and ink to respond.
"You saved my life with it," Potter says, filling the open air with his words. His statement hangs in the air, lingering, before hitting Draco head on.
"Do you want to do more?" Draco offers. He's hoping that Harry says no, because he honestly doesn't want to
What is he supposed to do? Should he just go right back out to Harry and say he's sick and wants to go home? That seems too much like a cop-out, even to him. Should he tell Harry that, hey, the Three Broomsticks isn't really a great spot for a date for him because
Draco flinches again as all these thoughts run through his head. It's scaring himself how much he understood from that one question. Or maybe he's thinking too much into Harry's tone.
"You need to have a trial."
Draco hugs Harry back, and it feels so utterly natural to breathe him in, to wrap his arms around him tightly as if he never has to let go of him. It doesn't last as long as Draco would like, though, because all of a sudden, Harry jumps away from Draco quickly. His eyes fix on something behind Draco, and Draco whips around to come face to face with his mother.
"You've been avoiding me."
Instead of asking any of his questions, Draco just replies, "Okay."
, him and Harry kissing, to be
Harry lets out a little laugh, and it makes Draco's heart give a little leap.
"What?" Draco demands, furrowing his brows at her expression. She shakes her head and shrugs, but she still looks shocked.
Instead, he just writes
"Sorry," Harry says, standing up a little bit aways from Draco, breathing just as hard. "That was a dream."
like it to be real, though."
His mouth unsticks long enough for him to say, "Draco Malfoy."
Draco shuts his eyes tight, trying to think about anything else other than the situation he's in right now. When he opens his eyes, Harry is sitting in a chair near him.
A tear falls out of his eye, and his mother wipes it away with her thumb.
? He just had a trial, where he could've been sent to
His mother looks at him directly and Draco wants to shift away from her, to not look at her, but he forces himself to make cold, steely eye contact with her.
And Draco almost chokes on air. Potter, the Great and Noble Potter, is asking
"How did you do it?"
. It's unbefitting of him. "Mum, this is Harry."
"Please state your name," one of the people in the audience says, someone wearing long robes.
He doesn't really expect Potter to show up.
After what seems like hours, the head judge turns back to Draco, a whisper of a smile on her face.
," he says, and it sounds weak, even to him. Nothing comes out of his wand. He closes his eyes, and he doesn't see Harry walk over next to him, but he feels Harry push his arm down.
Trying to slow his heart down, Draco leaves the study to head towards the front. He wrenches open the door to see Potter standing there. Perfect Potter. Merlin.
. He wants it so bad, it's painful.
He knows it's his turn to be the teacher now, and he takes a second to slow his breathing and collect his thoughts.
Draco sees Harry out, and they share an awkward hug in the doorway that Draco can't help but hope will turn more natural in the future. The future… Once Harry is gone, Draco can't help but lean against the wall of his entrance hall, still not able to stop smiling.
"Only if you give me something in return," Draco says, each word like a creaky door.
"You know Occlumency," Potter says, speaking once again. Draco bites his tongue. Yes, he knows Occlumency. His bones still ache from learning it. He can still remember his Aunt Bellatrix shouting at him for getting it wrong. He can remember her wand in his face, her punishing him whenever he let something slip.
The person that Draco presumes is the head judge nods and writes something down as if they didn't know Draco's name. They ask him questions, and Draco really can't concentrate on what's being asked. His brain goes into autopilot, answering the questions without thinking. He tells the judges about his life and how he grew up around the Dark Arts.
"I don't really want to practice today," Harry says as Draco closes the study door behind him.
"Look, what are you feeling right now?" he asks, hoping that he isn't overstepping. Harry considers the question for a moment before shrugging and shaking his head. Draco's not sure if that means that he doesn't know or doesn't want to answer. Either way, Draco lets out a long sigh. "Okay, well, I'm feeling a little bit frustrated because you're not giving me much to work off of. I'm also happy, because I was able to produce at least a little Patronus, plus I —" Draco cuts himself off, because he was just about to admit to Harry that he's happy because they're together. Draco doesn't think that he's ready for that. "Because I'm not in Azkaban," he finishes quickly, hoping he's not blushing. He can also add embarrassed to his list of emotions. And then he pulls away.
"Does
"No, just
God, Draco wishes he could erase his past.
"Of course," he says after a moment, turning to Draco and giving him a little smile. He takes his hand out of his pocket and Draco was right — he's holding his wand. Draco flinches and shuts his eyes as Potter points it towards him. This is a ruse. Potter is going to kill him now. Draco braces himself to die, but Potter says, instead, "This is yours."
"I do," Harry rebuts, slowly, quietly. "You may have hurt me, but we were kids. I hurt you way more than teasing."
He has a new happy memory to use next time.
"You want to go out on a date with
Harry leans in, and their second kiss makes Draco's heart race and his head spin and it's every bit as perfect as their first kiss.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco sees Harry taking his father's vacant seat. He keeps his gaze straight ahead, though. He'd rather not make any conversation right now.
"I'm quite bad at Occlumency, to be honest. I'd like to get better."
He summed it up.
Harry shrugs and looks down at his shoes. Draco thinks that's fair.
, and this —" Draco gestures between them wildly, and Harry looks
. Instead, Draco keeps talking. "Let's keep talking about how
, he writes, and he ties the letter to the tawny owl to deliver it.
"I'll pick you up on Thursday?" Harry asks, and the way he's absolutely
"The concept is simple, but the act is hard," Harry says. "There are two different forms, a corporeal and an incorporeal. A corporeal is a fully formed Patronus, which is very difficult, so don't worry if it takes a while to conjure one." Harry starts pacing as he talks, and Draco stays still, following him with his eyes. "Now, the trick is that you have to think of a happy memory. One that's pure happiness." Harry finally pauses, and Draco blinks, digesting what Harry's said. "Would you like to try or would you like me to demonstrate?" he offers.
"We were kids," Harry says with a little shrug. "So."
His mother receives a fine, but no imprisonment.
"I'm still shit at that," Potter says, looking shaken too. Draco opens his mouth — he has so many
There's nothing. Draco's vision blinks out, and he's aware of Harry seeing what's happening in his mind. For a moment, his mind is blank, and Draco doesn't see anything.
"You don't have to do that," Draco says, holding out an arm to steady himself, even though he's already sitting. He feels slightly light-headed. This isn't what's supposed to happen. They're not supposed to be locked in an apologizing circle.
Slowly, Draco opens his eyes again and his mother is looking at him, probably trying to see what Draco's feeling, but Draco looks down at his lap.
He's over having to see Harry for their little classes, but he's already committed to it. Why should he have to be subjected to seeing Harry if they're not having one those?
After a few moments, Draco makes himself look up. He should cover the rest of the check and leave. It only takes him a few moments to count the Galleons Harry's left and Draco's stomach turns over.
"Just, think about your trial, and how it felt knowing that you're getting to go," he demands. "I saw your eyes when she said the verdict. I saw that you were
have to rub it in further?
get forgiveness. At the same time, though, he doesn't think he could do it. That's another thing Harry doesn't understand; not everyone is a brave Gryffindor who doesn't care about what could come of them doing something rash. Draco is
This letter is much shorter than the first. It just says four words:
He doesn't bother to sign it. He doesn't bother to see if his parents are going to be home.
And then it hits him like a ton of bricks that
"I know it's nothing fancy," Harry says with a shrug, still holding Draco's hand, "but I thought it'd be familiar so it'd be nice."
Harry grins at him and stands there and it takes a second for it to click in Draco's head that he's waiting for Draco to do the thing.
His father's trial seems to go faster than his mother's but Draco still doesn't pay attention. In the end, his father gets one year in Azkaban — in the new non-Dementor portion. The thought of his father going to prison at all makes his stomach flop. Still, when the courtroom clears and him and his mother are allowed to talk to his father, he doesn't know what to say.
"I —" Draco says, forcing his mouth open. He doesn't really know what to say. It was no big deal? It was a little bit of a big deal for Draco. He could've
"What?" Draco says, finally forming a full word. He's not sure that he heard Harry right. Potter, wanting Draco to teach him something. Isn't Perfect Potter perfect at
"Of course," Potter says, still staring forward.
He doesn't like the memories.
. It's pure, unadulterated
"Do you want to try?" Harry asks, and Draco wants to say no, but he nods instead.
"Draco?" Harry says, his voice soft and unsure, and Draco doesn't want to dwell on it.

He heard that his aunt died in the war. Theo had told him before Draco managed to shrug him off. Good. It feels weird to know that she's
On the third or fourth day, there's a knock on his door. Before he can say "come in" — or "go away", like he was planning on doing — his mother turns the knob and enters.
He doesn't get to use any of the methods he learned about in his books, but that's okay. By the time Harry leaves, they already make places to practice at the same time next week.
Merlin. What is he getting into?
His mother frowns again, and she makes her way over to his bed. Mentally, Draco prepares defenses to avoid any questions she might ask him. He doesn't really think that his mother would try and read his mind, but still. His mind goes blank. He doesn't want a long conversation about the war and about his feelings.
"I'm sorry," he says, sincere. "But that's true. It sucks." And now Harry looks guilty, which isn't what Draco wanted at all. He doesn't want Harry's guilt, or pity, or anything. "It doesn't matter now, anyway," he says, and suddenly his good mood is diminished. "I just don't really know how to teach it." Harry nods, and his guilty expression isn't gone, which Draco doesn't like.
Harry looks up at Draco, and there's uncertainty in his eyes. The look almost makes Draco want to laugh, but he doesn't. His mouth tastes bitter.
"Good, keep going," Harry encourages, and Draco braces himself. He thinks of the euphoria he had felt when the judge told him he was going to go free, and he thinks of the joy in Harry's eyes when he had heard the verdict.
Draco decides to not dwell on it. He has better things to dwell on, like Harry, and their upcoming lesson.
After the silence goes on for long enough for it to roar in Draco's ears, Harry finally whispers, "I forgave you for that a long time ago. If I held any burden, it would be too much for me. I'd like to be your friend, Draco. Not your enemy."
" A silver stag bursts out of the tip of his wand, and it gallops up to Draco before dissipating. It takes a second for Draco to remember to close his mouth.
Draco feels like he's trying to swallow a bag of marbles. Still, he owes Harry that. He at least owes an explanation of
. His parents aren't in Azkaban — yet — but Draco has
good to use. It's almost like everything is normal.
Harry makes a little hurt sound, and it hurts Draco to know that it's true. He knows that he probably should talk to Rosmerta and that if he does, he probably
"Er," Harry says, and Draco manages to sober up.
What news is bad enough that Harry had to come over to tell it to him in person? His mind immediately goes to the worst possible scenario. Harry doesn't want to do their lessons anymore. In fact, he never wanted to do them. He never wanted to be Draco's friend, and it was all some big joke on Draco. It's deserved; Draco spent too long taking the piss out of Harry, so it's about time he receives his comeuppance.
just tired. You're not fine, though.
He's on his back, breathing hard, the force of Harry's defense sending him backward.
, immediately looks like he's at ease.
Harry nods at Draco's mother, and his mother gives Harry a faint smile back.
It's scary to him, that he lost his grip on his emotions. They slammed into him in a way he hasn't let them since his fifth year.
it is between them. He doesn't particularly want to ask. A small part of his brain feels triumphant that Harry sounds hurt as well. That's what he deserves for turning the date sour in the first place, that part thinks. The larger part of his brain doesn't want Harry to hurt at all.
"So that's what you're not supposed to do," Draco finally says, wiping his face again and forcing a little chuckle as he looks up to face Harry. Harry's frowning at him, and Draco recognizes the concern, but he doesn't want to discuss it.
asked him to
"I was thinking we should practice with me again," Harry says, his voice sounding small. "To just make sure I can still do it, you know?"
Seeing Harry had thrown him off. Draco spends the next several days holed up in his bedroom, exiting only for necessities. He doesn't know why he's reacting in such a way. It's childish really — but that's exactly how Harry made him feel. Like he was a child again.
"Okay, so I had a Dementor to train against, but we don't have that, so we're just going to try without it. It'll be much harder when you're actually facing one, though, so keep that in mind," Harry says, and Draco feels a nervousness course throughout him. What if he sucks? He's going to suck. He's going to suck so bad and then Harry's going to turn around to Granger and Weasley and tell them how bad Draco sucks at everything, just like they thought he did.
Potter. He just said that he wasn't sure.
"Hi," Draco says, and he really

Draco's not sure if he'll follow up.
"How about you sit down?" he asks, lightly touching Harry's arm. "Order whatever you want for me, I trust you," Draco says, still trying to plaster on a smile. "I need to use the bathroom."
"How did you learn?" Harry asks, and it's a fair question. He must have a pretty dreadful expression, though, because Harry quickly adds on, "You don't have to answer that."
"Just say "
has Draco begin to smile and he can't believe Harry said yes.
Draco reads down the list, frowning.
chair — but he doesn't say anything. His father isn't here, after all. He would just never sit there himself.
Yeah, that method probably isn't the best way to teach someone how to do Occlumency.
"My aunt," he manages to say, and Harry's eyes flash with slight recognition. Still, he elaborates, "Bellatrix Lestrange. Who is my aunt. And the Death Eater. Yeah."
"Yeah, because
They're both in the Room of Hidden Things, except it's more the Room of Burned Things now. Scorched books are spread out around them, now-black pieces of wood are crumbling, and ash litters the ground. It's slightly sad, for Draco; this room has been his
"Hi," he says to Harry as he closes the door to the study.
Draco thinks about this, and he thinks about what he'll want from Potter, and it hits him: he doesn't know how to make a Patronus. Potter does. Maybe if he'll learn how to make a Patronus from Potter, this sinking feeling he has will go away. It's an absurd thought, but still…
Except, when Harry finally says what the news actually
want to see —
Harry, though, doesn't notice. Instead, a smile spreads across his face, one that makes Draco's stomach do a little belly flop. "I did it," he repeats.
Harry holds out a hand towards Draco, and Draco takes it, his heart beating in his throat.
"You did it," Draco says. He can't keep the disappointment out of his voice. He doesn't try to.
"This is… different," she notes. She finally looks over at Draco's bed and makes eye contact with him. She frowns, and maybe it's at the fact that Draco is under a pile of blankets and is making no move to get up. "Your room wasn't always like this, right?"
"Uh," Draco gets out. This isn't what he expected, not at all, but he knows that he has to say
"Maybe it doesn't," he replies, looking down at his lap. There's a sharp pain behind his eyes, and Draco thinks that him crying would just be the cherry on top of a fantastic evening.
It hits Draco an hour before Harry's due to come over: Harry's
"I'll see you then," Harry says. Draco just grins back like an idiot.
is — but maybe Draco could accidentally see if Harry likes him or not, and then if the answer is
"Sorry," Draco says, the words falling out of his mouth before he can stop them. "I don't have many happy things in my life."
"What?" Harry replies, the smile wiped off of his face.
Unfortunately, he thinks he's more like his father than his mother.
He's only thinking one thing, really. This is
Draco doesn't make a move to greet his mother. He watches from the comfort of his bed as his mother looks around at his nearly empty room.
The second letter comes later than he expected. He expected it to come soon after the trials, because Harry saw him in person. It comes a week later, when Draco's once again eating breakfast, but Draco's glad for the distraction nonetheless.
"The emotions are all still there, but they're not mine," he says, slowly becoming numb. Straightening his back, he looks at Harry, but he doesn't feel anything towards him. It's all nothing. "If you want to see what it's like, you can use the spell on me, yourself."
And then, something rushes throughout Draco, the memory of his Aunt Bellatrix teaching him Occlumency and he's suddenly on the ground and his aunt is above him, and she's pointing her wand at him. The ruciatus curse floods his body, and Draco tries not to yell, but he fails as the pain floods through him. He yells in his memory, and it takes him a moment to realize that Harry has pulled away, and he's yelling in real-time, too.
Draco had been looking forward to Harry coming all week. The thought of his next meeting with Harry makes him feel jittery. His stomach keeps on flopping at the thought, but he doesn't actually mind it. It's sort of nice.
"How do I know if they really love me?" Draco asks. He hates how his voice cracks, and he blinks his eyes shut.
"I almost killed you, and you repaid me by lying to your entire family to save my life," Harry says quietly. He gives another small shrug as Draco steals a glance at him again.
Harry looks like he wants to say something more, but he complies.
Draco curses as he hears his mother's voice from behind him. Turning around, he can see her approaching him and he wonders how he could've been so stupid to let his mother catch up with him. Although it's not really a surprise — all Draco can think about is
Harry is genuine. He knows that if he says the word, Harry will gladly take him anywhere else, and they'll be able to have a
So he makes the split-second decision to be truthful and he says that he was scared. He had been terrified, actually, and he had spent his sixth year with an impossible task. He had spent the entire year in torture and he had to do the impossible, and he nearly killed himself trying to figure out what to do that year, and he couldn't even do it, and he —
"Yeah, okay," Harry agrees, but Draco can see him look slightly disappointed and try to hide it. He stands up and walks over to Draco. They stand like that, face-to-face, for a few awkward moments before Harry claps a hand on Draco's shoulder.
Draco's so shocked, honestly, that it doesn't last long. He didn't think he could
and she'll never come back, but still — good. He had fifteen years without her. He'd like some more.
"Yes," Harry says, and Draco didn't think it would be that easy. Harry frowns, looking thoroughly confused. "I mean, no. I mean
," Draco says quietly, thinking about Harry, about kissing Harry, about having a relationship with him.
"She probably has forgiven you, if you want to talk to her," Harry says. Draco thinks that he might bite a hole in his tongue like this.
She grabs his hand and squeezes it just as everyone makes a move to sit back down and his father's trial is about to start. Draco doesn't squeeze her hand back, he just turns his head to face the trial.
Draco turns his head to face Harry just as his mother approaches. Harry gets up, nodding at her, and as soon as Harry's gone, Draco's mother sits down next to him.
"Can I still come over next week?" Harry asks. Draco thinks that he might start crying if he looks up at him.
Silver spews out of his wand. It twists, and it takes form in the air, and it forms into a dragon.
be crazy and it'd break any semblance of friendship Draco has with Harry.
Draco turns to look at Harry, and he has no reason to disbelieve him. The look on his face feels genuine, and Draco thinks, maybe this is what having a real friend feels like.
The judges announce that there will be a break before Draco's father's trial, and Draco spends the hour in his seat, while his father goes to talk to the judges.
. Draco wonders, for the millionth time in his life, what makes Gryffindors so thick.
Harry looks taken aback at Draco's question, and a flash of guilt hits him.
. He's supposed to be that first. "I've had a shit week, and…" Harry lets out a long breath. "I just wanted to see my friend and pretend everything is normal."
sees it, and he admits that Draco had been a jerk when he was younger, yes, but Harry tells the judges how Draco was raised in an unhealthy environment, with his father being a Death Eater. It makes Draco slightly uncomfortable, to hear the truth of his childhood, but he supposes it's just that — the truth. Harry says how he saw Draco's fear and uncertainty up close, on the Astronomy Tower, and how he only took the Dark Mark and the job to protect his family. Draco didn't know that Harry saw all of that, he realizes, and it makes him feel strange, to know that Harry's seen in him probably his worst moment. Draco's stomach does a weird little somersault when Draco tells the judges that he didn't kill Dubmledore; that he probably never would have. Harry continues to talk about when Harry was brought to Malfoy Manor, with Hermione and Ron. Draco could have, Harry says, told everyone that he knew exactly who the three prisoners were — but he didn't. When Harry finishes talking about Malfoy Manor, Draco thinks he's done, but he adds on that, in a weird way, Draco being forced to assassinate Dumbledore saved Harry's life; when Harry disarmed him, months later, the Elder Wand switched allegiances and Harry defeated Voldemort because of it.
Draco has no energy to ask Potter how or why he's here — they both just finished a

be doing. He should not be thinking of Harry like that.
Draco's going to go to Azkaban.
Abandoning his breakfast and promising to clean it up later, he heads to his family's library. If he's going to attempt to teach Harry Occlumency, he might as well learn more about it. His family library is extensive, with topics from Quidditch to potions.

And a fourth thing: he thinks that they'll be friends. Draco is
"I don't —" Draco says, and it's

before it's all taken away from him. "Yes?"
," he finishes, and he says it with such fervor, that Draco can't help but laugh a little bit.
"Of course," Draco says, smiling, and feeling lighter than he has in months. A weight he didn't even know he had was lifted off of him. He's free, he's going to see Harry soon, maybe his life can get back to normal.
, he could ask him out with no fear of rejection. Or he could just find out that Harry
Harry must not hear how Draco can't help but ask it in a questioning way. If he's being entirely honest, he's not quite sure he's really awake right now. This is a dream, all of it. He's going to wake up, and the war won't even be over yet.
Harry closes his eyes, and Draco immediately thinks he did something wrong. After a few beats of Harry just standing there, he manages to get out, "My girlfriend broke up with me."
"I have bad news, actually," Harry says, breaking the silence. "I didn't particularly come to practice today." Draco's good mood is instantly destroyed.
"For what?" Harry asks, and Draco's surprised that
His mother seems almost disappointed at him not saying more.
The doorbell rings on Thursday night at seven-thirty in the evening and Draco almost has a heart attack. In an attempt to stave off the boredom, he had spent the evening holed up in his father's study, reading books about herbology, before the doorbell took him out of his dull glaze. He didn't even know they
Draco will never let him forget it.
"That was a dumb thing to ask, you're probably straight, aren't you? That was —"
Draco would like the floor to open up and swallow him. That, or a time machine that would let him go back and hit himself over the head
"Did you love Dad?" Draco blurts out, not at all the question he wanted to ask. His mother hesitates, and Draco has no idea why he's asking her for love advice.
"'Course," Draco replies. His voice is disgustingly hoarse. He hears the sound of gold coins being dropped onto the table and a chair being pushed back.
He doesn't pay much attention to the trial itself. He sits next to his father and tries to avoid everyone's eyes that he can feel crawling all over him. He even avoids Harry, who's in the audience, a few rows over from Draco, and who tries to catch his eye.

His father is led away, and his mother dries her tears with a handkerchief, and Draco feels queasy.
Because, yeah, that sucked, it sucks, everything sucks.
"Tell me about yourself," Harry says. Draco steals a glance at him, and there's no judgment in Harry's face. It makes Draco nervous.
"Er," Draco says, trying to think of what he would want to hear if he got broken up with. "I'm sorry?" he says, it sounding more like a question. "It'll be okay and there are plenty of other fish in the sea?"

So he shrugs instead and looks right in front of him, focusing his eyes on a broken chair that's about to collapse, its legs charred beyond repair. He shifts his attention to a small box, the lock falling off. He just

know. Except, Harry is being slightly weird, too. It's not just Draco being overly worried, he's pretty sure. Harry's a little bit stiffer. His smile doesn't really reach his eyes when he says hello to Draco.
For some odd reason, Draco doesn't want that more than he wants to not talk, so he parrots back, "Hello."
He doesn't think anyone else will send him letters, so he unrolls the scroll attached to its little leg and flattens it out, reading every word carefully.
Harry tells the same story Draco does, except for some reason, Draco's the hero in his story. Harry goes through Draco's life as
"Will you teach me Occlumency?"
And isn't that just fantastic?
"I'm sorry," Draco says, taking extra caution to soften his tone. It's still surreal for him, having Harry as a friend. He does like it though, but his brain can't help but think that it could be one-sided. That thought scares him. But if Harry's coming to

in front of the judges. The head judge nods, and he knows that he's dismissed as everyone starts to stand up and walk away. It takes him a second to get up, but once he does, he doesn't even have time to move before Harry's flinging his arms around his neck.
He wants that. He wants
"Not really, no," Harry answers, and Draco can clearly see that he doesn't get it.
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure," Draco says, biting his lip and staring down at the ground. He wonders how badly his face is burning up right now and he desperately wants to look up to see what Harry's face looks like, but he keeps his head down. A weight appears on his shoulder and it takes Draco a moment to realize that it's Harry's hand.
Draco frowned again, looking around for a moment before pulling his hand free and rounding the desk to collect his satchel. “Everything from the Flourish and Blotts break-in is in my report,” he said, briskly, but stayed where he was, behind the desk. “I’ll have the report of my analysis from the charity shop to you by lunch, Friday. I'm just waiting on the-”
Stung, Draco stared for a moment, his cheeks heating. His father's voice rang in his ears and he found himself parroting the words aloud.
Now, as he sat at the Burrow, surrounded by sympathetic friends and family, he still didn’t know how to react. Perhaps this was the denial phase… he still couldn’t quite believe Harry was gone. Couldn’t believe one madman could do what Voldemort himself could not.
Draco was thankful for the next wave of pain and cried out, the sound reverberating off stone this time. Potter's face sobered instantly.
Draco glanced up with a sly grin to find Flemm smiling at him and shaking his head fondly. Flemm refused to call him Draco; Draco refused to call him Flemming. It was their thing.
“All is well, son,” Flemm said, straightening with a creak of his aging joints. “What are you still doing down in this dusty torture chamber? Lunch was an hour ago. You ought to get outside, get some sun while we've got it.”
Smirking, Harry took a bite of the apple, then tossed it back to Draco. "That's a silly superstition and you kno— know—" he broke off, a sputtering cough wracking his shoulders and chest.
The noise and light are what I remember most of King’s Cross Station on that cool autumn morning. My first day as a Hogwarts student. Other students and their parents bustled around, carting trunks and cages, some already donning their school uniforms. And, as a magnificent backdrop to the activity of Platform 9 ¾, the enormous Hogwarts Express outshone it, gleaming a deep burgundy and belching steam into sky above.
"Have you seen the headline?" Draco asked, bursting through the door into Harry's dressing room.
“Besides, you know full well it's more than that.” They reached Robards office and Harry paused outside, whispering as Draco entered.
"Come, come," Pansy said, ushering him into the room he'd set aside for this day's preparations. "Enough photographs, we have to finish getting you ready."
Harry’s arms tightened around Draco, his eyes darkening. But his wrath could wait. For now, they would celebrate, for love won again.
Teddy rolled his eyes and Harry smirked, jabbing a finger into Draco's shoulder.
Thanks for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"I know," Draco said between sobs. "How?" He lifted his head then and met Potter's eyes for the first time since before the war. "How could something so perfect come from me?"
That wasn’t exactly true. He did want it - he was half starved after missing lunch, again, and it was delicious - but it irked him that Potter was the one who shoved it into his hand, ordering him to eat. The only thing that man did more than flirt outrageously was feed him. But, where did he even get a sandwich? Sure, Draco had actually been closer to fifteen minutes, but that wasn’t enough time for Potter to finish his lunch, get down to the cafeteria, and meet Draco with sandwich in tow.
Potter had been assigned the job of talking to him, keeping him calm, holding his bloody hand. But Draco couldn't bring himself to answer him.
Draco cringed but his sobs quieted some. "That's not exactly what you're supposed to say in a moment like this, Potter."
Creevey Sentencing—Potter-Malfoy Wedding Safe At Last
Harry glared at Ron as they hurried through the door, taking their seats on either side of a sniggering Draco.

"Granger will get a healer, just stay calm."
He tried to stop himself, but the words kept coming, gathering steam until he'd recited his father's rants about the Potters and Weasleys, and even that oaf, Hagrid. He allowed himself to insult and threaten the boy he'd hoped to befriend. Draco wasn't proud of his actions, of egging his friends into picking on Potter and Weasley, of anything that transpired in that train compartment.
“Whoa,” he said, laughing as he lifted his hands to steady Draco. “What's your rush, gorgeous?”
We all know how a good story ends. The hero saves the day, gets the girl, the family. Well, Draco may have saved the day, but Harry was no girl. And I’m the one who got a family.
Thanks for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
“You doing okay, gorgeous? I can carry Scorp, if you want.”
"Draco," he said slowly. "It's okay, he's right here." Rising, Potter laid the baby in Draco's arms and stood back while he checked him over from head to toe. "Pomfrey told me to let you sleep. He-- he's beautiful, Draco."
“All of those are good,” Teddy said. “But Ron told me the Hufflepuff common room is underground—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“For Merlin’s sake, Scorpius! Don't you want to see Teddy?” Scorpius looked up at the sound of his voice, his laughter echoing off the stone walls.
“Or Slytherin,” Draco interjected. “Like me and Merlin.”
Hurrying through the train with Vince and Greg hot on his heels, Draco looked briefly into each compartment he passed, checking who was inside. Something told him he knew exactly who he was looking for and, when he found him in a compartment with a freckled redhead, he knew he was right.
Creevey snapped back, as if slapped. “He’s with Colin, now,” he said, an eerie calm coming over him. “He’s safe.”
“Yeah. The why is still a mystery, but I think we're agreed that someone is furnishing a nursery. There's this collection of children's books, all Muggle. They seem pretty old, but all of them have the same inscription: ‘For Lucas.’ Ron and I are leaning toward family heirlooms or childhood belongings. Maybe Lucas is the one robbing these places.”
“Oh, right,” Teddy giggled. “Can I have sweets at the cinema, Harry?”
Shuffling through the files, he did his best to sort the stack between red stones and actual ruby. Of that much, Mr Kane was certain. The method had a dual purpose; eliminating everything that wasn't remotely relevant and skimming the contents of each record. He kept the inventory photograph of the stolen necklace within reach and referenced it often.
“I know, I know,” Draco said, affecting a weary posture. “I'll never make that mistake again.”
“You see, sir,” he began, settling into his seat, “I have discovered that there is a case under investigation at Scotland Yard that I'm certain is tied to our robbery on Diagon Alley.”
And that was what had him nervous, really. The last member of the group that had been making their lives miserable had escaped. The other members couldn’t name him, even under veritaserum. He was a mystery, a loose cannon that could go off at any time and ruin this perfect day.
“I see,” Draco said, smirking. “Well, go on then, lift the curse.”
“A mobile?” Harry asked. Frowning, he leaned closer to read over Draco's shoulder. “Like a phone?”
Smirking, Draco shifted his son to his shoulder, straightening his back. "Not on your life, Potter."
“Don't give me that, you know what. It's creepy.”
Potter laughed, a weak sound. "So you can talk. I was starting to think you'd been cursed mute." Draco did his best to roll his eyes. Potter laughed again. "It's not that ridiculous a thought. I'd have done it."
"Don't be ridiculous, darling, you've been out gallivanting around, taking photos and greeting guests. You need a touch up so that you look your very best for Potter."
“And the mobile was all that was taken?”
Draco felt his cheeks heat and ducked his head for a moment. Fuck, but Harry was… Alluring. Everything about him screamed casual masculinity and sex, even when he grinned at whatever Teddy was saying, dad mode clearly activated. His dark hair fell in swooping waves of tangled curls, hooking around his ears and blending with the scruffy beginnings of a beard that darkened his jaw.
