Harry’s mind went to a happy place first. Before he knew it, he was sitting up slowly and bending over on top of the blonde. He reached down and experimentally planted his mouth on Draco’s. The first thing he thought was that they were nothing like Ginny’s. Draco’s were somehow softer, but his lips were thinner. Harry wasn’t sure if it was the high or his subconscious, but he instinctively pressed harder at Malfoy’s mouth and teased the boy’s lips apart. Draco’s hands went to his hair immediately, tangling in a mess of brown curls. He pulled sharply, and Harry let out a soft moan into his mouth. It felt so unbelievably right, like the best thing Harry had known in the entire universe. Draco kissed him back feverishly. Harry loved every second of it, how Draco’s tongue explored the back of his mouth and the way he found himself groaning into every little touch.
“I know,” Ron says slowly. “I just didn’t expect you to follow through so quickly.”
Draco was pale, more porcelain than he’d ever appeared before, like the nauseatingly sharp white of an English dinner set. His eyes were half open, faded grey peeking out halfway from underneath purple hooded eyelids. Harry looked away, suppressing the urge to throw up all over the bedside table.
He’d been avoiding Ginny at work for weeks on end, and she’d decidedly taken the hint. She was the type to hold grudges and would likely be stubborn enough in her resolve to not bother apologising before he did. Either way, Harry had suggested Draco cut his time down with her, and for God knows what reason, the voice in his head had forced him to listen.
“I don’t
He shakes himself from the thought at once.
With blood curling crimson lines around his shaking fingers, he fumbles with the lock on the iron gate. His wand has been lost to the forest behind him, and Harry is reluctant to go back for it. If only Magpie had warned him that the mission could go so
“It’s all in the eyes, dear.”
“That’s not exactly a question, Potter.”
“I’m serious.”
was an unspoken truth.
She wailed a battle cry, aiming her croissant in his direction.
He felt tears prick at his eyes when searching hands met his chest and pulled him in.
“We call each other by our surnames for the most part. But Blaise is the exception. He says first names should never be wasted. Besides that, the only people that consistently call me Draco are my parents. My mother.”
McGonagall cut him off sharply by raising a single hand in front of her face. Malfoy’s mouth snapped shut. Harry was too busy being astonished by his outburst to comprehend what had actually been said. Certainly, Malfoy wanted out of this arrangement, and so did Harry, but it was out of character for the tosser to offer himself up for something else. To actually attempt to be helpful for once in his life. His politeness toward their Professor had not been forced, it lacked an edge that Harry recognized when Malfoy was trying too hard. The whole situation was nauseatingly disconcerting.
been in the summertime when he was more sure than ever that he wanted to leave the shambles of his marriage behind for something new. Something that challenged him in a healthy way. Maybe Harry wanted to leave him but couldn’t muster up the courage quite yet? Draco knew he’d be devastated if that were the case, but if it made Harry whole again, then so be it.
“You’re a good cat,” Harry sighs, patting his head. “Sometimes.”
“Shit,” Harry says, as Draco’s breaths become softer and less frequent. “I don’t know what to do.”
He cried just as someone might expect him to — silently and rarely.
Harry found himself rolling his eyes, “can we at least meet somewhere else, at least?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, breath catching in his throat. He coughed a few times before allowing Locke to continue.
“I’m sorry I didn’t come see you earlier. I was overwhelmed.”
Lyra had already left, and Draco watched as Harry conjured a Patronus to send to Ron. He idly wondered what they’d do with their day. If it meant avoiding such horrible pain, Draco would do anything asked of him.
Harry felt himself growing increasingly defensive. It wasn’t Ron’s business who he was or wasn’t involved with, and it was Harry’s decision when to inform them as such.
There’s an unpleasantly loud silence in the room as Harry struggles to come to terms with what has just been said. He must be going crazy.
Harry’s just gotten home from work after a gruelling Monday when he hears a knock on his door. He’s not expecting Ron or Hermione, or anyone for that matter, but knows most of his friends would choose to use the Floo anyway.
Cheerless rays of light shone through French doors out to the garden, and Harry opened them instinctively. The morning was still blanketed by a biting cold, but it would burn off by midday according to the weather report.
“Just because you’ve been avoiding doing this doesn’t mean everyone else has, you know. You can’t tell me that Luna and Neville are a mistake. What about Ginny and Blaise? Are those people who would have ever gotten together without the system?”
“Love you too,” Harry murmured, muttering a soft cleaning spell and pressing a kiss to Draco’s temple. Draco shivered at the charm’s intrusion into his body. “I really do.”
“No, I want to.” Harry turned his hands to the dishes and began scrubbing with a Muggle sponge.
“Hi,” Draco said, kissing the fabric of Harry’s shirt gently. He found himself startled by the unfamiliar intimacy of touch.
“Fine,” he said, knitting his brow together as something pained crossed his features.
“I heard some choice dementors are waiting for you just outside if you’re interested,” Harry said, breaking the silence and fighting to keep his tone even. “A kiss, maybe, if you’re feeling bold.”
“I could look at you forever,” Harry says. He can’t resist taking Draco into his arms, planting a gentle kiss on his cheek. The lips will have to, at least, be saved for the ceremony.
When he Apparated back to the cottage, it was well into the afternoon. The day had grown warm and sticky, just as the weather report had predicted, and it was the slightest bit too hot outside for comfort. With cooling charms, they would have to make it work.
Ron continued their descent, and Harry followed close behind to not stray too far on his own. He never liked being alone in this part of the Ministry and made a point to avoid it actively. Something about the cloying and claustrophobic environment of his office was still far more welcome than this.
“Sir.” The man cleared his throat from behind Harry, who startled at the sound. “We have something new today.”
And no one but Healer Rubin knew the entire truth about his situation, which was why Ginny and Pansy, and oftentimes even Luna saw Harry when it was appropriate. Christmas holidays were always awkward for their friends. But Draco insisted they should never choose sides.
Draco stumbles a bit on the last step, and Harry moves forward quickly on instinct. He reaches out his arms, steadying Draco against the bannister. He’s slack-jawed and unresponsive to the touch, and it makes Harry feel sick and frightened.
He had thought, at first, it would behave like a drinkable Imperius Curse. Within the Auror department, partners often came across illegal labs experimenting with bottling the Unforgivables, but the numerous attempts were never successful. And, well, this one didn’t seem so bad. Draco was clearly in his right state of mind. If anything, he was only more open-minded and understanding than before, as if the potion made him think a little before opening his mouth in anger. It broke past Draco’s characteristic wall of stubbornness. Harry’s guilt was vanishing, and he felt less sick and more hopeful. No real harm was done at all, right? It was just once. To get Draco to
“What on earth are you wearing Potter?” Malfoy pupils dilated, but Harry failed to notice.
There was a moment of silence.
“We need to immerse ourselves in the…Muggle world to understand what we want to prioritize in the curriculum.” Malfoy wrinkled his nose at the statement he had just made, but it was clear he was attempting to stay composed. Harry was fairly impressed by him. This was growth, even if it was just the beginnings.
“Holy shit,” Harry said, coming down to lie next to him. “Haven’t done that in a while.”
Draco wasn’t jealous. Until he was, and then all hell would break loose.
“Sure,” Draco said, angling his head at a chair.
He accepted the cake with one hand, fishing out a handful of Galleons with the other. He paid Madam Odessa, but she didn’t move away from him, only gazed through his eyes like she was trying to find something else within the green.
She frowned and held out a small paper bag, no doubt packed to the brim with her freshest bakes. “You forget that you’re easily readable to me, dear. You mustn't hide away behind that dreadful mask. You know how I always say a man’s best asset is his smile.”
“Auror Potter, sir, Ms Marchand’s family is this way.” A kind-eyed Auror led him to the opposite side of the tent. It was quieter, and the air a little colder. There was less panic, but far more fear. “They’re just through here.” He pulled back the curtain and disappeared as Harry stepped through.
Draco exhaled roughly, finding a seat at the edge of the bed and digging his fingers into the soft comforter. The bed dipped gently next to him, and Ginny held out her hand. He took it.
Robards ends the call swiftly, and Harry feels relieved and a little surprised at how easy it is for him to lie and how ready people are to believe him.
“And for tea and biscuits!” Ron joked, but his half-hearted smile slid from his face when it wasn’t returned. “We’re just worried about you.”
Ginny pinched the bridge of her nose. “I just wish you could see, especially after all of this, that being with him is killing you.”
Clove sighed, affectionately patting his leg. “Give him time. He’ll come eventually. In the meantime, you have a few other people waiting outside for you, but I don’t want to overwhelm you so early.”
“Ron!” Hermione yelps.
A cleared throat from the doorway sent Harry’s heart racing, and he hastily tucked the vial into his pocket. He steeled himself against the counter before turning around. Draco leaned against the frame, his hair still dishevelled from when George had roughed him up earlier, and Harry fought the urge to reach out and push the strands back into place. It was unusual to see Draco unkempt.
“I wish you could talk to me like this when you’re sober,” Harry says thoughtlessly after a few moments of charged silence. “You’re never open with me.”
Draco only offered a humourless laugh.
side of Draco. He knew it was there somewhere, underneath all the other bullshit that plagued their lives. But Harry could tell already that Draco would always be more like Narcissa than Lucius, and he loved him more for it every day.
were overwhelmed.” Draco laughed, a sick and cruel sort that rang through Harry’s ears unpleasantly.
“That’s still been too many times,” Draco says, though his tone lacks an edge, and Harry finds himself unable to stop the smile that comes out. “Can I ask you something?”
Draco always had to work; it had become increasingly clear as he climbed the ranks of Gringotts that his free time was painfully limited at best. But it was the weekend, and Harry had put effort into the party.
He’d have to focus on that later, though.
“Can I come in?” Draco asks. “It’s cold.”
The beginning twinges of pain began to make their presence known in the familiar spot between Draco’s eyebrows, and he pressed at his head tentatively. He knew he couldn’t wish the feeling away, but if there was ever a time he prayed that he could have, it was now.
“Hands to yourself, Ms Parkinson,” he tutted, mischief glinting in his eyes. “That one’s taken.”
“You’re alright here, alone?”
But Harry was right there over his shoulder, pulling him away with a drawn wand.
Draco sobs into Harry’s neck, coming into his hand with a cry. He buries deeper, clawing his fingernails down the length of Harry’s back.
Eventually, he took a seat at a table with Ginny and Pansy, who were practically eye-fucking each other from their chairs. If he didn’t feel like a third wheel with Ron and Hermione, he certainly did whenever those two were around. Oddly enough, Draco came to his rescue.
It was an unsettling thought that the substance required him to comply with. But it didn’t push him in the way that Draco probably felt. It just sat there, a constant reminder of how terrible a person Harry had become. Ruthless and reckless in his resolve.
Harry considers this for a moment, reluctant to admit that her words ring true. He knows he’s notorious for being obstinate and set in his ways, but he supposes that this is the one time he can’t really let himself be.
“I don’t doubt it,” Ron says. “Once a tosser, always a tosser.”
“No, you don’t. You were busy,” the woman said, but there was no bitterness to it, just pragmatism. She hesitantly held her hand out for Harry. “I’m Capucine. This is my father, Alfred.”
“Years, yeah?” Draco said, dazed.
“You could probably go outside and see all of this instead,” Harry says. “Why stay in here?”
“Yes,” Draco managed, but the room suddenly felt like it was contracting upon itself. He was wheezing, holding the counter for support as though it were a glimmering lifeline. Clinging to anything that could ground him back into reality. “Harry?” he said, and he could hear how broken his voice sounded. So weak and vulnerable, just like his subconscious had already known.
“As can I.” Draco sighed, pulling out a chair at the table and gesturing for Harry to take the other. They sat awkwardly, as if they were casual acquaintances meeting for the first time after a long while. “I’ve done my thinking about this, Harry. I know this is not what you want, but it’s for the best. All I want is what’s best for you, what’s best for both of us.”
“Why would Muggles need to detect metal?” Malfoy scoffed, “How utterly useless. Makes sense.”
Draco stepped through almost immediately at the invitation, hoping Harry wouldn’t stir within the hour. At his intrusion, he knocked over a stack of
Then, he was in an alley. Rain pouring down from the skies, splashes of dirty water from drainage pipes in his hair.
Bile rose in his throat, and his breathing grew shallower, feeling as though he were going to be sick in the toilet. He swallowed it down, counting numbers until he was calm once more, and then resumed his routine.
“I need to do something for him,” Harry speaks again, but Luna is chatting to Neville, and no one is listening to him. “I need to tell him.”
Either way, if the thistle didn’t work, there was no harm done.
“I want you to be able to tell me anything, without thinking I’m going to resent you or get mad.” Ron said firmly, “I want you to know that”
“But they’re
Hermione approached Harry’s bed when it was clear that no other boys were in the room. It must have been late in the day that the place had emptied out so quickly.
“Well, you’ve fucked us now,” Draco says, not turning away from the mirror where he’s readjusting his jacket. “This is such bad luck.”
now,” Harry jokes.
“Your comedown is going to be worse if you lie in bed all day,” Harry says. He figures cutting to the chase is a better tactic. “I’ll buy you a coffee even, but you’re coming with me no matter what.”
She emerged minutes later with the cake, and Draco’s eyes sparkled at her. After they sang Happy Birthday and he’d blown out his candles, Draco ruffled at Ginny’s hair affectionately and gave out half a dozen warm-hearted hugs like they were party favours.
And then, without forewarning, Harry’s mind begins to wander.
He comes back around to the other side, unthinkingly tucking a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear so it won’t get in the way.
“Malfoy that was never my intention–” Harry clambered to his feet unsteadily, wiping his mouth on the back of his sleeve.
“Yes, and so does Ron.” He steadied himself next to Draco at the trunk of the tree. “But the reason they know is because I’m serious about this, like really serious. I panicked because I thought we’d made a mistake. But that should be proof enough to you that I want you.”
“Harry,” Draco gasped, writhing against the wall, panic bubbling in his chest.
Moonlight shone down on the pair from the sky above, but it set Draco’s skin aglow. Harry ran his fingers along Draco’s spine, drinking in the scent of peppermint and riding out his high in the best possible way.
There’s one room that has light seeping out from underneath the crack. Harry knocks gently, and there’s no answer from inside. He knocks again, this time a little more forcefully. He underestimates his own strength, because the door seems to open just a bit, and Harry pushes it forward without much of a second thought.
Draco felt his arousal pool unwillingly in the pit of his stomach. He wanted Harry alone as much as he wanted to avoid being alone with him. But he knew this wasn’t right.
He thanked the waitress and held the drink up in greeting towards the man, who returned the gesture.
Harry knows he pauses for a moment too long before answering, but he’s never been able to lie well to Luna, no one really can. “I’m fine.”
“Don’t say stop to me,” Harry said, his voice low and threatening.
“Er-I guessed?” Harry lied through his teeth, but oddly Malfoy did not push it. He was growing interested in the expanse around him.
He took the tube as close as he could to Diagon Alley during the weekday and then Apparated the remaining distance. Odessa hand-delivered his breakfast unfailingly each morning with a kiss to his forehead and wrote to his mother that Draco was eating and sleeping adequately. Best of all, he’d surrounded himself by people of all kinds — both Muggle and wizarding.
“You okay?” Harry asks.
“I am married to Harry Potter.”
“Thank you, Mrs Weasley,” he says, softly, with cracks in his voice.
Draco swallowed, his throat tight.
“Just like that?”
“Slowly, love,” she said, wrangling the glass away from his prying, insistent fingers. “You’ll have to pace yourself or you’ll be sick.”
“So, what? You both just woke up the next day and decided to be nicer, which fixed everything?” Ginny asked, her voice bordering on incredulous. When put like that, Harry spared no wonder as to why she was disbelieving in the first place.
“So, you and Dean,” Harry says, noticing how close they are.
The voice was angry now, insistent and unrelenting in its desire to force Draco’s hand. He fought it wordlessly with pleas of desperation, but the walls he’d slammed up in his mind were beginning to crumble to dust. They were never strong enough to hold it off entirely, but Draco was playing to buy time — not to win.
“No, don’t — ah!” Draco cried out, clutching at his temples and slamming his head down on the table with a rough crack.
Harsh and glaring sunlight streams cruelly through a set of open windows. Harry blearily opens one eye, and then the other, blinking multiple times to clear his vision before realising he’s not wearing any glasses. Reaching blindly for his nightstand, he feels around half-heartedly, fingers searching for his wire frames. As he puts them on, a bedroom comes to view, but one that he certainly doesn’t recognise.
Harry knew that. He really did. But sometimes it didn’t matter who had something first. Preference always took precedence over that, and Harry knew that oftentimes Ginny preferred Draco over him. Their flying wit, inside jokes, and cunning personalities were things Harry knew he could never share with either of the two.
When he leaves, the silence in the office seems so much louder than when they’d been talking. Harry sits at his desk, putting a hand to his forehead.
Lyra chirped contentedly from her perch, and Harry didn’t have to turn around to know that someone else had entered the room. He hastily shoved the vial back into the spice drawer and brought the cups to the table. Lyra settled on Draco’s shoulder like a soldier, chest puffed out and eyes staring warily at Harry.
“You’re withdrawing,” Healer Clove said when Draco had sicked up in the bin for the third time that morning.
“You don’t really get hungry when you’re using, do you?” Harry says carefully, reluctant to venture into dangerous territory.
“How did Harry let you get like this?” Pansy asked, tears filling her eyes. “This isn’t right.”
“Pull down his trousers,” Harry orders, and is relieved to see Theo work without asking questions. He fumbles with the buckle for far too long, before pulling Draco’s trousers down, just above his knee.
“Oh, Merlin,” he said aloud to no one in particular.
“I think I’m going to have a chat with Professor McGonagall, I’ll just be right back,” she said tightly.
“And then, Harry came along,” Draco smiles, the corners of his eyes crinkling, finally taking his eyes off the ground. “He told me I was ruining my life, and I didn’t want to hear it, but I needed to. He tells me all the time that I need to be responsible for my own recovery, that he can’t do the hard work for me. And that was shitty to hear at first, because who wants to do that?”
“Well,” Neville had continued, “I’ve been working with St Mungo’s on some research with Silybum Marianum. It’s a peculiar plant, you see, but it’s worked like a charm in Janus Thickey. It walks a fine line between magical and Muggle; it’s one of the few that does.”
“But it’s not like I have to do it right now,” Harry says, taking off his glasses and rubbing at his eyes uncomfortably. It’s still far too early in the morning for him to be thinking straight, let alone doing this. He’s been holding off for almost a year now, and really had no intention of ever coming in.
“Done with the garden?” Draco asked, lifting his head lazily from a pillow.
Ginny makes her way over to the bed, perching herself on the edge and taking his hand gently between her own. “This whole situation sucks, and I’m really sorry you have to deal with it.”
“Ah, so you’re
“I had a lovely time today,” Draco says as they step into the warmth of Harry’s home. “Thank you for inviting me.”
“Hello, Neville,” Harry chirped. He clutched the Honeysuckle flowers tighter in his hands.
Harry looks up at him through his eyelashes, because there is no way he had heard that correctly. “Really?”
“I love you just as much, Harry. I would never lie about that.”
He raps gently on the door, and Pansy pokes her head out from behind.
The voice said it softly, a gentle push, and Draco strained against it cockily. He demanded it to be quiet, but the weight of its command sank into the deepest reaches of his head. The pain wasn’t there yet, but Draco knew it would come if he held out for much longer. A part of him always wanted to give in to the satisfying relief.
“Why are you still here?” Draco sneers. He looks as though he wants to get up, like he’s uncomfortable that Harry sits taller than him on the bathtub, but he can’t seem to find the strength. A small, childish part of Harry likes the idea that he might have the upper hand.
“Harry,” he says unnecessarily, shifting uncomfortably in his chair.
Harry’s eyes widen for a moment before he schools his expression back into normalcy.
, it was just that Malfoy got all upset afterward and then he left. And back at school, he yelled at me for taking him there.”
“Thank you,” Draco repeats again. “And I love you.”
is scrawled in Harry’s chicken-scratch. If it wasn’t his own handwriting, he’d probably be unable to make out the words and numbers himself.
“You didn’t answer my question, though,” Harry pointed out. “Who picked this one?”
Draco’s shoe slipped out against wet pavement underneath, and his body threatened to give way. He caught himself in time, steadying a hand against a slick lamppost before continuing forward. Rain bore down on his face, cutting at his cheeks violently as a biting wind drew tears from his eyes.
Harry cradles Draco in his arms. He feels so small, and Harry never wants to let go.
Harry finds himself clinging to her every word as she speaks; she seems to be the kind of person that draws a crowd, for no reason in particular but a kind, positive aura.
of that.”
Instead, he rocked into him feverishly, tracing down the hard lines of his ribcage and across the scars left by
“Harry,
“That woman is something else.” Harry rolled his eyes, and took a few bags from Ginny. “She asked me my
Malfoy seemed even paler than before, if that were possible, but extracted his wand from his pocket anyway. He transfigured his robes into precisely what Harry was wearing. Harry wanted to laugh, but it made sense. He had no frame of reference for something else to wear that would pass for Muggle clothing.
Once they had dressed, Harry and Ron found Hermione waiting for them in the common room.
Harry kisses the space behind Draco’s ear in response. He pulls back, disentangling himself from the position, backing Draco up slowly against the counter. Harry’s lips meet Draco’s, warm and pliant. Just perfect.
Harry had informed everyone that Draco would be joining them, and it wasn’t a surprise to Ron or Hermione. In the nicest way, they’d pointed out how little time he was spending with them and how much time he had spent with Draco in the last few weeks. Whether it be stopping by after work for dinner, or Draco learning to feel comfortable coming to the office to share lunch with Harry and Ron, he was becoming a more regular occurrence in all of their lives. It was getting to a point where Harry couldn’t bear to spend days apart from him.
The small rodent flew into his hands from behind a strawberry bush that wasn’t faring well at all. Harry would have to ask Neville about that when they next saw each other. The mouse squirmed around his fingers anxiously.
“Hey,” Harry says softly. He reaches a hand out, delicately turning Draco’s head back to him.
He stepped out of the shower, towelling off wet hair before heading for the bedroom. In pyjamas, Draco was lying underneath the sheets with his wand clutched between his hands and his eyes searching the darkness for an escape. His freshly washed hair was creating a dark spot on the pillow.
“Ah,” Harry responds, feeling stupid for having questioned him. He bites his tongue, unable to stop thinking about how irresponsible it is for Draco to come to the Ministry wired out. He must still be feeling the effects from the night before.
Malfoy grimaced, “I was hoping we could do this nicely.”
“For the university, right?” Hermione seemed pleased at this, but her face fell when Harry began to look guilty.
The boardroom was large and long, unlike many of the other rooms in the Auror department. It wasn’t bare and simplistic but rather covered in photos, wanted posters, missing posters, coffee shop flyers, etc. The walls themselves were a burnt orange hue, the wooden table that ran long across the room was splintering from years of wear, and there was coffee and tea in the corner. The Aurors didn’t have a break room, so when Ron decided the boardroom was the perfect replacement, everyone seemed to follow along. They spent their lunch breaks and free time at the table as a group.
Harry looked down at his hands, self-consciously.
Harry Apparates them to the Ministry where Azalea’s meetings take place. Draco still doesn’t have much of his magic back yet, but he’s getting better every day, and really, it’s not that much of a priority among other things he’s focusing on.
Harry chuckled. “Why did you take off your shoes?”
He was later informed it had only been a couple of days.
“Go before I change my mind, Auror Potter.”
Draco allowed his hands to be pinned above his head as Harry kissed down his chest. And then he reached for the buttons.
Still, as much as he loves to admire Draco’s appearance, he can’t help but notice his hollow eyes. Sharp silver irises are dimmed to a muted grey. Circles so dark they stain Draco’s porcelain skin sit deep into his face, giving him a gaunt look that Harry just wants to
“Sorry,” he offers weakly.
Harry’s head snapped in the other direction and saw Hermione tugging at Ron’s robes. Draco scrambled up from the ground and reached for his novel, although it had been clear they had neglected their literature in favor of other activities.
“Draco, you’re not a burden,” Harry says, voice low. “I don’t want you to think that about yourself.”
The group claps with an excited vigour, and Ollie cheers from beside him.
Still, Harry approached the tent. As he entered, reality widened and stretched, and a large room came into focus. It was cosy and warm, but bare enough to be appropriate for the situation at hand. Witnesses were gathered to one side as a few Aurors jotted down notes with their quills. Harry stood at the entranceway awkwardly, unsure where to begin.
“Neither am I,” Malfoy said curtly.
“It’s only ecstasy,” Draco says. “There’s far worse out there to start out with. I would know.”
“Chicken will be ready in thirty. You don’t mind waiting?” he asked the table.
“Seamus,” Harry yells over the music, “what is all this?”
Draco nods, leaning heavily against the wall.
Draco peers over from the other side. “Don’t let her give you a hard time. She’s a brat.”
“You didn’t even want to ask if someone else could help you do it?” Ron questioned, his eyes widening in wonder at Harry’s apparent composure. Harry was a little surprised himself at how he’d taken the news.
“You know,” she said, acquiring a look in her eye that made Harry’s stomach turn. He already knew what was coming before she said it. “My mother used to make these for me whenever I was having a particularly tough time.”
Most owls, including Hedwig, had been happy to catch their own prey and enjoyed the thrill of a good hunt. Lyra was lazy; she expected to be taken care of. That might have been Harry’s least favourite quality of hers.
“I’ll die, too?” Harry asks. “That hardly seems fair.”
Harry glanced up from his fried eggs, sizzling away in the pan. “Happy birthday, Draco.” He smiled, but there was little warmth to it. “You’re up early.”
“Oh,” Harry says. “That’s wonderful then. It seems like you’re doing really well.”
“I threw up in your toilet a few times,” Draco says. “I hope that’s alright.”
There was a brief silence before Clove gathered herself to respond. It was only natural to be intimidated by Narcissa. “While there are no guarantees, milk thistle has been known to clear the mind effectively. In therapy, Draco mentioned hearing a voice in his head. This is common among many patients experiencing hallucinations, and the thistle should aid in removing those entirely. Additionally, Draco’s denial of his condition hinders his recovery and only extends his stay in our ward. We want him to get better too, and this will help.”
He guides Draco’s hands away to look at the product of his own making. Harry has gone silent, and still.
“Are you fucking kidding me right now?” Harry stood abruptly, and the container of wonton soup clattered to the side, spilling leftover broth over his paperwork. He applied a drying charm to it unthinkingly.
As Harry exits into the garden, there’s a nagging, pulling feeling in his stomach. Like he wants to turn around. To run back into the safety of the house, and sit by the warm fire, listening to Draco play until his fingers are red and raw and they’re laughing at the absurdity of it all. He frowns, piercing air cutting into his cheeks. It feels so cold, like it might snow.
Draco hummed in response. Harry couldn’t believe the potion would work this well, and so quickly at that. While the shopkeeper had mentioned strong wills could push past the bounds of its control, it was clear that Draco believed what he was saying to some degree. Maybe before, he wasn’t ready to swallow his pride and give their relationship one last try. Hope bloomed in Harry’s chest, and he felt like he could breathe a little easier for that.
“I don’t know what came over me,” he said, sounding honest.
“I don’t know if I like this room,” Malfoy pronounced, and Harry startled at the voice by his side.
It had been a few months since they had visited the crime scene, and nothing had changed.
Lyra was perched outside their windowsill, and Harry opened it slightly to let her in. She sat contentedly on the ledge, but her eyes swivelled up and down Harry’s body as though she were assessing his poor choice of clothing. He assumed, since Lyra was even bothering with him at all, that Draco had already left for work. He must have dressed in the guest bedroom then.
Harry’s eyes snap up at the mention. “I’m not sure,” he says truthfully. “I’d assume something at the Manor, where she usually is.”
Draco blinked. And then he blinked again. The white from before had faded into something more yellow. Not comforting at all, but less harsh as he adjusted to the visuals around him.
The statement elicits laughter and profound agreement from the group, but Azalea’s expression remains impassive but proud. Harry feels tears prick incessantly at his eyes. He forces a deep breath, in through his nose, out through his mouth.
Harry knew he didn’t understand, though, but wasn’t going to waste time pointing that out. He was most definitely alone.
Harry knew if he was going to stave off any concerns, now was the time to do it. If Ginny caught on to anything, even the slightest of details, she would turn into a hunting hound. And she wouldn’t stop until her prey was situated securely between her teeth.
, and I promised her I’d—”
“I know. We should.” Draco sighed, setting the newspaper back down and took a bite. Lyra extracted herself from his shoulder to inspect it.
“Good,” Draco praises, and Harry can feel the fine hairs on the back of his neck begin to stand.
Harry had been too busy with an unexpected caseload to do much outside of stay at the office late each evening and grab takeout meals with Ron. He’d want to prioritise seeing Draco, but Robards had kept a close eye on him. There wasn’t really a moment where he could’ve made something work, even during the supposed holiday.
He sat back in the wicker chair, still in his coal-coloured trousers from earlier. He had opted for a lighter shirt, a white and cottony button-down to which he had left half unbuttoned, a distinct sliver of his chest exposed underneath. He had exchanged his banking shoes for summer loafers, though they weren’t any less formal.
“Magical cores are akin to living things,” Ethel explains, wonder in her eyes at the subject. “They have desires, likes, dislikes, passions, if you will. If your core knows its pair, and you refuse to give it what it wants, it’ll destroy you.”
“I’ve never done anything like this before,” Harry confesses.
Snape deigns to express any sense of empathy, but Harry is surprised when he takes a seat beside him by the window. Snape decidedly leaves his legs inside of the tower.
Draco reached across the table and tilted Harry’s chin up affectionately. “I don’t think we can go back to the way things were before. But I don’t think that means our love for one another isn’t just as strong. We have to work on what we are now, in the present.”
He needed to hold his composure together to learn what Locke knew already. Harry would have to play the long game, even if the mindless taunting was unravelling any semblance of self-control he sought to hold on to.
“I’m sorry, I—”
“Follow me, Potter,” Draco teased, and Harry tagged along behind him. He found that he would follow Draco anywhere if he asked so temptingly.
“Come inside with me for a second.” Draco narrowed his eyes, but reached his hand out again for Harry anyway.
Harry is grateful for that, but also entirely too depressed to care. He would have been a moron to think that no one would find out what had happened. It had been a week, surely it was announced to the school already.
Draco had flared up right back at him. “It was just
Harry still had the sense to hold his tongue, as Zabini and Parkinson loomed behind him. He didn’t need three Slytherins on his back, let alone one.
“No,” Theo replies roughly. “He wouldn’t want us to make a scene.”
He offers only a coy smile, edging past Harry to collect the creature in his arms.
He’s more irritated than he’d like to be, knowing that Draco had only owled him under the influence, and not necessarily because he’d really wanted to spend time with him.
“You don’t care about yourself enough to get better,” Harry repeats the words back to make sure he’s heard them correctly.
Draco could practically hear his eyes roll in the silence. “Only you would think that.”
Harry drops his hand. “It’s alright.” He wandlessly Summons a tissue box from the dresser, leftover from when he’d had a cold in the weeks before meeting Draco again.
“I need you.” Draco looked around, flustered, and uncomfortable. “Harry, what’s going on?”
“He does.” Harry played with his wedding band, moving it from finger to finger. “I’m certain.” A part of him was still largely unsure, but he had to believe it now more than ever.
“I’m just kidding!” He held his hands up in defeat, and allowed a gentle laugh. “I suppose it couldn’t hurt to visit one of these institutions. I have no doubts that they will fail to measure up to wizarding education, but we could somehow observe a class or two. You know they have a subject called Chemistry which is fairly similar to–”
Snape sighs, and while it sounds disinterested, Harry just knows it is not. “It is so very Gryffindor of you to think that killing yourself would solve such a problem. Don’t you think that would be the coward’s way out?”
Draco frowns. “I don’t need you to save me.”
“Oh, trust me, I wouldn’t do that to myself.” Draco barked out a laugh.
“That’s no excuse!” Harry shouted out because it wasn’t.
Harry chews at his lip, unsure of what he should say. It would probably be best to bring Pansy and Theo here for this kind of conversation, but Harry knows that whether Draco is aware or not, he owes it to him to be honest. The clock on the wall reads six in the morning, and they probably wouldn’t be awake anyway. And, although Draco doesn't know it, Harry has a stake in his life too.
Draco throws up a hand, seemingly feigning nonchalance. “Please.”
Someone else cleared their throat. “My apologies,
“Potter?” he asks, his voice low and confused.
“It was easy to tell, you know. One would think that the Saviour, the Chosen One himself, would know better than to use a glamour. A third-year potions student would know Polyjuice is foolproof. But you were too busy saving the world, weren’t you? What was it in
want to talk to a dead woman’s family.
“I know you’re flawed. I know you used to say terrible things to me and my friends, and act like a complete prat in school, and defend the wrong side. I know who you used to be,” Harry continues. “And I know who you are now. You’re having a hard time dealing with everything, and I still care for you despite it all.”
The pain cleared within seconds of Harry’s words, but it felt like long and aching minutes to Draco. His body had been folded in half by the strength of Harry’s forearm to his chest. Looking at his sick was making something disturbing bubble up in his stomach, but he couldn’t summon the energy to Vanish it just yet.
Theo suggests he check the rooftop, though it’s freezing outside, and Draco is sure to get sick. Harry finds himself feeling significantly less intoxicated as he finds the hidden entrance on the second level of the house faster than he expects to. There is a pull-down ladder in the broom closet. The reality of confronting Draco seems to clear his head.
“I’m covered in coffee, and this shirt was fucking expensive,” Draco bites. “So no, not really.”
“Mr Draco Malfoy bears the complementary magical core to your own,” Ethel says reluctantly. Harry thinks he must be hallucinating. “If I could change the fact that your soulmate is a Death Eater, it would be the first thing that I would do.”
, I’m effectively cancelling my subscription.” Pansy rolled her eyes.
Harry was the Golden Boy in every aspect. People were so endeared that he loved gardening and working with his hands in the outdoors. They loved that he was a man in every sense of the word. Big, brawny, and radiating with energy. He entered a room and captured its attention with the most modest of smiles.
When he’s finally Apparated into the foyer of Grimmauld Place and hung up his raincoat and umbrella on the rack to dry, he puts a hole through the wall in the hallway. His fist comes back brown and bloody, and Harry feels guilty just looking at it. His hand hurts as he flexes it experimentally, but he doesn’t much care to make use of a Healing Charm. The constant throbbing feels like a familiar friend, especially in his line of duty.
“Harry, I’m miserable!” Draco shouted, tears leaking from his eyes and down the sides of his cheek like a small child. “I miss being around people, and you cooping me up in this house like a fucking animal isn’t helping me.”
“You don’t need to thank me,” he says. “I did what I thought was right.”
“Go,” Harry said, and there was an authoritative undertone in his voice that made Ron listen. He stood warily from his seat and dropped his portion of the file into Harry’s lap.
“Yeah, no shit,” Harry mutters, dusting off his robes and making for the elevators empty-handed. He’s barely thinking of what excuse to use on Ron in regard to where his coffee is.
“What is it?” Harry asks cautiously. He’s not sure he’s ready to snort anything foreign and somehow fail a Ministry drug test.
“Mr Potter, I unfortunately cannot try again. To reach back into your magical core would be too dangerous at this point. I am certain of the name.” Ethel fidgets against the desk, as though she’d rather be anywhere in the entire world than in the room with Harry.
“Well, It’s Wednesday,” Draco alleged, but stood as well, matching Harry’s gaze and stature.
Draco shook his head, mischief glinting in his eyes. “I forgot them.”
Harry swallows, feeling a lump grow in his dry throat. He’s not sure right now, or ever, is the best time to inform Draco of their unfortunate predicament. But they’re close now, physically, and Harry feels like a small pressing weight has been lifted from his chest.
Claude licks his paw, eyeing Harry and his bleeding hand warily.
Harry nods.
As much as he tries to hide it, he can’t help how his eye is drawn to three long and red scars that tear open the otherwise spotless skin of her cheek. One runs deep and rough, just across her eye.
Harry breaks his gaze from his shoes and looks into her eyes. They are so much like Draco’s; Harry’s heart begins to pound. “I-uh, I appreciate that.” He steadies, finding his voice, owing Draco’s mother the respect of an even tone. “If I could change everything, I would in a heartbeat.”
The cutting
Pansy holds her hands up in surrender. “I’m going to take Theo to the bathroom. Yell out if Potter tries to murder you.”
“I had some ideas for today, actually —”
with small fondant serpents moving about the surface. Draco would, no doubt, find it a little tacky. But if he knew it was Ginny’s doing, he wouldn’t dare complain.
Harry only gazes at the boy in his lap, tears blurring his vision. He can’t focus, this is
“But you’d trust me?” Harry watched as Draco rolled the green powder into a waxy paper, and then rolled a few more.
Shacklebolt cleared his throat into the silence, and if it was even possible, everyone straightened up a little more.
Harry dragged him inside, and Draco protested the whole way until he was thrown unceremoniously into bed.
Harry frowns. “Of course it’s not to me.”
Locke nodded eagerly, as though he were excited at the words.
“Hi,” he said, as though Harry’s heart hadn’t nearly given out in the waiting room.
“Alright,” Harry said unsteadily, reaching for his desk’s edge to ground himself back into reality. “Ready?”
Harry makes a noise, “Merlin, yes. But if I’m buying, you’re clipping Claude’s nails when we get home. I will
“Oh,” Harry says knowingly. He puts a hand reassuringly over Draco’s own. It’s cold. “I wasn’t either, if it helps.”
“You’re cutting fruit.”
Harry took his hand, and the pulsing blackness of Apparition whisked them away.
“Why would someone do this?” Harry asks pointlessly, as though neither of them knows the answer.
No one else would have made a statement like that for fear of upsetting Draco, but he appreciated that Ginny treated him quite normally. After all, they both knew Narcissa was stationed safely in Norway tending to a beautiful garden and spending her free time with a herd of purebred Granian horses. She was happy with her quiet existence, and Draco was even happier for her. She deserved it after a lifetime of misery.
“For?”
“I can’t imagine why,” Ginny said dryly, but she clutched tighter to his wrist as though he was going to disappear.
Harry was on the precipice. Just at the edge, waiting to be pushed right over.
“I can’t stop now.” His voice was barely above a whisper when he said it. “I have nothing else.”
Harry wanted to point out that it was their parents who caused the war in the first place but found himself disinterested in arguing with Zabini over the past mistakes. It was true that everyone had lost a part of themselves in the war, and the Slytherins were no different.
They take seats on the far side of the couch, next to where Ron and Charlie are trying to squeeze themselves both into what has been deemed the best armchair in the room.
“Play nice,” she warns the two of them, before closing the door loudly behind her.
Draco fought the urge to reach out an arm and place it protectively over the length of Harry’s back.
Draco’s newfound confidence only bolstered Carrow’s own. He grinned widely at the sudden provocation.
“A bit intimidating, isn’t it?” Blaise chuckles.
Harry swallowed back a hard lump in his throat because Draco couldn’t begin to understand the weight of his own words.
He had a stubborn resolve that was threatened by no one and nothing. That had changed.
“I worry about you. Honestly, I worry about you both. Something’s not right here, and I wish you two would just talk to me. Or anyone!”
“Steady there,” Ginny said softly, but there was a silent anger to her words. “Look at you.”
“I am,” Harry says. He notices a glass of water is already on the nightstand, bringing it up to Draco’s lips and tipping his head back with care.
“Look at you, though,” Draco says, in awe, taking a step back to twirl Harry in a circle. “We’re getting married.”
“Not like this, Draco,” he says, taking a purposeful step back and running a hand through his messy hair.
A thin smile touched Harry’s lips, but there wasn’t any warmth behind it. His eyes were tired and grey like they’d lost colour overnight. Draco settled at the table with the paper as Harry prepared their tea. It was a morning ritual they’d grown accustomed to even before their marriage had started to crumble. Harry sat across from him moments later, holding out a fragrant cup for Draco to take.
He doesn’t question it as they exit, Pansy walking over slowly to speak with Narcissa, who wraps them both into familiar, albeit slightly uncomfortable, hugs.
He lets out a loud and lengthy moan as Harry cuts him off, beginning to slide in and out, gently burying himself deeper inside Draco with every thrust.
Harry smiled, a genuine thing that lit up his face and the green in his eyes like a lantern. He nodded.
Still, even knowing that his husband was busy with his hands, Draco locked the door when he changed. He wasn’t sure when he’d become so uncomfortable with his body, but he was plagued by the existence of it at every passing minute.
“Let’s start with some breakfast,” Harry decides.
“He was leaving you last night…” Ron said slowly, processing Harry’s words. “And now he’s not? Just like that?”
“Ron, move up,” Hermione says, irritated, from behind him.
She shook her head in amusement. “Please don’t apologise. You know you’re always welcome here!”
He’d relapsed at the end of February, and Harry remembers getting angry.
“So you’re saying I look like a survivor of the Great Famine.” Draco frowned, took a moment, and then lobbed a half-eaten danish at her in response.
“God, forgive me.” Harry gasped for a breath, tears streaking down his cheeks.
Draco never usually maintained many boundaries when it came to sex. He and Harry had always danced along the line of vanilla and kinky, straying into either territory as their moods suggested. If Draco were honest with himself, he’d let his husband do just about anything with him if he asked. If he just
He blinks though, pausing on the thought. “For every few bad highs, there are exceptional ones.”
Harry knew that the only reason Hermione knew so much about the program was because the second she’d found out about it, she had gone and purchased an entire shelf of books to familiarise herself with the concept. He often wondered if maybe he should’ve done a little more research on the subject too. If anything, so he wouldn't seem so clueless on the matter.
“I do,” Narcissa says sharply. “Harry, you and Draco were never friends, so this is something that you will never understand about him. The more he is chased, the faster he runs away.”
Harry blinks, and then like a miracle, he remembers. “I do.”
“I don’t know if you mean to, or actually think the rest of the world is oblivious to what is going on. I honestly can’t tell you which would be worse.”
“What do we do now?” Malfoy asked, turning himself back to Harry after surveying his surroundings. “What’s next in your grand plan?”
“You’re welcome to take your helpfulness somewhere else,” Draco says, sitting back against the wall and smacking the toilet lid closed. It makes a loud noise that sends gooseflesh down the length of Harry’s arm.
She shuffled out then, with Ron and Mrs Weasley on her heels.
When Harry brings their items back to the table, Draco wrinkles his nose. He takes the lid off of the cup to inspect the drink.
She quirks an eyebrow in response. “Go out there, Harry. Do something that makes you happy.”
to an arbitrary page.
“Shit,” Draco curses quietly, as Luna draws up her wand and lights the candles around the arch.
The Draco from before the potion would have sold the story to the
Seamus and Parvati had tracked a few operations running out of Knockturn, to which Harry had suppressed a heart attack, though eventually, nothing fruitful came of their undercover work.
Harry sits up, breathing out shakily, as he wrestles his own pants down. He doesn’t even need to touch himself, his cock already straining up, eager against his stomach.
On weekends, Draco would always excuse himself to the bedroom before dinner just to avoid conversation. And Harry would let him, despite worrying about Draco’s weight and if he was really eating enough. It was clear that, usually, he was not. The Draco across from the table, though, groaned into his fork at the first bite, and Harry grinned. He never needed validation to know he was a good cook, but it never went amiss.
“Oli, I like this one!” One crowed, “Can we keep him? Please, Dad!”
It takes a little more coaxing, but Harry’s able to cajole Draco out of bed. He dresses in the bathroom, in a pair of nice trousers and an oversized jumper. On Harry, the outfit would look unkempt, but Draco, of course, manages to pull it off. Harry doesn’t think he really understands what the word ‘chic’ means, but this is definitely a look that Blaise and Ginny would deem so.
“Please, I’m asking you not to do it again,” Draco warned, his breathing turning shallow.
“Your idea of spending time together was stalking me out to a pub?” Harry asked incredulously, voice raising in pitch.
“You’re right, Harry. We, well I, haven’t necessarily been trying to make this work as much as I should. I owe it to you to do better.”
He’s grown to care for Draco’s well being in a way that he knows is separate from the fact that they are soulmates. It had been a bit of an abrupt realisation, but an important one all the same. Whether he likes it or not, Draco meant, and would always mean, something to him. If an overdose were to happen again, Harry wouldn’t know what to do with himself.
” He repeated faintly. Harry thought his tone really bore a resemblance to Hermione at the moment. “Anyway, I’m interested in Muggle education.”
Harry despises how much the comment stings.
“S’my name,” Harry mumbles incoherently.
“Nope. Owl had the wrong address, I think.”
Harry wanted the words back, the moment he had said them.
Stripping off his clothes for a shower was the next challenge in a morning full of many.
Harry kisses him again, this time fast and messy, lips catching roughly on teeth, fingernails digging painfully into skin. He presses Draco further into the mattress; it squeals in protest at the extra pressure. Harry slides on top, his breath hot and heavy against Draco’s neck.
“This would happen to us,” Harry shouts above the noise. He looks around to his friends, joy in their faces, soaked wet down to their boots.
“I have an hour. Fancy some lunch at the Leaky?” Ginny asked, readjusting bags of decorations on her hip.
Pansy looks hard-pressed to leave them in the room together, but to Harry’s surprise, she does as he requested of her without a fuss.
“It’s so very nice to meet you, Harry.” Portrait Draco says back, puffing his shoulders out dramatically. Pureblood kids are such a type, he chuckles to himself.
He steels himself before the door for the second time that night, wondering why Draco couldn’t have just made this easier on him by staying at the Manor like he damn well was expected to. But Harry supposes after spending a year under house arrest, one might grow tired of the same surroundings. Maybe that’s why he chose to live in such an eccentric place, in a quiet and residential part of town. There’s not much excitement in Hampstead. Mostly families and the occasional tourist. But it’s not the liveliest after hours, by any means.
“Thanks, Pans.”
Five excruciating minutes pass before Draco takes his first proper breath. Pansy weeps, and Harry feels like he needs to as well, but he sits back on the floor, letting his burning arms down to rest for a moment. Draco’s chest is beginning to purple after the pressure, and Harry worries that he might have broken a few bones. Either way, he’ll take it over the alternative.
Harry rolls his eyes. “How on earth am
He backed into the corner of the room, and Harry advanced without realising what he was doing. Something in his blood was burning, thrumming through his body like a high he’d never felt before.
“Just friends.” Lavender smiles gently. “Soulmates, but we’ve decided to keep it platonic. We love each other, of course, but it’ll never be romantic.”
“You did last night,” Harry says, upset, and then he regrets the words instantly. It’s like a mask slams down over Draco’s features. The side of him that was open to listening and understanding what Harry has to say seems to be entirely gone.
Relief followed like a tidal wave, and Draco breathed out an alleviated sigh for the welcome sensation of absolutely nothing going on in his head.
“Oi!” he yelped.
“I came to see you,” Harry says truthfully, because he’s never been the best at lying and something tells him Draco will notice that.
“What?” Harry asked irately. “What did I do?”
Harry narrowed his eyes and tried, in his least accusing tone, to answer.  “And that is relevant, how?”
He gives Draco’s hand a light, comforting squeeze and pulls away as Hermione opens the door with a beaming smile.
“You don’t believe in a God?” Harry asks although he knows he doesn’t either.
Of course, there was a good reason.
Harry sat up, taking some of the lube from the bowl and circled slowly around Draco’s entrance. Draco had moved up to meet him, and their chests were pressed together as Harry’s slick finger slid in carefully. He left it there for a moment, allowing Draco to get accustomed to the feeling. His grey eyes were wild with pleasure and desire, and Harry could come right there. Draco looked beautiful, so willing. He pumped in and out a few times, after adding more fingers until Draco was stretched and whimpering around him.
Then, Draco’s heart leapt at the idea that the thistle could be working.
Their fights were usually screaming matches that ended with whoever could be the loudest. Something about the silent animosity characterising the room was more chilling.
“I’ve instructed her not to. She was far too distressed to call me Narcissa, though, so we’ve come to a fair compromise.”
“Mrs Weasley, thank you so much for having me.” Draco bows his head, politely, playing with his fingers. “I don’t usually spend Christmas with my...family anymore, and I really appreciate it.”
,” Draco says it back to him with equal fervor. “I love you.”
“Mate, I saw this coming from a mile away,” Ron said, shaking his head in amusement as Harry held back from releasing unbridled fury out into The Burrow’s calm Sunday brunch atmosphere.
Draco wrinkles his nose, a stray tear slipping down his cheek. He wipes it away quickly. “Pinky promise?”
listen in though, following Azalea’s affirmations and self-reflections as she continues with the group. When it’s time to share, he is surprised to see Ollie offer to go first.
He had returned to his job at Gringotts, and they had welcomed him back with open arms. He had been one of their best.
“I spent years trying to forget who I used to be. It was like the second I discovered how drugs made me feel, I knew that was the best way I could get past everything that had happened,” Draco says, his gaze focused on the ground. “I wasted much of my time feeling sorry for myself and taking all kinds of things to forget that I existed, that a version of myself like that ever did exist.
“I didn’t hear you come in.” Harry met Ron’s grin with one of his own. “Can I put you to work?” He held out an extra pair of shears, and Ron took them begrudgingly.
Draco beckoned him closer, and a wave of relief slowly crested through Harry’s chest. He knew Draco would never forgive him, but he also knew he wouldn’t be Harry if he didn’t at least hope for such an outcome.
The pain throbbed persistently, outstretching tendrils of feeling into his head, but it didn’t worsen at its recognition of Draco’s strong intent.
“Something’s wrong here,” Ron said, walking up to meet Harry at the entrance.
Harry yelped, swatting Ron’s hand away just as it reached towards a red flower. “Ron, not the flowers! The
Harry shrugged his shoulders noncommittally, and Malfoy made a face.
Harry takes a steadying breath before he speaks, knowing that what he wants to ask could push Draco away entirely. But he can’t deny now that he cares for Draco’s well-being. Not only as a soulmate, but as a concerned friend, as well. He wants Draco to be okay.
After an entirely too uncomfortable elevator ride with Susan Silverberry, a stout woman and the head of the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, they make it to the right floor. Harry’s grateful that he and Ron have their own office in times like these. He was embarrassed by it at first, the obvious favouritism he’s shown each and every day in comparison to his colleagues out in the bullpen. But, before anyone can notice, he and Draco are swiftly behind a closed door, and Harry lets out a breath.
After swallowing another glass of Firewhisky, he set to work on cleaning. The bag from Madam Odessa’s bakery sat inconspicuously on the counter, moved to the side as if it had been forgotten about. Immediately Harry reached for it, realising he’d absentmindedly left a few choice items inside. Thankfully, if anyone had seen anything, they wouldn’t question it much. It wasn’t uncommon for survivors of the war to take a little Dreamless Sleep once in a while if necessary.
“It’s early,” he says, nodding his head to the grandfather clock by the doorway. “I didn’t expect you to be up.”
He wasn’t interested in plants like Harry was, and wondered why Neville bothered to try with him anyway.
And Draco did think about it. He knew a part of his husband had probably died the day he discovered Draco’s body in their bed.
“I’m not going to accompany you back to your room, Harry. I’m not your caretaker. This is becoming a bit of a habit.” Draco narrowed his eyes, but his hands never pulled away.
