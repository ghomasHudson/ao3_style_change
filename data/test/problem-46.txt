"Wyatt Halliwell, I swear," Piper muttered, grabbing a damp rag from the table top and running it lightly over the tray.
"Call me by name or do not speak to me. We have known each other long enough, have we not?"
"I didn't know about that. I mean, I read the books, so yeah…"
Before he could stop himself, Draco let out another full-body shudder.
All Draco knew was that it felt very nice to kiss Harry, and it felt very nice to sleep with the warmth of another body next to him, and all of that led him to thoughts of other things that might be very nice…
"Fuck you, Crabbe, fuck you, Goyle, and you, Parkinson? You can go fuck yourself! Hell, you can fuck Zabini for all I care!" With that and a swoop of his robes, Draco left the great hall. Pansy collapsed, weeping, against the brown-haired boy while Crabbe and Goyle stared at each other in confusion.
"I don't want to. I'm drunk and I'm pretty sure you're not real."
Draco cleared his throat again to attract the man's attention. Once he had it Draco gave Phoebe a significant look and she closed the book and stepped back.
"Okay, fine," she said, "He's interested. What does that mean?"
She nodded then walked over to the red headed woman, offering her a damp towel.
When he awoke he was lying on a blanket in the hallway outside the hospital wing. He shifted, relieved to find that his ribs didn't hurt anymore, though the phantom pain from Chris's death still lingered.
Severus replied, "Potter happened. Again."
But the fever had broken on the fourth night. Now the man was just sleeping, and so was Harry, one hand still clasped in his, head resting on the worn mattress.
Paige jumped in, "It doesn't have anything to do with Wyatt though, we think."
From the shadows, Paige heard a sharp cough.
As the sun rose, the Gryffindor finally took a shuddering breath and turned to Severus.
"Fine. We'll go to the address, but I want you two to keep your senses on high. Harry tends to go off on tangents and he could be anywhere."
Blaise leered, "Lovely cock, but he's a complete Nellie bottom."
He found the blond tucked behind a suit of armor, resting his forehead against the cool stone wall.
Harry's shirt was covered in blood, but Severus could see that it wasn't his and he breathed little digh of relief. Hermione said the boy had a death wish, but so far e remained uninjured. Severus wasn't sure whether that was due to Harry's efforts, or those of his team, but either way he thanked is lucky stars.
Severus turned his attention to his drink as he replied. "So someone will die. We may hope that it will be Voldemort and those who serve him, but we have no guarantees. All we can do is live well, fight well, and if necessary, die well."
Draco shook his head, then saw the red head's eyes narrow. Knowing his silence would not be enough this time, Draco said, "I have no name."
Phoebe nodded. "Yeah, I guess so. I mean Draco went to get Ron, so yeah."
She held her hands up, facing him. She wasn't holding a wand, and in the light tank top and shorts she was wearing she would have to be very creative to hide it, so he bit back the curses, took a deep breath, and tugged the blanket a little further up across his chest.
All three of them looked at each other and then at him and Harry had a very eerie feeling.
Ethereal, unreal, like an angel, or a fairy,
Draco grabbed the knapsack from Paige and took it with him to the couch. Methodically the blond began taking the contents out, listing each item as he came across it.
Both bags over her shoulder, Paige paused before orbing out of the house. If Draco was upset he might want to get out of the house for a while, join them at the zoo. If nothing else it would be a good distraction for him.
Severus sighed. "I'm not entirely sure what's happening," Severus said. He looked over a Draco who was sitting in his old seat on the rug in front of the fire.
Phoebe giggled lightly. Paige wanted to roll her eyes again, but she thought it would be redundant. The white lighter couldn't be older than eighteen if he was a day, dressed in nice slacks and a button down shirt, and Phoebe was… Phoebe was staring at his ass.
Draco looked for the truth in Severus's eyes and saw it.
"Behind you," Piper screamed, and Paige turned around, throwing the first vial she could reach at the hulking demon coming through the torn out hole in the wall.
Harry heard someone snicker behind him and he turned to see the woman who had pushed past him in the delivery room.
Now Harry wanted to ask if any of it was real. The Malfoy he remembered from third year had been a complete bastard. A pointy git who cared more about his family's reputation than anything else.
Harry didn't have a response so Paige kept silent, starting the car back up and turning onto the road. They traveled the rest of the way to the nightclub without speaking and when they got there Paige left Harry in the car as she ran in, got the opening manager to get her a bottle of champagne from the locked cooler, and ran back out.
No sooner did he speak than the wall turned fiery red and blew inward.
Draco let a spark of hope build, then tamped it fiercely. "It doesn't matter anyway. He's as straight as a ruler."
"No," Paige said. "It's just that I don't know anyone else who can say something that melodramatic with a straight face." She adjusted the thick straps of the diaper bags before continuing. "Though there are a few demons who could give you guys a run for your money in the long winded purple prose competition."
"Dammit, boy. Eat or I'll make you eat."
He turned to face Severus and his relief faded. Though the man was more physically relaxed there were lines of tension on his face, and he was still absently rubbing his forearm.
Draco knew his nurse was asleep, so he kept his voice down as he took a seat. "I heard… I'm not sure what I heard. His bride? My mother? What madness is this?"
He felt the cook's eyes rake over his fur covered form, taking in the ash and soot that covered any skin exposed to the light.
He looked towards the back of the Hall when he saw it, a deep malevolent red glow beginning in the center of the stones and moving outward until it enflamed the entire wall. He had just enough time to grab Harry's shoulder before the world exploded.
On the last couch by the door, he found a pile of robes, neatly folded. In the dark room, he couldn't see the design, but that he felt embroidery at all meant they were Draco's.
"I don't know, maybe he was in a hurry. There is a war on, you know," Paige answered.
Paige steeped forward, steadying herself against Severus quickly, "I'm Paige Halliwell. I've been dragging your blond over there to this club for the past few months but he never let us meet."
Severus raised a questioning eyebrow at his godson and was answered with a blinding grin.
A head of platinum blond hair rested on the mattress next to him, and Severus patted the bed next to Draco lightly to see if he would wake.
But in the bright light of the morning both looked better. Severus looked well-rested and the half empty cup of tea and completely empty plate in front of him meant his stomach had settled.
"Would you like that Bearskin? Would you be happy in the kitchens? I must warn you it gets hot and my cook is temperamental."
"Bearskin."
The pink blush that had never faded now flared into a vivid red. "It's not the blood. I mean, it is the blood, but it's not just the blood. There was the screaming and the pain and-" And now the red turned green and Paige quickly guided Harry back to his chair, pushing his head down between his knees and motioning for Phoebe to get a glass of water.
The man looked up at Draco, then again at the book. "I'm taking notes. What does it look like?"
Piper gasped. "Not good. They can take power from any witch?"
Paige nodded.
"Fine, husband, whatever. But why are you smiling Paige?"
Intellectually he knew the blond was the one who brought him here in the first place, but in all the confusion and horror of the events after his arrival he had forgotten.
"What are you doing, love?"
The shutters protecting the room from the storm outside slammed against the wall. As Harry went to latch them tightly, he saw a pale form crumpled against the stone wall on the balcony.
Harry's grin turned more sincere as he set the glass on the table and rose to follow her.
Seamus, talking to Dean at the end of the table, found himself caught in Hermione's assessing stare, as she spoke to Ron. "And how does he know?"
In the alley behind the club, he leaned against the wall and tried to catch his breath.
Severus could hear the bitterness in Harry's voice turning rapidly to tears, so he cut him off.
Both Severus and Harry turned as there was a knock at the door. Severus couldn't help but wonder what it was this time as he walked to his door and released he wards.
"You shouldn't be out here, Draco, it's only going to get worse."
"I'm glad that was so entertaining for you. And how was I supposed to know anyway? It isn't that I'd had so much experience with alcohol before. Muggle or wizarding."
He dropped his spoon into the curry, sending thick droplets of gravy across the white tablecloth as he pressed his hands to his ears, hunching his back and curling into himself.
Somewhere under the pounding of her blood in her ears, Blaise's constant stream of profanity, and Phoebe's low and cheery mumbling she thought she heard the shimmering sound of an orb, but she couldn't look up.
Harry, I have to go. Pom has me on second shift in the infirmary."
Draco shifted again and Paige's attention was drawn back to him. She took the opportunity to tuck the towel Severus was holding out under his head.
Harry was going to be sick. He knew it.
When they got there Draco could see that things had changed drastically.
"He's not your anything, nephew. Calm down." Spike's voice was steady.
When they arrived in Poppy's domain, they saw that they were not the only ones in need of help. Every bed was full and several conjured pallets floated along the hallways, filled with injured students, injured soldiers.
Still, the potion's master said nothing and Chris went on.
So, that's the sad ending. The true story is of an octaroon (a mixed-race woman) and a white man in New Orleans, a long time ago, Julie and Zachary. She fell in love with him and wanted a wedding, but he couldn't marry her, so they lived together as lovers. But it hurt her, she wanted to marry the man she loved, and society stood against them. One night, there was a violent storm and she said if she could weather nature's storm, then the two of them could weather society's opinion of their love. So, while Zachary was downstairs playing cards, she stripped off and went onto the balcony of their love nest. A few hours later, he came up and found her there, dead, and he died shortly thereafter.
Shaking free of her sister's grasp, Paige shook her head and took a deep breath, "What the heck is going on?"
"Oh yeah, it went great," Paige said. "We kicked their butts."
"Hey! Cole was different," Phoebe jumped into the fight.
And youth.
"That's why I go so late. By now they're all half in the bag and they don't much care whether the bloke on the next couch is a Griffindor, a Ravenclaw, or a giant squid as long as he can hold his drink."
"You know, Dragon, you are very lucky. You're the only person I have in my life, but you seem to attract caretakers and friends wherever you go. In Hogwarts you were surrounded, though I would call your peer group at the time more 'lackeys' or 'minions' than friends, and now you have a new family. I am so happy for you, and so proud of the man you're becoming, and I'd like to get to know him."
Unfortunately, at some point in their background check, they failed to discover that the club had changed ownership, and its target audience, and its name… to THE MEAT MARKET.
Twice a week, the crowds were a little better behaved than the usual bunch of maniacs. They minded their hands with the dancers and servers, were courteous to the performers and each other, tipped well, and didn't cause trouble.
Draco paled, an extraordinary accomplishment for the boy. "Is it time? I mean—"
Draco nodded and stood to follow them. He had no weapons and he could not use his rank as a prince to argue. Once again he was carried along by fate.
One month later Harry looked back on that night fondly.
Severus saw the brief shimmer of light reflecting off of matching gold bands before the three men left the dim and echoing room for the neon bright, smoke-filled, maelstrom beyond.
"Draco, you have to leave Harry and come with us. All of this has gone dreadfully wrong."
The three bickering brunettes approached, and Paige was tempted to follow Spike into the cellar where there would at least be peace and quiet.
The vampire sighed, an ostentatious gesture for a creature that didn't normally breathe, and said, "Kid's name is Harry Potter. On a mission for The Order of the Big Sodding Bird. Bloke behind me with the sour face and pointy piece of wood is Severus Snape. The child in the corner is Chris. We need Potter's help."
The unfamiliar red head was sporting a blush as bright as his hair but he looked down at Blaise and the baby with proud tears in his eyes.
Now, if you don't love the angst, head on up to the next chapter, while I make things a little happier
"No, it won't work. I tried."
The sensation of the blond's hair brushing his cheek and his hot breath against his neck took his attention away from the events in the room though he was vaguely aware of Phoebe shouting something. The nearness of the blond that haunted his thoughts for months was beginning to bring up the problem Harry thought had faded when he heard a familiar and irritated voice.
"I don't- What?"
Now Draco heard the king sigh. "I am doing what my wife wished. In her last moment she told me to find someone to love, just like her. Is there any other so like my Narcissa?" There was a pause, then Lucius said, "I will take your silence to be assent. You will see, Snape, this is how the universe has rewarded me. They have given me my bride back. Now leave me."
"Now, I notice you come from England , not that it wasn't obvious with the sexy accent and all," Harry blushed lightly as Alex went on, "but why did you move to the states?"
"I know. It's hard though, since he's in a whole other country. All we can contribute is financially."
Shannon grinned and took the bags off of Paige's shoulder, setting them on the coffee table. "I think I like you kid. I bet you're good for my baby boy."
Harry dodged an Avada and some purple curse, but a Cutting Curse got through his faltering Protego and hit his shoulder. He felt his grip on his wand weaken and quickly shifted it to his other hand, silently thanking Snape for their private dueling lessons as he knocked out two of the three guards.
"I'm sure he'll be fine. Chris and Severus know what they're doing," Piper affirmed.
Behind it he found Harry.
Closely studying the blond for the first time since the night they met, Paige saw more than a passing resemblance between the vampire and their missing white lighter.
He worked as quickly and quietly as he could. If the weapon was inside, and there was no chance it wasn't, it would be well guarded. Voldemort was insane, but he had never been stupid.
"You took your time, Potter."
"It wasn't like that," Harry said. "I mean, I have to-"
The closer she got to the argument, the better she could hear it, and the more she wished she had just turned around and gone back to bed when she had the chance.
Sensing the tension in the room despite her lack of powers, Phoebe spoke, "Come on Piper, you know you deserved that. And Paige, at least eat something. If you drink that on an empty stomach you'll get sick."
"Come on, baby, one more. It's a tight fit, but—"
Again that bitter laugh and Severus began to wonder if Harry wasn't, in fact, spending a bit too much time with Spike's husband.
Suddenly the pendulum stopped on the map and both Chris and Draco leaned in over the map.
Harry was puzzled at the smirk on the other man's face.
"Lucius, he is your son. I know you are in pain, and I know you believe this is a solution, but you cann-"
"This is where your source is?"
Rubbing a hand over his face, Draco frowned as it came away dusty, covered in some dark dirt-like substance. Normally he showered right after a vanquish, but maybe he had been too tired…
When she got back into the car she saw Harry staring out the window again. He looked somber, but his eyes were clear and she hoped that whatever decision he made would be the right one.
"Harry what? I understood he was going to California today. I expected him to be dancing in the stars right now."
But Paige had heard enough, sparing a glare of her own for Piper and Phoebe, she turned to the vampire, "Nephew?"
Paige winced at the harsh shouts, and then again as something hard hit a wall.
"It doesn't matter? How can it not matter? You're in lo—" Blaise stopped, wincing and rubbing his stomach softly before continuing. "You're in love with him," the pregnant brunet finished, grimacing.
Draco shifted upright and saw both Pansy and Blaise looking at him expectantly.
Draco wasn't on the front steps where the two of them had been earlier, and Harry only hoped the blond man hadn't left the castle. Digging the Marauder's Map out of his robes, he tapped it and waited for his lovers name to appear.
"What happened here," Pomphrey asked.
When Harry pulled back he was pouting, and Draco melted.
A spirit of mischief entered his heart and Draco took out the suit the color of the night sky and made his way to the pumphouse by the stables. Washing away the soot and ash of his work from his skin, Draco caught a glimpse of himself in the shining surface of the washtub. He was pale, no sun had touched him since he came to the castle, and his hair had grown long and soft, braided tightly at the back of his head most days. Unbraiding it Draco gasped as it fell to a shining river of silver to the middle of his back.
Wake up.
"And where is Harry?"
Draco POV
The blond opened his mouth, but before he said anything Harry swung around a punishing hit to the face that knocked Draco to the ground.
Draco laughed. "Unfortunately you have and it was almost enough to put me off the idea entirely. Besides, should you be talking like that in front of the child," he said, pointing to the baby who had fisted his tiny hand in Blaise's pajama shirt.
"Look, I know who Harry is and I know who you are. All of you as a matter of fact, you're in our magical history books-"
And so he charged.
Still, out of her great love for her husband, she kindled a babe within her and carried it.
"Stop."
The tattooed and pierced red head standing on the other side leered at Harry, "Those make for great sensation, mate." Then the man ran his tongue over his plump bottom lip and the snake fang rings that pierced it.
Paige looked over at Draco. He was resting quietly, but deep furrows in his brow and quiet muttered whimpers indicated that all was not well in the young whitelighter's mind.
"I'm your boss," Alex replied.
Draco nodded dumbly, then leaned in and pressed his mouth against Potter's.
Paige turned and saw Ron standing in the doorway, the baby still in his arms.
Draco woke to the feeling of warmth, a sensation he had forgotten out on the balcony in the storm. Warmth and the weight of something on his chest. Looking down he saw a tanned arm draped over his body, and attached to it was a head of tousled black hair.
"You don't understand," he said, "He may look older, but he's actually—"
"See Ron, I told you it wasn't a bear." the voice was gentle enough, but Draco couldn't focus. He just wanted to be left alone.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Gryffindor broke out into a grin and Severus had to bite back a smile of his own in response.
The dark advisor smiled slightly, or perhaps the habitual shadow of irritation and sorrow lightened from his face for a moment as he said, "Your father is dead, Draco. His council betrayed him, but in the moment before he died he regained himself and declared you free and safe."
"So, do you want a lifetime with Harry or not," Shannon asked.
She felt a blush rise, but it fell away quickly as Blaise regained his grip on her still-captured hand and squeezed tightly. Paige looked for Phoebe so her sister could take up the hand-holding, but the brown-eyed brunette had taken a place by Blaise's head, counting out breaths and mumbling encouraging phrases while meticulously avoiding the sight of anything below the heavy bulge of the boy's stomach.
The blond let himself lean into her embrace, absorbing the warmth of her body and smiling. It felt good to be loved, to be in love.
"You're the one who doesn't understand, Severus. None of that matters. Draco has been acting and making decisions as an adult for years. I don't know a lot about his childhood, but I've seen the way he acts and I honestly doubt he had much of one at all."
Harry moved out from behind the curtains, leaving the invisibility cloak on the floor, but marking it's location in his head so he would be able to find it again.
Severus turned to Chris and the young brunette shrugged before grabbing him around the waist. The world disappeared in a shower of blue light.
"…mean, he hit me."
As he moved he felt the soft brush of the blanket against his skin, taking a moment to peer under the green fuzzy thing, he could feel a hot flush flood his cheeks. They'd stripped him.
Inside they found Severus and Piper crouched over an unconscious Draco on the floor while Wyatt cried in his highchair.
But the truth was, in that moment, he had no idea.
He reached out to caress the beloved face when the figure stepped back and bowed respectfully.
"Do you know?"
Unfortunately this gave the other two time to loop around and come in behind him and the next thing Harry knew he was being attacked on all four sides. Sheer panic bolstered his shields, but he knew that would only lat so long, and though the two injured Death Eaters were now weaker, Harry wasn't sure he would be able to defeat all four of them.
The next few days passed in a haze for Severus. Harry was almost an inferi. He woke screaming and weeping from nightmares every few hours, and the time he spent awake he was in a cold and shocky state. After those first few words Harry hadn't said anything about Draco or events in California.
Paige, seeing what her sister was up to, stood as well, trying to hide Draco from Blaise's sight wither her body. The heavily pregnant brunet didn't need any stress, and this was a very stressful situation.
Draco shook her off. "You tried. Half witch, half white lighter. I'm full white lighter and I have more healing power than you. Help me if you wish, but do not try to stop me."
A pregnant silence followed, each man picturing an endless, frozen future, one with hope that his protégé would never age, never die, and the other with dread of those same things.
Severus had spent too many nights staring deep into a glass of Firewhiskey, hoping for answers or at least a peaceful sleep. And getting neither.
"I can't Draco. I wish I could- wish we lived in a world where I could be with you, boy or not, Slytherin or not, Death Eater or not. But I don't. We don't."
Lucius embraced his son briefly, then left him to sleep. The next day, Draco's birthday, they would be wed and then he would have his bride again.
Snape was already there, waiting in his favorite chair, a threadbare green wingback kept a foot closer to the raging fire than Harry thought was safe, but the Potions master always said he was cold. The man had a brandy snifter resting in his palm, but Harry could see the strain in his knuckles around the delicate glass.
They were empty.
"Who is she?"
"Severus was here?"
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and thought about it. But he already knew what his answer would be.
Phoebe, recovered, glared at the vampire, and Paige said, "We can't think about this now. We need to figure out where Draco went and get him back. Fifteen, eighteen, or one hundred and two, he's our white lighter, and he's upset, and he could be anywhere.  Spike, you and Draco are friends, make a list of people he knows, or where he might have gone. Phoebe, you can scry for him. His jacket might still be in the closet, maybe there will be something there you can use. Piper, you can help Phoebe."
Paige and Chris combined their skills. She had more natural whitelighter energy, including some healing power, but he had more knowledge of how to use it, so together they first evaluated Draco and found out he was mostly just drained and heartsick. He would recover with rest and quiet.
"I was talking to Shannon. She asked me if I wanted- and I told her…" Draco's voice trailed off and when he looked up at Severus and Paige the tears that were threatening to fall had fallen, leaving thick trails down his pale cheeks.
Harry held up a hand and the Slytherin stopped.
"Yeah Gin, you guys sent the potion just in time." Harry smiled.
"What," Harry replied, shaken out of his thoughts by the boy.
Taking a few deep appreciative breaths, Draco called out, "So what's on the menu tonight?"
(See the end of the chapter for
There was no clear border line in the forest and Draco opened his mouth to argue it, then closed it again. No peasant would know about the borders, which meant the green eyed boy and his angry companion were nobles at least, and if Draco argued they might suspect his rank as well and return him to his father.
Together they drove back to the house and when they walked in they saw an impromptu party. Draco and Chris were back with Neville, Hermione, Spike, and Xander. Loud music was playing throughout the living room and kitchen and Ron and the baby were nowhere in sight.
Paige opened her mouth, then closed it again.
Paige snorted. "He's the chicken? You spent the entire time behind Blaise with your eyes clamped shut."
Piper looked relieved, and with a final caress over Draco's white-blond hair, she got up and went to Wyatt.
Gritting her teeth through a full body shiver of disgust at her own lusty bad thoughts, Paige watched Phoebe do the same.
And even thinking that he snorted and wiped away the burgeoning tears.
The woman was smiling. Draco's hand reached for his wand, tucked into the thigh pocket of his cargo pants, but he stopped himself. They were among muggles, and he knew Harry would go spare if he hexed her.
"Her name was Lily."
Severus turned back to Chris and the whitelighter's eyes widened as he looked from Severus and Spike to Harry and back again, "The Boy Who Lived?"
Harry said nothing, so Severus went on. "Is that right? Happy endings for all? I suppose it does sound good when you think of it like that, and perhaps that is what will actually happen. But then again, maybe we will all die in pain and misery-" Harry flinched violently and Severus almost stopped, but he knew he had to eep going. What he had to say was important. "Will it matter then, when we come to the end of all things, whether you were with the one you love for a year, or a month, or an hour? When you are facing your death on the battlefield, will you value your moment with Draco less for being no more than moments?"
It was too lovely.
The blond just smiled and stood, holding his hand outstretched.
The one-eyed man had an implacable expression on his face, and Harry could tell he was used to lying, but he had to ask. "No, I heard you before. Dragon is a whitelighter. My whitelighter. Is he Draco Malfoy?"
Cold hands moved under his shoulders, easing him upright as a glass was placed in front of his lips. Usually anyone who had him in this position would want information more than they wanted his death, so Harry wasn't too concerned abut poison, but still he accepted the drink warily, sipping at what turned out to be tepid water with no hint of poison or potion.
"I'm not an actual white robes and wings angel. My kind are called 'white lighters.' Usually, after a lifetime of good behavior, or a particularly heroic death, we're called to protect future generations of witches and wizards. We don't get to pick, but apparently they thought I would be a good fit since you knew me."
Draco looked over, his neck twinging slightly at the motion, and saw his godfather, standing haloed in the weak light of the living room beyond.
He felt like he had always been screaming, that his entire existence took place in one moment of pain.
Chris nodded and turned down the music. The rest of the group, already winding down after the exciting day drifted into quiet conversation.
"That is why I brought them. Mr. Zabini is getting more irritable and frustrating every day. Once he found out I knew where Weasley is he demanded I bring these pictures."
"That's a yes," Severus said, and he kissed her again.
Briefly, Draco considering orbing out himself and leaving the baby behind to face his mother alone, but he knew he was supposed to be one of the good guys, and courage was part of the job.
On the other side was Ginny Weasley, who looked surprised when she saw Harry. After a second she shook herself out of it and turned to Severus. "We have some strange magical patterns coming towards the Great Hall. McGonagall thought you might know something about it, if it were a weapon or something."
Until now.
He paused for a moment, not sure what to say, before deciding to go for the truth. "Her name was Lily."
"No, My Lo- Lucius. It was your son, Draco."
Draco saw Paige walk into the room from the hall carrying two tote bags and a backpack and pulled away, wiping at his eyes and nose with the cuffs of his shirt.
Paige turned to Severus and saw him looking rather disgruntled. Spike and Severus didn't get along at the best of times, each thinking the other too serious and too frivolous, and the addition of a giggling Xander seemed unlikely to make things any better.
He was screaming.
"Okay. And let's say I believe you. Then what happens," the man asked, his smile gone.
With a blazing grin Harry proffered the pictures, wincing at a paper cut he received as Ron snatched them away. Hermione leaned in and cooed over the snapshots as Ron looked up at Harry with a puzzled expression.
Harry held up his hand, cutting her off sharply. "Draco and I will take care of that. I just need all of you to get me to Captain Snake Face." There were nods around the circle. "Neville, you take your team and reinforce the wards. Hermione, you start triggering the traps. The Death Eaters will have to get close to the castle and that puts them right in our path. Ginny, head up to the infirmary. I want to keep the casualties low on our side, but there are no guarantees. And set up a few warded rooms for Death Eater injured." The red headed girl opened her mouth to protest, but Harry shook his head. "I don't want to hear it. This ends tonight and there are going to be a lot of wounded on both sides. They deserve the chance to live until their trials." Ginny bit her lip, but nodded.
"Finnegan," Draco repeated questioningly.
The vampire gave her a disbelieving look, then snorted. "Sure it was. Every time a woman hits a man in his most precious area it's an accident."
Severus considered the idea, then nodded. "I am trusting you with this, Spike. If any harm comes to Harry—"
Draco noticed that one of the gauges had shifted when the Dark Lord focused his attention.
Spike grinned at Severus's description, but Xander broke out into high, piercing giggles.
Harry knew the back story for this role had been built up by Ron for weeks, and he'd taken the time to review it that morning. One drunken night Harry had unknowingly contributed some information to make it seem more realistic. The only surprise to Harry now was that he would be the one to deliver it instead of some nameless Order member. In that moment he hated his best friend.
He wanted to fall in love.
"Insolence."
"Bloody hell."
"Harry?"
"I know. That was Xander, my mate. He knows everything that goes on in the supernatural world here in California . Even more than the Charmed Ones do, they focus on San Francisco alone. He knows your Harry, and gave me his address. If that kid is the reason my nephew is hurting," Spike said, looking quickly at Chris who nodded in confirmation, "Then we need to find him fast."
Hermione was the first to laugh, but soon everyone was laughing, even Ron.
"Well, we are wizards. It must have been magic."
Severus sighed; another restless night hadn't left him in the brightest mood. "It's too soon for the baby to kick, so Madame Pomphrey is most likely correct. Considering the Weasley family, the child will most likely be born with a full head of red hair and an irritating personality." Snape smiled tightly, "However, considering the ties between the Prewitt family and the Malfoy's, and the fact that blond hair is recessive…"
Harry nodded and stepped towards the blond. Draco stiffened slightly and Harry felt a pang in his chest at the motion, wondering if the ex-Slytherin was afraid of him. "I'm not angry anymore. I mean, I think I should be, but you have responsibilities just as I do and you can't turn your back on them."
Draco only laughed and took his leave.
For the second time that night someone in Severus's quarters had their words cut off with a kiss, and just like his godson Severus wasn't fighting.
When finally the figure turned towards him with a small palace cat in its arms, Lucius' breath caught in his throat. It was Narcissa. It was…
She slapped Ron heartily on the back and he jumped. "Born? The baby's born? The baby is coming?"
One of the regulars, a beefy, Nordic looking blond, had brought in an unfamiliar woman and the two of them tucked away in a dark corner. Usually what happened in the dark corners of the strip club didn't bear investigation, but Harry felt obligated to take at least a cursory look.
When he left the club that night his head was spinning with the strange news. His manager was more than he appeared, and not only knew who Harry was, but why he was in Oxnard in the first place. Harry wasn't sure how to handle that, and he took a brief break on the walk back to the motel to have a cigarette in a small park and think.
"So…," Severus began, then trailed off as he had no way to continue.
"Don't be. I'm here now. I'm only mostly dead."
"What-," Hermione said, her mouth gaping open like a fish.
"I cannot believe you just did that."
"I'm half dead, and half alive, and that arrow was coated in a poison that would kill me and make you very sick. But I'm fine now. Very tired, but fine. I would like to get some sleep and we can talk about this tomorrow, yeah?"
"Hey, clear off you guys. Quit crowding tall, dark, and heterosexual."
The oldest nurse, one who had guided Narcissa into the world, came forth with a small bundle in her hands, and tears in her eyes.
"What are you?"
But he did anyway.
Piper looked towards the doorway and aid, "And I think it's just gotten a bit more complicated."
Harry felt like they were getting closer to Voldemort. Every time he fought he felt the evil bastard's presence, even though the red-eyed snake never reappeared on the field.
When he turned, Harry met the familiar amber gaze of the dancer he'd seen the previous night. With a disarming smile, the man walked forward, hand outstretched.
Paige began spending more time with Draco as the letters took a darker turn. Spike had gone back to Oxnard with Alex and everyone else was involved with their own lives, so the blond white lighter didn't really have anyone to talk to. Some nights Paige would sit up with him until the wee hours and talk. She learned a lot of things about Severus that she would have to tease her lover about the next time they saw each other.
Blaise moved forward, his hand outstretched, but Draco moved sharply away from it. He didn't want sympathy, didn't need it. He'd had three years to get used to his situation and now he could accept it. It was easy to accept things that were never going to change.
Harry was in shock. He still got up and went to work, per his new routine. He listened for information on the Dark Lord's movements in America. He took care of Ron as the red head was still milking his werewolf bite for all it was worth, though he had been healthy for days.
"I was talking to Shannon . She asked me if I wanted- and I told her…"
He kept his voice as low as he could as the bass thumped away in the night club, but he felt the tinge of hysteria was still noticeable.
He remembered crying. Crying harder than he had in a long time, maybe harder than he had in his entire life. And there was a warm hand on his back, rubbing in gentle circles as his breath shuddered in his chest.
She leaned he head towards her shoulder, thinking to wipe it off on her robe before it got into her eye, then stopped as Severus brushed his thumb across her skin, gathering the liquid and wiping it away. Heat blazed across her skin where Severus had touched, and she was sure she felt a blush rising.
"I was unaware there were any other branches in the Black or Malfoy family trees, much less one named 'Spike.'"
It was smaller than Draco had expected, somewhere around the size of a car engine, it looked like an engine as well, lots of wires and coils and shapes that Draco couldn't make any sense of.
Draco's words were cut off by a kiss, and when it looked like the two boys would be occupied for a while Severus stood, gesturing for Paige to stand as well. She had been sitting on the floor watching the drama the entire time, but a the two boys began to relax into each other she nodded and stood, following Severus into his bedroom.
When Severus looked at Draco, Harry followed his gaze. His view was partially blocked by a bookcase, but Harry didn't want to move further into the room and possibly gain the other's attention, so he only saw a sliver of the blond's profile, outlined by the orange light for the fire.
He found a day when all of the sisters would be out, taking Jamie, Blaise, and Ron on their first trip to a Muggle zoo, leaving Draco alone in the house as Chris was on another information gathering mission.
The door at the back of the club opened into a small storeroom that had been made up into a bedroom. Not quite the luxurious underground apartments Spike had described, but adequate in a pinch.
Blaise sighed. "Well, in all honesty, it was quite romantic. Harry was being tortured or something and you felt it through your connection to him. I always knew there was something there, but you were so deep in the closet you were pulling out Yule gifts. Seriously, Draco, imagine how much easier all of our lives would have been if you two had just shagged years ago."
He heard a broken gasp from the doorway and when he turned he sat Blaise leaning heavily against the wooden jamb, his hand pressed to his belly and a sad look on his face.
"Nope. Draco. My Draco, matter of fact. Left him outside, but he hasn't come back in yet."
Spike grinned at her, a flicker of shark sharp teeth showing through his human face, as he leaned back against the arm of the couch they were sitting on. "Well, pet, when a man and a woman, or a man and a man in a percentage of cases, or a woman and a woman for that matter, are in love, they…"
It wasn't the first time he had been hurt as a whitelighter and he knew it wouldn't be the last, but now he had someone who would miss him if he was killed in the line of duty.
When he looked at Harry he saw a playful glint in those green eyes. In that moment and for the first time in years Severus didn't feel a pang in his chest at the sight of the boy, and he was able to smile back.
Draco closed his eyes against the rain now, waiting for Harry's answer. Their romance had been a secret from the beginning. First to protect both of them from Voldemort and his Death Eaters who would take advantage of any vulnerabilities. Then, their love was too new to be exposed, finally it was just easier not to say anything. The two men lived separately, moved in different circles.
She was cut off by a loud cracking noise.
Paige was getting irritated, and fast. She loved her nephew, but if he didn't say something productive soon, she would get Piper to explode him.
He felt a brush of air as Draco rushed around the low table, and then the weight of an arm over his shoulders was almost enough to press the tears out of him. It had been a long time since he was held carefully, so long since he had allowed himself to collapse.
King Lucius and Queen Narcissa, the rulers of Slytherin, were in love, and the effects shown throughout their kingdom. The people were happy and safe with their compassionate leaders, and lived in peace.
For hours they danced until Draco heard a loud bell ring, a herald of the midnight shift change for the guards. In a few hours Draco would be called on to tend the fires in the castle.
Chris spoke up now, "Draco told me Harry used to be his charge and whitelighters never really end that relationship, we always keep our senses open for them. But for him to react that strongly…"
She gave him a strange look. "Which one do you think, Harry? Lucius is dead and no one's seen Narcissa for years. It was Draco."
Piper reversed course and pulled Blaise with her to the couch, pushing him behind the tall back. She held her hands ready and the air around them seemed to waver. Draco was still unconscious behind her on the couch itself, lying painfully still.
Opening his eyes he looked in the mirror again and took a shaky and relieved breath at the sight of his own pale skin, no blood stains in sight.
"Okay, let's go."
There was a tense moment when Draco was shot by a dark lighter on a routine mission. Chris was there to heal him, but the blond was very quiet after that, his usual sarcastic smile nowhere to be seen.
Ron nodded.
It wasn't the labor, or the childbirth, though that was painful, mostly due to his worry over Blaise and the baby. No, that would be an easy excuse, one he noticed Potter took at the first opportunity.
The next night found Severus Snape on his wingback chair in front of the fire. He spent eh entire day brewing blood replenishing potions and all he wanted was to escape into a book. Harry had left for California that morning and Severus didn't expect him to return for a day or two, so he was anticipating a peaceful and uninterrupted evening.
Draco sighed and collapsed on the couch, "Okay, I'm drunk.
Draco nodded and tried to ignore Blaise's insinuating smile.
There was a small cot against the back wall of the room, and there sat Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World, his body trembling with what Severus assumed was either the aftereffects of the
"Ah, my poor darling. You are not fortunate, are you?"
The headstone read, "Draco Lucius Malfoy- Beloved and unafraid."
"Hello godfather."
If you're reading this story and enjoying it please let me know. Feeling a bit rough right now
Spike smirked, "Yeah."
Blaise led Chris as he half-carried, half-dragged Draco over to another empty bed. The blond flailed weakly against the arms that settled him on top of the crisp sheets. "Let me go, go help Severus. I'm fine, dammit. Help him."
Then he got shot.
He was naked and trapped in a strange room with an American woman who looked like Lily.
Together the two of them moved Blaise to the couch, raising his legs up on the ottoman and pushing a pillow behid his lower back. Draco searched the brunet's face for further signs of discomfort and saw none.
Harry looked from it to his friends, expecting argument or help, and saw their expressions were blank of anything but determination.
She rolled her eyes gently and stood up from her seat on his bed, smoothing out the wrinkles in her skirt, "Yes, you died. But that's no cause to be rude."
That area was thickly covered with Death Eaters, and though these showed the effect of the weapon as well, they seemed to be withstanding the power drain. And though the blue glow had faded, Harry was not fool enough to believe that there were no other protections on the tent. With the ferocity of the battle behind him and the eerie silence of the tent before him Harry quickly ducked down into the brush to plan his assault on the seemingly flimsy stronghold.
Draco was alive, Draco was okay, and Draco was in contact.
Neither boy noticed the man appear out of a cloud of black with a cross bow.
Smiling weakly, she said, "You are not alone. You will never be alone. I want you to marry again," she ignored his denials, "I want you to find someone you can love just like me. I want you to be happy with our child."
"You love him, don't you?"
Paige nodded.
Paige smiled, and she could almost feel her eyes glinting, "I know vampires pretty well. After all, I used to be one."
Paige knew the culprit, her youngest oldest nephew was a notorious food thief, once orbing away an entire cake while his mother was frosting it.
Laughing, Draco pulled away, "I give, I give, Severus. I know I'm dead, but I still need to breathe."
Draco froze. This was the problem. He was already dead. He would never be able to grow old and die with Harry, he would stay as he was forever or until some darklighter or demon got a lucky hit in, then he would die, but not before, not as he would have in the normal measure of a life.
Outside he found Chris and Paige in the living room, standing over a map. Paige had a pendulum in her hand and it was weaving a slow circle over the parchment.
Paige uncurled from the floor and rushed over to her fallen sister, walking carefully over the chunks of steaming demon on the floor.
They left the door open in case the little family needed anything and returned to the living room. Severus was gone, and Paige was tempted to go find him and try to discover the source of the sorrow in his eyes when he saw the baby, but then she heard Phoebe grunt in disgust and turned to see what was bothering her sister.
Harry knew his manager, Alex, wasn't dancing that night, he had to do the books and told everyone before they opened that he would be in his office all night and not to disturb him. Yet the blond person had gotten in and was still in there.
Harry suddenly felt very uncomfortable about his crush on the Slytherin blond. There were more than just a few years between fifteen and eighteen.
Draco saw the woman grin. "That's up to you, sweet heart," she said, pinching Harry's behind as she left the small room.
Rubbing a hand over his tired, burning eyes, Draco waited for the speech, the one he was so familiar with that started at 'I'm disappointed in you' and usually ended with a hard clout across the face. It was what he was used to, after all.
Finally Paige took a seat on the couch near Draco's feet, sighing deeply.
Draco rose stiffly from the low wooden chair and stretched. Rubbing at red-stained eyes he walked past Paige, nudging her shoulder gently as he passed. It wasn't the most enthusiastic expression of gratitude she'd ever seen, but the kid was exhausted. Hopefully Piper could waylay him in the kitchen and force him to eat something before he went from his current translucence to complete invisibility.
When finally the song drew to a close Draco was the first and loudest to call for more, his hands sore from clapping.
Blaise snorted. "Fine, make fun of me. I'm in pain and you're going to laugh." His voice was rough and Paige bit her tongue as his brown eyes grew teary. "Never mind that I'm in labor. Never mind that I'm not even eighteen. Never mind that I'm all alon—" He cut himself off with a fierce sob and before she knew it Paige had her arms wrapped around his swollen and trembling form and she was muttering comforting words under her breath.
Turning away from the wall, Draco slid to the floor, rubbing his eyes, "Do I look alright, Potter?"
Draco pulled free of Harry's arms, clawing tight hands from his stomach. Adjusting his sodden robes around himself, he said, "I can weather this storm Harry. I can make it through anything."
"Was completed and sent off to the team. We cut it a little close, but it was still safely inside the window. I haven't heard anything, so he must be fine."
Chris hurried over to the injured Harry and Severus cast several shielding charms before looking further into the cave. There were three men fighting Spike. The vampire dodged gracefully, using their own strength against them often putting the men into each other's paths for hexes and physical blows. The vampire was at a disadvantage fighting humans, but Severus wouldn't know it to look at him, dancing around the bruised and lumbering forms of the Dark wizards with a grin on his face.
Unfortunately it seemed like it was, as she ran out of shampoo, then hot water, leaving herself halfway through her shower with a head full of liquid bodywash when the cold water came blasting out. Her favorite jeans were too tight, but not sexy tight, just uncomfortable. And her favorite 'fat day' jeans were still carrying a strange green stain from their last demon hunt.
"He was brewing a potion and it exploded at him. Some of it burned through his clothes and he inhaled some smoke. Draco tried to heal him, but he doesn't have the strength. Severus is out of immediate danger, but the chemicals are still working and if we're going to save his life, we need potions and we need them now."
Using Harry's actions as an example she took a deep breath and went looking for Severus.
"Not very good. But that isn't a surprise."
"I didn't know you were coming, but I recognized you as soon as I saw you and so could some of my customers if I hadn't had a friend of mine cast a glamour over you."
"Not physical closeness."
"Come on. You don't want to get sick."
"He doesn't want me, Severus. He said so."
It had been six months since Draco disappeared. Harry and his team had been gone for four of those and no one knew when they'd be back, if they'd be back. Though Snape received semi-regular owls saying the children were alright.
Harry looked at Ron, but the red head just snorted. "Might as well make him turn the spits. A bit of ash and coal dust won't mar his looks."
Draco bit his tongue, knowing sharp words would not help him here, and shook his head.
Draco started sobbing and Harry wanted to rush forward, but he had to be sure it was true before he gave in and chanced his heart again, but as Draco' sobs grew harsher he began to mutter 'I'm sorry's' with every spare breath and Harry had to do it. He threw off the Invisibility Cloak and stepped forward into the firelight.
Harry's flush grew darker and Severus allowed himself one second precisely of smugness before returning to a more appropriate demeanor.
"Why, Potter, are you scared? It's muggle liquor, not acid. I'll be fine."
As he finished the potion and cleaned his hands Severus took the tiem to stody Harry.
They kept a matched pair of magic mirrors for emergency use, and though this wasn't exactly an emergency, Harry knew he had to find out what happened.
"Enough of this foolishness," one of the Elders said, the one that Shannon had pushed back. "If he will not leave his charge behind then they can come together." The Elders' eyes were hard. "The boy will be joining us soon enough anyway."
Not one to give up in the face of childish behavior, Paige stuck her tongue out at them and was rewarded by a small smile from Severus who, it appeared, had been paying better attention than he wanted it to seem.
It wasn't that bad a gig, though, so Paige couldn't complain. The best seat in the house reserved for her and all the soda and non-alcoholic lager she could drink for free. All she had to do was watch out for the weird. Granted, this was San Francisco, so there was a lot of weird going around, but as long as Paige could tell the difference between a demon and a drag queen, she would be alright.
Trying not too see anything she might have nightmares about later, she looked only at the dark-eyed man and said, "Is there anything I can do here?"
"You loved her," Paige asked softly.
After a few more seconds Hermione pushed away, her eyes now clear. "I suppose I understand. This has been a very stressful time. But we put these procedures in place for a reason, Harry. I mean, what if it had been Neville, or Ron, or me. Wouldn't you want to know where we were?"
Once Draco was healed Severs stood, taking Paige's hand to help her to her feet. Draco stood as well and Severus gestured for the two of them to follow him.
Hogwarts had become headquarters for the war after the attack that destroyed Grimmaud Place. The loss of Sirius' legacy had hurt, but Harry didn't miss the man's mother a bit. During the months of fighting, Harry had spent many evenings in Snape's rooms. It was the most peaceful place he could find in a castle packed too tight with students and their families and every hallway flooded with the stench of fear.
The joke was weak, but Harry couldn't restrain a snort. The introduction of Muggle things like films to the two Slytherins had obviously taken.
"Nope. Draco. My Draco, matter of fact. Left him outside, but he hasn't come back in yet."
Taking a moment to catch up with his own thoughts, Harry saw that most of the uninjured survivors were working to free anyone trapped under the rubble while dodging more of the falling stones. He wondered how many of his friends might be in there, hurt or dying, but he had to fight. If he didn't confront Voldemort now, they might as well leave the fallen to die, it would be the same fate in the end.
"Very nice, Harry."
"Tell us."
The assumption was proven when she spoke.
"You knew Wyatt was down here and you didn't say anything! How long was Wyatt down here? Where's Spike? I knew it was a bad idea to let a vampire in this house. Ever since you two got here things are falling apart. Honestly, you're useless. What did we do to deserve this? Chris was bad enough, but-"
"Severus, what are you doing?"
Harry slowly moved his hand up to rub his face. Returning it to the ground at his side he sighed and looked up at Voldemort. "Say it, don't spray it, Tom."
, red thing.
His chest heavy Draco went about making the soup and before it was taken out of the kitchen, he set his mother's silver ring in the bottom of the bowl.
Paige kept her hand on his back, not rubbing anymore, but just providing a steady warm pressure and when it looked like he was under control again, she said, "It's been a while, huh?"
Sitting on one of the brightly varnished desks was Draco's assigned elder, a red headed woman named Shannon , and in a chair nearby was an unfamiliar blond man with an air of weariness and sorrow around him that drew Draco's attention.
"Well, what about a lip piercing," Harry asked, turning his focus to the large binder on the counter.
"Paige? We're here, you can let go."
With another dark giggle, he said, "That's a pretty big 'maybe' though."
Severus held his breath as he watched Spike shift into what the vampire called his 'game face' and move closer to the brunette's neck.
"I'm sorry?"
The bottle was small and dark, and from a distance all Harry and Draco could smell was the mild woody aroma. Harry conjured a small glass, and Draco laughed and changed it to a brandy snifter the size of a punch bowl to Harry's eyes.
"I'm glad you kept the piercing."
After long moments in which the boy relaxed enough to return his father's embrace, Lucius regained himself. He felt alive for the first time in sixteen years.
The last few drops trickled slowly down the side of the glass and Draco threw it down, gasping.
"Okay, that night Harry went off with Paige to get he champagne to toast you and Jamie. When he came back he half-dragged me into the garden, said he had something to tell me. We got out there and he didn't say anything. I got sick of waiting so I was on the verge of walking back inside when he grabbed my shirt, pulled me to him… and kissed me."
"I'm fine, Hermione, just trying to remember something."
Draco heard Severus walk away and tucked himself further into the corner. When the black-clad man had passed, he made his way into a secret passage that would bring him back to his quarters.
But just as easily as the intensity rose, it fell again, though the spark in Harry's eye didn't die. The boy stood up from the bed and walked towards the bathroom attached to the infirmary. Over his shoulder he said. "Very well, Professor. I am done 'pouting' as you say. We are at was and I am a fighter, a weapon, am I not? So we go to war."
Even as Draco registered what he was seeing, that he was caught, he saw Harry jump from his knees and lunge at Voldemort, knocking him to the ground. As soon as he was down, Harry turned to the Death Eater.
Ron stared from Harry to Draco, and back again, and then again a few more times until he felt dizzy and had to sit down.
"Those are really for girls," the clerk said to Draco, pointedly.
But duty called.
"No Draco," the girl said, tension thrumming the thin thread of patience in her voice, "You are gay. And moreover you are gay for Potter."
"I may have chased him off," Piper clarified.
"Well, you see…"
As long as he kept his breaths short and shallow he could withstand the pain so he conjured some fabric to wrap around his torso. It wasn't as tight as it should have been but he couldn't tighten it any more on his own so it would have to suffice.
Shaken, Harry asked, "What?"
Draco stomped out of the room, the door swinging fiercely behind him.
Paige was standing next to the bed where a half-dressed Severus Snape lay.
The door swung open, pushing Chris even further into the corner as a sweaty brunette barely wearing leather pants walked in, pressing a towel to his face.
From regular cleaning duties, washing dishes and mopping floors, Harry had moved on to bussing the small tables that covered most of the floor. He was making a pretty penny in tips, and getting some information as well.
"Maybe that would be for the best," Draco muttered, then felt a hard grip of fingers on his chin. His face was forcibly dragged until he was looking directly at his godfather, completely unable to turn away.
"I was upse—"
"I'm afraid that was me," Paige said from the doorway before walking into the room.
Especially tonight.
"Okay, have you ever heard of the Charmed Ones…."
Voldemort took the opportunity to signal his Death Eaters, and with a series of cracks like popcorn popping, the field was cleared of the masked fighters, at least those healthy enough to flee, leaving only Order members and fallen bodies behind.
Severus woke hours later, in his favorite chair, the fire rustling merrily in the grate.
The man smiled, but there was something sharp to the grin now as he moved forward as well, his hand outstretched. As Paige took it he said, "I'm afraid Spike does tend to get a little possessive. He probably thought if we met you might carry me away."
Severus wrinkled his nose and waited for Chris to join them, which the young whitelighter did, an awkward smile on his face and a long tear in his shirt.
"What was that," a deceptively calm voice asked.
He knelt down, "Draco? Draco, love? Wake up. Wake up."
"Severus brought them."
Chris grinned sheepishly and took his arm away from Draco, much to Harry's relief, before following the woman to the refrigerator. "Aw, mom. I was just having some fun."
I'm back," Phoebe sang as she reentered the living room, her arms piled high with towels and blankets.
Hermione had the nerve to glare at him before grabbing his hand and half-leading him, half-dragging him out of his quarters.
Eventually Draco gathered himself together and waved off his concerned attacker. He took a deep breath. "Shag? Me and Potter? Really?"
"All right, enough of that everybody. Let's quiet down before we bust through the wards and wake up the little mother," Phoebe shouted.
"Shit," Paige said, "That was Harry."
Spike grinned, "Well, we could take him back to my place—"
"You've grown tall, Draco. Soon enough we will be eye to eye."
Suddenly the dogs were upon him, their gnashing teeth caught in the hem of his cloak and bringing him to the ground where he landed in a puddle of thick mud. He couldn't run without leaving his cloak behind and it was the only disguise he had, so Draco stayed still. Hoping the men and their dogs would leave him be once they discovered he was not what they thought.
Hearing Draco, Harry gave up his pretence and threw the heavy blanket off. Hopping off of the cot, he walked over to the Slytherin's bed. The boy's tired voice had prepared him for Draco looking exhausted, but this was worse than he had expected. The Slytherin looked, he looked…
"You're gay."
Piper swallowed her complaint and stared into her juice as Paige set the can of soda on the counter and turned back to the fridge to find something breakfast-food-shaped.
"You're beautiful when you're angry."
The light bounced off of pale blond hair and Snape was reminded of Lucius, fallen asleep mid-study when they were in school together, but Lucius was dead.
He arrived back at the Manor, slime free, to see Spike and Paige sharing the newspaper in the living room, wearing identical smiles.
Severus moved into the hallway, slowly leaning against the wall and settling on the floor next to Draco. It was the first time Draco had even seen the man do something so undignified, but he couldn't find it in him to say anything, instead just basking in the warmth coming from the dark form.
Quickly, the red-headed woman rushed over to the boy, guiding him to the edge of the bed to sit and pushing his head down between his knees.
a voice in Harry's head repeated, he was different, quieter. He didn't pick as many fights, or throw as many insults. He just stood and watched while his cronies did the dirty work for him.
"Sorry about that. I didn't- I wasn't really expecting it, you know?"
Harry shifted again and Draco turned his attention back to him. Slowly the other boy's eyes focused and Draco smiled at the sight of the familiar green. "You're going to be okay, Potter. You hear me?"
Harry nodded. "Apparently it will allow Tom, old Moldy Voldie himself, to drain the power of his Death Eaters and use it o kill me and everyone I care about." Harry's gaze fell to Severus's arm and Severus gripped his Dark Mark reflexively. "It looks like he has you either way, Snape."
As Draco stood he swayed his head swimming with pain and nausea from his injuries and reaction from the energy healing took out of him. He saw Harry signal to one of the other students who came over and brought the injured boy out of the hall, before moving to support Draco.
Harry turned away. "It isn't the same. There's this prophesy-"
Snape moved as if to say something, his mouth hanging open, but Draco gently pressed on his jaw, closing it and cutting the man off.
Draco pushed Harry off of him, then pulled him up until the boy was cradled in his arms. Carefully, struggling with the weight, Draco got to his knees, and then to his feet. The Dark Lord and the Death Eater that had been with him were nowhere in sight so he pushed past the soft white feathers and made his way to the opening of the tent.
Paige laughed and got up. "Sure, Spike."
He was woken hours later by a roaring voice. Peering out of the pump house he saw Hagrid calling for his stable boys, most of whom appeared to have over indulged the night before in honor of the prince. Draco stepped towards the door, reaching for the latch before he gasped. His hand was still pale. Looking down he saw he was still clad in the shining suit, his hair unbound and his skin bare to the world. He had fallen asleep without changing, and any moment someone would come searching for him.
"No," Paige said. "You don't have to do anything. Prophecies aren't like a To Do list. They're your fate and they will happen whether you try to accomplish them or not. In the meanwhile you're tearing yourself apart with worry."
The other woman, who had been observing Draco in silence the whole time, finally spoke.
"He said. I don't know who he was talking to, but he said he didn't want to have a lifetime with me." Harry turned to Severus and the older man but back a gasp at the pain in his eyes. "Why would he say that? I don't have much of a lifetime left, do I? Only a few more weeks, so he wouldn't have to stay with me forever. Am I not worth a few weeks, Severus?" Harry's voice was soft and trembling. He sounded like a confused child and once again Severus found himself gathering the boy in his arms without really thinking about it.
The Slytherin had managed to get his pants open, and Harry fumbled for the other boy's cock as he tried to open his shirt one-handed.
The vampire quirked an eyebrow at Severus saying, "You're too demanding, love."
His hands finally clear of potions residue, Severus made his way to the fire, taking a seat in his own wingback chair and absently enjoying the heat that seeped into his bones. He closed his eyes for a moment to absorb the silence and warmth before opening them again to focus on Harry.
Draco shook his head. "No, I'm not leaving him. I let him go once, I can't do it again."
"Anyway," he went on, "We got here, and the sisters helped patch you up."
The air seemed to grow thicker as they approached the Great Hall. It felt like something was coming. There were only a few people around at this late hour, food was available twenty-four hours a day now, as no one could predict when the shifts of guards, soldiers, or medical staff would be able to eat. The House Elves had never been happier.
Now if he could only get up and find the damn weapon…
Pushing the door open wider, but still staying behind it, Severus said, "Still engaging in dramatics, Mr. Potter? I thought we had outgrown this sort of behavior."
The woman was tall and broad, more muscle than fat, with flaming red hair, and clearly on the darker side of fifty. Paige blushed at her assumption that something illicit was going on, and when Draco met her eyes, she smiled awkwardly and held out the knapsack.
Paige took in his expression and his rigid posture, and the fact that his hands were fisted at his sides, knuckles white as bone.
"She has passed, but she died well. She told the king nothing, saying only that she loved you and your mother and wished for you to be happy."
Voldemort's voice as a cold hiss and Draco felt a shiver run down his back before he could help it. The Dark Lord giggled and Draco shuddered at the mad sound but he kept his focus on the tent wall. The hole was growing larger, but slowly, it would take time to cut through. Draco could sense that Harry was nearby, maybe even in the tent itself and Draco could only hope that the other man kept Voldemort distracted long enough for him to get in there.
This time the third woman, a brunette with short hair, was the one to speak. "I'm Phoebe, that is my sister Piper, and my other sister, Paige." She said, pointing to first brunette and the red head in turn.
"Speak for yourself, mate. I have a fiancé and a baby, myself."
Draco made another inelegant snort, "Muggle alcohol. You might as well drink water."
Draco felt heat rise in his cheeks and then winced as he saw an understanding light in Blaise's eyes.
His words were short, and the tone harsher than even he expected. As he saw Blaise's deep brown eyes glaze over with tears, Draco grit his teeth. He couldn't take it back, couldn't apologize, and wasn't sure what he would be apologizing for even if he tried.
"Look, this chatter is all well and good, but Nephew is not at his best—." Spike was cut off as Draco shifted on the floor and whispered something unintelligible.
(See the end of the chapter for
Remembering his childhood at the Dursleys, Harry nodded with full confidence.
Draco heard Voldemort shouting something behind him, but he couldn't turn, he had to try and figure out the machine. If they just destroyed it, even imagining that such a thing was possible, it would be the death of all of the wizards it was drawing power from, pulling them into the darkness with it. But how to turn it off?
The explanation took an hour and a half, frequently interrupted by the fascinated Blaise. Paige knew where Blaise, Severus, and Draco were from, but Phoebe and Piper didn't, so she couched the story in terms her sisters would understand without giving away too much of the British Wizarding World.
Harry shook off the riddle of who this ' Shannon ' person was and focused on the question. He would hear it now, hear Draco admit that he never wanted Harry, never loved him.
"We need somewhere to lay up?"
"Shhh, love, shh. We can find a way. You love him and love is all that we are. We can find a way."
He looked up at her, pressing his fingers to his cheek as she blushed and closed the album, handing it back. "You are lucky we didn't go to school together, I would have tackled you."
When Paige opened her eyes again, she thought she had somehow traveled backwards in time. Stone walls surrounded her, and a nurse in a long dress bustled around a bed holding a black-haired man in a long robe, lying face down.
He had pushed his sleeves up when he was helping Blaise, but now he pulled them back down to cover the stark black tattoo.
Ron smiled tightly, "Blaise won't be doing that sort of thing anymore."
The man stalked forward, stopping just inches from the end of the wand, a bright amber light dancing in his eye.
His duties were simple. He roamed the night, stoking the fires in the kitchens and the halls, then he was free. Later on in the day he would have to turn the great spits of the kitchen for hours, then he would be released to start fires in the residential chambers while everyone was at dinner. The kitchen staff ignored him, not with cruelty, but he was isolated all the same. The only person that truly acknowledged his presence was the prince, but Draco saw him only rarely. In the long quiet hours when he wasn't sleeping and had no duties Draco would read one of the thousands of books to be found in the libraries or sit in the corner of the kitchen and listen to the workers gossip. It was nice, comfortable in a way, and worlds away from his youth as a prince in his own right.
"Draco, why don't you go get some rest, I can sit with him for a while."
"I am," Draco said, and then paled. "I am? Am I… Am I un-dead? I'm not a vampire, am I? I don't care much for the sight—the sight of blood." His calm words were belied by his color, turning from chalk white to a dusty green.
King Lucius called for the finest doctors in the kingdom and beyond, but they, in fear for their lives, refused to tell him his wife's true condition. As the kind and gentle Queen grew weaker, the King became angrier and angrier. Finally, he gathered the doctors together and demanded the truth from them. They all stood silent, but for one. The oldest and most venerable doctor had traveled from the neighboring Kingdom of Gryffindor at the King's request and he was a brave man. Stepping forward, Dumbledore finally spoke true words to the king. "You wife is dying. The child is taking her strength. There is nothing we can do." After a moment of silence, King Lucius howled his grief and rage. He had wished for a child, but not at this cost. Never at this cost.
The words fell into the otherwise silent room like bombs and all three young people turned to the door where…
"Letter from Hermione to Blaise, letter from Hermione to Ron, letter from Severus to Blaise, letter from Severus to Paige, package from Severus to me…"
"Yeah. One of our sources passed on the information. I only found out this morning." As he spoke Harry felt the exhaustion of the day weigh down on his shoulders all at once. But he took a deep breath and shook it off.
As he walked away Paige turned to Spike. "Now why did I have to do that?"
It was raining lightly outside, and the cool mist felt good against his over-heated skin. He wanted to blame the abundance of candles inside, but maybe it was the weight of the stares he'd been under. Though he was a light warrior, he was still Dark-born and a blood traitor.
"My boyfriend," Harry swallowed hard, for effect and because he felt he had a huge lump of something he didn't want to acknowledge stuck in his throat.
Pulling away from the prince, Draco said, "I'm sorry, I must go."
Ron had taken his role as father, impending husband and provider to extremes, forbidding Blaise from leaving his bed for a week after the baby was born and assigning a rota of the other inhabitants of the house to take turns sitting with the cranky brunet.
The other men nodded, and Severus set his wand to detect magical signatures before taking down the shield and exiting the alley. Chris and Spike followed behind.
Letters still arrived from California. Severus didn't know what Harry did with his, but every letter Severus received from Paige and Draco asked what had happened. That stumped Severus because if Draco didn't know what set Harry off, how were they to resolve it?
Blaise had asked this question twice every day since he found out he was pregnant, so that had been approximately 64 times.
The next morning came bright and sunny. Paige had tossed restlessly all night long, dreaming about war and green lights and a blond boy who was crying like his heart was broken. It was very disturbing and she hoped it wasn't an omen of a bad day to come.
"Okay then, you have a point. So why don't we go find Mr. Clean."
The young white lighter on the couch whined softly as Piper brushed his hair off of his face. A thin trickle of blood trailed down from his mouth, and Piper dabbed at it with a tissue.
Turning to the Spike, she said, "I felt a call, but it wasn't that loud. Normally whitelighters hear an alarm when their charges are in danger, but," she continued, looking at Piper, "we're all fine."
"Spike?"
"Young," Draco supplied, smirking gently. "Were I to look as old as I am, I would be an eighteen year old man, and still appear too young for my responsibilities. Were I to look as old as I feel… Well, you would probably see a grey-bearded old man before you, and you might say I'm too old for the work I'm doing."
Calmly, he asked, "Who are you and where am I?"
"I am a king, Snape. I may do what I wish."
First Draco requested a robe made form the skin of the fiercest bear in the country. It took months for a team of hunters to find the most vicious bear, and another week to trap and kill it before the skin could be removed and cured. But they succeeded and the robe was presented to the prince nine months before his birthday.
The soft sound of someone clearing their throat broke the moment, and Draco pulled away, head spinning.
"Nobody good," the blond said sulkily, waving the sandwich away.
"I'm right here, mate."
Biting back a sob Lucius rushed forward and wrapped his arms around the boy, ignoring his shocked stiffness, and weeping into his neck where silvery-blond hair brushed against his cheeks.
Severus nodded and Harry sighed.
Draco sat up, leaning against the wall. "What am I doing here? Where's Harry?"
After a month, they had learned that Voldemort had used some of his European recruits to spread his message in America where it was taking a strong hold.
If pushed, Severus could hazard a guess, and knowing what he knew of the Golden Trio and their usual process of 'conflict resolution' he might be right. But it was in everyone's best interest if the exact location remained a mystery, so Severus didn't try.
Harry felt his manager's heavy stare on him and finally realized why he seemed so familiar.
One of the men got around the vampire and had his wand up. Severus threw a slashing curse at the man, forcing him to drop his wand. Spike gave Severus a nod before turning back to the fight.
"I don't work for any of the bigwigs on the Light side, but I hear things even in my sordid little corner of the world. Still, nothing is better than first hand knowledge and I'd like you to tell me why you're here."
"It's that bad?"
Remembering the look on Draco's face when he came out of Harry's room, and the long nightmarish nights full of Lily's eyes welling with recriminations, Severus said, "I'm not too sure that's true. Regardless, you cannot act out in temper like this. There is a war on and you will need a clear head to fight."
Releasing her hand, he struggled upright. There was no specific pain, just a consistent and unpleasantly familiar ache. The last thing he remembered was being back at Hogwarts in his laboratory on the verge of explosion.
Ron turned to Draco, "I'll take care of them for now, Chris wanted you in the living room."
The voice was soft and low, and it almost sounded like Narcissa. Lucius moved closer. The figure was still half-hidden in the shadows, but the form, slim and tall, was much like Narcissa's and they way it moved taunted him with memory.
Lucius' hand tightened on Draco's jaw and the boy bit back a cry at the pain. "Your best interests are in my hands, my son. This man is nothing to you, nothing more than a servant. You are mine."
Hermione said nothing, only pointed to the door.
The man grimaced before moving towards Draco and taking the boy into a fierce embrace, equally returned. Then he let go and motioned towards the table.
The first few days after Severus left were busy and Paige didn't have much time to think about their relationship. Blaise and Ron were learning how to be parents, and Leo had shown up for about two days, leaving Piper in 'a delicate condition' that the oldest Charmed One was alternately cursing and blessing her otherwise absent husband for.
"Fuck you, Potter."
Keeping his voice low, Draco said, "What's happening?"
"Harry, come quick. Ron is hurt!"
Now, Harry swallowed hard and closed his eyes, trying to ignore the way Ron's hand tightened on his every time Blaise swore.
Neville was fine. Scratched and bruised by the flying debris but otherwise healthy. Ginny was dazed. A chunk of rock had hit her in the head, leaving a long streak of blood mixed in with her red hair. Harry flagged down one of the other uninjured soldiers and handed her off to be brought to the infirmary.
Chris nodded, "But I have to keep an eye on him so we need privacy."
The boy had changed. The Harry severus saw last in California , turning green over Blaise, then laughing in Draco's arms, was a different boy than the one that sat before him now, buried deep in the thick cushions of the couch, pale and thoughtful. If the weeks since their return had been hard on Severus, it was nothing compared to how bad they were for Harry.
In his absence he forgot how bad the war was, the attacks against Death Eaters and by Death Eaters were getting worse. The British population was depleted on both sides of the battle with innocent bystanders getting the worst of it. Hogwarts still stood and even more people were crammed into the castle for sanctuary. As soon as they arrived Severus had been rushed off to his labs and Harry had since only seen him in passing.
When Draco pulled away, Harry saw laughter in his pink-rimmed eyes.
Paige half-heard, half-felt Draco snort and when he looked up again he was smiling a watery smile.
Piper walked into the kitchen, saying something about 'getting his strength back,' and Phoebe led the mini parade to Blaise's bedroom.
Ron looked at him oddly, "Don't you mean 'Malfoy,' Harry?"
Severus tipped his glass to Paige, then took a sip of the sparkling liquor.
The night Harry made his first kill Snape thought the boy was broken, thought something ineffable had been killed.
Still, he wasn't that good.
Harry was cut off by a short, hard kiss, one more bracing than arousing, but it did the trick, snapping him out of the spiral of anger and confusion and sorrow and desperation.
Severus managed to reach them in time to hear Harry say, "I never wanted a lifetime with you either, you nasty little bastard," and watch him punch Draco in the face.
Paige saw the brunette, Blaise, standing in the corner of the room, watching events unfold, "You know what happened, you said it was your fault. What was it?"
"Drake, let go. I have to help."
Harry growled and lunged at the man. His hands were empty, his wand having been taken at some point, but he didn't care. He wanted Voldemort dead.
Draco gave him a watery smile, before clambering onto the bed to lie next to his godfather, resting his head on the other man's chest. It had been a very long time since Severus shared a bed with anyone, but he thought in this case he could make an exception.
"So I'm to be your secret?" Draco kept his voice as steady as he could, but the rain had soaked his robes and the cold was reaching in.
He saw Paige and Severus look up at him, surprise in their eyes.
After a few hours, the boy remembered an appointment with Pomphrey, so Snape could finally sigh in relief and make his way to his quarters.
Harry guided them over the debris covered floor to the large pile and helped him sit. As Draco allowed himself to rest reaction from all of the healing washed over him and he began to tremble. Harry looked up at him, concern in his green eyes as he began to run his hands over Draco's body.
Two bags on her shoulder and now one in her hands, Paige walked into the living room to see what bothered Harry so much and found Draco standing in the arms of a strange woman.
Harry shook his head gently, moaning as even that soft motion set of fresh fireworks behind his eyes.
Paige cut off Draco's babbling with a sharp look. The blond was still half-dazed and complied easily. When Paige turned to Severus to quiet him as well she saw that he had fallen asleep, mouth open, and deep breaths whistling quietly through his nose.
Draco mumbled to himself, then twisted the knob under the gauge that had changed, turning it to one side and then to the next, only slightly, and watching the level change.
Ron nodded, a crooked smile on his face as he said, "Yeah, mate. James Narcissus, if you two don't mind."
Following the pregnant boy down the stairs, her heart half in her throat, Paige listened for sounds of a fight or threats and heard nothing.
Dark curls surrounded the tan skin, framing an average face highlighted by a black satin eye patch covered in dark blue sequins. The remaining eye shined an unpleasantly familiar shade of amber. The man, whatever else he was, was a werewolf.
Piper gave him a look that could cut glass, "If he had would I be so upset?'
Harry smiled, but Severus noticed that it didn't quite reach his eyes. The two men sat in silence for long moments.
And it was true, he did. Draco and Harry had been bound together for years before Harry had become his 'assignment.' And over those years Severus had watched their relationship turn from vicious rivals, to friends, to the tentative glances and 'accidental' touches that had started a few months before Draco revealed what he was and left.
Draco paused for breath, but Severus stayed silent.
Draco cut him off. "No! No, it's something-stabbing-" He couldn't say it. Chris was hurt, more than hurt, the emptiness Draco felt in his heart meant that his charge was dead. Harry and Chris had been injured before and Draco felt the ghost of their pain every time, letting him know when he need to heal them, but this was different. He felt Harry lifting his shirt.
Snape had made sure of it himself.
Draco hissed as Harry wrapped an arm around his waist. His ribs were protesting fiercely. But even through the pain of his broken ribs Draco relished the warmth of Harry's arm around his waist and he indulged himself by leaning a little heavier on the green-eyed man as they walked towards a pile of rubble in the corner.
Severus nodded, shifting as Paige took the album into her lap and traced the picture with her fingers.
Harry had to disagree, as at the moment, Hermione looked stranger; confusion never looked right on her face.
Severus looked at Paige.
The man turned. In the flickering glow of the fire Harry saw lines and shadows he had never noticed before. Snape was old, he realized. The man had been fighting in this war since he was younger than Harry was now, and the battle went on.
"Are you all right, Harry?"
It was awkward, and messy, and the overhanging flavor of Firewhiskey ran through both of their mouths, but practice would eventually make perfect. Draco pulled back slowly with his eyes closed.
Eventually the false acceptance gave way to fear and Draco confessed to Paige that he thought Harry might be injured or dead. The blond said he hadn't felt anything from his boyfriend, but the distance of an ocean is far for even a whitelighter bond. Once Paige confirmed through a letter to Severus that Harry was alive and well, Draco's relief was short lived because it meant that while Harry could talk to him, he wouldn't.
Her sister giggled again, then winced and rubbed lightly at the back of her head. "It's not a concussion, but it isn't much fun either."
Then they went to war.
Confused and disappointed the crowd cleared away.
Draco pulled his face away from the king's grasping hand and nodded. "Yes, My Lord. But he has cared for me since I was a child. I would not see him die…" He had an idea and though it would break his heart the pain would be less than the loss of his only true family. Draco lowered his face and peered up at the king through his long pale lashes, "I would not see him die when I am supposed to be joyful, My Lord. It would put a pall on our wedding."
"Do you have to call me that? We've discussed this," Spike said, turning to face the man and Paige got a clearer look at him, tall and dark haired and tan. He had a green velvet eye patch on, half covered in tousled curls. From the way they interacted, and the fact that Spike called him 'Xan' with a very familiar tone of exasperation, she knew who he was instantly.
"Will you dance with me, Harry?"
Draco didn't feel well. He let himself fall against the wall, leaning heavily on the wallpapered surface the way the proper Malfoy heir he'd been raised to be never would have dared.
She winked at Draco, dropping he eyes to where Harry's hands were clasped against the Slytherin's stomach. "That is a very sexy piercing. Or at least, I haven't gotten too many complaints." She grinned and Draco saw a flash of metal behind her teeth.
She felt the heat of a blush in her cheeks and turned away from Severus to look at Spike who was grinning widely.
Paige could feel Severus moving beside her, but she reached Draco first. She tilted his face up and healed the cut quickly, then pressed a soft kiss against his cheek. Moving his face again, she met his eyes and gasped.
Though the vampire complained, Draco knew he savored the thoughtless affection almost more than Draco did himself.
Backing away until she collapsed into a kitchen chair, Piper sighed, "Draco left."
Draco led the men, Ron and Harry, to his cave where he gathered up the satchel containing his belongings, the few trinkets of his mothers and the three beautiful suits his father had made. Ron made as if to look in the bag, but when Draco snarled at him Harry laughed and waved the red head away.
Harry's morbid turn of thought was interrupted by a muted jingling and the appearance of white sparkles in the middle of the room that turned into Draco Malfoy. Harry badly wanted to make a Star Trek joke, but neither Slytherin was the best audience for that sort of thing, so he settled for wondering how the boy had gotten in, as apparition was blocked inside the castle, and Snape's quarters heavily warded besides.
"You cut him, Harry. Paige healed it but you could have hurt him quite seriously with your tantrum."
Draco pulled her hand away. "I'm not going to stop Harry. I'm going to help him."
Severus gave her his driest look and replied, "No one can, Miss Matthews. It has been the bane of my existence throughout my life."
"Ha- Harry?"
Harry threw his arms around Draco as the light of the Avada Kadavra fell on them both and the weapon. Draco squeezed his eyes closed, pressing a kiss to the top of Harry's head. "You idiot, I'm already dead."
Finally the suit was made and presented to the prince on the night before his birthday. In the preceding year Draco had received many presents from his father, but none so precious to him as stories about his mother. And with each story he received a token that belonged to the woman, a miniature golden spinning wheel, a tiny copper thimble, and on the night he was presented the shining suit of stars, a silver ring that the queen received from her own father when she was betrothed.
There was no one else in sight and the house had an air of quiet that was very rare in the usually bustling domicile. He got up quietly so as not to wake his godfather, and moved toward the bathroom.
Harry snorted, then giggled slightly as the action caused a bubble of mucous to form and break. He blew his nose again and slumped in the car seat. "Yeah. I don't know where it came from, but it's been building." he turned to Paige with a serious expression in his shining green eyes. "We're never going to be normal, are we?"
Hurriedly tying back his hair and throwing the cloak on over his clothes, Draco pulled the hood down low over his face, hoping to hide himself until he could get to his room.
The first touch of flesh against flesh, and Draco sighed, "Fuck me."
After a few minutes Harry looked up at Severus, the storm clouds in his eyes gone. "Did I really hurt him? Draco, I mean."
And of course, there were pictures of Lily.
"I should show you how I feel," Harry said, pressing a leather covered knee between the other boy's legs to caress the cotton clad thigh of his boyfriend. He slowly guided Draco to the bed, gently pushing him down on the surface.
Still staring into the fridge, she said, "Chris, if you don't give those back, I may have to beat you to death."
"No one but Harry," Draco muttered. "If he dies, I'll kill him."
"Master," the female Death Eater said and as Harry looked over at her he saw her pointing past Harry, past Voldemort, to the blond figure in the shadows.
Paige shot Spike a doubting look, but he was wearing his most honest expression. Not that it meant much coming from an admittedly evil and proud of it 'Big Bad' vampire, but the blond did seem to be trying.
Dampness soaked into the shoulder of his robe and he distantly remembered Draco's 'problem' and tried to control himself, tried to stop, but it was too late. Years of fighting, of hiding, treachery and torture, watching friends and enemies and his own students dead or dying, and it would all hit him now.
As the years turned, the kingdom of Slytherin changed. The King no longer cared for his people and the land knew it. The markets and trade collapsed and taxes grew higher at the King's whim. The people turned to banditry for money, for food. The king left his rooms but rarely, letting his advisers come to him and pour their poison in his ear.
"—ing little ferret. You knew where I was. You knew, and you never said anything, just that you had to leave. Well if you had to leave then why don't you bloody well just go!"
Severus awoke on his bed, he was on top of his coverlet, but a light throw from the study had been swaddled around his chest. His head felt heavy, muzzy, and he wondered if this had been another night he would never remember.
"I have to go back."
Draco looked at Harry, then at Chris who seemed to be leering. "I'm not sure which is safer. I know where the hotel is, but I don't want to leave you alone with Harry."
Draco didn't know he had fallen to his knees until Harry crouched down next to him.
"Are we on a first name basis, Mr. Malfoy? Because that would imply a certain level of familiarity, of intimacy, found amongst family and good friends. Certainly the type of relationship wherein, if you died, you would tell me."
The moon's light traced a course across the infirmary through the thin windows set up near the ceiling and slowly the light grew brighter and warmer with the coming of the false dawn.
Harry couldn't resist. "Narcissus?" Then he winced as Draco punched him, hard, in the arm.
Rubbing his eyes carefully, Severus took in the man before him. Tall, but thin, pale skin stretched over aristocratic bones, and white blond hair. When light eyebrows arched over laughing grey eyes, Snape gasped. "Draco?"
"I survived, Harry. I'm strong enough for you."
Harry closed his eyes as he felt the pressure of a cool hand against his forehead.
The rain had gotten harder, but the blond boy was enjoying the stinging pressure on his skin. Even the voice of his lover wasn't enough to distract him.
His eyes widened at the sight. It was amazing. Courtiers danced with maids and the fine ladies of the court with footmen. Even Hagrid was there, nodding his head along with the music. And what music it was, filling the ballroom with longing notes, like hope and lost love. Before he knew what he was doing Draco was moving across the floor and towards the band.
Spike smirked, "Poor lad. Can't help it if he shares my good looks. All the women fallin' at his feet."
Severus vaguely remembered Draco, but he knew the last thing he saw was teary brown eyes.
Harry had suggested America due to its distinct lack of intervening oceans, and the two boys had spent weeks planning the perfect trip. Including, at Harry's suggestion and Draco's insistence, a trip to both Disney Land and Disney World for evidence to support their claim to be 'the most magical place on Earth.'
Harry heard Ron run down the stone hall, and slowly followed Poppy's directions, settling Draco gently on an empty cot. The tremors had stopped, and the boy would have looked at peace, if he wasn't flushed and still mumbling. Harry tried to decipher what Draco was saying, but gave up as Snape swept through the room.
"What gave you that idea," Harry grumbled, pushing his robes back over his hips so he could tuck his hands in his pants pockets.
Harry held his breath, waiting for the confession.
Draco hadn't wanted to come. Reluctantly acquitted by testimony and penseive memories, he still spent the duration of the war in circumstances only slightly better than they would have been had he actually been guilty of the Headmasters death. Living in squalor and brewing the potions he was ordered to as the Order trooped back and forth through Grimmaud Place, he'd actually contributed greatly to the victory of the light, but now all he wanted to do was rest in the shadows.
As the bell rang, Draco pulled away. As he did he noticed a shimmer from Harry's hand and pulled it closer. The ring was on his finger, and when he saw it Draco felt tears well up in his eyes.
Chris smiled like an angel. "You don't trust me?" He pouted, but Harry could see laughter in his eyes. "So come with me."
The boy turned to face him.
Probably for the best he'd always preferred blokes.
Harry started at the word and looked from Chris to the woman. She did look a bit older than him, but nowhere near old enough to be his mother. Looking at Draco he saw the blond mouth, "I'll explain later," and he tried to relax. This was a strange house and it was probably safer if he kept his head down for a while.
He'd thought the last one would be the worst. He had to dress as a singing and dancing omelet to spy on a Death Eater meeting house across the street from a chain restaurant.
Paige had long ago picked up on what her sisters had not. Draco wasn't there to help them, to back Chris up on the white lighter duties for the Charmed Ones. Draco was there to guide and protect Chris.
Draco pressed his hand against his face, feeling for the scratch he remembered getting from the broken chair, but there was nothing.
The older man smiled slightly, "Alright, I believe you. And I'm impressed. But my char—former charges aren't going to be as easy to impress as I am, especially, "he continued with a smile, "with a fifteen year old boy."
Harry remembered the light, but he couldn't place it exactly. The same was true of the delicate penmanship of the note. But the news it contained wiped the faint trace of memory away before Harry had time to consider it.
All at once the stiffness and tension seemed to fall out of Harry and Severus stepped forward as the Gryffindor's knees began to buckle. Before he could reach the boy, however, Harry straightened up and when he looked at Severus his eyes were full of pain. "You don't need to fight, Severus. Stay in the dungeons, in your labs and your quarters where things are quiet and peaceful, safe."
"Go," Harry asked, hearing himself be echoed by Snape, who had stayed strangely quiet through the speech.
The moment was broken, by a gruff clearing of the throat. "So, why are you here?"
He restrained a flinch as he felt a cold hand settle on his forehead.
Still the kitchen was short staffed, and the balls could not be postponed, so the man agreed. Pomphrey taught Draco to cook when he was a child, reasoning that everyone should know something of how to care for themselves, and Draco had a soup recipe that he felt would be easy to make and of a suitable quality for the guests. He explained the recipe to Remus and the man looked interested, so Draco was left to cook with a warning that he not let any hair fall into the food.
Paige turned to the only other occupant of the room, Draco.
He let out a hysterical laugh and jumped to his feet, noticing briefly that he was healed of the bruises and broken bones he remembered. "Okay? It will be okay? I'm dead you daft bitch!"
Harry paused. He wasn't sure how to answer and decided to go for his old standby, the truth. Neville was good about keeping private things private and Harry knew he wouldn't make a fuss.
He opened his eyes but all he could see was white. There was a blinding light at the edges of his vision and as it cleared the whiteness came into focus.
"… What?"
"Hello, Professor Snape."
Luckily Draco did. "Of course we would, you daft bastard. If you think I'm letting some nobody teach my godson how to fly, how to dress, and how to pick up girls, you are sorely mistaken."
Half collapsing on a delicate wooden chair he dropped his head to his knees and took deep breaths, trying to calm his stomach and regain his equilibrium.
"I'll watch the house. Tell me how it went?"
"Better," Paige asked.
"What are you going to do? You can't stop him," Hermione said.
"Draco tried, his hands were glowing, but Severus made him help me first. When he got to Sev Draco just, his eyes rolled back… If you can heal Snape, I'll do anythi—anything you want. Please, he saved me, they saved me and my baby."
Again Chris looked at Severus before answering. "He's at a club in Oxnard. It's about three hundred miles from here. You'd think Severus could handle it since the trip from Scotland was almost eight times that, but he was so gree-"
Watching the smoke curl through the cool morning air, he shoved his free hand in his pocket. The sharp sensation of a paper cut met him and he pulled out the crumpled note he had stuffed out of the way hours earlier.
That night as the other workers made their way to the ballroom, Draco hid, and when the coast was clear he returned to the pump house and changed into the suit made to challenge the noonday sun.
"Do you?"
"Draco, are you all right? You're as pale as death."
"You know you should return that, Harry," he said, smiling.
When she caught his eye, he winked at her.
"Draco?"
With no thought to his friends welfare, Ron said, "He was there."
Draco smiled. "So did Hermione. When we came back in she half-demanded Harry tell her how it went."
The blond, clearly surprised, went down like a tree and Severus was torn between following Harry as the brunet stalked out of the Hall, and checking on Draco who was still sitting on the floor, a confused expression on his bleeding face.
"We are quite well, though not in agreement," Severus replied, prompting Draco to glare at him.
Hermione shook her head. "We saw him running off towards the battlefield but no one's reported seeing him fight. There was a small tent at the back of the field. My people think that's where the weapon is. And if the weapon's there, Voldemort is as well. We're trying to get a team in, but no one can get close."
"Phoebe, you should calm down. You have a concussion."
Hearing Ron shout across the battlefield, Harry felt himself once again brought to the ground by their former enemy, now comrade in arms.
Hermione gasped. "We have to sever their connection before we destroy the weapon, or he could-"
The fear and shock in his eyes had been replaced by confidence and serenity and she knew that in those brief moments Ron had gone from man who fathered a child to a father.
Draco shook his head. There was no time to explain, no time to mourn his charge. Too many lives had been lost already. He gritted his teeth against the hollowness. "No, doesn't matter. We have to fight."
Draco took a deep breath, "Except for being exhausted and frustrated and now, smelling like sick and demon."
Draco pushed himself upright, absently helping Severus stand as well, and glared at Chris. "Don't you 'hey Draco' me. What's wrong with Harry?"
Paige wasn't sure what in that could have driven Harry off, though. Knowing how much the two boys cared for each other, she would have thought that hearing Draco wanted to be with him for eternity would have sent Harry running into the room, not away.
The boy looked down, the smile on his face fading a bit. Under his breath he mumbled, "I'm afraid I don't," and Paige filed the comment away in her mental file of things to ask him once they were out of the house and free of the pressured atmosphere.
"But you're my little baby boy, Draco. Aren't you? Aren't you? Just say it," the woman said as Draco's face turned a vibrant shade of red and Paige tried to fight a growing grin.
At that Hermione snorted and Harry saw Neville and Chris leer.
"Aloe is the first thing, and mallow to sooth the internal burns."
There were feathers. Draco wanted to reach out and feel them, see if they were real, but his arms felt leaden and heavy. There was a weight on his chest, he looked down and saw Harry resting against him. Draco gently nudged the other boy, but Harry didn't respond.
"Well, geez, don't be so enthusiastic," Paige said, taking a drink from her own glass. "So I guess they couldn't resist the charms of Severus Snape?"
For the first time in years, Severus felt the dark prickle of tears. Breathing heavily, he put his hands over his face, trying to control himself. He had not cried in years, and he would be damned if he was going to start now.
Snape had more than enough on his hands anyway. The call for his more toxic potions had gone down, but the need for healing tinctures had risen astronomically.
"Enough!" Voldemort shouted, shoving Harry to the side and rising.
Draco nodded but didn't let go so Harry had to physically remove the other boy's hands. "Come on."
Paige froze, figuratively, because with Piper behind her, if she didn't she'd be frozen literally.
And Draco hadn't contacted him.
"Harry James Potter. I am giving you a makeover, and at this point I don't even care whether you want it or not. Now, if I tell you to shave your head and spend the rest of your life jumping up and down on one foot, you will do it and you will thank me. Understood?"
Laughing again Draco accepted his offer and together they swung into a gentle waltz. They danced their first dance with Draco's hand on Harry's waist and he smiled when the other prince shivered. Then it was his turn to shiver when they switched positions for the second dance and he felt the heat of Harry's palm against his lower back.
"Okay, fine. It was a trap. Now get off of me, you bastard."
"It's my assignment, and whether they think so or not, they need me."
The voice was a harsh whisper and Draco didn't recognize it. All he knew was that he had been seen. Pulling the cloak tighter around himself to hide his distinctive pale hair, he turned and ran for his cave. Behind him he heard horses and dogs. Why hadn't he known they were there? How could he have missed them?
Paige reached forward to check on him at the same time Harry turned around and now it was Paige's turn to freeze. She couldn't name the look in Harry's eyes, something like pain or fear, or an awful resignation.
"Well, go tend it."
He rubbed the back of his neck, trying to formulate an answer but as soon as he opened his mouth he was cut off.
Dropping his lenses back into place, Harry stood up again, shaking the exhaustion off as best he could and taking a deep breath. The only way in, the only one that might work, might be unexpected enough to succeed, was a frontal assault. He would have to move in hard and fast, curses flying, and pray that he got pat the guards and the wards and into that tent.
"I have to go Draco, but you think about what I asked you, okay?"
Draco turned away first, burying his head in his hands. He heard Pansy and Blaise muttering to each other, but he was drunk and couldn't be arsed to try and hear what they were saying.
Severus started. Normally Harry avoided discussing his mortality, though Severus knew it was on the boy's mind.
But over the intervening weeks they corresponded by mushy letter and lengthy and vaguely obscene mirror chats every few days and Harry was working on finding a window to go visit.
"It was pouring bloody cats and dogs out there."
Around them, chunks of demon oozed onto the grey slate floor of the cave, but while Chris had managed to stay largely free of any flying slime, Draco had not. Draco saw some small satisfaction on the other boy's face as he accepted the hand the brunette offered and rose to his feet.
"You will be tomorrow."
"Oh, Jesus. It's the baby isn't it," she muttered, then heard a loud crack.
The advisor stood, gathering his dignity around him like the folds of his cloak. "I am sorry my Lord, but your grief has warped your mind. This thing you would do is wrong."
"It's no problem, you were choking."
Draco chuckled and stepped closer, putting his arm around Harry's waist. "I suppose this would be a good time to tell you that you're beautiful when you're angry," the grey eyed boy said.
"That's enough self-pity, please. We have more important concerns."
A burst of light and noise as Weasel's head popped out through the doors, "Harry? Are you out here? Come back in, we're playing cards."
Draco nodded.
The weapon was on its way to Britain.
"Who was that?"
But Harry didn't stop, didn't pull away. The two men kissed as Draco heard the Weasel sputter and stomp off, out of the room.
"All right, what's going on?"
Finally, he gave in, "Alright, but I want you to remember that all of this was your idea tomorrow."
Paige followed her sister into the kitchen, silently mouthing 'our.'
"Is something wrong," Severus asked, and Paige shivered at the deep richness of his voice.
Paige saw Phoebe's eyes misting up and she felt tears building in her eyes as well. It was just too tragically romantic.
"Where are they?"
"How what went?"
This time when they stopped Harry didn't pull away, but stayed in Draco's arms as the stars twinkled above them and night birds sang in the wild overgrowth of the garden.
Black eyes met hers over the fluffy green expanse.
"Now, now, Harry. Such poor sssportsmanship is unsightly," Voldemort hissed out.
Two months later, Harry caught a stray curse, not even meant for him, but he didn't fight it off. He smiled as the green light hit him, and people said it was the most peaceful he'd ever looked.
Clearing his throat roughly to chase back the show of emotion, Severus gently took his hand back, and used it to adjust his blankets again before turning to Paige with the best sneer in his arsenal.
Paige rolled her eyes, waving Spike away when his example threatened to become more explicit. "Yeah, yeah. I get it. But we're not in love. I'm just… curious."
"I may keep my cloak," he asked and Harry nodded. "Then I shall do it."
...nothing happened.
Harry stood on, his wand in his hand as Paige joined Draco on the bed and lent her power to healing Severus.
It was Harry's birthday so Draco had given him a romantic week-end in a luxury hotel in the heart of Muggle London. In thanks for this gift Harry had offered to spend the entire time in his 'makeover wardrobe' when the boys were dressed at all. It had been a satisfactory week-end all around.
"Knife!"
Holding Draco at arms length, Snape looked at the boy. Well, man.
While Harry knew Ron had nothing against werewolves, he also knew that it would break the boy's heart. Weres couldn't marry, couldn't have children. Ron had been planning his wedding to Zabini for the past few months, and the family they would have afterwards. If that got stolen now, Harry wasn't sure what the red-head might do.
Draco smirked, "Do you deserve to?"
Paige opened her mouth to yell at the blond when the two pulled apart and she got a better look at the stranger.
Rubbing the back of his neck, Draco turned to Blaise, a thick weariness in his every muscle, and said, "What happened to me?"
He half-choked, but controlled himself because they really were quite delicious, as Hermione got that perverted gleam in her eye and turned to Draco.
"I don't know the purpose of your 'Elders' or what they could want from you in this situation, surrounded by people you care about who are always in pain or injured, but if this continues it may end your existence."
Paige pulled up a chair, and grabbed an orange out of the bowl on the table. Starting the peel with her thumb, she squinted as she felt a burst of sharp juice hit her cheek just under her eye.
Hemmed in by the three women Harry was gently nudged towards the kitchen table, so he took a seat and watched as the three took chairs around him.
"And Pomphrey?"
The red head shot a glare at Draco before turning back to Harry, "You should get your eyebrow done. It would highlight your eyes really well."
And Draco was sitting on the rug, limned in light from the flames, just staring into the embers. It was so familiar, and so strange.
Once they were gone, Draco rushed forward to lock the door, then collapsed to the ground and wept. He was falling apart, his life was falling apart. He was trapped with a madman and Severus's life hung on he king's whim. Sick and panicking and nauseous, Draco curled up into a ball on the floor.
But even as he tried not to think about it, it became more vivid and Paige's dark eyes turned bright leaf green, the baby's auburn hair turned black, and in his memory Lily Potter nee Evans was abandoning him again.
In response, Wyatt grinned wider, baring toothless gums, and slapped the tray attached to his high chair, sending bits of dry cereal onto the floor.
Draco choked on his own spit, he was so enraged and shocked. After a few minutes of coughing, his eyes watering, he said, "No cause? I've no cause to be rude? My father just killed me. I am, in fact, dead. Formerly living. I am an ex-Draco."
Ron took one of the empty chairs and smiled over at his friend before looking up at Paige and Piper. "He's just a softy really. Fight all day until he's soaked to the skin in other people's blood, but watch someone he loves get hurt and he's passed out on the floor." Ron looked down at the baby in his arms and made a face. "Your Uncle Harry's silly, isn't he? Isn't he? He's just a big marshmallow with a scar on his head, isn't he?"
He didn't take the picture. He'd found it, or rather, it had been given to him in a plain white unmarked envelope slipped under the door of his quarters in Hogwarts.
"No, no," the blond gasped out. "It's something- stabbing…"
Paige grinned and looked over at the laughing crowd.
Hearing the Weasels' voice, Draco braced himself for Harry to pull away from the kiss, excusing it as some of that muggle 'breath of life,' as they'd done once before when they were caught.
The Death Eater died in a pain beyond screams.
Warm fingers brushed against Draco's cheek and he opened his eyes, seeing Harry gazing up at him shyly.
He was a fifteen year old boy, and would remain one for eternity.
The brunet shrugged. "So tell me. I'm bored as anything in here, entertain me."
Severus was shocked. "Draco told you?" He couldn't believe that his godson would be so callous, but Harry was destroyed, so something must have happened.
Draco shook his head quickly. The guards were fingering their scabbards and Draco could see the glitter of madness in Lucius' eyes.
Draco took a deep breath that was promptly knocked out of him as he felt something heavy hit his side. He opened his eyes to see that Harry had thrown himself in front of Voldemort and even now glared balefully up at the man.
With no destination in mind.
A dull thud as trainers hit the stone floor and Ron snuffled something, but didn't wake.
"I want it, I mean- don't make me ask for something I can never have." Full of a terrible anxiety and despair Draco pushed Shannon's hands away and stood, pacing the floor of the living room. "Of course I want a lifetime with him, Shannon, I love him. But I can't have it. I'm not alive, how can I ask him to shackle his destiny to some dead thing. Some monster, a child in a man's body forever? How can I do that to him?"
Pulling on the suit he felt like a ghost, like a spirit of the night. He felt beautiful. And with his heart in his throat he made his way back into the castle.
As the white mist cleared, Paige saw Piper's face blanch.
Draco opened his mouth to demand answers, or guidance of some sort, but he bit it back when he felt Severus's hand on his arm. "Fine, you can't tell me anything about the future. How about the past then? Or the present? Where did you leave Harry?"
An hour later they orbed back. Chris was bleeding from three long slashes down his back, Paige was limping and had the early beginnings of a lovely black eye, and Draco was thoroughly singed.
Lucius made time to spend with his son. The members of his council had long since taken on the role of ruling Slytherin and Lucius saw no reason to change this arrangement so he was free to follow his own desires. Long afternoons would stretch into evening as Lucius grew to know and love his son.
Spike flashed the wicked grin that had always meant trouble and said, "Now, now; if she thinks a minute, she'll guess where the tyke is."
"Anytime, love."
When he was done recounting events the boy was Slytherin green. Severus acted quickly, getting a basin for Harry to sick up in. after that the boy was more than half asleep. Severus carried him into the second bedroom in his quarters, a guest room for the guests he never had.
Harry watched the blond walk over to the table, absently admiring the look of his arse in a pair of dark denims. He noticed Paige and Severus walking away at the same time, but before he could think too much about it Hermione was tugging on his sleeve, demanding details on the romantic awakening he and Draco had undergone in the garden.
Hermione and Neville had returned to their teams, research and strategy respectively, and Harry went into seclusion with the heads of the various strike forces to be updated on the current situation.
Draco thrust Wyatt into his mother's arms, pressed his now empty hands to his ears and orbed out of the basement.
Paige rolled her eyes, then clenched them shut as a contraction seemed to roll through Blaise's body and into his arm and hand, turning her fingers into an extension of his pain.
"I meant my mate's place. Alex's club has an extensive underground level warded against everything up to and including magical and nuclear war."
Not knowing the gravity of his wife's condition, the King was overjoyed. Every day that Narcissa was pregnant was another day he adored her, a day that he found her more beautiful than any previous. But as she reached the end of her eighth month, she began to weaken. Her skin, already fair, paler to a sickly hue, and her eyes gained a strange fire as though they were the only thing keeping her and the child within her alive.
He braced himself the best he could, but still staggered from the weight. Beautiful though the woman was, Shannon still had two stone on Draco and made no bones about reminding the boy she could overbear him.
When they landed in the cave Severus staggered slightly, his head and stomach spinning. But he shook off the dizziness and nausea quickly; there was no time for weakness. Harry was chained to the side of the cave, hanging from shackles bolted into the stone wall. There was no blood, but even from a few fret away Severus could see the fine tremors that shook the brunette's body.
Then, chagrined, "And I'm sure Spike will help too."
No, it was something older, and more sentimental. The sight of a red haired girl with a newborn in her arms and a glowing smile.
Draco smiled at that, and covered his godfather's hand with his own. Behind him, Paige smiled, wider this time.
"We know you're awake, Harry. We've known for a while."
"You're certainly lively for a dead man," the red-headed woman commented.
"All right, Tom. You're talking a big game. So where is this weapon of yours?" The red slitted eyes widened slightly and Harry grinned. "Yeah, I know about it. So come on, this is the point in the movie where you describe your super evil plan, and then the horrific and esoteric method by which you're going to kill me. Let's get on with things, shall we? Time's a wasting."
"Help! Paige! Chris! Dear God, please help me!"
From the corner of her eye Paige saw Harry walk over to Draco and get the blond's attention. After a few minutes of quiet conversation the two of them headed off towards the garden and Paige smiled.
Shaking himself out of his musings, he realized she was still talking, "…that damn vampire! And don't think I don't know anything about you two, I've seen you talking. I don't care who sent him, he's evil, and a menace, and he's eating me out of house and home. Where's Wyatt?"
Cursing himself for letting his reaction show, Draco braced himself for the teasing that was about to fall on him.
"What, precisely, does Potter's emotional upset have to do with me?"
Three hours later, a small burst of blue light appeared on the table. When it disappeared, a small vial and a note were left behind.
"I think we need a little more privacy," he went on, waving at the air around the three men and winking broadly.
At once all of the strength seemed to go out of the man's limbs as his knees buckled. Paige managed to get up off the couch, over the coffee table, and to his side in time to keep him from falling completely to the floor. Staggering under his limp weight, she half-carried, half-dragged him to the love seat, laying his lanky form across it.
"…he fainted, but it's a common occurrence. I gave him a card with the care instructions. The swelling should go down in about a week, though it will take some getting used to. He'll have to have soft foods for the first few days, and gargle with salt water to clean it. If there is any strange discharge, give me a call or take him to the doctors. Believe me, you do not want this infected."
Ron paled and Harry took a step back from the vehemence in the boy's voice, bumping into another brunette woman who chuckled slightly.
Acting as normally as he could, he'd dropped the damp rag back in his bin and walked to the bar, slipping out the back door.
Part of her wanted to run screaming but the larger part of her was on the verge of tears at what was happening and the part she was able to play.
His need for information fed, Blaise left the room pleading a need of another kind. Paige and Phoebe politely refused his offer of a curry and vanilla ice cream sundae. Piper had gone into the kitchen with Wyatt while they were talking to salvage as much of dinner as she could and the thick warm scent of spices was floating through the house.
Severus watched Ron return to the back bedroom while Harry and Draco wandered off to join the others at the stereo.
Draco nodded, his fists clenching at his sides as the guards moved forward to flank Severus. Silently they led the man out of the room, and after another kiss, the king followed.
Draco wasn't sure how to respond. Caught between sentences he choked on his own thoughts, the world graying around him as Blaise rushed forward and slapped the blond on the back.
Draco's eyes flickered open slowly, and Paige saw blood red coating his grey irises as the whitelighter groaned and said, "Harry."
Severus came back to his rooms from his shift in the Infirmary and found Harry on the floor in front of the fire, staring into the flames.
"But when you died, you hated me, and I hated you right back." Harry bit his tongue a second too late to stop the words from escaping and waited for the inevitable tantrum.
Before Paige had the chance to say anything the red headed woman stormed across the room and grabbed Draco up in a massive embrace, lifting the boy off of the couch and into her arms, his feet dangling inches above the floor.
Silently, he watched the blond cross the room to his favorite spot, the worn fur rug, close to the fire, but out of the light. As he watched he catalogued the things he should have noticed.
Severus let himself smile at the memories. He would have to show this picture to Draco. Though Lucius had changed under the rule of the Dark Lord, there was a time when he was a regular teen and maybe it would give Draco some peace to know that his father was once a beaky little twat like every other fourteen year old on the planet.
Still, Paige sometimes wished for a night that interesting. She got stuck with a lot of the week-day shifts. Small crowds and no action. Piper said it was because she had the least experience of the three of them. Paige tried to argue that Piper had Wyatt to take care of, and Phoebe was still missing her powers, but her sisters wouldn't hear of it.
He woke up on the couch again with a splitting head ache. He heard a soft giggle and opened his eyes carefully to see Wyatt playing on the floor.
Trusting Spike to handle things on his own Severus looked over at Chris and Harry. The trembling had stopped, but the green eyed boy was unconscious and deathly still. Chris looked over his shoulder at Severus, "I can heal him, but I can't do it here and I don't have the strength to orb us all back to the Manor."
"Vampire?" Severus set his tea cup on the saucer carefully, hoping the slight chime of porcelain against porcelain wouldn't betray his trembling fingers, "A vampire?"
Draco stepped past the shadowy confines of the tent and into bright sunlight. Blinking to clear his glare-blinded and tearing eyes, he moved carefully, trying to get to the side of the battlefield and the cover of the bushes.
One minute he was walking into the motel room with Ron at his side, eyes still glued to the photos of Blaise, and then he was confronted with a shimmering ray of blue sparks and Dracos's panicked face before his hand was taken in a fierce grip and the world fell away.
A rush of hope filled Draco's chest for the first time since he heard Lucius's intentions. "Plans?"
"Well then, what about the time you 'borrowed' Hermione's clip on hoop earrings and spent three hours trying them on different parts of your body, including your nipp—"
Blaise was still nattering on, "I think I felt a kick. It was faint, but it was there. Pom said it might be gas, but I don't believe her. Do you think the baby'll have red hair? I think I'd hate that. Well, maybe a dark red would be nice. Sev, do you think mine and Ron's hair will mix well? Or do you think it will just be flame red?"
There was a feeling in the air, like something was coming, something big.
All eyes turned to Draco, now blinking sleepily.
That didn't stop Blaise and others from asking, at times demanding, to know the trio's whereabouts.
Draco shook his head. "I don't think we needed them. I think this was kind of inevitable. Or at least that's what Harry said."
Then there was a scream.
Severus turned the page and his smile fell away.
And each time, Severus answered the same way.
Spike looked at her, meeting her eyes with a speaking glance before tilting his head in Draco's direction. Paige hoped Spike had an idea as she felt the air around Draco begin to crackle with tension and rage and trusted him, hitting Draco in the back of the head with her emergency kit, which contained several heavy bottles, charmed to be unbreakable.
