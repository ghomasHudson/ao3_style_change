"No it wasn't." Said Ginny unexpectedly. "Belle had come to us saying that she wants to use Room of Requirement to help kids escape."
The door opens and I hold her, pretending to trying to take her clothes of. She yelled and screamed and begged me to let go. Amycus opened the door and saw me forcing her. He looked at the girl and me in anger.
"Yes." Neville smiles.
"I'm proud of you, you know. Trying to prove him consent matters. That's extremely important." Ginny said after a while and Harry smiled.
Harry contemplates for several moments whether he should say the truth or no. He finally goes with yes.
"Mr Malfoy! Please wait! Please listen to me once. Arry is very sorry about everything. He loves you Mr Malfoy, he's broken and regrets it very much. You don't know what appened zat night. You zont know what zey did to make Arry leave you. Give em a chance please. Just zoo ezplain emzelf." The counter girl begged.
"Then you won't question the what ifs. You will move on after a bit of grieving. And you will find happiness again. It's how nature works. Even if it takes time, you will eventually be happy." Marina smiles.

Dear Aunt Romie
He looks back at the little child in his arms who seems to be talking to him in his own babbling language. It's so easy, isn't it? Being a child, not having any responsibility, not having to have the burdens, to be free. There's no chance for him to be free anymore, is there? Ah, here is comes. The tears. He can't. He just can't feel the remorse. He doesn't want to and he tries not to but the tears come anyway. He orphaned so many children in fight for not becoming an orphan himself. All this in vain. He ended up orphan, didn't he? He ended up just how he didn't want to end up. He lost everything.
Draco barely noticed when a man came behind him. His eyes were stuck on Potter. He danced for Potter, knowing Potter was tracking his every move. Suddenly he felt someone behind him, touching their body with Draco's and Draco froze. He turned and tried to get away. He didn't want anyone else touching him. Only Potter. He told the man that he is with Potter, pointing at Potter. That man looked at Potter and apologized to Draco. Then he raised his hands surrendering, looking at Potter, showing he means no harm and walked away. Potter glared at that man but then gave Draco a proud smile. Two months ago, Draco would've never told anyone no. He would've let those strangers, no matter how creepy, touch him. Do whatever they want to Draco. Not anymore. He was Potter's pet. He was owned. He didn't need to say yes to anyone but Potter and he loved every second of it. He walked towards Potter and sat in his lap again. Potter immediately tightened his hold on Draco's hips and kissed his neck, then his chin, his lips, his cheek, his forehead, then his lips. Draco smiled in the kiss.
"The shop in Hogsmade the passage leads, belongs to Aberforth Dumbledore. He is professor Dumbledore's younger brother. The portrait is Ariana Dumbledore, the youngest sister. She had died early. Aberforth has agreed to help us smuggle people out of the castle. Ginny can take them to a secret place where we all work against Dark Lord. Its where the order has their headquarters." She explains.
Harry took Draco in Victoria Secret. The store was filled with pretty lingeries. Harry selected a few lace panties of different colours. Blue, black, red, pink, green, etc. He even selected few matching lace nighties that only reached till Draco's mid thigh. Harry paid for all of it even when Draco insisted he would. Then Harry took Draco to Sephora. Draco bought all the best eye liners and nail paints. Harry even insisted in buying some lipstick for their private times. Harry couldn't wait to see Draco all dolled up. He got hard at the mere thought of it. After all the shopping and a lot of snogging, Harry took Draco to a restaurant for dinner. Draco didn't remember when was the last time he felt so free and happy.
Students started filling the hall. Some people stared at us, some at me, giving me looks of disgust. I sat there with breakfast in front of me. I didn't feel like eating. Since last year, my apatite was almost as good as non- existing.
"Why don't I show you both your room?" Harry asks them and turns to Draco. "Pet, why don't you put on the kettle and get some of those pastries for us all?"
He positively delights as he watches an angry welt form on the milky white skin along with listening to Draco hiss in pain. This blow wasn't very hard, though he's just starting. He has experimented on himself. He knows with all his research that a good dom never does anything on their sub which they are not willing to do on themselves. It is essential that the sub knows they are willing to take it, as a part of bonding and trust. He knows Draco has seen him hit his own hard hard enough as he would like to hit Draco. He raises the cane and gives another swat just a little bit above the previous one. Then another. And another. Welts after welts form on Draco's arse and the back of his thighs. Angry, deep red welts showing off beautifully around the milky white legs and back. Harry has lost count on how much he has hit Draco. Fifteen? Twenty?
Potter's reply makes Draco's head spin. He's always belonged to someone. First his father, then dark lord, then ministry, then his father again who managed to escape azkaban and now lives in France in house arrest. But to belong to Potter, get owned by him, Draco's traitorous heart and cock likes this idea.
Pansy explained how Draco and Belle became friends. I didn't even know who this Belle was. They explained how Draco passed the intel which led to save Ginny and so many children from Greyback. How these four Slytherins stole intel from the private meetings and provided to my friends with the help of Belle.
She straightens her robes and sits on the couch. I sit besides her. "So Draco honey. What the fuck are you doing with these people?" She asks me, not with hatred but with curiosity. I blink at her and she continues. "I saw the way you look at them. You hate them. You saved me from a horrible fate. Yes you're a bullying asshole but you're not a death-eater. So what are you doing with them?"
"Bee." He says soft.
The crimson tinge on Draco's cheeks are so visible as he blushes from Harry's praises. Draco always was a sucker for praises. And Harry loves giving praises.
Just as Darien was about to reply, his phone rings, he picks up with a sigh.
He opens his eyes and looks at Potter's face who has an amused smile. He rests his chin on Potter's chest and gives a small smile.
"Christian." He whispered.
"What? Why?" Smith asks.
Zabini walked towards her and took her in his arms.
Stood in front of Harry was Draco Malfoy with his tight black leather pants, deep grey shirt as grey as his eyes, wearing hoop earrings with long hair and lipgloss. Ron was the first to recover.
I start undressing and he walks towards his dresser. I hear him open and close a drawer. I remove every clothing except my panties. He comes back and stands behind me again. He takes my hands and then he starts tying my wrists with a tie. He ties my wrists really tight. He gets back and looks at me, taking every inch of my body through his eyes. I can feel his gaze and I look down on the floor. My cheeks burn with blushing.
"Belle, you know Hogwarts is going down the shithole. Our parent's, they are on the other side of war. They are death-eaters." Pansy says with sadness in her eyes.
Christian laughs it off and their playful banter goes on for a while. He then clutches Draco's hips.
Teddy went ahead and gave them their rings. They put rings on each other's fingers.
"Mr Olivander." Draco heard Blackburn speak. "Is it true that you were a prisoner in the Malfoy Manor?"
"Why can't you marry me?" Pansy said, her voice cold.
"I didn't mean that way." Marina chuckles. "I meant as a person."
We all reached Nott Manor. We had bought firewhiskey and some snacks with us as we didn't want to go empty handed. When the door opened, I swear I could feel my heart beat  coming out my chest. The door wad opened by Draco. He was wearing a silky white shirt and tight black leather pants. He was bare feet. Draco Malfoy wearing leather pants! His platinum blonde hair falling on his steel grey eyes. He looked beautiful. Beautiful? Since when does Draco looks beautiful to me?
You would make a decent stripper.
"Draco, look at me." Harry says and Malfoy does.
"Does it matter?" Draco asks.
He takes out his pants and underwear. He pulls me up by my hair and I'm kneeling on the bed in front of him. He takes out my panties from my mouth and lays down. I immediately know what I'm suppose to do. I bend down, trying not to fall as my wrists are tied. I then slowly start sucking. I stop and look at him, his dick still in my mouth. I lick his dick with my tongue and play with it while his dick is still in my mouth. He moans in pleasure. He starts getting harder and bigger and more bigger. Its the biggest I've ever had. I start sucking faster, taking it deep and gagging hard on it. He catches my hair and pushes me more deep. I cough, its too much for me but I can't do anything, my hands are tied. I love this feeling of helplessness. He thrusts more deep and fast in my mouth and gag. I need to breath. He stops and takes his dick out of my mouth.
"I will, Pans. When I'm ready. Not now please."
"We're at risk anyways, Scorp. The way things are going between us, we won't be able to stay friends. And what if we end up like mum and dad? Together forever?"
Pansy enters Earl's office who sits there, checking on some documents. Earl was Pansy's boss.
Once done, I go to the class. Its like always, first class with Gryffindors.
"Yes, Master. I want you to do this spell on me." Draco replies.
"Beg for it."
"Then I'll leave this topic alone and never remind you that you can say no." Potter says.
"Why don't we find out?" Draco smirks.
"So what names have you both thought?" Ron asked.
Draco blushes furiously as he slowly lifts his
"He's Harry Potter. He won't let it affect you. And if it does, he'll be there with you."
"Draco." She looks at me sad. "People are going to think you have done this."
"Oh! What a coincidence. I found my phone. Give me your number now please."
"Oh, it does hurt, but when you've been getting this treatment all your life, you kind of get addicted to it. Also, the fact that I like the pain helps." Draco said rather conversationally like his hair is not being pulled so hard that it will rip apart from his skull.
But Draco will be damned if he let Potter in again after being thrown out that way. He's still got some pride left. He's still a Malfoy. So he does what he thinks is best. He gives Potter a sad smile.
"Harry." Draco breathes.
Belle let out a laugh and said, "Don't let these purebloods fool you Harry. Blaise is a hardcore disney fan, Pansy loves muggle baking and dishes, Theo knows each and every muggle song of our time by heart, Draco drowns himself in shakespeare. He loves muggle novels. Draco and I, we comforted each other by discussing at leave two novels a week. So, what do you like?"
He bobs his head slowly and swirls his tongue all over the lean, elegant, pale cock. He hollows his cheeks and sucks Draco's cock like his life depends on it. It doesn't take much more than two minutes for Draco to cum which isn't surprising if the poor sod's been edging since three weeks. Harry stops sucking and replaces his hand with his mouth and looks at Draco's eyes wide, pleading, questioning. Harry smirks and watches Draco swallow as he gets his answer. Harry continues fisting Draco's spent cock, not giving it time to rest.
"The order has made a few places as hideouts to help as many escapes as possible. We've made all arrangements. Ginny has gone home and she's safe there. She's with her family."
"Yes." Draco replies.
Once Harry removed Draco's panties, he started to kiss Draco's ass. He then started to lick Draco's hole and slowly worked his tongue inside. Draco let out pleasurable moans. After fucking Draco with his tongue, Harry took some lube and applied it in and around Draco's hole. He then pushed one finger inside Draco and slowly kept going in and out. Then He put another finger but kept the slow pace. Harry put another finger and Draco's moans kept getting louder. After a few minutes of fingering, Harry applies lube on himself and slowly enters Draco.
Bulstrode backed away a little.
"Mr Draco Malfoy. 10 NEWTS and will be partners with Mr Theodore Nott for the ngo. Will also be learning law to work for half breeds and non human folks of wizarding world." The crowd went silent. Draco kept his head high. As he walked on stage, his friends started to cheer. The Gryffindors included. The cheers grew louder. McGonagall hugged him and told him how proud she was.
You mean Sirius damage? Moony I've been damaged since birth.
"Where have you been?" Draco narrows his eyes.
"How long have you been in France, Harry?" Andromeda asked as she set the kettle.
Belle, Pansy and Luna shared one dorm. Hermione, Ginny, Hannah shared another dorm. Harry, Ron, Theo and Blaise shared one dorm. Draco and Teddy had their own adjoining rooms.
"Sorry I'm late." Potter smiled.
"You'll meet her in two weeks." Harry says.
"How dare you laugh?" Said the other woman. "We're going to make you regret you were ever born." She spat.
Narcissa laughs as Nicholas spashes some water on her. They both were cleaning the kitchen after an intense dessert fight which then turned into an intense chocolate filled love making session with a tied up Narcissa. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Narcissa, she's never been more happier in life. She is with the man she loves, who loves her back, respects her, treats her kindly, and even her son. She is back with her sister she lives with now, helping her raise their grandson. A bundle of joy he is, Teddy Lupin who always turns his hair blonde whenever he watches Narcissa or Draco appear. She's back with her son who is also free of Lucius and is happy with the man he loves. And most importantly, she's free. She looks at Nicholas wiping his hands on a washcloth. His messy back curls falling on his eyes and bronze skin gleaming in the kitchen light.
Belle looked at him stunned, then her expressions softened.
Draco cuts the call.
"Yes Master." Draco says immediately. "I love being used for your entertainment and not having any relief." He says with a sob.
"May I ask why do you believe it's me?" Harry asked.
"You guys leave for the dorm. I'll drop Belle to her common room." I say. Everyone nods. I take off the wards and charms. The three walk to the Slytherin room while I walk with Belle to the Ravenclaw common room.
Draco knew this meant something huge. Something that wasn't as simple as just giving them a warning. And he knew that he didn't want to know what Potter did to them. But he did something to them. Something horrible. And he did it because they hurt Draco. A tear rolled down from the side of his eyes to the bed. Someone cared enough for him to do something like this. He had seen Draco's real self and he still was with Draco. He still owned Draco. He avenged for Draco. Potter scooted forward on his chair and placed a kiss on Draco forehead, that's when he realised, he loves Potter. For the first time, he has hope. Hope that will won't go down in flames. Hope that this can last. Hope that he will forever be Potter's. He was hardly aware that he looked at Potter awestruck, with a smile that shows Potter how much he adores him. How much he loves him.
Nura asked.
Draco Malfoy. He always had something so delicious about him." She smiled.
"I've been thinking about it since you talked about it. I want to belong to you." Draco says again.
He delights as Draco blushes.
Potter says this with such intensity looking into Draco's eyes that as much as Draco wants to believe its a lie, he can't. And a treacherous part of Draco's mind helps him with the suggestion that if anyone can understand half the things Draco has been through, it's Potter. Because Potter, like Draco, is broken and fucked up. Also, the bastard used Draco's given name and Merlin and Morgana it sounds sweet from his lips.
"Yes. I want to try." Draco blushes as he looks down.
"Didn't you sleep?" Harry heard Draco asking. He turned to Draco and smiled.
"Shush. You're angry. At who? At men? At people? At destiny? At the world? Pour it out, Pansy. You should never let it fester. Always pour it out. Let it out. Come on. Let it all out."
"Godric Draco! That was like years ago." He laughs. He gives a nod and leaves. I lay down on my bed.
"What?" Harry asks because he is sure he heard something like Draco going shopping with Ginny.
"Harry. Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry." Draco chants.
"Are you awake?" Draco asks quietly.
It's a beautiful quote that is put on her tombstone. She did end the war. Lied to Voldemort on his face to get to Draco. Her love for Draco made it possible for Potter's side to win. Her love made it possible that Draco was safe. Her love that Draco will no longer have. He turns and walks towards his Aunt Andromeda. He pulls out his mother's necklace. He knows what's in there. A picture of all three black sisters, laughing as teenagers, free of all the pressures of the war. He takes his aunt's hand and places the necklace in her hands and leaves. He doesn't wait to see his aunt recognised the pendant. He doesn't wait to see his aunt burst in tears clutching the necklace to her chest. Instead he walks towards the winter garden.
Belle groans in frustration but apparently that is exactly what she needed. Blaise knew that is what she needed. Belle wanted release and she wanted the touch but she knew better than to disobey. She opened the window and lit a cigarette.
The walk is silent. Belle finally breaks the silence once we reach near the ravenclaw common room.
"Did you mean it? Whatever you said that morning we made the bet." He finally asks.
"Merlin Dray. That's a good plan!" Blaise exclaims.
Malfoy's eyes are a beautiful mixture of silver and grey with specks of blue.
"Well then I'm gonna do that now. " Theo said and got up.
"Stop whining." I tell her emotionlessly and she tries to quite down. I hate seeing her like this. "Thanks Amycus." I tell him and close the door.
"What?" Blaise and Pansy squealed.
"Oh my god! Where were his hands?" Astoria leans forward excited.
"You slimey Slytherin snake!" James grins.
"Yes, pet?"
"This is it! I've had it with the ministry. Ministry is incompetent along with you. I clearly asked them for an expert. I gave them a list of skills that the professor needed to have. You're fired. Please leave immediately. And do tell the ministry that I do not want a replacement. I'll find a replacement myself." McGonagall was so furious and terrifying that Storm didn't even argue.
"And?" Ron asks as if its no surprise and Hermione pinches her nose.
"What? Why?" Pansy asked.
"Darien, it's too late." Draco replies.
"You leave me again and it will be the last time you do so." Hera sobs as she holds his hands in hers..
"My house doesn't feel like home anymore. I dread every evening I will have to spend with him. Because it means another day of fight, another night reminding us that everything is over. He loved me so much, now he wouldn't even bother to spare a minute for me during our anniversary. I have no idea what went wrong. I have no idea what I did wrong that my marriage is in shreds. And everyone thinks that we're this perfect couple. We haven't kissed once in months." Draco's feels the silent tears leave and Harry and he remain seated there, holding hands.
"It's done Andy. You can't change ot now. You can however, make it easier for us to help her. You are safe, Andy. Teddy isn't. Take him home, Andy. Stay with the Weasleys. They'll keep him safe." Harry told her.
"In that sense, I should just drop down on my knees, take the Malfoy ring and pop the question to Hyde seeing as I spent two weeks with him. Lets not even count the several other nights." Malfoy draws.
Harry looks at him and smiles.
Every phone call with Darien has turned heartbreaking. Draco feels enraged. Why had their marriage turned out like this. He remembered how Darien had took Draco out for a lovely dinner in a garden during their first year. He had booked the park, decorated it with hearts, set up a beautiful dinner with music and danced with him. It was wonderful and Draco was the happiest then. Draco cut the call.
"Are you done?"
"Eat." Harry chuckles and says.
"Cormac refused to give the keys. The bastard says, 'you can't have the keys if you take Millicent'. Van you believe his guts?" Darien sneers.
"I literally, just found out yesterday morning." Harry says.
"Permission granted." Minister said.
It took a while for the head auror to realise that they can't even hear what he is saying and this only enraged him more. But he could hear what they are talking about. And they were talking about cauldrons when Potter had done Merlin knows what to those people. Something Draco simply didn't care about. He cared about Potter being safe. The head auror finally gave up, when he felt Potter's magic crackling in the air. Oh, how Draco loved Potter's wild, powerful magic. Potter was running out of patience with Robards and Robards understood he'd be in deep trouble if he didn't leave. Potter was extremely powerful and he knew he wouldn't be able to fight it alone. And the public won't go against the defeater of the Dark Lord.
"Very well then Mr Potter. Get along with it whatever you want to do." Said Mafilda.
"Doesn't matter. Gran does."
"Sir, I request not to come here anymore. At least look at your age before you dive into such things. Please leave."
"Like?"
Fuck?!!! Fuck fuck fuck! Draco she's my very good friend. Fuck. Draco please make sure she's fed and check on her whenever you can. Please Draco try to do your best to lessen her suffering but be careful. Please take care of yourself and her.
"I'd love to go dancing. I've never been to the zoo." Draco replies.
"Hi, Keith, Arnold. I, uh, I'm not here with Christian." Draco says as he blushes. "I haven't seen him since a few months." Draco bites his lips and looks at Harry.
I swear I could hear Belle let out the breath she was holding in relief.
Five years later.
Anal plug (public, under clothes)Anal beads
"So, you and Draco?" Harry asks.
"Then I'm going to kiss you now." Scorpius says and leans forward slowly, giving Rose a chance to back up. Rose grins as she closes the distance between them and their lips finally touch.
"I love my hair curly and hate straightening it." Draco says. He has no idea why he decided on this one. But he did.
"Why is that?"
"There are kinks, which are things you definitely like and will do. Soft limits that are a list of maybes. Hard limits which are a definite no. There is safeword. That's a word you say when you want to stop whatever is happening. And there is aftercare which means the dominant takes care of the submissive after they are done with a scene. Like Potter always makes sure I've had water and as much as I hate to admit it, I become awful clingy and need the body contact. So Potter holds me until I'm asleep, most of the time I'm asleep after a scene. And Potter says a lot of loving words and kisses and cuddles. He even takes care of the marks like applying disinfectant and stuff.  You're topping or bottoming?" Draco asks.
Once I reached seventh floor, I checked if anyone was there looking at me. Once the place was clear, I thought of a place where we could live and Ginny would be there. A massive door appeared and I went inside. I closed the door behind me and checked the room. It was empty mostly but had a bed, table, chairs, some food, and bathroom. Nice. But where was Ginny?
Nicholas Barnes. A handsom man, just as old as Narcissa. A widower. Taller than her, in his dashing Muggle suits. Muggleborn. A person who has always treated her right, with the respect she deserves. She knows he will do the same with her son. This wonderful person with gorgeous dark green eyes, black messy hair that has turned silver in some places, bronze skin, kind heart. This man who has her heart. She supresses her chuckle when she thinks of Draco with Harry Potter. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Draco is still worried about having to go to the Weasley home. After less than amicable relationship between the Weasleys and the Malfoys, Harry isn't surprised. But he thinks that this is as good as a time to bring out this invitation. Draco is calm right now and this might be a good time to get a Yes out of him.
"I do." Potter smiles.
"I think this is the part where I tell you that I know you use glamour on your body. And if you take that off, I'll still find you beautiful." Harry says.
Harry bit his lip and glanced at Hermione who was looking at him rather shrewdly. Then he smiled. These were the times when his Slytherin side came out.
"Alcohol isn't allowed. You can't be drinking this here." Hermione, ever the headgirl, squeaks.
"I didn't. I didn't tell them to stay or to leave. I just kept sitting there quietly and they took it as permission to sit." Draco replied.
Welcome prongsie
Pansy snaped her fingers in front of his eyes.
Harry took his slim, petite hands in both of his larger ones and rubbed his thumbs over his hand.
"Where are all? Darien asked.
"James, please keep your reckless Gryffindorness within you and try not to get hurt. And I know it's no use to tell you to keep the pranks down. But please be safe okay? And try to wait at least a month before we get a howler from McGonagall shouting us about some prank you pulled. She's scary." Draco chuckled and kissed James forehead.
Astoria stops pouring her coffee in the middle and turns to look at Harry as he has done a huge crime.
"Yes, Master. I'll tell you if I need you to stop." Draco replied, breathing hard.
Once Draco nods, Harry kisses his forehead and leaves the room then wards the doors. He walks in the kitchen and ignores Ginny and Astoria and walks towards the cabinet in which he stores sweet treats for Draco. He picks up a brown paper bag and fills it with gummy bears, marshmallows, jelly beans and chocolate balls.
Harry silently gave her the letter. Andromeda eyed the letter for several moments before she picked up. Harry held his breath as he watched Andromeda's eyes widened. The letter fell from her hand, so did the tears from her eyes. Her whole body trembled as she shivered. With a wave of his hand, Harry switched off the stove on which the kettle was kept then walked towards Andromeda to hold her. He held her tight and rubbed her back as she sobbed on Harry's arms. After a great while, she finally calmed.
Potter drops Draco's hand and accio's a jar of mint green salve. He pulls back Draco's bedsheet that covers his chest and Draco lets him, holding his breath. He dips his fingers in the salve and applies it on the round scar on Draco's chest, carefully avoiding the other scars. The skin absorbed the salve and within seconds, the scar was gone, leaving plain pale flesh as if Draco was never hit by those four people. He looked at Potter, sho was looking at him intensely with those bright green eyes.
Draco places his crup bookmark in between of the pages and closes the tome. He stands up and walks to Potter who with a smile hands Teddy over to him. Without another word, Draco walks inside the manor with Teddy. Once in his room, he smiles at Teddy.
"Open up. Hands behind your back." Harry orders.
"Now I realise that it's not respect my father got. It was fear."
"Draco, the only people who have ever been kind to you are your Slytherin friends and your mother. Your father raised you to think it's weakness and has on so many occasions, tried to snuff it out of you. Even with your friends, you all have been distant until the war started. That's when you all blatantly started saying what you want. From what I've heard, actions were always there which is why none of you ever doubted each other. This display of everything so open, it makes you feel forbidden. That you can't have it. Because you've been taught, quite unhealthy might I add, that it is forbidden. You feel guilty because you feel like you can't have it and you want it. Just like you wanted your father's love but it was forbidden. The fact that you and Harry were in the opposite sides of the war just enhances it. You would've felt like this even if the war didn't happen."
"Who are you again?" Harry asks him.
"You have me now, my dragon. All will be fine." Her mother tells him and strokes through his hair.
"Harry, please." Draco begs.
"Don't let Andromeda know anything about it for now. Just tell her that you are visiting. And contact that guy who got the letter. He's our way to contact Narcissa." Ron demands.
It was raining heavily that day, just like so many other days, it was always wet in London. Draco walked along with his little girl who he had named after her mother, Narcissa. The umbrella charmed to keep the water off both him and Cissa. He dropped Cissa at the primary school for wizarding children under eight years old. Smiling at his daughter as she waved him goodbye before entering the school ground which saved her from the rain, he turned back once she disappeared from the sight.
"Well, with that dog collar, it's difficult to believe that you're his boyfriend. It's more like you're his slave." The smirk on prosecutor's face extremely large.
Cormac walks towards his cabin when Millicent stops him.
"Potter. Why are you doing this? Why won't you let it go?" Draco hisses.

"Its okay my dragon. But you have to understand, killing yourself won't change anything." I say.
"It's because you don't want me to disagree with you. And you're deflecting."
"So they investigated you about the pedophile killer?" Prosecutor asks.
Sorry for the late update. I ended up reading extremely long drarry fics and i just couldn't leave it unfinished.
"Yep. That's about it."
Harry closes his eyes and holds to Draco tight. It pains Harry physically in his chest to see Draco this way. So hurt. So scared. So terrified and in pain. Harry doesn't know what he can do to make Draco stop feeling this way.
"I would like that." She says. I get up and fix the couch for her. "The kids are safe. Its done." She says then explains about the order and passage and Aberforth. After everything I give her an apple I was intending to eat. She eats it and falls asleep. I take my diary out and tell people three kids are safely smuggled out of the castle and have a safe place to go to. I sit down laying my head on the couch and fall asleep as well after adding some protective charms on the door.
"Thank you." She says with tearful eyes.
Its endearing how even now he blushes while asking for permission to cross his legs and sit. Sometimes Harry says no just for amusement sake but today, today he says yes.
"Yes. Like feelings. Things. I don't know what. Why can't I know emotions like a normal human being?" Draco sighs.
Potter grabs Draco's hips and instead of smiling in victory, he feels a pang in his chest. He keeps his face staring straight ahead though so Potter can't see his face. The music suddenly stops. Looks like Potter's magic does as he wishes.
"We're fine. It's not about us. It's about Narcissa." Harry said and bit his lip.
"Please tell me he didn't." Zabini says.
Draco laughs. He did predict this. These aurors are so dumb and predictable. Anyone can be a step over them.
"You are?" Draco's eyes widen.
Hary sees Ron and Hermione glace at each other. They are getting better at having silent conversations with each other. It's getting fucking irritating.
"Oh this is good." Theo said.
"You know that I won't say no." Draco gives a coy smile.
"Are you going to ruin any more of my things?" Potter asks.
Harry understood that this was the most the most he was going to get about it now.
"Hi beautiful." A voice said.
"Tomorrow. If you want." Andromeda replies.
Harry pulled both the hands away and was pleased to see that Draco didn't change the position. Not even to get a little comfortable. He admired Draco from behind.
"How do you know this?"
"Darien, I can't go with you." Millicent informs.
"They're big enough for a home now. I was going to ask in my class tomorrow if anyone would want them but you both can have them if you want. They seem to like you."
"Not at all." I smiled.
"It took me three days to wake up?" I cry out loud.
"You've been returning my owls unopened." Charlie says softly.
Great! Not even a day and he has already disappointed Potter.
"I mean, you're so comfortable with your body and confident about it. So you faunt it happily. This, is not you. You shouldn't wear clothes that don't make you happy." Neville smiled.
Pansy paces around in her flat, it's been two weeks since Millicent has come home. In the end, she calls Darien.
Harry roughly pushes Draco more into the wall and pulls his wrists almost up to his upper back. He feels the satisfaction as Draco's eyes widen and he groans in more discomfort.
"Yes." Harry growls.
Draco can feel the colour in his cheeks. He blushes and looks at the crup in his arms.
Heaven- julia micheals
Harry closes his eyes. That unsurprisingly does nothing to stop the sounds. Fucking hell. Deep breath in. Deep breath out. It will not do Harry any good if McLaggen is hurt. Harry clenches his fist.
Harry nodded and forced Draco to Slughorn's office.
"Don't. Just don't talk to me." I say and get up. I don't want to see him now.
The next two days went very eventful. Draco and others spoke to the lawyers and gave their statements. Draco spent two days taking care of Teddy. Aunt Romie told Draco so many stories about her mom and their childhood, about Remus and Dora. Harry came by to play with Teddy once for an hour. Tomorrow Draco has his hearing. Hopefully he'll be able to plead not guilty.
"I. I don't know Belle. I feel like if I take a bite I'll just throw it all up. I don't feel like it at all." I sigh.
"I knew Blaise and Belle belonged together even before they did. I mean they liked each other but both were so determined on not to act about it. They both were aware of their feelings and their sexual tension was just so irritating. Their constant sarcastic and witty bickering, feeling of jealousy when anyone else flirted with the other, I could take it no more. I knew I had to get it stared. Which is why, while playing spin the bottle, I dared Blaise to kiss Belle. Which is also why I dared Potter for seven minutes in heaven. I knew he would select Draco. So you four have me to thank to suckers. I'm glad you both found each other, Beautiful Fire." With that, the toasts were over. Everyone danced and had their dinner. Their wedding was just as beautiful.
"We have reasons to believe that you, Mr Potter, are behind all the ministry and death-eater killings." Robards replied.
Pansy holds herself until she's in her room. She knows that Millicent will be out with her boyfriend for the evening. Still, she casts some silencing charms and as soon as it's done, she lets out a wretched sob. It's been so long since she's cried. Today, she finally allows herself one evening of vulnerability and misery as she cries. Zacharias didn't look at Pansy before because he was respectable. He didn't look at Pansy because he was gay. Not bisexual or anything else. Pure gay.
Harry doesn't say anything. What can he say? Not everyone knows that Harry likes Draco. Just Ginny, Luna and Neville. Ever since Hermione and Ron have gone Australia, Harry has been alone and it's only them who have been with Harry. Harry watches as Astoria's eyes widen as if she just heard Harry's thoughts.
"Spine is the middle man. The one who arranges appointments and meetings. He will have no information about this whatsoever. Keeping separate solicitors is actually very smart. There's one for business, one for ministry related issues, one for family affairs, one for personal affairs, one for the Frech affairs. If anyone will have any information its, Travis Verne and Lucy Foote. They handle family affairs and personal affairs." Draco replies.
"Oh my. Was there tongue?"
Harry feels Draco tugging his sleeve like a child. He looks at Draco and smiles.
Draco opens the envelope which says that Draco has the right to his personal vault. The right, not even his father can revoke.
Pansy.
"Potter."
He watches as Andromeda's eyes soften. "Alright." She gives a small smile.
Harry's too disturbed to say anything. He doesn't know what to say. He just holds on the sleeping boy in his arms and pets him. He can still feel the silent tears rolling down his own face. His Draco went through such a horrific fate. All because he chose to save Harry. And he never once told Harry about it. Not once even indicated something like this. Harry curses the world, the war, horrible parents and horrible people. He was a child, dammit. His Draco was a child. A fucking child. And not only was he forced to be used as a pawn, clearly meant to die, he was also made to go through all of this. And so Harry just cries.
"We'll get some new clothes for you as well. I mean, you really like all the clothes we bought for you. They all fit you perfectly. You even found your love for a good suit. You bought three. I think you should get more. You look extremely handsome in suits." Draco kept rambling and Harry smiled.
"You're stressing for nothing." Draco says. "Hear me out. Tori, she's strong and fierce but shes a homely person. She'll gladly be your housewife and your homemaker while you earn the bread. You can take her anywhere you want if you're going to travel a lot."
"Draco, can I ask you a personal question? You can always not answer if you don't want to." Harry asked.
"Yes." He says.
"Filthy pet. Drooling all over yourself like a stupid animal." Potter chuckles and oh, Draco's cock gives another jolt. "That's all you are, aren't you? A stupid animal. Say it. Say you are a stupid animal."
I hate everybody- halsey
"Oh no I know you won't. You'll beg a lot though. I love hearing you beg." Harry smirked and Draco blushed more.
Draco turns around and runs towards the castle. Once inside his dorm, he sees Potter and Weaslette sitting on Longbottom's bed with him. Draco narrows his eyes.
I would make an amazing stripper but that's not what I'm talking about. Meet me at astronomy tower after class.
Draco looks at him confused and then sighs.
"Is his name Cormac?" Cormac smiles ignoring the pit in his stomach.
And the magic makes Draco say it. But to his humiliation, it comes out all blotched up because his tongue is still sticking out and it's difficult to talk while your tongue is out. He flushes more as Potter laughs while Draco tries to say it again.
And so Draco ignores everybody to converse with this Veela lady in French who's name is Fleur. And the reason she seemed so familiar is because she was one of the champions for the triwizard competition at Hogwarts. Draco loves speaking French. It's one of the rare things he is brilliant at. He speaks French as it's his native language, which by the way, it is. Fleur includes Andromeda, amusement twinkling in their eyes. They laugh about how awkward all are here as they watch them converse in French, not knowing what the they are talking about
Third person pov
"It is." Draco gives her a smile. "But at least you won't have to go at it the wrong way."
"Took care of them." Potter replied.
"That's true. You do know Andromeda will never get a chance to mend things with your mother? She must be drowning in guilt herself." Marina explained.
"I don't know if I'm surprised that Ginny wants to wear something feminine or that you both are going together." Harry finally states.
Potter rolls his eyes and Draco feels the spicy, minty wandless and wordless cleaning charm taking place in his mouth. Draco rolls his eyes now and pulls his hand away from Potter's mouth. He leans up close and kisses him. The kiss, like last night is beautiful, tender and firm and obviously it's Potter who dominates him and obviously Draco lets him. Potter gives a content sigh in the kiss. Draco doesn't remember feeling this good in so long. He's slept well with no nightmares after so long. He's not feeling that restlessness when he kisses other men. He instead feels warm and calm and like he is just where he belongs. And he's just a little bit scared that things are going to fuck up because it always does whenever something slightly good happens to Draco. But the kiss also leaves him a bit aroused. It has been more than two weeks since he's had any action, thanks to Potter hexing people. Smith has been the only one who dared do anything to him. It's like he has suicide tendency.
"As I said. Pathetic. A slave. Just like you." He spits at her.
We break to chatter again. Its finally midnight and they all decide now will be a good time to wish Draco goodnight. We all quickly enter his room. He's fast asleep. Belle goes and kisses his forehead. Then we all go to our rooms. Nott has another bed in his room. He gives me a pair of his robes and I have a quick shower. When I come out of shower, Nott has passed out on his bed. I go to sleep as well.
As Potter was about to speak something to his friends, three cat patronus came and sat in front of him. It was McGonagall, calling Potter and Draco. Draco's face fell. He had barely escaped azkaban and getting a chance to finish his newts was a big thing. He didnt want to get expelled. Potter took his hand and gave him a reassuring smile. They said their goodbyes to their friends and left to the headmistress's office.
Why did he just burst out like this? Couple months of silence and this is what happens? Draco's never going in silent mode again. No matter how exhausting.
"Save it Zabini." She gives him a glare threatening him to shut up. "I wonder what they're cooking. I'm in mood for cake." She said changing the topic. I feel grateful.
"Oh. Well then, first you take my number. Come on. Write it down." Cormac tells.
"Don't. Although I'm sure you remember that night, 16th July, your best friend's birthday. That was the night you slept with her husband, wasn't it? Some, six years ago."
Snape stood up to give his speech. He spoke about muggle studies getting cancelled. Flashbacks started to come in front of my eyes. Professor Charity Burbage levitating in the air, bruised and broken, tortured. I wanted to do something to save her. I wanted to protect her and get her out of there but any act like that from my side would've had severe consequences. So I kept my head down and heard her screams that deafened my ears. A small sob leaving my eye at her screams. The only comfort I had was my mother silently squeezing my hand.
*Body torture*
D is right. We made our beds.
Meet me in my study at midnight.
Pansy sighed at another rainy day while looking outside her window. She walked in the kitchen and made that expensive coffee she liked for her and her roommate Millicent. She took the coffee to Millie's room to wake her up.
"I had to use up all of my will power to not kill that bitch. For a groomer she was pretty terrible. So fucking rude." Pansy said.
Draco shouldn't be surprised that Christian understood. But he was surprised that he guessed who it was. Draco looks down and gives a small nod.
"I don't deserve your love." Draco looks at him, his eyes starting to burn with tears.
"I love you too, Draco." Harry replies and hugs him tighter.
"Pansy!" He smiles.
Eye contact restrictions
"Cinema it is then." Harry smiled.
Cormac walked towards Millicent in the pouring rain, this time with his umbrella.
"He's not. He has vanished in thin air."
Draco walks through the coridors that leads to the kitchen. Potter is sitting there at the kitchen table sipping tea. On the table is a beautiful pink and mint green box of pastries from Draco's favourite bakery in Paris. The one he hasn't been in since quite a while. Doux Cours. This is all the proof he needs that Potter was in France. He takes a deep breath, which does nothing to calm his nerves. He throws the paper on the table in front of Potter.
"Ma'am, Boss has given this phone for you." The clerk tells Millicent and gives her the same phone Cormac had just given Darien.
"Why was he talking about Christian?" Harry narrowed his eyes.
Sorry for the delays. I work in a rotational shift so my schedule isn't fixed to dk anything i want in my life.
"Cum for me Draco." Harry commands and to Draco's humiliation, he does. Even Draco's cock obeyes Harry. Harry stops the handjob and pet's Draco's hair from other hand and removes the knickers from Draco's mouth.
Once I was done with lunch I walked out of the great hall. To my horror, Amycus was walking towards me. Luckily he didn't see me. I turned back and ran. I heard Amycus calling me and laugh. He saw me. Shit. I ran and ran till I found a closed room. I opened the door, went inside and closed the door behind me. I took a breath in relief until i heard a voice from behind.
"Nope. She can choose your wedding robes. Not mine. I'm not going to start our marriage by giving up to Augusta Longbottom."
He pulls my hair more tighter and my head is completely pulled behind. He kisses my neck even more. Im glad there's no kissing on the lips. We both are same that way, we prefer not to kiss when it's meaningless fling.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna sat in one compartment, chattering while Harry stayed quiet.
"Yeah but you can't starve now, can you?"
"What did you do?" McGonagall asks.
Harry gave Draco a small peck on his lips.
"The cupboard." Draco replies.
"I know you ziz, 'Arry. But what's the point in putting yourself en eem in so much pain when you've left Ron and Hemione? I mean, zhey still do try-"
"Friends and family," The officiator, Mr Weasley said. "We are all here for the magical bond of Mr Harry Potter and Mr Draco Malfoy. There was a time Harry hated his guts. He was also obsessed with Draco. Only now we know why this obsession was there in the first place." Everyone laughed. "Today we are here for this joyful occasion. Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter will now say their vows."
"I've already spoken to Potter about it. I've sent an owl to my solicitors and have spoken to decide a date to meet with them. Thanks Granger. Appreciate it."
"Everyone knows me and Ginny are the favourites." Theo laughed.
"I think it's really sweet Theo. I can teach you some more after lessons. If you want." Ginny suggested.
"No. You healed the first day. Madam Pomfrey kept feeding you sleeping draught so you'll be alseep and safe." I nodded. "Belle. Why didn't you defend yourself. You are really good in dada."
"And?" Harry probed.
"I can't tell you. She's not really trustworthy. A little persuasion and she'll spill all secrets. I had to obliviate her so that she doesn't remember this conversation and specially doesn't remember she told this to me. Can't risk that." I lied again.
"As always. I'll make sure he doesn't." Hermione assures Draco.
"Can we help you?" Hermione asked politely.
Harry chuckled.
"How does this submissive dominant thing work?" She asks quietly but doesn't break eye contact.
"Why would you do something like that? I thought you loved him!" She says accusing.
"I'm surprised that he doesn't know about them." I said as we reached the burrow.
"Ginny? What are you doing out so late?" He asked.
"Does it bother you much? The obsession and the stalking?" Harry asks softly.
Draco is staring at him like he's trying to believe that he really ia here with Harry. Like they really are here together. Anger flares up in Harry. It had took Harry almost a year to calm Draco down. Beneath that amused smirk, Draco was still a terrified child. And with Harry, he always felt safe. Now he held Harry ever so tightly and looked at Harry unblinking, making himself believe that hs is safe and with Harry.
[In the French Malfoy Villa]
Draco smiles.
"There is no need to die, Nick." Narcissa smiled. "I'd rather you stay alive. After everything I've been through, I deserve the happiness to choose who I want to be with." Then she looked at Harry. "My son, he is the reason I can finally do it. You have to know, Mr Potter, I tried. I tried so hard to protect him and failed. I failed my son. I am so glad that my son has someone like you. Someone who did all that you did. He deserves the best in life. So do you."
"Why not? He's dating a Death-eater. You scums can easily get him to your side." Robards replies and then motions the tall auror to do something.
"Why will you say so if you don't want it?" Harry asks.
Draco's POV
"Tr- truth" I sob. When she realizes I'm crying my eyes out, she looks at me sympathetically and let's me in without answering the question. "Thank you." I say in a cracked voice.
Cormac leads Draco into greenhouse 8. Apparantly greenhouse 8 has a backdoor that leads to a pretty garden that Draco never knew exists. The garden was full of beautiful muggle and magical flowers. All colourful. Tulips, orchids, roses, marigolds and so much more. But what made Draco smile were two crup puppies running towards them with tiny legs and paws and their tails wagging.
"No he won't!" Draco snaps his head to see Potter. "Draco is not going anywhere with you."
We all read the entire diaries. Everything was here to prove Malfoy innocent.  I looked at Ron and Hermione. They smiled at me and nodded. Ginny did the same.
"Anger management." Draco murmured.
Harry leans on the kitchen entrance and looks at Draco. Draco is making coffee, dancing along and making toast while wearing headphones Harry doesn't know when he got it. Most likely just right now if the openned box on the table is any indication. He twirls around and turns and freezes as he sees Harry, which makes Harry chuckle. There's the pink tinge on his cheeks that Harry absolutely loves. Draco smiles, takes out the headphones and the kitchen fills with music. Harry walks towards draco and pulls him close by grabbing his hips.
Harry is done with new information. He looks at the information board and he'll be damned. Draco was right.
Draco comes in slowly, sucking another blood lollie. He looks at Hermione and Ron warily. He's still avoiding everyone who isn't Harry or Astoria. He slowly walks towards Harry. Hermione casually folds the letter and puts it in her pocket in a way no one would think anything suspicious is happening. Draco walks towards Harry and stands in front of him. Harry, who was leaning his arse of the large desk in his study, pulls Draco close and holds him.
She looks at the ring on her finger. A beautiful white gold ring with a small narcissus made of green diamonds. It shines bright and simple, elegant and lavish all together.
I walked towards the great hall and saw all the 'fellow' death-eaters sitting on the staff table. My heart dropped a beat. Bellatrix came to me take took my hand.
"Tell us one secret, small or big, that no one here knows." Blackburn says.
"Why don't you ever let me work out without distractions?" Harry chuckles.
"He never complained. Never told how he felt about it." Harry said.
"Walking classes?" Harry asked.
"I now pronounce you, husband and husband. You may now ki-"
"That was your secret, pet. Whether to tell me or not was your decision and your right. I understand why you didn't tell me. It's not your fault. I don't blame you for any of it." Harry tries to assure him.
"Minnie has been like a second mother to me since the second year of school. I loved my parents but they were a bit conservative so I couldn't really talked to them. Minnie was there for everything when I needed a woman in my life. My first period, my sexuality, etc. So that's why she treated me that way." Belle explained.
He thinks about their first morning and the cigarettes they smoked together. Its only been about two months but it feels like years. So much has passed since then. Malfoy looks just as beautiful as he did that day. He always looks beautiful. Harry doesn't think that there will be a day Malfoy won't look breathtakingly gorgeous.
"Hermione, we have rules regarding our relationship. Draco doesn't have rules on how to live his life. I won't demand him to quit smoking just because I'm his dom. It doesn't work that way." Harry explained.
"Its time." Harry came and announced.
"Kissing her. I love her." Draco said.
"Pansy, listen to me-"
"Future wife." Neville says as he scans the bra the representative gave him.
That accusation was out right laughable. Draco couldn't kill to save his own life. But the attempted murders do play a different light on him.
"You hate that music." Draco sighs and falls down on the bed side ways.
"Toys! Daddy toys!" He says excitedly.
"Mind telling me why are you ruining a perfectly good dorm?" Harry asked, his expressions and voice neutral.
"You're back." Draco whispers in a smile, puts his guitar at side and crawls over to the other side of bed where Potter has walked.
This is it people. Its over. Only epilogue is left which i will post later. I cannot begin to tell you how much your love and support and comments and kudos have mattered to me. Its the reason I was able to finish it. I'll be writing another drarry fic which might not be as dark and will have lots of fluff. I love you guys. Please promote this fic.
"I'm not much surprised. None of us Slytherins would be. As I said. I've seen first hand how he's never been there for us Slytherins. I'm not the only one."
Gasoline- Halsey
Harry feels and hears Draco take in a sharp breath.
"Let's get something on your stomach, okay. You missed dinner. You'll feel better with a full stomach." Harry smiles.
"People surprise us in many ways." Marina smiles. "Like your aunt did by coming to meet you again and again."
"No, Hera. I won't leave you." Ralph sobs as he kisses her hands.
"Draco that would be wonderful. I would love that. And dont worry about your trials dear. I'm sure everything will be fine." She smiled.
"So. What's the plan?" Belle smirks.
Draco stands and Harry watches as he slowly removes every clothing, folding it nicely and placing it on the bed besides Harry, because he's all posh and neat like that and then kneel again. Harry summons the salve. He uncorks the lid, scoops a bit on his fingers then gets of the bed and crouches in front of Draco. He could've had Draco sit on the bed but he wanted draco kneeling as long as he could. He knew it was selfish and wrong to some extent but Draco had gone on his knees twice now. Deliberately. He taps Draco's thigh and Draco spreads it apart. There is a small scar, a thin line on his inner left thigh, in between of all the other scars. Its the smallest of the scar but clearly shows that it's one of the oldest. Its the scar Cartier left there purposely as a mark of his conquering children for his sick hobby. Harry gently applies the salve on that scar, making sure not to get it on the others. He watches as the scar disappears then looks at Draco, who has his eyes shut tight. His blond lashes wet, he's breathing fast and on the verge of sobbing. This, Harry doesn't want to miss. He places two fingers under Draco's chin and tilts his head up after he gets up to sit on the bed. He's looking at Draco while Draco slowly opens his eyes. He's looking as a tear rolls down his cheek. He's looking as Draco gives a small smile as a sob wretches out of him.
Professor Storm went red. His nostrils flared and a vein could be seen on his temple. Within seconds he pulled out his wand and cast a legilimence on Draco. And Draco was ready. He could feel an extremely weak pounding in the walls he had created. There's no way the professor could come inside. Draco built his walls so strong and pushed professor out of his mind so forcefully that the professor fell back down on the ground.
"Wow, you're so disconnected to the world. More so than me. Next you'll tell me you didn't know Lovegood and Longbottom are dating." Malfoy teases.
Harry replied.
Ginny couldn't stop herself and started sobbing. Theo was worried. He held her asking what's wrong.
"Yes." I said.
Third person pov
"Harry?" Draco calls softly.
Cormac walks in his living room. The juke box is playing a soft beautiful tune. He places his fruit bowl down on the table and looks out in the balcony. He watches Millicent facing the sky with slight smile on her face as the rain drenches her wet. Cormac opens the balcony and walks towards Millie, the sound of music following him there. He takes Millicent's hand in his and wraps one hand around her hips. With small steps, he sways her ahead and back until they form a rhythm and dance in the rain.
Harry told Draco about how he was abused as well. He told Draco how he was starved and beaten and jailed in that cupboard under the stairs. Slowly the conversation became lighter and they talked about the things they loved. The date ended perfect with good sex in Draco's room.
"Narcissa?" Nicholas looks at her and smiles.
"Hey, love, there's something I want to talk to you about. Ask about more likely." Nick says.
"Really? Using legilimence without consent and when the person isn't ready? Exact sort of thing the death-eaters used to do." Draco sneered and left the class.
"Come on. I'll show you something that might cheer you up." McLaggen says.
"Write her back that she can." Harry replies in affirmative.
"How much longer?" Draco asks again.
"Keep them?" Cormac asks.
"I'd rather you don't." Potter replied.
"Where are you going?"
"Why would you insuate that?"
"Harry! Is everything okay?" Slughorn asked from the little opening on his door.
River- bishop briggs
"Just one year Hugo." Rose said.
"No." She says.
"Many reasons, pet. We need a break from everything Britain. I miss Teddy. Hermione wanted to go as well. It will be good for us." Harry smiled. No need to tell him the main reasons. These reasons are true as well.
"That's sweet, Potter. I'll ask her but I don't know if she'll agree. She has a very strong personality. She will stand her ground until she is sure it would make no difference but she might need an escape for a day or two." Draco replied.
"At least reduce it a bit. It's too much." Draco begs.
He fell of the stairs because instead of watching the stairs he was looking at Red. It was hilarious Moony! You should've seen.
"How did he manage to screw this up? I literally handed him this in a platter!"
a treacherous part of his brain reminded. Harry looked at Draco. His face free of the worry of abandonment. Harry will have to have a chat with the editor of Prophet.
"You won't." Potter replies and kisses his temple.
Harry, still cupping his cheeks, pulls his face close to his Draco's forehead, then his tearfull eyes, red nose and swollen lips.
Fifth year. Prongs deer how can you be so oblivious?
"You're not going anywhere with him." Potter says with such force.
"Can I buy you a drink?" Harry asks.
"You. Pain. You. Please." Draco panted.
"That child can't cast a dark curse to save his own life. They forced him to do it. He couldn't. Couldn't say the words. Which was given because his wand has unicorn core. I sold him his first wand. Unicorns are the most purest of the creatures. They are the most lightest of them. And not many people get the wands with unicorn cores. In a my life, I've sold about 40 wands with unicorn core. One of them to Draco Malfoy. That boy is more light than anyone of us here is."
Third person pov
"It's alright, Draco. It's okay. I'm here. I'm right here." Potter calms him down.
"How couldn't I?" Draco smiled.
"You always work."
"Draco!"
Andromeda squeals as she runs to Narcissa to hug her and the next few minutes are filled with laughter and exciting squeals and giddiness. After the few minutes of childishness, they school their features.
reads the headline.
"Draco, I'm technically an older version of that guy. Look at me. We have similar built, similar height, black messy hair, and the entire tine we danced the last time, he looked at me like he would kill me without a second thought for touching you. It's him you wanted all along, isn't it? He's your classmate, you know him since years." Christian said.
"Come here this instant." He commands.
"A beautiful name." McLaggen glares back and turns to Draco. "Don't listen to him, Draco. It's a beautiful name. I loved it."
"Easy to say. I want to have candy floss." Draco bites his lip.
"Oh they're adorable! I love them." Draco smiles as Cormac picks up the brown crup puppy.
"Don't make promises you can't keep. One day, you'll realise that I'm not worth it. And just like all of them, you will discard me when you're done with me. You will leave me alone." Draco cries hard.
"See, if she finds out, boss's marriage will be in trouble. Please. You've finished everything with him, haven't you? Then why put him through it? He was so worried he was crying. He was completely broken down, believe me! See, it's only for a few days, please understand!"
"Do you, Belle Darling, promise to help us do our mission to save as many lives as possible?"
He turns back to look at Potter who is looking at him with expressions Draco can't recognise. It's peculiar that it makes Draco feel something. It's always done. It's Potter. He always makes Draco feel things that Draco himself can't understand. But maybe he understands Potter in a way no one can. Two pawns of opposite sides used in a war game by adults. Two children with terrible burden of their own which is similar in some way if not all. His mind drifts to what Marina said. Maybe he likes Potter. The idea of this having any resemblance of truth is absurd. They're white and black. Two different sides of chess. Two different side of coins. Three years ago, Draco might have given this more thought. Right now, he can't. He simply can't muster the energy to think about anything. Thinking is a chore he thoroughly hates. Getting up is a chore now, thinking is just more excruciating. He sometimes wishes he could go back to three years prior. A place where his life was all made out and planned by his father and all he had to do was obey. It does takes edge out of things. He was raised to obey. It was ingrained in him. Just like right now, he wishes someone to come over. To take control away from him. To give over and just not think. It has always been easy for him to do this. He just can't do it by himself right now.
It was Rose's first year at Hogwarts as well.
He looks at McLaggen, who is looking at Draco with wide eyes and bemused smile. Draco sighs.
The fuck are you doing now Sirius?
"I have a family! Potter I have to meet them. Can you please help me meet them?" I ask.
What the fuck padfoot?! Also I think yes.
Harry laughs out loud finally. Ron's face was priceless.
"Darien, it's Pansy. Millie hasn't been answering my calls. I know she said she was out for some office work but I can't get a hold of her. Do you know anything about it?"
"Oh, that's what you'll say now, won't you? After using me for two years?" Millicent snaps.
Hilarious.
I give him a peck on his lip and leave to find Belle. I knock her door and she opens it.
"And you pray to Circe, Merlin, Morgana and all the founding parents of Hogwarts that I remain a slave because I swear to all of them Lucius, if I ever find a way to escape this prison, I'll make you suffer for everything you've put my son through." She warns her captor.
"No." He mumbles quietly and Harry nods.
"You say that like I don't know." Malfoy laughs and then starts singing.
"Well, I don't need that now. I'm rich, Potter. Do keep up." Draco grins and happily munches on his vegetables.
"There are rumours but I am not aware of how truthful they are. I, however am aware that I am not one. And male Veelas are rare. Veelas are mostly female, aren't they?"
"Will you make lamb roast?" Draco asks with huge expectant eyes.
Luna, Neville and Ginny.
Pet play
"Did you want to keep it a secret?" Marina asked.
"Draco, we have to make a list of things. Things we like and things we don't like. So that we know what we can do and what we should avoid. I don't want you to do things that you don't want to do, alright?" Harry explains and Draco nods.
"Come then. You have to help me shop for my future wife."
"Draco!" Parkinson sceeeches and runs to him. All those Slytherins do. She holds Malfoy with her dear life. They all do, stand there for a moment, holding each other. Once they get off him, and Harry, all he sees are eyes that are dead. Malfoy is so pale. Paler than he ever was, as if there is no blood in his body. He and Andromeda walk towards Malfoy.
"She's a Slytherin now. She's one of us." Blaise replies.
Draco takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and slowly opens them. He looks at his aunt. Really looks. He sees a concern face, almost scared. He sees kind eyes crinkled with worry. He sees black hair not as wild and curly but wavy and almost straight. He sees Andromeda. Not Bellatrix.
"Why didn't you give a definite answer? You could have asked them to leave. You still don't do. It's been mid August. Almost a month now that they are visiting."
“Yeah. It could be.” I cut him off.
What. Is. He. On. About?
"There are other ways of killing me you know? No one lasts more than a year. How am I supposed to?" Belle asked.
"Who is this friend?" Ginny asks. Oh Merlin!
They had the decency to look ashamed. Harry didn't blame them but they simply didn't understand. Harry remembers all those times his uncle used him as a punching bag. Using Harry to remove his frustrations of the day with his belt repeatedly hitting Harry. Harry hated belts. Belt was not something he wanted to spank Draco with but he wasn't about to let a belt get him down. He would only use the belt to get his pet pleasure. Never in punishment would he use the belt. He remembers so many nights, he was locked, bruised and scared through the beatings in the cupboard. He turned around and left the dorm, back to his pet who waited for him in their dorm.
"To a park maybe."
"Nah its cool. They're just clothes. Why?" Belle asked. Draco didn't say anything. "Omg you like being girly? Draco that's so cute. I think you will rock a crop top." Belle said hugging Draco.
Harry clears his throat. Teddy is now with Pansy. I take Teddy from Pansy.
James, how are Pads and Lily?
Getting back on the platform for Hogwarts express is nothing like it used to be before. Once, where getting on the platform used to fill Harry with happiness and excitement, it now fills him with dread and anxiety. The press and the hoarding of fans do not make anything better. Harry, Ron and Hermione push their way through the crowd, casting charms to keep people at least a feet away from them, somehow manage to climb on the train with their trunks and luggage. Being in the train is not much better. Fans keep trying to talk to them, touch them, kiss them and not leave them alone. They fight their way through the crowds and go to their empty compartment, settle their things and finally breathe.
"You know, the Blacks have an amazing library?" Potter asks instead.
"At least he's a slave to an actual man." Narcissa replies calmly.
"You will be okay in those situations as long as you don't purposely tell anyone our secret." Pansy says and the vow is done. We take our hands back.
Christian's kisses have always felt so right and so wrong simultaneously. Draco loves it and hates it. His kisses makes Draco feel safe. Makes Draco feel all the good things that are illusions. And Draco kisses back. He always does. And he will go with Christian whenever Christian tells him to. He can never say no. He can never say no to anybody but he never wants to say no to Christian. It breaks Draco's heart that he can't love Christian the way he deserves to. But how can he? Christian doesn't know about the war. He can't know about the war. About what Draco did. About so many other things. He just can't. Christian breaks the kiss and Draco takes a deep breath and looks at Christian.
"You'll be in one now. Come on. I have the tickets." Harry takes his hand and leads him inside.
"It is." He smiles and turns to Mrs Weasley. "Thank you, Mrs Weasley. This is beautiful."
A wide smile appears to my lips. She wants to meet me. Oh my god she wants to meet me. Will she like me? What if she hates me? What if Teddy hates me? I take another parchment and write for her.
"Read it! It's a good book." Potter replied. Draco could only watch as Potter became a distant figure as the bus kept going ahead.
"Her parents found out she's gay." Draco said after swallowing his first bite.
"Anybody would be. I still can't believe he's gay." Daphne says.
"Good morning. I hope you don't mind I cooked breakfast." Astoria says.
"I don't think I've been on any swing since I was five." Draco says.
"Our names didn't seem to be an issue while you had your cock burried in my arse. You know what? Had you not ended things, you could've been that one saving grace for me. You Gryffindors keep screwing me over and then say I'm the arsehole Malfoy Slytherin. You are nothing but just another one of the adults who let me down. I'm tired Charles. I'm exhausted. I am tired all the time. I do not have energy or strength to deal with this emotionally or mentally. Just leave me alone please."
"Did you name them?" Lavender asks.
"Oh, please, call me Narcissa." She smiled then offered her hand to Hermione.
Yes Moony
"Class is in 30 minutes." Potter smirks.
"Yes Master." He whispers but to Harry it sounded beautiful and he heard it like Draco had screamt it on the top of his lungs.
'Tell them you have a girlfriend.
"I'm staying." Belle says.
The laughs emerge through the drinks and the dragon Weasley actually chokes on his scotch.
"Mafilda Hopkins."
My annoying alarm started beeping. I groaned and woke up. I took my clothes I had set last night for today and went to the washroom. I lazily started to brush my teeth. I came to my dorm so late last night after the secret meeting, my sleep wasn't done. Padma Patil came to me and asked me of she could use my owl tonight. She needed to send a secret letter to her parents. I knew it would be dangerous to keep my owl in the owlery so I had smuggled my owl in my dorm room the first night I reached here. Sending my owl out made it easy as my owl Maleficent was white and brown in colour and was trained to fly discreetly. That's when it hit me. Owls!
"Why do we have to go?" Draco asks again.
"Father. It's been a while." Draco smirks.
"What are you going to do now?" Harry asks.
"I'm getting married. And I don't know if she'll be okay with us being as good friends as we are." Neville replies.
Draco was sitting in the room with his back leaned on the bedpost, strumming his guitar. Draco looks at Potter and smiles at him. How is it possible to miss someone when they're gone for a while but you stay with them most of the time? Draco will never know.
"I do." Belle smiled.
Draco stepped to the sun room, the room which he dreaded equally. He flinched as he felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up. Suddenly he was filled with the mental ghosts of small children that were brough here to be slaughtered. Just like Draco had been once. Curses that made him feel like he's being cut into pieces. Not unlike the one Potter had placed on him in sixth year.
"This is not just music, Potter. Its art, you uncultured mongrel." Malfoy retorted, without turning back.
"Sir, this is way above my pay grade."
"No."
"What?" Draco says dumbfounded.
Harry can feel Draco's grip tighten on Harry and his face masked in indifference. He can feel Draco bring the walls up. He can feel Draco's slight tremble no one can see but Harry can feel as he holds him. He holds him, squeezes his hips in silent reassurance and kisses his forehead. He is aware of the stares on them. He takes Draco's hand and starts to walk, glaring at everyone, daring them to say a word. No one does, just as Harry knew no one would. Draco tugs at his sleeve like a child shy and scared of the world outside and Harry, the ever loving owner of his sweet, sweet pet, pulls him close, shielding him in his protective embrace. They walk into Twillfitt And Tattings first, hand in hand. The short sprout middle age man who comes to greet them suddenly gasps as he sees them with his wide eyes. He eyes Draco warily but is smart enough to get a fake smile on his face and welcome them inside.
"It won't go. It keeps reminding me who I am. Why are you with me? I don't deserve any love." He sobbed.
Potter leaves Smith's throat and he scrambles to run away. Potter leans and gives Draco a long, possessive kiss. Draco chuckles in the kiss when he hears a few wolf whistles. Potter takes Draco's hand and leads them out of the common room for the great hall.
"Deal. I'm going to win this one Potter." Draco's smirk widens.
"I used you?" Darien sneers. "Millicent, don't fuck with me. What do you think you are? A sixteen year old innocent child who knows nothing? Who I mislead and coerced into sex? Madame, even top level executives don't have the perks you enjoy in the office. The perks I give you. You stay in the best hotels while traveling. You keep getting out of turn promotions and salary hikes, I've always given you anything you've ever asked for. So think twice before you say that I've been using you. It's just surprising that you haven't asked for money yet." Darien removes his coin pouch and pulls out about 20 galleons and throws it on the floor. "Here. Take this. The price of 'using' you." Darien takes his coat and walks out of the flat.
But with this new powerlessness, comes new freedom.
"How do you know?" Harry asked.
"Harry." Draco says in an extremely small voice, barely audible.
I am not acting.
"Draco Malfoy." The blond says after a few seconds of silence.
"Keep the scars." Harry blurts out.
"I liked it when you called me baby." Draco mumbles.
"The last few weeks with Hera, has been the most beautiful time in my life. My entire life would've been beautiful, if if 140 years ago, I would've been brave and stayed with her, if I would've listened to my heart instead of the society. To find something better, to have a better life, that search for better never ends, but time does. It's your heart you should always listen to. I wish I would've listened to my heart instead of my brain." Ralph ends up sobbing while Draco tries to control his. And Pansy runs.
Draco's POV
"You can leave now. Do come back when you do something about them attacking my boyfriend first. And send an owl asking for permission to meet me before you come here to waste our time. Also, knock the door before entering. You're a head auror, you should have some decency." Harry ordered the head auror.
Gags (rubber)Gags (tape)
"She's dating the Malfoy child! And Harry's dating Malfoy. Did you know she was dating the Malfoy child?" Ron asks and Hermione smirks.
"As a date?" Draco asked.
"Daddy. Nini." Teddy said and yawned. Draco smiled and started humming. After a while, Teddy was asleep in his arms.
"I can still consider." Harry replied.
"I'll still just check on her." Belle said and left.
"Itty bitty Draco. Missed your aunty Bella?" She said and then gave her psychotic laugh. I forced myself to give a weak smile. "You have earned the privilege to sit with us Draco. We will tell you what to do and teach." She said and lead me towards the staff table.
“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback.
"I didn't know that. They turned into squibs?" Harry asked. He actually didn't know that.
"Okay, first of all, I met him so that I could tell him to fuck off permanently. Second, who the fuck do you think you are? My father?" Draco yelled.
"You're just jealous because I have more sex than you even though I'm single while you have a girlfriend." Draco narrows his eyes at Theo.
"I'm poor." He looks at Potter and tells.
Harry rolls his eyes.
"Happy Halloween Harry." Draco replied and apparated them to the graveyard.
Malfoy smirks. He knew no one will be this good without ulterior motives. He raises an eyebrow.
Silence.
Good for you: selena gomez
Draco and Harry didn't wait for Mr Weasley to finish this sentence and crashed their lips on each other's. The crowd roared. The press clicked so many pictures.
I was excited for you! Girls like men who like dogs. If she could see how Good you are with dogs, she'll like you more!
Draco laughs at Harry's lame joke. Harry's laying on the bed as Draco is sitting on his stomach. There's a box of small pastries and cupcakes on Harry's chest, which Draco is using as a table. He takes some pastry on the spoon and feeds it to Harry, smiling and smiling, Harry accepts the sweet treat. Harry loves these moments just as much he loves the sex.  Draco is so carefree and like a kitten during these times. He loves how sappy it is. He loves Draco's laugh and he loves how he feels so happy and complete. Harry places the pastry box aside on the bed and grips Draco's hips, he pulls Draco forward and with a smile, Draco bends down to kiss Harry. Harry kisses his lips, his cheek, his nose, his lips, then he expertly, removes Draco's blouse.
Draco went back to his two story apartment, him and Darien were hosting yet another dinner with friends. For everyone, Draco and Darien were the ideal couple. Marriage, whether it teaches you anything else or not, it teaches you the art of acting. And the fact that they both were occlumence helped keep the appearances on. It's been nineteen years since they married. Darien was a lovely man who came to Hogwarts from Dumstrang for his last year after the war. They married immediately after graduation. Had Scorpius three years later. Nineteen years of marriage but now, the thought of spending an evening together eats them alive. They keep hosting dinners and parties so that they won't have to spend the evening alone. They have locked their lives away from eachother while staying together. Draco still doesn't know how they have let themselves come at this point. Every evening when they come back home and have to spend alone, ends up in fights, terrible fights. They used to fight before as well, but the moment they went to bed together, it was forgotten. But now, now even the space in between them as they lay on the same bed with their backs at each other screams.
"How is Weaslette on bed?" Draco asks. He is totally complete bent, gay, homosexual, and the thought of women on bed doesn't excite him one bit. But it's the gossip he will like. It's the sharing stories and chatting that he'll enjoy.
"Ginny is frustrated. It was mutual you know, the decision to finish it. But they don't understand. Want us to drag this miserable marriage when we both would be happier separated. She's in love with Luna and they don't agree with her to finish off her marriage. And they still hate me to agree with her. I've spent half of my life miserable, from the start. I can't drag on for ages of a ruined marriage. Magical people live too damned long for it and I'm just 36. Still have like a century to go by." Harry sighed.
"Are we having a party in the middle of the week? If so then without music, its pretty lame." Potter said.
"Are you ready?" Potter asked.
"Mr Potter. Fancy seeing you here. What are you doing at my home?" Mafilda asks, her eyes not leaving Harry's.
"To help you, of course. I want you to read one book per week. And discuss the book with your friends. Different friend each week. You can choose to discuss it with Andromeda, Potter, Nana Paki, whoever you want. But, it has to be a different person every week. Once you've gone through all the people close to you, you can repeat."
"There's a letter for you." Draco said.
"It's called Legos. You have to build the buildings and houses and what not. The muggle way. It was Draco's choice." Potter says proudly.
Another loud noise of laughter.
(I know Teddy is a Hufflepuff but I needed him to br Slytherin for this story.)
"What did you tell him?" Draco asks quietly after a pause.
Darien smiled.
Mummification/saran wrappingStraight jackets
Potter kisses him again. Kisses his hair, his forehead, his nose, his lips, his cheek, his lips, his jaw, his lips. Potter presses his palm on Draco's erection, kneading it, massaging him, turning Draco into a moaning mess. Draco tightens his hold on Potter's shirt, his breathing fast.
"Unless you don't want it, yes."
I leave my dorm and go in the common room. I see everyone is just as worried as me. I look at Luna and she looks at me. Luna is usually always high spirited, no matter the situation. But today, even she is as glum as anyone could be. With Luna being this way, I only lose more hope. What will happen to us?
"Guys. Can I talk to  Potter alone for a moment?" I ask. They all leave us alone.
Fuck! I'm scared. It could've been me if it wasn't for Draco. Merlin. I am so scared. That Hufflepuff child had to go through I fate I was supposed to go through. Its my fault
"Did you see him? How is he?" Narcissa asked slowly.
"Just for you, Granger. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to use the restroom." Draco stood up.
"There's an entire breed named after Salazar Slytherin in India. He made that name when he left for a year after creating Hogwarts. Haven't you read Hogwarts: A History?" Draco asks.
"Can't. Gran wouldn't agree and she's scary." Neville replied.
Potter raised his eyebrows and Draco flushed. He had the decency to look sheepish and he averted his eyes. Potter kissed his forehead.
Rude James! I made your date more interesting. Didn't you see how happy Red was seeing me?
"Come, Ralph. Please. Let's go." Hera says with tears in her eyes.
"Shut up!" Harry yelled so loud, it broke the silencing charms he always kept in the kitchen.
"I love you, so much, Draco. I can't even begin to explain." Harry says panting.
"Draco Malfoy-Claiborne." Draco smiles.
Draco is anxious about this meeting. Potter has already done a lot for him. He got Draco out of Azkaban. Belle tries to calm Draco but even she's nervous. Pansy, Theo and Blaise are in other room. They've left us alone for the meeting. The fire in chimney roars and Potter comes out of it. Potter smiles at Belle and kisses Draco's cheek. Draco's cheeks turn red blushing. Harry asks what was so urgent and Draco tells him about the hearing. Harry tells Draco that he will be there to testify for him. The fire in chimney roars again and Draco's lawyer appears. The lawyer sits with Draco, Harry and Belle. They show the lawyer the enchanted diaries and tell him everything. The lawyer puts Belle's, Harry's, Pansy's, Theo's and Blaise's name for witnesses. He tells that he has to talk to Luna, Ginny, Neville and Hannah as well. As Draco has so many people to testify for him, the lawyer says it is easy to win the case. And the diaries make it more easy to prove. Plus if this all is true then Draco can claim to have veritaserum and it will only come as more support to his testimony.
"That she is. The best one." Neville smiles and runs towards her.
"It was chaotic. We didn't really want to be with each other. Even the sex was a pathetic attempt to get our relationship back. The only good thing it led to was Lily. But our marriage was over. I never wanted to leave my job, she wanted to travel and play quidditch. I love the chase, I loved being an auror. But the job doesn't give much time for family. I still made time for the kids, but I just couldn't find the strength to do it for Ginny. Then she started spending more and more time with Luna. Rest, you know. I think we were so desperate to feel alive and normal after that war that we rushed into having a family. All of us. Now Hermione and Ron are having issues because Hermione supports our divorce." Harry finished.
Draco stops, Harry's dick still in his mouth and gives Harry a confused look. Harry tugs on Draco's hair and Draco moans.
"I hope you remember you have a boyfriend." Nott says and Malfoy chuckles at that.
"I know you." Draco says.
Everyone looks at her as if she has grown a second head and Harry wonders why she said this. Slowly they get back to their chatter. The entire day goes by and nothing happens untill Ron, Hermione and Harry enter their eight year common room. What they see is a sight of Draco Malfoy sitting on one of the chairs with his feet on the table, sipping wine. Him sitting in a very unMalfoyish way. Lavender Brown sitting besides him rolling her eyes. The scars on her face very prominent.
"So you just went along with it. Did you want to?" Harry asks again. Draco nods his head.
"I love you, Theodore Nott." Charlie smiled.
"What do you mean?" Albus asks, baffled.
Draco and Blaise cheered the most.
"Oh god I hated those." Blaise said.
"I miss her." Ginny says.
"Did he ask you? Before touching you."
Sirius if this is another stupid pun then I'm punching you.
"I always liked Eltanin. It's a star in Draco constellation." Draco bites his lip.
Harry started with slow thrusts, slowly going in and out of Draco. Teasing Draco with the slowness.
"Yes Master." Draco replies breathless.
"It's a beautiful garden. Can we come here again?"
Nura said pleased.
Dear Mr Malfoy,
Draco opens the door immediately and I go in. He closes the door and puts wards and silencing charms. I see that I'm not alone. Pansy, Blaise and Theodore are there as well. I give them a weak smile but they give me a nice warm smile in return.
"Why are they here, Narcissa?" He asked quietly.
"And your aunts? Do they?"
Harry looks at Ginny, still feeling guilty. She's an amazing girl. Supporting Harry as her heart breaks, Harry wishes he could ease her pain somehow.
"Pansy didn't want them both to meet me first. I heard her tell them that she doesn't want me to meet them. That I'm still hurting and she'd kill them if they rub salt on the wounds. Blaise made her understand that aunt was still family and that it should be my decision if I want them to stay or leave."
, not even being a proper girl and this is how you repay us? By putting your parents in Azkaban? The parents who didn't kill you off and kept you even after your miserable state. You little faggot. Don't ever dare come back to us. We should've killed you the moment we found out your pathetic condition. You're dead to us.
"They're looking at you Draco. They miss you too." Harry kisses his temple.
"Please don't. I am so bored of this discussion. We all have had this discussion like a hundred times already. Give up you assholes." Malfoy says bored.
"Snakes are scaley, not slimey, my idiotic lion." Teddy chuckles.
Harry pulls back and cups Draco's sunken cheeks in his hands. Draco as always looks beautiful but harry feels the gut wrenching pain he feels when he looks at his sweet pet.
"He saved my life." Potter replied.
"Well she married a muggle and was disowned. Then she gave birth to Nymphodora Tonks who married Remus and they gave birth to Teddy. He's your family." Harry explained.
"If I, if I tell you something, will you be able to forgive me?" Draco asks after a beat and turns around.
"Don't worry Minnie. I don't really care about anyone else."
"Goodbye gorgeous." Christian says and Draco knows that he means it. He knows that Christian will never sought out for him on his own. And unless Draco doesn't go to him, he won't show face.
True to his words, Harry makes honey-lemon drizzle along with raspberry dark chocolate sauce. True to his guess, Draco doesn't come. Why would he after the way Harry broke his heart, humiliated him after saying he loves him back? Harry can't stop the tear that leaves his eyes.
Washing mouth out with soap
Draco, like Harry's good boy, walks half pace behind as a sign of respect to his dominant.
McGonagall enters and we all go to sit. Ginny makes it a point to sit between me and Luna so we can talk. Ginny takes a parchment and writes on it.
______________________________________
"Love left us." Harry replied.
I saw Draco looking at his Slytherin friends. I immediately understood their silent agreement but I wasn't sure if what I understood was right. Their food looked so good but none of them touched anything but the fruits. I saw Pansy, Blaise and Theodore not having a bite of anything else. I looked at Draco, all he ate was a green apple.  I felt content. They were with us in their own way. I took few bites of whatever it was in my bowl. It wasn't good but it was bearable. I had to keep myself fed to keep fighting.
Harry looks back at Draco, his dark mark visible on his arms. Harry remembers how he tried not to let the mark affect him last night. A visible factor of so much Draco has gone through. A visible statement of his father selling him for his selfishness. He knows this is just one of the scars Draco has faced. He is still not comfortable to show Harry his scars. Harry wishes he could somehow end Draco's self hatred. It is so different from the self obsessed, self loving boy Draco was. He lifts his hand starts threading through his pet's white blond hair. In his sleep, Draco gives a content sigh. This is the first time in two months of sharing a dorm together, Harry realises the he is the first one to wake up between them. Draco nuzzles more into Harry, climbing up a bit and wrapping himself around Harry. Draco doesn't snore while he sleeps. Of course he doesn't, the posh git. Harry casts a cleaning charm in his mouth and accio's Quiditch Through The Ages. He slowly flicks through the book while Draco lays asleep on top of him.
"They will pay for this, my love. I'll make sure of it." Harry promises him.
"Suck my cock again, pet. Its hard and I want to cum." He teases.
"Why are we going France?" He asked with a pout.
"You can't say yes to anyone else from now then. You're all mine." Potter says and kisses his forehead.
Silence.
Whelve: to bury something, hide.
"Oh, Potter. I don't know what to say. I shouldn't be laughing. You ruined his life and you robbed me of one of my good fucks." Malfoy says.
Hera,
"So. I'll call you Master?" Draco asked shyly.
Millicent was quite as she and Cormac walked towards a land with ruined half constructed building.
Harry's yells can be heard in the entire mannor.
Draco saw Potter to make a move of the professor, enraged but Draco stopped him with a shake of his head. This was his battle. He would fight it himself. And he was glad when Potter listened to him.
"You ready?" Harry asked Draco. Draco was dressed in a nice black blouse and that black leather skirt, he had used to seduce Harry for the bet. He looks damn right fuckable. Gorgeous enough to eat. His hair, long and slightly wavy, heightening his sharp and pointy features. And as if the barely there skirt wasn't enough, he was wearing black stilletos to drive Harry further mad. Harry eyed him like a hungry predator. He knew Draco won't say no but he didn't want to ruin Draco's effort of dressing up. He did want to rip apart Draco's clothes but he also didn't. Draco had put in a lot of effort. He devoured Draco's slim white legs, looking so tall in the stilletos. In the six inch heels, Draco looked at least an inch taller than Harry and Harry was not complaining. He'll have Draco look as a fucking giant if it means Draco would look like this in heels. He finally looked at Draco's face and that drove him further mad
"Why didn't you?"
Draco can't stop the smile that spreads in his face. He tries very hard to stop it but just can't. That warm feeling in his chest that keeps returning, returns. He turns and looks at Weasley who looks like he's going to be sick and has gone red all over.
"Then no. I don't want to."
"Wouldn't you make me anyway?" Draco asks.
"What is troubling you, Harry? Are you and Draco okay?" She asked.
"Not at all. Sweet kids. Keeping the children happy. They entertain us also sometimes." Hera replies.
"The first day we smoked?" Malfoy asks. He still hasn't looked at Harry, his eyes on the view.
Double penetration (oral and anal)Double penetration (anal and vaginal)Triple (oral and anal)
"I'm not hungry."
She wakes up and rubs her eyes with her palms. "That breakfast isn't worth waking up for." She whines.
"Yes." Ron and Hermione smiled.
"She was more of a mother to you in a week than I had been in your entire life?" I mother asked with gritted teeth.
"Well, at least we-" Whatever Hermione was saying got cut when their compartment door opened along with everybody's mouths.
Harry snickers. The rest of the day, Draco doesn't let himself feel bad. Instead, he enjoys. He enjoys Harry holding his hand, leading him to other places. He enjoys watching a movie with Harry. He enjoys the pizza and waffles with ice cream. He enjoys Harry's warm presence and undivided attention.
"Understandable. Will you tell me if you needed to stop?" Harry asked and Draco nodded. Harry roughly grabbed Draco's hair and yanked it behind, resulting in Draco's head to roll back moaning in pain.
"Well, what do you expect? You named him James Sirius. This was bound to happen." Draco laughed back.
"He's not gonna come." Harry tells Eveta as he watches Draco leave. Hugs Eveta back as she hold him to comfort him.
Young god- Halsey
Harry can feel the intense gaze of Draco's silver eyes. There's no judgement, no amusement, no disgust, just curiosity. Harry smiles.
They land in Potter's room. Draco opens his eyes and all he can see is Potter. He can feel Potter's powerful magic, magic so powerful that he apparated inside Hogwarts. Potter's eyes study him, as if this is the last time Potter will ever be able to see Draco and Draco, he burns with desire. His body burns, aching to be touched. The cold rain did nothing but drench them, did nothing to soothe the burning. Draco feels Potter's cold, soothing fingers on his throat, lightly touching as an artist touches their art with delicate fingers. Draco can't help the soft sigh that escape his lips. He can't help as his hands find them in Potter's hair and on his neck, holding him close as Potter places soft kisses on his throat. He can't help the moan when Potter's teeth sink into his skin, marking Draco as he sucks on Draco's throat, just besides the apple in Draco's throat. He shivers as he feels cool fingers on his hot skin just above the waistband of Draco's trousers.
"Times up." Draco stands up and walks out of office. The bell rings as soon as he opens the door to leave.
"I'll start slow. I'll start eating a little more. Baby steps." I tell her.
"Hopefully nothing to get us in trouble, dragon." He replies.
"If money was everything, I wouldn't have trying giving up my own life." Then Millicent tells the carriage rider to take a left.
"Oh, shut it." I said and ran to my room. I took out a Shakespeare book and started reading. It was difficult to concentrate after this eventful weekend.
"I will ask an auror to accompany you all and get young Mr Malfoy out." Kingsley said.
Darien realises after few seconds.
"Hera, if you stay with me, then each moment will be like a beautiful era that I'll live in. I need you."
"Harry." Draco breathed.
Raped and killed! Fuck! At times like these I sometimes wish I was a muggle and didn't know about wizarding world at all.
"Let me go and make tea." Hera leaves him on the bed, casting few cleaning and refreshing charms on herself. Then she walks towards the kitchen to set the kettle. But she suddenly feels her chest tightness, unable to make a sound, she falls down on the floor, struggling to breath. Ralph runs towards her as fast as he can in his health, holding her, dragging her to the floo.
"Finish what?"
"I promise."
"Its not possible Bee. I can't leave Teddy and I don't think I'll be able to take Teddy there. I want you to go but and complete your education. Did everyone get their letter?" I asked.
"So the rules are base on what you want?" Tori asks.
"You all have 10 seconds to sit at the table assorted to you. Fail to do so and you all will be given the same food as these students for the entire year. Plus the consequences will be severe." Snape warned.
"It's my pleasure, my dear. You're family now." She smiles warmly.
"I know. But I can't help myself when I'm around you. And if I can't get forever then I'll be happy with these nights. Like tonight. You're coming with me." Christian says and kisses.
"I didn't use any spell." Potter stares and leaves at that. Malfoy raises an eyebrow in question. "I was angry and I wanted it to happen so it happened."
I felt guilt hit my stomach. I remember casting sectumsempra on him. I can't help but sob with her.
"Please Harry." Draco said.
"Its alright. I'm glad I was able to be of service." Theo smiles.
"Harry." Draco calls out tentatively.
[A day later]
"What if he gets cold feet and the wedding is off?" Draco asked nervously.
Belle's POV
I hand Teddy to Harry and walk towards the drawer above the fire place. I remove some papers and walk towards her. I hand her the papers.
"When Amycus comes here, we have to pretend that I'm forcing myself on you. Once he sees that someone else is touching you, he'll leave you alone." I explained and she nodded.
"I don't. I just don't hate him anymore, I believe." Draco looks down.
Already have James. Don't enter.
"Thank you, love." Lavender smiles at him and takes a sip from her glass. "Woodie, though, knows magic and at least some of the things you've gone through. He's a better bet." She turns to Malfoy.
Everything is going down since the golden trio ran away. Yesterday Snape named himself as the Headmaster. Everyone knows its him who killed Dumbledore. With Dumbledore gone, its only a matter of time before we all die gruesome deaths. These racist terrorists will wait no more than a second to kill off us half-bloods and muggleborns, or as they call it, mudbloods. I wish there was a way for me to escape. I wish there was a way for me to run away from here, or at least make my parents disappear somewhere safe. I've never felt so helpless. I look at my watch. Its breakfast time. I dread going out of my room, but I do it still. All I can do is slowly wait for my painful fate.
Dear Mr Malfoy
"You've eard abouz me?" The duke asks and Harry inclines his head. "By who?"
"Well, Ms Parkinson, colour me impressed. Although, if this gets out, I'll find a way to end you. You start Monday."
"The beginning is always a good start." Christian says and Draco shakes his head.
"Why didn't you ever tell me?" Harry asks softly.
"Why are you doing this? For a bit of salary increase?" Millicent turns away.
Draco debates on where to put his hand. In the end, he isn't able to give up and gives in the temptation. He wraps his arms around Harry's firm and srong stomach and ignores the heat that pools in his stomach and cheeks. Harry grins at him from the mirror and starts the bike.
"If you win, and I say yes, how will I belong to you? I'm a Malfoy, Potter. I still belong to my father." Draco has to know.
"Good kitten." Harry smiles as he pulls off.
I look at Draco who is looking down. He can't get himself to look up. I look at the Gryffindor table. Some of the kids who helped with the kida escaping are looking at me and Luna. I look at the pureblood table and see my three friends looking at each other and me. I see Pansy's eyes are all watery. She's trying very hard not to cry. So am I. Its taking every bit of my will power not to cry but I hear a sob besides me. Luna is crying. I look at her and I can't stop myself. I take her hand and we both start crying silently. Trying not to draw attention to ourselves.
"Well, she did aid me after the punishments, but she never stopped him. She did love me. But I can't forgive her. She didn't stop my father from abusing me. That already makes her not worth of being a mother." Draco stated.
Cormac's heart starts pounding in his chest. Fear is something he understood even as a Gryffindor. Now he had to find a way out of this mess.
Everytime Draco thinks he can't anymore, the tears leave his eyes. He gives out a dry sob, unable to speak. He doesn't deserve it, this kindness, this hopefulness, the way Mr Olivander smiles at him. Mr Olivander holds Draco with his hands that shiver with old age and pulls him close, hugging him again. Draco stands there sobbing, hugging the man who was once tortured in his own home. He leaves the shop with a smile on his face that appeared first time in months.
Harry can feel his hands shaking as he tries to open the light mint green door of his little bakery with the keys. He dropped Teddy off to school and came straight here. He feels white hands over his as someone takes the keys away from him. He turns to watch Eveta watching him with concerned brown eyes. Eveta, a squib he kind of adopted. She's 17, in college, doing film making. She lives with Harry and Teddy. Her hair jet black that she can easily pass as Harry's sister, but straight instead of unruly like that of Harry's.
"What do you mean just?" Harry looks at him.
"Are you going to do to your cousin what your aunts did to you?" Marina asks.
"Pinning my wrists on the wall above my head."
Harry chuckled. He knew Draco wouldn't answer anything straight away. It was Draco afterall.
Draco's POV
And the crowd sings again.
"For my mother." A tear escapes Draco's eyes. He's just so tired, he can't stop himself. "I just wanted her safe. I tried." He sobs. He can feel his shoulder jerking. He can feel the tears stain his cheeks. " He would've killed her. I just wanted my mother safe. I wanted her safe. I wanted her alive and I did all I could to keep her alive. I didn't want to do any of it. I tried so much to find a way. To find a way to break the loyalty bonds. To break her marriage so that I can take her away and keep her safe. To take her away from my father and the other death-eaters. I tried."
"No, Hera no. Please." Ralph begs and screams as Hera goes still in his arms and her eyes closes. Her breathing stops.
Jealous- Nick Jonas
"Is that what he said?" Millicent asks hopefully.
Draco's POV
Slowly the chatter resumed. Resumed for everyone but Harry who couldn't think of anything but glossed pink lips, tight leather pants, white blond hair and extremely skinny body. Harry tried to get a look at Malfoy again but failed. Failed until he sat on his Gryffindor table and Malfoy sat on the Slytherin table. He stared at the blond who chattered around with few Slytherins of his year with an amused smirk on his face. He lifted his eyes and met Harry's. Silver eyes fixed with emerald green. Malfoy's smirk widened and he raised an eyebrow. Harry stared at him intently with unreadable expression and then slowly gave a predatory grin. He doesn't know what made him do it, but something did and he relished on the blond's reaction. His eyes widened and pale cheeks filled with colour. He averted his eyes and got back in the conversation like whatever the hell it was just happened, didn't happen at all. But Harry knew it happened. The proof was there, right on Malfoy's cheeks, the pink tinge.
He's pleased to see that Draco doesn't dare move. Not even to get his hands in a slightly comfortable.
"You forgot what today is?" Draco asks. He can feel the tears threatening to spill.
"Be good little girls alright?" Draco kisses Narcissa and Lily on their heads as the nany takes them away for school. As soon as the nanny disappear, Harry pins Draco down on the door, kissing him hard.
"What's not at all surprising though is that Harry chose Malfoy for seven minutes in heaven." Ginny grinned.
I stand up and so does Luna. She catches my hand and we walk to the great hall. In other circumstances, this would've been special. But I know Luna doesn't feel that way about me and I've let that pass. We sit on our table. I can't get myself to eat even one bite. Neither can Luna.
Ginny frowned.
Cormac had packed his trunk. He was about to go in his living room to floo in the ministry so that he can arrange a portkey to leave London. Go back to Yorkshire. He walks in the living room and falls down as Millicent lands on top of him. He thinks it's a dream for a minute only to realise the truth when Millicent kisses him. He grins as he kisses back.
Harry laughed. Another sign that Draco is getting better. His pet is getting his sass back.
"A squib? Yeah?" Weasley grinned.
She gets up and looks at the mirror in between of my library. "I have no marks of forcing." She says. I look at her wide eyed. She takes a deep breath and takes her wand. She mumbles something and some scratches appear on her neck. She flinches in pain. I look at her horrified.
In another time, it would've been an honour to teach at Hogwarts. I wouldn't have minded, but in these circumstances, all I wanted was everything go back to normal. I sat besides Aunty Bella. Snape sat where Dumbledore used to sit. I remember the day he died so well. All I wanted was to live like a normal teenager but I was forced into doing so many things I didn't want. I didn't want this mark. I didn't want to kill anyone. But I did what I had to do to keep my parents safe.
"Yes." He says in a weak voice.
"Is my dress fine? Do you think I should change my hair? Oh god what if I fall down while walking?" Belle kept babbling.
"Harry, please." Draco begged.
"But-"
"Darien is having an affair." Draco admitted.
"I wasn't the only one." Draco says. "There's a flat in Cambridgeshire. She takes small boys there. Clicks pictures in the process. One of the reasons father was able to escape azkaban. He used this information and used me to get it years ago."
"Goodbye, Potter." He says and leaves.
He groans and gets up to leave. As he walks, he accidentally dashes to one of the Ravenclaws Harry does not know. Without apologizing, Malfoy starts to walk away only to be pulled back by the Ravenclaw guy.
"Darien, remember I said that someone was coming to meet Nan? I would be late today, so..." Draco trailed off.
"Do you promise not to let anyone purposely know that Theodore Nott will be helping you with the tasks?"
"You will talk to me and end it off properly instead of giving up and having an affair."
"Healer Jacobs. I'm really sorry if you were disturbed." Cormac smiled apologetic.
"I do." Harry smiled.
"Where is she, McLaggen? Where is she?" Pansy asks in a cold hard voice.
"Hi darling." McLaggen greets.
"Bee don't do that." I hear him say.
"I want someone who loves me for real." Millicent replies.
It's during lunch that an eagle owl finds its way to Draco and drops an envelope. Not just any envelope, but an envelope with Malfoy crest. Well, fuck. This can't be good. Theo squeezes his hand in silent support. Draco gulps and with shaking hands opens the letter. It is exactly what he imagined it will be. His father's letter, disowning him. He skims through the huge paragraph where his father writes how disappointed he is, searching to the money part. Ah, there it is. All his inheritance vanished. He will no longer have rights to his inheritance. His eyes widen and he looks sick.
"Harry. It's good to see you again. Let's go to my office." He smiled and lead Harry, Ron and Hermione to a small office.
"Like, feelings?"
"I'll miss you all." Hugo started to cry. All the kids hugged Hugo.
Belle's POV
Draco chuckled.
I stepped ahead, scared. Luna was about to say something but I shook my head at her, silently pleading her to be quite. I couldn't let Luna get hurt. I stood there waiting for something to hit me and then it happened. Alecto mumbled the crucio in a bored voice and I felt the pain. It screamed. It felt so painful, like being punched and kicked and beaten but it felt I was being beaten not only on my skin but every fiber of my body. It felt like my body was being torn apart. I screamed and I screamed. The pain finally stopped and I lay there on the floor with tears in my eyes, too exhausted and in pain to move.
I chose green apple to give to Luna because I knew that food will go unsuspected. Everyone knows I can eat all the green apples in the world. She huffs and leaves. I make sure she has actually left and run to the cells.
"Mr Paralegal, hi!" Millicent smiled. "Congratulations! Where's my treat?"
"Well, if you say yes to me and lose, I can make it good for you." Potter says and all of Draco's smiles die.
"I'm ready now." She says crying.
"About Draco's attackers. None of them are sane. The aurors had to get a special curse breaker from France to break the wards you put there and that took almost a week. None of those people are sane and there are signs of abuse. All of them turned into squibs." Hermione ranted with concern.
"Good as well. St Mungos had their job done easier as you had healed me up just fine. You should see to be a healer. You'd do good." Thomas says with a pat on Draco's shoulders and leaves the common room towards his dorm.
"I like pain. The spankings, the toys like flogger and cane. I like being immobilised. I like sensory deprivation as well. Being blindfolded and gagged. And-" Draco trailed off. His cheeks turned crimson and he blushed furiously. This was something he really liked but was kind of embarrassed about.
I closed the journal and stared at it. I felt so many emotions. I felt happy because I felt connected to my family that I lost. I felt angry because I couldn't save my godfather and uncle Moony. I felt upset because they aren't here with me anymore. I realized that Draco had Teddy in his arms. Draco's expressions were upset as well. He still gave me a weak smile. I gave him a kiss and we all fell asleep together.
Cormac persed his lip, wished the healer goodnight and entered his flat. Cormac's father was a waiter in a muggle restaurant. He was extremely young when he understood that it's a cut throat world who will climb on to you to be on top if you don't climb on them first. He had got this flat extremely cheap in an auction after the war. Stability was something he needed and he could use rent money for something else. So he worked in a law firm for 50 galleons a month. He didn't waste all the money in living his youth though. He was in a race in this world and he needed to come first. So he cleared the flat, cleaning it sparkling for yet another one of his executives so that they would give him a solid recommendation on his letter for promotion. This promotion means his salary doubling and he gets his own small cabin.
"Millicent, uh, well, she would be happy now." Cormac says with a sinking heart.
Its okay Bee. We already knew this was going to happen. So we already spoke to little snakes. They will be as out of trouble as possible. Just select any kid you see first and that's the one you rescue this week. I know it's tough but I'll try to find out which specific kids Greyback is eyeing on. Then we can save them.
"Mostly after a week. Oh yeah, please be a darling and put my phone on charge." Darien asks.
Blindfolds
"I know what you're feeling." Harry said.
A stage and sitting area was set up at a beautiful beach. The sun was setting and the sky was mixed with pink, orange and yellow hues. The front row was completely empty. Those seats were kept for those who were no longer alive but lived in people's hearts. James and Lily Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, The Tonks, Professor Snape and Dumbledore, Fred, Dobby, and an empty cage was kept for Hedwig. Behind the empty row sat Belle and Blaise, Professor McGonagall, Pregnant Pansy and Luna, Ron and Hermione, Teddy with  Mrs Weasley. Behind them were Theo and Ginny, George and Angelina, Bill and Flur with their four year old daughter Victorie, Neville and Hannah, Hagrid and some of their work friends.
"Night night dad. Love you too." Teddy says before he falls asleep.
He's still upset. He knew this would happen, he just didn't think it will happen too soon.
"Why would you say that?" Potter asks
"Who did you trap now?
Yes deer.
"Would you like to eat it as a kitten or as a human?"
"Nightmares?"
"To... To Mr Malfoy's study. He had ordered me to get in there." I say. I can feel my eyes welling up.
"Please Sir, can I cum?" I ask.
"Sorry. I can't. I'm taking my girlfriend to hogsmade. And you should leave. She's very possessive." Scorpius smiles apologetic.
"This collar is a sign, a symbol of our relationship. It's extremely pure and for me it means parmanent. I love you Draco and I'd love to have you forever, own you forever. Not just as my slave or my pet, but as my lover too. Would you agree to wear it?" Harry asks.
"Yes, Draco. Why? We thought you'd love this bakery. Jenna said that the baker was cute as well. Fits your type."
Draco smiled. That evening when he sucked off Potter first, they had gone through a bunch of rules for Draco. Things Draco is allowed and not allowed to do on a regular basis. Like he didn't need permission to get out of the bed unless Potter specifically tells him not to. And Draco is not allowed to sit with his legs folded as a sign that he is available for Potter all the time. When Draco asked him if he can go and spend some time with the Slytherins, Potter had clearly told him that whatever Draco did in his personal life was his choice. That he didn't need to ask permission as it was Draco's life and his choices and he needed to understand this. Whether Draco wanted to work or sit at home, it was Draco's choice. Draco only had to follow rules in their private life which included Potter.
"Draco. Please talk. Say something, please." Harry begs.
"Here you are." Potter walks into the bedroom and looks at Draco.
Christian still looked the same. Clean shaven and messy black curls. He had tanned a bit more and grew a little more muscles. He looked good. Draco blinked.
"You dreamt of him again, didn't you?" Eveta asks.
All Draco does is looks heavenward and takes a deep breath as if asking for strength to tolerate his dorky owner.
"That was amazing, pet. You did so good." Potter praises and Draco loves it. He loves it so much. He loves knowing he's been good and has pleased. Not many people tell him that.
"Have you done any business before?" Darien asked.
Pads you better run, I just saw Moony pinch his nose in frustration.
"You were absolutely wonderful, my love. Brilliant!" Harry beams.
"I want to go to the love of my life." Draco sobbed with tears. "Why wont you let me?"
Its alright Bee. There's still time for that. We love you.
"What was what?" Draco asked feigning innocence.
"What if all that doesn't happen and you live happily ever after?" Astoria smiles.
"Enter." We hear he voice and enter. "Aah Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter. This is Mr Hugh Holland. He's here from the ministry to meet you both."
"Just shut up!" Pansy roared before slapping him right across the cheek and dragging a gasping Millicent away.
"Ever heard the phrase, 'curiosity killed the cat'?"
Then she turns to Pansy and kisses her forehead, muttering assurances to her. Pansy holds Draco's handa and leads him to the train. All of them walk together, Theo, Tori, Daphne, Millie, Blaise along with Pansy and him. He ignores all the shocked looks and the sneers. The shocked looks might be related to his hair. It's below his shoulder, still white blond but all curly and wavy. He quietly walks with them and enters the Slytherin compartment.
Fuck yeah!!!
"How long do you think they'll be able to handle the cruciartus curse?" Hary muses out loud.
"Its okay Draco. I understand. But you can't do this anymore. Please talk to me if you feel triggered. Please. Can you do that for me?" I ask softly.
Draco can feel his heart rate getting faster. He flushes and then does what Potter said. He bends down and catches his ankles. He feels exposed as his skirt hikes up, giving the view of his lower arse and blue knickers. He can feel Potter running his hands through the knickers, kneeding his arse, fondling it. He feels Potter sliding the knickers to the side, exposing his hole. He feels a lubricated finger sliding in and out of his hole. Draco moans. He feels another finger, the burn of the stretch, sweet. Then he feels something else getting inside his arse. It's not Potter's cock. It's not fingers. It feels like silic- Oh! He moans as the large silicon buttplug slide in his hole and press against his prostrate. Potter adjusts the plug so that Draco would feel it pressing his prostrate with every step he will take and adjusts his knickers back. Tight knickers. That Potter chose. Tight ones so it will not let the plug adjust. The sadistic bastard. Draco can't possibly fall in love anymore than he is. He stays there, bent over, holding his ankles as Potter studies his behind then circles around him like a predator.
Instead of going to the rooms we go in the kitchens. Theo and Pansy tell us to be comfortable while they cooked for us. I've never seen a Slytherin being remotely polite and here four Slytherins could easily be mistaken ad Hufflepuffs.
"Will do." Harry smiles at Draco reassuring.
"It's the truth Potter. Whether you like it or not. For us you'll just be Potter but for the world you are many titles. Titles that Draco will have to carry the burden of shall you decide to court him. He might be ready in future but right now, he is not. He still has a mark on him arm and he's still a Malfoy. Half of the world still hates him for it. And he is still a Slytherin. The entire world hates us for it on principal itself without actually knowing us. We can't walk around the school alone for a second ever since we were first years. And you know who are the most vicious with us? Gryffindors. Even with Slytherins who have never done anything to them. You all fight us saying we are prejudiced about muggleborns but you all do the same with us because we are Slytherins. Even the teachers do it. The headmaster did it."
"He'll be fine, Harry. He's stronger than he thinks he is. We'll search him." Ginny tries to reassure him.
TicklingKissing
"Would you like to go out tonight?" Potter asks him.
The seconds hand of the clock ticks by. The sound so loud in this ridiculous office. It's all beige and brown and white. The stupid couch is brown as well. Draco lays on the couch, wearing black trousers and dark grey shirt button upped. His sleeves rolled up that shows his mark all black and prominent. His hand is on his chest, interwined. He keeps tapping his right foot on the handle of the couch. He looks at the ridiculous posters with things like
"Draco! Wake up!" Harry yells trying to wake him up.
"You want it, my little cocksleeve?" Potter asks, and that insult goes straight at Draco's cock.
His face falls as he looks at her covering her face with a veil.
"Have some water, my love. And breakfast. Then you can tend to me and prepare to meet Ginny." He says as Draco tries to recover from two strong orgasms he had.
"It is." Draco heard Mr Olivander's voice, hoarsed and shaky with old age.
"Hi Tilly. Do you know what toddlers eat?" I ask.
"Do you like this slut? Do you like getting used for amusement and being desperate for relief?" Potter asks and Draco nods. Potter gives a hard slap on his cock which finally free the flow of waterworks from his eyes. "Answer."
In that large manor in France, Narcissa sits at that extremely expensive dining table, her hands gripping the Prophet so hard, she almost tears it. The Daily Prophet has an entire two page article about the trial that happened with her son. The news of Narcissa begging them to forgive her child as Lucius and Voldemort put her son through such horrid fate. They have writen about what the aurors and minister did and what state it put Draco in when the prosecutor asked him the vile questions.
He watches with amusement as Draco rolls his eyes as Harry helps him stand.
I hope I got it right. There is only so much experience an inexperienced person in bdsm relationship can have. I have an active sex life but it's normal hookups. Not bddm. If I've gotten anything wrong, please let me know.
"You're both looking pretty." I smile. Belle is wearing a one sided off shoulder top and black shorts with sneakers. Pansy is wearing skinny jeans with a nice top. Belle winks and they run away.
I'm freaking out! They've got Luna. She's locked here in our cell. They're angry about everything that was getting published on Quibbler. They will only give her back to her father if he manages to give them Potter. What do I do? I can't get her out if here. They'll know it was me.
Hermione's screams fill the Manor. I can't take this. I want to kill Bellatrix off and help Granger escape but a I can do is stand there and let it all happen. Hermione after the torture lay down on the floor like all life had veen sucked out of her. If she wasn't breathing, I would've been sure that she's dead. Bellatrix calls the goblin and inquires about the sword. He says it's fake. Suddenly Dobby is here and all out of sudden everyone is duelling Dobby helps the trio escape. Bellatrix throws her knife and it vanishes with them. I only wonder who it hurt. I really wished all of them survive. I really like Dobby. I didn't like the way father had treated him. But with the trio escaped, it'll only be more troubles for us. Potter managed to take our wands as well. My wand has gone with him. I run to my room when all the drama is over and wrote everything in diary, letting my friends know if everything that happened. I even managed to tell that Luna escaped. Belle was so happy. I was happy about that as well. Now let's see what the next few days get us. Knowing Potter has escaped, tonight I can sleep somewhat peacefully.
"I! I love you too." Neville smiles as he catches his breath. "You're extremely rude. You keep cursing at me and my Gran. You still dress like you're waiting someone to take it all off and you end up dating gays who can't understand what a bloody catch you are. But you don't make fun of my obsession with herbology and you listen to me rant and don't make fun of my clothes and you definitely ever saw me as second hand Harry Potter and don't want me for the role I played in the war. I love you, you stupid girl." Pansy chuckles happily.
"Please don't start again." Draco snaps.
Pansy removed another diary with D written on it. She gave that diary to Mr Weasley.
"It seemed useless." Draco replied after a pause. "I didn't see any reason to heal the physical scars when there was no way to heal them emotionally and mentally. Healing the scars on my body would just be like erasing the evidence that it happened. Not healing."
Draco turns to see Cormac. He smiles.

Boy its difficult to write male on male smut when you're a girl. Even if you've read like 5000 of drarry fanfics of which so many of them are pure smut.
"Truth"Hermione said.
"Its war. People always die no matter how hard you're trying." Ginny says. She has a tear rolling down her cheeks.
Wow. Hilarious
"It is true." Luna replies.
I take the letter. Its from Hogwarts. They've called all of us back to complete our seventh year. Which means that Belle will now be our classmate. I would love to go to Hogwarts again and complete my education but that isn't possible with Teddy being here.
The war is coming. Harry and his friends are here. In Hogwarts. My Slytherin friends are worried. This is the time they have to choose a side. They will have to choose the wrong side to keep all the Slytherins safe. Snape calls everyone to the great hall. We all walk. I didn't hide myself in RoR because I needed to be out for everything to work. Snape asks us if we have seen Harry Potter or anyone from the trio. He's standing here in front of me just a few people ahead. A fight broke between McGonagall, Snape and Harry. Snape ran away.
While Harry rinses off the blood and dirt as much as he can through water, Draco gets the bath ready with all the oils and bubbles. Harry leaves the shower and then settles in the tub. He sighs and closes his eyes as he feels Draco massage his hair and apply the shampoo.
"Hmm. Maybe. We'll see." I say and lay my head on his lap. He starts reading his cookbook again.
"Not until we get what we want." Robards says.
"I mean, I'd say torture, but it's up to you." Draco answers.
"Not so soon. You can not use any mind alterations like love potion or lust potions and charms. I have to be awake and in my senses the whole time. Every time I ask you, you say no. If you do say yes before the month is over, it will be because you genuinely want to. Not because you want to win. You get that?" Potter states.
"And I will give it to you legally written that you have the permission to say no to me and that I'll listen." He says as if he had read Draco's mind. But there are a few other things that are obstacles here.
"No, Potter." Draco cuts him out and sits straight up. "They don't matter to me. You do. I've lived in a manor that never felt like home. I've never felt safe or loved there. No matter how much my mother tried. And then I lived with Theo. I was safe there somewhat and I trust Theo a lot. But that wasn't home as well. The castle was my home, but the war ruined it. Grimauld Place is not my home either. But you are. This place feels like home because you feel like home. You are my home. I have been through so much, lost so much. I refuse to lose you. So you will shut up, contact my solicitors, go after them legally and will NOT touch them. You understand?"
Castle- Halsey
"You turn him into a squib and every contract, bond and oath I've ever made to him turns null and void. How poetic, isn't it?" Narcissa smiled.
"Hello, Longbottom." Pansy smiles back.
"Stay here, pet. I'll burry these in the garden and be right back." Harry instructs and leaves his kneeling submissive in the room.
"You know you can talk to us right?" Ron asks and Harry gives out a long sigh.
"Like I'm the best thing in the world." And he is. He always was. He is the best thing in the world. Just not Draco's world.
"Thanks Malfoy. I will need it to forget the last 10 minutes and this conversation happened. Good day." Weasley says and leaves drinking the wine.
Harry almost lost his balance as he felt someone shake him. But he didn't seem to care. He just couldn't let his eyes leave Draco, sitting there biting his lip as his hair shone in the sun.
"Take me home." Draco sobs.
"Hit me with it." Harry smirks.
"I won't be, ah, able to. You just ordered me. Ngghh!"
Draco entered the office with a heavy heart. He hadn't managed to get over getting Dumbledore killed even though the bastard ruined his life. The bastard ruined so many lives. But Draco wasn't a killer. He was a bastard himself but killer wasn't it. Or maybe he was? Having someone killed indirectly while not doing anything about it was still killing, wasn't it? He was still a killer, wasn't he? He took a deep breath and tried to get out of his head. He knocked. He heard McGonagall saying to enter and Draco placed his occlumency in place, his face going blank and emotionless.
Falling slowly- Ronan Keating
That's when they heard ear splitting yelling of Harry Potter.
"In the kitchen." Andromeda shouts from the kitchen.
Harry thinks. After a few minutes of staring at Draco, he gives another 'meow' this one a little more audible than the last. His smirk widens.
"It's him, isn't it? Ze one you were forced to leave and push away." Eveta asked.
Cormac maintains a smile as they exchange numbers and walks out of the building as soon as Millicent leaves. He doesn't have it in him to stop the tears that start flowing. And then he watches them leave together in Darien's car.
"I was hoping for an interesting answer but this was interesting in its own way." Draco laughed.
"Stand up." Potter commands and Draco obeys.
"Draco!" Hermione yells and runs to undo the ropes on his hands.
"How do you feel about him coming along?"
"Potter! Fucking hell!" Draco yells and Harry runs to him, not without laughing though.
"What else is there?" Potter asks.
Neville asked Hannah for a dance with shaky hands and a lot of stammering. Hannah said yes and she burried her head on Neville's chest. As the song got over, Neville dared and kissed her. She kissed back. They've been holding hands ever since.
"Hi Ginny." I tell. I see Luna and motion her to come towards us.
As soon as they sat on their seats, a lounge seat, Harry made Draco sit besides him instead of in front of him. Draco all but ran to sit down and hide his lower body under the table, to hide his erection. Harry earned a glare as he laughed. Harry made Draco chose what to have in this French restaurant and then waited for the waiter to come.
"Brown's here too." Neville says.
My heart starts beating faster.
With tears in her eyes, Narcissa proceeds.
Pansy turns around to leave. That's weird. She knew that Zach always stayed home on Tuesdays. A crack sound meant that the elf had left. And then Pansy heard laughing and music. Pansy cast silencing charms on her heels and sneaked up to the stares towards Zach's room. The laughing grew louder. She slowly opened the door and remained there, frozen to the floor. Zach was in there, naked, making out with Earl. Pansy took a shaky breath as they saw her and scrambled to over themselves up. Pansy ran.
"You're Arry Potteh!" The man exclaims confused.
Before I could say anything Belle interrupted us.
I sigh and look at him. He's already looking at me. I check if anyone is watching us and then give him a nod. After having a few more bites I leave for my common room. I stand at the door and the portrait lady asks me a riddle.
Draco smiled. And he smiled at that tosser McLaggen. Harry has been going to meet him since two months and he never smiled at Harry, that wanker. He watches Draco as Draco leaves for the dorm. McLaggen is watching him with soft eyes and Harry hates it. He was ready to give Draco time but no. If there is possibility that someone like Charlie or McLaggen can whisk Draco away from him then they are wrong. Draco is his and his only. Unless Draco says he's not romantically interested and mean it. But till then, Harry will do everything to have Draco. Draco. Is. His.
Hermione gasped in shock and Mrs Malfoy, no, Narcissa chuckled. Hermione went red instantly and took her hand. Narcissa did the same with Ron.
"Six NEWTS and a proud war hero who will run joke shop with his brother." Flitwick said.
"Yes, Ms?"
- Bee
"Potter, what the fuck did you do?" He grits his teeth.
"Everything alright gorgeous?" He could hear concern in Christian's voice.
Harry's eyes snapped open. Was this weird? Does Draco do not like it? How did he give this up when he had tried to be subtle about it? Does Draco hate it? The last thing he wants is for Draco to feel uncomfortable and unsafe with Harry. How does one feel feel safe when they find out their lover loves seeing them cry?
"Were you sitting in the winter garden again?"
Prison
"Belle and Blaise, the two people I never thought who would actually end up settling down with anyone, let alone each other. We've all been through so much together. You both never let anyone of us down. I remember this one time, Blaise and I had gone for drinks and he wouldn't shut up about you. He kept talking about you like I dont know you. I threw a drink on his face to remind him that I know who you are. That you're my friend too. I'm glad you both found each other. I wish you both best of luck. Especially Blaise, dude you better be safe because if you hurt her, she will end you. I never understood why she didn't get in Slytherin."
"Who are you asking?" Potter raises his eyebrows in question.
Harry gasped. Narcissa Malfoy sat there, dressed elegantly in black and silver robes wearing a hat with short net veil that covered her eyes and half of her nose in it. She gracefully stood up and ventured accross the office and stood her hand out.
""Zoo? You dressed me up this way for zoo?" Draco asks and harry rolls his eyes.
"No." Draco interrupted. "You spent three months trying to 'persue' things with me and we finally 'persued' things during imbolc. You belong to the family of magic killers and blood traitors and I still gave you a chance because you weren't. I was 15 for fuck sake, Charles and you're too old for me. Still! And then you say we should wait till I'm of age to take things serious? Was I of age when we fucked? No. Did you care about it then? No. Suddenly you want to wait two years in a middle of a fucking war!"
They all were happy amd their lives couldn't have been any more perfect.
"That's a brilliant idea." I heard Pansy. "Although we should wait for Blaise. Where did he die anyways?"
"Draco, look at me please." Harry says softly.
Harry picks up Draco bridal style and puts him on the bed. He gives Draco a kiss then removes Draco's nightie. He stares at Draco with lust in his eyes. Harry tells Draco to lie on his stomach. He spreads Draco's legs and kneels between them. He kisses Draco's neck and slowly kisses his way to Draco's lower back. He them takes a part of the panties in his mouth and pulls it down. Draco raises up a little so that the panties could be removed without much trouble.
"I abused as well. Not physically, like he did. But verbally."
"Doesn't she have an ambition or something?" Ginny asked confused.
Songs
"Yes?" Harry asked.
"Incendio" the bed burst in flames and Harry sighed.
"How do you know this?" Neville asks.
"How do you feel about it?" Marina asked.
He relished on seeing Potter's eyes going wide. Potter opened his mouth to say something but then shut it and sighed.
"Keep some vows for the wedding, would you darling?" Narcissa smirks.
Draco looks back at the snake and smiles.
After the heart to heart with Draco, I walk towards my common room. I feel a hand on my shoulder and I stop. I slowly turn to see Amycus standing in front of me. My throat goes dry and my knees go weak. My heart starts beating faster. I'm scared. I just want to run but I can't. He catches my hair tight and pulls me closer. I yelp because my hair pulls and it hurts. He pulls the collar of my shirt down to see the bruises. A tear escapes my eye. His face is angry and his breath stiffened. He yanked my hair more and I let out a small scream.
"I missed you." He mumbles as he feels tears roll down his cheeks.
"We need to get Belle. We can't go without her." Theo said.
Harry looks at his sleeping pet and sighs.
"Stay here with him. Don't let anyone who isn't us, enter." Harry commands and walks out of there.
Draco looks at Potter and then back on the mirror. He runs his hands through the smal braid he had started and combs his hair again, to create side parting. The light waves naturally falling off perfectly. He but puts a small bow clip on the small side of parting and then looks at Potter for approval. He feels like a child while Potter inspects him from head to toe and manages not to shuffle on his feet or fidget. His face lights up as Potter gives a smile and a nod.
"This is too much!" The healer glares and starts to walk off.
You take constructive criticism?
"Visitors stamp. Oh look, our bus is here." Harry takes Draco's hand and leads him in the bus.
“Expelliarmus!”
Obviously
"You're a powerful wizard, Potter. And your magic is all around me, surrounding me and all over me. It affects me powerfully. Please be more careful because I won't be talking to you if I fall again because of you."
Harry picks Draco up again, bridal style, and walks into the bathroom. He puts Draco in to the bathtub and slowly disrobes him. He throws the robes away and watches at this beautiful naked boy who still won't look up. Who's face is still so crestfallen. Harry switches on the tap for warm water and puts some bubble soap inside. He takes off his own clothes and climbs in the tub. Slowly, he washes Draco's hair, Draco's body and then his own. Draco remains silent, his body working as a ragdoll as Harry wipes him and makes him wear Harry's tshirt. The only movement Draco does by himself is giving Harry his collar so that Harry can clasp it on his neck, which Harry does. Draco silently follows as Harry leads him to the bed, out of the washroom. Harry makes Draco lay which he does then lays besides Draco. Draco immediately curls up against him, holding Harry tight. And Harry holds him back, tighter.
"What the hell is that?" Draco asks.
Harry ignores the blush in his cheeks and folds the bags then wards the cabinet shut. Only he has the access to the cabinet. Not even Draco. And if Draco wants anything from this cabinet, which he always does then he has to ask Harry. And ask he does. First it used to be two three times a day but since he's got the fixation for his blood lollies, Draco asks about five to seven times a day. Harry leaves the kitchen but not without telling them that Draco and him might not be there for dinner. As soon as he enters the room, he smiles at Draco who is waiting on the edge of the bed on all fours like an eager kitten. His tail starts wagging faster as Harry enters the room. He then looks at the paper bag in Harry's hand curiously and Harry smirks.
He cleans the glass pieces he removed from Malfoy's skin and with a strong spell, the bathroom was just as perfect as it was before. As if Malfoy's shitstorm of mental breakout didn't happen at all. He sits besides Malfoy, holds him and drags him close. Malfoy comes just like Harry knew he would. He holds him, just holds him and gives him sweet caresses. He caresses his cheeks and hair and hands and just holds him. He hold him until hours past, until Malfoy somewhat feels that he isn't alone. Until he can realize that Harry is there with him. Until he falls asleep on Harry's lap. Harry gently picks him up and puts him on bed, covers him with his duvets, sits on his bed and looks at this broken shell of a man. Broken just like him if maybe not more. Who's laughs are fake and who hates the world and most probably hates himself. And Harry just stares.
Draco thanked Slughorn as well and they left his office. Harry explained what Bulstrode said and how Harry felt heartbroken and how Belle yelled at them.
"Potter, can you help me with something?" Theo asks.
"Why didn't we know McGonagall has this side?" Hannah asked.
"Why won't you ask him out?" Ginny asks as they are walking back in the castle.
"Thank you. Anything else, headmistress?"
Harry's POV
I'm dreading tomorrow. I don't know which kid will go through the horrible fate with Greyback. Its too much for me. I can't take it anymore. Here sitting in my study, my thoughts only get louder. I walk towards my table pull out the drawer. There are blades kept I've been using for a while now. This is the only way I can feel my emotions let out. I take one blade and cut it through my skin. The pain hits. It hurts bad. But I deserve this. I deserve this to be such a coward. I deserve this for not being able to stand for myself amd letting my father decide my fate. I deserve this because I let that dark lord use me like a toy and play with me, make me do horrendous things. I deserve this because I can't save all those innocent people. After what felt like hours, I finally do a healing charm and clean all the blood. I roll my sleeves down back and walk to my dorm.
"Why?"
After some grumbling, Ron took Hermione and apparated.
"A death-eater? I must say I'm surprised, Mr Potter. And a Malfoy no less. But it
Nick pulls Narcissa for a last kiss and then she pushes him back playfully as she turns to open the door to her home. Andromeda's home where they live together now. She smiles at Nick as he walks backwards smiling at her as she closes the door. She leans on the door and smiles as she bites her lip.
He hears some ruffling sound and then hears Potter walk towards him. He feels something soft and fluffy on his shoulder. He tilts his head sideways to see that Potter has placed a towel on him. Draco's cock hardens. He holds a whimper his half hard cock is making him do and takes in a deep breath. He finally lets the whimper out as he sees a naked Harry Potter step in the shower. And Draco wishes it was him given Potter a bath. Potter doesn't even look at him. He just closes his eyes and lets the hot water relax him. Draco watches as the mud and blood wash off with the force of water on his body and his shoulders relax. Those broad, strong and firm shoulders Potter built by working out everyday. He watches as Potter runs his hands all over his body, cleaning the dirt as much as he can with the water and watches as finally one hand goes on his cock. Draco takes a sharp breath in. He watches as Potter slowly takes his own half erect cock in hand and lazily starts to jerk off, holding it loosely. And Draco hardens. Oh how he wish it was him doing this to Potter. How he wishes Potter would use him instead. His mouth, hands, arse, thighs, just anything. And then Potter moans.
"Like you're a party to be with." Lavender Brown says unamused.
"You're right about that one. After years of being obsessed with Malfoy, he had to select him." Hermione laughed.
"He's flirting with you, Draco." Harry states.
"Draco, I'll be honest with you. I don't have any experience in dominating anyone and I definitely do not have any experience in using a cane. I will not use it on you until I have had proper practice. I will find other ways to bring you the pain. Till then, I have ordered a few books to help me understand this. The rules will keep adding on after I read the books to understand better until we have better parameters to draw the rules, punishments if you break them and the things we will do on regular basis. About you being a kitten, I think you'll be an extremely adorable pet. I'd love to see you in cat ears and tail." Harry grinned.
"Shut up!" Draco says.
"Are you okay?" Harry asks
Malfoy nods again.
"Yes."
"Because it isn't true. Goodbye, Potter." Malfoy says and leaves and Harry stares behind him. The door closes and Harry stares at the door Malfoy vanished from. Its only after a minute that Harry realises that Malfoy didn't touch any food.
"Rose is dating ferret jr." Ron tells baffled.
"Yes love." Theo replied.
He swallowed. He remembered the voice and he definitely remembers the touch, the feeling. He looked straight forward, Lavie was looking at him alarmed.
"Please, please Master yes, please." Draco begs.
"It won't happen again. I won't let anyone touch you. I'll do my best to keep you safe." Harry reassures him as they lay down on the bed.
"I might have an idea." She says weakly.
This can't be happening. This is too much. Why is he here? Why now? He already has the school and Potter to deal with so why him as well?
Stupid Potter. Stupid Potter who thinks thinks Draco has a choice. Stupid Potter who thinks Draco can say no. Stupid Millicent. Stupid Zabini. Stupid Daphne and Astoria. Stupid Lavender. Stupid Theo. Stupid fucking everyone who keep telling Draco that he can say no. Don't they see? Don't they understand? Don't they fucking get it that Draco can never say no? That he never had the right! He has said no. Million times. As a child. And as a teenager. Don't they fucking understand that Draco is not made to say no? That Draco is made to be used and abused. That this is what Draco was born for and this is how he has lived his life and this is how his life will remain. He's a tool. A thing to use. Has always been, ever since he was born. He's not something to cherish and be held as precious. Draco walks into the common bathroom and looks himself in the mirror. His cheek is still red from slaps. Draco feels his eyes burning. He blinks his eyes in a rapid session. A pathetic attempt to stop the tears from flowing but they do anyway. And Salazar, Draco hates crying. But why can't anybody understand that Draco can't say no? He doesn't has the right. He never did. Draco goes in the stall, takes out his wand and casts silencing charms. He rests his back on the door that he locked. Silent tears flowing from his eyes. He drags himself down and sits on the dirty floor. He pulls his knees to his chest, rests his head on his knees and he cries. And he cries. And he cries.
"What's Draco got to do with this?" He asked, narrowing his eyes.
"What if they don't?"
Draco closes his book and immediately does. He stands and waits sheepishly for Harry's next order.
"No one is finishing anyone." Kingsley commands.
"Draco, it's you I want. Not sex. I can stay satisfied with my own hands. I'm not going to go to anyone else or force you. It's you I want, my love. We'll go further according to your time and your pace. I'll tell you again. It's you I want. The sex is a bonus. I'll stay with you forever even if I don't get sex, ever." Harry tells Draco.
Draco's face is burning. He knows that Potter knows what. He blushes.
"Thank you." Draco cut the call.
"Well, there's not much I can tell you. Have you tried searching for him elsewhere?"
Harry, with a skip in his steps, walked inside Grimauld Place. With a goofy grin, he walked towards his room, onlh to be stopped in the kitchen.
"Of course love."
"Why, why have y-you got me-me here? I want t-to go home." Spine asks.
Harry was in similar situation.
"Listen, I have no interest in what happened to them and who did what. What I care about here is Draco and unless whatever you want to talk about is not related to Draco being the victim then I'm not interested. It is time for his medicines. Please leave."
Next morning, during breakfast, they all sit together. They all get owls and Pansy gets a mail.
A tear left Belle's eye and she with shaky hands took Andromeda Belle in her arms. She gave a warm smile and sobbed a little. This little girl had white blonde hair, just like Luna. She kissed the little baby's forehead and smiled at Draco and Harry. At that moment, everything was warm and happy.
Draco wakes up after what feels like hours. His head is pounding and his body hurts. He slowly opens his eyes to see Potter sitting on his bed, looking at him through his glasses and vibrant green eyes. Too green to be looking at when you feel like death and hangover.
"Yes." Darien replied.
"Draco." Harry replies, his voice breaking.
Draco's POV
His magic makes him remove the joggers and waits for other instructions. It doesn't come. Instead, Potter walks towards him and picks him up bridal style. Potter walks him in the bedroom, places him on the bed, lays down besides him and just holds him. He relaxes in Potter's arms, closes his eyes and smiles as he feels Potter stroke through his hair with one hand and his back with another. Nothing about this is sexual. Its just that. A dominant and his submissive, together in a loving embrace. Boyfriends together. That's it. And Draco breathes. He chuckles as he feels Nura fixes herself in between them, feeling left out.
"I really don't understand, Harry. How could you do this to us for that fucking death-eater. He almost killed me!" Ron yelled.
"I thought we would be together." He said to Blaise.
"Narcissa, I need to know what stops you from being free. You could've killed Lucius. Why didn't you?" Harry asked.
"He kissed you, didn't he?" Blaise asks finally and Draco blushes more.
Draco is gonna have fun.
"And I almost killed him, in much more painful way. Yet he never complained once!" Harry yelled back.
"And why is that?"
This was it. Draco was a skilled occlumence and legilimence. And this lesson was an insult to him and his mother who taught him occlumency. He stood up and the class quiet down. He packed his bag and prepared to leave. Just as he walked three steps, the professor stopped him.
"If you'll are calling Neville then you have to call Hanna Abbot." Belle says excitedly. We all look at her confused. She sighs and explains. "Neville likes Hannah. He's completely head over heels for her. And I have a good feeling that Hannah might like him too. Maybe this could be a chance for them to get together."
We reached St Mungo's and they led us to a morgue. Aunt Romie lay on a table lifeless. I couldn't stop myself. I held Teddy and cried. Harry held us and cried as well. After a few minutes of crying, I payed the people at St Mungo's and they settled Aunt Romie in a box.
"You were wonderful." Harry smiled softly.
"Good morning gorgeous." Harry says as he opens his eyes and sees Draco staring up at him, still in his arms.
"So they're in prison. I bet that one murdered someone." Draco points at a panda that's laying down and chewing a bamboo stick.
Astoria looks up and stares Harry dead in the eyes.
Harry laughed. Ron was so pure and so uncomfortable with their ways. Still he was standing there with Harry. Hopping along with them like the loyal friend he was. Bringing Hermione was actually a good idea. She could be vicious in terrifying ways.
"Well, technically its Hogwarts's thi-"
"No. A little birdie told me that Draco Malfoy was one of the little boys who went through the bad fate. Word is around that Lucius Malfoy was one of the top sellers who sold young Mr Malfoy in return for favours. Draco Malfoy gets hurt, you get revenge."
"I have a letter for you and you only. From Narcissa Malfoy." He replies.
Harry groans and sits on the edge of the bed with a dramatic sigh.
"I do." Belle blushed at the name of Blaise. "But I need to know that I will be okay if the secret was out by accident or I have been given veritaserum."
"None. We need to wait a few weeks before we attack them. I'm sure Lucius knows that we're here and now that he doesn't have Spine, he'll get paranoid. So we need another scum bag not related to Lucius to vanish so that he doesn't think it's a threat on him. Because if he figures it out, then it will put Narcissa and Teddy in danger." Ron explains.
"Is it because of what I said last night?" Draco asks hesitantly.
Pansy grins evilly and starts kissing Draco's face, ignoring Draco's protests.
"I was supposed to die anyway. And I never asked you to come. I specifically told you not to, time and again.  You came with me because you wanted to. You came because you were Harry Potter's so called best friend. Don't give me this bullshit, Ronald, just because you can't use my friendship anymore. I know the only reason you want me back in your life is because no one respects you two idiots who drove Britain's golden boy away." Harry replied furiously.
"You needed time, Draco, I understand. Just one owl saying you'll talk when you're ready, to give you a few days, that's all you had to send. I was worried sick. I just saw you there, breaking apart, crying hysterically. I don't know why and I just didn't know how I could help. Don't ever do that to me again."
"I don't know sign language that well. I only started to learn it yesterday." He said slowly.
Draco clears his throat.
"Draco what-" Nott says but is cut off as Malfoy climbs his bed and throws himself over Nott.
"Remove the joggers." Potter says and Draco obeys, because how can he not.
"You went behind my back, Draco." Harry says as he pulls back from the kiss.
"Would you like to play?" Harry asks and Draco nods.
"Some bullshit about it being a secret weapon my father spewed about."
"No, Draco, no. Do not apologize. You're at no fault here." Harry tries to reassure Draco.
"He did. After father's failure in the Department of Mysteries, he was angry. To punish my father, he gave me the task to kill Dumbledore. Which he knew was impossible for me to do so. I was meant to fail so that I can be killed but I tried to prolong it as much as I can so that I can find a way to take my mother away."
"76. 77. 78. 79. 80." Draco grins as Harry leans down to give Draco a kiss.
"McLaggen"
Draco's eyes was filled with unshed tears and soon enough he started laughing. He fell down on the floor, still clutching the crystal peacock in between his both palms. Tears finally flew, but he controlled the sobs and kept laughing, Harry doesn't know how. Harry picked him up and Draco immediately curled around Harry, nuzzling in him. Harry slowly massaged his hair, petting him just the way Draco likes it. After a few minutes, Draco's laughter subsided and he was quite for a long while.
"Oooh everyone are here." Pansy and Luna came from behind with their daughter, Catherine Lovegood-Parkinson.
"Who is this boyfriend of hers?" Pansy asks.
The cashier looks at me shocked. I feel my cheeks burning. "T ten galleons Sir." She says and stares at the bill. Does she thinks I won't be able to pay this?
"You can stay in these for now. In France, I'll arrange a proper nest for you to stay." Draco says as he pets Nura's head. "Potter! We still have a lot to pack." Draco calls out Harry.
"Also, you look really beautiful. I'm glad you liked my present." McGonagall smiled.
Zapping (e.g. elecric fly swatter)
Guys I'm freaking out! Come at the lake fast! Bellatrix hexed Red! Molly, Marlene and Dorcas are duelling with the Slytherins. Red is unconscious
He feels Draco inhale the breath of relief. He had realised early on his fear of abandonment. Being left hurt and alone. He never wants Draco to feel like that with Harry but Harry knows this is a slow process and will take some work on. He tells Draco to have some breakfast. Its one of the rules for Draco, to have three meals a day, even if in small quantity. He won't let Draco neglect his food and that is something Draco has been doing for quite some time now. He had noticed since the start of the year when he was observing Draco.
"Draco." Draco hears Potter's voice and freezes.
"Christian and I were never dating. He loved me and wanted me. I loved him too but not in a way he wanted me to love him." Draco replies and looks at Harry. "But, Harry, I do. I love him." Draco smiles.
He sits next to me and kisses Teddy's head. I do a quick cleaning charm on all of us. He wears his shirt and and I wear mine. We go down with Teddy in my arms for breakfast.
That is unethical
"Is that why we keep finding things we need? Like the bell peppers and onions yesterday? I just thought you brought them when you came back after meeting Nott and Bulstrode."
"Why didn't you ever heal them?" Harry asked as they lay in the dead of the night on the comfortable bed with just few candles illuminating the room. Harry was laying on the bed and Draco besides him, both of them on their backs while Draco had his head rested on Harry's shoulder. Harry had his hands catching both of Draco's and played with his fingers.
"Theo." Astoria replies.
"Its a risky job. How will you do it alone?" Pansy asks Belle.
"You've put me in a very embarrassing position, Darien. How could you do this? On our 20th no less." Draco's voice cracks.
After that dreadful speech of Snape, I drag myself somehow to the first class, that is unfortunately defence against the dark arts, or now as they call it, dark arts. Its all Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs today. I take my seat next to Melanie. She's a half-blood Hufflepuff. I give her a weak smile which she also weakly returns.
"Can I have one?" I ask. Ron and Mione hate me smoking but what they don't know won't hurt them.
Harry puts two fingers below Draco's chin and slowly tilts his head up. With Draco still laying in his arms, the position is a bit awkward. He does the wandless cleaning charm on both their mouths just as Draco likes, adjusts the position and pulls him in a sweet loving kiss. He tries to pour all his emotions in the kiss to show Draco that he isn't a burden. Never will be. To show Draco how much he loves him.
And as if Harry heard him, Harry tightens his hold even more on Draco. He pets Draco's hair and his back simultaneously. Until Draco passes out, exhausted.
"You don't have to if you don't want to." Harry still tells Draco, because you know, he's good like that.
Teddy grabs Draco's curly hair and pulls. Draco makes a sound of protest and Teddy laughs as he turns his hair to green colour. Draco chuckles. The laugh sounding foreign to himself. He doesn't remember how it feels to laugh. He hasn't since three years. Three terrible years the war took away from him. Just like they took away Teddy's parents. Draco knows he's to blame but he'll be damned if he lets remorse take over. He's done plenty things he shouldn't have, but he'll do them all over again in a heartbeat for his mother. Who else would if not him? Just like his mother tried to keep him safe, he tried for his mother. He knows many people in his position would do the same but right now they have someone to blame. To show that they are high and mighty. Right now Draco can list at least ten people in the Wizengamot who would've turned their backs to the wrong side of the war because it would benefit them. In fact they have done it. Draco's just one of those who came out the hardest to be blamed. He's a Malfoy after all. And Malfoys haven't done something that makes people embrace them with warmth. But for this child in Draco's arms, he's ready to do better. His life in some way have always been for others. It's been for his father's so that he can be the perfect pureblood heir. For his mother to keep her safe and secured as much as he can. A bundle of terrible burdens that no child should have.
Harry's eyes never left Draco once. Which is why he doesn't understand that why Charlie and Draco will look at each other like that. Draco is showing his emotions, something that is not just a numbing indifference. He looks at Neville who is avoiding Harry's eyes.
"What?" Harry asks return.
"Are all those scars-" I ask and she cuts me off.
Potter looks at Draco for a few more seconds and finally relaxes. He just gives a lazy swat on Draco's cock, which is red and swollen and hurts like bitch. Finally a tear rolls.
Harry looks at him and then looks back at the book.
McGonagall is furious. She gets all the students who were there during that time for interrogation. Every student's wands are checked. Belle and Blaise reach the hospital wing worried. Soon, Ron and Hermione, Neville and Hannah come there as well. Draco smiles as he looks that Pansy and Luna are coming hand in hand. The pair is as different as they can be. Pansy wears all dark colours and has black hair, while Luna has pastel aesthetics. They all waited there as McGonagall enters.
"Why would you get yourself a ban from coming here Hyde?" Astoria asks with feigned innocence.
"For now. It's just noon, pet. Once the zoo and lunch is done, I'll take you to any club you want. Maybe you can sing." Harry replies.
Harry stares at him. He really didn't know. When the fuck did this happen? And how is it that Malfoy knows but he doesn't that his friends, Neville and Luna are dating. He's been so wrapped up around Malfoy that he really didn't see what's happening around him. Welp. Now he'll just have to do better for his friends, won't he? He sighs and lays back down. They sit there in comfortable silence with each other's company. Harry smiles.
Harry stretched his hand and Nura wrapped herself on Harry. Harry cast silencing charms and wards then made sure that the Spine won't be able to get free. He left the celler and headed forward to their room but mid-way he met Ron.
"This is the receipt of the bakery you visited in France. The day after Duke Maurice Cartier was killed." Robards explained, like Harry didn't know that. Harry did but well, this is not something the cops have to know though.
