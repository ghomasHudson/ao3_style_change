“I’m not sure,” Malfoy stood up slowly and walked to the window. He took a few moments to stare out at the greenery. All those trees, he could easily get lost in them and no one would be able to find him. He’d be free, at peace, alone. Although, being alone was far from what he wanted, as he had been alone his whole life. There had been those first few years with Astoria when she made him feel whole again, but it wasn’t long before that dissolved, and he was left feeling alone again. For the first time in what he felt like his whole life, Malfoy felt like he could remove his mask to someone, and of course it would be just his luck that it was Potter.
“Malfoy, your father wants to see us. Both of us,” said Harry with nervousness in his voice. Malfoy froze, mid-sentence that he was writing. For a few moments, he didn’t move, he just stared down at the sheet of paper until his eyes went blurry. Then, he slowly looked up at Harry.
“There are some Healers that are going to be on trial today,” Lucius Malfoy said, cutting off a small bit of toast with his knife and fork. “They’ve been harbouring some Muggleborns.”
“I’m glad you think so,” repeated Malfoy, looking over to Harry nervously. It was almost as if Malfoy didn’t agree, which was peculiar, considering he’d spent so many years tormenting Hermione for her blood status.
“She does,” said Draco, avoiding eye contact but keeping his hand tight around Harry’s. “I told her a few months back. I have never been in love before, Harry. And then,
Harry turned on the spot, showing Malfoy the fit of the suit. He stood there, his arms crossed, his one finger trailing along his lips in thought. Malfoy continued to stare at Harry, his eyes watching him intently.
The two stared at each other for a good few seconds, and it seemed Harry’s kind eyes calmed Malfoy’s frantic ones.
“Have you told mum and dad?” George shook his head no. “Please do. They will want to help you. And tell your mind healer, too,” said Ron, taking hold of George’s hand and giving it a squeeze. “I’ll stay here tonight with you, okay?”
“I wish I could help you guys get out of this life,” sighed Ginny, sipping her butterbeer.
“I know,” replied Malfoy, handing the cash over to the woman before smiling and turning around, heading straight over to a seat in the window.
Everything was so neat and tidy, and the papers he was looking for sat on the desk. Part of him wanted to read them, but he knew that the Malfoys would find out somehow if he did so. Though, as his eyes peered onto the page as he grabbed it, he saw the words ‘Bankrupt’ on the top. Breath hitching in his throat, he turned the paper over so he couldn’t see the writing and headed back to Malfoy’s office.
“Do you seriously think, out of all the people in this manor, out of all the people I know, I’d choose
Harry wasn’t safe for very long.
“Is he here?”
Harry placed the cup of tea on the bedside table before sitting down on the edge of the bed. Draco didn’t move, didn’t even blink.
(Trigger Warning: mentions of suicide)
Draco definitely needed that right now.
“We will floo to the manor,” said the minister of the American ministry, “and there we can arrest him.”
“How are you feeling?”
“What if I can’t think of a happy enough memory?” asked Malfoy.
“I have an artefact,” replied Draco, walking confidently over to the counter and putting his hand in his pocket. Draco always made sure to walk with his chin in the air and taking big, long strides. Even in situations he feared the most, he never wanted to look weak. He’d done enough of that in his days at Hogwarts. Though he was known as the school’s bully, he was just as notorious for being a wimp. Every time something mildly frightening happened, he’d get Crabbe and Goyle to sort it out for him, or he’d run away.
“What is it you need from us, dear?” asked Mrs Weasley.
“Do you need anything?” asked Harry after a while of silence. He was unsure what to say to Malfoy, Harry had never thought he’d hear a vulnerable side of him.
“Oh, really?” answered Mr Borgin, using the cloth to pick up the ball and look at it closer. “How do you know?”
“Because of my father.”
“That’s unfortunate.”
“We need to get him inside,” instructed Narcissa, crouching down beside the body that still lay on the rocks. Harry slowly pulled Malfoy up, keeping him steady in his arms.
“Quick, lets go get dried off,” laughed Malfoy, looking at Harry, “before father catches us.”
“I don’t need to talk to anyone,” snapped Malfoy, looking up at Harry. “Everything is fine.” He quickly downed the rest of his whiskey. “I’ll leave you in peace. I’ll be at the bar,” he said, before getting up and walking over there, sitting himself down in front of Hannah. Harry watched him drink more whiskey, and he couldn’t help but feel bad.
“Yes, a few for you and a few for me,” Malfoy handed them over. Harry tried them on and ended up showing Malfoy the deep green tweed suit, knowing he’d like it due to the colour.
Harry had been following the wolf for twenty minutes. Gradually, the wolf was fading, and Harry feared that at any moment it would completely disappear. How it had arrived to him had Harry thinking Draco was injured, and where he was, Harry didn’t know. All he could do was follow the patronus, who’s light was becoming more and more dim.
“This is really peculiar,” said Mr Weasley, looking at the strands of ribbon that lay flat on the surface. “It’s very clever, Draco. Did you come up with it yourself?”
“I’m sorry,” muttered Malfoy, slowly sinking to the ground. “I had to get away.”
“I think I can do whatever the fuck I like, Potter,” there was venom in Malfoy’s voice. “I’m part of the most powerful family in the Wizarding world. Why shouldn’t I be able to do what I want?” Shaking his head, he ran a shaky hand through his white blonde hair before turning back around.
When he arrived, Malfoy was stood waiting for him. Without saying anything, Malfoy started walking towards Borgin and Burkes. Harry stayed close by his side, his wand tightly grasped in his hand, knowing this scene had a possibility of getting messy. Malfoy confidently strode into the Dark Arts shop, nodding to Mr Borgin as he entered.
“There is one more thing, Harry, and I really didn’t want to have to tell you,” Hermione’s voice trailed off as she refused to make eye contact with her best friend.
“Let me have a look at your ribs,” Malfoy attempted to change the subject, but Harry wasn’t having any of it.
“If you’re going to be seen with me in public, I won’t have you wearing butler clothes,” said Malfoy after those long moments of silence. He pondered through the clothes, looking at each one closely, as if it were a life or death decision for which he’d choose Harry to wear. Staying silent, Harry watched Malfoy pull out a robe, then put it back, before pulling out another one. They all seemed to look the same, thought Harry, and he didn’t know why Malfoy was so particular about it.
As he silently approached the doors, he heard a noise coming from inside the office. Instinctively his hand grasped at his wand in his jacket pocket, remembering back to the day Malfoy had nearly gotten injured by the men from the ministry. Slowly he crept further towards the door and carefully poked his head round. The sight he saw was something he wasn’t expecting.
Ron was already stood ready by the time Harry had arrived. Nodding their hellos once again, Harry stood next to Ron, stood up tall and kept his hands behind his back. The position they did every day.
“Ah, Mr Malfoy,” he said in his slimy voice, sending shivers up Draco’s spine, “how may I help you today?”
“Yes. He attempted to worm his nasty way back into the Wizarding World, as if we wouldn’t notice. Of course, we would notice. We are thinking of obliviating him,” Lucius sipped at his glass of water. Malfoy only nodded in response.
“Me too,” agreed Neville. “You guys were so good at being Aurors.”
Malfoy scoffed. “You, worried about me?” he almost laughed and shook his head, a few strands of blonde hair falling into his face as he did. “Unbelievable.”
George looked at Harry. “They’re never really gone, you know that. Everyone we lost in the battle, everyone before, everyone after. Sirius, Remus, Fred, your mum and dad. They’re not really gone,” George looked back out to the sunrise.
Since the argument, Malfoy and Harry’s relationship was strained. Whenever Harry saw him, there was a thick tenseness in the air, and Harry didn’t like it one bit.
“It’s getting bad again,” answered George. Harry noticed tears filling his eyes.
Malfoy’s thin figure swiftly made its way down the halls. Today he wasn’t wearing robes, he was wearing what Harry liked to think as a classic Draco Malfoy outfit, a black turtleneck sweater with a blazer. Every so often Malfoy would dress more casual for work around the office, specifically if he wasn’t expecting to see anyone or didn’t have any errands to run. This wasn’t common, though, as Malfoy was now extremely busy with dealing with everything his father left behind when he became the minister.
“That’s fine,” said Mr Weasley, “we can cast protection spells on it.”
“Be careful, Draco,” said Blaise quietly before sauntering off. Malfoy stared at the ground for a few moments, standing as still as he could. Then, all of a sudden, he stormed over to Harry and grabbed onto his arms and with a pop, they disapparated.
“What the bloody hell was that about?” whispered Ron, leaning closer to Harry.
George nodded in response. Their hands gripped together, comforting each other. Sometimes it felt as though George was the only person who could understand the pain Harry had been through, losing someone as close as a twin.
The workhouses were awful places to be. Slytherin Pure-Bloods ruled over them and tortured the wizards and witches who worked there. They’d work long, gruelling hours, with only one five-minute break in the middle to scoff a sandwich. Workhouse jobs ranged from printing papers, to making robes, to building things like furniture. Of course, the use of magic would be far easier, but the Pure-Bloods found it fun to force Muggleborns and Half-Bloods to complete these tasks as if they were Muggles themselves.
The golden sun peeked through a slice in Harry’s drawn curtains, shining onto his sleeping face. The warmth woke him up, and his green eyes looked around the room. Taking in his surroundings for the first time that day, Harry stretched his arms up and slowly sat. Another day at this job, that he hated.
“You have no idea, have you?” laughed Draco. “Who do you work for? Someone in the ministry?”
Malfoy looked back at him. For a moment, Harry thought he saw a twinkle in Malfoy’s eyes, a twitch at the corner of his lips. But it may have been Harry’s eyes playing tricks on him, as Malfoy’s face didn’t change. He just searched Harry’s, wondering what to say next, thinking carefully about the right words.
“I can’t do this, Harry,” he sobbed, putting his head in his hands and slid down the wall until he was sat on the floor.
But, instead of punishing him, Malfoy just chuckled. “I never suited red. Good thing I was sorted into Slytherin.” Without saying anything else, Malfoy began walking through the long corridors again, his smart shoes clicking along the shiny black floors. Harry quickly followed, the feeling of the cloak dragging behind him made him feel powerful. Especially with the deep red shade and the feel of the velvet against his hands. He attempted to switch off his brain telling him it was only temporary, that in a few hours he’d be giving the robes back, he will never actually be that powerful again. The last time Harry truly felt powerful was while he was battling Voldemort and won.
has to be,” he joked. Harry tried to look stern but couldn’t help the grin that tugged at the corners of his lips.
“You’re hiding so much from me. From everyone. Why?”
Opening the door, Harry felt his whole body freeze. He stared at the tall figure in front of him, not blinking, not moving. In front of him stood Draco Malfoy.
“Find the peace in the storm, Harry. Feel the rain beating down on you. Feel the freedom it gives you,” Malfoy looked at him, his face suddenly serious. “Let it remind you that you’re alive.”
“Well, isn’t this a surprise,” said Lucius as he stood, his hand firmly grasped onto the silver snake head of which his wand began.
He couldn’t stop thinking everything over. Thinking about how any moment now, Hermione could be forcefully taken away to go to the workhouses. How she must be living every second in fear, constant nervous butterflies fluttering around her stomach causing her to feel sick.
“What can I get you guys?” asked the lady behind the counter.
each other, Harry. I blamed you for
Then, he pointed to the sky. “You see that there?”
“You’ve always been so big headed, Harry,” she tutted, making everybody laugh. For those few hours, it felt like they were back at Hogwarts.
“Harry?” Hermione softly called, reaching across Ron to place a gentle hand on Harry’s.
“I work there full time now,” explained Harry. “Malfoy wanted me to be his personal bodyguard. So even on the weekends, there I am, stood outside that damn office.”
“Seamus? What’s wrong?”
Draco had really appreciated all of her efforts.
“Follow me,” Malfoy turned on his heel, not even looking back to see if Harry was following him. He knew Harry would be, and that annoyed Harry.
“What do you want?” asked Draco, his eyebrows knitting together in a frown.
“What are you two talking about?” came Malfoy’s voice from behind him. Harry knew not to react as Malfoy gave his backside a gentle pinch, before standing to the side of him.
Their hands were still linked together. After a long pause, Malfoy squeezed Harry’s hand gently. “We can help each other.”
“A very dangerous artefact,” Draco heard the door open behind him. He didn’t look around, but the sound of footsteps quietly making their way round the shop had him on edge. “When used, it releases sharp and poisonous spikes towards the victim,” said Draco.
“The reason Ginny and I broke up,” Harry hiccupped, “is because I stopped finding girls attractive. I want to be with boys.”
“It looks amazing,” breathed Harry, looking up to the floating candles. Warmth filled his stomach as he remembered back to the first time he ever saw candles float, the first time he’d ever stepped foot in Hogwarts. That was one of the last times Harry remembered being truly happy. The fear of Voldemort wasn’t there, he wasn’t even in the back of his mind, all he could think about was how excited he was to be a Wizard, to be at Hogwarts with people like him.
“I need us to.”
“Tiring,” Harry finally responded, grabbing a knife, and started to chop up a carrot after washing his hands. “All I do all day is stand outside Draco’s office with Ron unless it’s a meal, then I’m just serving them water or wine.”
“No,” he said. Nodding, Harry grinned at him, but his smile dropped when Malfoy didn’t look away. They continued to admire each other, before instantaneously Malfoy grabbed hold of Harry’s face. Their lips crashed together, teeth knocking together in passion, and their lips moved in perfect motion together. Sparks filled Harry’s body and the hair on his arms raised. He could taste the alcohol on Malfoy’s lips.
Raising Draco’s head slightly, Harry pressed the cup to his lips, letting the cold water enter Draco’s mouth.
“It’s hard not to be,” admitted Harry coyly, a small smile curling his lips as his cheeks reddened. He hated seeming weak in front of Malfoy, but Malfoy had been so open with him recently.
“No. I think Ron and Hermione suspected something was going on, but they don’t even know I ran away yet.”
“Please,” responded Harry. Mr Weasley got up and waddled over to the drinks table. He was looking much older these days, his ginger hair now completely white, wrinkles settled into his forever smiling face. It worried Harry, the thought of Mr Weasley dying. He didn’t know if George would be able to handle it.
After brushing his teeth, Harry had a hot shower. The water beat down on his shoulders, relaxing some of the tension he held there. His job was difficult, and it caused him a lot of stress and strain. But it paid the bills, very well in fact, and it kept him out of trouble, so leaving didn’t seem like a choice to him. It wasn’t something he could think about.
Pulling into a new dock, Harry clambered off the boat. Once again ensuring there were no muggles near, he put a cloaking spell on the boat, following that with a ward to make sure no one accidentally bumped into his invisible canal boat.
“Yes,” Gabrielle said, suspicious.
He would sacrifice no one else for his desire and freedom. Kirke had been a visceral reminder that men should
When Draco had taken his leave, Harry debated with himself for a while before deciding that the easiest thing to do would be to Apparate to Grimmauld Place. The sound did tend to draw attention, so Harry cast a muffling charm before he spun around.
"Oh yes," Sirius said, his face twisting again. "But she was his wife and Remus would not betray her.  He liked her very much as my niece, learned to love her as his wife.  Her death in the war was very hard for him.  The deaths of my parents and brother," Sirius' lips pulled back into a snarl, "were less hard for me."
"There is something I can try to brew," Hermione said at last. "It seems most likely that it might be a potion – there is nothing to suggest that you are under a particular incantation." Hermione knew as many spells to counter such incantations as her husband, who had been Head Auror for three years. Harry wished sometimes that his life might have allowed him to pursue a career in such a field, but he had responsibilities as the Black heir and it was unthinkable for him to enter a trade of any kind.
Their dinner was not so pleasant as those that had preceded it, and for the first night since they had begun living together, they did not make love.
“Were there any other strange things you noted while you worked in this suite?”
“If that is what you need, Draco,” he said, tired and hopeless and not enough, not quite ever enough to be what anyone he loved truly needed from him. “If that is what you want.”
"Mr Filch, always a pleasure," Malfoy said, entering the door. Harry swallowed hard, and when he looked up into expectant grey eyes, forced himself to follow.
~o0O0o~
Harry leaned to the side in order to dislodge Lucius’s hand and to meet his eyes. “You are not on that committee.”
in order to remind Harry of his place.
Harry wanted to step away but then Malfoy said, "Why shouldn't I? You choke down your very nature for her sake one minute and you want to seduce a boy in your care the next…"
Harry reached out to touch the furniture and the things of Draco's lying haphazardly around. Would it be too dangerous to keep even one?
Draco sighed. “This seduction was in fact the result of a very complicated scheme. I had to fight off numerous suitors for your favour.”
"What was most important to you when you were seventeen?" Draco asked.
Draco was waiting for Harry to turn back to meet his eyes when he finally did. “Don’t rise to it,” he said. “Father always wins.”
Harry was an invert. It made no sense – he loved Ginny, had loved her desperately in the beginning though it had since faded to a pleasurable sense of companionship. She understood him. She was beautiful. And yet, since she had begun to bear his children, he had sought the joys of the marital bed less and less frequently. He had been frustrated with himself and at the growing distance between them, not understanding where it had come from and now he could remember only the relief he had felt during their courtship, the joy of knowing that he was to be part of her family and create their own in turn.
Harry crumpled the letter in his hands. “Why did he send you?”
Ginny wrinkled her nose. "As though I have not heard the same from every Healer, every relative, every… everyone! Everyone has an opinion," she said, glaring at Harry as though he were responsible for all the evils of the world. "I
Ron and Hermione were godparents to both James and Albus, but Harry was certain they wouldn't be offended. "Lily Luna," he tried. The baby girl in his arms looked at him with her eyes bright and wide, and Harry felt everything in the world focus on her. "Perfect," he breathed, his eyes only for his daughter. "Ginny, she's perfect."
"If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other." Rage and love, fear and strength, wands and scars. Potter and Malfoy. Draco lowered his wand after a moment, a heartbeat long enough to ensure his point was made. "Beware what you try to keep me from. There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand."
He reeled back, clutching his face. When he straightened, Harry had found his wand and the two squared off.
“Thank you.” There wasn’t really much else to say except to ask, “So will you be my advocate?”
“Did he visit more than once?”
"While I thank the honourable gentlemen for returning our attention to this matter," she said, her tone sharp, "is it not the case that the ban exists because of the severe ethical concerns of the whole committee as to the possible applications of any such charm?"
“Thank you, Mr Potter,” Diggory said. “Now, Mrs Weasley, on the charge of gross indecency, would the accused like to enter a plea?”
“Probably not,” Pansy acknowledged, “but you’d be as well to head it off at the pass. Your most immediate threat, I’d expect, will be Charlie Weasley.”
Harry sat. “Two years,” he whispered.
“Pans?” he said, gazing blearily into the flames. “What d’you want?”
"The length of our stay is not yet determined," Harry said, his mind whirling. Malfoy was here? All the more reason to leave at once for home. But Harry was tired of making nothing but sensible decisions, tired of doing his duty, doing what was expected of him.
Playing host here in Harry’s space was not exactly helping. Harry gritted out, “Would you please give us a moment, Malfoy?”
“Perhaps you could see your way to lowering your voice? Mother is entertaining.”
Harry smiled sadly. "How much of who we are depends upon the world around us?"
Their conversation was halted by the arrival of the Pensieve. It was a larger version, intended to show the memory to the entire courtroom; Hermione muttered something about the spells on it as it was wheeled into place.
"What did he want, Harry?" Hermione asked.
table at the Bonnets. Malfoy, there's a brothel which specialises in caning.'"
Draco winced a little. He didn't seem to know where to look. "Not- not frequent, per se," he said at last.
There were some strange blanks in Harry's fantasies. He wasn't sure what two men would do together. he knew that it was Malfoy's face he saw before him most every night. In the dreams, Malfoy had replaced Ginny in that hotel bed and Harry ran his hands over acres of pale chest instead of freckled curves.
Sirius’s shoulders slumped in relief.
“I know the Weasleys have a party coming up soon,” Draco went on. He didn’t but it was a fair bet with all those birthdays. “I was so hoping to be there, maybe in something you’ve made, and…”
The concierge was understanding of Harry’s complaints, though he apparently had no notion that there had been unexpected visitors. Harry could hardly be surprised: although he had chosen a Muggle establishment for the sake of discretion, it had come with a number of compromises on security – there were dozens of ways for a wizard to slip past even the most eagle-eyed of Muggles.
If he’d meant to escape he would have done it instead of walking into the DMLE that day, not after. Still, the squalor of the cell made him regret his decision. It had seemed like the right thing to do – to face his choices and answer for them, but that did not make the rotten food more palatable or the stone floor softer.
Their private joke. “It was very kind of you to come in person,” Harry managed. His whole life felt poised on the edge of destruction as he glanced between the two people who had meant the very most in his life.
“No,” Harry said, pulling off his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose in a vain attempt to ward off a headache. “I mean – I knew it was adultery and wrong. But it seemed like the furthest thing from a crime. When I was with him, it was beautiful.”
~o0o~
Sirius sighed deeply. Harry wondered if he had managed to drink himself sober. “Nonetheless, Harry, you must give him up.”
She was clever so he silenced her, quick and ruthless before he sent her flying into the air.
“Yeah,” Draco said. After all, it had been, and if Potter had given him that, the least Draco could do was give Potter’s self-esteem a little shine.
"And did you see that Starfish and Stick!" Ginny was saying. "Hopkirk was in such an amazing position, perfectly balanced in the air…"
He and Draco barely touched for a fortnight. They had always managed to make this room their sanctuary and Draco had fondly imagined they could force that sanctuary out, change the world around them. Instead, it was as Harry had feared: the real world was closing all around them. Something was about to break.
The moment he was gone, Draco threw back his head and laughed. "Potter, that was an absolute scream. Did you see—"
"Lord Malfoy," Harry returned. He had always felt wrong-footed by this man, always. He turned instead to Narcissa. "Lady Malfoy."
"You shouldn't have," Harry tried, "you shouldn't have done this," but he was kissing Draco too.
Draco's eyes glittered but his voice was soft. "Be careful what you say, Potter."
"Hermione," Harry said and his chin jerked up, daring Draco to say a word against her.
Harry kissed him, couldn't help it, kissed him again. "I wish I had a whole day with you," he said, unable to believe that he was daring. "I wish I could spend whole hours looking at you. Touching you."
When Draco approached the table, Gabrielle scowled. “So zis is why you inseest on meeting me today, Panzy?” she said.
“I know. I know, boy,” he said, for Fawley’s benefit. “I miss you too. But you’ll be somewhere beautiful where people will look after you. And I want you to be there, do you understand?”
Draco had the unsettling feeling that this was about to run away from him. “Look I didn’t… not remember, I just didn’t remember and I know that sounds the same, but it’s not!” Damn it, Draco was smooth! Why did it always desert him when he needed it most?
The sounds Draco made, however, encouraged him and he slid his finger inside, just a little, just to the first knuckle. It slid inside so easily, as though the way had already been moistened and prepared.
He was alone most every day but he still felt stifled by the very presence of his wife and in-laws. He imagined Ron occupied with work, Hermione with her causes, Dean and Seamus busy with their estates, everyone with something to do, someone to talk to, and he wondered how he had ended so trapped, so unfulfilled. There had to be something more, something that Harry could grasp that would make him feel more than this endless emptiness and urge to escape from it all. Would he become as Sirius was, filling the hollow inside himself with drinking and gambling? Would he become like Malfoy instead?
"And do you not find pleasure when I use my fingers on you? What makes you think that you would find no pleasure in this?"
Harry turned and ran.
with him?
Groaning, Harry freed his own cock at last and pulled Draco's hips back to meet his. What a sight they must make, Draco naked with his clothes discarded on the table and chairs, Harry fully clothed with only his cock free, slowly sinking deep into that beautiful body.
“No, he took out his wand.”
"In any case," Teddy went on, "there are many other things to talk of on an evening such as this."
Harry brooded on that a little as he made his way to the Atrium. One end was devoted to fireplaces for those travelling into and out of the Ministry. At the other, beyond the ever-unnerving Fountain of Magical Brethren, was a dining hall which Harry had visited before, but not often. The space appeared to be letting natural light through from above though Harry was certain that must be a charm given how the Ministry was put together. Numerous plants hang in charming baskets from various points at the ceiling and Harry’s half-remembered Herbology lessons told him they were all edible, although some had scents intended to increase the appetite. The effect when combined with the shimmering spots of gold light reflected from the fountain was light and airy and most pleasant.
"Any like this?" Harry made himself ask. "Any with whom you would spend your days and nights? Any others with whom you have lived?"
"The potion is ready," Hermione said, stepping quietly into the room.
"It has not been an easy time for either of us," Ginny said to Harry one day.
"I know," Harry sighed. "But you know other means are unsafe for you in this delicate condition." The possibility of an error in the Floo existed, no matter how many safeguards were in place, and no one wanted to imagine what would happen should an expectant mother splinch herself.
Harry steeled himself through dinner that night and after for the usual chatter between Molly and Ginny about the children and the treatments. Arthur would have been a pleasing addition to the party but he too had had to work, his position at the Ministry not allowing for long impromptu holidays and so Harry had to sit while the ladies virtually ignored him in their conversations.
Before he left, Sirius told him, "Meet me at the Ministry building tomorrow at ten; you can sit in the public gallery and observe. Not much interesting legislation, but perhaps a refresher course on to whom some of the faces belong - the ones that aren't constantly in the papers."
Harry had never liked him. He hated that this man was here for this, that he’d been quicker than Sirius’s attempts to save them both.
Malfoy turned, a little confused. His eyes widened. "
Harry fell silent. His head was whirling: Sirius had said so much against the Malfoys that Harry had missed something obvious – why was he so relatively sanguine about the fact that Harry was engaged in sodomy? As Sirius glared at him, the quiet got Harry’s mind ticking and he reached a conclusion so obvious that it must be correct and Harry could only berate himself for not seeing it sooner.
"Lord Potter," Lucius said, his voice curling around the words with just a hint of sneer.
. He had enjoyed his marital relations, had found pleasure in Ginny's embrace, but had never known desire like this. As Draco rubbed against him, lining up their two cocks and thrusting, Harry felt crescendos and conflagrations, as though his very being would ignite and meld completely into Draco's. Or perhaps they would both be lost to the fires and it wouldn't matter because it would feel like this forever and always.
Harry acknowledged the warning with a raise of his teacup by way of salute.
Harry smiled sadly. "Perhaps he could."
Draco's whole body was taut as a bow string as he arched into Harry's body, his hips jerking, his hard cock rubbing against Harry's hip again and again, continually seeking a better angle, more contact between their two bodies. At last, with a snarl of frustration, Draco surged upright, flipping them over so that Harry was beneath him.
Strengths: Sexy, experienced, grasp of advanced strategy, fabulous hair, snappy dresser, smooth, sophisticated, in control.
"Your tune has changed in recent years," said a silky voice suddenly from behind Malfoy. Harry had not even noticed that there was anyone else there: Malfoy had seemed to demand all the focus Harry was capable of giving.
"Darling," she said, an endearment she used but rarely, "we already have our happiness, do we not?"
"At times it has not been," Teddy agreed, "but Grandmother is always invited."
Hermione had gripped his shoulder a moment too long when she'd kissed his face in greeting, her expression clearly asking,
“Did it seem like a crime? To you?”
Harry chewed his lower lip. "You think that day will come?"
“Of course I will, Harry. But if all of this is true, I don’t know what chance you have at trial.”
Harry made for the robe he had hung by the door but Draco stopped him. "Are you cold?"
"I'm looking forward to seeing the children," Harry said. "And Ginny." Would she speak with him at all, Harry wondered. Would she be angry or contrite? The Ginny he had married would have lambasted him but he didn't know the woman she had become.
“You could resign, I suppose,” Sirius said. “But that would give credence to any talk already existing. You could go home to Ginny.”
"Of course," Harry said, smiling. "It would be a pleasure. A change, certainly, to spend time with a baby girl."
Narcissa was now scowling at her husband. "Lucius, please," she said, forcing a laugh which Harry was sure she had intended it sound like a trilling bell rather than the sound she produced: sharp, with the edges of a serrated blade. "What must the Potters be thinking of us?"
Harry gave a choked sound and raised his head. "I left early," he said, truncating the truth and hating himself for it.
Ron and Hermione stayed for four days. Most of Hermione's time was spent with Ginny, whom Ron had visited briefly. Despite the affection between brother and sister, Ron was not terribly good with women at times like these and was extremely relieved to leave Ginny to his wife and spend the days in the drawing room with Harry. Dinner each evening was a livelier affair than Harry had enjoyed for many weeks, and that evening Ginny even managed a glimmer of her old vivacity.
"Just like you always wanted."
“I didn’t exactly appreciate your attempts to force me to stay last night,” Harry returned. He had not forgotten.
As it happened, Harry did not have time to dwell on the disturbing spectre of Lord Draco just then; his brother-in-law and old friend Ron Weasley had come to town. Harry had been eagerly anticipating the visit, certain that Ginny would enjoy the company of Ron's wife Hermione, a dear friend to both of them. He felt a little sorry for Morag, to whom the task of looking after their baby daughter Rose in addition to the boys would fall; Hermione could never bear to leave her daughter behind when they travelled.
It was terribly gauche of him, he knew, to think of how much these kinds of luxuries would cost, but it brought home to him again the wealth and power of the Malfoy family. His trepidation increased tenfold.
It was strange; the afternoon had gone much better than Harry could possibly have imagined. Lucius had almost seemed to – well, not approve per se, but to have a grudging respect for Harry by the time the tea was over. Yet Draco had barely forced out a monosyllable. Harry knew the discussion of children had to have been what upset him but this reaction was extreme to say the least.
“That might be worth considering.” Sirius had been fidgeting for several minutes on the other side of the room.
“You think I do not see?" Harry spat back at him.  "You think I do not see the way you are with Remus, he a widower, you a 'confirmed bachelor'?  You think I do not understand what he is to you?  That is how Draco is to me!"
Draco sighed. “He is not wrong there. But what can he do beyond what he has already done?”
Remembering Draco's words that afternoon, Harry pulled away for a moment, the lightning of desire bringing him to full alertness. He pushed his own index finger into his mouth and make it wet. He returned Draco's cock to his mouth and reached back, his finger finding the entrance to Draco's body with ease, teasing lightly, still hesitant to commit this most intimate act.
“On one occasion sir, he struck me.”
Harry remembered the way he’d crossed the room, the way Draco’s body had felt beneath his fingertips. There was no denying it now.
“I’m sure,” Draco snorted.
"Well," Sirius said, "I will spare you the details.  There was a great deal of confusion on both sides – anger, denial, pain, heartbreak, before we finally admitted to ourselves and each other that we needed one another."  Every word seemed to cost Sirius a tiny part of himself.  He seemed to shrink as he told Harry, "We kept it a secret.  No one knew – your parents suspected, I think, but they never pried and they never treated us differently.  I could not have made it through my adolescence with my parents if I had not had Remus."
He tried working off the excess energy through exercise, attending fencing practice regularly. But then one day the dark-skinned man with whom he had seen Malfoy talking at the opera appeared – Zamboni, was it? – and Harry did not dare go back.
“Uncle Ron said he’d read to me from
Draco’s lip curled. “Fine, Harry. Let me just say, I have slept with considerably more than four people, and that right there? That was the fuck of the year. Maybe the decade.”
“Job? How plebeian of you to ask. Just answer me this – you intend to be a fashion designer, correct?”
"Draco," Harry began, a pleading note entering his voice, but Draco brushed past him and out the door.
"I am well, Harry," Teddy replied, a radiant smile on his face. Following the direction of his gaze. Harry's eye lit on Bill and Fleur standing with their children around them.
If Harry took any of those things it would be like taking a part of Draco with him. A clean break would be better, he was certain.
Draco yawned. "Perhaps a little. I should so very much like to show you off," he said with a smile.
"Indeed," Draco said. "We had quite enough of that at school, I said to him. Perhaps it was not the same outside of Slytherin."
"Potter," Draco gasped. "Potter, oh, Acheron and Lethe, what are you…?"
o0O0o
"Capital!" Sirius beamed. "It's decided!"
"I thought it best to have enough for more than one dose," he said honestly.
“Don’t apologise to the bum boy,” Smith said scornfully.
"I would have wished to be an Auror," Harry said, carding his fingers through Draco's hair. "If I had the choice of any profession."
Harry slept badly, as had become his habit. It was strange not having Draco near him, even if he had been sleeping on the other side of the bed lately, stranger still to be back in Sirius’s house where he had in recent years most usually stayed with Ginny.
A memory of an incident whose significance Harry had long denied rose now from the dark recesses of his mind to taunt him; he shoved it away violently.
“None of those people are Draco!”
"Are you sure you will not accompany me?" Sirius said for what felt like the hundredth time. "You have seemed quite out of sorts for weeks."
Draco shied away from the topic at once. "It does not signify. Keeping up appearances is the condition of survival in this world, at this time. So I go to lunch with ladies and then I have beautiful boys suck my lobcock. And someday I will throw the lie they make me live in all their teeth."
"That's not what I was going to say!"
"You were so excited tonight," said Harry quietly. "It was wonderful."
Silencing spell, petrifying spell, nonverbal. Draco didn't trust himself to speak.
“For me?” Harry still did not quite understand.
Sirius' eyes narrowed. "I know that you have not been quite yourself in the wake of Ginny's complications," he said, "but there is very little point in your having come to town at all if you do not present the baby to society."
A sharp sound emerged from Malfoy's throat and he pressed himself back eagerly. And that was as much as they could manage – Harry pressed into Malfoy and Malfoy pressed into Harry and their hips thrust against one another. Malfoy moved away for a split second in order to realign their lower bodies and then Harry's cock was against Malfoy's own and even through layers of fine muslin the sensation made Harry desperate. He reached at last for Malfoy's shoulders and explored his back, pushing Malfoy's jacket aside. Malfoy responded by pinching Harry's nipple; it sent a bolt of pleasure clean through him and then without warning Harry thrust one final time and felt the world explode into heat, Malfoy only moments behind.
Hermione eyed Harry askance. "Ron, would you mind fetching my bag? I believe I left it in the other room."
Harry steeled his resolve and reached down to cup Draco's cock. Draco groaned and clutched again at Harry's face; Harry for his part found that he rather liked the heat and weight in his hand, and the sounds he could elicit from Draco by varying the pressure.
Harry was staring at the ceiling, to take a break from his usual occupation of staring at the walls. He had expected prison to be many things but even more dull than committee meetings had somehow failed to make the list.
Harry began to lift his napkin from his lap when Lucius’s hand came down on his shoulder. “No need to get up,” Lucius purred. “I merely wished to greet my son and of course to let you know how much I look forward to working with you on the Committee for Muggle Relations.”
“I am not a house-elf,” Blaise retorted. “I am here to show you something I think you need to see. I know all about you and Draco, which I imagine does not surprise you?”
Harry watched himself enter the room in his coloured clothes. "What exactly was that about, Malfoy?" His voice sounded harsh in a way he hadn’t meant to make it at the time.
“Dominic,” said the voice, though it could have been Dominique and frankly Draco didn’t really care that much.
"More than one," Draco said. "More than one. I want a row of beautiful arses and I want to fuck them all."
“To bury the hatchet?”
His father was narrow-minded. That was a gross understatement. He had only ever seen idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. He had failed Draco repeatedly.
~o0o~
Malfoy climbed in after him, closing the door and issuing a sharp, "Drive on!" The carriage lurched into motion. Harry could not bring himself to look at Malfoy now, and stared blindly out into the gas-lit streets until abruptly the blind was pulled down in front of him.
Draco declined to change for the occasion – most unlike him, the peacock who had colours for every occasion. This more even than the dead look in his eyes told Harry that he had been truly disturbed by the scene with his father. Harry swallowed his objections to the plan and breathed slowly, reminding himself that he had chosen Draco and chosen to make this sacrifice for him.
The opera was not one with which he was familiar and though he did not speak Italian, the translation charm kept him abreast of the story. Don Giovanni murders the father of a woman he had sought to seduce, and she and her fiancé swear revenge. Meanwhile, a woman Don Giovanni rejected tries to induce him to renounce his wicked life, protecting him out of misplaced affection.
The impulse passed. The difference here was that Harry was guilty.
"Only this. You are a hypocrite.”
When she looked up again he saw in her expression the steel that had been there before the Battle for Hogwarts. "My family are divided," she began. "Some would have me dissociate myself from you at once, some would see me stand by you. Lord Malfoy pretends sympathy and says that if need be he will see the very law of the land changed so that I may divorce you."
Ginny's expression softened again. "Yes, of course, Harry."
It was a promise.
At this, Draco turned to him fully. “Never that, Harry,” he said softly. “But you know as well as I that we see things differently. This is important to me.”
“Fine,” Draco snarled, righting himself and making for the door. “Do as you please. You always do.”
What was Lucius
Kreacher scuttled out of the room.
"You barely contributed three sentences to the conversation," Ginny pointed out.
Mimicking Malfoy again, Harry sat. Malfoy spared Harry a sly smile as he undid his cravat and pulled off his waistcoat, discarding them on the floor behind him. Bertram returned to Malfoy as Harry fidgeted; Malfoy smiled as Bertram stepped between his legs and slid a hand down Malfoy's chest, casually parting his shirt to reveal his pale chest. Bertram had his back to Harry but Harry could still see him snake his hand lower, rubbing the heel of it over Malfoy's manhood, his fingers curling further back and beneath as Malfoy spread his legs wider.
“If they are who I pointed to,” Draco said flatly. He had already begun to shrug out of his coat.
"When we were first married," Harry said. "I know… I knew it was something you wanted."
"What, then?" Draco asked sharply. "How many others have there been?"
Teddy frowned. "When did you send it?"
And it was. Ron and Hermione, George and Angelina, Percy and Audrey, Bill and Fleur: the only one missing was Charlie, who made it back from Romania so rarely, and of course Fred, whose loss in the war was a scar in the family that never fully healed.
At this point Hermione stood. “Minister, I object. What is the relevance here?”
The Resurrection Stone took pride of place on the walnut sideboard in the corner of the room; Draco would have liked to wear it as a ring, of course, but the idea made Harry uncomfortable.
Apparently that satisfied Potter, as he withdrew his fingers and lined himself up against Draco’s body.
Indeed, he had rather expected to see a colleague or two, but not Lucius, Lord Malfoy.
"Not that I can recall," Harry said, his throat tightening. He would wonder later why he had lied.
"I say," a voice from the door drawled. "That was a little violent, Potter."
"What is—" Draco began, but then the Patronus began to speak in Sirius' voice.
“What if,” Draco began, and his voice sounded far away, thoughtful. “What if we could convince him that our relationship could benefit him in some way.”
“Potter,” the Minister said. “A word?”
Harry looked away from them and up to the public gallery. It was half-empty now but some familiar faces had stayed. Bill and Fleur waved to him sadly. Luna blew him a kiss. Neville did nothing but stand there, quiet and strong. And Ron had come now. His heartbreak was large on his face and Harry could only look back and shrug, almost helplessly. This is where all his defiance had brought him.
Draco sighed and walked over to his bed, taking his shirt off as he went. Blaise was still out, probably shagging Granger in a closet somewhere. Maybe not. He was never sure when it came to those two. Blaise was kinder around her, better. But right now, he just wanted to talk to his friend.
_________
"Does that answer your question?" He asked softly.
"Compromise?" Echoed a skeptic Draco.
Harry Potter was holding Draco Malfoys hand. And it wasn't that bad. Harry's hand was a little clammy because he was nervous but Malfoy's icy hand held tight in a comfortable way, their fingers laced together and little space between their hands.
Draco however was confused. Last night was a blur. He remembered drinking and drinking everything after that was fuzzy.
Their kiss was slow, sweet and long. Full of the unspoken words between them. They explored eachother softly, Draco's hand finally making it to Harry's hair. Harry's hands resting on Draco's shoulder and back.
He had thought too quickly. The second he walked into Three Broomsticks with Potter hot on his heals, he saw three people he absolutely did NOT want to see. Blaise, Pansy, and Granger. Who of course saw them the second they came in. Granger stood up and ran over to Har- Potter, the two whispering to each other in a very animated conversation. He couldn't quite catch what they were talking about but he could care less as he walked over to Blaise and Pansy. The former watching Granger with admiration.
Things just felt better. Ron felt more alive and honestly he owed it to the tiny little blonde he was currently hugging.
"Obviously you've never been there Malfoy, otherwise you'd realize it's far from useless. They have loads of stuff that comes in handy. Give it a shot."
“Harry—” Hermione blurted.
Kirke hesitated. “No. It turned up at the house; I assume he left it there but I do not know who for.”
Sirius snorted. “Of course I could hide nothing from you.” He hesitated. “I have – that is to say, the Black family has – a villa on Lake Garda, near Verona. It would seem precipitous, perhaps, but not suspicious if we were to remove ourselves there.”
Draco tipped Harry's chin up and studied his face. "You really mean that," he said in a tone of mild surprise. "Don't you."
Gabrielle’s cupid’s bow mouth curved into a half-smirk. Someone less self-consciously ladylike would have snorted. “And why would you consider that you and I are on those terms?”
"Ginny does most of the hard work," Harry objected.
And yet everything here now reminded him of Draco. His purple pocket square had been used to mop the sweat from his Draco's face as he writhed beneath Harry, and still carried his scent. Cravats had been untied with Draco's nimble fingers. The chaise longue had been the site of many acts of coupling. The room was saturated with him.
have him, Harry thought with a mutinous determination he had not felt since his brief rebellion at the age of fourteen. I shall.
"If you have taken any other potions at all," Hermione warned, "it will counter all the effects."
“Meet our four champions,” Pansy smirked. “Who will make it to the prize?”
Harry crossed the space between them, the now-familiar rush of intoxicating lust taking over. He reached for Draco's hand and placed a kiss almost like a bite to his wrist.
Draco shrugged. "The world is the way it is. Pureblood numbers dwindle, the number of half-bloods increases and the mudbloods shall inherit the wizarding world after they have bled all the old ways out of it."
They all called out to him, all but Ron who seemed to be using all of his strength to offer his best friend a last smile while he held back his tears.
“Well said, Draco,” said a voice from behind Harry, who closed his eyes against the inevitable. Naturally, Lucius would see fit to interrupt their lunch.
Blaise reached out a hand to stroke Draco’s cheek. “Of course you are, Draco,” he said softly. “Who could resist your full charm?”
Harry was not amused by this display at all. "So you kept me waiting for two hours because you were playing at cards? I have been sitting waiting for you all that time – why? Because it amused you to make me wait?"
Without meaning to, Harry had begun to thrust against Malfoy's thigh still lodged between his own. The friction was divine and Harry actually pulled away from the kiss to gasp.
“Do I take it from this that you have broken with him?”
Harry flinched, feeling for all the world as though Draco had struck him. "Draco, I would be back in January..."
Harry did not return to his suite –
"Let me," said Kirke. Harry nearly started – he had forgotten that Kirke was even there. But now the boy reached for Harry's cock, rubbing it through the fabric and Harry could resist his arousal no longer. He had instinctively reached to stop Kirke, but his hand fell limply back onto the chaise. Malfoy was gasping now, Bertram's head bobbing up and down faster. All that skin on display, all that chest, the shoulder where the shirt had fallen away. Sculpted collar bones cast shadows into the hollows they created. Malfoy was perspiring and the fine sheen of sweat made Harry itch to run his tongue over that skin, collect all that evidence of desire and keep it for himself.
The hands Harry had raised automatically to steady Malfoy had somehow become entangled in his cloak; Harry held handfuls of Malfoy's clothing and really wished for nothing more than to have it fade away and find the freedom to run his hands over the flat planes of Malfoy's chest. For now he explored the heretofore undiscovered country of Malfoy's back as the kiss went on and deepened, Harry now meeting every thrust of Malfoy's tongue with his own, following it back into Malfoy's mouth when it had the temerity to retreat. Malfoy's hands moved from the back of the carriage to Harry's shoulders; Harry's mouth moved to do what he had longed to before and charted the length of Malfoy's long, beautiful throat.
"I would wish for many things," Harry said with a sigh. "Though we are blessed, in our way."
Draco stood alone. "You have never managed to love me, Father, and now at last I give up trying to make you."
"Master Potter!" Harry was met with at once.
“My apologies, madam. Mr Kirke,” Lucius said, exaggerating his tone, “did you ever see Mr Potter there?”
"Harry?" Sirius' face was full of concern. "Harry, at last! I quite feared for you. Ginny told me you were staying at a Muggle hotel?"
"As indeed Harry has a standing invitation to our home, though he doesn't often choose to visit us," said Ron from behind Harry.
"Oh, Potter and I have already met," he said airily.
"Yes," Draco said, resolute. "I am."
“Noted, and, I presume, excepted?”
“And do you not have independent connections? Independent of him, I mean.”
"But I'd wager she makes it just as hard on you." Seeing Harry grow still, Sirius went on, "All women do, from what I understand."
of my wife."
How's everyone doing this Monday? Me, I'm still super embarrassed about messing up the posting order. Welcome new readers and anyone sticking with me through the oops.
“Your in-laws, of course, are not so lucky,” he said and Harry’s breath caught.
The shield charm took the brunt of it, but Harry lashed back as a cut appeared on his chin; Draco had aimed the curse at his chest and only part of it had struck him. Harry touched the sore spot and came away with bloodied fingers. He stared at Draco in shock. Draco seemed frozen to the spot.
“You think there is anything he wants more than for you to marry and give your name an heir?”
The heat was building, building, as Potter thrust into him again and again, his expression every bit as dazed with desire as Draco felt, and then like lightning down the spine Draco cried out again and felt hot come spurt out of him, covering his and Potter’s stomachs.
"I thought Lily, or Molly," Harry said. "Perhaps both?"
. Harry looked at the empty space where he had been, then buried his face in his hands.
He reached out then instinctively to touch Draco's face. Humans are such tactile creatures and impulses born of habit and experience are not easily discarded. But Harry's hand could not touch Draco now, would never be able to touch Draco again and it drew a strangled cry from his throat.
The Weasley family arrived first, of course. So many of them all at once and Harry remembered how much he had in turn loved and looked up to them all, the family he had always wanted to be part of.
Harry’s eyes widened in alarm as the dirty, dishevelled owner of the brothel where he’d had his first same-sex experience shambled in and vowed to tell only the truth.
Draco glared.
He wanted Malfoy. Much as it shook him to admit it to himself, he wanted Malfoy to touch him again, just as he had in the Hogs Head. He wanted Malfoy over and over again, wanted to make him come apart, soften that sneer into a look of pure desire.
“Three days ago?” Draco said dangerously.
"Kreacher," Harry said and the house elf appeared at once. "I believe we will have a guest for dinner."
"A discourse on the subject of marriage," Harry said, setting his jaw.
Padfoot whined a little but returned to Ron’s side like the dutiful dog Fawley expected to see.
"Not especially, since you ask," Harry said truthfully.
"Well, well. Good day, Mr Potter."
A brief silence followed this conclusion.
Ron and Hermione left via Floo on Thursday morning and, sorry to see them go, Harry contrived to spend the afternoon at Diagon Alley. Madame Pomfrey required various potions and ingredients, and while she had offered to go, Harry had insisted that she remain with Ginny, glad of the excuse to be away from the house while Sirius was out and only his wife was at home.
At this Harry fell quiet. He did not know how many others like him there might be, what would happen to them. “What will you do?”
He wondered idly if Ginny would give him another son this time, or if she would instead give birth to the daughter she so longed for. Names had already been discussed for both contingencies but not finalised for a girl: a boy would be Sirius for Harry’s godfather, to whose London residence they now travelled.
“Can you describe the morning of 11
“Ah!” Gabrielle said, face clearing. “
~o0O0o~
"I'm asleep already," Malfoy said to himself. "I'm asleep and I'm dreaming."
“Oh, yes, Revenge of the Veela,” said Draco sourly. “She always did fancy seeing if she could turn Potter back on to women. She’s a little young, don’t you think?”
Then, it hit Harry.
“But I have tried, so many times, Harry. Every time I thought of something, it didn’t work. Parties in the Slytherin common room, getting top grades one year, being on the Quidditch team. Even my wedding day didn’t make it work,” huffed Malfoy, crossing his arms as he already felt defeated.
Without another thought, Harry rushed over to him. All the situations he prosed slipped from his mind as he wrapped his arms around the frail body, pulling him close. Malfoy didn’t oppose, instead he pressed his face into Harry’s shoulder and wept. They stayed in this position for longer than Harry thought they would, until eventually, Malfoy’s sobs became gentle hiccups, and he pulled himself away.
Thank you so much for all the love and support with this story. I am so proud of this work, and I'm sad to see the end of it. I hope this ending has satisfied you as much as it has for me.
“I don’t believe you!” laughed Malfoy, his words strung together in a slur. “Go on. Tell me.”
Malfoy stayed silent for a while, arms folded, just staring at Harry. The air was tense, and Malfoy staring certainly didn’t help. All Harry could do was look down at the ground, attempting to fight away the tears that threatened to fall. His emotions were heightened, he kept them in so often due to his past that he didn’t know what to do when they threatened to be released.
“No, Potter,” he turned around and Harry noticed his lip quivering. “No. How could you be so dense?”
Ginny was hardly ever around anymore, as she was now a professional Quidditch player for the Holyhead Harpies. She was consistently travelling for matches, which was a shame because her company was always greatly appreciated by the group. Though, Harry knew Ron was very jealous of Ginny. Only he had been affected by the new order out of all the Weasley’s, mostly because being an Auror didn’t pay too greatly, and partially because he had married a Muggleborn. It irked Ron to no end, and he always was saying he wished he had decided to work at the ministry instead, because this wouldn’t have happened.
“It’s none of your business, Malfoy,” spat another man who was stood to his right. “We’ve got you now.”
“Eat,” said Malfoy, taking a sip of his whiskey.
“Harry-” started Malfoy, but he was interrupted.
“I’m so glad,” said Harry with a smile.
“You shouldn’t be here,” said Malfoy in a hushed tone.
“She knows?” he whispered.
It felt good. But not for long.
“If we find out that you are hiding anything, Malfoy, you will be seeing us again soon,” the shorter man threatened.
Being back in the shared bathrooms irritated Harry. On days like these, he had to trek in the cold wearing nothing but a dressing gown, which was even worse when he walked back to his room.
Harry stared at him, his breath hitching in his throat. Malfoy’s cheeks had gone red with anger, but the rest of his face remained cool. His eyes watched Harry carefully, staring down to his lips for a few moments, before looking back into Harry’s green eyes.
“But we will do whatever we can to help you,” said George from behind Harry. “Don’t worry, mate. We’ve got you.”
speak about it.
catches you here-”
“Oh?” said Narcissa in a bored tone, not thinking anything of it. She hadn’t mentioned anything to Harry about Malfoy messing up, or disappointing anyone.
look put together,” he said.
“No, it’s not,” sitting himself up properly, Harry searched Malfoy’s face with his eyes. “I didn’t want you to do that alone. I know what you’re like. I know what your past is like. We have similar trauma, Draco. Sometimes I will arrive somewhere, somewhere I have been a million times, and I’m suddenly back in those days. I’m suddenly terrified that Voldemort is round the corner, using all my energy to keep him from being in my mind. I know what it’s like.”
Chapter 8 - Time To Act Like That Thing That Happened Didn't Happen
Fuming, he stomped out of the library and back to the common room. However, as soon as he enters, he feels overwhelmed. The room is stifling, theres too many people in here. He quickly darts up the stair to his room and throws himself on the bed. He trys to block out any unbidden thoughts as he stared at the ceiling. Waiting for sleep to come. For the nightmares to come.
Chapter 11 - Those Wretched Acting Skills
"Malfoy.. Do you want to practice for the dance?" he asked, his voice unsure once more. Draco plastered a cocky smile on his face to cover his embarrassment of alnost being caught and turned around.
"Come along love, I want to take a walk outside of this bloody castle. It's been a long weekend." Hermione smiled up at him with a look Harry'd never seen on her before- complete adoration and quickly got up and walked away, waving at Harry and smirking at the three of them as she left.
Harry was trying really really hard not to laugh. He heard Draco's shout which was funny enough but the fact that Malfoy was so mad that he actually touched Harry? Hilarious! Not to mention he was still holding his hand.
"I'm going to go find Malfoy. You two behave." He demanded sternly. They nodded and watched him leave. One worrying for her friend and one worrying for all of them.
He sat in the chair opposite of the desk and waited more. A few minutes later a middle aged lady with green hair and tiny spectacles walked in smiling and sat in the other chair.
The sun somehow already ducked behind the tree tops as they walked the long road home. Draco wondered where all the time had gone in the day, it had go be at least 7 if not later. But it didn't feel like they spent three hours at Hogsmead, it was quite ridiculous. But it did remind him of a muggle saying he had heard once. "Time flys when you're having fun."
" I am NOT! "
"I introduced Hermione to Pansy and we were talking about Quidditch, our classes, and our plans for after school. Nice jacket by the way.. Did you just buy it?" Blaise asked with a twitching smile and a knowing look in his eye. Draco paled a little bit and considered his words carefully.
" need? " Harry asked, arching an eyebrow.
Ron frowned. It had been almost four weeks since the war. He understood that everyone worked differently but he thought that he'd waited AGES to try to get help.
Holy shit. Harry Potter just kissed me.
"You guys look rather out of breath, were you running from the nargles?" Harry bit back a smile and deadpanned at her. " Yes, we barely escaped. I see one next to your head. Watch out, their coming for you. " Luna smiled and rolled her eyes sympathetically, it wasn't her fault they weren't educated in mystical magical creatures. But their jokes really were quite funny sometimes.
-Flashback-
They hadn't been kissing long when they heard someone clear their throat. Snapping apart, both boys flushed when they realized who had interrupted them. It was no one other then their very own Head Mistress, Minerva McGonagall. And Horace Slughorn. Both of whom were smiling quite widely. There goes the secret of their newfound thing.
Instead, Draco pulled back the covers on his bed, flicked his wand to close the drapes, and curled up in a ball under the blankets. Slowly drifting off into a troubled sleep filled with Harry Potter.
"Hi, my name is Ron." His voice was weak and hoarse from disuse. He wasn't sure when the last time he used it was.
Lightly shrugging his shoulders, Harry stood up and exited. Banishing the confusion from his mind, there were more important tasks at hand He needed to go find Draco so they could practice for the ball.
Harry smiled once more and nodded his head. Then turned and walked away. A rather confused Draco trailing after him. Eventually Harry did this rather ridiculous thing were he walked back and forth in a hallways three times. Draco thought he was pacing but who knew. when it came to Potter, he knew better then to ask questions.
Those words. Those three words haunted him day and night. He tried everything to make the faces and the words go away. Firewhiskey only made everything worse. One time, in despair, he created a gash on his wrist hoping to scare them but all that did was create a mess to clean up and make Ron dizzy from bloodloss.
Luna however seemed eather unaffected by the depression like fog that seemed to be seeping over everyone. She went about her way, eating breakfast and chattering about some species she discovered while camping last summer. Her little ray of pure sunshine brightened everyones mood considerably, but they were still rather quiet.
Draco was honestly shocked. Potter was an excellent story teller! And the fact that the bushy haired mudbl.. know-it-all saved his friend didn't really shock him. She did so enjoy trying to be better than everyone at everything. Draco was however, barely two points behind her. He was JUST as smart as she was. He just didn't flaunt it and the two points were only because he had to skip because his family pulled him out of school.
Chapter 16 - Secrets and Letting Go
"What's your problem Potter?" Draco asked accussingly.
Harry didn't think it'd be possible to blush more but, apparently he was wrong. Malfoy would be Malfoy.
Draco's mind was a jumbled mess that went something along the lines of "cute boy.. Bad problem.. cute boy.. bad problem.. food? Boy?? Problem. BOYFRIEND!!!" He couldn't even think in full sentences. Or was he even thinking? He wanted to stay serious but it was so hard to concentrate when Harry just looked so happy to be here with him.
"What in the bloody hell are you talking about? I haven't spoken to you at all today!" Harry exclaimed. Malfoy simply rolled his eyes and turned around walking away.
Shrugging, Draco got up and headed down to the Great Hall for breakfast. He found Blaise at the Gryffindor table, unsurprisingly he had Hermione in his arms. He sat down across from his friend and started dishing up. Looking around the hall, he saw alot more house unity. The sectioned tables were more ignored and people seemed to be starting to sit with whomever they wanted. They had started that. Actually, Blaise and Hermione had started that. It never failed to awe him how far they've come in such a short time.
Chapter 6 - Anger Issues Much?
Honestly Harry wasn't sure how to respond. He knew Malfoy was bluffing and wouldn't really go to Hogsmead with him. The Ferret would find some excuse. But Malfoy seemed 100% sincere, besides the sarcasm that is. Harry just needed to bide his time and find a way to call hin out on it. Eventually Malfoy would chicken out and Harry would win. In the meantime, Harry had to spend an ungodly amount of time in his presence. Unless Malfoy quit that is. Though, five minutes in Malfoys prescence was too much in Harrys opinion.
Harry was absolutely thrilled that Draco was letting him drag him around and hold his hand, he was not expecting it at all. Harry found himself wanting to do all the cute couple-y stuff he often made fun of others for and pretended to retch at. He had come to the realization that maybe he was just jealous. Doesn't matter now though!
"Let's go!" Yet Potter resisted so Drack snatched his hand and yanked him to his feet and dragged him out the door. Completely ignoring the scene he was making and trying to ignore the burning sensation he felt on his face. When they were out of the Three Broomsticks, Draco kept walking forward, where to he didn't know. He just had to get away.
That was. Until the boy let out the most high pitched scream Crookshanks had ever heard. Harry stood up on his bed and leaped off, leaving a confused Crookshanks with the still warm rabbit.
"Mean what Potter?"
"Well where could he be?"
"So, about last night. Did you mean it?  Harry's voice was hesitant, unsure of what path he was headed down.
His lips were soft. He tasted like sugar and raspberries. The kiss only lasted a couple seconds but the message behind it was clear.
He had also reached out and gotten in touch with Harry and Hermione again, they were also coping and he saw them a couple times throughout the summer.
"I am not begging." Draco snarled " You know what? Keep the damn book, I don't care! "
Luna led him to another counter and began talking animatedly.
"I know I don't have any business liking you. I've been horrible to you my whole life. During the war we almost died because of how badly I screwed up. But this is our last year at Hogwarts. I want to do something that matters. I want to be someone who matters. And I guess I just started looking at you differently. I don't know. This is stupid, I'm stupid, I'll just g-" Draco was cut off by a mouth rushing to meet his.
Harry watched them all in amusement, still curious why they were so worked up but his amusement quickly turned to dread as Seamus explained between laughs "Harry.. Did you know.. That you talk.... In your sleep?!" Then all four stopped laughing and deadpanned stared at Harry, in unison, they moaned "Oh Dracoooooo!!!" And lost it again.
Their dance practice was much improved in Draco's opinion. There was less toe stepping, Harry finally stopped trying to take lead, and from the walls that doubled as mirrors surrounding the room, they looked almost graceful.
"Oh. I'll get what she's getting." He said hurriedly. The man behind the counter smiled and totaled their costs. Ron pulled out his coin purse and payed, making sure to leave money for a decent tip. Being a hero payed well. Enough that he wanted to share.
Ron Weasley wouldn't call himself oblivious. In fact, if you asked him, he would say he was quite perceptive. He just happened to be perceptive more when it was pointed out then on his own time. He was a listener! That's it.
"Sorry Luna I-" he was cut off by her small giggle and took a moment to watch her reaction. She wasn't flushed, she didn't even look suprised. But she did still look happy. Maybe even more so.
The receptionist didn't say anything, just pointed to a poster on the wall.
It seemed like minutes had passed when they finally left the tower. Unfortunately it was more like a few hours. They left the tower together, closer then ever. Their walking was completely unhurried as they just enjoyed eachothers company. When they reached the bottom of the steps, they linked pinkies and smiled secretively.
"So, Luna, what have you been up to this summer?" Probably not the best phrase but it was just going to be what he went with.
He stormed upstairs and threw himself on the bed, feeling entirely childish yet justified. He just no clue how he was justified. After a few minutes of sulking and pouting, Harry felt something in the back of his mind. A sort of cold slithering feeling that was oddly like a snake, sliding through his memorys, sorting them and throwing aside several. He lay there, unable to react as it came to the surface of his mind and roughly took control, sorting even faster through memorys Harry didn't know that he even had - Him as a toddler, riding around on a broomstick, nearly running over a cat that looked suspiciously like Crookshanks. Another that soon came to surface was sitting in a crib, reaching out to a woman laying on the floor staring at the ceiling, not moving. His mother. He was crying hard because she wouldn't get up. It was just a game but she still wouldn't get up. Why wasn't she getting up? The game wasn't funny anymore
He was dreaming of hunting a deer. Just about to leap and take it in his mouth when suddenly he woke up. Confused, the old cat blinked his eyes and found a tired Harry holding him in his arms.
When he found Draco in the library, the blonde looked.. Guilty. He was sort of fidgeting and looking around like he was trying to hide something.
"Hey uh Harry? Your boyfriend is asking after you downstairs. I told 'em I'd fetch you." Dean said, startling the poor guy. Harry turned red and ran past him muttering "He is not my boyfriend" and Dean just smiled. Soon enough maybe.
She felt Blaise's hand cover hers rather possessively so she turned to face him and he just smiled down at her and planted a kiss on her lips. She rolled her eyes at his affection but she knew that he knew she loved it. But  she still batted his hands away. (Which he immediately wrapped around her waist, and burrowed his face into her neck and shoulder) and turned back to the boys who had now arrived and seated. Harry opposite to Malfoy. This was definitely quite the scene. She wanted details!
"You too?" He asks. He's too suprised to think about what he just admitted to Potter.
When the meal was over, Harry and Draco stood up at the same time and said their byes. They walked away, both trying to NOT watch the other person yet somehow, ending up staring at eachother as they walked, resulting in a clumsy Harry crashing into another person. Draco let out a bark of laughter as Harry went down once again. That poor guy really needed to watch where he was going.
It was weird. That was the best way Draco could describe it. The dance was in a couple days, Draco was dating Harry Potter, and it was weird. Not bad, not at all. Just strange. The first day they were together everybody stared at them and whispered to each other. Draco couldn't stop blushing, it wasn't like him to be so flustered about the person he was with.
So how in the bloody hell is he supposed to have a serious conversation about dating HARRY POTTER.
Purring, Crookshanks nuzzled Harry's face and allowed the male to resituate them. The only problem was Harry was taking up like. Half the space. This was against the rules. The male KNEW he was only allowed 25%. The twin sized bed was MORE than enough for them to both sleep comfortably in the space they needed.
"Yes please!"
Harry's face burned brighter as he quickly nodded. He turned and gathered up his stuff, intending to leave before making it awkward again.
Chapter 14 - Less Talk, More Action
Harry looked over his choice of breakfast options and frowned, none of them looked super appealing. In fact, he wasn't even hungry anymore. All he wanted to do was look at Draco and think about Draco. He almost couldn't take his eyes off of him. Draco just took over his every thought and it was so extremely difficult to concentrate. Much less eat.
Draco stood up to leave, he wanted Potter to stew and freak out. Eventually he would get nervous and think Draco had meant it. Then he would leave. And Draco would win. But for now.. Maybe a parting gift for Harry to ponder over. Draco smiled evily as a plan formulated in his brain.
Young love indeed.
They finished practice ten minutes before dinner started, deciding to walk down together instead of parting like they usually did. They entered the Great Hall in a flurry, their hair messy and slightly out of breath from the dancing and walking to dinner. They didn't realize what it looked like they'd been doing, with their robes haphazard and their hair mussed. Both of their faces slightly red.
"The 'Tales of Beatle the Bard ' is your favorite book?" Potter asked skeptically. "It's a children's book."
Draco reared his head back in shock and a little disgust. Another test. Potter expected him to say no and turn his nose. Draco desperately wanted to, but.. He wasn't really going to give him his jacket. Besides. He was cold. So Draco did the last thing Potter expected. He smiled a sickly sweet smile and said
"And miss a surely wonderful day with the famous Harry Potter? Never! But I mean, you must have some brilliant stories to share considering how famous and talented you and your friends are! I look forward to our.. Date" Draco said, smirking at Harry 's flushed face.
"Luna, I know I've been a bit of a jerk to you in the past but would you like to go to the ball with me? When the time comes that is." He finished rather awkwardly.  Luna looked rather suprised but a pleasant, dreamy smile came across her face.
Draco's stomach turned and boiled with a suprising amount of fear.
Draco's head was reeling. Neither of them said anything for a minute, they just studied eachother in silence. Harry looked like he was fighting a smile.
The abnormal part started when Draco Malfoy came over and sat down next to Blaise and across from Harry. He just sits there and starts eating like he owns the bloody place. On one hand, Harry felt a small amount of respect for a man who put aside his views to support his friend. On the other.. What in the bloody hell. Since when does this foul, loathsome git get to sit with them?
While Harry was beating himself up about it however, Draco was touched that he noticed.
He thanked the elves and quickly exited the kitchen, rushing off to his dorm to finish his food.
" Now listen very closely. You are going to take Mr. Potter and retuen to your respective dormitories. Hermione, lay him in his bed and wait until he wakes. When he does, simply tell him he slept the day away. He won't know any better. " McGonagle stated before walking over to Harry and raising her wand.
"Luna, I know I've been a bit of a jerk to you in the past but would you like to go to the ball with me? When the time comes that is." He finished rather awkwardly. Luna looked rather surprised but a pleasant, dreamy smile came across her face.
"Ask Madame Pince for another copy." Potter said dismissively, moving to walk around Draco but the stupid git blocked his way.
Malfoy ate his food like a fricking princess. Perfect manners, perfect posture. He used a napkin and everything. He made Ron look like even more of a pig. Especially when they were in close proximity. It was really quite interesting to watch the pretty princess.
"Indeed not," Malfoy said, holding open the door for Harry to climb inside. "We are not going to a place connected with our world." He looked to the hulking form of his driver. "The usual place, Goyle," he commanded as he entered the carriage.
o0O0o
“Father is furious.”
"It will do the boy good to have occupation," Sirius said a little too heartily. "He is right to say that he should learn how to manage his own estates – I cannot live forever, after all, and better he learn now, with my guidance."
Ginny opened her mouth to say something but Lucius got there first. "I believe you are acquainted with my son, Draco."
Draco barely looked at the boys in that unnerving parlour before flinging out a hand. “Those five.”
"To qualify the honourable member's assertion, let it be known that the lack of a strategy focused on the latest information is one of the problems we face," Lord Malfoy said smoothly. "Homogenising a range of issues into one and labelling it 'hysteria' is counter-productive to ensuring the best health of wizarding society."
Hermione was on her feet in a trice, her face reflecting a deep-seated horror. "Harry," she breathed, "you cannot mean… Is Voldemort… is he…?"
“Did you fake the memory?”
Malfoy let out a deep groan and his fingers tangled in Bertram's hair. Bertram seemed to respond by doing something Malfoy liked even more, causing him to throw back his head. The motion exposed miles of Malfoy's exquisite throat from which he let out a whimper, his hips jerking forward to thrust into Bertram's mouth.
"I what, Potter?" Malfoy asked when Harry couldn't quite finish his sentence. His tone had turned silky, his demeanour more confident and Harry had a bare split-second of warning before Malfoy was smashing his mouth onto Harry's.
“The nerve,” Blaise deadpanned.
He turned back. Ginny was staring at a fixed point on the floor. "Will you not come to me this night before you go?" she asked. Her face seemed strained as though she hated herself for asking.
In the home stretch now! Big hugs to all you lovely commenters, especially lijahlover, the real MVP xx
Harry brought her fingers to his mouth. "I do not think I could manage without you," he told her honestly.
“I am sorry to come unexpectedly,” Harry began. He found himself twisting his hands together, regretting that he had no plan for this, no idea how to bring Sirius into his confidence without exposing himself.
"Ah," Harry said. There seemed to be little he could say to that.
Teddy frowned. "Yes?"
"I don't know how to help you," he said at length.
Draco rounded on him, eyes full of furious hurt. “How can you say that? I—”
“Where are you going?” Harry demanded. “The renters again?”
Diggory waved his hand, dismissing the unimportant. “Frankly it’s too fantastic to be worth discussing and I would hate to sully your ears with it. The difficulty is, we have to be seen to investigate even our own. Especially our own, one might say. And while that’s happening, it isn’t a good idea for you to be on committees and what-not. Makes it look like we’re not taking this seriously.”
. Through the door Harry could see dark wood benches lined with white leather for seating.
"I want you," Harry gasped as he mouthed his way down Draco's body. "I've wanted you and wanted you and you weren't there."
"I've tickets for the opera tonight!" Sirius announced without warning one evening.
The eyes, though, he knew he could never match. He would never again see that certain shade of green.
“Yes, you do,” said Pansy around an exhale.
Harry slumped down against the door to his bedroom, his head in his hands. This was intolerable.
Hermione asked questions about the rooms, Harry’s treatment of the staff and some other banalities.
Mercifully Hermione didn’t say
"Yes, on the fifth," Harry said, yawning. "I'd not forgotten."
Ginny flashed into Harry's mind but he did not dwell on her image. He had made his decision and he would accept the guilty conscience as the price for the pleasure only Draco could offer him.
Draco looked at him over his shoulder. “If your father kept telling you how much you disappointed him, would you not do everything you could to rectify it?”
Sirius nodded.
"Isn't he the one…?" Nott began but Malfoy cut him off.
"He might," Harry acknowledged. "He hates the conventions that restrict him but he knows it is important that moderate voices such as his remain on the Wizengamot – otherwise the blood purists might pass further restrictions. Your father, for example…"
"I have to touch you," Draco whispered, reaching out for the hundredth time to find that Harry's face would not materialise beneath his fingertips.
Harry stood his ground. "And what might that be?"
"You know about Remus and I," Sirius began at length.  "What I have to tell you happened before you were born."
"I congratulate my honourable friend on securing this important debate on a subject that I know is close to his heart," Lord Malfoy was saying. "I echo his comments and point out that, at present, research into such areas is heavily restricted and that it may be to our benefit to consider issuing a permit, at least insofar as we wish to develop such a charm further."
with his feet propped up on the chair opposite, louche and irreverent and perfect.
Harry tightened his hold until Ginny gasped, at which he let go immediately, apologies on his lips.
"Expulsion," Draco said grimly. "I was a friend to one of them. He had shown me things. He showed me how to stroke myself. He died not long after. I think it was his intention."
Terry Boot had been a boy genius and a bookworm. Once he was of age and after a bit of restructuring post-war, Flourish & Blotts became Flourish, Blotts & Boot, and it was there Draco knew to look for him.
A laugh was startled from Harry's mouth. "Do I appear so very desperate?"
“Yes; it would mean that wizards could legally evict Muggles from their homes without any cause other than a desire to take their property!”
“Dull, dull, dull,” Draco countered.
"I do not exert myself," Ginny argued.
At that Hermione's head came up. The three of them had shared all manner of secrets at school, but it had always been
Draco looked back into Harry’s eyes and said miserably, “We do know. The only thing we don’t yet is how far it will go.”
As Sirius had never married, Harry was heir to the Black title and fortune – which brought both freedom and responsibilities. Harry had had the importance of "going to town" for the birth of a child drummed into his head but had had to work hard to convince Ginny this time; she would much rather have gone to her mother at the Burrow. Harry had understood, but convention dictated their actions in this case and Ginny had rather sullenly agreed. Where her previous pregnancies had given her a glow, this most recent seemed instead to have sapped the vitality from her completely and Harry was ashamed to admit that he was looking forward to her confinement, allowing him some time with Sirius.
"It is important to carry on the family line," Lucius said firmly. "A man in your position understands that, Harry. After all," he said with a small smirk, "you will inherit not only from your own family but from my wife's as well."
For a long moment both men slipped into silence. Then Ron said, “I don’t know what in blazes is going on and the way I see it, I can find that out later. What do you need right now?”
"Thank you," Harry said, relief swelling in him so sweet and sharp he feared he might collapse. "I know how much I am asking of you."
but all he could think of was doing that again.
"Harry," Remus greeted him warmly, shaking his hand. "Harry, it is always a pleasure."
Harry sighed inwardly. "If you wish it, my dear," he said weakly.
“Not to me,” Draco replied around a mouthful of smoke. “And it won’t happen now, either.”
Sirius nodded. "Do the other Weasleys...?" He trailed off, trying to be delicate.
“Let me guess,” Harry snarled.
Harry shivered though the autumn day was sunny and temperate. That thing just out of reach, he needed it or he would never be complete.
"We'll see how Teddy is getting on," Remus said, nodding. "I cannot believe that he is ready to finish school!"
"I wish I'd smashed that stone when I had the chance," Harry said.
“And Charlie Weasley.”
"And how are your classes progressing?" Harry asked at once, seizing the opportunity.
He would be worthy of those loves again.
Harry started at the voice and turned; while he had stopped paying attention, Malfoy had appeared behind him. He was all in emerald green tonight and Harry's breath caught at the jewel brightness of him. His heart began to pump faster, alarm filling him, yet the longer he looked at Malfoy the less urgent escape seemed to become. Instead that insidious effect Malfoy had on his senses began to take hold, far more intoxicating than brandy – Harry swallowed the last of his in a gulp, looking away from Malfoy for a brief second before unerringly fixing his eyes on that mouth again, a compass finding true north.
Ginny looked Harry full in the face. "And that is all it is?"
Draco raised an eyebrow. "You watched me with Bertram."
"Master Potter is here," Kreacher said. "Master Potter has come back and Master Sirius did not tell Kreacher, no, and now another bedroom will have to be made up."
Sirius had been quite the rebel in his early years, or so Harry had heard from those who had seen it. But there was little evidence of it left in his character beyond a certain restlessness that Harry could see was what drove him into gaming hells and gentlemen's clubs. Idleness was unnatural for all of them.
"I have to," Draco replied. It was true: he was an Unspeakable now, and a new breed of Dark Wizard had everyone researching magics that would have been illegal a few scant years before. The rumours flew endlessly around the Ministry, around the world: they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
“Oh,” Harry said, understanding at once, imagining a younger Draco high on sex with older, privileged and powerful men.
The Apothecary was one of the first shops after the Leaky Cauldron so Harry made sure to visit there first. Madam Pomfrey had given him a written list, and it was merely a case of handing over the list and the Galleons. He smiled at the boy behind the counter and turned to leave. It was then that he heard a drawling voice so familiar it might have been that of his dearest love despite his only having heard it the once before.
Teddy laughed at that, throwing his head back and opening his mouth wide. White teeth gleamed at Harry, mischief sparkled from eyes which changed colour from moment to moment and then Teddy was off, running towards the stream, discarding his clothes as he went.
"Not too much longer," he echoed, holding on to her hand. Ginny made him feel at peace most of the time; it was why he loved her. She knew him so well.
"I believe she will arrive very shortly," Arthur said in a kind tone. Harry could almost see the effort Molly was expending not to speak out; he was not hard pressed to imagine what choice words she must have for him, perhaps worsened by how very much she had always loved him.
At this Ginny's eyes widened. "Oh," she said, her gaze dropping to the floor. Harry swallowed, waiting for her reaction.
One night as Harry slipped his fingers inside a pleading Draco, the thought occurred that this was the most assured he had felt since he had commanded Tom Riddle search his soul for remorse.
That night was burned onto Harry's memory. He remembered sprinting up the stairs, he remembered clutching Ginny's hand. He remembered having to ask Madam Pomfrey to tell him what had happened a total of four times before abandoning the idea that it was going to sink in. And he remembered Ginny, fragile and so white he was afraid she had died.
Hermione did not press the issue, instead saying simply, "Perhaps that is a failing which we need to redress. We miss and love you, Harry. We all want you to come back to us."
Harry had barely begun to think of his godfather before the carriage pulled to a stop outside his residence at Grimmauld Place. Most unconventionally it was Sirius himself who flung open the door, his long-suffering house-elf Dobby at his heels, muttering to himself about how it wasn't proper for Master Sirius to open his own doors.
"Your guest's in the room at the back," Aberforth said, barely looking up from the glass he was cleaning.
Ginny smiled and Harry remembered wishing to move mountains for that smile. In this he was more than happy to oblige her.
"Everyone knows, of course," Ron said. "And there is considerable debate regarding the veracity of your motivation. But I know that you would never hurt Ginny." He squeezed Harry's shoulder in solidarity. "I know it."
~o0o~
Pansy rolled her eyes. “And I found out last night when Neville was leaving for the pub. ‘Cheer Harry up after the break up’ was all I got, and I would have told you that then, only you weren’t answering when I called.”
~o0O0o~
In a sustained military campaign, the best advantage is a strong ally.  Which is one reason why Draco had made certain to stay close with Pansy for all these years. Standard Slytherin protocol.
Terry's eyes narrowed. "Why? You seemed fairly determined not to discuss it last time."
The silence had gone on too long. "You and your father came with your Grandmother, of course," Harry said, trying to change the subject as quickly as possible to cover his gaffe.
~o0O0o~
"Sorry I'm late," Ron said, not looking up. "We had this wizard cornered in Knockturn Alley, it took… Oh," he said as he shrugged off his cloak and found Harry sitting before him. "Hullo, mate."
Harry did not want to answer, but neither could he lie to the person who had brought him such pleasure. "No, it was not."
So, it had begun as a game to Draco. The signs had been there, now that Harry cared to remember. "Isn't he the one…?" Nott had said and Draco had stopped him with "Not finished yet." Harry hadn’t understood at the time but he did now.
Draco looked down at himself. “Yes?” he hazarded.
Teddy grinned. "I'm looking forward to it, Uncle Harry, I really I am."
Harry looked out of the window. "Perhaps the railway will extend to Godric's Hollow soon."
“Run away?” Harry blinked his disbelief. It was as incredible to him now as it had been when Draco suggested it. “I am an Englishman! I fought to prevent this country falling into darkness and you would have me, what? Leave the Wizengamot to Lucius and the others who will put us back a hundred years? I have a duty—”
“She is,” Harry said. “Perhaps I should have left with her.”
That, combined with the formal charge, made three pieces of good news. Dawlish had gone for a charge of gross indecency rather than sodomy.
The word hovered between them.
That was true, too. And it was also true that he had not considered that Kirke might not like what he was doing, did it instead of starving. Harry had been jealous of him – for what?
"Do you like it?" Harry had to know.
By the time ten o'clock arrived, Harry was beginning to worry. Where could Draco be?
But Sirius was shaking his head. “I think we are beyond that now. If Blaise is right then Lucius has all he needs.”
“One drop of Muggle blood may not make a Muggle, but multiple acts of perversion do make one pervert would you not agree?"
The committee ended at the pre-determined time; this afternoon had been set aside for debate and the next meeting in two days’ time would be for the vote.
Sirius sighed. “You’re completely arse over teakettle, aren’t you?”
"And yet," Lucius replied with a curled lip, "it is always a pleasure to debate with such a
Sirius gave up asking Harry why he was so quiet quarter of an hour into morning tea. Harry feared that his mood must be terribly obvious to someone who knew him well and wished for the first time that the wizarding modes of travel were not so instantaneous. He could have used the time afforded by a carriage ride to compose himself more fully, but such travel could be hazardous in winter even with magic.
whose body Malfoy was caressing, one hand on the boy's face the other on his… on his cock. Harry wondered wildly where the woman Pansy had gone, how Malfoy could be so blatant as to be pawing a boy in the street as though it were the most natural thing in the world.
~o0O0o~
"Do you dream of me often?" Harry asked, unable to help himself.
"What's the matter?" Harry said, taking in her fraught appearance.
Draco waved a hand. "I shall find ways to occupy myself."
Harry felt his shoulders slump.
"You didn't come," Malfoy spat at Harry.
Harry laughed hollowly. “Never with impunity, Draco. Never that.”
To that, Harry could say nothing.
"Is ‘proxy’ another of your odd euphemisms?" Harry asked, exasperated.
Harry managed to avoid Ginny for the entire day. He knew it was rude but he had other things on his mind. He chose his attire for that evening with more care than he had used since choosing his wedding clothes, an analogy that did not sit easy on his conscience.
Harry saw the thought land and slowly sink in. "Well," he said, motioning to rise. "I think I should retire for the evening."
"That's enough!" Sirius bellowed.
Except the half-remembered story Harry whispered into the space between Draco's shoulder blades one night when the dreams became too much for him. For all the slaughter he had seen, it was that first death, Cedric's death, that Harry could never forget.
Draco's hips jerked forward in response and Harry found himself suddenly gagging as Draco's cock went deeper into his throat than he had anticipated. He pulled his mouth away, coughing slightly, and felt Draco pull away.
At the time, Harry had no idea how significant that encounter would come to be. He was merely grateful for the distraction afforded by the presence of Remus Lupin.
"I love you," Harry whispered. "I can promise you that. Please don't use it against me."
Harry pressed his knuckles to his mouth. "I betrayed my wife," he said and the words made her real again. Ginny, vibrant and fiery and full of joy. Ginny who grounded and centred him. Ginny who had given him children. He swallowed hard against the rising bile in his throat.
Sirius had a plan. Blaise had a plan. Harry had never really been much of a planner at all.
"I can verify that," Harry interjected, recognising his cue. "Ginny does not exert herself unduly, though she often does walk about the property for the sake of fresh air and exercise."
done this twice before, you know." Her voice grew sharper with every word.
Malfoy glared at Zabini, who smiled benignly. "He met the Black Widow and of course the lovely Lady Malfoy. I suspect the tabbies thoroughly savaged him, did they not, Potter? But of course I was there to save you."
“I object to this entire discussion,” Lucius said coldly.
"And you?"
"You are the Master of Death," Draco whispered to Harry's body. "And you are coming back to me."
It was too much and not enough. Draco was pulling at Potter’s clothes before he knew it, not with any strategy but with a blind lust for naked flesh. Potter pulled at his just the same, working the robe open and pushing it back off Draco’s shoulders. There was no finesse, no well-developed skill set. Whatever it was that made Potter great, it came from somewhere within him, and Draco just snarled until Potter’s shirt finally opened and then pressed sucking kisses to his chest, trying to get closer.
Malfoy crashed into the seat on the other side of the carriage, his hands automatically breaking his fall. Harry looked at him, certain his eyes must be as wild and desperate as the lust curling through his belly. He raised trembling fingers to his mouth and tried not to think of how desperately he wanted Malfoy's body back against his own.
"I thank you for your consideration," Harry said, still trying to hold on to neutrality towards the man. Merlin, this was going to be worse even than he had feared. He took a sip of tea to steel himself.
Remus and Sirius exchanged a glance.
Diggory sighed. “Lord Malfoy, is there a point?”
“It is the only way I can think of to fight your father,” Harry whispered into Draco’s shoulder for what felt like the hundredth time. “It would be a good idea for you to do the same.”
"And of course, you are getting plenty of rest I hope, Ginny dear?" Molly fussed. "You had such a difficult time with Lily after all."
“Should I make the arrangements?” Sirius asked eagerly.
"You bow and yet I do not believe we are acquainted," Lady Malfoy said, a slightly scornful look on her face.
o0O0o
Malfoy was sitting back on a hard wooden chair, his long legs thrown up onto the table before him. His cravat was red, the colour of rage. He stood, long limbs levering him upright with effortless grace, and prowled towards Harry like a predator about to execute his prey.
“I don’t deserve you,” he blurted out. “Not you, not Ron. Definitely not Ginny.”
Harry frowned.
When Hermione was finally satisfied, she nodded to Harry. “Ron went to see Sirius, who immediately threatened to charge down here but I think Ron talked him out of it. I don’t know if he convinced Sirius to stick to whatever plan you two agreed, though.”
Harry eyed him for a moment before saying, “Out with it.”
Draco undressed slowly, making it an art. His waistcoat was unbuttoned methodically, his shirt the same, until both were open over his slender frame, gaping widely. His grey eyes, silver in the lamplight, never looked away from Harry's own.
At ten minutes past the hour, Harry checked his appearance in the looking glass above the fireplace. He had tried to straighten his hair as much as possible, present himself neatly. For the first time in his life he wished he was more handsome.
"I wanted you to have it," Draco told him. Power over life and death and everything between: who better than Harry?
Harry sighed. "I would love to but it will depend on Ginny's health."
Draco cut him off. "I know what you fear. You fear that after such an act you will no longer be able to deny that you are a sodomite."
"They give her something to reread when you are not with her," said Ron, reaching for a glass of his own.
"I fear so," he replied.
“You will hear of a man who left his wife and children in the country to live a bachelor life in London. You will hear of a man who sought out the lowest of the low in order to debase himself. You will hear tell of acts which will shock you all the more
"Did you speak with his son?"
"It is a lesson I have long attempted to impart to my son," Lord Malfoy added. Harry swallowed. "You have children of your own do you not, Mr Potter?"
Ginny inhaled sharply at Harry's right. Harry, for his part, stood dumbstruck. This was an exceptionally familiar way to speak with him, implying an intimacy where none existed. Harry's eyes darted around Lucius's face tying to work him out.
Argh a day late! Sorry!
"I will endeavour to believe the possibility," Harry managed.
“That is not possible,” Lucius said, tone brooking no opposition.
, he realised even as he said it, just as he had known he wanted Malfoy before he had been able to accept it. He had known where he was and he had not wanted to face it.
"I am sorry I could not look better for you," Harry said.
"Draco," Harry gasped out, watching him. "Draco."
"Oh," said Ginny.
Goyle stood at the entryway to the house. “I am here to see Harry Potter,” he boomed.
He would stop this, he would.
"Indeed?" Harry swallowed. "I believe you must be much changed."
Remus nodded. "Occupation, Harry. You are quite right. It will do wonders for you. I am always at my best when I am able to work."
"Token?" a gruff voice said. Draco reached into his pocket and held up what looked like a plum carved from iridescent stone.
"This isn't about Ginny's health," Sirius said forcefully.
Sirius' lip curled. "Fine, yes. But I care, Harry."
Perhaps he should have simply obliviated Kirke but at the time he simply hadn’t thought of it.
"You said it yourself: I am not your acknowledged lover, nor likely to be. There is too much standing in the way. You wish me to make a better impression on your parents? Understandable if we were courting - but even if they came to accept me as your friend do you sincerely believe that they would welcome a
Harry shoved down the thought at once; Lord Malfoy could not possibly know what had passed between his son and Harry.
Harry remembered his manners and rose. "Lord Malfoy."
Hangover potion coursing through his blood, Draco pulled on his blue and gold robe and sat down in front of the fire, wand clutched loosely in his right hand.
"Very well. I presume my invitation will arrive once you have confirmed your attendance with the family Matriarch," Sirius said drily.
The woman stood and Harry recognised Lady Malfoy. He looked a little too long and she turned, eyes landing on him. Harry bowed instinctively.
Something slotted into place inside Harry's mind.  "That is why you always hated him so much."
Kreacher turned in confusion. "Master, will you not require..."
He rang the bell and a muttering Kreacher opened the door for him. The Master was in the parlour, and Harry followed the creeping elf through to the room in question.
Strengths: Ethereal beauty, reputation for discretion
"I find that hard to believe," Ginny said with a touch of asperity. "I understand from my husband that you and he are in quite different opinion on a number of important matters."
"It was a long time ago," Harry said, trying to encourage Draco to leave the past behind. "I do not ignore you now, do I?"
Except he had. He had kissed Potter before. This was all too familiar. What the…
then is anyone safe? Better by far to root out all the bumboys and punish them all.”
Harry smothered a chuckle but he couldn't quite keep his eyes from dancing and Sirius looked at him in exasperation until he finally gave in to the laughter.
At twenty minutes past the hour, Harry sighed and poured himself a glass of brandy from the decanter at the side of the room.
“I am coming to the point shortly. Mr Filch, are you acquainted with Mr Potter, the accused?”
“Good day sir,” Simpson was saying. “This is quite a set up.”
"The end of the old ways, certainly."
“Solidify any friendships you have in development,” Sirius said at once. “Reconnect with your Hogwarts classmates. Accept some more of those speaking engagements I know you abhor – remind everyone of your past heroics and it will be much more difficult for Lucius to undermine you.”
This is what I wanted, he reminded himself. This is what I have done.
Harry opened the door, expecting to find the room in darkness but Draco had cast a
"I have never spent so much time in Muggle London before," Draco remarked when they took a picnic by the Italian fountains in Kensington Gardens. They were hidden from view by charms so that their conversation would not be interrupted, and lay down on the grass, lazy in the sun.
Harry jumped to his feet. "Lord Malfoy, what—"
"You are trying to find a new balance." Sirius nodded. "But tonight you are not facing your death! So perhaps it would do you well to remember that your family and friends love you and will forgive you a great deal."
“Did you forget that I cursed my father for speaking ill of us?” Draco cut him off. “Did you already forget? The difference is, my dear idiot, that your family will excuse your sins whereas mine will go on the attack! That card is proof!” He was gesticulating madly, apparently unaware that he still held his wand. Harry wanted to disarm him but also wanted to see if he might be accidentally cursed because frankly that would be better than this.
Harry flinched from that a little; Ron didn't notice, intent on staring at his brothers' mulled wine glasses.
"They were surprised to hear that we were living apart, but they understand that sometimes it is a necessity when a man takes on responsibilities such as those of our family," Harry said softly. Granted, there had been a few questions. Ron, after all, took the Floo a great distance every night to be with Hermione and their infant daughter. But Bill often visited exotic locales in his work while Fleur was left behind. Questions had been asked, certainly, and there would no doubt be a slew of them to come on such an occasion, but Harry longed to see James and Albus and Lily.
The beautiful Tazza Fountain seemed to soothe him a little, but he could still barely speak to Harry, who wished abruptly that he had not brought the two of them out in public so that he could wrap his arms around Draco and tell him that whatever his father said, Draco was perfect exactly the way he was. He wished he could promise Draco a lifetime, coax him into smiles with kisses right here in the evening light.
He swallowed hard. Draco had woken him up, showed him who he was meant to be. He could put aside his own feelings and do what Draco needed, couldn’t he? He had, after all, done it for Ginny on innumerable occasions.
Draco finished his cigarette and stubbed it out. He stood at once, making one swift motion to kneel in front of Harry, pulling his legs apart and leaning between them. He pressed his face into the hair growing there, inhaling deeply. "I love the smell of you," he said, his voice a little rough. "I love it best now, when you smell also of me."
But it would be a betrayal of everything he had learned about himself.
"No! No, of course not. I fear the pain, and I fear that I will offer you no pleasure and I fear—"
Harry nodded jerkily in acknowledgement. Was that to be it? A return to the fold, his time away considered a temporary aberration, some episode of whose effects he had been cured?
Draco's smirk suffused his tone as he said, "Indeed?"
Weakness: Easily distracted, especially by that ridiculous Gryffindor sentimental streak
But Harry had had other enemies.
She opened it to find a brooch in the shape of a dragonfly, gold encrusted with rubies and pearls. “It’s beautiful, Harry!” she exclaimed. “Help me pin it to my shoulder.”
"I'm familiar with it," Draco said. Of course he was, Harry thought, his father must have talked about it on one of the evenings Draco disappeared home to the Manor. "It could also be used to apprehend criminals and intruders, to halt someone running away be they a miscreant or a child running into danger. I assume you have thought through all your objections and are not merely opposed to the idea as a matter of reflex?"
suite – at the Grand Western Royal. His head was buzzing. It could only be a threat. To ensure his help on committee? To put some distance between himself and Draco? Harry could not tell.
“Ginny Weasley just broke up with Harry Potter,” she’d said to him then.
In that moment Harry was tense and worried and many other things, but he was also relieved. He had been strong enough not to sell out what remained of his integrity.
The meeting of the full Wizengamot, at which a number of speeches were made, did indeed strike Harry as every bit as dull as Draco had predicted, though Harry was pleased to see many of his acquaintance again. The morning passed quickly and included few surprises other than Harry’s appointment to the Committee for Muggle Relations. It was not a post he had sought but one he looked forward to; it concerned communication with the Muggle Prime Minister amongst other important tasks. Harry knew he would have to speak to Hermione about her concerns as she was in a position to discuss her experiences and to highlight areas of concern. Assuming, of course, that she was ready to talk with him again.
"You are real."
Harry kissed him softly before he fetched a wet cloth from the washstand to clean them both up. He could have used a spell of course but he preferred the tactile experience of the cloth in his hand, Draco's body beneath. As he made to rise, Draco caught his wrist.
Malfoy was right in his face now and when his tongue darted out to moisten his lips it was scant inches away from Harry's own mouth. Harry was desperate to look away but somehow could not bring himself to do so, his whole being reduced to watching that motion of glistening tongue slide over sensual lips. Malfoy leaned even closer, his slight height advantage forcing him to bend to whisper into Harry's ear, "
When Draco came with a shuddering sigh, Harry licked his hand clean. "So beautiful," Harry said. His own cock was pressing hard and insistent against his clothes so when Draco pushed him back on the floor and took his length into that mouth, Harry barely took any time at all to follow Draco into bliss.
"All right," Harry responded softly. Ron stood there, solid as a rock, as he ever had been, Harry's best friend.
"Teddy is Remus' son," Sirius said simply.  "They were married, as you are married to Ginny."
He loved her so much for that.
Harry, still shaken to the core, stormed into Hyde Park as though he too would spend his day breaking things.  It would always be like this, he knew. Having Draco for a lover was like feasting with panthers. Or perhaps a snow leopard would be more apt.
Harry scowled. “Thirty Galleons? That is an outrageous sum!”
Draco pulled away for a moment and Harry made an incoherent noise of protest, but all was well; Draco merely placed Harry's legs on his shoulders then gripped his hips and lowered his mouth again. Harry's hands had been longing to run through Draco's fine hair but instead he reached behind him to clutch at the back of the sofa to keep himself upright as Draco pushed him backwards and up.
Not long after that, the other guests began arriving. Luna gushed over her god-daughter at length and Ginny smiled to see it. Seamus did his duty by the family before heading straight to the punch; Parvati had brought a few gifts for the children. As the marquee slowly filled, Harry watched Ginny carefully for signs of strain and told himself off repeatedly for wondering when Malfoy would appear.
Hermione stuck her chin out. “Yes sir.”
Lucius stared at him for a second before nodding sharply. “Very well. I trust you will make a decision shortly. In the interim, I may have to take steps to convince you of my sincerity.”
He blinked a few times. "I don't know, Sirius, this has been a most tiring day and…"
"Draco," a voice replied. "Oh, Draco." And then a hand, cold to the touch but tangible and solid stroked Draco's cheek.
“I… Coffee is fine,” she said politely though she was still frowning.
Lucius’s lips curved in a wintry smile. “Indeed. Then I will come directly to the point.”
"And how am I supposed to react to this tender confession?"
“How is this—” Lucius again but Harry cut him off.
"You will visit Remus as usual?" Harry asked, noting the way Sirius' features relaxed at the mention of Remus' name.
“Of course,” Draco acknowledged. “Did your beloved say who else was at the pub?”
Harry never backed down from a dare. He reached for Draco's hips, pulling him closer. He feasted his eyes on Draco's body and he remembered the thrill of lust he had felt before at the mere idea of performing this most intimate act. His lips darted out to moisten his mouth. Draco removed his glasses, his hand caressing Harry's face gently before pulling him forward. Harry opened his mouth, eager.
"His son," Harry said by way of explanation, though Draco certainly knew that even if the others did not.
Exhaustion and crippling guilt proved quite effective at dampening Harry's overactive libido. Sirius never raised the subject of Harry's whereabouts again, seeming to believe that Harry's guilt stemmed merely from his having left Ginny alone in the house. Harry almost wished that Sirius would press him on the matter, demand answers, force Harry to face what he had done. But Sirius instead fussed over Harry and the boys in lieu of bothering Ginny, who spent most of her time now drugged into sleep.
“Perhaps I was trying to be too stiff upper lip. Like you always are.”
later!” James said happily. “Muggles sound so strange.”
He smiled up as Harry approached, grey eyes clear and lovely as a winter sky. “Dear Harry,” he said and for a wild moment Harry was afraid Draco would do something horribly inappropriate and kiss him right there. The fear must have flashed in his eyes as Draco’s expression narrowed, but he merely stood and held out his hand for his lover to shake.
It was not Teddy who greeted him. It was Malfoy.
Harry looked at him askance. "I don't believe I understand."
“Yessir.”
Harry’s fingers tightened on his wand. “I have had a very poor few days and my temper is short. I have no patience for your double-talk.”
The moment Hermione had Harry alone, she rounded on him. It was little more than he had been expecting.
"Then how would you like to begin?" The words were half promise, half challenge.
Harry stared into Draco's eyes for a moment but he saw no dissembling. He brushed his lips over Draco's gently, then rested his head on Draco's shoulder. Draco was a constantly shifting pattern like the sunlight on water. Harry had him near, all his beauty and his mystery, and that was enough to content him, at least for a moment.
Sirius snorted. "You know how tough those things' hides are. Spells simply bounced off it; it was lucky neither of us was hit by a ricochet and killed!"
Time was doing strange things. Or, more likely, it was Harry’s sleep-deprived mind playing tricks on him. Dreamless Sleep was no longer helping and the yawning melancholy was growing, threatening to swallow him whole. How many times had he been in committee? How many times had he gone to bed? It seemed like barely any at all yet somehow everything had changed.
“Shut up about your fucking
"Why do you suppose it was so clear to you, while I did not understand until so recently?" Harry wondered aloud.
It was not a wizarding establishment, however, and Harry was therefore forced to make a detour in order to procure an owl. He wrote Draco a note which provided merely the name of the hotel, the address, the room number and the time,
Harry tried to look at the bright side: people he hardly ever saw would be there. He could spend time with Ron and Hermione. He would see Sirius's intimate friend Remus for the first time in several years. Remus had been almost an uncle to Harry in his early years and Harry missed him now.
Draco abruptly tore the card into pieces.
Harry tensed.
Harry stared after him, the long white hair and the warm black cloak moving down the corridor at a disconcertingly normal walking pace.
"We can pour our own brandies, thank you," Harry said firmly. "You may clear the table in the morning."
A hot wash of shame flooded Harry then. "Yes, sir," he said. He had not addressed Sirius as 'sir' for years, not since he was a child being disciplined.
Sirius took Harry to a gentleman's club for brandy, cigars and cards. Sirius had taught Harry himself, though Harry had never developed quite the same love of such games. Sirius was winning a game of whist and Harry had declined the invitation to join as one of the four; instead he wandered around, saying hello to old school mates and guests he'd met at the Bones' party. He accepted a large drink and nursed it quietly.
“Thank you,” Harry said, refusing to be intimidated. He took his seat and waited.
Abruptly the doors opened, and it was indeed too late. Lucius Malfoy entered the room in a whirl of black robes and ice blond hair, a house elf miserably chasing after him and pleading to be allowed to announce him.
Harry was
Harry flushed as Malfoy pulled away from him; the boys tittered. Malfoy's eyes glittered in triumph even as he turned to Filch, a bag of coins appearing from nowhere. "A room, Bertram for me and, oh, let's say, Kirke for my friend here. He has a taste for blond boys it seems."
“Suck it, Baddock,” snapped Draco before sweeping masterfully into Potter’s office.
"Mm," Harry replied. He stirred slowly, leaning back to look into Draco's sated eyes. "I didn't look for long after all."
"I will defer to your superior knowledge of her character," Draco said, and his tone was taking on that particular bite, familiar from any occasion on which Harry had complimented someone other than himself. "I will merely confine myself to remarking that even if you trust her and her immediate family, do you suppose every Muggle in the country is capable of blithely accepting the presence of a Changeling in their midst? Do you suppose it has never ended in tragedy all around?"
“I’ll have to go back to the hotel at some point,” he said quietly. “I’ll need my things and make a payment on the bill.”
Harry’s mouth curled a little. “Dull, dull, dull.”
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione had been saying that a lot lately. “I didn’t know… I should have realised…”
Harry knew it had. A young girl, only just of age, had asked for consent to marry a Muggle, and broke the Statute of Secrecy because she wanted to be honest with him. The Muggle had called her an affront to the natural order and run her though with a sword before setting fire to her parents' home.
He accepted the letter from the owl wordlessly; it had not waited for a reply which was well, as Harry had none. He did not open the letter, merely stared at it for a long time, looking at his name in Malfoy's hand, before abruptly throwing it into the fire and watching it burn to nothing.
Draco had been right; the vote would have appeased him. It would at least have bought he and Draco more time. But now the die was cast.
It should have shocked Harry but it did not; it was nothing he had not already known. It should have revolted him but instead it made him shiver; had he not felt the thrill of being possessed by Draco?
“Do not say that!” Harry burst out, but Sirius did not seem to hear him.
if that will prove it to you. He treats people like we’re nothing because he thinks he’s better than us. I never solicited a man! He came to me!”
"This is Bertram," Malfoy said, stroking the boy's cheek. "He is delightful."
"I did, thank you," Harry said.
Draco's gasps started to come out more like a word. Harry redoubled his efforts, thrusting higher now, hitting that perfect place inside of Draco with every motion.
Draco shook. “I don’t… I can’t do that, Harry. I worked so hard to be who I am. I can’t let him turn me back into that eleven-year-old who did everything he said to the point of committing our lives to the service of a madman.”
“I doubt it, Draco,” Pansy said. “I think you’re likely to face stiffer competition…”
"She was."
But no, when the man arrived in the courtroom, Harry recognised him from the Great Western Royal Hotel. This could not be good.
feelings," Ginny replied flatly. "I nearly died, Harry, and I am sorry if the changes wrought in me inconvenience you."
, hard and insistent as his own. It was terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure.
"Not this," Harry blurted out. "Never this, I never… Ginny…"
Harry frowned. "Vaguely. You insulted Ron? He remembers, even if I do not."
Filch looked like the cat who got the cream. “Yes sir, of course sir.”
"Where did you come from?" Harry whispered, looking at Draco with wonder.
Now, though, with shock and the loss ringing through his head, his perspective had changed. "Do you know, I think if I ever saw Draco again
"You should take a holiday!" Molly exclaimed as though she had just thought of it; Harry rather suspected that this had been her agenda in coming. He again strained to meet Ginny's eye but she was frowning.
Harry stood at once as a good husband should. “Boys, I’m going to see your mother -why don’t you play with your cousins and I’ll join you soon.” The two scampered off while Harry crossed the room to take his wife’s hand hand, drop a kiss on her knuckles. "Ginny," he said simply.
“Right then,” Harry said quietly.
Harry remembered finding Molly's slightly overbearing mothering deeply comforting as a child. Now there were many moments when he could cheerfully have strangled her. She had advice for Ginny on everything and it was turning Ginny into someone he didn't recognise.
Sirius' face was ashen.  He sat, seeming to need the support of something beneath him.  A long moment of silence followed as Sirius steeled himself.
The air filled with tension where moments ago there had been soft whispers and moans.
Remus shook his head. "Unlikely, Harry, for today at least. I'm in charge of the students of my house; I need to keep an eye on them. But perhaps I could come and visit soon, if Sirius can find space for yet another guest."
A delightfully constructed barb, Harry thought. Insult hiding in praise.
“I love you, Hermione,” Harry managed. “Tell Ron, that, too. And the others.”
"Care for a glass?" he said to Harry and, at Harry's nod, led him into the kitchen.
Harry winced. This kind of thing tended to make people respond badly to Hermione. He loved her and believed in her but he’d forgotten the way her know-it-all attitude could appear to others.
Laughing, Draco kissed him full on the mouth. “I think it best we not show ourselves in a state of ravishment, hm?”
The conclusion of the night’s discussion had been as follows: Harry would be best served by continuing to attend the Wizengamot as if nothing had changed. Ideally he would continue to socialise with all those connections he had worked hard to improve, keeping as many people as possible on side for as long as he could.
Luna nodded. “My father can help!”
Oh. OH!
I mean... it's still Monday somewhere, right?
"I was invited."
Harry's eyebrows raised themselves. "I've heard many good things about her, to be certain, but she is still young, as you say."
"I want you. I want you to touch me. I'm so tired of denying it, Draco. You're beautiful. I always saw that but I didn't understand why it disturbed me so much.”
“You… said…”
"If I feel better I might have the energy to suck you off," Harry said, knowing bribery was the best way forward.
He couldn’t imagine how Sirius would react if Draco
"I have love in me," Draco whispered. It was what they always told Harry, Draco knew, not him, never him. "I have love in me, the likes of which you can scarcely imagine, and rage," this they did see, this they did apply to him, "the likes of which you would not believe."
"Quite," said Harry.
Lucius was still talking. “If Draco was here you would expect him to relive the humiliation, would you? You would need my son to tell you all the details of how Potter’s aggression made him feel before your would believe—”
Who? Harry looked in confusion at Hermione. Perhaps the case would turn out to be a complete fabrication after all.
On the front in elegant script was merely his name, Lord Lucius Malfoy.  On the reverse, a note.  Harry had to read it twice to be certain, but there it was in front of him.  His lover's father had written for all the world to see, <i>For Harry Potter, sodomite.</i>
A sound outside the cell made Harry’s head turn. Fawley had heard it too, whatever it was, as he stood at once. “Show yourself!” he said sharply, his wand out.
Draco sighed. "I see. You would think less of me, then, were I to offer myself thus to you."
Harry managed to sleep a little that night despite himself. Ron was still his friend, and Sirius would be safe. That was plenty to be grateful for.
“Harry? Please?” Big green eyes looked at him beseechingly.
"Ginny," Harry said, raising his hand in a quelling gesture, "I fear I cannot stay here."
"And yet I too find myself behaving uncharacteristically," Draco said. "I have never cared before whether a lover chose to stay or go. You…" his voice trailed away.
Yes, yes, that, anything, touch me everywhere. Draco couldn’t manage the words so instead he grabbed Potter and pulled him back into a kiss. Potter held onto him and Draco could feel his arm flailing, heard various items go flying off the desk but didn’t have time for more than a moment’s interest in Potter’s wandless magic before he was being shoved back on the desk.
Harry grinned reluctantly. "Sirius, you'll never change." The sight of Sirius in his study, the dark wood and oriental carpet always made Harry feel at ease. He supposed it was what he associated with
Dobby returned in short order with everything he needed and assured Harry that he had been very discreet; Harry hoped for the best and thanked him profusely.
Hermione’s wand was at his throat in a moment. “I suggest you treat Harry Potter with some
“Ever since the Ministry arranged performances open only to wizards under the guise of a private-member club, it has become quite the place to be seen. And we could all use a little more culture.”
“Draco, I fail to see how visiting your parents for tea again will be any less awkward than last time. Particularly after I faced off with your Father over that bill Rosier wants to pass.”
Draco’s lip tried to jerk itself into a sneer before he mastered himself and replied, “But of course. Potter.” And he returned the way he had come.
"I rest as much as I can bear," Ginny responded, her voice a little tart. "But truth be told, Mother, I find that I would rather spend as much time as possible with the children."
Still with me? Here we go.
“Harry Potter, you have been found guilty of gross indecency—”
"For his own father to call him dissolute! Has he been disinherited?"
“Assaulting a blackmailer isn’t going to look great if they found him. Do you think they might have?”
"Not yet," Harry said. "The day has left me somewhat drained."
"You locked the door?" Draco gasped out between kisses.
“No, indeed. But one appointee has seen fit to give his place up to me.”
Sirius smiled sadly. “Aye, we do. But it’s all secret shadows and corners – that is how we stay safe. And that’s not who your Malfoy is, that much is crystal clear.”
He smiled at her as convincingly as he could manage and she nodded back at him, seeming relieved.
He had to be strong for Draco.
Taking a running dive, Harry’s body landed on his soft double bed. Instantly he curled up his body, hugging one of the pillows.
“No. What the fuck was all that, Malfoy? What the fuck?”
“Yes, Potter?”
“Be very careful, Mr Burke, I wouldn’t want you getting hurt.”
Peeking his head round the door, Harry’s eyes widened at the sight. There were three men, all a lot larger than he and Malfoy, surrounding him. Malfoy was sat in his grand office chair, which was all black and leather and looked comfortable, except for in this situation. Two of the men had their wands out, while a beefier looking wizard questioned him.
“How’s Malfoy?” asked Ron quietly as the two men stood in front of the mirrors, brushing their teeth.
“Of course you can stay,” chimed Mr Weasley with a large smile, “with only George around and Molly and I getting old, it’s hard to keep up the housekeeping.”
“Sir?” asked Harry nervously. For a moment, Malfoy stopped writing, before continuing, his hand a little shakier than before.
“Potter, don’t.”
“Shut up Ron,” said Harry, waving his hand at Ron as he looked around.
“Screw you, Potter.”
“Malfoy!” Said Harry. Within an instant, Malfoy spun on his heel which shocked Harry. He backed up against the wall as Malfoy stepped towards him, his eyebrows furrowed deeply and a scowl spreading across his face.
“Does it hurt?” asked Malfoy, leaning down and gently pressing the tissue to Harry’s cheek. The warm breath from Malfoy blew against Harry’s cheek, which oddly comforted him. Their faces were so close, Harry could see every pore, every flaw that he found endearing, he could see the scar he had given to Malfoy up close. After that incident, Malfoy never called Harry ‘Scarhead’ ever again.
After a few hours, Harry heard Malfoy call him into the office. Slowly Harry walked in, unsure what was about to happen. Surely Malfoy was angry at Harry now?
The wand felt good in Harry’s hand. Today was the first day Harry would be Draco’s bodyguard. It had taken a week to get preparations, to get paperwork done and for Harry to pack up his stuff. Unfortunately for him, he had to move into Malfoy Manor permanently, even on the weekends, as this would be a full-time job. But Malfoy would be able to grant him days off and Hermione and Ron had told Harry he could stay at their house if there were any times Malfoy gave him a few days off in a row.
“Do you mind if we join you?”
“I can’t believe you didn’t realise,” Malfoy turned and laughed softly, shaking his head, his blonde hair falling into his face. “You must really be oblivious.”
“Harry, back up to the attic right now,” said Mrs Weasley in a serious tone. Nodding, Harry took Hermione’s hand and they headed up the flights of stairs quickly, out of breath once they had reached the top.
“No,” responded Malfoy after a moment’s pause. “I don’t know.”
“It’s complicated, and I am worried you will judge me for what I have to tell you,” swallowing, Harry began his story.
“He’s doing an excellent job with the ministry,” piped up Theo as he jabbed his fork into his steak. “Top notch work if you ask me.”
“Not good,” answered Hermione with a forlorn smile, “not good at all. He’s really torn up about it. He’s been drinking every night and has been arguing nonstop with his staff. Astoria desperately wants you to come back.”
For a few moments, Draco stared at the bedsheets, before slowly nodding in agreement.
“Father,” his voice cracked before he quickly left the room, striding down the corridor. Harry had to run to catch up with him. Once they were in private, Malfoy turned and looked at Harry.
“Enter,” replied Lucius, reminding Harry of Malfoy.
“Here,” Draco placed them down on the long dining table. “We’re unable to properly communicate. At first, we sent letters updating each other on certain situations. But my father started to suspect some members of the ministry were up to no good, and letters became far too risky. Instead, we resorted to ribbons to communicate.”
And Draco was not losing Harry again.
“I just wish I could have had a normal childhood,” said Harry candidly. “I went from my parent’s death, to be my aunt and uncle’s waiter, to be Harry Potter, the boy who defeated Voldemort. Twice.” Shaking his head, Harry looked down to the floor.
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” said Harry angrily as he stormed after him in the streets of Knockturn Alley. This place always scared him. It reminded him of when he was only twelve and accidentally ended up there. The figures that he saw still sometimes haunted his dreams, and he didn’t want to relive that today.
“We’re warning you again,” another man stepped forwards. It was the same man who he’d had a meeting with all those months ago in his office. The day Harry had saved him.
“How’s he doing?” asked Harry.
“I’m glad you think so, Theo.”
“Are you going to let me in?” asked Malfoy impatiently. Moving to the side, Harry watched as Malfoy gracefully swept into the room. He was clothed in a long black cloak, held together with an ‘M’ pin. It took Harry a few seconds before he closed the door.
“And how is it cursed?” asked Mr Borgin curiously, placing the ball back down onto its stand.
And then, the gentleman’s fist collided with Draco’s cheekbone, knocking him to the floor. His mouth filled with blood and he spat it out, trying to keep consciousness. He looked over his shoulder and saw the five men all walking away, not looking back, and they disappeared into the shadows of Knockturn Alley.
Though, spending time with her, had Harry thinking that she was extremely lonely. The hobbies she had delved herself into were very time consuming, especially without the use of magic, and she constantly chatted away to Harry. There were hours it would just be Narcissa talking, and she didn’t even notice, but Harry didn’t mind. The stories she told about her and Bellatrix as children entertained him, even the stories of how she and Lucius met.
“They aren’t,” said Harry matter-of-factly, gripping Draco’s hand for comfort. “In fact, they know everything about us.”
“Well, you’re not. You’re just my butler. That’s all you are. That’s all you can be. And that’s all you will be.”
“I know you, Malfoy, even if you act like I don’t. This is dangerous territory. If your father found out-”
Draco.
“No, it’s not,” said Malfoy suddenly, causing Ron to look at him in shock. “Listen, I’m finished for the day. I’m going to spend some time with Astoria. Why don’t you both go to St Mungo’s and visit George?”
“What’s wrong? You gonna be sick?” hiccupped Harry as he sat up too, placing a hand on the lower of Malfoy’s back gently, just in case. Shaking his head, Malfoy turned his head to face Harry.
Harry’s heart sank seeing him this way. Without saying anything, he reached forward and slowly ran his fingers through Draco’s, now matted, white-blonde hair. It had been two days since Astoria’s death, and he hadn’t moved from the bed since. Hadn’t eaten, and Harry was almost certain he hadn’t even drunk anything.
“My old friends,” greeted Malfoy excitedly, standing from his seat. He had placed himself at the head of the table, with Astoria on his left and Pansy on his right. “I’m so thrilled to have you here tonight, it has been far too long since we all last saw each other. I am delighted to see my friends here with their partners, and I am also thankful to have my wife Astoria by my side for this dinner. I would also like to take a moment to thank Potter, as shocking as it may seem. So thank you, Harry, for helping me today and for… Everything,” Malfoy took a few seconds, “I hope everyone enjoys their night!”
“I have an artefact I need to sell,” responded Malfoy coolly, putting a hand into the inside pocket of his cloak and pulling out the shrunken object, which was still wrapped in the silk cloth. Malfoy put it down gently and tapped his wand off it and everyone watched it grow back to it’s normal size. Mr Borgin slowly removed the cloth, his smile growing even bigger, which Harry didn’t think was possible, when he saw what was underneath. The deep purple crystal ball glimmered in the light.
His mother, who died protecting Harry.
Laughing, Malfoy shook his head once again, staring at the trees in the distance. “That’s the thing though, Harry. I can’t do that. I must follow orders, keep up a front, act as though I’m okay. I must pretend my demons aren’t constantly resurfacing, like I don’t have nightmares every night. Every time I get dressed, I see the Dark Mark sitting on my arm, a constant reminder of all the mistakes I made. I try to rub it off, I try to use magic, but nothing works. It permanently resides there, staring at me, forcing me to remember my best, forcing me to relive that fear.”
“It’s been a long time.”
“You want to do
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” he said. There was a sincerity in his voice, and after sniffing, Harry realised he was crying. “I wanted to stop him.”
“No, you’re not. You just need to stand up for yourself.”
Harry settled on the armchair that sat next to the sofa Malfoy was on, watching him carefully.
Hermione and Ron had arrived a while after Harry and Malfoy, Harry already slightly buzzed from the alcohol. He was excited to see his friends and gave them both big hugs. Although they were confused as to why he was there with Malfoy on his day off, they didn’t ask any questions, as this was one of the first times they had seen Harry having fun in a long time.
“Never you mind that,” said Harry shyly, “we’re just friends.”
“Yes, with you.”
she knows, Harry. She’s the reason I know. She found out when you came back after you had disappeared from the party. He told her everything, Harry. She knows
Harry hadn’t thought of that. Malfoy too reminded him of the good days. There was nowhere he felt more at home than Hogwarts, and he hadn’t felt that in a long time. But there was comfort in being around Malfoy, because he missed those days too. Ron and Hermione had grown up, gotten married, had children. Ginny was a professional Quidditch player, she enjoyed her life. Everyone else he had become friends with at Hogwarts had gotten married, or gotten a different job, or weren’t affected by Lucius’ orders.
“Surer than I have been in a very long time,” said Draco, giving Hermione a small nod and smile.
“Fetch me the paperwork from my father’s office.” He didn’t even look up when he spoke. Harry exited the dark room and made his way over to Lucius’ office.
The two arrived at St Mungo’s not long after. Nerves built up in Harry’s stomach as they walked along the sleek corridors, heading to the mind healing facility. He didn’t want to go in, he didn’t want to see George there, the guilt resided in him consistently.
“Ever since you arrived, I started to feel differently about her. I would look at you from across the room and my heart would flutter. I would tell myself it was nothing, shake myself off, but then you would pour my water. The closeness gave me butterflies. I would see you standing outside my office and I wanted to talk to you. Just talk. You made me realise I only married Astoria to please my parents, to carry on the family name, to live a somewhat normal life after the war. To bring a child into this world without the burden of Vol-” Malfoy looked down at his arms and began to rub where the dark mark lay. “Voldemort. Without the ideas of muggleborns and pure bloods being different. Without everything my father taught me. But then you came back into my life, and I realised that after all these years, all I ever wanted was you.”
“You were what?”
“You should’ve seen it before,” laughed Harry, sitting on his bed, which creaked with every movement. He kept it underneath the window, though it was at an awkward angle, just in case another storm brewed, and he could watch it, imagining that Malfoy was watching it, too.
Switching on the lamp next to him and putting on his glasses, Harry sat up in his bed. Now his heart was racing. Was this some sort of spell he hadn’t known of yet? One that was keeping tabs on Harry? Had someone found him, one of Lucius’ followers?
Harry finally released her and they both sat back down at the table. Ron got up to order her a drink.
Malfoy looked around the room he’d walked into, then turned to Harry. “This is exactly how I expected it to be.”
“I told them when I first arrived here. I was expecting a complete bollocking from Mrs Weasley, but she accepted it. You will be fine.”
Harry’s breath hitched in his throat and all he could hear was a ringing in his ears. He didn’t know how to respond, whether Draco actually meant that he was in love with Harry.
!” in an odd accent as he waved his wand.
“No. Of course I don’t. He’s staff. Astoria’s my wife.”
Back at the manor, Harry noticed that Malfoy was still sleepy as he stood clumsily. Without thinking, Harry put an arm around Malfoy, helping him to keep his balance.
Ron and Hermione were now on the bed, too. Hermione lay on the other side of Draco, stroking his hair softly, while Ron took hold of his other hand.
It had been a long and difficult week for Harry. The thoughts of George had haunted him every moment of the day, reminding him that it was his fault George was like that. Ron had requested leave from work to help take care of George, who according to Ron, wasn’t getting any better.
“What, the sun?”
“I’ll go back to my room, then,” said Harry, standing up. He took a moment to look at Malfoy, who in return continued watching him, his cool grey eyes never looking away. “It’s actually been nice getting to know you, Malfoy. You’re not all bad yourself.”
There was a loud pop behind them, and then a clatter of stones. They both jumped and turned around, to see Malfoy lay on the stones, his body exhausted, his face bleeding.
“If you don’t stop misbehaving, you won’t get any pudding,” Mr Weasley grinned at the kids. “And today it’s grandma’s famous chocolate cake.” The kids instantly stopped messing about. Mr Weasley knew how much those two loved Mrs Weasley’s chocolate cake. Hermione looked at him gratefully.
“George?” asked Harry, placing the glass of water down as his hand shook too much to hold it steady.
“I don’t know how you can bloody tell,” whispered Ron, shaking his head. “He’s always like that. He’s always been completely silent.”
“Lucky you,” said Ron, putting the drink in front of Ginny and flopping down next to Hermione. “It’s a mixed bag with Malfoy. He’s either silent all day or angry all day.”
“You’re worried,” Harry pointed out, reading her body language. Usually Hermione stood tall and proud, her chin up, but now she was hunched over, wrapping her arms around herself in a hug. She stared at Harry for a few moments.
“Because, Potter,” started Malfoy with obvious irritation, “these are all dark artefacts.”
As he gazed out of the window, he couldn’t help but wonder if Draco was also watching the storm.
“How are you, George?” asked Harry.
“I am,” he finally responded, shooting her a sad smile. At this point, Hermione was once again fussing over Ron, who was quite obviously in such a terrible mood. Harry watched them, an adoring smile tugging at his thin lips. Ron and Hermione were such a perfect couple, even though the first few years of their friendship was extremely rocky. Their relationship had blossomed since the battle of Hogwarts, and they’d been nothing but strong ever since. They’d since had children, one boy and one girl, and they were the sweetest kids that Harry had ever come across. Unfortunately, though, the kids had to stay with Molly Weasley while Ron and Hermione were here at the Manor.
Malfoy turned and looked at Harry. His green eyes glinted in the dim candlelight. They were warm, inviting, nothing like how they were back at Hogwarts. Back then, they only looked at Malfoy with hatred, with anger, with resentment. But now they searched deep into Malfoy’s face, watching, and analysing, his every move, trying to take something away from every conversation they had, every facial expression Malfoy pulled.
“Nothing, sir,” replied Ron, attempting to stand tall. Shaking his head, Harry decided to explain.
“Draco,” said Harry gently, placing a hand on his shoulder from behind. Jumping, Draco spun round to face the shorter man.
Back to work again. After working the shift on Sunday, Harry was definitely not in the mood for this. One day was not long enough to be away from this job, not even two was.
“Harry Potter!” Mrs Weasley yelled as she gripped tightly to him, “you had us all absolutely worried sick.”
“I’d done some reading into muggle history. There was a spy ring called the Culper Ring, which was in the American Revolutionary war. They did this to share information on the British Army to Washington. They would send out pre-arranged signals. For example, a woman would hang a black petticoat on her washing line which meant Brewster, one of the spies, was arriving in his whaleboat.
“He wants to send all muggleborns to the workhouses,” said Ron. It took Harry a moment to understand, to realise what it would affect if that was implemented. Then, he looked up at the girl who sat before him, who now seemed so small, so delicate.
Loud wails sounded from the man as he buried his head into Harry’s chest, grabbing onto his shirt in desperation, as if he was afraid that if he didn’t, Harry would disappear.
“Salazar, Potter!” shouted Malfoy, rushing to his side and placing a hand on his back.
“That sounds excellent,” said Caractacus excitedly, watching Draco place it back in the box.
What he decided to pick up was a large notebook, which was nearly completely filled. Slowly, Draco flipped through the pages, checking over the work he had tirelessly done. Pages upon pages of logs, provided with proof, everything dated.
“What?”
Harry’s mind swam with possibilities. What if Malfoy was attempting to take over the ministry himself, just to implement more torturous activities towards squibs and muggleborns? What if Malfoy was saving up to move away, far, far away, and leave Harry behind?
“Try harder!” Malfoy turned around, squaring up to Harry in anger. “I don’t pay you to dawdle. You do what I say, when I say it.”
“Georgie!” grinned Ron as George spotted the two men. Getting up, George held out his arms and gave Ron a big hug.
“You’re part of the family, Harry,” Mr Weasley said, placing a hand to the back of Harry’s neck as they walked in. “George would want to see you as much as all of us.”
The food arrived quickly, and the group started eating. Hermione and Astoria chatted away happily; Ron always seemed happy with the fact the two women got along well. He’d tell Harry while they were stood outside Malfoy’s office that Hermione was always excited to tell Ron about her day, about the conversations she and Astoria had, and he could never understand how she had so much fun. Both the men knew Hermione was a very chatty person, very confident, she could be friends with anyone. Astoria liked that about Hermione, and agreed with Hermione’s ideas, which made the two friends.
“I’m fine, sir,” responded Harry, attempting to keep professional. He didn’t want to be seen as weak, especially not after having to take up this job, especially not in front of Malfoy.
?” Harry nearly laughed. The Malfoy family despised muggles and always attempted to keep as far away from them as possible. Suddenly Malfoy turned, glaring at Harry, his eyebrows furrowed.
“Ronald,” Hermione inputted, shaking her head. “Please, not at the table.”
Malfoy turned and looked at Harry. “Do you know what my father has asked me to do? Obliviate a Squib. He wants proof that I can take over the ministry once he retires, he wants me to prove myself to him as his son. I don’t want to do it, Harry. I’m scared.”
“Why?” Harry tried to not sound disappointed, as Malfoy was his boss.
Then, the figure of a wolf revealed itself. Slowly, it approached Harry, staring directly at him in the eyes.
“I’d never have imagined Malfoy to be sitting at my kitchen table,” laughed George with a mischievous grin.
“What are you going to tell him?” asked Harry nervously. Astoria shot a look at him, there was worry in her eyes.
Harry looked up at him. There was a form of sincerity in Malfoy’s face, his eyes looked sorrowful, but not sad. The gleeful twinkle from when they were in the storm was still there. Harry could get lost in his eyes easily.
Harry disapparated.
“Hello to you too,” grumbled Ron.
“Lucius,” Narcissa tried again but Lucius shot her a glare.
They sat down at a table, trying to decide on what to have for lunch. The kids were as restless as ever, constantly arguing with each other. At one point Hugo pulled Rose’s hair, causing her to squeal, and for Hermione to get stern with them.
After a few moments, Harry re-entered the bedroom. The guest bedroom at the Weasley’s house.
“Plenty of times,” said Harry, bewildered.
Draco’s hand dropped down from his sleeve and into his hand. A flash of despair ran through his body as he realised, he couldn’t get help.
They were back at the loch. The sky was pitch black, the stars twinkling above them. Harry could see Draco’s constellation. He always could see it, now. It was the first thing he searched for when looking into the night sky.
“Their world is so different to ours. I envy it, sometimes, it seems so much simpler,” Malfoy waved his hand at Harry. “Hurry up and get dressed.”
“It’s been far too long, Mrs Weasley, I’m sorry about that,” said Harry once they finally released their grip.
“Why?” pondered Harry, sipping his butterbeer. Mixing drinks was never a good idea for Harry, but he was having fun and truly did not care. The buzz made his head fuzzy and his vision blurred, sometimes he forgot that he was still wearing his glasses, but he liked it. The numb feeling it gave him, how it made him uncontrollably laugh, how he felt free from any anxiety or memories that he constantly tried to suppress with failure.
“Yes sir,” said Harry, causing Malfoy’s grin to get wider, before he headed back to his room. He and Malfoy had been spending more time together, purely platonic, but the closer they got the more Harry felt butterflies. Would it have been like this back when they were eleven?
As Harry left, it seemed the day got gloomier and the rain got heavier.
“You need to continue your work, Malfoy, you cannot stop. Not now. We’re close.”
“You’ve run away?” exclaimed George, his eyes widened, “isn’t that illegal?”
Butterflies danced around his stomach. This was it. This was the feeling he could never have with Ginny. This was the moment he longed for his whole life. Electricity is what you feel when you know they’re the one, they say, and Harry felt it. He could feel the electricity coursing through his veins just from the touch of Malfoy’s hand to his cheek, the other gripping Harry’s hair tightly.
“Oh, don’t make me say it,” sighed Malfoy, then frowned as Harry’s expression didn’t change. “I can’t. I don’t love her in…
“What does that mean?” asked Harry.
But it seemed their relationship had become too strained to be able to have a decent conversation now.
“But I’m here. I’m always going to be here.”
Dragging himself out of the bed, Harry put on his slippers and grabbed a towel, slinging it over his shoulder then picked up his toothbrush and toothpaste. He sauntered his way to the shared bathrooms, nodding his hellos to Ron Weasley on his way.
Harry walked down the dark corridors that twisted and winded around the manor. When he first arrived, he’d constantly get lost in these halls, unsure which turn to take next. They were like a maze. But now it was muscle memory, he knew exactly where to go to get to where he needed to be. He swore he could do it with his eyes closed.
Ron answered instead. “Lucius is so angry about you leaving that he says he’s going to change some rules until you’re found. Make things more tough so people will be more likely to try and find you.”
Crookshanks had spent hours finding the perfect rabbit, its body was lush and he could tell by the tang of blood that the rabbit meat would be almost perfect. He was very proud of this catch, it wasn't often that Crookshanks tried to catch live food. It was no secret living inside had made him fat and lazy.
Draco was an absolute disaster. His father would NEVER have this. The poor man was probably rolling in his grave. His mother? She was so fragile these days he didn't know how she would take the news. That's only if he actually told her anyway.
The tears fell one after another, dampening his face. Attempting to quieten his sobs hurt his whole body. He couldn’t be weak, not now.
“You’re literally staring at me,” responded Harry. Rolling his eyes, Malfoy opened the bathroom door and beckoned at him to enter it.
“My own son. My own flesh and blood. Betraying me?” Lucius tutted and began to pull his wand from the cane. “You should know better.”
Palms starting to sweat, Harry squinted at the corner of the room where the beam of light had been. There was no longer a trace of it, not even a flicker, but Harry couldn’t rest.
“There are things I cannot tell you, Harry. If I did, it would destroy everything.”
“Draco,” whispered Astoria, but before she could say anything else, Malfoy stood up – knocking his chair over in the process – and quickly rushed out of the room.
“I’ll order ours, too,” said Harry, giving the group a small smile before getting up and heading to the bar. Malfoy was visibly angry, his shaking hands were grasping the edge of the table, his injured knuckles turning white. The skin on his knuckles seemed worse than Harry had ever seen them.
Without saying anything else, Malfoy turned briskly on his heel and continued walking at a quick pace. Harry inaudibly groaned, the pain in his head now reaching his eyes, his stomach churning with every step he took.
Draco’s breathing had become slow and steady. Moving slowly, Harry looked down at the pale face that lay beneath his. Draco’s eyes were shut, his mouth very slightly open. He was asleep.
“All I could see was Dumbledore staring back at me, telling me I’m a good person, that I can be helped. I don’t want this, Harry, I don’t want this life!” His breathing was rugged, he clutched his chest as he struggled to draw another breath, choking on his tears.
Malfoy swallowed. “What have I done, father?”
“Me neither,” he finally said, almost breathlessly. Suddenly Malfoy sat up, swaying as he did, and stared at the floor.
Nodding, Harry followed George outside the burrow. Since Harry’s last visit, a garden bench had been placed outside the front door. It must be for George to watch the sunset on, thought Harry, as he noticed the sun was beginning to rise right in front of them. Both the men sat down in silence on the bench and watched the sun slowly enter the sky.
“You mean Snape’s curse?” pondered Malfoy, walking closer to Harry. Slowly he put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, causing Harry to jump and spin round. He seemed so much taller now, or maybe Harry just felt small.
“That’s a classic.”
As Harry’s thumb started to move across Malfoy’s hand, he felt raised skin. He pulled the hand closer to his face so he could see. There were scars slicing across his hand, down to his wrist and up to his fingertips.
“Sorting out her threads,” said Ron with a chuckle as the staff started to tidy away the cutlery, “what an easy job you have now, Harry.”
“Better now you’re here,” slowly Draco managed to sit himself up, but took hold of Harry’s hand, as if he was terrified Harry would disapparate again.
“I can deal with those consequences, Potter,” replied Malfoy, waving his wand, making the doors shut in Harry’s face.
“Enter,” replied Malfoy. Harry stepped in.
“I’m okay,” said Harry genuinely, with a small nod. “I wasn’t when I first got here. But it’s getting easier.”
“No,” laughed Harry as he passed the pure malt whiskey over to Malfoy. “I dated a few people back in Hogwarts, like Cho and I took Parvarti to the Yule ball,” Harry rambled on. “There were girls I had crushes on and I guess guys too, I just didn’t know it yet.”
After everything that happened with Lucius, Harry had been sent to work for Narcissa. Lucius, of course, wanted Narcissa to use Harry as her personal servant, ordering him to do everything for her so she didn’t have to lift a finger.
“The alcohol should stop that,” said George with a chuckle, “I saw him knocking them back.”
“How are you and Astoria?” asked Harry after a while. Malfoy seemed to tense up, his eyes staring out of the window, watching the small amount of bodies passing by.
Then he worried about Malfoy, much to his surprise. He’d wondered if he’d gotten to bed okay, if his father had found out he’d been drinking, if he was upset, if he was eating right. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Malfoy eating more than just a few bites of toast. Thoughts swirled around his mind, shouting at him, wanting him to get out of bed and go to Malfoy’s room to check up on him. Harry had never felt this way about Malfoy before, it was new, and it consumed him.
Harry decided to not ask any further questions. Instead, he waved his hand towards the sofa, inviting Malfoy to sit down. The tall, slender figure moved to the sofa, looking at it for a few moments, before hesitantly sitting.
“Well, I helped him the other day, didn’t I?” said Harry as he prodded his fork to his eggs.
“What’s wrong?” asked Harry, walking over to Ron with Hermione following closely behind.
“Harry, mate!” said Ron, to which Hermione shushed him.
Harry always dreamed of that. Those were the days he truly knew who he was, especially after he left and became an Auror. He’d always think back to those days when he needed to escape. The times he and his friends were in the great hall, eating a delicious dinner and having a laugh together. The times in classes when he’d get things right and would be awarded five points for his house, earning him beams from Ron and Hermione. The times after the battle, when he was training to be an Auror, he and Ron. They’d stay up late studying, help each other out in the field, and when they both graduated and became Aurors, life seemed to be falling in place. Harry was happy, even if his relationship with Ginny crumbled, even though he realised he was…
“Are you ready, Lord Malfoy?”
“I am afraid that my learned friend is reading in double-meanings where none exist,” Lucius said smoothly. “The provision he refers to would merely permit the reclamation of important wizarding sites lost in witch hunts and other aggressive Muggle incursions into our way of life. Further, it would compel anyone taking such action to provide a similar accommodation for the dispossessed.”
“You are not going anywhere!” Draco’s face was full of fire and fury. “You are mine!”
