„Morning,“ Ron mumbled over a doughnut he was chewing. Crumbs and sugar sprayed the mountain of case files on his desk.
What are they on about? Ron thought. He slowly opened the door and entered the room silently. Unfortunately, he froze completely as soon as he noticed the scene unfolding in front of his eyes.
"Did he tell you how he and Theo find the Sources? How do they dispose of them?" Hermione asked in quick succession.
„I will leave you to process the news. A nurse will be back later to administer a pain relief potion. You should be able to go home in the evening,“ the doctor said, then excused himself politely and left the room, closing the door silently behind him.
"You are here for me, as much as I'm here for you," Harry whispered and ran his fingers through her hair reassuringly. "I'll always be here for you."
"Do you have it on you? I know we're not allowed to carry it, as it's a piece of unsanctioned equipment but I would feel better knowing that you were safe," Harry paused, looking around carefully to make sure no one was eavesdropping.
"Auror Potter," Robards reprimanded him but his expression remained grim. "In and out, wait for the negotiator."
"I got carried away when I thought you wouldn't help me. I need to help Hermione! I wasn't lying when I said her research was important," Harry replied defensively. Deep down, he knew Malfoy was right and he felt shame prickle in his stomach all the more for it.
First of all, please don't take any of this as an excuse because what I did is inexcusable. I hope you will see the letter for what it is - my deepest apology.
"Help me," Harry motioned Nott forward. Theo ran over to him, they joined their forces and aimed spell after spell on the weakened section of the wall.
"Of course I was," Potter bristled. "I know what a flashlight is. I just wanted to know what it's for!"
„Harry, I can‘t lose you, promise me I won‘t lose you over this,“ Draco asked suddenly, his voice barely reaching Harry.
"Of course it's your fault! If you had stayed with her, none of this would have happened," Ron shouted.
There were at least fifteen hostages, huddled up in a group down the far side of the Main Hall. Draco spotted two wizards standing near the hostages, apparently guarding them. They were luckily facing away from Draco and they hadn't spotted him. There were shouts coming from farther down the Hall where Draco knew the entrance to the Vaults lay. Draco evaluated the situation. If he managed to disarm the two wizards, he could move the hostages to the Entrance Hall, barricade the door and protect them from there until the reinforcements arrived.
"There's a Lurker, a Shade, a Stone Knocker, and my personal favourite, a Stalker. Which one do you want to start with?" Malfoy raised his eyebrows in a challenge.
They were one of the first Aurors on the scene. Robards was already there, issuing commands to Aurors Smith and Nott. Potter rushed over to Robards with Draco at his heels.
Harry kept his head bowed. "What do you think? You basically just laughed in my face after I… You could have at least let me down nicely."
Harry's voice was deep and sultry. Every word he sang resonated deep down in Draco's chest. For a second he hated the guy Harry was surely thinking about while pronouncing those syllables. Why had Harry insisted on Draco seeing this?
At that moment Draco's Patronus, a silvery fox, jumped through the bronze door and wound its tail around Harry's ankle. STILL ALIVE. DON'T SEND PATRONUS BACK. CAREFUL, THEY SEE THROUGH DISILLUSIONMENT.
„I don‘t want to hide from him! We‘re going to play right where he is! He has no right to usurp the best flying space. It's not fair he always gets here earlier than us! Just because the dungeons are close to the Entrance Hall while we have to walk all the way up to the Griffindor tower to get changed!“ Harry was gesticulating wildly with his arms while talking, holding his broom between his thighs.
He was patted on the shoulder by Weasley one. "See you at work, mate." With that, he eyed Draco wearily and nodded at him. Draco nodded back. Weasley disappeared in a flash of bright green flames.
Harry was standing in front of the mirror in a bathroom close to Draco‘s hospital room. Harry turned the tap and let the water run cold. He splashed some over his face, trying to get his emotions in check. His hands were shaking again. He stared at his reflection in the mirror. His eyes seemed huge in his face, now that he‘d taken off his glasses, and a little lost. The expression on his face seemed familiar, it reminded him of someone but he couldn‘t quite place whom. Then it hit him. Draco had worn an identical expression, years ago, in the bathroom on the sixth floor of Hogwarts castle. The fear in his eyes, the helplessness, just before Harry nearly killed him with the Sectumsempra spell. Just before his blood started seeping out of his wounds.
"But I saved him a seat," Harry whimpered as if that alone was going to conjure Malfoy out of thin air.
Draco inserted a bookmark between the pages of the book and closed it. He grabbed Harry's hand and let himself be pulled up into Harry's embrace.
"Haha, very funny. I told you before I left not to let him go alone. I know you hate going out at night but if something happens to him and neither of us is there…" Theo left the sentence unfinished.
“You’re actually saying that like you’re any better.” Draco comments lightly, and Hermione nods in mock seriousness. “But enough with the festivities. We have to get going if we want to avoid the crowds. We’ll be off, Granger.” He nods swiftly, and before Harry can do anything more than look up in confusion and let out an involuntary
Harry takes in a sharp breath. “Oh.” But he thinks of what he’d overheard the other day, and he’s suddenly confused. Surely Draco wasn’t lying, but that didn’t explain why no one, including himself, didn't know about it.
Draco clears his throat, but the woman continues to gently rock back and forth, her eyes closed and oblivious. Harry bites back a laugh as Draco, shooting him a glare, reaches out tentatively and taps her shoulder.
“Could you at least tell us to whom it was sold?” Draco pleads. “Our uncle would be so devastated, and we would hate to let him down. Perhaps we could strike a deal with the buyers.”
“It really was quite adorable how you finished each other’s sentences. Keep up the good teamwork!” She winks.
“Well, I like to think of myself as a rather responsible and put-together adult—“ Harry snorts, and Draco smarts, affronted.
As they step out into the backyard, Harry wipes his brow in exhaustion. “If that wasn’t the most challenging task in my entire career—heck, my entire lifetime. I’m starting to miss searching for Horcruxes and fighting legions of giants.”
“You could’ve explained the situation a bit more clearly. You could’ve used, oh, I don’t know, maybe
Teeny’s wide eyes well up in tears, and she sniffles, before pulling out a groggy, discolored handkerchief and blowing her nose into it noisily. She hiccups pitifully. “Mister Malfoy must not…” Another hiccup. “He must not be so kind to the house-elves.”
The merry jingle of the bells signal their arrival and the barman, Leo, looks up. At first, Harry’s confused as to why he merely grunts and gestures to the empty seats, but he remembers he looks like a mini Weasley and stops himself from cracking the corny jokes he normally saved for these trips.
Draco knocks again, and the wide eye emerges again, this time accompanied by a glimpse of a big, pointy ear. “Hello, er…”
. We had to provide her with a lifetime supply of Calming Droughts after you told her you were going to perform the Dementor’s Kiss on her.” She rolls her eyes. “No objections?”
“Are you sure?” Harry asks dubiously, eyeing the bucket. “It might be stuck in there somewhere. Could you possibly take another look—“
“Very.” Harry presses a chaste kiss onto Draco’s chin, relishing in the way the color floods his cheeks instantly, and pulls back reluctantly. A question forms in his mind. “Oh, wait. Was the, er, name-calling intentional too?”
“Because I get jealous really easily.” Draco replies, crossing his arms. “So what do you have to say?”
Harry's head is spinning out of control, spiraling and whirring. He scowls. “So is this some sort of
“Behold, the mystifying powers of alcohol,” Harry mutters, before speaking to her clearly, “We—I—need you to tell us where your Young Master is.”
“Be nice, Blaise. Potter, we won’t destroy you, we’ll just secretly murder you.” Theo says, grinning, carrying a platter with several teacups on it and placing it on the table in front of them. He looks up at and gapes. “What on Earth is Malfoy
“Erm, Teeny?” She ignores him, continuing to belch out disturbing lyrics. He waves a hand in front of her eyes, and she blinks slowly.
“Well, there were a few misses in his speech, but yes, ‘Mione, don’t you think…” He trails off, in search of a better way to phrase his thoughts.
“I can cook,” Harry volunteers. “I spent the first half of my life doing nothing but chores from washing dishes to scrubbing floors.”
Harry wraps both his arms around Draco’s waist, burying his face into his back. He smiles as he feels Draco flinch, surprised. Considering how brave and blasé a front he usually had on, the smallest, subtlest gestures elicited the cutest reactions out of him. His voice muffled, he replies “I didn’t know
“Ow!” Harry exclaimed, crashing into Draco’s back as he stopped abruptly, gesturing for him to be quiet.
Harry bites his lip but returns with another glass, which he sets down in front of Teeny cautiously, contemplating warning her about downing too much of it—but she grabs it, squealing excitedly, and gulps it down hungrily. Thankfully, her alarming pace seems to slow down a little, and Harry turns to Draco—except he has his head on the table, face sweaty and flushed pink, smiling stupidly.
Harry tries to pry the tissues out of Draco’s hand, but he continues to dab fretfully, eyebrows pulled together in concentration and biting his lip, looking adorably distressed. Harry shifts as Draco’s knees dig into his thighs, choosing to focus his gaze on the intricate carvings adorning Draco’s wand, but finding it trailing back to Draco—more specifically, his face, and even more specifically, his lips, which he was now running his tongue along nervously.
Blaise appears in the doorway, grumbling and shoving a couple of shiny coins into Theo’s outstretched palm. His eyes land on Harry and he scoffs. “How do we know it’s you, Potter? Your cute little scar is showing under that hideous mop of flaming hair.” He motions to his forehead, and Harry touches it self-consciously. "Also, we were expecting you."
“You mean when,” Harry intones darkly, but rises from his chair and heads for the door, Draco following him close behind.
, I should’ve gotten the Hawaiian cocktails instead—“ He rushes over to Harry, a fistful of tissues clenched in his left hand and his wand dangling from his right, and practically sits on his lap. Ignoring—or simply not noticing—the stifled sounds of panic Harry’s making, he starts dabbing frantically at the red blooming in flowery shapes almost directly over Harry’s chest.
always thought the pair of you would be an intriguing match, what with your history and all—“ she clears her throat at Harry’s incredulous look, “But I’m glad, I really am.”
, not smirking or sneering or twisting his face up into the typical contorted expression he claimed was
“What you’re trying to say is, you used to be a human house-elf,” Draco snickers, striding into the room, and Harry rolls his eyes.
Draco nods hesitantly and takes a sip of his own drink. Teeny seems to sway, dazed, and lets out a loud belch followed by a giggle. “Teeny is liking this drink, sir!” She gulps down the rest of the bottle and bangs it down on the table, grinning widely. “Could Teeny have some more, Mister Mc… McBee?”
“I can hear you, you know,” Draco comments, standing up and stretching. “But I would rather not start any new arguments, seeing as we’re going to be stuck with each other for the rest of the day, or possibly even longer.” He shudders.
Harry swivels his head to his left, where Draco is gently rocking back and forth, his arms wrapped around his knees, humming serenely.
“Really? The frying pan?” Draco mutters under his breath, but continues to stir anyway. Harry bites back a sheepish grin, but he suddenly notices Draco’s warm breath ghosting on the back of his neck and freezes. It was too much. Harry could duel renounced Dark wizards and break into Gringotts and survive a myriad of encounters with beasts even Hagrid would find not so much cute as terrifying—but he could not just stay there, while Draco Malfoy’s platinum locks brushed against his ears as he leaned over to check the state of the batter and his soft
“Careful, Potter. Wouldn’t want you to rip custom-made designer clothing.” He says dryly, scanning his surroundings.
“By help he means that I berated, chided and scolded him for insisting on doing things the Muggle way and wasting so much valuable resources.”
Harry shifts to the other side, but Draco starts to pout, and he quickly decides he can’t handle him pouting—not when he looks so adorable and so freaking helpless. Harry, with great effort and sacrifice, closes his eyes, willing himself to count sheep in his mind, picture a calming beach with the waves lapping against the sand—anything but letting his attention wander over to Draco still caressing and attempting to tame his hair and messing it up even worse. He’s finally settled on thinking about the warm, laughter-filled nights he’d spent with Hermione and Ron last summer, curled up on armchairs and eating Mrs. Weasley’s scrumptious home-cooked meals every day—
A familiar drawl rings in Harry’s ears, and he jolts awake, scrambling for his glasses and pushing them onto his face. His vision clears, and he pushes himself into an upright position, bunching the covers around his torso protectively.
, because now he was desperately attempting to block out mental images of snogging Draco Malfoy, and his face was heating up, and Draco’s fingers were causing strange tingling sensations to spread throughout his entire body and he was feeling delirious and wobbly and dizzy—
Harry thought the day couldn’t possibly get better once Draco had said yes—but it had just gotten so, so much better.
and sips his Butterbeer. Draco called him a baby for ordering it when they first came in, but Harry lets his gaze rove over the messy blonde hair and flushed grin, sneaking a peek at the patch of creamy, pale skin exposed right at the tip of his collarbone, and smirks.
. And I’m only addressing this to you because you’re the only one here who hasn’t picked up on this yet and I’m feeling particularly sympathetic today.”
Harry gapes, and he notices Draco’s mouth is hanging open, too. He leans over and mutters, “Guess we didn’t see
“All in the same year, in case you were wondering.” Draco adds, smiling. He suddenly frowns. “Also, Potter, don’t insult my hoop like that. It was my most prized possession when I was a wee little child.”
been greater, stronger, and better a man than he ever was, and he was only now discovering it. He was scared to tell you about the Time-Turner, scared you’d continue to push yourself even when he was gone, scared you’d be unable to throw away the expectations he’d forced upon you and, yes, go ahead with the plan. He was scared for you, Draco—he wanted to protect you.” Theo gently closes the lid of the box, sliding it over the table. “He loved you.”
They sit down and scarf down their meals in companionable silence, the clattering of cutlery and Theo’s occasional remarks (“The maple syrup is fucking
Ron gawks. “You mean the time he started pulling out all my socks and burying his nose in them because apparently, my feet smelled ‘exceptionally glorious’?”
Harry glances around suspiciously, wondering when Draco will come back, but shakes his hand. “Harry.” He sees Ethan’s eyes flicker up to his forehead and he pushes his hair back, rolling his eyes. “Potter.”
Their feet hit solid ground, and Draco immediately lets go of Harry’s arm. Harry breathes out a sigh of relief, but frowns when he feels a flicker of disappointment following it.
“I wish I could, but we’ve got to get going, the dance floor looks so sad and abandoned,” Ron says, not sounding the least bit apologetic. He mouths something that looks a lot like
“For instance, Harry has a track record to be slightly too lenient with criminals—and don’t bother arguing, Harry, I know that you removed the chains from a serial killer because he couldn’t pick up the slice of pepperoni pizza you decided to buy him.”
“It’s time to find out then, no?” She gets up from behind the desk, waking up Crookshanks, who had been dozing off in her lap, and sending him hissing angrily at the interruption. She leans down to soothe him, and he twitches his tail and brushes up against her legs. She looks up and smirks. “Don’t worry. I’ll send help if one of you manage to kill the other.”
“No! NO!” To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy hurries over, levitating the flower pot and moving it to the far end of the room, next to a portrait of a dozing lady donned in elegant, flowery fabric. A kitten is curled up on her lap, and she yawns, murmuring, “Oh, sweet baby, it must be our neighbors next door again. Let’s go back to sleep.”
Harry gives him a dubious look but slowly makes his way out and up the stairs, guessing Draco’s locked himself in the guest bedroom. He knocks, but he doesn’t get a response.
The house-elf glances around surreptitiously before whispering, in a barely audible voice, “Teeny, sir.”
Harry rolls his eyes but picks up the plates, letting the other two float behind him, and treads into the dining room. He sets the plates down, grinning, and Draco walks in, a trail of forks, spoons, and knives floating over his head. They jump onto the table and march their way over to each placemat, and Harry raises his eyebrows, amused. “Cool trick.”
Harry and Draco look at her, at each other, then back at her. Harry curses under his breath while Draco pinches the bridge of his nose and heaves a long, agonized sigh.
“Riiiight.” Draco draws out the word, setting his glass down. “Hmm.. well, let me just—“ He twists in his chair to reach for his bag, but his elbow knocks over the glass and sends its contents flying across the table and—oh /hell/—straight onto Harry’s shirt. He groans as the vibrant red liquid soaks into the fabric, spreading rapidly, and Draco’s mouth flies open.
Draco looks down at his lap, where his hands are clasping each other, fingers intertwined and palms folded. “Yeah.” He says. “Yeah, not as in I think you’re right, Potter, but yeah, as in let’s go get that Time-Turner, bring it back to the Ministry, and blow it to bits.”
The woman cracks open an eye, sighing and sitting back up straight at the imploring look on Draco’s face. Harry glanced at him and noted that he was indeed a proficient actor—he nearly felt bad for him.
Soon enough, his vision floods with color again, and he stumbles, holding on to the hem of Draco’s robes to stay upright.
“He said he hadn’t eaten in five days!” Harry exclaims. “I know what it’s like to be painfully hungry and it would’ve been simply
He shook his head, trying to rid it of baffling questions he could never provide a satisfying answer to--along with images of a certain blond that accompanied the thoughts for mysterious reasons Harry didn’t want to know and didn’t want to think about.
RIght on cue, Slughorn comes trotting up, his hair noticeably grayer and his belly bulging even more prominently than during Harry’s Hogwarts years, but his voice remains loud and booming. “Harry! I wasn’t sure if you could make it, with you being the Savior of the Wizarding World and all--but of course, I did help you quite a bit on your journey, it wouldn’t’ve been right any other way—“ He clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, causing him to wince slightly. “How have you been doing? Bet you’re raking in money by the Galleons, eh?”
, Ronald!”) , and for once, Harry’s glad that they’re fighting, because that means they aren’t paying him any attention.
Not that Harry was counting, of course. He simply had a great watch Ron had gotten him for his birthday two years ago strapped on his wrist. And it wasn’t like he was
“Clearly.” Draco pushes himself from the wall he was leaning against and walks up to Harry, examining the cabinets and countertops with a calculating look. He bites his lip and pulls out his want, tapping it hesitantly, then mutters a few spells under his breath—and pots and pans come flying out of the drawers, landing in a neat, arranged line in front of them.
Harry pours some of it onto his hand, and feels a cool, calming sensation spreading. “That’s so much better.” He frowns. “Also, why am I Potter again?”
you were working your arse off at home for the report you told me you’d hand in on Monday.” He gives her a
“If he wanted to prank Harry by making him obsessed with him, all he needed to do was start disappearing into the Room of Requirement again. Either that or reopen the Chamber of Secrets, but I personally think the former would’ve been slightly easier,” Ron snickers. Harry adds
A slow, satisfied smile stretches across Draco’s face, much to Harry’s bewilderment, and he turns around. “Why, I think we’ve got a pretty good idea of who this young man is, Trent.” To the woman, who’s still grumbling about how this mysterious man should start looking in the market, begin exploring his options, he says politely, “Thank you so much. You have been an immense help to us today, and we will be sure to let our uncle know.”
“Bloody hell, what is in that damned bag?” He yells, sliding the leather backpack off Draco’s shoulders and sighing in relief. “That thing must have weighed at least as much as himself. I don’t know how he
“But maybe…” Harry thinks, images from the Hogwarts kitchens of a certain miserable house-elf popping up into his mind. “We could try getting her drunk.”
“He’s holding onto you just like he holds onto his stuffed lion, Francis Leopold.” Theo snickers. “He told us he’d thrown it away the instant he got sorted into Slytherin, but we’ve never seen him go to bed without it.”
“Good afternoon to you too,” Harry grumbles, just as he notices Hermione and Ron approaching in the corner of his eyes and begins to panic. Just because he had adopted an amicable relationship with the Slytherins—perhaps
“Why?” Harry forces out, his nonchalance swiftly fading when Draco runs a hand through his hair and fixes his gaze on him.
Getting Teeny to finally leave the house takes a significant amount of effort that mainly consisted of enduring her piercing wails and weeping sobs. The process required immense patience—a quality that Harry and Draco both lacked in great quantities—but the house-elf relents after nearly two hours’ worth of persuasion.
Teeny throws a final nervous look behind her, as if expecting to be chastised and dragged away any moment, but takes a deep, shuddering breath and pushes the door open, welcoming the two of them in without even looking twice at Harry.
“Granger, I know you hate me and I won’t deny that I probably hate you even more—but you love Potter, don’t you? Cut him some slack, he’s died and come back to life. He technically shouldn’t even be labeled alive! The poor bloke has gone through so, so much—“
“Not so much mean as it is true,” Harry says, shrugging. “Fighting a Dark Lord and attempting to escape near-certain death only to eventually succumb to it—well, it tends to consume a lot of your leisure time.”
Harry barely suppresses the urge to lose his temper, and decides to handle his initial task first. He faces Teeny, who’s singing what sounds like a nursery rhyme but has lyrics like
“Yeah,” Harry breathes out, but his hand hovers in the air, less than an inch away from Draco’s—and he sees his eyes flit over to it uncertainly. Refusing to break eye contact, he slowly, intimately, wraps his fingers around his wrist, the touch burning and freezing cold at once. Draco gulps, his arm trembling the slightest bit under his grip, and spurred on by the soft tremors, Harry leans over, closing the little distance between them, and presses his lips against his.
Nevertheless, Harry kept telling himself he didn’t care about how many shots Draco downed or drinks he drained. And even if he did, which he totally didn’t, it was merely because he would have a terribly difficult time trying to Apparate with a slurring, staggering Draco Malfoy grasping his arm.
out of all my previous pupils. I didn’t know if you’d make the list back when we met in your sixth year—didn’t know if you’d
like you two!” She notices that the pair of them are standing very far away from the windows, with Harry appearing as if he was trying very hard not to burst out laughing and Draco examining his fingernails, seemingly unconcerned. She gives a prim little cough. “Oh. They’re fine. I thought I heard something—well, never mind.”
“What kind of lullabies do house-elves sing to their children and why on Earth are they about stupid ways to get killed? And are house-elves all tone-deaf or is that just Teeny?” He mutters angrily under his breath, barely acknowledging Harry. “I can’t get the part about the mutant flobberworms out of my head, fucking hell.”
in surprise as Draco’s hand grips his arm, he’s sucked into utter darkness, his throat and chest squeezing painfully.
Harry gulps and treads back into the kitchen, where Draco is fussing over placing tiny blueberries perfectly on the pancakes.
“The very best,” Draco agrees, turning to Harry. He narrows his eyes, sighing exasperatedly. “You got something—“
“Then I can’t think of a better thing to be.” Draco replies, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist and pulling him closer, enveloping him in a lazy, passionate kiss and smiling--
Harry bit his lip. He was being ridiculous. He was currently broken up with Ginny, sure, but the fact that he’d dated her—held her hand, made out with her, enjoyed spending time with her in a totally non-platonic way—meant he couldn’t possibly like blokes in
Harry shrugs. “Your loss.” He pats Hermione’s shoulder and reaches for the doorknob, then pauses, frowning.
“Here.” Draco pulls into a tight, narrow alley and strides ahead, leaving Harry to scramble hurriedly behind him. Harry finds himself admiring the confidence and pride that each step carries—it wasn’t simply because Draco was a pompous, petty, rich asshole (which he undeniably and inarguably was), there was something more that showed everyone that he was comfortable and thriving in his own skin. He owned his identity. Harry didn’t like the git, but they were far past their trivial rivalry and he occasionally had to admit—though not aloud—that he had his endearing qualities.
Harry genuinely can’t tell if it has been two seconds or two centuries when Draco finally taps the whisk against the bowl, smirking satisfactorily, and gently pulls his arms back. He picks up his wand and waves it with a flourish, and the batter begins to pour out onto the pans in perfect circles. “You’ve done enough, Potter—you can go now, tell them breakfast is ready.”
“But Master Nott has always told Teeny, don’t accept anything from strangers…” She looks at Draco, then at Harry, and slams her puny fists on the table, causing them both to jump. “But Mister Malfoy and Mister McVee is no stranger. They is Teeny’s friends.”
--like he was actually happy, and because he actually was happy. Really, truly, and abso-freaking-lutely happy.
“I like your… er… shoes.” Harry says lamely, even though his shoes are hardly unique—or stylish, for that matter.
plotting ways to taunt Potter, trap Potter, bait Potter, get Potter’s knickers in a twist, quite literally—“ Theo chuckles. “If anyone had an obsession, it was him.”
Harry watches him warily as he strolls out of the room—hair perfectly combed, robes perfectly pressed, posture perfectly poised, perfectly
“I doubt that.” Harry reluctantly accepts the vial from Draco’s outstretched hand, examining it carefully and biting down the wave of nausea threatening to wash over him. He uncorks it, shutting his eyes closed, and drains the entire bottle in a single gulp. His skin burns and his intestines twist and coil and stretch and his ears and neck and knuckles all sting like mad, aching, and he jerks forward, sure he's going to start retching, but the feeling dissipates, leaving his gasping and wiping a thin trail of sweat from his temple.
Harry walks over to the bowl, holding the whisk firmly in his right hand and starting to run it in circles, smoothing out the mixture. He feels like he’s being watched very closely and tries to do as nice a job as he can—but a few minutes later, Draco sighs and comes up behind him—and reaches his left arm, threading it through the small niche between Harry’s elbow and waist, to grab the bowl steadily, and his right to close his hand over Harry’s.
“I think that—that—oh, there’s Ginny and Luna, we should go and say hi.” Harry says hurriedly, spotting the pair strolling into the party, holding hands.
“Hmm…” She slams the bucket down on the floor again, and the noise reverberates around the streets, causing Harry to wince. “Sorry, boys. You’re going to have to tell your uncle he just missed his chance. The item’s been sold.”
Ginny rolls her eyes affectionately. “You’re boring him, Luna. It was nice to see you, Harry. We’ll go grab some punch and—oh no, Slughorn’s headed over here, we better go.” She winks, placing a hand on Luna’s back and guiding her to the refreshments table.
influential figure one day, mark my words—“ He gives Harry a final, parting pat and waddles off cheerfully in Hermione’s direction.
“Polyjuice. It’ll turn you into a Muggle that I captured specifically for this purpose a few years ago.” He explains, then tilts his head. “Don’t tell Granger that.”
“My alarm didn’t ring,” he grumbles, rummaging in his pocket for his wand. He fishes it out and spells the curtains closed, cloaking the room in a hazy darkness, and Draco narrows his eyes and swishes his wand in the air, effectively throwing them apart again. Harry huffs but settles for sinking into his seat, burying his head in his heads and muttering about how insufferably annoying Draco is.
“I knew that Apparition was allowed within offices, so I must have, right?” The truth was that Harry had simply heard Hermione lecturing a group of students from Hogwarts while accompanying them on their tour of the buildings—but Draco didn’t need to know that.
She grunts and waves him off, her eyes fluttering closed once again. Draco gestures at Harry to follow and forges ahead, ignoring the small gaggle of people pointing and gawking openly at them walking down the streets.
for Draco to get drunk. In fact, he was worried about what would happen if he did, because whining, pouting Draco Malfoy wasn’t a pretty sight. (Wait. Screw it—it was. Extremely.)
Draco whips his wand out, ready to attack, but Hermione steps in between them, briefly closing her eyes and opening them, as if half-hoping they’d disappear. “I would really love for you to—ah—exercise your dueling skills before heading out, but now is not the time. Well, it never is the time to start shouting curses at your partner—one lesson both of you would benefit tremendously from,” she adds in an undertone, before stepping towards Harry and wrapping him in a quick embrace. “Stay safe out there, alright?”
“The love potion wasn’t for you to start drooling over Weasley,” Blaise interrupts, eyes sliding over to Draco, whose cheeks were beginning to rapidly flush with color. “You were supposed to fall in love with the first person you laid eyes on, and that person was supposed to be—“
Harry scowls, but sinks into the sofa. It’s incredibly comfortable, the perfect combination of smooth and plushy, and he breathes out, “Wow.”
“And so do we.” Theo hooks his arm around Blaise’s. “By all means, Potter, Draco, do carry on being disgustingly romantic.” They wave and disappear back into the crowds of people.
“As a matter of fact, I have. More than once.” He says nonchalantly, folding the paper. “I’ve seen you there, too. Well, more like stalked.”
“Hello,” Luna replies with her telltale lilt. She purses her lips contemplatively, pointing at Harry’s glass. “Harry, are you sure that’s safe to drink? The shade of sapphire blue awfully reminds me of Billywigs—I got stung by one once—well, on purpose, because I heard it could provide you with great insight when your creativity has been stalled. It wasn't the most pleasant experience.” She tilted her head. “But I did get a flash of inspiration for a new project, so maybe you
, Harry thinks furiously) before Harry clears his throat and says nervously, more to Draco than to Teeny, “So, er, if you can hold onto my arm—both of you—“
Harry was really starting to miss the original Slug Club. The huge swarms of chattering, waving, shouting people were deeply annoying him.
“Right. Fine.” Ethan retorts, and passes a small piece of paper over to Harry. “For when you get tired of this bloke.”
“Now I’d be delighted, just as long as it was with my daughter instead, imagine the fortune and fame he’d bring with him—“
“Shut. Up.” A corner of Harry’s mouth twists up. “Don’t even try to apologize, because I’m not listening, you prat. All I could think of while you were stammering that stupid speech was how much time we were wasting when we could be kissing and how attractive you are right after a shag and how glad I am that you told me you loved me first.”
“And Draco, you’re probably wondering why he didn’t pass it on to you. But there’s an explanation for that.” Draco refuses to look at him, gaze fixated on his shoes.
Ron and Hermione exchange a look, but Harry quickly walks over, forcing a nervous smile onto his face. “Hey, Ginny, Luna.”
“Young Master Nott is… is….” Teeny lets out a wail, rushing over to a round mahogany table placed in the center of the room and slamming the flower pot on her fingers repeatedly, screeching and yowling, causing Harry to use every ounce of self-restraint he had not to stuff his fingers into his ears and roar. “Bad Teeny! Bad Teeny!”
Draco picks up a small cup containing a clear, purple liquid, and Harry doesn’t get why the gesture, normally so menial and devoid of significance, suddenly appears so supremely delicate.
“Move,” he commands, and Harry hastily rolls over to the right to make room—perhaps more than is necessary—for Draco. Blaise sets him down and turns to leave. “I’m guessing Theo already told you about the vicious bowtruckles, so I’ll give you a different warning instead: Draco sleepwalks, sleeptalks, and sleep—well, you’ll find out.”
“Mm-hmm,” Draco says, placing the velvet box gently inside his backpack and turning around to face Harry. “We did succeed after all—Granger’s definitely going to be happy.”
“I’m not that great at reading people,” Ron retorts defensively. His eyes land on Harry’s, and he gives a tentative grin. “I’m happy for you, mate.” Harry’s heart collapses in relief. “I’m not going to lie and say that
Draco nods, the gesture seeming less out of understanding and more out of a growing desire to go to bed. He rubs his eyes sleepily, and an image of tucking a murmuring, mewling Draco Malfoy to bed pops into Harry’s mind without any warning—he pushes it away vigorously, fanning his face and clearing his throat even though Draco’s far from paying him any attention. He was so glad Draco wasn’t an accomplished Legilimens.
He arrives at the front door after what seems like several eternities and is greeted with the same serpentine knocker as the one from the mansion. He’s just about to rap it against the door when it swings open, revealing an amused Theo, who calls out, “I was right, Blaise. It’s Potter towing Draco, not the other way around. Pay up.”
“Now, Blaise, where are our manners?” Theo rolls his eyes. “Good evening, Potter. Red hair is truly not a flattering look on you. Come in.”
“Right. Only the poor house-elf,” Draco shoots back. “Besides, do you honestly think I’d get drunk on a single drink? Please, Potter.”
“Of course it is,” he pouts. “Oh—whoops.” His wand slips between his fingers, but Harry reaches out and catches it just in time, passing it back to him. He laughs. “You were always a better Seeker than me."
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Draco mutters. He rummages through his backpack, holding out a small vial containing a brick-red, shimmery liquid. “Drink up, Potter.”
“Sure, Potter.” He snickers. “You look just like a Weasley. They were always your surrogate family, no? Now you even look the part. Red hair, plenty of freckles—oh no, you’re a tad too short, now, aren’t you?”
“Uh, alright.” Harry makes his way to the kitchen tentatively. He scans the area and finds that most of the items and equipment he remembered from the Dursleys’ are missing. There’s a sink and a cooktop, but that’s pretty much it.
to restrain her.” Hermione dismisses him with a wave of her hand. “The point here is, you two make a good team.”
“Hmm, I don’t know.” Hermione answers. “I’m simply suggesting this based on the careful analysis of your personal records here at the Ministry. Our systems have reached the conclusion that you two would be a perfect match in all sorts.”
“That’s right,” Harry says, plastering a fake smile onto his face. “We’re your friends, Teeny. You can trust us.”
“… Why?” He doesn’t reply. “I mean, you could go talk to your father about it, surely Azkaban allows communication between family members, and work your emotions out, apologize—“
The kiss starts off gentle, with Harry curving his arm around Draco’s waist and holding him up, tentative and innocent. Harry can sense Draco’s surprise, but he responds quickly, enthusiastically, and Harry smiles as he tastes the sweet, fruity tang lingering on his lips. A fire builds in his chest, crackling and glowing, and as Draco’s hands tug at his hair and his tongue flickers playfully against his lips, the fire leaps into his throat, scorching and scalding hot. His heart throbs, and he squeezes Draco’s body closer to his, pushing his lips hungrily against his, and jolts of electricity snake down his spine, making him crave more with each passing second. Draco clutches at the hem of Harry’s shirt, pulling it down and grunting in frustration when he realizes it’s a button-up, and Harry lets out a low moan—and they break apart, breathing hard. “Public space,” Harry whispers, the tips of their noses brushing and sending the flames into a frenzy again, forcing Harry to shove the compelling desire down. Draco rolls his eyes but nods, straightening up.
“Breakfast will be served soon.” He says loudly, and their eyes practically shine in anticipation. “Pancakes,” he adds.
“In that dark, dingy cell, he also learned about the full extent of the lifelong pain he’d inflicted upon you. He had pushed you in the hopes you’d be greater, stronger, and better than who he was, yet he had never stopped to actually
“That way.” Draco says, pointing. They start walking in the direction he pointed, the road eerily quiet and abandoned. The windows of the shops are greasy, the displays falling apart and appearing to have been neglected for years. Harry spots a poster advertising an intelligence-boosting elixir from 1991 as “The Latest Potions Phenomenon” and a mannequin dressed in tattered robes that bear a striking resemblance to the ones Ron had endured wearing at the Yule Ball years ago. There isn’t much to stop and marvel at, unlike the flashy, vibrant signs and loud noises usually crowding Diagon Alley, and even the sunlight seems harsh and unforgiving.
Harry lets the silence wash over them, like foaming, frothing waves crashing into golden stretches of sand, before opening his mouth. “Look, I—I don’t know what it’s like to lose a parent. But I
“Of course,” Harry grumbles, fishing in his pocket for his wand and a scrap piece of paper. He holds it up to his eyes and reads, “Abbey’s Antiques and Accessories? Sounds fairly benign.”
Draco casually strolls to the front gates, waving his wand in a complicated fashion to make them swing open. Harry trails behind him uncertainly, his eyes swiveling from the extravagant fountains adorning the garden to the butterflies flapping their wings and resting on bright, blooming flowers. He hadn’t really bothered to invest his intimidating loads of money into house decorating and furnishing, letting Hermione and Ron (mostly Hermione) do all the planning and moving. His own room was still packed with boxes, and he spent most of his time there sleeping, curled up on his comfortable bed.
“That’s uh, that’s my name,” Harry says, and seriously considers kicking himself in the shin for being so stupid. Draco assumes an amused expression, and Harry blushes.
Theo takes a deep breath. “Back when—back when the war had just ended… Most of the people who had sided with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named—they were either thrown into Azkaban, executed, or tortured for information. Not surprisingly, they were all extremely bitter and furious with the way things had turned out, and quite a few followers hoped that they would be the ones to bring the Dark Lord back to power again. Many ideas were voiced secretively, discussed through hushed conversations and coded messages in Azkaban cells, and spread widely through methods of communication the Ministry was entirely unaware about.
Draco lets out a soft moan and his arm slips down to land on Harry’s torso. He toys with the thin fabric a bit before sighing and falling back into a quiet slumber. Harry grits his teeth and breathes in, breathes out—it was going to be a long, long night.
“But, as you might have already figured out, it never happened. Because the one person who had been the most active, the most vocal when debating different tactics and strategies, the one person they had counted on most to bring back their venerated lord, betrayed them.” Theo looks down at his lap. “And that man was your father, Draco.”
Draco stays motionless for a couple seconds, in which silence blooms around them, enveloping them in a morose atmosphere. He finally sneers, but his voice trembles. “Yeah, because it really sounds like he did.”
"They look pretty suspicious to me. I heard ol’ Lucius got into a right squabble with his son over there, maybe it was about this funny relationship right here—imagine, the Chosen One swapping spit with his only heir—“
“Quite tall. Thin. Brown hair, pale skin. Looked a bit like he’d collapse after a single blow to the head.” Harry started to feel hopeless at the woman's vague descriptions, but Draco looked at her intently, nodding encouragingly. “Oh! And he came with a boy—I wish I meant that differently, but I don’t. They were holding hands,” she says distastefully.
Draco blinks, then his gaze hardens, his relaxed countenance stiffening. Harry wants to reach out and comfort him—murmur reassurance and encouragement, squeeze his hand, hug him tightly, anything—but he doesn’t.
Harry rolls his eyes but goes and grabs two Firewhiskeys (one with extra shots) and a Butterbeer for himself. When he returns, Draco is passing a paper napkin to a stammering, blubbering Teeny, suggesting that maybe he trade her old handkerchief for something new.
“You think I can’t hear you because I’m old? Well, let me tell you, these ears of mine are blessed—have been for a good few decades now. I can hear everything from your pathetic little heartbeats hammering away like frightened rabbits to the rat two blocks over scurrying home with a banana peel between its teeth!” She scowls. “Now give me a good reason as to why you woke me up because now you’re just wasting my time.” She crosses her arms and lifts her chin.
Draco raises the ornate brass knocker in the shape of a lunging snake and raps it against the door three times. A terrified squeal and a hasty pattering of feet sound from inside the house, and the two exchange a look.
“Imported from Italy last month. Unicorn hairs laced with lavender stems, with Puffskein fur added in for the extra poof, and dyed in brilliant
The air whooshes back into his lungs. He clutches his knees, turning around to make sure Teeny was still with them.
have to drink it?” Harry protests. The potion looked a lot tastier than the ones he’d previously drunk, but he was not looking forward to the agonizing transformation.
“Mister McVee and I here have some very good news to deliver to Nott. Could you at least give us a hint?”
get the idea? Harry’s mind was racing, his heart frantically throwing itself at his rib cage in a frenzied, erratic rhythm. He lets himself be led up the stairs, stumped into silence. It was absolutely bonkers, but he felt much, much more nervous than when he had been about the confront the violent, savage Hungarian Horntail during the Triwizard Tournament.
Draco’s sitting on the edge of the bed, his back to Harry. “I keep forgetting you were pretty much raised as a Muggle.” He says resignedly.
Harry accepts the paper but winces when he feels Draco’s eyes drilling holes into his side. Once Ethan has disappeared safely out of sight, the card bursts into flames in Harry’s hands, and he drops it, yelping. “I think I have blisters on my palms now,” he complains.
Draco doesn’t even turn around, still fully concentrating. He groans in frustration as the blueberry he was fiddling around with rolls over, but he finally gets it right in a few tries. (Actually, Harry’s not sure what the difference between the last two was, but he thinks it’s best not to ask.) He spins around, beaming triumphantly. “They’re perfect. Go ahead and take them.”
“Merlin’s beard, Malfoy. You’re going to pay for that.” He wheezes, his voice abnormally high-pitched, and he realizes, dismayed, that he’s now a good few inches shorter than the blond.
“I really did spend my entire life trying to please him.” He says scathingly, but also like he doesn’t have the energy to muster enough bite. “I don’t know which is worse—that he never got to tell me the one thing I desired most in person, or that he never properly trusted me until the end. Or maybe it’s that even now, I seek his approval and… crave it.”
“They succeeded--well, in making the Time-Turner, anyway. And they continued to elaborate on their scheme, adding specific details, devising alternative methods, and eventually, their outline wasn’t an outline anymore—it had grown and expanded until it was a very tangible and very plausible plan. However, time was running short. Ministry officials were getting impatient, citizens were rioting for harsher punishments, and so the number of potential participants were decreasing significantly every day. They soon decided to carry it out on the same day the Dark Lord had first fallen—so again, on your birthday, Potter.
“Malfoy’s just jealous because he hasn’t had enough friends to know what friendship means.” Harry pretends to think. “I’m sorry, did I say not enough? I meant none.”
“Well, I’m sorry for talking to a guy who, for your information, came up to me first and complimented me on my
Harry smiles. “Alright.” He notices Draco pointedly looking away, and rolls his eyes. “You can join if you want, I promise I won’t run away screaming even if you do.”
He sips on his pumpkin juice without actually drinking it for the what's probably the tenth time in a single minute. Hermione and Ron are bickering about the trip to Finland they’re planning to take over the summer, Hermione sighing and shaking her head, Ron gesturing furiously and stomping his foot (“Oh, stop acting like such a
“Mister Malfoy is too kind…” Teeny wipes his eyes on the paper napkin, then holding it against the lights and examining it, shining with gratitude. “Teeny is having a ‘something new’ now, all her friends and family will all be so jealous—“ The color drains from her pale face, and Harry, sensing another hysterical tantrum approaching, hurriedly places the bottle in front of the elf.
“Yes, that time,” Theo says calmly. “It took a fair amount of interrogation and investigation to finally figure out Draco’s motives.”
He stretches out an arm, reaching for a spot on the tip of Harry’s mouth, but pulls it back, running his teeth along his lips thoughtfully. Harry looks at him curiously, and he gives a wicked grin and leans over, pressing his lips firmly against the spot, licking the tiny speck of cream off Harry’s lips teasingly. Harry groans and tilts his head up, properly crashing his lips against Draco’s and savoring the spicy, sweet scent of pumpkin that slips into his mouth, spreading softly.
, Harry thinks sheepishly. “And the elf fell asleep around thirty minutes ago, and we obviously didn’t want to wake her. We also don’t know how to bloody cook. Hence this stinking mess of a meal.” He gestures sharply to the steaming, melting pile of what Harry assumed—and sincerely hoped—was scrambled eggs and toast. (With sausages. Were those sausages? They were awfully pink.)
“Which working style? I don’t know which one you’re talking about because you obviously do not have one.” She huffs, twisting around to face Harry. “And Harry, did you send Slughorn to come pester me? I had to promise him a private visit to the Ministry to get him off my back—that and my word to include him in my inauguration speech when I’m elected Minister of Magic. He said when, not if,” she adds, a hint of pride in her voice.
Their exchange barely registers with Harry, who’s still investing all his willpower into not pressing his lips against Draco’s right then and there. He clenches his fist, removing his shoulder from under Draco’s head as cautiously as he can manage, and setting it against the wall instead.
Teeny’s eyes widen in disbelief (Harry's do too), and her gaze flickers over to a small marble statue sitting on his right, before she nods jerkily.
“Ah. Teeny, right.” Malfoy looks momentarily lost before his gaze lands on Harry, shifting uncomfortably. “Teeny, this is Mister McVee, he’s visiting us from down South. And you know who I am.”
With a loud, deafening pop, his feet hit solid ground. He lifts his head and lets go of the two, wrapping his coat tightly against the chill. He grits his teeth and nudges Malfoy forward, while guiding Teeny by placing a hand on her back. “Yes, that’s right, just keep walking, no, not that way, yes, nice and easy—“
"It's OK, Draco, it's safe, can't you feel it?" Pansy looked at him over his shoulder. She was standing on the threshold, one foot already in the room. She stretched her arm in an invitation, for Draco to take it as if to pull him inside the room after her.
"It started about a month ago," Mr. Gladstone's voice turned to a harsh whisper and he nodded as if to reassure himself. "One of our guests… it was awful! Jackie found him in his bed when he didn't vacate his room on time in the morning. I knew right there and then something unnatural had happened to him. It wasn't a heart attack or any magical death I've ever seen. The sight of his stiff body and blue lips… I can't get it out of my head."
Harry moaned in response, wiggling his hips to release some of the tension in his body by rubbing his dick across the armrest.
"You're closer, go get it," Draco, contradictory to his words, wrapped his arms even tighter around Harry's back.
Harry and Draco finally come out as a couple to their friends. The way they go about is a bit unorthodox. But as Harry pointed out, sometimes it's better to throw oneself into something rather than ease in, however, it might have been an innuendo of sorts.
Draco found himself in a long dark corridor, with doors leading from it on each side. Some of them were open, some closed. Draco immediately noticed the spiderwebs covering the ceiling and the broken remains of a cupboard to his left like a thick blanket. Spiders loved ghosts. It was one of the distinguishing marks that he and Blaise had noticed when dealing with their first ghost-hunting cases. It was hard to attribute them to ghost activity in old, decrepit buildings such as this one where spiderwebs were a natural occurrence. On the other hand, in inhabited houses, spiders and layers of cobwebs meant ghosts for sure.
The door creaks open, and a huge blue eye the size of a tennis ball stares up at them, glancing first at Draco, then at Harry--it shrieks, and slams the door again.
“No,” Draco says, climbing off Harry’s lap (much to his severe disappointment) and settling into the seat at his right. “I never was.”
“Don’t ask.” Draco holds up a finger and tosses him a whisk. “And I can’t do all the work here, can I? Whisk up, Potter.” He points to the far right corner where a salt shaker is tilting itself over a bowl, straightening up and returning to its original place after giving a final, decisive shake.
Blaise glares at him. “Thanks to your brilliant plan of get-the-house-elf-wasted, Theo and I didn’t get a wink of sleep last night.”
“We’re here,” he whispered, and Harry craned his neck, expecting to see another boring old store but scrunching his eyebrows in confusion when he’s instead greeted by the sight of an old woman leaning against a rickety wooden armchair, snoring softly, her gnarly fingers clutching the gigantic dusty bucket resting in front of her. The letters
“—and you wouldn’t want to cause him any more pain, would you, by forcing him to partner in the most exciting mission of his life with—of all people—me?” He finishes, ignoring the annoyed looks Harry was shooting in his direction.
Teeny hoists herself up, staggering and limping, and stares at them with woeful eyes. Draco grimaces. “Drinks with the Boy Who Lived and the Elf Who Cried. Sounds positively
“Shut up,” he retorts, channeling as much malice as he can into his reedy tone, but it ends up sounding sad and defeated. He groans.
Harry nods stiltedly, although he didn’t—couldn’t—know what that would feel like. He had always known that Draco had had a rough relationship with his father, but dismissed it with the thought that he was lucky to be dealing with those problems, as it meant that he, at the very least, had a father.
“Great, you have to take us there.” He slowly reaches out and takes her hand, then, swallowing anxiously, clasps Draco’s wrist. He mumbles something about crazy hair and sighs dreamily. Harry nods at the elf. “Okay, Teeny, on one, two—“
Harry lets out a laugh. Theo and Blaise shoot them strange looks, but gesture them over to the sitting room, where they settle into the loveseat, leaving Harry and Draco to share the sofa and flooding Harry with memories from the previous night. He tries to sit as far away from Draco as possible, but something must be wrong, because Draco’s thighs keep pressing into his no matter how much he scoots in the opposite direction.
“A hint…” Before Harry can even properly register what is happening, a loud crack explodes in the air and Teeny is throwing herself against the wall and yelping noisily again. Draco is there in a flash, yanking her away, and Teeny crumples to a messy pile on the floor, her cries reduced to feeble moans. She wipes her eyes on her dirty handkerchief, shivering.
Blaise shakes his head. “You understand him. You’re—you’re similar in ways you don’t see. Trust me on this.”
Blaise raises a hand. “We know why you’re here—we think we have a pretty good idea, at least. And it can wait until tomorrow morning. Now sit down and drink the chamomile tea Theo’s going to be bringing in.” He sits on the loveseat on the opposite side, crossing his legs.
“The McVee family.” Draco interrupts smoothly. “You see, we’re currently apprenticing for Mister McVee, our beloved uncle, to get familiar with the business, which we’re planning to take over in a couple years. He asked us to come visit you in search of a prized treasure he’s been searching for, saying you were the only person he could trust to sell genuine artifacts with value. He asked about a… necklace, with a small pendant in the shape of an hourglass? Was that what it was, Trent?”
he felt, and suddenly he was squirming desperately, his hole fluttering with need and wet, slick heat.
“I don’t think it’s a matter of risk anymore,” Draco said. “We defied him. Not only that, we flaunted our defiance in his face. And with so many other Slytherins defecting with us, their parents will be forced to at least think about their continued loyalty to the Dark Lord. If he understands anything at all about purebloods, he will be examining his ranks very carefully right now.”
“Harry,” Dumbledore said. “I will understand if you are not, perhaps, very interested in an old wizard’s memories from long ago. But please believe that I do understand the attraction of a... ‘bad boy’, as you young people say.”
Harry tried to keep his gaze above waist level, but it was impossible. He’d never seen Draco wear anything but layers of tunics and robes before. He felt
Harry was making incoherent pleas, pushing back insistently, and Draco noticed his hand, heading for his cock. “Ah, ah,” Draco said, pinning his hand to the bed. “Let me.”
Draco to pay attention to his utter lack of interest in anyone but Draco; his true mate, his Alpha, his one and only love. Draco made a pleased noise, and bent his head to latch his mouth onto Harry’s mark, sucking lightly. Harry cried out, his cock hardening so fast his head spun, the rest of his body going limp and pliable and
earlier, like that was a thing. Was that a thing? He couldn’t help but hope so. It would explain why the Snake Shield had him desperate to rip off Draco’s clothes and take him against the wall in a broom cupboard, just a few feet away from a dozen reporters and the highest ranking members of their government and justice system. Because otherwise – well, that was a bit perverted, wasn’t it?
Harry spared the professor a glance. He was surprised to see real concern in the dark eyes. Snape had always been unfairly biased towards the Slytherins, and Malfoy in particular, but clearly the bond went deeper than he’d realised.
“Wow, Potter, you can be so dense sometimes.” He responds dryly. “Of course we don’t, what are we, human beings?”
“Fine.” He huffs, crossing his arms over his chest as Draco levitates a carton of eggs, containers of—baking soda? baking powder?—and a plethora of boxes and cans towards them. The lids fly open, pouring its contents out to its respective dishes, and the eggs glide out of their dimples and crack themselves over a plastic bowl. Harry watches in stunned amazement as the utensils and ingredients spin, jump, and twirl of their own accord, creating a cheerful, bumbling racket.
“Wow, I’m impressed, Malfoy.” Blaise says, watching the plates soar over their heads and wiping his mouth with his napkin. “I thought you didn’t know where the plates went.”
Harry trails behind the pair, still trying to wrap his mind around the fact that they were a couple. It wasn’t that he hadn’t seen two guys holding hands or, hell, even kissing passionately in public before—what stunned him was the easy connection they held, the sparks of chemistry. And what terrified him was how much he found himself desiring it—not just the shagging-a-guy part, nor the playful, snarky banter part, but both of them, equally as much and a
long, Potter, and we were always enemies. Don’t get me wrong—I liked being enemies, for the most part, because I could stalk you and tease you and laugh at you. Then we were co-workers, then partners on a mission, and then maybe even friends and I was too much of a coward to grab an opportunity when I had one, so I devised a crazy plan on the spot and convinced you I was drunk, so I could be less of the stuck-up prick I am normally and—“
Harry opens his mouth to protest, but Blaise cuts in. “Just listen to me and things will be so much easier, Potter."
Harry raises an eyebrow—Draco, kind? As if hearing his thoughts, Draco says loudly, “A lot has changed since the war, and I’ve come to terms with my wrongdoing and mistakes of the past.” He lowers his head and says softly, “Teeny deserves to be treated better, is that clear?”
“This is my best,” he sighs, finally relenting and drawing back. “I hope that shirt doesn’t hold any special sentimental value for you.”
“Not very smart, either,” Draco notes, and the guy clamps his mouth shut, glaring. “Yes, we mean that we’re here together, that we’re here, and that we’re together.”
“—not to mention that he was the reason I found my knickers dangling from a fucking makeshift Quidditch hoop at the Head Table on Christmas morning.”
going to ever say what he was thinking out loud. Because he was thinking that this would probably be one of the last times he was going to be alone with Draco Malfoy, just the two of them, and he was thinking that he didn’t want that to be the case. He was thinking about the way Draco had snuggled close to him late at night and the addictive touch of his skin pressing up against his and how open and vulnerable he had been earlier—to hell with it, he was saying it. Well, maybe not the whole truth, but he was going to have /some/ fun before he had to say goodbye. He needed to. He clears his throat. “It has…. It’s actually been decent, working with you. And, you know, since we don’t hang out much often,” he winces, “I thought we could celebrate… before parting ways.”
Yes, I have a thing for drunk Draco and Harry totally does too... so let's see how that plays out ⸂⸂⸜(രᴗര๑)⸝⸃⸃
“You mean Young Master Nott? Why, he’s at his family cottage in Chestnut Orchards, of course.” Harry crosses his fingers under the table, hoping she doesn’t realize her slip-up, but she simply frowns and asks, “Why is your name Mac and Cheese, sir? Did you choose it for yourself? Of course, Teeny isn’t knowing what mac and cheese tastes like, because her masters have refined taste, but her brother says it’s delicious--“
“Malfoys sure don’t do much.” Harry pretends to be concerned, knitting his eyebrows in faux concentration. “Wait, do they breathe?”
Draco stands up, nearly knocking over his chair and stumbling, a look of wide surprise in his eyes. “Woah,” he says softly, smiling sheepishly at Harry. “Guess I’m a little tipsy. Do you want anything?”
“Liked, I meant liked.” He corrects automatically. Harry cocks his head, raising his eyebrows. “Fine. I said loved. Happy?”
Theo rolls his eyes. “This is a vacation cottage we only use two or three weeks a year. Do you honestly think we have that many spare bedrooms?”
, Harry thinks, but doesn’t dare voice his opinions out loud in fear of another outburst. He instead takes a step back, holding up his hands, and says, “We’re from the Mi—“
“A little punctuality would be even better.” He replies, turning around in his chair to face Harry, who squints and shields his eyes with his hand.
He returns a few moments later holding bright crimson drinks in both his hands, singing along cheerfully to the song—even though the song has no lyrics and vaguely resembles the pieces of Mozart Harry’s 2nd grade music teacher had forced him to listen to--either that or an exceedingly depressing funeral march. He slips into his seat, humming.
Draco raises a sardonic eyebrow. “You continue to stun me with your exceptional observation skills.” He smirks. “Come down for breakfast.”
“Right.” Harry says under his breath, still in a slight daze, and walks out to confront the disgruntled, tired faces of Blaise and Theo. They’ve started to poke and prod at the dripping mess (which Harry doesn’t quite think is eggs and toast anymore), and their expressions lighten up considerably when Harry enters the room, bringing the delicious scent of pancakes with him.
“Nott’s house elves are trained to recognize enemies like yourself, and to never extend their trained hospitality to them, no matter what their immediate instincts are.” He says. “You’re still Undesirable Number One in his household, even though Theodore personally has nothing against you.”
Once they’re all settled (Harry very uncomfortably so), Theo clears his throat. “So, we’re guessing you’re here for this.“ He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small, cube-shaped box. He snaps it open, and the Time-Turner is resting on the velvet cushion, glowing a dazzling, radiant blue. “And we intend to give it back to you—but give us a chance to explain.” He bites his lip anxiously, and Blaise places his hand over his, earning a quick half-smile.
“Yes, because it really seemed like it when you were seconds away from leaving the building to board public
“No need,” he says smoothly, and Blaise passes them, tugging an uncooperative Draco behind him sluggishly.
Draco chokes. “Parting ways? Now you’re starting to sound like me, for Merlin’s sake.” He smiles, and Harry notices that he actually has an honest-to-god dimple, flashing in the crook of his left cheek-- and that it really wasn't helping matters with his obsession with Draco, as it was so
There was a soft, Moke-skin wallet, a gorgeous dragon-hide wrist holster, custom-made for Draco’s wand –
The other Death Eaters began to scream. Shooting spells at him did little to help. Part of the Beserker Curse made the victim almost impervious to attack. She cast it again, and again.
“Watch out!” Seamus cried. He grabbed Pansy, spinning her. Draco threw himself at Theo. They went crashing to the ground. Spells whizzed by overhead.
, and still he couldn’t quite wrap his head around it), Harry had just kind of assumed that Malfoy and his most devoted sycophant were dating, if not lovers.
Harry’s eyes caught on a denser part of the smoke, which was moving oddly. Almost… purposefully? “Oh,
“Yeah, mate?” he sighed, trying to work out how much of a fallout there would be, exactly, when this whole thing went up in flames.
Sometimes, when he was inside Draco, and Draco looked up at him with his heart in his eyes… sometimes he wondered if that was it. If that was love.
To Harry's surprise, the Headmaster closed his mouth and took a step back, looking surprised and wary.
“He hit his head,” Luna said. “I’ve stopped the bleeding, but he won’t wake up. I’m taking him to the infirmary.”
He’d concealed the details from Pansy; how, exactly, the Dark Lord planned to kill him if he failed. Most days, he couldn't even think it, let alone say it out loud.
Pansy was surprised into a laugh. “Merlin forbid!” she said. “I can’t imagine – no, no, I think the universe would implode!”
He stopped just inside the doorway. While the Slytherin common room wasn’t all that different from Gryffindor – decorated in house colours, the fireplace the focal point of the room, a couple of tables for playing games or studying – apparently their dorms were completely different. Instead of a circular room with five four-poster beds crammed inside, like Gryffindor, there was a mini-common area with five doors leading off it. To
They were bombarded with owls for the better part of a week, bearing letters of thanks, of appreciation and congratulation – all for Harry. Many brought gifts, as well, from the newest, top-of-the-line brooms, to gold and jewellery, most with elaborate protections against curses or hexes, to chocolate and the best Faerie wines available in the wizarding world, to life-long subscriptions to Quidditch and wand magazines, and even tickets to the next Quidditch World Cup.
, centuries ago. Forgotten, erased from the history books. None but his family even knew it had ever existed. There was no possible way the Dark Lord could have learned of it, except – except if his father had sold him out. If he had bartered his only son’s life.
“So I am,” Potter said. He grinned, executing a short – and entirely plebeian – bow. “After you, Malfoy.”
She tutted, and handed him a potion. “For the pain,” she said. When he swallowed it obediently, she handed him another. This one she didn’t explain immediately, and he looked at her questioningly. She sighed. “You healed everyone but yourself, Mr Potter. Your heart suffered damage not only from the Vampire Bane curse, but also...” She trailed off.
Harry got his wand out slowly, and did a few practice flicks. Madam Pomfrey nodded encouragingly, and he aimed at Malfoy, thinking that this was probably the first time in their six years of school that he’d pointed his wand at the other boy in good faith. Merlin only knew what Malfoy would think if he could see him now. “
“Not yet,” Draco said, though he wriggled a little as if he couldn't help himself. Harry had to restrain himself from rolling Draco back over and kissing him senseless. But they hadn’t had sex since their break-up, and he was determined to let Draco set the pace. “All right, up you get,” Draco said, firmly. “I've got cake and presents.”
“You’re in shock,” Madam Pomfrey said, firmly. “Both of you. You need rest, and Mr Potter, I need to finish healing your injuries. Mr Weasley, if you would be so good as to take Mr Malfoy into the quarantine room while I look Mr Potter over? Miss Granger, if you would help Mr Potter back to bed?”
“Yes?” Harry said, disingenuously. He took a step forward, crowding Malfoy back against the wall of the pub, out of sight of the customers. “Just one?” he coaxed, pressing in until his body was flush against Malfoy’s.
He covered his face with his hands. “I don’t want your pity. Just tell me he wasn’t lying, all this time, about loving me. Tell me the reason he worked so hard to convince me to defect was because he loves me, not because he was working on some kind of – of undercover mission for Dumbledore, playing the obedient fucking
Draco was subdued in a way Harry had only seen once before, when he’d rejected him after Malfoy Manor. It made him feel awful. None of the past year had been Draco’s fault. He’d been blackmailed and manipulated and used, and despite all that, he’d still chosen to do the right thing. He’d suffered
“Maybe it is,” Draco said, leaning back on his elbows, an amused smile playing on his lips, “maybe it isn’t. Alpha-Omega bonds are powerful, and unique; we won’t know our limits until we push them. But I didn’t Apparate us here. Even if it was possible, I wouldn't want to exhaust us both before we even start. No, it’s an illusion. Of a real place, of course. The Malfoy holiday home in Spain, in fact, with our own private stretch of beach.” Harry turned to look at him incredulously, and Draco’s smile widened. “Romantic enough for you, sweetheart?”
Harry winced. “No, sir. Um. The first time, it was an illusion. That is, I thought I’d transfigured some blankets into a – a bed. I didn’t really mean to, and it was without my wand or an incantation. And – we could touch it. Draco even changed the colour of the curtains. But I couldn’t replicate it later, even with a wand.”
Draco turned away, and vomited. His head was throbbing, and his tailbone ached. He wiped his mouth with shaking hands, fumbling for his clothes. The tiny dragon Harry had created wriggled out of his pocket, huffing inquiringly at him. Draco let it settle on his shoulder, nuzzling his neck. It made tears start to his eyes. “I love you, Harry,” he said, crouching in front of him. He was careful to keep his hands in view. “You’re safe. Can you hear me? You’re safe, it’s over.”
Harry made it to the Arithmancy classroom in no time, and then paced up and down the hallway impatiently until the door opened. Students began filing out, Hermione in the lead. She opened her mouth when she saw him, but his eyes caught on a glint of white-blond hair, and he forgot her entirely.
Harry walked him out to his friends. Pansy’s smile practically lit up the hallway, and she flung herself into Draco’s arms, wrapping herself around him as if she could protect him by the power of her embrace alone.
The Three Broomsticks was a scene of utter chaos; students spilling out of the pub, others trying to push their way inside. One of the front windows was blown out, and the crunch of glass was audible over the screams and shouts of the crowd.
“The boy’s an Omega,” Snape interrupted, short and succinct. “He’s in heat. I need your quarantine room, now.”
“Yes,” Daphne agreed, “and I am inclined to think he made the right decision, when he chose Potter over the Dark Lord. He’s already different. Lighter, like a burden has been lifted from his shoulders; more courageous. Freedom appears to agree with our Draco.”
“Ride me, yes,” Harry said, and Draco wondered just where in the seven hells that innocent, endearing blush of his was now. But he held all the cards; Draco wanted, desperately, to be fucked, and so he straddled Harry’s lap, hesitating only when that thick cock brushed his tender hole. Harry wrapped his fingers around Draco’s soft, oversensitive cock again, and he gasped, almost losing his balance.
“Harry?” Hermione prompted, and he lifted his hand to his mouth and touched his lips, gazing into the distance.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “You will be,” he promised, burrowing his hand into the robes he was now lying on.
A spell hit her shield as soon as she opened it. Her shield fell. The sound of battle was sudden and loud.
“Bollocks!” Moody snapped. “Why are we listening to this boy? He’s practised in the art of deception! They all are!”
“Evening,” he said conversationally, and the girl shrieked. A silver bowl went flying, but Harry caught it with a Levitation Charm before it could hit the floor. “Ah, ah!” he chided. “I don’t want you to scare him. I just want you to give him this.”
. She took a deep breath, composing herself. Fortunately, Greg was the only one in the den; the other boys were in their rooms. Greg just looked up, grunted a welcome, and went back to chewing his quill.
How could standing back and doing nothing be the right thing to do? Especially when it meant endangering the other students and staff, allowing Voldemort to gain a foothold in Hogwarts, and risking someone’s life
Carrow’s face was frozen in an expression of rage, mouth wide open in a silent roar, blank stone eyes staring eerily out at nothing.
Ong was surprisingly respectful of Harry’s disinterest. He tended to his daily exams, and kept the questions to a minimum. Harry was grateful. He didn’t want to talk about his part in the final battle, or Voldemort, or the hole where his magic used to be.
“But that really does sound like marriage bonds, Harry,” Miss Granger said, looking bewildered. “Using your magic like that, together, without a ritual or an incantation… I thought that was impossible. Your magic has to be linked somehow, and it’s not – it
“I worked it out,” Harry admitted. “It took me longer than it should have, longer than I’m proud of. But as I said, I wanted to believe the worst of you. Until I couldn’t, anymore. And then everything changed.”
Harry glanced at the road. Sure enough, there were other little blue lights racing towards them. But Draco’s wall was already under attack. It shuddered, pieces of rock breaking off. “Go,” he urged them. “We’ll be right behind you.”
“So what does that mean?” Harry asked, with an uncomfortable feeling that he wasn’t going to like the answer.
Harry bent to pick it up, and froze. It was the photo Dennis had taken, weeks ago. He’d almost forgotten about it.
Seamus gaped at her. Even Blaise looked stunned, although he recovered his poise within moments. “Why?” he inquired, and Pansy knew he meant ‘why tell
“What you’re doing,” Pansy said, firmly, “is worrying about the wrong thing. Forget trying to turn the situation to the Dark Lord’s advantage. It’s you that matters.”
“Shh,” Draco soothed him immediately, easing off and stroking his other hand over Harry’s heaving chest. He took a nipple between a thumb and forefinger, and pinched. Harry arched, crying out again, sweat springing out all over his skin. He had no leverage, on his back with his hands holding his legs up for Draco’s pleasure; no leverage to push back with, and Draco knew it. It was one of his favourite positions for just that reason.
The hooded figure chuckled. It sent a cold shiver of dread down Pansy’s spine. “I am afraid you have been misled, Harry James Potter. Death cannot be commanded by mere mortals. When I gave the Peverell brothers their so-called Hallows, I did not do so lightly. There is power in my gifts, but nothing in the realm of the living has any power over
“Not a big deal?” Hermione said, her voice rising. People were beginning to turn and stare, and Ron’s expression was rapidly changing from guilty to angry and defensive. “You know what, fine,” she said, because doing this with dozens of nosy, intoxicated Gryffindors watching was not her idea of a good time. “
“I’m not absolving you,” Draco said, very gently. “I’m not denying that your actions contributed, in some part, to his death. Guilt is only natural, but it won’t bring him back. All you can do now is try to live your life in a way that honours his memory. In the way that he would have wanted you to.”
“I think that’s a great idea,” Ron said, and the girls immediately transferred their adoring gazes back to him. Hermione smiled at him, and he blushed again. “You should go for it,” he said.
Afterwards, Potter fed Draco strawberries dipped in chocolate, stealing lazy, molten kisses in the warm golden light.
“Got it,” Ron agreed, and skipped neatly over the railing to land on a staircase just turning below. He whipped open the door and disappeared, leaving Harry, Hermione and Pansy waiting impatiently for their own staircase to finish turning. Then they all but sprinted down the halls to Dumbledore’s office.
“So pick a fight with Malfoy in Professor McGonagall’s classroom?” Harry stared at him, surprised into a genuine, if horrified, laugh. “Merlin’s shaggy beard. Are you crazy? We’d be in detention for the rest of our
That struck Harry as the kind of thing he and Ron would have found uproariously funny (and completely ridiculous) just a few weeks ago. “Where is Ron?” he asked. “Where’s Draco? What
Draco gestured her forward, holding up his left arm as he passed through the wards. Pansy hesitated, and then followed. The sound of battle was instant. Even closer were the voices.
Harry looked at it again, noticing three tiny dragons cowering behind the other’s legs. “They used to hunt dragons?” he asked.
Draco was sweating, hair falling into his eyes. He cast a Perception-Altering Charm at Rowle, so that the man’s spells went wild, then dodged a determined
She startled, giving a short scream. A hooded figure stepped out from between two trees, shrouded in darkness. Cold prickled across her skin, lifting the hairs on her arms. “Who are you?” she demanded. “How can you see me?” She was still wearing the Invisibility Cloak. “How do you know my name?”
“Continue!” the Dark Lord snapped. He was still holding his wand to Pettigrew’s arm. Draco’s screams were becoming hoarse.
Harry jerked backwards. Draco whimpered, reaching for him, and it reminded Harry so forcibly of that awful moment in the infirmary that he snapped back to himself.
Harry felt the shock of that hit him like a sledgehammer. “Merlin,” he said, wrapping his own arms around his Alpha. “No.
“Fuck,” he said, staggering. There was stone embedded in his skin, all up his side and arm. Blood was already soaking into his robes. “Ow,” he said, looking up at Harry. He was with the Patil twins and a group of about twenty kids, a couple of floors above them. They looked terrified, clinging to the banisters. “I’m fine. Thanks for that.”
Death interrupted. “I have granted you permission to return to your life, Pansy Parkinson. My patience is wearing thin. You are not meant to die today, but if you dally any longer in my domain, you seal your own fate.”
“Mental states,” Miss Granger said, suddenly. She bent to rummage through her schoolbag. “I think…” She trailed off, emerging with a large book.
Draco glanced at the old Auror. Moody had been badly injured in the mission to rescue Remus Lupin from the Manor, and his wand arm was permanently disfigured. It hung by his side, useless.
He wondered what had happened to Dumbledore, that he could believe that it was even possible to want someone other than his true mate. But then, Dumbledore was an Alpha. He would never be able to understand the awful, churning sickness that had filled Harry's stomach every time an Alpha not his own touched him. Letting one of them take him... that would have been
Harry looked up, and gave an involuntary sob of relief; he’d never been so happy to see Snape in his entire life. The professor dropped to his knees, already casting. Harry recognised a few; diagnostic spells, like the ones Madam Pomfrey sometimes used, and then some healing charms that sounded vaguely familiar. Clotting spells, sealing spells, spells to re-grow muscle and tissue. None given enough time to work properly, even if they had been supplemented with the appropriate potions.
Harry felt her words like a punch to the gut, winding him. Umbridge just smiled sweetly, and he dug his nails into the back of his hand, struggling to breathe.
Bill was yelling from inside some kind of enormous cage, his eyes fixed on someone twisting upside-down in the air. Their
Blaise opened the door for her. He was still staring at Daphne. “That was spectacularly brutal,” he said. “I’m almost impressed.”
He made a sharp gesture with his hand. A huge, flat piece of rubble flew up to cover him. A heartbeat later, he heard the impact of another Killing Curse.
Dumbledore had a bowl of peppermint cream toads on his desk, which he offered to Harry when he arrived. Harry declined. He felt queasy enough; the last thing he needed was toads hopping around in his stomach. Dumbledore shrugged, and popped three into his mouth.
„Harry, listen to me. Imagine the roles were reversed; what if it was Draco who hurt you. Would you hate him now?“ Narcissa asked softly.
They stood in the circle for a while, not speaking. The silence was interrupted only by the sound of the wind. And of a creaking rope for Harry, Draco thought. He ran his thumb across Harry's skin reassuringly.
without success. When Harry was finally done with the room, it looked as if a tornado had torn through it. Harry sighed and sat down heavily in the middle of the debris as a wave of uselessness hit him. He was good for nothing these days. He hadn't been able to save Alpha, he didn't know how to convince the Ministry of Magic to start taking action to solve the Problem. What had he gotten right in the past year or two? Nothing. He was useless. He couldn't even save Ron, his best friend.
Her thoughts steered to Harry again. Hermione was grateful that he had been able to put his past aside and work with Draco. In all honesty, she hadn't seen Harry this content since he'd started his Auror training. Once he realized that being an Auror was not what he'd imagined it would be, especially under Rufus Scrimgeour's questionable leadership, all the joy and happiness evaporated from him leaving an empty shell behind. Seeing his eyes sparkle with excitement last night had been hard on her, reminding her of what she'd lost. Yet at the same time, she was all too grateful he finally found what he'd been always unwittingly looking for.
"Nok goog," Draco murmured, his mouth full of a flashlight, and jumped back to the safety of their protective circle.
They both cast the Disillusionment Charms and followed Nott and Smith up the set of white steps to the large bronze door leading inside the Gringott's Wizarding Bank. The door was slightly ajar as if held open by a spell.
Harry knew this was his chance to show Draco the truth. Show him how much he wanted him, how much Draco meant to Harry.
„Evening, Granger, Weasley,“ Draco appeared in the room, gliding in as smoothly as a ghost. He was dressed in black cashmere turtleneck hugging his figure tightly, and skinny black muggle jeans with fashionable rips at the knees and thighs. Draco didn‘t wear any shoes, opting to leave his feet bare. Harry had an unhealthy obsession with Draco‘s feet and seeing them bare, in all their glory, never failed to turn him on. It made him think of undressing the rest of Draco and leaving him as bare as his feet. Harry knew Draco looked like sex on legs in his black outfit. He had watched him get dressed just an hour ago only to rip the clothes off seconds later to give him a quick but rather spectacular blowjob. He didn‘t dare look in Draco‘s direction presently as he didn‘t want to miss seeing the expression on his friends‘ faces.
Harry hovered above Draco, then took his hand and lifted it to his mouth. He placed a soft kiss onto every one of Draco's knuckles. He ran his nose up the back of Draco's hand, then turned it around and kissed the soft skin of his wrist. Draco's head fell back and he groaned as more blood rushed into his cock. He was rock hard again, and he wanted to touch himself and come so badly. Harry's tongue trailed a path up to the crook of Draco's elbow and Draco shivered. His other arm gave way and he fell onto the bed, sprawling himself, ready for Harry's perusal of his body. Harry trailed open-mouth kisses up his arm and shoulders, licked along Draco's neck. He took Draco's earlobe between his teeth and nipped at it lovingly. Draco whimpered and fisted the silk sheets under him. Suddenly, Harry thrust his tongue inside Draco's ear and Draco's spine bowed with pleasure. Draco felt a growl escape his throat. Sex had never been this good before. If this was what sex with Harry felt like, Draco would convince him to quit the Aurors. He would then whisk Harry away into some cottage on a seashore, somewhere far from here, and they would keep making love until they grew old together.
"Nope, my guess is the victim's bedroom. Let's wait for a bit if it comes back. We can try to extract the ectoplasm from the circle, then dash to the bedroom to try to find the Source and render it inert."
Rowle and Yaxley were coming at him from either side. Greyback had almost bitten his way out of the snare Pansy had conjured. Gibbon had disappeared.
“You were certainly thrilled enough when I turned out to be an Omega,” Harry agreed mildly, no accusation in his tone.
Draco covered his mouth with his own, cutting him off. Harry gasped and then moaned, and Draco kissed him until they were both breathless, hard and panting, rocking against each other with the kind of wild, desperate frotting that was not just want, but overwhelming, all-consuming
There were two Death Eaters, almost within arm’s reach. They were obviously on alert, scanning the surrounding area with sharp, wary eyes. Pansy took one step back, then another. She bumped into a body. Stifling a cry, Pansy grabbed at an invisible tunic. A wand stabbed into her throat.
“Septima is providing sedation and airway management,” Madam Pomfrey said. She glanced at him briefly; reassurance in her quiet brown eyes. “I am healing the internal damage caused by the stampede, but I can’t provide pain management at the same time.”
. But the Dark Lord was watching, and so Draco wielded the clumsy Muggle torture device, and didn’t feel anything as Harry grunted, teeth gritted, his body jerking. Didn’t feel anything as blood welled up from broken skin, and began to trickle down Harry’s legs. Didn’t feel anything when Harry began to scream.
As Pettigrew fumbled to hand it over, Pansy's gaze dropped to Dumbledore again. He met her eyes with an intensity that puzzled her. He was still pointing. And –
Fortunately, Dobby had the food well in hand. Assisting him was a quiet, earnest house-elf called Miffy, who had jumped at the chance to prepare a feast for the ‘great Harry Potter’, although she was very reluctant to accept Hermione’s offer to pay them for their service. Hermione had insisted anyway.
“My identity?” Harry said. He barely noticed when Draco’s hand settled over his. “I sent him back in time. I have no idea how to get him back, which means he’s
He missed it; the excitable prattle of the first and second years, filling the castle with noise and life and laughter. The darkness of the approaching war had encroached upon Hogwarts at last, and no one could ignore the spectre hanging over the castle anymore.
He put a hand up to his forehead and very deliberately pushed his hair aside. His scar had brought him nothing but misery and pain and embarrassment over the years, and now it served as a grim reminder that he was a Horcrux, too. But if he could use it to get justice done, why shouldn’t he? It wasn’t as if he’d be abusing that power much longer.
Draco couldn’t let that stand. “You tried to manipulate her into bed,” he said, curtly. “And you used her feelings for
to be, believe me,” Snape said ominously, grimacing as he shifted. “Next time, Potter – next time, you are
“I won’t engage in idle speculation, Mr Finnigan,” Dumbledore said. “I can, however, assure you that whoever is responsible for this cowardly attack will be found and brought to justice. But that is not your concern right now. You are all to return to your dormitories and rest. You have been through a terrible ordeal. Prefects, please take a moment to gather yourselves, and then escort the younger students back to your Houses. Unless you need the infirmary, everyone is to return to their dormitories in a calm and timely manner. Stay together. Your Heads of House will arrange for hot cocoa to be sent up to each common room, and then I would like you all to get a good night’s sleep.”
A hand closed over her own. “Pansy,” Narcissa said, gentle but firm. “We don’t know what he’s doing, or how he’s doing it. We can’t stop him. We can only help, and that means helping Harry. They’ll need Blood-Replenishing Potion, as soon as he’s stable enough to swallow.”
But then Draco placed his hands on Harry’s chest, easing him back. “Now, tell me about this Horcrux. The ‘darkness’ Madam Pomfrey spoke of in your core. That’s it?”
Lucius bowed, low. “The wards are up, my lord, just as you designed them. If Potter’s message managed to to rouse any support from the wizarding world, they won’t be able to Apparate in. We’re cut off.”
But Dumbledore shook his head. “I’m sorry, Harry. He may be a child, but he is also a Death Eater, and I believe there is an element to his task we are as yet unaware of. I do not want a child’s soul torn apart in the act of killing me, but I am equally determined not to leave this school unprotected. If we offer him sanctuary when he is not
But the next scene was of the Manor’s ballroom, where the Dark Lord often held court. He was seated on the garish throne he had built for himself, looking pleased. Dumbledore’s body was at his feet. There was a commotion, and Draco’s mother was dragged into the room. She was emaciated, weeping sores on her body. The Dark Lord waved a hand, and Bellatrix stepped forward. Her lips moved, and there was a green flash.
“It only takes one mistake,” Snape warned. “One moment of letting your guard drop in the wrong company... Don’t take any chances, Draco. Not until we figure out what is wrong with your Omega.”
“You –” Draco made a strangled noise. “How? They were all destroyed, that’s what the Prophet said –”
She shook her head. “No, please don’t. This is something Ron and I have to sort out for ourselves. I just wish he wasn’t so stubborn. He’ll probably avoid me for
Harry looked at him blankly. “I did this,” he said. The furniture had been smashed beyond recognition, mattresses torn to shreds, curtains ripped from the windows, the statue of Carrow knocked over. Pansy had  sheltered Narcissa in a corner, and no one appeared to be hurt, but… He grasped a fistful of Draco’s robes, trying to steady himself. “I sent Rookwood away.”
And then she took in his position; curled up in a tight ball on the bed, face pressed to his knees, his shoulders suspiciously still. Everything about that was wrong. Draco was constantly in motion, with all the elegant, smooth movement and restrained power of a predator. The only time she saw him really at rest was when he was asleep, and then he was almost angelic in his soft stillness.
Draco’s father was the last to stand trial, apparently. The reporter expected him to be fully acquitted; a combination of his own actions during the final battle, his son’s heroics, and the shrewd move by his lawyer to delay his trial until the very end. After hundreds of trials, rushed through the Wizengamot, public interest had waned. Their lust for vengeance had been sated. Voldemort, the first to be sentenced (though he had not been allowed to step foot in the Ministry), had been in Azkaban for a month. Very few people cared about Lucius Malfoy now.
“The man made of stone in St Mungo’s might argue with that, Mrs Malfoy,” Scrimgeour said, gently. “If, of course, he was alive to make his case. As he is not –”
Severus whirled away, lashing out at the nearest wall. He cried out, cradling his hand as he slid to his knees. Dumbledore eyed him impatiently. He looked the very picture of despair, tears slipping slowly down his sallow face. Really, he could be tiresomely sentimental. Usually all that was required was a firm hand to bring him back into line, but clearly this situation required a little more finesse.
Draco was quiet for a long moment. “I wouldn't be happy about it,” he admitted. “But it’s not up to me, Harry. And it’s not up to them, either. There’s a large part of me that wants to wrap you up in magical protections and keep you safe and warm and pregnant at home – wherever that home may be – but I know that wouldn’t make you happy. And that wouldn't make
“I can’t tell you,” Draco said. But he bowed his head to Harry’s shoulder, and Harry slid his arms around him automatically. He was truly worried now. Draco rarely, if ever, initiated their embraces, and never in public. He was adamant about keeping their relationship from the rest of the student body. What on earth was going on? “I didn’t mean to,” Draco whispered. “I didn’t mean for it to die. You have to believe me, Harry, I n-never –”
“I made a promise, Seamus,” Parkinson said, and her face might have been stone for all the expression it showed. “One night, one date. He has the right to claim it at any time. That was our agreement.”
Pansy shook her head. Blaise’s face was blank now; unreadable. He knew as well as she that Draco had been Marked. “I can’t speak for him. But I do want him out. Against his will, if necessary.”
! Harry thought desperately, and Pickering did pause briefly. But then he shook it off, and, panicked, Harry scrabbled in his robes for his wand.
!” Creevy squawked. He had scrambled up and was dancing in place, looking for all the world as if he needed to go potty. “I’ll get rid of the picture, I swear! Just don’t break my camera, please!” He actually whimpered when Draco tossed it up in the air. “Please! Let me show you! I’ll do it right now, I promise!”
Draco hesitated. “At the start, it was passive," he said. "At least, on Harry’s part. I could feel everything from him. He could never conceal a single emotion from me, and I thought that went both ways. That was how it was supposed to be. But... I discovered fairly quickly that I could hide my feelings from him.”
The missing diary. The Dark Lord had been furious over it; blamed Draco’s father for the loss. And yet, mere months later, despite what had seemed to be an irrevocable fall from grace, his father had been granted permission to lead the mission to the Ministry of Magic. That second chance had never made sense to Draco. But if his father had given the Dark Lord information about that lost ritual…
“I think it would suit you,” said a drawling voice from behind them. Harry found himself breathless and eager and, incomprehensibly, smiling as he turned. “After all,” Draco said, his hooded eyes lingering on Harry, almost
“Draco,” Pansy said. “You’re not just a war hero. You’re the Saviour of the Wizarding World. If you really think it’s possible for me to elope and have a half-blood heir, against all conventions and without my father’s approval, you can adopt, surely. If anyone can upend centuries of tradition and prejudice, it’s you two.”
“Harry!” he cried, and something in his voice must have alerted his lover, because he pulled back. He licked his lips, looking disappointed, and it almost sent Draco right over the edge.
“Idiot,” Daphne said, sounding shocked. He’d half-turned as he pulled her back, shielding her with his body. “What were you thinking?”
“If he thinks I’m worth it,” Daphne said. For a moment, there was an open, vulnerable expression on her face; of fear, and hope. “He’s gentle, and quiet, and serious, and far stronger than he knows. Stronger than
Harry was silent for a long moment. “So I’ll lose everything he gave me? My ability to speak Parseltongue?”
Reed began to chant, moving his wand quickly. Madam Pomfrey cast some kind of spell over his chest, and held it there. She directed Weasley to cast a pain-relieving spell.
Blaise turned. His eyebrows rose. “Ginny,” he said, that small smirk still playing on his lips, and suddenly Ginny wanted nothing more than to slap it right off his face. “So you are. How can I help you?”
But the bond was open, and Harry had always been better at using it for wandless magic. “Forgive me,” he said, swallowing. He made a gesture with his hand. Draco collapsed instantly. Only his mother’s arm around him saved him from hitting the ground. Snape's wand jerked up in instinctive defence. “Just asleep!” Harry assured them, quickly. “He’s fine, I promise! I just can’t let him stop me. For his sake, as well as the kids’. Will you keep him here, when he wakes?”
He aimed for Hermione first. She was well hidden in a dense thicket of shrubs, but only Hermione knew and could cast
“That was postponed until next week. They can’t really hold a trial without the plaintiff, and Malfoy –” He grimaced. “Sorry.”
She handed a sheaf of papers to the panel of judges, and Pius Thicknesse flicked through them, his thin eyebrows drawn together in a frown.
It could have been hours or days later that Harry found himself lying on his stomach on Draco’s bed, his Alpha’s knot tying them together for the third time that day, pumping him full of cum. He was sore, and tired – exhausted, really – and he couldn’t even remember how they’d made it up from the dining room to Draco’s bedroom. He suspected they might have Apparated at some point, and was just grateful they hadn’t ended up Splinched. Or worse, in Draco’s parents’ bed. He was too tired to laugh at the thought, but he rather wanted to.
He only realised he still had hold of Draco’s hand when Draco pulled it away from him. He could vaguely hear his lover speaking, and the distant sound of Zabini’s screams as he warded off Bat-Bogeys, but it was like white noise in his ears.
He landed in a Hogwarts hallway not so very different from the one he’d left. Pansy was on her knees, chanting an incantation in front of a mirror that was vaguely familiar to him. There was a tapestry on the opposite wall, showing a reflection of Pansy’s back. Draco remembered reading about something like that in one of the many books in the Manor library.
A body went flying back from the line, thudding into the wall. Hermione flinched, ducking. A massive shadow passed over her.
Vince hunched his shoulders, sidling past the irate Death Eater to the door. His father looked furious too, his face dark red, which usually promised a good
He wanted to thank him, but the Aurors shuffled Lucius and Narcissa out of a side entrance immediately after the trial, in case of retaliation. Harry thought the concern unjustified; very few people, and even fewer reporters, had attended the trial, and those who had seemed far more interested in what Harry had to say than the actual verdict.
It was an odd feeling. Not... unpleasant, exactly. When Harry had first shoved his magic into him, it had felt like lightning, searing through his soul. His whole body had been agonisingly alight with it, thrilling with the power of the storm. Now his own magic had accepted it, embraced it, it felt mostly like
Draco sucked fiercely, and Harry’s knees weakened. He fell forward a little, fingers digging into the bark of the tree.
He was still using the potions, if a little more sparingly now. Even with Potter’s Time-Turner, it was difficult to keep up with everything. Especially when he was increasingly tempted to spend the whole night on the Vanishing Cabinet, and go back in time to do his homework. The half-life of a normal dose of Invigoration Draught in his system was just nine minutes, now.
The door clicked open, but Harry didn’t move. He’d learned the hard way to respect Divination and those who were gifted with it. “Can you see my future? If Draco and I… if we’ll be all right? With – with everything, and the war?”
Robert was sitting with a group of his friends at the head of the Slytherin table, and Pansy slowed her pace when she came up alongside them. He glanced up, and she caught his eyes with her own; held them just a fraction too long. His gaze turned from confused to calculating to predatory in seconds, and Pansy relaxed.
Harry shook his head. “If I give you his name, you’ll go after him, Draco. You know you will. And that will leave me unprotected in the middle of my heat. You said it yourself: I’m vulnerable like this. ”
Not once in her life could she remember Philena Parkinson ever spitting the epithet Mudblood, or being cruel to house-elves, or even speaking down to the less fortunate. She had been beauty and grace personified, inside and out. Her father – oh, Donald was the stereotypical pureblood bigot, with all the characteristic Slytherin flaws and a good few more besides. He had loved them, though, Pansy thought, despite all that.
There was no answer, but really, he hadn’t expected one. He dropped the sweet cakes in the goon’s dainty hands instead, and went on his way, comforting himself with the knowledge that Draco had taken the shepherd’s pie with him, at least.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I think you know the answer to that.” He shrugged. “As to whether I could have gone through with it… maybe. Maybe not. In which case, Dumbledore may have succeeded in dying anyway, at Snape’s hand. I am not the only one whose decisions impact this war, or our lives.”
sorry,” she offered, after a moment. “I was angry, but that’s no excuse. All I know is that I’ve never seen you as happy as when you’re with him. It’s nice.”
“If you insist on invading my privacy, you can hardly complain,” Draco told him, slipping under the covers. He stretched deliberately, making the lean muscles in his chest ripple invitingly.
He was half-hoping his Alpha wouldn’t hear the whispered words, but Draco just pulled him impossibly closer and said, “I know. You’ll always love me, now. That was never in question. What’s important is that you know I will always love
Draco left Arithmancy with his mind not on numbers and equations - or at least, not those they were currently studying. He’d spent the entire class wondering if perhaps he was concentrating too much on the physical structure of the Vanishing Cabinet, and not enough on the structure of the magic itself. He’d tried fixing the magic before, of course, but not with a focus on Arithmancy. And really, everything boiled down to numbers and equations.
It was swift and brutal. With the villagers, they had the Death Eaters outnumbered, but the Death Eaters were ruthless. Several of the villagers were killed, almost immediately. Pansy almost tripped over the woman who had so bravely come out of her home first. Her pretty blue eyes stared blankly up at the trees. Pansy rolled into the trip, all too aware of how easily a split-second distraction could kill.
“We did it,” he said, unable to look away from the body of the wizard who had caused so much pain, so much grief. Voldemort had
mad,” Malfoy breathed, wide-eyed. “Potter, the Dark Lord wants you dead. If it wasn’t for his direct orders,
Draco scrambled to his feet and almost ran out the door. He was back in less than a minute, throwing a blanket around Harry's shoulders and tucking it in carefully before feeding him the potion.
“You won’t tell him how you feel?” Pansy asked, curiously. An insight into the mind of Daphne Greengrass was exceptionally rare, and never free, but she was determined to take advantage of it. “Why?”
, and he dreaded to think how his fellow Omega was feeling. He wasn’t even sure where some of these bruises on his body had
Draco eyed her cautiously, thinking it was probably a good thing she didn’t know that was just his overflow storage. He kept most of them upstairs, in the Room of Requirement; close at hand, for when he needed them most.
“You made a sanctuary in my mind,” Harry continued, almost as if he hadn’t heard him. “Do you want to know what I was thinking about, while you were torturing me?”
to feel like a man, Zabini. If you weren’t good enough for Draco to even consider letting you near his arse.”
Harry stared at the old wizard, his friend and mentor, and tried not to feel betrayed. Suddenly he didn’t mind the arm Draco slid around his waist; his whole world was tilting on its axis, and the contact grounded him, a little.
“There’s a girl called Adeline in our Transfiguration class,” Eliza offered, at last. “She’s Slytherin, but she’s always been nice to me.”
Malfoy stared around the room, obviously wondering how he’d managed to get stuck partnered with Harry Potter. Parkinson nudged him again, and he scowled. “Fine,” he muttered.
“Oi!” Harry said, rubbing his ear reproachfully. “You were born a White Mage. That’s not my fault.” He used a squall of air off the sea to sweep Draco’s feet out from under him. Draco landed on springy moss which hadn’t been there a moment ago, bouncing gently. He retaliated by flinging the ground under Harry’s feet up, throwing him off balance. Harry fell, and the ground he landed on wasn’t nearly as mossy. “Ow,” he groaned, rubbing his arse. “Not fair.”
be pleased. “I don’t know how,” he said, helplessly. “I’m sorry. I don’t even know what I did. I was just so
“Yes,” Shacklebolt agreed. “But Gawain Robards is the best Auror we have, and a fine leader. He is respected by the wizarding public and the Wizengamot alike. Dumbledore petitioned the Minister to have him removed from the prosecution, but I am afraid Scrimgeour is steadfast.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said. He ripped Harry’s shirt off, baring his skin to the cool air. His nipples pebbled, and Malfoy bent to take one in his mouth. Harry shouted, trying to twist away and push into it at the same time, the warmth and sucking pressure almost unbearably good. Malfoy slung an arm around his shoulders and held him close with a hand on the small of his back as he kicked Harry’s feet out from under him, guiding him gently to the ground. “I’m going to fuck you,” he said, and bit down savagely around his nipple.
Draco didn’t meet his eyes. His hands were clenched into fists. The whole room was quaking. People were panicking, fighting to get to the entrance and get out. A reporter tripped and fell head-first down the stairs, screaming. Professor Flitwick caught her with a flick of his wand. He gathered her close to him and the other children, a bubble of protection forming around him. He was shouting something in Harry’s direction, but Harry only had eyes and ears for one person.
Or at least, three Houses did, waving their newspapers around and shouting at each other. Slytherin was dead silent.
Future-him raised a hand to wave, and Ron waved back, struck by how bizarre this was. Future-him looked – different, somehow. Maybe because he was three days older? He’d
Well, almost everyone. Pansy had been in that little room in St Mungo’s. She’d seen Potter’s power. She knew he didn’t have control over it yet. Whatever emotion had evoked this latest storm, it had clearly been unintentional.
“Of course, if you report Cardosa, the Dark Lord will know I told you his name, and I will be killed for betraying him. So I suppose that’s off the table.”
Draco dove out of the way, one hand slashing down. The rock flew at his aunt. She shrieked in surprise, only just managing to divert its course. It hit the kitchen stoves. The entire row exploded into flame. Harry could feel the heat from where he was pinned against the wall. Draco was already moving his other hand. The ground beneath Bellatrix rumbled, and then the flagstone right under her feet shot up in the air. She lost her balance and fell.
Harry was partnered with Hermione, who went up to get their potion ingredients. His attention wandered again.
“Then it’s interesting,” Draco told him. “Not bad. Haven’t you ever been curious about its origins?”
She almost wished she’d thought to do this for her own classmates. But the seventh-years were having their own party tonight, and two illicit gatherings were probably more than enough for the professors to turn a blind eye to.
“Ron and Hermione said the same thing yesterday,” Harry said. “They want you to help, by the way. I don’t reckon Dumbledore would have left any books unturned in Hogwarts, but Hermione thinks you might have access to resources the Order doesn’t.”
“I blamed myself, of course,” Dumbledore said. “And the boy I had given my heart and body and soul to… he turned into a Dark and terrible wizard, as you know. The world will always remember him as an evil tyrant, while I cannot help but remember him as my first love, shadowed though it will always be by pain and guilt. I learned I could not trust my own judgement, Harry, and I learned that my lust for power was my greatest flaw, and what I must at all costs avoid. It was a very sobering realisation to come to at just twenty years of age.”
“The first one since Salazar himself,” Pansy agreed. “It is one of the rarest gifts. He is Salazar’s Heir.”
. Your subconscious is associating any Dark magic I cast, regardless of the spell’s actual intent or outcome, with how you felt when – when I used the Cruciatus Curse on you. How I felt.”
Voldemort sighed. The sun was dipping towards the horizon, but the moon wouldn’t be in the right position for some time yet. “So be it,” he said, and cast
. It might not be permanent, like Voldemort’s, but it was still a claim, of sorts. He raised his eyes to Draco’s again, and saw the knowledge of it reflected there. “Just for one day,” he said. “Please? You need to give your body time to recover. Just for one day.”
"Look, I say stupid things sometimes. Well, most of the time, really, but that's who I am. You have to believe me when I say I do want to make this work. I think we could be great together, I really do. If you tell me what topics are off-limits, I'll try not to joke about them, OK?"
"Just milk, thanks," Harry replied. He realized he really liked this adult version of Malfoy and that his crush was caused by more than Malfoy's admittedly stunning exterior. He was still snarky and a git but somehow, Harry thought, there was much more to him beneath the surface than he let on. He hoped Draco would let him see the deeper side of himself soon.
"I'm no expert at memory loss, darling. But let me tell you one thing. I've never seen you as happy as with Potter. You were made for each other. By the way, if you ever tell anyone I said that I will hex you all the way to Scotland. How about you go to him and have that first kiss all over again?" Pansy asked slyly.
Draco thought about it, really thought about it. He never thought Potter of all people was facing the same issues Draco had to battle every day. He'd had a crush on Potter for years, longer than he could actually remember. Would it be so bad to give in once, to know what it was like to be held in someone's arms, to know the feel of someone's prick up his arse?
"Of course, you couldn't have known. How could you have? You didn't open my letter and you didn't respond to any of Granger's Patronuses," Malfoy scowled and his hands went up as if he wanted to choke Harry. Malfoy's fingers flexed into fists, then straightened involuntarily. For a second Harry thought Malfoy was going to give in to his urges. In the end, Malfoy composed himself and Harry didn't know if he should feel relieved or disappointed.
Harry piled fried eggs, bacon, and toasts on a large oval plate, and arranged it on a tray next to two glasses of organic mango juice, Draco's favourite, and two cups of tea. He picked up the tray and yelped when he noticed Draco standing in the doorway.
The door opened suddenly and two witches stepped in. They immediately started whispering and Harry reluctantly pulled away. He glowered at the witches and they fell quiet in an instant, squirming uncomfortably under Harry's intense glare. Harry took Draco's hand in his and intertwined their fingers resolutely. He sneaked a peek at Draco from the corner of his eye and noticed Draco's soft, pleased smile. He knew their display of affection would end up in the Daily Prophet but he couldn't care less. He would Incendio the paper just like he'd burned every single copy that had landed on his desk in the past three years.
Harry cast a heating charm on the only large fluffy towel he owned and wrapped it tightly around Draco's body.
"I think so too. He's really smart and he knows so much about ghosts. You wouldn't believe how much I learned today," Harry started recounting his day excitedly. "There are so many ways to protect ourselves from the ghosts. By the way, I have upped the protection around your flat. It turns out that lavender and iron are a good way to ghost-proof a household. Malfoy also told me there are different types of ghosts. Specters, Poltergeists, Changers, Cold Maidens. It's really rather thrilling!"
"It makes sense, that the residue the ghosts sometimes leave behind would be formed of the same substance they are made of," Harry hummed.
"Come on, no time to soothe your virginal ego," Potter chuckled. "We've got to move, there's a robbery in progress at Gringott's."
Draco turned around and let Harry see the astonishment and happiness on his face. "I love it. How did you get the flowers so fast?"
„Fuck you, Draco!“ Harry shouted. „Just fuck me already, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me! I want you inside me right fucking now!“
Harry cast a Disillusionment Charm and felt Draco do the same next to him. They climbed the stairs leading to the large bronze door, the entrance to the Gringott's Bank. The door was slightly ajar and Harry's spine prickled with goosebumps, his intuition warning him to be careful.
„You sound like Hermione. Speaking of Hermione, don‘t tell her anything, please. Don‘t tell anyone anything,“ Harry ended the conversation decisively. „Cover for me, will you?“ he added over his shoulder, already on his way to the Ministry Atrium.
"I love you," Draco kissed him on the temple, then extracted himself from Harry's tight grip and grabbed Harry's hand in his. He turned back to the Head Auror and Minister.
Harry nodded numbly, his feet carrying him to a nearby toilet. His hands were shaking profusely, his breathing was ragged. He was in shock and knew he had to try and think rationally. There was nothing he could do at the moment. He could not rush in and save Draco from this. Draco would make it. Draco couldn't die, not when Harry never told him he was in love with him. He would wake up and Harry would tell him. Harry started mechanically scrubbing his trembling hands with soap, watching the traces of Draco's blood disappear down the drain.
The hostages jumped to their feet and ran as fast as their stiff legs could carry them. Draco went last and guarded their retreat with a wide-range Protego he'd cast around them. He knew that the bigger the area of the spell, the weaker the Shield would be as a whole but he didn't see any other option if he wanted to make sure everyone got to safety.
„What the bloody hell is Malfoy doing here, Harry!“ Ron exclaimed, going for his wand. In a span of a few seconds, his face went pale, turned a shade of dark blotchy purple, and settled on green, which clashed horribly with his ginger hair.
„Oh, yes, please. You‘re so beautiful, I can‘t,“ Harry was nearly choking with want. His head fell heavily on the pillow. Draco swirled his tongue over the head of Harry‘s cock, reveling in the taste of the person he loved more than himself. He finally took the tip in his mouth and sucked it lightly. Then, without warning, he took Harry in one long, sensual motion all the way to his throat.
"You make me," Harry giggled. "Apparently, you hate pubes getting stuck between your teeth during blowjobs."
"I'm not going to listen to any more of your vile lies. You're going to pay for taking him away from me," Ginny shouted and readied her wand.
"I…," Draco hesitated. Something in his gaze softened slightly, as he took in Harry's distress. "Look, I'm not sure why I'm here or why you're being nice to me all of a sudden but… whatever you want to hear me say, I can't. I have no idea what you're talking about, Potter."
„We‘ve run several trials to confirm the initial results. I am afraid I have some disturbing news for you, Mr. Malfoy.“
"Why would you go out to a club on Friday night, if not to get drunk?" Ron stared at him in disbelief.
„Ginny, I‘m sorry I didn‘t tell you earlier but I didn‘t want to say anything until I knew it was serious,“ a knife of suspicion twisted inside Harry‘s heart. Their relationship was serious, he knew that deep down. He could not let the self-doubt, that the Dursleys managed to instill in him, influence his relationship with Draco. He had to trust him. He continued on, ignoring the stabbing pain in his chest. „You know we can‘t ever get back together. I love you but not like that.“
They stayed like that for what felt like hours, gently rocking against each other, until Draco came on his stomach and Harry inside him, filling him with his seed and love.
Draco's breath hitched. The sight of Potter's naked arse was exquisite, his hole twitching in anticipation, the balls hanging heavily between his legs.
"Why the hell would I laugh?" Harry asked. Did Draco truly believe Harry could laugh at him because of this? Surely Draco had to know Harry would never do that.
She glanced at the clock on the wall and cursed under her breath. It was nearly half-past eight and she'd forgotten to eat again. She reached over her paperwork to the plate of sandwiches that Harry had brought her before leaving on his first mission with Draco. She wasn't hungry at all, her stomach churning with worry, pain, loss, and desperation. She felt sick when she imagined having to take a single bite, chewing the crusty bread that had been sitting on her desk untouched for hours. She almost gagged at the thought of the slickness of the mayonnaise slipping down her throat. She forced herself to take a bite anyway, for the baby if not for herself.
