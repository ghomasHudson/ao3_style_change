Harry looked at the setting sun. From this position he could see only pink traces on the sky behind the trees. He wondered if it had settled yet. Malfoy sat at his side.
,” she raised her voice a bit at the end as she usually did when explaining something painfully obvious.
“He... It will be... I think I’d better go and start to pack my trunk, you know. One week will be over sooner than you know, it's always like that before something...” She stood. “I’d better go. Have a nice evening and don’t forget to start packing.”
Malfoy glared at him, although the effect was slightly ruined by the rising colour on his cheeks. Harry tilted his head and the recent memory flashed through his head, the one of Malfoy with closed eyes and raised palms towards the snow. He supposed that Malfoy, in fact, really did seem gentle.
After an hour of lying in bed in the dorm, Harry heard the door softly opening. He closed his eyes and fell asleep.
Today Ginny told him she loved him and the answer stuck in Harry's throat. When he swallowed the numbness, these words went down to his stomach, causing the heaviness that wouldn’t go away. Ginny didn't say anything but she didn't need to. Harry had enough of voices in his head already.
Harry didn’t bother to go for the broom and uniform as he was already in the coat, and really, he could retrieve all that later. When he came to the usual place, Malfoy wasn’t there. Had he not come yet? Harry frowned, he just now realised they never agreed on anything, Malfoy just simply was here every time Harry came and that was it. Harry looked around.
“You’re not so quiet on a broom as you think you are,” he said, unimpressed, “following me, are you?”
Harry raised his wand and threw the first hex that came to mind. It was a quite strong Stinging hex and the boy yelped in surprise, his friend flinching just as badly.
Malfoy helped him? Harry realised that Malfoy could have just as easily gone and gotten Hermione from the library nearby as soon as he’d seen Harry.
“Hermione, I—“ He didn’t really know what to say, he never did these days. He sighed. “It’s okay. How’s Ron?”
Harry reached the door. He swore he heard hushed voices. He couldn’t decipher what they said, but they didn’t sound kind. He grabbed the old handle, swinging the door open.
“I would give anything to remember what happens in reality when I'm here,” Draco said bitterly, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them.
Everything had fallen into a routine once classes started. Ron seemed like his old self most of the time. Sometimes, though, Harry noticed his thoughtful and distant looks or the gentle ones he directed at Hermione, or the slightly worried ones when he looked at Harry. They hadn’t been there before. Hermione tried to hold them together as hard as she could, acting excited and talking Harry into conversations. Harry smiled at her and Harry smiled at her because, even if her efforts did sometimes wear on his nerves, he was grateful for her efforts. He had good friends.
During the holidays the storm came and they were unable to get outside as much. At first, it was unfamiliar, to meet that way in the castle but soon they got used to it too. Harry asked McGonagall if Draco could help him work on the ruined corridor Harry was rebuilding. She gave him a curious look and said that they could help each other because Draco himself was working on the part of the castle. Harry could keep the serious face with some difficulty, all he wanted at that moment was to go find the prat and snog him senseless.
Ron stared in disbelief and Harry heard Draco breathe in sharply. Harry felt like they both had a lot of questions and a pang of guilt went through him at the thought that he couldn’t give them. He doubted that, even if he spoke to Ron, he would be able to explain what was happening with Malfoy. They seemed to be making some kind of… friendship?
Hermione blinked a few times. She then smiled with relief that Harry didn’t want to acknowledge was there.
Hermione had even given him her homework to copy without a word. Ron was constantly acting awkward and Harry clearly saw he didn’t know what to say. And all of that was so akin to pity, he wanted to shake them. Yes, he didn't want to talk, but
“I do not like this forest. You should wake up.” Draco remarked almost distantly, not looking at him.
Someone was crouching near and calling him again. Everything was blurry and he couldn’t tear his eyes from the entrance to the passageway.
Suddenly, Draco pulled back a little, Harry still felt his rapid breath on his sensitive lips. Malfoy laughed so brokenly, making Harry returned to reality abruptly.
He slowed at the edge of Harry’s bed, stopping awkwardly. Harry now could hear his breathing. Then Malfoy raised a hand and reached for Harry. Harry’s breath hitched. But Malfoy hesitated and his hand hung halfway to Harry’s arm. He breathed deep in and pulled it back to his side, closing his eyes for a second. The tension seemed to escape his sharp shoulders.
Malfoy swallowed and met Harry’s gaze. He wore a haunted expression, pained and defensive, but after a moment he relaxed a touch and shifted his hand with Harry’s wand towards himself. Harry let him, not letting go for some reason. Malfoy aimed the wand at himself and murmured a spell that filled the dark room with a faint purple glow. A pleasant tingle ran through Harry’s fingers where they were pressed to Malfoy’s hand, magic pulling a little from him in a familiar gentle way. Malfoy sighed with relief, standing straight (Harry hadn’t even realised he was leaning so heavily on the desk). The moment broke when he shook off Harry’s hand with an affected expression of annoyance.
“You’re my girlfriend, ‘Mione, aren’t you supposed to, you know,” Ron was muttering to Hermione, offended, “
You get obscured from my line of sight by someone and it’s almost a pity. I could watch you all night, I know for a fact. All faintly uncomfortable with the attention, jerky movements and unsure smiles, but still undeniably bright. Oh, you’re a star.
Draco looked at him and relaxed slightly. A comfortable silence hung between them for a while, broken only by the distant noise of the river and the clatter of the invisible dial. The sun was pleasantly warming the left side of Harry, for some reason it seemed selected from a certain memory.
Harry smiled to the memory. It seemed now like a story from so far away, almost made up. Under the eyelids, along with dancing red circles, there appeared some images from memory, too vague in a dream to distinguish, but still causing Harry's chest to contract slightly with nostalgia. He opened his eyes and turned to Draco and found him studying Harry with a peculiar expression on his face. Harry knew that expression. It made his heart to clench unpleasantly, but so desirable that a hot wave passed through Harry. He could not take his eyes off the grey ones opposite. They always reminded him of a stormy sky.
Malfoy wore grey and black, his family was tangled in dark magic, Voldemort lived in his house, he aimed Harry’s wand at Harry, but… It was the hair, really, the skin and light eyes, blue veins barely visible underneath the skin of his wrists. Malfoy was light, for some reason. No matter how shitty Malfoy made himself act, Harry saw much more darkness and threat within his own self. That silly light Harry wanted so desperately seemed to catch on Malfoy so easily.
He hadn’t even noticed how Ron and Hermione stopped arguing (of course there was more lecturing than anything for the last minutes) and now Ron was whispering something to her quietly. She nodded and then briefly squeezed Ron’s hand when he stepped back.
As he exited the Great Hall, he let his legs carry him wherever they felt like. He didn’t care if he missed Potions. Slughorn would probably forgive him, as he seemed to have taken his fondness for Harry this year to a whole new level. So far he hadn’t had much trouble in classes, most professors were giving him some time as well and hadn’t questioned his silence. But McGonagall’s look told him the leniency wouldn't last forever. His throat constricted again and he walked faster.
Harry breathed heavily. He wasn't used to talking this much but now he was holding back a flood of words. His wand hand shook.
When they were out of the warm Hall, Draco hadn't stopped, turning towards the dungeons, not looking at Harry... After a minute of the fast pace, Harry started to feel confused.
“Yes, okay, saved me some more, are you waiting for a medal, Potter?” Malfoy grimaced in irritation, maybe a genuine time, Harry couldn’t quite tell.
?” Ron began to flush slightly from all the arguing, and Harry noticed that there was hardly any colour to him these days. “There’re Slytherins!”
The hallways were mostly empty, bathed in the dim blue light from the windows and the many little warm ones from the torches on the walls. Everything was blurry at the edges and Harry liked it. His quiet steps echoed off stone, the portraits murmuring something to each other. The castle felt so familiar and welcoming. It looked fondly at Harry from the tall ceilings and arches, the stone walls and flickering fires, from its deep shadows in the corners. He let himself walk a bit slower, liking the feeling. It felt like he was looked for, cared for.
“Potter, tell me,” The words were distant as though coming through the layer of cotton. “Do you hear the clock?”
"Ugh, I can't believe it," Malfoy muttered irritably, "You just can't be a normal person, can you? Can't stop thinking that you’re better than everyone. With this idiotic empty stare on your face, not thinking anyone deserves your attention, huh? I know it doesn't work like that, you’re supposed to forget—"
She nodded, a little hesitant, but then nodded again and smiled a little, coming to hug him fast and tight. He hugged her back with real gratitude this time. The vaguely fruit smell of her hair in his face was reassuring as always, and dearly familiar.
He supposed he should go flying. At the thought, an idea struck him. Harry almost cursed himself and went up the stairs to his dorm quickly.
So he kept rolling his eyes in exasperation at both of them and waited for them to act normal again.
Tingling on the back of his neck told him he was being watched. He turned from his buttering process and looked too. Malfoy. Harry fought down the stupid smile on the familiarity of it. Malfoy hadn't done that in a long time.
But he didn’t look at Harry much. Harry realised that before yesterday Malfoy had looked at him a lot because now it all felt off. They didn’t frown at each other at breakfast as usual. When they were leaving for potions and crossed ways Malfoy looked at him briefly with the most indifferent expression, just like the rest of the students near him. Harry had no idea why this felt so wrong, more so than the constant insults and scowls and smirks he was used to.
“It’s fine, I’ll give you both some then.” She paused, looking at Harry again. “Mr. Potter, you look confused. Any questions?”
“In the dorm with the bag,” he said and it sounded like a challenge. When Harry just frowned in confusion, he sighed again. “What did you think, Potter? That after
Malfoy was panting, running his gaze all over Harry's face, which made him feel very conscious about himself for some reason. He licked his lips nervously and Malfoy's eyes were there the same instant. A shiver ran through Harry.
“Well, yes,” she started a bit smugly, “actually, I was corresponding with McGonagall for a bit and she told me that this year all eighth years will have additional projects as well as our regular classes. I don’t know for certain what it will be but I’m excited! And…”
Now he was hurrying outside (Ron and Hermione were nearly late to the Hogwarts Express since they took so long trying to persuade Harry to go). Harry didn’t look at the map, he simply knew Malfoy would be in the usual place. It was morning and gentle snow was falling from the painfully white sky. Perfect weather for Malfoy to come.
As soon as the lecture ended, Harry was quick on his way to the Pitch. Ron tried to ask him where he was going, but Hermione was, apparently, very distracting with her animated speech about her homework results. Harry just smiled and waved at him, assuring he will be in the common room soon and really “I just want some fresh air”. Which wasn’t a lie. Very lame truth, maybe, but not a lie.
Harry sat for some time, trying to calm down. Eventually, he laid down and stared at the ceiling. There was no breathing of his roommates, no sound of Ron tossing in bed and Neville’s occasional muttering. Harry realised with a pang that no matter how long he would lay here with open eyes, there would be no door opening, no Malfoy coming quietly into the room and going straight for his bed. Harry instantly felt agitated.
don’t like this. Please tell Ron everything’s fine because I won’t be writing sappy notes to him as well.
Fuck. I move to the side just a step and I instantly catch your eye. A shock goes down my spine, a sharp little thing. Were you looking for me? You were, weren’t you?
You’re the centre of the night, of the world. Would you just shut up, I’m tired of that story. I’m looking, see?
The classroom was even darker than the hallway. But a dim blue light glowed in the corner, suggesting Lumos. Harry couldn’t see clearly who it was but at least now he could hear more clearly.
He gasped in disbelief. Malfoy licked gently at his lower lip and Harry closed his eyes, his mind melting into the warmth and all the thoughts left in quick succession. He kissed back, Malfoy made a quiet desperate sound and the kiss deepened, cold hands cupped Harry’s face, moving his closer. Something almost painful constructed in his chest, gripping his throat and making him moan.
Then Malfoy was kissing him. Harry didn't have a second to comprehend when it started and the next thing he knew he was slammed into the wall with a strong body. He opened his mouth to gasp and immediately hot tongue was sliding past his lips. Eyes fluttered shut automatically, there was nothing left except for the hot sensation of a deep hard kiss, Malfoy's tongue was persistent and their teeth collided painfully. Malfoy tasted of pudding that was for dessert this morning and Harry felt like he started to float away. He didn't notice the moment he started to respond, but an answering deep moan against his mouth made him shiver. Fuck. He wanted to hear and feel more.
Not a lot, Harry thought. From their year there were Zabini, a girl with dark hair Harry didn’t know, a boy which Harry vaguely recalled as Theodor Nott. And Malfoy, of course. He didn’t think it would be so hard even if he would be unlucky to get one of them as a roommate, there would be still a lot of his friends and people he knew around.
Harry bit his tongue just so he wouldn't say that Malfoy was so, so dangerous to him. Malfoy was everything but safe. Of course, Harry knew better than to say so.
Malfoy evidently found what he was looking for and stood, sighing. He was a couple of beds down from Harry’s, right in the blue light. He looked pale and haunted with sweat faintly glistening on his forehead, the hand uncapping a potion was shaking. He downed it fast and placed the empty bottle on the bedside table.
The Hufflepuff guy, Wayne, seemed nice. He had dark blond hair, a big nose, and heavy glasses. He looked at Harry with wide eyes, not saying anything to him, and Harry was thankful for that. Neville was familiar and great to talk to, or, rather, listen to as he told Harry all about his new fascination with a species of plants they we’re going to learn about this year. Harry smiled and nodded along, grateful Neville didn’t expect him to say anything.
Sometimes I think I worship you. Other times I hate you, of course, and the percentage I’ll leave for you to figure out.
I drain another glass of bubbly champagne. It tastes mostly like nothing but it tries to make up for it with all the bubbles. I bet we’re similar like that.
Nothing changed after that. Harry had no idea why he thought it would. Really, it made sense, he couldn’t suddenly become Malfoy’s friend after helping him one more time. If anything, Harry would understand if Malfoy was pissed at him.
‘Again’ hung in the air but Harry was quite sure both of them heard it. He felt embarrassment crawl up his skin.
The Hogwarts Express released its first blasting whistle along with a billow of steam. It was comfortingly familiar, one of the first truly magical moments of Harry's life. He closed his eyes as the sound died out. Hermione liked to say that it was a second chance, a new beginning. Harry felt like he might throw up from thoughts of Hogwarts; he remembered all too well the exploding hallways and the Great Hall full of bodies that he couldn't save.
Ron and Hermione are walking in front of me. I'm nervous. When we arrive at the door I can already see him sitting there. He turns his head and looks at me. There it is, the same look as in the train. I feel my cheeks getting red. OH NO.
I leave the arena but decide to stay in the hallway close to the lockerrooms. Harry is the last one to leave. He sees me and stops. "Eh hey, thanks for coming today. I feel like you gave me some good luck." Harry smiles.
"Bloody hell Harry, have you seen a ghost?" Ron asks. "It was just Malfoy, I hope he and his gang will leave us alone this year."
Dumbledore's voice speaks loudly. "Dear Hogwarts students. Please give a loud applause for today's players and let the game begin!"
I'm getting ready. In a few minutes we will enter the field to play against Hufflepuff. They have gotten better over the summer. I feel like I have never been more nervous. If Draco is actually here watching. I can't lose!
"Well, I feel like it was better then last year. But you know how the Dursleys are"... "I'm glad to go back to Hogwarts!"
I'm about to get on the field and already can see Harry standing there. I see him looking at me and I quickly look away. I wonder what he thinks.
When Snape finish his announchement I can feel Potter staring at me. My heart races. Every class... I couldn't help thinking about our moment in the train. I can't figure out the way he was looking at me. I want to say he looked like he felt something too. But it was probably just fear. The whuss. The guy fights Voldemort, but is scared of me. How ironic.
"Hey Harry!" I turn around. "Oh! Hey Ginny." "Haha did I scare you? You are blushing." She giggles and the gives me a kiss on my cheek. "I quess I'm just a bit tired from the game. Do you mind if I go?" "Oh, no sure! That's okay. I'll talk to you later then!" She says.
Draco leaves me behind stunned. What did just happen??? I decide to go to the nurses room before I talk to Ginny. To take care of the scratches and I take out my phone to text Ginny. "Ginny, I need to talk to you, can you meet me at the brigde in an hour?"
The rest of the train ride I couldn't stop thinking about his hair. He did indeed was even hotter then he was last year.
I haven't slept all night. I kept seeing Harry's face. I was so nervous for tonight. I feel like I acted very confident when I baslicly told Harry when and where to meet me. How will it go? What will we do together? Would it be akward?
When I get there I can see her waiting for me already. ”Hey.” She says. She looks at me. "I see Hufflepuff gave you a hard time out there? Also, you are here to break up with me aren't you?" I don't know wat to say. Which actually gives her the answer.
Will be fun to watch him instead of competing against him. I hope other people won't notice me looking at him most of the game though...
Draco takes off my t-shirt and looks at me. He then goes back to kissing and moves down from my neck to my right shoulder. I take off his green Slytherin tie and slowly unbutton his shirt. I can feel him tense. "Is this okay?" I ask. "I don't want to scare you away." He says. He helps me take off his shirt. Showing what his long sleeves are hiding. "I'm sorry you are hurting." I say. And I pull him closer to me and hug him I can feel Draco relax again and after a little while of standing in eacht others arms he kisses me again. I softly touch his arms. His hands taking off my belt and then my pants. Showing my dark green boxers. He smiles. We move to the couch. I push him backward and am now on top of him. We kiss again, I move back to his neck. And bite him playfully. He moans softly. Going back to kissing, moving down to his stomach. He takes off my boxers. I'm now taking off his pants. And boxers too. "You are okay with this?" He asks.
Harry turns around, what is he doing? Few second later he is speed walking to a seat on the other side of the classroom.
Later that night in Bed I decide not to tell them. Not yet. They will only judge me and that would ruin the night with Draco tomorrow. Suddenly i feel sick. Night with Draco, I've never been so nervous in my life... How will it go. What does he expect? I tried to sleep, but failed. Instead I kept thinking about wat technically would be tonight. Since it was 3.05 a.m. already.
”Ahw, Harry! You really like her don’t you! I can see you blushing!” Hermione bumps her shoulder against mine. If only did she know...
When we get inside people from all houses are, as always at their own tables. Dumbledore welcomes us all and the new young wizards get sorted by the sorting hat.
We arrive and with a loud sharp sound the train stops. As we are about to get out of the train cabine, Draco is walking my way hitting his elbow agains my ribs. "Ough!"
It's a hard match. But one hour, a few scratches and bruises after we started I am able to catch the Golden Snitch. We won!! Yes!
What I don't tell them is what made it better. The Dursleys were worse then ever. So it wasn't on them.
I lay in his arms in front of the fire place while he strokes through my hair. "Are you happy, Harry?" He looks at me. "I couldn't be happier this exact moment." I say and smile. He smiles too. "Yes, me neither."
I quickly turn around, take a deep breath and follow Hermione and Ron to some seats that aren't taken while staring at the ground. I can feel his eyes burning in my neck.
He looks around and says, surprisingly in a much softer tone, "Just please watch where you are going, unless you preffer running into me." He doesn't give me a chance to say anything back and walks past. His arm touching mine while passing me. Leaving me stunned. I can feel myself getting sick from the butterflies in my stomach. After standing there for what seemed to be an eternity I go on to my way to the toilet. Making sure I look less flustered before returning to Ron and Hermione.
"Really? That's great, I'm really happy for them. Yes, I am fine. Really. She told me, when we broke up. We will stay friends." I say. It was a relief that Ginny didn't told them about me. I felt like I should. But Draco and I decided to wait until after tonight. So I had to wait.
Harry felt exhausted. He didn’t hear anyone anymore, just a faint hum of healing magic in the air. It was soothing and he fell asleep slowly one more time.
It was just strange, Harry tried to assure himself, it was just unusual to see, that’s all it was. He looked at the clock nervously. Less than ten minutes, and then he would go to the Pitch and not at all expect Malfoy to be nearby. Harry shook his head, earning a strange look from Ron.
After a bit, there it is. That small chuckle. If I only knew that was an option— talking to you like that — I would’ve never traded that for the attention of my classmates I didn’t care about.
Harry glanced for a moment and got caught by the view of a small patch of white stomach illuminated by the sharp square of light. It was glowing, as well as some strands of light hair that were tossed around uncharacteristically for Malfoy. It was strangely, inexplicably… endearing. Harry tore his eyes away in horror.
“Headmistress McGonagall! You’ve brought… Mr Potter, I assume?” She said with a widening smile and a calm pleasant voice. Harry glanced at McGonagall and then nodded.
At first, some tried to follow him and fly together, but it appeared to be very simple to use his Firebolt right and soon they got the message. Ron never tried to push him without an invitation and Harry wasn’t worrying much about the feelings of his most persistent fans.
There were snowflakes stuck in Malfoy’s pale eyelashes and his hair was a mess, cheeks flushed and a cloud of breath coiling from his mouth and Harry couldn’t take his eyes off him.
Harry noticed the little things after that. He would watch Malfoy across the Great Hall at breakfast and catch how he flinched when standing up, rubbing his chest briefly. In potions class, he sometimes bit his lip while stirring; his hands shook when he chopped the ingredients; he fled the classroom as soon as Slughorn dismissed them for the day.
I grab the front of your smart robes and draw you in again, forcefully. I slam our mouths together— ouch — and kiss you open-mouthed and hot. You let out a breath and open your lips.
After a minute or so, Harry finally saw the figure. His stomach gave an excited surge as he lowered his broom further to Malfoy, who stood with his back to Harry.
“Harry, are you sleeping fine? I can ask Madam Pomfrey for more calming potion, you look gloomy today.”
They stopped at the door next to the Hospital entrance, Harry had never been there but he reckoned it was some kind of personal quarters. He glanced at McGonagall.
After some fighting, they finally settled in the snow, breathing hard and unable to keep smiles off their faces. Malfoy cast his warming charm at himself and then at Harry without a thought, not even looking at him, and the warm wave rolled through Harry. When Malfoy looked up in the snow there was a second wave that had nothing to do with warming charms.
“Don’t be, it’s pathetic of me really.” Harry could hear the bitterness in his voice but it was so far from the usual Malfoy bitterness Harry had to look at him again just to make sure.
"I said, I'll tell you, are you deaf or something?" Harry felt a rising wave of irritation. He stepped closer. But suddenly Malfoy's hands were cupping his face. "First, can I— One more time, and then I'll tell you?" Malfoy's heavy gaze fell on Harry's lips, almost making them tingle. "Anything you wanna know..."
“Harry, Malfoy told us where to look and… We’re so sorry you saw that.” Tears swelled in her eyes and Harry felt something snap closed in his chest. He didn’t want to hear about it or see it ever again. He couldn’t stand to see Hermione’s tears. He looked away.
The forest around was whispering in the language of leaves and insects. This conversation was thicker in the darkest of the shadows, living in between the massive trees and bushes. Twilight was coming. There was no one around and Harry lifted his head to the crowns of the trees, which were hiding the grey sky from the view. It was so high that almost no light reached the grass on the forest floor. Harry recognised this forest with a jolt.
Harry felt nervous all of a sudden. Would he have to speak? They would probably talk about the war. Harry felt slightly dizzy.
I smile just a little, involuntarily and baring my teeth just so. We’re not that far now as some minutes ago, I realise, and I can see you pause before looking away at a loud old witch by your side. You practically have to tear your eyes away from me and... Now, isn’t that a curious feeling just in the pit of my stomach?
Harry pushed the door open with a kick, not really aware that he did it until he found himself staring at the two boys turned at him. They were Gryffindors, sixth or seven year, he wasn’t sure in this light. They were standing in a further corner and Harry couldn’t see their feet behind all the desks but he was sure of what he would find. age pulsed through him.
Malfoy was saying something but Harry couldn’t understand. Then Malfoy grasped his hand and Harry felt a faint shock going through his fingertips. He realised he was clutching his wand so hard it hurt. Pity he didn’t care much.
Malfoy snorted, apparently amused at the sight of him, stuttering through apologies. Harry couldn’t entirely blame him.
Harry stared. He actually wanted to learn more. How did Malfoy deal with these attacks, why had Harry never known they were a thing, why did Malfoy get them a lot?
“Sometimes I think it's torture,” Draco sounded almost strangled. Harry knew what he was talking about.
"Well, yeah, but I like you more," Draco said with force, "If you couldn't already tell, you idiot."
Malfoy smirked at him bitterly. “Ah, I’ve got the honour of welcoming the Saviour himself to the wonderful world of panic attacks, how lovely. Yes, you’ll probably have more, although they can be rare. Not all of them are as bad as yours yesterday though. I’ve had many and only a few like that. Usually it’s just a feeling of intense anxiety.” He finished with another smirk.
“And he still thinks he’s worthy to even look at Harry Potter! We saw how you looked at him across the Great Hall… You, disgusting little—“ The was a flash of a hex and another yelp.
Their eyes met, and Harry held his breath as he looked into those stormy orbs. Thunder again snapped from above, the wind intensified, lifting grass and fallen leaves into the air. The trees trembled furiously with branches, dropping the rapidly yellowing foliage. The glade was gradually losing life. Harry raised his hand and held it to Draco without touching. In response, he raised his, slightly trembling, to Harry's palm. They seemed to be on both sides of the mirror like this, copying the gesture. Harry didn't feel the heat of the skin. His heart swam with resentment and the desire to just touch and feel another living person.
Harry woke up on the hospital bed some time later. He didn’t open his eyes because he wasn’t sure there was something out there beyond his head, just existing. He felt lost in a wrong time.
His head wasn’t thrown back as the previous time and Harry couldn’t see his face which caused a bit of disappointment prickle at the back of his mind. Well, he always could fly a bit to the side without being noticed…
They reached their room just as Malfoy was leaving it, the look on his face full of challenge when he caught the sight of them. Harry and Ron stopped. Ron stiffened and opened his mouth to say something but hesitated when Malfoy slipped his eyes to Harry.
As he was making his way through the corridors out of the castle, he caught some glances and whispers behind his back. Everyone pretty much knew by this point. He wanted to scratch his skin clean of those stares. His best option was to be alone for a while. He found that he liked to walk for some time in the rare autumn sun on the Hogwarts grounds beside the lake. It was calming and nobody looked at him with pity.
. The choking feeling was back with new force, and after a few seconds of silent gaping he felt like he was suffocating. Hermione was looking at him hopefully and it was torture. He really could, he could do it, they meant so much to him and…
“I don’t— need your fucking help,” he panted, face whiter than ever and eyes burning. Harry thought he was just like a ghost in this light, a wild mad ghost. He lowered his hand.
“Of course. Wake up. I will wait for you in the next dream,” he blinked and one tear rolled down the pale cheek. At the same time, the first drop fell from the sky, shattering on Harry's cheek.
The classroom was empty. The windows were boarded up and little light reached the dusty tables. In the deep shadows of the corners, Harry could see there was nothing except for a few old cabinets, half-broken and loaded with glass jars. He didn’t like this room.
“I don’t see how it’s any of your business,” he barked. It was surprising how spiteful he could be barely standing on his own. Or not at all surprising, when Harry thought about it. Harry tilted his head to the side, not feeling the desire to snap back. He had a feeling he didn’t have to say anything.
Hermione grew serious and started a tirade about how they needed to keep together, how the house system wasn’t really great and how they needed something new after all that everyone had been through. Ron looked more regretful with every minute, which was probably because he started the argument in the first place.
This was the last thing Harry felt before waking up. He sat abruptly in the dark, his heart pounding in his ears. He raised slightly trembling fingers to his cheek. Wet.
They would meet and Malfoy would begin to talk as though he didn’t need Harry there and just liked the sound of his own voice. He chatted about nonsense most of the time: a strange dream he had once as a child, his timetable or McGonagall’s wardrobe he found weirdly interesting (‘Tartan, Potter,
Children generally don't like sleep, but Harry welcomed it for as long as he could remember. Except maybe for the times when he dreamed things that didn't belong to his mind. Sleep was an opportunity to escape. The cupboard under the stairs had closed around him securely, and then disappeared in the ever coming dreams, hallucinations and then finally nothingness. There was no one to take his food away, to push him or scream at him in rage for the broken plate. Even the dreams weren't so generous.
Harry snorted. He’d just run off two witnesses that had seen him staying in this classroom with Malfoy.
Harry was getting hot all over, almost feverishly so. Under his shut eyes there were images of something unclear. Draco (...Draco?) tugged at the hair on Harry's nape and this was so familiar... What?
“…more time. It’s the best you can do, more time and patience and everything will be fine.” She smiled reassuringly at them and Hermione nodded violently. Harry felt a wave of affection for her. Ron looked just as serious and determined.
The next thing Harry felt was Draco kissing him. Angrily and no less dangerous than his eyes. The intoxicating warmth and sweetness were right next to painful biting and collision of teeth. And yet it was the best kiss Harry ever had.
“Have you finished the essay for McGonagall? I realised it’s due today only when it was late,” Ron sent a sheepish smile to Hermione, who only huffed and sipped her tea.
The grey eyes were sizing him with annoyance. Malfoy grimaced and wrinkled his nose in such a mask of displeasure that was screaming of hatred. Harry grimaced in return but didn't say anything. His throat was stubbornly not working. Malfoy rolled his eyes and turned away, walking fast towards his table.
“You’ll what? Curse me? Or punch me in the face?” Harry heard another sarcastic snort. “Try me, you waste of—”
“You know, it’s not that bad that you don’t talk,” he said. Harry realised he was referring to what Ron had said to Harry the previous evening.
Harry's heart skipped a bit. His name sounded so unusual from Draco and yet so right. It was not as sharp as 'Potter', softer and almost gentle. His chest hurt, he squirmed his eyes tightly.
Harry just stared at the door; in the new silence he thought he heard some noise. He moved a touch closer. From the corner of his vision, he could see Ron and Hermione exchange a look. They stepped up to him with serious expressions the next moment.
Suddenly Harry couldn’t breathe. Everything he tried so hard to ignore, to push down, everything was flashing before his eyes. The dead on the floor in the Great Hall, the exploding wall right behind Fred, the faint smile on his dead face, the fiery beasts roaring in his ears, the smell of suffocating smoke, the cold light of the killing curse, his mother’s smile and the burning Sorting Hat on Neville’s head—
Eighth years weren’t allowed to play Quidditch this year, it so Harry just developed a habit of flying by himself to clear his head.
Suddenly Hermione knocked over her goblet of juice, and Harry startled. She squeaked and drew her wand to vanish the mess. Harry looked at her. Not that he hadn’t noticed,z but she was a mess today, hair more wild than ever and a lost look on her face. He frowned, concern blooming in his chest.
You don’t look at me and you look amazing. All windswept hair getting in your eyes, warm-looking skin just above the collar of the black robes, your jaw set and angular lines of your profile, Merlin, I could go on and on. I hate you for how negligently good you look.
“Malfoy,” Harry called, trying how far gone he was. Malfoy didn’t budge. “Right…” Harry mumbled, reaching out in an attempt to change his position (he couldn’t just levitate the git in this awkward pose all the way to the Hospital, could he). But as soon as he touched one bony wrist, something shot up his nerves like a small electric shock and Malfoy flinched, opening his eyes and breathing in suddenly. Harry pulled back in surprise.
“How am I going to ‘fuck off’ if your weasel face is right in my way?” he said in an ugly tone. Harry had forgotten how ugly it could be. Malfoy scowled and moved to pass them.
All the eighth years now shared a common room. That discovery wasn’t met very warmly. Although, Harry felt a bit grateful because that gave Ron something to fuss about and he became more like his usual self for a bit.
My head hurts because of that, because of everything, I hate this place, these people. I used to love ball nights as a child, you know? It fit me, everyone looked at me with smiles and attention I so craved. And the worst thing is, you see: I still want it, want for everyone to look at me with fake smiles and adoration. People change their assumptions about you quickly and now I’m not in their mercy.
Harry couldn’t help but search with his eyes for Malfoy everywhere. It was no surprise that lately he and Malfoy rarely crossed paths. Harry was constantly surrounded by someone (with or without his will) and Malfoy… Harry still couldn’t believe how quiet he was. Almost no Slytherins in their year returned to Hogwarts and those who did seemed to ignore Malfoy altogether. Harry never noticed it before. Of course, Malfoy himself didn’t seem approachable, he constantly scowled at nothing in particular and kept to himself. Harry was starting to doubt that he saw Malfoy after all.
Finally, he reached the changing rooms and got into the uniform quickly. He grabbed the Firebolt and then hesitated before the door out on the Pitch. What was he doing? It was ridiculous, really, and stupid and uncalled for. He shook his head and sighed before opening the door and squinting and the light. After his eyes became accustomed to the white landscape he stepped out.
As if sensing Harry’s eyes on him, Malfoy raised his head and unerringly found Harry. His blond hair was longer and messier than Harry had ever seen it, one lock covering his left eye almost completely. Malfoy scowled at him, raising his chin higher and sitting straighter. Harry blinked. He hadn’t realised how hunched over he himself was sitting. He straightened too and tried to scowl back. Malfoy grimaced and turned to Zabini dismissively.
Harry himself didn’t know how to feel about Malfoy in their room. He wasn’t as angry as Ron was, that was for sure. He could say he didn’t really care that much but… Harry shook his head, he wasn’t going to think about it. He stopped on the thought that he just didn’t like Malfoy still and that was it. They were climbing up the stairs, Ron still muttering to himself.
“What the clock is doing in the forest?” The sharp silver of his opened quickly eyes glittered in the sunlight.
Someone slammed into his shoulder after he turned the corner and Harry stumbled back in his way. When he regained his balance he looked up. And blinked a few times at Malfoy, who was blinking in return, looking surprised, but it didn’t last long and after a second a familiar scowl was in place. Harry almost sighed.
Walking in casual haste I think. Now, what do people who have been enemies—scratch that, rivals— a school bully and a hero that bullied each other? — when one nearly killed the other and then saved a couple of times from death; what would they have to say to each other?
Voices. They were harsh and then there was something like laughter. Harry tried hard to decipher them but the door was too thick. Then he suddenly heard a yelp and after that more laughter. He frowned.
The kiss became more frantic and they lost any track of time, clinging to each other in the cold snow, only breaking away to get some air and start again.
Then Harry saw him getting up and walking to the archway cautiously. He looked inside and after a moment stumbled back. Harry couldn’t see his face clearly but he assumed it was terrified. He felt a strange dark glee inside as Malfoy made a few steps and fell on his knees.
“You have nothing to worry about, Mr Potter, believe me,” McGonagall told him in her stern but unusually soft tone. She always spoke like that to Harry lately.
She sighed patiently. “I was talking about the next year at Hogwarts. We have only a week left, you do realise that?” Harry blinked at her rather stupidly. She rolled her eyes. “I told you already...”
When he emerged from the changing rooms with his beloved broom in hand, everything around was covered in the white blanket. This refreshed the previous layer of snow and made Harry’s eyes water because of the brightness. The Pitch was blissfully empty. Harry mounted and took off from the ground.
The door appeared and Harry went through. The passage was dark and narrow. The raw stone surrounded Harry from all sides but he ignored the uneasy feeling and moved farther, lighting his wand to see. It wasn’t a very long trip and soon Harry saw a bit of light from the other side hidden in the archway. He sighed with relief, the darkness and cold started to push down at him. Then he smelled something strange. It was barely-there trace that wasn’t one bit pleasant. Had some student left a bit of food here? Harry grimaced and quickened his steps. When he came closer to the end of the passage something caught his eye. He paused and aimed his wand slightly to the bottom of the wall. It was a dark spot. Pretty big but somewhat faded. Harry frowned and came closer.
They fell silent only when he died. It happened almost every night, except ones during that he didn't sleep. Dark silence enveloped him thoroughly and carefully, pushing on the ears and eyes, penetrating his mind through them. He welcomed it because then heavy 'I love you too' disappeared like sand through fingers slowly until nothing was left and he didn't have to say it anymore. There wasn't
Malfo tugged at him, steadying him and saying something. When Harry’s stomach was empty, he leaned back against the wall. Everything was cold and he couldn’t take a full inhale. He realised there had been tears streaming down his cheeks for a while because the new ones felt hot against his skin. Malfoy waved his wand and the smell of sick disappeared.
The mind healer came on the next Tuesday. McGonagall fetched Harry after Defence and told him to follow. They went in the direction of the Hospital Wing and Harry frowned.
He looked at Draco sideways, finding him already staring at Harry. Harry stumbled a bit, something catching in his throat. He felt annoyed with himself. That was happening more and more often. Malfoy looked away, frowning a little.
Still, Harry was glad Malfoy hadn’t. Harry was glad his two friends hadn’t seen that. It made sense that it was Malfoy, in a strange way. Harry had seen him beaten on the floor not so long ago. He fought against a humourless laugh. They were a mess, everything was a fucking mess, and everyone pretended it wasn’t. They went to classes, chatted with friends and snogged after curfew in the corridors. And all the while somewhere there was a stain of blood behind an archway.
What a curious little thing, isn’t it? You, drifting closer to me, of all people. God, have you forgot who you
Harry wanted to ask if she was okay, but the now familiar tightness of his throat that appeared every time he thought about speaking wouldn’t let him. He frowned and nodded.
You draw away after a bit. We look at each other. I don’t know what you see but I see everything I ever wanted. I huff out a laugh.
"Of course I'd believe you because you have never done anything of such, huh," Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy tsked in response.
“Sorry,” Harry almost smiled at how Malfoy seemed to lose all the spite in favour of surprise. Then he frowned and seemed to collect himself again.
Harry should have known it will be like that. During the next few days Ron and Hermione were looking at him in this sympathetic way, they talked tentatively and helped with everything.
“What is the point if we do not exist in reality?” Draco stopped laughing, his voice a little louder than a whisper.
After some time, the door finally clicked open. Against his better judgement, Harry felt relieved. But something was wrong. Harry didn’t see anything, but he’d listened to Malfoy coming in enough to know what he normally sounded like. And this time, his breathing was all wrong, shallow and slightly strangled as though he was trying to keep it as quiet as possible. He took a couple of steps and then stumbled. There was a thud of a body crashing into the carpet.
I smile. "Yes". I take a moment to admire the person I see. "You are beautiful". "So are you." he says. We kiss again and I can feel him touching me. I do the same. I can feel that my heartrate goes up. I can hear him breathing and feel his hot body against me. His hands start to move a bit faster. I moan and I follow to do the same. "Faster." he whispers. I can feel our bodies tense, while we keep kissing. "Faster."
Two days later, I'm about to walk in the first class of the year. The first class of Draco being in the same room for every class, and every day. I will definitely fail this school year...
”Potter? Potter! You're there?” He waves in my face. "Uhm, yeah! Sorry?" "I asked when the next game is." "Sunday, we will be playing against Hufflepuff" I answer.
"Ha, yes we know, they are bloody annoying." Ron laughs. "Ginny wasn't easy either this time though. She kept talking about you Harry!"
Ron and I agree, that sounds fun. Would be nice to have something to kill the time with. The time doesn't actually goes faster when you keep looking at the clock.
I can see him look at me in the doorway. Potter, butterfly's storm through my stomach. Shit, I don't want to feel this. Make it stop.
"Well, I decided to go for a walk, and I then saw you walking too. I didn't want to walk behind you, like some creep and decided to ask you if you'd, eh, like to walk together?" He said.
I'm trying my best not to scream and look too happy. They won! I'm actually so proud of Harry. It seemed like a painfull match. The seeker from Hufflepuff played agressive and Harry looked tired.
I still feel the butterfly's racing, the face he made after running into me made me smile. I wonder what he was thinking about so deeply that he didn't see me standing there. Must have been very important.
3 lessons have passed. We have a lunch break now. I lost eye of Draco and have no idea where he is. Maybe for the better. I tell Hermione and Ron that I have to go to the toilet and meet up with them in the Great Hall.
The following day it's Saturday. No classes. What means no Potter to deal with. I will have some time to catch up what I missed in classes the past days because of him. But nothing was less true. How can I ever focus when I keep thinking of him... I wonder how the game wil go.
But at the same time I see a twinkle in his eyes. I blink. He walks past and I wonder if I imagined the twinkle. Is he...?
"Yeah, no problem. You played very well again. Does it hurt though?" I softly touch the bleeding scratch on his face. I can see him tense but he doesn't move away. I take back my arm and decide to go for it. "Harry, can I tell you something? You have to promise not to tell anyone. Okay?" "Sure, okay." Harry nods.
"No need to be so agressive Potter, I wanted to congratulate you." Draco said. "You were great out there." he added.
I look up... Draco is standing in front of me and stares. "Potter! Don't you have glasses?? I feel like you should have seen me!" He snarls.
"That's great Harry, remember that we are here for you. You want to watch a movie or so tonight?" Ron asks. I don't know what to say. "I slept really bad actually. Don't know why. So I think I'll go to bed early. You should go watch together though!"
On that note our Slytherin players take position. I'm now right across from Harry. We share a quick look before we hear the start sign. In a split second he races after the Snitch and I start chasing Harry. Slowly getting besides him and take the lead after. This goes on for about ten minutes before he pushes me to the side. I push back. For a minute I forget about the Snitch and Harry takes his chance and is able to catch it.
My heart is pounding. I just came back from the most amazing walk with Draco. Draco, of all people. And he actually liked him back. We talked so much. It was amazing. I still feel nervous for tonight. Will that be just as great?
On my way to the library I feel guilty. I should tell Ginny the truth. She deserves that. "Hey Ron, Hi Hermione." "What did Malfoy want?" Hermione asks. "Nothing much, he actually told me I played well." "Haha, bloody hell Harry, and you believe that he meant that?" Ron laughs. "Oh well, at least he wasn't mean to me. Could have gone worse." And I leave it at that. We spend the rest of the day reading and making homework. Since we have a test this upcoming Monday.
"Draco?" ”Yes?” He said "Uhm, eh, will you come watch? N... not me, just the team?" "Eh yeah sure, I think I can come watch you Harry, uhm… the team I mean." He walked away.
While walking back to Crabbe, Parkinson and Goyle, I was wondering if Potter knew I touched his arm on purpose. Would he feel the same way? I wish I could tell him. Would I ever find the courage?
Our teams leave the field and after showering and changing into clean clothes I go find Ron and Hermione. I find them in the hallway talking. "Hey Harry! You were great! Congratulations! Did you see Draco's face when you caught the Snitch? It was great!" Hermione laughs. Her face gets serious all of a sudden and I look behind me. Draco is standing there. "Potter, can I speak to you for a moment? Alone?" Ron and Hermione look at me, i nod and they walk away. "We will be in the library Harry." Ron says. That's okay! I'll see you guys there." I respond.
I'm nervous, this afternoon we are playing quidditch against Gryffindor. Nothing is more hot then Harry trying to catch the Golden Snitch. Us racing against each other... I'm getting more excited. Goyle noticed and asked: "Jeez Malfoy where are you so happy about? Already thinking about the victory later this day, are you?"
Professor Snape ends the evening by telling us that for this year two houses will be taking the classes at the same time due to the fact that we don’t have enough teachers. When he then proceeds to tell that Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw will be joining for classes which means that Slytherin and Gryffintor will be joining classes. My heart jumps. This will mean I'm seeing Draco at every class!
The place looks amazing. There are candles flying eveywhere. There is a fireplace soft music a couch and a bed. I feel myself getting nervous.
"Oh okay, we'll do that then. Do you want to hang out right now though? I heard dinner is an hour late so we will have to be there around 7.30 a.m. We will have enough time to play a game if you two want?" Hermione says.
"You like someone else don't you? Did you ever liked me?" She says ”Ginny, I'm sorry. I didn't want for this to happen. I do like you. I just think, not in that way. I'm sorry. I thought I did. You mean very much to me!" I take her hands. She pulls them back. "Who is it? Tell me, I have the right to know!" She is a bit angry now. "I'm so sorry Ginny. I never meant to hurt you. I'll tell you. But you can't tell anyone. Not yet. And promise not to laugh. I know you are angry. And you have the right to be. But please promise." I can se her looking confused now but she nods. "It... It." "Jeez Harry say it!" She almost yells. "It's Draco" and I stare at the ground. Total silence. Then I hear a giggle. "You promised not to laugh!” I'm sorry, I'm sorry" she giggles. "You are serious aren't you?" She hugs me. Now I'm confused. "I always thought there was something going on between you two! I thought I was wrong when you said yes to dating me." She says. I'm lost for words and she continues: "I can't be mad at you now. I actually am happy for you." She turns red. I have been wanting to talk to you too for a while now... I look at her. She continues, "I think i'm in love with someone else too. I have been denying it to myself. But since you have the courage to tell me. I feel like I should be honest too." I'm baffled. She then says "I think I'm in love with Luna..." I smile. "Thank you for telling me Ginny, I'm sorry if I hurt you." "It's okay Harry” She says. "Thank you for trusting me and telling me this. Will we be friends?"
We won! Gryffindor won! It didn't feel like that, I don’t want to win like this. Draco lost focus for a second. Why? I couldn't let that chance slide though.
"I heard you and Ginny broke up. I'm sorry, are you okay? She told us." I'm shocked, what did she tell them??? "Oh really? What did she say? I'm okay, I think it is for the best." I respond, hoping Ginny didn't say anything about me liking someone else. Or worse, me liking Draco.
The question interrupts my thoughts and I stammer: " Uhm yes! We are going to finish them!" Questioning what I meant by that.
Harry’s mind became as peaceful as the quiet snowfall enveloping him, full of little things that didn’t make an impact and seemed to melt under his breath.
Malfoy shifted and a cloud of breath curled from his mouth, melting slowly in the air, weightless. Something strange constructed in Harry’s chest, heavy and sharp but sweet and vaguely familiar. He turned and flew a bit faster than was necessary.
They were going from the DADA down to the Great Hall for lunch, Ron chatting away to Hermione about the lesson and how hungry he was, when Harry noticed an open classroom. It was one of the abandoned ones, judging by the dusty door and a dim light that was visible just so through the gap in the door. Harry paused. After a couple of steps Ron stopped mid-sentence and looked back, frowning.
“Yes.” Hermione seemed more collected. She glanced at Harry, frowning. “We’re just worried, Harry. You hadn’t talked much before and now…” She looked back at Madam Pomfrey. “Could it be an illness, Madam Pomfrey?”
He focused his full attention on her. She had an expression on her face he was becoming used to more and more. Her mouth was turned down slightly at the corners with exasperation or concern, Harry couldn’t really tell. Her pleasant brown eyes glittered with sympathy and her brows were furrowed. She obviously had something to say, maybe even snap at him because, really, for goodness’ sake, it wasn’t the first time she had asked him if he was listening at all and he lied that yes, “of course.” But she never snapped at him these days. Instead there was a lot of understanding and concern and sympathy, and Harry hated it.
Harry got up quickly, hid the map and hurried out. His uniform was in the changing rooms (he asked Ginny, who was the captain of the team, for a place to keep them and she agreed). He broke into a slight jog when he was in the last couple of corridors. There weren’t a lot of people in the halls and that was good because Harry didn’t want to imagine how ridiculous he looked right now.
And then Harry threw himself at Malfoy, pinning him to the snow and hovering above. He had no idea why he’d done it but Malfoy was now so close and looking at him with a shocked and open expression, eyes wide and strange looking.
“I think you have to go to Madam Pomfrey,” said Harry quickly. As soon as the words were out of his mouth he knew it was the wrong thing to say. Malfoy jerked his head to scowl at him.
When they were dismissed, he reminded his friends about going to the Library and tried to look as relaxed as one could while being as nervous as possible. When he was making his way through the castle, Harry cursed himself mentally. What was wrong with him? That was ridiculous, to be so…
Draco Malfoy settled near him and sighed too tired for someone who just appeared for Harry’s liking. Harry pointed out his familiar pointed features through some slight fog; the pale skin, graciously warmed by the sun. Malfoy half-closed his eyes, relaxing a little. His light eyelashes were slightly trembling in the sunlight. For some reason, he looked like he was glowing quietly.
He didn’t talk all the way to the castle. Ron walked by his side, looking a little sick himself. Hermione chatted the entire way, but Harry recognised her nervousness. She and Ron were holding hands.
. The forest enveloped his figure with shadows the moment he started to make his way through the trees. The rustle of leaves and songs of insects was thick in Harry’s ears forming one whole buzz, sometimes it changed the loudness to almost uncomfortably loud but the next second it was barely audible. Wild thickets in his way were not a problem, they let him pass obediently. Soon there started to unfold a small clearing in between the tree trunks. Without the layer of the crowns above there was blinding sunlight. Harry flood with relief thinking he could finally get a little warmth.
“Ah, I believe a mind healer would be more of value here. That’s not my area of healing, not exactly, Ms Granger, but…” Pomfrey looked at Harry in question and he realised she wanted to tell them about panic attacks. He didn’t like the idea much but he supposed there was nothing for it. He nodded. “We already discussed with Mr Potter his panic attack earlier, I believe you know what it is?” Hermione nodded, while Ron looked confused. She glanced at him and mouthed ‘later’ just as Madam Pomfrey continued. “It was a serious one and I can’t say I’m not concerned. I can’t give you a diagnosis, but I already contacted an acquaintance of mine who specialises in mind healing and she should be here in a week.”
“You try,” he sneered at Ron, and this close Harry could see a glint in his grey eyes. Then Malfoy was past them without meeting Harry’s gaze, and Harry couldn’t help but catch a bit of his smell in the air stirred by his movement. It smelled mostly like nothing, but with a bit of something sharp and overall almost pleasing. Harry immediately tried to forget the thought.
“Malfoy,” you say, after a bit. You say it as if tasting something awful. I smile wide. You’re such a dick.
“I was watching you first,” then he moved forwards and Harry felt a warm press of lips to his mouth.
He stared at the light spilling from the windows. Some dust was lazily flowing in it, as though stuck in honey. Harry watched and listened to Malfoy’s breathing. Floating particles danced slowly to Malfoy and back, disappearing as soon as they left the light. They were hesitant to get lost in his white tossed hair and steady breath, and Harry understood them just fine. It wasn’t any good to get tangled in another person. In Malfoy. The glowing particles, though, seemed to be drawn to him nonetheless. To him and back, and then again in slow floaty movements.
Malfoy didn't even flinch to acknowledge him, he slightly picked up speed instead. No one was here at this time, and Harry thought absently that if Malfoy intended to hex him here it would be pretty perfect circumstances. For some reason, the thought amused him.
“Yes, indeed,” she laughed a little and Harry decided he liked her. “Okay now that you know a bit about me, let’s begin.”
“Come on, Potter, Madam Pomfrey would know what—” Harry stumbled on his legs and Malfoy caught him around his middle.
Suddenly for no apparent reason Harry glanced at the Slytherin table. Very few students sat at it, Harry realised. The younger years sat close together at one side of the table, not raising their heads. The half a dozen older students were spread across the table in twos and threes. One blond head drew Harry’s eyes. Malfoy sat near Zabini with his head low, not eating either. Harry vaguely thought that he especially shouldn’t be here.
On the bed next to his slept Draco Malfoy, just as light as everything else. He was breathing steadily, facing Harry on his side. His grey pyjamas and darker grey blanket contrasted against pale skin and almost white hair. Harry noticed the way his mouth was slack, open just a bit, and maybe he even drooled in his sleep. Harry tried to tell himself he found it disgusting.
There was darkness in the corners of the room, the same as under his closed eyes. He tried to look at the moonlit parts, the luminescent squares of blue falling from the big windows. It was unmoving and cool.
Then you kiss me. Your lips are dry and warm and smiling and I freeze entirely, my heart included, apparently.
Draco was silent, looking at Harry as though waiting for him to say something. Then he lowered his head and just sat there for a while on the floor.
He often saw it in the nightmares, with its haunting shadows, quiet but always-present hum, which one doesn’t notice before they left the forest. Harry shivered, he didn't like the place the whole lot. But now for some unknown reason, the thick atmosphere was causing not fear but strange heavy calm. Before now Harry didn’t know it was possible to feel that way at all. This calm pushed all thoughts and concerns away and Harry made a step forward. He realised that he was supposed to find something -
The fourth time they met at the Pitch, the majority of students left for the holidays. Ron was telling him for the hundredth time that Harry was welcome at the Borrow, he was taking Hermione to spend the holidays there. But Harry wanted to stay at Hogwarts, help to repair some parts of the castle that were damaged still, to rest from people a bit because really “you know how it is lately, I just… I would love to go to the Burrow but maybe at some point in the holidays, okay?”
“It is, innit?” You say, hiding that little smile again and looking out into the night. “Why are you here, Malfoy?”
He looked out of the window for god knows which time and that was when he saw the first fluffy snowflakes floating gently from the sky. It was the first snow in a while. He didn’t mind some if it wasn’t bad, a little snow would be even better: there hardly would be anyone at the Pitch. Harry couldn’t suppress a quick grin.
He hadn't told them about what had happened on the other side. It had done things to him, and he didn't want to make it real by saying it aloud. His friends worried enough about him. He liked to remind himself that this was what strong people did - they cared for others, not for themselves.
Harry knew he was right. The sound of the Forbidden Forest around returned, filling everything with a whisper of foliage and insects. The sun faded over their heads. Harry looked up and saw rapidly gathering clouds.
Malfoy snorted humourlessly, nodded and didn’t answer. After a minute Harry asked something he wanted for a while now.
Harry sympathy rising to his throat. He realised at that moment that Draco was living in the same home as Voldemort. He raised his hand slowly, Malfoy tracking his movement warily, then Harry covered the shaking grip. Malfoy froze, staring at their hands.
Malfoy was looking at him strangely. Harry couldn’t decide what the expression was and hurried to fix his stupid out of nowhere suggestion.
Harry stiffened. He didn’t want to have a mind healer sent just because he had a small panic attck for fuck’s sake. Madam Pomfrey seemed to understand.
I fear for a second that you can read my mind (or my thoughts were entirely too loud) because you flick your eyes at me again. Oh, I’m sorry if you indeed are reading my mind: it’s a fucking mess right now. But again, isn’t everything?
All too soon he rounded the corner and found himself in the right hallway. He waved his wand to silence his steps and moved farther. The door wasn’t open this time and Harry felt a bit disappointed. He stood in front of it. He wished he had the Extendable Ears with him as he movedto lean his not so extendable one to the door. He waited for a bit and then heard something again.
Eventually, Malfoy stood and moved to the bed closest to Harry’s, lowering himself onto it. Harry half watched him close his eyes, feeling a displaced longing to touch tingling in his fingertips. He realised how tired he was.
Harry smiled a little, more to reassure her than because he wanted to. Guilt flamed to life in his stomach. He couldn’t even smile properly to his best friend who’d been worrying about him.
You just laugh and laugh and I think I’m fucked. I sneak a glance at you and then you’re looking at me as well and I feel like smiling, your grin is so contagious.
“This sun reminds me of June at Hogwarts, when we were gathering by the lake after exams, remember?” Harry closed his eyes again, turning to face the light. “The third year. Ron, Hermione and I loved to sit in the last days by the lake before the holidays and discuss how we managed the exams. Perhaps this was one of the few years when the end of the term was not overshadowed by anything terrible and I had to lie in a hospital or something ... Not that it was without any adventures, of course!
Madam Pomfrey glanced up at them from the bedside of a small girl who wore a pained expression. Pomfrey murmured something to her reassuringly and walked to them.
“Really, get out of here already.” Malfoy waved a hand at him and Harry frowned. He thought they’d be going to their dorm together, it was pretty late by now. “I wanted to check into the Kitchens quickly, I missed lunch.” He turned away and started to fix his robes.
They hurried out of the door, stumbling over each other in the doorway. As their echoed steps faded away down the corridor, Harry stepped closer to Malfoy, who was still on the floor. With the bastards gone, the conjured Lumos had vanished, and it was too dark to see anything. Harry murmured the spell and lowered to his knees on the dusty floor.
Harry hesitated, opened his mouth to say something but didn’t. He turned and went for the door, looking back at the threshold. He had trouble seeing Malfoy, as he was taking the light with him but he was sure Malfoy wasn’t looking after him. Harry turned and left, leaving the door open for some light from the torches.
Malfoy crossed the hall to one of the empty beds in a few strides and crouched over the bedside table. Harry heard glass bottles clinking.
After some floating the dreams came. The flickers of images and sensations swallowed him fully. There was Ginny with three heads, every one of them was screaming at him the words of love and he was running away. Ron and Hermione were standing on the cliff, looking at him in disappointment. Hogwarts in the summer afternoon and the familiar lake, but full of blood. Then Harry lost himself and observed some story from above about a group of teenagers fighting an evil queen. Near the end of the story, two boys were sitting together some distance away from their friends in the red glowing of the sunset. Then Harry found himself as one of the two. He looked in the eyes of his friend.
Then, “I always loved to be a centre of attention, I guess, and there always was plenty around you.” I say.
.” Draco said flatly and clearly unimpressed, peering into the distant shadows between the huge oak trees with trunks that Harry couldn't get arms around completely no matter how he’d try.
And then he died. It wasn't empty all the way, but for a moment, a glimpse before he met Dumbledore and before he realized where he was, he caught the strange stillness and peacefulness of the white entity. He wondered what that place would become if he stayed. Would it change? Disappear? Blossom into the imitation of the living world? He thought he will discover it eventually.
“Ah, Madam Pomfrey, you see— Harry, he— We want to be as supportive as we can but…” Hermione struggled and Ron stepped forward.
When it stopped Harry didn't notice because there was no Harry anymore. He fell into the shy version of death, enveloped in it tenderly. Love was the reason he lived but now all he wanted was hatred. Because nothingness felt better than the kiss.
“This evening sucks,” you say, as I come to stand by your side a few feet away. There’s something quiet — even a bit soft?— in your voice as if you’re just tired and not speaking to your arch-rival or whatever.
Harry complied, feeling a touch awkward. She settled in her chair and took some papers lying there, quickly skimming them. Then Mrs Wright raised her eyes to him and smiled, slightly more professional this time, and there weren’t wrinkles around her eyes.
Someone touched his hand and Harry jerked sharply in surprise. Ron was looking at him with understanding.
At some point during this month, for some reason Harry couldn’t imagine, he’d started to find comfort in Malfoy coming back for the night, and it was just so pathetic. He closed his eyes and then opened them instantly, not wanting to fall into the darkness.
Harry stared at him. Was he hallucinating someone else as Draco Malfoy? Because he was sure the real one wouldn’t say these things to him. The real one would’ve been cruel and smirking at the way Harry fell apart. He wouldn’t hold Harry’s wet face in his shaking hands and telling him it wasn’t his fault.
“Do you know what a panic attack is, Potter?” Malfoy asked suddenly, a serious expression on his face. Harry was actually a bit grateful and shook his head. Malfoy nodded. “Yesterday. You had one.”
The person entered silently and closed the doors, stepping jerkily farther in. Soon they stepped under the patch of moonlight and Harry opened his eyes wide in surprise. It was Malfoy. His sleep tousled hair gleamed in the blue light, he wore a grey set of pyjamas with a thin dark blanket over his bony shoulders. His face was a little feverish and eyes searching. He seemed not to notice that Harry was awake.
Harry looked around their new common room. It was smaller than their old one and there was no particular main colour. Instead, there were little things from all houses, like a couple of circular canary yellow couches, some trophies in emerald green right above the enormous fireplace made with beautiful red intertwined grape leaves within the stone walls and, finally, at the very centre of the ceiling was a big circular pane of glass to see the sky above. The majority of furniture was in warm wooden shades, the thick carpet was dark with chocolatey stripes as a pattern, there were arches near the ceiling and a fancy chandelier. Their dorm was in the East tower, so the windows and the views weren’t really different from what Harry was used to.
He saw Malfoy when he was preparing to land. Harry almost missed a small figure near the line of the forest, his eyes watering and nose numb from the cold. Snowflakes hitting his face only intensified and no longer seemed insignificant. There was no one around and Harry stopped abruptly some five feet above the ground when that was proven to be wrong. The figure was easy to miss in the constant shimmer of intensified snowfall. Harry immediately recognised the blond head (what the hell was he doing without a hat in this weather) and then noticed how strange the picture was. Malfoy stood with his face turned upwards to the sky and his palms (without gloves) open as well, arms bent at the elbows. Harry was some distance away and Malfoy was turned sideways to him but Harry could see his face clearly. Eyes closed, brows relaxed and mouth slightly opened, sharpness almost gone. Harry shivered, not entirely from the cold. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he wasn’t supposed to see that — no one was — Malfoy seemed so unguarded and relaxed that Harry was not sure if it was Malfoy at all. No, it was him, Harry doubted he could mistake him for anyone, but he never saw this Malfoy. If not for the black coat he could easily blend into the snowy landscape, blond hair and everything. But he didn’t seem cold at all, he seemed strangely human and gentle…
I turn around and look him in his eyes. For a moment time seems to stop. "Can I kiss you" I ask. He nods and before I know it I feel his soft lips against mine. It seems like fireworks are taking over from the butterflies. I can feel our tongues finding each other and I have never felt so happy, this is what I've been waiting for for so long. I slowly move my lips to his cheek, to the end of his jaw and go down to his neck. I can feel Draco's hands moving down a bit. He sights. I kiss his neck softly. He does the same.
We say our goodbyes and get on the train. My head goes back to last year. I wonder if he'd changed. If he'd look even better. Shoot. I should stop thinking about him. He hates me. I bet he would kill me before you know who got the chance. "Harry... Harry!... HARRY! I'm startled. Yes, Hermione? "Jeez Harry, you are with your head in the clouds! I asked if you wanted a piece." She shows me the bar of chocolate and I break off a piece. When I look up I see him walk by. His almost white hair in front of his eyes. I feel the butterflies storm through my body. He looks our way, and I swear he stares right into my eyes for a second that I wish would last forever.
