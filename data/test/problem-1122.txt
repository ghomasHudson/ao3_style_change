for no reason.
Harry’s mind had entered a strange place of discomfort and disbelief as he’d listened, as if he’d been absent for the whole conversation and just walked in near the end to find Draco Malfoy being helpful and borderline pleasant to both him and Bill. Like the world had flipped on its axis and no one else noticed.
Harry nodded. Before he could follow Andromeda, Bill pulled him into a hug. It was a bit too tight, and Harry winced at the lingering soreness, but he slumped forward into Bill’s chest. Bill was big and warm and Harry felt like he was ripping apart at the seams. It was nice. Even if it hurt, it was nice. He’d regret it later, when this was just a reminder of what he’d always lacked, but right now Harry would take whatever he was given.
Harry blinked, face wet and body shaking. His consciousness dropped back down into the cellar. A shout sounded somewhere over his head, but he was already drifting. A chill seeped up into his bones and he realized with an absent kind of panic that this much magic channeled through his body might have killed him. His cheek hit the floor just as the house gave one final pulse. A sense of calm washed over him—and then he was out.
Blood magic. He performed blood magic to banish a malevolent spirit from his dead godfather’s house.
“I swear, I’m not… Just—giving you back your wand. That’s all.”
Kingsley was looking at him when Harry saw it in his eyes, large and dark and always comforting, always steady—Kingsley had always seemed like the one person who would never fail. He’d be there until you were safe. He knew what he was doing and he had the experience and skill to do what needed to be done, the
“Harry,” she said, soft, so horribly soft. “Harry, I’m—I’m sorry. Please don’t— Look at me,
The hawthorn wand sat in his pocket, Harry hyperaware of its presence as he watched Narcissa speaking to Lucius, her hands never leaving her son’s arm or knee or shoulders for longer than a few seconds. Like Malfoy would disappear if she didn’t keep her hands on him. She had the look of someone exercising full control over her emotions, face set and cold and frightening in its severity. She didn’t look like a woman who had just lost her sister. Whose
“Harry!”
Kamau exchanged a glance with Robards, then said, “He was unhinged? Did you notice anything else about his demeanor?”
Memories of Dudley sitting on his chest until he cried flickered through his trembling mind. He’d been so small, so much smaller—but he was different now. He wasn’t supposed to feel like this—

“Four-hundred years, I think.”
He knew Ginny could tell there was something wrong. She had always been so damn perceptive. But she didn’t press him and he didn’t share, and little by little they drifted, and Harry let the space between them grow. Being with her seemed like a different life, one that was simple and soft and innocent. It had only been a year but he wasn’t the same person who had spent months pining for her, thinking she was everything warm and happy and bright in the world, that she was everything he wanted. He wasn’t the same person she had been in love with since she was eleven. The sunny dream he had slipped into when it was just them was gone, and he wondered sometimes if he hadn’t just imagined it or told himself it was what he wanted because it was probably all he would ever get. Because it was what he
Gradually, he grew aware of someone following him. Something of his consciousness flickered into being, wary and tense. His grip tightened around the flowers in his hand. He needed a wand. Where was his wand?
Harry barked out a laugh, an old pain surfacing. “Neither would I. Be pretty in character, actually.”
There was a long silence before the young woman snorted, not unkindly. “That a joke?”
A flash of grey-white light cut through the living room, followed by heat and the quick sensation of all the air being vacated from his lungs. His injured hand was pulsing as if he’d clenched it without meaning to. Pain launched up his arm and slammed into his chest—
“Shall I go tell the new Minister that us poor, put-upon Slytherins don’t like being tagged and watched for a few months after a war that killed hundreds of muggleborns, perpetrated by our parents? How unreasonable, he’ll think. And I’m not even one of the others who can play the ignorance card. ”
They were standing in a room which might have been an attic once, though it was hard to tell because every single inch of it was crowded with boxes. Not just boxes, Harry saw with a grimace, but large cabinets and chests, a few bookcases shoved to the point of bursting with books and parchment and scrolls. It looked, oddly enough, like the Room of Requirement. There were fewer busts of old wizards and piles of discarded treasure, but it carried the same sense of immense, chaotic knowledge which had built over hundreds of years.
“An extremely powerful magical artefact that projects an aura of decay for at least twenty feet on all sides, an archaic form of the Degradation Curse, but much more potent.” She frowned, but kept going, like she couldn’t help but tell him everything she knew about it. “There were only ever five made. Apparently, the wizard who created them was considered something of a madman, because no one ever tried to replicate it. Or if they did, they didn’t live to tell anyone else.”
“But that was a show, obviously,” Ron said slowly, like he was waiting for Harry to agree with him. “That was all to make it seem like he wasn’t with the other death eaters when the dust finally settled.”
“You know where she lives?”
Of course Dumbledore had known what he was doing. Of course.
The pearls snapped into place, rooted where they hung in the air and inside the walls of the house. Harry sent his mind out, finding each mote and activating them. Beams of light lanced down to the tip of his wand, each one of them another facet of the house, honing them inward to a single, overarching thought. The secret that was Grimmauld Place.
Harry had died. Twice.
“I—won’t claim to understand Albus Dumbledore’s motivations,” he started, slowly, trying not to sound bitter. “But I think he believed Draco was redeemable. That his actions so far had been coerced and motivated by fear for his own life and for his parents’ lives.” He hesitated, fighting himself.
“There’s nothing to apologize for,” Harry laughed. “You just…you gave me a bit of a scare, that’s all. You feeling okay?”
“Frankly,” Kingsley said, leaning forward to brace his elbows on his knees, face stony, “you being the victim of these attacks isn’t so much the issue here, Harry.”
He wanted to understand it. He wanted to
he thought with a grimace, shaking himself one last time. “Nothing for it,” he muttered, flexing his hands and cracking his fingers.
They never care about you. You’re
What the hell was he supposed to do?
It was like a shockwave rippled through the crowd, murmurs growing and ebbing and swirling around the circular room like water down a drain.
He was fifteen again and he was breaking.
He hadn’t seen his wand break in Bathilda Bagshot’s house, but he remembered the feeling. Like some string in his mind was cut, a discordant shriek vibrating in his teeth and up his arm.
He blinked his vision clear of ash and sparks, getting only the vague impression of a small group of people gathered on the other side of the room, before the loud cry of an enthusiastic toddler pulled his attention.
He looked down, clenching his hands slowly, screwing up his face. He couldn’t say anything, so he just shook his head.
mind, but to monitor, to make sure they didn’t hurt themselves or anyone else.
He left. It didn’t matter then that he’d always come back. Nothing mattered.
And, predictably, that did it.
He was so fucking done with being special.
Sure enough, there was a huge crowd waiting in the hallway between the fireplaces. No one spotted him at first, and he wondered if maybe he could sprint for the atrium and an elevator before he was recognized.
“I was under the impression any information I gave would remain private.”
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and caught his breath. “Yeah. I think, I mean… I’m not sure, mind, but I think it’s healed. Looks healed.”
“No, I haven’t, m’am,” he interrupted, ignoring the scandalized gasps. “I’ve answered your questions, more than once, mind, but you neglected to ask me what I think should happen to the teenagers you’re charging as war criminals. The same teenagers you’ve decided to treat as collateral in your post-war grudge campaign.”
He managed to pull himself back out. He was staring down at the wood grain of the table. His hand was wet. He’d spilled some ale on it. His heart was still pounding, his whole body telling him he needed to run, to get out of this bar.
The house didn’t answer, because it was a
more like—up to Harry, his eyes sizing up the old woman like she was a piece of furniture at an auction he found wanting. Apparently he judged the combination of colors on her person just as offensive as Harry had, because his expression twisted into one of such bored distaste he had to have practiced it in the mirror for hours when he was younger. No one just
“Thank you,” Harry murmured.
Chapter 6 songs:
That… That was rather nice.
His fingers were trembling so badly he nearly dropped his wand. He swallowed back the panic rising up his throat and tried again,
The second time through was worse. He remembered everything viscerally, to his mild horror. Every detail, every moment—apparently his brain had been storing it all somewhere he hadn’t been able to access without three Ministry officials staring at him. Telling Bill hadn’t been easy, but it had been brief. He hadn’t stopped him and questioned him every few minutes. Robards seemed fixated on the actual attack, what Goyle had done to him.
did he recognize it?
“You never know. It’s all in who you do it with.” She settled down and crossed her legs, folding her hands delicately on her lap. He could see now that they were covered in green paint. “So what did you need, Harry? I assume it’s not a social call.”
“I didn’t say anything.”
his family, but after a while it became hard to find any kind of peace and quiet with everyone clustered around him all bloody day, people coming and going, the house always noisy with someone’s laughter or shouting—and crying, so much crying. he would catch himself staring out over the West Country fields, fighting the urge to just get on his broom and fly until he reached the ocean. He didn’t know what he was going to do when he got there but it seemed sometimes like anything would be better than sitting under the big oak in the backyard, counting down the moments until someone found him and called him back to the house. The wind stirring through the grass and coasting over the hills in waves, pulling him away toward something simpler, somewhere he could breathe. Where he didn’t have to constantly reassure people that he was all right.
“The only offensive thing I can see right now is that suit. Did you fish it out of a bin on your way here, or did you just grab some old curtains and beat them to death?”
Some of the tension in Harry’s gut eased. “That does sound appealing, I’m not going to lie.”
A gasp surged through the room. Kingsley controlled his expression right away, but Harry saw the alarm in his eyes. He saw the opening and he went for blood.
“Oh, my dear,” she said, somewhat choked up, “you sweet boy. Of course you can. I just didn’t want you to feel obligated. You’re so young. I’m—I’m so happy to raise Teddy, but I wouldn’t want you to feel guilty for not taking care of a child when you’re barely more than that.”
His ghosts were still here. He probably shouldn’t feel as relieved as he did about it.
He reached into the box and produced a stack of parchment and a few rather tarnished books, laying them out in a fan on the table.
“And the other two?” Bill asked.
He sat there until Kreacher arrived to call him down to dinner. When Harry got up he felt like part of his tattered, broken soul got snagged on Regulus’s notes as he left.
It was about as blatant a job pitch as Harry could get without the old man outright asking.
His voice was fast and fevered, the light in his eyes turning frantic.
Harry shrugged. “I’ve had worse.”
Heat flushed up his cheeks, heart pounding. He could feel his pulse in his fingers it was so strong. Like he was being dragged to the edge of a cliff and he didn’t even mind.
“What? No, I—” Harry cleared his throat. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with…you lot. I’m not part of the Ministry.”
He wouldn’t be able to deal with the throng of people, his anger shifting and mutating into a rabid animal in his chest the further away he walked from that courtroom. Instead, he took the lift up to the roof and cut in line for the apparition point. People started to protest, but when they saw him—Harry Potter the war hero, with burning eyes and clenched hands—they let him pass.
Crippled by a wave of fatigue, he sank onto the floor and let his limbs all fall to the side. The wood was cool and grounding, the smell of it resinous and sweet, like the first green of growing things in spring. He traced the lines in the ceiling to drown out the deadening thoughts pulling him back under.
Andromeda came in with a tray in one hand and Teddy in the other. He was looking around at all the newcomers, eyes wide and flickering from blue to green to purple and then back to his normal brown.
my wand. I was dying one second and the next Goyle had been… I don’t know what I did.”
“What about the other Slytherin students?” Harry asked, unable to keep a bit of bite from his words. “What about the other ones who heard Voldemort speaking into their minds, telling them they’d be safe if they just did exactly as he asked? And when they’d all been forcibly escorted from the castle minutes later, what crimes were they committing when they listened to their professors and went quietly? They weren’t even there for the fighting. Are you telling me those kids are dangerous enough to warrant punishment in the form of a Class Four Curse, a curse so severe the Department of Magical Law Enforcement made it a policy to discontinue using it in 1845 and only this year reversed that decision to allow its use by Law Enforcement officials, despite the objections of three of your own lieutenants?” He relished the small frisson of shock play across her face. “Because,
“Is that what they’re doing?” Ron asked.
It was the same image he saw out of the greenhouse windows. It looked—well, it looked like an open doorway which led to a place that shouldn’t exist. He stood there, staring, for what must have been minutes, until he smiled.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, vision blurring again. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Andromeda. I’m—”
Exhaling deeply, he frowned, something tugging at the back of his mind. He’d seen this…
So much of what they’d been taught at Hogwarts was regulated and driven by concrete rules and procedures. But the spells they’d learned, the ones in their textbooks and taught by their professors—they had to have come from somewhere, and it was silly to think magic hadn’t changed over the centuries. Just like wands had been invented to allow easier control of magic, spells must have evolved to be more streamlined and easily reproducible. It was wild to think how one might trace the concept of a spell back to an original source, one ancient word or action or will, that unlocked this whole world for whoever that ancestor had been.
And though Kreacher had made more headway into ridding the place of its grimy dimness than Harry would have ever thought possible, he couldn’t shake the memory of Sirius trapped in here alone for almost a year before he died. That sleepless night was the first time in nearly three months that Harry regretted losing the Resurrection Stone. He had sat there in the flickering light of a candle and his own wand and felt the house looming in on him like it was just as lonely and desperate as he was.
“Hey, Harry?”
“It’s cold.”
. London was flush with an overwhelming amount of sensation.
“Right. Patrick. Still sticking his nose places it doesn’t belong?”
Across the atrium he saw Malfoy’s jaw feather, his lips purse. Harry waited, hoping Malfoy didn’t make a scene and cause Harry to regret listening to him.
“Sweet Morgana,” Malfoy said slowly, “is it not exhausting to be so morally superior all the time? That halo of yours must be rather tiresome.”
At least he hadn’t needed to come back here, after everything. If there was one thing to be said for dying, it meant an end to all the pain and anger you held onto in life.
But when he opened his eyes, all Harry could see was Dumbledore’s regret. And it made him want to scream.
“Master is wanting to eat breakfast for every meal?”

Hermione fought a smile. “It is quite nice. Very modern.”
The smell of coffee hit him first, followed closely by the sound of idle conversation, voices low and calm—the latter cut off the moment he stepped through the flames.
kill Albus Dumbledore,” Robards said.
The box was cool to his touch and smelled like spring. He traced the symbol at the base of the roots with his thumbnail, breathing in that fresh scent, reveling in the sense of being outside for the first time in days. Before he could stop himself, he opened the lid of the box. Sure enough, inside sat a book.
The screaming in his head shifted. The ground dropped out from under him. And like a key turned in a lock, something inside him broke loose.
Though, now he thought about it, it had happened before, when he’d finally fallen asleep after Goyle’d attacked him. But he couldn’t for the life of him remember anything beyond the few images he’d woken with. The fire, above everything else. Someone else had been there with him—the only thing he could recall a kind of elegant sharpness, a brightness that made him feel…
Harry’s knee started to bounce, anxiety still flickering through him like a faulty bathroom light.
It was over as quickly as Hermione’s. Harry stood there while Madam Yeats called for further questions from the Wizengamot. Kingsley had refrained from speaking, but Harry hadn’t expected him to. He was well known to have been part of the Order of the Phoenix. People would think he was playing favorites if he interfered. He had to distance himself to protect his job.
You dare defy the Dark Lord, you
Malfoy’s eyes flicked between the wand and Harry’s face. His nostrils flared as he sat forward again. “You think I want it after you’ve gone and spoiled it?”
“Upset,” Hermione said with a sharp look to Ron.
He’d fucking
Harry’s eyes burned with unshed tears, anger creeping up his throat like a serpent and coiling, tightening, strangling.
“I’d like to look at your wand, Harry,” Robards said. “It might help explain what happened.”
Draco stood on the other side of the courtyard where no one else was standing, his eyes wide, searching. His mother had her arms around him, one hand cradling the back of his head, his father bent over him, shoulders shaking.
“Yeah. Was I supposed to know who she was?”
Gellert Grindelwald would have been a light in the darkness, a fire, purifying and raw, confident in his own supremacy and seeing in this ambitious, beleaguered boy an equal. Someone he wanted by his side when he burned down the world.
The connection formed. Harry braced for the force bearing down on him. His center of gravity shifted, his attention focused on the gold bead in front of him. He pushed, pouring his will into moving forward, relentless and constant and unforgiving. He felt Voldemort’s first flinch of weakness, his first reaction to Harry’s conviction. Harry focused his eyes on the bead of golden light, giving everything he had into pushing,
It took him a while to get his delirium under control, until his breathing was as close to even as he could get. As he sat there he felt a kind of peace settle over him. He frowned as warmth leaked up out of the dirt to steady his trembling legs. He stared at the faint wash of magic rising up over him—healing the dirty, jagged lines down his forearms. Harry swallowed the little bubble of alarm that sent up his throat. The blood was entirely dry, brown and flaky, and the edges of his wounds looked seriously wrong, even to his untrained eyes. But he was…healing. Apparently on his own.
Draco’s mouth parted on a question. Confusion colored his fear.
Andromeda’s mouth went thin, anxiety in her gaze as she looked one more time at Harry. Her voice firm, she said, “When you’re done, come get me. I’ll be waiting.”
The silence after was somehow even worse.

and we fought your war and now you think you have any right to
Kreacher nodded. “They are including his notes.” He gestured to the stack of parchment, which looked like they hadn’t even been written on. “In the last weeks of his life, Master Regulus is spending all of his time reading and taking notes. He is sending Kreacher to bring him books and books and books. He is barely eating, he is so intent on them.”
A horcrux could only be destroyed when its vessel was damaged beyond repair. He’d always wondered…because it didn’t make sense, did it? If he was a horcrux, he should have needed to be beyond saving. He should have been well and truly dead for Voldemort to die.
The full weight of it didn’t register until he was pulling on his suit and robes for the last time. He’d bought a few more, again with Andromeda’s help, when he realized he didn’t want to have to clean the bloody things every night. She showed him a handy spell to smooth out the wrinkles too, to make him look less like a rumpled vagrant who collected plastic bags for fun. They were nicer too, and even he had to admit, there was a difference in the cut and the line of his body. He stared in his mirror as he adjusted his tie, smoothed down his simple grey jacket. His image doubled and shifted, reminding him unnervingly of the Mirror of Erised. He was Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the war hero, the person everyone kept expecting great things from—and then he was Harry, the kid who’d come out the other side of a war naive enough to think the world had changed.
One small prick to his forefingers and a sharp lance of energy shot out into the air. He caught it before it could disperse, willed it into a bead floating in the space between his hands. With a grunt, he twisted his fingers, contorting his pinkies into an arc and then flattening his palms, pressing on both sides of the blood, the repulsion between his hands like that of two magnets. The bead rippled and slowly, so fucking slowly, smoothed out into a disc.
It took Harry a moment to digest this. “Malfoy didn’t say he was forced?”
He cleaned the rest of himself off with shaking hands, feeling both like he was about to faint and like he had electricity running under his skin. He was so twitchy he nearly broke his glasses as he shoved them back onto his face and tried to comb out his hair with his fingers. He dried himself cursorily, the wet drops of water from his hair a little chill every few seconds where they slid down his neck. He paced in his bedroom after noticing his sheets were clean and his sweats and ratty t-shirt he normally wore to sleep were sitting folded and neat atop them—the house was doing his laundry now, apparently, since Kreacher was off on a holiday, which was a very weird thing to just accept as normal now—biting his nail to work out some of the energy still crackling through him.
Robards nodded but Kamau frowned. “Sorry—how old were you both at this time?”
“Yeah, but my hair is immune to your mum. She’s tried. Believe me.”
On the ground a body twitched. It was bloody and naked and he couldn’t tear his eyes from the face. He’d done that to her face…
Every one of you who gave a name to save yourself last year has to suffer the same punishment. But you won’t, will you, because you don’t remember what it was like to be a kid and terrified because the people you thought were supposed to protect you fucking
“Think I couldn’t find you,” Goyle spat on his face, his hot, rank breath making Harry flinch as he tried to shove him off. His chest was pounding as he grew increasingly panicked at the lack of breath. “You take
He walked toward the hill from where Robards was just now disapparating. He didn’t bother to look back to make sure that Kingsley was following. The chill was brisk, almost uncomfortable, but he welcomed it on his bare skin, his t-shirt riding up in a sudden gust of wind.
The photo album Hagrid had given him all those years ago, with his parents and Sirius and Remus. The framed photo of his father, his mother’s letter to Sirius slipped in behind, the one he’d found in Sirius’s room after Snape had gone looking.
than the kind of magic he was used to. It felt primal, a base, ancient kind of magic that went beyond incantations and spells and wands. It felt like truth, like simplicity, when his life for so long had been complicated by lies.
Chapter 7 Songs:
- "Lily's Theme" by Alexandre Desplat
“I did, actually.” He wasn’t even lying. He’d closed the floo but he hadn’t known Kreacher was holding his mail. “I didn’t know you were trying to reach me.”
Voldemort’s eyes flicked back and forth, scanning the dome for a way out. His mouth twisted. Harry heard a broken, furious cry of rage spill from his thin, reptilian lips. He shouted but the words got lost over the swelling song, the arcs of light.
It was so unexpected Harry thought for a horrible moment that he was going mad. Three months, and the voice still managed to make him jerk with attention. Three months, but he was thrown backwards in time to a life he couldn’t even remember living it felt like so long ago, when he was still bothered by school bullies and sneering gits who thought they were better than anyone else. The last time he’d heard that voice sound anything other than scared or shaking or shouting was before the day Harry had sliced open its own in the bathroom.
Harry didn’t know how he was going to make it through the day.
“Of course not,” Tom murmured, so close now Harry could almost feel the sleek line of him against his own body.
His coat was shucked off in favor of his soot- and blood-covered white button down, the slash across his arm staining the fabric. The blood on his mouth was gone, and he seemed…fine. He didn’t look hurt, at least. Harry had no bloody idea
“Ginny,” he started to turn, wanting to do something to comfort her, to make this better, “I’m—I’m sorry. We can… I’ll—”
“Ms. Bulstrode managed to confess one thing,” Robards said gently. “She was working with Mr. Goyle, or they were somehow allied, however it seems the curse not only works on a physical level, but a mental one as well. She had a few lucid hours after being stabilized at St. Mungo’s, but it became clear quickly that her mind was deteriorating, fast. By the time I arrived to question her myself, she was confused, rambling. She couldn’t remember her own name, let alone what her motivations were or if anyone else was involved. The healers don’t expect her to regain any cognitive control or lucidity, due to the nature of the curse.”
“Gets his what?” Harry asked flatly.
It was mad, but Harry could almost feel relief as it drifted toward him. Eagerness. Fatigue. The desperation was still there, but its tone took on one of entreaty and hope, not fear. A sentience presence which had only been an unfocused influence—it now felt like…someone. Someone who had been trapped for a very, very long time. Longer than Harry could comprehend. He glimpsed some of it, the maddening, horrible tightness, the claustrophobic anger of absolute helplessness. The longing for something to change, to end, perhaps, if it was lucky.
Slowly, Andromeda helped him into her small bathroom. He sat on the toilet while she gently peeled off his clothes, methodically cleaning and then healing his remaining wounds. Harry sat in a detached kind of horror, unable to do more than move when she asked and hold back sounds of pain when some other injury made itself known. He couldn’t even remember how he’d gotten most of them. As the minutes dragged on he tried to think back to the fight, but there were gaps. He was propped against the tree and then he was on the ground. He was screaming as Goyle broke his hand and then he was exploding with fear.
Malfoy’s mouth twisted again but all he could manage was a grimace. He blinked a few times, as if he was trying to find the thread of his point. “Well, congratulations. I suppose having the most powerful wand in the world is preferable to—”
It took him a long time to calm down, left hand pressed to his forehead just in case it started pulsing. It reminded him of the moment after the splitting pain of a headache had faded, when you could feel the phantom sensation lingering behind your eyes and in your temples, braced for it to assault you again. He was so focused on his scar, in fact, that he almost missed the state of his right hand.
When the numbness started to fade, though, and he was left with the incomprehensible truth of
“What the hell were those kids playing at? How’d they even
Eyes burning, he nodded.
“Andromeda—,” Harry started.
Harry frowned. “Giving you your wand back?”
It had been months and he wasn’t feeling any better.
Ron was standing there, fists clenched at his sides, looking livid, like he was ready for a fight. Harry recognized this look well. He’d seen it more than a few times in his life, the last being in a cold tent right before Ron ditched him and Hermione.
Harry noticed at once that these were much better cared for. Their leather bindings were tight and clean, the small details of metal gleaming in the light from the gas lamp. The pages were crisp and flat, and each one seemed placed delicately, purposefully, one on top of the other, ascending in size from largest to smallest until a black notebook bound with a length of red velvet rested atop the rest.
What had Bill said? He felt like everyone was just watching as Harry lost his mind?
But no—the boy standing outside the lift wasn’t sneering, he wasn’t laughing. He was looking at Harry like it hurt. His eyes were wide and almost silver in the sunlight streaming in from one of the overhead windows. Brow furrowed, jaw clenched, leaning forward on the balls of his feet—he looked like he was about to reach out and stop the lift before it could descend.
Harry’s mind flared with anger. Yeah. Of course Dumbledore had said that. It wasn’t even a lie.
He spent an indeterminate amount of time wandering listless through Grimmauld Place. He fell asleep a few times, but he stopped counting right away. It didn’t matter. The house seemed quieter now, less ominous. Kreacher seemed to be watching him all the time, there with food whenever it looked like he might sit down long enough to let Kreacher approach. Harry ate because he didn’t want to worry Andromeda or Bill, who were still sending him daily, sometimes more than daily, messages checking up on him. He was worried at first they might come in person so he shut off the floo, but they never mentioned anything in their letters about trying to come in. They were waiting just like he’d asked.
Yeats leaned forward and said slowly, “You’ve spoken your peace, Mr. Potter, and now—”
“Do you know if this is some kind of illusion, Kreacher?” Harry rubbed the glass, but the fogged, grimy sheen didn’t budge. “Unless—those are trees, aren’t they?”
“Yeah.” Harry was caught off guard. “Thought I’d give the Magical Pest Advisory Board a spin. Maybe try my hand at wrangling feral brownies or redcaps.”
“You can stay here until I come back and you will.” Bill’s expression broke no leniency. “I mean it, Harry. You have no idea if this is an isolated incident or if this is something bigger, and I’m not going to let you wander off and get yourself hurt. Not again. You’re not leaving this house until I know you’re safe.” He took a deep breath, his voice softened. “I’m going to have to bring the Ministry in,” he added, slowly, watching Harry carefully. “I won’t—”
that’s how Umbridge had tried to explain Cedric’s death.
But Dumbledore hadn’t told him. Like he hadn’t told Harry about Godric’s Hollow, or Grindelwald, or his sister. The Hallows. He hadn’t told Harry anything. He had let Harry believe he was looking out for him, showing him how to save the people he loved, how to be better and succeed where all others had failed, protecting him, guiding him. Guiding him into the fucking grave.
“Like
Goyle had nearly killed him.
A swish of black robes drew Harry’s gaze and he closed his eyes shut when he recognized them.
The young woman lifted her hand, smiling sheepishly. “You wouldn’t happen to have honey, miss?”
“Until then, I’d ask you to lay low and keep quiet.” The last Robards emphasized with a frown. “I’ll be blunt, Mr. Potter. Your penchant for honesty and transparency can only hurt you right now, and I don’t think I need to tell you that there are more than a few people at the Ministry who don’t think very well of you after your performance at the trials yesterday. The fewer people who know you were the target of two attempted murders last night, the safer you’ll be, and the easier it will be to carry out our work.”
But his feet were rooted to the sandy grass as he strained to listen.
His voice echoed through the tall, rounded ceiling. He wouldn’t be surprised if people on the atrium had heard him. He pierced Kingsley with as much anger he could summon, enough grief and pain and disbelief, because he’d maneuvered Harry into this.
Malfoy’s eyes flicked to him. A little jolt went through Harry when they met his, but then Malfoy relaxed, a surprised twitch to his mouth. “Peeves used up all the pepper shakers dumping them in his trousers, didn’t he?”
Within a day of them getting back and settled into the Burrow, he noticed the shift. The flood of emotions he had felt at seeing her in the Room of the Requirement before the battle had gone. Touching her didn’t bring the same spark, the same gentle excitement of stealing happiness from the general shite of his life. Watching her from across the room as she laughed and smiled made him feel like he was staring into a sun which no longer felt warm but blinding and sharp. Like he had kept his eyes closed for so long he couldn’t bear to look at her anymore. When they kissed, he felt nothing, just a weird sense of disconnect. It felt more like when Cho had kissed him through her tears—when he had been confused and more than a bit petrified. Nice, he supposed, but not the kind of nice kissing Ginny used to be. Not the kind of nice he lost himself in. Just…nice. The kind of nice where Harry was so focused on the mechanics of where his hands were and how much spit he was producing and wondering how the fuck he had enjoyed this before if it was so bloody weird now.
“Not entirely. I got interviewed by Robards and two—”
His hands lingered in the air, the emptiness in them so, so much worse than it had been only a few moments ago. The numbness filtered slowly back into him, soothing his ragged edges and dulling the pain of whatever, whoever, had just cut into his dream and took something out of him. A sharp, silver thief and a soft, broken voice.
“You could give them someone else’s, you know,” Tom went on, leaning in, his words languid and gentle, velvet over Harry’s gooseflesh-pricked skin. “You don’t have to open yourself up all the time, spill your blood to save the world. It doesn’t have to be yours. It never has to be.”
Eyes dry and chest tight, Harry shook his head. “No. Bill’s and Andromeda’s, you can keep, but the rest…”
the anxiety crept back in like pins and needles in an arm he had accidentally slept on.
A voice like the ocean crashing, like mountains shifting, like a deep, mournful howl, whispered,
Harry’s brow lifted and he made a show of looking down at his watch. “It’s ten to. Pretty sure he can walk on his own to the lift. Won’t take him more than a minute. Think you might be a bit too keen on punctuality, mate.”
The memory of fiendfyre ripped through him and it was all he could do to grit his teeth and try not to see Malfoy’s pale, terrified face as he reached down—
He held her gaze for a while, something cringing in the back of his mind.
The other book was heavier, the wood strips of dark gold alternating with cool brown in neat, regimented sections. The lines were precise, firm, and this writing had been burned, or soldered into the wood with an impressively clean stroke. As Harry left his hand on this one, he felt again that warmth emanating from it, but now that he was focusing, he could also feel…solidity. A hardness to the warmth that felt steadier than the breathy fresh scent of the greenwood book. A kind of security and ownership.
felt that way.
Yeats went very still and slowly shifted her gaze down to him. “Mr. Potter,” she said in clipped tones, “I will remind you that these proceedings are a matter of law and of the utmost importance, and not subject to mockery or trivialization.”
It all seemed so…unnecessary. People didn’t just want him dead for no reason. Just for fun. They never had before, why would he start thinking so now?
A few days before his birthday—after repeating for the umpteenth time to Molly through Shell Cottage’s floo that he didn’t want a party, that he appreciated the gesture, but he just wanted something quiet, a drink in a pub with a few friends and nothing more, she’d finally let it go, to Harry’s immense relief—he was surprised by the extra voice he heard in the kitchen when he came in from his dusk stroll. That in and of itself wouldn’t be a cause for alarm—Bill and Fleur had people over every now and again.
“I’m—
The cottage door opened, and the sound of more than one set of feet came into the house, creaked on the small staircase up to the sitting room. Voices followed, low and deep. A gentle knock on the bedroom door.
“He wasn’t. They have ankle cuffs spelled so that if they don’t check in on time, they’re cursed.” He shook his head again, trying to control his voice. “They made a registry, again. Except this time it’s not muggleborns, it’s teenagers from Slytherin, coming in to make sure their parents behave. They’re being used as leverage.”
Another shroud of silence settled over them. Harry stared down at his pulsing right hand, the yellow and green light of Andromeda’s magic coating it with a slight shimmer—like a glove of liquid citrine.
“What?”
“Others?”
“Harry,” Robards said gently, “I’m going to be honest with you.”
“Are you all right, Harry?”
Neville and Hermione stood over the writhing corpse of Nagini, Hermione clutching the Sorting Hat to her chest and Neville with two hands clasped over the hilt of the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, both of them wearing similarly stunned expressions.
Calmly, a spectral line of magic shot out from his wand and formed a large stag, its antlers smoking before it shot off into the air. A body emerged from the tip of Harry’s wand, gliding up and over an invisible plane. That would be
Feel free to come bug me on
His stomach did a feeble twist at that.
Malfoy’s expression shifted, becoming almost curious. His eyes flicked down, and Harry had the uncanny feeling that he was looking toward his left hand, the one marked by Umbridge. Harry almost threw it back at him, how Malfoy had been part of her Inquisitorial Squad and at the time had had a good laugh with his mates about it.
“They killed a fourteen-year-old girl, Ron! They
Bill swept his wand over his head, a Notice-Me-Not Charm settling around them. Goyle’s body didn’t disappear, but it wasn’t so obvious now. It might have just been a strange shadow, a log.
“Why would I joke about something like this?” Harry asked, angry. “This is serious, there’s—” He swallowed his reasoning, knowing he couldn’t tell Malfoy about the kids in Azkaban. The girl who was killed. If Malfoy was cooperating, he wouldn’t any more if he heard what the Ministry was willing to do.
“Why not?” Robards asked, still frowning.
A hum built in the back of his mind—the silent resonance of a bagpipe held on a single note, the vibration of bees over a flower garden, the static absence of sound before the first strike of lightning in a storm. It hung there, weightless, as he willed it into life, different from and wilder than the magic he’d worked on the plant. He was calling to something here, in the foundations of this home, rousing it from sleep. Intention pulled at him, instinctive and raw as he tried to layer in his own desire, his need for help from the house he’d only just started to think of as a home.
The door flashed with white light along the edges as it sealed shut.
“That’s unfortunate,” Harry said, slipping his left hand into the pocket of his robes to hide his nails digging into the meat of his palm. “You see, I think I’ve got a bit more to say that the court would appreciate hearing.”
than revenge.”
As if the thought was what tipped them off, someone shouted his name, and they were on him.
Quickly, like he couldn’t help it, Malfoy’s gaze flicked up to Harry, and held.
“I thought cornflowers were—flowers.”
“He’s not wrong, Harry,” Hermione murmured, looking just as incredulous as Ron. “He deserves to be watched. You of all people should know that.”
“Everything okay?” Bill asked, taking the seat next to Harry and sliding in.
Harry turned, picking up Teddy to deposit him on the couch before he could get himself stuck under it. “I’ll be right back,” he added to Andromeda when it looked like she might object. He threw a glance to Bill too. “Were you…?”
Ron shouted after he’d taken a deep breath. “What the bloody
He choked off his voice, opened his eyes and there she was, gaze harder than he’d ever seen, her fine features shadowed as she leaned over him. As he blinked, her face bled into her sister Narcissa’s, the edges going blurry as his vision swam again. She was supposed to ask him if her son was alive. Had Harry killed him too? Was Draco— No, Andromeda had a daughter and—Tonks was dead. They were all—
Their gazes met and she started, looking down at once as her face went bone white.
“Master is saving my dear Mistress’s plant,” he said, wobbly and rough.
He looked from Robards to Kamau, who was also taking notes, though she was looking down. Proulx was still scowling at Harry but there was a glint of interest now in his eyes which put Harry off. “I do. A lot of it was—personal, but… Professor Dumbledore was talking Draco down. He was—” He didn’t know why this was harder to say now than any other time, but for some reason he couldn’t get Malfoy’s pale face and crumpled expression out of his head. “He offered Draco clemency, him and his parents. The Order of the Phoenix would have taken them in and protected them. If Draco surrendered.”
Maybe he couldn’t forget how Malfoy looked as he stared into Harry’s disfigured face in the shadows of his own home, fear and something like defiance flashing in his dark grey eyes. Maybe he couldn’t forget that same determination when Malfoy stood inches from Voldemort and decided to fight back.
With as much calm as he could muster, keeping his eyes on her and not looking at Hermione or Bill or Kingsley, not even Malfoy, he said slowly, “I’m done now.”
Someone ran into Harry and shoved him to the side. Molly Weasley nearly bowled over him as she lifted her wand, opened her mouth—
“We didn’t go through the same war,” he continued, carving his words into daggers. “You didn’t go through what I went through. You haven’t dealt with what I’ve dealt with. You have no
“It’s strange, actually,” she continued over his moment of panic, “because the kettlefoxes usually don’t chance coming out when it’s so near the new moon. Don’t like to be caught out when the Wild Hunt gets going. They’re generally much more careful, but it’s been such a queer summer. Would you believe I counted fifteen hinkypunks in July alone? Normally I’d be lucky to see one all year! I didn’t even have to go out to the river. They just floated up the hill, bold as you please.”
“I did!”
“Harry’s about to unload all his problems unto us. Serious topics require serious beverages.” He nodded at Harry. “You want another? Shot of firewhisky?”
“It’s sitting on the table, Harry.” Andromeda walked over to him, kneeling down just like Bill had. Hesitantly, she reached out and took Harry’s left hand, heedless of the blood flaking over his skin.
The voice was low and slick and it wrapped around his chest, coiling tighter and tighter like the embrace of a lover. He was held tight. He couldn’t move. He didn’t want to.
Chapter 1 Songs:
When a voice called across the atrium, the moment broke and Malfoy turned, only to scowl. “Lovely,” he muttered.
Harry frowned and looked sharply at Bill, feeling a bit off balance. “Malfoy?”
He shouldn’t be able to feel this. How many times had Dumbledore told him he was good and pure and fucking
“You’ve got quite a reputation back in the States,” she continued, mouth twitching. “I’m looking forward to getting to know the real you.”
Because he’d become something to fear.
“I heard,” Hermione said. “It makes sense. The International Confederation of Wizards usually offers aid to countries after a war.”
Harry shoved his hand through his hair. “Look, is there something you want me to sign or—”
“Yes, Draco,” Voldemort said with a smile in his voice, dripping with satisfaction and the promise of violence. “Your parents have been worried! How they plead for your life even after you left them behind. There’s no need to pretend anymore. Come and greet me as your victorious lord.” Harry almost scowled at the saccharine tone, the utter control and relish in every word. Voldemort really thought it was over. He thought he had won.
“Look, Mr. Potter, I don’t think you understand—”
The sky was vast and though it was bright and clear, there were stars above him. He picked them all out, the tiny diamond beads that spun images and meaning that left his head as soon as they formed. There was a cluster of them, making a shape that Harry couldn’t name…
“Hey,” he said softly, putting his hand out to the wall, “thanks.”
Predictably, he only slept a few scant minutes the night before he was summoned, leaving him feeling like a poorly buttered piece of toast.
- "Mailman" by Soundgarden
“I checked it for curses already,” Harry said quickly. “And I cleaned it, so it’s fine.”
anyway.
Kingsley grunted. “No. And I can’t say I disagree, Bill. Going back to the place where you watched your friends die seems like too much to ask.”
“Yeah, sorry.” Harry tried to smile over the tight pain memories of Remus still caused him. “Zoned out for a second.”
“Doesn’t matter. I’ve seen you fly. You’re brilliant.” Charlie waved a hand at Bill. “Plus, I’ve heard about how good you are for seven bleeding years from
“Right.” He hadn’t even known there was a second dining room. “Of course. You don’t happen to remember what the plant needs, do you? Like…light or water or…”
Her eyes widened, something hard flashing in them. “The Dark Lord asked a sixteen-year-old boy to kill one of the most powerful wizards in this country?”
Harry swallowed his unease and closed his eyes, breathing deep until he didn’t feel like his chest was on fire.
“Morning, Hermione,” he said blandly, catching the rolled up magazine as she tried to smack him with it. He held on as she tried to pull it back, which only made her angrier. “I didn’t know you still read the Quibbler.”
He could see it now in the old man’s face, in the disbelief and frustration, the hurt pride. He didn’t think Robards was a bad person. He seemed decent, compassionate, competent. In a kinder world, Harry would be more than willing to set aside his own misgivings to give Robards a chance. But Harry didn’t know him. He was just another old man who was trying to place Harry on his board. Harry was just another piece in his game, even if he didn’t mean him to be. Even if he didn’t know that’s what he was doing.
Without knowing how the Fidelius Charm had been cast in the first place, along with all the other charms and wards the Black family had layered over the years, he didn’t trust himself to just cast a new charm on the house, mostly because he had no bloody chance of trying any version of the charm developed in the last century. He remembered Flitwick saying it was a tricky bit of magic, and if Flitwick didn’t know what he was talking about then Harry didn’t have a shot in hell anyway. If he could just…get rid of the fragments of magic that no longer worked or gave the house its demeanor of faintly-simmering malice, it might be easier. It might start to feel like something resembling a home.
“What’s
He still looked like he was searching for something. The sneer didn’t reach his eyes, and his posture didn’t look confident, it looked defensive. There was a challenge in Malfoy’s eyes, but it wasn’t cruel.
Harry groaned.
This time, when Harry met his shining black eyes, Tom Riddle smiled in full.
His fear and horror and resignation felt so far away now. All leeched from him sometime between the green light of the Killing Curse and the darkness of his own eyelids, all tucked away and hidden. Forgotten. He almost wished he was still scared. At least he would know how to deal with fear. This—hollow
If he was being honest, though, Harry didn’t think he’d have appreciated any of this while he was still in school. There was a necessary level of consideration and introspection, specific to whoever was doing the casting, that he would have found too nebulous and boring to understand. It would have been too big to wrap his mind around. Whatever understanding the greenwood book had given him, he wasn’t so intimidated anymore. A door had been opened in his mind, showing him a whole new room of space to fill.
Harry dropped his gaze, not really knowing how he felt about Kingsley’s being here and too keyed up to care. “Sure. That’s fine.”
Harry stared in alarm. He could not think of one other time Malfoy had ever laughed at something Harry’d said. He’d laughed
He ran through everything Goyle had said, and paused. “He seemed—er, I don’t know if it was just me caught off guard, but he was stronger than he should have been. He looked half-starved, but I couldn’t shake him off. He was able to do this,” he lifted his right hand, “just by hitting my hand on the ground.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“There, see?” Andromeda said, giving Harry a small smile before hitching Teddy up on her hip. “Told you he’d be back.”
Hermione wasn’t going to slash open his chest, though. No, that had been Harry. He’d done that.
Ron.”
His grey eyes hardened and he sat up. The indistinct dissociation vanished from his features as he adopted a cold, impassive stare—a mirror to his mother’s.
Something slithered up and around his neck. It was long and rough—different from the hands roving over his chest. His mouth fell open, gasping for air, moaning—something slid past his lips and his eyes rolled back into his head. It was in his throat, thick and cold, choking. He couldn’t think now. He couldn’t breathe and he didn’t want to, he wanted this, he wanted to sink down so deep nothing and no one could ever find him again. He wanted it to end. Oh, god, did he want
him. Harry felt his defenses rise. He knew that look. It was the same look Snape had worn for six years. Disdain mixed with boredom. Though, he wondered now how much of the latter had been real boredom and not just practiced apathy, with how much he hated Harry’s dad, and Harry, by extension.
Harry frowned. “No, Bill, I’m not going to run off and tell the Pr—”
“What’s there to understand?”
The word blew through on the wind with an ash-filled voice colored in the fire-bright leaves around him. His hands searched blindly over the ground for his wand. The thing coiling around his leg moved up, tracing his calf almost softly. Another joined it soon over his other ankle and they were circling up his thighs, between his legs, around his waist. His eyes threatened to close despite the panic beating a tattoo inside his chest. Fatigue curled up his spine and from his lips broke a gasp of mist, the first bite of frost chilling the air.
He had his hood up, his shoulders slouched, and as he walked past he threw a glance over his shoulder, like he was checking to see that no one was following him. The headline was something about him disappearing from Wizarding Society after the war, dated over a month ago, before the start of the trials. Beneath the first page they were more, clippings of him or stories about him, speculating on where he was, what he was doing, who he was seeing, what his plans were, if he was hiding something, et cetera.
“That’s rather extraordinary.” Kamau smiled up at Teddy in Bill’s arms, who was currently shifting through hair colors. “What a charmer.”
Harry held his gaze. Some part of him completely agreed with Ron. This was nowhere near the kind of trauma inflicted on the country while Voldemort was in power. Most of these kids benefited from a pureblood-first ideology. And he was also pretty sure most of them had been perfectly happy to let a few muggleborn and halfblood witches and wizards get tortured, because it wasn’t their problem. They were safe, and so were their families. A lot of them probably didn’t even think about fighting back or standing up for the other.
He testified for three people that day—Goyle, who was still absent and wanted for the suspected murder of four muggles in the last three months, Pansy, and Malfoy. He’d already testified for Lucius and Narcissa, for Rookwood, Dolohov, Avery, Rowle, Travers, and Nott Sr. on previous days, but he didn’t know what their sentences were. He hadn’t asked. He didn’t want to know. Though he’d already been questioned and testified once for his fellow Hogwarts students, the Wizengamot had asked him to come in again, for further clarification on these three. Presumably because they were the ones Yeats wanted to make an example of.
The slit-like nostrils flared, the last, violent green light burned and pulsed around Voldemort’s wand—fear contracted the irises of his red eyes.
with you?”
Harry should have expected what was coming next, but it still surprised him when he saw himself walking through the frame of a large photo on the front page of the Daily Prophet.
Harry didn’t meet her gaze, not wanting to lie to her but not wanting to have this conversation right now. The day of questioning had been bad enough, he didn’t need to deal with this too. “Maybe,” he allowed, summoning a tight smile. “But…listen can you not mention it to Ron for a while? At least until after the trials are over. I feel like everything’s a bit mad right now, and I’ll feel a hell of a lot better when I can breathe again, you know?”
“You stole a dragon from Gringotts, and the whole bleeding country is somehow
“It’s okay,” Harry said, trying to smile. “I just need to clear my head.”
A chill settled into the pit of Harry’s stomach. “Believe whatever you want, Ron.”
The room he walked into was small and well-lit. He had been picturing one of the large courtrooms where he had sat under the watchful eyes of fifty witches and wizards in plum robes—the whole Wizengamot in all their glory. This wasn’t cozy but it didn’t seem designed to intimidate him.
It was a surprising enough occurrence that Harry arched his brow over his cup when Bill didn’t elaborate. Maybe Harry should have realized it was stupid to even ask but his quiet summer had lulled him into a false sense of security, made him forget about the rest of Britain and the war he had only recently fought in.
“And you don’t know how?”
Kingsley waited, his jaw clenching before he said slowly, “Yeats wants to send them to Azkaban. I’ve been negotiating her down.”
How many more of them would be people he’d known, people he’d gone to school with?
But he supposed that was true for all of them.
His steadiness faded, leaving behind only the raw place where his anger sat these days. “It’s not fine. Not to me,” he said quietly. “I’m not okay with this, Hermione.”
Charlie wiped the back of his hand over his mouth, giving Harry a wide smile. “This is why I stick to dragons. No politics or drama. Just fire and claws. Much simpler. Primal, even.”
The blood. Fuck, there was so much blood.
He didn’t know why it took him this long to make the connection.
“Don’t you look snappy,” Bill said with a grin. “Dunno if I’ve ever seen you in a full piece before.”
Bill squeezed his shoulder and murmured, “Seven by the fountain, all right?”
Harry’s voice came out cold and flat. “Maybe I’ve got a charmed ring on. Want to check for that too?” He lifted his hands up and offered them to her. They weren’t shaking. “Or maybe a necklace? It’ll take me a second to get my tie off, so you might have to stop throwing countercharms at me while I do it.”
“I’m assuming that listening to the complaints of a former death eater isn’t high on their list of priorities.” Malfoy studied him, eyes flicking down over the length of his body and back up, still frowning. This was almost worse than the staring. “Why do you care?”
did it have to be Malfoy who’d told him in the first place and forced him to face what he’d already known in his heart? Anyone else would have been better than him, and the worst part was Harry didn’t even regret what he’d said in Mafloy’s favor. It would have been easier if he did, but Draco Malfoy wasn’t the problem here. Not anymore.
He was gone. He was fucking
Kreacher nodded, his grim face breaking into something that might have been a smile. “Master Harry was wanting to finish what Master Regulus began when he defied the Dark Lord. Kreacher has been wanting to show this to Master for months, but Master has not been here…”
“I already knew,” Bill said, grinning. “But you might want to keep it quiet. Him and his parents were already on thin ice before Voldemort kicked it. Can’t imagine they’ve got a lot of friends these days on that side. Never seen anyone else at the house, anyway. Just Draco.”
that voice.
“You don’t have to help, Harry,” Fleur said gently, tilting her head with a soft smile. “I like the company but I don’t need—”
“Draco,” Narcissa repeated, her resonant voice going slightly brittle, “
He splashed cold water on his face and rubbed his face with trembling hands. When he put his glasses back on, he looked a mess—hair wild again and robes rumpled and a pink ring around his eyes that made him look insane and unhinged—but he had to get out. If he stayed in here with Hermione much longer, he wouldn’t be able to go out and face the rest of the world.
“No, I mean…” He trailed off at Kreacher’s small, somewhat malicious smile. If he didn’t know better, he might have said Kreacher was teasing him. “Right. No. As long as its edible and tastes all right, I’m not picky.” He paused, considering. “You don’t know how to make pumpkin pasties, do you?”
Harry hesitated. It was one thing to explain to people who understood his dynamic with Malfoy that he had assumed right away he was doing something wrong and then obsessively watched him the rest of the year, another to tell that to professional law enforcement officers. He had a feeling Robards might not buy the
Besides, he had a feeling they wouldn’t be too keen on him either once the story broke.
“Sorry,” Ron said loudly, “we’re not taking Malfoy’s word seriously, right? And even if it was true,” he shrugged, “serves him right.”
but it was close enough to make him question his own sanity.
Harry shouted, furious enough to make Ron flinch again. “It doesn’t bloody
In the brief span of time it took for Harry to shake himself out of the flashback, he caught only a few details of Goyle—long, lank hair, sunken skin, and a horrible burn mark all down the side of his face.
The hawthorn wand responded to his magic. Wordless, instinctive—a defiant, feral shout into the dark, Harry met Voldemort’s curse with his own, ready, at last.
A symbol flashed before his eyes—an inverse of the symbol on the other wooden book sitting safely upstairs. It rang with a gong’s strength and cracked something inside of Harry, broke out of his chest in a violent cry. He didn’t even have time to be alarmed, though, before the symbol morphed, shifted into the other, familiar one. It was steady and solid and for a moment he felt the jagged edges where whatever magic had punched out of himself lingered, splintered and raw. But the feeling vanished and the cracks resealed, tightened, bound themselves in metal and blood. The seventh barrier fell softly into place.
Dumbledore had armed him with love and the crafted certainty of a pure, unbroken soul and sent him off to do the one thing which would damn him forever. To rip his own purity apart.
Hermione’s head whipped toward him, but he didn’t acknowledge her.
stop it, if he wanted, and that it might be unpleasant but not deadly. He didn’t feel like he was losing anything, anyway. More like he was exchanging—a tiny bit of blood for whatever was hidden on the sheet.
to survive and now he was just letting the forest take him again.
Fawkes.
He had risked his life to give Harry the chance to fight. And if he really was cooperating with the Ministry…
Malfoy blinked, expression frozen somewhere between anger and disbelief. His mouth hung open, and Harry found it unsettling, again, how quickly it changed Malfoy’s appearance.
Harry had had enough of trusting old men who claimed to have his best intentions at heart.
A man approached them, furiously gesturing at Malfoy. He wore, Harry saw with a frown, the uniform of an auror even if he looked no older than Harry or Malfoy. “The hell you doing just loitering down—” The man’s eyes widened as they fell on Harry. Malfoy made a small, disgusted noise beside him.
When he opened his eyes, the dream was gone, but he couldn’t catch his breath. He could remember nothing, only the rabbit-quick beating of his heart and the curl of—
Harry stood in the center of the parlor which now seemed dark compared to the brilliance of only a moment before. He was breathing hard. His mind felt a bit like someone had reached in and scrambled all his thoughts around—but then it settled. And there it was—the secret sitting there in the back of his mind. Innocuous. Quiet. For some odd reason it reminded him of the winged key he’d needed to catch in first year to get to Quirrell.
Harry shouted as he came, as he shuddered, more violently than he’d ever before. It was like the orgasm punched out of him, and he didn’t even know if it was pleasant anymore, just—shocking in its intensity.
Harry patted him on the arm because it seemed like the right thing to do. He looked to Bill for help.
He felt his disbelief, his anger, bleed into horror. His eyes burned as they stood in silence. His resolve crumpled and he took a step back, unable to stand near her.
The sky nearly black, but with traces of purple and pink. Trees set alight with fire.
That hot fist formed in Harry’s chest again, a tangled thing he wanted gone. “Right. So he just went back to his house, after Hogwarts?”
—only to realize he’d never known Sirius’s middle name.
he thought, unhelpfully.
“Yeah, I know.”
Kamau blinked, looking into the kitchen with a frown. “His mother?”
He actually smiled at this. Like he wouldn’t know who Draco fucking Malfoy was. “I went to school with him. Reckon I know better than you who he is.”
Voldemort lay on the ground. Splayed out like Dumbledore. His eyes white now, instead of red, and staring up at the approaching light of dawn.
“It does, actually,” Kamau interrupted calmly. “Motive always matters.”
The fighting had grown weak around the edges of the courtyard, a large open circle surrounding Voldemort where he dueled McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn, and Bellatrix as she gained on Draco. Because it was clear where that fight was going. He had managed to surprise her but Bellatrix was the superior witch and Draco was swaying and stumbling on his feet the longer he battled her. He nearly went down from a jinx that caught his foot, acid burning through the cuff of his trousers. Bled through to bare pale skin.
“Will he—”
“Kreacher is… Kreacher is fine, Master Harry. Kreacher is merely—he is getting lost in his thoughts.” Kreacher shook himself, eyes unfocused and wide, staring at something Harry couldn’t see. “Kreacher… Kreacher is getting dizzy. He is needing rest. Yes. Rest.”
The stable dropped away in a dizzying rush of darkness. He was nowhere, caught in that unreal space of unconsciousness and dreaming, standing in a vast black space as endless as the sky. He wasn’t alone.
A private consultant.
Harry had tried to die to save them all. He had done it out of love but now that he had time to think, to breathe, it sunk in… He had walked toward his death without a fight. He had given up his life to give them a chance.
“And I fancy trying out for the Holyhead Harpies,” she said with a laugh. “I really think I’ve got a shot this year.”
Grey eyes.
he countered, only just able to shield himself before the curse caught him. Tendrils of red and black flickered over his skin, seeking an entrance, but he brushed them aside.
The whole time, he felt his wand pressed to his side. Memories of this room seeped into him, the deathly chill still held within the sleek tiled walls and austere benches. His godfather had died just through that door to the Department of Mysteries. He’d stood here in this room and been called a liar by the Minister for Magic.
“I must say, Mr. Potter, your reputation for kindness seems vastly overblown.”
Felicity looked to Robards, who nodded. “Her name is Millicent Bulstrode,” she said grimly, “and I think, Mr. Potter, that you know where this is going.”
“There was nothing to say,” Harry muttered.
Now, though, with the trials coming up in a few weeks and Harry’s momentary respite ending, Harry didn’t want to be kept in the dark anymore. Not where the Ministry was concerned.
The hawthorn wand vibrated in Harry’s grip as he pulled off the invisibility cloak. His Shield Charm held for Voldemort’s second attack, a lance of screaming orange fire directed straight at Draco’s heart. Harry felt the heat from almost fifty feet away. Draco lunged back and nearly fell to the ground. Eyes wild and shining with tears, he searched the crowd.
He shook his head and put his glasses back on, making sure he wasn’t going crazy, but it was still there, clear as the rest of the room. He rubbed his fingers together and a fine shower of dust or dirt drifted back down to the table. It stayed clear of the clean patch, though, almost as if it were protected by an invisible dome.
Seven hours later, Harry was seated on the edge of the fountain in the atrium, seriously considering just throwing himself and drowning.
“Okay,” he murmured, the sound of his voice creating an echo inside his mind, “so they just decided one day to… I just…I still don’t know
He blinked, realizing that Bill was saying his name. “Sorry, what?”
It should worry him, right? That he couldn’t even picture himself doing something so mundane as watching a quidditch game anymore? That the very idea felt like it couldn’t, shouldn’t, belong to him?
And he knew with a distant guilt that he was the one who’d changed, not any of the Weasleys, not the people who had welcomed him as family the moment he entered their home. It was his fault. Or maybe it was the little shard of Voldemort, knowing it was there inside his head and had always been there.
Over the next few hours as everyone rested and waited for the relief to come in from outside, he sat with the Weasleys. Not next to Ginny, sandwiched between Molly and George. He hadn’t been able to get her alone—he hadn’t tried, really—but he caught her watching him now and again.
They stood now in a small alcove tucked off from what Harry had begun to think of as the main thoroughfare. A rather questionable looking desk sat nudged into a wall of books, accompanied by a gas lamp, a quill, and an ink well.
“French bloke named Proulx. Acted like he had a broomstick up his ass the whole day. And a woman from America, Kamau. She was decent, actually.”
Harry couldn’t help but feel a small twinge of pity. She looked so young, so thin, sitting there in her fine robes with her black hair dull and a bit mussed. He tried to imagine the same girl shouting for his capture only three months ago, and he couldn’t. All he could remember was her panicked voice, breaking, too high.
“None of that,” Andromeda chided him gently, her gaze knowing as she lifted Teddy and handed him over to Harry. “You’re here now. No need to punish yourself.”
“Yes, the one you wear when you don’t want to talk about something.”
Their ghosts had been here too, but after the ritual, the air smelled new and clean, and the shadows were just shadows, not places where dark things and thoughts lurked.
Bellatrix lunged forward and screamed as she sent curse after curse toward Malfoy. “You
He had to tell someone. He couldn’t just—leave him here.
“Bollocks,” he muttered. “Er, sorry. I didn’t—”
Harry reflexively clenched his left hand. His shock quickly transformed into something else, but he felt paralyzed. It took him a moment to find his voice, and when he did it was flat. “You have to come in every day?”
“You didn’t have to.” Malfoy sighed. “I expected worse, honestly.”
“Did they make you reenact stuff or something?” Ron asked, downing his drink. His cheeks were already flushed and there was a glazed look to his gaze. He must have had another when Harry wasn’t paying attention. He’d cut his hair in the week or so since he’d kicked Harry out of his flat and he wore rather nice slacks under his summer robes. Harry felt a little stab of affection when he thought of Ron going shopping for new clothes.
“Don’t be too hard on yourself.” Bill smiled gently. “You’re not the first eighteen-year-old wizard to have no fucking clue what he wants to do with his life. You’ve got time to figure it out, Harry.”
But the hallway was empty. Actually, it was
Harry wasn’t quick enough to hide his flinch. He tried to rally, but hearing her name spoken out loud, by Malfoy, was like a shock to his chest.
“I’m sure one of the Weasleys told you we would be bringing in outside help to make sure there’s no bias going into these trials,” Robards said as he sat down. “Today is just a preliminary questioning. If I or my two colleagues decide the Wizengamot needs to hear your official testimony, we’ll ask you to stand in front of the full council.”
Ron’s face tightened. As he moved off, Harry thought he saw Ron muttering something under his breath.
He controlled himself quickly, drawing up and facing Harry like he had always expected him to arrive. Like it was all falling into place exactly as he had intended it to.
He’d never sat down and had a serious conversation with himself about…this, and honestly, he’d had very little time to think about romance in his life, sixth year withstanding. Bit hard to worry about who you wanted to snog when you suffered from the frequent misfortune of nearly dying once or twice a year. And even in sixth, when did have space and time and energy to devote to losing his mind over someone he wanted to kiss, he’d thought about
Andromeda laughed, a full-bodied sound that made him wonder, sometimes, how in the world she’d grown up with Bellatrix and Narcissa. She seemed so much warmer. Even if there was a certain haughtiness to her person, it didn’t feel superior. She might look exactly like Bellatrix but she couldn’t be more different.
Kreacher looked at Harry’s hand, and then back at his face. His eyes narrowed, still a bit shiny. “Master is not spending much time here in the noble House of Black since he inherited. Kreacher is thinking Master doesn’t like the house. Like Master Sirius.”
Every time he tried to remember, it slipped a little further away from him. But he had to remember, all of it, because he knew he’d have to repeat all of this when an auror finally came to take him away. If he’d had the capacity to laugh, he would have at the irony. He’d screamed at the Wizengamot and called them all cowards and now here he was, a murderer twice over…
Harry looked up to Kreacher, seeing a hesitant kind of longing in his eyes. “Thank you, Kreacher. For—trusting me.”
Malfoy also seemed to have noted the strangeness of his reaction, because he pointedly looked over Harry’s shoulder instead of holding his gaze. “I’m surprised they didn’t call you in sooner to stab an Order of Merlin into your chest. They must want to get the Golden Boy’s stamp of approval on all the poor sods they couldn’t manage to pin something else on.” His mouth tightened. “But I suppose they already know who’s bound for Azkaban and who gets to work out their sins the old fashioned way through money and disgrace. The rest is a show to make it look like they’re doing something useful, isn’t it?”
“I mean that I’d still be inclined to keep these attacks quiet.”

of disapproval. The person beside him leaned up and whispered into his ear, “Between you and I, I admit I enjoy getting to finish them off myself.”
think she deserves—”
Hermione and Ron would come running. He should have counted it as a blessing, a comfort, to know he had friends who would always be there for him. They’d come through a war together, hadn’t they? He shouldn’t be afraid of telling them anything, asking for their help, again, when they’d already done so much for him.
Kingsley’s large shadow passed over the window, nearly close enough to see Harry eavesdropping on this conversation. Harry pressed his back against the cottage, reminding himself of the summer he had been forced to hide in the bushes to listen to the news through the Dursleys’ open living room window. From his angle he could see Kingsley’s face. He looked tired. The beginnings of grey were showing at his temples. He stared through the window, his gaze hard. He seemed to scan the area, settling on a patch of grass close to where Harry had just been standing.
Alarmed, he looked down. He nearly missed a small flicker of red light near that same groove. A line of red, faint enough he wouldn’t have noticed had he not been looking, ran quickly along the groove, shot off one small spark.
She flinched at the last, and it was like the ice around him cracked.
Kreacher looked healthier as well, his skin a bit more pink than grey and not as sagging as it had once been. Apparently, he’d improved along with the house. As he ate, trying to ignore Kreacher’s fierce and silent attention, Harry wondered if the house was as sentient as other wizarding homes. The Burrow should have fallen apart years ago, but you could feel the spirit of the house the moment you walked in, the warmth and comfort, like it was more than happy to hold itself together for its family. It was the only example of a wizarding home he had any extended experience with. He’d only been to two others—Luna’s and Malfoy’s, so he wasn’t exactly sure, and it’s not like he’d been to either place long enough to sit and take full stock of the general atmosphere of the house.
soft.
Tentatively, he flexed his hand. It didn’t hurt anymore, thank Merlin, but it felt—odd. Not as odd as his arm had felt the week after he’d had to regrow all the bones inside it, but not normal. He ran his thumbnail along the lines, taking it in with a kind of resignation which should probably worry him. He had the almost comforting thought that it looked more like a tree than the lightning bolt on his forehead and the blast on his chest.
Bill sat down next to him, staring forward. Harry could practically hear him swallowing everything he wanted to say about Harry’s choice to leave. The fact that he cared that much made something inside Harry shrivel up in shame.
Or maybe he just hated the Ministry that much.
“Yes, me.” Bill’s face cracked with a small smile. “So go on and start shouting if you like, but I’m not changing my mind.” The hand he still had on Harry’s shoulder squeezed. “There is no legal basis for your being arrested or detained. Even if anyone wanted to arrest you, they couldn’t.”
Harry still wasn’t sure he could reply without losing it entirely, so he just gave her a grateful smile. Teddy began reaching up for Harry’s hair, babbling incoherently as he took great chunks and tugged. He did manage a bit of a hug while doing it though, so Harry didn’t mind. He felt more fragile than the last time Harry’d held him, or maybe it was Harry who was shaky and nervous. Teddy was all chubby arms and a weirdly soft, simple smell and Harry was grateful and guilty for the relief he felt knowing the boy still liked him.
“You all right?” Harry asked.
He still didn’t know what to think about it.
Malfoy straightened up. The knot in his throat bobbed as he swallowed. He was taller than Voldemort but he still managed to look properly subservient. He bowed his head. He held Harry’s gaze as he murmured, “I have failed you, my lord.”
Just like Harry.
From the haze of soft white, a figure appeared.
The room felt heavy and full in the pause, like Dumbledore’s memory of the Wizengamot Harry had watched in fourth year. Everyone waiting to hear the answer they were hoping for.
Kreacher stared at him, milky eyes going wide and, to Harry’s horror, wet. “Oh-oh, is Master Harry finding fault with Kreacher’s tidying up?”
The words were written in the same language as the rest of the book, only this time, they looked more like letters, letters Harry could recognize.
Bill didn’t answer over the sound of cups touching wood, the soft scrape of a chair.
Before Harry could blink, Kreacher grabbed the hand still pressed awkwardly to his shoulder and disapparated. The sensation of being squeezed through a very small hole was oddly not as nauseating as normal. Maybe it was something to do with house-elf magic.
So piss off.”
Voldemort was dead, and his scar wasn’t hurting. And there was still something pulsing in his chest, like heartburn or anxiety, but alive, rippling like dark water disturbed by a boat. By corpses.
“And Yeats?” he asked, voice hard.
He considered going up to the headmaster’s office as well, looking into those wonderful, horrible blue eyes and seeking an answer as to why Dumbledore hadn’t told him. Why he thought Harry wouldn’t have agreed, if he’d known beforehand. Because he would have. Of course he would have. To save his friends, his family, the whole bleeding Wizarding World? He would have thrown himself on any sword to save them all. Gladly, and without thought. He still would.
Also, to make matters worse, apparently the twins, before Fred’s death, had secretly brought him on as the principle investor of the shop, opened a vault for him connected to his parents’ and he was now making a very small percentage of their earnings. Even so, the shop was so successful and his holdings at Gringotts had swelled so quickly over the year or so since the twins had roped him in, they had upgraded him to a different, more secure vault. One which was apparently deep enough down in the caverns that they informed him he would need to send word if he wanted to visit it himself, because they would need to prepare an escort—this only confirmed the fact that they knew exactly what he had done. But they didn’t care. Because he had too much money now. Which was insane.
Again, nothing.
Broken.
Pleasure pulsed in his gut. The pressure on his back increased and he collapsed, letting the roots—
It was all important now. If his forced isolation in Grimmauld Place over the past few weeks had given him anything, it was the knowledge that he knew next to nothing about the magic inside him, the magic derived from Voldemort and his deaths, the magic that pumped through his veins with his blood.
Charlie and Bill shared a look that Harry pretended not to notice. It wasn’t the first one of the night, nor would it be the last. He had to stop himself from checking if there was a storm cloud over his head. He knew exactly where it was coming from, though, and he had no intention of helping them along.
“Thankfully, metamorphmagi are not able to change their body shape too much. Can you imagine? Babies are enough of a handful. He likes to get heavier when it’s bath time, though. I swear, he gains four stone every time he hears the water running.”
Even bored out of his mind, he didn’t think he wanted be around anyone else. A weird, jittery tension had worked its way into his brain and he didn’t think he would be able to carry out a normal conversation, even with Ron and Hermione. So he bought a television, managed to hook up a line to the next door building so he could steal their cable, and watched television for the first time in nearly five years. He spent a few hours trying hard to pay attention to a program about an alien who flew around in a police box and dressed like his uncle on a golfing holiday—in fact he was pretty sure he had seen the very same beige jacket and paisley scarf in the Dursleys’ front hall closet when he was younger. He still didn’t understand Dudley’s obsession with the thing. After a while he started getting antsy and he had to force himself not to pace around his new, still mostly empty, flat.
The sky was dark, but…he couldn’t remember what color it had been before. He couldn’t remember
Harry’s pulse quickened as he found himself leaning in as well, a hook somewhere deep inside him pulling him forward—toward Riddle, the handsome, charming, utterly captivating boy who seemed centuries away from the monster who’d killed Harry’s parents. Here, he was the same age as Harry. Eighteen and vital, confident to his core. Slender and tall, all neat black and white lines and angles which sat gracefully on his handsome face.

Harry tried to get closer and see who it was, only the farther he walked the more distant the figure seemed to get. All at once it was vital to learn who was waiting for him, who had brought him here to this quiet, shining, desolate place. Who wouldn’t let him get close enough to see…
