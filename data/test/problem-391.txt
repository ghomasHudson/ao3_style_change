Draco flushed scarlet scowling at the raven, “Release me.” He spat, resorting to anger in place of his embarrassment.
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise rolled his eyes looking sullen, “I didn’t cut his bloody tongue out and they’re more likely to link it to Potter here. He’s the one that’s been harassing your suitors.”
“What?” he snapped, looking irritated.
The Malfoy Heir was suddenly feeling incredibly inadequate, managing to tug himself free and back away with his chin tucked into his chest.
Leo speed walked down the hall desperate to avoid the manic blonde.
Malῠk- little one
Draco stepped away from him slowly, eyeing him warily.
“Dammit Sirius!” Leo snapped when Draco darted up shoving him unceremoniously to the floor.
“Are you blushing?” Harry demanded eyeing the almost unnoticeable pink hue on the boy’s cheeks.
Draco grimaced up at him sullenly before slowly taking him into his mouth, tentatively exploring the appendage and noting the ravens reactions, what he liked and what he didn’t, teeth were a big NO as he accidently discovered but a good thing to keep in mind as it seemed to make Leo uneasy.
"Mister Potter I assure you I've no idea what you mean." Albus denied.
The cashier messed around on the computer a bit before smiling and leading them to a table, “we were a bit behind today so you’re actually not too late, I’ll go grab it from the hot box, and bring it out. You two can find a table.”
Draco let out a shocked laugh and smiled for the first time in a long time, “Kid you don’t know what you’re saying.”
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
"Pansy!" Draco snapped feeling angry and possessive, "Mine!"
As soon as they were far enough away Ron rounded on him and glared. "Are you MAD, if we attract any Attention were screwed. You’re supposed to be at the Dursley’s and Hermione and I are supposed to be at ours. So relax alright?"
"Believe you, I don't even trust you. Look what happened with Leo." Julian scoffed, smirking inwardly, Dumbledore walked right into that one, this might be a bit easier than he thought.
Blaise leaned back in his seat, rubbing his thumb absently over his chin, a slow smirk stretching his lips. “I’m almost impressed Malfoy,” Draco cocked a wary brow, “Maybe I should have left Smith to Lord Potter here. I wonder how he’d have reacted to Smith’s plan to blackmail you into his bed.”
Harry Potter
He could hardly believe it, didn't believe it, but it was true. He had family, family that loved him, that cared for him even. And to think, none of this might have happened if he hadn’t found The Album.
Draco frowned as she returned to her breakfast without an explanation.
“Hagrid did say the restricted section had more than doubled since Dumbledore became Headmaster,” Carina agreed disapprovingly.
“You snuck up on me, startled me.” Lyra accused boldly, standing her ground despite her erratic nerves, and repeated his slight back to him “I was always taught to apologize for such shifty behavior.”
Pansy was gritting her teeth over by the fireplace, face scarlet in her humiliation. Opening her mouth, sharp retort at the ready, she looked ready to kill.
Harry blinked rapidly looking up at the blonde leaning against his counter clutching his stomach as he laughed. “Draco?”
Leo shook his head, “No, the room Eadric used was destroyed by his family, following his disgrace in getting caught. In a journal written by Zahra Slytherin in parseltongue, his Great Granddaughter wrote of a Room that functioned as her ancestors ‘secret room’ had. It provides the same services as the other room for its summoner. Her study of the room revealed that it was a carbon copy of the original only much younger. It wasn’t the same room, but a new one.”
Charles smiled kindly at the two, “Well then, it’s a pleasure to meet you Mr. Malfoy, I hope my Grandson’s not giving you too much trouble.”
The two fourth year Hufflepuffs gasped in disbelief, why the hell was he talking to these little girls again?
“WAIT, wait, aren’t you forgetting something!?” Draco cried in breathless panic, struggling against Leo and the spell which
“Sirius?” Harry asked nervously, standing slowly.
Sirius looked startled, "What!? Why? Remmy, you’re not making sense," obviously he hadn’t figured it all out. Remus almost wished he’d left him to the possessed (Unwashed) laundry.
Harry flopped forward head landing on Draco broad chest, “That was amazing.”
Leo smirked looking amused, “What do you want? Lord Zabini, my family, extended and immediate, has connections in several different industries and companies… and if you agree. Well when I bring Dumbledore to his knees, you’ll have gained a permanent ally in the Potter/Evans/Black Houses as well as the Prewett House I’m sure.”
“Dammit I TOLD you Isabel!” Jonathan raged, rounding on his Wife, “I told you to leave it be! I can’t BELIEVE you pulled a stunt like this after the damage they’ve already done!”
“You…” Chuckie snorted in amusement before he burst out laughing, “Oh wow!”
Don't worry about Mother. I'd always believed you were too good for this family. She's just petty about losing a son. She doesn't realize she'd already lost you.
The Burrow was unusually quiet, the tension was palpable, the occupants tip toeing around each other cautiously.  Bill the oldest son, who had brought his fiancé along to formally meet his family for the first time, had asked where his youngest brother was only to be met with a wave of ire from his mother. His father had muttered some sullen excuse before disappearing into his work shed for the rest of the day.
"She's not lying mate," Julian chuckled, still getting over the shock of meeting someone so similar in appearance to Carina. They were twins after all.
“Subtle? He basically threatened us not to try and separate them with unknown unspoken consequences, deliberately leaving it imprecise, so our minds can supply horrifying scenarios.” Orion studied him critically before clapping him on the shoulder declaring, “I like him.”
Leo shook his head again.
"Relax they aren't here to yell at us," Leo soothed, neglecting to mention the LONG lecture they’d probably be getting later over these little outings of theirs, "They're on our side remember."
Out in the Hall he was met with the most bizarre scene he’d ever come across Sirius Black was struggling to exit his own room, literally clawing at the floor and kicking his feet wildly to dislodge a sphinx fur blanket that was attempting to drag him back in.
"Mister Weasley-"
“Isn’t worrying about clean clothes your job Tinsel?” Draco teased as he rubbed a towel roughly through his hair adjusting the towel around his waist.
"Pssst Harry."
"What?" They demanded in surprise. Very loudly at that, Harry noted unhappily, they were going to get him in trouble.
“Never mind,” Draco chuckled, tongue sweeping his top lip again. Harry’s eyes followed the movement, his breathing was still ragged. Draco didn’t seem to realize that he’d just initiated the first REAL kiss they’d shared in… weeks! Feeling a bit cheated Harry scowled at his boyfriends back thinking quickly, Draco would NOT get away with teasing him. Snatching his hand away the raven made a beeline for the park. He had the perfect idea.
"Dumbledore," Remus growled, he could believe the old man went this far… well actually he could.
“I’ve never been to the cinema… I wanted the first time to be with you,” Draco admitted resting his chin on the boys’ chest as he settled comfortably between his legs.
3 My Sister's (Same Sister) Husband was Arrested New Years Day while on a Coffee run :( His Ex claimed he'd hit punched their Daughter (His oldest shes 3) he's been applying for full custady do to her Drug Addict boyfriend. The Boyfriends claiming he never touched the little girl. We dont believe it
The man nodded, “I am S.B. but you will refer to me as Padfoot. I sent you this mirror because Leo is being a typical Potter. Stubborn and unmovable. Now I’m quite aware that your initial attraction was his appearance. But I must insist you continue to pursue the boy.”
“Boss you’re not getting it!” Theo groaned rubbing his arm where Draco had hit him with a stinging hex when he’d realized he’d been tailing him. “Draco’s not working for anyone! He’s punishing you!”
Draco was studying in the library when a regal looking eagle-owl swooped in with a thin package tied to his leg. Casting the proper cautionary charms and spells he found no trace of hostile spell work and let his curiosity take hold. Inside was a small framed mirror with one word on a scrap of parchment attached to it.
Draco nodded shortly, “Understood.”
Sirius frowned, ""What? It’s true."
Draco smirked, “Alright Kitten, “He chuckled sitting up.
Theo grinned seeming to relax back into the love seat they were sprawled on in her room. “Good.”
Daphne, who seemed horrified by the act, looked at Draco nervously “Right so I’ll just-”
Carina had changed a lot, she no longer felt the pressures of having to impress anybody so she was more relaxed, the affection of a loving family did wonders for her. She tamed her hair straightening it so it looked more like her sisters allowing it to fall about chest level with layers and no frizz. She’d decided to get her ears pierced two in each ear, and her left cartilage. Light natural makeup enhanced her delicate features beautifully, and her uniform was pristine as usual. Although she wore her skirt at mid-thigh length and her school shirt was fitted, instead of loose.
Draco frowned trying to control his ragged breathing, “Huh?” He asked inarticulately.
“Draco.”
Leo burst out laughing.
“My apologies Madam, I find myself in poor company, I need to move.” He said, by way of explanation.
Julian followed lazily glancing over his shoulder spotting Ginny stewing in the corner an ugly sneer aimed at him. Chuckling he raised his brows mockingly at her, causing the girl to crumple her homework in a fit of anger. Fred and George turned to look at him curiously. Julian waved them off gesturing for them to enter the room first. Fred and George open the door immediately kicking out the only other occupant in the room, before waving him in. Strolling in lazily the younger boy glanced around, really not much to look forward to in seventh year was there.
“Huh? What do you mean?” Harry asked he had no idea what the boy was talking about. As far as he was aware the boy had climbed through his window.
“Nice to meet you Ron, Harry rarely shuts up about you, I’ve half a mind to be jealous,” Draco teased, smiling as a bright red flush over takes the red heads face.
Draco frowned, “I haven’t Mum has an aversion, remember?”
“Lyra Amalthea Black!” Carina demanded frantically as she entered the RoR, “Are you mad?!”
“Don’t get it wrong,” Blaise warned harshly, the foreboding look on the Italian’s face wiped the sardonic smirk right off the blondes face.
“Oh MERLIN I love this place,” Lyra laughed looking threw her purchases. She had bought something at almost every place they’d visited.
Blaise snorted rolling his eyes, “It’s called a smile piccolo.” He smirked at Draco, as if suspecting what he was thinking about. If only he knew, Draco thought warily.
Draco shifted awkwardly not knowing what to do. Harry finally just poked and prodded him into placed before curling into his side wrapping Draco’s arm around his shoulders. Draco stared at him for awhile after he settled. Just watching the raven as if waiting for him to tell him this was all a joke, he didn’t know what to think of Harry’s little… lesson. Draco had only ever been in sexual relationships, he didn’t know how to handle this ‘dating’ stuff. Was he just supposed to sit here and not think about Shagging Harry into the Couch they were sitting on? If so Draco was failing miserably. Why was Harry looking at him? Did he do something wrong? Was he thinking out loud? Was Harry Angry now?
Malfoy rolled his eyes, huffing exasperatedly “Because I didn’t want to BOTHER you.”
"Well first of all, her name is Lyra, and second no we don't." Remus slumped slightly, he felt like he’d failed Lettie again.
“Get off,” Draco sneered, internally seething at the truth of the other boys words.
“On your knees,” Draco ordered after a while.
"Enjoyed that did you?" Leo laughed, slouching even further down in his seat.
After a while of ‘exploring’ his jaw began to ach and Leo finally pulled him off by his hair, his muscles jumped and trembled as he forced the blonde back onto his back. Leo had become an animal, vanishing his own trousers and pants and roughly pulling Dracos own off completely this time, leaving them both starkers, ravaging his neck until he cried out in pleasure. Draco’s breathe caught in his chest as he felt the large wet… member, prod his trembling hole again. He wasn’t given another opportunity to protest, his nails bit into the ravens shoulder as he was breached by something much larger then Leo’s fingers. “Gah!”
Ron nodded looking between the two in disbelief, “You two are most definitely related alright, small world.”
“Colorful Julian,” Lyra deadpanned looking unimpressed, Blaise chuckled at the embarrassed flush on the redheads face.
Lyra smirked coldly, “This room was created by Salazar Slytherin. He used it to abduct and interrogate Muggleborn students. After all around the time of the Founders the belief that Muggleborns were stealing the magic of Squib Children was widely believed. A century later it was used by Eadric Slytherin, to mutilate and torture his victims.”
Theo relaxed a slight smile flirting with the corner of his mouth, “Alright then Boss.”
“So if your injuries were faked, why’d you stay out for so long?” Theo asked, glancing at Leo curiously, “You were out for a few weeks weren’t you?”
Draco smirked, “Aw kitten, but it’s time for the main event.”
Leo glared, "Not funny at all." He seethed glancing over his shoulder at the blonde, "He grabbed my ass in Charms. I didn't even know he was behind me."
Tracy who’d been not too far away at the Slytherin Table bit her lip eyes darting to them hopefully.
Julian shook his head, “He’s not overprotective he’s possessive, very possessive.”
Orion’s smirk broke into a smile, “I think I like him. It’s Harry right?”
“Leo has had enough meddling from the old fool, our sources have uncovered Intel stating that the old man had been planning to kill him and steal his magic in the final battle, claim that Leo was going Dark due to all the loss’ he’d suffered. Next he’d stage Carina’s Death to look like a suicide (Greif from losing her friend) and steal her magic. Then he’d hunt down Lyra and he’d officially have stolen all of the old Evans and Potter Family Magics.” Theo explained lacing his fingers with Carina’s in an attempt to calm her.
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, the cold air burning his throat he stared at Leo for a long moment, wondering if the boy even realized what he’d said. If the startled uncomfortable frown on the boys face was any indication he was just as surprised by his sudden admission. But the determined light in his eyes told him the boy wasn’t planning on taking it back anytime soon.
Violet Marie Evans
“ ‘m not Bambi,” Harry muttered sullenly, trying to hide his tears in her hair.
“Why do you like me?”
Draco hummed thoughtfully, “I don’t recall asking, at any rate, I have detention later tonight. I’m off to annoy Orion and her Gryffindor’s for amusements sake.” With that Draco hid a smirk at the confused/offended look on the Red heads face as plans to draw her into his net of allies spun endlessly through his mind. She could be of use to him yet. The mildly lonely feeling he got from her had nothing to do with his decision.
An amused chuckle caught everyone’s attention, causing them to whip around and look at the Door. Theo and Carina startled scrambling away from the door.
Draco scowled at the boy, dropping his unshaken hand, “I hardly find that funny.” He tightened his hold on Harry’s waist.
Leo frowned glancing at Malfoy curiously, “Prep.”
Jonathan was having none of it, “NO! You see here! It’s quite obvious Dursley and Petunia are toxic when it comes to Harry! I’ve been silent long enough. I’ll not have her and her
Leo blinked before frowning, feeling mildly uncomfortable. Ok this was… different. Obviously the blonde didn’t recognize him. Did he really look that different? He’d gotten a haircut, sort of, it wasn’t shorter exactly just styled better. He had new clothes and Rae had insisted he wear his contacts until he’d grown use to them. It was convenient not having to worry about them falling down or getting knocked off during Quidditch.
Daphne, looking frazzled and distressed, paused and looked at him warily, “Yes Potter?”
“Neville! You idiotic FOOL!” Lyra shrieked in outrage. (As her role demanded)
“Course not, you know me.”
The two girls separated and Lyra turned to hug Leo alone.
"I- I don't know," Remus breathed beginning to panic himself. How could they forget about Lettie’s girls? How could they forget about Lettie? Unless…
"Yeah we went to the adoption agency and everything. Carina Black, well they had it as Evans but you know." Leo grinned at their flustered expressions.
“You sure you want to know?” Julian asked a mocking smirk on his face.
Glancing down at himself in just his sweats he debated on whether or not to put a shirt on. He shrugged deciding against it and padded down to the common room to sit and wait in a chair near the fire.
The blonde kicked at a balled up scrap of paper a student had left behind, frowning deeply, he refused to admit he was sulking.
“It does, and it makes the thought of returning to Hogwarts, where you’ll be fawned over like a shiny new broom, all the more displeasing,” Harry deadpanned. He really didn’t like that idea at all.
The sound of pounding feet made him pause and look up. Malfoy barreled around the corner looking over his shoulder before crashing into Leo. They both landed in a tangled heap on the ground.
Remus couldn't believe it. He blinked at the picture rubbing his eyes to clear his suddenly blurry vision. How could he forget her? Seven years in the same classes and he forgot her. He couldn't believe it.
He had been there for at least ten minutes when he heard Leo curse in annoyance.
Draco raised a surprised brow, relaxing slightly, “Does it now.”
Hermione blushed furiously. “You two looked, comfortable,” Harry knew his friends weren’t use to seeing him in such an intimate position. The thought alone caused the young raven to reach a whole new level of embarrassed, he was sure if any more blood surged to his cheeks they would pop.
“You know…” Harry drawled coolly, “I could just kick you out, and masturbate tonight.”
“He’s an Ass!” Draco deadpanned like it said it all, in his mind it really did. The asshole wouldn’t listen when Draco tried to explain, and he treated him like some kind of criminal, when all he wanted to do was make-up for the past… and maybe get in a tumble or two.
In Draco’s opinion, it was far too soon when he felt a second finger forcing its way in alongside Leo’s now slick index finger. He grunted in protest, but there wasn’t much he could do as it breeched him as well.  The process was way too quick, and more than a little rough but before he knew it Leo was pulling three of his fingers from Draco’s loosened hole and attempting to line himself up.
Mikhail almost felt sorry for the Blonde when Ron, Ginny, Dean, and Seamus began talking excitedly amongst themselves. He was surprised to see Hermione and Harry eyeing him knowingly though. He smiled innocently scooping a bit of his breakfast into his mouth and giving a satisfied hum. That would teach the blonde pounce to slight him. Now what to do about the little princess?
Lily smiled at Draco kindly, seeming pleased when he agreed.
The cold Italian took a calculated step forward, eyes never leaving the other boy, he moved slowly until he stood a sink away from the other boy and turned the tap.
Leo sat up, abs flexing temptingly, as he reach up pulling what looked like a thin metal headband from his head the black strings hanging from it. He fiddled with the weird muggle contraption in his lap before turning to glare at Lyra.

1 my Laptop was stolen before Christmas and I lost the Chapter(s) i was working on for 'The Lie in your Truth' and 'Malfoy's Don't Share' as well as my other Stories.
Draco smirked, eyeing Harry’s jeans, “Strip. Now… I’m about to fuck you into that mattress.”
"Relax Malfoy I'm serious, I'm giving in." Leo smirked stripping off his shirt revealing his amazingly well muscled chest. His muscles were perfect, not obnoxious, but most definitely big.
The group of six ended the tour in the Hogshead greeting the bartender politely. Leo had found out he was Albus’ younger estranged brother, the two had a falling out over the tragic mysterious death of their younger sister and never spoke again. Aberforth wouldn’t go to his brother with anything he might over hear. He honestly couldn’t care LESS if someone was planning to ruin the man. He’d honestly be more likely to help. But the teens weren’t ready to make that bet, so as an added precaution they threw up spells to ward off eavesdroppers.
“That thing, is also your Grandchild Jon, Dudley is your Grandson too!” Isabel shouted back, frustration and grief warring on her face.
Millie and Theo exchanged intrigued looks and motioned for him to continue.
“Whatever, just leave him alone,” Malfoy grunted, running a hand through his hair in agitation, he didn’t seem able to look Leo in the eye as he scowled at the wall beside him. That pissed Leo off even more.
Draco frowned, studying the other boys’ expression thoughtfully, “And you and Lily don’t want them here?”
Leo glared, a defiant look in his eyes “He’s up to something. He’s got to be working for Dumbledore or Voldemort they’re trying to get to me.”
~The Next Day~ The Next Day~ The Next Day~ The Next Day~ The Next Day~ The Next Day~ The Next Day~
Pansy flushed and ducked her head hurrying off, muttering something about Casanova.
“DRACO!” Harry screamed before his vision went white slowly fading to black. Harry still felt Draco driving into him, so he obviously wasn’t dead. Harry gasped trying to force air into his lungs as he blinked and groaned trying to regain his vision despite the white spots that danced across his sight every time Draco drove into him after reaching that euphoric high at least twice more Harry could really tell his mind was so fuzzy. Draco finally slammed in violently shook as he growled out his release and collapsed onto of Harry in exhaustion. Harry panted heavily wiping Draco’s sweat soaked bangs out of his eyes and pressing an tired kiss to his forehead, “That was fun.”
Draco glanced at his watch pretending to look shocked, as he demanded “Bloody hell, we’re going to be late, why didn’t you wake me?”
“True,” Draco smirked before sitting up and looking Harry in the eye, he didn’t even hesitate before dipping his head and catching Harry’s lips in a slow kiss.
"Want us to call you Leo now?" Sirius asked hopefully, he wanted to get rid of anything connecting his godson to that man, "No offense kid, but Harry doesn't suit you, it sounds like an old man’s name like Jamie's dad."
Draco bit his lip. Maybe he should try a different approach. He was still going to chase the boy but maybe he’d go for a more subtle approach, let Leo come to him.
“You’re a virgin, you wouldn’t have lasted to long if I’d taken you right away, it takes a while to build up stamina.” Draco explained only sounding slightly breathless.
“Back off Paul,” Harry sniped, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck. A smile flirting with the corners of his lips as Draco dragged them both to their feet, kissing his jaw again.
“Shut UP you manipulative little shit!” Jonathan roared, rounding on the Dursley’s.
Harry chuckled watching him shuffle around looking for his clothes. Harry snatched his boxers away when he found them. “I’m keeping these.” He smirked at Draco’s shocked face.
“I have to go shower and change, but I promise I’ll greet you all properly at Lunch, my apologies.” He smiled appropriately turning to face them fully, as he strolled over. Allowing Draco eyes to devour every inch of his bare muscled chest, taking in the brand, and the tattoo-
“Do we,” Theo glanced over at Draco and froze, his face paling a by a shade or two “If I may Boss.”
Draco flushed even more, ducking his head. He didn’t know how to react to that information, but the amused look everyone was giving him was horrifying.
Harry had managed to save a lot of valuable things from his Aunt’s greedy clutches and in the end had allowed the rest to be packed up into Vernon’s stupid shiny new car his promotion provide him with. He ran his hand over his grandfather’s authentic brown leather jacket it fit him perfectly so he’d immediately tossed it in his closet before Dudley or Petunia could snatch it away. Merlin knows Dudley would ruin it trying to make it fit him, and Petunia would probably pawn it or something.
“No,” Leo sighed, his relaxed mood slowly edging toward annoyance, as he turned a page in his book.
“Let’s hope not,” Leo pulled her into a hug, keeping his eyes cold and unforgiving through the entire speech “I would hate to have to through you back to the wolves.”
Here's the next chapter! Thought i'd post two to make up for my absence! It's not as long as the other but it's something!!
"Prewett then, believe me when-"
Draco shrugged carelessly, “That’s when I was interested in you.”
“Well it wasn’t for lack of opportunity I assure you,” Orion scolded, as if Harry had claimed otherwise, “Draco had plenty of people ask him out over the years, but he vehemently refused everyone of them. He swore to me once that he’d never date, because he didn’t want to fall in love. Not until he left school and had enough money saved away from his parents to survive when they inevitably disowned him. Do you know what that tells me?”
Draco cleared his throat pushing off the wall and stepping back, he scratched his neck uncomfortably glancing at a wildly blushing Harry every so often, “So you fancy me?”
Julian rolled his eyes, though he had to agree with the Floozy part. "Of course she is Boss, a real tart."
Petunia and Isabel shrieked, futilely attempting to shield a cowering Dudley, as Draco charged forward slamming Vernon Dursley into a wall fist raised as if to hit him.
“Tracy made a Salve for you, Malfoy?”
"How dare that floozy try to touch me. I’ve no idea where she’s been. Disgusting," Leo hissed. He hated acting like this but he was still wary of the two Slytherins and he was angry at Ginny. She thought she could force him into something he didn’t want, she had another thing coming.
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
Draco raised a cool brow, “I’d hardly call sitting in a tree top, and yes I knew he was there, stalking especially considering I didn’t mind. You on the other hand ARE bothering me.”
Leo was talking to Julian at lunch when it happened. He didn’t know why it pissed him off so much, but at that moment he was ready to explode. So that probably explained why the pitcher of pumpkin juice Neville was trying to pour Carina shattered.
The train jerked before slowly starting to move.
“Our bedrooms are upstairs. The perk to living underground is that we have plenty of unused space down here to do as we please. My Mum was a Ravenclaw, her house was in one of the towers. Apparently they stuff five students into a room, strange that, you’d think magic would grant them a few liberties. Guess not.” Blaise murmured as he looked around.
“Coming Kitten?”
Things were alright for now.
George nodded, “Julian… well he’s supposed to be Head of the House right now, you know Pureblood tradition, by eight their supposed to have been sent before the head of the family to begin training to be the next Head of the Noble house of Prewitt, and you know Granfather’s not well enough to force the issue. We haven’t seen him since Ron was six either, he’s not been able to come to any Family events, and Mum’s kept us away from our cousins and aunts and uncles on Dad’s side as well.”
Harry and his friends exchanged somber expressions, while Ginny merely looked sad.
“Halfway through third year this tiny bossy little blonde strolled up to us and insisted we were all to be friends. Draco and I obviously laughed and ignored her, only to have her pop up randomly and do something to help us, she’d insist it was because we’re her friends… somewhere along the way we paused and realized the little minx had tricked us into actually becoming her friends. It just sort of happened.” Mikhail laughed fondly at the memory, “We’ve been stirring up trouble ever since… but you know I don’t think Rion meant to trick us… I think she was just lonely. Drumstrang is a hard place for someone like Orion to be, a fallen pureblood family like the Blacks… it made her an easy target for some of the crueler students.”
“Your loyalty to your friend is intriguing,” Leo admitted he was surprised she was pushing so firmly, especially with how worried she was about losing their ‘protection’. He obviously wasn’t going to let anything happen to the girl, unless she betrayed them. But he knew desperation could make people do things you wouldn’t expect. He wouldn’t trust her completely just yet.
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
Julian smirked winking at her before turning back to the Fourth year girls he was chatting up while waiting for Leo.
“…and your name was Carina, Carina Aurora Evans."
you Dursley. Would you like to repeat that?”
“Viktor and Silvija,” Harry murmured softly with a wistful smile, “they graduated the year before last, Draco never told me what happened with them? I hope Silvija said yes, he did ask her right?”
“Me too baby, but on the bright side, your roommates will be able to sleep.” Draco smirked, obviously amused by his own statement.
Harry threw his head back chin trembling as he made whining noises at the foreign feeling. He squealed again when Draco jabbed his tongue against the trembling rosebud before forcing it in slightly and pulling out just as quickly.
"I thought Lily was your only sister Pet?" Vernon grunted, actually setting his fork down to pay attention, it was defiantly a first.
Theo nodded tightly and stood bringing Carina with him. They walked casually over to the Slytherin table ignoring the curious stares of fellow students. None of them had sat separately since the group had been formed so students and teachers were bound to be startled by the turn of events. Theo sat in his old seat helping Carina into the spot next to him that Millicent use to occupy at meals. Malfoy a few seats down was watching him suspiciously.
Leo looked around feeling his agitation build, but he couldn’t allow his mask to fall just yet.
“I have had ENOUGH!” Leo turned looking at the five coldly, “We have ONE goal right now.”
Draco caught the boy easily still staring at the smiling woman incredulously. She didn’t know him, owed him nothing really. And yet she was willing to pay him a kindness for simply loving her Grandson… Draco’s eyes widened at his revelation. He loved Harry… He Loved Harry… Well Fuck! How’d that happen?
“Come on Julian, this is exciting," Lyra giggled at Julian’s resigned expression.
Harry grunted averting his gaze and doing his damndest to remain quiet, “You’re an ass.”
Blaise finally stopped in front of an oddly smooth patch of wall, knocking pointedly twice so Draco would understand, the Italian waited until the wall bubbled slightly before appearing to melt. Draco flinched slightly as a genderless figure seemed to stretch out of the wall, mouth gapping wide as it lurched toward them before rasping out a scratchy “Password?”
Harry nearly choked on his own laughter, “Okay that did sound cheesy,” Harry chuckled shaking his head at his own words.
“You ramble.” Draco noted in mild amusement.
'That's it I'm sick of this he's driving me barmy. He's either banging Malfoy or dealing with this soon, and I'm going to make sure of it.'
Leo looked down at the blonde who was covering his mouth to muffle his ragged breathing and peering nervously around Leo at the boy out in the hall. He shifted awkwardly causing Draco to start and look up in surprise. He hadn’t realized how much shorter Draco was then him now. Leo was at least a head taller than the boy. He was also much broader then the boy, Draco was thin and toned. Leo was broad and built, not obnoxiously so but enough to make a difference, definitely enough to pin the boy effortlessly to the wall.
Zacharias Smith liked to think he was a clever guy. After all he managed to blackmail a Malfoy, a feat not many people are clever enough to achieve. To catch a Malfoy unaware is nearly impossible. Draco Malfoy, was at his mercy, now nothing could stop him from completing his task for the Headmaster. As an added bonus, he had his own pretty little Malfoy to play with.
"Try Black, Regulus was they're father," Sirius supplied excitedly, he almost grinned at Harry's shock.
“If that’s true, the two of you could be cousins." Ron mused looking at the picture critically, "It's genetically impossible to be this similar in looks. Cheeks, eyes, Nose, Lips, she's even got your ears Herm I'd bet my left nut she's your mum."
‘Bugger’
"Draco… DRACO WAKE UP YOU BLOODY WANKER," Potter snapped.
"Get him to agree to help us willingly and you're in."
Petunia looked shocked as if she'd just come out of a Daze. Vernon looked up from the table frowning, and Dudley (who had just made it in the room) looked confused.
“Malfoy! Got a date or something later?” a random third year Slytherin asked curiously. A Date? No Leo had turned him down, although the other boy was still giving him the cold shoulder he couldn’t have moved on already… right? No, Malfoy had said he liked him, said he REALLY liked him.
Ron chuckled, "I've known for a while, I'm okay with it I promise. Sure it stung and first and I was jealous but you're one of my best friends and I want you to be happy. Anyway I can't much say anything when I think Parkinson's got one of the sweetest asses in all of Hogwarts now can I," he smirked at Leo and Carina's looks of disbelief.
Twisted Irish
So again, I apologize for the long absence, but I am back. And while my posts wont be scheduled as they once were. I will be posting again. I hope you all can forgive me.
Harry eyed Ron suspiciously as the red head slipped into his seat placing a sweet kiss on Hermione’s cheek as he did. Hermione frowned at her boyfriend in concern ignore Lavender’s usual sulky wounded eyes she shot at them ever since they’d started dating.
A curly haired brunette relaxed slightly but the suspicion was still there, “Hermione Granger, Harry’s Muggleborn friend.” Harry looked horrified at her introduction.
“I guess,” Draco scratched the back of his neck sheepishly, “He talked about me did he?”
“You sure as hell don’t act like one,” Draco scowled up at him grabbing his hips to steady him.
“Blaise!” Draco hissed lowly growing frustrated with his friend’s reckless behavior, “No Mobster-talk in public, please!”
"Carina," Hermione insisted, she didn’t want to be associated with the Grangers anymore, "From now on I’m going by the name my mum gave me, Carina Evans or when I learn my Fathers last name that."
"What!?" Harry demanded when her words caught up to him. The woman looked startled.
“Do you Understand Draco?” Lucius asked silkily, clearly under the impression that Draco had been listening “Are we clear?”
Draco stared in shock, "Are you taking the mick you bloody wanker?"
Jonathan laughed leading the boy out to the car while he bounced around asking what it was. “You’ll have to wait and open it Brat!”
Draco scoffed turning his nose up at the raven, “Never thought a Gryffindor could be such a bloody coward. Get Off!”
This had to be about a bloke, and as she wasn’t saying anything, there was a high possibility that it was a bloke she fancied. The thought had Julian’s stomach tied up in knots. Not because Leo would be angry, no Julian would have just shook his head and gone back to his book if that was the case. No, it was for the simple fact that Julian had been crushing on Lyra Black since the last week of summer when she had come to his room to confess her fears of not living up to her long lost families’ expectations. She had broken down and cried into his chest all the while begging him to help her so they didn’t send her back to the orphanage. Julian had of course done his best to comfort and sooth her fears. He’d succeeded for the most part. Finally he forced her to face her family and admit her insecurity. Sirius had immediately sent Julian and Remus to the kitchen so he could be alone with his Nieces and Nephew (Screw technicalities he was his Nephew!) Three hours later they returned to find the Four wrapped up on the couch. Lyra trapped snuggly in the center of the strange hug/dog pile. She’d looked up at him, and smiled so sincerely it made his heart ache. He knew of course he could never have her, Leo would obliterate him. But he still had a small amount of hope. Hope that one day Lyra would be his. He would of course have to hide out for a couple months. Leo would be out for Blood and as soon as Sirius was informed it wouldn’t only be Theodore on his Hit List.
Harry scowled meeting his gaze, “Your hot Draco, both girls and blokes at school will be after you… I don’t like it.”
Orion eyed the letter warily “Well, get on with it then. What’d he say?”
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
"Either I've lost it, and now believe bushes talk, or someone is in the bush and calling me" he drawled sarcastically.
“It’ll work out I promise,” Orion smiled sweetly as she moved to lean next to him Mikhail and the others moving closer.
“You’re right, I’ve just got to trust him.”
Theo nodded once firmly, ignoring Carina’s frantic expression, she was a mess with all the stress she had going on. He could almost see the old ‘Hermione’ and he didn’t like it. He needed to see Leo
Draco sighed dropping his head in exasperation again, “Why were you watching me? Please tell me your not actually this thick.”
“No,” Harry mumbled voice thick with tears, “The Dursley’s are horrible people. You know my Mum’s a Muggleborn?”
Draco glanced up at him before complying moving a bit faster, Harry groaned in annoyance, “More, Harder.”

Latin
“Lord Black,” Blaise greeted with a firm shake.
Draco startled blinking down at his hand that was suddenly twined perfectly with Leo’s. Their hands fit perfectly together causing Draco’s face to heat shyly. It was like Draco’s hands were made to fit in the other boys.
Sirius looked shocked, "Molly's older brother? He's the oldest right."
“Right, can you give me a moment, I’ll be right there.” Draco smirked at the uneasy look the two sent him before they nodded and gestured to the door, a sign they’d be right there if he needed them.
Smith chuckled before ducking his head to the other boys’ neck and dragging his tongue along the protruding vein that ticked lightly in his fury. Draco cringed in disgust attempting, and failing, to pull away.
"It seems we do," Millicent shook it, all business once again.
xXxXHPxDMXxXx
Daphne looked up an interested spark in her eye, “I’ve been a bit curious about that as well. Ever since the scene in the Hallway really, it didn’t really seem staged but many students were wondering if it was a lovers spat or something.”
Tousling his hair one last time with a towel Draco huffed dropping it in a bin as he opened the door to release the steam from the room, he’d used Leo’s bath out of convenience so it was no surprise when he opened the door and spotted Leo sprawled out on his bed. He did however take a second glance, Leo was still in his jeans and socks, his grey and black tartan plaid button down was unbuttoned. The dim glow of the moon cast an eerily beautiful glow across his bare skin, displaying his well developed chest and abs to anyone who walked passed. The light from the bath was just shy of reaching the bed, biting his lip Draco glanced back at his night shirt the only part of his nightwear he’d yet to don, before slowly creeping out toward the thankfully slumbering older boy.
Theo cleared his throat awkwardly, “T’s not so bad.”
Leo frowned at the two Slytherins, they were sitting far too close for his liking. It was just his luck, Smith disappears before Leo could get his hands on him, now this fool steps in and thinks he can take Malfoy away from him. The boy was far too popular for Leo’s liking he was going to have to do something about that.
"I was kidding, I'm Evan, Evan Black."
Leo grabbed the boy's ass firmly and forced him up, wrapping his legs around his waist so he could get a better angle as he ground himself more firmly against him.
The others laughed and continued talking about trivial nonsense and catching up on regular day to day nonsense. Planning the demise of their ‘esteemed’ Headmaster didn’t leave much time for being regular teenagers. It was a relief to just kick back and be young once in a while. These moments were rare and precious.
“Please Daphne, we aren’t contagious.”
I can't tell you how much I miss your presence in the house. Mother of course has blasted you from the family tree. But I think we both knew this would happen. I've always been jealous you were able to be yourself. I was never brave enough. I fear Fathers wrath too much.
Once all four were settled, Blaise and Adrian grudgingly so, Orion tilted her head ignoring the pointed looks they were receiving from other Slytherins. “Interesting. I find Gryffindors to be quite chatty, Uncle Sirius was correct when he said it was fun being a Black in Gryffindor, they share secrets so willingly its almost too easy.”
“I don’t recall giving you permission to use my name so comfortably,” Daphne hissed in outrage, red hair flaring slightly with her magic.
“Awful, child, should’ve been drown at birth!” Molly hissed under her breath as she scrubbed violently at a plate that night. Bill wisely guided his uneasy Love from the room, deciding it best to call it a night.
Remus Lupin
Draco frowned, but said nothing he understood that this must still be very confusing for the raven. And they were only fifteen, they had plenty of time. He followed the other boy dutifully as they strolled casually down the empty streets of Hogsmeade.
“Thought you’d go all summer with no letter and get away with it?” he accused in mock indignation.
“Sorry,” he grumbled quietly so no one else could hear them, as they walked into the Great Hall passed the Slytherin Table. This past week since the Hogsmead trip had seen the group grow closer. Millicent and Theo had merged seamlessly into Leo’s life, almost as if they’d always been a part of it.
Carina snatched the T-shirt from him looking irritated, “Another shirt Leo? Do you know how hard it is to get grease and oil out of clothing pretty soon the House Elves are going to start making you do your own laundry… or just start throwing your shirts away period!”
"You put up with me," Julian countered calmly, eyes narrowing minutely.
Theo sighed heavily, cradling her face in his hands, “Zabini wouldn’t be that reckless Car, so we’ll be fine.”
“Are you going to stare at me every time I have my shirt off?” Leo chuckled lightly, bare feet slapping softly on the marble floor as he rounded the couch to drop softly down beside him. He sighed as he all but melted into the comfortable leather. “I love this couch.”
Draco nodded, adjusting himself on the couch to get comfortable, gesturing for Harry to continue.
"Bulstrode."
Leo stood warily bracing both hands on the table and looking at Draco intently, “Your Father came to the school with him, I freed the little bastard.”
"Oh, Okay," Harry shrugged before dropping the hammer, wiping his hands on his jeans, and walking over to crouch down next to the bush.
Blaise raised an amused brow at the girl, smirking at the fury on his blonde friends face.
Ginny seemed to catch on first, and attempted to muffle her laughter, “Aw Harry, are you Jealous?”
Well, this is the last of my Prewritten chapters! The next one should be up in the next week or two! Thanksgiving is just around the corner so I'll say it now. Happy Thanksgiving! I know I'm thankful for all your support! You guys keep me writing, as does feedback! So let me know in the comments below what you think of the story so far! I read and respond to every one of them. Enjoy your week! Until next time -T.I-
“What is going on here?” Lily asked warily, staring at the blonde in confusion, she didn’t recognize him though he looked familiar.
Harry burst in on the touching moment wrapping his arms around his startled Grandmother hugging her tightly, “Thank you, thank you, Thank You Oma!” Harry laughed before releasing her and launching himself into Draco’s arms.
"You lied about my name," Leo snarled, momentarily losing his cool, "Who the Bloody Hell lies to someone about their name!"
“Sir and Lady will only be punishing Tinsel instead,” the elf grumbled shrewdly rolling large eyes.
"Fine then, we let Leo drive his self and eventually the rest of us, barmy." Julian sighed, "Look he's either going to shag Malfoy or beat the pulp out of him, I just want this Shit to end."
Harry groaned miserably, sagging into the sand. Draco blinked, trying to process what was just shouted at them, through the lusty haze. Harry squirmed struggling to brace himself up on his elbows. “Chuckie, Noah… Paul, you’re interrupting something.” Making eye contact with his confused Boyfriend he mouthed the word ‘Muggles’ to let him know they were safe. Draco nodded absently trying to sort his thoughts.
Leo glanced at him, he wasn’t in the mood for this shit, "Walk with me Nott, I'm sure we have much to discuss."
"Yes you have," Draco said primly before faltering nervously as the boy unzipped his pants.
Draco hissed a violent threat at the girl before sighing and turning to the elves. “Can we go through?”
“Obviously,” Chuckie barked out a laugh when Harry began to protest loudly, whining about their ruined date.
Draco blinked, before clearing his throat and looking away, he’d obviously understood.
Tracy blushed ducking her head, “She’s my best friend,” she repeated weakly.
“Daphne,” Leo called, as he passed her on his way out of their final class that Friday.
Relief.
Waiting for the others to right themselves Draco finally took notice of the cold, the Sphinx fur blankets had kept them quiet warm on the ride up but now the cold could reach them, wrapping its icy fingers around their very bones. The Dwarf snatched its staff back from Bulstrode with a reproachful look before hobbling over to the massive doors and knocking twice with the gnarled staff. The doors creaked ominously before slowly swinging inward.
On the ground floor, from behind the French doors leading onto the terrace he could hear enraged screaming and barely make out the sickly pale face of Walburga Black.
Just when Ron was about to seek out the other Aurors present to discuss further procedure, an anguished cry broke through the night. It was followed by the sound of several pairs of heavy boots pounding down the steps of the terrace.
“It’s called surrogacy, you nasty cunt. It’s when one consenting adult agrees to donate an egg cell and to carry a baby for a party of other consenting adults.” Sirius had risen from his seat and held his wand trained at Bellatrix who was curiously tapping her injured cheek.”It’s a Muggle concept so you wouldn’t know about it. All you despicable excuse for a human being knows is how to rape someone to get pregnant. As if someone as rotten and dead inside as you would even be able to carry a child.”
“You did what? You dared to lay a hand on him?” The Head Auror had his wand pointed at a sneering Bellatrix as well now. “Not my husband, you bitch!”
A hissed curse, aimed at the pair seemingly out of nowhere, was easily deflected with a flick of his wrist without even jostling the dozing child.
And when he had opened up the pages of a well-loved book of fairytales and Harry had wormed his way into his lap to get a better look at the colourful drawings, he had felt a spark of hope take root in his chest.
So when he landed inside a cozy living room, stumbling over an army of stuffed animals, he was disoriented for just a second. It shouldn't have surprised him that the last thing he saw before passing out were the shocked but ever so warm brown eyes of one James Fleamont Potter.
The Muggle-born man held his back ramrod straight, not letting it show how unsettled he must be feeling meeting his wife’s family for the first time in about 30 years. A family that hated him for who he was and cut out their own daughter for loving him like an infection.
Safe to say, it hadn’t had the good grace to turn to ashes and dust.
Taking in the long entrance hall and the majestic staircase lined with severed and shrunken house-elf heads, mounted to the wall on plaques, he couldn’t help but wrinkle his nose in distaste. And what even was the thought process behind using the severed leg of a troll as an umbrella stand? That was so 16th century, he was afraid some of that bad taste would rub off on him by simply breathing in that dusty air.
"I don't think it was him if that's what you’re asking. Kingsley found him and Malfoy in Sirius' old bedroom. They were… engaged otherwise." Hermione smirked over to a bay window on the ground floor to where the pale blond hair of Draco and Harry’s wild mane could be seen behind the paned glass.
Whatever tonight would bring, he could only hope for them all to make it through safely. With that in mind and just a tiny bit of anticipation to see a certain someone tonight, he climbed the worn set of front steps.
A tight, warm heat wrapped around his cock, wetting the soft skin deliciously. Moaning, he finally managed to make his hands obey him again, only to card them into Draco’s blond tresses. From there, it was utter mayhem. His fiance was pulling out all of Harry’s favourites: A teasing nibble to the weeping tip. A clever tongue running up and down the pulsing vein along his cock. Elegant fingers cradling his balls and stroking carefully at his perineum.
“Kreacher will bring Master Teddy to Master’s fathers. Kreacher will Master Teddy not let be getting hurt, Kreacher swears by the Noble and most Ancient House of Black.”
Regulus had thought he could stand anything. Could stand a life of being the spare, to be nothing more than an expendable second choice. To be, if nothing else, the picture perfect second-born son that was at least valuable enough to barter away into a prestigious marriage arrangement if nothing else.
A bite to the neck brought him back into the moment.
"Draco…," On a sigh, Harry pulled the other man into a deep kiss. "Harder, fuck me harder!"
“Kreacher is knowing that Master Teddy is being the new Master of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black as soon as Master Teddy enters Grimmauld Place. The family magic is deciding right then.” Kreacher was wringing his hands and pacing along the long table. “Kreacher is being a part of Grimmauld Place for a long time. Kreacher recognizes Master Teddy as his new master right then. And then Master Teddy is running from the fighting and screaming in the Dining Room and out in the garden.”
But a glance at his mother’s stricken face told him that it was not empty assumptions or lies that Sirius was airing out. And to think that Regulus was forced to be in her presence tonight. Did Harry and James know about it? A glance in the furious face of the older Potter and Harry’s bright green eyes, brimming with tears and staring unseeingly at the table, confirmed his suspicions that they hadn’t heard about this before.
And then there were the condescending smirks of Lucius and Narcissa aimed in his direction even as they made a show of the polite conversation with his parents. The nerve of these people - he couldn’t wait for all their joint future family holidays.
Especially the dining room with its long wooden table and the tableware with the Black family crest on each plate and bowl and the low hanging lights fixtures held its fair share of nightmares. He did not care to relive those anytime soon.
"Filth! Scum! Blood traitors! You did it, you killed the one true heir of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black!" The screeching wails of Walburga Black were echoing through the halls of Number 12 Grimmauld Place to haunt the guests of one doomed Samhain celebration for years to come.
“Hazza, up!” Looking down, he came face to face with his godson - one adorable Edward Lupin in all of his baby-toothed, bubblegum-blue haired glory.
And Teddy himself, little Teddy with his ever changing colourful hair and bright smile who was tiredly blinking away, tucked away safely in his father's arms.
Starting, Ron took a headcount once more. "Where's Harry?"
(See the end of the chapter for
On the left side of the table the Potters sat arranged like organ pipes from Harry right next to him, then Regulus to James. He could see that James' hand rested on Regulus’ knee, squeezing every other moment to reassure him. Regulus was decidedly not looking up to the head of the table where Walburga herself was holding court. She sat flanked by the remaining Black sisters on the one side and Lucius and his progeny on the other.
And then there was Draco. Staring back at her defiantly and clutching Harry's hands between his own, ready to fight for his love even if he didn't know what or who he would be fighting against. At least this relationship would be strengthened by tonight's events.
He had a feeling that it was going to be a long night for all of them.
“Glad my dick could be of use as your personal de-stressor.” With a grin, Draco peppered butterfly kisses across Harry’s tan cheekbones.
How could he not when each time he turned in that small cottage, he was met with the blinding smile and kind heart of James Potter. The same smile that greeted him when he woke up on Harry’s third birthday, wrapped up in strong, bronze arms.
Barking a rough laugh, Sirius sneered across the table at Walburga: “So after all the trouble you went through by blasting us off the family tree, the bloody house doesn’t regard us as disinherited? That’s bloody brilliant!”
James had always suspected that there was a story there, even when Regulus first came to Godric’s Hollow. He wasn’t in the Auror force for nothing and the way the younger Black had looked that evening, he had always been sure that some sort of sexual assault must have occured. And he had always suspected Bellatrix to have been involved, seeing as Reg had visceral reactions each time the woman was mentioned.
“Teddy, is that you? It’s Hermione, uncle Harry’s friend!” She pulled the door open hurriedly and came across a very peculiar scene.
The opulence and a few clearly audible "blood traitors" made Ron feel like dirt. If the rest of the Sacred 28 lived like that, then it definitely put some things into perspective. You practically had to grow up to be a dickhead when there were snakes writhing all around you, watching your every move, and your deceased ancestors muttering behind your back all the time.
“Celebratory for whom? Slytherin or Gryffindor?” James watched his husband walk into the bathroom with a smirk. It had been ten years, but he was still as in love with the little Black as he had been back then.
But Teddy was safe.
Holding his hand up towards the knocker, Regulus Black held his back ramrod straight as the silver serpent twisted into life. With an aggressive twist forward, its incisors embedded themselves into his palm.
He entwined their fingers and led them out of that godforsaken room. Behind them, chaos broke loose. Draco could hear tableware breaking, screaming and shouting. Thumping steps were sounding behind them, but he didn’t allow himself to be deterred from getting Harry as far away from it all as possible.
The brothers resembled each other so much, that people sometimes mistook them for twins. With their black hair, that both of them wore long, by now way past their shoulders, and their haughty good looks, they were striking. Even if Sirius had always claimed that his little brother was absolutely smaller, slighter, and - not to forget - less handsome than Sirius himself, James had to confess that his best friend was way off. In his eyes, Regulus’ beauty surpassed his older brother by far.
“I can hear you thinking, darling,” Warm, grey eyes blinked up at him sleepily before a sure hand wound itself into his unruly bedhead to pull him closer still. "Don't even think about starting something you can’t bring to an end."
“Teddy! You’re a sight for sore eyes!” He pulled the boy in his lap and cuddled him close. There was nothing more soothing than the soft giggling of the little boy, the calming smell of baby that the toddler had not yet grown out of, and his warm weight in his arms.
But how should he have foreseen that his mother had indeed planned for more. That she would invite Bellatrix to participate in one of her reprimanding sessions.
“Well, well. If that isn’t the illustrious, codependent Black brothers and their little pets. Here to see the little Potter lose spectacularly?” The silvery blond head of Lucius Malfoy promptly took up James’ few of the pitch.
He cut a short glance at her. Her hair was neatly braided even at this hour, so she probably hadn’t made it back to the small flat she shared with Ron’s sister Ginny right off Diagon Alley before having been called to the scene. Her robes were sharply cut, letting her strike an imposing figure in the gloom of the Blacks’ back garden.
And what more, the smile’s tiny carbon copy was blinding him with its brightness right alongside it.
There was no love lost between most in attendance. Rather, there had been a cloying, sickening mantle of mistrust and aversion pressing down on the whole affair for hours now. And as sad as it was for a family to come to this point: no one would put it past the others to be able to raise their hand and wand against a cousin, an aunt or even a son.
Even if he had worked through the misguided beliefs on blood purity and elitism his family were still so fond of, he couldn’t really work out the original thought process behind that real estate acquisition. Was he really meant to believe that any member of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black willingly accepted sharing walls left and right with the Muggle inhabitants of numbers 11 and 13 Grimmauld Place up until now?
“Nah, mister. We are not going down that road, not until tonight when there is no metaphorical Snitch hovering right above my head while you’re drilling into me.” Ripping the warm sheets away, Regulus got up abruptly. “I like celebratory sex the best, anyway.”
“Well it’s not as if we plan to keep it a secret for much longer. Can you imagine their faces? The scion of House of Malfoy about to wed a Potter? Maybe that will be the last straw to push great aunt Walburga into the afterlife or put aunt Bella into the Janus Thickey Ward. We'd deserve an Order of Merlin for either one.”
He sent a condescending glance back at where the older woman was still silently screaming, no matter Kingsley’s efforts at calming her down.
"I will right this mistake, I will rid this family of the stain that is your very existence! Avada-" There was green tinted magic gathering at the tip of her wand, malice pouring out into the ever decreasing spice between them.
Kreacher shuddered then, a violent tremor running up and down his skinny frame.
The other man just smirked at him when taking Teddy off Harry’s hands and clapped him on the shoulder. He was still willing his blush down when he stepped into the dimly lit hall.
Just a second after thinking that Sirius had stayed true to himself and his passions even through adulthood, Harry found himself with his back pressed to the wall. Crowding against him, eagerly sucking at his pulse point and a hand snaking into his dress robes, was Draco.
"If I have to remind you all, dear Dromeda refused a proper pureblood marriage just to be with that Mudblood right here and I really cannot begin to imagine why." A sudden coldness descended over the room then.
“Is that where that damned family tapestry is? Mother’s still having nightmares about her name being scorched off that piece of fabric. Do you reckon my name’s still on there or that our endearing great aunt has blasted it off when I was born?” With a smirk back at Draco, Tonks set off towards the stairs.
Lost in thought, he didn't even realise that his parents went upstairs, leaving him behind with the elf heads. Locking eyes with one frail looking head, he tried to make sense of the grotesque choice of interior once more.
They never talked all that much about the House of Black at home. Sure, there were his uncle Sirius' tirades that occured once a year where he spewed insults, that would get Harry grounded for using them even at the ripe age of 22, before falling into an impenetrable bubble of silence and stupor.
"Sodding, buggering fuck!"
A quick look around showed him that the last missing parts of the extended Black family had made their entrance, and an entrance it was. There was Sirius, who looked so much like his brother and the three cousins currently eyeing him with emotions ranging from fondness to annoyance to outright animosity if Bellatrix’ hateful glare was anything to go by.
“But what about us? Aren’t you afraid that they’re going to find out about us?” Green eyes met silvery grey and although he tried not to let his worry show, he couldn’t help the furrow digging in between his brows.
With barely suppressed grumbling, the house-elf slinked back down to the kitchen.
To be brought in as a consulting expert in a house like Number 12 Grimmauld Place was the jackpot for every researcher on pureblood society. The place was reeking of dark magic, blood curses, and all that other fun stuff. She was having a field day just mapping the atmosphere and magical imprints all around her.
Before Harry even knew it, he found himself in a gloomy Drawing Room with a tumbler of Firewhiskey in hand. He cast a forlorn look around the room, feeling lost and unsure of himself for the first time in forever. Having grown up with James Potter, Lily Evans-Potter and Regulus Black as his parents, he had a healthy self-confidence and the guilty pleasure of being the centre of attention.
“There is no feeling more horrible than feeling unsafe in your own home, just because someone else feels like they are entitled to your misery. Someone is afraid of walking down to the Great Hall for breakfast because of you, Harry. If that knowledge gives you a feeling of power, I have utterly failed you.”
The wolfish grin aimed his way made unease settle low in Ron’s stomach.
His efforts were met with a disgusted groan.
It might have been because of their missing son. But maybe they had already seen the body from up close, had even put it there. Who was to know with circumstances like these?
Maybe they would return to the Black family home in the future. Sometime when Teddy and his bright soul will have banned the darkness from the long hallways and banished the bad memories from the countless rooms within. But for now, they weren’t in a hurry to return to Number 12 Grimmauld Place.
Then there were the Malfoys, Lucius and Narcissa: So used to their privilege and being treated preferentially but never held accountable for anything. Being held under suspicion of murder or even fratricide without a way to buy their way out of Grimmauld Place must have come as a shock.
When she stormed into the Drawing Room, Ron was still interviewing Sirius behind a Muffliato. The rest of the Black family was either sitting at the two big couches in the middle of the room or were interviewed by other Aurors.
“Aww, it’s little Reggie and dumb-dumb Siri!” Cackling, Bellatrix climbed the steps to where their seats were with deadly grace.
Draco turned to him then and pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.
To be the tiny, dying star next to his older brother’s all-consuming supernova of charisma, rebellion, and a heart of gold. It had taken him some time to realise that he was more like a moon to Sirius’ sun - soaking up that bright light and love the older son showered him with and reflecting it back to the world.
Deadly silence descended at once over the table once more. Everyone was staring at them and Draco could see how Harry was starting to hyperventilate. This was not how they had planned to tell their families. Their love was something beautiful and pure and for it to be twisted into something they should be ashamed of…
Both men regarded each other calmly. Ron would never be able to imagine the horrors of growing up like that. He took a moment to be thankful for Molly and Arthur’s rather slack approach to pureblood traditions and upbringing. But it also opened up a whole new can of worms for this case.
Shaking himself, he climbed the steps and pushed through the open door with an ominous snaky knocker into the house decisively. A shudder raced down his back when he found himself in a long, gloomy hallway. Old-fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life with a soft hissing sound, shedding light on a grand entryway, complete with an imposing chandelier hovering above his head. Ornate portraits lined the dreary hallway, whispering and murmuring maliciously in the eerie silence as he passed them. It felt like he was trespassing in a mausoleum. A lavishly decorated, magnificent mausoleum that is.
Those strong hands gripping possessively onto his hip and shoulder, pulling him back onto that magnificent cock. A cock that stroked across his prostate with every other thrust, filling him up completely and reaching so very deep inside him. Those trim hips that snapped relentlessly into him and that fit so perfectly in the cradle of his spread legs.
He had heard about Number 12 Grimmauld Place, of course. Had, in fact, heard about it just a few hours ago during a rambling re-telling of imagined horrors that his best friends had predicted to happen here that very same evening.
Stepping out onto the front steps that generations of Blacks had worn down for centuries, Harry wound his fingers tightly between Draco’s. The morning sun was shining bright into his eyes, burning off the dimness and shadows still clinging to him.
"Sirius, take me to Sirius!" Pushing the last of his magic into the twist and pull of the apparition, he only had a short moment where a distant part of his mind scolded him.
If you're into True Crime podcasts, I highly recommend the episodes on the unsolved case by Morbid, Supernatural with Ashley Flowers, and Mord auf Ex :)
In good health,

Draco looked back at him, feeling offended, “I didn’t do anything, how in the name of Merlin was I seducing you?”
“Oi!”
“I know, I know, I’m not though I just let him get to me,” Leo smiled at the two girls, dropping a kiss on Lyra’s knee, “I love you two, you’re my two most precious people. My little sisters. Never forget that, please. Rae? Cari?”
“Leo?”
Vernon had learned the hard way that Harry no longer needed his wand to defend himself anymore. It was made obvious when he’d nearly broken the man’s arm after Vernon had attempted to hit him. Although it had taken several more incidents like it, to convince the man that he no longer held any power over the boy, now that he couldn’t harm him. It had been a blow to the man’s ego that his fifteen year old Nephew could overpower him if necessary.
“Is that where we are?” Draco glanced down the hallway curiously absently shifting as if to catch a glimpse of one of the creatures.
"Psst"
Lux- Light
Harry grinned widely and flopped back on the bed to watch Draco clean himself up before dressing he quickly cleaned Harry up despite his protests before reaching into the nightstand to steal all his condoms, (Seriously? Your actually taking them?) before leaning over the boy to devour his mouth one last time. “See you tonight. Hopefully with good news.”
“I just can’t…. figure you out, but I will. One day, that I can assure you of.” Pansy flinched as he stood, sweeping up her hand to place a soft ghost of a kiss along her hand, sending chills up her spine (The good kind unfortunately). “Until we meet again, I’ve unfortunately an important meeting I can’t avoid.”
"What's up Ian?" Lyra asked yawning, stretching her arms above her head.
“You don’t say?” Harry agreed scowling at him. Draco looked between the two helplessly.
Malfoy adjusted the temperature, “Heat until it turns blue.” He mumbled licking his lips slowly.
Leo scowled, “It’s only polite to LOOK at someone when they’re speaking. So look at me when I’m talking to you.”
“Not my fault Pucey thought you were a pounce,” Draco smirked, looking amused at the memory.
Draco didn’t even sit, he just grabbed the letter from the owl, gave the owl a treat and left the Great Hall for the Library. It was Saturday so he didn’t have classes. He found a secluded table and sat down to read his letter.
“Carina Aurora Black,” He seethed, Carina froze, biting her lip nervously as she turned to her cousin.
Relief filled the younger boys eyes causing the blonde to frown in concern, he caught Harry’s wrist throwing caution to the wind for a moment, “Are you okay?” He asked still keeping his voice low.
Blaise was eyeing him critically, expression carefully blank, slowly he leaned forward, “So what’s in it for me? What do I get out of helping you?”
The twins exchanged a mischievous look, “We’re going to put him in some… fun situations that will be quiet hard to ignore.”
Mrs. Evans turned stern eyes on her youngest, “Now Lily, really, I’d thought this was supposed to be a family affair. And I’d hoped we could all get all this once.”
Unwrapping the note discreetly his eyes would have bugged out in shock and disbelief if he'd had any less control of himself.
I was going to wait until tonight to post this chapter but I just can't! I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
It was Harry's turn to be stunned, only witches and wizards called on Merlin's name. "Come again?"
“He has always been a bit overdramatic,” Draco drawled carelessly, idly turn a page in his book.
Carina clung to Theo’s arm anxiously, trying to fight the tears being ignored brought on. It reminded her of her time at the Granger’s, she wouldn’t say anything though, deciding she would take the punishment she deserved.
“Draco tried to apologize, work some sort of understanding out you know,” Ron hedged frowning, his hand tightening slightly around Hermione’s as his temper rose.
Draco frowned, he didn’t see the humor in this.
A sharp bang had the furiously blushing blonde jumping in his seat and whipping around to look at his stone faced boyfriend. Leo had slammed his fist on the table and was now glowering at Julian who merely arched an unimpressed brow.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
Arriving at the Doors Ron turned to him one last time, “I really think you should tell a Professor at the very least… I won’t say anything to Hermione or Harry or anyone else… but I really think you should.”
“Makes me feel good though, at least I know you’re not just using me,” Draco sighed, a soft smile on his lips, “I guess this is what Vik meant by the bedroom phase.”
Halloween came and went without much fuss surprising Leo as the last few years it had mostly been a dark time for him. He found having his cousins near and safe brought him comfort on the dark day with the end of November nearing nearing Leo felt his stress level rising since Daphne and Tracy had joined their little group he’d had several others approach him about joining his cause, most proved untrustworthy or they were merely looking to join the ‘cool kids’ or ‘popular group’.
“You know why you’re here Draco,” The severe man drawled, raising an inky black brow.
Draco had just sat down to eat, when an unfamiliar black eagle owl swooped down and dropped an envelope on his empty plate, and stared right at him from it place next to his goblet. Draco stared at the owl for a moment before picking up the envelope. He raised an eyebrow when he didn’t see any sign as to who its sender could be. He eyed the owl distrustfully for a moment before shrugging and ripping open the envelope.
Harry smirked rolling his hips lightly, “Why, does it appeal to your dominant possessive side?”
Draco glared at the indignity of being told he couldn’t have Potter, "Some wands are flexible Blaise you only need to be gentle in bending them so as not to break them."
Harry wiped the sweat from his brow, as he took a break from repairing the fence, around the backyard. Petunia seemed to remember his previous punishment and was back to being petty, though not so much a Bitch anymore. She still would sit down to tea with him every once in a while to talk about his Mum and Aunt. She had even asked to meet Carina and Lyra when they found her. Vernon had grumbled moodily at the notion that more freaks would be running around in his house while Dudley had whimpered piteously.
"A Ravenclaw?" He couldn't believe how accurate knowledge of his world was, though if she was telling the truth earlier then she probably knew all this from her own parents.
Millicent smirked at Carina, "Well I'll be, little miss perfect has a crush on a snake?"
Carina nodded, forcing a smile, "We know you would have taken us in if you could have."
Carina nodded slightly, a more confident smile curling her lips this time.
"Bloody hell do you always shower with the curtain open Malfoy?"
“I know,” Harry gasped, lidded jade eyes staring into passionate mercury orbs.
Draco smirked nipping at his neck, “I think I have the right to call you whatever I want right now baby, I have you in the palm of my hand.”
Draco’s brows pinched in annoyance, “Are kidding me? You can’t just-”
Draco shifted awkwardly glancing at Sirius who seemed to have had the same thought and looked just as embarrassed.
Julian and Theo chuckled, pleasantly surprised by the calm and relaxed attitude of their leader/friend.
Dumbledore stepped forward, the twinkle in his eye flashing a mile a minute, he was plotting "I've always called you Harry you never asked if it was your first name."
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
“Malfoy,” Carina barked slapping a book down on the table sharply as she sat down across from him. She wasn’t about to beat around the bush, not if her family was involved. If Malfoy knew something, he was going to tell them.
Draco was not happy.
“I managed to catch a student from Ravenclaw willing to wait for Mikhail but your Slytherin’s aren’t to friendly so…” Orion frowned apologetically.
“Before,” Carina corrected, summoning a tea set and pouring drinks, offering it around “After the Devil’s Snare.”
Percy dropped into the nearest chair, shooting the twins a disparaging look when he had to dig a muggle whoopee cushion out from under himself, pointedly ignoring their weak snickers of amusement. “I can,… it makes quite a bit of sense actually. Not long ago, when I was interning in the legal department of the department of birth and registration, I was interning with fathers old friend Ferguson Togglebuff… I came across a few discrepancies I found… odd. For example a file had been wiped completely clean, with nothing on it. Another had pages missing, I suspected a theft or something, so I mentioned it to Ferg, he asked if I’d looked at anything from Mum’s side and of course I hadn’t. Instead of reporting it as I thought he might, he brushed it off and sent me home on a ‘good days work’ said I’d been working too hard anyway. I was transferred to another department the next day.”
"Lunch," he grunted as if it were obvious, "then potions."
Finally after what seemed like an eternity later Harry told him in a trembling voice to move. Draco groaned in gratitude, “I swear I’ve never felt anything tighter love.”
Sirius ran a hand across his face feeling years older. Regulus had been his best friend before James. They'd caused all sorts of havoc around the house much to their Mothers displeasure. Until Sirius went to Hogwarts then Reggie had changed. Or so Sirius had thought. No Reggie had grown up. Because Sirius wouldn't. It was his fault Mother had focus on Reggie, to punish Sirius.
Harry stepped closer looking him dead in the eye, “Get. Stuffed. Fat Ass.”
Dumbledore had requested a specific book and Sirius and Remus were busy looking for it. The only problem was that it was in Reggie's room. Now where in Regulus' room was the question.
Lyra bristled, narrowing her eyes sharply, “well then your memory must be slipping.”
Theo shook his head, looking even more panicked then before, “Nothing! Absolutely nothing! I’m just not interested in dating right now. It’s got nothing to do with Carina.”
Julian leaned heavily against the wall, smirking arrogantly at the blushing girls. He flicked his hair out of his eyes, and shrugged one of his shoulders.
A voice from behind scoffed, "Well I think it's horrible."
Harry was about to answer when a sharp tapping sound interrupted. Harry and Draco looked over at the door in shock, faces paling drastically.
Draco frowned slightly at the orange glowing ambers of a cigarette, preceding the slow cloud of smoke. “I am aware of that, and you are?”
Tracy and Daphne nodded firmly, expressions nervous, “Right.”
“What? We’ve done it plenty of times before,” Oops foot-in-mouth.
“For a price of course.”
“Theo,” Carina hissed, whipping around to look at her boyfriend.
Draco obviously got the message, but instead of releasing him, he grabbed Harry’s ass hoisting him up easily to wrap his legs around Draco’s waist and carried him into the room.  He moved blindly toward the bed not tripping or stumbling once as he easily maneuvered his way through the messy room.
Blaise chuckled lowly, a smooth masculine sound that made Draco shiver pleasantly. “So you’re still after Potter?”
Malfoy chuckled coldly, “We don’t have Minions, or Bodyguard’s Parkinson. But we’re always looking for worthy Business associates, connections Parkinson it’s all about connections.”
Tracy looked up at him, eyes shining hopefully for the first time in days.
Leo hummed raising a finger to his lips silently. They walked in silence for a few moments and Draco felt it. The peace, the serenity it was beautiful, amazing, it was… magical. It was perfect. His breath hitched as Leo dipped his head capturing Draco’s lips in a sweet kiss, before pulling away and continuing down the road as if nothing happened.
Lyra blinked in surprise before shifting uncomfortably, “I need to learn Italian, what the bloody hell’s a Tesoro?” She mumbled shaking her head. She’d bet it was an insult, bloody bastard, running into her like that.
Dumbledore paced his office an angry scowl etched into his face, “How could things have gotten this out of hand Fawkes? The boys slipped through my fingers.”
“POTTER!” a familiar voice snarled. Leo frowned at the angry tone and huffed in annoyance before turning to respond scathingly.
“Hey mate, it’s Dean! Ron and Hermione are here aswell,” “HI HARRY!”
Carina finally moved back to her chair, wiping stray tears from her eyes, looking determined, "Do either of you have any ideas?"
Draco looked surprised again, “You’re a virgin?”
“I can’t believe this,” Charlie sighed, clutching at his chest as if that could alleviate some of the ache.
Julian watched her for a second before shaking his head to clear it, bad thoughts, these girls were going to kill him.
“Do you really want me to stop?” Leo demanded gruffly.
Lyra tilted her head thoughtfully, “Is that the symbol you were talking about at the end of the Summer?”
Sirius tilted his head in agreement before sweeping his arms out, “Well come on then, let’s not let the cold in, yes?”
“AH YES HARDER PLEASE!”
Daphne nodded, smiling shyly, “It’s my own little twist on the spell a notice me not tied in for extra precaution.”
Harry looked up curiously the blonde had a pleased grin on his face.
Draco did see Leo before winter break, four days after the ‘Corridor Incident’, as Draco called it. He was walking back to the Dormitory, when Leo swept him away, leaving his friends behind. Blaise merely raised an amused brow (The Bastard), dragging a bemused Pansy away.
Draco nodded shortly, “You’re a fan of ‘Dark Angel’?” the Blonde inquired skeptically.
Leo ground his teeth eyes passing like a sharp blade over his family, “Would anyone
The raven whipped around skidding to a halt before him. Conflicting emotions warred in his eyes before distant voices interrupted, prompting the Raven haired boy in to action. Leo snatched his wrist yanking him behind a tapestry into a small alcove. The spot was so small that the blonde was literally dragged to his knees before being pulled in.
“Huh,” Seamus mused, flopping back on Harry’s bed with his hands tucked under his head.
Mikhail rolled his eyes as Ginny, Seamus, and Dean roared with laughter and Ron turned green. “Knock it off Rion. You’re being a menace and the school year hasn’t even started yet.” The boy scolded.
He rolled his eyes, “My name is Draco Malfoy.”
He reached his hand under the small arch Harry made in his pain rubbing circles into his lower back to try to relax him.
Lyra huffed doing her best to mask her concern.
If anyone reading this has read it on my FF.net Account you should know I am making changes as I'm posting chapters! Please let me know what you think. Reviews inspire me to Write!
“Gryffindor!” The Hat shouted loudly, Harry sat in stunned silence for a moment before jumping up and cheering loudly with the rest of his table.
“We aren’t here to ask questions Malfoy, we’re here to insist you tell us what you obviously know. You know why Leo’s acting funny so tell us.” Theo demanded coolly, narrowing his eyes at the blonde.
"Wow so you all found out you weren't who you thought you were too?" Lyra asked shocked, this was too weird, what sort of dysfunctional Family did she come from?
Mikhail chuckled at the mildly curious expression on the ravens face, Draco sure picked a sweet one, “Yes, Vik asked her to marry him, and yes she said yes. They recently welcomed a beautiful little boy into their family.”
Draco stiffened at the declaration.
The boy frowned slightly before nodding once in acceptance. "Leo," he returned, before sweeping past unintentionally giving him the perfect chance to check out the rest of him.
SBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRLSBRL
“So?” Harry asked when it seemed like Draco wasn’t going to elaborate.
"Well I could've told you that," Harry deadpanned, did they think he was stupid?
The Italian shifted slightly cocky smirk replaced by a guarded frown. The two stared each other down before Draco raised a brow and offered the challenge, “Draco Malfoy, and I guess you could say I’m not my parent’s biggest fan.”
The boy was so caught up he didn't notice someone come in. It was the Prefects' bath after all. He moaned again ignoring his senses telling him someone was watching him.
“Your Mother…” He deflated rubbing a tired hand over his forehead, “I
“Do you want to know why I’m ACTUALLY angry Carina,” he asked mockingly, shoving her away from him, “I’m PISSED off because Malfoy won’t speak to me. Why? Because after I made an ass of myself and took off, Smith came running back and wouldn’t let him go back to his Common room until Malfoy agreed to be his boyfriend!”
Orion smiled saucily, “Oh you have no idea… but what’s in it for me if I share?”
“Shut up,” Draco ordered holding Harry’s legs firmly in the air by the backs of his knees.
"By the way Harry, how are your other cousins?" She asked touching his arm lightly to get his attention.
Leo stepped forward, "Me. My birth name is Leo Harry-James Potter, you kept that from me."
The red head shot him a sharp look that had Orion and Mikhail raising a brow at the blonde obviously even more suspicious.
Harry nodded but still looked forlorn, so Jonathan looked at Lily, “You wouldn’t be cross with me if I gave him his present now would you?”
“Dick!” Lyra snapped whacking him in the head with his book, but that sincere, yet playful smile of hers was once again aimed at him. A bloke could only dream.
Draco laced his other hand with one of Harry’s gripping the sheets tightly as he slowly moved his hand.
Fleur Delacour looked up at his with trepidation, “I ‘ope evryzing ez alrigt, no?”
“Do you not want to date me?” he blurted out thoughtlessly, Draco yanked the boxers back out of his hands frowning in confusion and disbelief.
Fred and George Weasley may have been ‘Pranksters’, ‘Masters of Mischief’, and ‘Creators of Chaos’, but that didn’t mean they couldn’t be serious when they needed to be. Quite the contrary, at the moment they were sitting in the commons going over everything they’d heard their Mother and littler brother… er ‘Cousin’ said. That was the kicker though wasn’t it. Little Ronnie was their Cousin? Molly had said Fabian and Gideon never had kids. So she lied? What else had she lied about then? Fred and George glanced over where ‘Julian’ was lounging by the fire. Glancing at each other they nodded before approaching.
“Nuh uh,” Harry gasped, panting as he watched Draco sit up and frown at him.
Julian shook his head moving to rub comforting circles on his friends back, “She’s been yelled at enough.” He was surprised at Lyra’s quick tempered behavior. She was usually a lot more understanding and forgiving when it came to her Twin. Whatever happened earlier was affecting her judgment now, and that made him nervous.
"I'm sorry."
“Miss Granger!” Professor McGonagall protested in horror, interrupting her before she could finish.
Adrian and Blaise glanced at each other curiously and the absent drawl. Before seeming to ignore it, Adrian turned to address Blaise, “So…?”
I'll have it up Saturday, I want to give myself time to go over it a bit and make absolutely sure it does this story justice, so please stay tuned!
Leo nodded reaching for his cauldron and moving to light then adjust the flame.
Malfoy nodded again breaking off bits to add so they wouldn’t add too much. The smile was almost back when red bubbles began mixing with the pink until the whole potion was a bright red.
“Are you going to want to test it tomorrow or did you want me too?” Malfoy asked absently, as he began clearing up their mess.
“Tesoro(5)”
"Molly's my Aunt Leo." Ron looked pained, he felt so betrayed, it explained so much.
Domina- Lady
Ron sighed looking bored with the situation already, "So what you're a pureblood and now you’re changing your name to fit the Knut?"
“See you tonight on our date love,” Smith breathed against his cheek, before turning with a chuckle and attempting to strut out of the library. Draco personally thought he looked like a hapless drunken house elf.
“Master is being too kind again,” Tinsel scolded lightly, wiping her eyes on the silk fabric she wore as clothes. Draco couldn’t convince her to wear anything else so he’d made sure she had two and ordered her to wash whichever one she wore that day. So she was always clean and well taken care of. Not that he’d explained it that way, as she would have a fit if she knew Draco was trying to take care of her.
“Mikhail,Pusni ya!” Draco barked expression stern, at the same time Orion surged to her feet.
Draco sat in the tub relaxing when he heard the door open. He turned to see Leo casting a spell on the door. Draco hesitated before turning back around to relax. He heard Leo sigh before coming closer there was a pause then the sound of quickly retreating footsteps before the sound of soft cursing.
“They’d get over it, and did you not hear me earlier, my godfather is Sirius Black. He came from a family just as Dark and politically powerful, my Parents and Grandparents couldn’t love him more. My Uncle Remus is a werewolf and again my family couldn’t love him more. My Grandfather petitioned for Werewolf rights after finding out he couldn’t hold a job because of what he was. They won’t care, they may not understand at first but they’d accept you with time.” Harry smiled at the look on the blondes face, he looked floored that Harry was fighting so hard.
“I need time to calm down, don’t speak to me before then,” Leo demanded, before storming out passed the frozen and speechless Slytherin girls of their group.
The almost Walrus like man shifted mustache twitching anxiously before seemingly deciding Draco wasn’t a threat. So he repeated himself.
“You really plan on killing the old man…” Blaise leaned forward in his chair his full attention returned to Leo. He hadn’t really believed Nott and Black, now it seemed that he had been mistaken.
Carina slid to the floor next to him wrapping her arms around his neck in a tight hug, “We’re worried Lee, this stress is going to kill you.”
Malfoy tilted his head curiously searching Leo’s face carefully before nodding, “Alright, you’re absolutely right.” He set down his quill and moved his notebook off to the side before turning to look Leo straight in the face, “You were saying?”
Petunia grabbed his hand, and dragged him into the living room and forced him (He had to obey) into the seat beside her. She ignored Vernon and Dudley who stood in the doorway looking as if they were going through something similar to Harry in their own minds.
Draco groaned, burying his face in Harry’s neck as he clutched Harry’s thighs roughly. Harry flexed the muscles in his thigh lightly before attempting to wrap them around Draco’s waist. Draco pushed them away before grabbing Harry’s hips dragging them closer to his, “Stop.”
Draco yelped stepping back, "Potter? I'm starkers."
Draco pulled his hand from his hair pinning it to the bed next to his head as he abandoned his mouth and trailed kisses along his cheek and jaw to his ear. Harry shivered and moaned as Draco’s tongue did something wicked to the spot behind his ear. “You seem to have done this before.” He gasped out. Draco grunted in amusement.
“I want to see,” Draco repeated seriously, “I’m telling you to touch yourself.”
Julian sighed as he loosened his already loose tie a bit more, his casually worn uniform showing his clear disregard for the Headmasters rules, as he strolled lazily down the hall to lunch. The twins matched down to the button if Leo and Julian hadn’t known the girls as they did they’d have to really look for to figure out which twin was which. Both girls wore their shirts out and ties loose, mid-thigh length plaid skirts in Gryffindor colors with black kitten heels and sheer knee high socks. Their piercings removed as was school policy during class hours. Leo had opted out of his school robes and rolled the sleeves of his school shirt to his elbows, leaving his shirt out with his tie hanging loose and a few buttons undone. The four had been called out plenty of times but the rules only said they had to wear the uniform not how they had to wear it.
Draco’s eyebrows shot to his hairline in surprise, well wasn’t this interesting, he responded casually as a slow smirk curled his own lips, “And you go in pieces, asshole…”
Leo walked down the corridor returning from the bathroom when something soft ran into his chest. Reflex kicking in he reached out and grabbed the person to steady them. 'Malfoy'?
“Draco,” Harry scolded, smacking his chest.
The young man raised both brows in surprise, "Oh so that's how you got in. Thought for a moment I'd have to call campus security."
“Yeah Har, we’re just getting to know each other,” Chuckie teased, an amused glint in his blue-green eyes.
The Dwarf prodded at the Crups as the carpet once again unraveled forming steps for the Crups decent from the Sleigh. Climbing down with a huff and batting the carpet out of his way with his Staff the Dwarf flipped the clasp open and held the door open for them. Draco and the others shrugged of the fur blankets ignoring the yowled complaints and quickly exited the sleigh Nott stumbling slightly as the Sphinx blanket clung to his ankle.
"Draco…honey," Pansy began tentatively, "This… obsession is a bit unnerving for many of the other Slytherins, and I think maybe you should ease off a bit."
Mikhail released her roughly with a sneer.
Draco blinked, realizing only now the situation he’d found himself in. He’d fallen asleep in his years common room and just had a wet dream about Potter shagging him silly in the bath. And he wasn’t even the top, "Oh hell no!"
“Julian,” Fred began, looking down at the boy cautiously.
Lyra shivered, from the breeze, castles were breezy! She glanced over her shoulder folding her arms over her chest and scowling at him. His dark eyes strayed down her body sleek black brow lifting casually.
Harry smacked his chest sharply, “Draco! Don’t tell him that!”
Draco was very pleased with how vocal Harry was it made the whole experience that much more satisfying. Draco buried his nose in Harry’s dark curls swallowing around the boys length ignored the boys tugs as he screamed in pleasure and tried to pull him of, instead he moaned sending vibrations through the length in his mouth. Harry screamed throwing his head back and arching his back as he exploded down Draco’s throat.
Blaise dug his fingers in Harder, “Tell. Me.”
Sirius nodded grimly, "We'll go to Uncle Alphard's estate. The place is unplottable."
Draco grinned slyly, “So you got any embarrassing stories about him I should know about?”
Sirius smiled sadly and led the boys over to the couch, “Come on kiddo, James’ gonna be just fine, you heard your mum, Lil would never lie to you about this sort of thing.”
“That wasn’t a question,” Draco noted looking up at them, through his lashes, with a look of mild interest.
Orion smiled silkily as she primly ate a bit of the fruit she’d been cutting into small cubes. The smile the two shared had been chilling and the watching Slytherins were now eyeing the two uneasily.
“What are we going to do now,” Percy asked looking up at Bill, he was meant to be the next Head of House Weasley. “Should we say something?”
Draco froze as he stepped into their Dorm looking around in surprise, ‘are those stairs?’
Draco very much doubted that, not that he minded in that moment as Leo pressed him firmly into the couch attacking him neck with hot open mouthed kisses. Merlin the boy was basically making love to his neck!
“So why’d you bring me here?” Draco asked trying to decide how the raven’s admission made him feel. He was confused for one, if Leo hadn’t shared the clearing with his family, why would he share it with him? He wanted to share this place with Draco? But it also made him feel special in a way that confused him even more.
Harry finally caught the Head board and managed to use it as leverage to meet Draco’s thrusts.
Hermione’s chin trembled as she lost her battle against her tears. The sound of her door opening startled her, causing her to wipe her face hurriedly, “Mum?” she turned to see her mother unloading clothes into her dresser  and closet. Hermione watched her quietly for a few minutes before looking back at her book and biting her lip hesitantly, “Mum?”
The Potions Master sneered watching the red head whip around, and quickly exit the Medical Wing, “Mr. Malfoy, what on
"Of course boss," Theo smirked, he just wanted to be part of the group that took him down.
do that.
Harry blinked owlishly, he’d just basically threatened her, and now she liked him?... She was definitely related to Sirius. This was going to be a long year.
Harry grunted impatiently reaching back and Shoving against Draco’s chest. Draco overbalanced, slipping out with a wet sucking sound, falling onto his back in surprise. Harry quickly straddled his waist before pausing uncertainty clear on his face.
He was being stalked.
Leo hummed rolling his head to look at Draco, “It was my Father’s wedding ring… My Mother’s was Lost in the fire the Night Voldemort killed them, But apparently my Father lost his before they went into hiding. Lost it at Sirius’ apartment and never found it, Remus found it when he was cleaning the place out after he was falsely accused of betraying them.”
xXxXxXx
“Davis,” Theo supplied never taking his eyes off his girlfriend who was ignoring the whole situation as she stared into his eyes while playing with his hair, flawlessly playing the part of the ‘happy couple in the honeymoon phase’ they’d decided if they played up the sappy sweet couple, that may make the teachers or student spies to uncomfortable to spy on them while they passed information to each other. The two were the main source of communication between the two houses when Dumbledore was getting to nosey.
Gagging at the foul stench of the other boys’ breath, Draco used his school robes to scrub at the disgusting boy’s slimy residue “Not your love.”
“Oh please, Draco no, American slang it’s so crass,” Orion complained wrinkling her nose at him.
Smiling shyly she wrapped her arms around him in a hug, “Uncle Sirius… that sounds good.”
"Potter!"
“Rion… Orion’s here as well?” Draco almost gapped as the familiar blonde rounded their dark hair friend the smirk at him impishly.
Hermione turned to give Harry a bright happy smile. He caught her hand in his bringing it to his lips to kiss affectionately as he smiled. His cousin. His Family.
"How," Remus asked insistently, trying to get him to think, as he waved his wand to banish the garments.
Draco did his best to comply, but his lack of sleep that morning was quickly catching up with him. He nearly jumped when Harry grabbed his wrist looking back at him. Cheeks flushed, and eyes glassy with pleasure.
Harry blinked and looked around, before noticing the rustling in the bush next to him. … Seriously?
The others flinched avoiding his gaze, they knew Leo wasn’t joking, they knew they’d strayed from the plan in favor of the distraction.
Leo scoffed and walked around the big tub so he could look in Draco’s face, “That’s not going to happen Malfoy.”
Orion chuckled raising a perfectly groomed brow at him, “And you think he likes the idea of you being holed up in this tower without him with dozens of male
“Then how?” Draco was staring at Leo in wonder. How had this boy, the same age as him, found a room lost centuries ago?
Leo growled, dropping one of his legs to reach between them and fumble with his jean the blonde shivered with tangled nervous at the unusually loud sound of the ravens zipper being undone, he released a cry of protest as his trousers and pants were tugged down exposing his bum to the cool night air.
Julian was of course not paying attention.
Draco raised a brow at the put-upon frown the Italian shot him, before smirking, “Right, so you’re not just trying to keep your dirty little secret a secret.” He mocked with a teasing grin, filing the ‘we’ away for later questions.
Draco smirked slightly as he swallowed it all sucking or Harry’s rapidly softening member lightly cleaning him up as he pulled off.
Lyra hadn’t changed too much, or so she claimed. She still wore her hair long, at the moment it was pulled in a high ponytail. Her makeup like her sisters was light and natural. Unlike her sister Lyra had decided to get ad industrial in her left ear and pierce her navel and her tongue. Sirius and Leo had been less than thrilled when they’d been told. Another difference with the twins was that Lyra wore her uniform a little more casually. She still wore a mid-thigh length skirt and a fitted shirt. But she let her tie (Black until her sorting) hang loose, and wore gray flat knee high boots. She had also found one of her father’s old gray cashmere vests and tailored it to her liking. It hung loosely on her slender frame and the two remaining buttons met just below her navel.
“Leo what the HELL!” Sirius barked, looking up at the raven accusingly, as if instinctively knowing the boy had planted the blanket.
“You don’t want to double check your work?” The old man taunted, as he reached for the scroll. On the other side of the room Orion’s quill snapped in her hand, causing the girl to grumpily dig through her bag for another while shooting daggers at the man with her eyes.
Harry breathed deep for a few moments before reiterating, “My Aunt, Uncle, and Cousin are coming to celebrate my Birthday… Grandma Isabel insisted, so now they’re coming over.”
Draco nodded awkwardly, that was kind of a sad story.
Blaise scowled, rolling his eyes again, they were gonna get stuck one of these days, “You’re such a Drama Queen Draco.”
Adrian scratched his jaw idly, “You’re a frightening Man, when you’re on a mission.”
“I won’t let anything happen to him.” Harry promised, halting his friend’s defensive protests, “Draco means the world to me… if anything were to happen to him because of me I’d never forgive myself. I won’t lie and say I’m perfect. I’m impatient, selfish, and have the world’s shortest attention span. But Draco doesn’t care, he’s attentive, sweet, and far more than anything I deserve in my life. Honestly I still wake up asking myself if this is all real, but as I said before, I’m selfish. I’m not willing to let him go, so if anyone tries to take him from me, or separate us I can promise you it won’t end well for that person or persons.”
“Nixie and Pipsy is be taking you now?” The first elf approached him cautiously holding out a hand. Draco watched warily as Blaise and Pansy calmly allowed the other elf to grabbing one of their hands and disappeared with it.
"How dare you," Molly started to march forward, only for Dumbledore to hold her back, murmuring to her softly. Obviously he didn’t want to much of a scene, not with all these witnesses.
female students who’d give every last knut they had to take a tumble in your sheets?”
Harry’s eyes widened an embarrassed flush painting his cheeks. He opened his mouth to respond when a blast of water soaked them both to the bone. Draco swore loudly and colorfully as he rounded on their assailant, “Dammit Rion!”
“Naturally,” he grit out frostily, the other boy was beginning to grate on his nerves.
Harry smirked, “I’m not worried, three Aurors in the family remember.”
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
Blaise and Adrian traded exhausted frowns, wondering how they’d found themselves in this mess.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sirius and Remus gave him blank looks obviously not buying it.
Orion Black… the boy was friends with Reggie’s kid. He hadn’t seen his younger brother in a little over eleven years, Blonde hair and Brown eye’s flashed across his mind, the kid had been good looking. Maybe he should give Reggie a fire call, they had made up hadn’t they. Maybe Reggie could tell him a bit about this Malfoy boy as well.
“Theo!” Carina laughed, straddling his lap and finally catching his arms to pin down, though it was clear by his firm grip on her hips that he’d let her win. She smiled adoringly down at the one boy who seemed to love her despite the shattered mess he’d found her in, “I love you too.”
He heard the clatter of a plate from downstairs and nearly groaned. Though Vernon couldn’t control him anymore Petunia could as a member of his family by blood his magic bound him into obedience, muggle or not his magic forced him to comply with her wishes unless they caused him physical harm.
A few unfamiliar teens stood uncertainly in the doorway, as if he might send them away. Draco adjusted Harry in his lap and gestured to the empty seats around them, “Please.”
“Fuck.”
Leo blinked in surprise not knowing how to respond. He was feeling completely out of sorts, he had no idea how to handle this Malfoy.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Sirius knows better than to mess with our dates, he knows I’d get him for it.”
Carina visibly deflated. A sad look on her face, "Right… Right, sorry I guess it's like a dream come true almost. I have a family that will have noticed me even if I’m not perfect."
“Padfoot?”
Leo frowned, “Tell the twins, Nott, and Bulstrode, to be on the landing outside the Great Hall at five tonight.”
“I’ll tell him you said Hello,” Draco returned coolly, before smiling apologetically at Hermione, when his back was turned. After his first Detention for baiting their Defense teacher last week he’d promised her he’d try and behave himself.
“Mr Malfoy, do you know why I’m hard on you and your peers?” The man asked pointedly after waving his wand and allowing the doors to slam shut on Blaise and Adrian’s confused faces. Draco felt tension shoot up his spine. This wasn’t looking good.
“Would you believe me if I said it was debating between Gryffindor and Slytherin. It argued both points, then made me give a detailed reason for why I should be a Slytherin. I felt like I was talking to a more reasonable version of my Father, it was… Odd.” Draco decided before placing a soft kiss below Harry’s ear.
Draco pulled one of Harry’s legs down, settling Harry’s foot on his shoulder and squeezing his ankle warning him not to try and push him away.
Carina released her boyfriend in order to latch onto her friend. Theo wasn’t offended. He knew Carina needed the reassurance that Julian wasn’t angry with her as well.
“Draco have you ever had a Boyfriend… or a Girlfriend for that matter?” Harry asked slowly, a small smile flirting with the corner of his mouth.
Leo hummed at his breathless answer leaning in closer until nearly every line of their bodies were pressed together and he began sucking harshly at the base of his neck connecting to his shoulder. Draco couldn’t fight the loud groan he released, panting loudly as he gripped Leo’s waist tightly.
Draco spun around slipping slightly, "Potter?"
Harry nodded sheepishly and did his best to pay attention to the First years sorting ceremony. Finally after what seemed an eternity, Orion’s name was called. Students whispered loudly to each other as the beautiful girl sat on the stool and smiled at Professor McGonagall expectantly.
“My apologies,” Draco drawled, raising an eyebrow, seeming to calm slightly. He looked from Julian to the common room entrance behind him, frowning suspiciously. Julian examined his nails nonchalantly, internally smirking as he saw the curiosity burning in the Slytherin Princes eyes. Finally Draco seemed to cave.
Petunia nodded with a soft smile, "They were fraternal twins. Though Violet was much like Lily only worse, she never left the Library, I believe she was in Ravenclaw."
A mischievous little grin curled Carina’s lips as she looked over her cousin, "You know what this means right?"
Harry winced at the slight burn as Draco slowly push the first finger in, Harry shifted wanting to get this over with.
Leo cast a grim look at the two. They bowed their heads shamefully, taking their seats at the table. Leo gestured for the scattered group to do the same.
“Well find an interest because as of now, you’re dating. End of discussion.” Leo snapped, slamming into his fist onto the table to emphasis his point.
DMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDM DMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDM DMDMDMDMDMDMDMDM DMDMDMDMDMDMDMDM
Blaise shrugged absently warning him to watch his step. “The walls are beginning to crumble so don’t trip Professor Snape claims he’s told the Headmaster, who’s called for Repair Wizards. Merlin knows that’ll never happen they’ve only had six months to take care of it now.”
“I Plan on crushing every last shred of dignity he has beneath my boot. Every little scrap of pride and honor that he holds near will be snuffed out. He’s going to feel every loss like a knife to the gut. And when he’s broken and bleeding at my feet, I’ll be waiting there to twist it… No, Dumbledore won’t die until im finished with him.”
“We can talk in our rooms,” Fred decided relaxing slightly, he nodded at his twin before leading them both up to the Seventh year dorms.
Folding his hands on his stomach, Dumbledore feigned a look of surprise, “Are you now? It was widely believed Ms. Evans was a Muggleborn, are you implying she was a Pureblood? How curious, sadly my boy I don’t concern myself with ones blood status, I find it often leads to unnecessary prejudice.”
“I promise you that won’t bother me,” He smiled warily, best to say this now, “I’m not my parents’ biggest fan either. If anything I’d say I probably resent them just as much, if not more, than everyone else. I’m not blood prejudice and I think their arrogant bastards for thinking they’re any better than any other family. And their feud with your family is ridiculous, just because Cassiopeia Malfoy fell in love with Jeremiah Weasley over a century ago? That’s got nothing to do with us and I refuse to be bothered by it. They were in love, we should let the matter rest.”
Harry flushed again, hating how easily he seemed to be doing that today, but did as he was told. Draco quickly followed him and immediately went to work on preparing him. Harry jerked at the cold finger that was forced into him but did his best to ignore it and relax. Before he knew it he was groaning and doing his best to move with Draco’s fingers.
Tracy sat immediately and stiffly.
ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ ⱧⱣ
“Oh,” Leo scoffed dropping his head onto the blondes shoulder weakly, “Oh he says. Merlin it’s not like you haven’t seen a House elf before. Just sit still.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, “I wasn’t, I heard what you were saying.”
Leo nodded, seemingly placated, “Good, I leave her in your hands then, just don’t hog her, she’s still my cousin.”
Harry Potter seemed like your average fifteen year old boy. He lived with his mum and dad, did his homework, did his chores, argued with his parents about little things, hung out with friends, and just acted like a regular teenager. There was only one small difference. Harry Potter was a Wizard.
Draco gripped his hips tightly guiding his movements as Harry slowly lifted himself, experimenting with the new position.
“Merlin’s Balls Harry, are you trying to kill me?” Draco joked weakly to the smaller boy. Harry smiled at him sheepishly.
Draco rubbed his back soothingly, “A cupboard huh?” he murmured lowly. He’d regretted not hitting the man the moment he’d heard. He’d regretted not hitting his Son when he’d heard about Harry’s arm.
"Damn it now I'm horny, bloody hell." Draco stalked out of his sitting room muttering obscenities under his breath, unaware of his two friends' silent amusement.
Blaise and Adrian were now looking at him as if he were mad, as were several Slytherins who saw them coming.
Draco groaned rolling his neck, “Narcissa doesn’t approve of some of the things they’re teaching at Drumstrang, she thinks they’re making me too… rebellious. They’re looking to transfer me to another school.”
“Le-” Draco began before he was unceremoniously shoved into a wall, Leo’s mouth forcing his open for exploration.
Tracy flushed in humiliation as students around the muffled their laughter, “Please, just a moment of your time.” She pleaded eyes full of desperation.
Rolling his eyes Julian stood, “I was joking, will the commons suffice or should we adjourn to somewhere more private?”
Everyone laughed, lounging languidly for a few moments before deciding it was time to head up to the common room for the night.
Tracy smirked slightly studying her cards casually, “Bit defensive aren’t you?”
Draco looked up at him panicked, “Hide me!!” he panted breathlessly.
“Harry,” Lily called from down one of the halls, Harry did an about face and rushed toward his Mother, hugging her tightly, “MUM!”
Chuckie scoffed, “Ignore him, he’s a petty little bitch. He’s not fond of Harry because Harry ‘ruined’ coming out for him. Apparently he had this elaborate overly dramatic ‘I’m Gay speech’ planned and Harry beat him to it. The Drama Queens just being a vindictive little Bitch.”
Harry braced himself for the worst ripping of the end of the envelope and pulling the letter out. His eyes skimmed the words quickly and he immediately felt his heart sink into his stomach. Crumbling the letter in his hands Harry dropped his face in his hands and groaned, “He’s pissed, he’s coming in three days, he wants to talk to us.”
Leo smiled reaching up to cradle the back of Draco’s neck, pulling him into a slow but affectionate kiss.
Draco entered the room looking around warily at the metal muggle contraptions. What were these things? They sort of resembled the Muggle Vekills he learned about in Muggle Studies but he wasn’t sure, some of them only had two wheels.
Fred and George looked at each other again silently communicating, “Why should we believe you?”
Lyra smiled, before looking thoughtful, "I've got an idea. Since we’re all basically changing our names back to what they were before we were separated. Why don't we take this opportunity to change ourselves, you know show the world who we really are, and not who they think we are."
Orion chuckled softly, “It’s ok Harry, Draco didn’t exactly tell us about you either, hasn’t really talked to us much lately either. We actually found out he was switching school’s from my Uncle.”
The two men crawled out of the bush looking embarrassed. Giving the boy a pointed look, that clearly told him, to NOT ask. He asked anyway.
Millie smiled softly, “I’ve nothing to do I’d be happy to join you.”
“This says she’s been,” George began this time.
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
The three stared blankly at him for a moment before busting out laughing. Carina ‘unknowingly’ flinging mashed potatoes in Parvati’s face as she pounded her fist on the table.
“Draco,” The blonde glanced up when Adrian tapped his shoulder, everyone was packing their bags signaling the end of class. “Bell rang, time to go.”
“Why?” Harry balked in surprise. Didn’t Draco just say he found him attractive? Had he misunderstood?
“Hmm, how did two harmless little things like you wind up in Slytherin,” Millie mused softly, not really sounding cruel, merely curious.
Ron Weasley was many things.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other as if truly seeing each other for the first time, Harry found his voice first, "Well,” he cleared his throat trying to hide the overwhelming emotions he was feeling, “let's go look for her, where do we start?"
“To better control you, if you were a pureblood the other pureblood's would have protested your staying with 'muggles'." Remus explained solemnly.
The three young men sat on the comfortable couch eyeing each other in a guarded silence.
Draco returned the gesture mockingly, “I wonder.” Kicking his feet confidently up onto the man’s desk.
“Did I hear my name?”
Carina huffed looking unimpressed. She released Nott to cross her arms over her chest, turning to glare reproachfully at her friend, “Keep your beast away from my ‘Jimmy Choos’ I’m warning you Julian those shoes are expensive!” She stomped her foot for emphasis.
“Dark?” Draco, and surprisingly Blaise, asked in disbelief. Though Zabini’s expression was more guarded then curious, Draco tilted his head like a fascinated child leaning forward in his chair beside Blaise. Leo was seated at the opposite end of the Table from the head with his back to the door, subtly showing his trust in the two intruders.
“His own damned fault, Father always said he was a Daft fool.” Draco shrugged carelessly, though he did miss his late Uncle, the man had brought it on himself when he went against Lady Elena’s advice and proceeded unguarded on a deal. Lady Elena was devastated. She’d really loved Draco’s Uncle.
“You’ll learn, you are mine now, no going back.” Draco murmured seriously as he rocked Harry’s hips lightly with his own. Harry groaned breathlessly feeling his stomach clench as small shocks of pleasure sparked through his body.
“Scream my name,” Draco growled into his ear breathlessly.
Carina shot Lyra a nasty look, but didn’t dare say anything that might put her in a deeper pit with Leo. Theo shifted, rubbing his neck uncomfortably.
Malfoy handed the book over to Madam Pince to check it out and promptly walked out of the library after he got it back.
Petunia Dursley, Lily’s sister, had a long thin neck, and a very horse-like face. The blonde was hard pressed to find any indication that the ghastly looking woman was related to the beautiful woman that was Lily Ann Potter.
"What the bleeding hell was that you barmy twat?" Leo hissed, anger burning in his chest like fiendfyre.
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
Draco made a small noise of protest, if Leo kept this up, the girls would find them for sure. And Draco was not about to let his first tumble with Leo Bloody Potter be in a dingy little corridor. He squirmed glaring at the boy reproachfully.
Leo chuckled leaning forward to press his lips against the blonde’s ear, “You truly are a rare beauty Draco Malfoy. Don’t worry, I’m not about to taint your body here, I’d prefer do it in the privacy of my bed.”
Ron- Julian Michael Prewett (Fabian Prewett's Only son)
Draco twisted himself in his seat so he was sitting Indian style, bracing his hands on his ankles as he smiled softly at the boy, “You love your cousin’s more than anything in the world. You hate Potion’s on principle because you don’t like my Godfather and intentionally sabotage your own potions just to irritate him and drive him crazy. Despite knowing Carina longer, you worry more about Lyra because you’re scared she’ll leave you. You hate being ignored not because you think it’s rude but because it makes you feel invisible, and your biggest fear is one day being alone. You can’t stand silence, and when you’re by yourself in the Library you drum your fingers on the table so you have at least some sort of background noise. But that’s not what you asked is it… you asked why I like you. Well that’s a very hard question to answer, and honestly I’m not sure even I know. But I do know that I like learning new things about you, you’re not a bad person Leo, you’re one of the strongest people I know and I don’t mean physically or magically. You were dealt a very poor hand in life and you made the best of it, you took charge and gave your friends and family a choice. I like you Leo… the why isn’t important, I just do.”
Professor McGonagall raised her brows, raising a hand to stall him, she peered over her glasses at him sternly, “Oh, how so?”
"We're in." they chorused ominously.
“What if he doesn’t wake up,” Harry asked quietly, face in his hands, “I hate his job, why can’t he just be a Healer like mum, I don’t worry about her as much.”
Draco blinked glancing at the table, when had they served tea?
Snape was openly glaring at him now, the student he’d previously been scolding forgotten (Something he’d noticed and taken advantage of), the look on the teachers face was of the utmost loathing. Julian rolled his eyes, the Potions Master was far too easy as well, all he had to do was play off, his silly little school boy grudges.
“Sorry we’re late the door was stuck and we kept missing it for some reason,” Millie admitted in embarrassment, a small frown of confusion curling her lips.
Sirius, in an effort to calm the storm before it happened, opened his mouth to defend the boy when. “HEEEEEEE HAAAAAWWWW!”
Blaise rolled his eyes at Pansy as if to say 'I tried.'
Harry and Draco dressed slowly before walking slowly down to the Kitchen. Sirius was at the counter making tea. “Sit,” He instructed firmly, without turning to look at them.
They did need to be careful though, as they weren’t being discreet in their opposition of the Headmaster. Professor Umbridge was oddly, though probably unintentionally helpful in this matter. She’d managed to keep the Old Man busy breathing down his neck and harassing his Teachers. The Twins had had a hard time not bursting out laughing when the woman had sat in on Professor McGonagall’s class questioning everything he did. Carina had even gone as far as explaining that ‘Professor McGonagall takes a “special” interest in our studies’ when the woman had asked Carina her thoughts on the woman. She kept her tone solemn and eyes down in a submissive manner, subtly implying something sinister. McGonagall looked like a lipless statue by the end of class. Professor Umbridge cornering her with a shark like grin.
“What are you doing here Malfoy?” Leo demanded, stalking toward the blonde in annoyance.
He internally wept for the trauma his ears were about to go through, he knew neither of these two were anywhere near rational at the moment. Carina was too angry at the perceived offense by Leo, while Leo was beyond furious about his cousins staggering misinterpretation of his reasoning.
“Really?” Lyra glanced between the two clearly unimpressed with their behavior. One of the Crups was cradled like a baby in her arms tails wagging a mile a minute. The Slytherin’s eyes nearly bulged from their heads. The girl was basically half-naked! A dark grey muggle hoodie was tied by the sleeves around her waist, worn dark blue jean shorts and a loose, sleeveless white cut off with the British Flag on it that exposed her bare stomach and yet another piercing (little diamonds hanging from tiny chains from her navel) the tongues of her distressed boots bounced merrily as she walked forward motioning Julian to join them on the main floor. Did this girl think it was summer?
Draco panted for breath, trembling in the aftershocks he buried a hand in Leo’s sweat soaked locks nuzzling the top of his head with his cheek. “Leo?”
Carina nodded sharing a happy smile with her cousin. Her Cousin! And soon she’d have her sister. Maybe they could find a house together? They might be a bit young but they needed a home right? And Harry wasn’t fond of Aunt Petunia… Merlin she was related to that woman!

“It’s new, I got it last night, in London.”
~Mikhail~
He glanced up at Harry’s face as he lined himself up, “Ready?”
"It's called strategy dear cousin, with Theo as an ally we have another foot in the door with Slytherins. I wasn't lying when I said Slytherins were the perfect allies for this plan." Leo smirked, lifting and apple and biting into it pointedly.
The man cursed him in annoyance, “Careful you daft fool, these two way mirrors aren’t cheap.”
"Weasley," Julian deadpanned, not even turning to look at the girl. The tone of the group took a dark turn.
The sneer dropped slightly in shock before returning full force. 'Go to hell' he mouthed at the blonde. Malfoy smirked and winked at him, 'only if you'll join me'. Leo shook his head feeling tense and uncomfortable. Stupid blonde pounce!
Harry frowned eyeing her skeptically, “How?”
"Dammit," Carina hissed trying to jump up but Leo restrained her.
“Hurry up vigoroso,” Blaise teased pushing him forward, looking amused. “You’ll see him soon.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Leo demanded. He didn’t like the smug look on her face.
Harry watched Vernon’s hands twitch with a raised brow and an amused twitch of his lip, “Careful Vernon, wouldn’t want you to hurt yourself again.”
“no” his voice trembled with the softly spoken denial, and he shivered at the slowly blooming smirk he felt pressed into his throat.
“So, um… where are we going?” Draco asked scratching his check with his index finger nervously.
Leo scowled, a bit of fun she says, "Get stuffed."
"Did you tell them?" Remus asked pulling out a seat next to Ron while Sirius sat next to Leo and Carina.
“I know exactly who you are, Blaise Zabini, I know who your Grandfather is and what his plans for you are. I did my research before returning this year. I know who I want on my side, and I know who I’ll need to step on to reach my goals. What I don’t know is if I’ll need to crush you or not…” Leo smirked at the amused twitch of Blaise’s lips, he laced his fingers leaning his mouth against them with a murmured, “So… do we have a deal?”
“No, no he didn’t,” Ron chuckled darkly, he glanced up at Harry, looking between him, Orion, and Mikhail, “He just tried to apologize, the Bastard wouldn’t let him, he… just forget it. Draco has it under control.”
Leo frowned at the thought, “Good.”
“LEO.”
Leo glanced at the tapestry with a frown. He wanted them to leave, where the bloody hell was his distraction.
“FUCK!”
Leo sighed looking at Julian and the Twins they wouldn’t look at him. He couldn’t believe he let things get this out of control, his cousins feared him his best mate couldn’t look at him, Theo was right they needed a break. He sighed feeling decades older then he was. Dragging himself away from the table he walked over to the twins kneeling down in front of them. Carina looked like she hadn’t been sleeping and her eyes were puffy and red from crying. Lyra was about the same but her bottom lip was puffy and bleeding slightly from being bitten and chewed on often. They looked a mess, and it was all his fault. Folding his arms across their thighs he buried his face there and allowed himself to do something he hadn’t done since last year. He cried, no sound, no shaking shoulders, just tears. Carina seemed to notice first as she began running her fingers soothingly through his hair. Lyra sighed rubbing his shoulder, and muttering something he didn’t hear to Julian.
Draco’s brow creased curiously as he waited for Harry to act.
“Don’t. Ignore me.” Leo demanded, glaring at the boy.
Millie and Theo were looking at them in disbelief, “You’re all brilliant.” Theo chuckled, “You were right Mill, and I see now why you said I wouldn’t regret this.”
“Tracy tells me you’re a Charms Prodigy,”
Petunia looked up from the album at three shocked faces.
“Everyone this is Orion Black and Mikhail Koshkov, some friends of mine from Drumstrang. Rion, Mik, this is Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Ginny Weasley. I haven’t properly met the other two. I apologize.”
Draco listened with a cool detachment as the greasy haired man stalked back and forth between them. Basically he was warning them against socializing outside of their House, quoting disappointment and betrayal. The more he spoke the more Draco believed the man had said or done something monumentally stupid to lose himself a friend, or a lover? That could explain the man’s caustic attitude, maybe even some of his cruelty. When the speech died down the man aimed a sneer at him, ordering him to follow him to his office. Draco rolled his eyes when the man offered no explanation, merely turning and marching away.
Carina and Ron eyed them warily but relaxed none the less, blissfully ignorant the Leo’s sulky thoughts.
He leaned back away from the mirror smirking at Draco, “You haven’t hung up me.”
“That’s Blaise Zabini, he’s one of Malfoy’s oldest friends. Rumor has it his Mom is the Head of one of
“I’m not just your Master Tinsel, you are my friend,” Draco corrected quietly, reaching down to hug the tiny creature. He felt her small body tremble slightly before she pushed him away.
Harry shook his head rapidly leaning into Draco’s chest, “I don’t want talk about it yet, please Draco… just promise me you won’t leave me alone with them?”
Carina had scowled and caught her unwilling boyfriends wrist when he’d tried to slink away, storming out after her raging cousin.
Draco watched warily as Blaise strolled forward confidently to shake the man’s hand.
Leo sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose nearly dislodging his glasses, "If he breaks your heart I'll break his neck." He warned, sounding frighteningly serious.
Draco complied moving slowly at first, before building into the rough pace that drove Harry forward wildly.
Blaise growled quietly expression darkening quickly, “What did he have on you?”
“Draco?” the blonde scowled as frustrated tears weld up in his eyes, refusing to meet the boys’ eyes.
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
that thing a child? This had to be a form of abuse. The boy was only a few months older than them and was already
The rest of the Welcoming feast was spent in silence, after Dumbledore returned from escorting a still boiling Mrs. Weasley to the floo.
“Do you mind Potter… I’m bathing.” Draco drawled lazily.
Draco rolled his eyes grabbing Harry’s legs and…flipping him. Before roughly grabbing his hips and forcing him to his knees, “Stay still!”
Julian scowled at the Medi-witches Office, he hated people like her.
“This is a joke… Please tell me this is just a really poor Joke,” George moaned piteously, rubbing his face.
Leo studied her critically never giving anything away before slowly leaning forward threading his fingers in front of his mouth in a strategic move to appear aloof.
Hermione looked surprised, but nodded none the less. She was nervous, she hadn’t told either of her friends about her ‘home’ situation yet and she was beginning to worry. How would she get to Kings Cross? She could probably hide out in one of the bathrooms for the night. But she’d have to walk there, she was quickly running out of money.
Ginny choked on her bacon, before demanding between coughs, “Draco tricked Orion into being his friend?”
James had finally kicked his friends out and the next few days were quiet as they tried to go about their days normally. And after an agonizingly LONG summer, and his first boyfriend, his Parents seemed to accept that their son as he was and supported him happily. That had been two years ago when he was thirteen. Now at fifteen his parents seemed to always be asking about his love life. His dad even made a joke about an experimental potion he’d heard about that allowed Gay Wizards to have kids. He’d told him to hurry up and find a bloke so they could have some grandkids. Lily had smacked him round the head and told him to stop trying to make her baby grow up faster than he already was.
Julian grinned back, “And you’d fail.”
The group laughed and joked for a while before things took a more serious turn.
Harry blinked realizing he hadn’t even thought about how Draco would be paying for this. It was a sweet gesture, Draco asking His Mum and Godfathers for help. He knew it took a lot for Draco to ask for help. He must have really wanted to impress Harry today.
The Dursley’s, Draco learned, were not an attractive lot.
Lyra stood and sweep past the first years to the Gryffindor table.
The blonde startled before hurrying after the raven. He was led down another intricately decorated hallway before being led into a massive room done in Royal Blue and Dark Wood. The floor still a swirling white marble with gold and silver speckled through it.
“I want to stay too!” Harry declared loudly.
Blaise raised an amused brow at the girl and shrugged, “it’s best not to even try arguing with him, humoring him is easier.”
"Oh Shit," Ron groaned seeing Sirius and Remus.
“More please, more,” Harry choked, nearly delirious with the steady shocks of pleasure shooting through his body.
"What?" Remus asked trying to figure out what he’d asked through the fog that seemed to try to suppress his thought.
“I’ll see you two in a few days, but remember… Cousins, Brothers… We’re still family. I’m here if you two need me, but only the two of you, at least until we know who out of the family we can trust.” The twins nodded, gratitude filling their eyes.
Draco's eye's traveled over his body a curious spark in his blue/gray eyes.
Draco arched a brow at the streaks of black painting the man’s thighs, and chest, this was definitely not one of the ways he pictured Leo at home.
“Leo kissed Malfoy,” Theo elaborated, shushing his distraught girlfriend quietly.
"I haven't got all day Bulstrode," Leo replaced his smirk with a blank look, "What is your answer?"
Umbridge's speech though caused a bit of a stir. It was uncomfortably clear Dumbledores' trouble made her happy.
Leo looked at him seriously, “I meant what I said Theo, break her heart and I’ll break your neck.”
Sirius sighed, feeling guilty about upsetting the girl, "I'm sorry Cari it just gets me so angry knowing I could have taken care of the three of you."
"My father was Fabian Prewett." Ron sighed, dragging his hand down his face, why him. This whole situation was becoming more troublesome by the moment, he’d much rather they all continue as they had been before. But they knew now, and they couldn’t ever forget. It was obvious they’d been pushed together, and not for the first time he wondered just HOW the troll had made it from the dungeon to the third floor bathroom without being spotted.
Harry craned his head around to shot a bewildered look at the newest Gryffindor. Orion was perched on Ron’s bed looking for all the world like she belonged there. The  Blonde shrugged tilting her head in concern. Sighing Harry flopped back down as he felt Seamus and Ron lay/sit down on either side of him.
Millicent who had been silent the whole time spoke up, "So do we call you boss now too?"
Draco smirked as he walked to the door.
“Harry’s gay though,” Seamus stated tactlessly, causing Hermione and Ginny to roll their eyes at him in exasperation.
“You’re dry down there! It’ll hurt!” Draco panted in frustration, “Do something! Use that spell to… wet your naughty bits!”
Draco almost wanted to laugh, at them, instead he adopted a casual half smile, “Good Morning Blaise, Good Morning Adrian. Time for breakfast, did you remember all your books, they haven’t given us our times tables yet, so I packed everything.”
A loud crack had several of the girls releasing startled shrieks, Draco would’ve sworn one came from Davis who was still passed out on the ground.
In the days following Harry’s Sixteenth Birthday party, things seemed to get better. Mrs. Evan’s moved out, she was temporarily staying with the Dursley’s the last he’d heard. Mr. Potter was released from Saint Mungos two weeks after Harry’s Birthday. As a result Draco saw less of him. So after six weeks of short stolen moments, it was a relief to wake up early on September 1
"WHAT!" Harry demanded grabbing his head in frustration as he looked around as if looking for something that could help him process all this.
Translations
Carina merely smiled shaking her head, “Despite the fact that everything I’ve been through…. Despite being homeless for a while. I’m glad, I wouldn’t have met you otherwise. Aside from Leo, and Rae, Uncle Rem and Uncle Siri…. You are the one thing I would never trade. I think…. I think I L-”
"Wrong, my parents were neutral, as were Sirius and Remus, Dumbledore messed with they're memories. I spoke with them recently. That night two years ago Sirius wasn't after Pettigrew or me. He went after Dumbledore only for him to Alter his memories too. The Old Man's trying to control me. But I won't let him." Leo growled the last sentence, the dark threat heavy in his tone.
“I already added the base,” Leo informed him.
The girl stared at him in stunned, open mouthed silence before two large boys grabbed her arms and physically lifted her out of his way ignoring her indignant protests to release her at once. Draco filed the names Crabbe and Goyle away, though he wasn’t sure which name went with either of the boys.
magazines, ‘course it’s your fault.”
"What?" Millicent looked confused, eyeing him warily as if uncertain of his intentions.
“Blaise Zabini,” The boy returned after a moment, a cautious look in his eye “My Mother wouldn’t exactly win Worlds Best either.”
Leo nodded a slow vicious smile curling the corner of his mouth, “Excellent.”
“Now the Girding Potion that we were previously discussing is unique as it has only four necessary ingredients. Fairy wings, Doxy Eggs, Flying Seahorses, and Dragonfly Thoraxes. It’s also one of the most difficult potions as the measurements of those ingredients must be exact. Too much of one ingredient could drastically alter the effects of the potion. For example, the potion is intended to increase the takers endurance, if made incorrectly it could drastically decrease the takers endurance to the point where standing from a chair could become an exhausting task. The only identifying characteristic of this potion is its golden color. It is often confused for Felix Felicis do to the similar color tone.” Julian drawled, smirking at the slight widening of their Professor’s eyes.
“MERLIN! You're sooo bloody vindictive you know that!” Leo snapped, chuckling humorlessly.
Draco’s brow pinched as he led the distraught boy over to the couch, “Who? Love what’s going on?”
TwistedIrish <3
Leo snorted, eyes narrowing cruelly as he glared at the center of the table. “Lord Zabini… I don’t merely plan on killing the old Fool.”
Draco proved him right moments later, “Why are you pushing this so much. You don’t know me, why do you want to date me so bad?”
"What?" Leo asked warily. Great more drama, didn't they have enough going on? What else could Dumbledore throw at them?
Draco groaned before picking up the mirror, he couldn’t believe he was doing this again, “Alright Padfoot, what do you have?”
Alright, I've been gone for a long time. And you all deserve an explanation, to those of you who have stuck around and been here from the beginning, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting and to those who have fallen in love with this story while I've been away, thank you for your support and patience.
Thank you to everyone who's stuck around.
Draco sighed nodding along. It was moments like this he longed for Sirius’ crass humor, warm smiles, and gruff barking laughter. Lucius would forever be warm, or welcoming the way the striking raven haired man would. A quick glance at the icily stern gaze of Narcissa had Draco thinking of Remus. His warm comforting hugs, reassuring smile and kind advice, and then Lily. She truly was a wild one, like a cool Aunt that helped you get one over on your parents. Yes, Draco would admit it, he was jealous of his Boyfriends family. Harry was so lucky.
“This is Brilliant!” Draco laughed looking back at the candy shop in disbelief.
Malfoy slowly shook his head, “I’m not mad at you.” Malfoy picked up his bag leaving the mountain of books on the table, only grabbing the one he’d been reading.
He couldn’t believe it. His crush, even if it had only been for his appearance, had said he liked him too. He didn’t care if it was just a physical attraction, he was a teenage boy he had hormones like anyone else. Plus dating was all about getting to know each other, and he was really interested in getting to know the sexy bloke in front of him. Both physically and otherwise, he wouldn’t mind as long as it was good. And… bloody hell!
“If you don’t hurry up I’ll finish myself and kick you out.” Harry commented lightly as if asking what time it was.
Sirius clenched his jaw, a twitch forming in his left eye, he looked like he might have a fit or something.
Blaise wore a mildly amused smirk as he idly stirred his eggs, eyes cataloging every expression, twitch, and every word that passed over the table. It was all very entertaining, he’d decided he’d have to thank Draco for seducing the Gryffindors resident Snake. He’d found the nickname rather fitting the longer he observed the odd bunch. He’d admit to being surprised by Potter and his friends, the masks they’d presented to the rest of the school had been so utterly flawless even he’d not offered them a second glance. He’d been speaking to his Zii about Potter and his friends a lot recently, his Madre had even begun contemplating extending an invitation to the boy to meet with him one weekend.
Lily sighed eyeing the car guiltily as well as the cautiously hope look in her son’s face. “Oh, alright! But you can’t have it until you get your license!”
“Lesson one, you have to relax.” Harry laughed, “Part of being together is just spending time being with that person, you don’t really need to do anything.”
Draco had never really been a fan of his Godfather. And as he followed the dour man through the corridors he doubt seriously if he ever really would be.
Zabini just looked at her, sending a cool chill down her spine, before walking slowly down the hall. Lyra released a shuddering breath quietly trying to compose herself.
“Well I THOUGHT you were attractive but it seems that’s all you are,” Harry informed him boldly. “Now you can leave, I promise I won’t ‘stalk’ you anymore as I’ve officially lost all interest.”
“Crystal,” Draco drawled coolly, raising a brow at the sneer the older man sent him.
Lucius looked up from the Daily Prophet pinning him with a stern look, “We spoke last night about expectations. But I believe a reminder is in order should you get any… unsavory ideas in that think head of yours.”
Harry sighed waving lazily as Sirius left the house, it had been two days since his parents left and each time Sirius’ visits seemed to last longer. Don’t get him wrong he loved spending time with his godfather, but the man could wear you out. They’d spent the whole visit in the back yard Harry playing fetch with ‘Padfoot’ Sirius’ animagis form, which happened to be a large black dog. No Harry loved his godfather, the only thing that bothered him was that the visits cut into his ‘habit’ and today he had probably missed the boy entirely as it was passed three already. Sighing Harry trudged up to his room and flopped onto his bed groaning tiredly. He snatched up his cell phone when it rang flipping it open. (It’s 1995 what do you want?)
“Draco?”
“She’ll die a virgin,” Sirius vowed firmly a dark look in his eyes.
Leo chuckled smirking in amusement. “They call it the Lost Room, because it moves around the seventh floor, occasionally disappearing entirely. In all honesty, I stumbled upon this room in second year. Carina, Julian, and I later discovered it was the Lost RoR. We studied late into the night in the restricted section on how to summon it. It’s one of Hogwarts many Dark secrets.”
Draco smirked before they both stared laughing and Draco groaned dragging himself off Harry and out of bed. “I should really get home. Lucius will be sending a house elf to wake me in six hours.”
Leo frowned, turning his gaze to the suddenly nervous boy, “What?” He snapped, he didn’t like the look on the other boys face.
“Well we can’t exactly put a sign up stating our intentions, we’d never succeed that way, Leo’s chosen a slow highly efficient approach.” Theo smirked, thinking of all the plans Leo and Julian had in store for the foolish old man.
Blaise raised an unimpressed brow, “And if I did?” Draco knew Blaise didn’t like being questioned, what with being the future Don he felt as if his authority was being called into question.
“Great, it’s settled, back to lunch?” Lyra asked with a hopeful little smile, biting into a chip.
Harry flushed glancing down at his lap, but just as quickly he was looking away, having forgotten he was completely naked, and very hard.
Carina shifted guiltily, before huffing and blurting out, "I have a crush on Theodore Nott."
“…The Fuck?” Ginny demanded eloquently, looking between the two, with a chip posed halfway to her mouth. Dean shifted uncomfortably trading a guarded look with Seamus.
Julian smirked after him relaxing against the railing with one the crups sitting beside him tails wagging happily. The boy was wearing muggle clothes as well. Worn light wash jeans, with a grey t-shirt, and a jean jacket/ hoodie combo.
"Carina, you know Violet was your mother right," Sirius looked nervous as he turned to face her. She looked so much like her mother. The same soft cream complexion, same doe-like eyes. But she seemed to have Reggie’s eyes. That sharp calculated gaze… why hadn’t he noticed before? She looked surprised but nodded for him to continue. "Well I know who your father was."
Leo looked to his left, "Julian?"
“I was taking you to the Cinema,” Draco confessed, smiling indulgently at the petulant look his boyfriend gave him.
Harry shook his head staring at her with large eyes. He’d known Draco never had a boyfriend before him, but he hadn’t known that the boy had flat out refused to date.
“You dare-”
Draco felt his lip curl, “You could leave. Seeing as you weren’t invited in the first place.”
Leo and Carina exchanged a look before sighing, Carina secretly feeling guilty for making her Uncle feel bad.
“Mr. Potter! Sit with Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Prewett sit with Mr. Nott. Ms. Black each of you with either Mr. Goyle or Mr. Crabbe. Decide between the two of you!” Professor Snape snapped, from the front of the room.
Leo’s brows jumped to his hairline as he turned to them, a slow smile (A Real Freaking SMILE) curling his lips. He pushed himself to his feet, ignoring Lyra’s disgruntled frown, “Hey.”
"Right," Carina agreed, "And I am allowed to date." She shot at Leo.
Draco rubbed roughly at his hair with the dark green towel, he hadn’t responded after Leo’s confession, and Leo hadn’t pushed for one. The tension however had been palpable, it was clear the older teen was torturing himself over the confession. The guilt over causing the boy’s stress was tearing him apart, his lack of reaction was taking a toll on both of them, but what was he meant to say?
would possess you to bare the presence of Mr. Prewett?”
Leo exchanged a somber look with Julian and his Cousins.
“We’ll be talking to her later,” Leo drawled absently, eyeing his lunch distastefully. The elves must be on strike the food was defiantly not as good as usual.
Leo shoved himself away from the table packing up his things quickly. Carina bit her lips looking mildly remorseful. He shouldered his bag and instead of heading toward the door, he turned toward Malfoy and walked straight over to his table.

“You climbed in my lap kitten, I’m just obliging your unspoken request.” Leo ‘reassured’ wicked smirk returning full force, Draco shied away as Leo slowly sat up hands moving to the blondes hips adjusting him until his bum was settled firmly against…. Draco had no idea his face could feel this warm.
The exquisite room was lavishly decorated, with large windows that overlooked Grimmauld Place in front of the house. Even though there was a bright fire crackling in the large fireplace, the room was still chilly. Two ornate glass-fronted cabinets flanked the fireplace and Ron was tempted to take a closer look at the obscure tidbits inside them.
Their silvery blond hair was gleaming in the low lighting of the Drawing Room and their haughty features paired with an overly aristocratic behaviour made him feel inadequate. He'd always known that Draco and he were not exactly cut from the same cloth what with the Potters being excluded from the Sacred 28 and his adoptive father being disowned from his own pureblood family.
She was making her way deeper into the basement, when she could hear a soft murmuring. Twisting around, Hermione tried to pinpoint from where the voices were coming from. Was there someone else down there that the Aurors didn’t know about? Drawing her wand, she tiptoed closer to the fireplace, when her eyes fell onto a wooden door leading back out of the kitchen.
There were startled shouts and bitten of curses and the crying of little Teddy Lupin. Draco could feel the tension rising even still and slowly let his wand slip down from its holster and into his hand. He cast a worried glance down the table at Harry, whose face was frozen in appalled shock. Teddy was cradled against Remus’ chest now, face hidden away in the folds of his father’s robes.
The delicious burn of being stretched open while a strong, firm body rubbed and pressed against his was exquisite. Which may be because the body in question knew exactly how to move to push Harry closer to the edge.
That haughty voice that never lost its snobbish accent even between guttural grunts and low moans that made his toes curl. That wispy blond hair that was so soft between his clenched fingers. Those silver eyes looking down at him lovingly.
They had barely made it up the stairs to the entry hall when Sirius Black came charging at them with a broken cry and ripped Teddy out of Kreacher’s hold.
Looking around insecurely, he spotted a glass door at the very end of the hallway, standing slightly open and letting in a cool breeze. Maybe uncle Regulus had gone there?
Almost a year later, Regulus and Harry spent most evenings cuddled up on the plush sofa in the living room, reading “just one more bedtime story, James”. And no matter how welcoming the three Marauders had been since his crash into their idyll, that little boy coming up to him was his tipping point. It was even more than that really. It was his saving grace.
"The heir? But the heir hadn't been declared then, still hasn't been yet!" Sirius had sprung to his feet as if to advance at her.
And that’s where the murmurs were coming from. Slinking closer still, she tried to make out what was being said.
Tightening his grip around his own wand, he rathered erred on the safe side. If curses started flying, he was ready to react.
"Malfoy, can you for once act like the despicable cousin not far enough removed that you are and call me Tonks like everybody else?" Grabbing his offered hand, she pulled herself up. "Come on, I want to hear you say it!"
The only saving grace of this evening would be if he could get Harry to blow him in front of that wretched tapestry or in Sirius Black's old childhood bedroom. He could work that one in nicely when the Deputy Head Auror came around his hospital ward with a twisted ankle again after Harry and he had made their engagement official.
"It's an incredibly nice, strong muggle, alc-oh that's why you guys don't know about it!" The two friends looked at each other.
"Mate, why should it matter. It's a song! Come on loosen up have some fun." He exclaimed trying to cheer him up.
Draco continued down the corridor, the music becoming silent as he walked deeper into the corridors. Of course he was aware of the raven haired boy behind him but he didn't stop until he turned the corner, where he waited patiently.
"Harry..."  he was in bliss.
"I thought you were straight, Potter." He mocked. Harry, who was still holding onto Draco's collar, laughed.
"Shut up." He said in a sulk before getting dressed and going down to Pansy.
He was sitting in the common room along with Ron, Dean, Seamus and Neville.
"Urm" Blaise chuckled again but nervously this time, he couldn't say it.
"Draco."
"You left about an hour before the party ended, no one knows where you went. But you obviously weren't there for too long because you seemed to have been passed out for a while when we found you in here." Blaise told, looking at Theo for conformation. He nodded.
"Don't make me have to use French around you guys again." Draco warned grabbing his shirt from his bed post.
"Well He sobered up a little bit but obviously not enough to keep his 'little' secret from us." Blaise remarked.
"I can't remember." He lied.
"It's not stupid." He retorted.
"Well no one exactly wants to see their best friend eating the face off of their supposéd enemy." She mumbled so that only she could hear, or that's what she thought.
"GOLD!"
"Hang on, yes that's right! He's in Azkaban, rotting in a cell, regretting everything he did-" Draco couldn't take it anymore, he dragged him off the wall and weakly pounded his fist to Harry's face and finding it hard to slam him back against the wall.
"You tricked me into telling you! You couldn't remember, you jerk!" Pansy shouted before turning and walking out of the common room in a huff.
"Well you're not going to want to talk to her but, Pansy." Harry looked at her as if she was Peeves about to drop a bowl of pumpkin juice on McGonagall’s head. He started to get worried at what happened between him and Draco. He knew he was with Draco because who else could she be talking about if it was Pansy that saw, it must have been. And since when did he start calling Malfoy, Draco?
"Potter. What are you doing talking to Pansy?" He asked intimidatingly.
"Yeah why not.” His bushy haired friend shrugged. “I’ll help you.” She offered.
"It's not just a song Blaise." He replied stroppily, folding his arms and leaning against the back wall. "It's my pride he's hurt too." He said as his best friend chuckled.
"Except for who Ginny please tell me." He cut in starting to get impatient.
Draco turned from talking to Blaise and Pansy to watch the rather entertaining and ridiculous spectacle. He he didn’t mean to, but he did find Potter rather attractive in muggle clothing, not that he’d ever tell anyone that, he was NOT gay.
"Right now."
Draco pulled away for breath they locked eyes and after a few heavy and drawn out breaths with their foreheads touching, moved his head to Harry's ear.
"Yes and I didn't like what I saw." She spat.
Draco placed his hand on short boy’s hip, slowly inching closer.
"So why are you getting all defensive about it then, huh?" Blaise stated gaining more confidence.
"When I called on her in her common room, she seemed upset, shocked even. I suspect she saw something to do with you and Draco." She said obliviously. Harry looked at her with wide eyes.
"I would be careful if I were you, Potter." Draco threatened.
He looked at the little group and sighed, he felt sorry for Potter really, he didn’t ask to be who he was. He started to feel a little guilty about the way he got jealous of the raven boy just because he was popular and seemed to get everything he wanted without even needing to ask (Draco didn’t know this but Harry never wanted any of that). Yeah, he was jealous, and no he didn’t just admit that. But Malfoy wasn’t going to ponder about Potter all night, he himself was going to take a leaf out of his book and loosen up, and to him, the only way to do that was to drink.
"First my pride, now me! Wow Blaise you're being nice aren't you." He commented sarcastically as he dramatically placed a hand on his heart.
"I really couldn't tell you anything Hermione! I can't remember." Harry exaggerated with a sigh.
There were some looks around the room in anticipation as the muggleborns and halfbloods were confirmed from their guesses of the song. Just then, the much loved, Golden Trio finally entered the room. Hermione and Ron challengingly raised their voices to get Harry to sing just a little louder. It worked.
"You were hammered last night." Blaise remarked sitting up from his bed.
"Why's that, what you going to do? Punch me again? Kick me? Or worse. Would Crucio do? How about Avada-"
"Thank you for coming home
"She might have a point, but I cant tell you because I don't remember." He said exasperatedly.
"Ginny what did I do?" He questioned as he got to her. She scoffed at him rolling her eyes.
"That merlin forbidding swine, stole my song."  He sulked, Blaise let out a snort.
At the same time Draco- um- Malfoy, walked down to see Pansy walking away from none other than Potter. His face grew slightly hotter at the sight of him but he tried to hide it. He knew that if he didn't confront him, he would notice something was up.
"Yes Pansy listen up mu-ggle you know the non-magical type honestly woman it's like you don't hear a word I say." He scoffed and left leaving both Pansy and Blaise reasonably amused.
Luck has left me standing so tall”
"So, where did we leave off before Snape found us? Potter." He walked towards him wearing his signature smirk.
"You know perfectly well why that is." The taller boy thundered.
"This is about a song." He croaked; the alcohol still burning his throat. This angered Draco more.
"I mean you could use sectumsempra but you wouldn't know how, in fact, you wouldn't have the guts-"
"What exactly are you going to ask me then?" Draco replied in a bored tone.
"Petrified?" He questioned.
"Oh not this again." She sighed.
"So what did you want?" Draco asked as he made his to the middle of the Slytherin common room where Pansy was.
He started to count on his fingers dozily
"Potter. Oh potter take me I'm all yours!" Theo mocked flinging his arms out to the sides and laughing. Draco's cheeks went flaming red with embarrassment.
"Yeah your little muggle obsession secret got out and well..." The caramel boy sighed a little, knowing Draco would rip him apart if he phrased it wrong, but seeing his current state, he didn't need to be too careful. "...You were saying someone's name in your sleep last night." He finally settled with. The blond looked at him, petrified.
Nodding at the other man, Harry twisted into a Side-Along Apparition to bring them to the other side of London. To a flat that they would share hopefully not too far into the future. He was more than ready to leave that night behind him. And he looked forward into the future with the man right by his side.
Snorting, Sirius slipped his wand back into his sleeve. "Believe me when I say that hexes are the only language that this woman understands. Also, wouldn’t want to make your investigation too easy, now would we?"
Inching into the dimly lit kitchen, Hermione knocked onto the heavy door to announce herself.
“Master Teddy is being distraught and Kreacher is going after him to be helping him and then mistress Bellatrix is there as Kreacher is just getting to the garden. Mistress Bellatrix is knowing who Master Teddy is! Mistress Bellatrix is scaring Master Teddy, is saying she is being correcting a grievous mistake."
And just a second later he was cradled in his house-elf's arms to be carried away from the tree and back into the innards of his house.
Maybe back then he wouldn’t have been that averse to inherit it. He wouldn’t be opposed to a love nest in the city when Wiltshire became too much. A few centuries ago the house would have had potential. Now though, with darkness clinging to its every corner? He certainly wouldn’t volunteer to take it off his great aunt’s hands. What was that inheritance talk even about? The old hag surely had a few decades in her still, bitterness keeping her alive and kicking and such.
How should he have imagined what both women were willing to do to finally bring forth the one, true heir of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Never had he seen a reason to question what Bellatrix could mean by her vow to stay "toujours pur", to what lengths she would go to.
Where was uncle Regulus? He hadn’t come back, maybe he was scared of the spells and screaming as well? Teddy could go looking for him and maybe together it wouldn’t be as scary.
“It’s ironic. Did you also know that ‘wych’ comes from the Old English ‘wice’ which means pliant or supple. Nothing supple about those branches, if I may be so crude.”
Not only the uncanny physical resemblance to her older sister Bellatrix left Harry feeling unsettled, the icy glares both women shot each other were fearsome. The only difference setting the Black sisters apart was that while Bellatrix was dark-haired and her heavily-lidded eyes sparked maliciously, Andromeda had light brown hair and her eyes were kinder, even while staring down her counterpart.
It was a few hours later when they made their way through the gates of Hogwarts and trekked down to the Quidditch pitch, where the student body was already firing up the atmosphere. They had picked up Sirius and Remus on their way up to Scotland and James couldn’t wait for the whole family to get a little bit of time together with Harry after the game. Breathing in deeply, he felt himself transported back to similar days in early autumn, but an eternity ago.
Draco would have chimed in with Sirius' cackling, oddly reminiscent of a dog's bark, if properness hadn't been instilled into him by his mother's strict hand. A Malfoy did not lose his composure even in the face of the utter madness that was Black inheritance law.
For the first time in maybe forever, Regulus Black felt loved.
Breathing in deeply, he let the sounds of the city awakening from its slumber and their family hurrying out of the house behind them surround him. When they reached the street, he turned on his heels and looked back one last time at where Number 12 Grimmauld Place vanished into nothingness between numbers 11 and 13.
The double standards of this family…
And what any of that had to do with him. Should have guessed that even his duty to marry and to sire the next heir could be twisted beyond recognition.
Draco would bet that he could make something along the lines of “none of them worth it” and “don’t stoop so low”. Bellatrix may not be able to see why Andromeda had forsaken her family for this man, but he had a pretty good idea just by watching them for a few minutes.
In the end, the choice wasn’t his.
"Well, maybe I should offer my services to Regulus’ little boy then. As an apology of sorts for ever even looking at him the wrong way.” Snorting, she reached over and grabbed Narcissa’s full glass of wine, downing it at once. “Because I hear congratulations are in order. Or at least the tapestry seems to think that the little Potter is engaged to our dear Draco.”
He couldn’t help but chuckle when she poked him in the side with her wand. Sneaky Aurors, always had their wand at the ready while you are none the wiser.
Harry was ripped from his musings by a pair of small hands sharply tugging at his robes.
Hermione had gone back to the heart of the house, in parts because it was the only room not crawling with Aurors and she needed to think. And also because the only one who could be able to help her was down there as well.
To this day, Regulus’ disappointment, made apparent in his stoic, unreadable face and cool tone of voice, about Harry’s hormone riddled brain and teenage arrogance hurt more than any loud, ardent dressing down his dad could have ever handed out.
But what really caught his eye in the room was the wall at the far side of the Drawing Room. The entirety of it was covered by a tapestry, depicting a huge tree with widely sprawling branches.
Teddy made his way along the hallway and came to a stop at the bottom of the stairs. His dad had carried him up the staircase when they arrived but he didn’t dare climb them by himself. The scary elf heads were staring down at him and made him feel yucky.
Harry weakly cupped a hand around a pale cheek and leaned in for a searing kiss. Distractedly, he waved a hand over himself with a quick cleaning spell. And just when Draco had helped him make up his dress robes again when a shrill ringing sound was ripping through the house. It made Harry jump violently and bump his head against the wall.
Next to his husband, well into his forties but dressed like a rebellious teen, Remus Lupin cut an imposing but comparatively proper figure. Wearing his curse for the world to see with ghastly scars cutting across his face, he faced Walburga Black head on with a tall and proud posture.
Dabbing her lips delicately with a satin napkin, Walburga did not take his bait. Huh, maybe he had gotten a bit rusty after being genuinely happy for so long.
“Where is my son? What did she do to my son?”
And above all the uproar he could hear great aunt screeching: “The family magic will run its course!”
When Ron stepped out into the backyard, he took a deep breath. In a stark contrast to the house, the garden was idyllic and peaceful. A sea of bushes and flower beds were in full bloom and the large trees dotted around the property were rustling softly in a magical breeze.
“First rule of being a Black is: Don’t be a Squib. Secondly, don’t be a blood traitor. That’s what got me burned off. Also, she never did like me in general. Third rule is to never marry below your station or rather anyone below your blood status. That one broke Andromeda’s neck. Funnily, the tapestry updates itself without following those rules. So Ted and Dora had to be blasted off as well. Only ones up there still are Narcissa, Lucius and Draco now that Bellatrix kicked the bucket.”
And as broken as her wand were her limbs.
The big, beautiful tree that he had admired before shook itself awake from his roots to the very tips of his leaves. And before the darkest of magic could be unleashed by the spell, the tree's branches reached out after the woman with the crazy eyes, choking her off. Lifting up her body in an eerie dance of leaves and branches to the sounds of foliage rustling, bark groaning, and bones breaking.
That made Hermione pause. Had Teddy been out there when Bellatrix had been attacked? Was this Kreacher implicating himself?
“My bet is that our darling Walburga set the whole thing on fire when you graciously decided to give birth to the spawn of our first cousin once removed.” Catching up to her, he made his way up past the shrunken house-elf heads to the first floor of Grimmauld Place.
"Blood traitor, don’t you dare besmirch my fathers' honour and legacy!"
Plush but urgent lips opened his own up for a deep kiss, tongues stroking against each other, chasing shivers up and down Harry’s spine. Before he had even a chance at gathering his bearings, the blond man had opened the silver clasps keeping his robes in place. They fell open with a soft rustle and left his chest exposed to the chill air of the room. A moment later, he could feel his trousers loosening and fall around his knees.
