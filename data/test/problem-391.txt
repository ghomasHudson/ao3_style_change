"No," he repeated. He's not easy to talk to, that's for sure. I want so desperately for him to be my friend. Hopefully I can charm him into liking me.
"Wait, are you gonna - are you putting your fingers in there?!" Potter's voice is laced with shock and Draco chuckles breathily while inserting a finger. Harry watches with wide eyes, listening to Dracos little whimpers and admiring the alabaster skin - his muscles jerk under his ministrations and Malfoys wet skin seems to glitter in the candlelight. A sudden urge arrives and Harry clears his throat before asking gently, "Can I taste you?"
"No, Pansy. Where are your clothes? Also, why the hell are you transformed? Snape is gonna kill you."
"Lucius," Mr. Weasley responds with an edge to his voice. The tension between the two is highly palpable.
I walk down the carpeted wooden steps, toward my demise. "Bet you loved that, Potter," I say with a sneer and then I'm nose-to-nose with my "nemesis."
Things seemed to have settled into a rhythm of sorts - walk through the castle with an upturned nose, flanked by furious idiots; see Potter, provoke Potter; down my sweets and lose my sense of self for a couple hours; hang out with Pansy and Blaise and the elves until my godfather comes to yell at us. It was fine, up until Halloween.
"Promise to keep a secret?" He chokes out, voice high. We nod slowly, suspicious. "Ok so I was just, er, you know, smoking-"
I'm alive, and this pain, this pleasure, is all proof of that. So maybe once I wake up, I'll make a move on Potter. Maybe he'll help me and Astoria to raise Scorp. Maybe he'll join our relationship. Maybe I'll live forever...
"That's not a vegetable," Draco drawls with a smile, wiping spit off his face with a sleeve and taking a few steps back.
They're out in the gardens together. She's planting flowers and Draco is running around on stubby toddler legs, trying to catch a peacock. Every day she takes him out here, reading to him and telling him stories about her family.
Draco moans as well, gripping the forearm Harry's wrapped tightly around his front and squeezing hard to encourage the idiot boy behind him to fucking move.
Harry grabs his hand, a small frown on his face, and paces in front of an empty wall until a door appears. Draco gasps and pulls his hand away.
He ruts against me and, oh fuck, he's hung like a hippogriff. I moan weakly into his mouth, and he pulls his lips away from mine. Panting down at me, he smirks.
"You better trust him!" Pansy exclaims, finally joining our conversation rather than sitting on the windowsill and cooing to Ophelia.
Getting to sleep that night was harder than I could imagine. Pansy was right - her father had killed her best friend. My stomach aches dully, a reminder that I haven't eaten since noon. Blaise had gotten Crucio'd right before departing, as he was displaying some of his gargoyle traits without realizing it. Most Pureblood families have at least a little magical creature blood, but it was unspoken of. Yes, the creature ancestry did give us extra powers. Yes, it lessened incestuous patterns. Yes, it was looked down upon. And so, whenever Pans gets upset and murmurs something in Mermish unknowingly, she gets beat. The harsher punishments were only given if a child showed partbred traits in public, hence why Blaise got to feel the full extent of an Unforgivable Curse at lunch - his ears had pointed and turned grey without his realizing. I wonder how long I can hold back my fire before getting Crucio'd like my mother was in that very moment.
Draco looked at the screen and didn’t know what he should write now. “I bought it to see you as a little girl” would be a wrong move.
That was pretty bold of him to ask that but he wanted to see him. He wanted to see how it looked on him, if it was like he pictured it when he bought it. He wanted to see his embarrassment while wearing it.
Harry went into the store and Draco stood there for a second, dumbfounded, before he quickly followed.
“I know. And I feel bad about it. I’m really sorry Harry.” Draco answered and looked at him, trying to hold back from playing with the black hair that tickled Harrys cheeks. Was it just him or did his hair got longer?
When Harry mastered this task he decided to undergo a surgery to get rid of his testicles. He didn’t need them after all so they were useless. And since his teenage years he had a liking for piercings. Draco was with him every time he got a new one. One in his tongue, two on his nipples, two on his hips (it’s still hot as fuck), one in his bellybutton but for Draco the real art was right between his legs. After his testicles were removed Harry went alone and got himself piercings along his now empty skin right under his cock and a Guiche piercing. Both of them knew it was for decoration after all and maybe for some teasing but it was clearly the most beautiful sight every time he spread his legs for Draco or for someone else when they were in a club and he was nothing else than a hole in a wall to fuck.
“You know I was thinking… How about we change roles? I’m gonna be the Bad Wolf and you’re going to be…
Harry winked at him and that took Draco by surprise because sometimes he wasn’t really used to him being so confident in his body. After they started to have more contact again he also learnt about his past with the Dursleys and why exactly Harry was living with Hermione and her family now. And with that Harry started to be more confident, more cheeky. Maybe it was also because he started to grow from a teenage boy into a young man but his behavior changed and he still wasn’t really used to it. His behavior when Draco wanted to have pictures in clothes he bought him was still the same though… Shy and timid and that’s what he loved most.
The bedroom door opened and for a moment there was silence before it was closed again and the smell of a fresh spoken spell went through the bedroom. Silencing charm probably as well as a secured locked door and also a spell for keeping people away with different thoughts as soon as they wanted to enter. Though he wasn’t able to do magic he knew Dracos spells by now after nearly 20 years of marriage and relationship. He knew his husband watched him, watched every move he made on their bed, watched his position, if everything was just as Draco wanted it but Harry himself knew the position was perfect. He had a lot of practice for that.
“Oh Harry! How was your day? You look very happy today!” The woman said while holding a cooking spoon in her hand.
Draco was quite cryptic about how he wanted to spend their day together, mumbling something about going to shop some clothes which was kind of weird for Harry since all the clothes he got were usually bought by his mother. But he didn’t say anything against this idea because at least they found time to talk together again.
That was the message Draco got from Harry on Tuesday and now, on Saturday, he was waiting at King’s Cross at their meeting point. There was that itch to ask what he was going to do that he needed… no, wanted Draco to be with him but on the other side, surprises were also nice, weren’t they?
Fuck. That was his end. He needed all of his damn control to not get a boner right here in that bloody studio just at the thought of Harry being pierced at those body parts. He would lie if he would say he never imagined him with jewelry like this. And thinking about it just made him fantasize more about that. Just tongue and nipples wouldn’t be enough for him, he wanted him to have more in the lower regions of his body.
Harry froze in his little rocking movements with his hips and his eyes got bigger. Even with his lust clouded mind he figured out what Draco wanted to say with that.
He took his phone out and took some pictures, from his face and also from his outfit before he came closer and played with the curls of the wig.
“No. I know I will like it. I just have to get over that certain point that holds me back. Like always.”
Harry knew he never had to fear that Draco would do something against his will. After all it was just a spell… spells can always be undone. If he would ever would feel uncomfortable Draco would be the last person who would deny him the wish to go back.
A whimper was the only answer he got and that was already enough for him. When he looked at his face he moaned slightly because his girl looked so fucked out already even before he entered him and he couldn’t imagine how he would look when he actually fucked him.
His whole body raised in this strong orgasm and a loud moan left his lips before he shook strongly. His hole tightened up around Dracos cock and he hissed in his effort to not load his cum into him right now. //Fuck…//
“Nah. Nothing I don’t already have and the Grangers really take good care of me. I don’t really need something.” He answered and looked at the paper bag in Dracos hand.
Harry sat down hesitantly and tried not to look into the mirror but Hermione already turned him towards herself and took out her make-up bag. “I have make-up that’s as fair as your skin is… Hopefully it’s not too dark after all. We’ll see.”
Harry knew what would come. If that feeling would be as intense as on his nipples he knew he couldn’t stand it for too long… He gasped loudly when Draco touched his hole and jerked violently in his bonds.
Harry opened the door back at home at around 6pm in the evening and Katherine Granger looked out of the kitchen, smiling at him.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes for a moment. The false eye lashes were itching a little bit and he had that big need to scratch himself in his face but it would smear his make-up so he tried to stay still and do nothing.
He moaned with every thrust he felt in his body and also felt how wet he was, how it literally squelched around Dracos cock and he felt even more humiliated by it. His body betrayed him right now but the feeling he experienced after that spell wasn’t something he could control in an instant so he just gave up and let him see how slutty and needy he was for him.
His voice was small in comparison to Draco, maybe because he couldn’t stop looking at him. He didn’t know when he changed that much from a boy into a young man but apparently it started and his mind and body did things to him.
Sometimes he didn’t want to lose his face in front of Crabbe and Goyle. Sometimes he was scared of his father who thought being pure blood was the most important thing and since Harry was a muggle he would despise him.
Draco went in front of the girl and looked at the boys who moved back when they recognized him. The blond-haired boy was no stranger to them or anyone in this neighborhood. Everyone knew that when he was at a place, Crabbe and Goyle both were around too and they wouldn’t have a chance against them.
to stay in contact with him. He liked him around, he liked the atmosphere that existed when they were together but at the same time he was genuinely afraid Draco would once again end everything after some time and he wasn’t sure if he could manage to overcome it for the hundredth time.
It wasn’t really heavy but it felt like there were a lot of clothes in there… He opened the bag more and blinked for a moment. Okay that looked pretty… fluffy. He couldn’t even recognize what exactly it was so he took it out and the more he saw of it the faster his heartbeat was.
The raven-haired boy sighed and started to strip before he put on the socks and dress. Now he stood in front of the mirror and looked at himself while he smoothed the fabric of the dress.
He followed Harry along the streets and quickly got the feeling that it wasn’t his first time here. He was very sure where to go and also used some short cuts before they stopped in front of a store.
The man went into the back of the shop and both boys followed him. Draco was greeted with some seats where people could sit or lie on while getting tattooed or pierced and the man pointed at one of them.
He didn’t know how the other would react to it and somehow he was afraid of what he would think about all this… in the end it was not his money he spent on those clothes but his fathers’ and that was worth it.
But every time he saw him at school he wanted to touch him, he wanted to caress his hair and wanted to hear his voice that started to get deeper just now. Meanwhile Draco grew a lot and even started to work out to get rid of his sickly image of being pale and weak with asthma problems. He was the opposite of what Harry looked like and those feelings started to show up again just by thinking about it.
It was Draco who talked to him first, just a few days after Halloween and he wasn’t prepared for this. Hermione said he shouldn’t pay attention to him but something inside of him held him back to that so he listened to what the blonde said and gave in in the end.
Now he was sitting in the park and watched people walking around in their costumes, clearly bored while doing so. Crabbe and Goyle were out there, stealing candy from kids and shoving them around but he couldn’t care less about it.
“There we are. It’s pretty popular with the girls so I hope you find the size for your girlfriend. If you need any more help you know where to find me.”
“Yeah… You… you can laugh if you want to, I must look horrible. I mean Hermione did a good job with the make-up but...”
For a moment he hesitated in his movement because while he barely ever rejects an order from him Harry was aware that Cassiopeia, their daughter was still awake and though staying in her room to do homework he knew she could show up at any time. Nothing would have been more humiliating then kneeling on the bed naked in the position Draco wanted from him and suddenly their daughter walks in… Thinking of that made him feel lucky that this surprisingly never happened until now.
“I’m thirsty. Do you want to go to the vending machine? Or… wait no, it’s probably better for to sit down because of my shoes. Just wait, I’ll be back, okay?”
And now he was standing here waiting for the older boy and had to think about Hermiones words before he left the house.
“Oh yeah, we talked on the phone. Everything’s ready. You already know the spots you want to get pierced? And do you have the permission of your parents?”
Draco shook his head and suddenly he couldn’t look at Harry enough. He couldn’t get enough of him in this outfit, how his legs looked in those cute socks and shoes, how the hair (obviously a wig) curled at his cheeks and brushed them softly, how long the false lashes were. Fuck. This outfit did something with Draco and he liked that feeling.
It was fucking cute and he couldn’t wait to see him in it. At least when he would do it which would be an entirely different thing.
Draco felt extremely bad about it and was torn between “I don’t care what others might think it’s hot for me” and “I’m so ashamed about this, it’s sick and no one can ever know”. That changed on a daily base. Right now he was more in the first state and it made him more confident about his plan.
Harry blinked and turned around and looked in Draco in front of him. “Handsome” was the first word that came into his mind while looking at him and one second later he was flustered because of it. That’s not how you describe one of your most important friends.
He could already feel a dampness around his rim and bit on his lips. No matter how degrading the demands of his husband were his body always reacted immediately to it and showed how much he liked it, especially after this little spell Draco put on him years ago. It was still humiliating but he got used to it and he knew how much Draco liked it.
Harry nodded and Draco took a seat to watch the man preparing everything before he grinned at his friend.
“Alright so what about getting some tea and hot chocolate in our café? We haven’t been there for a while.” Draco suggested and smiled at him.
The message was marked as “read” but there was no response and for a moment Draco panicked. Was he mad at him for thinking that? Maybe that was too much for him?
“Uh… I want one on my tongue and two…” The boy hesitated and looked at Draco before he lifted his shirt and showed his naked body. “Two on my nipples.”
Harry made a face while thinking back and a small sigh escaped his lips. A look at his phone told him that Draco was still in time… In fact Harry showed up earlier because he didn’t want to miss any of their… well… platonic date.
Draco said he should write him a message as soon as he opened it so he took his phone and carefully opened the bag.
He gasped when he felt Dracos finger again this time deeper then some minutes before and he pushed against it while Draco laughed again. “So greedy… don’t worry pussy, you’ll get something great. You know I’ve been thinking.” His Daddy said while pushing his finger again and again in his hole, watching as the wetness got more and more till it started to run down his legs. “You already have your tit clits haven’t you? And I know how much you like it when someone plays with it. You can come just from that…”
“I don’t know, something cute. You still have some clothes, don’t you? And maybe Granger would let you use her make-up again… Ouch!”
Now it was because Harry wouldn’t understand his feelings and Draco hated himself for having those feelings especially because he didn’t just love him, he had… thoughts about him he couldn’t explain. Harry was still so small and fragile even though he probably could eat a lot now.
It took them some stations with the tube and in the end they got out in Camden. It was not really the place Draco would visit every day, mostly because his parents would never allow it. In their eyes Camden was dirty, full of “delinquents” and shops no one needed but for him it was something new and fascinating after being used to all the very expensive stores in Diagon Alley his parents preferred. At least when it was about wizards’ clothing but there wasn’t really a difference to muggle clothes stores. As long as it was expensive and showed that you had money it was fine for his parents.
It was something they didn’t use for a long time because it wasn’t necessary anymore. Alice was trained perfectly up until now, she always knew of her position in this kind of relationship and it has been years since she had to say it the last time but the words came right out of her mouth without stuttering.
"Mistress Narcissa, it is Young Master Dracos birthday, yes?" She nods at him, smirking slightly and running her thin fingers through her hair. "Will you is be giving him protector marks, Mistress Narcissa?" She nods again while he relinquishes his bow and places the tray on the table. "Dobby will go now, Mistress Narcissa, and work the grindstone for you."
I storm off, followed by the two brutes paid to protect me, and don't have any logical thought until after I'm sat at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall. My godfather - Severus Snape - is looking at my ears, and only now do I realize I'm partway transformed. After the feast, he's going to Crucio me, I just know it. And I was right, of course.
Drunk on adrenaline, blood replenishment potions, and, of course, the alcohol from earlier, I have new courage. Boldly, I drop to my knees and shove my nose into Potter's groin, basking in his scent. Then, everything goes black.
"But - my night terrors seem to think it's still aflame!" Harry is taken aback by Dracos sudden vulnerability, and decides to hug him, eliciting a squawk of surprise from the shorter blond.
"Who do you think did it?" Pansy asks excitedly, sitting on Blaise's lap and laying over mine. I absently run my fingers through her hair, reminded of when she would cry on us after an especially horrid flying lesson at the Manor.
Next thing he knows his lips are being parted by the blond boy before him. It feels like the first time he held his wand, when the sparks flew out of it's end and everything felt right for once. He sits there, mouth open wide, eyes tight shut, for the whole of the kiss, which lasts fifteen seconds per the proctor(Pansy Parkinson, of course).
He flips me over, pushing my face into the mattress with one hand, the other presumably lining himself up. His knees go between my thighs and push to widen my stance. Wasting no time with gentle nudges, he thrusts home in just one go. The sound that wrenches itself from my throat can only be described as unholy.
Draco considers this, gazing at Potter through wide eyes. He realizes his hand is still in Dracos hair and relinquishes his grip immediately.
"Your Father is gone for now, my dragon." She pulls back and I can breathe again, suddenly free from her highly perfumed bosom. "This is a very important day, Draco." I look up at her, confused. "Your twelfth birthday, dear! Your Veela aspects are beginning to mature, darling, and soon you'll be able to take full advantage of your ancestry! Don't tell your father I said that, my dragon." She winks at me before turning to the dark oak dining table. It runs along the huge room, about two thirds the length of the House tables at school, and be fitted with white placemats for today's festivities. Dobby walks in right then, arms laden with trays of toasts, jams, cheeses, sausages, bacon, and multiple different fruit juices. He bows to us, smiling first at me before turning his grin to my mother.
Pansy must still be sleeping. Her green eyes are closed and her face is relaxed entirely. She looks... peaceful. I reach to pet Klaus with one hand, stroking Pansys hair with the other. Not wishing to disturb her slumber, I allow my mind to wander.
Mother calls me upstairs when the Parkinsons finally arrive. My wrists are sore from stirring my potion and getting swatted with the stirstick whenever I made a mistake. Pansy makes pleading eye contact with me and I know her day was just as bad as mine. We nod in greeting and scramble to my room as fast as possible while staying dignified enough that our parents won't notice.
original a/n from watt: For those of you who remember from last chapter, my mom was very sick and had been tested for COVID. Luckily, the test came back negative, but my sister had appendicitis and was rushed into emergency surgery. My oldest brother also just moved out. Life's been hectic, but I will try to maintain an upload schedule. Thanks so very much for reading, friends! Also, criticism is always welcomed and appreciated
"Master Draco?" Dobby asks, making me return my attention to him. "Your father, Master Malfoy, is plotting to hurt Harry Potter at school this year."
"Ok so Blaise and I got you a Kneazle, that bird is mine and her name is Ophelia," Pansy speaks rapidly, advancing on the young hen and scooping it into her arms.
I'm so sorry about this. Your Godfather owled to us about how often he's caught you mid-transformation, and your Father decided it best to add some Power Sedative to the sweets I made for you. Hopefully it doesn't taste too bad, darling. Please write home soon, I miss you very dearly.
original notes from watt: sorry about the song not being a Vibe Song, i just wanted to share my favorite writing soundtrack
"Yeah, Millie, allow his Highness to ponder," Daphne speaks up. "As you know, he and his stupid sheep cat is better than us all. He obviously has better things to do, such us fiddling with that page-"
"Malfoy, are you paying attention to anything I'm saying?" The Savior snaps at me, and my eyes widen in response while more blood rushes downward. I nod. "Good. Now, Adelphi used to be an Unspeakable. She studied Horcruxes, gadgets, and invented spells and potions. She's damn smart, and she uses any means possible to get her way. She has spells and potions on her side that you can't fathom..." I can't continue paying attention when he's talking like this. Despite my efforts, I'm rock hard and raring to go.
"Shut your fat face, Longbottom. My family life has nothing to do with you. Nosy Gryffindor." He nods and continues walking, not bringing it up again. I'm livid at him, teeming with rage I didn't know I could muster, and before I know it I'm grabbing him from the back, hands, no, talons red hot with fire. He shoots sparks and yelps while I catch my breath, staring wide eyed at my hands while they return to normal.
I had, of course, told Dobby all about the boy. And Pansy. And Blaise. Dobby was my favorite elf. He'd healed me after Father had Crucio'd me the first time. He'd helped us comfort Pansy when Gizzy was killed. He'd kept my secrets, and kept me safe. I told Dobby everything.
"I do - Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree." Please think I'm interesting. "Know what House you'll be in yet?" Hopefully I sound casual.
I try my hardest to focus on the jar of fairy wings on the shelf across from me, struggling to hide the pain that's fighting to show on my impassive face. Snape stands behind me, probably smirking, stroking my hair with cold, knobby fingers. He had written to Father after catching me partway transformed, and in turn got orders to trim my hair.
She sits on my bed and begins to cry - cheeks flushed, eyes red and swollen, nose running wetly into her mouth. Disgusting. But despite my wishes, I'm worried for her. Before I know it I'm sat next to her with my arm around the 8 year olds shoulder, holding her tightly to my chest.
"Oh yeah, oops. Okay," Harry breathes out, cheeks burning as he lines himself up. "I'll just, er, grab your waist. I got you," the last word turns into a question as he slides into the tight heat of Dracos arse, breaking into a moan at the insanity of it.
"Well you, uh..." He trails off, unsure how to explain. "Do you want me to walk you through it?" Harry nods, glad that at least one of them knows what the hell they're doing. "Ok, so - what type of lube is that?"
"Oh, hey, sorry," he plunders out, backing away quickly and looking worried. "Is anybody hurt?" He asks, grabbing Pansy's hand to inspect her arm before quickly releasing it, looking as though he got slapped. "I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have grabbed you. That was rude of me. Are you two okay?" We nod. "Ok, I'm glad." He smiles at us for a moment. "Oh wait-- I'm Cedric. Diggory, I mean. Hufflepuff. What's your names?"
It was dead, silver blood gleaming in a puddle around it. It was a terrible sight. A vampirelike figure came rushing out of the wood to suckle at the wound on the unicorns side and I run away screaming. Will I ever be like that?
"I don't quite like it down here," Blaise says, "makes me wanna go all gargoyle, what with all the stone." He frowns around at the slimy looking walls.
"Tell me, do I smell as good as I look, Potter?" He falters at this, and Draco seizes the chance to eye him over. His caramel skin practically gleams over his muscular form, his emerald gaze more intense than Dumbledores, his curly black hair muffed up and windswept endearingly.
Thumbing the slit and spreading the precome there, Draco gulps and tries to relax his throat. He licks the tip of Potter's glorious prick, tasting the bitter precome hesitantly, and then a large hand is pushing on the back of Dracos head until Harry's cock is completely sheathed in his throat.
"Never mind that, Potter. Adelphi did that." Then, he waves his hand over my face. The drying blood weeps off into nothingness and the cut is healed, a twin scar to Harry's.
That seems to do the trick. I get a glimpse of white scarring on the back of his right hand in the moonlight before it's placed on my neck. Potter doesn't press, or squeeze, or do anything for that matter; he just stares at me with a challenge in his eyes.
"Have you guys seen Harry or Ron?" She had asked us, voice quivering and cheeks tear stained. I almost felt bad for her.
"Oh, it's you," said Ronald angrily. "Bet you're surprised to see Harry here, eh?" I quickly come up with a rude response.
All of these are quite troubling thoughts in a briefing, however. Pressing the heel of my hand against my groin to stave off my impending erection, I try to focus on Potter's words. He's gathered up the Minister (Granger), his fellow Aurors, members from the Committee for Magical Law Enforcement, and, of course, multiple Unspeakables - such as myself.
"Draco, I know I avoided answering this question earlier," Mother begins, stirring me from my memories, "but it's only because I was afraid of my own response. Veela have a tradition, one that I will uphold." She turns to me, dropping her empty bucket and grabbing my shoulders. A young emerald hen scrambles off, frightened by the sudden noise, while the older ones hardly flinch, including an exceedingly handsome 7 year old charcoal white eye cock. "I will be giving you protectors marks, a form of tattoo that will guide you through life." She holds up her forearms, tilting them in the sun and her veins sparkled blue. Except those weren't her veins, were they?
The Mudblood, Granger, began clinging to Potter and Weasley after the incident with the troll, validating the rumor that they had fought the troll together, as she seemed to quite dislike them beforehand.
"Master Lucius wants to hurt Harry Potter! Master Malfoy wishes to corrupt-" he starts, breaking off into shrieking sobs that shake my bed.
"No, er.... How do I put this? He... I'm not sure it's my place to say this, but I think I have to? Neville is an asexual, meaning he doesn't experience sexual attraction? That's why he's my Feeder. I have my meal, he passes out and wakes up with spunk in his trousers and I run off to wank somewhere. That way we don't have to deal with sex... Stuff." He glances shyly to the blond, who looks up at him thoughtfully.
"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been - imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" I hardly breathed in my explanation, he has me so damn flustered.
"Crucio," he whispers. Bellatrix shrieks again, more tears flowing out of her bloodshot eyes. Andromeda jumps out from behind the couch and screams at their father. He does not relent. He continues to torture his eldest daughter. It must be good for her. It must be.
Draco shoves Harry against the wall, bending slightly to meet their lips together. He reaches out to hold Harry's face, and Harry links his arms around Dracos neck.
Ripping the necklace off in one swift yank that breaks the chain, she holds the vial to her nose and sniffs heartily, pupils blown. I can't help but wonder what it smells like to her.
"Tomato?" Potter tilts his head in question and Dracos grin grows ever wider. "Eggplant?" Draco shakes his head. "Lettuce."
Warrington - a Slytherin prefect - herded us all back to the commons, Blaise Pansy and I running to my dorm. The dorms always looked worse than they were. According to legend, if any non-Slytherin entered our common room, it would feel miserably cold and stuffy. As if anyone in their right mind could get in here.
Sparks fly from his fingertips and singe the hair on my back. His wandless will probably leave welts. But, Merlin, it's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. The last time I come I end up blacking out entirely.
"Mother, what does he mean by protector marks? And aren't grindstones used to make flour?" She ignores my questions entirely, slathering raspberry jam on some sourdough before fixing me a look as if to say 'well dig in, now. what are you waiting for?' and I oblige, only just realizing how hungry I was. I fill my plates with a mountain of food, turning to Mother as a question enters my mind, "Do I have to eat more, now that the Veela part of me is maturing?" She nods and gestures for me to continue eating.
Tears are streaming out of my eyes now as I think about everything I'll miss. Astoria is pregnant, and I was hoping to be a better father than mine. I hope she'll be alright without me. Except she won't be. Her disease is progressing faster than ever and she chose me, despite her family's wishes. She chose me as the person she wanted to live out the rest of her short life with. And I never made a move on Potter, not even after he and the Weaslette broke up. Not even when Astoria said she'd be welcome to having him join our relationship. I never attended Father's funeral, even though Mother had begged me for weeks, postponing his burial for my convenience.
"That's disturbing," he drawls out before turning to face him, and, fuck, Potter filled out amazingly.
"So? How is it?" I whisper into the suddenly serene silence surrounding us before ripping her blade from my thigh and wrenching it at her.
He also knew that they had to train again because there was possibly no way Alice could hold back herself from cumming right on the spot with these sensations and he would enjoy it.
“I bet no one will recognize you when you’re out there as Red Riding Hood. Everyone will think you’re a pretty girl. It’s something different don’t you think? Here’s your basket.”
“God baby look at your pussy. It’s soaking wet… I love it when it looks like this. You’re such a slut.”
Malfoy leans back and up, looking to Harry incredulously. His brow furrows when the wizarding world's Golden Boy doesn't respond.
"HOLY MOTHERFUCK!" Potter exclaims, jumping up and splashing a very offended Draco in his haste. "Why - did I - are you?"
The morning of June fifth, I'm woke by Mother's gentle voice calling up the stairs, dripping sweetness.
"Will it be, er, on fire?" Draco shuffles his feet and grabs his elbows, scared of returning to the site of his friends death.
"Leave him alone, he didn't want all that!" Yells a ginger girl I haven't seen before, obviously the youngest Weasley.
Fear. It seems to be the only thing I know. It's always held me in its talons, ripping into my flesh with each feeble attempt to escape it. Fear. It's the driving force behind most of my actions. It only seems to grow stronger with each passing day. Fear. It commands the voices in my head stating "What comes next will be worse" each and every time I receive good news. It's trickling through my mind, my veins, my heart as though it owns me. Fear. It's constant chaos echoes throughout my entire existence. It has always been with me, and it always will be. Fear. Maybe it made me.
"Blaise says you came running in at around three a.m., and wouldn't say anything." She holds me in a vicelike grip, enlarged yellow eyes glaring at me between curtains of iridescent green hair. "I heard you mumbling in your sleep when I came in here. Did you burn Longbottom?"
"Wait, so you and Longbottom.... ?" Draco lets his silver eyes travel to Neville, landing on Harry and going back again. Harry scratches his neck, clearly uncomfortable.
Great. He followed her for nothing. Now he had to get back to collect Crabbe and Goyle to go home because there was no way he would wait here just to see two girls chatting with each other.
Several time afterwards they finally left the house and started to collect candy in Harrys basket before they entered the park in their neighborhood. Children were running around with their costumes, playing together and laughing.
“Uhm… okay? Promise.” Harry said and nodded while taking the bag and looking at it. This was kind of weird but alright he would follow Dracos orders.
Draco moaned at the sight of it and had to sit down on his bed to calm down. Harry looked stunning in it.
“Come on don’t act rude. You all act like you’re innocent but in the end everyone of you wants a boy.”
Harry screamed when the second orgasm hit him and shivered again while his hole clamped down on Dracos cock, locking him and Draco moaned while his thrusts got harder.
“Now you’re the most perfect girl for me… all wet and ready and needy for Daddy. Now you’re not only coming from your tit clits but also you really can come like a girl when she’s teased on her clit. But you do know we can’t let the happen every time I fuck you don’t you? You have to work on your pussy again so you don’t come without permission. This time it’s an exception because the spell is new and you’re not used to it. But after that I expect you to train your pussy. You’re my hole to use don’t forget that.”
“Uhm… I wanted to apologize for being a dick in the last couple of weeks. Also for being a dick and saying mean things when I didn’t mean it.” Draco said now and smiled a little while taking a deep breath. Apologizing to the one who meant the most to him was more complicated than he thought and he really hoped Harry would believe him.
Throughout the dinner he was unconcentrated and it was hard to distract himself from that bloody bag in his room. As soon as everything was finished and he was done helping in the kitchen he bolted back into his room ignoring Hermione who called after him. He carefully closed the door and thought for a moment before he also locked it up. Just to be safe… He wanted that moment all alone without anyone coming in without a warning.
Lucius was very strict about the clothing rules in the Malfoy household. No t-shirts, nearly no jeans, everything had to be very formal to stand out of the masses and the only colors allowed were white, black and emerald green for whatever reason. He remembered when he was shopping with the Grangers shortly after they took him out of the Dursley household and saw Draco standing in front of a shelf full of t-shirts. He remembered his longing look in his eyes and when his father called he immediately stepped back and went away. Although Harry knew how much Draco loved to just let go, he couldn’t imagine him with ripped up jeans and a simple t-shirt and sneakers now.
Upon returning to school, I find myself having a much shorter fuse. I cursed Longbottom on my way out the library, I fought with the Weasel during the second Quidditch match, I followed the Trio to Hagrids hut, and, looking through the window, I am able to witness a dragon hatching, but I'm caught, and I sprint back to the castle to tell Snape. Maybe I can get rewarded for once.
Pansy notices Theo glaring at my new, unnamed Kneazle from her spot at the window seat. I pat my leg to make it come closer, and it bounds across the bed from Theo's place at my pillow to mine at the foot of the green sheeted bed.
Suddenly, the tallest Weasley pops out of the wall, closely followed by the twins. Then the She-Weasel and her mother, then-
She draws back to gaze into my eyes again. Horrorstruck, I'm frozen in time, hardly registering the pain in my leg where I just got fucking stabbed.
The others showed up, but to my surprise it isn't Weasley, Granger and Potter, but rather Granger, Potter, and Longbottom. Perfect. Filch leads the four of us down to Hagrids ghastly hut, outlined by the edge of the foreboding Forbidden Forest, telling us about how repercussions should be much harsher. Hagrid splits us into two groups and explains how he wants us to find an injured unicorn.
I spot him, sitting in the front row, just in time to see him hop up with a gentle smile plastered to his lips. He takes the stool from Bulstrode, pulling it out from under her rather than pushing her off. He's blond, plays Keeper for our Quidditch team, and one of few Muggleborns in our House. Unfortunately, he's also quite attractive.
"Clearly," Father lets his gaze wander to what look to be Granger's Muggle parents, and it's obvious what he is implying. "The company you keep, Weasley... And I thought your family could sink no lower-"
This time, however, Harry is the one to deepen the kiss. He darts his tongue into Dracos mouth - feeling extremely anxious in doing so - and Draco responds beautifully. Wrapping Harry's legs around his lean hips, he pushes the shorter boy against the wall. It's almost like a dance, kissing is. An art form, really.
"Theo says that if you didn't care about him you wouldn't have gone against Lucius' wishes and tried to warn him. Theo also says to stop looking at him." Theodore's great great grandmother was an Augurey, and he had many of the traits that the Irish Phoenix's were known for.
“How does it feel? You still feel bad about letting me put that spell on you? Your body seems to think otherwise… it looks like you’re bursting.” Draco teased him between his powerful thrusts and just drew another moan from his husbands’ lips. His fingers left red bruises on his skin where he hold onto because even when he didn’t want to admit he was on the edge of losing control over his body. Man that was the best idea he could have had.
The world wide web was a big help in this and it didn’t take long for Draco to find some sites where he could share his thoughts and experience with others just to find a name for what he liked and with that he started to look at pictures but not everything about it was his taste. He rather liked to look at fragile men who had that slightly female touch in their body shape and their face. Just like Harry had.
One look at Draco said him it was all worth it. He just knew. Though he couldn’t imagine it he just knew in the end he would like it.
Draco was tired to follow those two girls around. All they did was collecting candy and talking to each other while walking and he really asked himself if he would ever see Harry this evening.
It took Harry a while to come down from this intense feeling and even when he could think clearer again he could still feel that dull throb inside him and on his hole. He never experienced an orgasm as strong as this one. It was like he was swept off of his feet but of course Draco didn’t wait. While he was still floating on a post orgasm cloud he could feel how his Daddy continued to thrust into him, holding him on this special little cloud he loved so much. Everything else wasn’t important the only thing that mattered was Draco in him, his words and his commands.
With one snap of Dracos wand the ropes disappeared and he kissed Harry with intensity before he looked at him softly, caressing his cheek. “Everything okay…?”
Once again he moaned and closed his eyes when Draco thrusted two fingers into him, played with his hole and he could feel how wet he already was, how eager his body was to please him in any way he wanted.
It was extreme, even for him. He could live with getting wet like a woman (no need for lube after all) because after some time of adjusting he really enjoyed it being even more of a girl but would it be okay to change like that?
“Okay…. So… what we’re doing? You said you wanted to go shopping? But I thought your mother would always do these things.”
A frustrated sigh left his lips before he closed his eyes for a second and went down the alley between the clothing racks. While he was on the tube he went to their online site and screenshotted all the clothes he wanted to buy just so he didn’t have to search between all those chatty girls who now started to look at him.
It took a while but suddenly a new message popped up and once again Dracos heart beat faster. He took his phone and looked at the message, had to smile a little. That was a moment of success.
What did he do with him? Something about this outfit, about this attitude changed him. He couldn’t explain what it was but he knew he couldn’t get enough of this and he clearly…
“I’m searching for some clothes and I can’t find them but according to your website you have them here in store.”
And just when both of them thought everything was perfect Draco just came up with another idea. While he trained Harry he thought it should be important to meet other people who also have the same dynamic in their relationship and so they got to know a lesbian couple and Draco realized how arousing it must be for women to get touched on their clit and it would be a shame that Harry wasn’t able to feel it and also react like a real girl. Harry was reluctant when Draco made him his suggestions but after all he trusted him. He knew his Daddy would never do something against his will and his consent and so he agreed.
Buying underwear was one thing he wanted to buy but the other one was something that wasn’t so easy. Ever since he met Harry as Red Riding Hood on Halloween that picture never left his head and also not his cellphone.
Draco smiled at her and waited till she disappeared before he looked through all the stuff. He wasn’t really sure about Harrys size right now but he was half of Dracos body size at any rate. Maybe because Draco started doing sports and weight lifting some time ago but Harry have been always smaller than him and kind of petite. He liked the difference, especially after Halloween.
McGonagall replied modestly, "Well enough. They were my students and we were also on the same side during the war. I hope you never experience it, but war tends to bring out one's core character." McGonagall directed Harriet back to the page, "Your mother was a prefect and also head girl. As I told you, she was a very capable witch. Bright, hard working, and had a tremendously good heart. She really was the best of us in a way."
Still, this was all fantastic news. Her father couldn't bar their friendship, even if it involved Hermione. The prestige was too great. After getting in a few more wacks, Harry, the beast, only laughing at it all, Draco exclaimed with quite a bit of wonder, "No one in the Malfoys has had an audience with the Flamels for generations. Father will be thrilled!"
She gave them a sharp glare and then a curt nod before walking away at a near silent clip. They both sat back down meekly resuming much quieter than before.
The lot of them, which was difficult to keep track of who was related to who and in which way, had already proven generous and kind, and though Harriet knew she should probably have been trying to observe whatever unique cultural differences their family had to absorb whatever "Indian-ness" was, she had a hard time looking past the Patils just being a good, generous, and occasionally chaotic family.
This pleased the woman as she had a wide smile before dismissing them with a short word to the twins that Harriet supposed meant "Now, go on. Shoo!"
She really was such a failure. She was a failure as an heir. What Malfoy associates with Muggleborns? Whether they were wrong or not, she was breaking tradition. But oh how she wished she could explain. And Harry! She was going to lose Harry! Why couldn't her father see just how important Harry was to her?! And now she was going to lose her. She really was a failure.
Hermione said, "You may not believe me, but I get it. I wasn't always brave. But there came a point in my life where I had to decide to face my fears and live a genuine life, the life I want and I know is best for me and without regrets, or whether I spend the rest of my life in fear, safer but always desiring a different way.
Draco's father's eyes narrowed and Draco's breath caught in her throat, he asked, Harry seeming not to realize the danger, "Hermione. Who is this Hermione? Is she a Half-blood?"
"Just shows how utterly brainless you are. You just can't handle my level of wit and charm," Malfoy put her hand under her chin and her nose in the air. Such a pompous princess.
It had been about half a century since Nicholas Flamel had last visited Hogwarts. With the startling speed of the world shifting around him, it appeared that the view of the castle had remained relatively unchanged. It was oddly refreshing. He spotted his student, the once fresh faced boy with bright blue eyes, who absorbed his lessons with rapt attention, now standing at the open gates in expectation was an old man. Though he was still just as flamboyant, dramatic, and a touch mischievous.
Parvati said, "Accidental magic is usually tied with strong emotions, and generally either simple spells or something very personal in its more complex. My first accidental magic was when Padma got lost and everyone was worried and upset. I knew where she was and able to give my parents direction. The equivalent of a direct-me spell, though tied to a person, my twin, rather than a location."
Draco couldn't remember the taste of her breakfast after that. She could hear her mother distantly telling Harry to go find the broom shed, and that Draco would only be a while, as she walked to her father's study and her doom.
I can't wait until this election business is over. Thankfully me and my family are use to covid standards and not leaving the house. Yay for not leaving the house!
As her father closed the wooden door to the study with an intimidating click, he spun around, "You, Draco, are a disappointment."
"So it turns out Malfoy was the one that chucked something into your cauldron. Professor Snape saw there were some ingredients on her station that shouldn't be there."
"Oh, I did, didn't I. Hmm…" and Lavender proceeded to launch into a thrilling story about the siblings managing to get passage on a steamboat heading north by Reed glamouring himself as white man passing as Ruth's owner, peddling her fortune telling skills. They laughed at some of the more humorous fortunes Ruth gave to customers and went silent in expectation as they heard about when the two literally had to jump ship as the magical authority got wind of Ruth's accurate predictions.
Draco had put on her typical dignified expression, which was still marred with that pillow imprint, "Thank you, Hermione. I'll give Lavender my gratitude later."
This was a lot to process, but mostly Harriet thought about how they'll have classes with the other houses. Harriet hoped she wouldn't have to interact much with Draco Malfoy, or even worse, Zacharias Smith.
He said one final thing before exiting, almost off-hand. His temper had run its course, "And, Draco. Don't be a further disappointment. While the Potter brat is here you might as well be a good host. We wouldn't want rumors to spread of the Malfoys being less than hospitable." And the door shut closed.
Harriet had received some fancy Belgium chocolates from Pansy, a hand carved wooden whistle from Hagrid, more sweets and toffee from Lavender, a book on Wizarding families of Britain with muggle post it notes marking what was likely Harriet's relatives from Hermione, a soft and warm blue scarf from Milly, and a large crate that Harriet didn't know whether to be touched or offended that held half a year's supply of her grandfather's hair potion from Draco.
There was screaming and chaos by most of the students, particularly the Gryffindor boys, the headmaster and teachers enforced order and delegated prefects to lead students back to their dorms.
Draco practically pouted, "I wish I could. I know Father doesn't like muggleborns but Hermione is brilliant. Yes, there are things she misses culturally speaking, but she's respectful and talented and has shown a willingness to learn our ways."
"Ahem, a few more words now that you have all been victualed. An announcement to first years and reminder to others that the forest is forbidden. Quidditch trials will be held next week and any second years or older should contact Madam Hooch. Also that our caretaker Mr. Filch has a substantial list of rules and regulations posted on his office door that he encourages students to peruse at their leisure. Finally, the third floor corridor on the right side is forbidden this year, and should not be entered unless you wish to die painfully."
Hermione was happy to perform spells for both of them, as they had to follow the decision of their leader. Thankfully it wasn't too awkward as Hermione only took a few seconds for each of them.
As much as she hated the old bat, Dumbledore questioned Draco's loyalty, in that she would have to choose between supporting the Dark Lord and Harry, sat with her also. Obviously Dumbledore believed he wasn't truly gone or why would that be a question in the first place? Though there was always talk outside the family of their loyalties to the Dark Lord, but Father always got that odd pinched look anytime someone very rudely mentioned such things. There was obviously a story her parents weren't telling her, but she understood that it likely was difficult to tell a child such things. Maybe now that she was off at Hogwarts, they would see how mature she was and let her know what really happened.
I know we've had a lot of conversations and very little action, but here's another chapter of just that!
Lavender said from her spot on the floor, "Now that that's sorted, you're missing out on cucumber time. You're the one, Hermione, who said we should do the muggle cucumber."
Also the peas and potatoes in béchamel is an Easter tradition in my family. It's super delicious and quite fattening. One of the first ingredients in making a béchamel sauce is a whole stick of butter...
Ron said, "But Peeves usually works alone. You can suggest things to him, but he's a loose cannon, that one. Never quite know what he's going to do." Ron paused and then added, "Well, unless you're Fred and George, but those two are practically poltergeists themselves."
Not that Harry herself exactly lived up to the hype...well sort of. She was innately ridiculously powerful. It practically oozed out of her tiny frame. People can't help but be drawn to her. She didn't have any real control of her magical core, but if she ever learned, she'd be absolutely fearsome.
Well at least she had accomplished her goal of getting Peeves to do her dirty work. Harriet moved quickly back to the Great Hall in hopes of catching the action, purposefully suppressing all thought of the disgusting concept of actually feeling affection for Draco effing Malfoy. Horrible. She swore she would never think of such a thing ever again. Ugh. Her?? Gross. Liking her of all people. No. She would never even imagine it again. Ugh! HER! Terrible.
Draco hummed and then remembered that she was already contemplating what sort of evil would be weak but also desperate enough to even think of using such a horrible method of preservation, "That would explain the unicorns!"
Harry laughed a bit, in better humor, "Actually the reason I hated you so much was you did your whole," she waved her hand vaguely, "pretentious thing and insulted him at Madam Malkin's. You sounded just like my Aunt Petunia."
Up in the air, looking down on the pond and folly built by Draco's great great great uncle Wilburforth, she felt it a little easier to breathe. To pretend like the last few minutes hadn't happened at all.
Ron shrugged, still smiling, "Well if they're out there, they deserve an award. Special services to society at large."
The quiet “Thank You, Daddy” brought him back to the presence after dwelling in the past and he smiled a little, gave Harry a smack on his ass before his hand caressed the skin once again. Not once did Harrys hands leave his position around those cheeks and his little hole twitched at the touch. He could see the wet spots around the rim and without hesitation he rubbed his finger over the skin, felt the wetness and licked his lips. He pushed his thumb into him and a little sigh left his lips along with one from Harry who spread his legs even more to present himself to him.
It wasn’t the first time he broke up their relationship but at least his fourth. Sometimes he was afraid of what people would think when he would hang out with a poor kid who didn’t have parents and didn’t even live with his relatives but with foster parents (the Grangers then adopted him when he was 13).
“I’m Daddys good girl. Good girls don’t come before Daddy. Good girls wait till Daddy gives them permission. Good girls are there to take not to give. I’m just a hole to use for Daddy.”
The girl blinked and Draco could see panic in her – no his eyes when he realized that Draco recognized him.
Harry smiled and Draco nodded, kissed him on the forehead. Even though they came this far in all the body modifications he did on Harry he always asked and make sure the other one was okay with it because after all he was the person he loved the most. It looked like he didn’t have a say in anything that was going on in their life because of his delicate position but that was not true. He never ignored what he said and they decided everything together just like it should be done in a healthy relationship.
Draco took the underwear he wanted and entered the section for young females and was overwhelmed. He didn’t have a sister or a female friend so he was never in here and suddenly it was packed with girls and female teenagers who giggled and walked around trying clothes. Absolutely different from what happened in the boy clothes section.
Draco paid everything and then went back to pick Harry up who was just strolling around and looking at clothes.
Draco gave his girl a stern look but he was bursting with arousal internally. He couldn’t wait to finally get his cock into her to feel her and to see how she went crazy with all those emotions coming from that change.
“Oh Alice don’t look at me like that. You’re behaving like I just told you something really bad.” Draco rolled his eyes at that and gave Harry a smack on his inner thighs, making him jerk once again.
He could hear his phone buzzing and immediately took at it, looked at the message and grinned. That wasn’t as bad as he feared. He could work with that.
Harry looked honestly surprised before he also blushed and looked away. He really did that? For what?
The look of the blond man got more excited while he rubbed over the pierced nipple with his other hand, drawing a moan from the other one. Harrys hole immediately tightened up with it and got even wetter. He knew that it must feel amazing because often enough his little girl got her orgasms when someone played with it… it must be really intense and he never regretted it one minute to put that spell on her.
But suddenly they stopped moving and Hermione talked to the other girl who was saying something and then just stood there. She looked like she was waiting for Hermione to come back and Draco looked away to follow Hermiones hair that disappeared between other people.
The boy was sitting in front of a full-length mirror leaning against his bed while his legs were pulled a little bit closer to his body so you could perfectly see the little cat paws on his socks. The pumpkin pants fit perfectly as well as the sweater. God damn it and he had sweater paws. That was the cutest thing he ever saw on someone. Also this was the first time he could have a better look at his legs and they were so delicate, just like a girl, the socks just pointed that out further.
He didn’t even try to send him a message because at this point he was so fed up with it he wasn’t sure if he wanted their friendship back at all. All he wanted to do was to sit at home and to read something to NOT think about the blonde but obviously Hermione had other plans for them.
For some reason Harry stuck to Hermione more than usual mostly because he didn’t know how he should behave in this costume. Everyone was looking at him but it was not with a questioned look more like… they were interested in him and his outfit.
“If he doesn’t turn up don’t come back and cry about it. I already told you multiple times that he isn’t good for you and I’m not changing my opinion about him. If he would really like you he wouldn’t constantly end your friendship.”
Harry turned in an instant and was on his back within seconds, spread his legs once again and Draco smiled, took his wand and muttered a spell. Ropes appeared and wrapped around Harrys hands to bind him to the bed and Draco sat between his legs, spread them even more to have a perfect look at him. His hands once again wandered over his body and disappeared under his cock, played with his piercings and pulled on them to tease him.
Just when Draco wanted to go back he noticed two guys going down the path where the red hooded girl was standing and they clearly looked at her with lots of interest but it somehow itched him in the wrong places. And though he couldn’t stand female persons he also couldn’t ignore what would probably happen now so he caught up with them right in the moment when one of them started to talk to her.
“Look at you… my perfect little girl.” Draco muttered and walked up to the bed. His fingers caressed Harrys back and played with his perfect long wavy hair that spread over the naked skin before he moved along his back with his fingertips, soaking in his sight. He never got tired of seeing him like this. Every step Harry took for him and with him to change himself in the one he was today was in Dracos memories.
A tattoo on that soft, white skin? That would ruin a lot in his mind. It was not like he didn’t like tattoos, but the imagination of Harry having tattoos was… odd.
Draco was walking around in his room at that time because he couldn’t wait to get a message. At this point he didn’t even care if it would be positive or negative he just wanted to know if he opened the bag.
It was almost as if his mouth had a will of his own but he wanted to see more… More of a flustered Harry, how he lowered his eyes and stepped from one leg to the other just to get rid of his shame.
“It’s not complicated. He always hurts you, every time he does something like this. You’re sad and you’re hurt and I can’t tolerate this. So please… please come with me. It would be a change you know? Going out, having fun? With me?”
It was unusual for him to wear high heeled shoes (at least for him it was high heeled) and sometimes he tripped but Hermione was always there to help him. They hold hands the whole time to not lose themselves in the crowd when suddenly the girl went still and turned to him.
