“Yes, yes, Potter, completely fine.”
it is that they’re doing.
A week later, Harry was once again sitting on the sofa studying, pretending not to be aware of Malfoy being in the shower. The only reason he was sitting here was because it was more comfortable than sitting on his bed, and anyway, he had just sort of ended up here when he got home and noticed the bathroom was occupied.
“What do you mean?”
“Well I didn’t… I didn’t tell them it was you, but… I guess they’ll find out soon enough anyway, right?”
Now Harry was confused again. “Rejection? What rejection?”
every
“Draco?”
“That is none of your business, Potter. And so what if I have? I refuse to be kink shamed by Mr Vanilla.”
All your life, for as long as you can remember, you’ve been inside your head, always analysing, contemplating, observing. But the time you spend with Harry is the first time you’re in your body, the only time you’re truly present.
“For… for reacting that way when you confided in me,” you say, casting your eyes down in embarrassment.
Harry snorts and a single tear slides down his cheek. Draco lets his hand move from Harry’s hair to wipe it away, cupping Harry’s cheek. It’s unexpectedly comforting to comfort Harry.
“Good. And I would like to add, and this is not my professional opinion but my own personal one: would the two of you please be so kind as to work on your communication? I know it feels like you’re out of the woods now, but I’ve talked enough with Miss Parkinson and from what I understand you’re both thick headed like trolls. Don’t let it ruin something good, okay?”
“What’s so damn funny, Hermione?” Ron said. “Harry just told us he’s — nope, no, I can’t say the words, it’s too appalling.”
“Why, Potter, so nice of you to offer,” Malfoy said and stretched out his hand.
“I would assume, based on the nature of this place, that we need to share it, yes.”
He felt incredibly pleased with himself as he cut up some oranges to make himself freshly squeezed juice, but his mood was instantly ruined by footsteps descending the stairs. He knew those footsteps, knew all too well who they belonged to. And sure enough, a moment later Malfoy entered the kitchen, dressed in a tank top and grey joggers that hung low on his hips, exposing the skin just above the waistband as he moved.
him,” she said, fixing Potter with her stare.
When you’re finished, you can’t help but stay beside his bed to look at him for a moment. He looks so peaceful now, like the pain has subsided. Unconsciously, you reach out a hand to stroke his forehead, and that’s when he opens his eyes for the first time.
to do better.
You can’t let it happen again. This must be your ordeal of fire, this must be the Tempter testing you. It’s laughable how you always imagined it would be so simple, an obvious temptation, like a sumptuously rich meal tantalising you. But of course, He doesn’t work in those obvious ways, does he? Of course you were to be lured in gradually, so you wouldn’t notice until it was too late. Well, it’s not too late now, you’re on guard now, and you can’t,
“What—?” Harry starts, but Draco props himself up on the bed, reaching out for Harry to take his hand.
He hasn’t even mentioned Harry’s name, and yet your body responds immediately. You gulp for air, feeling like you haven’t breathed for a long time, like you’ve forgotten how to. “I do,” you choke out, fighting back the tears that threaten to spill on your cheeks.
Harry blushes and sets the tray down, crawling into bed again after a quick assessing look at Goodwin. She purses her lips like she’s about to tell him off, but her eyes are kind.
It’s funny how you can regret something while you’re still in the middle of doing it.
Draco opened his mouth to defend himself, but then saw the smirk on Kingsley’s face and pouted instead. “Low blow, Minister.”
significant than a message for people to stay at home and keep distance?!). I flipped him off but he just snorted at me and turned away. I think he muttered something like “Honestly, Potter, how big can your head get?”
When he steps out onto the pavement the air is crisp and he inhales deeply, closing his eyes. He’ll be fine, he thinks, turning his face upwards. He’ll get over this, he always does, one way or the other. The only thing gnawing on him is Draco and his illness, and he wishes that he was able to do something to help him. He should try to find out who it is that Draco loves and bring them to him, make them see what their ignorance is doing to him.
This is so much worse than when he thought he was going to die initially, because it was one thing suspecting what was wrong with him (or knowing, really) and what the outcome would be. But to have it stated to him in no uncertain terms, and on top of that having a lifeline thrown at him only to be yanked away again, makes him feel like he’s been hit by a Bludger. Repeatedly.
“So, what, we’d be bonded permanently? For real?”
“I… Ipaidthecrewtoputusinthesameroom.”
The other day I sucked him off. Just like that. We were talking about everything and nothing and I might’ve been a little bit drunk, but I told him that I’ve thought of what it would be like to give someone a blow job. And he said “Well if you ever get too curious I’m right here.” I mean it was obviously a joke, so I joked back, something like if he wasn’t afraid I’d accidentally bite him. And he said “Scared, Potter?” and I said “You wish”, and then I just pulled his pants down and pressed my lips to his cock. It was… shit… he went from half hard to full erection in
Forty-five excruciating minutes later, when Draco was practically begging Harry to either fuck him or let him come, the quill began recording movement outside their room. They were too wrapped up in each other to notice and Draco’s scream echoed through the hall when Harry finally pushed in, reducing their interaction to solely moans and curses.
You can’t answer, you’re too focused on his fingers circling you, on the sensation as one of them breaches you.
He gently takes your wrist to pull your hand closer, brushing it lightly with his thumb before inhaling deeply with closed eyes. It tickles, but something else happens to you, something begins to stir deep inside, uncoiling, and you draw a sharp breath that makes him look up at you, his green eyes even more piercing behind his glasses, his gaze so much sharper. He lets go of your hand as if burned.
Even though everything in him screamed that this was some sort of trap, Harry took Malfoy’s hand, slowly, and braced himself. But Malfoy seemed to have changed his mind, because he remained sitting. Confused, Harry relaxed, and that’s when Malfoy yanked his arm, making him lose his balance and fall straight into Malfoy’s lap, straddling him. Harry gasped as Malfoy’s burgeoning erection came into contact with his own cock, and Malfoy looked like the cat that got the cream.
“This smells exactly like the one I used to have. Or, well,” he said, taking another whiff, “not quite the same. Did you add horsetail to it?”
“Harry? What are you doing here?”
“You never answered Pansy’s question.”
“Well, you have to understand that this is all very hypothetical because we haven’t gone through with many cases this severe. But the roots go deep and are an integral part of your body now, so in the very unlikely event that you do survive, removing them will leave you empty, to be blunt, which will affect your bodily functions such as breathing, circulation and mobility.”
Scurrying around hotel grounds early in the morning with an ache throughout his entire body wasn’t Draco’s ideal post-cotial routine. He wasn’t sure it was Harry’s either, but here they were.
“Merlin’s fucking ballsack, Draco, it’s not a marriage proposal! I’m just asking to stay the fucking night because sometimes it’s nice not having to sneak off like a thief in the dark, or because it’s nice to just drift off after amazing sex, however bloody
“What? What’s so funny?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
would do.”
“I’m really sorry!” Harry said, knowing it wouldn’t help one bit.
He squeezes past you to examine the fireplace, and you try hard not to notice the scent of him drifting to your nostrils, heightened by the dampness.
“Yes, well, no one could object to
You look down, trying to swallow around the lump in your throat. “That’s… that’s not something for me to have.”
“You know, I’ve never understood art or cultural stuff like that,” Potter said tentatively. “And especially not Luna’s art, to be honest.”
“Well I… At the Manor… And now… I mean…” He’d never been expected to learn how to cook. He’d been expected to live at the Manor for the rest of his life, inheriting the house elves and never having to cook for himself. And when he’d decided to move into his own apartment with Pansy, she had done most of the cooking, while he had resorted to pay for takeout.
to collect evidence rather than fight someone?
I took a walk with Ron and Hermione on my hour spent outside, and Ron mentioned the time in school when Hermione used to knit a lot of hats for the house elves. We didn’t go into that in depth because it’s still a touchy subject for Hermione, but it made me think that maybe I should take up knitting? Only to have something to do.
“It didn’t feel wrong,” he tells you quietly, and deep down you agree, but you can’t tell him that, can’t voice that thought out loud, because who knows where you’d end up then.
“No it’s not. Look, I have the key and everything.”
“Right. Well, I guess there’s nothing more to say except a warm welcome to Mr Malfoy,” Harry said, taking a seat behind his desk and sending Draco an encouraging nod and a wink.
to be unprofessional.”
Harry made an involuntary and highly embarrassing sound, which made Malfoy look at him with a smirk.
Harry squeezes Draco closer, kissing him on the neck. “I liked it a lot too,” he whispers, and Draco relaxes into his embrace. Harry lets his lips brush Draco’s skin again, smiling when Draco
He knows he should’ve, knows he’s hurt her by not being honest, because they usually tell each other everything. Or, well, almost everything. She still doesn’t know about him and Potter and their agreement. At least he doesn’t think she does.
A whimper escapes Harry before he’s able to rein it in, and Draco lets out a self satisfied huff, his breath hot against Harry’s neck as he presses himself even closer, grinding his hips slightly. Harry’s fingers are trembling as he starts unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, the pale skin warm and soft underneath the luxurious fabric. Draco doesn’t do anything to aid him, he just keeps running his hands slowly up and down Harry’s back, sliding them under the waistline of his trousers to squeeze his arse again, making Harry moan embarrassingly loudly. Draco chuckles before pulling Harry’s earlobe into his mouth, and suddenly it’s all too much: the warmth of Draco’s body, his crotch coming into contact with Harry’s, the alluring scent of him filling Harry’s nostrils. All it takes is for Draco’s tongue to tickle the shell of Harry’s ear, and without being able to help it, having been at the edge for so long, Harry comes in his pants like a bloody teenager.
it would because you used the
“Mate. I
“You know very well that that’s a yes.”
“What are you —? We didn’t —”
Harry nodded. “Okay, let’s just get this over with and find out what we can.”
I’d had to have done something wrong or stupid for wanting to make his favourite food (not entirely wrong though). So, I told him. I told him how I’ve noticed that I’ve wanted to kiss him for quite some time now, and how I’m pretty positive that I’m not as straight as I thought I was, and that I can’t stop thinking about him because I’m most probably definitely in love with him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I don’t know what to do to fix this thing with Draco. He’s still acting weird around me, and I think I’m acting weird around him too. We haven’t even had sex for about a week now because things have been so awkward, and while I kind of miss that, I know I can live without it, if I could just be with Draco like we were before. I miss him. Or what we had, how he used to be around me. I can’t believe I let sex come between me and a friend, and never in my life would I have thought that I’d let it happen with a male friend.
“Um, yeah, I know, it’s just… there’s an emergency?”
You have trouble falling asleep, and when you finally do, you have dreams of him. He’s standing a bit away from you and every time you try to reach him he disappears further and further away.
come as a surprise to either of you? Have you both forgotten about sixth year?”
It turned out to be the latter. When Harry turned around, Draco was standing in the bathroom doorway, his anger emanating off him in waves and Harry was surprised there wasn’t a thundercloud over his head.
They decided to eat outside. Ebba told them that the weather was usually unpredictable this time of year, but since they had a roof over their veranda, they decided to risk it.
Harry ends up staying for hours, sitting bent over on that uncomfortable chair and talking, talking, talking. Pansy sticks her head in occasionally, but Draco just waves her off, which makes her give him very stern looks, which in turn only prompts him to glower at her, all of it making Harry very confused. Harry’s voice becomes hoarse as they switch from sarcastic barbs to topics deep as trenches, and Draco only has the energy to whisper from time to time, his voice brittle and dry. And it’s both comforting and heartbreaking, getting to know each other for real. It’s the first time they’ve bothered to really talk about themselves, and it’s so ironic that Draco lying on his deathbed is what made them drop their masks. For the first time Harry realises how much he’ll lose and what he could’ve had if just one thing in this mess was different.
“Are we—? What is—?
Draco blinks several times, his bottom lip disappearing between his teeth, and Harry is sure that he’s trying to hold back some sort of massive telling off. And then, Draco’s mouth stretches into a wet, big grin, before he starts laughing. It’s a deep, belly shaking kind of laughter, and it sounds so odd to Harry, he hasn’t heard Draco laugh for what feels like
He kisses along the length of your spine as he slowly works you open with his fingers.
make sure Draco got his share of credit for bringing these bastards down. He unhooked the magical scanning device that tracked his levels and recorded all spells and potions he’d been subjected to and unclipped the muggle wire he had strapped to his chest. Wizards, they always scanned for magical traps but never thought to just pat a bloke down.
The sounds of Potter’s reunion with his girlfriend made the others come to see what all the commotion was about.
, of all people!”
? I need to avoid making eye contact with him.
Because as much as he wanted to, and as much as it hurt him, Draco was unable to look away. It had been difficult enough before Ginny came, to keep himself from staring at Potter’s half naked body every damn day, but now, it was like he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the happy couple that he wished he could swap places with one half of. Instead, he started to avoid spending time with the others, only speaking to Pansy on the rare occasions when she wasn’t surrounded by Gryffindors. So he was quite surprised one evening when Ginny suddenly appeared on the doorstep of his and Potter’s room, asking him to come down and join the party they’d just decided to have.
“Sorry, I just—”
Of course. Of bloody course. Not only was he supposed to hang around Draco all the time in public and be fondled by him, for show mind you, not for real, but he also had to endure sleeping in the same bed as him, again, just for show. This assignment was turning into a nightmare.
The next day he’s a little more spirited when you arrive, his skin a more lively colour instead of tinted grey. Your fingers tremble when you untie his undertunic at the collar to take off the wrappings and check his wounds, but his eyes are closed, so you hope that he doesn’t notice.
Finally, they were all sitting in the lotus position, palms together and their instructor bowed them off with a Namaste. Harry turned to Malfoy with a serene smile firmly in place.
Draco’s stomach turned at the way Harry was smiling and leaning gently against this other man. How could this be happening?
“Yeah, yeah of course. Um, I’m going to head out. Thank you for this week, Draco, I had a great time. See you Sunday.” Harry dropped a kiss on Draco’s cheek and swiftly left the club before he could protest. He could feel tears forming behind his eyes. This assignment was going to be the death of him, he just knew it.
“I said, is Professor Potter as annoying at home as he is at school?” the girl repeated, and now the entire class was laughing openly, including Harry.
“Um, nothing,” said Harry, trying to hide the

good.
Potter rolls his eyes at him, sighing. “You know what I mean, don’t make such a big deal out of it.”
. There’s obviously been a mistake.”
“I warned you they would be boundaryless nosy buggers, didn’t I?”
“Potter, I forbid you to finish that sentence.”
Panic rose in Draco’s throat. “Where is he? What have you done with him?!”
being used on Muggles and other victims during the war and it would’ve scared him. But I managed to make him a bit lighter so I didn’t sprain myself. (Good thing I have magic now, I distinctly remember dragging Dudley home after that dementor attack before fifth year, I had a sore back for weeks after that!)
know I’m younger than you?”
“Honestly, if you’re that impatient then Legilimency isn’t for you. It takes a long time and a lot of effort to master,” Harry said with a fond smile on his face.
“Oh. Well, it’s such a shame, a nice young man like you, living alone with only your friend for company.” She glances out the open door into the garden, where Harry is working, singing quietly to himself.
“So, do you think you can do that?” Potter said gently, and Draco nodded, biting his lip. Potter smiled and held out the knife, his fingers brushing Draco’s as he handed it over, and Draco had to fight a gasp at the touch. He didn’t dare look up into Potter’s eyes for fear of exposing himself further, but it didn’t matter, because a voice from the door startled them both.
I don’t know what I did wrong but the sourdough bread didn’t come out as nice as I’d thought it would. It was too flat. Draco said it tasted alright though and said that we could try slicing it up thinly and dry it in the oven to make some sort of crackers. And I guess what happened next was a very strange consequence of him trying to make me feel better, but somehow we ended up giving each other hand jobs again.
“— of marrying me, so I can keep fucking this glorious arse of yours? Once in a while of course, because I like it when you’re the one doing the fucking.”
“I… My… My passport. Yes! My passport.”
Draco kept staring at me, and when I started doing the squats he even left the room, even though the episode hadn’t ended yet. That was a bit weird, wasn’t it?
“My cousin here has taken a fancy to him, and since he has been so instrumental in helping me get this little rehabilitation clinic running, I thought he deserved a reward.”
Her posture softens at his words, and she turns to him to take his hand tentatively. “Draco, you know that love is—”
“Kiss me, Draco,” Harry repeats, his voice needy and begging, and Draco surges forward, missing Harry’s mouth in his haste, and the kiss is sloppy and wet, too much teeth and tongue and they can’t find the rhythm, but Harry doesn’t care, he just wants Draco close. He slides his hands under Draco’s top and whispers “Let go.”
“Gibbering curse, Gingivitis, no, H, H is here, let’s see…” she mutters to herself, setting the book down at a safe distance from her daughter’s arms. “Hive-conjuring, Heartburn, here! The Hanahaki Disease!” she says triumphantly, tapping her index finger on the page.
“Well I
Harry stared at him, feeling as if he’d burn his eyes if he looked at him too long.
“I’m… fine,” he says, the words sounding slurred even to his own ears, and he knows he looks anything but.
Harry smirked down at the purplish head of Draco’s prick, precome flowing freely onto his stomach.
The silence stretches on for what feels like hours until Harry finally clears his throat. “So, er…”
! How do we share a bed? Do we take turns? Does one of us sleep in the chair?”
The next day you wake up to the sound of birds chirping and the sun peeking in through the stained windows. You keep your eyes closed, trying to stay in the illusion that this is something normal, something you could have every day, to be waking up with Harry in your arms, warm and comforting.
,” he said, ignoring a snort from Weasley, “but how come I get to share a room with Potter?”
each other.
But flexing and extending his fingers has become some sort of strangely comforting habit. And right now he’s face to face with a vase on the coffee table in front of him. A vase filled with red carnations. Fucking red carnations. They’re almost the exact shade as the one he spewed out this morning, except that these are clean. The fucking irony. It feels like they’re staring at him, and it makes the itching in his wrists more profound.
“Ha, that’s cute. Who do you think stands a better chance, the Chosen One, or the former Death Eater? Now, take this.”
“As you wish,” Draco says, his voice not quite as nonchalant as he’s apparently trying to make it sound. “Lie back, then.”
Malfoy to put his cock in him, he’d brush them off as a crazy person. But it doesn’t feel crazy at all. It feels just right, like they were supposed to end up like this, and he realises that never in a million years would he’d be able to let Draco go, to be indifferent about him.
fly through Harry’s mind.
“You don’t have to say the same, Harry, I know it wasn’t like that for you. I’m just— I’m happy we got here eventually.”
You nod. Of course he does. He’s not stupid.
“What? What is it?” came a collective query from the group, everyone edging closer now.
pair…?” Harry asks, confused.
“Potter, wait!”
Harry steps closer to you, still holding your hand tightly.
“What are you talking about? It’s
~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry jumped from the sofa and almost dropped his text book upon hearing Draco’s unusually high pitched voice. By the sound of his tone, it was something serious this time, like someone had died, or worse, threatened to damage his hair.

were the one who definitely wanted to keep it casual. I just happened to have some other casual sex with another person.”
,” Draco hissed. “I should’ve
The door to the bathroom opened and Harry’s jaw dropped, because out stepped Malfoy in a cloud of vapour, skin still damp from the shower, and with a towel wrapped around his waist. Harry choked as Malfoy let out a little sigh of contentment and flicked his hair, little droplets of water hitting Harry on the face. Suddenly, Harry’s trousers felt tight, and he sensed heat rising up on his neck, probably caused by the steam from the shower. He cleared his throat and Malfoy turned to him, looking surprised.
that feels good.”
You don’t say anything, don’t try to tell him he’s wrong, because he’s not. He’s the only one who knows you better than you know yourself.
wrong. And since he’s never been good at leaving things well enough alone, he needs to find out what it is. He tries to sound casual, but both Ron and Hermione pause in their tasks and turn to him, frowning.
“I’ll explain,” Draco says, bringing him closer. “I’ll explain later.”
Draco could barely hear what Potter was saying, his heart pounding in his ears. He’d been such an idiot, so immersed in his own self pity that he’d missed this vital fact. And suddenly Draco saw his behaviour from Potter’s perspective. His constant snipes, his reserved manner, his unwillingness to give the tiniest bit of himself away. He licked his lips despite the fact that his mouth was as dry as the sand on the beach.
to investigate this. But fine, if he really needed a
“Yeah, sorry. It was just Luna being Luna.” Harry leans in, brushing his lips over that spot underneath Draco’s ear that always makes him shiver whenever Harry touches it. Today is not an exception and Harry flicks out his tongue, chuckling softly when Draco lets out a gasp. “Let’s get away from here, yeah?”
“Yes,” Harry moans, because he is, he’s so ready. “I want to feel you now, Draco.”
their longing for each other as Draco sang, like, the longing was in his voice in some way. I can’t really explain it. I never knew he could sing like that, or at all, really. I guess there’s something new to learn about a person everyday, even when you think you know all there is to know about them.
Blaise smirked and Harry whipped his head around to the stack of gifts next to him, wanting to occupy his mind with something other than the writhing bodies on the cover of the book currently taking up all the space in his head. “Who’s this from?” He picked up a big box wrapped in black paper with little golden snitches on it and a big golden bow on top.
“Not even… not even with
“Okay, Harry, your coffee’s ready!” Jane calls, snapping Harry out of his musings. “Don’t make me come out and bring it to you, your highness. And also you need to pay.”
“I was only looking out for sea rats. Clearly.”
And part of Harry thinks that they shouldn’t be doing this: it will complicate things, they’ve both had plenty to drink, this should be wrong. Except that when Draco presses his naked body closer to Harry’s, he’s never felt more sober in his life. It’s like his mind goes strangely crystal clear when he feels Draco’s already hard cock brush his hip, like he’s gone into some sort of hyper reality when looking into those mesmerising grey eyes locked with his. And he realises that he wants Draco to look at him all the time, that he wants to hold his attention, that that’s what he’s wanted even as an angry teenager.
,” she said with an exaggerated glance over at Potter, “thank you so much for offering, I appreciate it. I just think
His breath leaves him in a rush, and then you feel the soft hardness of him nudging against you.
“Fair enough,” Harry sighed, leaning in closer. “But if I didn’t try to kiss you to mock you, maybe I tried because I wanted to?”
“I thought, what we did before, I wasn’t sure if you were under the influence, if I was taking advantage,” Draco said quietly, eyes cast down.
Draco snickers. “Well, they were too restraining, I couldn’t spread my legs enough to get into the right position, so I spelled them off while you were busy concentrating on breathing and they broke in the process.”
“You think so? And you’re fine with me borrowing them?”
Ron was unceremoniously cut off by an angry voice coming nearer.
He doesn’t finish the sentence. Instead he falls to his knees and starts coughing violently, his entire body shaking as he retches and writhes on Harry’s carpet. Harry’s completely frozen, with no idea what to do. It’s like everything is happening in slow motion and he sees the scene from outside: He’s on the floor, with his trousers and pants still around his ankles and his shirt bunched up over his stomach, while Draco sounds like he’s having a seizure, like he’s going to burst at the seams.
Draco wishes he could say that he has a snappy retort for her, but he becomes as much of a mumbling mess as Harry, which only makes Healer Goodwin look insufferably smug as she wishes them a good night’s sleep.
Because that’s part of their deal: they don’t do feelings and they never schedule anything beforehand, and that’s what keeps Draco interested, that he never knows how long it’ll be until the next time he gets to fuck Potter. Not to mention that he doesn’t have to deal with those utterly boring relationship responsibilities and insecurities.
Shit.
weeks ago.
“Okay, well I’m off then. See you around,” Harry says, trying to smile but it feels a bit like a grimace. Something feels off, the way Draco suddenly seems like he has trouble breathing, his chest heaving rapidly in short movements. “You alright?”
She sighed. She knew humans could be thick, but this one really seemed to be the thickest of them all. “
“No!” Draco turned back and grabbed Harry by the shoulders. “Not like this. Never like this. Bloody hell, Harry, I can’t do this anymore.” Draco stepped back and glanced sideways.
“Oh, Potter, I —” Malfoy said coyly, the fucking
“What is it, Harry?” asked Hermione, trying to lean in closer to see what was in the box.
it was unwise to get drunk with him. That red-headed buffoon act is a great cover to trick people into trusting him with—”
He nods gratefully. He dearly hopes that his mother will make it in time before he draws his last breath, but at least he has Pansy here, and that’s comforting enough.
Ten minutes later, he’s sitting at the table again and making funny faces at Rose, whose delighted laughter takes away at least some of the pain.
“I was. But that doesn’t mean I know what happened.”
He swallows. Takes a deep breath. Reaches for Harry.
“What the fuck are you doing here? Where the fuck is Harry? ”
to the imagination. And he couldn’t very well look at the expanse of smooth, pale skin that seemed so inviting, like it was practically calling Harry to come and feel it, taste it.
“What do you mean?” Harry said, peeking out of the door before he remembered that this wasn’t his own room, and he was wearing a dressing gown that clearly wasn’t his.
Healer Goodwin turns to Draco, her eyebrows raised. “I suppose a few minutes can’t hurt,” she says tentatively. “If it’s fine with you, Draco.”
friends! I just… I don’t like… I just want a fucking plate!”
“Wait, I…”
“Which is why you should’ve told me!” she hisses, and Draco is getting increasingly convinced that she might make the process short for him and strangle him before the plants have done their work.
“Forgive me,” you say, plead, “forgive me for what I said, I… I wasn’t thinking.”
“What took you so long? I don’t care about your situation, you still have to do your jobs. Now, debrief me and make it quick. I have to present to the board in 2 hours.”
“Hmmm… I did book this cabin to be able to impress a potential conquest, but… I guess desperate times call for desperate measures.”
“Yeah, er, I guess you have a point. I just… I think, since we’re going to live together, we need to establish some… rules, or guidelines, on how to dress properly,” Harry said, shifting in his seat to cross his legs.
“Apart from her best friend dying a slow and painful death? Nothing that I can think of.”
He got up and started to look for his wand. He must’ve dropped it at some point in the frenzy of undressing each other yesterday. But before he found it, there was a loud knock on the door to Draco’s rooms.
Shit, I hope he didn’t think the cuddling was something that it wasn’t. Like, I hope he doesn’t think that
Potter looked at him with interest. “You mean you’ve never cooked before? Ever?”
Even if he annoys the hell out of me most of the time, at least he’s great company. I never thought I’d be friends with Draco (who would have?!), but I’m really grateful to have him around and that we get along so well together now that he’s not a racist git. I mean he’s still a git, but at least he’s not racist. We’ve had a lot of talks about our past since we became flatmates a year ago, and we’ve talked about it more lately, when we’ve had trouble sleeping and such.
“Are you an angel?” he sighs, almost reverent before he closes those beautiful eyes again. “Am I in heaven?”
“Wow. How’d you do that?”
Draco let out a soft snort of disbelief. “It’s not that. I thought…”
“Thank you, Aya. No, we need to pack our things here first and settle down.”
it is. Not to mention having morning sex is fucking nice. You don’t have to make this into a bigger deal than it is!”
“And have you had anything to eat?”
Chuckling to himself, Harry gets up and gets his coffee, flashing Jane a bright smile as he hands her the money. “Sorry for being an arse, it’s just been a rough day.”
It’s raining the day that Harry leaves. You’re both huddling under one of the archways, away from prying eyes. It’s not big enough to give you both complete shelter, and your salty tears blend with the water dripping down in your hair, sliding along your cheek.
“Apparently. And
“What?”
“Is that a no, then?” Harry says, fighting as best he can to keep from bursting out laughing.
“Hey, everyone, let’s play Truth or Dare!” she said.
“Gentlemen. Could I have your names or registration number, please?”
love you, Draco?”
“I think they’re… er,
Frowning, Harry watched her skip away through the high grass, her white dress billowing around her legs, in stark contrast to her wellies.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand, bringing it to his cock.
“What?” Draco wheezes.
But having to fight to get any air at all into his lungs makes it hard to scoff. And it’s hard to scoff at the way those beautiful petals are bathing in blood. His blood. There’s so much fucking blood.
, I was referring to… that... thing,” Harry said, indicating the luscious bed facing the double glass doors leading out to the patio.
Ron and Hermione had dropped increasingly unsubtle hints about how they wanted to have some more privacy, now that they wanted to start a family, and when Pansy had moved in with Ginny, leaving an empty room for Harry to live in, it had only seemed like the right thing to do. Also, he was tired of walking in on them in various compromising situations, so the prospect of living with Malfoy had seemed more agreeable than having to see Ron’s naked arse for the umpteenth time when he got home from Healer Training.
fucking him, to have his cock sliding into him again and again, and he doesn’t want to wait anymore.
“Yeah, don’t worry, no one is catching any feelings,” Potter says, shoving his socks onto his feet.
Draco’s eyes rolled back into his head, not only from Harry’s nip at his hip but also the surprising genius of his newly shirtless lover. One hand tangled in Harry’s hair as the other reached to help him unbuckle his belt. It was slapped away and once the belt was undone, his pants and trousers were unceremoniously ripped down his legs and thrown over the back of the couch. Harry nipped at Draco’s thighs, prompting him to spread them wider in anticipation. Draco’s shout seemed to echo throughout the room when Harry swallowed him down whole without warning.
He stretches slowly, bringing a hand up to your cheek and stroking it.
“Fine,” he’d said, “but only if you and I share a room.”
“It’s fine,” Draco answers, tears brimming his eyes. “You can’t help it. It’s not your fault, Harry.”
Just like when he had the latest attack, there’s some sort of calm settling over him. Now that he’s nearing the end, it’s like there are few things that matter now.
“Yes,” Harry whimpers as Draco flicks his thumb over his nipple and then pinches it lightly.
“Something wrong?” Draco asks, and if Harry didn’t know any better he’d think Draco sounds hopeful. “Did you change your mind?”
At least Draco helped me with answering questions. He was sitting out of sight, just to the side of the fireplace, and he kept writing good answers for me and making the words float in front of him, so it didn’t look weird that I was looking to the side. I always become either a mumbling mess or too hostile when I’m giving interviews, but thanks to his upbringing, his work at the Ministry with Muggle-Wizarding relations, as well as his charitable work for war orphans, Draco knows more about the politics of things like these.
be a bonus, but I’ve also missed seeing your gorgeous arse in those running tights terribly, and I thought this was my best chance.”
This is so much worse than before. Now that I’m aware of my feeling towards Draco I
Harry accepted the gift that Ron handed to him with a smile and a “Happy birthday, mate.” He tore the wrappings off to reveal a set of Wizards Chess. At Harry’s puzzled expression Ron explained. “Well, since you lost your old set I thought I’d give you a new one so we can play again!”
Draco would laugh until he cried if I suggested that.
He doesn’t finish his sentence, because he doesn’t know how to. Instead he heads towards the door, a mumbled “bye” thrown over his shoulder, and when he turns back to wave lamely, he notices that Draco is rubbing a hand over his sternum this time as well.
“It’s Potter, isn’t it?”
His hands are still holding you, resting on your hips, and he’s so close that you can see all the tiny freckles scattered across the bridge of his nose. Your breath comes in short bursts; you can’t seem to draw in the air properly. You swallow again, and his eyes follow the motion, then come to rest on your mouth. He licks his lips.
In some cases it’s possible to do a procedure where the roots are removed, but it’s highly risky and many patients refuse to go through with it since it more often than not makes the patient forget about the object of their affections. There is also a risk of relapse, and in those cases a new operation is impossible.
“Well, the other week I woke up in the night and I realised it was because… there were… sounds.” He felt his face heat at the memory of that particular night. He’d tried to block it out by pressing his pillow against his ears but Malfoy was really
Harry had a hard time keeping his eyes off Draco, who was wearing a beautiful flower crown that Ebba’s friend Saga had made for him while they were preparing the food. Harry had been given one as well, but he doubted he looked as good in his as Draco did. With the sunlight shining behind him, and the purple and yellow flowers adorning his white blonde hair, he looked positively ethereal. They’d been drinking beer and
“Right. I’ll, er… I’ll try to keep that in mind.”
Draco watched him get up and walk across the room to the parchment and bring it over. “Merlin you’re rubbing off on me,” he groaned, throwing his hands up to cover his face. “Any other time I would have called you rude for it.”
“Potter!” he wheezed in a very dignified manner. “Has no one ever told you it’s impolite to sneak up on people like that?”
“I also said you have a pretty face and gorgeous arse.”
“What?” he asks, a little annoyed.
“We can send for new ones if they’re essential to you, but for now you need some rest.”
“You know where I want your hands,” Harry answers and then finally gets the door lock to click open.
Harry nods, because he knows Draco will make it so good. He loves Draco being in control, trusts him completely to take care of him like this.
Slowly, Draco continues thrusting in and out of him before he stops and drapes himself over Harry’s back, leaving tiny huffs of breath over Harry’s skin. Harry is still catching his breath, and when Draco draws himself out, Harry moans at the loss of his cock filling him. His legs are trembling and he needs to lie down, so he collapses on the bed, onto his own come that has gone cold by now, but he doesn’t care. Draco lies down beside him and Harry rolls over slinging a leg over his hips, still panting. They lie like this for a few minutes, basking in the afterglow, and Harry is so bonelessly satisfied, so wonderfully exhausted that he’s starting to drift off. But of course, Draco nudges him.
“Yes? What’s wrong with it?”
(Also apparently he and Astoria weren’t about to get back together, he was talking to her so much because he needed to talk to someone about me. Go figure. I was jealous of someone without reason to be.)
Harry’s eyes are wild, his lips swollen and shiny, and he’s panting, his chest heaving, and you remember how you used to refrain from playing with the hairs on it when you were taking care of his wounds. It dawns on you that you’ve been wanting to do that ever since, and you reached the end of your rope: you can’t go another minute without touching him.
“Harry!” you scream as the sky opens and the rain washes down. You’re terrified that something happened to him. “Harry, where are you?”
Draco ran his hands through Harry’s hair, turning his head so that they were nose to nose.
Potter made a noise almost like her prey when she sank her fangs into them, a strangled, garbling sound. Well, except for the death anxiety of course. “
for me, Potter”, and “no one will fuck you as good as this”, until he stills and his cock finally throbs its release inside Harry.
You should’ve walked away the first time. Should’ve done it while you still had the chance — the strength — to do so. You already know that, but you’re in too deep now. You’re in too deep and you don’t know how to get out. You don’t know if you even want to.
And that’s when I think we both realised what we were doing because I tensed up, and so did he, and I might have sort of panicked a bit. I told him I had to make dinner and quickly went out into the kitchen (even made some lame joke about how I wouldn’t set the kitchen on fire this time). And when it was time to eat he said he wanted to do it in his room, and then he disappeared in there for the rest of the night.
He threw Draco off and turned on him, hand thrown out angrily. “We don’t know how deep this goes. They could be doing anything tonight, they could be moving them—we need—
“I’m afraid so,” Harry said with a shrug, and Draco made an indignant noise.
“Maybe they’re getting room service,” Draco said. His arm was thrown over Harry’s shoulders and felt as heavy as lead. Even if the heat around them was begging for personal space and his arm felt as heavy as lead, Harry couldn’t help but move closer. “Some couples truly just want to fuck and stay hidden away from the world on their honeymoons.”
“That’s a sin, Harry,” you say, your voice sharp as a whip. “What you did. It’s a sin, it’s against the Lord’s will.”
Luna’s question makes Harry splutter his coffee all over himself, and in a panic he checks to see whether Ginny and Pansy heard her too. Thankfully, Ginny is in the middle of a reiteration of her latest training session, and Pansy is looking at her in awe. Harry turns to Luna and laughs as heartily as he can. “What are you —?”
Draco followed alongside Harry until they reached a wall and he nearly ran into him.
“Oh good! I haven’t seen you out on one, so I assumed they were a new concept to you.”
“Nothing,” said Harry, to let Hermione off the hook. “I’m just happy to get to spend my birthday with the people I love.”
started kissing me. I just… I’ve never seen him so intense about anything before, it was like he was devouring me. And he grabbed my hair (like he did that first time I had my mouth on him) and used it to keep me in place and I… well I really
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh my god, you have that with you, don’t you?!”
Isn’t it?
“What’s with her?” Potter says once Pansy has left.
“So sorry about that, my fiancé and I—,” he said with a quick glance at Harry, “Well, I don’t think I need to excuse myself for not being able to keep my hands off him,” he added with a not so subtle wink.
“Well, I don’t want to intrude, and if you’re not comfortable having me here for longer than necessary I don’t want to force you.”
“Fine? You just had a meltdown and nearly blew our cover. I wouldn’t say you’re fine,” Draco said, his feelings creeping over the barrier between work and the latent desire he possessed to see Harry taken care of, “And I what if I want to comfort you?” He pressed a hand to Harry’s shoulder and gave him a slight nudge. “You look like shit.”
“Kingsley. What are you doing here?”
“I’ll make you feel so good, Harry, you have no idea.”
But it’s not love, not really, Harry has to remind himself when suddenly Luna’s words appear unbidden in his head. It’s not
Draco smiled. “Wonderful—feel free to elaborate when I can properly hear you, yeah?”  Harry shot him a simpering smile in return and then continued down the stairway, wand out and ready. No doubt the suspect had already heard them, along with the alarm.
“Harry, I… I want you. I want you inside me.”
Luna continues to smile at him, and he’d describe it as knowingly, if it weren’t for the way her eyes seem focused on the air around him rather than his face.
“I may not be your direct supervisor, but I am in charge of this investigation. Watch your language.”
Pansy turns to him. “I’ve managed to Floo call Narcissa and she’s on her way, but it’ll take her a while to arrange for an international Portkey.”
“And what
“Fuck! Can’t last.”
going to be there as well.”
He finally managed to get all the tape off and unwrapped the gift slowly. The sight of the box made him let out a gush of air, unable to believe that this was really real. Had Draco actually bought him—?
“You’re doing so good, Harry, just look at you,” Draco murmurs, his breath ghosting over Harry’s sensitive skin.
Harry laughs softly, shaking his head in disbelief. “I don’t know. I couldn’t fall asleep tonight, something kept me up. And then I heard you. As if your voice was magnified, because when I went out to look for you you were quite far away.”
The door in front of them opens and Draco’s healer, Sadie Goodwin, a woman about his own age, steps out.
Harry shakes his head, laughing at them. His stomach is full of butterflies and he wants to rush out after Draco, but he needs to wait for a bit first, to not raise any suspicions. As exciting as this thing they have is, he’s getting tired of it, tired of sneaking around, of hiding what they’re doing, especially from Ron and Hermione. But he’s also not entirely sure
Twenty minutes later, Draco stood leaning against Harry’s desk and staring into the distance while the last students filed out of the classroom. He was exhausted. He’d been so nervous that the students would be hostile towards him or inquire about what he did during the war, but they had mostly asked him relevant questions about his work, interspersed with silly anecdotes, like the time Harry accidentally blew a hole in the wall when he was teaching them how to cast a
You forget how to breathe. His eyes are a piercing green, and you feel like he’s looking straight into your soul. And you know, without a shred of a doubt, that this man, this stranger, is just like you.
Draco is such an expert at sucking Harry off, and soon Harry starts moving his hips in tiny thrusts upwards to meet Draco bobbing his head, and Draco lets him, going faster and faster, sucking harder and circling a finger lightly around Harry’s hole.
“You’re not saying anything. You stop talking right now.”
new ones! That was from the last batch sold before they went out of business.”
“I do,” Draco said, panting. “Could it be the bond?”
“Right, as lovely as this has been, I’m afraid I have other things to do,” Draco says and rises from his chair. He sweeps one hand through his hair and Harry has to swallow.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Well, according to the tests and the diagnostic spells we ran, this is a rare case of the Hanahaki Disease where the infatuation has roots too deep to be operated on. I’m afraid that if we proceed with surgery, you run an extremely high risk of not surviving the operation.”
Malfoy’s laughter is surprisingly soft as he Disapparates them, his fingers nimble but careful as he strips Harry off in the quiet of his bedroom, his tongue firm but gentle against Harry’s lips, demanding access that Harry happily grants.
Ron gave him a reproachful look. “Mate. Come on. Ask anyone from our year, or hell, ask anyone who went to school with us.”
for this shit. She’d been organising these training camps in her family villa in southern Italy for
“I… What do you want to know?” you say, ignoring how your name spilling from his lips so casually makes your stomach flip.
“It’s something with an H, but I don’t remember either, it’s been ages since I used the books on magical ailments as light reading,” Hermione says. “Hang on, Harry, let me go get one of them for you.”
Draco makes a strangled sound, like a deep sob, and Harry lifts his head to look at him. His face is wet with streaming tears, but his eyes are clear.
“But—” Harry says.
“Would you like that? To have children someday?”
Draco bites back his retort because he knows Pansy is scared to death right now. He was actually relieved to learn about this procedure when Pansy told him while they were running tests on him but refused to answer his questions about what the tests were for. It’s a risky procedure since the disease is so far developed, but at least he has a chance of surviving it. Even if it means he’s running the risk of forgetting about Potter altogether.
“Not… never with another person.”
“Hey! Malfoy!”
“My, my, manners, dear. What would your mother say? Not even a hello and a kind word for your fiance?”
He’s recently got his glasses and his enjoyment at being able to see properly again makes you pleased as well.
You give him an encouraging nod and try not to dwell too much on how your heart leaps in your chest at the pleased smile he gives you and how it makes his beautiful eyes light up. He’s well enough to accompany you in the garden, and he’s thoroughly enjoying it. You try to explain away the fluttering in your chest as joy of having a helping hand, of sharing something with him that’s so important to you. But you know, deep down, that if you allowed yourself to think about it, you’d see that it’s more profound than that.
Draco looks to Pansy, but she keeps her gaze firmly on Healer Goodwin.
“Right. I’ll… I guess I’ll be going then.” Potter turns the door handle, and gives Draco a sad smile. “See you around, Draco.”
Because you know he doesn’t want you, not really. And you know he’d never choose you, not in the way that matters.
“Remember, you’re supposed to be under a love potion.”
I know Draco has had more trouble sleeping lately. I think this being forced to stay inside triggers memories from when he used to have Voldemort in his home, even if it’s not the same now at all.
Merlin he hated Harry sometimes.
on them and we can use that pair for when you want to tear them off roughly.”
“So what do you think?”
“I hate you,” Draco mutters eventually.
“No. You’re definitely alive. Barely.”
“ … “
But Draco had been the one thing that had made him feel safe. Draco had been so careful not to hurt him, he could see the tenderness in Draco’s eyes as he tended to him once they got back, and now Harry had fucked it all up and shouted at him. God, he was such an ass. He knew how much Draco hated his reputation and how much he’d changed. These last weeks preparing for this assignment, Harry had even thought he felt something else, something deeper, but how could Draco forgive him now? Harry had thrown all that back in his face.
Malfoy shivered, but his voice was as firm as his hand on Harry’s cock was when he said, “Oh don’t worry, Potter. This time,
Potter shook his head. “What? No! Why would I—?” He sighed. “Okay, let’s take this from the beginning, shall we? First off, Ginny and I aren’t together. We haven’t been for at least a year.”
“Yes, fine, whatever,” Draco said, closing the door behind him with a dull thud.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but just then, a new song started, and Ebba grabbed Harry and Draco’s hands.
Potter looks at him disbelievingly, and Draco recognises that face. It’s the one he makes when he’s tired of Draco evading his attempts to talk, or when he’s keeping things from him. But then he shrugs with a small exasperated sigh. “Fine, don’t tell me then. Actually, when I was a kid, there was this saying: ‘a magician never reveals his secrets’. Obviously that was before I found out I was a real wizard.”
He worries his lip between his teeth, looking around the dark room. What little light is out there barely comes in through the dirty windows, but your eyes are getting used to it and you take the opportunity to take in his presence. He’s drenched in rain, water dripping from his chin, his hair sticking up at odd angles, and you smile at how it still manages to be unruly even when soaked. He gives you a quizzical look, but you just shake your head, biting back an ever wider grin.
“Alex, ex-boyfriend, jealous bastard. I haven’t seen him in ages.”
He washed his face and began to dress for dinner. If he happened to pick out his most alluring trousers and the jumper he always caught Draco staring at him in, he didn’t think about why.
When Draco stated that Alex Selket was Falmouth Falcons’ best Seeker through all times, Harry had shoved him with his shoulder, but as he was a bit tipsy he’d lost his balance and fallen against Draco. Draco had caught him in his arms, holding Harry up and pressing their bodies together, and Harry had felt his stomach swoop, like when he was diving on his broom. Draco’s face had been so close, but before Harry could summon the courage to close the distance and kiss him, Draco had beaten him to it.
you absolute pillock, because she told me that every other cabin on this ship is already booked, so
Harry shrugged. “It’ll be fine, Ron, don’t worry about it,” he said, not mentioning that he felt like he’d jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire.
“Well, I had to bribe Healer Merriweather by taking all her night shifts for a month, but at least I managed to get here,” said Draco as he stepped inside, impeccably dressed as ever. “Please tell me I haven’t missed the cake.” He paused in front of the doorway, looking around the room, all eyes turned on him. “What? What happened? Is there something on my shirt?” He started patting himself all over, looking for a non-existing stain.
“So cabbage pottage for supper today? Are you very hungry, or do you think it could wait?” Harry asks, leaving tiny kisses along your neck.
Harry lay down behind him, throwing one arm around Draco and pulling him closer. “I know,” he said, kissing the nape of Dracos’ neck, the soft hair tickling his nose. “Like never finding out you want me as much as I want you.” He slid his hand over Draco’s side, over his hip, letting it rest there. “I don’t want to back out,” he said. “I want this. I want you.”
Draco is numb, horrified, and his tongue feels uncooperative when he speaks. “I… I don’t know.”
“The only reason I’m not sending you off is because you’ve served our community well, Brother Draco, and also because I don’t have any proof of this alleged subversion. So far, you only have the Lord himself to answer to, and His forgiveness to seek. But rest assured, if I so much as get a whiff of any unseemly behaviour, the punishment will be severe. Have I made myself understood?”
Harry whispered his answer against Draco’s exposed skin as he kissed down his chest. “Locking spell, slight sound enhancing for our lurkers, and a detection spell on the hallway that is linked to our enchanted parchment. All movement will be recorded. We need to give them a show so they don’t notice our tracking spell.”
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco says on an exhale, capturing Harry’s lips again, pressing himself even closer. “Tell me, tell me what you want to do with me. You know I want to give you everything. Anything you want.”
used to be the one always checking
You both laugh quietly, and he kisses you on your temple, making you sigh in satisfaction.
“That depends on what you mean by “waited”. As far as you’ve told us, Mr Malfoy, your symptoms started getting very severe about a month ago?”
Kingsley threw his head back and bellowed out a deep laugh.
His hands are numb after the effort of holding himself upright, but despite his fumbling fingers he manages to open the door eventually. Pansy is outside, her face ashen, eyes wide as she stares at him in horror.
“So if you’re in love and you’re spending all of your energy buggering the life out of your supposed significant other - why aren’t you going out and eating with them?”
But it’s difficult keeping the lines between sex and love unblurred when Draco always manages to give Harry exactly what he didn’t even know himself that he needed. It’s getting so hard to tell himself that it’s not love when Draco is the first person Harry thinks about when he wakes up in the mornings, and the last person he wants to talk to before he goes to sleep at night. And it keeps getting increasingly difficult to convince himself it’s not love when all he wants is to keep Draco close, feel his heartbeat underneath his palm, kiss him soft and slow in the morning before he goes to work. But this is what Draco has agreed to, this is all he wants from Harry, and if Harry wants to keep this, he needs to keep his mouth shut and keep Luna and her oddities out of his head.
“Ginny!” he shouted, dropping everything and running towards her, lifting her up and spinning her around. Draco’s heart fell. She shrieked with laughter, but when she noticed how Draco was staring at them, she whispered something to Potter and he set her down, blushing slightly.
“I’m so sorry, Draco, I know I shouldn’t have— I know I should’ve kept my mouth shut, I—
Whispering filthy words in his ear. Revelling in the moans you draw out of him. Filled with pride at the knowledge that he wants this enough to risk the entire world knowing of his dirty little secret.
Pansy scoffs. “I thought so.”
Harry and Draco protested at the same time.
“But Potter, if you think for even a second that this will give you a free pass to continue your disgusting habits, you are sorely mistaken.”
notion of something called
“What— What was that?” Harry eventually dares to ask. He realises his voice is hushed and placating, like he’s talking to a wounded animal. Which isn’t far from what Draco reminds him of right now.
“Is it? Is it really?”
“I’m sorry,” Potter whispers. “I’m so sorry, Draco.”
“Have I made myself understood?” he says with a tone of impatience.
The door opens and Healer Goodwin peeks around it. When she notices that he’s awake she walks to him in quick but quiet strides, positively beaming at him. But when she looks at Harry lying beside him she rolls her eyes.
“What do you think she meant by th—” Harry started, turning to Draco but stopping mid sentence. Without him noticing, Draco had edged closer and now his face was mere inches away from Harry’s. Harry forgot how to speak when he looked into those soft grey eyes. It was a rare thing to see them this close, see all the intricate patterns, all the different shades they held. Harry swallowed.
“Mmm, I love yoga, don’t you, Malfoy?” Harry said, folding his hands and stretching them up above his head with a reverent sigh. “I think it really helps your - ah - blood flow,” he added with a glance down at Malfoy’s crotch, where a bulge was visible through the thin fabric. Harry rose gracefully from the floor and was pleased to see Malfoy’s pale cheeks turn a flattering shade of pink as he looked down at his mat. “Need any help there, Malfoy? I mean with getting up,” Harry said, and when Malfoy’s eyes flitted to his with a slightly panicked look, he smirked, “from the floor.”
“Strutty’s missing!” Neville exclaimed, unnervingly reminding Harry of his younger self when he’d lost Trevor the Toad.
“Stop crowding me, Malfoy!” Harry snapped, planting his feet firmer into the ground and bracing himself to keep from falling over as Malfoy pressed the entire length of his body against Harry’s.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, coming to stand closely in front of Draco and putting his hands on Draco’s hips.
She waited, looking to the side to not scare the man, while Potter spoke to him. His shoulders dropped, and he seemed to settle a bit, but was still tense when she rose up and tentatively stuck out her tongue. Very slowly, she moved towards him, and wrapped herself around his forearm. It was definitely uncomfortable with the dark magic in his skin, but she tried to ignore that, tried to dig deeper, to detect what was underneath, the flow of his energy, his pulse. And after a moment, when he had relaxed enough, she could easily detect it, ticking underneath her. It wasn’t as rapid a pace as the rabbits and mice she was used to feeling, but slower, steadier. Calmer.
“What?”
“I see,” he manages to grind out eventually. “Thank you, Healer Goodwin.”
You walk side by side in silence, and when you’ve done so for close to half an hour, taking you far from the monastery's line of sight, you tentatively take Harry’s hand. Your heart leaps violently in your chest when he lets you. You’re not sure how to amend the damage you did by disappointing him and letting his trust down, but you tell yourself this is a start.
“Right, hang on for one second,” Harry said, fishing out his wand from his pocket. “
“And now?” he says with a sarcastic little half bow, which doesn’t really have the desired effect since he’s obviously already hard, his cock straining underneath the fabric of his trousers, tenting them.
Healer Goodwin scoffs, but it sounds gentle somehow. “Well I’m afraid I have to ask you to wake him up, because I need to cast some diagnostic spells.”
“Oh, come on, Harry, you can’t deny that you and Malfoy have been at each other’s throats ever since we started school. I guess it was inevitable that it morphed into attraction eventually,” Hermione said with a flick of her head, making her look very much like the teenage bossy know-it-all she used to be.
Shit shit shit.
You were sent to the monastery for education, to learn about the great predecessors and their way of thinking, to honour the family name. But you quickly found life as a monk freeing, the endless rituals and the monotony of it all liberating you by dulling the flame threatening to rise up from the embers of the sinful thoughts of your youth.
The whole thing was actually kind of nice. I mean it’s always nice to have someone else touch you, and Draco was really good at wanking me off. It was so obvious that he knew exactly how to hold a cock, but he did the wanking a bit different than I usually do, but it was in a good way. We were a little awkward afterwards, but we managed to laugh it off and agree that it was nice, and that it was just two good straight friends helping each other out, and… that was it. Draco spelled the mess away, and we got dressed and then we watched another episode of One Tree Hill before we went to our respective rooms and went to sleep.
“ … “
I think it was the nightmares that brought us together. Sometimes we’d find ourselves in the kitchen at the same time, drinking tea to soothe our nerves after a particularly bad dream. We never mentioned it, because it wasn’t needed, we just…
“Okay, that’s enough, moving on!” Harry said beside him, tapping his wand against his desk.
“Oh, I’m so sorry, your highness, I must’ve forgotten since I had to rush to uni after I overslept because
“Savoury sage,” you tell him softly. “It’s quite the cure all; it’s used for every imaginable injury and malady.”
“I assumed they downgraded me since I arrived late to check in. I would
Harry blushed while Draco waxed poetic about their date week. He knew he was in over his head with Draco as his betrothed at the marriage retreat. He had tried many times to bury his feelings for his sometimes partner, but it was going to be difficult with the new close proximity at all times.
“Well, whoever it is, it looks like they have a pretty grim fate ahead of them,” Ron says behind Harry, leaning over the table and pointing to a drawing of someone with tulips and carnations growing out of their mouth. Harry stares at it until his eyes go blurry, tiny dots filling his line of vision.
Harry gives her a grateful smile, but then he has to squeeze his eyes shut at the sound of the coffee grinder. Merlin, he doesn’t even know why he didn’t just skip the café and go straight home. He knows perfectly well how to make his own damn coffee. But then he opens his eyes and sees Draco looking at him, eyes sparkling, and there’s that swooping sensation again in his stomach. He doesn’t know why, but suddenly he’s unable to meet Draco’s gaze, so instead he turns his head towards the counter where Luna is also regarding him, which gives him an eerie feeling, so he returns to Draco. Draco has started talking animatedly with Ginny about brooms and the proper care for them, but Harry knows that Draco’s focus is still entirely on him, can feel it in his body. It’s a dizzying thought.
“You have your assignment, go figure it out. Dismissed. And Malfoy…” Draco turned back towards Robards.
It was only a few weeks ago that Draco introduced him to rimming, but Harry’s been obsessed ever since. The first time they did it, all he could think was “holy shit, Malfoy is kissing my arse!” but soon he’d lost himself in the sensation of Draco’s warm tongue against that sensitive spot, until all it took was for Draco to stroke his cock in a few lazy pulls and Harry came all over himself. And now he’s taking every opportunity available to bury his face between Draco’s glorious arse cheeks or have Draco eat him out. Harry knows he’s not as good as Draco, yet, but he’s planning on getting there.
“Hello everyone. My name is Mr Malfoy, and as Har— Professor Potter told you, I’m here today to tell you about what it’s like working as a Mindhealer,” he started, inwardly cursing himself for only repeating what Harry had said. They must be bored out of their minds already. “I thought I’d tell you how I came into this line of work, but first I’d like to ask if any of you know what a Mindhealer does?”
Harry tries to understand, but his mind is reeling. It’s like he’s missing some vital pieces of the puzzle. He looks at the leaves again, the thickness and the roughness of them, the sharp angles. He can’t even imagine how painful it must be to have them come up from the chest through one’s throat.
Harry’s breath hitched, but he decided not to take the bait, instead snatching his toilet bag from his suitcase and marching into the bathroom. He desperately needed to wash himself off, and if that included a break from Draco, well, all the better.
“Have you ever done that before?” you say instead.
Thank
“Yes,” Harry whispers, eyes still closed, while Draco starts to tug at his clothes, yanking his shirt up to caress Harry’s stomach up to his chest.
You hold your breath, trying to think. But your mind isn’t working properly, you only know that you can’t regret it, because how can you regret sharing the best moment of your life with him?
Then Harry realised. “Draco, are you still drunk?”
Harry rubbed his neck awkwardly and Draco cleared his throat.
“Although I have to say, I doubt either of you need to find out who you’ll marry,” Ebba said slyly and hopped down from the rock they were all sitting on. “I’m getting back inside to help Saga take care of the dishes. I’ll see you later!”
out.”
The tiles of Pansy’s bathroom are too fucking clean. They’re shining impossibly bright, hurting his eyes and practically blinding him. Really, when did she become such a cleaning maniac, Draco thinks as he clutches the sink so forcefully that his knuckles go white.
A thing he chooses not to tell anyone about.
, you’re going through my things!”
“Yes, yes, old habits die hard, I know. Now go.”
“So, how do we do this?”
Malfoy was slow to answer, he was biting his lower lip, looking at Harry assessingly. “I usually save them for special occasions. So no, I don’t think so,” he said finally before leaving Harry alone on the sofa, confused and achingly hard.
“This goes up pretty high on the chain, Harry, you know how it goes.”
A few days prior, Draco had been provided potions by the wizards running the bonding program. Apparently, he was supposed to slip them to his  “future partner” to make them amenable to coming to the retreat. Everything about this was repulsive, and yet, his traitorous body reacted to the act he and Harry were playing.
“Draco, please kick him for me,” Pansy says, and Draco obeys immediately.
“ I… I have a confession to make.”
And there’s Draco’s breath in his ear, their bodies moving together, Draco slowly pushing inside him while whispering sweet filthy things into the hollow of his throat (
While you clean the cuts and put fresh wrappings on them you tell him about your father, and how he decided two years ago that you should come here to study. You tell him about how you ended up enjoying being out in the gardens instead. You tell him how you started learning about the plants and their medical purposes, and he listens with rapt attention, sucking on his lower lip to keep from flinching when you pour essence of St John’s wort onto his wounds.
“Well well, Potter. Enjoying the view?” Malfoy said, taking a swig from his bottle before he tipped his head back and poured some of the water over his face. He raked through his hair with one hand, his bicep and deltoid flexing, and was it really Harry’s fault that he couldn’t stop staring? A nice body was a nice body, even if it happened to belong to one of magical Britain’s most obnoxious people.
Because you can’t stand the thought of someone else having him.
...I’m pretty sure we need to go through this person’s suite to get to our suspect.” Harry pressed his ear to the door and held Draco back before straightening up again.
“Yes, Weasley, could you please stop trying to get cheap laughs so I can focus?” Pansy says, rubbing her forehead tiredly. “So, you’re saying this curse is still active in your family?”
“Weasley,” Draco says in a forcefully measured voice, “would you be so kind as to stop with these literal interpretations of expressions and shut the fuck up before I hex your balls off? I may not be able to see you right now, but trust me, I have impeccable aim.”
“Well. Just so we’re clear in what we’re doing here,” Draco says as he enjoys the view of Potter pulling up his boxers and trousers, the muscles of his back moving deliciously as he does so. Some days he feels like he can never get enough of watching Potter, and he gets the idea that maybe another shag right now wouldn’t go amiss.
Gently, patiently, Draco moves the tiniest bit out to be able to go further in, his hands never stilling in their task to stroke Harry’s thighs to remind him to breathe and to relax. Finally, after what seems like ages, he’s bottoming out, his pubic hairs coarse against Harry’s sensitive skin, and Harry suddenly has the wild thought that if someone had told him, five years ago, that he’d let Draco do this, that he’d
It takes two weeks before Draco appears in Harry’s shop, under the pretence of looking at a new broom for himself. As soon as the customer Harry’s tending to leaves though, Draco pulls him into the back room and presses him up against the shelves. And he doesn’t apologise, because he wouldn’t be Draco if he did, but the way he kisses Harry slowly, softly, speaks more than words ever could. And Harry doesn’t apologise either, because he wouldn’t be Harry if he did when he believes he’s in the right, but he hopes it’s telling Draco enough that he closes his store early to go back to Draco’s.
“What do you want, Draco?” he says, firmer now. “Do you want to tell me what a sinner I am? Do you want to tell the Abbot about what I did? Tell me what you want!”
on you, and remember how last time it was a little bit too strong and half of you ended up not being able to take your oral exam the lesson after?”
you absolute imbecile,” Draco said with barely restrained fury, actually stomping his foot.
“Follow my lead or—whatever it is you do when we’re out on a case.”
“Truth,” he said, only realising when he saw Pansy’s smug smirk that
“And what is it that you want, Malfoy? The opportunity to annoy me to the point of madness?”
“I think my students are an excellent example of people moving on after the war, putting old prejudices behind them, and working for a new and better world. They don’t care what you did when you were their age, they care what you do now.” Harry brushed his lips against Draco’s cheek, it tickled when he spoke again, but the words warmed Draco like melted honey. “And the best thing you do now is make me a very happy husband, which makes me a better professor for them.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I guess you didn’t hear me come in, so I assume that’s why you’re… this informal.”
“Yeah, I guess I’m going soft… I’ll give them 15 more minutes before I’m summoning the security team. He may be the Saviour, but he’s
Harry looked up and into Malfoy’s grey eyes, which were glittering with malice.
“I didn’t even know surgery was an option!”
inside him without waiting for him to adjust. When Draco starts to fuck him roughly, holding him down while he pounds mercilessly into him, Harry isn’t sure he’ll ever meet someone who can give this to him, and it doesn’t take long before he’s coming violently onto the sheets, his groans muffled by the mattress against his mouth. Draco keeps fucking him like a machine even after Harry has come, panting things like “your arse was
He has no idea who this person that Draco wants instead of him is, and even less how Draco could go on being fuckbuddies with Harry when he wanted someone else, but he’s not sure he wants to find out. Everything’s a mess, really, and he doesn’t know how to sort it out since he can’t really talk to anyone about it, so he tries to just move on one day at a time. The way things usually go.
Draco frowned. “A… shrink?” He was confused how the word "shrink" could be associated with his profession, it sounded more like someone responsible for reducing the size of things. He shuddered at the thought that there would be such an enormous amount of objects that needed to be shrunk that it was necessary to dedicate an entire department in the Ministry to it. For some reason, an image of one of Father’s albino peacocks, but in giant size, stomping around the Manor garden, swam into his mind.
You wave her off. “No problem, Mrs Baxter, there’s no payment needed. I hope you’ll get some sleep.”
Malfoy shrugged again, waving his hand dismissively. “Yes yes, well, mystery solved, now please leave me to my uni work.”
“Yes, thank you, Weasley, that thought had occurred to me as well, but I doubt that my old fashioned parents would very much like to have a wedding reception with the groom stuck inside my arse, since I am
“That was you? You were eavesdropping?”
Ebba let Draco take the handle with an encouraging nod, and he started to turn the handle with so much force that the entire bowl almost tipped over.
The human nodded. “
“Obviously,” Draco drawled, but he sounded far more friendly than he had during their school years. “What brings you here, Nevi—?”
Well the least he could do was make sure they solved this thing,
“Heard what?”
“Did you not see me standing here when you came barging in?”
“Who?” Malfoy said, looking confused.
“I er… I asked Ron and Hermione about… about that thing… when you cough up flowers?” he says eventually.
