Malfoy looks at him in what Harry thinks is annoyance for a second before glancing down at the paper. He lets out a huff. Then painstakingly, he goes back to nosing out letters, glancing at Harry’s paper every now and then to make sure he’s getting the words right.
Eventually, they reach a set of doors that spell open at Thirty-nine’s presence, and Harry gapes. Spread out before him is what could be the lobby of a muggle hotel. Rugs and sofas litter a large expanse of space, and two sets of spiral staircases spiral up and up and Harry isn’t sure he can even make out a ceiling. Occasionally, he sees someone walk across the lobby or up and down the staircases.
. Except there had for him, and Harry struggles to hold on to the hope that maybe, just maybe, Draco will hear him out, take pity, and accept his apologies.
Malfoy’s hair, Harry quickly puts his hands under his thighs. He’s a bit horrified at the thought, but more than that, the idea of it sparks something in Harry’s chest that’s awfully similar to butterflies. It’s strange, and it’s new, and while it’s not a totally unwelcome feeling, Harry ignores it. His fingers tingle.
Thirty-nine eventually stops in front of a door somewhere deep within the compound. Harry’s pretty lost by now, and he figures he should have mapped out where they walked. The hallway they’re currently standing in is pristine and all-white, and it’s the brightest and cleanest place Harry has seen, ever. A window at the end of the hallway lets in light that only makes the place brighter, and the quiet is a sharp contrast to the bustle and noise of the rest of the building. This must be what heaven is like, Harry thinks absentmindedly.
Eventually, they find themselves in that last room. The one with the roof gone and Harry just sprawls himself across the ground, imagining himself hurt and burnt on the imaginary scorch mark. Ron stares at him for a second before joining. And they lie there, watching the sky go from gold and pink to a darker purple and their breath start to appear in tiny clouds of mist.
Edit: so I've realized I've got some inconsistencies here (Harry casts a patronus in chapter uh... Ok well he casts one after Ron leaves him a note at Draco's house) but here I said he hasn't cast one since the war, so I will be fixing that...
“A sick prison, that’s what it is,” Gale mutters darkly. “Know what we found?” she turns towards Harry.
Luna laughs, bright and clear, and Harry watches the scene unfold. The fox is jumping and weaving curtains of mist around Luna even as she continues to laugh and run after the blur of silver. It’s such a tranquil and… peacefully boring scene that Harry balks.
At least he’s not actively avoiding Harry now. He’d entered the room that morning determined to set things right. He’d greeted the fox that’d materialized in front of him with a smile and a “Draco,” and that’d been that. But now he doesn’t know what to do. He can talk to Malfoy, sure, and Malfoy will understand, but any conversation certainly won’t go both ways. If Harry’s gleaned nothing else, he knows  that Malfoy’s as silent as the mist that makes up his patronus.
Time passes slowly, or quickly. It’s not worth counting days by meals, he knows, because kidnappers really don’t care to be on time. He’s given food at random intervals, and in between, he dozes, daydreams, and tries to keep himself entertained. The only other person he sees is the person who delivers his food. He thinks it’s the same person anyways. The clothes are similar at least. Probably.
No one had visited today, and being a Sunday, it strikes Harry as a bit odd. But he doesn’t mind. It’s a rest day, he thinks. For once, it’s nice to be alone. His thoughts still run all over the place, but it’s harder to overthink in a place with no worries. So he doesn’t.
“I can imagine,” Harry says automatically. He fancies he wouldn’t like staying in a hospital alone all night either.
Hello! I orginally meant to post like every week but that didn't happen and the chapter's shorter than I would've liked TT^TT
, because the world won’t accept his efforts. They chuck his good-intentions back at him and call it plotting. They take his calm and repentant demeanor and call it manipulation. The world has run out of second chances and Harry couldn’t just give up his.
The four settle themselves around Draco’s living area, the doe squishing himself as close as possible to Harry’s legs without actually going through them.
The fox is still at it when Harry migrates to the kitchen for some coffee and breakfast, and he really only stops when Harry starts speaking.
Harry sits up, shoving his blankets to one side. He looks down and picks at his fingers and the loose threads. “I insulted him,” he whispers quietly. “I said he doesn’t try. I said he’d always be a Death Eater.”
. And every night, he goes back to fend off reports and “suggestions” from his fellow Auroras and Unspeakables and then to spend a sleepless night crying and thinking and thinking and thinking.
“There’s nothing to be angry over. And I’m not even that close with him.” A pause. “So I don’t really know how I feel. It’s just… empty.” He makes a vague gesture in the air.
Harry relaxes back into his chair and contents himself to listening to Luna talk and eating his treacle tarts. That's the thing with Luna. She always seems to know how Harry is feeling. And instead of questioning him, she rambles about whatever she wishes, allowing Harry to drift between her words and his thoughts, not settling on any particular thing.
Harry suddenly realizes that she’s treating him like a baby, and frustrated, he immediately flips over. “I’m not a baby!”
Hello again! Sorry once again for the late update; I really feel like I'll be apologizing a lot for that T^T
“Oh shut up. You try walking and holding this paper in front of your face and holding a conversation all at the same time. Anyways, you
Luna looks up at him, then with a slight pop, apparates right up besides him. She settles down gracefully even while Harry gawks, as if finding one’s friend on the roof and sitting down with them up there is the most natural thing in the world. But perhaps it is.
“I’m serious here, okay? I don’t care what you do once Malfoy’s… cured and out of the hospital, but while he’s in there, you are not to do anything rash or uncalled for. Do you understand?”
But now his father’s dead and his mother’s in France and no one will rescue him this time. He’s scared. He’s so very scared because he knows he’ll die this time. There’s only so many ways to avoid death. Each misfortune is a roll of the dice, and he’s run out of luck. He resigns himself to his fate, slowly but surely; yet even as he comes to understand this fact, he’s scared. He doesn’t want to die.
There’s regret, there’s pain, and there’s loneliness. Harry realizes that for the first time since Draco’s been back, he’s lonely. Meaning he hasn’t been lonely in the time between then and now. It’s such a little thing, and now that it’s gone, he misses it. It’s not the same, being with Draco’s comatose body and being with Draco’s soul. Draco’s soul is life and mind and magic all in one, and without it, his body’s just an empty shell of potential lost and gone.
He goes back out to the hallway, and looks at the furniture now blocking the walkway. A desk and a chair. Squeezing around them, he sets off, looking through room after room. Yet everything has really been cleared away and it’s all just tables and chairs now.
It’s not his ideal choice of reading per se, but there’s honestly nothing else in the house, and books will at least take some time to read. So he grabs a few in his arms and stalks out, resolutely ignoring the silver glow coming from the other side of the room.
Harry raises an eyebrow. Why Draco recognizes dungeon designs, he has no idea. But he’s starting to get an idea where Draco got his obsessiveness with house structures. He tells Owen what Draco said.
for you, I suspected as much and brought food with me.” He sits on the ground besides Harry and starts furiously pulling out takeout containers.
She makes it sound so simple, and for Harry, that’s enough for now. One step at a time. It’s simple.
Coffee forgotten, he stumbles back to his sleeping bag to stare blankly at the ceiling. He stares long enough that the first rays of gray sunlight are peaking through the window before he realizes.
Thirty-nine nods and folds his hands in front of his face like he’s spectating some kind of show. It does nothing for Harry’s nerves. “Yup, just cast your patronus at Mr. Malfoy here and it should do something. In theory.”
“You are! You’re the same as the lot of them! You’re thinking, why does this git get to run away and live peacefully while everyone else suffers! You’re thinking, it’s not right for me not to at least
Harry walks through Grasmere for the first time since Draco’s been found. He doesn’t even realize how long it’s been until he’s walking the familiar streets and admiring the landscape. He misses it, but at the same time, he knows he
“Draco!” she peers at the cloud of mist until Draco solidifies some and looks back. Blue-grey meets silver, and the fox launches himself across the gap to cling to Luna’s hair and yap silently.
The door opens and he hears it click shut. A second later, he feels the bed dip as Hermione sits, but he’s already resolved to never show his face again, so he stays curled up.
“Um, I’m not quite sure actually.” Malfoy lowers his head in dejection. “I-I’m sure they’re fine,” Harry says quickly. “I can ask her later for you if you’d like.”
But Luna seems satisfied with whatever she was deciding and turns away. She waves her wand, and with a pop, a plate of the cookies she just baked appears, settling down on the dusty table.
Harry glances down at the doe. The doe looks back at him. In the time they’ve been together, Draco hasn’t once talked about what happened during his abduction. Draco withholds and Harry does the same, and the only thing Harry really knows is that it probably—more like definitely—wasn’t nice. Unless Draco zoning out all those times was a regular thing that happened even before, Harry thinks there might’ve been some kind of trauma.
Then suddenly, a thought hits him. Why is he crying over Malfoy at all in the first place? Why is it Malfoy? Would he cry in the same way over Hermione? Ron? Luna? Ginny? Hadn’t he decided what he has is enough? Just him and his friends and family? So who is this
So Harry takes the hint and hurries down to the cafeteria. There’s quite a line, and no matter how hard he tries to will it to move faster, it doesn’t. In the end, he grabs a random sandwich off the shelf, pays, and dashes back up to the peace of Malfoy’s room.
“People change,” he sighs. “And your patronus is a reflection of yourself. So if you change, your patronus can change.” Harry pauses, wondering if he should go on. If he should go on and say that usually people’s patronuses change for people. For that someone. In the end, he holds his mouth shut. He’s… scared.
He’s talking to Malfoy again one day, and Malfoy’s lying on the bed, chin resting on his body’s chest. He looks as if he’s about to drift off the sleep, but Harry doesn’t mind. Company is company, and Malfoy listening is more than he’d ever hoped for. And suddenly, Malfoy’s form dissolves into a larger cloud of mist and Harry stops to stare, nervous and apprehensive.
staring at the sleeping doe when the fireplace beside him flares green and a fizzle shoots out, followed by a loud
“Mal—Draco.” The fox pauses just for a second, then cautiously looks at Harry. Harry lets out a breath. “I figured we could talk this way. You can point to the letters and I can read it out?”
Harry did indeed visit Hermione right after he left. But he supposes he might not have thought it through and had barged into her office right in the middle of a meeting. He had then sheepishly backed through the door and sat at Hermione’s desk, licking his wounds. When she did get out of her meeting, she had gently scolded him, then explained apologetically that she wouldn’t have much time to talk. But would he mind dropping by for dinner some time?
Harry rather expected it to be an awkward affair. He's never been one to invite people—or acquaintances—over, seeing as he's not really proud of his home. It's dusty and dark, and in the three or so years that he's lived there, he still hasn't found a calling in interior design or remodeling. Not to mention Kreacher's vehement protests whenever Harry so much as touches a Black heirloom or a piece of antique furniture. So he's pretty much left the house to its own—and Kreacher's—devices.
He’s still playing with Malfoy’s hand distractingly when he glances out the window to gauge the time. The sun’s almost set now, and the sky’s a brilliant splash of pinks and purples that fades into a darker blue. And just as he’s about to look away, he sees the gentle pulse of mist on the windowsill.
More and more often, he starts finding himself in Luna’s kitchen when he needs a break from the world. The world that always needs him. Him as an auror and hero. Not him as Harry, just a broken and angry man who desperately wants it all the stop. Who wants to walk into the ministry and give Robards a piece of his—oh wait.
Harry stares at the ceiling. He stares long and hard, and lets his eyes roam over the tiny grooves and bumps until they all blend together into one big mess. Dust motes and light dance across his vision, and his frustration and anxiety drifts. He closes his eyes, sandwich having long since slid out of his hand and now lay forgotten on the floor.
There are few guards in this place, and occasionally, one will pace down the hall outside his cell, sneering at him with their patronuses trotting or swimming after them. Draco envies them. He envies their freedom and their bare arms and their magic. The only time he feels something other than despair is that infuriating frustration at his lack of magic. Since having his wand taken away, and given his government-issued wand that does the bare minimum, he’s never taken magic for granted. He misses the warmth underneath his fingers, that thrill of magic and smoothness that flows through him when a complicated spell goes right.
“Well, I mean, since you can clearly leave the hospital, then that means we don’t have to stay there all day do we? I can be with you elsewhere?”
Thirty-nine accompanies Harry to St. Mungo’s the next morning. Having been temporarily admitted into the Aurora department, Robards had also temporarily dismissed him from the Aurors. But he’d worried over Victor, and at least he’d managed to convince Robards to watch over Victor in his absence. So it’s without any lasting guilt that he follows Thirty-nine through hallway after hallway into a part of the hospital he’s never seen before.
He takes his time sitting up—takes in the room, the windows, and his friends at his side. He roves over Luna’s form in the corner, further over, and right at his feet—Harry sees a deer for the first time in years.
For a while, he stands. He catches his breath and organizes his thoughts, and when he thinks he’s ready for a civilized conversation, he turns around.
“Well nothing to be done about that now, mate!” Ron jumps into the conversation and just as soon passes out on the floor.
After all, he just wants to be there. To be there when Malfoy reaches that dream. To be there when the shards come together and bless him with that calm, that peace, that bit of Malfoy that has since shook him all those days ago.
If Draco senses the turmoil rolling off of him, he certainly gives no indication. Instead, Harry only watches as Draco sprints and jumps through the air, observing the fox as if to strip the mist down to pure thoughts and rational. And if Draco starts taking the decreasingly rare moments where Harry’s silent and thinking to cautiously perch on his head or shoulders, well, Harry lets him.
But his mother’s here right now and she’s petting his hair and combing through it. She’s whispering those sweet nothings again. Reassurance that no, Draco, I don’t hate you. Will always love you.
Imaginary-Harry shakes his head. “Probably from Hogwarts though, since he remembers you and your friends.”
“This is the main reason, we’re here,” the head Unspeakable says. “Mr. Malfoy seems to have ejected his soul in the form of his patronus.”
It's also like some kind of barrier has been breached and broken, once they both realize Draco can freely leave the room. The day after, Harry leaves the hospital promptly at 8 PM, and doesn't question it when he feels the fox still clinging to his shoulder. Draco lets himself fade as they approach the crowds exiting the hospital and around the nearby apparition point, but as soon as Harry's landed properly at Number 12 Grimmauld Place, the fox is back in full force, tail wagging in excitement.
, and then suddenly I hear that cursed alarm going off in the aurors’ department, and next thing you know, there’s a stampede going down the hall and insane amounts of screaming like you wouldn’t believe—”
It’s strange how quickly Harry reverts back to his sixth-year habits of stalking Malfoy. Only, this time around, Malfoy is really missing and Harry doesn’t have a map to point him. It’s all just ink on crinkled paper and the empty whispers of a man hated and lost.
no less. And he’s frustrated and mad, because suddenly, this precious experience was just taken away from him and he can’t even do anything about it. He has no say, and there’s no control over the one thing he
“Thank you,” he whispers, more to himself than anything really. But he pretends nevertheless. “What would I do without you.”
Harry rights himself and whirls around to face the doe, who’s now sitting right where Harry had been previously. The ears and tail are flicking furiously.
It happens a few more times over the next few days, and with each occasion, the cloud shifts more and more into something less vague yet not concrete at all. But it’s the fox that always returns at the end of the day, and with it, the relief and peace.
He looks back up at imaginary-Harry, who’s still glaring at him, and cries harder. He erases this angry Harry, and struggles to conjure up another memory of Harry. Harry when he was younger, back at school. A happy Harry who smiled and laughed, and Draco could pretend it was all directed at himself.
He stops abruptly and turns to look with wide eyes at the fox. Draco tilts his head and imitates Harry’s expression.
But Draco isn’t slowing down and only seems to be getting more furious with every passing second, and Harry finally reaches out and shreds the paper. He tears it into halves and more halves, and because his fingers are still jittery, he crumples the pieces together and chucks the ball out the window as hard as he can.
“A friend described it to me once,” she states simply. “Seemed nice with all the plants. We could never have all these plants in the Ravenclaw common room. It was bad for the books.”
He watched as something impossible simply became more impossible, step by step, word by word. All by his own hand. And now, years after everything and having sealed away his feelings, Harry barges into his life again just to yell and berate him, and Draco can’t take it. He’d worked hard at first, trying to get a Ministry position, and when that didn’t work, set up his own potions business at Knockturn. But even there, the landlords were unwilling to offer him a space. He tried place after place and place and it was only after a full year and a half of rejection and homelessness that he gave up. And it was Luna who had found him after so long and helped him back up—
But Harry knows he’s only running away. He’s trying; he’s trying so hard to try and stuff Malfoy into the imaginary cabinet labeled “acquaintance.” But it doesn’t fit—
Harry realizes that it’s already the fifth day Malfoy’s been missing when he wakes the next morning; which is honestly pretty strange once he thinks about it, because time has flown for him. Is time supposed to fly when someone is missing? Probably not. But he can’t think of any reason for it to be otherwise.
Harry himself had wondered a great deal about Malfoy’s whereabouts. While some part of Harry still thought of Malfoy as the Hogwarts git, the rest of him had been too tired to care. So why did he care? Harry supposed it was jealousy. He was jealous that Malfoy got to escape the world. That
see again, there are ears flicking in front of his chest. He screams and flinches himself away and almost into the fireplaces.
“Ah,” Luna tilts her head and squints at him a bit before continuing. “I probably should’ve told you that those are my test cookies.”
He’s been awake from sunset to sunrise. He’s lived from life, to now, and eventually to death. And finally,
. All he’s wanted from Harry is just calm and quiet. He wants that gentle demeanor Harry gives his friends. He wants that smile, that trust, that companionship. His Imaginary-Harry was exactly that. And when he appears, Draco cries in his arms and lets himself dream.
Everything is messed up, and he simply needs to fix it. But he’s stubbornly refusing to do so, and Harry thinks—no, he
Harry looks away as Ron lets out a series of coughs. “Dammit mate. I never thought I’d get motion sick from apparating. We’re definitely going back in small leaps.”
It’s times like these that fills Harry with a sense of nostalgia. He’s nostalgic for something he’s never had, and since he’s never had it, he also doesn’t know what it is. But it’s nostalgia all the same, and it’s nice, and it’s sad.
“Okay okay look,” Harry starts over, “it—no after the war—the world was messed up. Yeah? So now we gotta fix it.”
Harry glances at the doe. Draco looks back. He’s quivering, and Harry’s so muddled in his own thoughts that he can’t distinguish his own emotions from Draco’s anymore. Is he excited? Scared? Is
The Dementors never come close to kissing him except once, for which he is glad. They seem to heed whatever instruction Draco had heard given to them, and it was only one incident where the realistic Imaginary-Harry had yelled such hurtful words that Draco had really just considered starving himself and dying. Immediately, a Dementor had swooped in and gripped his neck, lowering its hood with the other hand and coming closer. He couldn’t have moved away if he wanted to.
He’s aware of part of the problem though. He doubts his sudden outburst and shredding of paper would be fine with anyone, much less Draco, someone he’s still technically on shaky terms with and was just starting to build a budding friendship with. But he’d
“He’ll be ok,” the healers says suddenly, and Harry starts. “His body will be fine, and we’re just trying to find a way to get his soul back in. That’s it.”
I. Have. Never written this much dialogue in my life. Ever. Between that many people. Never again. *shivers*
It’s when Harry gets home from work that he turns into a worrying mess of tears and regret. Maybe he has a late reaction time—right, a
He’s just sitting now, letting his voice rest and thinking that maybe he’s beyond forgiveness. Perhaps he’s gone too far this time and there’s really no turning back. It’s a terrifying thought. It’s like dying.
Harry gasps, and practically falls out of his chair in his endeavor to get to Draco. He scrambles, and by the time he’s standing cautiously next to the window, there are tears welling up in his eyes.
“Oh relax,” Owen says with a hand on Robards’ shoulder. “I’m sure Harry here will be fine. Just do the best you can. That’s all we ask for. Any little bit of information may help.”
“Luna’s fine. She’s still making those terrible cookies. She tested them out on me when you were gone,” he pouts.
“Maybe so, but if laying everything out where you can physically see it makes you feel better,” he waves a hand at the covered floor, “I can get that.”
He stills, and as he waits, the mist slowly solidifies into the small fox. He’s facing away from Harry, looking out the window at the same sunset, at the same sky. And even as a breeze blows through the room, Malfoy’s mist sways and flows, blurring the image. He fades in and out of sight, and suddenly, Harry wonders how long Malfoy’s sat there, even if Harry couldn’t see him.
After all, just as how speech is the voice of the mind, is writing not the voice of the soul? Harry, with his abrupt and spontaneous life, constantly stopping, changing directions, his rash and loud personality that defies structure yet upholds justice—does his handwriting not suit him well? Harry thinks it works anyways.
And with a wave and a spin, she disappears down the street. Harry stands there for a while, still dazed, before looking down at the small package in his hands. Time to brew some tea.
“Right well, getting to the point, I assume you’ve heard of the attacks this morning?” Robards leans back against the sofa, the tenseness draining out of him as he sinks into the material.
, he’ll forget everything. And he’ll simply drag this one second out to another, and another, until he can’t anymore and he loses this rare feeling.
“We also ask you to send Thirty-nine a message if you discover anything with souls,” One declares. “I will also send him personally on occaision to check on Mr. Malfoy’s condition. Know that Malfoy’s healers are aware of our investigation.”
Then looking at Harry again, he seems to come to a decision. In one swift movement, he yanks Harry inside and quickly closes the door, putting a silencing charm around his office. “Okay, now sit.”
Harry sighs. “You know what, let’s start over. You’ve changed, and I’d like to think I’ve changed, so we’re strangers now.”
“But he clearly said…” He whirls to face the doe, who’s staring at him with eyes that must be as wide as his own. “You did say something right?”
With no more excuses, Harry panics for a second. Then he decides to fuck it and just get it over with. He apparates over to Luna’s and raps on the door.
They all laugh at that one, and Harry hears a third person in the background that can only be Hermione. Then Luna settles besides him, giving a grin of her own. “I really liked the dragon one,” she says.
“Ugh, fuck you. Is your brain messed up or something now? Dark lord drive you crazy? Well either way, I’ll get straight to the point.”
The Dementor’s holding him up by the chin now and the terrible head is coming for him, that gaping mouth sucking at the air and Draco feels his own mouth open, unbidden.
Harry thinks he’s comfortable here. No, he knows he’s comfortable here. For once, it’s peaceful. There’s a nice quiet that’s so different from the sickening silence of Grimmauld, and in this place so far from home, he wonders how it’s possible. There’s the sound of insects and the quiet chatter of far away conversations and Harry never wants to leave. Never wants to go back to the rushed life and social obligations waiting back at London. Never wants to leave this feeling of
For once, Harry doesn’t know if he’s mad. Doesn’t know if he’s sad or upset or in shock. He doesn’t know whether he is supposed to cry or yell or whatever the appropriate reaction is, so he settles for nothing and simply sits and stares.
Harry’s the one making them tea this time, and he listens to Luna’s chatter and the silent pauses in between as he focuses on the tea leaves.
Anyways guess I'll try to post more often from now (seeing as I'm stuck home due to the coronavirus... stay healthy/safe y'all!)
Harry looks around at the mess. He had crumpled many of the papers in his sleep, and he pulls them over to smooth them out. He feels like he’s drifting. Everything’s surreal and messy and how is this not a dream? Is it a dream? He’ll never know.
“It’s a good thing he didn’t build that pyramid.” Owen frowns. “But if the resistance has his plans, that’s not much better.”
Night turns to day, and as always, the moon leaves the stage to the sun. Sleep relinquishes its hold, and Harry wakes. Another day, another life; to start and live as he pleases.
It’s always the kitchen, he muses. He might as well just spend his life living in people’s kitchens. Yet it’s Malfoy’s kitchen this time, and there’s that golden light again, and, even with the lack of furniture, it’s comfortable and warm.
It takes him a moment to recall everything that happened the previous night, but when he does, he drops his head back on the floor with a gentle thud. But where’s Ron? He turns his head around, not willing to get up quite yet, and spies the note on the ground next to his head. He shoves the rock holding the paper down away, and holds the note up in front of his face, squinting at it.
While it’s certainly not the first time, Draco dreads it all the same. Each time comes as a surprise, a shock, and before the relief that comes with his rescue, he panics and panics and panics because his life dangles in the hands of strangers.
When Harry finally feels his feet hit solid ground, he turns around only to see his auror partner already set on obliviating and warding off muggles from the scene of crime. He had had his doubts at first about the man, but Victor Walker turned out to be a solid-good auror, even if he is younger and inexperienced. He does his work wordlessly and efficiently, and makes up for shortcomings with sharp observation and intuition. He rather gives off Luna-vibes, Harry muses, albeit not as dreamy or… crazy.
“Okay okay fine. The healers are actually stuck up, prejudiced people who don’t give a shit about the Malfoys. But let them do their job! God knows how hard it is to deal with whining customers.” Harry has to strain to hear that last bit, but he hears it nonetheless.
Luna’s whips around to stare at him, and the sudden movement startles him into almost rolling off again. “Harry.” A sigh. “You can’t do that.”
He really shouldn’t be surprised. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Harry counts back the years and months from the trials and knows this is around the time Malfoy would be let off probation. He’s probably here for paperwork or something, his rational side supplies. And yet...
In the end, it takes Harry until late afternoon to remember to contact Thirty-nine about Draco’s change. He spends basically the entire afternoon before that curled on the couch, napping, with the doe on the rug beside him.
When Robards and Owen crash the fireplace around noon, no one’s surprised. The doe glances at Harry, and when Harry rises to greet them, Draco trots behind him.
They have all of Draco’s boxes carried over from where they had been stored at Luna’s, and although there’s many of them, Harry has barely found any furniture. With Draco’s guidance, he unpacks and puts the various objects around the house. Pictures on the walls, books to line the shelves, and an endless supply of potions ingredients, cauldrons, and literally everything and some that Harry swears he’s seen at the Apothecary on Diagon.
Harry thanks the gods for Kreacher’s slightly-creepy intuition for making Ron bring him a sleeping bag and more blankets. He had been dreading the idea of sleeping on the floor again. Ron himself had left right after dinner, but not before promising to come back the next morning with breakfast and anything else Harry might need for his indefinite stay.
Harry doesn’t know how long he stares at the doe. Thoughts flit through his mind and disappear just as quick, and there
“We don’t have to do anything in particular,” Luna reiterates. “Being with people you like is perfectly fine.”
“Did you—” Harry takes a breath, his voice shaky. “Did you contact St. Mungo’s?” His eyes beg, pleading that Victor did the right thing when he was so out of it. Because it all wouldn’t matter if Malfoy were to die.
And Harry understands that as long as Malfoy lives, the world will always fight him, even when the former has given up. It is obvious now. The attack and now the kidnapping—all when the war is supposed to be three years in the past and Malfoy has been hiding away.
It’s Hermione who comforts him this time. With her little pats on the shoulder and whispers of “It’s ok, it’s ok. That’s perfectly fine, Harry.”
Yet even while he’s being roughly shoved up and bundled out into the hall with the blindfold back on, Draco’s mind is whirring. He jumps between his fear and his curiosity and he almost misses the pop of apparition. Shit, well, if they’re moving him, it’d only be harder to find him—if anyone was looking in the first place. But still, he thinks. The Ministry had wiped Azkaban of Dementors, and at the time, that had been that. He supposes he hadn’t really considered what had happened to the Dementors themselves. But in some way, he knows where they are now—with the resistance—and it’s not a happy thought. What were they doing with Dementors?
The man takes that as a no; not that he’s wrong. “I’m disappointed. What happened to daddy’s boy? Where’s the ‘My father will hear about this?’”
it, before the next hurricane or tornado comes along and tears it all back down with nowhere to start from again.
Harry and Draco stare at each other for a moment before following her in. Sitting at Luna’s table, the room always bathed in that golden glow, it’s as if Harry’s stepped into an alternate reality. The smell of breezes and herbs fill the air, and the sound of quiet domesticity stirs and awakens a quiet pain somewhere Harry didn’t know existed.
But now, doing this, this repetitive motion of laying down the tiles and shingles, Harry might be feeling just the tiniest bit of regret. Not for joining the magical world, but regret for forgetting the joy of actually using his hands. He decides right then and there that he really ought to be reconsidering his priorities. Anything to live and feel this joy again.
Draco doesn’t want to open his eyes. Doesn’t want to see where they left him, and the horrors waiting for him. He just wants to cry and sleep and cry. He wants to die and he wants to live and he wants to get out. He wants everything at once and he panics and suddenly there’s a cold
But his worries are laid to rest almost immediately. As soon as Harry crosses the threshold, the fox is bounding off animatedly, leaving trails of mist in his wake. He swirls indiscriminately through walls and doors in a whirlwind of movement, and when he accidentally jumps through Kreacher, who’s bringing up a cup of tea and ends up yelping and dropping it instead, Harry nearly falls to the floor with laughter.
Moving carefully through the wreckage, Harry searches the house for anything out of the ordinary. The objects littering the rooms give hints as to what was there before—a library, the kitchen, a sitting room, bathroom, and, huh, a potions brewery.
The shouting gets louder, and as he starts to see guards running down the hall, the words become clear.
Hermione’s openly observing him now, and Harry can feel her worrying gaze as she rakes over his face. She takes the paper and folds it neatly before filing it back into her bag. “Are you okay, Harry? I’m sure it’s kind of sudden, but I know you don’t read the paper and just in case you hadn’t heard yet…”
“Well just as Ron said, there’s not much you can do about that now. Unless you want to take it apart?”
And when the war ends, he sees his parents, alive but reflections of their past. He fills in the gaps of his knowledge, pretends a number of scenarios. He imagines his parents dying. He imagines his parents going away. Away to anywhere but here. He imagines himself alone, doing potions in the middle of nowhere, and being friends with Luna in a place that he finally makes for himself.
to tell Aaron that he really ought to gather more testimonials and proof before he tries to do anything
He tries to make small talk. He asks about the weather, about their day, about their favorite colors and times of day and books they like to read. But whoever it is simply regards him with silence and walks away after setting down the tray of food.
And if Harry isn’t the antagonist anymore then someone would have taken his place. Someone the world is against and is forced to fight against it with every last breath of their being, just like how Harry had. And that someone is Malfoy now, and Harry finally understands why Malfoy was so mad, so hurt, so frustrated.
He’s just talking Victor through the reports back at the office when Robards and a small group of Aurors and Unspeakables walk by. He ignores them at first, but then one of them whispers “Malfoy” and suddenly, Harry’s all ears. Grabbing Victor’s shoulder, he ignores the startled look and whispers urgently.
Harry continues to stare, and there’s turmoil in his chest and he’s trying to decide if it’s guilt or pity or something else. Malfoy looks dead. Harry doesn’t understand how he
“And we didn’t actually find any Dementors ourselves,” Mike cuts in. “We only found all the prisoners soul-less.”
“How did you like our new, beta-version, indoor-fireworks?” George adds, squishing Ron out of the way. “Safe—if not a bit loud—won’t set things on fire, and
So I guess I'll be doing random song recs (ignore if you'd like) for stuff I just feel fit the vibe so...
“That’s pathetic!” Harry screams. “If you don’t try, then all you’ll be is a Death Eater! You’ll always be a Death Eater!” He grabs Malfoy’s left arm and shoves the sleeve up. “This!” Still gripping Malfoy’s arm, he shakes the faded mark in front of Malfoy’s face. “This is all you will ever amount to!”
Then there’s a quiet knock at the door and a healer comes bustling in. She gives Harry a nod and proceeds to weave a complicated set of spells around Malfoy’s bed. And Harry remembers. Malfoy’s in a coma. Practically dead. No memories, no feelings, no control. The only thing that’s still Malfoy is the small fox, and even that is something shaky and not at all grounding.
He sees his therapist the third evening, and he tells her that he’s never thought this much in his life. For once, he’s thinking more than he talks or acts, and she simply tells him that it’s a positive thing; he’s moving in the right direction. And he knows. He
Ron clears his throat, breaking the silence that always follows his teas. “So, care to enlighten me how we don’t see each other for a few days only for me to find you screaming ‘Malfoy’ and wreaking havoc in St. Mungo’s?”
He then spends the rest of the morning flipping meticulously through Malfoy’s notes, making his own notes in a separate journal. He would’ve just written in the margins of Malfoy’s, but he feels guilty enough for snooping as it is, and doing so would be a level of intimacy that thinly borders intrusion. Yet the more he reads through the journal, the more Harry’s amazed at the level of detail. There’s so much information—and extra history—that Harry doubts he’ll even have to do more research on his own.
“Who? Wait, the Weasleys are part of the Twenty-Eight right? Are you guys okay? Did they attack the store? Who did it?”
He thinks that normally, he never really has any problem with small talk and starting conversations. But this is
Hermione manages to huff and sigh at the same time. “Oh don’t worry, I didn’t tell him about all the petty stalking. Just that you two have a bit of history from Hogwarts. Robards filled in the rest anyways.”
Instead, he sits back and summons a bottle of butterbeer. After the incident with Luna, Harry’s found that he’s not as avid about getting drunk on a rooftop as he probably would have been before. It’s a romantic concept really, to sit under the sky with a drink, but he’d rather not risk rolling off the roof with no one to catch him this time. So he sips his butterbeer and enjoys his rationality as much as he can, which is to say, not a lot.
He shuffles to his chair, and glancing at Draco’s face on the pillow, he bows his head silently. He doesn’t know how long he sits, zoning out, when he finally lifts his head to get rid of the cricks in his neck. And there, on the windowsill, is the small misty form of Draco’s fox.
“Ah, yes, the joke shop. Gotta say, they put up quite the fight. Found all the attackers covered in pixies and books and facedown in a moat. It was a pleasant surprise,” Owen says with a chuckle. Then he frowns. “The other stores weren’t as lucky.”
Hermione moves into focus. “No, shush, Ron. I’m sure if Harry were a girl, he—or she’d—tell us, right?”
Harry sighs and gestures at the water barrier. “It started raining and I couldn’t just leave and let the house flood!”
Even during the peak of his teenage hero-saving antics, he wasn’t stupid enough to try to overthrow the Ministry. The Ministry is
And Harry can’t follow along anymore after that, and he struggles to keep himself from simply trying to grab Draco and shake him and tell him to
Harry pauses in his discourse on Europe’s current Quidditch league to re-read what he’d just written on his own sheet of paper. Malfoy’s house? Oh shit, right. His house.
physical things and they have words, and descriptions. And it’s beautiful in the way that he understands it.
He catches up with Robards just as the group is heading into his office, and he clings to the closing door panting. “Is this about Malfoy?” he demands.
“Yeah, we gotta get the aurors outa our hair and Hermione still has work. Talk to you guys later? Maybe meet up some time for dinner?”
“And it’s totally fine if we get lost. We have plenty of time—hey, don’t give me that look, I took a day off work—so we can wander the whole village until we find it, and that’s ok.”
Malfoy, so Harry sits on his hands and watches the fox settle on Malfoy’s chest and let out a yawn. When it finally spies Thirty-nine, the fox looks away resolutely. But to look away is to look at Harry, and as soon as the fox does, it yelps silently and disappears in a whiff of mist.
Harry surges forward and Luna gasps. The doe scoots forward to sit right beside Harry and just as close to the fireplace.
He sits and trembles in that chair, in that room, in this beautiful wing of the hospital that’s also somewhere new and strange. If Grasmere’s at the edge of the world, then this place is above it. Somewhere high above between that horizon and the sky.
In the end, it was Baker who suddenly popped by and shooed the Dementor away with a wave of his wand. Baker simply stood and looked down with his usual disdain at Draco, who, by now, was filthy and ragged and really couldn’t care less about what Baker was planning to do.
And while Harry had spent that time hiding within the confines of Grimmauld place, away from all the noise and chaos, the two remaining Malfoys had simply disappeared. For another while, the roar of public outrage rose to unprecedented heights. Then when weeks turned into months and still nothing new had emerged regarding the Malfoys, the world finally seemed to accept that this was just another thing that just is.
Malfoy frowns, just a slight downturn of his mouth, and still not looking at Harry. “Then why are you here?”
But he’s determined and has a purpose today, so he gathers his nerves and speaks up. “Hello, Malfoy. Is Luna there? I’d like to talk with her.”
Harry Potter, but also because of his swollen eyes he hasn’t managed to get down to a normal level. A healer stops him on his way to Draco’s room and passes him a potion to help with the swelling, and thanking him, he downs it in one gulp.
over and over until it’s all Draco hears. Until it’s all Draco is. He’s just a Death Eater in the end. That’s it.
Harry opens his mouth, then closes it. He’s frustrated for sure, but if Hermione had reason to personally ask Robards to bar Harry from the case, who is he to go against it? Of course, that doesn’t mean he has to take it nicely. He spins back around with a sniff.
Harry wakes to blinding light and refractions of tiny rainbows dancing across his squinted eyes. It’s never been this bright, and to say that Harry regrets getting rid of his horrid curtains is an understatement. But nothing stops the forces of nature, and when he’s finally rubbed his eyes open, it’s to the disorienting view of a misty paw batting at some floating strands of his hair.
One of the aurors clears his throat then and Harry looks up. “Nice to meet you Mr. Potter. I’m the head of the Aurora Department. Calling me Owen is fine.”
It doesn’t take as long as Harry thought it would for them to find Malfoy’s house. Turns out he still remembers most of the way, and then it’s just a matter of wandering around to find the one house with scorch marks and a roof open to the sky. Ron lets out a low whistle when they finally reach the front gate. Harry watches as his eyes rove over the building, knowing that, even after all this time, his six months of auror training must be kicking in.
But Harry, it was and always is Harry. It’s Harry he looks for, Harry he worries over, and Harry he silently cheers for in the safe confines of his mind. In his dreams, it’s Harry who rescues him, Harry who smiles at him, Harry who saves him from the depths of his despair.
Finally, Harry stands and stretches. “You’re probably sick of me now, Malfoy, so I’ll get out of your hair and go home for today.”
“Merlin, Harry, you scared me. I almost dropped the entirety of Ron’s tea collection.” She rolls her eyes fondly. “So, is there anything you need?”
It’s a few days later—Harry’s given up keeping track of the days now—that he stands up one afternoon to go grab a late lunch. Draco’s still perched on his shoulder as he had been all morning, and it isn’t until Harry’s halfway down the hallway that he realizes Draco’s still there. He can leave the hospital room.
explosives and potions. Not to mention our moat, pixies, snapping books, exploding quills, booby traps—”
Someone comes back to his cell to grab him soon enough, and Draco’s trembling all over again from a different sort of fear.
“Well,” Hermione starts, “About an hour ago now, there were a bunch of sudden and simultaneous attacks on a lot of businesses and stores. Most notably, many of these have been found to be belonging to the Sacred Twenty-Eight. We’re warning you guys just in case.”
He’s halfway through the second book when Ron apparates into the room with a bang and a pop. Harry’s so invested in his reading at this point that he yelps and bangs his head against the wall behind him. Then he looks up with a frustrated glare.
He sits besides Draco’s body anyway. He watches dazedly as the wind teases blond hair and light flickers over pale skin. He tangles the tips of his fingers with Draco’s hand, and imagines that this is
“The blood of halfbloods and muggleborns flowed to save us! Not save you! We died for a better society! Not for the continuation of a flawed peace at the hands of people like you! There’s a blood debt the purebloods owe us, and we’re invoking it.”
He rearranges the potions room to Draco’s liking, and he almost startles at that silver glow coming from that one wall of shelves. The vials of memories are as glaring as always, and he’s sure the fox catches him standing and staring at some point. But Draco doesn’t elaborate and Harry doesn’t push.
“God knows how many times I’ve already tried to ask him something only for him to just disappear,” Mike pouts miserably.
“No,” Harry and Luna say at the same time. Harry throws Luna a grateful glance, which she returns with an amused smile.
Shaking his head in amused exasperation, Harry sets the pastries down and looks around the kitchen. He always loves Luna’s place. Her cottage takes residence on the edges of Grasmere, and warded off from muggles, she has taken to growing all sorts of magical plants—inside and outside her house—which in turn attracts a number of magical creatures. Warm sunlight filters through the windows, and feeling more relaxed than he has in awhile, Harry allows himself to lower his guard.
“Well you see, being a qualified and legal joke shop, we are also legally allowed to be in possession of a bunch of,
Also, I'm considering doing a switching POV thing? Not sure. But if so, the next chapter would be from Draco's pov. Thoughts?
Lunch seems to fly by, with Harry feeling giddy and floaty the entire time, no thanks to the cookies. It’s a bit like being drunk, he thinks, and he tells Luna as much. She hums in response and whips out a small notepad to record it down.
the world and the world with Harry. He protects his place and the world gives him respect and places him on a pedestal that’s all too wobbly.
But nothing lasts, and just as he’s beginning to think that he’s safe, his home is blasted open and he’s cruelly burned again and left to die in a place at the edge of the world. But it’s okay. He lived. He’s alive and well, and as long as that’s that, he can fix it. He will fix it. He’ll put the pieces together as lovingly as the first time, and it will all be fine. He has Luna and he has his home. It’ll be okay.
But this belief is interesting, because Malfoy’s writing is smooth and flowy. Harry thinks back to his last encounters with Malfoy, and eventually decides that perhaps it’s justified. Malfoy’s strangely soft now, and who’s he to decide if smooth handwriting describes him or not? He doesn’t know this Malfoy anymore. He certainly knows the Malfoy from Hogwarts, however, and if he had had this flowy handwriting back then too, well... Harry would think about that later if it ever comes up. Yet for now, Harry simply wonders if he will ever calm down enough for his handwriting to smooth over—to achieve that peace where every word need not be rushed; where nothing needs to be rushed.
He looks for a house, and he lets Luna lead him around her quaint little town and decide that this is a place he can call home. So he finds the perfect cottage and brews his potions and bakes with Luna, and makes his house his home. It’s not perfect and it’s hard and half the world may hate him, but here, where no one knows him except Luna, it doesn’t matter. It’s all precious to him, and that’s enough.
But then that thought seems to stick in his mind and he can’t get over the possibility that maybe this notebook is something Malfoy treasured. Something that’s genuine and real and maybe he has a piece of Malfoy here with him, right in his hands. Even if the real Malfoy is lost somewhere in the vast, vast world.
As soon as the door quietly clicks shut, there’s mist shooting out of Malfoy’s chest again and there’s a silvery fox peeking at Harry from behind Malfoy’s body. It’s still and unmoving except for the occasional ear or tail flick, and Harry stares unmoving back. Eventually he tries to reach out a hand towards it, but immediately, the fox flinches back and growls silently.
“Yeah well, we were thinking of something for April Fools’ or Halloween and decided to test stuff? And they gave us a perfect opportunity so why not? Anyways, we’re a-okay! The moat was a bit too sticky though. Gonna take forever to clean…”
“Doesn’t matter.” She waves a hand vaguely. “You have to respect people’s space. If you can’t ask now, then wait until he gets back.”
For a while after the “forgive and forget,” their conversations return to the shallow and willful topics that previously graced their companionship. It’s not ideal, Harry decides. Where he once rejoiced at the little tidbits of information he received, he now feels the need for something more solid, more real. Bricks and wood may decorate the house, but he wants the concrete foundation Draco’s rooted himself with. He wants it—
Draco’s dozing again when there’s shouting and clanging coming from down the hall. He rouses himself, and for once, his interest is piqued. He presses his face to the bars on his cell and strains to see the commotion. Clearly, the few other prisoners have the same idea, because he glimpses others also watching.
“Oh. How do you hear?” Harry remembers something. “And how do you think? The other day you said you don’t have a mind?”
Saturday dawns golden and misty, and Harry revels in the slanted beams of sunlight that filter through the clouds and into the sky-room. Everything’s white and grey and gold, and for a while, he simply allows himself to be fascinated by the dust motes floating through the air. Eventually though, he drags himself up to begin the day’s work.
With everyone introduced, the meeting progresses. They go over the finer details of Malfoy’s case, including the chase and tip-off that led to his finding. It’s new but already summarized by Robards. Then they move on to the newer findings and Harry sits up straighter.
“Ah yes, that’s the building we found you in. Radolphus Lestrange seems to have been the last to be in ownership of it.”
At least, Harry decides, it’s quite nice to walk around without all the rush and hustle of a big city. No reporters, no paparazzi, no one to judge his every action the moment he leaves his house. He takes a deep breath, taking in the rustling trees and cottages, all under that vast blue sky. He thinks he can appreciate it.
Draco ducks and trembles. And before he can regret his decision, he gives a quick shake of his head. “I refuse to join.”
So he takes the bait, glad that at least he’s allowed to flounder without any judging eyes. “I’m not sure.” It comes out like a question.
And when Harry’s produced another alphabet paper, he sets it down gently on the windowsill, weighing it down with a pen.
“The tip-off led us to what seemed to be an abandoned manor belonging to the Lestrange family on the outskirts of London.” Owen taps his finger on the map that’s now covering the table. “We believe it used to belong to Radolphus Lestrange. We’re not sure how the resistance came to occupy the building.”
“Wait wait, let me get another piece of paper.” Harry quickly conjures another one, and when he’s properly set with his pen in hand, Malfoy carefully starts nosing at the paper.
So I'm on page 70 of my google doc now and it's really starting to lag sometimes and I don't understand how ppl who write like 50k+ words fics deal with this?? Do y'all use Word or smth??
Harry doesn’t know when he started noticing, but there are tears rolling down Malfoy’s face now, and there’s a look of pure hurt and hatred directed towards him. Malfoy snaps his arm out of Harry’s grasp and steps back a few steps.
miss it. He’s been with Draco from day one, and being with Draco was as good as being in Grasmere. And he comes to the sudden understanding that perhaps his ties to this place has always been Draco, Draco, Draco.
“You did?” Harry asks, pleasantly surprised. “I really meant it, I’m sorry, I don’t know how much you heard—”
Luna just looks at him for a bit before putting everything away into her bag. “Harry, sometimes, people don’t feel safe so they create their own safe place.” She maneuvers Harry into a standing position, then apparates them to the ground. “And this safe place should remain a safe place. You can’t take it away.”
—the boy that taunted and teased Harry and stalked Hogwarts like a prince. What did the world know about him? What right did they have to torment this specific person like so? And now he is bleeding all over again, and the lights are reflecting harshly off the bathroom tiles and the blood, oh god, the
Luna grins a bit before busying herself. They drink their tea in silence, and Harry flounders between panic and mild confusion. What is a person even supposed to say after such an announcement? Luna obviously has her reasons for whatever strange thing she’s always doing, and Harry really doesn’t know if he should read more into it or not.
He ends up spending the better part of the day going through the entire thing, with his own journal full of random scribbles and drawings that serve no other purpose but to satisfy curious wonderment. But for all the information and detail, Malfoy’s handwriting remains neat and precise and constant, and Harry couldn’t help but to stop occasionally to compare that half-cursive handwriting to his own messy scrawl. He wonders what it would take to get his own handwriting to be considered “neat” and “pretty,” and decides quickly enough that it’s impossible.
But Harry only told him to try harder. Or be known as a Death Eater forever. And it had hurt. It’d hurt so much. Thinking about it now, it hurts the same all over again, and Draco’s choking back tears. He’s liked Harry for so long now, he doesn’t remember how it feels to not like him. But by the time he’d realized, it’d been to late to change their relationship. Misfortune after coincidence after fate; time and time again; and there was nothing Draco could do
When neither makes a move to start conversation, Harry starts to think that maybe all Malfoy and him will ever have between them is awkward silence. And while awkward silence is something Harry’s familiar and definitely comfortable with, he finds the idea here suffocating and unbearable.
But now, Draco continues to look at Harry. And whatever the doe finds in him, it must be good, because Harry can actually feel the bright tidbits of satisfaction and… and comfort.
“You can’t actually get rid of Dementors,” Eleven says. The woman rubs her temples. “You can only isolate them away from people and hope they disappear by themselves eventually. We have some of them kept in our department.”
have done. Should have been able to. He wishes he could. And it’s not exactly the frustration he would usually have felt at such a thought. He’s… sad. And tired. That’s it.
But there’s no time for envy in this place. The Dementors suck away any other feeling soon enough, and the guards have taken to using him for entertainment. They beat him and laugh at his pain, and there’s not a moment that he isn’t bleeding somewhere or another. They take up a sick game of pretending to rape him; never going all the way but enough so that Draco’s in pain and terrified and the Dementors surround them to revel in the blend of emotions.
Harry stuffs his face back into the blankets. He feels like crying. It’s frustrating. Communicating has never been this hard. But then again, Harry has never had to try very hard. People have always come to him. But for once, he’s trying to reach out to someone and he’s faced with rejection after rejection. He can’t understand. It’s hard. It’s frustrating.
Harry isn't really too surprised to find out Malfoy is friends with Luna; they are two of a kind he supposes, he could see it. But finding out that Malfoy had told Luna where he lives, and even moved into the same small town… well that was a bit more shocking.
Harry is not proud to admit that Ron has to drag him out of St. Mungo’s before he can blow up the hallway. The idea that anyone would block
For a moment, Harry is in shock. Then he snaps right back at the presumptive woman. “That’s a lame ass excuse and you know it. Just shut it until your fucking administration actually starts caring about your patients’ privacy.” Ignoring her indignant sputtering, he storms into the lifts and follows his memory to where Malfoy’s room is.
It’s Harry’s turn to pause. Is she friends with Malfoy? “Are… you friends with him?” he asks tentatively.
“Wait, hold on.” Harry runs back to Draco’s room and grabs the alphabet paper before heading back out again.
Now to find out that all along, Malfoy has been hiding away in some small rural town—probably having fun frolicking among the plants and trees with Luna—Harry can not and will not get over it. And indeed, he is still fuming two days later when a file lands on his desk regarding a sudden attack in the otherwise peaceful Grasmere.
There’s a prolonged pause as Malfoy looks Harry up and down. Suddenly self-conscious, Harry regrets rushing out of Ron and Hermione’s house right after breakfast. He knows his hair is still a mess—a birdnest, as Ron calls it—and he’s still wearing the t-shirt and sweatpants he wore to sleep. At least he also has the hoodie Hermione had thrown at him as he left. He will have to thank her later.
Luna simply continues through the small garden, but Harry pauses at the front gate, feeling like he really shouldn’t be intruding on someone’s property. Especially when said property belongs to an ex-rival who isn’t even there to defend his place against the likes of Harry.
Ron laughs then. “Me! I wouldn’t be your best friend otherwise.” He swings an arm around Harry and pulls him forward. “Now, let’s go!”
gotten the fuck out. His instincts knew if he didn’t, Malfoy would have cursed him straight out of town. It was a good thing too, perhaps. An hour later, buried back under his covers at Ron and Hermione’s house, he knows he was in the wrong. Even if he was angry, he shouldn’t have grabbed Malfoy. Shouldn’t have flaunted Malfoy’s own mark in front of him. Something so evil. Something that was supposed to be in the past. He wallows in his guilt.
Harry gives out a low whistle as he stares at what was once a quaint cottage, not unlike Luna’s. Except now, all the windows and doors are shattered and half the roof is gone from presumably an explosion of some sort. He casts a few charms, just to make sure the building wouldn’t be in any danger of collapsing should he enter. Satisfied, he turns back.
He doesn’t know how long he’s been existing in this dark plane of existence before he feels a blindfold being ripped off his face. His head is whipped to side at the force of it, and with another realization, he accepts that these are cruel people. That, or they just hate him.
“The more top secret subdivision of the Auror Department,” Owen says pleasantly. “Applicants must be referred.”
He hopes that her plants haven’t died. He can’t bear the idea of Luna coming home to find that her beloved work and pets have withered. He doesn’t want her last impression to be of a Draco who can’t even keep a simple promise. He hopes she knows he tried. He hopes she knows he’s sorry. For everything. Truly.
“And I sort of found your notebook? And I flipped through it—I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have, I get that it’s an invasion of privacy—and I sort of took the liberty to help you fix your roof because it
“Luna, Luna I just—I went to St. Mungo’s and the fucking receptionist was being a total dick and going on about privacy, as if they actually care. I mean how many times have I been there and they leak all my injuries to the press, and anyways Malfoy isn’t there, so do you know where he is because I need—I mean I don’t really but—I mean I just—”
“Really?” Ron squishes himself between back in. “You sure? Are you absolutely—fucking merlin’s balls—seriously sure?”
He almost falls asleep again when the cold tingle moves. Then there’s a cool drizzle on his face, and Harry startles awake. Silver eyes stare down.
He staggers back to the chair and slumps down in it. It’s a rickety old thing, made of wood and probably on the verge of collapse. A fitting throne for the damned. How fate must be laughing at him.
He feels regret, and he wants to feel remorse; there’s pain, and there’s a wish. And he wishes to understand. Because to understand is to sympathize, and to sympathize is to feel remorse, and to feel remorse is to repent. He wants to repent.
But just as Harry drinks the last dregs of his tea, Luna declares her cookies cool enough and goes to grab her cloak. Harry stands, thinking she’s about to leave on some business and he really can’t be intruding, despite all his unanswered questions.
Malfoy unfreezes and gives a jerky nod in acknowledgement. Then with a small swirl of mist, he disappears. Harry sighs. He feels like he’ll be sighing a lot. But hopefully Malfoy returns later. They were finally starting to get along so well.
He ends up bumping right into that desk outside. He really ought to move it out of the hallway, he muses. So gathering his strength, he shoves it back into the room, the table legs making an ungodly screech against the floor that has his teeth chattering and skin trembling. Then he curses himself because why hadn’t he thought to just levitate the damn thing? So he levitates the chair over instead and unceremoniously dumps himself in it.
“Radolphus? He’s the prick who tried to shut down our Department years ago. He has yet to be forgiven,” the head Unspeakable seeths. Eleven and Thirty-nine nod along solemnly.
He glances frantically away from Baker, and for a second, he thinks he sees Harry standing next to him. It’s just a glimpse, but Harry’s there, and he’s glaring and he’s mad and it’s almost like he’s challenging Draco. Challenging him to do wrong. To be a disappointment. Draco shudders, and against his will, a few tears leak out of his eyes. He’s hyperventilating now, and he gasps, even as he cries harder. There’s no way to express his fear, and it’s so so scary.
“I’m the Chosen One! The one person that the whole fucking world relies on to save its ass every time something goes wrong!”
The room Draco’s in is dark and damp, and it’s impossible to tell time. His government-issued wand has obviously been taken away, so he can’t even check. He could’ve been there for a month already and he wouldn’t know. Three days? In a place where the neither sun nor moon shines? There is no time.
With his own mug in hand, Ron sits down across from him, and for a moment, there’s no sound except for the quiet sipping and muffled noise from the store below.
Finally, they stop in front of what Harry immediately recognizes to be Malfoy’s house. Or rather, Malfoy’s half-wrecked mess of a cottage. The burns are still there and many of the windows have yet to be fixed, but the hole in the roof seems to have shrunk.
, eyes snapping open. He regrets it immediately. There’s maybe five or so Dementors surrounding him, regarding him with that black void where their head is. Where their
But not for long, because it seems as if not a second later, he’s waking up to sporadic tremors of shivers not unlike passing through a ghost. When he opens his eyes, it’s to the disorienting view of a silver otter swimming around and through him.
Robards groans and drags his hands slowly down his face. “Ugh, what am I going to do with you? Why did you ask people? This is a top-secret case!”
He’s gone back to his place on the roof soon enough after Luna’s left. It’d been a miracle that Harry had even managed to get a cup of Billywig sting tea without burning the house down. As soon as he had upended the package into his cup, the thing had smoked and sprayed him in a shower of sparks, prompting him to dive under the table. But he couldn’t deny his relief when he felt the haze lift from his mind.
He wishes Malfoy was still there at Luna’s cottage. There with his pools of grey and golden sunlight, with the sounds of clinking porcelain and quietly asked questions that upend his soul. Because Harry’s ignorance doesn’t balance Malfoy getting abducted, and now he may never get to apologize and ask his own questions.
“Ah they should be ready now.” She stands, dusting herself off before carefully floating the cookies out of the oven and onto a plate to cool.
Hihihihi! Ahaha what's up people! School's almost out oh god I'm so excited. I've been super stressed this past month or so due to homework and ap exams and oh god. Anyways I'll be off to college in the fall and meanwhile I'm gonna hella chill this summer and just draw and write so hopefully we'll see more chapters soon lol. In the meantime, I hope you enjoyed this chapter!
“No, just,” Harry huffs, “you, you’re running away! The world’s a mess and you just disappear and instead you’re here prancing among the flowers—”
The hole in the roof slowly inches itself shut, and as the sun starts to cast long shadows over his work, Harry gives himself a moment to sit back and admire his work—even if he’s still agonizing over Luna’s words. He doesn’t understand. He really, truly, and clearly does not understand what Luna meant. He’s racking his brains, and some sense of self-preservation leftover from the war keeps him on his toes. One misstep and Luna will have his head. One mistake and maybe he’ll ruin this thing with Malfoy. One small error in judgement and maybe Harry should have just kept to himself and not messed with someone else’s business.
Nonetheless, everything is what one might expect from an attack such as this one, so when Harry walks through the last doorway upstairs where the house now opens to the empty sky, he isn’t expecting the crumpled form of a body on the floor. And suddenly, fuck, because how had he not noticed the victim’s magical signature? There is a person, a human, possibly dying, and he—
Draco isn’t there, or at least Harry doesn’t know if Draco is there or not, and while he’s not sure, he’ll keep apologizing until he’s heard. And in the meantime, he keeps his head bowed towards Draco’s body, not daring to hold those pliant fingers in his own. He apologizes for taking apart something precious. He apologizes for the intrusion. He apologizes for being selfish and tainting Draco’s home in the hopes of making his own. He’s sorry. He’s so sorry.
Draco panics, and Harry startles at the intensity of the emotion he can almost feel palpitating off the patronus.
At every turn and reception, Thirty-nine flashes his Unspeakable badge, and Harry follows suit with his Aurora one. They make small talk as they walk: how old Thirty-nine was when he joined the Unspeakables, Hogwarts, Auror work. But not once does Thirty-nine elaborate on what the Unspeakables do, and Harry knows not to press. It’s enough that he’s been allowed to join the case.
When Harry doesn’t elaborate, the fox sniffs delicately and settles down, attempting to dig into the bed sheets that aren’t actually moving.
But her movement draws eyes, and as the two-and-a-half faces in the fireplace turn to look at her, Harry catches the moment they see the doe.
Harry starts to nod, before deciding against it. He clears his throat instead. “Ah, yes please,” he mumbles out, not wanting to stay silent the whole time.
The three of them return to Draco’s close to midnight, and the only one not tired is the fox. Yet when Luna pulls out two bottles of firewhiskey, Harry can’t refuse. He takes the bottle and settles himself on the ridiculously fluffy rug in the sitting room, leaning his back against a bookshelf. Draco floats over to plop himself onto Harry’s lap, and Harry hovers his hands over the foggy form.
And he laughs. He laughs and laughs until there’s tears at the edge of his eyes, and he wonders why he’s laughing so hard. But this is Malfoy, and of course Malfoy would do extensive research on architecture and construction just to fix his house. No one in their right minds would go to such lengths, and yet, here’s Malfoy doing just that.
He skirts along the edges of the rooms and hallways, but he’s sure that the people he passes all stare, because, well one, he
And he cuts off because the blonde hair waving in front of his face is short and grey eyes are staring curiously at him, and—that’s not Luna.
Luna turns around at the door and waits just long enough for Harry to catch up before unlocking and entering the small cottage. To some relief, the inside of the house has mostly been emptied or cleaned up, with just a few spare pieces of furniture here and there. Harry looks around curiously, before following Luna into what appears to be the kitchen.
It’s with trepidation that he enters Draco’s room that day. He’s not excited for another day of apologies and crying per se, but it’s something that must be done, and Harry really would like to fix this thing with Draco. But yesterday had done nothing, and the idea of starting over is crushing yet sobering.
Harry is fuming when he first sees Malfoy for the first time in three years. Or more specifically, he's in the middle of a one-sided shouting match with Robards in the Ministry lobby when Malfoy appears in a burst of green flames.
And with this bulk of information, Harry also finds that Draco is a large ball of jumbled emotions. When Draco “speaks,” the ideas and words planting themselves in Harry’s mind, they drag along other pieces of Draco’s concept. Harry feels the little bits of emotions behind the words, and they paint a brighter picture than anything Harry’s ever seen. And when the little bits of joy and curiosity deposit other emotions—darker bits, ones that paint the world grey—he understands that Draco’s not all that fine. Not as free as his patronus would seem. But it’s temporary, he promises himself. It’s temporary. He’ll be with Draco until the greys fade away and the world is once again, bright and colorful.
Harry nods. Slumping down next to Malfoy to wait it out, he lets his emotions simmer, feeling the pent up anger turn into a sad, sad resignation.
“No,” Hermione sighs. “They all had masks and illusion charms. The aurors won’t release any information either. Everything’s just a huge mess right now.”
Baker stops pacing to crouch in front of Draco. “We’re going to overthrow the Ministry, Malfoy. And you will either help us or die.”
Harry startles a bit. Robards and Owen watch them, waiting. “He says he woke up in the dungeons of a manor. Or at least he thinks it’s a manor because it was similar in structure to the Malfoy Manor.”
He doesn’t want to go back to that. Back to that dread and suffering. It was suffocating. He’d finally built himself a life, a home, and for a while, it’d been his own corner of bliss. But of course, nothing gold can stay.
And Harry thinks, oh right, because in some ways, he and Ron are one and the same. Except Ron prefers to stare at his jars of tea instead of newspapers. And Harry’s the one with the insane mood swings.
He’s still having his existential crisis when he feels something cool and misty brush his arm. He looks up, just in time to catch the fox flick away from him towards the other side of the bed. Mal—
They share a small grin. Ron stretches and stands up abruptly. He offers Harry a hand. Harry just looks back at him with slight confusion.
And there. That sentence. That was more than Harry could handle because it was just a bit too close. It was more than acquaintances, more than he had asked for, more than he had decided on. Because he did not need to know that Malfoy was attached to Grasmere and all the implications that came with it. He did not need to know that perhaps Malfoy loved the lack of civilization and the sea of green and the vast expanse of sky. And he most certainly did not need more things to mess up the meticulous order of his life.
Harry gets through the entirety of one book before his stomach rumbles. He looks up blankly at the sky, and to his disappointment, it’s still raining. It doesn’t hit him that that’s actually a problem though, before his stomach rumbles again. And now he
“Oh, hello Harry! Are the nargles bothering you again? Come in and I’ll get you something to help with that.”
It would be easiest to simply talk it out with Draco, to sit down and have a proper heart-to-heart instead of the shallow topics they’ve covered so far. It’s simple and it makes sense, and Harry sees no reason to not try it. So he visits and calls out to Draco from morning to evening, and days turn into nights, and it’s just him and Draco’s healing body.
Ron finds him some time later, and shakes him gently until he rouses. He blinks blurry eyes up at his friend.
He hears nothing all morning and into the early afternoon, so he takes Victor along on some minor cases to a local park, then someone’s house, and then a muggle museum where a niffler had gone loose. But he’s distracted the entire time, so he lets Victor take the lead. Excuses aside, he tells himself it’s good experience for the lad.
Sleep’s almost won when the coolness shifts and turns. Harry hums and cracks an eye down at the fox. Large silver eyes look up at him.
Draco looks up at him then and flicks his tail in something like a wag. And as Harry smiles sheepishly, there’s the burst of mist and vague swirls before the fox is back again like nothing happened.
Harry wakes up enough to see the doe prancing circles around his sofa. Then he stops to nose at a letter on the ground.
“Maybe you left too quickly last time, mate,” Ron adds after a moment. “Give it a chance this time, yeah?”
So perhaps he’s been projecting. Maybe he thought that Draco was the same. If he doesn’t want to talk about it, he doesn’t want to talk about it. But he’s never even asked about that, has he?
Harry turns wide eyes back to the other seven people. “Not our real appearances either, so rest assured,” Owen says with another calm smile.
Draco stumbles back. Shit. Shit shit shit. He’s lived this long, struggled this long, bore through the pain and the humiliation and the risks and he’s going to die after all. No, that’s not quite right. He won’t die. Dying is for souls. He’ll have his soul sucked out and eaten. He’ll probably just… disappear.
Harry pauses and stares at his paper. He grimaces. That’s not quite right. He snatches the alphabet paper back from Malfoy, startling him, and quickly scrawls a “space” underneath the letters. Then as an afterthought, he adds some punctuation on the side. He hands the paper back.
Harry gapes and splutters. “But y-you always asked me about the plants. And I asked.” With wide eyes, he takes in Luna’s serene smile and Draco’s pokerface. Except the corner of the fox’s mouth is tilting up and the tail is wagging.
“Well,” Thirty-nine stands and stretches. “I need to get back to the Ministry. You can stay for as long as the healers allow. If you find anything, shoot me a message.”
But Harry himself found that he hadn’t and doesn’t particularly like telling other people his feelings. It’s annoying and frustrating, and when people don’t understand, it makes him all the more upset. They don’t understand what he’s been through, all the little events that led up to the explosive anger he has today. And explaining it over and over is tiresome, burdensome, and he just wishes they could just…
in that regard at least. He hadn’t run away, hadn’t destroyed anything important except this thing with Malfoy, and he hadn’t said anything else that would be cause for further regret. But it wasn’t enough. It’s still not enough.
He spends seventh year haunting the halls of Hogwarts, watching the fruits of his labor blossom and spread its poison. And he lies to save Harry, Hermione, and Ron, and he panics even as flames threaten to catch him in the very same room where it all started.
“Hold on, hold on, you’re saying the resistance wants to get rid of the purebloods?” He hears gasps.
A new wave of irritation hits him all over again, and Harry storms back towards where the floo are located. The surrounding wizards—all on their way to work, Harry seethes—part around him, giving him a wide berth. They can no doubt sense the magic that pulses palpably in the air around him. Trying just the barest amount to reign it all in and smooth his face, he spins away with a sickening whirl.
All of a sudden, the cups on the table shatter, spilling tea across the table and dripping onto the floor. Malfoy flinches back, looking with horror from Harry to the shattered remains.
He throws himself back into auror work—earnestly this time, he tells himself. No more excuses, no more Malfoy-distractions. He does his job and guides Victor through tough cases, attends meetings, and has lunch with his co-workers. It’s normal and orderly, and every bit of the calm he had wanted after the war. That’s right, had.
Harry’s honestly a little hurt by the whole thing. He knows he probably shouldn’t be taking this personally, but he’s really trying right now, and it’s a bit frustrating when that sentiment isn’t being shared.
“Quiet?” Harry crosses his legs on the ground and moves the paper on top of a box so that it acts like a table.
By late evening, they’ve finished unloading all the boxes, and the house is rather starting to take on a cozy air. Despite the relative lack of furniture, the items Draco did have were personalized and varied. At eight, Luna magically—literally and figuratively—shows up as soon as Harry’s rolled out the last rug in the sitting area, and despite Harry’s weak protests, drags him off with promises of food and treacle tart.
He thinks back instead. Back to their last actual conversation. Back to when Malfoy was still conscious and in full capacity of his body and didn’t run away, even in the face of Harry’s animosity. But now, Malfoy simply flits away as he pleases and it annoys Harry to no end. Yet perhaps, Malfoy lost a bit more that week than just his body.
“That works. Anyways would you like some lunch? We really should eat before the sprites get to it. I brought some cookies too.”
But he turns and suddenly there’s a wall full of vials. All of them containing that shimmering silver liquid he recognizes to be memories. And all of a sudden Harry’s a bit creeped out. Because while it’s totally normal and common for people to have a brewery in their house, and less common yet still totally socially acceptable to have a professional brewery, it’s
“Harry? Oh, I was wondering when you’d show up. C’mon in. Tea?” She turns around and walks back towards her kitchen.
Ron takes in the inside of the house just like the outside. With a calm gaze and curious eyes, Harry can practically see his mind spin as he catalogues everything. In the end, Ron doesn’t say anything. He simply trails along as Harry wanders the interior, following whatever catches his eyes.
But Harry understands he thinks. Just a little. That want to have the pristine peace and calm back. That want to fix what was already perfect. He wants it back.
“Yes sir.” Harry turns to leave, then pauses. “Wait, why didn’t you give me the Malfoy case this time? You know I had to deal with him last time, and I really
A bit drunk now, Ron scooches back to Hermione, swinging an arm around her shoulder and squeezing her close. “So, got any insight, ’mione? Help these poor souls decipher Luna’s message?”
Kreacher's understandably slow to warm up to the fox after that, but when Harry finally tells him who the fox really is, having decided that Kreacher is trustworthy enough and deserves to know, the elf becomes the epitome of awe and admiration.
Harry soon realizes that Draco's not so much dozing out of necessity but simply because he wants to and he can. And it's not so much dozing but resting and getting some quiet shut-eye. Harry respects it either way. So whenever the fox curls up on the bed, Harry takes the cue to stop talking and perhaps take a nap for an hour or so himself. And as he feels his eyes drift shut, he watches, without fail, as the fox slowly fades into that vague blob of mist.
Ron decides for him that it’s impossible to get a straight answer out of Luna, ever. Having been comforted out of his mood, they drink to that. All the while, Hermione sits on the other side of their pile of food, watching with a knowing and exasperated smile.
Then he sees the flash of silver from his peripheral, and the fox is there, sitting on the bed staring up at him. Harry holds his breath. But still, the fox sits and stares, and when it finally lets out a silent huff, Harry gets it.
When lunch rolls around, Harry leaves for the small cafeteria on the ground floor of the building. He eats his food carelessly, not noticing what he’s putting into his mouth, and when he’s done, he steps outside for some air. He’s frustrated. He’s frustrated and sad and glad and angry, and he can’t go back quite yet because he knows it’ll show. And it can’t show because Malfoy’s a delicate creature now and Harry refuses to yell and say things he knows he’ll regret later. So he stays outside.
When Harry knocks on Luna’s door, he’s greeted once again by short blonde hair and grey eyes. He’s considered this situation in his head about a hundred times before actually knocking, of course, yet he still can’t prevent the slight flinch that tremors through his body.
“I see.” No wonder his forehead hurt so much. The corner must’ve caught him. He leans down and tears the letter open.
“These are just trial cookies,” she says, and Harry opens his mouth to say something but is almost immediately cut off. “I’m sure they’re quite safe though, so please try them. You did agree to be my test subject and I’m holding you to your word.”
“Alright then, see ya later. Be on the lookout, yeah? If you see anyone suspicious, get outa there. Bye!”
It’s an evening spent well, Harry eventually concludes. He doesn’t think he’s ever dined out with Luna like this, ever, and Draco simply dozes in the hood of his jacket the entire time, faded and small. It’s different from dining with Hermione and Ron, and Harry thinks it’s an interesting contrast that would be interesting to observe if melded together. Perhaps it’s because he’s known Luna for a shorter period of time. Maybe he’s not as close with her? But when Luna laughs loud enough that the other patrons of the restaurant turn to stare, he guesses it’s just because Luna is free in the way that others can’t restrain. And being with her rubs it off on him, so in a place where no one knows him, or Luna, or Draco, he also laughs.
dead all messed up like this. Yet the white-blond hair waves gently in the breeze, and wrapped up in bandages and blankets like this, Harry thinks Malfoy rather fits. He fits in this place that’s like Heaven on Earth.
Hermione come by around dinnertime to check on him and he’s glad for the distraction. They find him still on the roof—even if the sun’s set and he can’t see shit—and he’s curled into a ball with his chin on his knees, panicking and angry because he just can’t grasp the understanding right in front of his reach, waving its tail feathers in his face. Would it have hurt for Luna to just be a bit more clear? A bit less cryptic for once?
—that if everyone doesn’t work together, nothing will ever get fixed, and he’ll be left alone to deal with the aftermath and he simply
“Hello, Harry,” Ron’s voice suddenly cuts in, and Harry turns from the coffee machine to look at the dog that’s appeared next to the otter.
Luna kneels besides him with her notepad as he lies facedown from where she had dragged him away from certain death. “Yes yes,” she says soothingly. “You’ll get it.”
certain that normal houses would have blocked the rain. But there’s this fucking hole in Malfoy’s roof and it isn’t blocking shit. And then oh god there’s water in the house and the house is going to flood and then the floorboards are going to rot and Malfoy’s going to return and find that his house has become a pile of dirt and compost.
Harry grins and follows her into the kitchen. “No, I’m fine. I just came to see if you had some time to kill.”
doesn’t fit. There are clashing memories and the familiarity that only comes with years of being together, and everything keeps overflowing into his other shelves and boxes and It. Doesn’t. Fit.
Draco thinks back to all the times he’d acted arrogant and a bully. Just to keep himself safe, away from the Dark Lord’s suspicion and the possible rejection of his friends. Was it worth it? Was it worth it, keeping himself alive at the cost of his love? Once upon a time, he would have answered, yes, it was worth it. Anything to keep himself alive. But the war’s over, now that he thinks about it properly, and what’s stopping him?
Luna doesn’t speak, simply sets the things down and absorbs herself in her cup. When the silence continues, however, Harry starts to suspect that perhaps Luna is waiting for them to start the conversation themselves. But he refuses to be the one to do so, so he sits and wallows in his growing stress.
Bored, he then starts opening and closing all the drawers on the desk, looking for things of interest. When he finally comes across a small notebook, Harry pauses and considers the fact that perhaps he’s violating some sense of privacy here. He stares at the notebook in his hands and wars it over in his head. He really doesn’t want to snoop, but after all the other empty drawers he’s come across, he really wants to know why there’s just a notebook left in the desk. So eventually he tells himself he’s just going to flip to the very first page. And if it’s something private, he’ll put it back and never touch it again.
So when Luna comes knocking at the gate around noon, Harry pokes his head over the edge of the roof and waves down at her.
Harry fucked up. He fucked up big time, and it’s one of those times where Harry knows that he’s in the wrong. But as for
“Mr. Malfoy?” Owen asks his greeting, and when Draco nods, the man raises an eyebrow. “Might want to report that to the Unspeakables.”
“No buts.” Robards folds his hands neatly and looks Harry straight in the eyes. Harry instinctively stands up straighter. “I’ve also been informed that you may have a certain history with Malfoy, and with all consideration, it may interfere with the investigation.”
The two act like children, like teenagers, and although they’re all only in their early twenties—still young—Harry feels old. It seems like lifetimes have passed between his childhood and now. A whole war happened, seven years crammed full of action and fear, and never for a moment has there been a break. And all these events only seem to elongate the time in between so that Harry could wake up forty tomorrow and he wouldn’t be surprised. He feels forty.
running away, much less prancing through flowers!” Malfoy snaps. His calm demeanor breaks, and for a moment, there’s fury and frustration written in his eyes. He takes a breath. “I’m simply trying to live my life, Potter.”
With more range of motion now, he slowly explores the room. The floor and walls are all made of rough concrete, and as he trails his hands in the air, he finds that there is no other furniture either; just the chair. The only bit of light coming into the room seems to be from the tiny window in the door, and when Draco jumps to try to look out of it, all he sees is an opposing wall a few feet away.
responsible for what the Death Eaters did? For what Voldemort did?” He laughs, a harsh sound that grates against Harry’s ears. “How laughable. Go ahead, blame me. Blame me for the thousands of deaths and whatever wrongdoings happened. Push them all onto me would you? After all, the rest of them are dead or in Azkaban!”
, and it was only after joining the aurors that he realized the extent of its reach. Heck, there are still branches of the government he hasn’t discovered yet. Besides, why would someone want to overthrow the Ministry? It wasn’t the perfect system, but there have been pushes for reform, led by none other than Hermione. And reform has never been a quick overnight thing.
“I honestly don’t know what you think of me. Are you mad at me still? If so, I’m sorry for last time.”
Luna greets him with a dazzling smile when he shows up at her cottage twenty minutes later with a bag of pastries.
He looks back at Malfoy again, but this time with the intent of work. He scans the body, and he’s confused because what does an ejected soul look like? He was told it was a patronus? There are no patronuses.
“Good.” Then Robards addresses the group as a whole. “We’ll catch Harry up to speed real quick, then continue with the meeting as planned. Any objections?”
Luna stands and looks around for a while, then looks at Harry. She doesn’t say anything and it unnerves him, because he really thinks she’s somehow found a way to look through his soul and into the depths of his regret.
He freezes. He lets himself still and continues his slow breathing, and until Draco notices that he’s awake, he simply watches the fox play with his hair. It takes a few minutes, but eventually, the fox stops nosing at his mess to curl up on Harry’s chest and stare. Harry stares back.
“Damn,” he finally says, still pulling air into his lungs with a desperation that’s almost entertaining. “How can you even apparate that far? How are you not—”
Draco gives an eye roll and shakes himself out before resettling. Harry huffs out a laugh in response and thumps his head back. He stares at the ceiling.
He secures the last shingle down and steps back to survey his work. He feels that new yet welcoming feeling of satisfaction well up within him, and he almost shouts in joy. But with much of the wards down due to the destruction of the house, he stops himself. It wouldn’t be good for the muggles to accidentally stumble onto the premises due to this whim.
Thirty-nine speaks again, and Harry’s finally roused from his trance. “Mr. Malfoy? Are you there?” There’s a slight panic to his voice now, and Harry’s brain restarts.
It takes Harry a good chunk of the day to gather himself and find the will to go face Luna. He’s not sure as to why he’s nervous. It’s not like he’s the one that kidnapped Malfoy. Maybe it’s just the fact that he had upset Malfoy to the point of tears. Maybe Malfoy told Luna how much of a dick he was. Or maybe it’s because you understand how stupid you were and regret it now, his brain whispers. Shut up, he says back.
WARNING: There are a few sensitive topics later in this chapter, but there's nothing graphic I think so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
When the tears have finally stopped, he looks up, straight ahead. Imaginary-Harry’s still beside him, arms wrapped around his neck, and Draco refuses to turn to look. Refuses to look at the empty space that’s actually there.
he did wrong, well, Luna won’t tell him and Hermione won’t tell him, so he’s left to figure it out for himself.
The dog disappears in a wisp of silver smoke, and Harry just stands there. When he finally turns back to walk up the stairs, the otter is gone too. Alone again. Alone again with his thoughts.
Baker yanks his chain upward again so that Draco’s on the same level as Baker. “What are you crying for?” he hisses. “Some coward you are. Don’t know why we need someone like you with us.”
Harry gets the image of a frown and a vague sense of dissatisfaction. Then a spark of amusement as he feels Draco settle on a crude picture of the man.
Ron takes his lack of answer in stride and simply sits down besides Harry. After a moment, he reaches for an article and helps smooth it out, before gently setting it back down. They go through most of the crumpled pieces of paper before Ron opts to speak.
Logically, he knows it’s not a big deal. Really, truely. If he won’t believe himself, at least he’ll believe the therapist Hermione tried so hard for him to get. He was fine just a moment ago, but now he’s not, and Harry can’t control it, can’t control it. But he can’t help it because it’s stupid, the world is stupid, and he really really needs something to hold on to so his hands will stop their godamn shaking.
trying so of course it’s all fine! There are people out there! People hurt by the war! By Death Eaters! By
The healer smiles at him and passes him a calming draught. Harry downs it, and slowly relaxes as the potion works its magic. He watches the healer go back to her work, waving more spells into place and getting Malfoy to drink an assortment of potions.
There’s a scrape of chairs as they both stand. “Yeah yeah, of course,” Harry nods. “Whiny customers and all that.” They share a smirk. “Anyways,” Harry continues, “I should probably get going too.”
to stay awake. So he dances with sleep and fights his eyes open every time he realizes they’re drooping. It’s a warm night. Warm with the cool drops of mist that is Draco and the night breeze that comes with Luna’s lilting voice.
And then he’s spilling his guts out and laughing and crying at the same time and at one point he almost rolls off the roof from laughing too hard.
of calm and grace. Harry lets his eyes roam, taking in the figure slumped down in his oversized hoodie, hair ungelled with strands caught floating in the air. The grey eyes, once piercing, are now quiet like the rest of their owner. They glance up, and Harry flinches, averting his gaze to watch as Luna carries over tea and biscuits.
He eventually falls asleep late in the afternoon, sprawled across the floor in an undignified heap. But he can’t care less. He’s tired, and just wants to sleep. To sleep until he’s not tired, and he doesn’t know how that works.
But Harry can’t help noticing that while the fading and disappearing has lessened, the spontaneous bursts into a giant cloud of mist has not. In fact, it seems to be happening more frequently, going from once every other day to one or more times a day. He worries. He worries and Draco catches his worry, and then it’s a chain of
He’s staring at a particularly grey patch of cloud and wondering how much time has passed when the first drop of rain hits him in the face. Then fuck, because it’s raining and he guesses he really shouldn’t have been lying out in the open in the first place anyways. But he keeps cursing, because he’s
But he knows his imagination and expectations don’t line up with reality, and when the more realistic Imaginary-Harry appears, Draco’s reminded of the impossibility of his wants. This Harry yells and screams at Draco, and he repeats
Thirty-nine sighs. “He’s been disappearing as soon as he sees any of us, so we can’t even have a proper conversation with him. We don’t even know if he understands us. And disappearing like that all the time is a problem for us, because we don’t have a way to tell if his soul is still there. For all we know, his soul could just disappear one day and we wouldn’t even know.”
But Luna’s now going through a pile of articles and doesn’t give any indication to what she’s just heard. Turning back, he’s relieved to find those grey eyes waiting and staring unfocused into Malfoy’s tea.
Sixth year comes with a bite and a jab, and Harry recalls that Draco got his Dark Mark then, so he puts himself once again in front of Voldemort, only this time as a supporter, as a scared child. He imagines his parents, alive and well, and he imagines their life on his shoulders. He crushes his own nose under his foot, struggles to fix the vanishing cabinet, smuggles in the necklace and the mead. And then he sees Harry, himself, pointing that wand in Myrtle’s bathroom, and he imagines his chest being ripped apart and bleeding on the floor with only Snape to heal him.
“Harry,” she says firmly, “you need a break from all this Malfoy stuff. He appears after three years and you’re suddenly wrapped all around him!”
Harry sniffles, wipes the rest of his tears away, and gives Hermione a tentative smile. “Thank you.”
Harry knows at this point that she’s not talking to him. But then she walks over to him and grabs his hand, pressing a small object into it. When Harry looks, it’s one of those old, antique-looking keys, with a surprising and solidly comfortable weight that puts him at ease.
But then Thirty-nine is walking forward to the hospital bed occupying most of the room, and Harry recalls what they’re here for.
Harry nods and waves, and when the man has finally pushed through the crowd to their table, he looks around.
“Well, certainly not. I was in the middle of writing an article about blibbering humdingers. But seeing as you’re my friend, I think I can squeeze in some time.” She sits down at the small table and gazes serenely up at him.
Harry realizes this, and suddenly he gets the feeling that something important is flying out of his reach. A floaty and itchy feeling wells up in his chest, and Harry knows he’s getting anxious. He fights to keeps his hands and feet from jittering, but there’s something wrong and it’s not right and he doesn’t know exactly what it is and how to fix it. He’s starting to flex his fingers when there’s a gentle hand on his shoulder.
But Harry thinks back on the argument with Malfoy and realizes that it isn’t enough. Maybe it’s enough for him, but it’s not enough for Malfoy. Never enough for Malfoy. Because it isn’t Harry and his friends against the world anymore. If anything, it’s Harry
His eyes follow Malfoy as he walks quickly and quietly, cloak wrapped tightly around him as he practically hugs the wall.
