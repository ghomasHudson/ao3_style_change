"Both," Draco said. His white trainee Healer robes should have looked ghastly with Draco's colouring, but he was handsome as ever.
There was only one thing to answer that. Harry moved slowly to allow Draco to complain, to turn his face away, to bolt and say something faintly ridiculous like ‘you’ve mistaken this entirely’ in that curt way he had.
“Mother...” Draco said.
The final time is different. They are, unsurprisingly, hit by a bonding curse. But this one can't be stabilized and doesn't require touch. What it does is link their thoughts.
“I’ve got a terrible headache,” Harry said. “Do you mind taking me home? I’m worried I’ll be sick in the Floo.”
“Don’t look suspicious,” Hermione murmured, swaying to the music.
“You’re the one who decided to come here in the middle of the night between a double shift for sex,” Harry pointed out. Draco pressed a kiss to his chest.
“It’s clearly a Dark object, but it wouldn’t naturally hold that much power,” Draco said, as if it was extremely obvious.
Draco paused for a long moment. He knew she would let the silence stretch until he ran out the entire hour. In the beginning, he had tried that twice. Almost as a trick, expecting her to chastise him for not taking part and wasting her time. But she sat there quietly with him. She knitted, she told him stories about hikes she’d been on and vacations she hoped to take and sometimes read a book. So he described one. Then another.
"They don't remember anything?"
“Ah, Hogwarts. The hours are long, but at least the pay is a pittance,” Kingsley teased.
The week was going relatively well until Friday. Then their hands both brush a forgotten orb filed in the 1860s that had dropped off the card catalogue. Harry is now familiar with the feeling of a bonding curse snapping into place. They are alone. When Harry fists his hands in Draco's robes to pull him close, they are
Draco really did not feel like he had the upper hand even in his own home with Greg here.
“Kingsley said Pansy’s pretty much done with the trade deal,” Hermione said.
No. Harry is mostly stung by the realization he had over-invested in Draco Malfoy to such an extent. He shrugs again. "You have every right to go looking for another partner. I imagine it would be uncomfortable to realize that your coworker harboured inappropriate thoughts about you."
Draco didn’t let Harry look around to figure out what kind of flat they lived in together. Draco dragged him up the stairs and kissed him. Harry gave in to the feeling. After an evening like this one, it was hard to even think about what he should do. He wouldn’t let it get too far, but Draco’s mouth against his jaw was a revelation. He tasted faintly of anise, lemon and beer.
“But if you were gay or bisexual or trans or anything at all, Gran and I would still love you the same,” Harry said softly. That was a conversation they would have to keep having, so he left it there. Teddy gave him a hug, the kind that came rarer now he was getting a bit older.
"I know the hours are long, but make sure you're resting," Harry said.
“Is there someone leading them?” Harry asked.
“If you would like to speak any time in the next year, my door is open to you. I’ve let most people know you are on special assignment,” Harry nodded, not trusting himself to speak.
Not because of Draco Malfoy. He barely knew him anymore, and Hermione was the one who worked with him directly. They saw each other when Harry was an Auror in Ministry hallways and greeted each other politely. In the last year, he might have seen Draco once, perhaps at a Ministry fundraiser for St Mungo’s or his orphanage or one of the dozen causes Harry gave money to since he had too much of it.
“You think that they were trying to find a way to take and receive wizard magic with Dark objects,” Athena said. Penny and Zacharias were pale as death. Kingsley looked very, very unhappy.
Draco watched him the whole time Harry turned the wing.
“No inane chatter for me, Potter? What’s the matter?” Draco continued.
“I have to be back at Hogwarts by August 15. Properly back. I don’t care what kind of wobbly time bullshit goes on,” Harry conceded.
Athena had actually managed to narrow down suspects to particular cells for the first time all investigation. They had a few familiar names as Harry looked at the chart she had pinned up on the living room wall. The chart was dazzling in black ink on parchment. Harry tapped a few sections with his wand and they zoomed in and out, rearranged to centre the name tapped.
It was just more convenient for Draco to have Harry than another date at these galas, even when it pissed off people they were dating. Harry knew what to say without prompting, he held his liquor well and he was charming. Donors loved him.
“I think the lager here gets worse every time I drink it,” Harry said, making a face. It was such a useless remark, meant to put Draco at ease. Draco smiled. It was brief but real.
Once in seventh year in a party at Room of Requirement. The gathering had been the kind of thing that was unofficially tolerated by professors. Something about cohort unity across houses. It was a tradition that was established after the Fall of Voldemort that had never gone away.
“Do you want me to cut it?” Harry asked.
"You bought me a priceless antique ring to tell me you like me back?" Draco's voice was flat, but his lips twitched at the corner.
Why did it sound like Kingsley was apologizing to him? Kingsley reached into his desk and handed him a card for a mind healer.
“You’re a brilliant researcher and you worked on this project for years. Why would you just throw it all away?”
Well, it was time to get to work.
“There should be more flowers,” Narcissa said.
“Going home soon?” Harry asked.
“I saw him last night,” Harry said. He was thinking about how Draco looked when he really threw his head back and laughed. He was thinking of the cool grey of his eyes when assessing something. He was thinking whether he’d ever see either again. Harry put his face in his hands.
"It's obscure magic, Auror Malfoy, but there are promising—"
Draco bites his lip hard and then clears his throat. “If I had come from that, I would have fucking killed you. And it was a close thing, let me tell you.” Draco’s voice is low and amused even as he’s affecting a complaint. Harry chooses not to answer, to put Draco on his back and slowly push one finger in his slow tight heat. Draco’s hips roll slowly.
“Harry.” The whisper came from Draco’s makeshift hospital bed in the study. Draco was sitting up with a book and a small ball of light that he was reading by.
All at once, all the spells were released and Draco lay on the floor breathing hard. All this to remake the world.
When Draco finally moved away, Harry pulled him down for one more kiss before letting him stumble backwards.
“There was something strange about Greg’s visit though. He made it sound like he was planning something big,” Draco said.
"I want you to come," Harry says. His brain can barely form the words in between thrusts. It takes a few minutes but with a loud cry Draco does, pulsing over both of their stomachs. Harry feels the tight squeeze of Draco around him. He can feel the pooling warmth of orgasm approaching. What tips him over the edge, embarrassingly enough, is Draco reaching up to kiss him on the mouth, shaky and tender. When Harry finishes, he rolls onto his back.
“That was nothing special. He...loved her was the problem. She understood. It was mostly crushing guilt and confusion,” Draco said. "He had never considered..."
"From here?" Harry tilted his head back. The sky was just starting to lighten around the edges of the halo of trees.
“I could take a break,” Harry said, and suddenly the focus of all that attention was on Draco.
The next morning he made it to the kitchen where owls had borne all the flower arrangements. Lilies, snapdragons, snapping hydrangeas, wildflowers. Gilding everywhere. With condolences, sorry for your loss, our sympathies. One basket stuck out. It looked forlorn in a black clay planter, more of a plant. Out of habit from intake rotation at St Mungo’s, he scanned it with his wand. An ordinary peace lily.
“What do they even want with him? They’ve been experimenting on muggleborns. He’s a pureblood!” Harry said. Harry was aware this shouldn’t be happening to anyone, but Draco was his...was his...
Harry was standing at the main Apparition point in Diagon. A small sticky note in his hand had an address off Knockturn Alley. Harry decided to make his way there. Imagine if all his other selves wrote things down. It would have made this much easier.
“What about here?”
“Pansy’s just being Pansy,” Theo said, kindly. “She hates the outdoors. And travelling.”
“Yes. Yes. Thank you, Gabe. See you Wednesday.”
“Have you eaten dinner?” Harry asked, bypassing Draco’s ability to derail even the simplest conversation.
Instead, he went to his cupboards and found a ready-made meal. Tibs, veg and potato. Hermione had taken care of that. Of course she had. The house must not have let her tidy up if it was still this dusty, though.
“They should but they won’t. And I won’t have a single one of these bastards off the hook because they said the investigation wasn’t thorough,” Harry said.
The longer he stood there the more he recognized that borrowed feeling wasn’t a general distaste for Malfoy as he might have imagined. It was longing. The ache in his chest wasn’t his own, but it didn’t lessen looking directly at Draco.
“For 48 hours,” Harry added. “I walked around Hogwarts looking like fucking Liberace for 48 hours.”
“You never knew when to shut up,” she remarked. He knew her voice. She was his year, Slytherin.
“It’s a test run,” Hermione promised. “We jump in, we jump out.”
“One last shot?” Fred asked everyone. Harry declined. He still felt a little off-centre.
“Let me, just let me...” Draco trails off. Instead of speaking, Draco unbuckles Harry’s belt, pushes his trousers down and pulls off Harry's shirt. Now they are both mostly unclothed.
“Not in the living room again,” Draco said. He’d missed healing a carpet burn last time and one of the other Trainees spotted it in the changeroom and snickered. Harry stood up holding Draco and turned to the stairs.
It was a nasty shock to see Marietta Edgecombe circled in yellow.
“You don’t think that,” Harry said.
“You alright?”
“They’re staring because I’m terribly good-looking. They want to know why I’d even be seen with the likes of you,” Draco whispered.
Let’s start at the beginning.
“You’ll be in Muggle London. We have secured you employment and a residence. You are required to check in once a week with an officer and twice a week with a counsellor. You are not permitted to use magic, carry a wand or visit any Wizarding establishment or community.”
“It was easier to remember when you were Head Auror,” Harry said.
“I can’t know for certain, but that kind of item...” Draco tapped a photo of a grandfather clock imbued with Dark magic that had been in the resource centre.
The witch who spoke at his information session was impatient and talked at a rapid clip while stamping pieces of paper and getting his signature, wand and fingerprints. His hand shook slightly, handing over his replacement wand from Switzerland.
“You may use the muggle post which connects to the public Owl network or a telephone. Your correspondence will be monitored. In an emergency, you’ll have a way to contact the Department. Your supervisor will be with you shortly.”
“Panse,” he called.
“What are you working on?” He’d asked one little girl. He tried to be kind when he could. She looked around five or six. Harry always went alone when there had been multiple visits; after the initial shock of an incident wore off more than one Auror in the home made people nervous.
“Theo likes art,” Pansy added, not at all helpfully.
"How did we get assigned to evidence archives? Isn't that why we have Ministry archivists?" Harry says, temporarily distracted from the truly remarkable depths of his one-sided crush by Draco's scowling.
“I can order for myself,” Harry grumbled.
They found Theodore Nott some months later. Harry didn’t understand the details at all because it was both way beyond his scholarly inclinations and above his security clearance.
He thought about it briefly as he reported back to the Ministry. She was learning her letters and the sounds they made. She would string them together. Someone would teach her. She would learn to read. She could grow up to be a hairdresser or a barrister. What a wonderful thing.
He saw Malfoy’s wand twitch slightly before he turned away from him, muttering under his breath. Probably for his sake, Draco waved his wand and drew up a model of the wall they were looking at, a ghostly imprint over the real thing. Another circular motion with his wand and about twenty runes appeared. Draco waited a few seconds before re-arranging them.
“Can we just kiss?” Draco said. He sounded nervous. “I would like to wait before anything else.”
. If they think anything, I’m dead and you’re dead. I feel as though I should fucking strangle you, does that answer your question?”
Somehow, he didn’t mind someone in his clothes as much when it was Draco. It made him look less remote, less inaccessible. Draco looked like something he could have, Harry thought. And he looked away. So this was one of those universes. Or maybe he could admit it was also him now.
“You’re here early. I need to finish another order before I can package yours.”
“She’s not very happy about the werewolf rights legislation. She was sending threats to the Minister a couple years ago. We had to threaten to charge her before she stopped. She’s been running with an interesting crowd since,” Zacharias said.
“Do you still want to go back?” Harry asked. He was afraid of the answer to this question.
“Yeah?” Harry said.
"I recruited her as a consultant with the Ministry."
“I don’t know you anymore, but I think I’d like to,” Harry says, feeling himself smile. They clink glasses.
“I’m thinking of inviting Charlie,” Sirius said. Harry looked to where Charlie was helping his mum set out desserts.
“Since when do you do what I want you to?” Harry says, dismissive.
“Did he gloat?” Melinda asked carefully.
It’s a cool, crisp autumn day in October, the kind with an underlying bite in the air that reminds him winter is almost here. He walked these same grounds in Wiltshire all his life. Now he sees long grass, yellow from neglect, stalks bending in the wind as far as the eye can see. All the places they used to grow potion ingredients have been left fallow. There were once neat rows. Now the only ordering principle seems to be the hawthorn roots choking out the rest. The garden is a disgrace, with blighted blood-red roses and more thorny bramble than greenery. He feels nothing surveying what time has done.
Harry was going to go out of his mind. How could there be no trace of Draco? How could he have been kidnapped out of St Mungo's? Was it his fault? It was, wasn’t it.
“Yes and no. He used a Time Turner too. But it’s not dangerous,” Draco reassured him. Harry shot him a disbelieving look.
“Healer...?” Harry said.
“Maybe she likes being an Unspeakable?” Kingsley snorted.
“Sorry Healer Cummins,” Draco murmured.
Harry made it back to Grimmauld before hopping back to his world. It was important, somehow, that they were close to each other in these worlds. That was the key difference in his world and there. Draco was something closer to a tertiary character in his life now.
“Of course. We’ll speak later. ”
“The magic will guide you. It has a proximity charm for Draco’s and will lead you where he’s been. He has calibrated his to go to particular places. Just follow and you’ll catch up,” Hermione explained patiently.
He nurtured a hope that he could get all five NEWTs to be a Healer. It seemed a useful job. One where people might respect him. Where he could fix a little of the harm he had put into the word.
So Harry walked.
“Arthur will figure it out one day and you’ll have your speakers,” Kingsley said.
"It's not like that. He's my friend. Like you're my friend," Harry said.
“You still want me?” Draco asks. He sounds unsure. Harry imagines he means right now and not forever. Sometimes, Harry thinks, you have to distinguish the fantasy from the real thing.
“Fuck,” Harry says. Draco scrabbles blindly, and as soon as his hand touches Harry’s arm, the pain subsides immediately.
“Shut up, I’m trying to sleep,” Draco responded.
"What are we doing?" Harry whispers. Draco shushes him, puts his fingers in Harry's mouth.
Pansy threw him a little party at Theo’s flat (where she practically lived) with champagne and a lemon vanilla tiered cake. Pansy told him Theo had got the flat because he was no longer welcome in Nott residence when his new stepfather was around.
Harry shouldn’t push as he’d already asked an incredibly personal question.
“No potions is not
“Mediwitch Janine Routh,” the other responded.
“Hi,” Harry said back, matching his smile. In this universe they must have some sort of friendship.
“Can you describe one, Draco?”
"Bonding curses vary widely, Auror Potter," Healer Smythe says.
“Malfoy. General Potter,” That was definitely Neville Longbottom. While he wasn’t sure about his mutton chops, there was a more pressing issue. How did Harry address him?
And if Harry still wants Draco when it is safe, he can have him.
Harry nodded again and raised his shirt. Draco pressed firmly on his abdomen and torso with the tips of his fingers. The warmth of his hands made him shiver but it was all very professional to his vague disappointment.
Harry was also trying to figure out how to rally his Quidditch team. Gryffindor seemed to have given up on winning a single match all year. They tried, and they tried hard, but they didn’t work well together. He found himself in the November rain setting them drills so they might bond over how hard they worked. Instead, they seemed more and more defeated.
“You don’t know that for certain so why assume it?” Melinda challenged. “If you have changed, why can’t he have changed?” Draco scoffed.
“I don’t know,” Draco said truthfully.
“My fee is a tenner for miracles, Potter.”
The burial was simple enough. According to his wishes, Lucius was placed in an unlined pine box in the family crypt on the edge of their estate. The symbolic pyre was lit with their wands touching. His mother leaned on him the whole time, clasping his arm for strength.
Harry wasn’t looking forward to it, as Ursula Tabachnick seemed to resent him for some perceived slight he’d never figured out. She had kept trying to shunt Harry from general duty to International Security Cooperation or Public Affairs.
Hermione had answered his note:
Lucius had been deemed too dangerous for visitors. They both sent inquiries through Narcissa. Something foundational had fractured in their relationship and Draco had refused to apologize for it. Maybe that was a mistake. He would never know now.
“Ma’am!” Draco calls. The woman—definitely a suspect now as she cradles three vials to her chest—startles and Apparates with a loud crack and before Draco can signal Harry to do the same, they both go crashing through the floor.
If either of them found this spontaneous display of affection strange they didn’t say anything. Pansy turned a little pink but allowed it. Theo hugged her back fully which surprised Draco. There had been bows, air kisses, pats on the shoulder and hands held but no real hugs all day. His mother wiped away the few tears that sprang to her eye.
“So much so that you’re having me teach you basic arithmancy,” Draco said. It wasn’t a question. “Wasn’t there someone else who did this before?”
At the moment someone sent him groceries, but his package said the Ministry expected him to shop with the bank card starting next month. Did the shop take the card and he would get another every time? He didn’t know. After burning food a few times, he alternated between pot noodle, spaghetti and salads for dinner.
“Decided that I needed a bit of help since the grandkids came along but I’m the only one who knows where everything is!” Eustace laughed loudly.
“I’m going as hard as I can,” Draco said, muscles straining.
“Winning,” their Beater said. The team laughed for the first time all practice.
. Sit still. What do you know about the Auror operation? Who is on it?”
“I’ll take care of your cottage,” Hermione said. “Everyone will think you’re in the Arctic backwoods hiking for the summer.”
Harry decided to stay through the entire party, talking to everyone. He had never been such an interested conversationalist. It wasn’t strictly necessary to figure out what was going on, but he listened, intent.
Harry disappeared from anywhere they might meet for the better part of a month. He excused himself from Cho and Padma’s hundred days party for their baby, left pub nights after ten minutes, put off shopping on Diagon.
He would pick up a glass of water and think about whether he had split the universe with such a tiny choice.
“I wasn’t as moral as you,” Draco said finally. He added his Firebird to the pile. It took Harry off-guard. He expected negotiations, pleas, and perhaps a hex.
“We can’t,” Harry whispered.
"I have to go to the clinic in the morning and I came from a shift." And then he kissed Harry so thoroughly he was certain that he was not dreaming and Draco was in fact, standing before him. Harry broke his gaze by taking a quick sip of water from his night stand.
“All I’m saying is that you and I slept together and it didn’t change anything,” Theo said.
They finish their work in silence after the curse dissipates, no doubt weakened by time. Harry wants to say something to Draco but he's not sure what he wants to happen. Should they pretend this never happened? This is so out of bounds for a work friendship that it's on Mars. On his last glance, Draco seems perfectly composed, so Harry ducks his head and keeps working.
“Hmmm, maybe Nev?” Harry said, with a slight bite of sarcasm.
Draco cleared his throat.
“Mrs. Malfoy? Auror Potter?” Mediwitch Routh called. They both stood up. “He’s awake for a bit before he needs to rest. He’s in stable condition. Dehydrated, magical core seems to have been slightly destabilized and depleted but he’s well on his way to healing. We can’t heal too much at once so he has some superficial cuts.”
Harry had fallen back into examining Draco closely like it was an old cloak. He tried to parse his motives more generously than he would have back then, but otherwise, he was quite literally following him around and trying to see what he was up to.
When he landed back at Grimmauld for the next world, the house was different. The wallpaper was light grey. The floors were shiny. Everything around him was sleek and modern, a mix of Muggle and Wizarding appliances. He walked up to the pantry doors and saw a photo of him and Ginny with three small children, all jumping in a puddle in matching yellow wellies.
"If you want."
Draco cast the sobering spell as more of an afterthought when they reached the lane but they kept walking.
“I wasn’t staring,” Harry said. Draco ruined the whole picture by speaking, Harry told himself.
"I should have known by the robes," Yannick said, still smiling. Draco was wearing black brocade but the underlayer was definitely a matching emerald green. It wasn't like he had done it consciously. But he liked the way they looked at the last one, Harry in midnight blue with gold stars, Draco in a matching gold just a shade away from gaudy. The picture was still on his dresser.
“Always like that with the war heroes. He’s seen so much,” a whisper came from behind.
“Is it the same as when...” Harry trailed off.
“Yes,” Draco agreed. But they both didn’t seem to be satisfied with this explanation after all the strangeness and magical anomalies they had seen.
“I know that. It’s just—” Draco said. Then he paused for a long moment. “The house is dated. But it’s nice. Good location.”
Harry had taken to these walks because Wizarding London sometimes felt too small. Being recognized always made him feel vaguely guilty, especially now. He knew he was not living up to whatever people expected of him. Last week, a witch had cornered him on his morning walk by Grimmauld to talk about the policies of the Second Reconstruction, and he hadn’t found a way to explain that he had not been following much of anything lately.
“We won’t...if you’re not sneaking Harry Potter out of your bedroom like a mistress in a brothel,” his mother said. Draco groaned. Harry had definitely left by now.
All day Luna had been plying her guests with cordials, shrubs, teas, and infusions. Harry could feel the residue all sticky on his lips, thick in the back of his throat, like he hadn’t finished swallowing.
He went to the bar, and there was Hermione. Her hair was loose here, and she wore a lacy bra and shorts that made Harry blush. She had taken a similar approach to glitter smeared liberally all over her face, cleavage and shoulders.
“That’s not yours, Teddy,” Harry said. Teddy giggled and curled up on the sofa.
Harry felt guilty about his irregular visits, but he pushed through his discomfort to ask Andromeda if he could come for lunch.
“No, I’m alright now,” Harry said.
“Harry,” Kingsley greeted warmly.
“He could destabilize the magic in several worlds until there’s no magic and we all die a painful death as the structure of reality collapses,” Kingsley said, deadpan.
“Yes, sir,” they said in chorus.
Draco led him through a few twisting hallways until they ended up in a dark room barely wide for them both. Harry cast a floating orb of light and it left them both in chiaroscuro, their shadows long and lean on the wall.
“Pretty much yeah,” Theo said.
It had been a trap. If they had been inside they would all be dead.
“Paris was not the only world you were an Unspeakable,” Draco said.
“Who cares where he goes? Let him run. Merlin knows he’s probably looking for his dead parents,” Harry said emphatically.
“I—can we never speak about this again?” Draco said.
“Yes.” Harry didn’t know how else to answer. He was dripping on the grey-green carpet of a bookshop.
Harry didn't have a satisfactory answer.
“Yeah. Thanks.” said Draco. They both heaved a sigh of relief, but Draco was the first to stand, giving Harry a hand up. Sand and grime were smudged all over his shirt and face. Draco remained closer than he had previously, even when he dropped Harry’s hand, and his expression was unreadable.
There must have been some sort of magical geas, because Pansy even now refused to talk about Greg in specifics, and she gossiped about everyone. She would just say that Greg had changed and cast around for any other topic.
“Are we children?” Draco said, just to be annoying.
Draco gripped his shoulder lightly and steered them towards a balcony on the edge of the ballroom. People shrank away from Draco as they walked while offering Harry passing greetings.
Harry can’t understand half the conversations, and it’s not even the French. It’s their local stuff that completely loses Harry. At least he understands London.
“You’re late,” Draco said. His arms were crossed.
“Is Millicent in Germany?” Draco asked.
“There’s nothing to know! Just because she was your partner doesn’t mean that we’re anything to each other. I never met her! I never wanted to meet you! I’m not an Auror!” Athena was yelling. Then a long silence.
“It’s mostly troop movements. I wasn’t able to get the extra rations across the border to the camps, but I’ll try to get them from Nott’s regiment.” Draco promised.
"I never said," Draco agrees mildly. Draco seems to read the exact moment Harry gives in. They do not have three days to catch the kind of people who would plant Dark objects in playgrounds. Harry turns to Healer Ahmed. "Can we be discharged?"
“I have the strangest headache and I’ve forgotten what I was saying a moment ago,” Draco said. He picked up the cigarette from where it had dropped and burned a hole in the carpet. Harry waved a wand to fix the scorch mark.
Harry checked his watch.
Counterclockwise one notch.
“If we don’t know where Malfoy is, he could collapse this universe and kill us all,” Kingsley said.
“Harry!” Penny threw herself at him. It was less a hug than that she patted all of his limbs within reach as if assuring herself they were all there. Her blue eyes brimmed with tears.
“When are you done work? I have something to consult you on,” Harry said.
They tried to give him a little time with the public defender and his mother. He waved both off and sat alone with a Magical Law Enforcement officer in a side room in the dungeons of the Ministry. She was a short but sturdy woman, who seemed to be constantly muttering under her breath but thankfully, didn’t seem to want to talk to him any more than he wanted to talk to her.
Draco was in one of his contemplative, thoughtful moods so he took his time with undressing them both. Harry’s body was broad, solid, golden and had more scars than Draco would have imagined. They were beautiful on him though.
Heart in his throat, Draco moves on to his own room. Similarly preserved. His bedroom is larger than the one in his current flat, so he takes a moment to turn in a small circle. The room is too dark. His father shouldn’t have given in to Draco’s fifth year impulse to paint the entire room black, with tiny moving pinpricks of yellow and white like stars. But that year his father was distracted and indulgent. In retrospect, it is a sign of what was to come.
“Ugh, Harry, take this one with you, would you?” Oliver said, gesturing at Draco.
“As far we can tell,” Kingsley said. “I’m only bringing you on for extraction, you hear? You’re coming along to take Draco safely to his home where we’ve got a Healer on standby. Purely defensive.”
Draco cocked his head to one side like he was trying to figure out if Harry was lying, and if it mattered. Harry took off the spare Firebird and handed it to him, their hands brushing as he passed it. He was still kneeling too close to Draco.
Harry nodded. That made sense. According to the mantle it was three pm and the incident had happened at one. Two hours was a long time. Too short to get a trace, but he was worried about what would be done in that time.
It must have taken a lot to come here, Draco thought.
One of them pulled the hood off. From the dark sliver under the gap of the door it was nighttime. Draco caught his breath.
“Darling, I’m glad they didn’t starve you there, but I don’t know how I feel about all of this,” Pansy said, pinching Draco’s bicep with powder pink manicured nails.
Harry almost forgot to panic, he was so focused on Draco’s story.
Draco was desperate to get some air, and there was Harry Potter again. Harry was wearing the finely tailored smoke grey robes of the Ministry Aurors. Was Harry to witness every fucking failure in Draco’s life from start to finish?
He arrived at an unfurnished upmarket Borough Market loft that unlocked as he approached. The walls were still shimmering with wards and the one bedroom appeared to be set up for each of them to have separate work stations.
Later in the party, Harry saw George was refilling Draco’s beer glass with his wand so it never emptied. Perhaps that was what Harry should have watched out for. Draco was flushed and had taken off his bowtie but he appeared to be steady.
“Already? Haven’t they been bickering with the Canadians for the last decade over the potions ingredient restrictions?” Draco asked.
“Tired?” Draco asked. Harry answered with a hum.
As far as Harry was concerned, the Ministry could go to blazes. Harry didn’t give a damn about their property and he’d just as soon destroy the Firebirds the same as give them back. He could admit he’d gone looking for Draco.
Someone came by to give him a bowl of gruel. They uncovered his head for the fifteen minutes he was allocated to eat and drink water. The slop was generally flavourless. The water tasted vaguely metallic and someone always watched him. They changed the person regularly to prevent him from trying to ingratiate himself. Hilarious.
“Who’s your friend, Drake?” The female co-worker called.
Often he overheard snippets of their lives and conversations. “If you’re being naughty, we won’t go to the park later,” a mother told her young toddler, who threw himself on the ground and wailed.
Draco smiled faintly.
While he was already here it seemed like a good time to shower, so he did that distractedly and shaved for good measure.
"You keep saying that," Sirius said.
This Draco looked like Harry's Draco but good looking and smiley.
“Are you allergic to anything?”
“But I wouldn’t want to be running from you,” Draco said. He winked and Harry could feel himself blush.
Even Harry had only had temporary Top Secret clearance for certain missions. He frowned. The rest was about what Harry had expected. He flicked through to see if he could note anything else. This project had begun three years ago, Hermione managed it overall and the other Principal Investigator had been Theodore Nott. Otherwise, there was nothing else interesting. His primary address was a London flat in a posh Mixed Muggle-Wizard neighbourhood. Next of kin listed Pansy Parkinson, address in Naxos, Greece.
Back at his flat, Gabriel took back the bracelet. It had been on for so long Draco didn’t feel its presence until it wasn’t there. Draco felt a warm rush of magic settle over him and rubbed his wrist.
“Draco?” Harry asked. His heart raced. This was his Draco.
When they replaced his food with greying beef and some limp carrots about a month later, he knew he was right. It was illegal for that kind of magic to be in your system before the courts. Draco couldn’t possibly tell what difference it was supposed to make. The robes they gave him were serviceably warm but worn and off-black.
“No. We were never much good at talking,” Draco says. They had been good at fucking. Good at hurting each other. Good at leaving things unsaid that should have been made clear from the start.
“Thank you! See you next week for dinner with Neville,” Hermione said.
“I guess Bill was right about both of us going,” Draco said. Before Harry could decipher that remark Draco disappeared into his tent. Harry entered his own tent, which was cool, cooler than he might have expected.
"I was flirting with you!"
“The Statute of Secrecy still applies. If you have any trouble, you may call me. Instructions on using your home phone are in the package. You will check in with me once a week. Make sure you respond to our wellness checks.”
"I'm sure he likes it fine," Hermione reassured. "Better than the old one in any case."
Still, he wondered if one of those classmates had held his father's hand as he died.
“Time to go home,” Harry said. Draco kissed him sloppily on the cheek. Ah, so that was his tell.
“That would be wonderful,” Draco said. “We’ve missed you.”
Hermione arrived in short order. She looked at Harry then Draco and back again. Harry was making a point of not looking at Draco. Draco was looking at him and barely at Hermione.
“I choose the program.”
“We’ll get there when we get there,” Harry said.
"You're angry with me," Draco says. "I know."
“Why? It doesn’t matter! I don’t know why Gran makes me go to school with stupid muggles anyway. They’re useless and they can’t do magic,” Teddy said.
Some of this destruction started before the War, Draco just didn’t fix it.
Here was the plain truth: Harry had been an Auror and he had always had trouble with boundaries. He’d woken up with case scrolls imprinted on his face. He lied during his annual assessments about how much sleep he got. Everyone did. There had been no one left at home to say ‘why don’t you come to bed, love’ because he stopped being able to have that around him. It all felt like a lie. There were always more kidnappings and raids and new addictive potions.
“Does that mean he might buy me a broom?” Teddy asked hopefully.
“What does that mean?” Harry interrupts. He knows what consummated means in this context, but he wants to know whether he’s clear on the suggestion.
His eyes filled with tears and he blinked them away hard. Sirius had silver threaded through his hair, but he was unmistakable. Without thinking, Harry went in for a hug. He held Sirius even past when it got strange and uncomfortable.
“Now’s not the time for that. If it were Ron, I would...I would...” Hermione trailed off.
With terrible penmanship, the card read:
“There’s no reason it would be limited to wizards either,” Kingsley said softly. “We all have a magical core.”
“Was he supposed to wear a top on a beach on vacation?” Harry asked, watching Neville flick water off his hair in a loop. He had the lightning scar. It looked better on him.
“Navy.” Kingsley said using Athena’s operation nickname “Wait.”
Harry felt as though he would soon regret this immensely.
"I thought it was illegal to own this?" Draco asked, pointing to one of the photographs of a cursed and very hideous medieval breastplate that had crushed at least three owners to death. Harry shrugged.
"Maybe this is the beginning of my budding career as an equestrian," Harry says, and this time Draco actually laughs.
Then Draco reached out and tucked a curl of hair behind Harry’s ear, brushing his cheek softly. Harry was so taken aback he let it happen. The haziness he felt in this body—which he realized might be party drugs—responded to this. With a bit of embarrassment, he realized he could feel the edge of a deep affection. Not friendship. Even Luna didn’t touch Harry like that. No one did.
It always felt better to have Harry off guard when Draco was leaving.
“They said your Firebird is malfunctioning. You could get stuck.You can come home!” Harry explained, frantic.
Draco had always thought Harry was emotional but now he can feel it. The desire, the embarrassment, the longing. Something warmer.
Draco is hard against Harry's hip but makes no move other than to shift closer. He even smells different now, like something wholesome and sweet, like oats. But there’s an undercurrent of coppery sweat.
“What’s going on with you and Gin?” Ron asked next Saturday at the Burrow before breakfast had started. Ginny had written Molly to say she was unwell and wouldn’t be coming down from training camp this weekend.
Gabe looked hopeful. Draco waved. His crush had faded but it might be nice to have a friend.
Draco pretended the kissing never happened the next morning so Harry did too. Draco still brought people home, so Harry did too, and let Draco tease him about it.
“Who was that for?” Harry asked.
“Bill won’t care,” Harry said. He had no idea whether this was true.
She snorted at the memory, but fondly. He hadn’t known about this tradition because no one had done it to him. But he liked it better this way round.  Harry continued to watch him for a few seconds longer.
“Do you know how to build a mental wall?” Draco tries to help Harry by talking him through basic Occlumency exercises but he can feel when Harry’s attention wavers. Harry is taking shallow breaths, too shallow for Draco’s liking.
He spotted Hermione and Draco, looking for all the world like the beloved reigning King and Queen. The cameras turned away from him to take pictures of them, and Harry drew closer to them.
“You’ve been busy. But you’re welcome any time,” Andromeda said. She knew he was on leave, but she made her excuses for him.
“What do I do then?” Harry asked. Draco had spotted them and was coming over. Harry was uncertain he had ever seen that expression. It was a warm, engaging smile, notably absent of any mocking or glee over his misfortune.
She leaves them in the staged master bedroom to think about it.
“The magic is always old, Harry.” Her voice echoed and echoed and echoed.
“I wasn’t going to let you all go without me,” Athena said. She glared at him as if expecting him to bring up that she had walked off the investigation.
But people still treated him so carefully, even people who had known him before he became the “Saviour” twice over.
“You, too. You’re much calmer. It feels like we...buried the past.” It’s unclear whether Draco wants him to agree. His eyebrow is quirked, his mouth twisted with a wry amusement.
“I would love to see you when I’m back,” Blaise had written from Milan a year ago. They had not been close at Hogwarts, but Blaise Zabini was familiar.
“You must be very good friends if the curse bound you that tightly,” a mediwizard says on their second day. Draco doesn’t say anything, doesn’t look at Harry.
“You should have said something earlier. Jamie, top cabinet on the left?” his mother said. She put an arm lightly around him. “Has this been happening a lot? It’s not a migraine, is it?”
“If a physical bond were established, you would be able to go without touch and we could terminate the completed bond at a later time.”
“I’m vetoing it,” Harry says.
“I told one Harry who I was. One who was an Unspeakable.”
“One question at a time,” a second speaker said.
Their flat was a rental despite Draco’s complaints it wasn’t cost-effective; Harry had the money and could have forty homes if he wished. It wasn’t like there was a shortage of wizarding homes when you could live in Stornoway and Floo into London for work if you wanted.
“Not even if I liked men. Was he even your type before you disappeared on this mission?” Ron said.
He went for his wand but Greg was faster. Greg punched Draco in the face so hard he felt a sickening crack and fell back. Within his own walls, if Greg tried to curse him the rebuilt wards would have rebounded it. Blood poured from his nose. Draco rolled onto his knees to make sure he wouldn’t choke on it and fumbled for his wand. Greg appeared to absorb his three stunners in a row. Draco had never seen anything like it.
“Damn you, Harry.” Draco looked away. A stray rock bounced somewhere upstairs with a loud clatter. This Harry’s nerves were so shot, Harry couldn’t flinch.
“But I don’t pay you anything,” Harry said obediently. Draco scoffed.
“You’re the one who said it wasn’t real,” Harry said when Draco pulled away.
“I am sorry for your loss,” Andromeda said once she made her way to the front of the receiving line. Her face betrayed no emotion. She offered them a bow as everyone else had.
Turnabout is fair play, Draco supposed. Harry must have noted the lack of marks on his chest. He must be curious about it, given their history.
When she looked at Harry, her mouth straightened unhappily.
Draco turned to Florean. “Can I have one lemon ice, one chai ice cream, and four pints to go? One mint chocolate, one vanilla, one pistachio, one cinnamon toast. Those are your children’s regular orders, right?”
“It’s so fucking hot in there,” Harry complained. Belatedly, he realized that generals probably didn’t swear and if they did it probably wasn’t in front of disgraced men they had a questionable acquaintance with.
"Can we talk?" They are both off shift now. Harry shrugs. He allows Draco to wait for him to pack his bag, to walk with him down the hallway. At least half the lifts are under repair so Draco backs into Harry inch by inch as their lift car fills. Draco places a hand on Harry's bicep but to Harry's surprise it's not to make distance between them. Harry waits until they are in Muggle London and have been walking side by side for some time to demand answers.
“It’s a minor test,” Hermione said.
“Terribly sorry,” Draco added when Neville looked at him, although he sounded nothing of the sort.
“It must have been hard,” Greg remarked. “Living around them.”
“Draco, why did you come here? To this bar, with me?”
The last step of the process was an entrance interview at the Magical Training and Recruitment office in the Ministry. It had gone okay until the end, though Draco was too nervous to really know whether any of the five panelists had liked any of his answers; they seemed trapped in various degrees of boredom.
Harry shut up Grimmauld once again, but this time a little sadly. With another person, he had enjoyed being there for once. It hadn’t seemed so empty, dark and sad. But with no one to share it with, he didn’t think he would return as often. Not while he still felt all tangled up.
“Sirius,” Harry said. Harry squeezed his eyes shut and opened them again.
“Don’t lose your head, Harry,” Kingsley said. He patted him on the back. 46 minutes to go. He went to go find Zacharias and Penny to get briefed and encountered Athena instead.
A chorus of titters went up around him in the break room. Well, he wasn’t very popular, he reminded himself. He was self-conscious as he went up to look at the chart. He studied it for a few seconds.
"Thank you," Harry says. Draco isn't really interested in running through more of Cardiff pursuing this creature. He doesn't work for the Department of Mysteries and backup is at least five minutes away.
Draco didn’t look back as they left the Pyramid. The Firebird was cool, but he would have to wait for a moment to be alone. The trip back felt shorter, and they didn’t speak again until they reached a small clearing full of army green tents. A few people poked their heads out of tents to wave.
“That was possible. This is real,” Draco said.
From what Harry has seen of Montreal—which admittedly isn’t much, from the Portkey Hall arrivals at the train station, to peering out the window of a taxi where the driver spoke on his phone the whole time, to a hotel lobby—it is charming.
“Off to your flat?” he asked Harry.
“And they killed my first husband, and my brother and several of my cousins, too. Do you think you’re alone? This is not a rectory. It is a hospital. We treat
“You think Malfoy would visit me at St Mungo’s if someone glassed me?” Harry joked, contemplative.
When Draco saw Greg a second time after their initial meeting the day after he was released, he realized he had not been sufficiently scared of him the first time. Greg was wearing a black trench coat over black robes and filled his doorway, blocking out the meagre sunlight. There was something about the set of his shoulders and the blankness of his expression he’d seen before.
Harry laughed aloud, harder than he meant to.
Once a week Gabriel would come over and inspect his flat for contraband. Gabe did him the courtesy of at least pretending he was checking how things were coming along although he did genuinely seem delighted to find out Draco had learned how to use the phone.
“He’s fine, thanks to Harry. He’s recovering,” Narcissa said.
Fielder is fine. Trustworthy. She even has Healer training which is useful if paired with Harry. But he doesn't think about her otherwise. Maybe that's an absurd bar to clear when Draco was an obsession of his since he was eleven.
Having apparently tired of chatting, Draco puts a hand on the back on Harry's neck and waits. His face is upturned slightly.
They drag it out with one more pint, like they have all the time in the world. For once, Harry is the one to send a message to Michael to clear out. He feels kind of nervous and a little silly. Conferences have gone in this direction before, but at least this time the person he’s hooking up with is not a colleague he might end up interviewing in a few years. He's not taken any vows—of celibacy or otherwise.
There was a moment where Draco paused, shuddered, and looked at him like a stranger. Harry looked at his Firebird by chance and it glowed red. He looked back at Draco and there was a looping silver chain disappearing into his robes.
Harry Potter intellectually understood that Draco Malfoy was out in Muggle London, as he had been paying attention to the Prophet when the sentencing happened a few years ago. But it was something else entirely to see the evidence with his own eyes.
It was his Draco that knocked when the door swung open. He looked different. He looked different from any other version of him. He was still a little underfed, a little haunted. It was as if Draco expected him to tell him to go home. Wand out, like there might be someone lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce.
“I heard your mum thunder in and I was eating pretzels with no shirt on. Fucking booked it to the other room.” Draco complained.
“And Mr. Malfoy? If I were you, I would consider removing any
“I’ve got guest bedrooms if you’d like,” Harry said. Draco took off his shirt and trousers unceremoniously in Harry’s bedroom. The room felt hotter and smaller than it had just seconds ago.
“Cheers,” Harry said. Chike smiled. Draco scowled.
“I think we got confused because of what happened over there,” Draco said. “Did you see how it was with Hermione?”
“I could kiss you,” Harry said fervently.
Then, when he had waited long enough, he took a deep bracing breath and turned the longer wing clockwise once.
“Absorbed a stunner? Like a troll or something?” Harry asked.
“No,” Harry said. He faked a wince, and she stroked his arm.
“You can have a little to drink, babes. Maddy will be just fine with mum,” a pink-haired Tonks told Remus. They both looked older, but they were here too.
“I want to talk about this feeling of being useful. Don’t you think there are other things that you can value about yourself?” Healer Blishwick said. Harry tried not to groan audibly. Well, at least they were doing this somewhere that made sense.
Harry brought out his wand and poked at the necklace, too. He had never had a man’s wandwork make him pay attention; his was efficient, thorough and powerful. For a second, he could feel the distinct golden warmth of Harry’s magic press against his own and Draco fought the urge to lean into it. Draco shook his head instead.
His mother looked like the old her, and Draco found it unsettling. Her white hair was set in cascading curls, her lipstick was fire engine red and she had used all the glamours she’d once favoured. She had no laugh lines or freckles. Her long nails matched her lipstick, far from the short plain and neat style she favoured these days because she spent most of her time gardening.
Harry wanted a home like this. He finally realized why Ginny had asked him to go to shops with her on their weekends off to pick new dishes when they already had dishes.
“Isn't Potions a lot like cooking?” Harry ventured.
“Ow! Keep your claws to yourself, witch,” Draco said. Draco flicked a finger with a small non-verbal spell and Pansy nearly careened off the furniture. His control was shot.
Harry gave Draco a hand up. Amazing what not lying on a hardwood floor and bleeding could do for your mood. Draco led Harry to his bedroom, under markedly different circumstances than he might have hoped.
“The next Emperor Mage of Russia. It explained how horrific their Italian was. Even mine wasn’t as bad. He was fleeing assassins from his younger brother, trying to get himself ahead in the line of succession. Nasty business.”
“No,” Draco said too fast. Harry let him have that too, winding his long fingers in Harry’s hair absentmindedly.
“Her sister Ruth also lost her husband. I tried to help. She shut me out because I reminded her too much of Dorcas,” Kingsley said. Harry had never seen Kingsley look so defeated.
Harry could feel the grit in his teeth, but spitting out sand to allow more sand in his mouth had seemed futile. Harry found his way to his own tent. Helpfully, the personnel tents were in alphabetical order, with last names over the tent flaps in white block letters. His tent and Malfoy’s were side by side.
Today was marked, but it still surprised him when he showed up to the restaurant in Diagon Alley and Draco stood there in front of the restaurant. His Firebird was cool with a faint pinkish glow; Draco had been here recently, but he wasn’t here now. It was still worth it to find out more though.
The hand belonged to Draco Malfoy. He was outfitted much like Harry, in the same khaki pants, long sleeve shirt and Tilly hat with a flap to cover the back of his neck. All of his clothing looked tailored though, while Harry’s outfit was slightly oversized, billowing out when he turned. Draco’s cooling charms must not be working as well, because there was a large dark patch in the middle of his back.
If Harry squinted, he could see the movement of light that meant Zacharias was almost at the shipping container.
Veritaserum only revealed what was top of mind. Draco had used his occlumency to block whatever he could when he arrived, knowing it would eventually come to this. He was left with particular memories. Harry caressing Draco’s temple when he thought he was asleep. The way he’d looked that day in the bookshop.
“I could have done that for you! I have first aid training,” Harry said. Draco felt the urge to derail into a conversation about the healing he had to undo when someone had botched the job at home or work.
“Kingsley?” Harry said.
Draco apparated into the building with that awful Death Eater billow of black smoke, wand pointed. Harry couldn’t even defend himself if he wanted.
"What would I do in Zurich?" Harry asks.
Harry looked in the fridge. Lettuce, eggs, olives, tomatoes, green beans...he should definitely roast that aubergine tomorrow, and do something with the parsley. He looked in the pantry and he did have tinned tuna.
“I’m sorry.” Trainee Forrester said through gritted teeth.
It disappointed him that it seemed like there were no universes where he wasn’t like this, perpetually caught up in some past. Draco was rubbing his shoulders to try to give him comfort.
He had hoped to sell some pieces to see if someone could do something about the Mark. It had faded and left a pink outline in scar tissue of what had once been there. He could glamour it, but he would need something expensive and more permanent if it was never to be visible again.
Draco found a broken nose was really quite a lot more blood than anyone wanted outside their body for a minor injury. He pinched the bridge of his nose to try to get something to clot.
Kingsley’s voice had softened a little when he spoke again.
Harry went to do the same and his hand brushed against a familiar chain against the back of Draco’s neck. He paused. Draco had half unbuttoned Harry’s shirt, and he was looking at Harry’s chest.
“Hi,” Draco said. The quality of his voice was slower, less polished. Harry thought he might’ve been able to tell that this was not his Draco. His Draco? What a phrase.
Draco got to the stairs and decided to Apparate to the top rather than climb them. He could rally around for sex, he supposed. But it wasn’t until his tempus charm went off the next morning that he realized Harry had deliberately led him to sleep. Draco silenced his spell and took a few minutes to enjoy being wrapped in Harry’s warmth and grey linen.
Harry was not sure what to do with either thought. That alone represented a revelation, and this was a hell of a time for an existential crisis.
“Just a couple minutes longer,” she murmured.
“You can do it again,” Harry said. Harry’s head was not clear enough for flirting. He wanted to continue. “I want you to.” In case there were lingering questions about Harry’s intentions.
“That operation was a complete disaster. You all could have been killed with nothing to show for it. If I say wait, I mean wait. If I say hang on, you better fucking well hang on,” Kingsley said. “Are we clear?”
“And my wit. It is world-class,” Draco added. Eustace just laughed.
“You brought him home to me, and that’s all that matters,” she said finally. Narcissa was beautiful but not nearly as cold as he remembered. She had lovely crow’s feet, a sprinkling of freckles across her nose and the same eyes as Draco.
“I’m named after my grandfather, but he didn’t much like my father. I think my Da hoped it would make him think better of him, but it didn’t work. Also, my grandfather hated anyone who idled around reading books rather than doing something useful. So it’s a bit funny, isn’t it? Also, not good for any nicknames.”
“I’ve always kept a diary. Since I was a child. I could read back and figure out who I was supposed to be,” Draco said. He folded in on himself as if he thought Harry was going to grab him.
“I don’t cook, Harry,” Draco said, frowning at him.
“Doing what?” Harry said, aware he may have wandered into a trap.
“You would.” Draco rolls his eyes but still sounds fond. But he doesn’t walk away like the other houses. Draco reaches for Harry’s hand.
“Not your fault, is it? It was a long time ago,” Harry said. “What about the necklace?”
“I didn’t bring you that kind of evidence.” Harry fished the shrunken redacted reports out of his pockets and laid them out on the kitchen table before tapping them with his wand
Harry went back to one universe a day schedule afterwards. He could not keep his head clear enough without it. He took a day to rest. He shaved his beard which was unruly with neglect. It had been so long he had to do a trim first with scissors. He had taken a shower remembering the grime of the last universe. He had flossed, and changed his sheets instead of spelling them clean.
And it was in the middle of this thought he stumbled. He pushed his hand into the hot sand, discovering unpleasantly that it was hotter the deeper he went. It was a gradual burn. He pulled his hand out quickly. Someone reached out and hauled Harry to his feet hard.
She came around his right side and sat next to him, leaning on him. Ron sat on his left side.
"We’ve broken so many! Spells aren't the same," Patience said. Kingsley agreed.
“That looks horrible,” Theo said. He took a bite of the pastry off Pansy’s fork anyway. Pansy’s face softened for a brief moment, looking at Theo.
Draco carefully considers this as if it’s a matter of importance instead of the long ago settled ruins of something less than a relationship that had ended over ten years ago. He laughs a little.
“Have I passed?” Draco said after they left. Harry didn’t always go back to the castle now since his weekends were his own unless he had night duty or practice. Sometimes he escorted Draco to his flat and then walked to Grimmauld.
“I knew that. I should go read,” Draco said, taking his food and orange juice on a tray. Harry didn’t stop him. He left him alone in the Black family library all day.
Draco looks a little lost at that. “You asked me for a drink. I came.”
Draco still feels a little melancholy and high-strung so he appreciates the space from Harry. He appreciates the time to consider the cheery beige of the walls, and the plush ocean blue welcome mat as he kicks his shoes off, leaving them in the middle of the floor instead of on the black shoe rack.
They met once a week, sometimes bringing a friend or two as a buffer. It brought out different sides of their personalities. Draco became very quiet around Luna and Neville while Harry became more relaxed. During Blaise and Pansy's visit to England, Harry was the quiet one, and Draco’s sense of humour turned vicious. He wasn’t convinced they were friends, but they knew him in a way Harry never would. Around Ron and Hermione Draco seemed more like himself, but even that was tempered with a strange tension—after all, Hermione was his boss.
Theo examined the paintings on the wall in Draco’s bedroom while he and Pansy sat on his settee. Draco would have offended Pansy if he asked her to sit in one of the public rooms, and he wanted something that felt normal.
"Are you sure? We can wait it out if you want." Harry nods again.
“We’ve called St Xanthus in Bonn, but it will take at least a day to hear back from the expert there. She’s on maternity leave.”
“I hope you know that you’re still a part of this family and you will always be welcome here,” Arthur said.
“Tell me about Harry Potter.” Draco gave them an entire treatise on Harry Potter’s forearms. He got a slap across the face for his trouble. Draco felt dizzy. They could poison him using that much Veritaserum.
“I work at Hogwarts,” Harry explained.
George was here. Fred was beside him. Harry found himself staring. In all his travels he had never felt the strangled hope in his chest as he had in this moment. They were together.
“How can I help you?” Every syllable clipped.
“Not unless you want Zabini to come out of the kitchen to kill us both,” Draco said like he had no opinion either way. “We do tip extravagantly though.”
Draco looked up. So he was. He was in a maze of hallways indistinguishable from the ones he had left and yet nowhere closer to the atrium.
Draco woke Harry  in the middle of the night with a shake on the shoulder. Harry started for his wand before flexing his hand and putting it back under the blanket. They both noticed.
"No. What are you going to do with stables?" Draco says.
He was desperately trying to save his things. He scrambled to pick up a book, pictures of his friends and family, a sliver of the mirror from Sirius mounted in a frame. But the water soon closed over his head and he sank to the bottom.
“The item he took is called a Firebird. It’s an experimental magical device that allows you to jump to alternate universes. When we tested you last year, we had made several prototypes for study. He's taken one. We need someone to look for him,” Hermione said.
“Malfoy. What are you doing at the Ministry?” Harry asked him as Draco left the room.
he didn’t want any part of in this world or the next, so he barrelled forward, with Draco behind him.
“Because the amount of magic you imbue an object is limited by the magical properties of its materials. You can make an ordinary thing dangerous but not powerful. Even a wandtree doesn’t have this much magic.”
Harry was the one who set aside their careful distance and reached for Draco for the first kiss and the second and all the rest, until the sun had risen, and Draco was underneath him, looking as lovely as it had felt to whirl under the stars.
“The structure is original to the sixteenth or seventeenth century,” Pansy says.
Before Harry had thought of Draco all the time and now, he simply didn’t. It was strange, wasn’t it? That his world had narrowed so much and he had forgotten so much. He had forgotten how it felt to throw himself completely into everything. He had forgotten how it felt to be that entangled in a mystery with consequences for everyone.
“Draco?” Gabe said. “I’m not supposed to ask, but owl me if you ever want to go to the pub together. For a drink or something. But only if you want.” Gabe was uncharacteristically tongue-tied.
Harry returned to Hogwarts and forgot about the test in a few short days. Midterms were upcoming and some of his students in the seventh year seminar were already worried about their NEWTs in the spring. In his fifth year of teaching, he finally felt he grasped the rhythms of the school year.
“Sorry, but I need some air—” Here Harry gestured.
Sometimes they had forgotten him entirely and everyone would have a new inside joke he wasn’t privy to next time he came around. One day he’d shown up to some dinner and Blaise had joined their group. No one thought it was strange, but no one could explain either. Harry didn’t mind so much though. He could stand a little loneliness for some privacy.
“I am the only Potions master certified on this continent to brew twelve Ministry restricted potions. I have fifty exclusive worldwide patents. Tell me, Harry, should I cook?” She said.
Harry wondered about the sex they might have and once he went in that direction he pulled back. Get a hold of yourself, he thought sternly. He should have broken off that kiss the moment he had entered.
“Yes. I’ve watched you put away half a treacle tart as an adult, so no one’s perfect.” Draco said. “What will you have?”
Draco swallowed hard. If pressed, he knew he’d be obligated to name the few people that had approached him in his first days back. But Harry waved a hand dismissively.
“Hermione is your friend, and I can’t hide in your home forever,” Draco said. It seemed a token protest. Harry loved Hermione, but he made his own decisions.
“It’s practice,” Draco said as they entered the house.
“They can’t work with us here,” Narcissa said quietly. She took his hand and led him into their kitchens. She sat him on the chair and started casting. She cleaned his robes, glasses and then took a wet cloth to begin cleaning little cuts he hadn’t noticed and healing them one by one. It was comforting in a strange way.
“I’m alright. Same as last week. Gods, I don’t know what you and your man get up to in that flat,” Sirius waggled his eyebrows. “Maybe try to go for some walks, eh? Get some fresh air. Both you and him have been a little strange lately.”
“I’m looking to buy something,” Harry said. He winced and a rivulet of sweat rolled down his back.
There was a time Harry would have heard the disdain more than the joke. Draco offered him a small, almost imperceptible wink. Harry grinned.
"Not like that, like this," Draco said. And suddenly there was no space between them at all, and Draco wound his arms around Harry's neck. His face was buried in Harry's shoulder. Their dancing reminded Harry of sex in the point and counterpoint of it, although what they were doing was relatively sedate swaying. Even in this sensory mess of other people's cologne, body heat and third hand cigarette smoke, Harry could still pick out the sharp clean scent of him. He recognized it anywhere, it permeated their flat.
When the subject turned to Draco, she just said, “It’s for the best, Harry. His experience was different from yours.”
"Ah, you know this and that." Harry was a shit actor.
After stumbling through a few more details, she leaves them to wander around the yard by themselves, sun shining brightly with a brisk breeze.
“Auror Potter, Auror Malfoy?” Healer Tadenik runs into the unit with 3 mediwizards behind her. “Glad you’re awake.”
“How much of that did you hear?” Kingsley asked.
“Good job team. See you Saturday.”
When she turned her face back to Harry, he felt a shock. Lily Evans Potter’s eyes were exactly the same shade of green as his, just as people told him his whole life. She looked a little like Aunt Petunia now she was older, truth be told, but with softer features and auburn hair framing her face in a sharp bob.
“Figures I’d almost have to die too, before you’d commit,” Draco said archly.
"You said," Harry says. "I know." He slept with Draco knowing it was 99.9% likely nothing would come of it. He would still do it again.
“Take both of them,” A tall man said.
“You keep telling me you're not together, but that seems pretty together,” Hermione said. Harry had completely forgotten she was here.
Draco went into his prepared spiel about preventable deaths and overall healthcare savings, but he kept on eye on Harry who made sure to politely nod while Draco spoke.
“Where am I?” Draco asked in a hoarse whisper.
Draco’s skin was cool and dry in contrast with Harry’s warm and clammy hands. Draco stood at the top and swore a few times as he spotted the rune.
“Everything about this is bizarre. You fancy him, but that’s different from deciding...I don’t know what you’ve decided, but you’re always intense about it,” Ron said.
Theo got it faster than Draco had. Theo struggled not to smile as Pansy taught him. Draco watched them look at each other and stashed that knowledge away for later. If his friends were happy, he would be as well.
Harry hadn’t known that. He had thought it had just been a random place his parents had picked and happened to die. Harry knew by now that Draco wasn’t interested in straying too far from their timeline. Godric’s Hollow’s significance could be different in his world, but it never occurred to him to ask. He realized again that he’d been denied so much knowledge.
“Headache?” Harry asked.
“No, he works at the Department of Mysteries, messing around with the fabric of time,” Pansy chimed in. Theo shrugged. So it was possible to find Ministry work with their history.
“My letters,” she lisped
“We didn’t come here to check on the crib, Harry,” Hermione said gently. ‘We came to check on you.”
“If you were to run, where would you go?” Harry asked instead, curious. He didn’t think it could help, but this was a Draco if not his Draco.
Harry knew what the patterns meant without going to his notes. He should have known where the Firebird would drop him next.
“Harry. It’s been a while,” Hermione said. Her tone was unmistakably icy. How could it have been a while since he saw his best friend?
Other times, Harry asked questions late at night, when they lay awake in bed together, unable to sleep. They faced each other, whispering in the dark.
The first house Pansy shows them in Godric's Hollow looks like a haunted fairytale cottage. Ivy creeps along the eaves, and the shape is vaguely reminiscent of a farmhouse. There are two small circular dark windows deep set in the one story house like eyes. When they step inside, the entire colour scheme is muted, drab greys, greens and browns.
“Potter will come for his pet for certain.”
"It's never too late for love," Harry said.
“Let me stay here. I’ll do anything,” Draco said. The pain woven into Draco’s voice was almost unbearable. Harry used his thumb to brush away some of the tears, but they kept coming. “I’m not alone here. I don’t want to leave.”
“Nothing that concerns you, Potter,” Draco told him.
“Not telling,” Harry said.
"I have to be at the hospital at 7 and it's 4," Draco said, casting a quick alarm spell.
“Those people were friendly,” Harry remarked. He could see Draco clench and unclench his jaw.
The problem is they definitely need to stop going back and forth between Grimmauld Place and Draco’s tiny bedsit with Blaise, Millie, Luna, and whatever poor travelling soul couldn’t scare up better accommodations than Luna’s ‘vegan, queer, gillyweed friendly, price: give from your heart’ listing on WixSurf.
“Hi,” Harry said when he felt the change in the air that meant Draco had emerged from the back room. He waited an extra beat before turning around.
Draco cast and the light flickered. He frowned at his wand and tried again. This time it was so bright, Harry had to shield his eyes with one hand.
“You may also serve a sentence of five years less the time already served in Azkaban. It is your choice. No matter your choice, you will have to make a payment of restitution of 15,000 Galleons for the victims' fund.”
Truth be told, he knew what he wanted to do. The Malfoys were not in a financial position for him to take after his father and idle around settling real estate and dealing in rare and borderline illegal magical artifacts. His father's reparations payment wiped out half their fortune and much of it had already been in goods. Draco could read between the lines from Narcissa Malfoy’s letters.
“Malfoy.”
"All my stories are about terrible things," Draco said.
If Harry was going to tire of this sordid affair eventually, he wanted everything he could get in the meantime. He had never been a fixation before and he wasn’t sure he liked it, but he would take Harry however he could have him.
“Is there any other way to get rid of this?” Draco asks, an insistent note creeping into his tone. “We have to report back."
“I thought the person who is showing parts of our investigation to a former Death Eater would be the first place I’d look, sir.”
"You must have misfiled it," Draco said. The three of them knew what she was saying.
“The room across from this one,” Draco added. Harry got up and ran there and back, bringing a circular framed mirror that hung over the chimney in that room. Harry was careful not to slip. Draco could feel as his eyes started to swell shut.
Even if they’d looked nothing like him, he would have known those were his children. His heart swelled a little at the sight. There were a few more of their friends, and it surprised him to see one of his sons pressed cheek to cheek with a blond boy who was the spitting image of Draco if he were a rather round preschooler. He would bet Galleons it was his kid blowing bubbles at the camera on a loop.
“Harder,” Harry grunted.
The Weasley children, Tonks, Sirius, Remus, Oliver and Lee gathered for the last drink.
"I don’t mind Procedures, but I don’t know if I want to do them every day.”
Draco’s face shuttered. Any hint of emotion was carefully erased.
“Yeah sure mum. Will do.” He kissed her on the cheek and gave her a big hug. Over her shoulder he glanced at a mirror over the fireplace at his face. There was no scar at all. Huh.
“They sent you?” Draco asked. He stood up straight. All the languorousness of Parisian Draco had left his body entirely.
Harry nodded yes. Draco straightened up. “I expect you'll want to spend a few minutes alone.”
She looked tired, Harry finally noticed. Her eyes were unfocused even as she looked at him. She had put two espresso shots in her latte and she had the cinnamon and peppermint breath of someone who had been regularly dosing themselves with Pepper-Up.
They walked him to the foyer with more questions to see if he was okay. Then his mum stepped into the Floo with him and said “10 Bridal Court” and the fireplace whisked them away.
The sounds of the party had grown faint when Draco said, “you have to cross the river on foot,” while pulling off his socks.
With this information, they issued warrants for a blitz of more low-level operatives to try to confirm what they’ve guessed. Most wouldn’t speak, but a few key people cracked and made a deal to stop themselves from going to Azkaban for decades.
This Draco was adept at reading Harry's expressions. He could detect his fading distress. He knew what he had needed. Harry wasn’t sure he liked that.
He knew he would go back before he finished the thought. Harry hadn’t felt anything like this rush of adrenaline and reliance on his instincts for a while. It almost reminded him of the good parts of being an Auror.
“I’m not going to come back,” Draco says. “You understand that?” An old anger bubbles up in Harry.
He sat on the bed and took out the Firebird, which was still bright white. Harry pulled the wing back to centre.
Draco moves slowly. He scoots down the bench until he’s pressed up, warm and steady, against Harry. He brings his pint and sets it carefully next to Harry’s. Then he is leaning further still. Harry doesn’t move. He lets Draco run his hand up Harry’s arm, then catches Draco's fingertips and pulls him in. There’s a beat where Harry is determined not to be the one who chases, again. Draco has no such qualms and kisses him once.
It was cool for May, but the heat generated by the crowd made the air steamy. Harry stuck a finger under his cravat.
"Look, we just want to know if you've seen anything," Draco says, his palms upturned. He has stowed his wand because he knows from experience many magical creatures hate them. Her shoulders relax a fraction.
"Can think of something better," Draco says. Harry conjures extra lube, slicks it down his length. The long, hot slide of pressing into Draco nearly undoes him right there. He muffles a groan, digs his nails in his own thigh to stop himself from being too loud. Draco brushes his hands over Harry's soothingly and interlaces their fingers. Harry starts slow and deep, pleading with himself to last.
“All the friends he brought were older and strangely protective. Blaise kept saying there was something awfully familiar about them, but honestly, if a count’s son wants to bring a harem to a Sardinian villa, how is that our problem? But turns out while he’s technically a count’s son...”
Harry finally slept well. No more half-jumbled, too-vivid dreams. When he awoke, Draco was gone. Harry’s heart raced until he heard the clanging of pots and pans downstairs.
It was Draco who released him when the music stopped while Harry held on a few seconds too long. Harry looked around. No wands. No technology. Nothing but an upbeat string quartet, happy couples doing some kind of country jig and beautiful gowns as far as the eye could see. Was that Hermione in the far corner?
"Now Draco, that's no way to refer to the Monegasque royals," Hermione said with a bit of tease in her voice. Draco grinned then, so happy it lit up his face.
The pyramid loomed in the distance, appearing suddenly when they passed through some invisible barrier. Harry couldn’t tell if it had been five minutes or an hour they had been walking since the heat had a way of distorting time.
He picked up Draco once again and saw Narcissa Malfoy on the Manor’s doorstep but didn’t stop running until he was at the door.
"You are always so sentimental." Draco paused. Perhaps he wasn't sure that remark would be received well. Harry didn't mind. They sat.
Harry doesn’t think he’d even have convinced Draco if not that Pansy needs to sell something as an estate agent. Anything. She has yet to manage the feat in two years.
“Harry, you can find someone if that’s what you want.” Draco was so sincere when he leaned over to put a hand on the back of Harry’s chair. Draco smelled spicy and warm, like a cup of mulled cider after a winter hike. Harry wanted to bolt. Forget about the rest of it, it was this casual closeness that would have torn him apart, little by little.
Having you made it harder to remember.”
He eventually was caught by Blaise, who corralled him and Harry in the kitchen. Harry bumped Draco with his shoulder, and Draco did it back. It was a friendly thing they did all the time living with each other, but it felt different, electric. He was definitely a bit drunk now.
“I think you have a thing for blonds,” Draco declared as the front door slammed shut on...Ethan? Ewan? Aaron?
“Absolutely not. Haven’t been back,” Draco says. Harry knew that already. “I read the Prophet sometimes, but I’m not really keeping up much.”
“Wait in each world until it cools down and use it when you're alone. Most people can't perceive the Firebird, but if you draw attention to it someone will get suspicious. Do not take it off,” Hermione said.
“I’m alright, Penny.” Harry patted her on the back awkwardly.
Draco was exasperated as she was transparently trying to be annoying and succeeding. That and she’d eaten all his ginger chicken because she’d ordered her own food too spicy.
“Do you have something to say, Smith?”
Harry had to treat this as an actual investigation or he would never solve this and catch up to him. He flitted through the house like a ghost, spending an entire day trying to figure out how to structure this.
“They never told me anything. Harry Potter. Dunno the rest. ” He slurred. They must have given him three times the dose needed.
“There are enough flowers,” Draco insisted. But he knew it wasn't about the flowers.
Harry brought out a worn black velvet case onto Draco’s counter. He’d seen other customers give Draco something to look at before. Draco always lit up for something new to him despite his hesitancy.
“Cheer up. Be thankful you won’t have to navigate that nonsense with this one. ” Pansy said.
Harry’s floo activated and Harry was met with Draco. He was wearing Muggle clothes which Harry hadn’t realized Draco wore at all. He was very casual in some sort of jeans and a grey henley with the sleeves rolled up and those glasses again. He had always assumed that Draco kept the Mark hidden as it would have faded, but he had covered it with a solid band of black.
Harry doesn’t hear Pansy come up behind them so there’s a pang of guilt when she chimes in a faux-chipper voice, “It’s just the first house. There’s others!” The faint edge of desperation reminds him Pansy needs this sale. She doesn't even make fun of Harry as per usual, and it makes him feel slightly terrible.
Harry thought he spoke a little Malfoy at this point. Translation: I don’t want to talk about it.
“No, not why Malfoy escaped. I expect if you knew, you’d find him. Why are you asking me?”
“Give me a minute.” When more like five minutes had passed, he opened his eyes.
“Isn’t there someone else?” Harry asked. He already knew the answer by the slope of her brow and the unhappy tilt of Hermione’s mouth.
“I think you’ll find that with one notable exception you get what you want from me,” Draco says dryly. Harry doesn’t know what to say. What Harry wanted was a mess of contradictions. He searches for steadier ground.
Harry got three glasses of champagne to the table, as the serving wizard winked at him. Harry thought he was handsome, then tried to figure out whether it was just because the man was blond and in this universe, Harry had a thing for Draco. How did this work anyway? How could Harry know whether it was him or his current self?
"No," Harry said.
“At the rate MACUSA is going, several crime cartels are going to have a better seat than the Americans next summit.”
“Yeah, he likes it,” Harry guessed.
“When we found out we were having a baby, he said that he wanted to be a better father than Abraxas. He wanted to make sure that he loved you unconditionally. He loved you more than anything in the world, but he didn’t always succeed in telling you. He also didn’t understand that parents should apologize to children. That was his father’s influence.”
Neville’s face had hardened when he saw Draco, but whatever the issue was, he was polite enough to give him a quick nod. Malfoy’s expression was carefully neutral. Whatever emotion he had shown Harry was strictly under control, subsumed by that blankness.
“They let you teach impressionable minds at the Muggleborn Centre with that filthy mouth? I’m shocked.” This time Harry did laugh loudly.
Harry knew what that was like. He had other friends but Hermione and Ron had become his family.
“I won’t apologize to him. We all know it’s true. They should have never let him in. My cousin died in the—”
“Draco doesn’t drink,” Hermione chastised.
Draco was lost in thought and his voice came slow and faint.
There could be, but there isn't. "No."
"This is Yannick from Mind Healing. Yannick, this is—"
“He’s here!” Narcissa said.
“I shouldn’t be telling you anything,” Hermione muttered, her voice flinty. “If I’d known you’d be so bloody obsessed with him—”
Harry landed while descending the steps and tripped. He knocked down a photo that was hanging on the wall and caught it. The picture was of him aged approximately ten, standing with his parents. They were all smiling and waving. A day in Brighton, it looked like. A magical universe since the photo moved. Something about the photo wasn't quite right, but Harry couldn't pinpoint it.
Draco was immediately incandescent and turned around and stopped to look at Harry. His jaw clenched and his posture straightened even further like he meant to make the most of the few inches he had on Harry.
“Passed what?” Harry said, irritably. He had let Draco side-along him to a farther apparition point since the weather was still nice enough to walk.
Hermione and Draco spoke privately in the front room for a long hour. When Hermione left, Draco seemed to have realized something. His face was stony, remote.
"Athena has always thought I’m looking for a substitute for Dorcas. No one in the world could be Dorcas. Athena’s brilliant in her own right. I don’t know why I keep trying.” Kingsley sighed heavily.
“I’ll sleep when I’m dead,” Hermione said breezily. Harry glared at her.
"Can we go get lunch before the Ministry? I'm starved. I forgot to eat breakfast."
Draco apparates away.
“Gregory Goyle came to visit. We had a slight political disagreement,” Draco said.
Usually they spoke during sex, but this last time had been silent except for the occasional loud gasp or bitten off moan. There was no negotiation, just the language of long looks and nods. In the hallway to the stairs, Harry had undone the buttons on Draco’s trousers, pulled them down. Sometimes he wondered if everything he liked was what Draco taught him to like. But Harry didn’t want anything to be routine, so he’d turned Draco to face the wall, made Draco hold himself open and ate him out slowly until he could tell Draco was almost there by the fine trembling of his legs. He pulled back. Draco almost sobbed. Harry had never wanted anyone more.
“Whatever test you’ve set for me,” Draco said. He was holding his arms tight to his body and walking fast. Harry took longer strides, trying to catch up. Draco must be part gazelle or something.
“I packed them in your work bag,” Harry said.
"You're quite right. I should call over Basil, he'll be interested," Mrs Thiessen mused. “Basil!”
“We are disappointed,” Molly sniffed. “But we know it’s for the best. You will come on Saturdays, won’t you, Harry?”
“Er...no,” Harry said.
Draco always waited for the last person to leave. Less opportunity for him to be accidentally tripped or shoved then.
“They’ve let me know that may not be possible with my record,” Draco said flatly after a long moment.
“They like you.” Harry said. Draco seemed to accept that.
“Take responsibility. But remember that you went through things yourself and you also have to deal with that,” she would tell him. “You know, you can take a potion for the sleep issues. They are not habit forming, and I think it would help you function better. If you ever want to try.”
It was like the whole universe righted itself at once. Draco’s kisses were indulgent and searching. His mouth tasted tart and sweet like he had been eating lemon drops seconds before. His hair was silky underneath his palm. Harry realized he could easily flip Draco, as he had the strength advantage if not the height advantage. But he liked being pinned beneath Draco’s weight, at his mercy, as Draco kissed him over and over.
“I can write the letter for you. And they should accept you if I write it. It’s at least something,” Harry said.  If Draco let his pride rule him, he would have strode back into Diagon Alley. But this time, practicality stayed his hand. His heart picked up tempo a little. A letter from Harry Potter would mean something to the Board.
Harry gently knocked his hand away and tied it himself. It was navy blue and Harry had been surprised he owned anything that wasn’t green, grey or silver. His shirt was a pressed white button down and he wore grey dress trousers.
Harry reminded himself that sitting here instead of receiving a slip was a sign of favour, and he was wasting it. He swallowed the rest of his reflexive contrariness.
Once, he manages to corner Draco after a department-wide briefing but as he approaches, Draco shakes his head subtly. Harry feels hurt but he changes directions and goes back to his desk by a long, circuitous route.
“His father told him to cast me aside and find another pureblood woman who could bear him children. At the time, Lucius would have had the right to break our marriage contract. Abraxas even told him to take a mistress if he insisted on keeping me in the house. That would have been acceptable too,” she said.
“The Department has cleared me,” Draco said conversationally after a long pause.
Hermione looked down at her Firebird.
Back at Grimmauld, it was quiet. Too quiet. Despite the disquieting silence, Harry almost didn’t want to leave again. One universe was enough for one day. He could contact Hermione and tell her he couldn’t handle this after all. He could spend the rest of his summer hiking, and out of London.
“We should strip your magic now.” The first one was taller. He held a tarnished silver filigree pocket watch that felt familiar. Even though he couldn’t access the memory of that feeling with his shields in place, he knew it was bad. The first one bent and held the pocket watch to him and Draco felt a violent pulling worse than any Cruciatus curse.
The next day he jumped wearily into the next world. It seemed normal enough on the surface.
“Fine, then. Let me get to know you. Come to bed, we’ll talk in the morning,” Harry said. Draco looked so tired all of the sudden. He was still dressed up in Harry’s Quidditch joggers that were too short and a plain t-shirt Harry had lying around.
“We thought it only had to do with muggleborns and Dark objects. But it doesn’t make sense because that’s not all they are doing,” Harry exclaimed.
A witch shrugs. “Quebec.”
Harry expected to dream of the war. However, this was unfamiliar and unsettling. He couldn’t remember a single dream that vivid in years. He laid awake until it seemed ridiculous not to get up and do something else. Candles lit as he walked down the hall and down the stairs.
“We’re not. It’s a choice,” Harry said. He could sense the tenseness in the air, an argument that had been coming for days now.
“What a stupid question.”
“Something like that, yes. I’m trying to find someone,” Harry said. It felt easier to stick close to the truth. Draco made a listening noise, tapping his cigarette on an ashtray balanced on the bannister. It was like Draco was waiting for Harry to ask something in particular, but Harry wasn’t sure what it could be.
He should be worried or scared, but the last two years had burned both emotions out of his blood entirely. All Draco felt was vaguely sick to his stomach and numb. He didn’t look up as they walked him into court but stared at the stone floor.
“The new object we found means they could make new Dark objects with those accumulated magics,” Zacharias said.
“You’re Michael’s friend, Harry, aren’t you?” a woman asks. Harry nods. She's very pretty and around his age. She has thick, dark curly hair, and wears a pristine blue sundress with cheap black flip flops. Harry finds the contrast interesting.
Draco was stretched above him lit by the moonlight from Harry's window. He was even paler than Harry had imagined.  And he had in great detail. Now he knew exactly how he looked, from the dip of his hip, to a sprinkling of freckles and light blond hair on his chest and exactly what few childhood scars Draco had left after having erased most of the rest of the war from his body. The black solid band wrapped around his left forearm in contrast.
“What did Blaise say to you?” Draco said, still curious, mind working over the possibilities.
"We'll take the Floo back."
“I’ll be back. Of course, I’ll be back,” Draco said, leaning down to give him a peck. His eyes searched Harry’s face. “I...I wouldn’t stay out there, you know. I don’t think I could.”
"Essentially, yes."
“He’s alive?” Harry asked.
It is three months on the dot when Draco pops up in their former shared office again.
“Then we’ll deal with it. But I don’t want to hear that kind of talk again,” Harry said.
started? What are we doing?" Harry asks.
Harry reached around his neck and took off his Firebird and put it on the desk. He also showed Draco his empty wand holster, rolling up his sleeves. Harry took off his glasses too; Draco must know by now he couldn’t see much without them.
“What?” Harry said.
“Something for headaches?” Harry ventured.
“Er...” Harry said.
Draco and his mother had decided to hold the memorial within a week. Pansy and Theodore both sent over their house-elves to prepare the Manor for visitors. Nothing could be done about the general state of disrepair. There was no money to be re-staining floors and replacing sconces. Between his tuition and his reparation payments, they were lucky to have held onto the Manor at all.
“I’ll pay you to talk, this once,” Harry said. He sat heavily on the bed since there was nowhere else to sit, and Draco opened the balcony doors and stood. Was that the Eiffel Tower in the distance?
“I didn’t mean it that way. No, sir.”
“You’ve done the right thing and still they treat you poorly. It’s not fair,” Harry said, indignant. He almost forgot he was playing a part.
“You know Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna. They like you fine,” Harry said.
“Why?” Harry asked, dreading her answer.
"Why do you still have all your scars?" A deeply personal question, but it had been bothering him. Harry had the money to take them away.
"It was just a joke,” Harry said.
"Will you be alright at home alone?" Harry says. His expression is so sweetly concerned. Draco can deal with that. He can't deal with Harry rubbing his thumb on Draco's wrist in a public hallway where anyone could see. He looks the way he did before Draco kissed him in the Ministry basement. Expectant and shockingly open.
Harry nodded.
“It’s fine,” Harry said. The key to the garden turned up in the kitchen on a hook that Harry didn’t think he’d seen before. But it worried him and he kept an eye on Draco. Draco was avoiding using his wand, Harry was certain.
He wore long khakis and a long shirt with an obvious holster for his wand. Thank fucking Merlin. He didn’t think he could cope again without magic and in a strange place. Also, he was certain he had cast a cooling charm inside his clothes.
“I’ll tell him.” Harry had a flashback to Remus telling him how difficult Wolfsbane had been to brew as Draco handed over the package.
“Absolutely not.”
“You’re a dictator,” Draco said.
He knew them all. Tried not to stare as Pansy Parkinson swept past in a dramatic black gown and Adrian Pucey after her. He received a small smile from Luna Lovegood, whose silvery grey gown was laden with tassels and bells too, if the faint tinkling was any sign.
"Fuck. Is that what you think happened?" Draco says. His expression is pinched. "I was protecting our jobs. The only thing that stood between us both getting fired was Healer-patient confidentiality. We should have reported it the first time we..." He turns a little pink.
"We can't be up all night," Draco tried to sound composed and failed.
Instead they are in the broad daylight of a hospital with a witness and the astringent scent of antiseptic potions stinging his nose. Draco's already tapping his foot impatiently as if he'd rather not waste time.
“Maybe I should have. Get. Out.”
“I rather thought you’d fuck me,” Draco says breathily. Harry has to stop so that he doesn't forget what this is, how this goes. Harry needs to stop cataloguing what has changed and what hasn't. This is probably going to wreck him for good this time. There’s something to be said for going into this with his eyes open.
Harry tensed for an argument, but the twins laughed loudly.
the way he wanted while looking at Hitwizard Warbeck in a long time. He gathered his wits about him.
“This can be real if you want it to be,” Harry said instead.
“Also, I hit him with a stunner and it...didn’t hit him.” Draco said. “I didn’t miss. It was like he absorbed it.” Harry sat up. Hitting someone with three stunners was a little more than reasonable force, so he was going to decline to admit that to an officer of the law.
"I already put in the paperwork last evening." He is being pragmatic, Draco tells himself. There are rules. Harry will be fine in the long run.
Harry picked Draco up in a fireman’s carry and ran. He was running practically blind for the edge of the property that wasn’t covered under the giant hexed security bubble they had generated with their magic. It was a kilometre or so away.
“And this is what, exhuming the bodies?” Harry jokes. Some of the tension leeches from Draco’s shoulders.
“Be careful with him,” Healer Cummins said. But while Harry tried to gently wrap his arms around him, Draco was the one who crushed him to his chest. Harry tried to come up with any words to sum up how he felt.
“I am,” Ginny said. “Cheers.” They clinked glasses.
“I was thinking that there are universes where we’ve done this before.” Draco offered him a small private smile.
“Yes. Sorry.” He passed one extra champagne flute back to the waiter and held one out to Hermione. He could see her deciding whether it was rude to refuse before gripping it tightly.
“Yes,” Draco answered. He didn’t want to say much, but he didn’t want Harry to strand him in this maze, especially when he felt like the walls were closing in.
“Haven’t eaten all day. Sorry, bad habit,” Harry shrugged.
Draco waited what seemed like an eternity.
“Were you in the Healer interviews?” Harry asked, turning back. On top of it all, Harry seemed so uncomplicatedly kind. It made Draco want to hide. What was his fucking angle?
"Fuck," Harry agreed.
“Was that Harry Potter coming from your bedroom?” Narcissa said, raising an eyebrow.
“Why do you think that was important to tell me?” She asked. Her cardigan today was a sunshine yellow with a tiny smiling cartoon dog pin.
“I should leave,” Draco said. They walked slowly back towards the kitchen. Then it occurred to Harry that he was missing some key information.
As if he was allergic to sincerity, Draco immediately pushed his plate towards Harry and he looked at Harry expectantly. They both had about a quarter of their plate left which was surprising because Harry hadn’t even noticed Draco eating at all.
“Drake, my name is Eustace,” His new boss said a few days later.
“For fuck’s sake, at this rate we’ll never reach the Pyramid before dusk. Move it!”
"I'll make this good for you," Harry says. His voice is low, and sweet. When he gazes at Draco through his lashes it makes it seem like Harry wants this and that's wishful thinking on Draco's part. So Draco closes his eyes, gives himself over to Harry's mouth and comes an embarrassingly short time later.
“She’s his Senior Policy Advisor on Justice and Security. We’re guessing that’s where the leak came from,” Athena explained. Well, he knew she’d hated Hermione Granger, but wasn’t joining a terrorist group a bit much?
“I don’t have any names that would help you, ” Draco continued. Harry was rather impassive. It was impossible to know what he was thinking. Harry kept those green eyes trained on him like he wanted something but hadn’t decided what.
