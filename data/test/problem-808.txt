Harry reread the letter in shock, staring at the page. He looked up at Draco staring at him nervously, and tried to give him a reassuring smile, but with too much teeth showing it came out more like a grimace.
Astoria looked at Harry’s letter sitting on Draco’s desk accusatorily, “You promise that now, when you’re still hurt and angry. But what happens in a year? Or five years? Or 10 years when the children are young and fighting and you’re missing your quiet peaceful life with him? I’d much rather have the rules laid out in our marriage contract now than have to fight about this later when we’re already married.”
“Any clue what the raid is about?” Harry asked Claire as they sped down the corridor to the largest of the Auror’s conference rooms.
“What the fuck are you talking about Harry?” Draco asked, momentarily forgetting about the night before.
Harry waved a cleaning charm over both of them before snuggling against Draco, resting his chin against Draco’s chest, “Move back in.” He said simply after they’d both caught their breath.
“To kill Harry Fucking Potter.” Draco threw the powder into the grate and called out Harry’s address, stepping in without bothering to brush his hair or grab his wand.
Narcissa laughed before swatting at her son, “There’s my vicious dragon. In some cultures children have respect for their parents.”
“He’s not nearly as bad since the war ended. Didn’t even try to hex me when you told him we’d been sleeping together.”
Draco shot Harry an incredulous look before returning to his shower, ignoring Harry as completely as he could.
“Father,” Draco glared, “I’m not going to stoop to poisoning my old lovers no matter how annoying they act”
"You can't possibly think he's up to something again," Ron groaned with a roll of his eyes as he began loading his plate full of food.
Ginny gave a mocking gasp, “they wouldn't dare! If they try it, give Ron graveyard shifts for a month.”
Harry sighed, "Well, he's always in a mood when I'm around so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do."
Harry walked up behind Draco nervously, before putting his hand on his shoulder. “We need to get out of here. Whoever set this fire, they could come back. We need to get somewhere safe.” Harry tried to sound strong but he was anxious to get his charge out of the open and into a shelter.
Draco gave Harry an off look, “She’s one of the leaders of the group. That’s how I learned about what was happening.”
Harry was completely confident in his plan up until the moment he put his bag down on the other side of Malfoy's table.
Draco’s smile grew, and he offered out a hand to Harry, “Alright, I’ll get you a second drink but we need to go out into the living room like civilized folks.”
at Hogwarts. It appears there is a group of wizards targeting muggle-borns and their families before they can be informed they are wizards. In the past week an informant has given us credible information tying these cases together, and given us names of some of the people involved. We have just received news that they are planning another attack tonight near Wales, and we are going to prevent it.”
Harry walked over to the couch, sitting down hard upon it. His brain kept processing the word 'pregnant' over and over again, like it would suddenly have a new meaning.
“If you are sure Draco, we will do our best to arrange it.” Narcissa smiled delicately “but are you so ready to give up on love?”
“Merlin Astoria, I’m not going to go crawling back to Harry. And what of you? Do I have to worry that you’ll grow bored of being settled down and will miss your muggle adventure partner?” Draco asked angrily.
Harry sat there confused, not following the conversation at all. “We’ll keep you safe Malfoy. You don’t… You’d give up your name?”
Harry let out a dry chuckle, "Thanks. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure I'll love this new baby. It's just…“ He trailed off, lost for an explanation.
Harry thought back to the previous day, the anger he’d felt at Ginny and everything he’d done with Draco. He knew he had crossed a line that his marriage couldn’t recover from. He looked up at Ron though, who was watching him intently, and knew he couldn’t tell Ron any of it.
Draco looked up at Harry and glared, "There's no need, remember? You've discovered I'm not some damsel in need of saving, and you can go back to pretending I don't exist."
Lily was a fussy baby, there was no doubt about it. She seemed to not believe in sleep, and would wake up every half hour crying. Harry and Ginny would trade off on halves of the night so each got at least 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. Molly continued to watch the boys each day so Harry and Ginny could try to get naps in.
On their first anniversary Draco had planned out a romantic proposal, down on one knee with a fireworks show that would go off in the background. During dinner though, Harry and Draco had argued; Harry once again had wanted to go somewhere muggle where they wouldn’t get spotted and Draco had been frustrated by feeling like their relationship was a secret from everyone except their closest friends. Though the fight had ended, Draco had felt it would be best to wait to propose until Harry was finally ready to let the world know about their relationship. He clutched the ring in his finger, filled with regret.
"Well. It's the law. Marriage was originally created to give Wizards a way of passing their wealth onto their own flesh and blood, and it wouldn't make sense to allow a divorce during a pregnancy with that frame of reference." Draco explained before growing quiet for a moment, then he raised his arms in a quick shrug, "Though what do I know? I've been trapped in this house for 5 million years, the laws have probably changed."
The Auror looked at Draco with pity “We don’t know. We’re sorry, but we don’t know. We have our top potions master working on it right now, and a whole crew of Aurors trying to break the suspects. As soon as we know more we’ll let you know.”
“You’d think you’d be more concerened on what sort of emergency would need you here instead of pretending I’m the one that doesn’t care.”
“Hey little one. What's the matter?” Harry soothed as he pulled Scorpius into his arms. A quick charm and Scorpius was in a clean diaper, and Harry carried him downstairs for breakfast. “I think your father must have overslept.”
Draco stood up, stretching his arms up over his head and leaning, exposing a small piece of flesh on his left side where his shirt rose above his trousers, “right then, I’m just going to go back to the bedroom for a while. Engage in some stress relief. Do be sure to call me once dinner’s ready.”
Draco snorted, "I'm no labor law expert, but I don't think they'd have a case against you with all those mandatory break periods you've been unable to take over the past month."
Draco smiled sadly, “I’m not sure. Can we try going out tonight as just friends? I’m still not sure how I’m feeling about…” Draco gestured hopelessly, “well, about anything really.”
After another two weeks in the safehouse, Harry was worried that Draco was going to go insane. It was obvious that the Aurors were no closer to finding Astoria and Scorpius, and Draco was forgoing sleep and meals to pace back and forth trying to think of clues that could help the Aurors find them. He’d made lists of every witch or wizard he knew with any sort of connection to Astoria, and all of their known vacation homes. Harry didn’t think that Draco was likely going to uncover any information that the Aurors didn’t already have, but he had hoped the project would help Draco feel like they were making some progress. Draco had turned the hallway wall into a giant chart, plotting where Astoria had last been tracked to and speculating on who might be helping her. This had continued for days when Harry was suddenly alarmed to hear a screech come from the hallway.
Harry shoved his glasses onto his face and looked up at Hermione’s voice, but it was like he didn’t see her at all, just saw past her to the mop of golden hair behind her. “Draco” Harry whispered.
Harry nodded, walking into the kitchen and pulling out a frozen meal from the freezer. Quickly, he spelled it ready and served it up into two plates, levitating them over to the dinner table.
Draco stood up, fire dancing in his eyes, “Then go marry him. You’re under no requirement to marry me, go marry him and live your life.”
Harry pulled out his wand and approached the desk in the side of the room, grabbing a quill and parchment and penning a quick note before folding it and placing it in the bin labeled “out”.
Draco smiled, “You want to clear your mind. Breath. Just inhale in, and exhale out. Let go of everything else and focus on your breathing.”
“It's for my Patronus. We…. Well we may have had a few shots of firewhiskey in us before we picked our codenames for a training exercise in the academy… They just stuck.” Harry stammered, slightly embarrassed.
Draco looked at Hermione before speaking, “I’d prefer it if these two were here actually. They’re his friends.”
Harry looked thoughtfully at Blaise for a moment before nodding. “Right. Thanks for that.” Harry said before taking off after Draco with a sprint.
Harry nodded her way before turning back to Draco. He waited until Hermione had left before starting, “I’ve missed you, Draco. I’m so sorry about everything that happened, but please know I would never willingly put you through that. I love you.”
Draco threw some bills on the table “Terribly sorry, I just remembered I have a meeting starting in a few minutes. Nice seeing you all again.” He said coldly before standing and making his way out the door.
Draco headed off to the shops, getting the things he needed for his new place and then came home to arrange his flat. By Saturday afternoon he was feeling collected enough to fire call his parents and inform them of his new living situation, expertly brushing off their questions and promising to come by the following Friday for dinner. When brunch on Sunday arrived Draco was able to talk about the breakup without his voice breaking. By Monday, Draco’s calm and collected mask was finally firmly in place, and he was ready to plow on with his new life.
“Alrighty,” Hermione said briskly, “you two look like you've been at war. Molly has the boys and she's keeping them and Rose overnight, and I'm taking this little cutie home with me.” She reached into Lily's bassinet, clutching the wailing infant close to her and cooing softly. Quickly she started summoning things and stuffing them in her bag. “What a healthy set of lungs this little one has. Now, you two get some sleep, we'll be back in the morning.”
An hour later and the empty bottle of scotch sat on the coffee table in front of Harry and Draco, who were sprawled haphazardly across the couch. Draco wasn’t sure how they had ended up in the position that they were in, but he was much too comfortable to move. He was sitting on the side of the couch, body up against the armrest with his feet up on the long edge of the couch, his blonde hair splayed against the back of the couch. Harry rested sideways on the couch, his legs hanging over the other arm rest and his body laying back taking up a full two cushions, and head rested gently on Draco’s thigh. When Potter had first flopped down Draco had tried to push his head off, but instead Draco found his hand gently petting through Potter’s dark hair; it was softer than he had thought it would be.
Draco deadpanned towards his mom, his voice like ice, “I didn’t know you had company Mother. This can easily wait for another time.”
Draco rolled his eyes as he finished Harry’s letter. “Just like the prat to turn a simple letter about Teddy into a chance to reminisce about us” he thought.
Harry put the letter down with a sigh. Ten days. A week ago the house elf had sent them fresh clothes and books, but Harry had never imagined that they’d be trapped together for ten days. On their second night in the house Harry had transfigured the large king-size bed into two full-sized beds, which he begrudgingly thought wasn’t as comfortable as that first night where he’d accidently cuddled with Draco.
Harry crawled along the bed to where Draco was sitting, coming up behind him and wrapping him in a hug. Harry dropped his mouth to Draco’s ear, “I’ll wait for you, for as long as you need.” He swore.
The waiter brought Draco a menu and Daphne and Pansy chattered quietly in the background as Draco decided what to order. Draco noticed Adrian kept staring at Draco, and it was making Draco quite nervous. Though they had played Quidditch together for a few years back at Hogwarts, Adrian was not someone Draco would normally sit down and have lunch with.
Ginny summoned a bottle of wine and some glasses and the two overfilled their drinks. “To our family!” Ginny saluted, raising her glass to Harry’s.
Narcissa frowned at her son before chastising him, “Harry and I have a bond that goes far past your two’s relationship. I saved his life once, and he saved the most precious thing in the world to me. If he would like to come over for tea he is always welcome.” Standing and walking towards the study, “Now since you’re here you can help me and your father figure out how to tip off the Prophet to the fact that you are not in fact going to marry Astoria.”
Ron and Hermione shared a long look before Ron just shrugged and changed the subject to discuss their newest Defense Against the Dark Arts project.
“It’s Nott Potter! Nott must be the one helping her.”  Draco said frantically, grasping Harry’s hand and drawing him closer to the chart. “Look at this, it’s the only information that makes sense. These dates, the ones where I know she was with her lover, he was one of the only pureblood male within twelve years of our age that I can never account for. He has business or homes in each of the countries she’s been tracked to. He’s always has a soft spot for her, they grew up together. He’s the only one who makes sense.”
Harry stood up, squaring his shoulders as he faced Draco, “Why are you so afraid to admit it?! You talk with me, help me raise my kids, trust me to help care for your kid, ask me about work, tell me stories from your childhood, play chess with me. We've seen each other at our most vulnerable, and cheered for the other one at their high points. You get jealous at the thought I could consider getting back with my ex-wife, which is ridiculous because she tried to touch me and all I could think was how much I prefer your touch! This is what love looks like, Draco, and you're just afraid to admit it because if you do you might be tempted to stay!”
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco and frowned, “Andromeda was talking about me arranging a portkey to take Teddy to see them while they’re in France, apparently he has some distant cousins there that haven’t met him yet, and I was coordinating with you mom when the best time to plan that was.”
Harry felt the firm press of Draco’s erection against his own, and he bucked his hips up to gain friction. Draco quickly responded, firming his stance above Harry and rubbing their bodies together as they continued to kiss. Harry’s hands found themselves traveling lower, until his hands were firmly over Draco’s round buttocks. Draco moaned softly in Harry’s mouth before pulling back.
"Oh." Harry responded lamely. "I. Uh." Harry sat on a desk, lost for words. "I didn't mean for that to happen."
Harry walked over to the bookshelf, trying to see if there were any interesting books to read that he hadn’t read yet. As Harry was skimming through books, he heard a soft moan come from the bedroom. Harry froze a sharp bolt of arousal running through him.
“I will send it over first thing Monday morning.” Narcissa stopped for a moment and looked and Draco intently, “Please remember my dragon, you do not have to marry her. People pull out of negotiations all the time, you do not even need to have a reason. If this is not what you want to do just say the words and I promise we will put a stop to these proceedings. All your father and I want is for you to be happy.”
Harry laughed lightly, “No, you’ll be good. At least you’ll finally have someone who can beat you at chess.”
Draco stayed excited for the rest of the day, staring anxiously at the inbox hoping to see a letter from Ron. After dinner he pulled out a bottle of scotch and held it up to Harry expectantly, “Celebratory drink?” he asked jovially.
Draco sucked hard on Harry's tip, letting his tongue tease the opening of Harry's slit. Harry's hips jerked forward and he moaned.
“Incendio” Draco pointed his wand at a howler and watched the red paper burn, the sound of a voice screaming at him for hurting the beloved Harry Potter melting away. He opened his wards again and another fell out and began screaming, before Draco lit that one on fire too.
“That… That sucks Draco” Pansy leaned into him and wrapped him in a hug “Is there any chance of working things out?”
Harry walked Draco over to the bed, pulling down the covers and softly pushing Draco into the bed before answering, “I’m not sure, but you need to try to get some sleep. You need to stay strong for him right now. He’s with his mother, and the Aurors are going to find him… and when they do he’s going to need you to be okay. So get some sleep.”
Astoria’s face steeled over, “It’s a tradition. On my mother’s side. She passed away when I was young, but I’d still like to honor her traditions. Are you really opposed to having two children? How many had you wanted?”
“Why are you so ready to get married now, when you never thought about marrying me?” Harry asked glumly.
Draco just looked blankly back at Harry, his expression lifeless with no indication he had heard what Harry said. Harry pulled a small ring out of his pocket, which he tapped with his wand to expand to the size of a Frisbee. “This is a portkey. When I activate this, it’s going to take us to a safehouse. The secret-keeper is a house-elf for the ministry, but none of the Auror’s know where the safehouse is. Even we won’t know. Even if the ministry has been compromised, you’ll be safe there. Once you’re safe I can contact some people and try and figure out what’s going on, but first I need to make sure you’re safe. I need you to grab onto the portkey and hold on tight, okay?” Harry recognized that Draco was in shock, and tried to make his voice as steady and calming as he could. “Draco,” the name felt weird on Harry’s mouth, after almost twenty years of calling him Malfoy, “I need you to grab the portkey.”
, but the more Harry had stared at Draco the less that either of those had meant. Though Harry wasn’t sure exactly where he stood on attraction to all men, after his dreams the past couple of nights he could confidently say that he was at least attracted to Draco. He felt like a cad, he’d left his wife and children for work one evening and now it had been over a month and he hadn’t come home and he was having to remind himself to not molest the man he was in charge of keeping safe.
Harry followed meekly, his stomach queasy. When he reached the kitchen Ginny was waving her wand, sending clean dishes to be put away with clangs and bangs and then slamming cabinet doors behind her. As Harry gingerly walked into the room she rounded on him, her eyes shining with tears.
“I mean look at my fucking life Potter!” Draco angrily gestured to the sky, “I tried to be better. I married a girl whose family stayed out of the war. I was committed to raising my son better than I'd been raised. We were going to have a family, and raise a child to think that he wasn't any better than anyone else just because of his blood status. Then I find out, that lovely witch I married is part of an underground group hunting down muggle-borns before they get their Hogwarts letters and massacring their ENTIRE FAMILIES.”
Thank you all for reading! We are almost at the end. There's only two more chapters left! Thanks for sticking it out with me!
Harry nodded, "You too Malfoy. I'll see you soon. Let's have a drink at the three broomsticks tomorrow!"
Draco moaned again, snaking his hand down between them until he was stroking against Harry’s clothed erection. Draco sat up quickly, pulling his zipper down and fishing his hard cock out before reaching down and pulling down Harry’s zipper. He got both of their shafts out and rubbed them firmly together, making them both moan.
"-Oh, it's back to Malfoy is it? Probably for the best then." Draco said bitterly as he turned and walked faster, Theo lengthening his strides to keep up.
“You did do that to me Harry. The potion didn’t give you any new emotions, it just made you react to them. You still thought I was capable of orchestrating a witch hunt against your boyfriend and having him arrested on trumped up charges. You thought I didn’t care at all about you when we weren’t together.”
Walking through the floo at Grimmauld, Harry noted that the house was silent. Draco wasn't downstairs, and Harry felt a moment of panic before he saw a flash of blond hair out the back window.
“The problem is, we’re not sure exactly what was in the potion. We’ve got samples, but the suspects aren’t cooperating and it appears they were working on some dangerous things.”
Harry and Claire apparated behind a tree at the back of quiet muggle neighborhood a quarter after ten, kneeling on the ground and disillusioning themselves to await the signal to move in. Harry watched Claire anxiously, this was her first large raid and her initial excitement had faded quickly to apprehension.
“Of course! Why wouldn’t I take my mate out for a pint when he’s just agreed to get betrothed to a girl he’s known for less than a week?” Ron smiled cheekily as he slapped Draco on the back.
Harry sat there awkwardly for a moment, looking at Draco in shock before asking, “Oh… does this lover have a name?”
“Draco! So lovely to see you” Narcissa wrapped her son into a light hug, and kissed him on the cheek.
“Well?” Draco demanded, his eyes bright with more hope than Harry had seen since they’d first gotten to the safehouse, “What are you waiting for? This is the answer! Aren’t you going to go and write to the team? Tell them you’ve figured it out?” Draco’s voice was raising, his clutch on Harry tightened, “They’ll put surveillance on Theo right? They’ll find Scorpius? I’ll get my son back?” His voice lowed, his last question barely a whisper.
“Wonderful. Please give her my deepest regards and tell her I’ll pick her up at 6.” Draco smiled cheerfully and headed to the floo, feeling the knot in his shoulders that had begun to form that morning slowly disappearing.
Harry turned to Draco, concern etched clearly on his face. "Malfoy, you're in shock, and you're exhausted. Let's draw you a bath so you can warm up, and I'll send in some tea."
Draco’s two weeks of vacation time ended abruptly Monday morning with a floo call from Head Barrister Krone’s assistant telling him he was needed in as soon as possible. Draco threw on some clothes and headed into the office, a feeling of dread firmly set in the pit of his stomach.
Harry moaned around Draco’s cock one last time before pulling up, “Not like this,” He panted, catching his breath, “I want you to come inside me.”
“Apparently not. Better not keep them waiting. Do you want me to come over again tonight? I can bring Blaise or Theo or Greg?”
“I don’t really think that’s your decision to make. She knows I don’t love her, and I know she doesn’t love me. We decided that doesn’t matter. Purebloods have been getting married for centuries without being in love, and I don’t see why this would be any different.” Draco stopped and then added as an afterthought “Besides, we like each other well enough, I’m sure we’ll come to love each other in time”.
Ginny looked like he'd slapped her, "OF BLOODY WELL COURSE IT'S YOURS YOU ABSOLUTE TOSSER." She screeched, "Who else's would it be? What sort of fucking slag do you think I am? I have been 100% faithful to you Harry." Ginny turned around, stomping into the kitchen.
Harry’s room was bright; stark white walls and ceiling on top of white linoleum. Harry sat at an incline in his bed, a light blanket pulled up to his chest, twirling his glasses in front of his face. He didn’t even bother to look up when Hermione and Draco first walked into the door, just continued fidgeting with his glasses while he said “I’m still feeling fine and you can let me leave anytime now.”
As Harry’s hand reached the hem of Draco’s shirt, Draco tried to flip around on top of Harry but over-reached his leg, rolling over Harry and pulling them both down off the couch onto the rug beneath. Draco’s head hit the floor and they both stopped for a moment, startled. After a few seconds, Harry reached his hand over to Draco and said dizzily, “Oof. I wasn’t expecting that. Are you… Are you alright?”
“Sounds lovely.” Draco squeezed her shoulder one last time and turned to walk into the bathroom to get ready.
As Harry flew down closer to where Draco was making his own circles, Harry spotted the snitch hovering mere feet off the ground, and leaned low on his broom to race to it. Almost immediately, Draco was right next to him, speeding along at break-neck speeds, where Harry could almost feel Draco's body heat radiating next to him. Harry scooted higher on his broom, trying to throw his body weight forward to get to the snitch faster.
Ginny closed her eyes, “You don't get it, do you? It hurts too much. Seeing you finally stepping up, putting the kids first like I'd asked you to before? It hurts. It makes me want to try to be a family again, and if I can't have that then I'm not sure I can take having you around every day.”
Blaise laughed lightly, "You know Potter, I may not give the best blowjobs in the world but I'd like to think they don't actually count as torture."
The third afternoon after the kiss, Draco and Harry were playing chess after lunch. Though chess was never Harry’s strong suit, at this point he’d lost three games already and wasn’t really sure why he had agreed to a fourth. He looked up and saw Draco’s face full of concentration, his brows furled and his grey eyes bright, and Harry knew exactly why he had agreed to play again. Draco worried his lower lip between his teeth as he tried to decide his next move, and Harry stared transfixed.
Harry set a quick monitoring charm on the boys and Draco raised his eyebrows. As soon as they were in the library Draco pulled Harry by the hips and pressed up against him.
“I wasn’t sure I was either. I needed some time to process everything”. Draco finally started to walk forward till he sat down in the chair next to Hermione.
Harry eyed Draco guiltily, "Listen. I'm sorry. I'll try and find out what's going on. Just have a cuppa and sit down and I'll let you know if I hear back."
Harry narrowed his eyes, "And one more thing Malfoy. If this whole thing was an elaborate trap planned by you, and my partner died for nothing, I’ll kill you myself."  Harry tightened his grip on Draco's arm, whisking him away in an apparition before he'd had a chance to respond.
What if he wasn’t? He could walk over to the desk, sign the papers, throw them in the outbox and go join Draco in the bedroom.
I've been trying to post 1 chapter per night but the next couple of chapters need to have some formatting fixed on them and a final  read-through done, and I somehow got roped into doing Yoga on Bicycles (Did anyone know that's a thing? Cause it seems super unsafe) tomorrow night and then kayaking the next two nights after that, so I don't think I'll be able to post them. On the bright side, if I survive the yoga biking (my expectations are very low) postings should resume on Friday and finish up early next week. Please let me know what you think so far! I might write an alternate ending depending on how people are feeling after this chapter.
“He is. We took him in early this morning. He was acting crazy last night by the time I got home, pacing and muttering and just overall paranoid. I know he hasn’t been himself lately, but this was insane. We couldn’t calm him down at all, finally had to incarcerous him and take him in. He was sent to the mind healers at first, but they took him down to potions and plant poisoning. They haven’t been able to tell us what’s going on, but they said they needed you here as soon as possible. They apparently tried to owl you but your wards wouldn’t let them though.”
"Have you two noticed anything odd lately, about Malfoy?" Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they sat down to lunch.
Harry snorted, “I don’t mind. No.” He gripped Draco’s waist tighter, pulling their bodies tight. His hand came up Draco’s side to the back of his head. He clutched into Draco’s hair, pulling him into a rough kiss. He was intoxicated with just the scent of Draco against him, needing to feel him.
Draco snorted, “Speak for yourself there Potter. Just because I married a woman doesn’t mean I have any interest in them. Though let’s be honest, I don’t think that you would have reacted the way you did last night if you weren’t at least a little bent too. And as for who we are, we’ve both grown up, I’m not the same teenage death eater that you knew, and you’re not nearly as annoying of a git as you were. And the only reason I’m still married is because my wife ran off, I have every intention of filing for divorce as soon as I’m not holed up in a safe house with you waiting daily to find out if my child is still alive, and your wife sent you divorce papers. Your job is the only possible reason this could be a bad idea, and I’ll tell you what, if you’re that morally opposed to doing something unethical with your job, I promise that as soon as we’re done being imprisoned here you can tell them you can’t protect me anymore. Problems solved.”
Harry's heart soared as he and Draco faced off on their brooms. The familiar adrenaline raced through Harry's blood as he let his competitive side take over. The two of them had always been able to fly circles around each other, both hyper aware of the other's position in a way they just
There was another letter from Head Auror Robards, giving most of the same information as Ron’s letter, but as an official command. Harry read it over briefly before turning his attention to the letter from Ginny which had come with Ron’s letter.
“Hey. You look amazing.” Harry said, handing Draco the box of chocolate as he walked into the flat. Harry looked around, eyeing the style and missing the sophisticated grace Draco’s taste had added to their shared apartment.
“Draco. You deserve more than a wife who’s with you because you’re rich. I’m not saying don’t marry her mate, I’m just saying talk to her.”
“You expected us to find you a bride in three days Draco?” Lucius asked with a laugh “Were you hoping to be married by the weekend?”
Harry heard a brief pop right after he landed, and saw Claire staring at Draco happily before putting out her hand, “Auror Claire Sparks at your service sir, and I believe you’ve met my partner Auror Potter. It looks like we got you out as planned, and as soon as we receive a floo call that they’re ready we can floo to the ministry. In the mean-time, have a seat. Would you like any tea?”
Draco took a sip of his scotch, steeling himself, "Go home Potter. You need to sort your family out."
“Not yet, but we’ll get to know each other in time.” Draco muttered defensively “I know I can tolerate being around her, I know that she’s been raised to follow the same traditions as me. I know that she’s got enough decorum that I doubt she’ll ever spill a bunch of one sided drabble to the press. We’ll come to love each other, just like thousands of witches and wizards have done before us.”
Draco startled and began to pull his head back before making contact with Harry’s green eyes, “I want this.” He choked.
Harry's stomach sank, "I know. We need to. I'd like to go spend a bit of time with the boys, but then yeah, let's talk."
Being around Draco wasn’t as awful as Harry would have imagined it to be. Though neither were good company, Harry was proud that they were both getting along fairly well. They squabbled and had minor disagreements, but it was obvious that they’d both grown up from their schoolboy ways.
Draco rolled his hips against Harry’s, eliciting another groan before stopping and moving his mouth to Harry’s ear, “I asked you a question.”
Harry hesitated, “Well. Sort of. You won’t have to stay in a safe house but you’d have to stay in the United Kingdom. Until Astoria’s been found guilty and you’ve filed the custody case.”
“That’s not exactly word for word, but you seem pretty amazing to me.” Draco smiled down at her indulgently.
Harry awoke the next morning with a splitting headache, the artificial light from the hallway seemed so bright under the bedroom door that he thought it might blind him. He rolled over and groped for his wand, casting a tempus and seeing that it was nearly noon. Carefully, Harry sat up, feeling his stomach rebel with every movement he made. His tongue felt like sandpaper, but the thought of drinking water made Harry even queasier than he already felt.
“Fine, but you’re pouring.” Harry said before he grabbed onto Draco’s hand and allowed himself to be pulled up, his hand lingering after he righted himself.
Harry started at Draco in horror, all thoughts of sleep pushed firmly from his mind “Draco, I'm so sorry,” he started, but faltered unsure of what to say next. Instead of speaking, Harry scooted closer to Draco, pulling Draco against his shoulder in what he hoped was a soothing manor.
“Draco” Pansy started gently after a minute, “We just want to see both of you happy. I know that right now this seems like a good decision but I really don’t want to see you two make a rash choice that you’re going to regret later on.”
Harry laughed derisively, “I’m sure Gin will be very relieved to know that I threw away my wedding vows on something that didn’t mean anything.”
Harry nodded, checking to see how much time he had left before the portkey took him home. “How’re Gin and the boys?”
Draco hummed as he took Harry down his throat, reveling in the heat of Harry's erection. Draco put his hands on Harry's hips, pulling Harry further down until Draco's lips were pressed against Harry's soft curls.
Draco glared at Harry, “Maybe I want to just be a friendly bloke that can smile at people on the street? Maybe I want to have a career where whenever I express a dissenting opinion no one says ‘Oh look, you’ve upset the Death Eater?!’ Maybe I just want to be able to fall in love with someone I want to fall in love with, instead of marrying a pureblood witch who my parents arranged for me to marry in order to have a pureblood baby and be miserable knowing that my wife is a murderous, adulterous nut job and I never wanted to be with her in the first place!”
“Draco. Please.” Hermione pleaded “You need to hear this, and then you need to go see Harry. He’s distraught, and he needs you. I don’t care how confused you are Draco, Harry needs you and you’re going to come with me even if I have you put you in a full body bind and levitate you through that floo.”
“Wonderful” Kathryn shot Draco a large smile, her eyes twinkling. “You might want to bring your boss with you for the meeting, I have a feeling he’ll want to act on this news immediately.”
Draco gave Harry a sad look, “But what if they don’t? At what point do they decide they need their best teams elsewhere? That they can’t have their top Auror holed up in a house with his childhood rival? That they can’t have their top teams out chasing a 24 year old woman and her infant son and instead need them solving crimes?”
“I’ve missed you every moment we’ve been apart Harry, every day. I’ve loved you every second of every day; from the very first kiss I’ve been entirely yours.” Draco’s voice started to break and he took another deep breath “I’m sorry it wasn’t enough for you. I’ll send a house-elf for my things”
Harry exhaled softly before trying to return Draco's smile, though he worried it came out more as a grimace. "Morning. How was your week?"
Ron Weasley’s voice penetrated Draco’s deliberate concentration “Ya know Draco, Nothing says let’s celebrate this engagement quite like spending hours lighting things on fire”
Draco looked like he'd been punched in the gut. “You're drunk,” he said stiffly, “You don't know what you're saying. I…. I need to get out of here. I need a walk.”
Draco sighed heavily, “When I came home after my case, I caught you having sex with Jacob. I was hurt, and I was angry, but I wanted to work things out. You told me you’d been planning on breaking up with me because I didn’t have time for you, and you felt like I didn’t miss you when we weren’t together.”
Draco leaned forward, his mouth close enough that Harry could feel his breath escape, “I’m glad you’ve found something to amuse yourself with.”
“Don’t be silly Draco, I was just speaking with Harry about Andy and mine’s upcoming trip. Take a seat and I’ll go and get the house elves to make us some tea.”
Harry smiled softly, “You didn’t ask. I’m offering. Honestly, I’m used to having you around. Plus, there’s more room there. More freedom to do what you want through the day, less confining than here. You wouldn’t have to worry about strange Aurors coming and going each week.” Harry grew more confident, his voice getting louder. “I mean. If you want to stay here you can stay here, that’s fine. But if you don’t want to stay here, but you want to stay somewhere safe… come home with me.”
“I was hoping you two could help with that actually. Put out some feelers, find me a suitable spouse like you always used to plan to do.”
Draco nodded, taking in the information. “Well. Hopefully you won’t have to. Thank you, for everything. Enjoy the time with your boys.” Draco said mechanically.
Harry hesitated, “Well. Not right away. You’ll be here through the trial. But after the trial they’ll give you that new identity if you still want it.”
Only four months out of the academy, Claire still had a drive to want to complete everything, and by now paperwork was taking her about half the time it took Harry. He considered going over to her desk to see how she had managed to write a two page report on “Mom files missing person’s report on her child, after forgetting to pick him up from his grandparents and wasting an entire morning for nothing.” It’s not that Harry couldn’t write the report, it was just that he doubted Robards was appreciating just how often the word ‘moron’ was appearing in his paperwork lately.
“Thank you for taking such great care of them. It was so hard to have them be sick and not be able to comfort them.”
Draco didn’t say anything for a moment, swallowing harshly before saying, “It’s not that. It’s yours… I had just assumed you stopped wearing it after,” he stopped, realizing this Harry didn’t know about the watch, or what used to be housed inside of it, “After something that happened while you were drugged.”
“Ginny,” Harry tried to be placating, but he knew his tone was too rough, “I didn't mean to upset you. I just mean I think too much has passed for us to just go back to how we were. I still love you, but I think once we're both working again the fighting will start again. I can't go through that again. But that doesn't mean I don't want to be here now, taking care of the kids.”
“Hermione! They just said they’ve tried everything else already. They wouldn’t be asking to do this if they didn’t think it could heal them. Just let them do their jobs.” Draco turned to the healer before him “What do you need me to sign?”
Draco laughed lightly, "No. all bruises were created in pursuit of a good time..." Draco's smile melted away and his tone turned cold, "So is that why you've been following me around and inviting me to do things with you?"
Pansy had worked her special kind of magic and somehow found Draco a flat matching his entire wish list. The flat was furnished, mostly with his own furnishing retrieved by house elf, but supplemented by rented furniture and decorations until he had a chance to go shopping. Pansy had even thought ahead and ordered food for dinner and had breakfast supplies in the fridge. After a quick tour Pansy summoned a bottle of wine to the couch and sat down with a flourish.
P.S. We know about Harry, and if you let that stop you from coming I’ll be forced to find you and hit you like no one’s done since 3rd year. Please come.
“I’m sorry.” He blurted out, “My marriage breaking up isn’t your fault, and I shouldn’t have gotten upset. I know I instigated what just happened.”
Harry finally looked over at Hermione like he was seeing her for the first time. “Thank you. Thank you for getting him here”.
Harry looked at Draco quizzically before responding slowly, “Malfoy… Of course we’ll keep searching for him. If they find her and not him he’ll be a missing child and there will be tons of Aurors looking for him. Why would you think they wouldn’t? Do you… do you not want us to find him?” Harry asked, trying to mask the revulsion he felt. Harry had spent the past ten days wanting nothing more than to hold his boys, he couldn’t imagine not wanting to get them back if they were missing.
Draco slowly grabbed the buckle of Harry's trousers, undoing them and sliding them to the floor. Draco began to mouth at Harry through his pants, making his cock wet though the thin fabric. As Harry grew in Draco's mouth, Draco sucked softly on Harry's tip.
Ginny's eyes flashed with anger, “So that's it? We have a chance to save this and you won't take it?”
Harry closed his eyes briefly when he finished the letter, sadness overwhelming him. He looked over at Draco, noted the pale tint to his skin, and quickly folded the letter so he could tell Draco the news about Theo. No matter how much he wanted to deal with his home life, he knew he needed to push it down and focus on helping to find Draco’s son.
Time passed slowly, with the three of them making stilted conversation. After discussing quidditch scores, the newest Defense professor at Hogwarts, and the shared enjoyment of being fathers, Harry and Draco quickly ran out of conversation. The hours ticked on and more tea was drank, Harry started looking at his watch, watching the hours tick away with heavy eyes. At two, Harry decided to give up.
Draco rolled his eyes, “I’ve wanted to marry you for the past two years Harry. But not now, not like this.”
Draco smiled up at them, “Yeah, I suppose I’m going to go get a drink with Potter after all.” He said with a grin.
Draco stood up, his movements flowing and soft. “Come sit down here, cross your legs.” He said, gesturing to the pillow on the ground he had just vacated.
Halfway through the entre Draco froze as he stared at Harry’s wrist. “You’re wearing your watch,” he observed quietly.
Harry looked at him oddly, “It's…. It's 10:30 in the morning. You can't have even gotten two hours of sleep. Why are you drinking?” He asked.
Draco poured himself a generous helping of whiskey, holding it up to Harry in a mock cheers before downing the drink in one quick gulp. As he poured himself another drink he turned and sneered at Harry, “Because Potter, it's the only thing I have left.” He downed his second drink before walking over to the couch and sinking back into it.
Quick as he could, Draco began tugging Harry’s shirt up over his head and flung it back over his head. He began kissing down Harry’s chest, his hands caressing the firm muscles. Slowly, Draco slid his way off of Harry’s lap onto the carpet beneath. He looked up at Harry, biting his lip and resting his fingers on the waistline of Harry’s trousers.
Draco sat back down, eyeing her warily, “Does blood purity really mean that much to you? Does it matter that he’s a muggle if you love him?”
“I’m talking you once again showing just how little you cared about me!” Harry yelled angrily, shoving the morning’s prophet into Draco’s face.
Draco smirked, “not quite. If you perform a lumos while pointing your wand at the second hand of the watch, it opens up.”
“So you’re really excited to get Astoria home, throw her on the bed and have wild and crazy newlywed sex the moment your vows are finished?” Pansy asked.
Draco clenched his fists before storming towards the front door, “You're an ass, Potter. I need to clear my head.” He bellowed before slamming the door behind him.
Narcissa pursed her lips, trying to look apologetic while actually looking happy, “It’s for Harry.” She almost whispered.
Ginny had joined him for dinner each night, and stayed after each meal until after the boys had gone to bed. They'd had an opportunity to talk about what was and was not working in their relationship. Harry was still unwilling to quit his job, and Ginny was still insistent that he needed to. Leaving the boys with Ginny that morning had broken Harry's heart, even though he knew he'd be back with them in a week.
“Because she’s been happy! She’s been so happy the past few years, and I don’t want to see her give it up to marry a man she doesn’t love just to fit some stupid pureblood ideology that should have died out generations ago!”
Draco jumped out of bed, pulling trousers on as he walked out his bedroom door. As he grabbed a handful of floo powder his mother came up behind him, “Where are you going?” She asked.
Your Goddaughter has finally made her appearance into the world. Rose Weasley arrived at 7lb 3 oz at 4:32 am. Hermione wanted me to tell you that she knows you have the day off and expects to see you before visiting hours are over.
Draco breathed and rubbed the bridge of his nose “To end you randomly accosting me to yell at me? I’d do pretty much anything” Draco stood and walked into his office, motioning Harry to follow behind him. He pulled his pensive from the closet and put his wand up to his temple. Draco flicked the memory of the deal offer into the pensive and motioned to Harry “Go on then. That’s everything.”
Seconds ticked by as Ron stared at Harry, his nostrils flaring with each breath. "You’re not ready to decide that you want to live with your pregnant wife and your children?" Ron asked, his voice cold.
Harry knelt down until he could look Draco in the eyes, “Listen. I don’t know where he is, or what’s going on. But I promise, I’m going to find out. But before I can do that, the first thing we need to do is get you somewhere safe.”
Pansy had come by a few times, and Draco had lunch with Astoria again. He tried to keep the topics light, refusing to answer questions and not telling them about his visit with the Aurors. Inside, though, Draco was in turmoil. As much as he tried not to think about it, he couldn’t help but wonder what in the past few months was Harry being Harry, and what was the potion. He tried not to think about what if’s and questions, but on Friday morning he came home, locking his floo, and poured himself a whiskey, intent not to have to think again till Monday morning.
Harry nodded his head, “Anytime Malfoy. Don’t think for a minute though this means I don’t still think you were a git in school… but that doesn’t mean you’re a bad man now.”
Draco rolled his eyes and chuckled, taking a seat next to Harry. “Right. Boys missed each other. Very important. Very thoughtful.”
"I'd love to, but I once tried to kill the owner's brother and I imagine he wouldn't take kindly to me either."
Draco gave Astoria a placating smile, “I’m not going to have an affair Astoria. I promise, I would never bring you any sort of sadness, and I never want you to think that you’re not enough for me. Once we say ‘I do’ I’ll be yours completely. I promise.”
“Still. Proper etiquette and all that. So, is something the matter, or did you just feel you needed to sample all the liquor in Britain tonight?” Draco teased, coming around and taking a seat next to Harry.
“Great. Once that comes back clear we can go ahead and move forward with the contract. I’m thinking we could plan on getting married this fall?”
They tried everything; swaddling, letting her be uncovered and able to move, white noise, silencing charms around her room, rocking her to sleep, singing to her, bouncing her, bouncing the bassinet, pacifiers, and even enchanting the ceiling above the bassinet. Harry was just about to begin looking into using sage to get rid of possible demon possessions when Hermione came through the floo on Friday after work.
“They don’t really know. They said it was an unknown potion, but that he’s been using it for at least three months and was going through sever withdrawals when he was brought in. If you’d like I can sign a release so the doctors can talk to you about his condition. It’ll be invalid as soon as he’s in control of his facilities, but until then it should suffice.”
Draco stiffened “I tried love. It didn’t work out. Now it’s time to try something else. I’m ready to be the man you raised me to be. I thought you would be happy”
“Attention.” Head Auror Robards called, “I need everyone to focus; we have an important job to do tonight and we need to do it right. In the past two months, three muggle families have been slaughtered, each with a child whose name appeared in the
“Draco!” Astoria smiled enthusiastically as she walked into his office, just as Draco was pulling out a quill to respond, “I’m so glad I caught you. I just finished speaking with my family solicitor and I was hoping we could talk about the contract.”
"Incarcerous," Harry quickly spelled ropes around Draco, binding his hands to his sides, "Accio Malfoy's wand".
Happy Labor Day to all the Americans reading this. Sorry this is a few days late, I ended up out of cell service for the weekend.
Ron immediately broke into a grin and ran and embraced Harry, his arms coming around him like a giant bear.
“Draco…” Harry started hesitantly, trying to proceed with caution. Harry stared at Draco for a long moment trying to formulate a sentence before he finally gave up and smiled, “Good work. I’ll send a report to Ron right away.”
“Mother” Draco hugged her back and then put out his hand to his father “Father. Thank you for having me over on such short notice.”
“Draco.” Harry croaked, “I’m sorry. I was going to talk to you when you came home. You weren’t supposed to find out like this”
“She’s not a baby.” Draco scoffed. “She’s a 24 year old witch who’s allowed to make her own decision.”
Draco pursed his lips, his eyes widening, “So I’m either trapped in this house for another year, or I get to go home but have to live in fear each day that they’ll come after me?”
Harry followed Draco cautiously, exhaustion clouding his mind. “What do you mean?” He asked shortly, sitting on the other side of the maroon couch.
Harry started cooking dinner while Draco was still in the shower. He pulled out the knife and began chopping vegetables without really seeing them, his mind racing with thoughts. By the time Draco had come out of the shower, fully dressed but his hair still damp, Harry was serving the stir fry out onto plates.
Despite Draco’s statement, the longer dinner went on the more like a date it felt. They’d started with wine and appetizers, and by the time the main course was being served Draco’s nervousness was gone and he was laughing with Harry like they used to when they were together.
Harry stared at Draco with surprise, his respect for Draco mounting. Claire gave him an odd look, and he realized he'd made a mistake on not reading the case file past seeing Draco was the informant. “That’s a very brave thing you did then. Turning your wife and her group in”
Claire bit her lip and nodded, trying to calm herself down but her eyes giving away the excitement she still felt, “Maybe we’ll get to do some real good.” She said passionately as she pushed open the door.
Draco looked at his mother nervously “I was wondering if you had any leads on the request I made this weekend?” He asked carefully.
"No," Harry replied, his voice so quiet it was practically a whisper, "he rolled up his sleeve and he had a set of fingerprint bruises on his arm. It looked like someone had dragging him. I think this is worse than I realized. People are actually hurting him."
After a few hours of wallowing, Draco shook his head and floo called his parents, asking if he could come over that evening for dinner. After confirming his plans, he headed for a shower and then a shave. At 6, Draco pulled on his favorite jumper, one given to him by his mother the year before, and stepped into the floo.
Draco started to move his mouth up and down quickly, one hand gripped firmly on Harry’s thigh and the other hand fisting his own cock. He hummed lightly, eliciting a groan from Harry, before he pressed himself down as far as he could go, taking Harry’s length into his throat. By the time he started to pull back up his eyes were watering with the efforts, but he could feel Harry breaking apart in front of him and it spurred him on. He quickened his pace even more, racing to the finish line.
Harry stood up from across the table, and slowly walked towards Draco, approaching like he would a wounded animal. When Harry arrived by Draco’s side, he knelt down on both knees and pulled Draco’s hands into his, bringing them to his lips for a kiss. “Please Draco, please give me one more chance and I promise you I will work every day to make sure that you never ever have to doubt that you are the most loved man on this earth. Just please, say I still have a chance”.
“So tell me dearest, what happened between the last time I saw you and this morning that necessitated this large of an adjustment.”
“The damage to the hippocampus damaged his memory. He’s been remembering little bits and pieces the last two days, but he says it’s fuzzy. His memory is clearer back when he first started to be given the potion.”
"In fact!" Draco continued, "You should probably tell me what the outside world is like. Is the Queen still the monarch or has she passed? Is Shacklebolt still the minister or have Centaurs overthrown the government? Is Quidditch still played on brooms or do they ride around on oversized flying Crups?"
Harry cringed at her tirade, too many emotions fleeting through him. Draco’s face flashed quickly into his brain and he remembered what they’d done, but he tried to push it away as he stared at his wife. She sobbed again, harder, and Harry gently walked up close to her, wrapping her in a tight embrace. He felt her melt against his chest, her cries growing louder as he pulled her close.
“That’s right. You and your date who you are madly in love with and completely devoted to. You are going to be seen dining together, dancing together, and you will dote on them so completely that no one there could imagine you having any lingering feelings for anyone else. Do I make myself clear?”
Harry sighed, trying to push down his annoyance of rehashing the same disagreement they’d had many times before. “It’s my job love. Protecting people isn’t a 9-5 job, and I try my hardest to be here, but tonight I need to go and back up my other Aurors and try to make this world a better place for our family to live in. I’m sorry.”
"Harry,” Hermione said calmly, in a soothing voice, "It's okay. Maybe we're wrong. We just don't want you rushing into saving Malfoy if he doesn't actually need to be saved."
Hey everyone, thanks for sticking around this far on this! If you've noticed this chapter and the last are written a bit differently, it's because my computer broke and I lost everything and had to rewrite all of what I'd had. So, I have the next two chapters re-written, but I think my writing style has changed a bit just based on the amount of time between writing the previous chapters and these new ones plus doing these on my phone instead of on a computer (unfortunately I live in an area that I haven't been able to get the computer repaired for the last 7+ months due to a combination of a family emergency that had us traveling long-term and then as soon as we came home we faced lockdown due to Covid. So thank you everyone for your patience in how long it took me to start updating these again, and hopefully you still enjoy it!
Harry eyed Draco warily, adrenaline still rushing through his veins, "why should I believe you? How do I know this isn't a trap?"
Harry bit his lower lip nervously, “Sometimes” He started reluctantly, “I feel like you don’t care as much as I do. But it’s not all the time and I usually realize that I’m just being insecure and you show your affection differently than I do.”
Draco shot Harry a withering glare, lifting his chin before responding, “Strangely I never thought to ask my wife the name of the man she was going off at night to fuck.”
“Barrister Malfoy, a word please” Barrister Kathryn Combes, a court appointed public aide barrister, stepped into Draco’s office. She was short and thin, with long strawberry hair and a sing-song voice. Her feminine and sweet demeanor made many underestimate her, but Draco knew she was a force to be reckoned with in court.
Harry smiled and closed the gap between their mouths, pressing his lips against Draco’s and kissing him thoroughly. Draco sat there hesitantly as Harry wrapped his hands in Draco’s hair, and started nudging Draco further into the kiss with his lips. Suddenly, snapping into motion, Draco grabbed Harry around the waist and opened his mouth to the kiss.
Malfoy eyed Harry suspiciously while Harry unpacked his supplies, "Did you get into a fight with Longbottom?" He asked.
Claire smiled briefly at Harry before closing her eyes, “I know. Everything will work out. I just wish we knew when we were starting.”
“Malfoy,” Harry began carefully, his voice trying to take on a soothing quality, “It’s not like that. I can't just floo Ron and tell him we're in a safehouse and to please come and get us when he knows the coast is clear. If he's in the middle of a fight, that could compromise everything. We don't know what's safe and what's not. Look in that basket, see how it's empty? That's because the house elf already got the letter and she's going to find Ron and get it to him at the first safe opportunity she gets, and not compromise us in the process. Now, I will send out 1,000 letters if it would make you feel better, but for now it seems smarter to not alert anyone about Scorpius unless they need to know. What if someone doesn't know you're our witness, and I send out a patronus and give you away? I don't want to put him or you in more danger than you're already in.”
Narcissa pursed her lips before saying slowly “There was one young lady whose name was submitted, but she appears completely unsuitable. She has just returned from spending the past four years traveling abroad, and is said to have quite the rebellious streak in her. I am not even sure why she would want to get married”
Draco stepped through the floo into the total darkness of Harry’s flat, quickly maneuvering his way to the bedroom that used to be his. From the bedroom doorway Draco looked in, “What in Merlin’s name is wrong with you, you stupid wanker?!” Draco screamed.
They sat there quietly for a few minutes, both lost in thought. Harry kept thinking about his family, about seeing his boys again. He was excited, he had missed them a lot. He thought about seeing Ginny though, and he just got angry. He didn’t know what she was doing, and he hated feeling like she’d been trying to manipulate him. He wondered what she would have done if he had signed the divorce papers, if she would have just accepted it or if she would have tried to talk him out of it. He wondered what Ron could have possibly done to convince Head Auror Robards to send him home before they identified the mole in the office. Harry had known that once they identified the mole he was going to be switched out, probably put on an every other week rotation, but now the thought of leaving Draco was harder than he had imagined it could be. He was scared that changing him out now, before the mole was discovered, could put Draco at risk. Harry swallowed hard, pushing the thought out of his mind and thinking about the next morning, switching out with Ron and then getting to see his boys again.
Hermione grabbed Harry’s hand and squeezed it, “Anytime Harry. Get better. I’m going to give you two some time to talk and Ron and I will be back later.”
“No, but adult me met the one Astoria fell in love with and traveled all across the world with.” Daphne shot back.
Harry stuttered as he felt Draco's large hand wrap around his cock. Harry moaned, clenching his fists, “I pulled you out to talk. Not… Merlin's beard,” he cursed as Draco twisted his wrist and pulled.
Draco looked at Harry contemplatively for a moment, his expression unreadable "He's not my boyfriend." Draco said finally. "We've just been fooling around together this term."
"I told him about Auror Muldoon. He asked a couple of details then went back. What's there to talk about really?"
“Should we move this into the bedroom?” Draco asked, pulling his lips away to start nibbling on Harry’s jaw.
Harry let out a breath his brain racing to catch up to what was happening. He wanted to back up, to go back to the living room and hide. He wasn’t sure what to do, but this was far from what he thought he’d be walking into. He wanted to grab Draco, to pull him towards him and wrap their arms around each other. Harry cursed internally, his resolve wavering as he realized that Draco wasn’t offering what he had been hoping for. Slowly, he felt his legs moving him forward to where Draco sat.
“Draco, darling. I have news.” Narcissa almost sang as she came through Draco’s floo early Tuesday morning, a mischievous grin on her face.
Harry froze, his eyes widening as he looked at Ron. He opened his mouth to respond but couldn't make his voice work. Finally, he swallowed hard and muttered, "Well. No. Not yet. We're... Uh.... Well you know I don't think we're quite ready for that... You know... To make a decision on that yet."
Draco gave a soft sound of agreement before leaning heavily on Harry. “It’s not supposed to be like this.” He stopped and hiccupped lightly, “I was supposed to have Scorpius with me by now. How can I sleep when I don’t even know where he is?”
As court adjourned, Draco turned and exited through the side door which lead to the court holding cells, hoping to avoid the throng of press that he knew would be looking for a statement. As Draco turned a corner he was grabbed and pulled into a dark room, a wand shoved up against his chin and his back was pushed up against a wall.
The next couple of chapters are a bit fluffy (don't worry, the angst'll be back to hit you like a brick before you know it) so I added some smut to this one! It's at the end and if you don't want to read smut, you can pretty easily just skip to the very end of the chapter once things start heating up!
Standing in line for a drink, Astoria started telling Draco an amusing anecdote about one of the minister’s aides from back when they went to Hogwarts together. Draco let out an amused snort and turned to her and said “Merlin that’s amazing”
Draco again rolled his eyes and poured himself a large glass of scotch before walking over and sitting next to Harry on the couch. This was the first time Draco had drank since their first morning in the safehouse, and Harry was holding his breath worried about how it would go. He was relieved to see that Draco was slowly sipping his drink, instead of binging like he had the last time. Harry caught himself staring at Draco’s throat as he swallowed a sip of scotch and quickly turned away, blinking hard.
“Theo’s been out of country for over a month, so it looks like your theory has some merit. Do you know any of his known associates? Someone who might not be obvious on paper but who he might turn to?” Harry asked.
Once Harry finished his sandwich he walked his plate back into the kitchen, cleaned it, and then headed into the living room. As he walked into the living room Draco immediately said “some mail came in for you earlier, it’s in the box.”
"Sounds like you've spent too much time looking at the ferret again Mate." Ron said, pointing a drumstick at Harry accusingly, "Just let it go. He's a big boy, he can take care of himself."
Harry choked, “You. I want you” He pressed forward again, capturing Draco’s bottom lip with his teeth. Harry bit down, gently, before releasing his teeth and swiping at Draco’s lip with his tongue. “I want you so fucking badly Draco.” He moaned.
"I dunno." Harry said, "Like maybe he'd been in a fight or something. I just worry that maybe someone's been bullying him. He's mostly alone except for Blaise and Theo, and he was a death eater. I just worry some people might be trying to pick fights with him instead of moving on."
"I mean, if you’re regretting last night and want to tell him it was a mistake, I’d recommend just leaving it be. He’s already pretty sure that’s how you’re feeling. If you think that last night was amazing and you wanted to see where things would go, then I’d recommend you keep trying.”
Ginny came out of the bathroom and turned to him, her expression blank “I’ll go get the boys and bring them to Grimmauld. I’ll bring dinner by tonight and we can talk and figure stuff out once the boys are in bed, yeah?” She said evenly.
Draco grimaced, “That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about… Was that genuine or was that just for the press?”
It started, unexpectedly, at the engagement party of Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry Potter, long time best friend of the couple, decided to bury the hatchet and buy a drink for Draco Malfoy, the coworker with whom Hermione had been working closest in recent months. It started as a simple way to put bygones aside, and ended with a tumble into bed aided by two bottles of champagne and one of Ogden’s finest. One night of amazing sex quickly turned to multiple nights, and by the time of Ron and Hermione’s wedding Harry and Draco were spending nearly every night in each other’s arms.
“He was arrested for smuggling frozen Ashwinder eggs, a negligible offense really. Barely even illegal” Kathryn took another sip of her tea before continuing and waved her hand as if waving aside the charges, “Unfortunately, he has other charges on his records. This could count as a parole violation and land him in Azkaban for years”
Harry let out a dry laugh, before raising the glass in a mock salute, "no arguing with you. Cheers then" and he tipped the amber liquid down his throat. After Harry finished his drink, he looked up at Draco sadly. "Ginny filed for divorce."
I'm now realizing that my note on yesterday's chapter saying this one would be more "cheerful" might not have been the right word. It should be a bit illuminating at least. I'm hoping that the next two chapters are going to answer a lot of questions, though they'll probably create some new questions too.
Draco continued to stare at Harry incredulously, before finally clearing his throat, “Well, thank you, Potter. I’ll consider it.”
“That’s why I called the best” Draco smirked. “Could you send a house-elf to go pack up my things from my old flat? I’d prefer to avoid taking one from the Manor and alerting my parents that something is amiss.”
“He has logs of transactions, as well as a vault number he’s been transferring money into for the past six months. He’s willing to write out a statement to be verified under Veritaserum, and provide memories for the pensive.”
"Yes, Zabini. Why shouldn't Potter go? Been dreaming of having the chosen cock up your ass and finally think this is the right opportunity?" Draco spat.
Draco let out a soft laugh, and the sound lifting Harry's heart considerably. "It was very quiet. How're the boys?"
Harry put his chin up, trying to cover the embarrassment in his tone, “Well. I wanted to show you that I was serious. That I was committed.” Seeing Draco’s thunderous face, Harry looked down and mumbled, “It was Ron’s idea.”
After his shower Draco checked out of the hotel, and tried to decide what to do for the rest of the day. He stopped as he realized he had no place to go; for the next five hours he was essentially homeless. Draco didn’t want to go to buy furniture and decorations until he’d seen his new place, and it seemed silly to go to the grocery store when he didn’t even have a kitchen to cook his meals in. He could always go to the manor, but he was trying to avoid telling his parents about his and Harry’s separation until he’d settled things a bit clearer in his mind. He hadn’t actually wanted to tell Pansy but necessity required it.
Draco nodded thoughtfully, “He’s not a baby anymore. He doesn’t need to be entertained 24/7. If you’d like you could have him during the day and I could take him at night so you can have some time to yourself.”
Draco let out a full laugh, deep in his belly, “no” his hand curled in Harry’s hand, pulling slightly. Draco’s cheeks, already flushed with drink, flushed brighter as his eyes lit up, “there’s lots of ways a man’s hands can make another man feel good.”
Harry nodded, “Well, hopefully they’ll find Scorpius tomorrow and we won’t even have to think about it. I just wish you could leave here too.”
“You know, if you did magically manage to forget something I’m sure Weasley would send it back to you.” Draco snapped as Harry paced back and forth down the short hallway.
Draco's eyes narrowed, "You did that on purpose." He accused, sitting up and running his hands over his robes to check for damages.
Draco bit down on Harry's clavicle, and Harry felt his brain shutter to a stop. His hands moved of their own accord and began opening Draco's trousers, pulling out the hard cock within. Draco moaned into Harry's neck, batting Harry's hands away and pulling both of their cocks together into his own hand.
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table, trying to catch Draco's eye. When Draco finally looked over, Harry smiled at him. Draco looked around confused before grimacing at Harry.
Harry grinned, “That’s all I ask. You can think about it while they work to get Scorpius back to you. Then once he’s here you can decide.”
Harry lowered himself down carefully, folding his legs across each other and putting his hands down on his knees. “So how do I do this?” He asked, his voice sounding pouty even to his own ears
The fight went out of Draco almost immediately and he slumped into a chair. Running his fingers through his hair, Draco starred helplessly at Harry “do you have any idea what it feels like to have your child out there somewhere, but to have no idea where? I don't know if he's safe, I don't even know if he's even fucking ALIVE. I just feel so useless.”
Draco let out a soft sob, his eyes clenching shut as he let out of minuet nod. His shaky hand reached out and grabbed the ring in Harry’s hand. Harry breathed a sigh of relief and hit down on the button that would take them to the safehouse.
Harry groaned in frustration, “I should check that” he pulled Draco in for another quick kiss before extracting himself from Draco’s arms and walking over to the inbox. There were two messages, folded together.
“She’s only marrying me because she wants to have pureblood children. She’s still in love with her ex. It didn’t seem right to marry her.”
Draco walked over and sat on the couch, “what do you think she wants to talk about?” He asked, trying to sound disinterested.
Draco's eyes grew wide with horror, "Scorpius." Draco exclaimed, "Potter. My son. If they know I'm your witness they could go after him." Draco was frantic, struggling against his bonds as he attempted to stand. "We need to get him. I need to make sure he's alright."
Draco stood quickly and began to start pacing, his shoulders stiff and arms held behind his back. “I just want this to be over. I don’t like being away from my son for this long.”
When Draco flopped down onto his bed Harry sat on the edge, “How’s your head? I’d offer to heal you but I’m not sure I’d be steady enough with my wand.”
Harry gave a soft smile, “At least I'll be back before then. We'll have some more time together before you leave.”
Ginny's voice went cold, her face flushed with anger, "Well that's your own damn fault. You came home because we need to talk. Don't act like you just chose to come home today Harry!"
“Nonsense son, you know you are always welcome here. If your mother had her way you would move back in and we could have every meal together.” Lucius gripped Draco’s hand firmly before walking over to the bar. “Can I offer you a drink?”
“4 it is. I’ll bring you some of those chocolates you like as a thank you for arranging everything…. And to show appreciation for your discretion at this difficult time”
Just then, a ding came from the inbox, and Harry rushed forward to grab it, excited to see what Ron had to say about Draco’s theory. Inside, instead of a small paper envelope, was a large manila envelope addressed to Harry in an unfamiliar script. He opened it slowly, pulling out a thick stack of paperwork, and a letter. He walked over to couch, and sat down heavily to read the letter.
Narcissa sat down on Draco’s bed, “We didn’t go out looking for new candidates, but this offer was given to our solicitors yesterday, and looking it over they felt it was best to send it through to us.”
Harry’s expression quickly changed to one of pity, “Malfoy…. That’s not…. No. I promise you, I won’t stop looking until we have Scorpius back. I… You… You’re not a Death Eater.”
Harry stood up, stretching his arms over his head he sighed and headed to the door; there was no way the report was being written without some caffeine. As Harry reached for the door handle the wood slammed forward and Claire ran in, face flushed and slightly out of breath.
Harry snorted, "I'm sorry. I should have written. I just... You were so angry at me, I thought if I wrote to you if would make you more angry."
“I know.” Draco gave her a hug, “Don’t worry so much mother. I asked for this”. Draco smiled at her reassuringly.
“There’s also a provision in the contract that you agree to have at least two magical children, and if any of your children are found to be squibs you’ll have another.”
Draco heard the flare of his floo but didn’t look up as he watched yet another howler go up in flames.
Draco immediately moved his queen forward, “checkmate.” His smile was huge, his whole face bright with laughter.
“That day that he broke up with me, I kissed him. I was so angry, and hurt, and I grabbed him and kissed him and immediately he just fell into my arms like none of the past ten minutes had happened. I thought, afterwards, that maybe he had still loved me at least a little. Was it because of the potion?”
Harry smiled lightly, “I get it, Malfoy. Do you think I would be upset that you trusted me? I know this outcome isn’t what you were expecting when you asked. I’m glad you knew you could trust me enough to keep you safe. It wasn’t always like that.”
, but he pushed it away. He put his hand on the door handle, his heart racing. He closed his eyes lightly, trying to find the power to walk away but instead he found himself turning the door handle, walking through.
Draco finally settled on stopping by his office. He had paperwork that needed to be filled out, and it would keep his mind occupied. Draco quickly walked to the Ministry and headed up to his 3rd floor office, trying to avoid seeing anyone. He settled into his desk and pulled out his notes, quickly falling into the rhythm of case briefs and letting his personal life fall deep into the back of his mind.
Before Harry even knew what he was doing he was standing. His feet had walked him over to the desk, and he looked at the papers. He couldn’t though, in ten years when his children asked him why their parents split up he couldn’t look them in the eyes and say “well I divorced your mum so I could go shag the witness I was protecting”. Harry groaned in frustration and walked back over to the coach, sitting down heavily upon it. He went to pick up the book again but instead he just put his head in his hands to think.
Harry pulled off his cloak as he approached to door of the deserted classroom. A quick look at the map showed that Draco was still backed into a corner with Blaise in front of him, causing Harry to see red. Drawing his wand, he spelled open the door and strode in, "Get away from him Blaise." Harry said in outrage as he turned to face the corner he knew Blaise and Draco were in.
Hello, sorry for the wait on this. I had an epilogue written, and I went to go post it and it just didn't feel right... Like, it was missing all the adjustment phase. So. Welcome to the bonus chapter that I never meant to write!! 😬
“That part didn’t seem optional did it? I guess I’ll go and get that next week.” Draco looked through the contract again, “The rest of it seems alright I suppose. Can you have our solicitors look it over and make any changes that need to be made?”
Draco stopped to consider for a moment, “I hadn’t really thought about it. I’d planned on at least one, to be the heir, but I’d never really planned any farther than that.”
“It’s not. I can assure you, I wouldn’t trade my sister for the world. I’m sure our children will feel the same.”
Draco started to break down. He floo called the office to tell them he wouldn’t be in before pulling out his broom. He quickly put a disillusionment charm on himself before opening his window and flying off, trying to out-fly the emotions filling his mind. Draco flew high in the sky, over the buildings and dreary city. He looked over, past the city skyline to the country laid out beneath him. Picking a far off stretch of land, Draco flew away.
“There’s some hangover potion on the counter in the kitchen for you, and I made you a sandwich.” Draco said, his voice even and controlled.
Draco narrowed his eyes, straightening his spine he pulled out a note pad. “That’s a very serious charge. I assume he has some proof?”
Sorry for the very long wait.... I had forgotten that I hadn't finished uploading this. I'll try to have all the chapters uploaded by the end of October. Just going through and editing the other chapters.
“I didn’t do this on purpose Auror Potter. Now, I understand that you are upset right now, but if you don’t release me immediately I am going to have you arrested for this.”
“You’re right. I just wanted to make sure that you knew what you were getting yourself into.” Draco smiled softly.
Blaise put a hand on Harry's shoulder to stop him from going after Draco, "Give up. You're not going to get anywhere arguing with him when he's in a stint like this."
Harry’s head shot up and he gave Draco a bewildered look, “Four?” He repeated dumbly, “Malfoy, that’s three years away.”
Harry shuttered, his breath catching as he straightened his back. He felt his pulse quicken at Draco’s touch, and he slowly turned his head to press his lips against Draco’s. Before their lips could connect, Draco quickly stood up, walking in front of Harry and gracefully sitting down in front on him.
Harry quickly put his hand on Draco’s arm, “No. No. They’re not giving up. Sorry, I thought Ron would have told you.” He said in a breath. “They think they’ve found where Astoria is hiding. They think they’ll be able to bring her in and get Scorpius back to you within the week.”
“Gin, I'm sorry. I can't. We can't. You kicked me out for a reason, we made our choices. It's better this way.” Harry said, trying to sound more sure than he felt.
Harry's felt his heart drop through his stomach, "Ron." He said cautiously, "You've known we've been fighting. She doesn't want me back if I'm not willing to leave the Corps."
Harry stopped breathing, his heart thudding heavily in his ears. Finally, Gryffindor courage drove him forward, “For this” he said quickly before he leaned forwards, closing the gap between himself and Draco. Harry’s hand moved to the back of Draco’s head, and he connected his mouth into a firm kiss. Draco responded immediately, his lips moving against Harry’s furiously. Draco lunged forwards, pressing his chest against Harry’s and lightly pushing him backwards. Harry quickly accommodated Draco, lying back on the ground and pulling Draco to straddle his thighs.
The conference room was a thrum of activity, twenty Auror’s mashed together to try and get a view of the far wall, which had been covered with pictures and notes. The air was buzzing with anticipation, and Harry tried to elbow his way forward through the crowd. It looked like most of the force had been called in for the raid, and Harry was immediately apprehensive.
“What if they find her and not him?” Draco said quickly, “What if she stashes him away with some distant relative? Will they stop looking after they’ve found her?”
“I. Well.” Draco stopped, unsure how to continue. He fought an internal battle, part of him wanting to tell Harry the truth and another glad Harry didn’t know. Finally, Draco decided to be honest. “We fought, and I ended up telling you that there was another gift inside of the watch.”
Ginny threw her arms around him, clutching him close. Her wild red hair pressed against the top of his nose, and he inhaled the familiar scent of her.
“Thanks,” Harry muttered, “But I’d probably best not. I expect a report should be coming in soon that I’ll need to respond to.”
I am so sorry. It's summer, and apparently all of my friends have decided that we are going to spend all of this summer outside biking and kayaking and day drinking (you know, when we're not at work), and I didn't think anyone wanted me to do a final edit on this chapter after the mojito cruise I took last night. So here's this chapter, one day late. After this chapter there's three more, and I will try my hardest to get those chapters out this week. Thank you for your patience!
“Anything that may help with the case really,” Harry began. “Any place that she might have run to. Anyone they might be hiding with. Any future targets. Anything that could lead us to your son faster.”
"Yeah." Harry looked at Draco contemplatively, after a moment he asked "So you're not getting dragged around by angry students who are threatening you or hurting you?"
“It looks like they were trying to create a cheaper version of Felix Felicis, one that could be used more often than the current potion and be easier to mass produce. Their notes show so many different alterations to the recipe though, it’s hard to tell what version they were dosing Auror Potter with.”
Though Harry intended to try to visit Draco more, that Monday Albus developed a small fever. Though the fever was not high enough to need a healer, it did necessitate extra ice lollies and attention. Lily was still much too young to risk getting sick, so Harry isolated himself and the boys together while Ginny cared primarily for Lily. By the time that Albus had healed James had a slight fever, and they had to continue in their isolation.
Draco gave a derisive laugh, “Oh, I know. The ministry needs to get their golden boy home soon. I’m surprised they’ve managed to go this far without having to call you back for some crup and pony show”
Harry dropped his voice to a soothing tone, recognizing the panic on Draco’s face, “It’s okay.” Harry promised, “It’s okay if you’re not ready. I just want you to know, this is your home too. Whenever you’re ready. We’ll go at your pace. When you want the wizarding world to know we’re back together, we’ll tell them. When you want to move back in, you’re welcome. When you’re ready to say forever in front of 1 million Weasleys, we’ll get married. I’m all in.”
“It’s going to be okay, just keep breathing” Harry said reassuringly, grabbing Claire’s hand and giving it a quick squeeze.
Narcissa pursed her lips “No. I have seen a provision for having at least one child, or to continue having children until they have a boy, but this agreement seems peculiar to me.”
He hadn’t signed the divorce papers. At first he’d thought he should try to appeal to Ginny, to remind her that he loved her and the boys and wanted nothing more than to be home with them. He knew it wouldn’t work though, if he tried to tell Ginny that he wanted to be home with them she would tell him to come home right then and prove it. Harry loved his job; sure the last month hadn’t been ideal, but he knew that staying with Ginny meant leaving his job, and he didn’t think he could stand that. At the same time, keeping his job meant losing his family, having his children grow up needing to move households. The boys were so young, they wouldn’t even remember a time when their whole family lived under the same roof. Plus, he loved Ginny. They’d been together since they were teens and Harry wasn’t sure who he even was if not Ginny’s husband. Sure, things had been rough for a couple of years but that didn’t mean you throw out the whole relationship. So instead of writing to her, begging for her to take him back or else signing the divorce paperwork and trying to find a path forward, Harry played chess.
Harry stood up, his hand brushing against Draco’s temple before he wandered to his own bed, “Good night,
Draco breathed in before nodding his head curtly, "Well. I'm gonna head off to bed then. Thank you for your concern but it was misplaced." Draco turned and put his hand on the door.
Draco sat quietly for a minute before asking “The Ashwinder egg. That’s used in almost every love potion out there. Could the potion have been used like a love potion?”
“I never said Rose was the crying baby now did I? Rose is sleeping tightly in her bed and a grown adult is acting like a baby in our living room and I thought you might need some company tonight as well. I’m not taking sides, but I reckon there’s not much I can do to make him feel better and I don’t know if he really deserves to feel better, so I figured I should probably come try to cheer you up instead.”
Harry looked at Draco carefully, taking in his relaxed posture. If Harry hadn't spent the majority of his adolescent starting at Draco he likely would have missed the tension in his face and shoulders, revealing the anxiety he was trying to hide. Draco had been so open and vulnerable the night before, Harry was almost surprised to see him back to his normally stand-offish self.
room with Malfoy- if they wanted to avoid improper fraternization then they needed to do a better job keeping their Aurors from prolonged isolation with attractive blond gits. No, Harry thought bitterly, he could protect Draco just fine and still be inside of him.
After they had finished eating and the kitchen was clean, they still had almost an hour before Ron was set to arrive. Harry started wandering throughout the house, double checking that all of his belongings were properly packed. He didn’t have a lot, having been unprepared when he got there the list of things that the house elf had sent to him were slim. Still, he found himself triple checking his bags and doing a final walk through just the same.
“Ron and Hermione asked Harry and I to be their baby’s godparents when they first found out they were pregnant. I hadn’t thought about it, but I would have assumed that would have ended with Harry and I’s relationship”
They came together, their orgasms mixing on their stomachs. Harry shook beneath Draco as he rode out the last sensations, and Draco slowly rolled to the side so he was lying next to Harry instead of on top of him.
Draco looked up with a glare “The beginning of betrothal negotiations is a far cry from an engagement Weasel, something that most pureblood wizards would know” Though the words were harsh they were said with none of their old bite, and an almost affectionate smirk played upon Draco’s face by the end.
“So bitter about the breakup that you needed to get my new boyfriend sent to Azkaban?” Draco’s heart clenched as he heard Harry for the first time in months, angry and darker than he’d heard it since they were teenagers on opposite sides of the war.
“Draco!” Harry exclaimed “you’re home!” Harry quickly scrambled off the bed and clutched the blanket to cover him. Jacob looked up fearfully and apparated out of the room, not even bothering to stop for his clothes.
Ginny hugged him back before looking up at him, biting her lip and seeming to want to say something. Finally, she shook her head and smiled “Thank you, Harry, for being here with me. I could not have handled this alone.”
“Stag-o? That's a name I guess.” Malfoy’s snort broke Harry out of his trance and he looked up in surprise.
In Draco’s defense, he did exactly what Harry asked and went back to how they’d been before. He would wake up in the morning, get ready, and head into the kitchen to make breakfast. As soon as Draco was out of sight Harry would roll over in bed, his head aching and his mind racing. By the second day, he thought he was going to be driven to complete insanity. The requests from Ron and Robards were less frequent now, most of the information that they needed from Draco had already been received. Harry would receive updates, he knew that a close group of Aurors were working to find Nott, and that more would be read in as they passed the veritaserum testing that was set to begin the following week.
Draco paused to pour himself another drink and downed it before continuing. “So then, I go to the Aurors. I know I can't let my son be raised by a blood purist murderer. I've lived that childhood already. I know he needs to be better than I was as a kid, so he needs to be raised better. And now what's happening? My son is missing. She took him and,” Draco’s voice wavered and he put his drink down, “And now I don't even get to see him grow up. I…. I tried so hard to make sure I was going to be raising him well, and now I’ve lost him.” Draco physically shook at his statement before tears started coming down his face, he buried his head in his hands.
"Sorry Malfoy, looks like it's just something from Ginny. I'll just go deal with this in the other room..." Harry trailed off, the stack of papers feeling suddenly more heavy in his hands. Breathing deeply, he stood up on wobbly legs to head to the bedroom. Finally, closing the door behind him and sitting down on his bed he set the letter aside to see the stack of paperwork behind it. His eyes immediately drew to the top of the page, and his breath whooshed out of his lungs.
Harry looked at Draco, his eyes full of panic, “listen… Malfoy… we should… we should probably talk about last night.”
Harry sat drumming his fingers on the table. After a few minutes of listening to Ron and Hermione discuss their plans to visit Hogsmeade the following weekend Harry interrupted, "what it I worked with him in potions today? Show people that I've moved on, maybe they'll move on too."
Draco rested his head on Hermione’s shoulder as she gently rubbed soothing circles into his back. Finally he nodded, “I’ll go. Let me get dressed and we can go.”
Harry nervously rubbed at the back of his neck, “He recommended I should do something to show you that things had changed, and that I was going to make an effort. I figured what better way to show things were different than by showing you that I want to commit to you completely. And since you were going through the betrothal process with Astoria, I figured that was the way you wanted to do it, and if I initiated it, you’d realize that I was paying attention.”
As if sensing his exhaustion, Harry squeezed lightly on Draco’s shoulder before nodding his head towards the hallway behind him. “There's nothing else we can do right now. Let's get some rest, and I'll wake you as soon as I've heard word.”
Harry's voice dropped, "oh don't worry. I'm perfectly aware that the only reason I'm home right now is because you were willing to put the case I'm on and the target I was protecting in danger so we could talk."
After a couple of minutes she stood up and walked to the bathroom, and Harry sat nervously. He had no idea what he was going to do. He and Ginny had been fighting on and off for months, and she had filed for divorce, how were they going to have another baby? He loved his children, and he knew he would love another, but this was just an awful situation. His heart started to race as fear set in, he had no clue how they could handle this.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, his breath hitching. He looked at Draco, pupils dilated, his hair rumpled, kneeling down in front of him. He let out a breath, “Yes.”
Draco sat up at that, “What? I hadn’t realized we were still looking. I know we hadn’t spoken about that, but I assumed we were going to wait.”
“I’m always safe Gin, you know that,” Harry smiled indulgently at Ginny, wrapping her in a large hug.
Saturday evening at 6 saw Draco calling on Astoria, who had been two grades behind him at Hogwarts. Draco knew Astoria in passing, but he didn’t believe they’d ever spoken. Still, she was stunning, with a shimmering dress and a kind smile Draco took to her instantly. Draco knew her mother had appraised her of part of the situation, that it would be beneficial to Draco to be seen with someone know acted familiar with him, and task she was quick to embrace. Astoria was a graceful dancer, and kept the whole table in stitches half the night. When the press spotted them together she leaned in close to him and laughed at a pretend joke, petting Draco on his arm. Draco had seen the Head Barrister looking at him warily when they first came in, but even he seemed to have fallen to Astoria’s charms by the end of the night.
Ginny glared at him, her face sour. "Yes, well, since you didn't want to talk to me about whatever I had to say I'm assuming you don't care. But at my pre-game physical two days ago the mediwitch discovered I'm 6 weeks pregnant."
"That the kind of welcome you wanted me to give him Blaise?" Draco said seductively before darting his head around to realize Blaise was nowhere to be found.
Harry stared at Draco in shock, trying to process, “Listen… Malfoy… I’m sorry. I was drunk. I made a mistake. I’m not going to make it again. I just want us to move past this and go back to how things have been the last month.”
Harry walked up close to Draco cautiously and placed a tentative hand on his shoulder, “Hey,” he said gently, “I don't know what it's like. I can't imagine the pain you must be in right now. But I promise you, I'm here to protect you, and they're going to work their ass off to find your son too.”
Draco leaned back, watching Astoria for a while. He took a deep breath, “I’m sorry Astoria. I don’t think I can make the decision for you, but I would chose love over blood purity any day.”
Astoria hesitated a moment before plastering a smile on her face. “Draco.  I like you. I think you’re going to make an excellent husband and a great father to our children. But I know this isn’t the life you had planned for yourself. If, at some point, you were to decide that you needed… more … than I was able to give you, I wouldn’t begrudge you your happiness. But I would want it to be in a way that we had agreed upon; terms that were being adhered to.”
His job had left him stranded in this safehouse for weeks. Who the hell had thought to wait a month before using the truth serum to find the mole? What was even the point of being wizards and having these magical solutions in their hands if the department was going to be so caught in bureaucracy that they weren’t going to get an answer for over a month? What did they expect him to do? He’d even asked, back in the first week, for permission to add a second bedroom but the request still hadn’t been approved. As far as anyone at headquarters knew he was sharing a one bedroom,
Harry nodded his head in agreement, the sudden though of Draco getting hurt seeming to sober him up a bit. The moment was broken, and though he wanted to kneel back down and kiss Draco again, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Instead, Harry reached a hand out for Draco to grab onto, and after a slight struggle they were both standing. Harry kept hold of Draco, slowly walking him into the bedroom.
Draco rolled his eyes, “You’ve been on the job for a month. Let your hair down a little. We’ll be out of here soon.”
“It has been a bit lonely. I've considered replacing an entire wall with a window cause I'm so tired of being inside this house." Draco replied, beginning to nibble his way down Harry's neck.
Was that as painful for anyone else to read as it was for me to write? I promise, if you've stuck with me this far it's about to get a little bit more cheerful.
Harry continued to stare at Draco quizzically, “Is there any reason that staying in Britain wouldn’t work out for you?”
Harry tried to remember the feeling of Ginny kissing him. Tried to think of her soft pale skin under his fingertips, the way she would laugh in his ear when he kissed her neck. His mind kept changing the image though, Ginny’s neck would change to Draco’s neck and her laugh would deepen into his voice. Harry felt another sharp pang of arousal and knew he needed to stop thinking. Harry laid down on the coach, hoping to fall asleep into a nap. His mind started supplying him with daydreams, and he knew he could never stop and rest when just a room away Draco was pleasuring himself in a way that Harry very much wanted to help with.
The next Friday Harry received news that there was a delay in Astoria's trial. James had asked about Scorpius a couples more times, and Albus had said Scor enough that Harry was pretty sure his boys were missing Draco's son. Harry decided to take the boys for a visit the next day, and tell Draco about Astoria's trial in person. At first when Harry told Ginny his plan for the morning she'd frowned, but she didn't offer any objection and Harry assured her they'd be back in time for lunch.
“Fine.” Draco sat up, glaring daggers at Hermione, “Tell me. What did the potion do? Why was he taking it? What happened to his memory?”
“That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about Draco.” Daphne stopped suddenly, as if searching for words. Adrian gave her hand another squeeze before she started again “You can’t marry my sister.”
Draco rolled his eyes again before he stood up, walking his plate into the kitchen to begin cleaning it. “I’m sorry okay? I didn’t expect it to turn into this. I expected it was going to be two hours and then my wife would be in jail and I would thank you and then head away to go pick up my son and you’d be free to continue with your life. I didn’t mean to trap you here with me.”
“I’m sorry Harry.” Draco felt tears welling into his eyes and he blinked them back. “I’m so sorry but I don’t think we can”.
Draco shot Blaise a scathing look, but excitement was racing through his blood. Draco walked over to Harry and slowly knelt before him, mouthing at the hardness in Harry's trousers before looking up, "Tell me no if you don't want this."
“There has to be another way. Surely you can just spell him down until you get this sorted.” Hermione said.
As soon as Jacob was gone Draco spun around and stormed downstairs, itching to break something. Once he arrived in his living room he began to pace, his brain refusing to comprehend the scene he had just witnessed. After five minutes he heard the creaking of the stairs, and took a deep breath to look at where Harry was slowly slinking down the stairs, fully clothed.
“That sigh must mean we’re saved, right?” Draco asked, walking in from the kitchen holding two plates.
Harry ran to the hallway from the kitchen, a pot of noodles still clutched in his hands, “What are you talking about?” He asked.
Harry raised his eyebrows amused, “Inside? Like I’m supposed to break it with a hammer like the muggle magicians do?”
“None.” Draco smiled. “Now I should probably get back downstairs. I appreciate you coming here, I apologize for missing our lunch.”
Harry quickly started to rise and drop down, panting as he did so. Draco put his hand on Harry’s hips, lifting him up and helping him plunge hard onto Draco’s shaft. Draco pulled Harry down into a heavy kiss, wrapping his arm around Harry’s neck, holding him close as if to merge their two bodies into one.
Draco snorted lightly, "No. But it does make you dumb. You can't get a divorce while your wife is pregnant unless you can prove it's not your baby."
“Guys. I think I figured something out last night.” Harry announced as he sat down to breakfast with Ron and Hermione.
Harry sat back for a moment, thinking hard. Finally, impulsively, he pursed his lips before saying “Come back to my place with me. It’s under a fidelius, it’s protected. My boys will be there every other week, but Albus is the same age as Scorpius, they can play together… err… as much as six month olds can play.”
Harry gave him a weird look, “I image it gets worse the farther you get from Scotland.” He said finally when he realized Draco wasn’t going to continue his thought.
Harry started scribbling down the information, “great Malfoy, that’s really helpful” He said, not looking up from his sheet.
Hermione took in Draco’s composure and slowly stood up to walk across to the other side of the desk. Draco clutched his hands tightly as Hermione put one hand on his shoulder and went to kiss Draco on the cheek “Draco, I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m here if you need me”
“You understand correctly. It’s time to move on. I want to move on.” Draco’s grip on his drink tightened but he forced his face to stay cool and collected.
Narcissa nodded “Yes, which used to be a common part of the traditional contract, but I do not believe I have heard of many couples including it in the past twenty years or so.”
Harry opened his eyes slightly, looking up into Draco’s, “show me?” he questioned, his voice a drunken whisper.
When they reached the outside of Harry’s room Hermione was standing talking to one of the healers, looking frantic. The moment she saw Draco her eyes brightened “He’s here now. Can you please tell us what’s going on now?”
Harry hesitated, his instincts to help a father get to his son waring against his distrust of Draco. Finally, Harry dropped his wand to his side, his eyes fluttering shut as he let out a sigh. "Fine. We'll go get him."
Ginny's lips pursed together, and she took a deep breath, "You know what Harry? That’s really what you think of me? I don't care. Go to Grimmauld, I'll bring the boys to you. I'm not going to sit here and argue with you, it's bad for the baby."
Astoria sat back, her face flushed. Her voice broke slightly as she whimpered. “I can’t. He’s a muggle, and I’m a fool for getting involved with him in the first place. He offered a world full of wonder, and excitement, and I thought it would be a fun distraction from my responsibilities. I never thought it would make it harder for me to get into my life.”
Draco was looking forward to a pleasant lie in on Saturday morning, but instead he was met with an enthusiastic Hermione Granger-Weasley walking into his bedroom at seven in the morning and shaking him awake.
Draco thought for a moment before standing “Well, if she’s free this Saturday then I don’t care how unsuitable she is I’d like to take her out. Who is she anyways?”
The sight on the other side of the door was not what Harry was expecting. Draco was seating on the floor, cross legged. His back was straight, and his hands rested palm up on his knees. Though he didn’t open his eyes or turn his head, Draco’s brows rose lightly as he heard Harry walk through the door.
Claire shot Harry a quizzical look but Harry minutely shook his head, he could explain any questions she might have after their job was done. Harry hadn’t seen Draco much since the war had ended; they had exchanged pleasantries in the lift on the occasion that their paths had crossed but neither had sought the other out. Harry knew that Draco had gotten married, and he knew that Draco and his wife had a young son near Albus’ age. Though Harry wasn’t looking forward to spending an evening babysitting Draco in a safehouse, he was confident that they could be civil with each other for one night.
“We’re needed in conference room three immediately. Big raid, all teams on call.” Claire said in a rush, grabbing Harry’s arm and dragging him along. Energy was radiating from Claire’s entire body, her black bun bobbing on her head as adrenaline pumped through her veins. Harry smiled at her enthusiasm, trying to remember the last time he had been that excited for a raid. At 26 Harry was far from old, but with two boys under three at home it was hard to muster the same fire and passion that had burned through him so brightly at the close of the war.
“I see.” Narcissa said thoughtfully as she sipped her tea, “And did you feel that you had a better reason for marrying her?”
Harry turned back to read Ron’s letter, trying to think who the mole in their crew could be. He was looking so intensely at the letter that he didn't notice Draco come up and stand behind his seat.
Hermione nodded her head, “But Draco, he did still love you. He does still love you. Even when the potion was strongest, and he was at his craziest. Even in the hours before we took him to St. Mungo’s, he still loved you.”
When Draco finished speaking he stormed off, walking out the front door and heading down the block. Draco’s eyes started to prick as he kept walking, and he tried to speed up to calm the emotions storming through him. Draco broke into a slow jog, his bare feet hitting the pavement as his pajama pants tangled around his legs. He finally stopped and ducked into an alley, leaning against the wall and letting out a wail of despair.  “I can’t. I just can’t do this anymore” he muttered to himself.
“I must admit, I expected them to go with a much less traditional contract than they went with. The contract looks to be almost the same one that your father and I used back when we got betrothed almost thirty-five years ago. They are very insistent though that you go in for fertility testing before proceeding with the negotiations. They even asked that we do not use our family healer, and instead ask that you make an appointment with a specialist at St. Mungo’s.”
Harry had a few hours before the raid was set to begin, so he quickly floo’d home so he could explain his absence to Ginny and gives the boys a kiss goodnight.
They embraced again and harry shouldered his pack, heading outside to wait for the portkey to activate. He watched the door swing closed behind him, and felt himself let out a shaky breath. He had no clue what he was about to walk into at home, but he did know he wasn’t looking forward to this conversation with Ginny.
Draco awoke the next morning to a soft tapping on his window. He opened the window and a small tawny owl flew in through it. Draco untied the parchment from his leg and began to read.
“You. Should. See. Your. Face.” She wheezed. “I’m sorry, I just had to let him in. It was so sweet.” She continued to laugh before looking up at Draco again, “He left a note.” She fished it out from behind her desk and handed it to Draco.
Harry sat in his chair, jaw tight, looking forward and refusing to acknowledge the pang of arousal he was feeling. Eventually he stood up and wandered over to the bookshelf, trying to find a distraction. Eventually, Draco came out of the bedroom looking far more attractive than any man had the right to look, Harry thought glumly. As night began to fall Harry made his way out to the kitchen to make dinner, hoping that Ron would find something soon to let him get out of this mess.
Draco glared at Harry, “She may have, though I imagine if the infamously oblivious Auror Potter could have come up with the idea right away she probably realized it wasn’t a safe hiding place. She may have gone to Argentina, to stay with an old family friend. She may be in Russia, avoiding extradition. She enjoys skiing so maybe she’s in Switzerland, though she’s also fond of sailing so maybe Greece instead? You don’t get it do you? She’s a young, beautiful, well-connected, rich witch who hasn’t burnt every social bridge there is to burn. She could be anywhere. My son… he could be anywhere and I may never find him.”
"That's the second time you called me Draco. Watch it Potter, I may start to think I mean something to you, between the random stalking and the being on a first name basis" Draco grinned as he pulled Harry's pants down, exposing his dripping member.
Draco gulped “I was engaged in a domestic romantic relationship with the partner of one of the suspects. We lived together for over a year, and it only ended recently, with help from the suspect” Draco’s face tried to flush in embarrassment, but he forced his breathing to remain steady.
“That sounds good.” Harry replied, heaving himself up off the couch. He grabbed his discarded shirt, and walked back to the bedroom, feeling both elated at what had happened and apprehensive of the following day.
“So before we go, I just have to ask,” Harry hesitated, “is this a date? Or are we just going out as friends? It’s fine, either way, whichever you want. I just want to know so I don’t make any mistakes.”
“You didn’t ask, sir, and I didn’t think it mattered who it was, just that it was a cause for recusal.” Draco responded evenly.
Harry walked over to the door, opening it behind Ron to shout back at him, "WELL I GUESS YOU THOUGHT WRONG!" He yelled after Ron before slamming the door again and placing the required locking charms on it. Harry stormed over to the couch and threw himself back against it, his whole body trembling in anger.
Draco stuttered for a moment. “I’m sure her reasons are her own. Even in disgrace, the Malfoy name means wealth and power, it’s a strong allure to any witch.”
Draco rolled his eyes, “Fine.” He said nastily, “If that’s the way you want it, that’s the way you’ll have it. But, I happen to think I could use some stress relief, so if you’re not going to provide that I’m going to go to the bedroom and have a wank.” He stood up and walked towards the hallway, before turning looking back at Harry who was steadfastly refusing to look Draco in the eyes, “If you change your mind, feel free to join me.” He said before walking off into the bedroom.
Harry felt his heart drop through his stomach, of course that’s why Draco was acting so peculiar. When Ginny sent over the divorce paperwork the night before, they’d been waiting for a response to Draco’s theory on who was helping Astoria. Draco must have been driving himself crazy knowing there was a letter waiting for Harry while Harry was sleeping. Harry felt a large missive of guilt as he walked to the inbox, and lifted up a letter from Ron.
Ginny looked up at Harry, her eyes thoughtful behind her thick lashes, “What if you didn't go back to Grimmauld?” She asked cautiously.
“Aye. And a mighty fine one he’s been.” Robard’s face shadowed, “I know 'bout the problems you two had in the past, and it doesn’t matter now. You’re one of our best, and we need you on your A-game tonight. Take all of your issues and bury them, if they stop you from doing your job tonight you won’t have a job to worry about in the morning. Am I making myself clear?” Robards looked down thunderously at Harry.
Astoria’s face hardened slightly. “You’re a pureblood wizard, I’m a pureblood witch. If I don’t marry you, I’ll have to marry someone else. You’re as good as any other option.”
"Hickeys?" Harry asked angrily, his voice raising three octaves to a shrill whine, "Malfoy is appearing covered in bruises and you want to just dismiss them as hickeys?"
“I thought so too. She wanted us to get back together.” Harry sighed sadly and poured himself another drink.
Astoria straightened her back, her face hard, “Draco, I’m still your best choice. Don’t throw this away. Please.”
Draco looked at Harry carefully before lowering his arms, his posture straightening, “I don't know much. Astoria, well… We weren't as close as we could have been. She spends most of her free time with Daphne. Her family's doesn't have many properties, though she still has access to all of the Malfoy vacation homes if she was willing to risk that.”
“Keep your back straight, and face your palms up.” Draco said, practically purring as Harry complied. “Now close your eyes.”
Forty minutes later Draco was regretting showing up to work that morning. One of the potions dealers was well known and the aurors had had their eyes on her for a while, the other was more of a surprise, a man with a so-far spotless record. The supplies were less of a surprise, both had minor records. The real surprise, which caused the Head Auror to be immediately called in and was leading to the main cause of Draco’s cringe was the names of the Aurors involved, told under Veritaserum. The first was Senior Auror Geoffrey Michaels, 25 years on the force and multiple service awards. The second was Auror Jacob Compton, 3 years on the force and partner to Auror Harry James Chosen One Potter.
The fire flared green and Harry perked up with anticipation and relief. He was expecting to see Robards or another familiar face, perhaps even Ron who was on desk-duty for the six months after Rose had been born but who had been called into to help process the extra paperwork from the raid.  Instead, an unknown wizard with a bright red mask lept out of the fire, wand drawn. The unknown assailant fired off a quick stupify which Harry jumped up and countered.
Looking around frantically, Harry finally found a small hole in the cliff face, that when he put his hand inside turned into a door that he could pull open.  "Finally!" Harry exclaimed in relief, his high voice startling Draco out of staring blankly at the ground.
Attached at the bottom of the page with a sticking charm was a ring Draco hadn’t seen in over a year. It was a golden band, with an emerald line and ruby line weaving around each other. On the inside were the Potter and Malfoy Crests, set to intertwine and create a small indent of the crests on the finger, so that even after the ring was taken off the indent of the crests would remain. Draco had commissioned the piece before their first anniversary, placing it inside the watch that he was giving Harry.
“It's good I'm not willing to try to make it work with my wife? Good I'm not willing to see if I can make it so my kids grow up in one house, with both parents?” Harry slurred out, his voice rising.
He pet her hair, and whispered gently, “I’m sorry Gin. I’m sorry. You just… you asked for a divorce, and I wanted to make sure. I’m sorry.” He continued to hold her while she cried, finally walking her backwards to the couch and encouraging her to sit next to him.
Two weeks after Lily was born and Harry and Ginny both felt like zombies. They'd taken Lily to a healer who said there was nothing medically wrong with her, which was both good news and bad. It was unfortunate, because neither of them were really sure what she needed to stop crying.
“Fuck.” Draco panted, enthralled with the sight of Harry’s mouth pressed up against Draco’s curls. “Fuck Harry, I’m so close”.
It took them a few minutes to come back to their senses. Draco sat up first and let out a laugh, “Well that was an unexpected turn from how I expected this afternoon to go.”
"I'm just saying, that sounds like an odd place for random bruises Harry. I think there's probably a perfectly good explanation for this and it's likely none of your business." Hermione snapped in exasperation.
When Ron finally arrived, it was rather amusing. Because of all of the protective spells on the safe house, Ron was unable to portkey directly inside. He ended up outside next to the same cliff that Harry and Draco had stood by so many weeks ago. Harry could hear Ron fumbling around out there, trying different spells and enchantments to make the house reveal itself. Eventually, Harry took pity, walking over the entrance, disarming the specialized locking charm on the door, and swinging it open.
Harry approached Draco, placing his wand up against Draco's chin, "I just abandoned my partner, possibly let her die, to protect you." Harry's voice has dropped lower than Draco ever heard it before, more a hissed whisper than anything else, "That floo was only accessible from the Auror department of the ministry which means either the department has been compromised or this is all just a set up orchestrated by you. Until I know which, there's no way you're wandering loose."
“My point” Kathryn continued, hardening her voice, “Is that putting away a small potions dealer is hardly worth your time. Not when you could drop the charges and in return he could give you a much larger smuggling ring, and name some dirty aurors who allow this ring to thrive”
Harry could feel the weariness of the long day through his bones. Doing a quick sweep of the house, he realized that the only bedroom was the one that Draco now occupied and quickly resigned himself to sleeping on the couch. Casting a quick spell to wake him if any letters were received he closed his eyes and fell fast asleep.
Harry threw his head back, his veins on fire with arousal, “Fuck… Yeah, I can see where he might not feel comfortable with you doing this.”
Astoria glared at Draco, “I already made my decision. I’m marrying you, and we’re going to have children and eventually I’ll forget Marc and you’ll forget Harry and we’ll be happy.”
Draco nodded his head, his face relaxing again. “Okay.” Draco said, his eyes suddenly brightening with determination, “I’m ready.” He said, nodding again.
Draco continued to glare at Pansy, “I never said that. I just think that what Astoria and I have decided is our business, not yours”. He said through gritted teeth.
As the three settled into the couches, Narcissa looked at Draco expectantly “So I read that you had a difficult case yesterday.”
Harry growled, “I don’t even know. I’m going to guess she sent the divorce papers to scare me into coming home and now that that didn’t work she decided to try a different technique”.
“I don’t know what’s going on, but I think the raid was supposed to end over an hour ago. If you two want to rest, I can wait up and wake you up when we finally get the call to head over.” Harry said.
Head Barrister Krones looked at Draco with slight concern “Your leave request is granted. Go to court tomorrow and then take a couple of weeks off.” He sighed in a way which almost resembled a growl “Just try to avoid making a habit of cohabitating with criminals will you?”
Harry started morosely at the letters, trying to figure out how to respond to Ginny. He wasn't shocked that she'd moved his things out of the house, they'd been fighting non-stop since Albus was born. A part of him wondered if this just gave her the excuse she'd been looking for to leave. Harry folded up Ginny’s letter and out it in his pocket. There was nothing he could say to her that wouldn't make her angrier, and there was really no point in responding. He had his orders, he was stuck in the safehouse until they knew who in the Auror Corp was helping Astoria. He couldn’t leave now, even if he was willing to quit, not knowing they didn’t have another Auror to come and protect Draco.
Harry growled, he was done thinking. He stood up, walking down the hallway. He reached the bedroom door and steeled himself. The little voice rose up again,
Draco finally opened his eyes, his smile turning predatory. He surveyed Harry, standing at the door breathing hard, “What else would I have meant?” He asked, his voice sultry and low, “Have you ever tried meditation? It just frees up your mind so well.”
“Trust me Draco, no one wishes this baby was here more than I do, but until she comes there’s no reason for me to be at home worrying instead of at work being productive” Hermione rubbed her stomach absentmindedly “So does having you home mean that we have one more for dinner tonight, or are you and Harry taking a night together?”
Harry’s brain stuttered, Draco’s teeth grazing against his neck making him lose control of his thoughts as he groaned. His hands stroked up Draco’s thighs to his waist.
“He’s still my godson. Since I’m not working during the time period I really think it would make more sense for me to take care of him.”
“Of course I came. What happened? I thought he was suspended from work?” Draco snapped. The thought of his idiotic ex being able to get severely injured even without evil wizards throwing curses at him was rather aggravating to Draco.
Draco sat down and Harry finished re-setting the wards before he sat down on the armchair situated nearest to Draco. Harry aimed his wand towards the kitchen, summoning a tea tray for them. The tray flew out of the kitchen and onto the coffee table, pouring three cups. Draco picked up one of the cups nervously, making frequent glances to the fireplace as he awaited the call from the ministry.
Draco took another sip of his drink, trying to remain detached, “He’s certainly shown me a side of him I’ve never seen before. I’m almost relieved though, maybe if he understands he’ll leave me alone.”
“Harry doesn’t abuse potions!” Ron started in outrage, “He won’t even take dreamless sleep because he was worried about getting addicted!”
“I’ll have your lease by the end of the day. Your priority list is ridiculous though, I hope you know that” Pansy said with a pointed look.
Lucius stared to stand “If that is your wish than we are happy to help you achieve it son. Now, let us head in to dinner and your mother can tell you all about the new villa she wants to purchase in Millan.”
"I miss being a seeker. 8th years aren't allowed on the house teams, so I thought maybe you missed it too."
Harry smirked, “I never said great… Though I might if you get me a refill.” He held up his empty glass, his eyes slightly glassy from the already consumed scotch.
“Was it that you’ve been in love with Draco Malfoy since we were 11 and that’s why you can’t stop following him around?” Ron asked grumpily as he reached for breakfast.
Ginny pursed her lips but didn't respond, and Harry went over to the Floo. He arrived at Grimmauld to find the house dark, and quickly turned the lights on in the kitchen so he could pour himself a drink. Draco found him half an hour and six shots of whiskey later.
“Talk about what Potter? The fact you called me Draco or the fact that I kissed you and completely rocked your world?”
Draco huffed and rolled his eyes, “I trust you. Okay? I asked if you could be the one to extract me because I knew you wouldn’t let the fact I was a Death Eater stop you from saving me.”
Harry let out a billowing laugh, wrapping his arms around Ginny in a tight hug. “Will do. Now, off to bed.”
“Draco, look who I ran into earlier? What a coincidence right? I invited them to join us, you know I never get to see Daphne enough anymore now that she’s living in Hogsmead.” Pansy’s smile was just a bit too bright, and her tone overly enthusiastic enough to make Draco narrow his eyes. He was positive that Pansy hadn’t spoken to Daphne since her wedding seven years before, and he was rather suspicious that she magically appeared at lunch with them less than two weeks after Draco and Astoria had been announced to be negotiating a betrothal.
Well, thank you everyone for reading my first fic! I hope you enjoyed it, please feel free to leave your thoughts and critics below.
I’ve know you for almost 20 years, you’ve never called me Draco before.” His voice was sing-songy in his taunt.
Harry stopped, the world around him freezing as his brain tried to comprehend what Ginny had just said. He tried to open his mouth and question her, but his vocal cords seemed frozen. After a few moments had passed he finally was able to stutter out "ba...baby?"
Draco got up from the table flanked by Theo and Blaise and headed up the doors to leave for Hogsmeade. Harry quickly stood and raced after Draco, catching them if the courtyard, "What time are we meeting up for that drink today?" He asked breathlessly.
Harry clutched at Draco's hips, thrusting against him. They chased their orgasms, frotting together in a hurried pace. Egged on by weeks apart, they didn't take long to find their release.
Harry gave a quick laugh at the image of Draco being bitten by the peacock before quickly trying to cover it as a cough. “I’m sure we’ll find them before he’s four. The Aurors have their best teams working on this, I’m sure they’ll find them.”
Draco shook his head fiercely, “There’s no other way. And besides, this’ll be good. I’ll get to start over. Just me and Scorp. We can be whoever we want to be.”
Harry became aware that Ginny was sliding her hand up his thigh. He didn't know what to do, they'd been separated for almost a year and it almost felt foreign to feel her petite hands on him instead of Draco's thick ones. He thought of Draco, and his stomach dropped. When Ginny leaned forward and tried to kiss him, Harry gently pushed her away.
Harry smiled lightly, "Thanks Gin. I am sorry I was gone so long, and I'm sorry I didn't write. I missed you and the boys a lot, and I was always thinking of you."
Draco stood up and pulled Harry up with him. Draco put his hands on Harry’s hips and pulled him in for a bruising kiss, trying to convey all his love and passion through his lips. Harry melted into the kiss, the tension leaving his body as he wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck. Finally, Draco pulled away from the kiss and moved back, taking a deep breath and opening his eyes.
Hope y'all enjoyed that fluff back there. Buckle up for the hot mess express that this fic is about to become.
Harry started, his breath catching in surprise when he felt Draco’s kiss before his brain seemed to catch up to what was happening. Suddenly, it clicked how good Draco felt, and Harry began enthusiastically moving his own lips against Draco’s. Draco quickly deepened the kiss, his mouth opening and his tongue probing at Harry’s lip seeking entrance. Harry opened his mouth, a flash of desire running through him as he pulled Draco to him. Harry’s hands slowly moved down Draco’s body, his hand searing Draco’s skin and sending him into action.
Ron grinned at him and pulled his traveling chess set out of his pocket. “I always fancy a chance to beat you.”
Harry was feeling nauseous, but he couldn't tell if it was from the pull off the portkey or from the feat of facing Ginny. He looked up at his home, a cute little house they'd purchased together right after they were married, with three bedrooms, two baths, and a fenced in yard. Harry felt unsure of how to enter, remembering that Ginny had sent all of his belongings to Grimmauld place. He couldn't bring himself to knock, so finally after much deliberation Harry closed his hand over the door handle and pushed himself through.
Harry finally spotted Draco on the top floor, “and go,” he signaled quietly as he pulled Claire’s arm to side-along her to right behind where Draco stood. As silently as possible, Harry grabbed Draco and dragged him back towards him, tensing and hoping Draco would remember to be silent. Waiting until the other Auror’s were in place, Harry quickly nodded to Claire before wrapping his arms around Draco and side-alonging him to a safehouse they could use to floo to the ministry from.
Narcissa and Lucius both raised their eyebrows at that “Am I correct in understanding that you want me to enter you into a marriage betrothal with another pureblood family?” Narcissa asked.
Draco nodded, before turning away back to his book. Harry took that as his signal to leave, and slipped out the door with Ron right at his heels. He got to the front door, and looked over at Ron.
“Fuck” Draco moaned before attacking Harry’s neck, biting down where he felt Harry’s pulse. “Can I touch you?” He asked, his voice high pitched with need.
Harry awoke the next morning with a pounding headache to Scorpius wailing. At first Harry tried to ignore him, figuring Draco would see to him in a moment, but after a couple of minutes he made his way out of bed to check on the boy.
Draco shuddered, putting his lips to Harry’s neck and biting gently. “You have no clue how hot it makes me to hear you say my name.”
“We don’t know what sort of potion he was taking. We can tell from his blood that there was Ashwinder eggs and Occamy eggshells in the potion, but we can’t read all of the ingredients or tell how they were altered. There are certain ingredients and methods which could counteract with the magical coma, possibly preventing us from waking Auror Potter up again later. There’s also a risk that his magic will fight against the coma and possibly lash out. We just can’t know right now. What we do know is that right now his magic is acting out and it could kill him.”
Draco chuckled throatily, “It’s been a long time since the last time a man said that to me, Potter.”
Draco snorted and tossed the letter to the bed, readying himself for the day. Pansy read over the letter and looked at him in confusion “Goddaughter?”
The portkey landed in a wooded area next to a high cliff, with the wind blowing harshly against them. The faint light was barely bright enough to make out where they were, and Harry quickly lit a lumos on his wand, lifting it into the air to get a sense of their surroundings, confusion slowly dawning on his face. Harry kept on glancing nervously at Draco, who stood almost lifelessly beside him, as he searched for an indication of where the safehouse was.
"Yes, Potter. I'd tell you. Now I'm fine, I'm going to get back to my shower and then I'm going back to my room. Have a nice night."
Harry found himself closing the distance between them, his hand reaching out for Draco’s arm. “It hasn’t been all awful, being here.”
I've tried a different formatting on this chapter to make it easier to read, I'll go back and edit the first chapter when I'm able. This is my first story, so please let me know if it's not easy to read.
“I can stay on the original case until he testifies to the judge as per the plea agreement. After that, I’d like to request to take two weeks leave while the investigation continues.” Draco swallowed “I think it would be best for me to be out of the office during this case.” Draco closed his eyes thoughtfully, “I am having a lot of trouble reconciling my previous partner with the accusations in this case.”
Draco rolled his eyes, "I'm in a fideloused safe house hidden inside of a cliff. How much safer can I get?"
Draco was quiet for a moment before saying softly, "I wish I could go back and change that for you. But I can't. All I can do is promise I’ll back off and leave you alone."
“That’s ridiculous” Draco wanted to set the article on fire. It was so unlike the Harry he knew, who had worked hard to keep his personal life out of the newspaper. That he had been willing to out himself to the press, confess his relationship with Draco, and talk about his new boyfriend was crazy to Draco, and all over some imagined vendetta. “What do I do to fix this?” Draco asked nervously.
Draco fell silent, his eyes tearing up. “I’m going to go to bed now.” He hesitated at the hallway, looking back at Harry, “Potter… Thank you… For believing in me.”
Harry rubbed his hand up and down on Ginny's back, trying to sooth her. He started muttering apologies, trying to calm her. Eventually, her crying stopped and she stepped back, looking at him.
It’s not like Draco’s marriage meant anything at this point. She was off with some lover, and as soon as she was caught Draco was going to divorce her. No. Draco’s marriage really shouldn’t be a factor to Harry, he thought firmly.
Harry looked at Draco hesitantly before turning and immerging himself into the memory. Draco looked at him for a moment before turning around irritated and heading for the kitchen. If he was going to be awake early on a Sunday morning he was going to have a cup of tea with him.
Harry looked at the clock, it was only three, much too early to start cooking dinner. “Right. Well. I suppose I’ll just go read for a while then.”
Draco turned his head and pulled Harry in for a kiss, wrapping his hands around Harry’s neck and pulling Harry down on top of him. He ran his fingers through Harry’s wild hair, moaning as he felt Harry open his mouth and nervously meet their tongues together. Draco pulled Harry closer, suddenly remembering he was shirtless as he felt Harry’s body press against his own, Harry only clothed in his pants.
Harry stopped and stared at the messages, his face going pale. Outrage shook through him, and he balled up the letters and threw them away from him. He looked over at Draco, standing there watching him in alarm. Quickly, Harry walked over, putting his hand on Draco’s arm. “It’s okay. They haven’t found anything new yet. It was just… It was Ginny. She said she wants us to talk, and Ron is going to be trading places with me. Tomorrow morning”
"I. Uh. Well. You see…” Harry stared, unable to form words, "I was under the impression that Blaise was holding you down or something and you might need help." Harry stuttered out, his face turning a deep red.
Draco looked carefully at everything other than Harry, "I may have overheard you and the Weasel. Congratulations.... You know. On the baby."
Harry shook his head lightly, "No Malfoy. I'm not leaving you alone here. My family is fine. Gin and I have been having problems since Al was born, this might have been the catalyst but it's not the origin of our problems. The boys are fine. They're surrounded by family who loves them and care about them; I miss them but I'm here for you. Soon you'll be reunited with your son, and I'm get to go back home and see mine. Till then I'm here for you."
Harry's face hardened, “I don't think we have a chance, and I'm not willing to keep going back and forth. We made our decision, I think we need to just stick to it.”
The Auror looked at Draco carefully before saying “We’re investigating this three different ways right now, one possibility is that Auror Potter was not involved, and his sudden drug abuse has nothing to do with the smuggling ring. The next is that Potter was involved, and was willingly taking the potions. The third is that he was unwillingly taking them. You and Mrs. Granger-Weasley have both told us that his behavior didn’t become erratic until Auror Compton was arrested. We believe there’s a chance Mr. Potter was being drugged.”
“But you never told me you felt that way. You never told me that the way I was acting was hurting you.”
Two weeks had passed before they felt safe having the children all together again. The boys ran to Ginny in relief, and Harry snuggled Lily close to him. That afternoon Harry strapped Lily to his chest and Gin buckled Albus into a stroller and the five of them set off to a park together to play. By the time they got home and had dinner and bath time and Ginny tucked the boys into bed while Harry tried to get Lily down.
Draco swallowed for a moment, “Because you were the brightest part of my life, and having you around was like having my own personal sunshine, every second of every day.” He said hoarsely.
“You could have asked.” Draco responded bitterly. “You could have asked instead of attributing feelings to me that I didn’t feel. Again.”
“That's assuming she doesn't drive Ron and Hermione bonkers before that and they return her at midnight.” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
Draco closed the door behind him and Harry let out a groan of frustration. He couldn’t take this, waiting around in a very small safe house. Knowing that he could take twenty steps and be in that room, see Draco. He knew Draco would let him touch him, knew it would feel amazing to put his hands on Draco’s smooth flesh. Harry’s skin still felt the promise of more that he had felt when Draco had moved against him that night. Though he knew he made the responsible choice, he couldn’t get over questioning what would happen if Draco hadn’t fallen. How far would they have gone?
“I should go lie down.” Draco declared after a while, lifting his red rimmed eyes and blinking owlishly at the light around him.
“Careful. You’re making it hard to say goodbye.” Draco said with forced cheerfulness as he took his plate and a cup of coffee from Harry.
Draco continued to suck on Harry, reaching his hand around he began to caress Harry's balls. Harry's hands began to pull harder at Draco's hair as Draco sped up his pace.
“I appreciate that, but the only thing I need is to get back to work” Draco’s voice started to break, and he closed his eyes, slowing his breath to try to regain control. By the time that Draco opened his eyes again Hermione had left his office, and he looked the paperwork glumly. He hadn’t gotten any more work done by the time he had to head out to buy Pansy’s chocolate.
“You can be assured, I will never be enough of a masochist to want him back in my life.” Draco stood and offered her his arm, walking her to the floo in the lobby before returning to the waiting room.
Harry’s face paled and he looked up at Draco, “Stress relief.” He said blankly, “Right.” He felt his heart sink to his stomach, not sure if he could stand another few hours of being just one room away from Draco wanking.
Draco surged forward, unbuckling Harry’s jeans and pulling them down. He started mouthing at the head of Harry’s cock, licking the very tip. Harry’s legs clenched, and he reached down to thread a hand through Draco’s hair. Draco opened his mouth wider, wrapping his lips around Harry’s shaft and slowly working his way down.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief that his clue had possibly led them somewhere, before his eyes shuttered close as his thoughts began to overwhelm him. He wanted to be relieved, excited, but this was just another missing person to add to the list. Now not only were they looking for Scorpius, and Astoria, and the mole in the Aurors office, but now they were also looking for Theo. Draco exhaled slowly before opening his eyes, “Lisa Turpin, she was a Ravenclaw in our year, and Ernie McMillian, a puff. They were all family friends back when they were children, I’ve seen them together since we left Hogwarts too. I don’t know that Ernie would help Theo if he knew what was going on, but he might if he didn’t know the reason for it.”
Ron sighed, “She’s been released from the hospital. She’s on bedrest at home though. She’s been good about not letting anyone know she’s been injured, and we’re pretty sure nobody doubts the story that you two are in France still.”
Thinking she was referring to Draco being there, Harry rolled his eyes. “Grimmauld is my home now. The kids are perfectly safe there, Malfoy won't even be there that much longer.”
When he arrived at work Draco’s confusion only intensified. Opening the door to his office, he was met with the pungent smell of flowers. Walking through the door, every surface of Draco’s office was covered in flowers, lilacs, lilies, tulips, and roses. Draco immediately turned around and went up to the secretary’s desk, only to find the office secretary Rebecca doubled over in laughter.
Well, it appears from the comments on the last chapter that everyone is really mad at Harry right now. I wish I could say he's about to redeem himself with one of his normal acts of heroism but that would be a huge lie.
“I’m sure your healers will be very happy to know that.” Hermione said, her voice dripping with disapproval.
Harry frowned, “You’re not… not s’posed to be hurt. I’m supposed to protect you.” He slurred before standing up, leaning heavily against the arm of the couch for support as the room swam around him, “Can I get you anything? Ice?”
"I don't have proof yet," Harry replied, "but I asked him to play a seekers game with me tomorrow." Harry shot them a grin, "don't worry, once people see Malfoy and I hanging out they'll be nice to him."
"Not up to something no." Harry said thoughtfully, "I just ran into him in the hallway and he looked rather... tousled."
Harry set a quick monitoring charm on Scorpius and then went up to check on Draco. Guiltily, he worried that Draco might have started drinking when he came back from his walk and would be somewhere passed out. Each room he checked, his alarm grew worse and worse.
Harry's smile brightened, "they're good. Al got so big, and he's crawling like crazy. Won't surprise me if he starts walking soon. And James, he's so smart. I almost think he's able to control his accidental magic, he turned his Lima beans into jelly beans last night."
Harry hung his head, shame flaming his cheeks. “I didn’t think she wanted to hear from me, after that first letter telling me she’d moved my stuff out. Then the divorce papers. I’m not even really sure what’s left for me to say at this point.”
Harry freed the ropes holding Draco and linked hands to pull him up. "We go in, get him, and then we get out. We go to a safehouse linked to a fidelous charm, and we stay there till we know what happened. Until I hear evidence that you didn't set this up, I'm keeping your wand."
“It shook him up, realizing everything he’d thrown away. I don’t think it hit him till he saw the ring. I almost decked him, I mean, he’s always been a bit thick, but he’s never been this bad before.”
Harry pulled Draco in for another kiss, melting together, “I want to be yours, completely. I want you to know that I’m so fucking yours Draco.” Harry moaned, pushing his pants off before rolling Draco onto his back and climbing on top of him.
The next afternoon Draco canceled his healer’s appointment and instead floo called his mother, dreading the conversation that he knew he had to have. “Mother,” Draco called, “I need to speak with you quickly.”
Hermione put her hand on Draco’s shoulder and slowly pulled him into a hug. Gently, she said “I don’t think it matters what you say to him Draco, but I think he needs to hear from you. He’s scared, and he’s hurt, and he’s sad. Please just come talk to him.”
Harry crouched down to look at Draco, and then started very carefully, “No. I’m sorry. I love you so much Draco, but I’m tired. I’m tired of you not having time for me, of always wondering where I stand with you. I’m tired of nights where I’m on stake-out or out working and I’m missing you and then I come home and find out you’ve been busy and haven’t missed me at all. Then you go away for weeks and I’m just here alone. I’m sorry Draco, but I can’t keep doing this.”
Harry rolled his eyes and went and sat down on the couch, “Ron’s not that bad. Besides, you’ve managed to get on well enough with one of your past nemeses, why not two?”
“I dunno. I’m not sure what they have planned. But I’ll try. Do you… Do you want me to try to come back?”
Draco poured himself another drink, and tried to take a calming breath, but as he exhaled he slowly broke down, crying into Harry's shoulder without the comprehension of who he was holding onto. Harry thought back to the last time he had seen Draco cry, in the bathroom in sixth year. He held Draco closer to him, glad to be able to offer comfort instead of pain this time around. Harry rubbed his hand down Draco’s back and tried offering platitudes until Draco's sobbing lessened and he stopped trembling.
Thank you all for your comments and kudos! I've only got two chapters left to write, and they're already outlined, so hopefully I'll be able to stick to this two chapters per week posted till it's done!
Harry showed Ron the kitchen, explained the grocery ordering, and went back to the bedroom to say goodbye to Draco. Much to Harry’s frustration, Ron followed him into the room at his heels. Ron surveyed the room by the doorway, while Harry made his way over to Draco who was lying with a forced casualness on his bed.
Draco narrowed his eyes slightly, his voice dropping, “Well there’s some things I just enjoy with you that I don’t think I’ll want to be doing with the Weasel.”
Harry's mind froze, and he gaped at her. They had agreed to a divorce, recognized that they didn't make each other happy anymore. Sure, the past six weeks they'd been a good team, but they'd both been off work. There'd been no late nights in the office, no emergency meetings interfering with plans, no obligations. Nine months ago these words were all Harry wanted to hear, but now it was too late, right?
Ron looked at Harry as if about to argue before shrugging and returning his attention to his plate, "Do what you want Mate. Merlin knows what good it'll do you though."
“Brilliant. If you tell his doctor what was in it, it could help. They’re having too much trouble stabilizing him right now, this could really help him!” Draco exclaimed.
Harry let out a bitter laugh, “Ah yes, you can have me. Don't worry Draco, you have me. I’m so ridiculously into you, in love with you, and you're going to leave me in a month. Glad you can be happy I'm not reconciling with my wife because it means you can enjoy another month of fucking me.”
After Draco and Ron had their drinks in hand they sat down on a bench, and Ron looked up at Draco with a smirk. “So tell me all about Astoria. What’s she like?”
Draco’s head came back as he eyed Claire apprehensively before finally shaking her outstretched hand, “Nice to meet you Auror Sparks,” Draco said stiffly, “Thank you for getting me out of there safely.”
“Gentleman,” Draco put out his hand to shake as they came in, “Please take a seat. Can I offer you any water or tea?”
“Just this week” Harry stopped. “I’m sorry. I should have waited and broken things off with you, but you didn’t have time for us to talk about it and it just sort of happened”
Harry looked away, his eyes darting towards the hallway, “Well. It might take a while to go to trial…. It should all be squared away by the end of next year though.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed, “I’m serious, Ron. His son is missing and he hasn’t seen him in a month. Think of how you would feel if that was Rose. Cut him some slack.”
“Probably less of a workaholic than the woman who's due date was two days ago yet is still here at work”
“Is that so?” Astoria asked teasingly, raising her voice slightly “Does that mean I should tell my father to go ahead with the bethrothal contract?” Before Draco had a chance to even think about giving her an answer Astoria pulled Draco into an intense kiss, wrapping her arms around his neck and moaning lightly. As she released him from her kiss she moved her mouth to his ear and whispered “The press is watching, say yes”
Draco rolled his eyes before plonking down on the chair by the couch, and folded his arms behind his head, “So what does he want you to find out?”
“Barely.” Draco said, giving a quick glance up before turning back to his parchment, “Married an American wizard and moved there for a time, but found the culture too restrictive. She’s been back ‘on vacation’ for two years now, but they visit each other regularly enough to not quite be considered separated.”
When Draco arrived at the reception area Ron was waiting to greet Draco with baby Rose cooing in his arms.
Draco was touched that Ron had come out to see him, and a big smile broke out on his face. “Alright then, let’s head to the pub.”
The two worked the rest of class in relative silence, Harry continuing to make furtive glances at Draco's arm and Draco pretending not to notice. Draco's mood continued to darken through class, and when their potion was finally done he pulled his sleeves down and started throwing things in his bag. "Well, this was certainly a fun experience Potter. Maybe we should try working together again in another 7 or 8 years." Draco growled.
Harry stopped for a moment, considering before nodding his head. “Yeah. You can write me at any point.”
Harry knocked on Draco’s door, holding a box of chocolates and looking more nervous than Draco had ever seen him.
Harry looked up at Draco, blinking wildly, the totality of what had just happened crashing over him. “I can’t believe we did that.”
Draco huffed, “I’m not sure what you have to be so nervous about. It’s not like you’re about to get a new roommate who you spent your entire childhood tormenting.”
Draco walked off, his hips swaying slightly. As he reached the door to the bedroom he turned back to look at Harry, “You’re still free to join me, anytime.” He said with a smile.
Afterwards Harry rested his head on Draco's shoulder, breathing in his familiar scent and allowing his heart rate to return to normal. Finally, he shoved himself back into his trousers and went to take a seat on a chair.
Harry was shaking, his entire focus on the wicked things Draco was doing to his cock. He tried to hold his orgasm off, but he couldn’t. He stuttered to Draco, telling him he was close with barely enough warning before he felt himself explode in Draco’s mouth. Draco swallowed him down, keeping Harry’s prick in his mouth as his throat filled with cum. He gave himself a couple more strokes, until he too was shuddering his release.
Draco took his without remark, heading over to the living room and sitting on the left side of the couch. Harry followed Draco into the room, taking the other side of the couch and beginning to eat in silence. Finally, when Harry had finished he couldn’t take the silence anymore and he turned to Draco and tried to catch his eye.
"You know what?" Harry said, pointing at the map where Draco was being backed into a corner by Blaise, "I think he does need to be saved. I think that the other Slytherins are hurting him to secure their place on the pecking order, and I'm not going to stand for it." Harry threw his invisibility cloak around his shoulders and stormed out of the common room before Ron or Hermione had a chance to object.
Harry rolled his eyes, “They’re working as hard as they can to find the mole and find Astoria. That’s their priority right now, and they’ll keep me on this assignment until this case is solved. It doesn’t matter who I am.”
The next morning as Draco was getting ready for work he decided to indulge Ron and sent Astoria an owl asking her to meet him for lunch. As Draco sat down at his desk he began to take out a case folder when he was met with an otter patronus “Draco, I’m sorry, but we need you to come to St. Mungo’s immediately. You’re still Harry’s medical power of attorney and they need you.” Hermione’s voice sounded distraught.
“I’ll be fine. I think I could use some time alone.” Draco reached around and put a hand on Pansy’s shoulder, squeezing slightly. “Thank you for finding this apartment. It appears to be the perfect place to wallow and move on.”
Robards had come to visit Harry twice through the week. They had agreed to a week on/week off protection detail. They had uncovered the mole on the department, her name was Louanne Muldoon, a transfer from the American Auror corps the previous year. Although the mole had been uncovered and the other Aurors were vetted, Robards still did not want to identify Draco as an informant under protection until Astoria and Nott were in custody. The team tracking Astoria believed they had pinpointed her location, and Robards had assured Harry that Draco should have Scorpius by the end of the week.
Harry sat in confusion for a moment before wrestling his pants and trousers back up. He stayed in a daze all the way back up to Gryffindor tower, finally collapsing into bed.
Ginny started to cry, her face pressed into Harry's chest. "I am angry with you Harry. You left. You just left and it's been weeks."
Alright everyone, there's the end!! Thank you so much for everyone who's read this, and stayed with it through all of my technology problems. I've loved and appreciated all the support and encouraging comments throughout.
"But. But what about all the bruises? The fingerprint ones on your arm and the bright ones on your hip." Harry asked, continuing to stare at Draco without even a sidelong look of acknowledgement to Blaise.
Draco’s face softened, “It was the only option. For my son, and the life I want for him, he needs me to be an example for good.”
"Merlin Draco, that mouth means everything to me right now," Harry shuttered as Draco swallowed him down.
"Potter. What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?" Draco screeched as he pulled his trousers up, turning to buckle them.
Harry quickly found the hole on the cliff side, turning the handle and coming across the locked entrance. He broke the locking enchantments and met Ron holding his wand up towards him. Harry quickly muttered his identification phase, and Ron responded in kind before lowering his wand and reaching forward to embrace Harry in a hug. Harry looked behind Ron, expecting to see Draco on the couch, but he was nowhere in sight.
Harry smiled back, “Of course Gin. There was no question, here with the kids is where I want to be.”
Draco was back at work the following morning, writing memos on his cases quietly in his office before Head Barrister Krones knocked on his door.  “There’s some Aurors here to see you Barrister Malfoy. Should I show them in or should I send them away?”
“Merlin, you feel amazing” Harry groaned out as he watched Draco sink his mouth further down onto his cock. Harry was in absolute awe watching Draco, dazzled by the sensuality that was oozing off him. Harry was no virgin, but every sensation was startling to him. His prick was harder than it had been in ages, and it took everything in him not to start thrusting deep into Draco’s velvety mouth.
Finally, the fear that Harry had refused to think about came crashing down. Last night, after they'd fought, Draco had left without his wand to get some air- and he'd not yet come back.
Draco’s eyes glinted, his hand reaching out and moved his rook, “check” he smiled, blinding Harry with the brightness in his look.
“Currently they scheduled it seven weeks from the original date. So. About eight weeks from now.” Harry said apologetically.
Pansy sat there slack jawed “Draco. Are you alright? What happened? Do you need some time to think about this?” Though Pansy had never approved of Draco and Harry’s relationship, finding Harry’s excessive request for privacy to be a red-flag she couldn’t ignore, Draco knew that her concern for him was genuine.
