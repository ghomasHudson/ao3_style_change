“You read,” said Harry.
When Potter finally took his cock into his mouth, drawing him deep so that his nose touched Draco’s blonde curls, Draco moaned in pleasure. He was so far gone now that Potter may never be able to draw him back out of the rabbit hole. But then Potter was sucking and licking, and the way his cheeks hollowed around his cock made Draco warm with heat but also something else; something, that if he’d been with anyone other than Potter, he would have described as love and appreciation.
Harry shook his head. “I’ve worn it every day for ten years,” he said quietly. “I usually glamor it so you don’t notice, but today I finally felt that you were ready to see it.”
“Not yet,” says Draco, a bright flush rising in his neck. “But you have no idea how much I want you.”
Laughing, Draco continued to tease Harry, gently nipping and sucking at his thighs until he deemed it appropriate to take Harry’s whole length into his mouth. By this time, Harry was a rambling mess.
Draco glowered at the onslaught of sudden heat and dry weather, shielding his eyes from the oppressively bright sunshine. “You never moved them back to London?”
to do that, but José interrupted him again.
“That works,” said Draco in relief. “I’m not sure I could look at that thing anymore without wanting to wrench my eyes out of their sockets.”
Something was strange about the whole situation when Draco really thought about it. He remembered the way Potter easily joked about being attracted to another man and, one thing leading to another, wondered if Potter could possibly have feelings for him. A grimacing smile stole across his face at the thought. Potter, in love with
“That was fantastic,” Mike agreed, looking off into the distance fondly.
They froze together, still nude, in the cool summer night before agreeing to hurriedly throw clothes on. Somehow, it was even more satisfying to put Harry’s clothes back on after the man had just helped him to take them off.
“He speaks!” mocked Finnigan. “Aw, poor Malfoy—am I hurting your feelings?”
like Ron.” She rolled her eyes.
“I don’t need to explain myself to any of you,” Zee said cruelly. “Good luck winning games without me.” He started making his way off of the field, shrugging off the team’s stoic glares. “And Nate?” he called from the dugout, one last sneer on his face. “Fuck you.”
“Oh, right,” said Hermione nervously. She went to uncork the bottle with a trembling hand, but Draco stepped in.
“I could be persuaded into seconds,” Draco admitted, shifting uncomfortably under Mr. Weasley’s touch.
“Bro, you don’t have to be like that,” said Jake, stung.
“No, not really,” admitted Potter reluctantly. “All the traveling I did was related to hunting Voldemort.”
“What does he have to be cryptic about, Harry?” queries Hermione. “Did anything happen tonight that you want to talk about?”
“Rictusempra!” yelled the female Hufflepuff as the crowd jeered. Though Draco was still frozen, he could feel a thousand tickles happening simultaneously all over his body. It was torturous, not being able to scratch. He wasn’t muted, and noises of helplessness escaped him.
He walked outside, burying his hands in his robe pockets and making a beeline for Dumbledore’s tomb. It was cold and dark, which was soothing after everything he’d been through. Rather than shrieks and burning, it was calm and quiet. Once Harry reached the cool white marble, he didn’t delay. Whispering a spell to open the top, Harry took the Elder Wand and returned it to Dumbledore’s grasp, who was so still and calm in death he might have been sleeping. Though the implications were peaceful, Harry felt unbearably sad. Now, more than ever, he was alone. His parents and Sirius were already gone, but in the Final Battle, Tonks, Remus, Fred, and countless others had fallen as well. On top of that, Ron and Hermione’s relationship seemed inevitable. They’d been dancing around each other for far too long, but still he worried that he’d become an inconvenience and that the friendship they’d built would never be easy again.
After a long while, Potter wiped his face and turned to Draco. His eyes were just the slightest bit bloodshot and had the beginning of dark bags underneath them.
She gazed at him incredulously, and Harry was instantly reminded of how he, at eleven years old, knew that Professor McGonagall was not a person to cross. This was probably something he would have done well to remember.
His dance moves had improved since the Yule Ball, but he was initially quite concerned about dancing with Malfoy. Surely he’d had posh dancing lessons as a boy?
“Come off it, Potter,” Draco sighed, sitting up and grabbing for a towel to wipe off the excess lube. “There are talented people in the DADA program, but you’re one of the best."
“Were you going to cover me and Ron from a distance?”
“Also,” said Cale, who had been largely quiet up until now. “It’s a great team building opportunity for us, as well. During summer ball, we all usually drift apart.”
The fool had the audacity to stand up and point his wand directly at Draco’s face. It was slightly unnerving to be entirely at the mercy of a reckless Gryffindor, but Draco found himself hoping Finnigan actually went through with it and hexed him because that would justify his reaction. Draco remained seated, though he stared daggers at Finnigan, just daring him to attack.
“You’ve slept with someone since Hermione?” Harry asked. “That’s news to me.”
“What exactly
,” hissed Dolohov, clutching his knee in a futile effort to stop the blood.
“Yes, Potter. Exactly what I intend to do. See you next week.” Draco makes to Disapparate, but Harry latches onto him for the second time.
“Master Draco, you need to come on!” Harry said.
“Shit,” Harry flung, fishing out his cell and searching his contacts for Malfoy’s number. The posh bastard answered on the third ring, too. Harry had been half hoping he wouldn’t answer at all.
He scowled. Granger had to be motivated by something other than simple
Drawn back into thought, Draco answers, “I’m two years in with one more to go. But next semester will actually be pretty exciting because I get to start teaching.”
“I thought so too,” Harry answered, picking his head up from where it was buried in Draco’s chest and kissing him.
“Wonderful. So how can I fix this?”
“I can get onboard with that.”
Hermione waited patiently as Draco went to find parchment and a quill (he was forced to leave her favorite safely in the drawer) and sat back down, lost in thought about how he was going to propose the visit. This went on for some time.
“If there’s no chance of getting you to bugger off,” said Harry, half-kidding.
On the other side of the room, Harry practically glowed, and Draco gave him a secret smile, conveying that he’d meant every word.
When Jake finally released him, Draco managed to turn and retreat gracefully back to his spot in the circle, but his face was burning. Naturally, this fact was noticed and he was passed one of several bottles of whiskey and a shot glass. “Two shots!” they crowed gleefully.
"Well, keep on like that, and I'll have no trouble doing it again," Draco said scathingly, getting his bearings back.
Instead of cursing, Potter clapped enthusiastically. “Nice job!” he crowed, giving Draco a smug look. Only that morning, he’d been bragging about how he charmed Danny into giving them only the best softball players. Draco had scoffed at the time and it was still much too early to tell anyhow. With his luck, naturally Potter would be right about the whole thing. Except Draco couldn’t actually be too upset about that – after all, it would be nice to be on the winning team for once.
Though the sunlight was still brightly shining through the window, Draco closed his eyes and, for once, fell asleep without hesitation. His face was peaceful of he dreamed of a better tomorrow, one where he would not be known as Malfoy the former Death Eater.
“—If you powder the mothwings—"
Eric starts laughing again, and Harry smiles with relief. “Oh man, I totally feel you. That's only the story of my life. But no, I was not trying to awkwardly seduce you with my polka puns, endearing as they may be.”
“Why?” asked Draco suspiciously. “I don’t suppose you want to go out for ice cream?”
“If I might ask,” he ventures, “What happened to bring about such inclusive behavior? You were never quite so…accepting.”
Harry crosses over to him and sits between Draco’s legs, leaning back against his chest and letting his head rest against Draco’s shoulder. “Are you sure you want this?” Draco breathes, nuzzling Harry’s head with his nose.
The owl chattered excitedly, and Harry knew he’d gotten it right. “Draco,” he breathed.
“Would you happen to have some pumpkin juice to go along with those biscuits?” asked Potter.
He received a grumpy response for his efforts, but he knew Draco was only teasing. Curling up in his favorite sofa crease, Harry closed his eyes as Draco began reading.
“Mr. Malfoy and Ms. Granger!” crowed Slughorn, “What a marvelous effort!”
Potter was staring right at Draco’s face, and Draco was temporarily lost, but he recovered himself enough to squeak, “Potter, what the
Hermione nodded, biting her lip. She knocked on the door once, and then twice. They could hear footsteps inside coming closer and closer, until finally the door swung open.

“Really Mother, now even you’re insulting my worth?” asked Draco exasperatedly.
now, but that’s only because they can talk nerd to each other.”
“I’ll get her some food and water,” Hermione said, bustling off to the kitchen.
“You always do, Draco,” Harry chuckled lightly. “Now carry me to bed.”
“You could also cook for me sometimes, if you want,” says Harry with a snicker. “But really, yeah. That’s it. You lot knowing actually helps a great deal.”
“Alright, Harry,” Draco said when they’d finally broken apart again. “You’ve successfully wooed me. Now can I get some bloody
It wasn’t natural and it wasn’t right, but there was nothing left for him here. A man would never desire him in the way he longed to be wanted. An establishment would never look past the Mark on his arm and value him for his mind. And the curse of family loyalty would micromanage his life to the nth degree, never escaping him.
A second later, the retainer was in. Relieved, Draco sat up and turned to look in the mirror. For a minute, he almost didn’t recognize himself, and then he experienced a brief moment of disappointment because it didn’t look nearly as good as he thought it would. Breathing deeply, Draco reminded himself that it takes time to get used to changing things about one’s appearance, and also that this was a retainer, not the most aesthetically beautiful piece of jewelry. He told himself again that he’d get used to it after a few days. At least it didn’t hurt.
“You’re a bigger idiot than I thought if you actually believed for one second that Voldemort had a legitimate business.” Harry said.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
“Of course you do,” Hermione murmured. There was a slight dip to the bed as she climbed in, demolishing the outer wall of his casing as she snuggled up behind him.
“Like you asked me, Potter, how could you not have an opinion on this topic?”
“I’m just going to be really upfront about this,” sighs Ron. “Before she left, Hermione made me swear that I would try to get a straight answer out of you.”
Draco sat beside her. “Have hope,” he said, placing a hand gently on her back. “Unless you change your specialization, there’s not much else you can do. You already have a full plate, and we have to concentrate on getting through exams next week.”
There were bigger concerns, of course. Draco was very close to cracking the reason why Hermione couldn’t reverse the memory charm she’d placed on her parents in order to protect them from the Death Eaters. It wasn’t a regular Memory Charm, where she took memories away. Rather, she’d simply
the interview,” Luna had specified, leading them through the twisty halls of the
“Exactly,” said Nate. “He figured that he might as well help the kids in his community, and SDYBSA has been going strong for the past 3 or so years. But now they’re expanding, and Danny needs more coaches and more fundraising.”
“Harry,” says Draco softly, pulling away from Potter’s lips, “What is this?”
He needn’t have worried. Draco is a natural, somehow putting his students at ease even with his flawlessly cool demeanor and brisk perfectionism. Switching between group breakout sessions, demonstrations, and choosing brave soul volunteers, Draco leads the class through a set of wand techniques Harry’s quite sure he hasn’t seen before. One aficionado sees fit to question Draco’s knowledge, and Harry expects a Snape-esque display of power. Instead, Draco gives him leave to do whatever he wants, but then asks him to duel for the class. Harry thinks for a moment Draco will take on the man himself, but instead he selects a female hobbyist who’s a much weaker dueler than the man, in Harry’s opinion. The class knows it too, and they start tittering amongst themselves until Draco silences them with a sharp look. Harry wishes he could demand respect so immediately – Snape always inspired a healthy fear in students – and from the expression on Ron’s face Harry can tell he’s thinking the same thing.
It didn’t get better from there. He had time to finish the verse before they reached the range, and so Draco had to sing – and do motions for – the rest of the verse, which went included “kachang kachang kachang,” “ a wibbly wobbly wibbly woo,” and yet another round of “a hula hula hu.”
“Draco, do I have to remind you that I vanquished the darkest wizard in our history? And besides, I’m sure we’ll find something to do. Together.”
Draco nodded tersely and then stepped into the fireplace. “Home,” he said quietly, ignoring the nagging feeling in his gut that indicated his unfinished business and the decision that still remained.
“Longbottom,” Draco said, meeting his eyes. “Thank you.” Longbottom nodded once, and Draco fought the urge to break into a run. Instead, he strode away with purpose, parting the silenced crowd who only seconds before had been in all their glory at the sight of him humiliated. The last thing he saw, out of the corner of his eye, was Longbottom rounding on the four that had initiated the encounter against him.
“I took a little trip out East, and while I was touring New York, this absolute nutter saw me playing catch with my mate and tried to recruit me to play baseball,” Cale said mischievously.
“You’re on,” said Draco. “You have nothing to worry about, love,” he reassured Harry, kissing his cheek.
By mutual silent agreement, they went back to studying the journal issues.
"10 Reasons Their Love Was Foretold;" "Keys to Successful Interhouse Relationships;" "Gryffindors Reveal All;" and, last but not least, "'Better Together'--Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy."
“If we can get this article published, we can get into any school we want,” said Hermione eagerly. “What’s Harry planning to do, then?”
He was stopped again, this time by Slughorn, who wanted to essentially give Harry and Draco his blessing, all the while reaping praise on Draco’s Potions ability. Harry
have that all taken care of.”
could always be the one to remarry. Unfortunately, that suggestion never went over very well. He always felt mildly guilty for saying it, especially if Mother was in the room, but it wasn’t enough to a deterrent to curb his sass.
“How come?” Malfoy asks, following his gaze to the cement pathway.
His first week went really well: Draco had a knack for doing the research required to find different Foundations and funders that offered grants, and was even brave enough to start learning the processes to apply for government grants (they required the most paperwork). In his second week, Draco made it his mission to learn everything possible about his employer by attending programs, discovering the role of each staff member, and meeting the clients served by the organization. The following weeks led Draco to start writing the individual parts of the grant, compiling all of the necessary information, and submitting the proposals for review. Soon, it all began to blend together, and Draco had the rhythm down. He could no longer do his homework three weeks in advance, but maintained perfect grades anyway.
“We’re coming through!”
They were just wrapping up their final hours cramming for the boards, the pressure so tangible that Harry had talked Ron out of drinking that night, and were in the process of saying demure goodnight’s in an attempt to get some rest.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
Abby chirruped, and Draco smiled. If there was something unsavory in the package, she’d have acted differently; Draco explicitly told her to watch Harry like a hawk.
“They seem like quite a close-knit bunch,” noted Draco.
“Do you want the short version or the long version?”
Steve, who had remained relatively calm throughout Draco’s tirade, looked calmly back at him to respond, “Yeah, I bet you’d like it if I sucked cocks. You’d be first in line, faggot.”
“That’s partially why I’m here,” Harry answers. It’s different to think of him as Harry, but since I’ve asked him to call me Draco, it’s only fair I stop thinking of him as Potter.
“Hello, Draco,” she said, still a little cautious around her nephew. “Don’t tell me you’ve grown tired of the showering at the Manor?”
“Enjoy it while you can,” said Kingsley ominously. “A case has come up – quite urgent, this one is – but it’s nothing that can’t wait until tomorrow. We’ve got the night Aurors doing some research, but naturally I’d feel better if it was in the hands of our best team in the department!”
"Potter," he rasped. "What are you doing here?"
“Wait, where? Shefftucket?” asked Draco, face wrinkled with confusion.
Then, before he could properly see exactly what happened, the person standing on top of a large dirt mound raised his leg and pulled back his arm to hurl the small white ball what looked like directly at the man with the bat. Draco sprang out his chair, sure that the man would end up in a shit ton of pain and attack the thrower with the bat. Were these muggles mad?
Ginny narrowed her eyes briefly, but then she nodded. "Welcome to the Burrow," she said with a smile. “I’ll always be sorry we didn’t work out, Harry, but all I want is for you to be happy.”
“You still haven’t forgiven him, have you?” Harry asked.
“Malfoy, mate, you know I didn’t mean you,” the Weasel said, a nervous lilt to his voice. His body language suggested that their relationship had gotten past old animosities, but they were still careful around each other.
Draco wanted to tell Macmillan
“Hey, y’all!” shouted Becky Lou from third base, one of the two women on the team. “I don’t mind me a dirty bird if he’s got an ass like that!” She turned to Harry. “I suppose you’re coming home with me tonight, then aren’t you sweetheart?”
“But I didn’t help her either!”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “Um, yeah? Like, everybody shops, you know?” he said with a hint of sarcasm.
the one the Ministry is more likely to keep tabs on.”
“It’s winter, you’re not going to smell them,” Draco said, and Harry could hear a tinge of regret in his voice.
Draco completely understood as Jake hid his face and started to climb off of Draco. Their pants were both soaked through with come, brushing up stickily against one another. Though it was awkward as hell, Draco had no intention of losing Jake as a friend.
After, as their breathing returned to normal, Draco was overwhelmed with sleepiness and the desire to cuddle. He fought the lethargy overwhelming his body, rotating around and climbing back up to Harry.
“Okay, then, tell me about your week.” Harry sat down, crossing his legs to settle in. With a smile on his face, Draco started talking about how the semester had ended, about his one seminar paper on how one overlooked aspect of Memory Potionry might be revised and further explored with the possibility of restoring long-term memory damage. Not only had he gotten top marks on it with the suggestion to publish, the professor went out of her way to tell Draco that he should base his culminating Mastery project around experimenting with the theories and techniques he outlined in the paper with the goal of actually forming a potion that could restore memory damage. It was a lofty goal, but Draco was emboldened by the challenge, eyes shining as he detailed the several different ways it might be possible to come up with such a solution. If anyone could do it, Harry though, it would definitely be Draco.
“Take short,” said Mike without preamble. “I’m better at second anyway.”
He felt Harry laugh and kiss his neck again before finally there was increased pressure and wideness pushing slowly into him. Finally, Harry was fully inside, inside him in a painful-yet-brilliant way. He pressed into Draco, hitting a pleasure point that he didn't know existed, rocking gently in-and-out in a way that made Draco's eyes roll back in his head.
Still unconvinced, Draco pressed harder. “So you think Potter’s feelings for me are genuine, then?”
Draco said softly, “You haven’t changed a bit, have you?”
After he finished pointing out Sirius, Potter pulled him on his side and kissed him deeply, softly caressing Draco’s face. Draco let himself kiss back, because as unsure as he was about Potter’s motivations, he was convinced that they were heartfelt.
“Pass those over here,” orders Potter, sticking his hand out.
Harry let out a whoop, followed up by Cale. Everyone else had their game face on.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“Oh, I’m definitely telling Harry.”
A window rolled down. “Hey you. Yeah, you!” the driver, a man not that much younger than Draco, frantically gesticulated. “Have you seen a little boy, about 4 years old? Old Edna up on Irving Park went and lost him again.”
“And you’ll run it in
“No, Merlin no, not the Dark Lord,” Malfoy says, looking revolted. “Some of the other Death Eaters, though it could have been a lot worse –”
Malfoy agreeably leaned forward, interlacing his fingers and initiating direct eye contact with Harry. “Siberia might be an enjoyable destination, though a little cold during the winter months when we have our break at Hogwarts.”
“Agreed,” said Chris, “But let’s all clear it with our jobs –”
He visibly relaxes, and Harry wants nothing more than to throw his arms around the man and snog him senseless.
“You’re weird as shit, you know that right?” asked the guy, leaning over to push open the front passenger door. “Get in, I’ll take you to where you need to go.”
“Mm,” Harry agreed. “Maybe they have some pastries in there as well.” He reached into Ron’s bag and pulled out their set of lock picks. “Think we’ll need just the usual, or should I bring the whole set?”
“Sorry, Professor,” Harry said grimly.
As promised, practice was brutal. Draco was terribly sore from throwing and running by the time it was all over, though they had a few days’ break before having to do it all over again. Nate’s end-of-practice motivational speech seemed a little canned, but he wrapped it up early and released them with a plea for them to get excited for the kids tomorrow. Draco didn’t even want to think about coaching after all the drama that morning.
“We really can’t. I know you don’t like Draco, but I want him in my life. You’ll have to decide if you can live with that.” Harry sank down into the warm sand, twenty feet from the water’s edge, and Ron joined him.
“You know, I actually don’t think so,” Harry said, flexing his fingers in an attempt to work out some of the ache. He was much happier fighting with his guns; it hurt his extremities less in the long run.
Potter snorted. “That’s such bullshit.”
“Draco!” Harry’s voice echoed from the other room. “Merlin, what kept you so long? Was there a line at the store?”
With any luck, he’d at least be living with a fellow Slytherin: Theodore and Greg weren’t returning, but Blaise and Pansy were. But more often than not, Draco wasn’t so fortunate. He tried to calm the growing swell of fear in his stomach by turning to Harry, but Draco only saw the same concern reflected back at him from the green depths. Unable to quell his anxiety, Draco reached out for Harry’s hand and was pleased Harry was already grappling around for his. They stood there with neutral expressions, worry about the following term only noticeable by the tight grip each exerted on the other’s hand.
“Nor am I, Potter.”
“Potter,” a soft male voice says.
"You can't see that he's always trying to be there for you in every way he can?"
was always studying when Draco came into her room), so maybe he had been acting a little more obsessively than normal. Draco decided to take the suggestion into consideration and continued reading.
“Yes?”
“Inside me,” Harry breathed back, flushing enough to assure Draco he wasn’t comfortable asking for this. Most likely, Draco usually bottomed in their relationship. He didn’t mind the change of pace, delighted that Harry trusted him enough to allow him access to the deepest part of himself.
Harry slammed his fist down on the desk. “That’s not good enough!” he shouted. “We’ve been in California for nearly three years, now, and the blasted Inter-Office Communications have seen more action than we have!”
“Took you long enough,” groused Cale as Harry opened the door for Malfoy and all but shoved him inside the backseat next to Chris.
“Yes,” said Harry, relieved. He wasn’t about to miss his chance to speak honestly.
“Someplace with food, Potter, obviously.”
“Yes, especially since you’re so tight-lipped about who she is.”
“Cale has a thing for Nate.”
“Wasn’t there another section that needed to be repaired up on the seventh floor?” Draco inquired, neatly gathering his things in a pile on the table before him.
“I hope you choke on your cannoli, Harry,” Ron said savagely, still working on the tart.
“I hate both of you,” Ron wheezed, trying to catch his breath. “What did I do to deserve being the butt of all these dick jokes?”
“I’ll drink to that,” Hermione laughed, pouring three glasses of orange juice. “Just as long as you’re healthy, Harry, that’s all that matters,” she added.
Draco had no hesitation. He snatched up some powder and tossed it to his feet, determined to follow Potter to the ends of the Earth if that was what it took. Not too long ago, he would have definitely categorized anywhere with a Weasley firmly into that category.
“Now you catch.” Potter threw the ball directly at his chest, and Draco almost had a heart attack trying to get it to land in the glove. Fortunately, it bounced off of the leather contraption and left his body unharmed.
Harry’s spring was also going really well, particularly because he felt more relaxed and happy since he’d been after the war ended. Purpose had been restored to his life. His baseball team “Joe Buck Yourself” took home the New York CFBA first place trophy, with no small thanks to Nate’s commitment, diligence, and willingness to make the team practice on off days. To Harry, it was even better than winning the House Cup at Hogwarts. He’d been close to his fellow Gryffindors, but spent a great deal of his free time with teammates. Cale was probably his best mate in America, though Harry still hadn’t managed to convince him to make a real move on Nate, and they still went drinking with Chris every Friday night while making a real effort not to walk into Saturday morning practice wasted.
“Then we’ll just have to change their minds,” said Harry. “Even if it’s one person at a time.”
There is no
“Don’t mind him,” Hermione says lightly, indicating Ron with her hand as she pulls out her own chair. “He took me out for Date Night yesterday and spent a little bit more than he meant to.”
“I accept your apology, Malfoy,” Ron said. Hermione kicked him. He sighed again. “I’m also sorry for how I acted at Hogwarts and for insulting your mother.”
There was a tentative knock on the door. After exchanging a look with Harry, Neville rose and opened it, wand at the ready. To their surprise, Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were standing at the threshold.
“Why were you pretending to be asleep?” Draco demanded, having recovered from his shock, though he was still holding a hand over his heart for good measure.
There wasn’t much need to consult the textbook. If a mistake was in the process of being made, the other caught it before it actually happened. They both seemed to have photographic memories of what each step called for and knew how to achieve better results than the actual author. Draco found himself in the middle of a potion-making experience far beyond anything he’d ever achieved by himself. He and Granger moved as one entity, stirring, adding, and tweaking as if they’d been partners for years instead of mere minutes.
After a few more minutes of making Draco sob and beg for more, Potter pulled away, grinning. “
Pulling no punches, Father asked, “Will you marry this one?”
“I know that!” thunders Harry. “But nothing’s wrong!” He throws down the dishtowel and runs up the stairs to the guest room, debating whether or not he should leave. Apparating to his own flat would be to deny Malfoy, who’d worked so hard to make sure he stayed at Ron and Hermione’s tonight. Harry stands, pacing back and forth around the room. In the end, he collapses back on the bed, because he can’t bring himself to disobey Malfoy’s advice after the latter went through such pains to help him.
“That’s because you’re doing it wrong, Potter,” Malfoy said. Harry could practically hear him rolling his eyes on the other end of the phone. “People in San Diego don’t usually put up ‘For Rent’ signs because they don’t want the homeless population squatting on their property.”
“Just like this, Harry,” Draco breathes, ethereal in the soft bedroom light. He straddles Harry’s hips and then sinks down on his cock, quivering as his pucker struggles to take it all in. Harry feels Draco’s muscles contract as he envelops Harry’s cock and can’t help but shiver with the immense amount of pleasure the blonde is giving him.
“Draco? Is that you, young man?” Harry watched, grinning, as an elderly lady with a cane tottered up and smartly rapped Malfoy on the shoulder. She was wearing an eclectic sweater crocheted from different colored squares; one Harry privately thought Luna might have coveted. Maybe he should see if there were any others in the store to give her as a birthday present. Before he could follow up on the idea, Malfoy’s reaction immediately drew him out of his thoughts.
She took pity on him then and got up from the rocking chair to sit next to him on the couch. “He got his act together,” she said, resting her chin on her hand. “We started simple, just out to dinner and the like. But our times together were amazing. And he made it clear to me that his heart was in this, that he wanted to be with me. One thing just led to another.”
Draco walked with Potter around the winding path, taking in the roses, lilies, and tulips as well as the more dramatic sunflowers and draping wisterias. They sat in the shade of the lone willow tree, watching the wind softly blow the tall grass from side to side. Draco could not remember feeling so at ease in years; possibly since before he started at Hogwarts. Theirs was a relaxed companionship, but still Draco could feel the chemistry between them. He longed to reach out and take Potter’s hand, but the time still didn’t feel right yet.
Nonverbally, Harry cast an Aguamenti at the flame, but instead of simply extinguishing the flame, he created a wave of water that crashed down upon the offending Ravenclaw. She stood there, soaking wet, and gazed dumbfounded back at Harry. Malfoy had continued walking towards Harry, unaware of the exchange happening behind him, so Harry simply made eye contact with the Ravenclaw and rather pointedly reached out to shake Malfoy’s hand. Confused, Malfoy went with it.
Ron unconsciously gripped the bandages still covering the bullet wound on his left bicep. “Blimey, that’s not happening again! I told that bastard Dolohov what would happen the next time I saw him! Didn’t I, Harry?”
Whoever invented sleeping bags should be mercilessly tortured, Draco thinks, tossing and turning in his sleeping bag. The night is crisp and cool; having caused him to instantly freeze the moment he tried to shed the bloody bag fifteen minutes earlier. Only fools camp outside in the wilderness during the chilly spring months and Draco’s one of them. But not by his own merit. Having fulfilled the base requirements of his reparations to society, he was offered the choice of either spending a year on probation or volunteering at a resident camp for troubled youths. Had he known camp began in mid-May, not mid-June, Draco might have considered the year of probation.
“Why did I do it?” he asked finally, voice husky.
It only took another well-placed breathy moan before Draco whirled around and clutched Harry tightly in his arms. “I need you,” he whispered.
José coughed behind him. “Angle yourself,” he mumbled, drawing a second rubber in the dirt with his cleat. He put his left foot slightly behind, on the side of the rubber, and slightly angled the right in front of it.
“So afterward, Draco comes onstage and practically every guy’s mouth is on the floor because he’s so fantastic at what he does. The dance reminded me so much of
Wisely, Ron and Hermione refrain from asking about how or why Draco was raped. Harry assumes they understand it’s not his story to tell. Everyone stays quiet for a moment, thinking.
Her head wasn’t spinning. That was a trick of Hermione’s imagination, one caused by too little sleep and too much time spent inhaling Lysol. Groaning, she wrenched herself off of the couch and went to make a ham sandwich. But just as she went to take a bite, the doorbell rang, causing her hand to spasm open, sandwich hitting the floor with a soft
“I’ll send Potter a note tomorrow,” Malfoy reassures her. “It might seem strange, but we’re on decent terms now. I’ve been through a similar situation, and Potter might be able to relate to me better.”
vacation, one where I can let my hair down.”
“Er, no,” says Ron guiltily, looking around the room for help that’s unable to come.
“Well, if you’re so bound and determined to keep us out, why don’t you come and take care of Harry then?” Hermione demands.
They throw us a party at our sister camp in the middle of summer. We’ve just come off of a ten day session – of course, I had the youngest, whiniest campers – and I want nothing more than to sleep and scrub the sweat of exhaustion from my body. Instead, we’re required to attend the gathering at Camp Buckeye, and scarpering would definitely leave me with a mark on my record.
“First off,” Draco interrupted. “You can’t possibly rebuild Hogwarts alone, so stop flattering yourself. And I never thought you were one to really care about what people thought.”
“Harry?” a soft voice queries from the hallway.
“I’m ready for you now,” Draco said, seductively swaying his way back up Harry’s body. Harry inhaled at the sight of his beauty; blonde hair mussed from Harry’s own hands, lips red and puffy from Harry’s cock, and his own cock so, so hard from being turned on by Harry…
Draco landed in the scrubby desert area behind the baseball fields, grimacing as he nearly stepped on one of the very prevalent San Diego sun lizards. He found a little pathway out of the wilderness and made a beeline for the field that had a ginormous bus parked next to it. Their coach must have hauled them off the bus and right on the baseball field as soon as they got into town. Draco almost thought it was cruel, and then reflected on the fact that their team was number one in the league. Clearly they worked to maintain their standing, but Draco had serious reservations about their team name “Joe Buck Yourself.” He supposed people from New York had inside jokes that people in San Diego would not be privy to.
Potter made a derisive noise, and Draco figured that he’d accidentally insulted him. “Don’t get offended...I never meant to imply that you weren’t intelligent, just that you do better when you have a project to put back together.” He shoved Potter towards the base of the bricked wall that they’d constructed the day before. “Besides, Granger and I were at the top of our class…”
“Well maybe I could help you figure it out,” she said, continuing to be positive. It used to be one of the things Harry liked best about Ginny, how optimistic she could be. Not so much anymore.
“Honestly, Harry, I think you should give me the story in a nutshell then go find him."
, they’d try to force him to go even harder the following Friday night. He barely made it through practice–Nate had put them through a particularly grueling set of drills, and then made them stay an extra hour to run every situation he could think of involving runners on base–and was quite eager to go home and get back to sleep.
“It is not.” Draco opted for cool detachment as he stared straight ahead, because even with his feelings as they were, he and Potter were not friends.
“Sure is,” said Cale, a nostalgic look on his face. “That was the first place I came to in America, and I never wanted to leave.”
They dug in, much to the distast of the barista behind the counter. She called out to them with a loud “Excuse me!”, which they both pretended to not hear. They were only saved by a customer coming up to the counter and expecting to be served.
“I simply cannot tell you,” said Father coldly, “How disappointed I am to have you for a son. What I wouldn’t have given for a task as mindless as marriage when I was young!”
“Malfoy,” said Granger suddenly, as their frantic pace finally slowed, “While this brews, we should make a comprehensive list of all the ways in which we altered the recipe.”
“Georgie,” said a dark haired girl with bangs. She was lithe and looked fast; perfect as the other middle infielder.
Trying to refrain from grinning, he turns around and quips, “Oh, did you not want me to leave without a goodbye hug?”
Draco lobbed one of the balls at Potter’s head. “Maybe, but the result is definitely worth the effort.”
“Er—” said Ron. Unwilling to give him enough time to think up a toast, Harry picked up his glass and clinked it against Ron’s.
, Ron. Have you seen the bodice on this dress? I can hardly move, let alone shoot.”
Laughing softly, Harry returned the throw. “No doubt about that.”
“Seamus danced with me at the first place we went to,” he says, closing his eyes. It’s possible to imagine the polka dancer instead if he just tries hard enough. “He used my arse to grind until he came.”
He meant to say thank you for the cake, but “This looks delicious” came out instead.
It was Harry’s turn to let Hermione talk. She took another minute before finishing her thought, grasping around in her pocket for a tissue to wipe her eyes. He put his hand on her back.
“So what are you going to do for this year, then? How are you going to prepare for a career?”
On that happy note, Harry switched off the light and snuggled into bed, pulling Draco close as he carefully kept his tickling fingers to himself.
Draco nodded, pressing his bare foot on first base experimentally. “And why did you run past the base like that? It’s not just because we’re racing, because I saw you do it earlier.”
“Of course not,” Harry replied, eyes traveling across the page so fast he vaguely resembled Granger during finals week. “It’s all a deterrent, putting the list the bloody hell up here, writing in minuscule handwriting—for some reason, McGonagall doesn’t want anyone studying this list extensively.”
Harry’s heart hurt from that. In an attempt to distract Malfoy, he asked, “Maybe tomorrow you’d like to help me rebuild the dungeons?” He tried to sound like he wanted Malfoy’s company and surprised himself when the question was genuine.
“My mother and, erm,
“Not at all,” Draco managed, afraid to look back at Potter. “But I’m afraid that I still don’t know any of the rules.”
is the matter with you?!” But Potter being Potter, he barreled on anyways.
“Can I borrow your owl, you bloody wanker?”
They got home late that night. It had been so peaceful out under the stars that no one had wanted to leave and end the moment. So Harry, Draco, and the rest of the Weasleys ended up taking dinner out into the back yard—which was honestly the best meal Harry’d ever had—and continuing to watch the night sky. Draco’d even seen a shooting star that the rest of them had somehow missed.
“How do you know I said yes?”
“What would the neighbors say if my parents suddenly couldn’t recognize them?” Hermione demanded. She snatched his hand again and started running through the streets, and it was all Draco could do to keep up with her. He narrowly dodged an unknown animal and quickly prayed that his potion worked so that they would never have to come back to Australia again.
Closing his eyes, Draco concentrated on a stereotypical image of the Statue of Liberty.
Potter stared at him, expression inscrutable. “Sure thing, Malfoy,” he eventually said.
She leaned in and kissed him before rotating to settle as his little spoon. He wrapped his arm around her stomach, glad that she wasn’t looking at him anymore. Otherwise, she’d have been able to see his eyes tearing up before the wetness silently spilled down his cheek closest to the pillow.
“You mean it?”
was essential if one wanted to actually see their readings, assignments, and grades. The experience of actually buying the laptop had scarred him for life, though. Draco had just walked into the first store he saw, found an employee, and said, “I need to purchase a laptop” and the guy had talked his ear off for at least a half an hour, comparing this brand and that. He vowed to use the damn thing to partake in what they called “online shopping” from now on so he’d never have to again step foot next to an overly-friendly muggle in customer service.
“Let’s lay off, we’ve got him all hot and bothered now.”
“You should shower,” Hermione said wearily. Pent up anxiety would prevent her from napping before Harry and Ron arrived, but there would definitely be time for a soothing cup of tea and some rest—the tried and true practices of professional housewives and househusbands had nothing on Draco’s cleaning routine.
“Are you blind, Nate?” hollered the man with the bat. He stepped out of the white rectangle, stepped over the rectangle-triangle, and waved the bat threateningly. “Sure, it bloody well hit the outside of the corner, but I’d have needed a club to hit it, it was so high!”
The man’s face turned redder and redder and he stomped towards Draco, belly protruding, to jab his finger into Draco’s chest. “I don’t know what kind of junkie addict you are to not even know where the
Again, Draco didn’t respond. He very carefully stabbed a bite of cantaloupe and chewed it methodically, tasting nothing.
“Thanks, Weasley,” Draco said, sincere. “But there’s still the, well,
Ginny did not waver under his glare. “What do you mean, “What do I mean?” You’ve been cold and distant for months. I knew you were studying hard, but it never stopped you from being affectionate before at Hogwarts. And then when you started working full-time I thought things would get back to normal.”

“Dear Mr. Malfoy,
They were singing Rihanna. Malfoy’s sweet, high voice seemed entirely wrong for her style of music but somehow seemed to repurpose the music into something that suited him and Harry. The crowd raged beneath them, but he only had eyes for Malfoy. As they moved with the music, catching each other’s eye after nailing a particularly powerful part of the song, Harry understood that he was falling in love with the blonde pointy git.
“Become a better man, Draco,” whispered Narcissa. “I never wanted you to be so hateful and violent. Learn how to care for others, and how to love. Not everyone will betray you.”
Mind made up, Draco saw some bushes behind the smallest library he’d ever seen in his entire life and made a beeline for them. Taking care to make sure he wasn’t spotted, Draco again focused on New York, turning on his heel and giving himself over to his magic.
Potter smiles deviously and kneels down before teasingly drawing out Draco’s cock and licking a firm stripe up the shaft. He laps at the frenulum, stroking Draco’s balls in time with his tongue’s movements. Trying not to cry out has become the focus of Draco’s experience. He whimpers, but Potter just gently laughs before swallowing him down whole. The wind wafts over Draco’s exposed cock, but every time the cold air hits, Potter’s hot tongue swirls and flicks over spots that make hot tears come to Draco’s eyes. As Potter combines sucking with a head twist that exerts pressure on Draco’s frenulum, he cries out, “No, Potter, stop – stop.” Potter looks up questioningly, and Draco blurts “I’m close.”
“Yeah, thanks mate,” Harry echoed. “Like I said before, it means the world.”
“I like to look at them.”
to the Death Eaters. It’s far from reputable, but the ends justify the means. But that does
of the team,” Nate corrected himself, “But after it was brought up, my hands were instantly tied. He threatened to report us to the League, Draco. We’d be disqualified.”
“There’s a reason he’s now kicked out of our bar gatherings,” Harry says darkly. “So afterward, we go to this other place where, erm, men dance. On stage. And it’s really secretive; we were blindfolded and led to our seats by some blokes in masks.”
Harry took another swig of coffee before responding, somehow feeling more tired than he had before. “Hey, Luna. Not to be rude, but I’m going to be late meeting Draco-–”
“Definitely. It’s so rewarding, to see the looks on their faces when they finally get the spells down,” he says enthusiastically, poking at the salad. “You’d actually be a pretty good instructor too, Malfoy, if you’re ever up for it. Can you pass the dressing?”
“Or toasters?” sniped Steve. “I’m telling you, it feels like you’ve come down from outer space. You don’t have to be an American to know what a

“Traitor.”
“Speaking of Malfoy,” Hermione said thoughtfully, “Isn’t that him standing down by the pumpkin patch?”
“If you wake up really early tomorrow,” Harry whispered, “You can come shower with me and make sure I get clean.”
“Cool your jets, Malfoy. I’ll have you begging to come home within an hour, anyway,” Harry snorted.
“Yes, exactly. Sexual assault can take a lot of different forms, and I think it’s important to recognize them all as valid.”
Potter continued to stump around the ground floor until he finally threw open the back door and shouted, “Draco, are you out here? It’s bloody freezing, it is.”
“But—but—but,” the Weasel sputtered.
Without a word, Draco brandished his wand with a quick jab and put Harry’s cigarette out, still smoking.
Of course Potter was first into the stall where the rakes/scoops were kept. Draco watched as he grabbed one of each before parading himself down the center aisle and gallantly entering the stall furthest from the group. Naturally the Saviour had to show off his heroism at every possible opportunity. It made Draco sick how Potter felt the need to attract attention with every single move he made. Though he was strutting with every scoop of horse shit, Draco wouldn’t deny that Potter was quite attractive. His broad shoulders rippled as he heaved the shovel, and Draco was entranced by the curve of his arse as he bent over.
“Of course. I meant that you’ll be moving your body. When’s the last time you did some running, Malfoy? Maybe that time when you saw Professor Moody coming at you from around the corner?”
Again, Draco took deep breaths, fighting the discomfort of Harry’s lubed finger pushing into him. It stopped feeling weird after a while, once he'd had time to adjust. One turned into two, with Draco's desire again rising.
are you ready?” he asked mischievously.
“Don’t worry, Potter,” smirked Draco. “There are so many other places where you can learn to leave behind your hopeless plebian status…”
Instead, all that happened was Potter laughing and calling out, “I know you’re pissed that I hit off of you, but Malfoy, for fuck’s sakes, aim for the bloody corners!”
Fortunately, the name was quite misleading: taking part only involved sitting in a circle and “sucking” a playing card against one’s lips to pass to another person by “blowing” the card off to their mouth. Draco had been reluctant enough to participate, but the general ribbing of the group soon incited him to participate – they were fellow members of the
“So are you,” says Draco, bending his legs to contour them to Harry’s before leaning down to kiss his lover. He starts gently moving up a moment later, breathing rapidly outward from the tingling, allowing Harry to squeeze the globes of his arse. “I love you like this, Harry.”
“What are you doing?” Ron demanded.
“Just give it a go, Draco, what’s the worst thing that can happen? They say no? Then you’re just right back where you started. There’s nothing to lose.”
“Shit,” Harry said, “I really wanted to spend the day with you, too. Reckon I did it to myself though.”
day, without question) but he desperately wanted to get Potter alone again. They were too tired to even grab dinner after Potter finally let them call it quits, so Draco would always return back to the Manor alone.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes and loudly snorted, before concluding, “Like I said, you know nothing, Potter.”
“Shit,” Draco muttered under his breath. This is exactly what he feared would happened. Any second now, Potter would accuse Draco of trying to intentionally hit him and then walk off the field.
“Harry, mate,” Ron said, interrupting his thoughts and his rhythm of aimless laps around the Pitch. “Want to grab a bite? The guys are heading to O'Kinney's for the game, but I figure you’d want to bugger off, after how boring it was last time…”
It was good to have Ron back in his life, no doubt about it. Why did having one of his friends back have to come at the cost of the rest? He missed Draco and Hermione terribly, even though some days he hated them both, and had the sneaking suspicion that Ron missed Hermione too. They hadn’t talked much about Harry’s relationship with Draco. With Ron, it had always been best to let sleeping dogs lie, and this was no exception.
“Mine too,” said Harry, “But, you know, we look really fucking
“Ready for NEWTs?” Ginny asked suddenly. They’d been eating in near silence, and Harry’d appreciated the chance to think.
“You’re family,” said Mr. Weasley simply. He held his arms open for Harry, who rushed into them without another word. As Harry hugged Arthur, he couldn't stop himself from tearing up, comforted immensely from the love he’d been shown by the individuals surrounding him. Draco was still uneasy by the demonstrations of care and support, but he appreciated them all the same.
“Potter, you don’t go around asking your employees how much you should pay them!” Draco snorts.
“Where did you learn those techniques?” queries Ron, staring intently at Draco.
He didn’t expect to feel a hand clamp down on his shoulder or for Potter to bend down and whisper in his ear, “Draco, things are going to get better for you here on, I promise,” before giving him one last squeeze and departing purposefully for the Lodge.
They worked together to scrub the floor again—Hermione made sure to monitor the amount of Lysol that went into the bucket; she had no interest in drying out her hands with chemical cleaning supplies—and Draco consented to leaving the walls and the cabinets alone so long as they scoured the countertops. After another grueling hour of labor, the house was sparkling; the cleaning supplies neatly returned to their homes under the kitchen sink. To Hermione, the house had been sparkling yesterday, but in this situation, it was Draco’s opinion that carried the most weight. After all, he’d be the one to pitch a Mr. Clean sponge at the wall and loudly declare everything needed done over again. And, finally, he seemed to be content. Not enthusiastic, per se, but content.
He cut through a more wooded path after reaching the camp’s helipad, indulging in a brief fantasy that involved him standing on that platform and Apparating back to the Wizarding World. Draco didn’t miss the Manor, but being without his wand was the equivalent of losing a limb. Finally, after climbing up a tiny hill and stopping to remove the offending woodchips from his shoes, Draco noticed the unwelcome pile of refuse scattered along the entire width of the trail.
“I don’t see a way forward,” Draco admitted. “And I don’t know how much more pain I can take.”
“How are we going to do this?” Potter asked, looking uncertainly at Draco.
The only way he was going to get through this was with a clear head and an open mind.
“Yes,” Harry said through gritted teeth, making eye contact with the painting across the room.
Before McGonagall finished speaking, several younger students saw fit to start speculating about professors and classes, their giggles echoing across the lake. Draco was never a fan of the Gryffindor Head of House, but he deeply (albeit grudgingly) respected her. He knew exactly what that lot would be in for come the start of term.

“Alright, Potter, alright! If you make it through the interview and the photoshoot tomorrow, with your clothes on and without murdering someone, then yes, I’ll make the stew again.”
“I’m all ears, Malfoy,” he relented wearily.
She just wasn’t getting it. “Gin. I don’t desire you anymore. I can’t give you what you want, or need.” He removed his hands from her shoulders and detached her grasp.
trouble from that buggering maniac. I would have rather roomed with Longbottom, Potter,
“So how are you then?” proffers Ron, heaving his feet up onto the couch and sliding them in next to Harry’s torso.
“We’re both okay with you too, Malfoy – Ron and I – if you can help Harry. Also, the apologies go a long way.”
The grease left by the sausage wasn’t deterred by his precise
The guilt pressing into his throat returned in full force; Draco couldn’t tell Potter
The clothes Draco had selected for him were practical and not at all what Harry had been expecting. Instead of the fancy, pleated slacks and silk shirts he was so fond of wearing, Draco had given Harry a plain black shirt, a black jacket, and dark jeans. Honestly, Harry didn’t know that Draco actually
“Me either,” said Hermione sadly. They sat mournfully for a few minutes before Draco cleared his throat and Transfigured his water into tea for both of them to break up the somber mood.
“’Mione, I’ve wanted Draco since Hogwarts, but I just didn’t realize what I was feeling until now. It’s hard to explain–” he breaks off.
They sat there under the stars for a few moments, the silence only broken by the soft sound of waves crashing up onto the beach. Harry broke the silence, finally bringing his musings to life. “After we pass the boards and get the promotion,” he said slowly, “Are we going back to London?”
“Well, I guess that’s okay then,” Draco said sleepily. “Lie down, already, and stop mauling me with that rag.”
Their small office felt even smaller under the oppressive presence of Commander Schrader. “Potter, did you finish filing the duty billets?” he demanded, menacingly glowering around the room. “And Weasley, what about those incident reports?” Without waiting for a response, he snapped,  “I told you lot that they needed to be filed before you two even
“I’d like to officially apologize for everything I did or said to you at school,” Draco said, trying not to cringe from the awkwardness of the situation. “I’m hoping we can have a fresh start.”
“I’m proud of us,” he whispered into the dark.
Draco didn’t even bother to look at her; he just kept on scrubbing the floor on his hands and knees; scrubbing like he had personally been commissioned to remove every speck of dirt from the floor.
“…have you tested it?” she asked.
Weasley gave Granger a betrayed look. Draco had to give her credit; she turned to him and snapped, “What, Ronald? Were you actually enjoying that?”
Two weeks had gone by since he’d left Harry, causing Draco to fall into a depression. He perfunctorily kept up with all his responsibilities related to academics, but failed to take care of himself in the most basic of ways. Though never a glutton, Draco couldn’t remember the last time he ate a proper meal. He didn’t care to. Again, without Harry, the local shopkeepers were less than keen to forgive his existence. He burrowed himself deeper into his afghan cocoon.
“Excuse me!” They looked up to see the coffee barista rapidly moving towards them, having finished with her customer. She cleared the dining room in seconds. “Excuse me, sirs,” she said, looking pointedly right at Harry, her voice grating on his already fried nerves. “We don’t allow outside food or beverage in our establishment, so you’ll need to leave.”
“I’ll go and get my stuff tomorrow,” Hermione said, closing her eyes. “Right now sounds like the perfect time for a nap…”
“Draco,” Harry inhaled. “Draco—”
“Not at all. In fact, I think I had a thing for him back when we were still at Hogwarts. It just took me seeing him dance like in
“But you were about to.”
The Grangers toasted as they unknowingly drank the potion, Mrs. Granger swirling it expertly in her glass and inhaling imaginary flavor notes. “This is quite good!” she exclaimed. “You certainly must put that one on your list.”
“Yes,” he breathes back, rotating around enough to take Draco’s lips with his own. This time, Draco gives himself fully to Harry, ghosting his fingers over Harry’s back and petting his hair, cheeks, and jawline.
“Which one, Malfoy?”
A dull flush crept up onto Draco’s cheeks and he started becoming warm in his suddenly much too-fluffy bathrobe.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, for sure,” Jake mumbled, “but I just wanted to ask you something first.”
,” gasped Melissa.
The rest of the spring passed easily and comfortably for Draco. He continued to excel at his grant writing internship, steadily earning the respect and confidence of Merram while also getting used to his new septum piercing. Draco started fretting about what he was going to do all summer, but Merram approached him in the beginning of May and said that he’d recommended Draco to one of his friends who ran a nonprofit and was looking to hire someone for fundraising, specifically grant writing. The man’s name was Danny, and he’d founded the San Diego Youth Baseball/Softball Association to ‘bring back the ball.’ Draco interviewed with Danny right after finals week, and he was thrilled to get the job.
Harry poured hot water into the teapot, adding in two tea bags as to make the tea extra strong, just how Draco liked it. He turned around, teapot in hand, with the intention of carrying it out to the kitchen table, but instead, he almost bumped into Draco. The slight shock sent the hot water roiling around in the teapot, almost coming out of the spout.
“Apparently not,” Harry says, sinking down into his chair. “He’s currently in the middle of a threesome. Yes, when I say ‘in the middle,’ I mean in the middle.”
Resignation dawned in Malfoy’s eyes, and for one quick second, Harry saw Malfoy’s disappointment and sadness shine through his mask. He could only imagine the thoughts going through Malfoy’s head right now after a lifetime of being rejected for what he wasn’t able to do.
Delighted with Potter's eagerness, Draco swept his hand towards the side door that let to the music room, green room, and several of Draco's favorite secret passages. “After you, Potter,” he said.
Hermione laughed. “Of course, you idiot,” she said, shoving Draco. “Obviously I’m not going to do it on my first try! What about you, is there an area of Potions you want to specialize in?”
Draco receives counsel from an unlikely source.
“Nope,” Harry replies happily. “He’s filling in for me on a temporary basis now, and then a permanent one later if he still has time to teach.”
After the Weasel and Granger finally escorted themselves home, Harry pounced on Draco. “I need to have you right here, right now,” he growled, pawing at Draco’s still-immaculately buttoned dress shirt and tie.
“You’re welcome, Potter,” Draco said, trying and failing to clear his mind. “It only makes sense that I would ask you to do something you’d enjoy; you’re the Golden Boy, after all.”
As Potter went to walk down the path decorated by fairy-lights, Draco quickly reached out and snagged his arm. “Potter,” he said in his most reasonable tone of voice. “Are you sure you’re up for this? We can postpone for another day, if you’d like.”
“Er, is this seat taken?” Draco wearily opened his eyes to find Harry Potter awkwardly staring at him, gesturing towards the other half of the bench. What was there even to say?
“Harry, I don’t think we can do this,” said Granger.
George met Draco’s eyes as if searching for maliciousness or deceit. Finally, he nodded and said, “Likewise.”
He finished re-doing the laces of his shoes and straightened up, only to find Draco carefully looking him over, expression still quite unreadable.
With a trace of seriousness, Ron asks, “Are you sure you’re ready to pursue some kind of
Harry rolled his eyes and held tightly to Malfoy as they Apparated to another mysterious destination.
“I’m perfectly aware,” he responded smoothly. Pansy opened her mouth to say more, but it was her turn to dump her refuse, and so she reluctantly pulled away and heaved her cart up to the staggering pile of shit.
“It was incredible,” Harry answered honestly. They shared a silent moment basking in the afterglow of the magic, but increasingly uncomfortable with the silence, Harry continued. “But I’m still not convinced that it counts, as I’ve never been in this cave before.”
As Malfoy approached, he called out, “Well, Potter? Ready to get this show on the road?” He subtly ignored the glares from several Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, who were passing by with candelabras. Harry locked eyes with Malfoy, but was instantly distracted by a motion just behind Malfoy. One of the Ravenclaws had lit a candlestick and was trying to subtly catch Malfoy on fire. Did she honestly not see Harry standing there, or think that he would refrain from intervening? Well, it was time to make an example out of someone trying to fuck with Malfoy.
Draco responded by swallowing around his cock, pressing the first finger in as Harry reacted in surprise and pleasure. He felt around for the prostate, feeling Harry tighten around him with inexperience and stress. “Shh,” he said, repositioning himself so that he could kiss and reassure Harry. “It’ll feel good soon, I promise.”
scream.
Ron waited until she got about five steps away before muttering, “You too, you old hag” under his breath. Harry thought he’d just about gotten away with it until, from behind them, there was a loud “Excuse me?!”.
, and though it was a little high and outside, most umpires still would have called it a strike. Nels threw it back to him calmly, though behind her mask he could make out a huge grin.
“I’m taking a shower,” Harry growled. “You lot better not pull any of this shit tonight.”
By god’s good grace, I’m
He attempted to flubber out a response, but Granger hoisted up her bag and stormed out of the Hall. For a moment, Draco wished he could follow her so he could get away from all the side-eye glances they were receiving and all the muffled whispers.
“And do you still feel something now?”
He passed it over and Ron chucked everything in the bin, much to the further irritation of the barista. She quickly composed herself, though, and with an infuriating customer service smile, started walking back to the counter after leaving them with an extremely disingenuous “Have a nice day.”
Draco met Mike’s eyes, wrinkling his nose and snorting dubiously. “As if. Of course he’s going to flip a shit, especially after Potter got his goat earlier.”
“What exactly did he say about the potion?” Malfoy inquires, continuing the massage.
Topsy disapparated with a
Finally, at quarter to two, Draco walks in the door. He’s dressed in what Harry expects is centuries-old Malfoy dueling attire, long, dark black robes with silver buttons done up to his throat. He looks around, and to anyone else, it would look dismissive and rather cold, but Harry can see Draco’s insecurity lurking behind the gesture. On the spur of the moment, Harry decides not to go up to him before the session. He’d rather not make Draco more nervous. Snatching Ron before he calls out to Draco, Harry quickly drags him up to the upper section of the seating area where they’re not likely to be seen.
“Thanks,” said Harry, continuing down another flight that led to the basement exit. “The layout of this sodding building still messes with me, even after how long we’ve been here.”
Draco reached a delicate hand out to claim his mimosa. Wisely—in Hermione’s opinion—he kept any comments about the mug to himself. “You’re a dear.”
Potter’s eyes narrowed and he glared at both of his supposed best friends. “I thought we were in this for life, all of us together. You’re telling me that because I’m dating a man I have to choose between you and him?”
was left unsaid.
him,” Harry smirked. “But Dolohov’s kicked your ass every time we’ve run into those scoundrels this year.”
“Malfoy, what the fuck?” he exclaimed.
“Why, it does appear to be wee little Potter!” Harry groaned. His head hurt and this shrill voice wasn’t helping.
Draco didn’t much like where this was going. Much as he thought Hermione would be better off without the Weasel, he did want her to be happy.
“Since when are you this inquisitive, Weasley?” Draco scoffed. “And why do you even care?”
“Honestly, Draco, you smell like that foul mold we found under the bathroom sink.”
Harry didn’t look ready to leave, though, and Draco was loathe to tear him away from the Weasleys, especially after how rocky their relations had been up until this point.
To his utter delight, though, Blaise was learning Latin too as part of his study in law and was more than suitable as a conversation partner. The two regularly exchanged letters (written entirely in broken Latin), which not only helped with his language skills, but also filled some of the space in Draco’s heart with their renewed friendship. With some wheedling from Blaise, Pansy had also come around, giving Draco a fair amount of grief for (in her words) “having dated the ‘Chosen One’,” but she also was genuinely interested in how he was doing and was even receptive to apologizing to Hermione for years of poor treatment. While their families were never Death Eaters, former Slytherins were being forced to adjust to the increasingly inclusive world or get left behind. Draco was glad to see his old friends starting to open their hearts and minds, just as he had done. It made it easier, in a way, to see that he wasn’t alone on that front.
“But what?” said Harry. “There’s just no one else you’re interested in, no matter how drunk you are or how many beautiful people you look at?”
“There you go,” said Hermione, sipping her tea. “Now you’re using your brain.” She went to say something else, but stopped herself.
“So am I,” Draco whispered back, snuggling in closer.
“It’s the Granger-Weasley house.”
“Well, I was right, wasn’t I?” grinned Nate, catching Cale’s eye flirtatiously.
“Yeah, I’ve realized that. But for some reason I can’t bring myself to accept it. I feel like I have to keep working and give back to the community.”
“It means a lot to me that you said yes,” Draco said quietly. “I really want to prove that I’m not a heartless bastard who’s just using you for your reputation.”
“To find you,” he says simply.
“God?!” Draco burst out laughing, knocking his metallic red devil horns clear off of his head. Harry picked them up for him because it didn’t look like Draco was calming down anytime soon.
“Actually, I might need the rest of the day. At least.” The owl gave him an inscrutable expression that was uncannily similar to Draco’s, but it consented to fly back over to the perch and hoot for more treats.
Another option was to go into the Muggle world, especially because it wasn’t as revolting a choice as it would have been for Draco back when he was in school. However, one of the things Draco relished about his existence was the ability to do magic. To pass as Muggle would be to obliterate part of his core identity. Of course, marrying a woman was also obliterating his sexual identity, but Draco preferred not to think too deeply about that.
“Place called Brawn, a little gem I found earlier this year. It’s wizard and muggle, but I still wouldn’t use too much magic.”
JULY 1998
Merram replied on Monday morning, asking Draco if he could come that afternoon. Draco could. He reluctantly put some of his nice pre-online-shopping-excursion clothes, and headed down to Merram’s office.

Caught up in despair, Draco set his coffee down on the bench next to him and leaned back, crossing his arms behind his head. He closed his eyes in defeat. If camp didn’t manage to break him, surely the Wizarding World would. Before leaving home, he’d been forced to have their Owl Post redirected to a third party solely because of the sheer volume of Howlers received daily. Draco let the helplessness and anger wash over him in droves, breathing deeply and vowing not to break down at camp. The rustic, beautiful house could still be a reality. It was a shame to have all of that land for one person, but he’d make do. There was no reason to abandon his dreams just because he was doomed to spend his life alone…
To break the silence, Harry turned around to grin at Malfoy. “Are we really going to make them do pushups?”
“None,” he answered gloomily, starting to fall back into the feelings of hopelessness and despair that had driven him to never want to leave his bed again.
“Boys, let’s not argue now,” came the weary voice of Mr. Weasley, suddenly canceling his own Disillusionment Charm. Everyone looked at him in surprise, including Charlie. “Indeed, welcome to the Burrow, Mr. Malfoy,” he said with a hopeful smile.
The girl who he thought looked like Pansy spoke up first. “I’m Melissa.”
There was an awkward silence, combined with the slight nausea Harry already felt from the tea. “Are we ready to get started?” Luna asked finally, dipping her finger into the Gurdyroot infusion and licking it.
“Actually, I should probably end the spell,” Draco said, almost reluctantly. By unspoken agreement, they both turned and started walking back toward home plate.
“Looks like it!” Harry laughs, and I can see the pure joy and happiness on his face.
Car still running, the guy took a drag of his cigarette. “Sheffield Lake. Shefftucky’s just a little nickname the locals use. Brah, do you make a habit of not knowing where the hell you are?”
“Jeez, Malfoy, that’s pretty deep,” he whispered while trying not to think of how the poor boy could possibly overcome his experience.
“Draco?” she called back, lounging around the living room in flannels. “Are you quite alright?”
There were no words for the rest of the morning. Even the Gryffindors were cruel, seeing as one of their own had saved the world while most Slytherins did nothing. Seamus Finnigan, from Potter’s year, redirected a cascade of falling rubble to rain down on Draco when he was busy trying to herd up a group of baby Mandrakes. It hurt, and he wasn’t as familiar with common healing spells as he should be. As it was, he had to suffer his bruised back and broken toes until he could ask Mother for help.
“No, come on, Malfoy,” said Potter, jumping to his feet and yanking on Draco’s hand. “I can’t say I saw the butterfly garden but not the butterflies because my lazy tour guide decided to take a nap.”
put on a show.
“Yeah, Martians,” Harry snickered. “You know, the ones you were singing about earlier? How did it go? ‘A wibbly wobbly wibbly wu, a hula hula hu’?”
Malfoy’s face twisted. “Now, now, Potter,” he said slowly, “Try not to think so hard. It’s difficult to make assumptions about things you know
“Here, Malfoy,” instructed Potter, running over yet again and putting the ball back into Draco’s hand. “This is called the K stance.” He positioned Draco’s body accordingly but rather uncomfortably. Draco made a face, to which Potter replied, “It gets better the more you do it. You’ll use this for your infield throws, and if you extend your arm back just a bit–” he took Draco’s arm and stretched it fully back “–you can do outfield throws. Throw it at that spot on the fence.” Draco moved his back into infield stance and threw. His arm rotated over his shoulder naturally, and he had a lot more control than when he’d simply lobbed it. “That’s great,” said Potter enthusiastically.
She ignored him. “Draco, what if I told you, what I asked you to believe that muggles really aren’t so different than wizards?”
“I dunno, he was talking about how Harry’s trust had already been violated and he wasn’t about to make it worse or something,” Ron remembers, squinting up his face in concentration.
“I’m going to kiss you now,” he says, “If that’s okay.”
“I’ll open yours, you open mine?”
“I feel the same,” said Draco, tucking the necklace back into Harry’s shirt and rebuttoning his collar. “Please don’t glamor it anymore. I want to be reminded on days that aren’t my near-deathday anniversary.”
“We take care of our own,” Cale insisted. “Like it or not, love, you’re one of us now.”
“Yeah, I am.” There was no point in denying it.
“Definitely herbal. The blueberry, not the peach.”
“Wait,” said Potter. “That came out all wrong.”
He settled himself onto the picnic table and waited for their nightly staff meeting to happen. Beans was present, and so were Draco’s co-counselors, but Potter’s group was taking a while. Eventually Potter’s co-counselor’s emerged, and they said Potter was having trouble getting one of the campers to relax. Eventually, Beans decided to reschedule the meeting for tomorrow, and though everyone else said their goodnights, Draco stayed at the picnic table, waiting for Potter.

The exchange had only taken a few seconds, but to Draco, it felt like years. McGonagall was still talking. “—any eighth year interested in knowing their roommate ahead of time will be able to view the room assignment list, which has been posted on the seventh-floor announcement board. More details will be made available on Monday at the start of our new term. Good day, and let our final restorations recommence!” Applause broke out, but Draco and Harry shared only one quick look before dashing off to access the master list.
to Muggle fast food joints if it was on his dollar.
lying. And then Asten came in.”
responds.”
They simply stood in silence for a moment, each lost in thought. Finally, Draco said, “Potter, I hope your schedule is clear for today.”
“We’ve been eating a lot healthier too here,” Hermione said. “The French, they’re used to buying fresh produce and bread every day and Draco and I have gotten into the habit of that too. So we usually only have on hand what we’re going to eat for lunch or dinner.”
“I did it for Harry’s sake,” she said, “But you’re welcome all the same, Malfoy.”
The words he held back about being hateful and angry at Harry for leaving him, about the sadness that flowed over him like a sickness ever since the first day they’ve been apart? Draco feared those would be expressed all too well should he put the quill to the parchment.
“I’d much rather not,” Harry remarks, thinking about how many Seekers he’s seen break bones because of poor execution. “But really, Draco, you did excellent today.”
“You too, Ron.” As he watched his best mate excitedly stride away, Harry couldn’t summon up any enthusiasm of his own. He was restless, unfulfilled. The Division was closed until the New Year and he suddenly had a lot of time to spare, with Ron out for the night. They’d already explored all of San Diego over the last three years, and had even ventured into the desert, mountains, and beaches across the southern part of the state. While California would never be home, Harry had a lot of respect for the land and the different cultures he had been introduced to, particularly the vibrant gay districts. But tonight, he didn’t feel like passing the time away with some cute thing on his arm, even if said hottie could hold a steady conversation and match him drink for drink. Apparating back to London was out of the question, even if it was something he could fathom in his more-than-slightly intoxicated state.
When Draco finally switched with one of his co-counselors and was allowed to come back into the shade, he was relieved to see that the counselors were sitting amongst the campers on the picnic benches. He squeezed onto the end of one of the outside benches, so that the other three were behind him. Noticing that their unit director, Beans, who stayed in their living unit with them and flitted from group to group to oversee the counselors, was present, Draco decided to strike up a conversation with the camper sitting next to him instead of daydreaming about literally anything else but camp. At least his “Me Time” wasn’t too far away.
“Let’s go, Potter,” sniffed Malfoy, breaking the spell. “I haven’t got all night.”
Harry ignored him and slipped into the bathroom, warming the water before wetting a flannel and cleaning his skin. He went back into the bedroom and gave Draco the same treatment, though slightly more gently, as he was still pouting.
“If you truly think that,” said Hermione, finally taking a sip, “Then you’re the real bonehead here. So he might have an STI—so what? He’s not the only one that’s ‘tainted’, Draco.” She pointedly looked at his left arm. “Some people are just more deserving of second chances, I guess.”
When Abalona returned, three days later, Draco was surprised to see a small package attached to her leg.
“Why?”
Mrs. Weasley’s face was inscrutable. Draco couldn’t tell if he was helping matters or hurting them. He decided, in a very Harry-esque way, to keep going.
Draco didn’t waste any time. He threw himself at Potter, knocking him onto the bed and fighting for dominance before he realized it might actually be quite nice if Potter took charge. He had to give Potter credit for only taking a minute to pick up on that cue, for he gently wrested Draco to the bed and pinned his hands down above his hands.
day. Draco hated to admit that the interview and the photoshoot had taken quite so much out of him, but, truthfully, he was exhausted. After eating their weight in treacle tart and leaving the
Draco and Potter had gone to feel the fluffy orange mane at the same time, brushing their fingers in the process. Smiling, Potter gently picked up Draco’s frozen fingers and trailed them through the soft fur. “See, Malfoy? A perfect animal.”
“What
“Why is the floor covered in dishcloths?”
Granger beamed. Draco scowled, but secretly felt a wave of comfort hit. This was normal, Granger showing him up in class. Her intuitions didn’t take away from his knowledge, but, as usual, she bested him seemingly without trying.
“Cause you really are going to be fantastic at this,” Potter whispered. “I wasn’t nearly as good as you after my first week of hardcore practice. You were made for this sport, Malfoy.”
Across from him, Draco massaged his temples with the palms of his hands. “This entire year is a nightmare.”
“He WHAT?”
He didn’t know what to say to himself. “Sorry I gave up on you?" “It’s better this way, you coward?" “This is exactly what you deserve, you Death Eater scum?"
His admission essays, on the other hand, were 100% real, though Draco had to be vague on some of the finer details. For example, for “What was the greatest challenge you’ve faced thus far, and how did you overcome it?” Draco wrote about joining the Death Eaters and following Voldemort, receiving the Dark Mark, and being ordered to kill innocent people. He assumed that the admissions committee would just assume that he’d been in some sort of gang, and left it at that. On Monday, Draco had felt Otarres’s eyes scrutinize his Dark Mark. He’d supposed that Otarres would just think of it as an interesting tattoo, but knowing that Otarres had read his admissions essay (which was quite personal, he might add) caused Draco to think that perhaps his professor had ulterior motives in helping him. Draco didn’t feel insulted–he knew that he had each of the skills the professor had named– and wasn’t complaining because it was rare that someone could see past the morally questionable things he’d done and help him with a second chance.
Harry bit back a remark about how that much was obvious and forced himself to accept the apology. “Don't be sorry,” he said, pulling Draco into his arms. “Just don’t do it again.”
Harry appreciated Nels a great deal. If there was anyone who had a chance of getting Becky Lou to back off, it was Nels. She was a fierce baseball player with a pure talent for picking off baserunners. Off the field, however, she had a heart of gold. Though completely straight, Nels had saved Harry from an uncomfortable situation last week by turning the tables on Becky Lou by flirting shamelessly with
He sighed, carding his fingers through his hair. “There’s more than a little complacency in our program, to be sure, but we’re not at the only institution, remember. Beijing was more focused on Medical Potionry.”
have good taste in food.”
Their night had started out reasonably well. Harry arrived at the office 10 minutes early, anxious for an adventure. Dawlish was smug at the thought of taking the famous Harry Potter out on a mission, and preened quite as Harry expected him to. But the feeling of doing something worthwhile again had him enjoying the excursion regardless. Dawlish had received a tip that Avery and Mulciber were trying to form and lead a new dark organization. For Harry’s special first outing, he had planned for them to go and apprehend Avery, figuring his charge was itching to get his hands dirty. The Ministry had never considered Avery to be that much of a threat.
“Yeah, well, someone was busy primping.”
When it came time to hit the inside corner, Draco tensed up again. In the batter’s box, Potter seemed to sense his struggle.
Thankfully, Potter took the lead with introductions, making marks on their roster as each girl said her name. There was no way he was going to remember all of these names. Just joining the baseball team had been taxing enough for Draco; he could recall faces quite easily but names never seemed to stick, no matter what mnemonics he tried.
Potter’s still completely dressed, so Draco worms Potter’s shirt over his head and rubs at his nipples, paying attention to how his lover sharply inhales and mewls at his ministrations.
“That’s not what I meant at all; obviously you return his affections, so together you can stand united against public opinion.”
Since then, Draco had adopted a persona of careful nonchalance not so different than his usual demeanor at Hogwarts. However, where the idea back then had been to coolly attract as much attention as possible, with his dates he strove for the opposite. It was always an especially good feeling when, after being ignored all evening, the insulted woman stormed out of the restaurant before dessert. Draco would order the most delectable chocolate cake on the menu and eat it delicately, thinking about how much time he’d need to spend running the next day to burn off the calories but not letting the thought deter him.
The wedding was still planned and he was still living in this dank, dark space with an oppressive father and reluctant mother. He could never prosper here, could never be who he truly was. Instead of trying to kill himself as a way out, Draco reflected, he should have simply just left home. Even if he was disowned, it would be worth it.
“Because we’re better than that,” Hermione insisted, glaring at the joint Harry was currently smoking. “What about that one in the front seat?”
Eventually, Draco not only refused to leave the Manor, he no longer left his room. Narcissa received many worried fire calls from members of the house elf staff, expressing concern for Master Draco and pleas for her to return home and re-energize him. She had quite hoped he would have the drive to conquer the obstacles thrown at him and start a new life as well. Unfortunately, Narcissa’s most trusted elf, Ceeley, Apparated to Northpass on Sunday afternoon and told her that Draco was no longer eating or leaving his bed. Disappointed, she finally arranged a visit to the Malfoy Manor.
“Harder,” Draco begged, gripping Harry’s back tightly. He picked up his legs and wrapped them around Harry’s waist, squeezing them closer together. Per Draco’s request, Harry thrust harder, but in a very controlled way. Draco had to admire his obvious self-restraint.
“That’s not what I meant—"
“Ah, good, Potter, you’re right on time,” said Malfoy from behind him, entering the foyer from a side office.
Equally furious, Harry took his opportunity. “Sir, I almost had him! We could have been one step closer to finding out if the Death Eaters really are establishing a new Dark regime…that is, if we could have caught them.” He left his vicious thoughts about how slow Dawlish was out of the conversation.
All too soon, the toy wasn’t meeting his needs anymore. With more patience than he cared to muster, Draco Transfigured his hairbrush into a moderately sized dildo, the last preparation before it was time to use the one he really craved. After the slim toy was removed with no fuss, Draco again lubed his arse and fought to keep his anal muscles relaxed. It took a little longer to insert the bigger dildo, and he found his hand slipping on the base as he attempted to budge the toy past his inner sphincter.
“Keep your pants on, Malfoy.” They walked towards the castle, through scrubby grass in between the rows and rows of rows of stubby bushes, Draco pulling Harry along.
“What does that have to do with us having sex?”
It was so much fun to tease Potter. Draco had no intention of letting him go out of the house wearing low-quality clothing, and he especially wouldn’t let him look anything less than impeccable. Draco decided that, at least for today, he had control over everything about Potter’s appearance except for his hair. That was absolutely a lost cause.
“Are you going to need help packing?” asked Neville.
“It’s called money, Potter,” grates Malfoy. His hand tightens in Harry’s hair, but he takes a deep breath and makes an obvious effort to calm down. “Obviously you did not read the special issue of the
, they crashed into each other, Ange ricocheting off of the muscular Iz and landing face-first on the ground. Maisie, the last outfielder, covered her mouth as she snickered unabashedly. There was great chemistry between the three girls which had them already comfortable joking around and laughing at each other. Harry was grateful for this connection. It was invaluable on his team and Merlin knew they were going to need it. Especially at this rate.
Eyes closed, Draco reveled in the sensations until Potter suddenly stopped moving and his hands came to rest on Draco’s hips. It was only after he opened his eyes that he realized Potter was asking for his consent to go further.
Kingsley chuckled. “Take the night off. There will be plenty of time for you and Draco to get your hands dirty later.”
“Thank you, sir,” Draco finally managed. His throat had constricted painfully upon hearing Otarres say such nice things about him, and also realizing that his professor might indeed know him more intimately than he originally thought.
Fortunately, a place to stay was taken care of with relative ease, nothing like the careful plotting and planning he’d been doing before. Draco situated himself and sat down to think about how he wanted the next chapter of his life to look. Even if it didn’t involve Harry, Draco was going to make something of himself. He was going to find happiness wherever he could.
“What makes you think I want anything at all?” Malfoy spat out.
“That’s it? Seriously, that’s all he wrote?”
Draco was thrilled to be working with the grumpy man even though he experienced a touch of unease with the name Harry, as it just brought back too many memories. He specialized in grumpy though, so it wouldn’t be too much of challenge for him to be a superior grump to the man with the delectable ass. He admitted to himself that he would rather that the man be nice so Draco could get to know him and convince him to let Draco fondle those perky ass cheeks.
“That’s what I like to hear. Have a nice holiday, gentlemen,” Schrader said as he took his leave. “I’ll have another stack of duty billets for you in the New Year…” Harry was unable to restrain himself from flicking his wand to close the door forcibly behind Schrader, shutting out any noise.
“We did,” confirms Harry, throwing Ron some quick side-eye shade. “You were fantastic, Draco.”
“Bring it down a little,” instructed José. “Nels!” he shouted. “See how well he can hit the corners.”
Finally, after moments of twisting it around and around in his hands, he uncorked the glass and heavily restrained himself from giving it a sniff. There was no need for a reminder of just how foul the potion was. Draco reached around for the trousers he was wearing earlier and extracted the asphodel, taking care not to spill the vial. He wasn’t going to be allowed to leave the house again because Father had already taken all the necessary precautions.
Hermione nodded, and dropped the matter for the time being. Still arm in arm with Harry, she led the way to the kitchen. As they walked, Harry looked around appreciatively. “Nice place you’ve got here,” he said approvingly. “I see Draco’s touch everywhere…” his gaze lingered on the Draco’s prized afghan, the rich maroon and silver one draped over the couch. “It’s beautiful.”
Actually, there wasn’t much that could rile Harry up anymore. He simply felt too empty inside, too far removed from everyone around him. Even when visiting Ron and Hermione there was still a void inside of him that he could not fill, a void that caused him much melancholy. He would act glum and gloomy quite often, but his friends put up with his behavior while discouraging it heavily. Sometimes he would forget himself and become consumed with their good humor, but it was happening less and less lately.
“It’s my final reparation to you,” he said determinedly. “For all the horrible things I did to you while we were at Hogwarts. You gave me another chance after I started dating Harry, even though I hardly deserved it. You became my best friend and even though I’ve done what I could for you, I never eased the burden I put upon you all those years ago.”
“Oh,” said Hermione miserably. “I’m so happy for you, Malfoy, and Harry too.”
“If I apologized,” Ron said, “Would you even be able to forgive me?”
“The nature of my and Draco’s relationship is none of your business,” Harry snapped. “And as for the rest of you? No comment.” He made to slam the door in the reporters’ faces, but before it had the chance to shut completely, the initial reporter yelled out, in a voice that carried, “Mr. Potter, is it true that Draco Malfoy lets you take him from behind?” Thankfully, the door latched shut before he had time to curse out that insensitive git.
“Yes… sir.”
He was only partially successful; the cookie batter was jostled out of the bowl as she jumped and turned around to face him.
“Bring it in!” hollered Nate, cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting loud enough for the players in the grassy field to hear. He caught Draco’s eye, signaling him that it was time to come down, and Draco got the feeling Nate had known he was there all along.
Draco’s imagination took him to the fantasyland where he’d been spending entirely too much time lately. He dreamed of him and Potter in bed together, Potter’s warm hands opening him up before lovingly entering Draco with his long, thick cock. The mere thought of Potter's member was enough to make Draco hard. He desperately wished to just have Potter one time, to allow Potter inside of him, but knew he'd never settle for anything less than being with Potter in mind, body, and soul.
Draco didn’t respond. Slightly disappointed, Harry wetted his finger again and resumed fingering Draco, feeling around for his prostate. This went on for another couple of minutes – Draco offering no reaction – until there was a very sulky response.
“Now you know how I feel when you talk about Malfoy,” declares Ron, satisfied.
“You’re sure you’re ready to have a relationship, mate?” Ron finds his voice, but it’s still uncertain.
in a game.”
Harry felt a huge grin stretch across his face even as his arousal stretched his trousers in quite the same fashion. “I thought you’d never ask,” he whispered back, weak in the knees.
“I never would have pegged you for a breakfast person,” said Harry thoughtfully as Malfoy continued to drag him into the restaurant. “I imagined you nursing a cup of coffee while I ate myself into oblivion.”
“You can call me Draco, you know,” I say, turning back to the horizon, “When it’s just us up here.”
“Potter, just move your damn arm already,” Draco ordered, losing his posh accent in his irritation.
They were only a couple minutes in when Draco finally touched it, causing Harry to whimper and clench tighter around him, clutching the sheets with his free hand.
“It was. I already feel much better.”
“It wouldn’t be the first time,” says Ron suggestively, giving Harry a shit-eating grin and rolling his hips.
Long before he wanted to, Draco was drifting off to sleep in Harry’s arms.
of something down on the field caught his eye; he was drawn instantly to a small white ball, only slightly bigger than a snitch, which had come careening off of something like a Beater’s bat down below. Harry unconsciously stood up in his seat and leaned over the railing, watching one of the three men in the grass field run furiously to catch the ball and then throw it back towards another man standing on the dirt. What were those nutty things on their hands? Why did the man who hit the ball start running? Harry had a thousand questions, and an aching, insane desire to join the men out in the grass.
. Good to know. He was never coming back here again in his natural life.
Draco never would have noticed how amusing Potter was with his continuous
The ringleader walked towards Draco until he stood directly underneath him. He spoke quietly, so no one else could hear, and said, “You thought you were such a big man, with Daddy’s protection and the threat of the ‘Dark Lord’ behind every word you said.” He uttered a spell under his breath before waving his wand, causing Draco to feel a strange pressure in his lower stomach. “Power always got to your head. When I was just a second year, you got me a detention and lost Hufflepuff twenty points just because I had my tie done up the wrong way. Now it’s your turn to suffer.”
“Marseille, ici je viens!”
Laughing, Potter finally quitted the room. Even after he left, Draco stood in the shower, weak in the knees. Potter was going to be the death of him, he was sure of it. No matter, it would be a good death, and Draco would happily embrace it. Resolved, he finally stepped out of the shower and reached for his clothes.
“Perhaps, Potter. A broken clock is right twice a day, after all.”
“You do too,” said Draco generously. “So you live in New York now?”
“Just making sure you didn’t fall asleep on the ride out here!” returned Nate. “You’re going to have to get used to playing after tiring conditions! Don’t think that the kids are going to go easy on you – yes, I’m looking at you, Zee.”
Sleep did not come naturally. It never did, anymore. Between vivid nightmares of Potter daringly rescuing him from the fire in the Room of Requirement or being forced to torture others while in the employ of Lord Voldemort, Draco could not feel completely at ease.
Ceeley obliged, and fetched Draco that morning’s edition of the
With a knowing smirk, the guy asked, “You
He takes a swig of whiskey before continuing. “So the first act was really boring – just some hula dancing – but the second performance had five guys dressed in trench coats and red thongs working the audience. Each of them chose a person to incorporate into the act, and this one bloke picked me. We tangoed, and then he kissed me on the lips.”
“Now I recall,” said Malfoy gleefully. “And you owe me five Galleons as well!” he boasted, taking another swig of tea.
“This one’s not the perfect choice, but it’s a reasonable fit,” said Hermione, after they’d skimmed all four issues. “It deals with all facets of the Dark Arts--objects, spells and wand components, not only Potions.”
It was too much for Mike and José; they bent double laughing as even Nate couldn’t hold back any longer and joined them. Zee, the shortstop who up until this point had been obsessively re-lacing his cleats, could be heard unsubtly snickering as well (and he was usually more composed than Nate). It was well known on the team that Becky Lou was only into women, but she flirted shamelessly with her teammates – especially Harry. He had no idea how to get her off his back, and now was no exception: he flushed a bright shade of red as Nels the catcher shouted from home plate “Bring it in! Looks like there’s thunder!” Practicing in the rain was fine, if cold and wet, but the team couldn’t take any chances with metal bats getting struck by lightning.
“Draco,” Nate said, startling the other man as he tapped his clipboard impatiently. “What position do you feel most comfortable in so far?”
When they finally sat down with platters of meat, eggs, pancakes, fruit, and fresh orange juice, Hermione met Draco’s eyes with nervous anticipation. “Neither of us is religious,” she stated, rather obviously, “But I feel as though we should say some kind of grace. It feels appropriate.”
He finished writing and shoved the note over to Hermione, who quickly skimmed it.
“Fine,” Draco conceded, heading into the bathroom. He took a moment to set everything up, peeling off his clothes with a grimace, before turning on the water.
hole?” She didn’t know where it came from, that venom. Being out here in France with Draco was healing, and Hermione had worked hard to try and overcome the pain of their breakup. Apparently some hurts could quickly come back up to the surface, especially when the main cause of them was standing right there on her front porch.
, this one’s coming right to you.”
“Yes?” Draco replied dully.
“My laptop’s over here,” Malfoy said to Chris and Cale, ushering them inside his bedroom. Now
“Well, what does it say?” demands Ron eagerly, looking almost as anxious as Harry.
“It sounds fine,” Hermione said. “He’s not going to care about that, I promise.”
“So are you down?”
There was the blunt sound of a walking stick hitting the floor, and they all looked up to see the arrival of Lucius Malfoy, hair tied severely back. “My son is not a faggot,” he said, lip slightly curling. “Draco, do as your mother told you.”
Malfoy closes his eyes. “An overheard conversation. One between a father and son where the boy admitted he’d been forced into something and the father told him that only women were taken against their wills. In the same breath, he first insinuated that men can’t be raped, and then implied that if they are, well their status is equal to a woman’s. Because, of course, women are automatically worth less than men.”
Through gritted teeth, Harry relented. “I’ll listen.”
Sure enough, when he arrived home, Father took one sniff before glaring daggers at Draco.
Draco and Harry’s relationship blossoms as the two grow closer together. They spend large chunks of the summer together, a setup that is only deterred slightly by Draco’s return to school. Harry prepares lesson plans for the following year while Draco brews complicated potions and studies Potions theory, each relishing the company of the other.
, to memory. He waited for a distraction that would never come, as Ron and Hermione were both swamped with their new career choices too. Ron had chosen to become a Healer, a profession that required at least 2 more years of school, sometimes 3. He was staying in a small flat near St. Mungo’s with Hermione, who was working part time to help rebuild the Ministry while also studying full time to become an instructor at Hogwarts.
“Excuse me, mug-” Draco caught himself, barely. “Lady. Where the bloody hell am I?”
“Tea, ‘Mione?” Ron asked, passing two shots of espresso over to Harry, who started assembling their drinks.
Malfoy sighed. He looked quite pained. “Okay. We’ll figure this out,” he said soothingly, or at least as soothingly as Harry thought he could be.
to consider the possibility. What had he been drinking last night? Oh yeah, the rum. Draco vowed to have a nice bonfire that night as he burned every last bottle.
“Great!” said Nate, eagerly checking them off his list. “That’s everyone then. Go get set up – we’re going to stretch now."
“Can you pass me another sample?” said Mr. Granger. “We’re wine aficionados, so please keep them coming.”

Other counselors were milling around the Lodge, but Draco ignored them. As long as Potter’s and Macmillan’s boss wasn’t creeping about, no one else could do anything to him that would be of consequence. Skirting the office, he went straight for the coffee maker and poured himself a cuppa. It was just that kind of day, so he indulged in soymilk and chocolate flavoring.
“Yes.” Draco’s breath hitches and Harry already feels his balls contracting. The sight of Draco’s closed eyes and flushed face sends him over the edge, and they writhe together in pleasure. Harry erupts deep into his lover as Draco spurts sharp white lines over both of their torsos, and after the fact they drift together on the verge of sleep, holding one another in a state of bliss.
“Sing?”
Cale and Chris, in the process of stalking Zillow, briefly waved goodbye and Potter practically hurled a baseball glove into his chest as they finally walked out into the falling sunlight.
“More or less.”
Exhausted, and slightly miffed by his owl’s judgement, Draco collapsed back onto the sofa and snuggled up with, of all things, with the amigurumi lion that he’d had the poor sense to retrieve when he’d fetched his writing supplies. And at last, he slept soundly.
to be in France, working on his Mastery. He
“That’s great, Harry!” Ginny cried, launching herself across the kitchen and into Harry’s arms. He didn’t pull back, for a change, instead putting his hand in her bright red hair and meeting her lips in a rough kiss.
Draco heard a house elf yelling downstairs, and quickly deduced that they too were having issues with the lack of available water. Well, all the more reason to leave tomorrow. He’d use the rest of the afternoon and evening for packing, and then be off in the morning. Narcissa could get the water reinstated for the elves on Monday.
“Really,” Harry said, flirting back.
“It’s called 'butterfly kissing',” said Potter, arms still covered in butterflies. There must have been question on his face, because Potter continued, “Muggles put their faces really close together, line up their eyes, and then blink really fast so their eyelashes touch.”
“Weasley,” Draco said, matching Ron’s tone. Harry could see the struggle it was taking for him to not openly antagonize Ron. He seemed to have made peace with the other Weasleys, but somehow Harry knew that he and Ron would never turn out to be the best of mates. To say the least. “You may proceed.”
Hermione sat in the chair next to him, putting a warm hand on his forearm. “Do you want to talk about it yet?” she asked mildly.
They fell on the bed together, Harry already unbuttoning Ginny’s blouse and unhooking her bra. She sharply inhaled as his mouth fell over her taunt nipples, running her hands through his hair. He kissed her again then, fingers taking the place of where his mouth had been seconds earlier. Ginny undid his trousers and stroked his length through his boxes, sighing contentedly. Harry responded in kind by nipping at the tender skin around the nape of her neck, sliding up her skirt; backing up long enough to pull off his boxers and trousers while she removed her panties.
Unsure what to say, he looks at Malfoy. “Malfoy, I’m so sorry. That sounds much worse than what happened to me –”
Potter relaxed into Draco’s touch, turning his head around so their eyes locked. “Do you mean it?” he asked.
When he woke up again, the first thing he noticed was his wedding ring. Somehow not surprised, Draco found that yet more time had passed when he rose from the bed and looked at himself in the mirror. He wasn’t
“Slow down, Potter,” Draco said. “Remember how we were talking about taking breaks? You’re on one now.
, he thought to himself.
“There’s a ring on your bloody finger!”
He finally settled on “Has your group gone to the challenge course yet?” which surprisingly caused her face to light up. She was in the middle of telling Draco all about how she’d scaled the hardest side of the rock wall when Beans caught his eye from a few feet away and made a come here gesture.
The door was pulled open behind the Weaselette, and all three jumped in surprise. Draco couldn’t help breathing a sigh of relief to see that it was just one of the Weasely twins, the one who lost his counterpart in the War. He definitely experienced a rush of guilt over that, especially as the twin—George, Draco thought his name was—rushed through the doorway and pulled Harry into a huge hug, on the doorstep and all.
. Pansy was always quite taken with him at Hogwarts so he’d allowed her to preen all over him and otherwise pretend that they were dating. Part of that had included sleeping with her. Draco hadn’t minded; she usually initiated and it was pleasurable enough, but sex wasn’t something he needed or even craved. Kissing Jake had awoken some hidden part of himself that enjoyed being physical with a man much more than with a woman (or at least Pansy).
The next day, Harry wakes up hungover with a headache. He wrestles himself into the bathroom for a Pepper Up Potion, and after downing it, coaxes his body into the hot shower. It feels like heaven on his sore muscles, and Harry entertains the notion of asking Kreacher for a backrub. All former dislike aside, he still has the feeling it wouldn’t go over so well.
jeans. They fit him well, regardless; something else he wasn’t expecting.
“Exactly,” breaks in Seamus. “You just don’t want to pony up after that pay cut the Aurors took at the Ministry this week.”
the ball sailed off the bat and flew to the right of Nate. He was prepared, and ran at it with all his might. Even with the enormous effort expended, the ball still missed Nate’s leather hand by a sliver and continued on its path to the grassy part of the field.
Before we have the chance to complain any more, chairs are being scraped against the ground all around us as staff members from the two camps mix, mingle, and set off in the general direction of the activities.
, dressed in short shorts and working for a muggle non-profit organization. There was something totally
“I’m just telling it like it is.”
As Draco was drifting off to sleep, spooned tightly against Harry’s chest, there was a determined whisper. “Draco,” Harry hissed. “Wake up.”
“Oh no?” asked Potter, pulling himself back into the moment with difficulty. He retrieved another piece of Draco’s favorite banana bread and waved it under his nose. “I guess you’ll have to show me then.”
“Shall we consider them over a pint, then?”
Draco shook Charlie’s hand, staring only for the briefest of moments at his expansive tattoos. “Well, thank you very much, Charlie.”
“Right,” said Harry. “I’ll buy you a beer, too, if you get me one of those nice little pies up there by the register.”
Draco released the box and, still nude, sank down to his knees and pulled his forearms up to his face. It was all coming back to him now: his former-Death-Eater status, the memory of days spent in bed, his mother’s visit and entirely unexpected heart to heart, and her endearments for him to pursue a muggle lifestyle. Well, here was proof she hadn’t forgotten. And good God, he’d
“Yeah, yeah,” he muttered. Shouldering the bat in a way that would probably make Nate have an aneurysm should he ever see, Draco tossed the uncomfortably large softball in the air and hit it with a sharp
The team jeered and roared with Harry joining in, feeling utterly and completely at home in a way he hadn’t since the war ended. Nate shouted “Bring it in!” and thrust his fist into the middle of the circle. Everyone else piled their hands on top of his, and yelled “ONE! TWO!  JOE BUCK YOURSELVES!”
“I know,” Hermione said. “I feel terrible.”
“Draco,” said Harry, making eye contact for the first time since Draco had entered the kitchen, “We need to talk.”
“Can we
The Weaselette disappeared back inside with an apologetic expression, leaving the three of them on the front stoop.
“My top school’s in France too.”
Even though it was late, even though he was quivering with excitement, and even though he didn’t know if Harry would actually accept him, Draco went to the flat where, in the scenario, he and Harry had lived first. With courage he was determined to exercise, Draco reached up and knocked on Harry’s door.
They arrived precisely at eleven, though Harry was hesitant to knock on the door. Draco ended up doing the honors. Any other time and he would have made a crack about how he wasn’t sure if the house would come crashing down or not from just the simple touch, but he thought it best not to rile an already-quivering Harry. Not that he would mention to Harry that he was quivering, either. The stubborn prat had been insisting all morning that no, he was
Draco can’t remember when he last saw Potter this mad. It wasn’t when he posed as a Dementor during a Quidditch match, when he took bets on how long Potter would last during the Triwizard Tournament, or even when he tried to cast an Unforgivable at Potter in their eventful sixth year. In fact, Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen Potter this angry. Sure, it was strange, but Draco was almost relieved the Saviour was on his side for a change.
Predictably, Draco jumped before exclaiming, “Potter, what the fuck was that?!”
“—he’s really quite right, you know, and, to be quite honest, Malfoy, you can still be a right berk sometimes, but you’re actually not so awful anymore.”
,” huffed Draco, “What exactly was our agreement?”
get some sleep.”
“You don’t have to worry about Bill, either,” Charlie informed them. “We’ve always been close, and he’s the rebel of the family anyway.”
He was halfway through a story involving an awkward mix-up at an American restaurant (“Our waitress was deaf, and when I said I’d like the bangers, please, she said the only gangsters she knew of were out in the alley next door!”) when they heard the front door shut, followed by footsteps making their way toward the kitchen. Hermione and Ron appeared a few seconds later, Ron with a goofy grin on his face and Hermione with an expression of near contentedness.
For a moment, they stood looking at the closed door, having been stunned into silence. Harry met Draco's eyes, afraid of what he might see. But Draco wasn’t wearing any emotion at all on his countenance; in fact, he was entirely unreadable. Behind him, a small crowd of stragglers had formed, having wandered down from breakfast to enjoy the lake and cool breeze.
They’d lie together afterwards, of course, curled up against each other with the promise of a full day ahead of them. Not just a full day, thought Draco regretfully, but a full life. Because with Potter, he strayed out of thought and time as both stretched into unfathomable lengths of nothingness and everything all at the same time. Their life together would be interesting, to say the least.
Harry immediately crashed on the couch, throwing his feet up on the arm. “Oh, bollocks, we forgot the files.”
“Are you going to accept?”
He collapsed on his bed, not caring that his fancy dress robes were rumpled or that the pristine bed sheets were now wrinkled underneath him. There was no substitute for comfort, after all, even though it went against what Draco had been led to believe for the past twenty-two years.
“Back to my flat would be fine, I guess,” Harry mumbles, tuning back in to the events of the evening.
They stood together for a long moment, watching pure, white butterflies flutter around the lavender stalks, hovering in the air before taking flight again. Slowly Potter started walking down one of the cut paths to stand among the lavender and the butterflies. Draco followed him, admiring how well Potter seemed to fit in with his world—at least, the outdoor one.
“Oh, alright,” Draco scowled, a slight blush coming over his pale cheeks. “I’ve always wanted to bottom for you, but we don’t have to do it that way—you clearly like it as well.”
“Don’t forget to put me on there as well,” said Nate. “Okay, so with you three already onboard, that just leaves Chris, Becky Lou, Zee, José, and Mike.”
“What do you mean?” replies Potter, never slowing his movements.

George laughed. “Why bother taking them?  No one’s going to turn the Golden Boy away from a job,” he said cheekily. “Unfortunately, that’s not true for either of you,” George continued, giving Ginny and Draco an apologetic look.
“Even if you only passed the second-class boards by one point,” Ron sniggered. “You still passed, and that’s what counts—”
They announce the next batch of activities on the schedule before we get to blessedly, mercifully
“It’s wonderful,” Draco--traitor--responded, holding his teacup at an angle so that Luna couldn’t possibly see it was no longer a horrible shade of blood-red.
“Hmm,” Harry pretends to think, trying not to let on how good it feels when Draco touches him. “Well, treacle tart is only my absolute favorite food in the whole world.”
, Draco noticed Potter observing him. For effect, he allowed his hips to sashay from side to side, hopefully drawing Potter’s attention by accentuating his arse.
And in the end, he always chose the exact same first move. It was the best way forward.
“Potter,” Draco said reluctantly. “You don’t understand. It’s simply not about the destination for me.”
“They’re right here, sir,” Harry said, interrupting the Captain’s spiel before he could continue on. “We finished them last week.” He exchanged a weary glance with Ron, who was subtly holding onto their dilapidated bookshelf to keep himself standing upright.
“We have to know for sure that’s Potter before we can torture the boy,” Narcissa said, arranging herself on one of the burgundy armchairs tastefully situated just-so. They seemed to be in a drawing room of some sort; the ceilings were high, arched with a crisp particularity that made the space seem cold and unforgiving. Paintings of grizzled ancestors were the only decorations adorning the walls. For all the surrounding splendor, it seemed to be a very impersonal room indeed.
“Thanks, Potter,” Draco mustered up as they walked back.

He spun on the spot to Apparate to Northpass, and then remembered that under Future Promise #15, he had to give the Ministry at least 30 minutes’ notification before Apparating, and could only Floo to pre-approved destinations. At least he’d had the sense to file all the necessary paperwork as to Floo to every grate he could think of, and only been denied for two of them. But how exactly was he supposed to notify the Ministry about Apparation if he could no longer contact them? His headache worsened.
MARCH 2002
Confusion must still show on his face, because Malfoy says, “Hmm, I’m doing a rather poor job of explaining this. Alright, think of the concept of virginity. We always talk about ‘losing’ our virginity the first time we have sex – though sex can be defined in several different ways, but I digress – like it’s something that can be taken or given at will. Instead, it’s a conceptualization. We use it to define worth but in reality, your identity stays the same whether or not you’re a virgin. You’re still you, Potter. You feel like something is lost, but truthfully, you’re as whole as you ever were.”
“See that you do,” Weasley said, crossing his arms. “I won’t tell him you were here.”
“Hey, look!” shouted one Ravenclaw boy with a particularly lowbrow accent. “Malfoy’s pissed himself!”
relationship; we’ve danced around each other for years. Our spark had always been there, but was never able to actualize into a relationship until we were on the same side.”
Father met Draco’s eyes with malice. No longer willing to wait for permission, Draco turned on his heel and purposefully strode from the room, doing his best not to storm.
Thoughtful, Draco considered. Longbottom could be making a good point. After all, a broken clock was right twice a day. He forced himself to stop thinking and just do.
“Just ran into Malfoy on my trip out,” Harry recounts. “He wanted to come over and make amends.”
What was wrong with him? Malfoys simply did not worry about what others thought about them; even tentatively ridiculous love interests who most definitely did not return said interest.
“Ah, yes,” ‘Dromeda smiled, “It’s coming back to me now. Cissy said you would probably mention it sooner or later. She knows how skeptical you are of everything.”
Shrugging, Harry holds out his hand and takes the flask. The liquid is clear and cool, but comes with the side effect of a numbing feeling traveling through his body.
?” Weasley said, after a moment.
“Look, are you going to help me or not? This is the first day I’ve been motivated enough to think of life after graduation.”
The shortstop’s behavior was getting really old, in Draco’s opinion. He gave Zee his trademark superior Malfoy glare, wishing Pansy was around to help him take the piss out of that angsty twit. God forbid he ask the Golden Boy to stoop so low as to make fun of someone, though Draco knew from his days at Hogwarts that Potter could come up with his fair share of retorts. He also had a wicked sense of humor, judging by the way he’d helped Betty Lou take Zee down a couple notches for complaining about coaching softball.
“Master Draco?” asked Ceeley tentatively, poking her head in the bathroom door.
“Hermione must feel like she needs him.” Ron shook his head. “I mean, we haven’t been around and she’s probably lonely.”
He opened the one from Australia first, informing Hermione of her acceptance upon unfolding the parchment. She nodded briskly—like him, her top school was in France. Hermione was also accepted into two schools in Brazil, and one in the Caribbean.
“Hello, ‘Mione. Ron’s not here yet,” Harry smiled, picking up on Hermione’s anxiety. “He wanted to let Draco adjust a little bit before coming over.”
One of his absolute favorite parts of the muggle world was the limitless possibilities to the fashion, not to mention the utter randomness of what people actually wore. Draco would see the absolute strangest things while walking on campus – it almost seemed as though certain things were more acceptable there than anywhere else. For example, he didn’t usually see girls wearing shorts that exposed the bottom part of their bum cheeks to the grocery store or downtown. He supposed that the stares didn’t warrant their need for expression (Draco had witnessed more than one incident of creepy old men harassing young women and fought to restrain himself from pulling out his wand and hexing the buggers).
Since the Lodge was nearby, Draco decided to stop by for a proper cup of coffee and maybe even a little snack. They surely had biscuits or crumpets around; he knew enough about camp to realize that the other employees weren’t completely uncivilized. And the best part was that Macmillan’s group was going for a quick tour of the Tall Timbers living unit and they most likely wouldn’t even realize he was gone. Draco had actually already
“Oh, but it did,” the man says smoothly. Already crowding Harry against the wall, he moves even closer to prevent Harry from continuing to struggle.
The rest of the afternoon crept by. Predictably, Draco was interrogated by Father, but he was too wound up from his encounter with Potter earlier and the thought of what he was going to do that evening to really pay much attention to the threats. He spent the day drinking tea and walking the Manor grounds, debating whether or not he wanted to pass on or remain behind as a ghost. The countryside was beautiful this time of year and it tempted him sorely.
“I’m over here,” Draco replied, and Harry walked into the kitchen to see Draco sitting with Mrs. Weasley at the kitchen table, indulging in chocolate cake.
Flushed and embarrassed, Draco was more than relieved when the archery director herded both groups of campers on the picnic benches and started lecturing about the rules for archery.
They continued down the ingredient list, Draco stopping Granger from adding one too many mistletoe berries and Granger stopping Draco from adding an unnecessary counter-clockwise stir after every seventh clockwise. “That makes it too viscous,” she explained quickly.
“Pub night?”
He led Draco out to the counter before disappearing in the back again, and the clerk gave Draco a handout on aftercare and a bag of sea salt before explaining cleaning procedures. Draco paid, tipped, and left. It hadn’t taken more than twenty minutes overall.
This day could
Harry laughed. “They’ll come around. The whole summer would be such a blast, honestly. I haven’t done any traveling in America yet, and California is supposed to be beautiful.”
me? I know you want something, or you wouldn’t be here. Want to ask me to testify at your trial? Fine. I’ll even throw your mother’s in for good measure. Now leave me alone.”
, and Draco felt simultaneously relieved and disappointed. Hell if he hadn’t wanted to see Potter, who had the annoying habit of making Draco feel better. But there was going to be no more Potter either, he reminded himself. Potter belonged at Hogwarts, and he was going to be transferring schools, preferably attending Ilvermorny. Draco spent a moment mourning, yet again, for not being able to make things work with Potter.

And for that reason it was better to stay in this liminal state of not-quite-friends and not-quite-lovers, because at least Draco could

No matter. He’s not planning to go back to actually

“What have you got there, Abby?” Draco murmured, petting his owl’s head. She’d been a graduation gift from Hermione, a surprisingly sweet and mild-tempered pet.
“Yeah, I know, right?”
“Draco!” called Potter’s enthusiastic voice. “Draco, dammit, where are you?”
Draco gave him a withering glare before jogging over to shortstop and getting into ready position. He absolutely didn’t want to let the team down to the point where they started wishing Zee was back on the team.
Draco could not accompany his mother, even if he wanted to. It wasn’t because ‘Dromeda believed he was evil, but because of Future Promise Proclamation #65: “Those formerly affiliated with You-Know-Who shall not, under any circumstances, be allowed to share a residence with minors under the legal age, unless the child in question is their biological son or daughter.”
Under his breath, Malfoy mutters a vague insult. “Weasley. I would tell you, but I’m not about to violate Potter’s trust again tonight. Go in there and give him what he wants and what you think he needs.” With that, he meets Ron’s eyes and gives a significant nod before Disapparating with a sharp
The tension was broken, and most of the team laughed. José, Chris, and Zee still looked concerned, but others, like Harry and Cale, were visibly excited.
“I completely agreed with you on the quality of the questions,” Draco said, handing the list to Harry. He quickly read through them, noting how neat and precise Draco’s cursive was, and was interested to note that none of their questions overlapped.
It was over. The war that had claimed so much of Harry’s life, passion, and energy was over. He almost didn’t know how to feel. Before he could do anything, however, there were certain things that needed tended to. Harry left the Great Hall, ignoring everyone who tried to hug him, praise him, or tearfully thank him. Ron and Hermione looked at him questioningly, but he declined them with a slight shake of his head. They understood immediately this was something he would have to do alone.  Harry dodged Nearly Headless Nick, who, for the first time, wasn’t upset when his wobbly head fell off his shoulders, and finally made it into the Entrance Hall. He’d already repaired his holly and phoenix feather wand but still clutched the Elder Wand tightly. It was time to start putting the past behind him.
Harry hesitated. Tomorrow was supposed to be his third mystery outing with Malfoy. But after their falling-out tonight, he doubted that Malfoy was still planning anything.
“Should we really do it?” asked one of the boys, a short and stocky redhead. Draco thought about how he’d teased that one, in his own fifth year, from all the way across the Great Hall for eating an extra piece of treacle tart. This was not going to end well.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“Of course I am,” replied Draco. “Now go make me pancakes.”
On impulse, Harry rested one hand on Malfoy's shoulder, the other still caressing his hair. Surprisingly, Malfoy reached across and joined his hand with Harry's. There was another long silence where neither wanted to move away.
“You’re a good friend, Draco.”
Afterwards, Nate gathered up his team with a proud face and a tear in his eye, and proclaimed, “I think we’re even stronger than we were last year. Not counting chickens or anything, but we might have a chance at first place…” he seemed overcome with emotion, heavily reminding Harry of Oliver Wood.
—pushing him out of the top spot in their class. But then again, he had been kind of tetchy lately. Even Hermione had been telling him it was good to take breaks (the hypocrite, seeing as
Auror training had begun the summer after graduation with the delivery of a massive amount of manuals and paperwork to Grimmauld Place. There had been a note from John Dawlish, the current Head Auror, instructing him to study all the reading material inside and out. Apparently, there would be a test at the end of the summer.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
Nobody was speaking. Draco waited a minute to see if anyone was going to, but found himself desperately wanting to throw the ball again. He assumed the position, repeated the motions, and focused harder this time.
“Draco,” Potter said suddenly, taking his head off of his knees. He seemed like he was gearing up for a long explanation. Draco didn’t have the patience for it.
The couch was warm, soft, and welcomed Hermione with open arms. Before she knew it, sleep came calling, and she found herself drifting into blissful nothingness. It was a good fifteen minutes before she opened her eyes again, startled out of her slumber. The first thing she registered, heart pounding, was that the shower was still running. There didn’t seem to be any visitors, and she hadn’t heard the doorbell. Slightly more relaxed, Hermione settled back into the sofa, cozying back up under one of Draco’s more lavishly crocheted afghans. Damn if her tea wasn’t already cold. But lukewarm tea was still good, especially with rum. So were the stale biscuits that Draco had set out earlier that morning and already forgotten about. Before she knew it, Hermione’s cup was empty and she was feeling more than a little comfortable.
“Really?” Harry managed to ask, skeptical despite his horniness.
“Like I really care. Potter, your hygiene is questionable at the best of times.”
Instead, Draco was drawn to the back wall of the shop, where several displays of somber flowers had been arranged. He walked right up to a stark arrangement of white lilies and roses. Leaning forward, Draco cupped the bottom of one of the lilies and deeply inhaled the sweet, fragrant scent. Immediately, in that one moment, he was all the funerals he’s ever attended, breathing in the aromatic smell that comes after a death.
Cale and Chris laughed.
“Does it count if that person is gay?” Draco asked, smirking.
Out of the blue, Potter asked, “Do you think we’re actually starting to become friends?”
To his surprise, everything outside was completely silent. They seemed to have run out of steam, the lot of them, and they were simply sprawled out across the lawn watching the stars come out. Ginny had noticed the back door open and gestured for Draco to come over. He sat in between her and George, using an extra Weasley sweater as a pillow. Other than to occasionally note a specific constellation or even a shooting star, the Weasleys stayed quiet, and Draco was strangely appreciative.
He knew something was off when Draco only managed a half-hearted chuckle. They sat in silence for a moment, digesting the content of the article. “What do you think?” Harry asked finally, unable to bear it any longer. He stood up from off of the couch and walked into the kitchen, where Draco was using his elbows to lean on the kitchen counter, still staring at the issue. Wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist, Harry gently nuzzled into the back of Draco’s neck.
“You’re a wanker,” he hissed under his breath before striding over to the girls and summoning all of the infielders to follow him out onto the field. Potter claimed the outfielders, directed the pitcher and catcher out to the grass behind the dugout, and obnoxiously strutted down the third baseline, Draco watching him the whole way. Damn Potter and his childish, attractive antics.
When they arrived, Draco made to go sit underneath the shady tree that provided him the only bit of solace he’d have all day, but Potter pulled him inside the building. It was just as hot, if not hotter, in here as it was outside, and it was also filled with other counselors that Draco absolutely did not want to see. Even if without tear tracks running down his face, he usually kept to himself.
Draco didn’t even care she was seeing him naked, because so help him, he needed the shower to work
“Listen,” Potter said. “We’re due for a night off, yeah? That was Cale on the phone. He and Chris are insisting on pub night.”
Draco took a chance and slid his arm around Potter’s shoulders. A quick second later, Potter rested his head in the crook of Draco’s neck. He was instantly aware of Potter’s warm skin and soft hair.
“Come on, Malfoy, or you’re going to take a ball to the head,” exaggerated Harry impatiently. Just then, Cale caught his eye and raised an eyebrow suggestively, and it’s all he can do not to burst into hysterics. That would be something else, his balls near Malfoy’s head…

“What are they this time, our permission forms,
He gets his wish. The next set of performers is five men dressed in scandalous trench coats. They saunter on stage, grinning out at the audience, only to proceed back down the stairs and stride between the guest tables provocatively. The music starts, the lights dim, and spotlights shine on each performer. Harry watches appreciatively as the men mix in some hip dance moves with their more erotic motions.
“Seriously, why do you feel this way about me?”
“Not to me," said Potter, ever stubborn. "But if you feel so strongly about it...Would you be so kind as to serve me up a proper cup of
“That’s right I am,” Hermione said grimly, leaving the bathroom. Her honeybush tea was calling her. She and Draco often drank wine together, but he didn’t know about her secret stash of rum hidden behind the cheapest, most repugnant bottle of White Zinfandel that they had somehow—and to be quite frank, Hermione didn’t quite know how—accumulated. Unscrewing the bottle, Hermione took a swig before pouring a little bit of rum into her tea to take the edge off of this long day (it was only half-noon). For good measure, before putting the bottle away she took another sip. Hermione had promised herself that Ron, even with the utter
“Quite ready,” Draco replied. “Half the beetle’s eyes first, I’d say?” Their book called for all of the beetle’s eyes to be added, but there was a practical reason why Draco chose to hold off on the second half.
Dryly, Narcissa said, “But haven’t you already lost everything that matters to you? Your reputation is ruined, and except for me, those who believed in you are dead or gone. Our family has fallen apart…” She faltered.
“Buckle up, Ron,” Hermione ordered, rotating around to look out the rear view window. Harry didn’t know why she bothered; there was nothing but scrubby, wilted grass to hit.
“Make me,” said Potter in his typical insolent fashion, stealing another kiss before Draco could say another word.
To his relief, when Draco came into their bedroom, the first thing he did was pull up Harry’s covers and kiss him on the lips, all the while smoothing back his hair, stroking his fingers gently through the thick locks. It was irrational, but Harry’d been concerned Draco would love him less as his enthusiasm for his work grew.
Hermione did her best to keep the crossness out of her tone. He just
“Shut up,” laughed Draco, shoving Harry. They reached the door to their office – the largest and by far the nicest one in the department, aside from the Head Auror’s – and went in, slamming the door behind them.
“Wh-what?—"
Harry glared at him; obviously, even if the coffee shop wasn’t open, what was to stop them from letting themselves in and making a quick cuppa?
Harry sighed. “Partially because I wanted a new challenge. But I completely didn’t realize how tough it would be to live where you work.”
“Yes. It’s absolutely gorgeous out here when they’re blooming.”
He couldn’t breathe. He’d always expected making love to Malfoy to be an experience in of itself, but never had Harry expected their sex to be just so
“Break it up!” Nate shouted furiously, unclenching Potter’s fingers from Zee. Potter made another desperate swoop for Zee, but Nate blocked his path and shouted for him to back off.
“Potter?” ventured a soft voice.
? What he did during the war?”
His impassioned speech seemed to have no impact on Draco, who was shaking his head. “We’ve come so far, Malfoy. I can’t lose you over this, and I won’t.”
“Let’s not talk think about that yet. So. What order are we opening these in?”
After a minute, Draco looked back at Jake and saw him wearing a look of smug satisfaction, probably because he had pleased Draco so well. Inwardly, he frowned. That simply wouldn’t do. Jake still hadn’t come yet, and Draco knew it would be selfish to quite literally stiff him, so he obliged Jake as he leaned forward again and put both hands on Draco’s cheeks to kiss him intimately. After a good thirty seconds of this, Draco started to fervently wish that Jake would just come already, and so he grabbed Jake around the back again and started moving their bodies together roughly once more.

To his very surprise, he landed in the foyer of a
Steve was dumbfounded. The normally insipid Draco was most often found studying or reading; even surfing the internet (which he had started to become fonder of as his classes forced him to rely increasingly on his laptop). The one thing he did not do was reveal his temper or even demonstrate any other extreme emotions.
“–-Harry, I think I’ve lost my dream-–”
“Rules are more like flexible guidelines,” said Malfoy dismissively. “We went through Knockturn Alley, which I know you’ve been to before, and you’ve also been in plenty of caves. I say that it counts.”
It was cold and dreary, but he summoned up the fortitude to go out there anyway, bundled up in a coarse black coat buttoned all the way up to his throat. The lavender plants, so bountiful and productive in the summer, were faded and discolored in the winter, receding to the smallest amount of space they could possibly occupy. They were like a living metaphor for his heart, Draco thought miserably as he walked down the neat rows cast by the undergrowth.
before the war. He opened his mouth to deliver a clever remark that would leave his former rival reeling, but before he got the chance, there was an outburst behind him as someone disbelievingly sputtered his name.
“He’s comfortable; or rather, he can’t be uncomfortable because we gave him Dreamless Sleep,” Hermione squeaks. “We just want to make sure we’re not making it worse, whatever it is. See, Harry usually tells us everything. It’s strange to try and help him when he’s acting so strangely and keeps insisting there’s nothing wrong.”
“Actually, no, I wasn’t going to turn you down.”
“He wasn’t the one,” Harry answers wearily. “But he set it up so I was. And he did something inappropriate when we were dancing that I wasn’t comfortable with.”
“Honestly,” said Harry, “I didn’t get a chance to ask her. I just kind of told her there was a present for her in my bag and then left her with it.”
He’s suddenly exhausted as he opens his front door and doesn’t have it in him to trudge up to the second floor and get into his bead. Instead, he opts for crashing on the couch, snatching one of Mrs. Weasley’s crocheted afghans to cover up with. He sleeps peacefully, content from his minimal interaction with the homeless man. When he wakes again it’s 10am, and he’s thankful to have gotten more rest, because he has the niggling feeling that, for a while, it’s going to be hard for him to sleep easy. There’s a knocking at the window, and he practically jumps out of his skin with the anticipation that it’s Asten coming back for him. Summoning courage, he looks for the source of the noise, and is relieved to see it’s just an owl. He walks to the window and lets the owl in. It’s snowy white and reminds him of Hedwig. Before a lump can form in his throat, he takes the scroll and quickly reads it.
Draco had never been so happy to have someone buffering his social interaction with people he’d once have entrusted not his life, but some very valuable material possessions to.
Draco’s gray eyes flashed angrily. They weren’t going to turn his water back on because it was
“That sounds like a very reasonable deadline,” Hermione agreed. “Merlin, I wonder how we’ll get everything done, especially with Slughorn giving us extra projects now…”
“I want you,” Draco breathed into his ear. He lowered himself slowly, snatching the pillow and placing it behind his head before spreading his legs wide and pulling Harry between them.
Pushed past his breaking point, Draco stepped into the shower anyway, still garbed in his bathrobe. He found that he could at least pull it away from his skin enough to soap up and rinse off, and he did just that. Though the shower was far from what he’d envisioned, Draco tried to keep his composure intact even as he realized that he was drowning in bureaucracy. He stayed in the shower for far too long.
nice house. The inside décor was overwhelmingly decorated according to his taste, and Draco had to marvel with how perfectly it seemed to represent him with a good dose of Harry’s more quaint and charming tendencies thrown in.
“Thank Merlin that’s over with,” Harry breathed as they finally shut the door behind Blaise and Pansy.
say yes, Draco, don’t give me that look—so what then? Is he going to stay with us? How long is he going to stay?”
Potter was right. The water cascading down his body felt heavenly, washing away the hurts and toils of the day. He stayed under the stream for a half an hour, using the time to reflect on the day, and especially on Potter’s kindness. Draco didn’t quite know what to do with it.
Ron laughed. “I’m sure you can think of about eighty separate occasions where he has been, right mate?”
Harry had to force himself not to jump down Malfoy’s throat. “What did I say before that made you the most upset?”
Harry was about to turn on the spot and disappear, but then remembered he still didn’t know where he was going. Malfoy looked at him with the typical smirk Harry had come to expect whenever he was about to be teased.
Both journals were published quarterly, so they each had four issues to browse from the current year. Draco didn’t particularly like the idea of reading back any further, especially considering that each issue was over 200 pages.
“Oh God, tell me you weren’t staring at Seamus’s dick!” gasps Ron, running a hand through his hair and mussing it.
“Makes sense,” shrugged Maisie.
“Are you sure you want this?” Harry asked. He ran his hands over Draco’s thighs and hips. “I’d never ask you before you were ready.”
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
“The way I see it, Granger,” said Draco honestly, “It just doesn’t add up. You’re intelligent, curious, caring, and open minded, while he’s--erm, not those things,” he said, quickly backtracking at the look on Hermione’s face.
They’d been broken up for a long time now, but Hermione still couldn’t shake the urge to make gestures that would please Ron. She had to remind herself that no, the sheets in the bedroom weren’t being changed because she was planning to sleep with Ron, even though she was a grown-arse woman who could have sex with no strings attached, thank you very much. It wasn’t a good idea to sleep with Ron. The sex had been fantastic, but Ron had been a complete and utter douchebag when it came to what Hermione wanted or needed. He’d also initially refused to accept Draco or to respect Harry’s choices. She hadn’t forgotten. He didn’t deserve her body, even if she was attracted to him.
“Surely I don't have to explain the logistics, do I?” sniped Draco, trying to cover up his own nervousness.
“Great,” said Potter, a brilliant smile lighting up his face. “Let’s just drop this stuff off and get some water before we go.”
“Let’s get more food,” Potter groaned when they were packed up and ready to head out. “I’ll see you guys at home,” he called to Chris and Cale, apparently not wanting them to tag along. Draco wondered at his behavior.
“Come on, let’s dance!” Seamus wheedles, holding out a hand for Harry to grab. He complies, and Seamus drags him out to the dance floor where some electronica version of a Celestina Warbeck song is playing.

“Don’t,” Harry laughed. “I can’t tell you how much I’ve honestly missed you,” he said, hugging her close to him again. She laughed and patted him before pulling away again, a look of hesitation on her face.
“Shit,” José said suddenly. “He’s going to do something stupid.”
He completely surrendered himself as Draco dipped a finger into the lube and stirred it, muttering a quick Warming Charm to make sure it was comfortable for Harry. Draco positioned them both on their sides and kissed Harry again, shifting Harry’s leg up as he reached between his legs and nudged at his opening. Arousal shot through him as Draco traced circles there, gently poking his finger in as Harry softly moaned into his mouth.
MAY 2000
“We’ll put that one on my ‘decline’ list,” Hermione said. “I’m not going somewhere that rejected you.”
“I love you too,” Harry said. “And I’m sure you planned it to happen this way, right, Draco?” he added teasingly.
“Well thank you very much,” said Draco, rolling his eyes. He chose to let it go. Snuggling with Potter would be a fine way to put an end to this morning and there was no need to ruin the easy camaraderie between them.
Draco sniffed. Put down his books?! Then he might risk that annoyingly brunette—
Still dizzy, still trembling with nerves, Hermione went to answer the door. She told herself that there was no need to look through the peephole, because she already knew who was there, and with that thought in mind, she pasted a smile on her face and wrenched open the door.
“Pass is over here, then.”
They stayed in that position as the cameraman snapped another thousand shots, only breaking away when Luna went to examine photos. “That’s
The quill felt heavy in Draco’s hand. Their flat was cold too, and he still hadn't figured out how to make Warming Charms last longer. He could ask Harry, but somehow, it seemed dishonest to write about trivial, unimportant things with a literal war going on inside of him. Once again, Draco didn't write back, though the guilt tore him up inside.
Of course, basking in Draco’s discomfort, they voted him the lucky first to spin. Grimacing, he did, and it landed on a dude. Amidst squeals and laughter, he shrugged his shoulders, and reached out to spin again. Hands came out of nowhere to stop him as some of the drunker girls shouted, “What’re you doing? Kiss him already!”
“Are you a witch or not?” Harry shouted back, sneaking one last kiss before pulling Draco out of his afghan-cocoon and into the kitchen.
Draco stood on the pitching rubber, watching apprehensively as Nels put on her head mask and crouched down behind home plate. This wasn’t the place for him. He was way too close to the batter, for one thing, which meant his reaction times were going to have to be a lot faster than they were when he was playing outfield or even middle infield. Also, how in the bloody fuck was he supposed to pitch? Potter had covered pitching positioning in their sessions, but not actually
Draco avoided Azkaban, fulfilling his sentence by paying a hefty fine and doing a year’s worth of community service, but was regarded with derision and contempt regardless of his fantastic NEWT scores. He had accepted the offer to return to Hogwarts and finish out his education, studying harder than ever before. However, his opportunities were limited because of the laws and he even found it increasingly difficult to go out in public.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
Potter smiles. “Like this?” he asks, directing his cock right where Draco wants it.
“I appreciate that Professor,” Harry said. “But we can’t live here any longer. Draco's not safe here, despite your good intentions."
The path in front of him winded, twisted, curved; he couldn’t see where it led or where it ended. Yet Draco plodded on, stumbling up inclines and through the underbrush that had grown over the trail. He kept his head down and his breathing even, moving even as anxiety crept through his chest and winded him. The answer would come to him eventually; it always did. But perhaps he was meant to suffer in the meantime. Resigning himself to it, Draco tried his best to tune the thoughts out, focusing only on the sound of his own footsteps and the reflective light of the moon.
“Whatever you say, Malfoy,” returned Potter, touching his head softly to Draco’s in order to stare up at the stars. Draco followed his lead and as the two lay there together, a shooting star suddenly streaked across the sky.
“How can you think about eating at a time like this?! Our futures are in these envelopes, Draco!”
“Ron!” Harry exclaims, yanking his shirt down to cover his erection. “What the fuck?”
“Being with the American Aurors feels more
“Master Draco! Master Draco sir!”
For a fraction of a second, Harry feared for his life, well-aware Draco’s weight was still pinning him to the ground. “Um,” he gasped, trying to formulate a coherent sentence, “Er –”
Still breathing faster than normal, Dawlish said, “It’s not always about getting the bad guy immediately.
The lulling of the car nearly rocks me to sleep, and we’re there all too soon, backing into a parking space.
Harry stepped into the box and set out like he was going to hit normally. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the evil third baseman take a step up, and vowed to try and push the bunt down the first base side. The pitcher wound up, and just as he was about to release the ball Harry got into his bunting position and tried desperately to judge the location of the ball as it came in. Too high. He pulled back just in time to avoid the umpire calling a strike on him. Damn; that kind of blew the plan. He looked down at Nate again to see the same signal: bunt.
Real Potter looked down at him, flushed again and also panting, but seemed to muster up some resolve as he leaned down and kissed Draco softly on the lips. It was a chaste kiss, but Draco enjoyed it thoroughly, pleased that Potter hadn’t done anything stupid like cringe or lean back in revulsion.
Instead, the ball whooshed over the rectangle-triangle and was caught by the woman wearing a lot of gear in a giant leathery hand.
“Ha,” said Harry. “As if we'll have time for dinner. But I'll tell you what,” he conceded, relenting because Malfoy looked truly demoralized. “If you can be on time for the rest of the week, we’ll bugger off early on Friday and get some lunch.”
“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Harry asked, setting down his forkful of sausage.
“So what is it?” interrogated Macmillan, refusing to be deterred. Draco scowled. He was no closer to coming up with a name than he was before, but anything had to be better than
“Neither did you,” said Draco crossly. “How does this have anything to do with my predicament?”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“What did your letter say? Was it an outright rejection?” Harry asked, taking the cloth from Draco before he gave himself rug burns from scrubbing too hard.
“Let’s skip to the interview, then,” Harry said eagerly. “Look, it even promises more pictures…”
The ground is cool and welcoming, and he willingly sinks down into the darkness.
“Ron, what exactly did Malfoy say when he talked to you earlier today?”
“Yes. If justice isn’t appropriately served, then you’re more than welcome to help me hex and curse them to our hearts’ content,” Harry says firmly.
It worked. Draco moaned and pushed back, trying to find Harry’s finger again.
He continued.
Not for the first time, Steve had to wonder where exactly in God’s name Draco was from that he didn’t know about simple things like online shopping and using credit cards. “Did you drop off the face of Mars?” he uttered under his breath. Draco caught most of it, crossing his arms and narrowing his eyes. “Didn’t we go over this on day one? I came from an antiquated well-to-do village in England. Where we didn’t have cars, or credit cards, or the internet–”
After two solid hours of reading and thinking, Draco concluded that Enigma was his best bet. The muggles who’d gone there before said it was expensive, but that the piercers were top notch, the place was clean, and the jewelry was high quality. Expensive wasn’t a problem for Draco and he also especially liked that Enigma only did piercings, instead of both piercings and tattoos like all the other places he’d looked at.
“No problem, Malfoy. You learn really fast,” Potter remarked. “Er, are you quite ready to head back then?”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“Sorry,” he muttered, “But I figured I’d bring it up, at least—”
He ran back over to the fence and tossed Draco the ball. It was low, so he opened the mitt and cupped it like Potter had shown him, delighted when the ball landed right in it. Unfortunately, it popped out a second later.
Harry meets Hermione down by the lake; Draco and Harry come to an understanding.
José, also finished putting his gear away, howled. He accepted the number 5 Nate thrust at him and retreated down the path towards the parking lot, shaking his head.
“Let’s go,” Ron said. “You know that Schrader’s going to pull some shit where he tries to ‘check in’ one last time after hours. Unless we leave in the next two minutes, we’re gonna have to use the cloak.”
“Have you thought about how he’s feeling right now? I’m sure that he—”
Naturally, they had just reached the part where Draco had to sing, “A hula hula hu,” and make hula motions with his hips when the two groups joined and became one. Even as Potter’s campers eagerly echoed the song, joining in, back, Draco could see Potter smirking (even though he tactfully turned his head).
“I expect premium tea for life in exchange for my love,” Hermione said weakly, pulling away to wipe her eyes as Draco continued preparing their drinks, filling tea strainers with the loose-leaf Queen Victoria.
They sat quietly for the rest of the ride there. Harry didn’t move his arm from Malfoy’s shoulders, and, surprisingly, Malfoy didn’t ease out from under him. He was even so daring as to grab Malfoy’s hand and escort him into the bar.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“This has been wonderful, Malfoy,” gushed Hermione, “But Arithmancy starts in ten minutes, and I promised Professor Vector I’d help lead a review session about one of the concepts.”
He moved his head a fraction of an inch away from Malfoy’s mouth and thought it might be safe to make eye contact again. Malfoy’s eyes were concentrated in thought and emotion; Harry could only guess at what he was thinking and feeling.
“Well, I don’t really live anywhere,” said Potter thoughtfully. “I’ve stayed there as long as I have because of baseball. I really like the team. Almost feels like being at home again.”
Hermione loved Draco to death, but was ultimately
. I really like you, and I think we could have a real shot.”
Groggily, he came back to consciousness in his own body in Malfoy Manor, where he had lain on the bed previously that evening and waited to die. There were no words for the overwhelming sense of shame that completely encased Draco as he thought about the life he might have missed out on living. But the closure he’d reached with Harry allowed him to begin forgiving himself for trying to take the actions he did.

Outside, it was a windy, chill evening. Draco busily worked away at crocheting a midnight blue sweater. It was the first item of clothing that he’d attempted, save for hats and scarves, and he was fortunately making better progress with it than he was with his life. He listened to the wireless while he worked but couldn’t shake the feeling of unease inside him. Finally, Draco had enough of his inaction. He threw down the sweater and crossed over to the fireplace, reaching his hand into the pot of Floo Powder.
Hermione and Draco discuss their futures; the Quibbler exclusive is released.

“All that fancy dancing has made you soft,” spits Asten.
He swallowed a tinge of guilt, and waved his wand to Summon an owl from the Ministry’s Courtesy Owl Service to deliver his letter to the Burrow. He’d deliberately left off from telling them where he was going to go, being unsure about that himself.
“So,” Ron says, oh-so-casually. “When’s Malfoy’s first lesson going to be?”
“Bloody hell, Granger!” exclaimed Draco, voice echoing through the dark chambers of the library. “Are you daft? No, I bloody well wouldn’t describe it as
Hermione shares some big news and Draco realizes that change is inevitable.
Draco Disapparated them then, and Harry felt a tinge of excitement in his stomach as they went through the usual (horrible) process of Apparation. The landing made him dizzy, but Draco’s strong, lean presence next to Harry was more than enough to steady him.
“We’ll make it through this, I know it,” she said, drawing him into a hug. It wasn’t in her nature to give up easily.
, not by a long shot, but there were the slightest traces of laugh lines in his face and around his eyes. It was amusing to think that he smiled and laughed enough to even have these lines.
“Er, I dunno,” he responded, picking at a thread on his sweater. “What do you think?”
Before he went home, Draco stopped at a tea shop. He chose a flavor other than English Breakfast and immediately regretted it. It was such a small thing, but he couldn’t shake the feeling of wishing he could go back and choose again, even as he steadily worked away on his Potions formula. Every sip reinforced that feeling, especially as he tried repeatedly to let it go but couldn’t.
“I still can’t shake the feeling I shouldn’t have dumped him,” Hermione said miserably. “What if I never fall in love again and spend the rest of my life alone?”
She leaned in, gently, slowly, and planted a chaste kiss on his lips. It was over in less than a second and gave Draco the impression he was kissing his sister, should he have had one. “Like that.”
“What happened?” asked Nate and Harry simultaneously, Nate collecting the discarded handouts and placing them carefully back in his folder.
