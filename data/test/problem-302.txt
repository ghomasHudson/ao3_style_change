Nodding to Hermione as thanks for understanding and eventually returning his gaze at me, he gestured me with an urging nod to take a bite at the meat which was put on the top of my bread. Gulping, I, courageously, took a bite.
From the previous chapter:
"Yeah! Even Ginny and the other girls are conscious about it. They have giggled around you. Didn't you notice?" He asked, amused by my reaction.
I run as fast as I can to the lavatory, reaching the sink. I vomited violently, emptying my already empty stomach.
"Potter." He spoke as a greeting. "What brought you here so early morning when we don't have any classes? Shouldn't you be goofing around or lazing in the bed like a pig?"
"Shit," I said, my voice was still harsh from snarling and crying.
“Oh, Harry but it is true!” she whispered. “It’s all true”
'Why won't you take a peek under that cloth?' She whispered at my ear.
Oh, God. Kill me now.
Ginny shyly lowered her gaze, making a fluttering effect with her eyelids. That sight made me hungry in a different way. I turn my gaze away from her, as I search for the pumpkin juice to water down the dryness of my throat. My cheeks are heated, I know that I am blushing so much that even Hermione giggled.
It was raining as I sat beside the window near my bed. I was inside our dormitory room as I ponder about the morning discussion with the Headmaster. I remember the whole morning as we - me, Hermione, and Ron sat in front of the Headmaster, after Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall and Malfoy left. I sat there as I started to tell him about our unfortunate encounter with the Gulon and the nightmares I am having except I didn't mention my demon.
Oddly, Draco stood firmly with a blank face, that I never saw on him. This was not the reaction I would get from him if it was the usual.
Her eyes searched within my eyes, she understood as she slowly nodded. She knows that I will tell her when there are no people around us. In private. With relief, I brought back my attention to the lecture as the burden in my heart lighten.
06. GOLDEN TRIO
I run with no direction in mind.
“I-.” I started as my voice crack and my heart galloped a mile away. I cleared my throat as I felt the warm blush crept over my cheeks. “Mione and I already tested it out”
"I agree with that." Hermione nodded. "You need help on this one, Harry. This is serious."
"Mr. Malfoy!" Professor McGonagall warned grimly.
A lesson to keep.
"Shut up, Granger." He said then brought the knife to his left hand and slice across. The blood from his hand was dripping fast and as its scent hits me, I started to struggle more. But the lad didn't panic or flinch away from me instead he walked slowly towards me. A very unusual sight that had made me stunned as I cease from moving and fighting my ropes. And upon reaching me, unexpectedly, he raised his wounded hand and place it on my lips.
"I would feel better if my girlfriend gives me some encouragement." I smiled as I tease her.
"Bastard! That's not want I did last night." I retorted as the heat swept into my cheeks as he suggested those things.
“Here, try it out.” He said after giving it to me.
Hermione raised one of his eyebrows and I can see her lips quivering, trying hard not to laugh at me as she can't because we are right now in class. To be exact, Herbology class. She and I were partnered at the start of class, leaving Ron with Neville, who was quite good at Herbology. So, Ron won't be bothering us for help since he has a reliable partner.
Like a deer caught in the middle of the road, we both straighten up and said. "Nothing!"
"What's wrong, Mom?" Fred asked as he straightens up from his chair. The usual sleepy atmosphere was gone in a second.
"Tell me, Granger. What is Morgan's name that did happen to Potter to make him...like this? Or do I have to pry it out of you? Because seriously, I really could use a bit of information and a reason, on why should I let Potter here live." He continued as he tried to encircled around Harry with a knowing look in his eyes.
"Your complexion is better than in the past two days. You don't look like you're going to fall off anytime. You're in a good mood compared to you being grouchy all the time." She continues as she listed all the things that she had observed. " Better, even you still not eating that much."
Should I shift course before its too late - before I got smolder by annoyance?
"Draco and I had an idea that might help you in reducing your craving if we feed you magical creature's flesh and scheduled you to have a bit of human blood from us." She spoke slowly. " For the cure, well...we still don't anything as for now but we will eventually find it!
"Yes. Thank you, Draco." I repeated as I smile at him.
Even though my situation is very dire, I was able to laugh at Hermione. Then Hermione joined me in laughing our worries away.
I know I was going crazy by shouting here all by myself but I couldn't take it anymore. I need to let it all out. To ask. Because I know I will breakdown anytime if I will not know what is really happening to me.
"They have realized that it was not your fault, Harry. Finally!" He sarcastically rolled his eyes. "That, your transformation might be trigger from according to Dumbeldore's words 'by a certain accident' and he would like to help you. He is also willing to take you back to Hogwarts with Hermione to continue your studies as they will clear everything to the school and the public of what really happens. He also said that he informed your two guardians and a message was sent to them to return as soon they received the note."
Glaring heavily at Malfoy, Michael asked with bared teeth. "What do you mean, Malfoy?"
"No, I mean. Instead of being at Hogwarts, why are you here in the forest?" I sighed and politely asked. "Not that I am not grateful for you being here with us, it is just-"
The choking feeling in my throat and stabbing pain in my chest slowly disappear as I saw clearly in her eyes - the concern and the determination to help me. I am truly lucky to have a friend like Hermione.
"Hear, Hear" Both, me and Ron uttered loudly as our plates were filled with different kinds of food and our goblets filled up with pumpkin juice.
A heavy silence came on us with what Malfoy had told us. Both our teams and Ravenclaw were thinking of the options laid out for us. Smiling, Malfoy bid us all goodbye before walking away from us.
"That's the same, Draco!!!" Hermione retorted.
From the previous chapter:
"Ah. Mr. Sirius Black. I heard of an unfortunate event that had happened. I thought you were dead. Pity..." He said politely but dripping with a sarcastic and demuring message.
Still leaning on the sliding door, Malfoy smirked a nasty one at Ron. "I wish that's the only reason" then he sighed as more voices joined in calling his name.
"Oh." I said awkwardly.
That was the last I heard before Mr. Weasley went outside for privacy. After 5 minutes, the twins came down from upstairs, still pale and sleepy.
Desperate, she took a hold of his jacket and yank it. "I'll do anything for my best friend." she said in a tone that was hard and strong.
"I guess?" I answered with a question. I seriously have forgotten that I was injured since it was hurting that much.
Surprise by his comment, I suddenly lookup. "How did you..."
I took a single breath and glanced at Hermione as she nods with much determination. "Let us hear them, Draco."
"Now, now. Mr. Finnigan. You don't have to be so impatient. I will explain them to you all. I just need the others to also listen. This is, after all, a class." Malfoy sneered at us.
Much to their relief, there’s nothing in the morning’s
With a terrible roar of anguish and a mind-crushing surge of power, I was dragged into the suffocating blackness. The sensations of my body came back in an excruciating rush—pain, cold, wetness, the press of the uneven ground against my back and the weight of my sodden clothes.
“NO! You move, Potter! Let someone else have a turn.”
“Maybe. Not all of us have an elf to make our meals, you know,” Harry laughs.
awareness of their attractiveness. And now he wishes he could Obliviate that moment in the bedroom from his memory.
dictate kicking Malfoy in the shins. He draws his wand and sends the cardboard box drifting ahead of him towards the kitchen.
Two weeks later, Draco steps out the front door of his building to go to Harry’s flat and almost walks into a trap.
Draco gives him an unimpressed look. “You’re the kind of bachelor who lives off takeaway and cheese toasties, aren’t you?”
This time, Harry has to knock on the door three times, making him worry that Malfoy changed his mind, after all. He looks harried but pleased when he finally opens the door, and he’s dressed just as impeccably as last week. Harry’s glad he put on one of his new jumpers.
“Yeah, I want to get the rest of these in before lunch.” Greg hands Harry a trowel and points to an empty bed. “About eighteen inches apart and four inches deep.”
The streets and shops were decorated for Christmas, and I took my time walking from the Apparition Point to the supermarket. It was lovely to feast my eyes on all the lights and colours after spending my days in Potter’s dim and dreary barn-house. Once I reached my destination, it took a considerable amount of time to find the correct things in the aisles. I also took the liberty of adding some biscuits and fresh fruit to the trolley, which were things he never bothered to get himself.
“Yes, but come in and have a cuppa with me,” she says, unlocking her door with the stubby wand that she pulled from her coat pocket. “I usually have a chat with Fiona at the greengrocers, but she’s laid up with a cold, poor thing. A bit of conversation keeps me sane, and it’s been days since I’ve had any. Unless you’re busy with something else?”
I realize that I was too forceful as I muttered an apology but my mind was still on kissing him.
"No, I really meant it. Hermione, thanks for the clothes, the soap for my bath, and the food." I smiled at her. "Without you, I would die, helplessly."
"I can and I will. After all, I am to be expelled. I am simply taking it to my own hands so I can achieve my rights against your unjust decision on my part in this incident." He said as stood up ready to leave the premises of the office. "Then I will be leaving to pack. After all, this meeting had already concluded my fate in this school."
"I won't!!!" Ron shouted.
'Who's Harry?' I thought.
For the first time, Hermione wasn't really sure of any of these. Especially, it wasn't connected to any person we’ve known so far, not even Voldermort. I wasn't any of the help because I don't know the name of the girl in my dreams. Or what the blood consuming is all about?
"M-Malfoy." I returned, still slightly unnerved by his attitude.
I stood thinking deeply as to what to do and to reassess the current situation as Harry and I, both, lost our belongings from the spiders' attack along with our food and water supply as well as our tent.
I stared at my cup as I swirl the liquid while I trying to gather my thoughts on this matter but I couldn't think of anything at this particular moment. "I don't have a plan, Draco," I admitted. "I don't have an idea of what to do."
"Is this it?" Ron muttered as the three of us were standing in front of the said place.
After a long discussion with both respected team's captains, Oliver Wood and Roger Davies, they came up with an agreement of keeping the commotion quiet with a bargain that the Ravenclaws giving up their practice slot to us, Gryffindor. Captain Roger Davies apologizes for the inappropriate action of his team members since he wasn't aware of what we're doing. Of course, it also goes that both I and Michael can't go to Pomfrey for our injuries.
Dinner was a torturous routine of little cheek kisses and coy looks and teasing smiles. Harry thought he might actually die from it all. But, Senior Auror as he was, he used his years of training to strengthen him for the task. The other dinner guests never seemed to notice his turmoil, at least.
He took the bait. “Oh?”
- - - - -
Draco heard a snort from behind him, then he was jostled as someone took a seat in the small space beside him. It was entirely too close to be polite. Draco glanced up to see who would possibly want to sit so near him and he was met with all-too-familiar green eyes.
Tiny, furry nifflers were wriggling around inside, crawling over each other and peep-ing softly. There were several gold coins in with them, the nifflers grasping them with their itty-bitty paws.
“Yes.”
He was full of nervous energy all through the morning, pulling shots and calling out names to the monochrome crowd of customers. The other barista on duty, Katelyn, shot him a look when he knocked over a jug of oat milk, but she knew better than to pry when he was in a mood. She silently shot a siphoning spell at the mess and moved on.
“It barely came with a toilet.”
Teasing, Draco blew on Harry’s cock, smiling at the tight twitch it elicited. He licked the bead of precome from the tip, and this time Harry groaned. Draco smiled sweetly. “Doing okay?”
Draco moans as Harry comes. He covers Harry’s body with his own, whispers in his ear, “You did so well,” and Harry can’t help the sigh that escapes. He falls asleep and dreams of lace.
for Draco Malfoy, and certainly not for Draco Malfoy’s lace underwear.
He snakes a hand between them and starts on Draco’s belt. Draco bucks against him, huffs a surprised breath.
fine cuisine. Good food is good food.” He pauses. “Also, it turns out it’s quite difficult to cook posh food when you only have a single stove burner and a tea kettle.”
They talk for some time, longer than Draco realizes or intends. Harry snags them two bottles of water and some pretzels from the kitchen, which he munches in between questions. He’s listening so intently to Draco that when Harry’s hand finds his, Draco grasps it without a thought. Harry’s hands are warm and broad and broom-callused. They make Draco’s heart go a little off-beat.
Draco put some final touches on a stall and walked over to him. “I know they’re a lot,” he said quietly, not meeting Harry’s eyes. “But— They just— They have nowhere else to
The room adjustments took the better part of a weekend, but in the end they had a spacious, fenced-in field for Maria Antonia to roam and a good-sized house for her to sleep, plus a play yard and a new burrow for the nifflers. Everyone seemed pleased. Even Firbramble came for a tour of the new space, but he was happy to return to his dining room den.
Harry groans and lays his head down on the sticky bar top. “What does that even mean?”
“Can I suck your cock, baby?” Harry asked, already leaning down to admire the pool of precome gathered on Charlie’s sweater.
Draco took Harry’s balls in one hand, rolling and gently tugging, and Harry started jerking his hips. “Fuck, babe, that’s so— Ah—” He was breathing hard now, the tip of his cock bumping against the back of Draco’s throat as he swallowed around him. “I’m— Wait, hold on—”
—like this. He’s dying to see more of Malfoy, to taste him, to feel the soft threads under his hands.
Draco nodded, unsure of what to say in response.
“Er, that’s hard to answer. I think, yeah, I would like to, but I’m not about to do anything to throw this away.” Harry gestured between them.
“Hey!” Potter protested. “I wasn’t horrible.”
“I do want to go to
Harry placed his hand on the back of Draco’s head, then quickly moved it and said, “Is that,
Harry likes that.
Harry, apparently, decided that ‘hang on’ meant ‘stop kissing my mouth and kiss me elsewhere instead.’ He’s pulled the collar of the t-shirt—
To the lace.
As if on cue, Scorpius yawns, the plastic nipple sliding from his mouth. The bottle falls toward the ground, but stops a second before hitting the floor.
“Yeah, but you’ve been known to like prats,” Dean points out. “Wait! No—is it—?”
“Charlie, hello.” Draco said, stepping forward.
EXT. FOREST -- DAY
Draco licked a stripe up the bottom of Harry’s cock and took the head into his mouth. Harry tangled a hand in Draco’s hair and tried not to come immediately. He looked up to see Charlie slowly working his own cock.
They ate dinner on a restaurant patio that night, both of them craving sunlight after a day spent underground. They sat close, their shoulders touching. There was a new intimacy between them, like they had crossed some sort of threshold together in the vault. Draco let go of the urge to run; he wanted to stay.
“Mph, Potter, let me get the question out—” Draco says, but he’s smiling, his hands on Harry’s hips.
Slowly, so that it feels like an eternity, Harry lets his hand go where it’s wanted to for weeks.
. Though I supposed having a professor who hated you didn’t help.”
It’s a little disconcerting, watching Malfoy dump vinegar on his chips and feeling this way.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Um, I don’t know, Hermione says—”
“Want you to keep your mouth on Harry. Let him fuck your face.”
He crumpled up eight drafts before settling on:
“And he hates Celestina Warbeck!”
“Cool.” Harry shifts so he’s facing Draco. “So what’s your life like these days?”
“Useful, that,” Charlie said with a grin. “Can you sit so I can see Draco’s arse properly?”
Potter was surprisingly good at street parking, but Draco still had no idea where they were eating. Harry had driven them into a part of town Draco wasn’t familiar with--squat brick buildings practically on top of each other, laundry hung out to dry on the small balconies, old men sitting in plastic chairs talking over cheap beer.
Malfoy, for his part, is cackling.
Luna smiled. “I’m so glad you two are together now,” she said, then walked off, presumably to bewilder someone else.
Thursday morning, Harry’s routine is blessedly uninterrupted. No memos poke him on his way to the lifts; no one stops to gawk at him; his desk is miraculously clear of glowing red file folders. He hangs up his coat, drops his bag on the floor, and makes for the kitchen. Just like always.
Draco felt like he’d just walked into one of those dreams where nothing makes sense. He cleared his throat.
So far, they had kissed extensively, exchanged lovely handjobs under the stars, and written salacious letters (which Draco was terrified would be intercepted), but this was the most forward Harry had been with Draco. Draco, who had been concerned that Harry would shift too much between his legs and feel the partial hard-on he always seemed to be sporting around Potter these days, was very pleased with the development.
Below the bare skin is a band of black lace. It disappears into his trousers.
Draco’s shift at the cafe started early the next day, but he was still awake before dawn, pacing restlessly around his flat. He decidedly did
Harry grabs Draco by the arm and they run into the forest.
I am never listening to you again.
Draco nodded.
“Tonight?” A less practiced man would have missed the flash of disgust on the woman’s face, but Draco saw it quite clearly and almost laughed. “I’m afraid not, sir.”
A MOUNTAIN TROLL holds DRACO upside down by the leg, examining him. HARRY crouches behind a boulder.
They made it through a bottle of wine and the first course before Draco was caressing Charlie’s thigh under the table with his foot. Harry kissed Draco’s neck softly when he got up for more bread, and Draco moaned quietly. Harry saw as Charlie adjusted himself under the table. They locked eyes in understanding.
“This,” he says, nodding at the food.
Out of a sort of morbid curiosity, Draco agreed.
“Yes,” said Harry, “beginning with you getting out of those clothes.” He slid a hand up Draco’s shirt to his chest, then stood and pulled the shirt over Draco’s head. Draco let him, raising his arms. Harry kissed him; Draco wondered if he could taste himself in his mouth.
Draco knows he probably needs to get up—from the light he can tell it’s close to 6 AM—but ignoring his responsibilities in favor of lying in bed with a beautiful man is an easy choice. He scoots toward Harry, carefully wraps an arm over his ribcage. Harry sighs in his sleep and presses against him.
Harry rolled his eyes, but squirmed around until he was straddling Draco.
“Alright, Potter?” Malfoy asks, cocking his head. “You look a bit poorly.”
It’s that Harry doesn’t want him to go.
That settled, Harry sorts out the next few files quickly—robbery, spell damage to residence, broom theft, missing toad—and he’s just about to get up for tea when a paper dragon slides under his door.
“Don’t stop yourself,” Draco said, looking up to make sure Harry understood. Harry’s pupils were wide and he grinned.
“Of course you know,” Harry sighed. “I think I’m the only wix that doesn’t know my family history.”
They went to dinner a few nights after the wedding; they were engaged seven months later. Their own wedding was peaceful, sweet, a late spring lunchtime affair attended by close friends and family. There seemed to be no way to decide where to live—Harry wanted Draco to move into Grimmauld Place, which he had worked for years to renovate, but Draco suggested they take up residence in the newly-restored wings of Malfoy Manor. In the end, they compromised with a warm, bright flat in Shoreditch, and the fresh start did them both good.
“It’s an incubator,” Draco said softly. “They’re too little to be on their own.”
Draco moaned around Harry’s cock. Harry withdrew from Draco’s lips and sat on the plush carpet. Draco shifted down to his knees and elbows, arching his back to put himself on display.
“I suppose we are,” Charlie answered. Already his gaze lingered on Draco’s parted lips. Harry could only imagine what Charlie was thinking of doing to that lush mouth - perhaps what Harry himself had done to Draco only hours earlier. He bit his lip as his cock twitched. Dinner first, they’d decided. Food and wine and talk, then they could do as they liked.
Shifting a little lower, Harry sucks what he can of Draco’s sac. Draco squirms, thrusts in tight little jolts, and Harry flicks one of Draco’s nipples with his thumb. He wants so badly for Draco to feel as exquisite as Harry does. Draco gasps, growls. He reaches down and pulls his cock from the confines of the lace, circles the base with tight fingers. Harry chances a glance up. Draco’s eyes are burning hot, his lips swollen and red, his mouth open in a pant.
“Draco.”
Charlie stopped the movement of his hand. When Draco whined, he tapped the side of Draco’s hip and Draco moaned.
, Potter.”
Malfoy looks at the paperboard box Harry’s just dropped on his desk. “What’s that?”
The peaceful morning has him so cheerful that he forgets, for a moment, about the lace. That is, at least, until he sees Malfoy, all posture and poise, furiously covering some parchment with his delicate handwriting. Harry immediately feels his face flush and his horrible brain offers:
When Potter drove up to the valet stand and Draco finally glimpsed the name of the restaurant, Draco had to admit he was impressed.
Malfoy looked up then, and afterwards Harry would credit their entire relationship to that moment: Malfoy all squatted down, fine robes sprinkled with kneazle hair, smiling gently up at Harry. The reception hall seemed to fade away for a second, the music and heat of the room dulling, and Harry thought,
Harry kisses him.
Draco obeyed, backing his arse up against the bulge in Charlie’s trousers. He looked beautiful - flushed and wanting - and Harry kissed him eagerly. He cupped his hands around Draco’s neck, delved his tongue into Draco’s hot mouth, and Draco leaned into the kiss. He rocked against Charlie, and Harry pulled away to see Charlie’s freckled hand palming Draco’s cock through the thin fabric of his trousers. Harry unbuttoned Draco’s flies and Charlie withdrew Draco’s pink cock, already leaking.
FADE OUT
“Really?”
He dreams of the taste of come and his traitorous head supplies a hypothesis of what lace would feel like on his tongue. He brings himself off in bed, then again in the shower. His skin feels too tight. He so rarely craves something—
“Rough morning?” asked Deacon as he tied on a black apron.
“I—o, just normal—hy are you asking?”
- - - - -
Draco sank to his knees. “Mm-hmm.”
When Draco looks up at Harry, there are tears in his eyes. “I love it, Harry. It’s perfect.” He clears his throat, takes a sip of wine. “I got you something too, but I didn’t wrap it, so you have to close your eyes.”
“Bicorns eat devoted husbands,” he said, still laughing. “She’s just a baby, and she’s never been around others to teach her, but it must be instinctive.”
slowly until Harry has to beg: “Please, Draco, pleasegodfuck
Seamus and Dean laugh. “Okay, not as bad as Melvin,” admits Seamus. “He didn’t even know who
He can see perhaps four centimeters of the fabric, and he can’t make out any details. Harry thinks,
“The hubris of man,” Harry said solemnly.
“What was that about?” asked Draco, mostly to himself.
“One more,” murmured Draco, adding a third finger. It was almost unbearable—he wanted to be inside Harry
After the war, they attended the same funerals, the same weddings, the same ceremonies and trials and unveilings. Potter was always surrounded. His friends guarded him like crups, keeping him away from the Ministry, the press, the public. Draco saw him through the crowds. They’d managed to spot each other across the room since they were eleven years old; time did nothing to change that.
Harry shrugged. He got up and rinsed his face in the bathroom sink, taking deep breaths. He wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep, not after that.
“Always lovely, that Talia, isn’t she?” Malfoy says. Harry can hear the smirk before he sees it.
Harry is aware that baby Hugo seems to be having some sort of newborn emotional crisis and that Hermione is talking to the baby, not Harry, but (though he will die before admitting it) he pretends it’s for him.
Harry has questions now: Does Malfoy wear lace underwear every day, or just today? Would the knickers feel soft against Harry’s hand, or rough? If Malfoy has more than one pair, are they all black, or are there other colors? Harry catches himself smirking when he thinks of Malfoy wearing Slytherin-green under his high-end clothes, which leads to an image of Malfoy wrapped in Gryffindor red, which Harry forces himself to extinguish as quickly as it blooms in his mind. It takes several recitations of Cannons lineups before his blood pressure returns to normal.
Potter patted the bench next to him. “Then stay. We haven’t spoken since the—er, since Hogwarts.”
“Harry Potter, will you—” But Draco doesn’t get to finish, because Harry is hauling him up by his hands, wrapping himself around Draco, pressing their lips together.
Before he could lose his nerve, Draco stood and disapparated.
Draco was well into veterinary school by the time Harry pulled his head out of his arse and realized they liked each other. True to form, Draco had known for years that Harry liked him—“Since we did that week-long plant care course with Longbottom in 2001, you dimwit,” Draco liked to say with affection. Unfortunately, as Hermione frequently pointed out, age did nothing to improve Harry’s ability to recognize his own emotions.
Andromeda hugged him as soon as she opened the door. He tried his best not to be too stiff, but it had been a long time since he’d been hugged. In the end, he'd settled on folding his arms around her, conscious of the fact that she was the same height his mother had been.
Charlie laid down lengthwise on the sofa. “You can sit down now, baby.” Draco started to straddle Charlie’s thighs, but Charlie shook his head. “I want to see your pretty little arse up close. I want to taste you.”
Harry stops breathing.
“Doing what?”
Harry relaxed around him (Draco was relieved—he’d been half-worried Harry had never done this before) and Draco slowly moved his finger out and back in. After a few strokes, he said, “Another?”
“Aye, they’re different,” Seamus agrees.
“It’s—”
They sat at a small, plastic table outside. The same soft guitar music played out of a speaker on the wall, and little strings of lights were hung across the open space above them. It was quieter, just the two of them. Draco was still a little disarmed by the turn of events, but the cool night air felt calming.
“It’s just for a week,” Draco said, stroking the bicorn’s newborn-soft fur. Two tiny horns poked out of its head. It huffed a sigh. “Just until she’s old enough to go to a—”
He realized he was staring and blinked, but Harry was still examining the vault. He peeked under a white sheet at an ancient wardrobe. “So do you have a separate vault for gold?” he asked without looking over.
“Pansy said you’d wanted to go there for ages.”
Harry nodded. “Kiss me,” he breathed, and Draco did, adding a second finger at the same time. Harry moaned into the kiss when Draco found his prostate, rubbing with gentle strokes. Draco scissored his fingers, gently stretching Harry, listening as his breathing became quick again.
Draco nodded. His lips were swollen and wet, his neck and face flushed, and Harry wanted him so, so badly. Draco leaned down and took Harry between his lips again. Harry fisted his fingers in Draco’s hair, careful not to pull too hard, and coaxed Draco down slowly. “That’s so good, Draco, you’re doing so well,” Harry moaned.
The room was almost overwhelming with the booming music, made more claustrophobic by wixen shouting to be heard above the slightly-out-of-date hits. Harry still hated crowds, but Hermione had made him promise to stay for at least an hour, so he’d wandered over to the least-populated corner to get some air. And there was Malfoy, his face soft, a little smile pulling at his lips as he lavished compliments on the little kneazle.
Charlie stood. “Join me on the couch, Draco?”
“Can I kiss you?” Harry asked.
The nifflers were adorable; caring for them wasn’t difficult, besides the feedings every two hours, but Draco did most of those anyway. Harry found he liked having them around. At first, while they were still fragile, Draco took them with him to the clinic each day, hidden under Harry’s invisibility cloak in the passenger seat of his car. Within a couple of weeks, all nine little fluffs were pilfering Draco’s cufflinks and hoarding silverware in their pouches. They slept piled up in their makeshift burrow; Draco had charmed the walls of their nest to be like a one-way mirror so he could monitor them.
“Sure. Look, Harry, I don’t know why you’ve reverted to your teenage crush on him—”
“Can you conjure lube?” Draco asked, already knowing the answer. Harry furrowed his brow and a dollop of warm lube appeared on Draco’s outstretched palm. Draco laughed and kissed him again. He reached between Harry’s legs and delicately ran a finger from Harry’s sack to his hole, teasingly circled it, then up to his cock for a stroke. Harry groaned and arched up, searching for his touch, so Draco dipped back down and stroked his hole, carefully pressing his index finger inside.
Afterward, they lay together, Draco’s head on Harry’s chest, talking in soft voices. Draco told Harry about writing the letter to Andromeda; Harry told Draco about walking into the forest that day in May, knowing he was about to die. Draco traced Harry’s ribs and thanked whatever fates or gods had put them there, together in the dark, tingling with Harry’s cleaning charm and the very beginnings of love.
Harry smiles. “Yeah, I could see that. Your new place didn’t come with a cook?”
By Friday, Harry is well and truly wrecked.
“Wanna taste you,” he growls. “Come up—can you sit—” But he doesn’t have to finish because Draco is already shoving his trousers down his legs. He moves to pull the panties down too, but Harry stills his hand. “Leave them.”
Finally, Malfoy nudges Harry with his shoulder. “What’s left for your day?”
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Go on, then. I’ll see you tonight.”
The cake was placed delicately on the stand, and the chatter around them quieted down. They started a rousing Happy Birthday, with which Teddy sang along quite exuberantly, and then someone was divvying up slices and everyone was loud again. Teddy, of course, used his hands to smash his cake into his face and then immediately demanded more. Andromeda told him he could have another piece if he went to sit with a very elderly woman who was apparently his great-great aunt.
“I come here all the time. The youth shelter isn’t far from here, and once I tried it I couldn’t stay away. Now I’m here at least once a week for lunch, more if I can find the time.”
“Isn’t it?”
Harry treats the clerk’s minor burn, vanishes the spilt tea, and practically runs to his office. He slams the door and groans. Don’t be a prat, Ron said. Obviously that was too much to hope for, since Harry has always been and will always be a brainless sod when Malfoy is around.
Draco is laying on the couch, curled protectively around Scorp, who is swaddled and fast asleep. Harry gets closer and hears that Draco is snoring softly. The morning light filtering through the sheer curtains illuminates them both, papa and baby, lost in sleep.
“I’m ready.” Harry raked his fingers up Draco’s back, and Draco gasped.
Draco huffs a laugh. “Gatecrashing, Potter?”
Harry looked at him for a long moment, then nodded and began to sort through the piles once more.
“Did you just—?”
this, and
Draco finds Harry’s t-shirt collection in a drawer and pilfers a soft grey crew neck. From there, he spots an emerald cardigan. It’s loose on him, but he pushes the sleeves up and leaves it unbuttoned over Harry’s shirt.
Harry sat down in the grass. Four nifflers crawled up his shirt. Annie chewed on his ear.
Draco nodded.
Now Harry turned around. “So where’s—” His face changed with the realization. “Oh.”
Harry summons a blanket from the bedroom, carefully tucking it only up to their waists so it doesn’t touch Scorpius. He waves a hand and the lamp turns out, leaving the room bathed in the golden light of morning. Breathing in Draco’s smell, listening to the soft, sweet breathing of their baby, he drifts back to sleep.
Maria Antonia—Annie, Harry had started calling her, to Draco’s horror—needed grooming and exercise and ate about her weight in grain every day. She’d also developed a habit of gnawing on Harry, which Draco found hilarious.
Harry smiled. “Only when he’s bad.”
There were a dozen or so children running about, their parents nearby; Draco assumed they were Andromeda’s assorted friends. Teddy seemed to be in his element with everyone doting on him and telling him how dapper he looked in his little blazer. He kept wandering over to the gift table and poking at the various bags and boxes, only for Andromeda or another adult to herd him back to the games. There were a few teary kids here and there—falls and scrapes and snatched toys—but generally, everyone was in good spirits. Draco was content watching from the garden wall, where he sat with a cup of lemonade and a now-empty plate.
The menu is full of the kind of food Harry is accustomed to eating at the Burrow: Pies and potatoes and toasties and sweets. Malfoy orders a sandwich and chips; Harry opts for kidney pie.
“Hello,” came a soft voice from his side. Draco nearly jumped out of his skin. He turned to see Luna Lovegood smiling distantly at him, holding what appeared to be an enthusiastically-decorated stick. She turned it end over end and it made a sound like beads were rolling from one end to the other. “Rainmaker?” Lovegood asked, looking at Draco expectantly.
Harry and the kid are both covered in scalding hot Earl Grey, the kid babbling, “I’m sorry, so sorry—Harry—I mean—Auror Potter—so sorry—” as Harry wishes he could sink into the carpet.
The office door bursts open. “H.A. Potter, did you get a moment to— Oh. Oh my god.”
Draco laughed. “Ah, yes. Undesirable Number One. Of course.”
Just then, Harry sends a boulder flying at the troll’s head. The troll drops Draco and cradles its face.
“Harry, love. I love you more than—more than anything. More than everything. I feel so lucky every day that I get to be yours. I love every moment with you, even the hard ones. I never want to be away from you, love. I want to be yours forever.” Now Draco’s eyes are really shining, and Harry can’t look away from him. Doesn’t want to.
Harry smiles when Dean toys with a little curl around Seamus’s ear. Seamus catches the look.
Malfoy snorts. “That’s fair.”
Draco recognized the compassion Andromeda showed him; it was the same love his mother had hidden a layer beneath her careful pureblood politeness. His favorite memories of his mother were times he glimpsed her with all her walls down—when she braided his hair as a young boy, or as she lay in the garden reading—and he saw those moments in Andromeda, too, especially when she looked at Teddy. It made him feel close to both of them, Narcissa and Andromeda.
He had no intention of moving from his shady spot to join the crowd, but Andromeda waved him over once and then again when he hadn’t moved a moment later. With a sigh, he steeled himself and reluctantly made his way to the tables.
the expression on his face—flushed, lips parted, eyes bright. He loved Harry’s responsiveness; he loved that Harry was reacting to
The sun is in Harry’s eyes. He rolls onto his stomach with a soft groan. His back aches.
Fernando chuckled. “Close! You’re getting better. That’s like, what is she like, you know, as a person? You mean como esta.”
“What?”
“He said ‘See you in the morning’?”
Draco had his wand out, expanding Annie’s barn, humming happily. “What do you want for dinner?” he asked.
“Just a minute,” Draco murmurs. His eyelids are heavy, but this moment feels too sacred to let go of. Not yet. Warm Harry, sweet Scorpius, all together in Draco’s arms. He still can’t believe his luck.
, Draco thought.
“When—” Draco broke off, unsure, but Harry took his hand, nodded to show he was listening. Draco looked down at their intertwined fingers, letting Harry’s warmth ground him, and kept going. “When Father died, his assets were seized, which was—most of it. Mother still had some of the Black fortunes, of course, since she was the only heir left. But by the time we realized the Ministry wasn’t going to unfreeze Father’s gold she was already—” He broke off and swallowed around the lump in his throat. Harry smoothed his thumb over Draco’s hand. “Well, she was quite ill. We tried to get around it. She was quite clever, putting gold in a muggle bank. But there are so many regulations to follow, and there are limits to how many Galleons you can convert. So, in the end, it wasn’t much.”
t-shirt—aside and is steadily sucking marks across Draco’s shoulder.
It was then that Draco emerged from the bedroom. Charlie, who had been complimenting Harry on the smell of warm bread cooking, fell abruptly silent. Harry followed Charlie’s eyes to where Draco stood, flushed from the heat of the bathroom. Draco wore a black lace top buttoned to his delicate throat and form-fitting black trousers. He looked more exquisite than Harry had ever seen him (with clothes on) and Harry didn’t blame Charlie for being distracted.
Deacon snorted. “I bet you will.”
Andromeda began rounding everyone up for cake (Teddy screamed, “Cake!” so loud the sound echoed). Molly Weasley had apparently made the cake, as well as most of the generous spread. Draco remembered the snide comments he made in school, prodding Weasley about how his mother could possibly afford to feed all of her children. The regret weighed heavy on him now.
Malfoy turned toward him. “Don’t be ridiculous, Potter.”
He brushes his thumb against Draco’s lips, curls his fingers under Draco’s jaw. He feels the stubble there. He feels the slight crack in Draco’s bottom lip where it’s chapped. Draco inhales, shakily, but doesn’t move.
When Harry started moving his hips to meet Draco’s hand, Draco withdrew. Harry let out a little whimper that Draco kissed away. “More lube?” The lube was in his palm before he even finished asking.
Or maybe he would?
“Mm, how about we all take everything off?” Draco asked coyly, beginning to undo a button on the lacy top.
“Almost lost your cake, there,” Potter said, and Draco saw how he had his plate tilted precariously. He nodded again and stood.
Harry can’t help the small noise that escapes, a little bit of surprise but mostly relief. Draco smiles against him. Harry takes Draco’s waist, pulls him close, and Draco molds to him with more kisses, needy and fast. Before he can consider what he’s doing, Harry grabs Draco’s shirt, pulls it up, and his fingers find their way to Draco’s waistband.
“I’m well, thanks, Fernando. How’s Lita, how’s the baby?” Harry smiled back just as broadly. “Erm, wait. Como--como es la bebe?”
Maybe longer, if he thought about it, but he’s not thinking right now.
would be cause for the way Harry feels right now.
“Fuck, yes,” Draco said, and bit his lip.
Harry and Draco had been dating for two months before Harry told Draco about Charlie.
He awoke a few hours later, breathing hard, his whole body tense. He scrambled for his wand on the side table, still half asleep and terrified.
overthink his outfit, because it didn’t matter what Potter thought of how he was dressed, and because Potter probably wouldn’t show up anyway.
“Okay.” Harry sighed. “Okay.”
“Er, hello, Wently. I haven't seen it yet - three VU cases this morning, if you can believe.” Harry clears his throat. “I’ll have a look when I get back to my desk and owl you.”
Harry kissed him then, and Draco let him explore his mouth with his tongue. Draco rubbed his hands up and down Harry’s thighs, adoring the rasp of hair, until Harry bucked his hips and moaned. Draco pulled back. “Is this okay?” he asked, sliding a finger under Harry’s waistband.
Harry catches him in a kiss, chaste and sweet and lingering, and Draco feels him the rest of the day.
“They just need to stay with us until they’re old enough to eat solid food, then we can send them to a sanctuary.” Draco waved his wand at one of the gold coins, levitating it slowly around the incubator, letting the little animals chase after it excitedly. Harry felt his heart swell at the look on Draco’s face, so soft and affectionate.
When he passes Malfoy’s desk, the chair is empty. Harry frowns and stomps the rest of the way to the kitchenette. He pilfers a banana from the fruit bowl, aware that this will likely be his only break today, and pulls the peel back before starting back to his cubicle.
“Potter, what--?” he started.
Draco grinned. “You like it? Harry picked it out. He thought you might enjoy it.”
He peeks in Harry’s cabinet, telling himself it’s just to see what his chances are of finding any hair products he can actually use. It’s surprisingly well-stocked: hand lotion, shaving kit, moisturizers, cologne, spare shampoo bottles. Draco takes a moment to uncap the cologne and almost melts—so that’s where that Harry-smell comes from.
Lovegood had made her way down the bench opposite them. She had recovered her rainstick. “Hello, Harry. You look lovely. Hello, Draco. Thank you for protecting my rainstick earlier.”
He reaches around the chair into his messenger bag to pull out a slender, wrapped box. Draco’s eyebrows raise a fraction of an inch - he’s surprised Harry remembered a present, Harry guesses. “For you, love. I hope you like it.”
“You look so good like this, baby,” Harry said. He leaned down and tongued one pert nipple through the black lace. “So pretty.” Harry teased his fingers up the length of Draco’s cock and ground down against Charlie’s. They intoned their pleasure at the same time. Harry thought he’d never felt so powerful.
His eyes surrounded by those thick and long light blond lashes were flushed with a light more dazzling than any star and full of resolute. He spoke, "It does not mean that the title of 'the boy who lived', that it's a must for you to need to carry a burden of being perfect and having absolute power. No one is perfect, believe me, I know. So, you don't have to be responsible for everything and everyone.
"Harry?" Hermione asked as she looks at me, with curiosity, along her Ginny was worriedly watching me. "Is something wrong?"
“No…no, no, no” I frantically repudiated. Like I was more like trying to convince myself instead of the stranger in front of me.
"It was also the day, we all decided to find your Godfather, Harry." Hermione said.
"I think I'm going to be sick" I got up immediately and rush into the nearby bathroom as fast as my two feet could bring me. After me, Hermione trailed behind. As I reached the bowl, I gave a heaved and all of my dinner from last night came out. Hermione diligently patted my back as I vomited. The mixture of sour and bitter after taste of my puke still tangle inside my mouth as I slide unto the floor, resting my head onto the cool wood pane of the wall.
"As I was saying it all started when Sirius went missing and we stumbled upon runes inside a cave." I said and started to reminisce about that particular event.
"I can see that" Sirius teased me. "Was it Ginny?" He wiggled his eyebrow suggestively at me then to Ginny, who also blushed.  The Twins sniggered at the side. All attention was drawn at us, even Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. And it is very embarrassing. Sometimes, Sirius could be such a child.
"Harry" She gasped in excitement. "I am close"
End of the previous chapter.
"Ah hah" I gasped.
"Morning, Hermione," I greeted back as I was blushing, as I remember last night's kiss with Draco. Slowly, I wobbled to sit beside her on the soft sofa and thank her as she handed a cup of milk that smelled heavenly for some reason and I took a sip. My eyes widen in a small fracture as I stared at the milk then I asked Hermione. "Draco's?"
"No." She answered after a long time. "It doesn't speak of death as I always see. It tells a different aspect of your future."
'That's right, Harry. You are alive but you're now different' Her voice came back.
Hermione gasped at my side as her eyes double in size. "Are those Hemotropic butterflies?'
Everything about him was so addictive and mesmerizing, that I have to admit my full defeat.
"Mornin'!" Hagrid grinned at me, Hermione, and Ron.
The girl then went on a series chattering that I was not concerned about as I was still bound in these ropes. I growl in frustration and hunger as the pain keeps pulsating inside my head and my body.
"In the meantime, I would like you to go to Pomfrey for a Dreamless potion. Tell her that you will be needing it from now on." He said.
I got ready for a bursting comeback from Hermione but Hermione apologetically looks at Draco - my head went into a confused state.
"So, this is case closed." Headmaster Dumbledore said as he stood up.
“What it is?” I asked as my mouth watered from the appetizing smell and the meat looked so juicy and tender.
"What do you mean, Malfoy?" Wood stared at Malfoy as if Malfoy had miraculously had grown two more hands.
Stay in tune for the new updates. (with new twist and plots) Tehee!!!
But...but I am desperate and I need someone to save me.
-------------------------------------------------
"Don't you dare talk to me, Werewolf." Mr. Malfoy sneered at the offered peace. Sirius went crazy in Remus' arms. The twins, Ron and I were on the edge now as we glared at the Malfoys. Hermione and Ginny were watching on the sides.
“Oh. Okay.” I muttered feeling like an idiot. ‘I should have thought of that.’
"Blimey!" Ron muttered. "That's was..." Ron couldn't continue and I wasn't able to think as well about what had just happened. "Different" Ron breathless ended his sentence.
I stood immediately, surprising Hermione, who was beside me as I ran across the room to Malfoy and grabbed his left arm. Raising it, I was overcome with relief and confusion as I saw a perfect hand since I was sure that Malfoy did cut it off and fed it to me when I was still...Out of control.
Malfoy lets out a huff, “If you must know your friend the mudblood asked me to talk to you.”
“And exactly where have you been?”
Draco nodded and conjured a quill and parchment, but before he could leave the room Harry said, “Erm, thank you for… you know, last night.”
“So? A guy can appreciate an apology letter as well as any girl!”
“Voldemort's.”
I jump and spin around. Draco Malfoy is leaning against the wall. He shouldn't be allowed to look that good in his school robes. The whole reason I’m here in the first place comes rushing back.
All in all, Draco thought it was a fun day, despite the fact that his husband had a near fatal injury. But honestly, the happiest Draco ever felt was when he was with Ron, Hermione, Rose and Harry.
Harry heard retreating footsteps, and then the door slammed with a hard thud.
“I-I’m sorry. I uhhhh, I have to go.” With that Draco jumped down from the tree and vanished on the spot.
He stands there for a second staring at me.
“Thanks for having faith in the Slytherin house, but I don’t want to go through all the trouble.”
Harry pressed his back against a stall door and slid down, putting his face in his arms.
Ron started cracking up. “That makes so much sense!” He laughed, “I thought you were just jealous of him, but you just had a crush on him!”
Harry was looking a little embarrassed, “He said that it was obvious you’re gay.”
He put a locking charm on the door and continued up the stairs until he reached the top. The hole had been fixed from when he was here last. He heard a sniffle. He was not alone. He turned to see a flash of platinum blonde hair.
He leaned over and sloppily kissed Draco, half-laughing. Everyone cheered.
“Mother!” Draco said, rushing over to her and supporting her side, as she was leaning heavily on the doorframe. She looked frail and tired, but there was a light in her eyes as she gazed at him.
Draco shifted uncomfortably; he didn’t like being pestered to eat. He never really had an appetite after the war. “It’s fine. But I appreciate your concern Potter.”
Draco knew that those were empty words, but he didn’t say anything. His Department trusted him no more than the other former Death Eaters. And he was always given the jobs that no one wanted.
When he spoke for the first time his voice was full of rage, but it was quiet, dangerous rage. “What the fuck were you doing?”
“Glad you're okay mate!” Bill smiled.
“And I will hold,
“Relax Potter, I was just teasing.” Then added, “I would be honored to go with the great Chosen One.”
Luna fell in step beside him, “I’m doing very well thank you. I just wanted to pass on a message.”
They stood there in an awkward silence for the next couple of minutes. Then Harry remembered.
Ginny turned around and stared at him, “What? Really?”
“But aren’t Slytherins the crafty ones? You could think of something.”
They all stood there in shock.
‘I am doing, welll thhhank you veeeery muchhh.’
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head, “Oh Merlin’s fucking tits, that was so long ago.”
I walk into the closet, and close the door behind me. Malfoy’s right, it was bigger than expected. But, still small.
… A Few Days Later...
‘Fuck it.’ He thought. “I should probably tell him at least half…’
Cosmo ran out of the room, and Harry got ready.
“Hey guys!” Neville said, “You want to play Exploding Snap?”
Draco nodded, “I am, thank you Potter.”
Harry buried his face in his hands and he started to shake. And Draco couldn’t stand it anymore. So he scooted closer and wrapped his arms around the crying man. It was his turn to help.
Draco held his ground as Lucius’ eyes bored into his. When Harry came back down with Narcissa they were still staring daggers at each other.
They sat down on the soft material, and Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Malfoy spun around and walked down the stairs. Harry heaved himself up. He reached for his glasses and pressed them onto his face.
“You're staring, loudly.”
“Well,” Draco said when they broke apart, “I didn’t forget.”
Ron looks excited, “Fred and George told me about this! There’s these little hoops…”
Harry nodded, “Me too. I always thought I had a romantic attraction to you, but maybe it was just a familial love. I don’t really know.”
“Why are you being so nice to me?”
My thoughts are interrupted by a tap on my arm. “What now Hermione! I'm in the middle of a train of thought!”
The Slytherin opened the door, and they stepped inside the house. To Harry’s surprise it wasn’t dusty at all, he thought it would be since Draco’s mother was stuck in bed. ‘But they have house elves.’ He thought, ‘That makes sense.’
Draco glanced at him, “Don’t you have to go to the Burrow?”
‘I’m so sorry.’ I think once more.
Harry blinked, unprepared for conversation, “Yeah. Uhh, do you need something?”
“Where is he!” He asked the receptionist frantically.
“So we were sitting up in the tree, and having a pretty deep conversation. He told me… something… that made me cry. And ummm… I really don’t know what happened next… I don’t know who started it, but we… We might have kissed.”
“Will you hand me the file?” Harry said, not meeting his eyes.
“For you! You think Mad-Eye died for you? You think George took that curse for you! You may be the Chosen One mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that. It’s always been bigger than that.”
He heard the creaky door open. He turned to see who it was scrambling to his feet. Then he straightened his robes and tried to look dignified. He was unsuccessful.
Harry’s head turned and his eyes darkened as he saw the shack. “I know exactly where we are. I haven’t exactly been here. But I *remember* it.”
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not-
“What are you saying?”
Draco slid out of bed. He couldn’t sleep. All of the excitement of the day had left him giddy. So giddy that he had drunk way too much. He was so drunk in fact, that he couldn’t play the annual game of Weasley Christmas Quidditch. Instead he sat on the sidelines with Luna, talking nonsense about wrackspurts.
Harry pursed his lips, “I wasn’t playing hero. There were two of them. You were outnumbered.”
When they all stepped off the platform Ginny, Ron and Hermione went off to Mrs, and Mr. Weasley. (Harry had already told them that he wasn’t going.) Luna and Neville went off to their respective guardians. Harry was left waiting for Draco, while being goggled at by students and their families.
Hello wonderful humans! So, my mental state has not been the best recently, so the next chapter might be a little shorter than usual. Hopefully I can get it up next Wednesday. Cross your fingers! Anyway, enjoy!
“Mate, just admit that you're in love!” Ron says.
Then Draco lost it. He just lost his shit right there. He started sobbing into Harry’s shoulder.
“I told you, I did. But the Healers said that they couldn't help him. They said that the Dark Mark would hold some dark magic and if they touch it they could get injured. I told them it was rubbish, but they wouldn’t listen.”
“Merlin, we’re being immature right now.” (Harry purposely changed the subject.)
Harry looked at the file, grabbed Draco’s hand and once more pulled him into Side-Along.
Draco just stood there deciding what to say. He settled on: “When did you find out?”
“Oh, and don’t worry,” Dean says, “I won’t out you.”
Harry looked at the small creature and frowned, ‘You don’t look very well.’
Draco stretched open his eyes, and was immediately blinded. It was an unusually bright day. But that’s not all that made today special. It was the day of the full moon. The day when the Time-Turner would be put to use again. And most likely at Malfoy Manor.
Draco answered her question this time, “They would keep out everybody who isn’t family or close friends. And we would have control over which friends we let in.”
Ron fake glared at him, “Oh, you’re so on.”
“On the count of three you will cast your charms to Disarm your opponent, and only to Disarm. We don’t want any accidents here. One… Two-”
“I was looking for a magical signature. And I think I found it.”
I grab his wrist as he tries to leave. “I’m completely supportive! Thank you for trusting me. Your forgetting that I’m bisexual myself.”
That was all it took. Draco leaned down even further and smashed their lips together. They rolled around on the grass. Their laughter filled the night air. They finally stopped, gasping for air, and half under a white rose bush. Petals fell down around them.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
(“So he’s Draco now.”)
He looked down at his arm. It was mangled and torn. He didn't care.
“We were too busy hexing each other's bullox off.”
“What game?”
Ginny laughed and shook her head, “No it’s not. It’s actually someone you know.”
“Yes I will.”
Draco laughed so hard his stomach hurt.
Draco nodded a little confused. Arthur had every right to be upset with him. He opened his mouth to formally apologize, but Arthur had already rejoined the celebrations.
Harry rolled his eyes. Which happened to have more colors than just green, and revealed everything.
“Yes!” Cosmo squealed, and Coco nodded. “We’d love to help.”
Harry’s heart felt lighter then it had in days. He burst into the room, the other two Healer Trainees were grinning from ear to ear as they packed up their things and left.
I reach its large hump, tap it once with my wand and say: “Dissendium.”
Draco was proud of her. She had changed her last name back to Black, and asked Draco if he wanted to do the same. He had declined saying that he was still proud to be a Malfoy. Fortunately Narcissa had respected his choice.
Harry peered at the photo. It was of Lois Sadder and, what Harry assumed was his husband Payton, kissing under a maple tree.
“Okay… go ahead, I guess.”
This time Harry didn't ask Draco to do the enchantments. Just gave a slight nod indicating that they were about to move on. He seemed to have already made the connection in his head.
Harry pursed his lips, “Alright. I just won’t tell you the thing I was going to tell you.” Harry plopped down on the couch beside his boyfriend, crossing his arms and pouting.
Harry rolled his eyes, “One would think after eleven years of being married and sharing a last name, you would stop calling me that.”
“I think I know why it changed.” Harry said, dragging Draco out of his thoughts. “Let’s check the other coordinates.” His voice had become cold, and it tugged at Draco’s heartstrings.
So every morning when Draco got to the Ministry he would keep his head down and walk quickly to his own office. The fact that he was even allowed a job was a miracle.
“I shall make it easy for you…”
“Keep going.”
Without moving he cracked one eye open. Panicking and thinking of what happened frequently back to the Manor when someone watched him sleep.
“POTTER!”
Malfoy sighed, “Fine, I’ll help you.”
A gash appeared in his left arm right on top of the Dark Mark. And he found that he didn't care. He didn't care that there was blood dripping from his arm. He didn't care. He needed to feel pain.
They represent all of those endless days while I was searching for Horcruxes, and thinking about him.
He took a deep breath and walked over to where Draco was sitting. “Hey.” He murmured.
It was Harry’s whisper of: “No… NO… not Cedric, PLEASE not Cedric!” That made Draco spring into action.
Hermione laughed, “So is that a yes?”
Draco quickly dressed and headed for the Apparition point in his house. He hoped his mother wouldn’t catch him up this early.
“That’s Granger.” Draco scowled, “Always putting her nose where it doesn’t belong.”
“Before we eat,” she said, with a smile on her face, “Harry, I think Arthur has something to tell you. He’s out back, by the South Garden.”
Draco blinked, “Yes. About last night. We were both drunk weren’t we? Drunk people make bad decisions. I assure you that it meant nothing. So, don’t worry about it.”
So don't give up on,
They exchanged a concerned glance, Hermione whispered something and Ron nodded.
“Also, I’m a half-blood orphan just like you! Sort of. I mean, both my parents are wizards and they’re still around, but like, I’m still a half-blood orphan! So we’d be perfect for each other! You should meet my boyfriend too, he kind of hates you but-”
Ron looked up, “Seriously? How dense are you? I know for a fact that Malfoy’s gay.”
There was clattering and then a house elf appeared with a knife and three plates. Harry heard Ron cut the cake and place it on one of the plates. Then a smash as he dropped it.
Some of the students probably knew that something was up, too. By the time Easter rolled around, Harry was caught brushing his hand over Draco’s bum in the corridors. Hermione got the ‘I knew it’ look, and Ron just looked surprised and slightly disgusted.
He looked up at the Slytherin who was struggling not to laugh. “Very funny.” He stuck out his tongue and put the pin on his shirt.
Ron choked on his food, and Hermione dropped her book. Ginny glared at Harry, but he just smiled innocently.
The second one, Charlie said, “I don’t know Joey? What do we do.”
“I’m gay.”
He turned his head, Hermione was waving at him from the fifth table. He pulled the Invisibility Cloak off of him as he sat down.
“What?” He said, feigning innocence.
Draco cut him off with a kiss. “I love it.”
“Hey Harry, can I umm, can I talk to you.”
Hours later they were sitting in the Astronomy Tower gazing up at the stars.
Harry jerked his head sharply to look at him.
“But you had no choice.”
“Alright let's do it.”
Then he walked right out of the common, not even telling Ron where he was going.
It took a while, but the next chapter is finally up. There is some homophobia And homophobic language in this chapter again. As well as some very minor abuse. You have been warned.
“Nah, it suits you.” He paused, “In all seriousness-”
Hermione looked a little scared. “Harry…” she said quietly, “Please, he probably wasn’t thinking straight.”
Draco shook his head, “No. Since I am a former Death Eater I should be the one to wear it because if I did the spells, I would be shipped off to Azkaban.”
The first one grabbed her school bag. He ripped something off of it. A rainbow patch.
Draco flopped on his bed and sighed. He had just gotten back from the Three Broomsticks. It was eleven and he was bone tired.
Malfoy’s frown deepened, “Which one?” Then he slapped a hand over his mouth, just realizing that he had given Blaise the opportunity to be more specific.
Ron looks at me from across our caldron, “Just kiss him already!”
When they reached the top of the stairs Harry set down his bag and pulled out his Transfiguration essay.
The blonde gave a tight lipped smile. “Yeah.”
Ron looked helplessly at Hermione; he usually wasn’t the one that dealt with the feelingsy stuff. That was her.
“I also want you to know that if Mr. Weasley and Miss. Grager are true friends, they will accept you no matter what.”
“As 8th years you are of age, so you will have your own room with one other. You will be able to access your house's common rooms as well as the 8th year one. But the house dorms are off limits to you. So don't try anything or you might end up with tentacles.”
“Who’s Einstein?” Ginny asked.
When Harry entered the 8th year common room with a completed potions essay, he found Ron and Hermione waiting for him.
“Oh.” (Draco was blushing profusely.)
Malfoy clears his throat, “So, Potter. Grab those brooms over there. I'll get the rags.”
“Hey, instead of going to the library, let’s go to the Astronomy Tower!”
“Draco, how could you do that to *me*? Do you know how much I care about you? Even after only a month. You're a wonderful, amazing person, Draco. I need you. Of course I have Ron and Hermione, but you, you seem to understand me more than they do. If you had d-died,” Harry’s breath caught, and his voice softened, “I don’t know what I would have done.”
Dark thoughts started to rush into Draco’s head as much as he tried to keep them out.
“I had that under control, Potter. They were just some stupid 7th year trying to show your strength, they had literally no brains! You don’t always have to play the hero.” He spat.
Draco nodded. “Thank you, Potter. But I think I should at least check on her.”
Harry however, looked at the bushy haired girl, “But I don’t even know if Draco’s gay or bi or whatever.”
Draco hadn't even thought before speaking. Fuck. He’s made it sound sexual. Fuck fuck fuck fuck!
The group went through many topics: coffees, shoes, clothes, hair, Hogwarts Houses, people, but the thing that never seemed to go away for good were the sex mentions. But can you blame them? They’re eighteen year olds.
He let the snitch go, and activated the Quidditch boundary spell.
Draco blushed, “How much do you know?”
Harry looked up, Draco was waiting for him at the table. “Hey!” He greeted and slid into a chair next to the blonde.
Harry froze. “N-no.” He stuttered. “I said that it was beneficial being your partner. Cause you do all the work.” He was blushing Gryffindor scarlet.
Suddenly Harry got an idea. “What if it doesn’t have to be?” He said.
He takes a step closer to me. “Because we both know that you're terrible at it.”
“Attention! Attention students!”
Harry was walking down the rows of shelves looking for a certain Slytherin, when he was pulled into an alcove.
Narcissa cocked her head, her attention now on Harry and not Draco. “What I mean is, we’ve noticed patterns in when and where the Turners are being used. And your Manor could possibly be the next place.”
Ron was always excited for Christmas. Everything about it was fun. Harry agreed. Christmas was usually a time to celebrate, have fun, break out the champagne bottles. Everything was always perfect, except for this year. This year wasn’t as perfect; Draco wasn’t here.
“Ginny wanted me to tell you to meet her outside by the lake after breakfast.”
Malfoy looked unsure for a second. “Fine.”
Harry’s eyebrows shot up but he didn’t say anything.
“How’d what go?” Asks Hermione.
But Lauren just walked toward him, listing off reasons that he should date her.
‘Why would /Ginny/ want to meet /me/?’ He wondered as they opened the doors.
Soon there was a third extension to all of the common rooms for gender non conforming students.
Draco nodded. The after shock of finding out it was his dad doing all these things still hadn’t completely worn off. He walked over to his father. 'Wingardium Leviosa.’ “Let’s get this scum back to the Ministry.”
“Harry I did it!”
Stop.
He calmly locks the door and turns to face me, “Language Potter.”
It sounded like Draco was just restless. But Harry had a gut feeling that it was more than that. He pushed open the door. The sight that greeted him was a shock.
“I got home and started thinking about it, and I just got really mad. But not mad at them. Mad at myself because I shouldn’t have to apologize; I shouldn't have done any of that in the first place!”
“It’s the new, Zonky Stinko gas. It leaves a cloud of bad smelling gas floating over someone's head for hours! Sometimes it rains on them!”
“‘Cause my high hopes are getting low, because these people are so old. The way they think about it all, if I tried I would never know. My high hopes are getting low but I know I’ll never be alone.”
Now: back to your scheduled programming.
“Hey! You’re Harry Potter right?” She spoke with an American accent.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Come off it! You don’t need your mum all the time. I think you can take care of yourself. Besides I want to show you something!”
Draco looked up from the ground, “Hermione, you really are the brightest witch of your age. And I-I want to apologize for how I acted in school. I was a righteous git.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Of course.”
Draco sat down at the table. Molly brought the food and he had to admit. It was *amazing*.
Draco gave a sharp nod and shifted on the couch. He was nervous. His mother had always been important to him and if he lost her… Well he was just going to pray that that wouldn’t happen.
“Did you two make up?” Ron asked Harry as the group set out walking to Hogsmead. (A lot of the carriages were damaged in the war and the one that were left were reserved for the younger students.)
Harry shrugged, “Just a change in setting.”
How would Harry react to the news if Draco ever told him?
“Hey mate?” He asked.
“Well, I just don’t know who’s transphobic and who’s not.” Harry said defiantly, he wasn’t going to tolerate homophobic teachers as well as students. “That girl had a right to be treated as a human, and I was not about to stand by and let her be bullied by a bunch of brainless scumbags.”
I want to be free in the arms of a lover.
“The blush on your cheeks says otherwise.”
Granger, er- Hermione rolled her eyes. (If Harry and Draco were going to be friends then he needed to get to know Harry’s friends as well.) She sat down and patted the ground beside her. Draco reluctantly took his hand off the doorknob and joined her on the pavement.
Harry shrugged, “Well, there’s always time for that later. I forgave you a while ago anyway.” He offered a small smile and the Slytherin returned it.
“He’s been pining forever.” I supply.
Harry smirked at him, “‘So’ what?”
“What if there was magic there at one point? What if the person is trying to go really far back? 50 years or so. Because we know that magic fades over time. So maybe there was something there at some point?”
He hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione. Even back in fourth year when the problem first arose. At first he thought he was looking at Cho during the Yule Ball. But it could have been Cedric as well.
“Is that really how you think about me? That they're kissing my arse?” He asked through tears.
Draco looked around and saw a loo in the far corner. He looked in the mirror. His hair was an utter mess. He ran his fingers through it attempting to tame it. Then he remembered that he was a wizard.
I scowl at the blonde, who just smirks back at me.
Thanks for reading that train wreck!
“Draco! I’m so glad you're okay!” She exclaimed, springing up and wrapping her arms around the taller man.
“Because Potter! We need the full experiment to have a completed report!”
I wrap my arms around his neck and pull his head toward mine. And we kiss. It’s the most heartwarming thing. His lips are soft and his hands are warm as they brush through my hair. I want to memorize every part of him. I want to make sure I can still feel the warmth of his body against mine, even after my soul has moved on. I just want to stay here forever.
It was four years after the war and the entire Malfoy family had been pardoned; Minister Shacklebot had been kind. He even let Draco join the Auror Department with Harry. But that didn’t stop his mother from getting a divorce.
“Yeah, they’re like family now. And, I've told them that they can just call me Draco, but they still like the old titles.”
Before Draco could protest Harry had grabbed his hand and he was swirling through darkness. (What was the point of stopping it by now?)
“Well, thank you.”
‘“One pound of Flaming Salamander eggs?” Who needs that much spice?’ Harry thought. Hermione returned and they started their potion.
The trick was to match the voice with the same amount of strength. Draco’s control was starting to slip, luckily that is when Harry took the spell off.
She giggled and ran away, thanking him again. Harry smiled.
Harry’s eyebrows creased, “Yeah I’m okay. Why do ask?”
“How are you Draco?”
“Really? I thought you hated Death Eaters. If you have forgotten that I am one.”
“I’m fine.”
Malfoy looks taken aback, “You mean to say, that you were almost put in Slytherin?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron didn’t look reassured. Harry slugged him in the shoulder, “It’ll be fine! I promise!”
“No, sorry we didn’t know what you guys would want.”
“Password?” She squeaked.
Their feet slammed down on soft grass. And Draco sighed glad to be out of that bone chilling place.
“One night when the guards weren't around, an old friend came and offered to take my place. He had massive brews of Polyjuice Potion, so we simply swapped. He is a master at wandless so he shrunk all of his cauldrons down and took out clumps of my hair. The Dementors don’t know a thing. And the guards don’t like to hang around.”
“Alright…”
Draco’s eyebrow arched, “Are you asking me on a date.”
Ron looks up from across the table, “Can we please come back to this later? Breakfast!” He picks up a price of toast and starts to butter it.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed, “What spell damage?”
“Draco! Is it him, is it the boy? Are those his friends? The redhead and the mudblood? We have to be absolutely sure before we call the Dark Lord.”
Everyone nodded in agreement and George said, “Yeah, drop the posh talk will you?”
“I did nothing of the sort!”
“But right now’s not the time to talk. We need to catch this person!”
She got down on one knee in front of Ron and yelled a velvet case out of her pocket. “My question is: Ronald Weasley, will you marry me?”
Draco just stared.
“Mother…” Draco rasped, his throat was dry, but his eyes were wet.
The last thing Harry saw before he passed out was the worried expression on Malfoy’s face.
Harry hesitated before telling them, “Malfoy.”
Harry punched Ron, “No!”
The next morning Harry woke up bright and early. He turned to his already packed Hogwarts trunk and grimaced. He had to prove to Ron and Hermione that he could be a better friend. It hurt him to hear Hermione talk about him like that, but, if Harry was telling the truth… he could see where she was coming from.
I wrap my arms around his torso and hug him as tightly as I can. It’s almost as if I’m trying to squeeze all of the sadness out of him.
“Oh, I didn't notice.” Harry said sarcastically. “Also, before we go in there I have to tell you: Everyone is wearing their pajamas. Please don’t laugh. We’re all waiting for our Jumpers. Hence the reason I'm wearing this.” Harry waved a hand at his Quidditch pajamas, and blushed a little.
“Sorry.” I mumble, not looking up. I try to edge my way around the person, but thin pale fingers wrap around my wrist.
“C’mon Harry,” This time Ron spoke, “You know what we mean! How was the rest of your night with Malfoy?”
Then she pulled him into a hug. To Draco, this kind of touch was not something that happened often. But it felt good to know that someone cared about him.
“Malfoy!?” Hermione said, shocked.
He was able to get all of the stains out with his wand. He picked up the neglected memo, and opened it. It immediately jumped out of his hand and started to talk:
Harry looked like he was starting to catch on. “So, that means that the Time-Turners could go even further back! But how far does this person want to go?”
He raises an eyebrow. “Well, someone’s got a wand up his arse.”
Harry nodded, “It’s not like I’m going to ice out your whole family because Ginny and I ended things.”
Harry got up one morning to make breakfast only to find that Mrs. Weasley was already doing it. He asked if she needed help, but Mrs. Weasley just brushed him off and said she didn’t need any.
Harry watched as Joey grabbed his left arm, yanked him back and pulled up the sleeve.
“Hullo Harry!”
“Well,” Draco hesitated.
“I’m apologizing to a guy.”
Ron shrugged, “I guess. But mum doesn’t know that.”
‘I would also like to go back, sssssso iffff you’ll ecsssssussse me. I’ll be offffff.’
Harry pushed open the door. He was right, the Weasleys did look odd, all of them in their night clothes.
“Well his family deserves it.”
I once again think about going back to tell Ron and Hermione what I have to do, but I know it’ll hurt too much. They're better off knowing nothing. And Nevil will take care of Nigini if they can’t. I trust them, and I know they can defeat Voldemort on their own. They’ll have to.
Draco peared over the Gryffindor’s shoulder to see a text from Ron saying. ‘Are you ready to make an unbreakable vow?’
Draco choked on his drink. Ginny patted him on the back.
Harry plopped back down in his seat. Hermione reached over and patted his shoulder, “Harry, these are the Weasleys.”
Harry sighed and put the parchment back down on the bedside table, “Anything to distract me from this.”
Weasly’s head shot up and he glared at Draco.
He looked at her hesitantly, thinking she would be livid. But instead she had a thoughtful look on her face.
I will fight for you,
Harry waited with baited breath for his answer.
Harry nodded and held out his arm. Draco took it and soon they appeared outside of a small restaurant on the outskirts Hogsmead.
Like lovers do.”
Harry didn’t seem to notice though. He was already walking towards the strangely foreboding shack. He reached up and pushed open the creaking door.
He tried desperately to steady his breathing; darkness was clouding his vision. He lifted his wand, and whispered a spell.
He picked up a loose stone from the ground and did his best to Transfigure it into a stool. It ended up looking like a lumpy cushion.
Weasley turned around and spotted Draco. For the first time ever didn’t glare. Instead he rubbed the back of his neck and said, “Look Malfoy, Harry’s right. I’m sorry. I guess family feuds got in the way of my common sense. Let’s start over.”
“Oh, I'm sorry. Merlin forbid I try and strike up a conversation with the Chosen One.” Quinn says, sarcastically.
When it got to Lavender she started smirking. She turned to the girl beside her. “Parvati. Truth or Dare?”
“But with /Malfoy/, Harry. Are you forgetting who he /is/.”
“Yes. I suppose.”
Molly Weasley jumped up to hug Harry. George clapped him on the back and Arthur smiled.
Bellatrix throwing a knife.
The boggart slowly advanced on Harry, who calmly raised his wand and said, “Riduckulus.”
Draco nodded.
He climbed all the way to the top of the school. Harry passed Dumbledoor’s study and opened a large door a little ways down the corridor.
They were family.
Harry, suddenly realizing he was ravenous, ate all of it. He was just finishing off a raspberry pastry when he heard a loud pop.
“You know how to order muggle things?” Harry asked, impressed.
“Can I have the snitch?”
Quinn got sorted into Gryffindor. I expected them to room with us, but instead they were given their own extension to the Gryffindor Tower. Because they were non-binary. They inspired several other people to come out of the closet, including myself. I came out as bisexual
“So…” Harry took a deep breath, “I kind of have other plans for Christmas, so I’m not going to the Burrow.”
Fuck the world. Fuck marriage bonds. Draco wanted nothing more than to kiss the man sitting next to him. Right then and right there.
‘Stop.’ He told himself, ‘It’s all over. You’re not a prisoner here now, you’re here as a friend.’
“He’s up to something! I know it!”
Draco winked at Harry, which caused him to laugh through his tears.
“Harry, no you can’t!”
Voldemort raised his wand, “Crucio!”
Draco looked at him oddly, “Side along of course.”
But Ginny was already walking back to the castle.
“Guys!” Harry shouted, “I do nott have a crush on Draco!” But even as he said it he flushed bright red.
The question took Draco by surprise.
He had not screamed once. His mother would awake in the morning to see her son lying dead upon the floor. He did not regret not saying goodbye. It would have made doing this a whole lot harder.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh?”
Harry’s shout came from behind Lucius. His wand flew away from Draco’s neck. Harry threw the Hawthorn wand to Draco, and they both pointed the weapons at, the now disarmed, Lucius.
Luna’s voice seems to lose some of its airiness when she spoke, “Yes, and no.”
Harry walked away muttering, “Ron’s not doing that much studying.”
“Oh, sorry.”
“Yeah, Malfoy.” Harry said, still annoyed at the bushy haired girl from earlier, “‘Mione, you refused to help me, so I found someone who was good at potions /and/ willing to help.”
Harry gulped, he never thought that he’d be the one to plan something like this. “Well, it’s so dark and cold right now. What if we painted it with warmer colors?” He suggested, “We could take out all of the black furniture too, and replace it. Just to give this place a cozier look. Cause right now it’s all sharp edges. It’s basically saying, ‘I hate everything that isn’t black, fear me.’”
Potter, no, Harry nodded. “I think we should try and put some spells on it, just to see if it would work. We don’t know if the culprit tried to confuse the magic on it.”
‘Where are you from?’
Draco shook his head at Harry's stubbornness. “Potter, please just do it. The only way we’ll know for sure is if you test it. Please.” Draco was pleading by this point but he didn’t know why.
He had made a big announcement over dinner:
Draco woke to the feeling that someone was looking at him.
“Hey Draco?”
“You could have killed yourself! Merlin Potter! How do you think authorities would respond to Harry Potter dead on /my/ bathroom floor! What would I have done?”
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good.
…Harry’s P.O.V 3rd Person…
“But why would you want to apologize to him?!”
(See the end of the chapter for
As Ron continues to ramble my thoughts drift to a certain blonde Slytherin, who happens to be walking past me.
“I’m not going to stay up here forever. Just for a while.”
He was looking around for a certain Slytherin when a girl about his age came up to him.
He tried the doorknob but found the room to be locked. He cast a soft ‘Alohomora’ and he heard the lock click open. He pushed the door open.
He reached into his robe pocket and pulled out two wands. He handed one to Malfoy.
I nod. “The stone wall. My sh-shirt. The doorknob. Y-your arms.”
Draco and Harry circled around their yard, casting glances at each other and making sure that they would not be the first one to the snitch. Every time they played one of these Seeker games, their old school rivalry seemed to return. They would always taunt each other and tease each other. Maybe that’s what made the games more fun, and even more satisfying to win.
“Handsome yes, but cute? Absolutely not!”
“Uh, I don’t think so.”
“Who?”
Harry got dressed and sat down at the desk to start his Transfiguration homework. Unfortunately his brain wasn’t working and he was just staring at a blank piece of parchment.
It wasn’t long until Malfoy came back with a tray of food from the kitchens. Without a word he put it down in front of Harry and left the room.
“Draco! You're awake!” Hermione sounded relieved, “We were worried sick. What happened? Are you alright?”
He chews his bottom lip, “I was going to ask you… would you accept me if I came out?”
Draco nodded, “What curse is it?”
The next time around, Draco felt his feet hit hard stone. The sound of rushing waves immediately filled his ears. And he tasted salt in his mouth.
Those words mean everything to me. They represent the years we’ve had to keep it a secret in fear of anyone finding out.
“O-one thing you can taste.”
It’s only then when I notice that my panic attack stopped. And then his words really hit.
“Do I what?”
“I didn’t think so.”
He silently walked down the long hallway with his head down and his hands shoved in the pockets of his robes. When he reached Border’s office he paused and prepared himself for what was coming.
Malfoy reached out a hand, Harry reached out his. But he missed. Swiveling back around he saw a fiery tiger lunge for the tower. Then he saw Ron and Hermione swooping out with an unconscious Goyle on their broom. But Malfoy was still in there!
“I dunno,” he mumbles into the counter.
“Okay, then, if not potions, what?”
“Oh, er, they still don’t really trust me to be down here,” said Harry, rubbing the back of his neck. “After, you know. The, er, dragon and all that.”
“Nah, I…” He wants to make up something, that he had somewhere to be, someone to meet, but he can’t make himself do it. Harry’s eyes are so dark, his lips so pink, his face so open and painless. He looks so
Two weeks after Teddy’s birthday, they met for dinner. Draco picked the place—”I did all the work last time,” Harry teased—so they ate curry at a little place by the cafe. Harry poked fun at Draco begging the waiter for yogurt after just a bite of his dish, but gave up his water glass when Draco pouted.
“Sorry. Nothing, really. A few meetings, a case review.” Harry shrugs. “You?”

So they stand there, a little family in a little moment in the middle of the night.
Draco nodded. He had no idea how he was supposed to respond.
The next time, a few hours later, Draco washes Harry in the shower, fingers him delicate and sweet. Harry thinks he’s never been more vulnerable or turned on. He rides Draco on his bed, leisurely, reverently, and Draco presses hot kisses everywhere he can reach. Draco comes first, then spends a glorious eternity with his mouth on Harry’s hole. He wraps black, silky lace around Harry’s cock and strokes so,
Draco finds Harry standing in the kitchen in a pair of low-slung boxer briefs, stirring something. The kitchen smells like coffee—
, you were just so horrible I seemed spectacular.”
Harry doesn’t think about the way Malfoy’s fringe has grown out so it just barely brushes his sharp cheekbones, or the fact that Malfoy wears muggle trousers, shirts, and waistcoats every day. He certainly does not appreciate how said trousers, shirts, and waistcoats are immaculately tailored to Malfoy’s slim frame and make him look like— Well, Harry doesn’t know what Malfoy looks like, because he doesn’t think about it.
Their food arrives steaming hot. It is incredible; Harry hasn’t had anything this comforting since he left Hogwarts.
(He points to the center of the map.)
Draco kisses his cheek and opens the door.
?” Potter asked with a smirk that Draco wanted to wipe off his face.
He takes hold of Draco’s arse with one hand and waves his other over Draco’s shirt and waistcoat, which both disappear. Harry ignores Draco’s indignant huff and pulls his pelvis closer. He licks a long stripe up Draco’s lace-wrapped cock and doesn’t bother holding back his groan.
After an hour, or maybe several, Draco feels his stomach rumble and remembers his plans for takeout. Harry laughs at the sound and offers him the bowl of pretzels.
Warily, Harry does as he’s told. “Have you ordered?”
Harry felt the tears on his face now, wiped them away with his sleeve, and tried to catch his breath.
But it didn’t come. Harry pushed a few stacks of parchment aside and sat next to him. He was quiet, just there, so close Draco could almost feel their shoulders touching.
“Do I stress you out?” Malfoy’s face has become unreadable, that careful blank slate he pulls when he’s guarding his feelings.
Harry elbowed him. “Fernando, this is Draco. We’re actually here for dinner. Maybe a couple of al pastor, some elotes, er--” He looked at Draco. “Not so spicy on the pastor?”
Draco laughed. “We’re stargazing, Potter.”
The next day was typical for them. They took breakfast in the dining room, socialized with the other resort guests, and split up for reconnaissance (still nothing to note). They ate lunch in the gardens with Mary and Barry, the older couple who had quasi-adopted them, then spent the afternoon at the hot springs, semi-interviewing the few guests they hadn’t interacted with yet.
“Good boy, baby,” Charlie murmured, pulling one arse cheek to the side. “I’m gonna open you up now, that okay?”
Draco choked on his lemonade, coughing unglamorously into his elbow. When he could breathe again, he said, “Coffee?”
“Oh.” Draco wasn’t sure how to respond. “I suppose so, yes.”
Of course, Potter could get in anywhere. He had probably called that morning and asked for their best table. Draco felt a sneer coming and reminded himself that he had agreed to a date--one date--with Potter. Against his better judgement.
A beat, and then: “Open.”
He stops on his way to the Ministry for tea and breakfast—he’s not going to make the same mistake as yesterday—and he’s a little relieved that Nguyen is waiting for him at the apparition point to yap about something. He even does his best to listen to what she’s saying.
“Hmm. I

Katelyn rolled her eyes. Draco peered into the paper towel dispenser’s reflective surface to comb his fingers through his hair. He didn’t know why he bothered; it was 2:03 and Potter wasn’t coming.
Draco didn’t know what to say. He took a long drink to hide his blush.
Charlie reached out his hand, but Draco ignored it and kissed Charlie’s cheeks. “We’re friends now,” he said.
From there, they progressed to saying, “Hello,” “Good morning,” and “Alright?” Some mornings, Harry even stopped for a quick chat. A few times, he asked if Malfoy wanted a cup of tea, and once Malfoy had.
Harry feels dizzy with desire. “Keep them on and come here.”
An older woman brought their food to them on paper plates, and Harry motioned to a side door, grabbing a little glass bottle of red sauce on their way out the door.
Draco turns back, half-laughing. “Wha—?”
Harry, to his credit, seemed to understand the delicacy of the topic, whether or not he knew why it was touchy. “You tell good stories. You’re a good storyteller.” He paused. “Do you still support the Tornadoes?”
Draco apparated to the field a little before 11. He spread out a quilt, charmed the wine glasses not to spill, and threw up some basic anti-insect shields.
Draco’s heart might burst.
“Like you,” Draco said, softly.
Harry’s face hurts from smiling by the time he’s back in his office.
Malfoy smirks. “I contain multitudes, Potter. It is possible, you see, to enjoy pub fare
And now he doesn’t even have tea.
Draco wrinkled his nose at him. “Gross, Potter. Go shower.”
- - - - -
Draco arches his stupid, posh, beautiful eyebrow. “Oh?”
And then Harry’s hand is stroking Draco’s cock through the lace and Harry wonders if you can die from happiness. It’s better than he imagined, all those nights in bed and mornings in the shower. Draco is thick, the tip leaking through the fabric, and Harry
Draco huffs. “Late would have been a few minutes. I should have just gone home.”
It’s late, later than Ron and Harry have been out drinking in years. Harry knows Ron wants to go home to Hermione and the kids, but the very last thing he wants is to go home and rattle around Grimmauld Place.
It’s a Wednesday morning, and Harry already knows the day will be off, because he is waylaid by notoriously chatty Polly Nguyen on his way to the lift and then has three new Very Urgent case files on his desk. By the time he has assigned investigators and liaisons to each of them, it is 11:15, and his head is throbbing from the lack of caffeine.
And Harry badly, badly wants to see the lace again. He wants to ask about it. He wants to feel it.
“It’s fine. Are you burnt?” Harry asks, laser focused on not looking at Malfoy sitting at his desk four feet away.
More fluff.
Malfoy snorts at him but dutifully takes a bite. He closes the file folders spread across his desk and waves them away. “So we’re doing this now?”
“Mm, sounds like it. Well, I’ve got to get back to this. See you.” Malfoy shrugs and resumes shifting through the folders scattered on the table.
He looks beautiful.
Draco started work at a magi-vet clinic in Camden just after they moved, while Harry coached Little League Quidditch and taught flying lessons in Wales. Harry left each morning via floo, but Draco started taking Muggle transportation; he was fascinated by the mechanics of motor vehicles. They bought a car when Draco finished his final year of internship and became fully licensed as a magi-veterinarian—“A proper animal healer ought to travel in style,” Harry told him—and Draco delighted in driving his new olive-green Jaguar around the countryside. They spent innumerable weekends staying at inns wherever they ended up, which was frequently in the Fens. Draco loved the landscape there, wild and strange, and Harry loved exploring it with him.
Scorpius makes a little sound against the bottle.
Malfoy tentatively picks up the fork and pokes at his food. “But why—?”
It’s their third anniversary, which means this is the third time Harry is late to their anniversary dinner. He was so determined to leave early this year, to be at the restaurant first even, maybe. And now it’s 8:17 and he was supposed to be there by 7:30 and he’s doubtless got four hundred years left on this short train ride.
Thus began Draco’s weekly ritual of Thursday dinner at Andromeda’s cottage. With time, Teddy began to recognize him, and once, his hair flashed the same platinum blond as Draco’s before reverting to its usual jet black. Andromeda quietly told Draco that it meant Teddy liked him. Draco took a liking to Teddy as well; his energy was only paralleled by his exhaustion after hours of running about. After a particularly vigorous toddler broom racing match, Teddy collapsed in Draco’s lap, sucking his fingers until he fell asleep. Draco was utterly charmed by his sweet, sleepy face, and found himself staying longer so he wouldn’t have to disturb him.
Harry drops his bag in his office, rolls his eyes at a memo someone has charmed to sparkle annoyingly, and makes his way for tea. His stomach barely flips when he sees Malfoy is at his desk, face scrunched in concentration as he writes furiously. Harry makes a plan: He’ll wave if Malfoy looks up, he’ll say hello if Malfoy does. That’s all.
Harry is there, just in his boxers, swaying gently. Against his chest, a bundled up Scorpius is staring up at him with wide, reverent eyes. A bottle is wedged between Harry’s chin and Scorpius’s mouth. Harry uses his free hand to direct cheese into the pan on the stove.

,” said Deacon behind him.
“Have I been recruiting troops for the next dark lord, do you mean?”
Their hands stay clasped all the way to the restaurant.
Harry comes out of the bathroom, still naked, and catches him trying to fix his hair. “I like your new look. You should keep it.”
He took hold of Harry’s cock, stroking in time with his thrusts, and Harry sucked bites into his neck and chest. He was barely holding on, speeding up against his will, when Harry came in his hand with a cry. And then it was all too much—Harry’s stomach splattered with his own come, his mouth wide with lust, his sounds echoing around Draco’s head—and he buried himself in Harry and came harder than he could remember.
“Don’t stereotype me, Potter,” Draco said with a chuckle. “Just because I grew up in a dungeon—”
“We work together. What about you?”
Harry wonders how much sexual frustration one can endure before one’s body combusts. He feels like he is close to that limit.
A few days later, they got falafel from a muggle food cart near Harry’s house, then walked around to see the historical buildings in Islington. Draco talked about some of his favorite customers, and Harry asked how long he’d worked at the cafe. Draco, hackles up, tersely said, “A little over a year,” and didn’t elaborate.
“You don’t have a drink,” Harry points out.
“Oh.” Potter furrowed his brow. “You— Wait, working?”
He pulled halfway out, then thrust in slowly. “Okay?” he breathed, and Harry nodded, pulling him closer.
Harry freezes. Draco backs off with a, “Shit.”
“—can’t even tell person files from place! Next it’ll be, what, alphabetical by average temperature in June?” Malfoy heaves a heavy sigh. “I like the cheese. And it’s called paneer.”
- fuck - !”
“That alright?” Harry murmurs, pausing until Draco whispers, “Yeah,
“You should take something off, too, Harry,” said Charlie, nodding at Harry’s tented denims.
After a second’s hesitation (during which Harry questioned every decision he’d ever made), Malfoy kissed him in return, pulling him in by his shoulders. Harry wrapped an arm around Malfoy’s waist. Maybe there would be no nightmares tonight.
(shouting)
He wants Malfoy to
Harry knows it’s an act. He learned a long time ago that unaffected air is Draco’s first line of defense. “Love,” he says, bending down to kiss Draco’s temple, “I missed you. I’m sorry I’m late.”

Next came the bowtruckle, Firbramble. He was wild and an adult, but he’d somehow broken an arm, and subsequently his family had rejected him; Draco explained this as he set up a habitat in the dining room, Firbramble waiting patiently on a branch on the table. Once he was healed, Draco said, he could move on to a sanctuary.
There is silence, and Harry can feel Hermione rolling her eyes through the phone. “I am sure that Malfoy spills tea; actually, I remember seeing him do it once at Hogwarts.”
Heart beating rapidly, Harry grabs his wand from the side table and pads into the hallway. Scorp’s room is empty, as is the office. Neither room looks disturbed. Peering down the hall, Harry sees the light is on in the living room. He takes a deep breath and, wand first, opens the door.
HARRY
Harry nearly collapses. “Malfoy!” he yelps, unnecessarily loudly.
“I’m fine,” says Harry, too quickly. “What are you doing here?”
Potter must have sensed Draco’s bristling, because he didn’t ask. “What are you studying? Potions?”
Harry doesn’t know why he knows that.
Harry pulled his shirt off and began unbuttoning his flies. Draco knocked away Harry’s hands. “Let me help,” he said. His thin fingers carefully opened the buttons, slowly revealing Harry’s dark curls, until at last Draco pulled Harry’s fat cock free. He licked his lips.
“And what if I’m okay with it?”
Draco nodded. “Yeah. Yes. Definitely.” He circled his fingers at the base of his cock and took a deep breath. “God, I haven’t been like this in a long time.”
“You gonna come for us, baby boy?” Harry asked, moving his encircled fingers along Draco’s shaft.
“God, you’re beautiful,” Draco muttered.
While they wait, Malfoy points out the canvases and talks about the artists who painted them. The one Harry likes most is by a young artist Draco seems to admire, judging by the way his eyes go soft when he talks about the brushstrokes. Harry considers buying it, but wonders if that would be too awkward. He decides against it.
Charlie groaned. “Yeah? You like lots of big cocks filling you up?”
,” Draco replied. He leaned back against Harry’s abdomen and Harry ran his palms down Draco’s chest. Charlie held Draco’s hips in place and thrust up a little. Draco closed his eyes.
*****
Draco can hardly breathe for love.
Teddy spotted him and screeched, “Draco!” Draco felt his heart swell in his chest and gave Teddy a peck on the top of his head. There was an open spot next to Teddy, and feeling brave, Draco sat down, not daring to look up at the others gathered around him. He was sure they were glaring at him, talking about him under their breath—but Teddy wanted him there, and it was Teddy’s party.
“Back to Potter, are we?”
“She’s a charmer,” Harry answers. He turns to face Malfoy, who has tucked his shirt back into its place and looks proper as ever. Harry thinks of the lace; he recalls the thoughts he had moments ago. A flush creeps up his cheeks.
Draco allows himself a moment to stretch his shoulders in the foggy heat of Harry’s bathroom before he opens the door. The room has grown lighter in his absence, but Harry is missing from his bed. Draco takes a moment to appreciate that Harry kicked the covers from his side of the bed sometime before dawn; he wonders if Harry does that every night. Smiling to himself, he hopes he’ll spend enough nights with Harry to find out.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled, embarrassed. “Silencing spell works great.”
When he climbed into bed, he laid for a few moments in the dark just staring at the ceiling, listening to Malfoy putting on his ridiculous constellation pajamas and brushing his teeth. Malfoy laid down next to him, finally quiet, but Harry could tell he was awake too.
“Yeah, just me. Go back to sleep, love.”
after an afternoon at the farmer’s market and an indulgent dinner of peaches and fresh cheese.
“No sir, not burnt—well, maybe, erm—yeah I do think—”
Harry had carefully prepared the tea and Malfoy had thanked him politely.
Harry grinned. “Love you too, sweetheart.” He traipsed to their bedroom and once again silently thanked Draco for insisting on a ridiculously luxurious shower during their house hunting. One quick but very hot shower and a soft set of pajamas later, Harry made his way back to the sitting room and peered at the bubble in his husband’s lap.
Standing in the doorway, white as a ghost, is Polly Nguyen. Her eyes are fixed on Harry’s. He can’t look away from her, very conscious of the amount of spit that’s accumulated around his mouth.
(The troll shakes him; he grunts)
Draco is flushed, lips parted, and he looks beautiful. He gets a knee between Harry’s thighs before Harry pulls him down. He can feel that Draco is already hard against him. Draco grabs Harry’s wrist, kisses the thin skin over his veins, nips his way to Harry’s elbow.
DRACO and HARRY stand looking at a map hovering between them.
“I think it fits her.”
Charlie looked at Harry, kept their eyes locked as he lined up the tip of his cock with Draco’s pink hole. Harry reached down and gripped his cock, feeling as though he might come just at the sight of Draco pressing back against Charlie, so desperate for his cock. Charlie ran his hands over Draco’s back, over the lace, and then gripped Draco’s slim hips as he finally pushed in.
coffee, Draco notes—and he gives himself just a moment to imagine having this every morning. Harry, barely moving his hips to the soft music he’s got on, the dimples on his lower back on display, his lovely hair still pillow-squashed on one side…
“God, baby, you’re so good,” Harry murmured against Draco’s ear. Draco leaned his head back against Charlie’s shoulder and Charlie slowly worked his rough hand over him. “You want to show Charlie your pretty arse?”
“Yeah, right,” he mumbles to himself. Well, if he can’t think normally about Malfoy, he can at least act sane.
Yesterday’s jeans are still folded over the cushy chair in the corner. Draco pulls them on and eyes himself in the mirror. He’s still flushed from the shower and his hair needs a good brushing charm, but he likes the look of Harry’s big sweater over his thin frame and decides, secretly, to keep it.
Draco leans forward and braces his hands against the arm of the couch. “
He breathes. In, out. He’s got to shake this—it’s not sustainable. He’s Head Auror, for Merlin’s sake. Harry needs his focus for cases, for supervising the Aurors, for meetings with the Minister, for testifying in front of the Wizengamot.
. But you’ve still got your reservation, haven’t you?”
“Thank you,” said Harry, so low he could hardly hear himself.
This was certainly not
“And the tea was everywhere, and this clerk was probably fourteen, and Malfoy just sat there and
“In a year, yeah.”
—got a little while.”
He snaps and the paper folds into a little crane—another souvenir from his Hogwarts days. The crane flies out under his office door.
“You’re so tight, baby. You feel so good around my cock,” Charlie said softly, rubbing circles on Draco’s hips with his thumbs. Draco hummed and pushed back further, another inch inside. Charlie pulled back and then slowly forward, then shifted lower on his knees. He pulled almost all the way out, then delivered a quick, short thrust, and Draco cried out. “Is that it, baby? Is that good?” He did it again, and Draco sobbed.
Harry nodded. “You were perfect, baby.” He pulled Draco to him, against his chest, and stroked his hair, his back, his arms. Charlie wrapped around them both, so warm against Draco’s back. He kissed the nape of Draco’s neck softly.
Teddy banged his spoon on the cabinet. “Cake! My cake!” The spoon bounced off the cabinet and whacked Teddy’s forehead. He sat stunned for a moment, looked up at Draco, and started wailing.
“No,” Draco, Greg, and Harry say vehemently, in unison.
“You saw it on your way in? Burton—the pawnbroker—lives across the street from that shop. Said the Aurors smashed their way in at three in the morning.”
And Draco’s right about getting more sleep. Harry sits up to pull the duvet over them, stopping for one more lingering kiss before he lies back down.
lovely today,” Luna replies, watching Harry slip out of his shoes. “I didn’t know you knew the way. Ginny always uses the Floo.”
“You were back in your human form when I found you. You must have transformed when…”
“No! That I kissed someone who’s married. And who I thought was straight,” Harry says, his voice rising a bit.
“Malfoy,” Draco says in response to her questioning look in his direction.
Draco Malfoy.
“It does, doesn’t it?”
Harry glances over his shoulder. With one long stride, he steps into the sitting room, making way for someone to come through the doorway behind him—someone so familiar, yet so distant within Draco’s memory as to make her seem like a ghost.
I watched him shuffle the cards nimbly, then deal them out again. “Wouldn’t you rather live close to a village? You could walk to the shops instead of Apparating all the way across Yorkshire, and there’d be people to—”
. I mean, I think we only just realised that we don’t dislike each other a week ago.”
, is Draco’s first thought, as he’s standing dumbstruck and staring. His second thought, or rather sensation, is a cold trickle of fear. He’s learned in the past two years that the weeks around the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts are a dangerous time for an ex-Death Eater. The Aurors assigned to Knockturn give him murderous looks, and Draco is shaken and a bit paranoid about leaving his flat for days after those encounters.
“Draco,” Harry says quietly. “That’s not Ron’s decision any more than it is mine. The department heads are the ones calling the shots. They order the raids and the patrols.”
“Yeah, well if it’s about Quidditch, that’s something I can probably help with.” He rests his hand on Draco’s wrist, leaving it this time. “Draco’s the real teacher here.”
be refreshing, but the calculating look he throws at Harry betrays him. Harry fully expects to get a jet to the face if they go forward with the plan.
Malfoy didn’t hold his mother’s conviction against Harry. On the contrary, his attitude towards Harry when they returned to Hogwarts was a kind of solemn civility. Malfoy seemed determined to move forward, resisting the pull of the anguish that Harry could easily detect beneath his mask of composure. Harry felt compelled to acknowledge him, and then tentatively engage in some safe small talk as the school term went on. Lately, they’ve progressed to teasing each other in a way that Harry finds surprisingly enjoyable.
Harry looked in the mirror on his way out to meet his friends, giving his hair one last check. Maybe he’d meet someone new tonight. He winked at his reflection before leaving his newly-renovated bedroom.
that had been their most intense kiss yet. Draco feels his cheeks warm, despite the icy draft from the window, when he remembers the desperate way they touched each other. He wonders what would have happened, how far they would have gone, if they hadn’t heard voices at the bottom of the stairs and fled to their respective rooms. He wonders if Potter pushed his hand into the front of his trousers as soon as he was alone, like Draco had.
“He’s home sick. I doubt he’ll be back this week,” Draco replies. He’s relieved that his voice is reasonably steady. “Is it something I can help with?”
were enough to shake the foundations of Draco’s world. He didn’t even register the reaction of their classmates, he was so lost in the feel and taste of Potter’s mouth.
“Mine,” Draco agrees.
“We’ll see. I’m content to remain an anonymous contributor.”
I murmured an apology, and the rest of the meal passed in complete silence. Potter kept his eyes on his plate while he bolted his food, then sprawled in the armchair with his eyes closed after he was done.
“What did she say?” Draco demanded. Harry asked him to take the snake back, which Draco did deftly and lowered her into the tank. Then he set the pole against the wall and turned to face Harry, his arms crossed over his chest.
Potter brought meat to the Thestrals now that their usual prey was holed up in burrows and tree hollows. He didn’t tell me where he got the meat, but I suspected it was from a magical establishment because I caught him removing a Glamour on his way back to the house once. I didn’t ask what kind of animal the meat came from, either. One look at it told me that it wasn’t fit for human consumption.
“I thought you said that people in Knockturn wouldn’t accept the Ministry’s help. What are they supposed to do, if people here don’t trust them?”
me?” Malfoy looks a bit stunned.
?” he shouts.
He lifted a hand towards my face and I stumbled back with a sound of disgust.
“I’m also a marked Death Eater,” Draco points out, then holds up his hand when he sees Harry about to object. “No, please don’t try to qualify that, or excuse it because of my age at the time. I wouldn’t want you or anyone else to defend my actions.”
“No, an entire house full of antiques that Ernie Macmillan’s great aunt left behind when she passed away. She spent her final years putting curses on half her collection, apparently. Give Molly my regrets, will you?”
“All right, I’ll let him know that we’ll be done on Tuesday.”
On the last full day of lockdown, heavy rain keeps them all indoors. Andromeda is laid low with a bad migraine, so Malfoy offers to forego studying for the day and help Harry keep Teddy busy. It’s exhausting and a little bittersweet. Harry knows he’s going to miss spending so much time with his godson.
“I should hope not.”
“Fine.” I rose from the chair to go upstairs, then was halted by a sudden thought halfway to the stairs. “We’d both fit, you know. It’s a double bed.”
“I have feathers,
had to be the one I wanted. The same person who was always knocking me off kilter every time I thought I found my footing.”
“You can owl me if you need me to come back and try again,” Harry offered. “I don’t mind. She’s a nice snake. Great personality.”
Draco stares at him in stunned silence for a moment. Harry raises his chin and stares right back.
“Well, it wasn’t the time to do it, was it? I couldn’t very well march over to you in the Great Hall and announce it,” Draco says, struggling to stay calm. “Could you please sit back down?”
Harry crawls into one of the tents while Draco’s in the house using the loo. It’s just wide enough for two people. Harry reminds himself that he slept that close to Hermione and Ron plenty of times when they were on the run. It wasn’t a big deal then; in fact, it was comforting to hear their soft breathing and have them nearby when he woke in the middle of the night. Harry pulls his sleeping bag and pillow from his rucksack and lays them out on the floor of the tent, upon which he cast as strong a Cushioning Charm as he could manage. Then he hastily changes into some joggers and a t-shirt before Draco returns.
I had more questions about that, but he was so tetchy when asked anything about himself, I didn’t dare.
“Have a long soak in the bath when you get home. That’s what we did last night.
“No, I need to wait a few hours. It’s better if she doesn’t associate handling with food,” Draco explained. “Not that she could really hurt me, but I’d rather avoid any accidents.”
up, you know?”
“Murder,” Harry says. “Cold blooded, premeditated murder. Not in self-defence or in a fair duel. The act of killing tears one’s soul. Damages it irreparably. As you know,
“All right, I’m ready,” Draco says after arranging his bedding. “You can put out the light now.”
Draco knows what Harry’s going to ask as soon as they Floo back to his flat—he kept catching Draco’s eye with a hopeful expression for the rest of their time at Susannah and Jerome’s. Despite the distraction, Draco managed to keep his attention on their hosts, especially Naia. He’s delighted to spend time with her again.
He looked up at me, his face softening into a thoughtful expression.
I was almost relieved when I began to feel drowsy. I transformed again and welcomed the oblivion of sleep.
“I’m glad,” Harry says, then rushes on when Draco’s eyes narrow. “Not because your dad’s mad at you. I’m glad you found a way to do what you want. The thing you’re passionate about. You should be able to choose what makes you happy.”
, as Hermione said.
He shifted his grasp around me and kissed me so fiercely that I made a muffled cry of surprise. I tilted my head to better align our mouths, and I kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him.
The day is overcast but bright when Harry arrives in the clearing. Someone cast a mowing charm on the grass of the clearing, which makes their camp look smart and tidy, like a kid on the first day of the school term. The white, yellow, and pale blue linen fabric that Luna chose for the tent twitches in the light breeze. She and Parkinson charmed the entire structure to repel wind, rain, lightning, and Glumbumbles.
“Chocolate biscuits,” Draco answers. He knows Harry’s fond of them, and he can bring them for pudding tonight. “Thank you.”
The places in the story were inspired by real ones in Dartmoor National Park, including the River Dart, Buckland Beacon, the Sittaford stone circle, Wistman’s Wood, and Blackadon Nature Reserve. Check out
Draco’s looking at him thoughtfully. “And Magical Games and Sports was hiring.”
“I’d like to find another student or two, if you know anyone looking for a tutor. There must be children who are too old for the new school who’d like to have some lessons.”
Harry’s about to step out the front door, which Timpsy’s holding open for him, when he slides his hands into his jacket pockets and finds the box. Draco has just disappeared through a doorway down the corridor, speaking softly to Scorpius.
“Yes! But I didn’t find that,”  Potter says defensively. “I was looking for uses in medical potions. I didn’t consider… household ones.”
and finally did away with the miserable place.
Harry wasn’t able to do that, despite haranguing Draco through the Floo about Cushioning and Warming Charms for twenty minutes. What did the trick was invoking Luna’s disappointment if he didn’t agree. It was a dirty trick—Draco told him so—but it was worth it to see her excitement when Harry told her he’d succeeded.
“Let’s see it, Draco,” Luna says, sitting beside him on the bench.
After that, neither of them hesitate to seize an opportunity when it comes.
“She said I’d be an idiot if I let you get away, and she’s been trying to push me into the Floo for the past two days.”
They work quickly in the stifling attic to dust off and shrink the doors, one by one, and stack them in a box that Luna provided. There are nearly twenty of them, some plain, some with ornately carved panels. Harry’s not sure why they were kept, but he’s glad to have them now.
When the last dry plate has been returned to the cupboard and they’re standing in the light of Harry’s wand, Malfoy goes silent for a moment. He doesn’t usher Harry towards the door, as he usually does. Instead, he reaches up to tuck his fringe behind his ear and, haltingly, offers Harry tea.
Greg grabs Draco by the arm. “Wait, we have to cross to the other side.”
“Yes, well, thankfully nothing happened while we were there, but I was worried about it the entire time, I admit.”
. He didn’t even bring anything to read, other than his curse breaking books, and he already knows that the next nine hours are going to drag on if he doesn’t find something to do.
“The herds at Hogwarts had become so numerous that they were fighting over territory, sometimes brutally,” Potter explained. “After I bought this land, I got permission to bring a herd here as long as I convinced them to stay within my wards. Otherwise, I’d have to keep them Disillusioned to keep them out of sight of Muggles.”
“I can’t say I’m looking forward to it, but perhaps it is better to get it over with,” Draco says, tilting his head back against the sofa. He chuckles at a sudden thought. “Good grief. Harry Potter, a Knockturn rat. I think we can safely say that everyone will be baffled. Are you prepared for the speculation and suspicion? It’s going to take some time for people there to accept you. They’re wary of outsiders, you know, especially someone with a connection to the Ministry.”
“It is, but I’d like our home together to be
you’ve known?” He stands up and runs his hands through his hair. “Why didn’t you just tell me?”
“I care if they’re your friends and family.” Draco feels Harry tense, but he presses on. “I know some of them—or maybe most of them—aren’t happy that I’m your soulmate. And I can tell that you’re trying to shield me by not talking about it. It can’t be pleasant for you, so I’d rather not make it harder. I’d rather be above reproach.”
It would be easy to forget everything here, he thinks after a few beers and twenty minutes of chatting up a cute bloke in tight jeans. To throw himself into this maelstrom of people and alcohol and noise and never look back.
. He looks more serious now as he studies Harry.
Malfoy lifts his chin with a faint smile. “Thank you.”
“Thank you for dinner. It was excellent.”
Luna leads the way. They walk single-file to the river’s edge, where the clear water flows over the dark stones of the riverbed and around larger boulders covered with moss and lichens. Some of the trees near the water’s edge have had the soil washed out from around their roots, causing them to lean over the water precariously.
is already out of Harry’s mouth.
“They’re sending me home in a couple of hours, but you should feel free to send me flowers anyway,” Pansy quips, making Luna laugh.
“Oh. Well, I was thinking about what you said the other day, about not being able to make your way in the world. And I was wondering…”
“I’ve heard you say you
“Can I get you a drink to warm you up, Andi?” Harry asks, ignoring the startled expression that Draco knows he must be wearing at the prospect of being left to fend for himself.
As it turns out, Harry sleeps through both Malfoy’s return to the room and his departure in the morning. The only signs that he was there at all are the absence of his piles of belongings and a note left on the top of the chest of drawers beside Harry’s bed.
Without talking about it, it seems they’ve both decided not to start anything in the guest room at night. A bit of kissing on the sly is one thing. It’s harmless fun, right? Doing more than that would open up a jar of snakes that Harry’s not ready to deal with. Malfoy’s a git. An attractive git who’s a talented kisser, granted, but Harry has no idea what Malfoy’s going to do after lockdown ends.
“Because I’ve been making you dinner. And because you’re the reason I burnt the chicken and ham pie last week.”

“It’s going to be wonderful, I’m sure,” Luna says. “Please tell me if I can help in any way.”

“Listen, you pillock, only our clothes are stuck to the chair, not us. If you
“I just might keep coming back, if you’re not careful.”
Draco tells himself. If he can’t overcome whatever keeps pulling him towards Potter—teenage lust or years-long obsession, he’s not even certain what name to give it—how can he trust himself to make the right decisions in the future?
Draco stretches out on his stomach and pushes his face into the blanket, relishing the roughness against his cheek. It would be a cruel twist of fate if he lost Harry now. It’s almost unthinkable that they should come so close, should overcome not only their childhood animosity, but the sheer improbability that their lives would intersect after Draco’s release from Azkaban, only to be thwarted just as the threads of their fates were pulling them together.
Apparently Malfoy keeps a supply of candles. And a small candelabra to put them in. The light cocoons them in the alcove, leaving the rest of the flat in shadows.
“I think this lockdown situation has addled our brains. The stress. The uncertainty. The constant fear of stepping on a small, pointy toy left on the carpet. It’s obviously affecting our judgement.”
Harry gives a sharp laugh. “It would certainly be more exciting than running down money launderers and Niffler smugglers. And I can’t dodge the more dangerous assignments, you know. It’s part of the job.”
Malfoy shakes his head in disapproval and leads the way to an alcove with a round wooden table and four heavy-looking chairs. Neither of them comment on the fact that there are already two place settings on the table as they take their seats.
Harry instinctively wraps his arm around Draco’s waist, both to keep his balance and to keep them pressed together. He tilts his head and opens his mouth slightly, allowing Draco to kiss him deeply, and it’s as if his entire body
“I don’t think he’s up to anything!” Harry protests. It’s hard to imagine Malfoy concocting a scheme that required both manual labour and choking down Luna’s cooking. When he compares that to what Lucius would likely do in Draco’s place, Harry’s more certain than ever that Luna’s trust is not misplaced.
“Oh, okay.” She looks up at him with an uncertain expression, then throws her arms around his waist to hug him. “I guess I’ll send you an owl. And you’ll write back to me?”
That’s the last straw. Seeing Malfoy standing there in his pyjamas, waving his arms around in front of a pile of loo roll, is too much for Harry’s composure. He falls back onto his pillow and laughs until his stomach hurts and there are tears in his eyes.
“And when you tell your friends? And the Weasleys? They’re going to be furious. And when they’re done shouting at you, they’re probably going to come and hex me.”
“Ron and Hermione asked me to have lunch with them today, but I told them I already had plans with you,” Harry begins.
After Mary closes the door behind her, Harry walks to the ladder and climbs just far enough to poke his head through the opening in the ceiling. Then he casts a
“No,” Harry says and does what any rakish love interest would do: he kisses him.
“Okay,” Harry says, and steps into the bathroom before he has to endure seeing Draco getting into bed. He’s afraid he might lose his nerve and end up sleeping on the sitting room floor after all, if he does.
Harry catches Draco’s eye and grins widely.
Draco begins taking his clothes from the wardrobe and folds them into neat stacks using a charm he hasn’t cast since Hogwarts. While he packs, Harry goes to the window and cups his hand against the glass in order to look at the street below. The bottom edge of the roof blocks the view, Draco knows from years of living here, and Harry soon turns back.
He acknowledges Potter’s presence with a quick glance before turning back to the window.
Ginny huffs impatiently. “I know Mum and Dad are still dragging their feet on meeting you, but the rest of us are fine with it. We’ve all been leaning on them for months to have you over on a Sunday, you know.”
attic. At least he thought of it that way. Ginny never loved any part of the house, and she didn’t live here long enough even to grow fond of it.
, Draco thinks.
“Oh,” Pansy says, flustered. “I suppose he’s quite tolerable, too. A very lovely dancer, in fact. Maybe even better than Draco.”
“Fine. Please try not to do it again. And don’t try to
“Wait, I want to take the food. I know you have plenty, but I can’t let it go to waste.”
But tomorrow… Harry promises himself that tomorrow he won’t be letting go of Draco. He’s going to find a way to hold onto him. For the first time in almost a year, Harry feels his fighting spirit come back.
Harry frowns. “No, not really.”
Now, seeing him totally engaged with Anastasia, Harry felt his chest tighten. Malfoy was totally unguarded. The only time Harry had seen him even close to this vulnerable was the singular occasion Harry had seen him overindulge in the firewhiskey at Luna’s going away party.
Draco himself doesn’t say anything. He traces one finger along the curve of the dragon. He nods, almost as if to himself. Then he unclasps the necklace and puts it around his neck. The dragon falls, as Harry hoped, just beneath the dip of Draco’s collarbones.
“Hello.” Draco doesn’t know what to do with his hands. He folds them awkwardly in his lap, but he feels like a schoolboy, so he shoves them into his pockets instead. He wishes he had something to hold onto.
“Well, you are quite thick, Potter,” Draco said without thinking. He bit his tongue. “It’s alright, though.”
Potter cleared his throat. “Would you, er… Would you want to get a coffee sometime? With me?”
Harry stops chewing the bit of banana in his mouth. His brain, usually clunky but fully functional, comes to a screeching halt. His thoughts are suddenly replaced with:
“Somewhere to be?”
It was Potter’s turn to shrug. “How’s your life been? What have you been up to?”
Harry raises his eyebrows. “You get it from the cafeteria at least once a week. I assumed you liked it, but I guess I could see you just torturing yourself with it.” He takes another bite and prays Malfoy never asks why Harry knows what he eats for lunch.
Draco does that thing again where he looks at Harry like he’s figuring out an arithmancy problem. “I asked what you’re doing today.”
,” he whisper-sings. “Daddy forgot to eat dinner, but that’s alright, eh? We’ll just have a little midnight snack together, then off to bed with the both of us.”
- - - - -
Harry smirks. “It’s just weed. Do you smoke?”
It’s all so disarming; Harry seems totally at ease. Draco barely knows anyone here and this couch is so soft and the bass from the other room is dampened by the walls just enough that he still feels it in his chest but it feels good. So without much thought, without letting himself map out the possibilities for this conversation, Draco just answers him honestly. “It’s better than it used to be.”
“Do you want to sleep with him again?”
Harry could no longer stop himself. He began stroking his cock and then thought better of it, moving forward a bit and grabbing Draco’s hair with both hands. Draco obediently opened his mouth and Harry thrust inside, timing his strokes with Charlie’s. Draco was moving between them, back and forth on two cocks.
“No? What did you imagine me eating?”
Harry runs his hand up Draco’s abdomen, through the thick blond hair from his cock to his navel. “Was hoping you’d fuck
Draco looked over and smiled sweetly at Harry. “How was your day, babe?”
So Harry kisses him again.
Malfoy purses his lips. “Well, I thought I might see if you had lunch plans, but if I’m unwelcome, I’m happy to leave you in peace.”
Harry had started to feel like he was reliving the same day over and over. When they returned to the room before dinner, he claimed the shower for frustration-relieving wank, which worked until he dried off and found Malfoy lounging on the bed in his boxers, reading a book.
It is then that Harry’s brain catches up to what his eyes are seeing. Malfoy is reaching up to a high shelf, assumedly searching for a file. His shirt has come untucked from his trousers. A little sliver of pale skin is visible beneath the hem.
With Harry’s combined lack of impulse control and single mindedness, it’s a miracle the lunch dates have gone on this long. It’s a testament to Harry’s desire to see this—whatever it is—through.
“You must live in the same building as Dean and Seamus,” Harry says. “Their flat didn’t have floors when they moved in.”
He hates when Hermione is right.
Draco felt like he might float away. “Yes.”
Harry led him through the kitchen to a small bedroom, the late evening light casting soft shadows across the bed. Draco didn’t stop to look around. When Harry sat on the edge of the bed, Draco knelt down between his knees.
“I just don’t understand. Why would they clone them in the first place?” Draco asked, waving at the television.
Harry nodded, kissed him again, and apparated away.
She smiled in a bored sort of way (Draco would have to copy that) and typed on her computer. The smile turned to a frown.
“What is the right word?” Draco asks, a dare in his eyes.
“Yeah, it was good. He’s… It’s hard to explain. He’s so strong, and gentle, and warm.”
“Lovely,” Harry laughs. He presses a kiss to Draco’s jaw. “You look nice. Heading to work?”
Harry laughed. “Isn’t he?”
Predictably, the first night without his potion, Harry had a nightmare. It was particularly nasty; they always were when he went cold turkey off the Dreamless, like the horrible images saved themselves up while he blocked them. He woke to find himself on his back, soaked in cold sweat, the sheet twisted around his legs. His throat was sore—he must have been yelling—and it took a moment to remember where he was. He peered into the dark, willing himself to believe Voldemort wasn’t hiding there.
for it.
Draco slips a thin-tipped finger under the wrap at the end and carefully pulls off the Spellotape. This is something Harry loves to watch, the delicate unwrapping Draco does with gifts. It’s like he builds his own suspense, or he’s savoring the joy of getting a present. Harry asked him once, early on; Draco snidely said he was raised to be neat, unlike some people. Harry smiles now, thinking of that (and a little of how those same fingertips feel on him, careful and slow).
“—she—”
“I eat lu—”
He was met with smells of pepper and garlic and flour and
Draco is at a coworker’s house party, even though he doesn’t want to be. He didn’t have anything else to do and he couldn’t think of an excuse, so he’d grabbed a bottle of wine to give the host. He even made a plan: He’ll just take a quick lap, say hi to everyone, then leave. Maybe pick up some Thai food on the way home.
Draco pulls the long box from the paper and eyes Harry for a moment before he opens the lid. Inside, resting against black silk, is a necklace. Draco lifts it from the box and holds it up. His eyes, a moment ago shrewdly studying the pendent, go soft. Fourteen tiny diamonds connected with platinum make up—
Draco reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small, black box. Harry can hardly breathe as Draco opens it; two rings sit inside, thin and silver and perfect.
Katelyn elbowed him, then smiled at Harry. “What can I get for you?”
Harry groans. “God, yes, I would die for some noodles right now. Let’s go.”
“Do you want to get lunch sometime?”
“What? No! That’s not what I— Oh, hello, Luna.”
Life was a little chaotic by that point, but Harry didn’t mind. He found he liked having things to do when he got home from practices or lessons, and the animals certainly kept him and Draco busy. The nifflers were now full-grown and entirely too mischievous for their own good. They worked in teams to steal anything within their (quite extensive) reach; Harry had to magically seal all the electronics after he found Terpsichore inside the television one evening.
Draco just nods, grasping Harry’s arm to pull him closer.

“...Draco. Sweetheart.”
“I know it’s called paneer. I’m the Desi here, you’re the colonizer.”
Saving time won’t matter if the trolls kill us.
Andromeda nodded and handed him a dripping glass dish. “Sunday. I think most everyone will be here at about noon. Lunch, cake, games, music. Just a few friends and family, nothing too exciting.”
At Draco’s trial, Potter testified that Draco had acted only in fear of his life, for his parents’ lives. When the Wizengamot announced his pardon, hundreds of eyes were on him, but he only felt one gaze. He found Potter’s green eyes in the crowd, where he was insulated by layers of loyal friends. The expression on Potter’s face was painfully open, studying, curious. Draco returned it. He had questions too.
Draco grinned. “I think I know what we should do this weekend.”
Harry’s cock twitched as Draco crawled into position. He lowered his arse over Charlie’s mouth, using the arm of the sofa behind him for support. Harry watched as Charlie spread Draco’s cheeks apart and he could tell the moment Charlie licked across Draco’s hole; Draco keened and ground down toward the sensation.
“What did she mean—?”
“God, you’re—
They’re quiet as the funky music from the cafe’s speakers fills the space. Harry finds himself feeling comfortable, strangely so. He feels sort of warm, like he does at Ron and Hermione’s house when he’s there late, after a few beers and food and games of chess.
Charlie circled a lubed forefinger around Draco’s hole and Draco bucked back. Charlie chucked. “Hold still, baby. Let me take care of you.” He pressed the finger inside Draco, slowly despite Draco’s relaxation from being rimmed. He kept going with short, teasing strokes, and Draco groaned around Harry’s cock. Finally, he added a second finger, starting to work his own throbbing cock with his other hand. Charlie teased at Draco’s prostate and Draco pulled off Harry’s cock, mewling.
“I—” Harry’s not sure what to say. “There is someone I kind of—”
Still smelling of coffee grounds and pastries, Draco apparated to Andromeda’s little seaside cottage after work one February afternoon. He had no idea what to expect, and he didn’t like walking into a situation he didn’t have under his control, but he was determined to connect with the last of his living family.
“Malfoy?” Seamus finishes. “That little git?”
The waiter materializes. Harry requests a bottle of whatever Draco has been drinking. Draco gives a small smile and Harry thinks maybe he’s making up some lost ground. Their privacy charm winks back into place as the waiter Disapparates.
Draco climbs up, straddles Harry’s chest. Harry takes a moment to drink this in—Draco, flushed pink, looking down through his eyelashes as his cock twitches inches from Harry’s lips—but it’s a quick moment, because Harry thinks if he doesn’t get his lips around that prick in the next few seconds he’ll explode.
When Draco arrived at his flat that night, his feet were sore from walking and his cheeks were sore from smiling.
“Oh. You’re welcome?” Draco felt stupid, looming over them with his uneaten cake, so without looking at Potter, he sat back down and reached for a fork.
Draco scooped him up, peeking to check for blood before holding him tight. “Shh, shh, it’s okay…” He waited for Teddy to calm down, patting his back, then looked up at Andromeda. She was smiling softly at them.
Stars were shooting across the night sky four and five at a time. Within a few minutes, the whole sky was covered in them, silver trails eclipsing the black expanse. Draco watched Harry’s face as it filled with awe.
“I haven’t seen you like this since Brad and you were gaga for him. What’s Malfoy done to you?” Ron rubs soothing circles on Harry’s back.
He can feel time tugging at him, though, and finally he relents. Carefully he extricates himself from Harry, casts a silent
They were soon independent enough to manage a few hours by themselves in the flat, confined to a bedroom with more safety and monitoring charms than Gringotts. Draco popped in at lunch to refill their food dishes and confiscate whatever shiny contraband they’d managed to find. Harry couldn’t help but fall a little more in love with Draco every time he checked the camera he’d installed in the nifflers’ room while they were out; this kind of care and attention was something Draco hid from the world, protective of his vulnerabilities. Seeing it was a special kind of intimacy that Harry knew was rare.
Draco nodded. “He belongs here,” he echoed quietly.
Lovegood nodded and looked up at the cloudless sky. “Hmm. You’re right. Best not, with the party.” She laid the stick on the ground. “You’re nervous.”
“Thank you, Geddet. I’ll ring when we’re ready to leave,” said Draco, doing his best grateful smile.
The tension melts from Harry and he takes a deep breath. Ever since Scorpius came to them, he’s been so on edge, terrified that something will happen. But he doesn’t need to worry. Draco is here.
“Potter, I’m not an idiot,” Draco said.
Draco
When Draco hesitated, Charlie slapped the side of his arse. Draco yelped and stood, cock bobbing as he moved.
“Happy to see Papa? Me too, Scorp, but it’s his turn to sleep.” Harry kisses Draco’s cheek. “I’ve got him, love. You get some rest. It’s your shift next.”
Andromeda had prepared a little spread of sandwiches and scones. They sat in a sunroom, the wintery coast in view, and watched Teddy perform various feasts of toddler gymnastics. Teddy’s interests seemed to be primarily insects, sweets, and the sound of his own yells.
“Say what?”
. His eyes roam down to Malfoy’s arse, covered by the black trousers. He has the impulse to grab, to feel, to pull the trousers down and see Malfoy’s skin hidden coyly behind intricate black
They sit in silence for a few minutes, Harry determinedly not looking at Malfoy but also trying not to look like he’s not looking. It’s awkward.
A sliver of delicate white lace is just visible above Malfoy’s belt.
Hopefully.
Harry springs out of bed. Why is it quiet? There’s a newborn in the house; between him and Draco, it’s never quiet here. What if they were taken? What if—? No, it’s no use picturing the worst case, he just needs to go investigate.
“Hang on.” Draco backs up a little, pulls his wand from his pocket and sends a patronus to Katelyn.
“Well, no, you were good at it in school—”
? Not another Quidditch player, please.” Dean was the one who introduced Harry to Brad, the American Keeper with a big laugh and great arms. It had been awkward between Dean and Harry for months after Harry broke it off with Brad.
She turns around and slams the door behind her.
,” Draco said, chuckling. “It’s too hard to control, I’d be worried I’d eviscerate myself.”
He ran his hands from Harry’s bare knees up under his shorts until he felt Harry’s briefs at his hips. Harry’s breathing quickened and Draco wanted to
Draco traces his fingers over Harry’s palm, his wrist. Harry feels a trail of electricity follow along, or maybe magic. His heart’s been racing for hours. Days.
He reached a hand underneath himself, balancing on one arm, but Charlie stopped him. “I told you I’d take care of you, baby boy.” Charlie smeared the rest of the lube in his palm along Draco’s length and stroked him gently, aware that he must be sensitive. He sped up his thrusts, snapping his hips against Draco’s arse, and Draco cried out as he came for a second time.
In the morning, neither of them said a word, though they woke up still entwined. The day was the same as all the others—breakfast, socializing, stubbornly searching for clues—but it had taken on a new tone. They held hands as they walked around, though no one was there to see; Harry returned Malfoy’s little smiles over dinner and found he was looking forward to being alone together that evening.
“Draco?”
“See you tomorrow?”
A roar and a scream emanated from the television and Draco broke off. “Maybe we could…” He gestured at the screen. Harry twisted around and pressed a button on the remote.
“Katelyn is going to kill me,” Draco murmurs.
Harry is not a good cook, but he is a dedicated one. Molly taught him his favorite recipes; that, combined with a few cookbooks and some enthusiasm, has enabled Harry to semi-successfully make a handful of dishes he feels proud of. He often thinks that if Molly had been his potions teacher, he might have done better.
“Oh? Do you have other plans for us?” Draco asked coyly, standing.
“I could help you, if you like.” Draco thinks of the stacks and stacks of heritage documents in his family vaults. The Potters must be in there.
“Not to worry. We’re all family here.” With that, Lovegood walked away, leaving her rainmaker laying in front of Draco. He considered picking it up, looking around for guidance, but the partygoers were all seemingly engaged in their conversations and games. To be safe, Draco cast a shield charm around the stick, then headed toward the food.
“Hold on, Maria Antonia?”
But Harry just shrugs and smiles again. This time, Draco notices a little dimple at the corner of his mouth. Draco wants to touch his freckled cheeks.
Harry’s wardrobe is a simple piece, light wood with two doors and small handles. Inside, it smells like cedar and more sandalwood and laundry soap and very, very Harry. Draco considers climbing in to hide all day in the safety of Harry’s clothes. Shaking his head, he sorts quickly through the bins to find one full of underwear. He feels a bit odd about it, but he shrinks a pair to fit his smaller hips and slides them on. There’s a little thrill that shoots through him knowing that he’s wearing Harry’s underwear, but he pushes aside the rush of arousal in favor of finding a top.
“Good god. I never thought I’d be grateful for floors.”
Draco shrugs. “I like it.”
Draco snorted and kissed the top of Harry’s head. “And anyway, I’ve never seen dragons like these.”
No, let’s go the long way around.
Charlie broke the kiss. “How do you want to do this?”
“You’re such a swot,” Harry said lovingly. “I thought the muses were all women?”
Harry opens his eyes to find Draco has moved from his chair to the floor. He’s kneeling beside Harry. Well, he’s on one knee.
It’s a Thursday. Malfoy barges into Harry’s office raving about file mismanagement, waving two cartons of curry, just after noon. No invitation, no knock.
Andromeda was talking with a few people and she waved from across the garden. Draco waved back, smiled, and considered leaving since she had seen him.
“She doesn’t—”
Harry nods and rubs a hand over his face. “Yeah, you’re right. It’s just—” He cuts off with a sigh. Harry doesn't know what it is about Malfoy. He’s always been able to get under Harry’s skin, hasn’t he?
Draco paused. “Defensive arts.”
“No, it’s no use arguing, mate.” Harry beckons a plate from the cupboard and his quesadilla floats onto it. “I like our nighttime adventures just as much as you do, but we’ve got to get our beauty sleep.”
“Draco, what—?” Harry started, but he couldn’t pick a question to ask first. He just gestured at the calf-sized animal currently laying on his living room carpet.
“Auror Potter! I was just about to send you a note. Have you had a chance to look at the report Jones sent you about the Greenwich case?”
When they left, they walked for a little while in the dusk, both of them quiet. Draco felt content; loneliness had been his constant companion since his mother died, but it eased with Harry. Strong, brash, warm Harry.
Draco gasps when Harry reaches the sensitive place at the base of his neck. “Okay, we’ve—
“Oh?” Dean sits back in his chair. “Who do we know who’s single and queer at the Ministry?”
Malfoy frowns. “Why?”
“Not if I kiss you first.” Draco darted in quickly to press his lips to Harry’s, who was still smiling, and delighted at the feeling of being so close. Harry kissed him back, slowly, then backed away.
- - - - -
“Yeah,” Harry said, coming back up to lay at Draco’s side. “Unless— Do you not—?”
Right on time, Harry popped into existence. “Hey, babe. What’s all this?”
“Anything big happening tomorrow?”
Malfoy is there. He’s got a foot on the arm of one of the chairs in front of Harry’s desk, and he’s bent over to tie his shoe.
One afternoon in April, Draco was standing at Andromeda’s kitchen counter, drying plates after she washed them. Initially, he had thought it was ridiculous that she didn’t use magic, but he had come to find it sort of meditative. On the ground, Teddy clanged together a wooden spoon and a pot, laughing at himself.
He wonders what Ron’s reaction would be if Harry told him about the lace. It only took three drinks for Harry to confess he couldn’t stop thinking about the conversation (if you could call it that); one more and he’d probably feel okay about giving up the rest of the details. Harry realizes that most likely means it’s time to go to bed.
Harry gestures lazily at a group of former Ravenclaws playing a game on the coffee table. “They know her. I just tagged along.”
“Chicken alfredo.”
Apropos of nothing, Harry said, “D’you know I’m half-Indian?”
“Just eat, Malfoy. I don’t have any answers.”
Potter gave him a strange look, like he’s calculating something. “Huh.”
Harry realizes he’s smiling, clears his face, then rereads the note and smiles again.
“Maybe,” Draco answered with a grin. “Nice to know you’re faithful, though, love.”
- - - - -
He looked up to see Draco had one hand in his hair, his head back. Draco bucked his hips toward Harry’s mouth and then pushed down on Charlie’s tongue. “Oh my -
Harry could see him there, in the dark, just barely visible, head propped on his hand. Before he lost his nerve, Harry leaned forward and pressed his lips to Malfoy’s.
Monday morning, Harry makes it to his office without any major incidents (just Wently reminding him about a Greenwich briefing that afternoon, in the most annoying possible way). He closes the door, takes off his stuffy Head Auror robe, and eyes the unfriendly-looking stack in his inbox with suspicion. Nothing good is ever on the top of the stack on Monday morning. It’s always something terrible.
“Actually, erm— Do you want to move this to my room?”
Harry stood and helped Draco get up. Charlie sat up and pulled off his sweater, and Harry thought Draco might faint.
“Did Granger check with any pureblood families?”
“I’ll be here.”
They sat together for some time, maybe minutes or hours, before Harry apparated them all to his bed. There would be time for talking and planning later; for tonight, they would just be together.
Draco bit his lip and nodded. They wandered to the sitting room; Harry aimed a stasis charm at the rest of dinner and followed them.
But Malfoy doesn’t look up. He doesn't say hello. He goes on with the parchment, apparently deep in thought.
“Love the color, Teddo,” said Potter to Teddy, who giggled madly. To Draco, Potter said, “Alright?”
“A sanctuary, yeah.” Harry puffed out his cheeks. “Where will it—”
“You like a tongue in your hole, Draco?” Charlie asked.
As Harry rides the lift up to the Auror department, he takes deep breaths.
“Mm, I get the feeling he’s bad a lot,” Charlie said with a grin. “Draco, be a good boy and stand up for a moment.”
Harry glances up and Draco sees the recognition register in his glassy eyes. Harry’s grin broadens and he waves Draco over. Draco feels a flush climb up his cheeks and, for reasons unknown to himself, sits next to Harry.
In the night he decided the lace would be soft—Malfoy would never subject himself to roughness.
But the train pulls forward again, like an old man standing up from a low seat, and Harry nearly whoops out loud with delight. At least he won’t be a full hour late.
“He’s not a git,” Harry’s quick to say, too quick. “Well, he is, yeah..but he has, you know...changed.”
Draco spent a little while organizing the vault before Harry arrived. He found quite a lot on the Potters and even some references to the Peverells, though he suspected those were only rumors. Draco sorted the relevant files into a stack at the front of the vault, then pushed everything else to the back.
Harry pretends his heart isn’t pumping out of his chest at the contact. It shouldn’t be. It’s shoulders touching for half a second through multiple layers of clothing. Not like it would feel if it was Malfoy’s hand on his waist or Harry’s lips on Malfoy’s neck;
“Mm? Harry?” Draco whispers.
, he tells his wildly beating heart. It doesn’t help. He’s not going to be weird around Malfoy; not because of the lace or whatever it was that happened yesterday. It’s just Malfoy, a (very) attractive man who happens to work along Harry’s route to the break room. Good for small talk. Part of the routine. Nothing else.
“I think just public records. It should all be there, shouldn’t it?”
Harry blushed. “Are you sure you want to talk about this?”
“—and Wilfred said—get this—Wilfred said it doesn’t even matter!” Malfoy’s saying as he opens the curry on Harry’s coffee table. He produces two forks, drops one on the empty plate he’s set aside for Harry, and piles every bit of paneer onto his own plate. “Doesn’t matter? I’ll hear him say that when it’s the middle of the night and there’s five Aurors breathing down his neck while he tries to pull files that aren’t color-coded! Honestly. How else would we know—”
Draco stops in Harry’s front doorway to peek in the accent mirror there before heading to work. He’s flushed, his hair is a mess, and he clearly looks like he’s just been thoroughly fucked.
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” Harry said quietly.
, and curses himself. He only has 40 minutes until he has to open the cafe. Biting his lip, he thinks quickly—he can shower here, wear yesterday’s jeans, steal something from Harry’s closet—yes, he can make this work.
Draco pressed a kiss to his lips. “Come here, you mad bugger.”
Draco stroked his own cock, coating himself, and added a little more at Harry’s entrance. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist.
Ron chuckles. “I’d wager it means he’ll see you in the morning, mate.”
Draco cocked an eyebrow. Using fake names now, eh? That didn’t bode well.
Things became a little strained when Draco showed up a few weeks later with a baby bicorn.
“Goddesses,” Draco corrected. “But I think the names are pretty neutral.”
Seamus and Dean arrive with wine and cupcakes. Seamus helps himself to Harry’s mismatched collection of wine glasses while Harry serves the lasagne. They all eat far too much and find themselves flushed, wine-drunk, and giggly.
Harry does as he’s told, but he reaches for Draco.
Harry pulled out of Draco’s mouth. “Gonna come on your face, baby.” Draco kept his mouth open as Harry stroked himself once, twice, and then he was coming as well, thick ropes over Draco’s pretty cheeks. Draco lapped up the come he could reach with his tongue.
Draco fucks Harry fast, the first time, on the first stair landing. Harry shudders as he comes, legs wrapped around Draco’s waist, one hand tangled in the black lace around Draco’s hips. He watches Draco’s face as he comes just after. Draco watches him too.
Draco buried his head against Harry’s neck. He curled one arm around Harry’s middle and took Charlie’s hand with the other. His eyes were closed, his breathing heavy.
.” Harry moves onto Draco’s buttons, doing his best to make his fingers work while Draco sucks a love bite into his collarbone.
“Suck me,” Draco pleads, his voice deeper than Harry’s ever heard it. “Please, suck—”
Draco pulled off, swiped the back of his hand across his mouth, and looked at Harry. “You alright?”
Shut up, I’m trying to help you!
“I do not. What would that even look like?”
Before he could calculate an answer, Draco’s mouth said, “Not really.” He didn’t know why he was so honest—he kicked himself for not saying he had an appointment.
“So what brings you to a place like this?” he asks Malfoy in between mouthfuls.
Casting a quiet expansion charm on the sofa, Harry snuggles up behind Draco, taking a moment to soak in the beauty of his partner and son. He doesn’t know what he did to deserve this family, this love, but for now, he’s going to hold them close and keep them safe. He buries his face between Draco’s shoulders.
“I’m not the worst gay! I’m, like, maybe the tenth worst.”
HARRY
Draco laughed harder. “You
“I’m ready. Please, fuck me.”
We’ll save hours if we cut through--

ed, unsure of what to say. Harry traced his fingers over Draco’s hand on the table.
He smiles and pulls out a fresh sheet.
of stress it is.”
“You do make me—well, I’m not sure stressed is the right word.” Harry barely recognizes his own voice, deeper and quieter. He strokes his hand down Draco’s neck. His skin is soft, warm.
But then Draco sucks Harry’s nipple into his mouth and those sort of thoughts are gone. All that’s left is,
“I do,” Draco said quickly. He pulled Harry to him for a kiss, his brain short circuiting as their pricks rubbed between them.
He hears Draco shift around, but no answer comes.
“Lick it, baby. Let me see what you can do,” Charlie said, pulling off his own trousers and pants in one motion.
Draco had wanted to visit since the moment he heard it was next to impossible.
“We’re gonna take care of you, baby,” Charlie said, throaty. “Turn around on my lap. I want to watch you kiss Harry.”
He’d woken from hundreds of nightmares screaming and never — not once — had someone stayed in his bed long enough to comfort him. But Malfoy stroked his arm, whispered comforts in his ear, and Harry melted into him. He let himself tuck his face into the crook of Malfoy’s neck, let Malfoy curl a protective arm around him, let himself be held. Malfoy talked quietly about nothing, flowers and broom types and dinner etiquette, and slowly Harry’s body relaxed and he closed his eyes and drifted back to sleep.
“Oh,” said Harry. He watched the squirming babies and found himself wishing he could hold them.
We’ll be fine! We’ll cast silencers on our feet. Come on, love. Nothing’s going to happen.
It was quite busy, which meant Draco could keep himself occupied—Mondays were hit or miss depending on the weather and the phrase of the moon, Katelyn explained when Draco had started the job the year before—and Draco had nearly forgotten Potter by the lunch rush. Of course, then a mischievous little girl snuck behind the counter to help, which reminded Draco of Teddy, which reminded him that Potter was coming—or not—in just under an hour.
Harry was captivated. While Draco was just tracing names through the books, Harry touched every photo reverently, like they were flower petals in danger of crumbling, and lingered on each page. Draco didn’t understand, but he imagined seeing all this for the first time would be overwhelming. Draco had been forced to memorize many of these books as a child, so he was less enthusiastic about looking through them. Seeing the wonder on Harry’s face made it worth the effort, though.
By the time they retrieved the car from the valet, it was nearing half past eight. Draco let himself into the car this time.
“Well, it’s over now. I make enough at the cafe to get by in my flat, and maybe someday the Ministry will give it all back. To my grandchildren.” Draco laughed bitterly. “Let’s get back to it, hm?”
“When you’re finished, could you come sit with me?” Harry asked. Harry had known this conversation was probably approaching, but he didn’t expect it so soon.
Draco’s face brightened. “I’ve thought of that. We can convert the nifflers’ room with expansion charms. They need more space, anyway, now that they’re almost adults. So we’ll put down some rugs and transfigure them to pasture grass for Maria Antonia, give her a whole field to roam, then the nifflers can have their own—”
“You can just drop me at the closest Apparition point,” Draco said as Harry fastened his seatbelt.
Harry feels as though the world has shifted, or maybe he has entered an alternate universe. Malfoy, to whom Harry says hello every morning, is wearing
Draco eyes him. “Right.”
“Draco, this is—” Harry breathed.
“Potter, why do you look like someone’s stuffed a pillow up your arse?”
, which is coincidentally what’s coming out of his mouth, too. He feels Draco smile and Harry swipes his tongue across Draco’s teeth.
“Harry, what say you get those clothes off and let me watch this pretty boy get your cock in his mouth?”
Harry kisses him, and Draco knows he intended it to be innocent, but Draco deepens the kiss. He crowds Harry against the counter. Harry smiles. “What time do you need to be at the cafe?”
Charlie looked at Draco. “What do you want?”
Draco nodded minutely and slid down until the tip hit the back of his throat. Harry moaned; he knew what came next. Draco relaxed his throat, allowing Harry to push gently until he was buried. Draco looked up at Harry, tears and love in his eyes, and Harry stroked his cheek as he pulled back. Draco leaned away for a moment to breathe.
Harry sat back up, never letting up in his rhythm on Draco’s cock, and watched as his boyfriend’s face contorted in ecstasy. Ropes of come landed on Harry’s hand and Charlie’s sweater. Draco finally leaned his head against Harry’s shoulder, shuddering.
Wently huffs. “Yes, I suppose that will do.” She stalks off down the corridor.
It’s just that it’s so cliche, the workaholic late to anniversary dinner with his boyfriend. Harry pictures, again, Draco twirling his salad fork around his fingers, alone at a little table, soup gone cold in front of him, eyes flicking to a nearby window every few seconds.
Harry guided him around by his hips until Draco was backed against the bed. He laid back and Harry followed him, pressing open-mouthed kisses down his chest, his cock bobbing against Draco’s trousers. Draco was almost painfully hard and pressed the heel of one hand against himself to get some relief. Harry took notice and went to work on Draco’s belt, biting one hipbone as he unbuttoned the fly. Draco gasped at the pain of the bite, but then Harry had a hand wrapped around him and his nerves were buzzing with electricity. Harry spread his precome around the head, wanking him with slow, tight movements, watching Draco’s face. Draco’s couldn’t look away from Harry’s broad fingers around his pink cock.
It takes just about all the willpower Harry has to concentrate on his job that day, despite the ridiculous amount of work there is to get done. As he thought, there’s no chance for lunch or a break; he barely manages to get to the bathroom for a piss, and even then, a junior Auror follows him in to ask a question. But as Harry mechanically delegates tasks and attends meetings and reads reports, his thoughts continually stray back to the lace.
HARRY

right now than he does in those smiling Witch Weekly covers. Draco clears his throat. “What are you on?”
Harry took the chance to straddle Charlie’s hips. He could feel Charlie’s hardness beneath him and gave the bulge a perfunctory rub. Charlie moaned into Draco’s arse; Draco moaned into Harry’s waiting mouth.
Harry. He blindly reaches in front of him, and Harry is there, solid and warm and naked and—he’s
“I was
, he thinks, then immediately feels guilty. For penance, he actually reads the details of the case and gives it consideration before assigning it to Ullery. They’ve been wanting a more challenging case, and this one looks tricky.
Malfoy’s eyes slide toward the door. Harry moves sideways; he doesn’t like anyone blocking him in rooms, and he’s willing to bet Malfoy likes his exits clear too. “Yes, Potter. Lunch. Usually a midday meal. You do eat meals? I suppose that was rather a leap—”
He threw himself into rearranging the syrup cabinet, then into a thorough round of cleaning charms for the pastry cases. By the time Deacon arrived to relieve Draco, the cafe was lemon-fresh and sparkling.
Charlie, dressed in jeans and a soft-looking sweater, hugged Harry as they said their hellos. He smelled divine, as always, like woods and fire. Harry took the offered bottle of Ogden’s and started toward the kitchen.
Harry hesitated. “Yes? But you can do wandless, I’ve seen you.”
.” Whatever Draco was, he’d never know, as he’d taken most of Harry’s cock into his mouth and sucked his cheeks hollow. He reached his tongue down toward the base, savoring the feeling of the pulsing vein, and began to bob his head, getting more and more of Harry into his mouth.
sleep?”
“Hey,” Draco says softly, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist.
“I don’t think we can give him up,” said Draco into the dark one night. They were laying in bed, listening to the nifflers scampering around their room. Harry was almost asleep and had his arm tucked around Draco’s waist. “We’re his family now,” Draco continued.
As for Andromeda herself, she acted as though she had always been in Draco’s life, never flinching when he told her about his Hogwarts years or the days he’d spent holed up in the Manor with the Death Eaters. Initially, Draco had been cautious, but he found it remarkably easy to talk to Andromeda; her responses to his deepest secrets and greatest pains was usually, “Hmm,” followed by a pat on the arm. She hugged him every time he arrived and left. After Draco mentioned that lemon bars were his favorite, she kept some under a stasis charm every Thursday.
Several weeks and many kisses later, Draco wrote to Harry:
The both of them were silent for a moment, then they started speaking at once.
Draco frowns at him. “You’re a demon, Potter.” He does his best to straighten the cardigan and finds his jeans are still unbuttoned. He does them up with a huff.
They go on for two weeks, eating lunch together. Sometimes in the cafe, a few days in the Ministry cafeteria, twice on the couch in Harry’s office. Harry tries not to read too much into it; friends eat lunch together all the time. He and Hermione meet up every few weeks when their schedules align. It’s a friendly thing.
“I want you to fuck me,” said Harry, his voice low.
“Not really, or no?” Dean says with a grin.
He wondered about his own armor. He wondered who would see through it.
Potter snorted. “I was actually thinking that you’re a lot more interesting than I thought.”
“Good. Quite good,” Draco conceded.
They started sending letters then, just little jokes back and forth. Once, Draco woke up for his early shift to find Harry’s owl perched at the end of his bed clutching a note that just said Good morning. Knowing Harry, he’d set an alarm to get up and send the letter before Draco woke up. Draco taped the note to his bathroom mirror.
Harry hums and takes a bite. He knows his cheeks are red. He keeps his eyes on his plate.
“No! No, I’m— It’s fine. Take off your coat, Potter, sit down.” Draco’s cheeks flush just a little.
“Harry, everything is fine. Everyone spills tea. It happens. It sounds like you took care of it quickly and left with your dignity,” Hermione says.
“It’s a little cold, it always catches me off guard.”
The shower is a pleasant surprise as well. Draco suspected Harry was an all-purpose soap type, but there are separate shampoo and conditioner bottles, a few scents of body soap, and two kinds of face wash. Draco cleans himself as quickly as he can while luxuriating in the hot water and fantastic water pressure, towels off, and steps onto the bath mat. It occurs to him that he’s going to smell like Harry all day, and he feels himself smiling. Just to round it out, he spritzes a little cologne on his wrist.
Harry flushed. “Er, James?”
Draco smiled unconsciously, then set his jaw in what he hoped was a nonchalant sort of way. “Hello.”
“Yeah. There isn’t any.” Draco clenched his jaw, ready for Harry to make some snide comment.
Harry’s owl flew into Draco’s living room just a moment later.
“You asked what I’ve been doing since Hogwarts. I’ve been studying. And working.”
“Lunch?”
Harry’s focus is so precisely not on Malfoy, in fact, that he’s strategically looking at the cup of tea in his hand as he walks back. This, combined with his quick pace and mantra of
“Wait,” Harry says, fingertips not letting go of Draco’s.
“Was it good?”
Harry attends the required meetings. He is spoken to by the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, the Lead of Personnel, the Director of the Staff Personal Liaison Committee, several members of the Wizengamot, a delegate of the French Office Management Task Force, and, of course, Kingsley Shacklebolt.
The night of, Draco spent two hours getting ready in Harry’s bathroom - though Harry had no idea what could take two hours, he let him be - while Harry prepared their dinner. Harry drank half a bottle of Merlot in an attempt to calm his nerves, so by the time Charlie knocked, he felt warm and slightly turned on.
“You’re leaving?” Potter asked.
He would never, ever tell a soul he’d had feelings for Potter since they’d had a few too many drinks at Neville, Ginny, and Luna’s wedding years ago. It was hard enough admitting it to himself, let alone squashing that little voice that whispered his fondness for the idiot had been around since Hogwarts.
“I’m off at two tomorrow. Meet you then.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, let’s see your hand.” Charlie held a hand out and Harry concentrated for a moment before a dollop of warm lubricant appeared in Charlie’s palm.
Draco smiled. Harry had a little fleck of food at the corner of his mouth. Draco reached out and brushed it off. “Take me back in a year, then.”
“They’re not—” Harry turned around and saw Draco was grinning. “Ah, you’re fucking with me.”
Draco isn’t in their bed, but Harry can’t hear him walking around on their creaky wood floors or Scorpius crying. The house is completely silent.

“This weekend is Teddy’s second birthday party,” Andromeda mentioned. That was how she conveyed information, offering it casually, leaving it up to Draco to decide whether or not to engage.
“Go on, say it.”
“Next--oh god. Do you have anything open tonight?”
Malfoy moved closer. “It’s alright,” he murmured.
Harry catches a glimpse of white-blonde in the Wizengamot file room and stops. Perhaps Malfoy has a moment to chat; perhaps this day won’t be so bad after all.
- - - - -
“This alright?” he asked softly, and Harry licked his lips and nodded. Draco tugged on Harry’s shorts until Harry lifted up a bit and shimmied them down his legs. He kicked them off as Draco planted wet kisses on Harry’s inner thigh, breathing in the intoxicating scent. He licked a line up where Harry’s leg met his hip and Harry bit back a moan.
“Potter. How lovely of you to join me.” Draco doesn’t stand when he sees Harry, as he usually does. He sips his wine, perfectly casual.
Harry shot him a mischievous smile. “Just trust me.”
Harry chuckles. “Not really, no.”
Draco strode out from behind the counter. “We’ll take it to go, Katelyn, thanks.”
“Oh? You weren’t?”
Harry called Charlie that night and asked him over for dinner. Charlie accepted quickly, and told Harry he’d been looking forward to meeting Draco again. Harry took that as a good omen.
Too curious to roll back into sleep, Draco gets up to investigate, wrapping a blanket around himself. He follows his nose to the kitchen.
The cafe is more crowded in the evening than lunchtime. There’s a live band, a trio playing soft love songs. The paintings have rotated, an attempt by the owners to mix things up. The server forgets to bring the bread Harry orders for his soup. Someone at another table steals the third chair at theirs.
“Disgraceful,” Harry agrees, making a mental note to look up David Bowie.
Draco fell asleep without knowing it; he dreamed of sandalwood and dusk and bronze-brown fingers intertwined with his.
It got complicated when Malfoy kept forgetting to stop the niceness behind closed doors. He’d sit next to Harry on the bed, or tuck a stray curl back into place, or smile at him across their hotel room. Without fail, Harry’s heart jumped into his throat every time. He never said anything—didn’t want to embarrass Malfoy—but it was very confusing. Disarming.
“Erm.” Harry takes a big gulp of water. “Sorry, what?”
Harry shrugged. “It doesn’t matter - I mean, we’re together now. Charlie and I are just friends.”
Draco tiptoes to the bathroom, not wanting to wake Harry. He finds an unopened toothbrush under the sink (freshening charms just don’t do the job properly) and inspects his reflection while he brushes. One small love bite on his collarbone—it’ll be covered by a top, no need to heal it. His heart swells at the thought of keeping this little reminder with him all day.
It was the same reaction everyone Draco told someone. He sighed. “Something like ‘You’ll have plenty of experience to draw on then,’ or ‘Figuring out the light side’s secrets for next time?’ Usually along those lines.”
“Where will
Harry tongued the sensitive slit and savored the salty taste there before sliding his tongue along the underside of the head. He blew gently against the saliva he left behind and wrapped his fingers around the base tightly. Draco was panting now, little breathy mewls under each breath. Harry took his cock fully in his mouth, sucking down and pulling back, until he felt Draco’s soft blond curls against his nose. He backed off and swirled his tongue around the head, then went back down.
. He pictures, unbidden, how Malfoy would look with his arse in the air, knickers pulled to one side as Harry presses his cock in his tight hole—
Draco quietly accepted his slice and started to slide off the bench, intending to go home. Potter caught his arm.
HARRY
Potter, I’m going to fucking kill you!
The loo is clear and Harry takes the opportunity to breathe. Big, round breaths like Hermione taught him. He’s fine. He’s in control of himself. He washes his face and makes his way back to his office.
“No, I mean, did you just do that wandless?”
. Draco blinks his eyes to focus and finds Harry still asleep, snoring quietly. There’s a little bruise on his neck, just the shape of Draco’s mouth. His lips are still red and raw from Draco’s teeth and stubble. Freckles dust his cheeks, so perfectly arranged they must have been placed there individually.
--had listened to me, you imbecile!
They leave halfway through their meals. By the time they fall through Harry’s front door, Draco’s sweater has been Vanished and Harry’s jeans are undone.
All said, Draco Malfoy is decidedly part of Harry’s morning routine now. It isn’t that Harry looks forward to seeing him, or that they’re friends. The quick jokes and friendly smiles are equivalent in importance to the twenty-six foot walk from the apparition point to the lift button. Just another step  that makes each morning regular.
He was scooping up a sizable portion of potatoes when Potter popped onto the grass. Several Weasleys ran to greet him, all exchanging hugs and kisses. Draco nodded to himself; he’d known Potter, as Teddy’s godfather, would be there but he’d hoped to avoid him.
DRACO
“Studying,” Draco said suddenly.
Harry studied Draco. His silver eyes were sparkling, his lips in a little smirk. He was planning something. Harry decided to play along. “Are you?”
“Draco,” Harry whispers. The dragon constellation glitters in the light.
“Hmm. I do like coq au vin.”
- - - - -
It’s Harry’s turn to shrug. “Dunno. You were so posh in school. I guess I never imagined you in a place like this, eating a toastie.”
“I smelled food. Wanted to make sure you weren’t burning the house down.” Draco takes a few steps and rests his chin on Harry’s shoulder. Scorpius smiles a gummy grin up at him.
“Yeah, just boards.”
“I didn’t have a crush—!”
“Yeah,” Harry says, and nods. “It’s nice. Cozy.”
Draco gave him a long look. “And you want to speak now?”
Harry had brought enough Dreamless Sleep to last him ten days (the mission was only supposed to be seven) so he thought he had overprepared. But as time dragged on with no contact from their source, it became clear they would be sharing this room for longer than anticipated. Harry told Malfoy to cast a silencing spell if Harry woke him at night and thought that’d be the end of it.
Harry takes Draco’s hands, presses kisses to each palm, and Draco’s already precariously soft heart melts a little more. He knows he’s in love with Harry—it’s not just last night or this morning, it’s everything, every smile and kiss and teasing jab. It’s even the shadows in Harry’s eyes, the way they match Draco’s own dark places. It’s the way Harry listens and doesn’t fix, just stays with him until the hurt hurts less. It’s the twisting, sparkling thrill every time Harry touches him, the one he’s sure will never fade.
Harry eyed the little green twig. Bowtruckles were peaceful and cared for themselves, but they had a tendency to gouge at eyes if irritated. So far, Firbramble was quite calm, but Harry made a mental note not to let any of the nifflers bother him.
“Like you look right now. All—” Draco widens his eyes dramatically.
After a couple of hours, Harry stood up to stretch and wipe some of the dust off his hands. He looked around at the cavernous vault, the various furniture pieces covered in sheets, and Draco studied him. Harry had filled out since that first awful year of trials. He’d told Draco he’d started running in the evenings and it suited him. He was not tall—part of Draco was quite pleased that Harry had never caught up to him in height—but he had broad shoulders and strong legs. Harry’s back and chest muscles were visible under the old t-shirts he perpetually dressed himself in. Draco found he wanted to see what Harry looked like underneath them.
Harry turns in his grasp, a bright smile on his face. “Good morning.” He glances down. “Nice sweater.”
“What’s it for?”
“—but if you really want to stop being miserable, you need to talk to him. You said he was asking you to lunch? Ask him back. If he says yes, there you go. If he says no, give him space.”
“Is that right,
Draco wakes slowly, lazily, the comfort of sleep only rivaled by the unfamiliarity of the room around him. There are birds outside the cracked window, singing softly. Early sunlight filters over him like gentle fingers caressing the bed. He’s warm, tangled in a soft duvet, his face in a pillow that smells like sandalwood and—
Draco did his best to smile politely. “Oh. Lovely, thank you. Ah, but, maybe another day.”
“Shut it. I’m eating.”
Harry did as he was told and accepted the glass of merlot. Draco scooted closer and Harry laid his arm out so Draco could rest his head on it. “Are we camping?”
He just barely managed to make it through the after dinner card games, followed by a beach bonfire during which Malfoy fed him a marshmallow and Harry wanted to bury himself in the sand. When they finally made it back to the room, Harry was exhausted from all the pretending and didn’t even bother undressing before he climbed into bed.
“Actually, I was going to grab some Thai on the way home.” Draco hesitates. “Do you— Do you like pad see ew?”
Harry shrugged. “Hermione’s looked, but there’s just a little bit of history before my parents died. Sleekeazy’s had some about my grandparents, but nothing else.”
Harry’s stomach flips. Is Malfoy flirting or just being his usual prickly self? “Posh stuff. French food. What’s coq au vin? Maybe that.”
Charlie wasn’t long after. He buried himself to the hilt, groaning as he filled Draco.
Harry gasps.
“Forget it. See you in the morning, Potter.” Draco is out the door before Harry can process what’s happened.
