When they were close to Harry’s home, Harry asked Draco to pull over. He parked under a tree opposite the park.
business is utter bollocks,” he says while cupping Harry’s. “I think the real reason you were able to defeat the Dark Lord, is simply because you’re more evil.”
, reading about various imaging techniques. The doctors had declared Harry healthy, yet his headaches persisted, right in the spot where his scar should be. The more Draco thought about it, the more he wanted a second opinion.
They repeated the incantation, voices raised above the storm, and with each repetition, the void got smaller. After the seventh time, it disappeared completely.
. He swallowed down his guilt with a sip of wine, and Hermione’s voice brought him back to the present.
The Dark Lord’s new wand, peculiar and knobby, arched through the air. Hermione, with reflexes a Seeker would envy, stretched out her hand and caught it. The surprise on the Dark Lord’s face was clear—how dare a Muggle-born disarm a wizard of his stature? In fact, he was too shocked to notice the flash of silver immediately to his right. Longbottom swung the sword and severed the Dark Lord’s head, just as he’d dispatched the snake.
He towelled off his hair and worked in a special leave-in serum his aunt had bought to tame his hair. Now it lay completely flat.
Harry pulled out his wand, and Draco did the same. Their eyes met, and Draco nodded. Harry thought back to their wedding day and shouted in tandem with Draco, “
Harry leaned in and whispered, “Who is she? Why are we here?” But before Draco could respond, Harry paled. Sweat broke out along his brow, and Draco’s skin prickled with the faint buzzing of magic—what little there was left. Harry’s legs buckled, and Draco grabbed hold of him so he didn’t fall.
Petunia busied herself stamping out her cigarette. “I can’t talk about this with you right now.” Slowly, she rose. “I need to lie down. You may stay, for now.” When she reached the door, she looked back at Harry and the broken glass in the dustbin.
Draco wondered how. Fixing a wand should be impossible. He knew there was more to the story, something she wasn’t telling him. He suspected the answer to that question resided elsewhere in the house.
“Until you’re all better. Until you’re back to normal and can see the error of your ways.” Harry could hear her teacup clink behind the closed door.
“Harry always hated the spotlight. Neville can’t go anywhere without a reporter asking him for a story, or witches and wizards wanting an autograph. He’s taking it in stride, but Harry wouldn’t have. They would have harassed him too, and it would have broken him. He’d have become a recluse.” She smiled a wry smile.
He desperately needed a hot shower to wash away the fear and the memory of the black hole. It wasn’t the first time he’d dreamt it, either. It happened regularly now, every two-to-three weeks, and during the time in between, it plagued his subconscious. But this was the second time this week, which left Harry shaken and unsettled. What did it mean?
, he carefully slips them into his pocket. With a final wistful glance in the mirror, he Disapparates.
“But at what cost? I understand how important it is for you to remember. And I want to help you. There’s something you need to know.” Draco was quiet for a moment.
“Lucky guess.” Draco shrugged. “You bought all that candy at the cinema, I figured you had a sweet tooth.”
With each day that passed, Harry noticed that Petunia became increasingly restless. She had difficulty sleeping and was plagued by nightmares. Harry could sympathise—dreams of the vortex had become a near-nightly occurrence. By day he felt drowsy.
Just as he was turning to leave, the door flung open. Draco looked soft and gently dishevelled in his pyjamas and slippers, his hair lightly sleep-tousled. Harry’s heart fluttered at the sight.
She passed the paper through, and as she did, Harry felt a hand caress his backside, fingers dipping into the crevice. He struggled to maintain an even expression as he accepted the paper through the flames.
“I see. But if a wizard were to become ill while living as a Muggle—and don’t give me that look, I swear I’m not talking about me—then Muggle medicine would be of no use?”
“Harry, think of all the good you could do, the money you could raise. There’s still so much rebuilding to be done.” Her voice was earnest, her eyes pleading.
Draco took another deep breath, visualising the oxygen as it travelled from his lungs to his circulatory system, and throughout his body.
He wasn’t sure what to expect when he’d rung Potter’s number. A woman, surprised and suspicious, had quizzed him mercilessly before putting Harry on. Their conversation might have been awkward—he wasn’t lying when he said they’d never been friends—but they talked as though they were old chums. That’s how it ought to have been, had Hogwarts houses and Weasleys and blood status and psychopathic megalomaniacs not interfered. Perhaps fate was intervening now to right a wrong?
“You are a child,” Draco mutters while he grasps the skates. He sits down to put them on, and they magically adjust to the perfect fit. He stands on wobbly legs and Harry offers him his hand, which he gratefully accepts.
“Harry,” Draco spoke calmly, attempting to keep his voice even despite the obvious panic threatening to rise and take over.
The lights dimmed, and the projector flickered on, but Harry’s mind was elsewhere. He sat through the first preview and then excused himself to go buy snacks. Petunia gave him a crisp £10 note. He wasn’t hungry, but it was the perfect excuse to chat up the gorgeous platinum-haired cinema attendant he’d seen at the snack kiosk. Harry couldn’t explain it, but he felt inexplicably drawn to him. He was attractive, with flawless skin and sharp, chiselled features, but it was deeper than that. When their eyes met, something prickled up Harry’s spine and down his arms, like tiny electrodes. In that instant, he knew he had to get to know this person.
... showed up unexpectedly, from Lord-knows-where, and claimed to have no memory. He didn’t appear to know about Vernon or Dudley, but I wonder if it’s a trick? Is he after the insurance money?
The spell buzzed when the transfer was complete. Groggy and light-headed, Draco sat up and repeated the diagnostics. There was still a rapid pull towards the vortex, and Harry’s pulse was faster than it ought to be. Draco feared he knew why—patience was not one of Harry’s virtues.
“Well, I’m just putting the Beef Wellington into the oven, so I can’t leave the house. But you’re welcome to come over. You could stay for dinner.”
Of course, Robards chooses that moment to come back to his office. He takes one look at us, rolls his eyes, and sends us straight to the Third Floor of St Mungo’s:
They drove back to Little Whinging in silence. Draco wasn’t sure what to say or do. He knew he should just tell Harry the truth. About his parents. About magic. About their turbulent history. But there was a part of him that just couldn’t. This opportunity was just too good to miss, and Draco hated himself, just a little bit, for his weakness.
When Draco returned to the bedroom, the glass slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor. Harry lay perfectly still, pale like a porcelain doll, his chest neither rising nor falling.
Draco gathered his papers, duplicating each one for Hermione. She’d no doubt want to go over his research. He paused in the kitchen to do the washing up. The guest bedroom was a disaster; it was the least he could do. But if he were honest with himself, he also tarried in case Harry regained his memories—all of them.
Harry moaned loudly as Draco swiped his thumb over the slit, and another firm stroke had Harry’s hips bucking upward, seeking the warmth of Draco’s fist. Three more firm strokes and Harry shuddered and climaxed. Harry’s hand gripped tighter—Draco couldn’t hold back any longer; he came with a shudder, panting and mouthing kisses against Harry’s neck.
He sighs. “You shouldn’t Apparate while exposed to unknown potions, especially when you don’t know how the properties will react to magical travel.”
When Hermione returned, she placed the Elder Wand on the bedside table furthest away from Draco. He couldn’t blame her. They went over Draco’s notes again and he talked her through the finer points of the procedure. She asked questions and offered suggestions.
Harry had rented a luxurious beachfront cabin with a spectacular view. The interior was a fusion of wizarding elegance with Muggle-chic elements (currently avant-garde among the wizarding elite), but in his opinion, the Muggle aspects were overstated. The biscuit tin was a bit much. So was the
The scene shifted. Draco experienced a moment of relief, but it was short-lived when he realised where he was. At Hogwarts. During the final battle. Draco looked around, and it was as though he was seeing everything through a lens. Wherever he looked, the details appeared magnified.
They kiss deeply, lost in the moment, savouring the feel of lips and tongue, tasting each other. Harry’s tension melts away; he forgets about everything else until a throat clears in the doorway and they break apart.
is what she called it. But I knew then what it was—a poison, and it ruined my sister. Of course, she went and married another freak. Harry never stood a chance. We thought a heavy hand might help, but he was clearly a lost cause.
Hermione removed her feet from Draco’s lap. She sat up. “Draco, I don’t know if this is such a good idea. I haven’t told anyone about it.” She sighed. “In fact, I haven’t talked about it much since then. Other than with you.”
She took a deep breath, as though willing back tears. Quietly she said, “It was his birthday yesterday.” But then the tears fell, rolling down her cheeks, and Draco, caught off guard and unsure what to do, put his arm around her. Granger cried and shook with grief. They must have sat together like that for fifteen minutes, but then she realised where she was and who she was with. She straightened, reached into her purse, and dabbed at her eyes with a tissue.
Harry lumbered down the hallway to the loo. He turned on the shower, then examined himself in the mirror. Though the dark circles under his eyes suggested a restless night, his skin was flawless, and his cheeks were rosy. But who was he, really?
After a dozen cycles, Draco became frantic; his palms sweaty, his stomach in knots. He hadn’t felt this helpless and hopeless since the Dark Lord laughed as he announced Harry’s death. Desperation overwhelmed him—he would do anything for Harry.
, she’d added. It was a viable excuse, but Draco didn’t trust her—especially not after Hermione’s disturbing revelation.
Inside the cupboard, Harry took Draco’s hand in his. “Come with me. I’ll take you someplace better.”
“There was a brochure in the Quibbler.” Harry summoned it from his bag. “See, it looks beautiful. Sandy beaches, cabanas. ‘Tranquility on a silver platter.’ I thought it would be perfect. Luna said she had a fabulous time here.”
“Are you insane?” Draco cries out, moving away from Harry. His skates wobble; Harry glides forward and steadies him.
Artemis visited Draco’s flat frequently, usually while he was out, but he could tell she’d been there by the presence of a tail feather… or crumbs. He’d taken to leaving out pieces of spicy jerky in anticipation of her visits, and his library of books from the Manor continued to grow until it rivalled his collection of Muggle textbooks. He kept the magical books hidden away in the back of his closet, determined not to use them.
She looked around, and once she was certain they were alone, she continued in harsh, hushed tones. “You cast a spell on him. I know you did.”
Draco exhaled quietly. “No, that’s not it.” He placed a tender kiss on Harry’s forehead. “That was incredible. I definitely want to do that again. And soon.”
. Thinking about it makes me feel like I’ve ants crawling all over my skin, just like the time that hook-nosed freak cast that spell on me. His magic was greasier than his hair, and it clung to me for days like a film. I showered and showered and still didn’t feel clean. And Lily, infected by the same abnormality, just laughed. Shrugged it off like it was nothing.
“Artemis, I have a job for you. If you’re successful, I’ll order a beef masala with rice just for you.”
“Harry!” Hermione’s hiss snaps him out of his fantasy, and he finds himself staring into piercing grey eyes. He quickly glances down at his page while she chides, “Class ends in ten minutes and you’ve drawn nothing in the last five. Focus. Your drawing needs legs.”
I stop for coffee on my way downtown—Kreacher’s coffee is too watery, but I’ll be damned if I admit it to his face—and make it to my desk just as the cuckoo-clock chirps. Robards briefs us on the day’s assignment and pairs me with Malfoy. Again. I think he does it on purpose. He’s either got a sick sense of humour, or he enjoys the drama.
Today I introduced myself to the delightful couple who purchased batty old Mrs Figg’s house. I had to take a moment… They reminded me so much of myself and Vernon.
had been written by a Muggle who hadn’t been properly Obliviated following an encounter with a rampaging Hungarian Horntail.
Since then, Petunia had completely overhauled his wardrobe. He wondered if he had lost weight because all his old clothing was so big and fit poorly. Well, whatever the reason, he now had plenty to choose from, including jeans, trousers, button-downs, t-shirts, and hoodies. He laid out his outfit for the day: an emerald shirt and a smart pair of charcoal trousers.
Draco eventually recognised that his family were on the Wrong Side and following a madman. But it took Potter’s death to realise there was no Right Side. The so-called Light Side used Potter for their own purposes. They sent a seventeen-year-old into battle to fight their war, all because of a stupid prophecy. Cowards, that’s what they were. Everyone had blood on their hands. The wizarding world was filled with users and manipulators. So, Draco did the only thing that made sense: he removed himself from the equation entirely.
The silence extended indefinitely, punctuated only by the hiss of steam and the swirling of the mist, and when Harry couldn’t stand it anymore, he said, “Who are you?”
Slowly, Harry ascends the stairs to the attic. He opens the small door and is immediately overcome by the earthy aroma of decades-old dust and aged wood—cleaning has never been a priority for Kreacher. The door closes behind Harry with a gentle click. Sunlight filters through dirty windows, casting diffuse light over the stacks of discarded odds and ends.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Draco replied politely. She didn’t offer her hand, so he nodded instead. Petunia continued to stare daggers at him, and he didn’t know why; his manners were impeccable. This situation obviously required perseverance. They sat down, Harry and Petunia united on the couch, and Draco in the chair, which attempted to swallow him whole. He twisted uncomfortably as he sank deeper.
“Harry.” Draco put his hand on Harry’s jaw and waited for Harry to meet his eyes. “I’m the last person who would ever cast judgement on anything you say or do.”
“I don’t believe you,” Petunia countered. “My sweetums is perfect. Perfectly normal, and I couldn’t ask for anything more. As for you, you are the wrong sort. You’re no longer welcome in my house.”
Everything became exceptionally bright—blinding—and Harry lay back in his bed and closed his eyes. Wings delicately fluttered against his cheeks, and when Harry opened his eyes, he was in a room full of keys. Flying keys.
“It wasn’t. I was a coward. I should have healed them. I should have helped them escape. But I kept my head down and did the bare minimum.”
Afterwards, Draco rolled over, head propped up on an elbow. Filled with a fierce desire to protect, he’d said, “I know this is soon. Sudden, perhaps. But I’d really like it if you moved in with me. We spend so much time together anyway, I’d like to make it official.”
I turned the other cheek when he got tattooed. It was a phase; it would pass. But when he got the nose ring, I put my foot down. Just like Vernon would have done. I forbade him from seeing those never-do-well lowlifes he called friends. Do you know what he did? He laughed in my face and went out anyway. When I asked him where he’d been, he just said,
Harry must have slept—the clock read 12:15 pm—but he felt no more rested. All at once, a sense of urgency overcame him—the desire to remember burned. He knew he shouldn’t do it. He’d used it last night and ended up sleepwalking. But his forehead throbbed, and when he closed his eyes, he saw the swirling vortex from his nightmares. What did it mean? He needed to remember, and he knew from his numerous failed attempts that meditation wouldn’t help.
Harry was different from Potter. For one, there were no scowls or death glares directed at Draco. A part of Draco missed the heat generated from their rivalry. But, seeing Harry like this was also good, because this Harry was calm, relaxed, and open. The softness, the openness, felt intimate, like something Draco wasn’t supposed to see. He knew full well that Potter would never willingly show this side to Malfoy. It made Draco feel guilty, like an intruder stealing an experience that wasn’t meant for him.
“The whole situation has been a little fucked up, to say the least. But I remember it all, and I don’t want things to go back to how they used to be before the war.”
Petunia told Harry the reason she hadn’t spoken about his mother was because she didn’t want to speak ill of her. She was Harry’s mother, but she was wicked. She had an evil streak living inside her, and Petunia had hoped to save her, but she couldn’t be saved. Overcome by her wickedness, she had married someone just as corrupted. Perhaps it was for the best that he’d been raised by the Dursleys. Petunia was so kind, catering to his needs, and the stories she told him about Vernon and Dudley always brought a smile to his lips. It was just too bad he couldn’t remember them. Harry felt terrible for betraying her trust and had vowed never to go searching in her room again. She had smiled, patted his arm, and told him in the future to come to her. That she’d tell him anything he wanted to know.
Hermione put her hand on Draco’s arm. “You did what you had to do. You stayed alive. Then you left. Now, look at you.”
With another snap of fingers, an icy crystal goblet appears which Kreacher passes to Draco. The liquid contained within is colourless. Draco swirls it around, inhales the fragrant blend of spices, and drinks deeply. Despite the cold that radiates outward from the goblet, Draco swallows and feels warmth spread out in all directions, warming his body throughout. It’s the best thing he’s ever tasted.
Harry opened the bottle and scattered the wine-red petals into the water. He poured two glasses of champagne. They clinked glasses, then Harry leaned over to wash Draco’s back.
“Thank you, Harry. Ron will be by soon.” She tucked a loose strand behind her ear. “He’s still sore you beat him at chess, Draco,” she called out.
Petunia had been more than nice about it. Understanding, even. But once again Harry was wrong. He’d seen great kindness, tenderness, in the women in his vision. His mother—Lily.
He reaches the bottom and Harry and Teddy come skating — Draco blinks his eyes, yes, they are indeed skating — out of the sitting room, with Harry, dressed in his stag robe with its antlered hood, moving swiftly backwards while holding Teddy’s hands (he’s warmly dressed in his wolf robe). They skate down the narrow hallway, Harry winks at Draco as they pass, and the pair disappear into the dining room. Teddy laughs and Harry lets out a delighted
“If you’re referring to your drugs, then yes, I did. I should have been firmer with Dudley; I can see that now. Trust me, you’ll thank me later.”
A good night’s sleep—if you could call it that, he’d awoken after a few hours and paced the flat—had done little to calm Draco. In fact, he’d worked himself into a lather contemplating various scenarios. Probably not the cleverest move, but he was going to let Granger have a piece of his mind. How could they keep the knowledge of Potter’s existence to themselves? How selfish of them? The world—and Draco—needed hope following the fallout of the war.
“I know you’re its master. It’s how you repaired Harry’s wand.” Draco sighed, unsure of how much more he wanted to tell her. She would be livid—madder than she already was. “Harry’s been using LSD to help access his memories, only he never believed they were memories because he doesn’t believe in magic.”
Draco summons his fuzzy green dragon slippers, the matching hooded dragon robe, and pulls them on. They’re gauche and not befitting of a Malfoy, but Draco wears them anyway because they make Teddy smile. Definitely not because they’re warm and cosy.
She took a long sip and closed her eyes. “There were traces of your magic mingled in with Harry’s. I felt it.”
. Its intended use was to steal—not give—magic, but Draco worked the wand movement in reverse. Threads of shimmery gold, followed by silver, regal purple, emerald, sapphire, and bronze, rose like tendrils of smoke, stretching from Draco’s chest to Harry’s. Draco closed his eyes. He’d woven in an automatic
Hermione took a deep breath and closed her eyes. “If he’d have just come to me first… He must have been under his cloak—”
But Harry is such a good boy. I’d gotten a tad emotional following that ghastly letter, which is not Dudley’s fault, he’s clearly not of sound mind. Harry cancelled his plans with the Malfoy boy and spent the day consoling me. He sat with me while I made lunch, even offered to cook, but I shooed him away. It’s nice to be needed. Later, he accompanied me to the garden centre to buy new flowers. He planted them for me along the front walkway.
“This is the lounge,” Draco says casually. But there is nothing casual about the room; the furnishings are fit for royalty.
Draco opened the takeaway container and scooped rice and beef vindaloo onto a plate. He took a bite and continued to pace. Maybe it was a trick. Maybe Potter hadn’t died—they’d never found his body—and the Light Side had used his supposed death to further their agenda. Anger pulsed through Draco. Of course, more manipulation. He didn’t trust the Dark Side or the Light, but he’d believed in Potter, in his goodness and his decency. Draco had always desired to be more like him and had turned his back on magic in part because of Potter’s death. And now here he was, pretending not to know Draco and offering his friendship. Such irony. But to what purpose? This was too good to be genuine. What was he playing at? Draco didn’t appreciate being used or manipulated.
“I’m sorry, Draco. You work so hard, and I just wanted to treat you to a nice, relaxing holiday. We’ve had so little time together lately, what with my training schedule and all your overtime.”
. He’s filled out over the years, a side-effect of happiness, the stability of marriage, and perhaps too many late-night stakeouts with Ron accompanied by a box of jelly rolls to help pass the time. He surveys his profile—he’s greying at the temples, and there are fine lines at the corners of his eyes and mouth, put there by laughter with his husband and friends, by life well-lived.
I received a horrible letter from Diddy today. He’s obviously confused; undoubtedly surrounded by questionable influences. I have half a mind to pack my suitcase and bring him home by the ear. But Marjorie says he’ll come home in his own time.
“There’s one more thing we need.” He looked directly at Hermione. “A powerful conduit—we need the Elder Wand.”
Harry found a pair of scissors and cut a tab into four. He put one piece on his tongue and lay down in bed.
Harry crept down the hallway and entered Petunia’s room. He looked around—there was a vanity topped with a photo of her and Vernon, another with her, Vernon and Dud, and a new photo of her and Harry at the museum. Everything was orderly, not an item out of place. Harry wasn’t sure where to start, but he had to do something. He went to the chest of drawers, opened the top drawer, and immediately wished he hadn’t—his aunt’s knickers were not something he needed seared into his brain. He quickly searched the other drawers, trying hard not to look at the brassieres and stockings, and then moved on to the wardrobe. A small box on the top shelf caught Harry’s eye, and he carefully brought it down. Inside, he found a book.
Petunia smiled sweetly as she watched Harry leave. Once he’d reached the staircase, his footsteps muffled by the carpeted runner, her demeanour shifted from falsely chipper to icy cold.
Draco vanished the broken glass and water on the floor as he walked to his school trunk. Once unlocked, he rifled through the contents until he found what he was looking for. He placed the bezoar in Harry’s mouth and massaged his throat until he swallowed it down.
Diddy’s a good boy. He’s just made a mistake. One day soon he’ll realise it and come home. I just know it.
His stomach swirled, filled with slippery slugs, and his fingers burned as though alight with flames. When Harry looked down, red-hot fire ants covered his hands. They crawled over his skin, ascended his arms, climbed up his neck and onto his face, their tiny legs tickling and burning. One by one they disappeared into the crack in his forehead.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” she replies innocently and busies herself adjusting her tidy row of pencils.
As if reading his mind, Harry turned and pressed his morning wood against Draco’s thigh. Draco’s breath hitched, and Harry chuckled. He shamelessly ground his erection against Draco, and Draco sighed. Harry kissed him, slowly, deeply, effectively removing all thoughts from Draco’s mind. Harry laid on his back and pulled Draco on top of him, cupping his arse. Draco kissed him urgently, satisfying a deeply rooted need to claim and possess. Draco Malfoy had always wanted Harry Potter, even when he didn’t know how to show it—even when he knew Potter would never give him a chance. And now Harry—
Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry, slowly, deeply. Harry tilted his head to the side and leaned into the kiss, practically melting into Draco.
I’ve had trouble sleeping as of late. I keep having the same dream. I’m surrounded by Vernon, Dudley, and Harry. We’re one big, happy family. Then Vernon looks at me and laughs, as though he’s told a joke. I don’t know what he’s said, but I join in the laughter. He keeps laughing and laughing, shaking with mirth, and then he fades away to nothing while I scream.
Draco pulls back, and the look on his face is one Harry’s never seen before. “Do you really mean that?”
Hermione cast a series of spells, and a shimmery blue orb rippled over Harry. “It’s a medical-grade Stasis Charm,” she said. “It will keep him safe. For now.” She turned to Draco. “You have some explaining to do.”
Harry steps closer and sees miniature Eiffel towers, Fleur-de-Lis, gilded croissants and baguettes, wine bottles, the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre Pyramid.
“The war is over; I suppose it makes no difference if I tell you now.” Hermione bit her lip, and Draco nodded in encouragement. “Professor Dumbledore gave Harry, Ron and I a task, a dangerous mission, and I couldn’t risk Voldemort”—Draco cringed at the casual use of the Dark Lord’s name—“using my parents as leverage against us. So, I modified their memories and relocated them to Sydney.”
The woman, Petunia, gestured randomly, then lit a cigarette from a crumpled pack of Mayfair Superkings. She inhaled deeply, as though the smoke sustained her better than oxygen, then let the smoky tendrils waft slowly from her mouth. She fixed her icy glare at Harry.
But Harry stopped speaking, because the old man’s cloak darkened from the hem upward—as though he’d stepped in a puddle of ink—until it became pitch black. His face distorted, shifting and mutating until he had no hair and no nose—only slits for nostrils. Red eyes stared daggers at Harry, and a cold voice snarled,
The lights flickered again, and Harry stirred. “W’as happen’ng?” he said, his voice thick with sleep.
—and he felt as though all his bones were dissolving. Which made sense, because he was part of a potion. He was inside a giant cauldron in an old graveyard, surrounded by masked figures—Death Eaters; he recognised his father’s hair peeking out from his hood, ruffled gently by the wind. Cedric lay dead on the ground, and Harry—a younger Harry, his face rounder and fresh, not yet ready to shave—cried out in agony. Draco gasped. Beside him, Harry squeezed his fingers gently, a reminder that he wasn’t alone.
Draco huffed a sigh of relief when he saw Harry’s silhouette in the window. Even standing as far back as he could, his skin burned, and his ears rang unpleasantly like an itch that wouldn’t go away. But at least at this distance, he could breathe. He knew that would abruptly change unless he could get through to Harry.
Harry inhaled deeply. The ocean air was invigorating, the glittery sand between his toes felt divine, and Draco looked positively edible in his tiny red speedo. He was smiling even, their odd morning encounter washed away with brunch mimosas. Harry felt hopeful. Surely their rocky start (how was he to know the five-star restaurant was overrun by tiny dragons that stole the silverware?) was behind them and things could only get better from here.
They were in the eye of the storm. The windows rattled, photos banged against the wall, and Draco’s papers flew freely about the room, caught in the updraft.
It was unsurprising to find Harry’s magical core dangerously depleted, to the point where his body had shut down—the unplanned Apparition had used up valuable resources. But Draco could now see the source of the problem, which
Draco tiptoed back to bed—Harry, his gorgeous angel, slept peacefully, hair rumpled against the pillow. But what was going on beneath the surface? Drowsy, Draco curled up beside Harry and was asleep in minutes.
With a relaxed sigh, he entered the foyer. Harry was still holding his hand, and just like at the cinema he could feel Harry’s magic, present but muted. Having realised he was still holding Draco’s hand, Harry blushed and let go.
“That won’t be a problem.” He pulled Draco flush, threading his fingers through his silky hair, and grinding their clothed erections together. There were too many layers between them.
The next time Draco awoke, light filtered gently through the windows. It was a perfect morning, with Harry pressed against him—a welcome start to the day. But the previous night came flooding in, suffocating him.
Speaking to Potter on the telephone had quickly become a daily ritual. Every time he had to go through Petunia-the-Gatekeeper, he missed the privacy of using an owl (which, of course, was out of the question), but it was worth it to hear Harry’s voice. Draco could always tell when he was smiling as he talked, and he imagined the light in Harry’s eyes, and that dimple.
“You know what I want,” Draco purrs, infuriatingly self-assured. A jolt of arousal pulses through Harry.
“Of course she did.” Draco examined the brochure. “Did you read the fine print? This part here, on the bottom.”
He grins, smug and overly pleased with himself, but it doesn’t fill me with rage. The only thing I feel is burning desire.
“It’s not that. I want to.” Draco brushed a lock of hair out of Harry’s eyes and placed a chaste kiss on his lips, even though his cock was shouting at him to push Harry down and have him. “I really do. But—”
Secretly pleased with Draco’s commanding tone, Harry takes one step, then another until he looms over Draco, and straddles him. Nimble hands cup his arse as Harry claims Draco’s lips—Draco kisses like a dream, with fire and intensity. Skilled hands glide lovingly, with devotion, over every square inch of leather, and Harry’s cock plumps at the attention. He groans as Draco pulls him closer, grinding their erections together.
“Well, everyone deserves a second chance, including you. Why don’t you forgive yourself and move on?”
Heading out to Surrey to visit Harry Potter? Not something Lucius Malfoy would do… unless there was something in it for him. But while Draco’s intentions might be self-serving, he didn’t mean Harry any ill will.
Harry blinked, and the noseless man with the red eyes took his place, growing in size as though inflating.
Harry; he no longer had that carefree openness about him that had set Draco at ease. But, he wasn’t the same person he was before the war either. Draco couldn’t put his finger on it, but something was different.
Harry smiled. “I’m fine. Really. Now come here.” He went to unzip Draco’s trousers, but stopped stock-still when he caught sight of Draco’s chest—gashed and bloodied. In shock and horror, Harry swiftly undid his buttons. Draco’s chest was pale and unmarred. Harry exhaled quietly. He was losing his mind. There was no other explanation.
Draco laid out his papers on the table—the spell, the note to himself—and took three deep breaths. He sipped his tea. If he was lucky, it would still be warm when the procedure was complete.
Harry lathered up his body, ensuring to wash behind his ears, then rinsed himself free from soap and conditioner. He grabbed a towel—a fluffy pink one, the same colour as the roses in the garden—and stepped onto the equally fluffy bathmat.
We continue to dance. Malfoy’s arms are strong, and his hair is silky-smooth as it brushes against my skin. His lips move against my ear. “You do, I can tell.” With a quick movement disguised as a dance step, he pulls me against him, aligning our hips. I’m hard, and now he knows it. But, to my surprise, Malfoy’s equally aroused. Without a moment’s hesitation, he kisses me firmly on the mouth—he tastes of whisky and cigarettes—and I sigh softly. He nips at my lower lip as he pulls back, and there’s a wicked gleam in his eye. I shudder. I can’t help myself. His lips are shiny and he’s gorgeous.
He looks at me, his stormy grey eyes boring a hole into mine. “Did you not pay attention during potions class, you numpty?”
He’d finished tidying, had gathered his belongings, and was just about to depart when Hermione joined him.
Soon, Harry finds himself captivated by Malfoy’s nipples, so pink and delicious, and he wants to nip at them, flick them with his tongue. He shifts uncomfortably in his chair, his jeans suddenly too tight.
Harry was silent for a moment, then surged upward and captured Draco’s lips. When he pulled back, he said, “I might not remember who I was, but I am certain of who I am now. I know what I want—I want you. Memories or no memories, it makes no difference. You’re gorgeous, and funny, and being with you just feels right. Like it’s where I’m meant to be.”
“Serves you right. I’ll have you know multiple warning signs advised against leaving the compound without a tour guide.” Draco let out an exasperated sigh. “But no. You’re Harry Potter, the rules don’t apply to you.”
. Harry didn’t even believe most of what he saw. Draco knew he should tell him the truth. About everything. All of it.
“You are pure evil,” Draco sighs. “You know I can’t resist you like this.” He pulls Harry’s shirt out, undoes his trousers, and slides his hand in, teasing him over the fabric of his pants. “You know, I think the whole
Malfoy steps up onto the round platform and casually lets his robe slip to the ground. He adopts a pose, and Harry’s jaw drops. Draco Malfoy is a work of art.
Sunlight burst open around them, a halo formed by glimmering shades of amber, apricot, and rouge. They were flying, he and Harry, side by side, high above the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch…
After an enjoyable day, which included taking in an exhibit at the British Museum, a walk along the Thames, and a shared Knickerbocker Glory, they were driving through Knightsbridge when Petunia said, “It’s still early. Would you like to see a film?”
She also pushed through a tray with a tuna sandwich, a steaming hot cup of tea, and a pack of cigarettes. Harry sighed with relief. He’d finished his last pack, and his hand was growing twitchy.
Narcissa, elegantly dressed in a blue gown, eyes the couple, clearly amused. “It’s lovely to see you, Harry.” She nods at her son. “If you’re quite finished,” she says, her eyes twinkling, “dinner awaits.”
Harry snaps. What he wouldn’t give to hex Goldstein, cover him in boils, perhaps a severe case of Scrotal Pox. But in a room full of Muggles, he can’t risk it. Instead, he grabs Goldstein by the t-shirt and pushes him back against his desk, perhaps a little more forcefully than necessary. “That’s enough,” Harry fumes. “Shut your mouth or I’ll shut it for you. Permanently.” Goldstein looks terrified, and, of course, that’s exactly when the teacher walks in.
“Nice try, Potter.” Draco sends the wine and glasses back to the kitchen. “We’re still going.” He gets re-dressed — Harry reluctantly follows his lead — and casts an Ironing Charm over them both. He frowns. “We’d better change.”
Draco showered and primped in record time. He knew it was sappy, but he wore the same shirt and trousers he’d worn for their first date. Maybe it would bring him luck?
just left. They could have done something, but they didn’t. They provoked him and just disappeared. I called 999, and an ambulance came, but it was too late.
“Wonder how long it will last?” Harry asked. The pamphlet conveniently didn’t mention that fact, just that they were to remain indoors, and that they could order room service or help themselves to the Muggle-style mini-fridge.
Well, Draco wasn’t about to tell anyone he’d seen Harry Potter. For one, he had too many unanswered questions. Second, they wouldn’t believe him. Unless they already knew…
Sirens blared—deep, booming blasts that crescendoed, then gave way to shrill whistles. Harry glanced around. The resort was divided into two sorts—those who casually gathered up their belongings as though this was a routine occurrence, and those who were panicked and weren’t sure what it all meant. Harry and Draco fell into the latter group.
They rolled down the windows, and the wind swept through, messing up Harry’s hair so he looked more like the Potter from Draco’s school days, sending a surge of arousal through Draco. They soon arrived at one of Draco’s favourite spots and parked along the side of the road. They both got out; Harry stretched, and Draco admired the view. They walked along a narrow pathway, so close their shoulders bumped and their fingers brushed. Harry didn’t seem to mind, and before Draco could overthink it, he took Harry’s hand in his. Harry turned to look at Draco, and he immediately panicked. Fear flooded his insides—had he misread the situation? But a moment later, Harry grinned and squeezed his hand. They held hands as they walked until they reached a clearing beside a pond.
I took the boy to see Dr Vaughn today, because I’m a good person, and it needed to be done. Never let it be said that I didn’t perform my duty.
Draco suddenly had little appetite. Granger—Hermione—was suffering, and Draco could end it with a confession. He should tell her the truth—Harry Potter’s alive. But then Petunia’s voice played in his head.
For hours, Harry thrashed in his bed as the thing he had to recall got further and further away, like a locked door at the end of a never-ending hallway. Eventually, he fell into a fitful sleep. He awoke in the morning with a sentence on the tip of his tongue.
“It takes hard work to make something of yourself. I’ll help you.” She sounded as though she was doing him a favour.
Harry broke off the kiss, lips beautifully swollen and wet, eyes blown so dark only a ring of viridian remained. “I want you to fuck me,” he panted.
Harry’s initial excitement quickly faded. How was he supposed to let Draco in if he couldn’t leave his room? There was no way Petunia would let Harry out, and Hell would freeze over before she’d allow Draco inside. It was a hopeless fantasy. But at least Draco had thought of him. There was that.
Harry stayed awake for hours, floating among the colours, but at some point, he drifted off to sleep. It was the best sleep he could remember having.
He kept himself busy. He immersed himself in healing books, both magical and Muggle, and cleaned his flat from top to bottom twice over—every corner, nook and cranny shone. But he couldn’t cleanse the horrible feeling that grew in the pit of his stomach. As days turned into weeks, Draco resigned himself to the fact that Potter might never remember.
He cast a Healing Charm, and his skin knitted back together, leaving the lightning bolt scar. Hermione left the room, but Draco lingered. He looked at Harry, so beautiful, lying so peacefully. He bent down and kissed Harry’s forehead before he left.
But there was one problem: it required a conduit. Something powerful enough to channel and balance Harry’s magic.
When he opened his eyes, he wasn’t in his room. He was standing—lurching—outside the door to Draco’s flat. Bile rose in his throat as he clutched the doorframe for support. How did he get here? The journey felt instantaneous, the switch from his bedroom to the hallway, but more time must have elapsed.
Narcissa waves back, then returns her attention to Draco. “Shall I still come at 6 o’clock? Or do you perhaps need to reschedule?” She gives Draco a pointed stare that freezes him on the spot, her gaze colder than the surroundings. Draco stands still, horrified, burdened by the heavy weight of expectation.
Draco helped in the kitchen, pouring the wine and putting together a salad. If Hermione noticed he didn’t use magic to do so, she didn’t comment.
“I’ve been studying Muggle medicine,” he said. “I hope to start school next year to become a doctor, but I’ve already started reading ahead. I have some questions about magical ailments and Muggle medicine. Since you grew up Muggle, I thought you might be able to offer insight.”
Third, he used to have a cat, hence the cat flap on his bedroom door. Apparently Fluffy, who sadly died last year, was fiercely protective of Harry and would scratch and meow at the door until let in. Vernon had relented and installed a cat flap. This whole scenario surprised Harry—he felt more like a dog person. He’d love a big, shaggy, black dog who would jump up and lick his face.
Draco sighed and grabbed another sleeve of cups. “Well, he needn’t be such an arse. I’ve no interest in women.”
Draco gazed at Harry, drinking him in, like he was trying to memorise him. His eyes lingered on Harry’s lips, which gave Harry a boost of courage. “Look. I’m probably doing this all wrong. But you seem like someone I’d like to get to know better. Would you like to meet up sometime?”
“Potter-Malfoy,” Harry replied, then winced as Draco pulled the thread taut. A wave of Draco’s magic washed over him and Harry relaxed as the Freezing Charm took effect. Draco continued his work with precision.
There were no bright colours, only drab stone walls, and when Harry came to, he rolled off the bed and scrambled for the chamber pot. The stench of day-old urine assaulted his nostrils, and he was instantly sick, vomiting up slugs, just like the boy. He retched, and the slimy creatures slid out from his mouth, each one landing with a
In the afternoon, Petunia came back and pushed books and papers through the cat flap. “It’s high time you gave your future some consideration.”
He shuffled off the bed, wincing as he moved, and prised up the floorboard. But the space within was empty.
This is the first year he and Harry are hosting Christmas Eve dinner, which will be the only opportunity for Narcissa to spend time with Andromeda and Teddy. Everything has to be perfect; his mother has impossibly high standards.
“I’m sorry. I should have told you sooner. I shouldn’t have taken advantage...” Draco stood abruptly and backed away from the table, from Harry—no
Harry wants to drop to his knees and remove those sexy Santa pants with his teeth, let them fall to the floor while he grabs Malfoy’s cock and licks a firm stripe from base to tip. He wants to swirl his tongue around the head, taste Malfoy’s precome, grip his thighs so hard he’ll leave marks, swallow him down, let him fuck his mouth until his eyes water and saliva drips down his chin.
“Harry, we don’t know how it might be affecting you, or your ability to get your memories back. I still feel tingly all over.”
No such thing as magic… Everything would be so much simpler if that were the case. Vernon would still be alive. My sweetums would still be home. We’d still be happy.
Harry knew he spoke the truth. Draco was a man with secrets so dark he could barely face them himself, and Harry realised perhaps he could confide in him without judgement.
“I don’t know how Harry came back from the dead, or how he ended up at the Dursleys, but I believe that thing inside his head is the aftermath of the Dark Lord’s Horcrux. It contained Dark Magic for so long, and once it was no longer needed—”
The next day, Robards calls him down to the DMLE basement, to the morgue. Draco’s body washed ashore that morning, far too late to get a magical signature. Draco had listed Harry as his next of kin, so he’s called in to identify the body.
He shook his head. “I can’t come back.” He tapped his Dark Mark. “Some things you can’t come back from.”
They kissed until the shadows grew long. Draco, content, laid back and folded his arms behind his head.
As the steam billowed and fogged the mirror, a shiver ran down his spine. There was something about the image that was familiar, yet unpleasant. He shook his head and quickly got into the shower.
Today, while Harry was outside mulching the roses (he’s such a good boy) and I was doing the washing up, he looked through the window at me and smiled. He’s so innocent, so eager to please. Why didn’t I ever see it before?
The peacocks shrink and one-by-one leap into the tree. They scurry about the branches and peck at the popcorn garlands. Draco laughs a hearty laugh. “It’s warmer in here, and they have plenty of food. I think they like it.” The peacocks arrange themselves, evenly spaced as proper ornaments should be, and fan out their tail feathers. To Harry’s delight, they rattle their feathers in unison. They make such an unusual sound, and the way the light reflects off their white, iridescent plumage is breathtaking.
“No matter what happens, I want you to know I love you.” He tipped up Harry’s chin and pressed a tender kiss to his mouth, savouring the taste and feel of those soft lips.
“I have no idea.” Quite frankly, Harry didn’t care. He spelled the curtains closed. “Now, where were we?”
“For now.” Draco turned Harry around to face him and raised an eyebrow at his apron: Gryffindor red, with cartoon Chelsea buns and the caption,
whispered in his ear. He contemplated moving, but he knew no matter where he went, the memories would follow.
Petunia pressed her lips together and narrowed her eyes. Surrounded by shades of pink and cranberry, she reminded him of that hideous cow Umbridge. Draco’s lip curled in disgust as he remembered serving the vile creature. Was this an inquisition?
There came a tapping at the window in the main room, and Draco carefully slipped out of bed. He walked to the window, which opened on its own just as he thought to open it. Artemis flew in. She carried no letter, only a small bottle attached to her leg. A Calming Draught. Draco gratefully accepted the potion, tipped his head back, and drank it all down. The cooling relief spread throughout his body and settled his core.
“Not that I’m aware of.” Harry pulled his hand back and shoved them both into his pockets. This clearly wasn’t going well. He considered going back to the film without the snacks, but Draco’s eyes softened.
Hermione, with obvious excitement, rushed to fill him in. “You’re all right. We’re at my parents’ house.”
The trip is pointless. Healer Granger (I have to call her that when she’s on duty) looks overly amused. I suspect she’s enjoying our situation a little too much. She assures us the effects will wear off in 24-48 hours and sends us on our way. We argue over whose place to go to, and eventually end up at Grimmauld Place. Kreature is beside himself with glee, offering his services to Malfoy. The git seems to enjoy it, too.
Draco’s eyes widen. He suddenly remembers how much there still is to do. Christmas, once a peaceful time, has deteriorated into a chaotic mess requiring skilful navigation and multiple meals in separate locations. Andromeda refuses to be in the same room with Lucius (the feeling is mutual) and Lucius refuses to set foot in Grimmauld Place or acknowledge his relationship with Harry.
Harry examined himself in his bedroom mirror. He felt like a different person. Did he look any different? His hair stuck up in all directions. He’d gone to smooth it, but Draco, with a hand on his arm, had asked him to leave it. Said it looked
“Thirsty,” Harry gasped. Draco didn’t think Harry had enough magic left to Apparate again, at least not without resting, so he went to the kitchen to fetch a glass of water and make a cold compress. Draco wondered how this had happened in the first place. Trust Harry Potter to accidentally Apparate.
The potion bubbled, the surface glinting like diamonds, far more beautiful than something so Dark should be, and another Death Eater—Wormtail—came carrying a bundle. It looked like a baby, but when Wormtail pushed back the hood, the figure within had slits for eyes. Draco stared into them, felt them pierce his soul, and the Dark Mark burned. It had been nearly four months since he’d felt that sensation, and he’d hoped to never feel it again. He whimpered helplessly.
Petunia pursed her lips. “Well, it’s not my cup of tea. But I can’t say ‘no’ to you. Especially not on your birthday.”
She looked at him sternly. “Draco, this is a major violation of countless hospital guidelines. We should take him to St. Mungo’s straight away.”
When Draco finally felt calmer, more centred, he cast diagnostic spells—the ones he’d seen Madam Pomfrey use countless times in the hospital wing. The ones he’d used on the prisoners inside the Malfoy dungeons…
Draco turned onto the suburban lane lined with identical houses and pulled up outside number four, Privet Drive. He glanced in the mirror, adjusted his collar, smoothed down his hair, and made sure there was nothing between his teeth. He couldn’t be certain, but when they spoke on the phone, he got the impression Harry was attempting to flirt with him. Of course, he might have misunderstood, his judgement clouded by wishful thinking. Nevertheless, he’d packed a picnic basket and a blanket, just in case things took a romantic turn. It never hurt to be prepared.
Draco’s jaw clenched and his pulse raced—he could not lose Harry. Just as he was about to cast again, Harry’s chest slowly rose and fell, and it sounded like… like he was snoring. As though he was asleep, and this had all just been a bad dream. It certainly felt like one to Draco. Slowly, he exhaled, letting relief course through his veins, willing his heart rate to slow and his head to clear.
Harry slowly walks around to the back of the platform, only to be confronted with a fact he’s already suspected: Malfoy’s just as attractive from behind. His pert arse, bisected by the tiniest hint of red velvet attached to the elastic belt, is the most delectable thing Harry has ever seen. Harry wants to grab those perfect globes, part them, lick between them, make Malfoy whine. He’s snapped out of his reverie by Goldstein.
Malfoy leans in and a shiver travels down Harry’s spine as he whispers into Harry’s ear. “I wasn’t cold, I was preoccupied. You made it exceedingly difficult to focus. I rarely resort to Legilimency, but you were broadcasting your thoughts so loudly I couldn’t help myself. I’ll have you know, every single one of your thoughts, all those things you wanted to do, were positively filthy. You most definitely are on Santa’s Naughty List.”
“Off you go, Artemis. I’ve nothing to send.” He urged the owl outside, and she left with a ruffle of feathers and an indignant hoot. With a heavy heart he added the letter, unopened, to the growing pile. There was nothing more she could possibly say. Father was in Azkaban, where he belonged, and his mother’s letters were all varied versions of her begging him to come home, dangling rewards like jewels in front of a dragon, gilded promises if he’d just return. But there was nothing that could make him go back. Not now—not ever. He would keep the chocolates though; they were his favourite.
Harry cringes when he sees Bellatrix’s menacing picture on the opposite side of the tree. Draco frowns and turns the photo around. He ushers Harry out, down the hallway, and into the main entrance with the double staircase.
He turned to leave, but Potter caught him. Draco looked down to his hand, gently grasped in Potter’s, then up to Potter himself. His expression was hesitant, sheepish. But his dimple popped, which did unfair things to Draco’s insides.
“Because it might be, Harry. When you get your memory back, there’s a good chance you’ll want nothing to do with me.”
“Because I thought you could use a moment to calm down before we encounter my parents.” Draco takes Harry’s hand and urges him forward. “Also, because I want to show you all the trees.”
He pulled out the small sealed bag. It held two squares, each tab adorned with a technicolour aeroplane like the one on Lenny’s business card. According to Lenny, it was a mix of LSD and MDMA.
He lit a cigarette and took a deep drag as he examined himself in the mirror. Dark circles stood out, indicating his lack of proper sleep, and there was ink smeared on his cheek from sleeping on his hand. But his forehead… The left side of his forehead, usually flawless, contained a small fissure—a pale pink mark in the shape of a lightning bolt. What had happened? Had he knocked his head and not remembered?
But that didn’t stop Draco from trying… one of these times he’d get through… if he timed it just right.
“Kreacher has been working on a special menu for this evening. Eight courses of gastronomic delights — warming foods served in a cool environment.”
Immediately, the ringing began in Draco’s ears. His skin burned; his lungs constricted. With her welcome rescinded, the wards reactivated. Petunia smiled as he took several steps back until his symptoms eased.
“I thought you’d never ask,” Draco replied with a cheeky grin. He strode forward and scaled the trellis, muttering curses at the thorny roses with every handhold. Harry laughed. It was a weak laugh, but good to hear.
Whatever it was, it was a problem to be solved later. More pressing was the matter of Harry’s magic—there was little left to drain. But Draco had an idea.
The tree blends in with the décor so well that Harry doesn’t see it at first. But once he does, he can’t unsee it. Like the room, it’s decked out in varying hues of lavender, aubergine, plum; covered in ribbons, garlands, and baubles. So much purple.
Anger jolted through Draco—had she just called him a freak?—but her statement snapped him back to reality like a Stinging Jinx. She knew who he was and could ruin everything. His mind swirled. It made sense that she would be angry and have a hatred towards wizards. They’d used Harry, treated him as nothing more than a pawn in their war. Of course his aunt would be suspicious and protective.
He is surprised the following Monday, when he stops by Draco’s work—a shady apothecary in Knockturn Alley, the only place willing to hire a reformed Death Eater (to prepare ingredients, not to brew)—and finds out that Draco hasn’t been to work in over a week. Harry knows how much that job means to him. With an uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach, he Apparates to Draco’s flat. But he’s not there.
Draco’s translucent face illuminates with the light from Ron’s Patronus. Harry doesn’t even remember what the case was about, just Ron’s urgent plea for backup.
he tensed. He’d assumed he was alone in the house as he’d heard no other noises until now. There came another
There’s no response, which doesn’t surprise him. Draco opens the other door leading out into the hallway. Nevermind the bathtub; ice and snow cover every surface of the house. Have the Temperature Control Charms been deactivated? Is the Central Core degrading? Draco shakes his head and mutters expletives under his breath.
The door bursts open and a middle-aged woman, with wild hair that contrasts with her tidy peacoat, comes bursting through. “So sorry I’m late,” she exclaims. “I’m glad you’ve started without me.” She smiles at Malfoy, “Drake, always a pleasure,” then looks around the room. “I see some fresh faces and some familiar ones.” She nods at Hermione. “Everyone, be sure to get up and look at Drake from all angles. It will help with your final product.” She drops her coat onto her chair and heads for the door. “I’ll be right back, just need to photocopy the handouts.”
“Look, I’m sorry if I said or did something to upset you.” Harry looked at Draco so earnestly it broke his heart.
The Dark Lord announced he’d killed Harry Potter—which meant he’d also killed the Horcrux residing within—and he must have been telling the truth because when Neville slew him, he stayed dead.
When Harry awoke, his head pounded fiercely. His limbs were heavy, like he’d walked a hundred miles, his chest thick and tight, as though he’d emerged from a blazing building. He couldn’t remember how he’d gotten into this state. Had he been to a party last night? In fact, the more he thought about it, he found he couldn’t remember last night at all. Alcohol must have been involved then. While he couldn’t remember the events leading up to this morning, he was certain his name was Harry—Harry Potter. The knowledge was inherent, but it was the only thing he knew for sure.
“Don’t you dare.” Draco smirks, and there’s a wicked gleam in his eye. “Allow me.” He pulls his wand from his holster and Harry feels a ripple of magic—fiery and intent—around his crotch, followed by a breeze. Harry looks down; Draco’s transfigured his flying trousers into arseless chaps. Harry’s completely on display for Draco’s viewing pleasure. If his ardent expression is anything to go by, Draco is exceptionally pleased by his spellwork—he looks like a Kneazle with a saucer of cream.
“I don’t know!” His voice reverberated throughout the platform. The mist reacted, swirling into a cyclone of colours—scarlet and emerald, indigo and lemon, chartreuse and orchid—with Harry centred in the eye of the storm.
Reluctantly, Harry rises. “I’ll go put these back. Meet me in the kitchen and we’ll make dinner, yeah?”
Except it’s difficult. Malfoy’s nipples. Were they always so pebbled? So hard? They must have been. Harry realizes the room is a little drafty. Malfoy must be cold, and that’s why his nipples are hard. Discreetly, Harry sends a wandless Warming Charm in his direction.
And with those words Draco spilled, wave upon euphoric wave rippling outwards as he became lost to the sensation. Harry shuddered, the wetness between them growing as Harry panted against Draco’s neck.
In another life, one in which Potter would never consent to being alone in the wilderness with Draco, he would have Summoned the picnic basket from the car. Instead, he said, “Wait here,” and left a very confused Harry beside the water.
Lenny was in an interesting sort, not much older than Harry. He was charismatic, and easily dispelled Harry’s worries, both qualities surely an asset in his line of work.
“We can’t have Mother and Aunt Andromeda here like this.” Draco pinches the bridge of his nose and prays for patience. Everything is a disaster and is not going according to plan. He remembers to breathe. In and out.
Draco chuckled as Harry got down on his hands and knees, so he was only visible from his shoulders up—better to chat and easier to cover up his nakedness. He wiggled his arse, just to torment Draco; the apron strings tickled his bare skin.
“I’m sure the pleasure is all mine,” she said, her voice falsely saccharine. “Would you care for some tea?”
With each memory and wisp of magic siphoned back into Harry, the storm grew smaller and quieter, contained within Harry’s body. Not all the colours were beautiful; some were very dark indeed.
“Draco, you and I are about to sit down to dinner. Don’t you think we can move on to first names?” With a grin, she accepted the bottle.
“Maybe next time you’ll listen to reason and I won’t have to stitch you up with the hotel sewing kit.” Draco shook his head. “Honestly, who keeps their sewing kit inside a biscuit tin?”
“It was. We were ambushed at Godric’s Hollow, and during our escape, my curse went astray. Broke Harry’s wand clean in half. For months he had to borrow mine—he was pretty sore about it too, not that I could blame him. But he kept the pieces inside the mokeskin pouch Hagrid had given him.” She left the room, and when she came back she had a small brown pouch with a drawstring. “He gave this to me before he—” Her eyes grew watery, and she swallowed.
Petunia sniffed. “Well, you shouldn’t. Your mother was wicked, and the same wickedness runs through him. I can tell.”
Harry looked out his bedroom window into the garden. Petunia was busy tending to her roses, her painted rose teacup at her side, a cigarette hanging delicately from her mouth. Once she got started, she could be out there for hours…
Harry’s eyes met Hermione’s. “Hmmm, reveal myself to wizarding Britain by attending a Ministry-sanctioned fundraiser. No, thank you.” Draco’s tongue circled Harry’s rim, and Harry felt the vibrations as the git chuckled.
“But it seems there was one more Horcrux we hadn’t counted on.” She got up and left the room. When she returned, she had Harry’s mokeskin pouch in hand. She pulled out a note, one she hadn’t shown him before. She let Draco hold it, and he instantly recognised Harry’s messy handwriting.
Harry skates closer and puts his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Hello, Narcissa. Everything is as it should be. We’re delighted you’ll join us.”
Hermione’s hair whipped in the gale-force winds; she nodded. The bed shook, but they maintained their positions on either side. Their eyes met, and in unison, they began the incantation.
Draco chuckled, glad to see Harry was still himself. He looked deeply into verdant eyes, so bright, so beautiful, his attention only wavering to appreciate Harry’s dimple as it popped. Draco’s heart fluttered.
Draco plants a small, tender kiss on Harry’s left arse cheek. Harry’s so overcome with the sweetness of the gesture that he’s caught off guard when Draco dives in and licks a firm stripe from his balls, up and over his perineum, across his opening.
Harry runs his fingers through Draco’s hair, tucks a damp strand behind his ear. He nods. “All right. But I expect to come back here afterwards to warm up.”
Harry sighed. “They have Neville; they don’t need me.” Draco slowly pressed his tongue inside; Harry inhaled sharply and closed his eyes.
Cautiously, Harry peered into the living room and inhaled the musty scent of alcohol, cigarettes, and dust. He instantly relaxed, his shoulders releasing the tension they’d been holding when he saw it wasn’t a burglar. A middle-aged woman, petite and bony, with a long neck and short hair, stood by the fireplace with her back to Harry. Was this his mother? Her knuckles became white against the mantlepiece as she examined the row of family photos. When she raised her hand, Harry flinched—he didn’t know why. He watched her with intense scrutiny, wondering whether she meant to shove the photos or lash out in some other way.
Many times, Harry opened Draco’s meditation book and sat down with intention. He attempted to empty his mind—through willpower, determination, and then desperation—but his thoughts continued to swirl and consume. The more he tried to relax, the less he could.
Draco exhales, long and slow, as though preparing himself for a feast. Hot breath ghosts over Harry’s entrance, and his body thrums with Draco’s magic as a Cleansing Spell washes over him. The intoxicating scent of lavender and rosemary lingers in the air.
“There,” Draco said, as he finished the last stitch. “I’ve transfigured the thread so it will dissolve in three days. Do try not to overexert yourself and undo all my hard work.”
Harry tiptoed along the hallway. He snagged a cricket bat from one of the other upstairs rooms. The bedroom was the exact opposite of the one he’d woken up in; so messy it amazed him that anyone could find anything in it. Slowly he crept down the stairs, avoiding a step he knew was creaky. He paused and shook his head. The house was both strange and familiar at the same time. Or maybe the house was familiar, but he was strange in it?
“This might be a good option for you. After I left home, I began a daily meditation practice to help me relax and to help manage the nightmares. But I’ve also read that meditation can enhance dream recollection and assist with recovering lost memories.”
When they eventually pull apart, Draco looks wrecked: his skin, deeply flushed; his hair, tousled; his shirt, horribly wrinkled. Harry’s sure he doesn’t look much better. Draco casts
. He bows at Draco’s feet, then turns to the ice-encrusted table and busies himself with adding place settings and festive decorations. He snaps his fingers and snow falls in large, fluffy flakes all around them, and yet somehow the air feels pleasantly warm. It’s like being inside a snow globe.
“I’m fine. I can take care of myself.” Potter shifted from foot to foot and looked uncomfortable, as though he had something to say but didn’t know how to go about it. The awkwardness between them was stifling.
Foiled yet again by Draco Malfoy. Piers and Marjorie came around for tea and Harry was out… visiting
“That I do. I love all sweets, except mint-flavoured. Can’t stand that.” Harry winced and rubbed his forehead, right where his scar should have been.
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. Petunia continued to glower, but the intensity was undermined as she swayed and continued to cling to the chair. Harry realised she was three sheets to the wind. From her dishevelled appearance, Harry suspected this wasn’t the first time. He gestured to the fireplace, to the shards of glass scattered along the floor.
Artemis tapped at the window to be let out, making a show of her helplessness. Draco rolled his eyes. She’d managed to get in, and he was certain she could get out, too. But he played along and opened the window. She ruffled her feathers and flew out into the sunshine.
“I don’t know how to explain this. I know that most of what I see and experience when I trip isn’t real, but I saw my mother’s face once. So, I know there must be some truth, memories perhaps, interwoven with the rest. I feel like if I keep tripping, I might one day unravel it all and solve the mystery of who I am.”
“Why are we doing this?” Harry asks, straightening his tie as he frowns at his reflection. He’s been dreading this all day. All week.
After a moment she said, “It didn’t work out. Bad timing. After the war, with Fred and Harry gone… My parents…” The silence stretched between them; then she dabbed her mouth with her napkin. “There’s this expression. They say that misery loves company. But, sometimes too much misery is really just—”
They enter the dining room and Draco stumbles — Harry catches him — because he suddenly remembers they are hosting tonight. But how can they, with everything encased in ice? They’ll have to cancel, and it will be yet another thing he’s failed at. His father, although not invited, will never let him live it down.
Draco pants and writhes beneath Harry, his arms casually folded behind his head, his long platinum hair fanned out over the pillow. He practically glows against Harry’s dark bedspread. A bead of sweat forms at his brow, his cheeks are deliciously flushed, and his eyes, blown with arousal, stare into Harry’s. He parts his plump lips and Harry can’t help but lean down to kiss him, give him a quick swipe of tongue, as he sets into a pounding rhythm.
With shaky hands, Draco unfolded and read the letter. Harry had woken up early, and Draco was sleeping so peacefully Harry hadn’t wanted to disturb him. He hadn’t told Petunia he was going out, and knew she must be out of her mind with worry. So, he slipped out and planned to take the train home. He said he’d be in touch later and signed the letter ♡H.
. Except it wasn’t. Because he was an inch taller. Because his hair wasn’t messy, and his clothes were stylish and fit him.
“Now we wait. Whatever shall we do?” Harry waggled his eyebrows suggestively. Draco smirked as Harry pushed him back onto the bed and straddled him, kissed him, consumed him. Draco sighed as their tongues slid together. He wrapped his arms around Harry, pulling him closer, feeling a hardness push against his own. Draco groaned at the spark of pleasure, centred at his groin, that radiated outwards electrifying every inch of his body. Harry kissed down Draco’s neck, pausing to nip at the tender spot near his ear, while they made quick work removing unnecessary clothing. Draco rummaged in the drawer of his bedside table for lube.
Harry was like a somnambulist; such an apt term for his existence at Privet Drive, gliding through each day in a dreamlike state, oblivious to the imminent danger. Draco yearned to guide him to safety without waking him prematurely. Draco hadn’t seen it initially, but he couldn’t look away now.
He reaches into his pocket, and with a nonverbal spell restores his gifts to their proper size. “I brought you some flowers, and those chocolates you like so much.” His voice only wavers slightly. He holds them out, then lets them slip through his fingers into the darkness below, just like Draco all those years ago. The wind and the waves are loud; he doesn’t hear them land.
“What about the Canary Islands? Or Tuscany? Machu Picchu?” Draco punctuated each suggestion with a kiss, then nipped Harry’s earlobe.
“That’s brilliant. It took great courage to do that. But you’ll figure it out. I know you will. Much to my chagrin, you’ve always been at the top of the class. You’re very clever and accomplished.”
Draco squared his shoulders. He wouldn’t spend his life hiding in the loo; he could deal with this. He went back to the kiosk, put on a fresh batch of popcorn, and affixed the Malfoy charm as he greeted the first in the queue.
“For my failures, they sent me to assist the house-elves for a month. After helping in the kitchens, I’d go down to the dungeons and examine the prisoners. I didn’t heal them completely—that would rouse suspicion—but I healed them enough to keep them from dying. That’s when I realised I wanted to be a healer. A doctor.”
Draco picked Harry up and carried him over to the kitchen worktop, setting him down gently and reclaiming his lips. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco, his erection straining madly against his apron—he needed more friction. Of course, Draco pulled back. He glanced at the oven, his expression smug.
Kreacher looks at Draco, obviously awaiting his reaction. When Draco smiles and nods, Kreacher looks impossibly pleased. He bows, then skates a lap around the room, adjusting the decor. With a parting pirouette, he heads back to the kitchen.
Draco swallowed. “Earlier, I performed a transfer—he would have died without it.” He buttered his cake without looking up at Hermione.
’ he’d felt when walking towards the living tree or traipsing through the dense forest with the kaleidoscope of colours. He could taste the sweet, floral aroma… “Honeysuckle and lavender,” he whispered, then shuddered as a jolt of pleasure rocked through him. Draco gripped his thighs firmly as he sucked harder and faster. Soon Harry’s orgasm rippled through him, an eruption of spectral colours. Draco tenderly stroked and suckled him through the aftershocks. When Harry opened his eyes, the sky was full of stars, and it was like he was seeing them for the first time.
Draco pulls a box from his suit pocket. When he opens it, a platinum band, engraved with the Malfoy family crest, glints in the moonlight.
She gripped the wand tighter, as though clinging to a lifeline. This confirmed it for Draco, the reason it seemed familiar—it was Potter’s. Eleven inches, holly, with a phoenix feather core. She wouldn’t have Potter’s wand unless he truly was dead. Except he wasn’t. Was he?
“Darling, look at you,” he says reverently. He licks his lips and gestures for Harry to turn around.
Harry and Lianne did not hit it off. I can’t fathom why. Lianne was delightful, thrilling us with tales from the floral arrangement class she’s been taking. Of course, Harry was polite, as I’ve raised him to be, but I could tell he was only feigning interest.
Harry got up carefully and staggered to his desk. It had been empty the last time he’d seen it. Now, in the centre, sat a paper crane. How did it get there?
Lenny said it should kick in straight away, but it didn’t. Harry looked down at his hands; they trembled. He willed them to keep steady, but they wouldn’t cooperate—he needed a cigarette. But as he reached for his pack, he felt a tingling sensation in his fingers. The hairs stood on the back of his arms. The lights flickered, and Harry felt a rhythmic, pulsing sensation throughout his body. A flash of fear flooded through him, followed by a sharp jolt.
Harry smiled as Draco sauntered in, crowding against Harry, pressing a kiss to the back of his neck.
Draco leans in, licks Harry’s left nipple through the jersey while he pinches the right, and the sensation—sharp pressure, the damp fabric clinging to his skin—is overwhelming. Draco catches Harry’s nipple between his teeth and gently rolls the nub—Harry inhales sharply—before releasing it.
Had he become frustrated and given up? Was he using LSD again? Was that why Harry kept cancelling their dates?
When Draco unfolds his arms, Harry catches a glimpse of the Dark Mark, crosscut by old scars… and a row of fresh cuts. He’s about to say something, ask him about it, but Draco wraps his arms and legs around Harry and pulls him closer.
Petunia poured the tea, and, with a bit of shimmying, Draco found he could manoeuvre out of the malicious chair to add milk, sugar, and help himself to a chocolate digestive.
, then staggers backwards, banging his knee against a chair. He vomits into the bin. Twice. Robards gives him the rest of the week off.
They went to the kitchen, and Draco filled her in about how they met, Harry’s lack of memory, and the time they spent together—he left out the more salacious details.
“Prat,” Harry said, and smacked Draco’s arse with a tea towel. Draco’s eyes flared, and Harry felt considerably cooler—Draco had vanished his t-shirt and joggers, leaving him in nothing but the apron. Draco leaned forward, and just as their lips connected the Floo roared to life. They sprang apart as Hermione’s face appeared in the green flames.
He took three deep breaths, then decided sleep was unlikely. There was only one thing for it. He rolled out of bed and prised up the floorboard. He now knew the bottle contained LSD. After placing a drop of liquid on his tongue, he laid back in bed and waited. Perhaps exhaustion and elation sped up the process because it all happened so fast. Power surged down his arms, extending to his fingers where it prickled like tiny explosions, and for a brief moment, he thought the lights flickered. But it didn’t happen again. Harry could understand how some people might think they had superpowers or were invincible, but he knew better.
Draco stared at Potter. He’d carried a torch for him for years but kept it carefully hidden behind Malfoy poise. It was fine. Perhaps not satisfactory, but manageable. However,  knowing what Harry’s skin felt like pressed against his own, knowing what that messy coal-black hair felt like threaded through his fingers, knowing what Harry felt like
Harry didn’t need to be told twice. He let his robe slide down, kicked off his swimming trunks, and stepped into the tub. He leaned back against Draco, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
It had been three weeks since Potter’s magic—and memory—had been restored. Draco had taken to calling him
While the owl ate, Draco penned his letter. If he was to sort this out, there was only one person he could ask. She would know better than anyone.
“To anyone else, but Mother will know. She has sharp eyes. If she were an Animagus, she’d be an eagle.”
,” she cast, protecting Longbottom from the Dark Lord’s wrath. The Dark Lord cast—the curse bounced off the invisible protective barrier—and just as he was about to cast again, Hermione hit him with—
Kirk narrowed his eyes at Draco and Draco scowled back. Jess prodded Draco’s leg with her foot. “You two need to get over yourselves.”
Draco sighed and sat down on a cushioned bench opposite Potter. The table was rectangular with slats of wood stained a tasteful stone grey. The teapot was navy blue, painted with gold irises—it went well with Potter’s sweater. Draco made himself look up, and he found Potter staring back intently.
“No, it’s not yours anymore. When Harry took your wand at Malfoy Manor, the Elder Wand switched allegiance, which is why it never worked properly for Voldemort. During the battle, when we were inside the castle, Harry came around a corner and startled me. I expected to be attacked, so I disarmed him.”
“Oh, fuck, it’s starting for me too,” Harry gasped, and Draco felt the familiar spark of Harry’s magic. Harry, however, seemed unaware of it. He rolled to the side, interlaced their fingers, and gave Draco a gentle squeeze.
Draco slowly awakens and shivers. The air is chilly, and the blanket has slipped, leaving his shoulder exposed. He pulls up the covers, burrows deep within, and wonders if the window has been left open. He turns to Harry to complain. To his surprise, Harry’s not in bed. Perhaps Teddy’s had another nightmare? Overall, he’s a happy, well-adjusted kid. But he often has nightmares, which Harry assures him is perfectly natural for his age. Draco hopes he’s right. He rolls onto his back and sighs. It’s Christmas Eve day, their last day with Teddy before he goes back to Andromeda’s.
Hermione’s hand shook, and so did the room. Draco placed his hand on hers. Together, they concentrated, bringing Harry’s magic closer to the rift. The buzzing amplified, ringing unbearably like the wards of Privet Drive.
Forty minutes later, Draco parked on a quiet street in Hampstead. He approached the quaint, three-story home, with a bottle of Pinot Noir tucked under his arm. The door opened before he could knock.
“That’s right. Not a thing. And I intend to keep it that way. If you want to be a part of his life, then you must agree. And this stays between us.”
When Harry looks down, he sees Draco has already restored his Quidditch trousers, his hands still cupping Harry’s arse. Unexpectedly, Harry’s stomach growls, reminding him it’s time for dinner.
“A lot, Harry. But this isn’t about me. It’s about you. You’re in danger, and I need to help you. I think I’ve figured out how to fix this”—he gently touched Harry’s scar, angry and red—“and restore your memory.”
Harry brought Draco’s inner arm to his lips and kissed the Dark Mark, ran his tongue along the sinuous snake. The simple act should have been erotic but seemed sacrilegious—wrong in so many ways.
Harry cleared his throat. “Actually, I don’t. I’ve told you. I don’t remember anything.” He picked up one of the photos and gestured to the beefy man with the moustache. “Is this Vernon?”
But despite a shaky start, things worked out. He enjoyed his job, and he was good at it. His Muggle coworkers were all right. Well, except for Kirk—he couldn’t stand Kirk—but that wasn’t because he was a Muggle, he was just a prick. But Jess was a laugh, and any night she worked was a guaranteed delight.
“All right. Good.” She looked over her shoulder again, then turned back. “You’re one of Harry’s friends?” Her eyes pierced him to his core, and if she weren’t a Muggle, he’d have suspected her of attempting Legilimency. He shrank, just a little.
With a flick of his wand, Draco summons a second wingback chair. Harry does as he’s told, knee pads squeaking as he kneels on the chair. He drapes his arms over the chairback wantonly displaying his arse.
. Draco grumbled. He was about to banish the book back to his trunk when he saw the illustration. He stopped dead in his tracks.
“Are you ready, Harry?” Draco whispered against Harry’s temple. When he felt a small nod, Draco Disapparated, just as Petunia lunged forward and shrieked, “Don’t leave me!”
“A mistake,” Draco said coldly, all the warmth in his chest evaporating. He wished he could have it removed, but the bloke at the tattoo shop said it was impossible, that the best he could do was cover it up. But Draco was unconvinced there was anything he could do to cover up his past.
She stopped talking when Draco cast the diagnostic spells. She stepped forward to examine the magnified version of the vortex. “What is that?” She cast spells to highlight portions and examine the drain from Harry’s magical core.
Harry steps forward and cups Draco’s face. Tears stream down Harry’s cheeks, numbed by the wind. “I’m so sorry. I was such a coward. If I could take it all back…”
Draco places his hand on the small of Harry’s back and guides him down the hallway and into the conservatory. He has an enormous smile on his face, which Harry can’t help but return. “This is
Reality came crashing down around Draco Malfoy in the form of a natural disaster called Harry Potter. He’d always turned Draco’s world upside down—set it on fire, distorted reality, unleashed chaos—ever since the day they’d first met.
Harry closed his eyes again, relaxed, and soon he was elsewhere. He wasn’t flying this time. Each time Harry had dropped acid, he’d started out flying, either levitating or on a broom. This time he was walking, and each footstep was ethereal. Connected. Vibrant. The earth pulsed with magic and Harry could taste it—sweet and floral. He came to a stop near a giant tree with expansive branches that twisted as though alive—which was insane. Except it wasn’t, not compared to what happened next.
With a bite halfway to his mouth, a sleek Eagle owl tapped at the window. Draco cursed and hurried to let the beast in before any of his Muggle neighbours noticed. His mother was nothing but persistent. He detached the letter and the small gold box of Belgian chocolates. He fed his mother’s new owl a piece of cheese, which it immediately wolfed down.
The teacher makes her way around the room, passing out the handouts and offering praise and helpful hints to each student. She lavishes compliments on Hermione for her spot-on sense of proportion and realism. She praises Harry too, says his drawing shows a Picasso influence. Harry knows enough about art to know it’s not a compliment.
“I’ve been going over it all in my head. It’s something I do to make sense of things—part of my daily healing ritual. I visualise and I breathe. But lately, I’ve come to realise I only really know the events from my perspective. I think it might help me heal if I could understand it better from both sides. What did you, Weasley and Potter get up to the year you were on the run?”
“Potter! What is the meaning of this?” Draco attempts to follow but finds the Sticking Charm has him rooted to the spot. He cancels the charm and instantly ends up on his arse. He huffs and stands, gripping the bannister tightly. Harry and Teddy make another loop — Teddy squeals,
The more Draco thought about it, the more concerned he became. It didn’t seem to have any outward effect other than allowing him to scratch the surface of his lost memories. But that couldn’t be all, and what Draco didn’t understand worried him.
“I hope you had a good sleep.” Her voice was calm and syrupy-sweet. The cat flap opened, and Petunia pushed through a bowl of tomato soup, a grilled cheese sandwich, and a cup of tea.
“I’ll let you go, then. But do think about it.” Hermione eyed him; one eyebrow raised. “Better go tend to your
Vernon wouldn’t stand for it. He marched outside and gave them a good what for. Mrs Next Door must have thought he’d gone mad, yelling at no one. He told them to stop interfering and leave us alone, to get lost and never come back. They got the message this time—it pays to be firm. They Hocus-Pocused their things away, but as they were leaving, something went wrong.
It was time. Together, they grasped the Elder Wand and focused on channelling the storm, directing it at Harry, willing it to re-enter his body. As the magic swirled downward, the memories played out, reverberating around the room. From misty green tendrils came a cold, shrill voice.
“I’m here, with you.” Harry traced his cock along Draco’s lips until they stretched wide and swallowed him back down. “So good, Draco.” Harry tilted his head back in pleasure. He was warm, tingly, just like he got when he tripped. Was he tripping now? There was something about Draco, an energy he gave off that reminded Harry of the ‘
Draco arrived at Queen Mary’s Rose Garden. He’d planned to ambush Granger—make her tell him the truth—but he softened when he caught sight of her. Granger looked like Hades warmed up; like she’d gone ten rounds with a vexed Hippogriff. Her eyes were dark, as though she hadn’t slept properly in months, her hair untamed, and her clothing ill-thought-out. Draco had heard the healer training program could be exhausting, but this was something else. Granger did not have the appearance of a smug witch who’d gotten away with a masterful charade. He approached her gingerly.
, they landed in Hermione’s backyard. Draco held Harry as he retched into the bushes. He eyed him with concern—Harry was worse than he’d expected. If he’d have known, he would have driven rather than risk Apparition. But Petunia’s appearance had forced his hand and they’d barely escaped. Draco steadied Harry and guided him to the open door.
Harry closes his eyes. Carefully balanced on the precipice, he feels how precarious life is, the thin line between living and dying.
Draco also came to realise there were many possibilities where Muggle medicine and wizarding healing arts could be combined. In Harry’s absence—which he tried in vain not to worry about—he’d spent many an evening discussing the ins and outs of his theories with Hermione. He appreciated her intelligence and wit; it was such a pity they hadn’t become friends sooner.
Draco straightened. “Well, tonight, the current master and its two previous masters require its assistance—for the greater good. We can save him, Hermione. Together.”
She looked at Draco, and he could see the emotions flash across her face, wanting to talk, uncertain if she should. Having decided, she cleared her throat.
The mighty Eagle owl screeched again and came to rest on the table, scattering papers to the floor. There was a note attached to her leg, poorly folded into what Draco could only assume was supposed to be a crane. His heart fluttered. Slowly, he unfolded the letter.
“It’s you,” she said. Two simple words, yet injected with such venom. Harry wondered why she’d be angry to see him if he lived there.
Harry is supposed to meet the Malfoy boy for dinner tomorrow, but I can feel a migraine coming on. He might be better off staying home in case I need him…
Diddy acted like nothing was wrong. As though Vernon was just away on an extended business trip. Then my sweet, impressionable boy started hanging out with a new crowd. He’d stay out all night, and when he came home, he reeked of alcohol and cigarettes and Lord-knows-what-else.
“Mmmmm. That feels nice. I spend so much time on my feet; sometimes it feels like I never sit down.”
I had lunch with Marjorie Polkiss today. It’s been so long since we’ve seen one another. They’ve just come back from their summer holiday in Majorca. She told me, in hushed tones, that Piers came out to her last month. I never would have guessed. But it makes me wonder… Could this be the answer to my prayers? He would be a better match for Harrykins. He’s hard-working, easy on the eyes, and he’s
But that was the last he’d seen of Harry. They still spoke on the phone and made plans, but Harry broke them off just as easily, always because of Petunia… a heartbreaking letter from her son… a migraine… a terrible nightmare that had left her shaken…
He went for a leisurely drive, his favourite pastime—it had been a mistake. He’d taken Harry on all his favourite routes, and driving near their picnic spot was gut-wrenching. Draco couldn’t sleep in his bed, overwhelmed by thoughts of soft hands gliding across his skin, hot breath against his neck, and the words, ‘
Dudders looked up to Vernon—as a young man should—so naturally he took his father’s passing hard. He wouldn’t admit it, not that I blame him, but I could tell. A mother knows these things.
One at a time, Harry slides his legs into the sleek leather trousers. He manages to pull them all the way up—but can’t do up the laces. There’s nothing for it. Alteration spells aren’t exactly Harry’s forte, but he magically adjusts the uniform so it fits him like a glove. He ties the laces and hopes Draco won’t notice his shoddy spellwork.
“Why don’t you sleep over at mine, and we’ll do LSD together. I want to experience what you see and feel.”
Harry feels the colour rising to his cheeks. The room suddenly feels too hot and a bead of sweat rolls down his back.
“I thought I heard…” He looked at Harry, brow furrowed, the corners of his mouth curling downward into a frown. He muttered a string of expletives.
“But we just got back.” Draco placed an open-mouthed kiss to Harry’s pulse-point, as he gripped Harry’s arse and pulled him even closer.
“It stings.” Fire flared through Harry’s left shoulder, worse than the bludger he’d taken last month.
Potter stood when he saw Draco. He looked much better than when Draco had last seen him—his cheeks were rosy, his hair artfully dishevelled, and he was wearing a navy knitted jumper with a golden ‘H’ on the front. He looked touchable. But Draco kept his hands firmly against his thighs—he wasn’t allowed touch. Not anymore.
I knew the Strumpet was bad news for my Dudders, and just the same I know Malfoy is bad news for Harrykins.
Harry’s heart beat faster, and he smiled, hoping to warm the strangely frosty encounter. He’d successfully done so with Petunia.
The Floo roars to life and Narcissa’s head appears, because of course. She looks around the room with a raised eyebrow. Teddy comes skating by, pushed by the dragon, and he waves. “Hi, Auntie!”
Dumbledore’s words echoed in Harry’s head. Harry didn’t understand the images as they flashed before him. Hogwarts was home. His friends were home. Not Privet Drive, with its locks on doors and the cupboard under the stairs; with his irritable, beefy uncle and bony, horse-faced aunt.
He stiffened. “It was to be expected.” He gestured to his notes. “I’ll leave my research with you. Perhaps the procedure we used tonight might be of use with your parents.” He headed for the door, then looked back. “Take care of him. Please.”
Stairs. He was under the stairs, in a cupboard. Draco wanted—needed—to get out, but there was no way out. He felt around for a door, pushed and kicked at it, but it was bolted shut.
“How did you know?” As expected, the owl didn’t respond but looked longingly at the refrigerator. Draco rolled his eyes and rummaged around until he found some leftover spicy breakfast sausage. She wolfed it down in three gigantic bites, then set to work grooming her plumage. Draco took a cigarette from Harry’s pack and lit it on the hob. After the night he’d experienced, he deserved it. Artemis did not approve; she ruffled her feathers and flew out through the open window. Draco stood and watched her silhouette grow smaller as he smoked, stamping out the cigarette before it was finished.
“Again?” The teacher says. “I’ve warned you about this before, Mr Goldstein. I’m afraid you must leave.”
“Don’t worry. I’ll change them back after,” Draco says. His eyes smoulder with intent. “Now, turn around.”
Satisfied, she nodded and loosened the grip on her wand—a wand that looked peculiar in her hand, yet strangely familiar.
Harry smiled, and Draco kissed him soundly on the mouth. Maybe everything would be all right after all?
But Harry still had no clue what it meant. He had no recollection of writing, but he must have done, because his hand felt tired and cramped.
“Shhhhh. Relax, love,” came Harry’s soothing voice. He was sitting right beside him in the cupboard. “It’s not real. None of this is real.”
They drove along one of Draco’s favourite scenic routes talking about everything and nothing, the carefree banter from their phone conversations easily extending into real life.
As much as it pains him to do so, Harry takes a slow, steadying breath and pulls his gaze upward, away from the tantalising red velvet pants, and focuses on Malfoy’s face. He studies his patrician features: intense grey eyes, straight aristocratic nose, high cheekbones, luscious lips with a perfect cupid’s bow and a plump lower lip that begs to be sucked. Of course, Harry’s looked before, but never for as long as he’s liked for fear of being caught staring. But now he has the perfect excuse; it’s what he’s here to do. He begins his sketch. He’s never done this before, but, like a true Gryffindor, he dives right in. Hermione is already way ahead.
—a film that both terrified Draco and filled him with awe—as planned, they immediately left following Petunia’s departure.
Jess rolled her eyes and smiled. “He does, but it’s nothing personal. He feels threatened. You’re gorgeous, all the birds flock to you, and not him.”
When Harry came back, he placed a small kiss on Petunia’s cheek. He handed her a glass of water and the requested pill, which she popped into her mouth and carefully swallowed. The tenderness between them made Draco think of his mother, and a tightness formed in his chest. He swallowed down the lump in his throat. He couldn’t trust her, but he missed her all the same.
Images flashed through Draco’s mind: Harry and Draco, touching and trembling in his car; on his knees under moonlight and stars; on his back with Harry thrusting into him… Draco ached, but he also burned with shame.
Harry stumbled out of bed and landed on his knees. He clutched his forehead, which felt like it might split in two. White-hot pain seared through his skull, radiating outward. He thought he might sick up. Petunia hadn’t let him go to bed until he’d polished off two large pieces of chocolate fudge cake, which he now regretted. But the cool hardwood floor under his shins soothed him. Harry rubbed his forehead—an action that seemed familiar. Had he experienced pain like this before? Or was this related to whatever had caused his memory loss? Harry breathed in and out, slow and steady breaths, and gradually the pain shifted from a raging inferno to a moderate ache.
Their stomachs were sticky with their release, and Draco yearned to clean them, but he remained rooted to the spot, as though he’d lost the ability to move. His entire body pulsed with energy—
Except Harry looked so soft and lovely in his bed. His mind flashed back to the night before, to the tender moments before the awful LSD trip filled with terrible memories. Their bodies had moved together in kisses and whispers.
“I know for sure because I’ve seen it firsthand. I had to modify my parents’ memories. That’s why they’re not here. They’re in Australia. They’ve both had an MRI which declared them in perfect health. But they think they’re Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and they don’t know they have a daughter. I’ve run diagnostics on them—all the magical ones—and although I can clearly see the memory block, I haven’t been able to reverse it. Yet.” She pursed her lips in a grimace.
Sometimes she just wanted his company for tea and a chat. There was nothing she loved more than to reminisce about earlier times and how happy they all were together as a family. But Harry noticed that with each retelling, the stories shifted. Certain details became more exaggerated, others changed entirely. He suspected rose-tinted glasses. But what concerned him the most was that Petunia seemed stuck in the past, unwilling to move forward.
When Harry woke up, he felt like hell. His body ached and his forehead throbbed. He wished he were still at Draco’s, nuzzled against his neck, safely wrapped up in his arms. But he had been right to hurry home; Petunia had been beside herself with worry. Understandably, it upset her he hadn’t left a note, but it wasn’t like he planned to sleepwalk. She forgave him easily, though, made him toast with marmalade, and asked him what had happened. She kept asking for specific details, and truthfully Harry couldn’t recall much. He knew he’d experienced a bad acid trip—cloaked figures, mist, a giant spider—but he couldn’t tell Petunia about that. Instead, he told her what he could remember: Draco had taken care of him, performed some New Age healing technique with a red light, and Harry tingled with energy afterwards. Harry was relieved that she wasn’t too angry. In fact, she seemed pleased. As soon as he’d finished eating, she’d sent him up to bed with instructions to take a nice, long nap.
When Harry opens his eyes, he’s alone again. The wind ruffles his hair, but it’s not as cold. He steps forward, takes another step, and another until he’s at the cliff’s edge. He keeps his eyes aimed forward, looks straight at the horizon, at the moonlight reflected in the waves. He doesn’t look down. He never looks down.
Following a quick shower, Draco towelled himself off and applied his usual sequence of lotions and leave-in hair serum. It had taken weeks to nail down the perfect combination to attain the silky-smooth finish the Malfoy family Charms could instantly create. He wanted nothing to do with magic—or anything Malfoy-related.
Harry took a large bite of eggs and watched as Petunia sat down and served herself a piece of toast. She daintily sipped her tea—the cup was hand-painted with roses and almost always in her hand—then lit a cigarette.
The House-Elf, dressed in a red Santa-inspired tuxedo, complete with a white beard, skates into the dining room while whistling Celestina Warbeck’s
They met in the park, not far from where Harry and Draco had first gotten off together. Lenny knew the place; he’d met Dudley there before.
“This way’s more fun. Where’s your sense of adventure?” Harry’s eyes are bright with excitement and it’s contagious. But Draco remembers how old his ancestral home is.
“Petunia, you can’t do this!” He pounded on the door, but he could already hear her footsteps retreating down the stairs. He had a powerful urge to throw the tomato soup against the wall but clenched his hands into fists instead. Who knew when his next meal would come?
Draco levitated Harry and followed her through to the guest bedroom. He laid Harry down, and they both examined him. His pulse was weak, and he was cold—except for his forehead, which was burning hot. Having experienced this before, Draco knew there was no time to waste.
Of course not. How could I? What with Snape breathing down my neck for six years, and then Slughorn practically licking my boots every time I breathed.
Hermione packs up quickly, but Harry remains seated. He needs another moment. She smiles knowingly and says she’ll meet him outside. One-by-one the students exit the classroom and Malfoy hands each a candy cane as they leave. Harry thinks of Voldemort in a pink vinyl corset. A short while later, he’s able to adjust himself and stand. With his drawing and pencil in hand, he heads for the door. He hopes, being the last one out, that Malfoy might already have left and he won’t have to look him in the eye on the way out. But no such luck.
put a tie in there) before he gave up. He had a spare. It wasn’t part of his official uniform, but a Slytherin tie would be close enough.
Harry’s head swirled with new information. King’s Cross Station, shrouded in mist, flickered in and out of existence. Dumbledore, dressed in shimmery silver robes, half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose, stood to Harry’s right patiently observing. To Harry’s left, a train appeared, sleek and robust. Steam rose from the engine with a hiss, followed by a loud whistle. As if in response, the fog billowed around them, closing inward, making Harry uneasy. He swallowed hard.
Granger answered after the third ring, breathless. Water ran in the background amid the staccato sound of knives chopping.
When Harry got back to his room, he saw the meditation book on his desk and instantly felt guilty. But he’d tried. He really had.
Draco bit his lip. “I feel like I’m taking advantage of you. You don’t remember your past, and when you get your memories back… Well, I might not be who you want.” Draco swallowed and looked away. There. He’d said it. It wasn’t the full truth, but the important parts were there.
. The few times they’ve worked together, Malfoy’s made it clear he can barely stand to be in Harry’s presence: he avoids eye contact, keeps his words clipped and to the point, and he always leaves the moment their work is done. So Harry does his best to keep his pesky feelings to himself.
Harry rolled over, ready to nuzzle against Draco, but found him sitting upright instead, staring at Harry with a furrowed brow.
Disappointment flooded Harry’s chest. He sighed and opened the bottle, brought it to his nose and sniffed. It was odourless and looked like water. But he knew it couldn’t be. He guessed the bottle must be Dudley’s. What was inside?
Goldstein’s already on his feet, but Harry needs a moment. He’d rather wait for the obvious bulge in his jeans to deflate. He pictures Aunt Marge dressed in Santa panties coordinated with red, tasselled pasties. There. That does the trick. Harry stands slowly and wraps his sweater (bright red and green, patterned with trolls clubbing each other with giant candy canes) around his waist, so the sleeves hang down and obscure his crotch, just in case. Hermione raises an eyebrow but says nothing.
The effect was instantaneous. The bezoar neutralised the LSD, and the rate of magical drainage decreased to a trickle. He’d been right—the LSD
All because he was selfish. He should have acted sooner, and maybe Harry wouldn’t be in this much trouble.
When last at Privet Drive, he took a good, hard look at the cupboard under the stairs with the sturdy bolt lock. When he encountered Petunia, it was like two ships passing in the night. He knew she despised him, but would continue to tolerate him so long as there was no
“How did you do that, Draco?” Harry asked again, his limbs shaky. He did not look good—his eyes were bloodshot and smudged with dark circles, his complexion pale, and his scar had cracked further open.
He drove rather than Apparate. If things went poorly, he’d need a long drive along a new route to clear his head. He parked the car and with trepidation approached the Hampstead home. There was a note affixed to the door. Draco’s heart sank.
The final credits rolled. Between them, they’d killed the bottle and reduced the bowl to kernels. Hermione sat with her feet in Draco’s lap, and he massaged them with slow circles.
“I’m sorry, I’m still taking in the details.” Harry wriggled, then cast a non-verbal Sticking Charm to keep Draco’s wandering hands firmly affixed to his arse cheeks. He couldn’t help but smile as Draco tried (in vain) to move.
He swallowed. “I meant all of it. I was on the wrong side, and I knew it by the end. But by then it was too late. If I could change everything… go back and do it all again, I would.”
He breathed a nervous sigh as he opened the first page. It contained a large photograph from Petunia and Vernon’s wedding—they were both so young. Harry flipped through the book to see a newborn Dudley, Dudley blowing out the single candle on an enormous chocolate cake, and Dudley tottering around in a sailor’s uniform. His cousin had been a fat little porker. Harry thought about the overly large clothing he’d originally found in his room and shrugged. Perhaps they’d both been fat.
Had Harry known this and run away from his own fame? But then why not confide in his closest friends? Why make them suffer? Or did he really not remember?
Well, that was it. Vernon stood up to them and we returned to our home, but they insisted on keeping guards stationed outside. Thank the good Lord they remained invisible. What would the neighbours think? Vernon demanded that
Bewildered, he listens to the repetitive scraping noise that sounds like it’s coming from the main floor. Slowly, carefully, he descends the stairs, clinging to the bannister for support. He hears the unmistakable peals of Teddy’s laughter.
“I’m doing it!” he shouts, and Harry wandlessly casts a Cushioning Charm as he falls. But the fall doesn’t deter him. He gets back up and Harry casts his Patronus. The majestic stag appears, icy and ethereal in the cold, and gracefully bends his neck to gently guide and support Teddy with its antlers. The boy glides forward and squeals in delight.
Pleasure intensifies and pools in Harry’s gut like molten lava, and when Draco pulls him down extra hard, slamming into that tender bundle of nerves, he can’t hold back. Harry cries out as he comes harder, more spectacularly, than he has in a long time. Ribbons of come splash across Draco’s perfect suit. Draco moans, then shudders, and Harry kisses him gently through his orgasm, as they rock together.
Harry cupped Draco’s cheek, placed a gentle kiss on his lips, and massaged his furrowed brow. “Relax, love. We’re on vacation.”
Harry looked up at the moon, shimmery and bright. A creature howled in the distance, electrifying every cell in Harry’s body. He didn’t know how he got there, but suddenly Harry was deep in the forest. Moonlight filtered through the canopy in a kaleidoscope of spectral colours. The
; it’s 6:30 pm. He pulls on his winter cloak, picks up the bouquet of Narcissus, and the gold heart-shaped box of dark Belgian chocolates with salted caramel centres. After a quick
Draco faltered. He wanted—Merlin, how much he wanted to plunge into Harry’s hot, tight arse, and Harry was offering it to him. But Harry couldn’t know what he was asking, because he didn’t remember all the awful things Draco had done. Draco Malfoy had tirelessly made fun of Harry Potter for having dead parents, had stomped on Harry’s nose and left him on the train, had let Death Eaters into the castle to cause destruction, and done unspeakable things at their command. Harry Potter would never ask for this if he knew the truth.
Harry moves closer and the first ornament he sees features a tall witch with Draco’s fine platinum locks, a hooked nose, and a constant scowl reminiscent of Lucius. She turns her nose up at Harry. Well, she wouldn’t be the first Malfoy to disapprove. To Harry’s surprise, there is a picture of Sirius. He’s younger than when Harry knew him, his hair longer, and he looks less weighed down upon. He winks and Harry feels a moment of longing. He really wishes his godfather could be at their wedding.
It meant something, though he didn’t know what. But he’d uncovered these words through LSD—not meditation.
The front door opened and Draco sat up straight, ready to be of assistance. But it was only Kirk, sweeping. Draco sighed and tried to bring his thoughts back to the present. He flipped through the pages of
I huff in annoyance and pray my palms aren’t sweaty. Every time I think I’m getting it, moving to the rhythm, Malfoy changes direction, and I feel as though I have four feet.
“I’m afraid that’s not possible,” Petunia snarled. “He’s sleeping.” She looked at Draco as though she’d rather spit on him than talk. “He looked frightfully ill when he arrived home this morning, and we won’t even get into how unlike him it is to leave without letting me know. What have you done to him?”
Harry opened the window, but the metal bars kept him trapped inside. Draco’s gut churned with thoughts of what Harry must have endured over the years at the hands of the Dursleys, and now because of his nutjob aunt.
Hermione reached the door, and the smile dissolved from her face. She stood still, with her mouth agape. “Who is this? Is this some kind of joke? Because if it is, it’s not funny.”
. Draco reached the top, and despite his precarious balance, tried to pull the bars loose. They were securely bolted to the brick.
When Draco awoke, mouth cotton-dry, his limbs tingled, and his breath came in quick gasps. His mind, a maelstrom of images; his heart, a torrent of emotions. They’d fallen asleep with the lights on, and now they blinked off and on, off and on, off and on. Draco shuddered—the hairs stood on the back of his arms like that time he’d plugged in the jug with wet hands.
“You know, wave your wand around, make the pieces fly back together. You’re of age now, I’d have thought you’d want to flaunt your abnormality.”
“They forced me to torture people. Muggles and Muggle sympathisers. There was a family, and they lived in a tiny stone shack. I tortured the parents. They wouldn’t tell us anything. To be honest, I don’t think they had the answers the Dark Lord sought. When they didn’t comply, I was given orders to torture their child. She was so young, not quite old enough to go to Hogwarts.” He looked up at Hermione, her eyes filled with horror.
. Harry knew those words never boded well. “You don’t regret it, do you?” His heart clenched as he awaited Draco’s response.
Harry awoke with a start, his head pounding to the rhythm of the swirling vortex. He knew it was just a nightmare, but the fear gripping him was real. He swallowed; his throat was dry. His t-shirt and boxers clung to him through a layer of sweat. He looked at the clock and saw it was nearly noon. He’d overslept again.
Harry can tell he’s getting close, is eager to taste his release. But Draco pulls Harry back by his hair with a sharp tug, and the accompanying pain is just this side of pleasurable.
For a moment Draco looks like a kicked puppy, but then his face hardens into a defiant sneer. His lips move, and Harry knows all too well what he’s saying.
and a muffled sob. Adrenaline surged through his veins. His right hand clenched reflexively, as though looking for something to hold. But what? He looked around for a weapon but came up short.
But soon a dark shape loomed behind the mermaid, and Harry feared for her safety. He swam towards her but didn’t get far—Draco clasped his ankle tightly. Harry thrashed against his husband as the dark shape rose from the trench. He needed to help her.
. Harry thought about Hogwarts and its wondrous magic, and about how safe and alive he felt within its walls, despite the obvious irony of numerous attempts on his life over the years. He saw Hagrid’s Hut, the Quidditch Pitch, and his four-poster bed in Gryffindor colours awaiting him when it was all done.
He yearned to see his mother and the bespectacled man he knew must be his father. He hoped for an epiphany, a sudden return of memory.
At the front door, Petunia fussed with Harry’s hair, smoothing it down until he looked like a plastic, sanitised version of himself.
Malfoy stands in the doorway, perfectly still, candy cane in hand. But he doesn’t give it to Harry, he stares at him instead.
to remember. Draco wasn’t wicked, which meant neither was his mother. He cursed Petunia for confiscating his bottle of LSD. But then he remembered. Lenny had given him a little something extra. A sample. He opened the wardrobe and fumbled around until he found the jacket he’d been wearing that day—it was still inside the pocket.
. It looked just like the one Hermione caught when she disarmed the Dark Lord during the final battle.
Malfoy has filled out since the war. He’s tall, buff, and gorgeous, but still an arrogant git. You’d think surviving a dark wizard would have given us something in common, or at least incentive to let bygones be bygones. But no, Malfoy’s as prickly as ever, and he never misses an opportunity to trade barbs or point out any of my shortcomings. Hermione calls them
“I’m afraid time is of the essence.” Dumbledore gently tapped his fingers together. Both hands were whole, as if he’d never put on the cursed ring.
A pair of shimmery Hungarian Horntails emerged from their wands. They flew around the compound snarling, snapping, and breathing vapour-like fire at the Lethifolds, keeping them at bay so all the guests could make it to safety.
Pleasure coiled in Harry’s belly, and he inhaled sharply as he tried to hold on. “I’m close,” he gasped. “Touch yourself.” But instead, Draco froze, then quickly wriggled off and landed beside the bed with a loud
Draco rolls his eyes. “Cast a Warming Charm. Or have you forgotten you’re a wizard? It’ll be perfect. I promise.”
Harry staggered to his feet, and in three strides was at the door. He yanked on the handle—it wouldn’t budge. He rattled it, then pounded on the door.
Draco did not have such a device and didn’t know where to look. He sighed. That wasn’t entirely true. There were many Dark Artifacts hidden within the depths of the Manor. He’d vowed to never again set foot in that wretched place, filled with horrid memories of murder and Dark Curses. But he would, for Harry.
Draco’s eyes widened with alarm; his pale skin dotted with sweat from their coupling. He clutched the blankets, pulled them against his slender frame. Harry looked over to the window and saw a large, puffy bird with vibrant pink plumage. The Fwooper stared at him with the most judgmental expression Harry had ever seen.
“What’s all this?” he asked when he’d found his voice. Surely they weren’t all for him? One or two gifts were more than sufficient. Unless he was finally about to learn about the extended family that Petunia refused to discuss. Or perhaps he had some friends after all?
The mermaid’s lips parted to reveal two perfect fangs. She grinned wider, revealing row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth. With great agility, she turned and lunged at the monstrous fish behind her, stretching her jaw wide and swallowing it whole.
The phone rang, and Harry knew it was Draco. He wished Draco were here—he should have moved in with him when he had the chance.
When Harry pulled back, his lips glossy and well-kissed, he said, “I’ve wanted to do that since the moment I first saw you.”
Draco knew he should take Harry to St. Mungo’s—he needed an experienced Healer, not someone who dabbled. But the idea of exposing Harry’s existence to the wizarding world without his consent made Draco feel ill. They were more likely to use him than help him—treat him as an experiment—and he couldn’t be certain anyone there could actually heal him. Maybe he should speak with Hermione first? She would be furious, and rightly so, but she wasn’t known as the brightest witch of her age for nothing.
“I’ve already spoken to him on your behalf. You needn’t worry about him anymore; he won’t bother you again.”
It was truly bizarre, however, to use the phone to dial Granger. But she had given him her number, and she’d asked him to keep in touch.
But they found even with Harry’s cooperation, it was arduous work. The void had grown rather fond of Harry’s magic and wouldn’t give it up. Not without a fight.
They visit many rooms with trees ranging from whimsical to verging on gaudy: a tasty gingerbread tree, one magnificently bejewelled, another weighed down by Goblin gold, and a tree with a perpetual snowfall enchantment that reminds Harry of the inside of a snow globe.
“Mmm-hmmm,” was all Draco could manage amid the sensory overload. Every cell in Draco’s body felt attuned to Harry’s, aligned as though Harry was a magnet. It made sense; Harry had always drawn him in, like a moth to a flame. Draco’s orgasm was building fast—too fast—but there was nothing he could do to slow it down. Harry sucked Draco’s bottom lip into his mouth, gave it a gentle nip, and Draco sighed.
The next time Harry awoke, it was dark outside. Shadows played along his walls, and a pebble bounced off the glass.
That was something Draco couldn’t fathom. But the hows and whys weren’t important. Harry was alive, for now, and in trouble. Draco needed to focus on that.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco replied quickly. After everything that had transpired, it felt truly bizarre to be making small talk now. “Hermione’s inside, is she?”
When the cinema was busy, Draco enjoyed the fast pace as it kept his mind from wandering to the past… to things that couldn’t be changed. During the quiet times, he read his medical textbooks or chatted with Jess.
Draco had brought a bottle of Pinot Grigio. He poured two glasses and set them down on the table beside the bowl of freshly popped popcorn—the buttery aroma smelled heavenly.
“Oh, no, Draco. Harry would never willingly go back there. The Dursleys were awful people. They hated magic, and they abused him horribly.”
embroidered across the back; knee pads, shin pads, arm guards, and gloves, all made from the toughest Hebridean Black dragon hide. Finally, his trousers fashioned from the softest sheepskin leather, custom made for maximum flexibility and minimal chafing, form-fitted to reduce air drag, fastened with laces at the crotch.
It’s only when Draco growls, “Harry,” his voice hoarse, that Harry sucks him all the way down until his cock hits the back of Harry’s throat. Draco groans and threads his fingers through Harry’s messy hair. Harry sucks him hard with hollowed cheeks, and Draco pants and writhes, occasionally swearing.
“Do we know each other… Draco?” Harry glanced at his nametag and hoped he’d pronounced it correctly; it was an unusual name.
Draco removes his fingers—Harry aches at the loss—but soon feels the blunt tip of Draco’s cock against his entrance. Harry sinks down, throws his head back and hisses at the burn, at Draco filling him so deeply, so completely. It doesn’t matter how many times they’ve done this before, Harry will never get used to how good Draco’s cock feels inside him.
“I understand,” Draco said. And he really did. There was no way Hermione Granger would willingly cry on Draco Malfoy’s shoulder, or have Harry Potter’s wand in her possession unless she believed him dead.
Harry showered, then combed his hair so it covered his forehead. He didn’t know why, but he didn’t want Petunia to see the mark. He told himself it was because she’d worry, but deep down he knew there was another reason. One he couldn’t even begin to fathom.
Draco gasps as Harry’s hand slides into his pants and wraps around his hard, leaking cock. “Just a quick one,” Draco whispers and casts a wandless spell. Suddenly their trousers and pants are at their ankles, their cocks pressed together. He summons his favourite lube — one he brews himself that warms pleasantly the closer one gets to completion — and slicks them both up.
This is all the Malfoy boy’s fault. He’s all Harry talks about. Draco this, Draco that, prattling on and on about his car and films. I don’t know why he works that job—it’s hardly respectable. He comes from money, I can tell by his clothing, his accent, the way he looks down at me and my home. Perhaps he’s doing it to get a rise out of his parents? If that’s the case, I don’t know that I want him around my Harry. My sweetums is rather impressionable, and he needs positive influences.
shook the walls... Draco’s eyes darted to the window. Artemis appeared behind the windowpane; eyes fixed on Draco. The glass glowed—vibrant, searing white—then wavered. In the blink of an eye, the glass vanished. Draco’s wand slipped from his hand and clattered to the ground. Majestically, Artemis flew through the open window, and once she’d passed through, the glass reformed.
Harry examines himself in the mirror. He runs his fingers through his hair in a futile attempt to smooth it down. He’s wearing his green suit, the one that brings out his eyes, freshly laundered and immaculately pressed. It fits a little more snugly than he’d like, and he frowns at the dark circles under his eyes, but overall, he cleans up nicely. He fastens his cufflinks—silver dragons—and knots the tie carefully at his throat.
Draco stowed his wand into the drawer of his bedside table, curled up around Harry, and drifted off into an exhausted sleep.
Draco leapt into action and steadied Harry, wrapping Harry’s arm around his neck and shoulder as he half-carried, half-dragged him to the bedroom. He flopped Harry onto the bed and wiped the blood from his nose. He tapped his cheek twice. Three times. His head was hot to the touch, but further examination found his hands and feet icy cold.
Draco sat back down and took a sip of tea. He found it fascinating how Muggles could revive a person without magic; bring them back from the dead. He’d been taught to fear Muggles, to treat them as subservient, but they had this amazing physical... magic, for lack of a better word. That they could manipulate the human body and save a life was nothing short of miraculous. They called it the
Harry stumbles out and dusts himself off; Draco does the same but with practised elegance. “Why are we down here?”
Hermione gives him a warm, reassuring smile. She already has her pencils all lined up in order from 2H to 8B along with her eraser and smudger. Harry smiles in return and sharpens his pencil. He just has the one, and that’s only because Hermione reminded him to bring one.
“You didn’t, did you?” Draco’s expression was more amused than upset. “Even the picture shows a Lethifold next to the lighthouse.”
, Draco mutters — and he’s unexpectedly hit in the face with a clump of snow. He supposes he should be grateful Teddy hasn’t yet mastered the art of compacting a firm snowball. Harry laughs, and Draco conjures a snowball which hits Harry squarely in the chest. Soon it’s a free-for-all, and the three madly pelt each other with snowballs.
But Draco was better than that. No matter what else they had done together, this wouldn’t be right. As he tried to find the right words to explain himself, the look in Harry’s eyes punctured his heart—he looked completely dejected.
Harry stood, but stopped dead in his tracks when he saw his desk. Papers. Pages upon pages, scattered, all filled with the repeated lines:
When they pulled apart, Petunia’s eyes widened, and she smiled. “I haven’t seen you wearing that shirt yet. I knew it would look sharp on you. Oh, and your hair. It’s perfect.” Petunia’s approval made Harry feel all warm and fuzzy inside. When he looked beyond his aunt’s slender frame, his jaw dropped. The breakfast table looked as though it might collapse under the weight of presents.
He had been so focused on the snake that day, but now time rippled around him, suspended, and Draco could take in the details he’d missed the first time. Fear in the eyes of the surrounding Death Eaters; Neville’s face, set with determination; The Dark Lord’s stunned expression before contorting in rage. Even though Draco knew the outcome—had lived through it—he feared for Neville.
Teddy, wearing an enormous toothy grin, collapses in a heap on a snowdrift. Draco’s dragon Patronus goes off to nuzzle against Harry’s stag in the corner —
There was a moment of shocked silence before curses flew. Draco couldn’t see her now, but it was around this time when his mother, having hedged her bets, made the calculated risk to defy her husband and protect a group of students—the sole reason she avoided Azkaban.
Draco dressed in a pressed white button-up, charcoal trousers, and matching waistcoat—his uniform. He frowned as he examined himself in the mirror. He’d always had house-elves to do his laundry. Their expertise and magic meant his clothing had always been immaculate. His level of skill with an iron left something to be desired, but he was improving. At least now he didn’t singe the collar. It had been a challenge to explain to his boss that he already needed a new shirt on his second day of work. The man had rolled his eyes, docked his pay, and muttered something under his breath that sounded like
“Shhhh. It’s just a power surge. Go back to sleep, love.” Harry snuggled against Draco and shortly after began to snore. Draco breathed a shaky sigh of relief.
“Nothing, I”—he needed to cover, had to keep up pretences—“I just can’t get enough of you.” He lowered his hands to Draco’s trousers and went to unzip them. Draco stopped him.
“It’s speeding up,” Draco noted with a pained expression. Harry’s forehead continued to crack and bleed. Hadn’t Petunia heeded his warning?
“Just like every year. Why would you promise him that? I’ll have you know you could have conjured snow outside, or we could have Apparated to the mountains.”
The water was perfect—just the right temperature. Small pink and orange fish darted around their faces, and Harry wanted to see more. He grabbed Draco’s hand, interlacing their fingers, and guided them further out. The beach fell away quickly into a deep underwater trench. They remained near the surface and looked down. Deep down, jellyfish wove in and out in an exotic dance, and vampire squid veered back and forth, making inky trails.
Draco removed a bag from his pocket and restored it to its proper size. He pulled out spellbooks, a large stack of handwritten notes, and together they poured over the details.
“I wasn’t sure if you were being sincere, or just telling me what I wanted to hear.” She ran her fingers along the smooth surface of the wand. Draco’s eyes followed the movement.
The tree is tall with pure white branches, every ornament white or silver. Even the popcorn garlands are snowy-white rather than buttery-yellow. Harry squints at the tree, confused. He scours the branches. “Why is it called that? I don’t see any peacocks.”
Harry passed Draco the cigarette, and he inhaled deeply, the smoke calming his nerves. They were getting too close to the truth.
Harry Potter—was it really him? That was the million Galleon question. Draco tossed the takeaway container onto the table and paced his flat. The bloke looked like him—a more stylised version of him—but without his famous lightning bolt scar. He still had that dimple, though, the one that made Draco weak in the knees. He knew it couldn’t be someone Polyjuiced to look like him; he’d felt Harry’s magic—pulsing, familiar, but also unusual. It wasn’t the usual explosion of raw power, and it had a benign quality to it, as though muted. Perhaps death had changed him? Except, people don’t come back from the dead. The
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you. It’s been a… strange day. And to answer your question, no, we’ve never been friends.” He put together Harry’s order and rang it up. “That will be £4.”
Eventually, Harry padded down the hallway, instinctively knowing the way to the loo. He rinsed his mouth, used the facilities, and returned to the room.
Harry’s chest rose and fell. He remained unconscious but had gained a healthy tint to his cheeks. Hermione cast a round of diagnostic spells.
Monday last I went to see the grief counsellor that Dr Vaughn’s been urging me to see. Utter nonsense, that’s what it was. We just sat and stared at each other for an hour. The only thing he said was to talk when I was ready. But what was I supposed to talk about? Then Dr Vaughn had the nerve to say it was too soon, and perhaps I wasn’t ready. As though it was my fault that quack didn’t do his job.
Harry’s eyes narrowed and his jaw clenched. He was sick of all these people asking him the same inane question, but equally annoyed with not having any answers.
Harry is next. He gets into a car… The Malfoy boy’s car. I can’t see his face, but I see blond hair through the window. They drive away, and I’m left all alone.
Draco yawned, then took a much-needed sip of tea. The crisp bergamot flavour roused him. Instead of going to bed after his shift, he’d stayed up into the wee hours studying.
“The forest. Must go to the forest. I open at the close.” Harry sat up, pushing against Draco, but in his weakened state, it wasn’t hard for Draco to wrestle him back down on the bed.
. He liked blokes, especially blonds. This one came as a surprise. Petunia had taken him for a suit fitting—she insisted a fine young man such as himself should have one in his wardrobe. While standing on the stool awaiting measurement, he noticed the blond next to him. Something sparked in his gut. At first, he thought it was recognition, like perhaps this person had been a friend. But the man didn’t seem to know who he was, so he quickly realised it must be something else. Attraction. But he kept this revelation to himself. While Petunia had warmed up to him, forgiven him for whatever he had done in his past, he suspected this might push her too far, and she was already so fragile. Also, there were so many things he’d thought he'd discovered about himself, but they all turned out to be false. He couldn’t handle being told he was wrong about this as well. Not when it felt so right.
Draco recoils as if stung. Because that’s not what Harry said the first time. When it really mattered. When it would have made a difference. Bile rises in Harry’s throat as his words replay in his head, a bitter refrain.
Harry runs a hand along the inseam, revelling in the suppleness, remembering the soft slide of leather against his skin. But his nostalgia quickly washes away, replaced by rapidly growing panic. It’s been fifteen years since he’s worn the uniform, five since he last put it on, when an undercover mission had been unexpectedly extended and he’d missed Draco’s birthday. It took substantial grovelling—and
“But for a squib, though, Muggle medicine should be sufficient. They have little to no magic, so you can treat them just like a Muggle.
. He stared her down and asked her about the multiple deadbolts on Harry’s bedroom door. She smiled demurely and explained about Harry’s sleepwalking tendencies.
He picked up his journal, empty save for that list he’d written weeks ago. He flipped through the pages. Every page was filled:
The teacher announces the end of class. As Malfoy pulls on his Santa robe, he fixes Harry with an intense gaze that makes him feel like he’s the one that’s nearly naked.
The Horcrux had taken up space inside Harry’s head from the time he was a baby. When eliminated, it would have left a void—an emptiness that was used to being filled.
It was a fluttering noise, the sound of wings flapping, and a rush of cool air against his cheek that forced his eyes open again. But he wasn’t in the room filled with keys, as he’d expected—he was in his room, with all the things Petunia had carefully chosen for him, bought his affections with. He couldn’t explain the sensation, but the image of an owl popped into his head, which made no sense at all. Weren’t owls nocturnal? He surveyed the room; the window was closed and barred, as expected. No bird could have flown into his room. Except…
Harry’s eyes sprang open, but he did as he was told. After he’d dried his mouth with the back of his hand, he said, “That’s… amazing. What else can you do?”
Draco sat alone in the ticket box. It was a Wednesday afternoon, and there were next to no customers. His mind wandered to thoughts of Harry. Two days after their LSD trip, Harry made love to him twice more. The first time, urgent and frenzied, like he couldn’t possibly get his fill; the second, tender and slow, as though he wanted to draw it out and make it last forever. They gazed into one another’s eyes, each movement slow and deliberate, fingers intertwined. Draco came with Harry’s name on his lips.
But Draco’s reverence soon turned to fear. The colours whirled faster, gaining momentum until the room resembled the vortex. The walls shook and cracks formed as Harry’s magic tested the boundaries and limitations of the Containment Charm.
They head to the kitchen, and Harry stalls in front of the Floo, one hand on either side like a Kneazle trying to avoid a trip to the vet. He can count on one hand the number of times he’s been to the Manor; none of the experiences have been pleasant.
Another image flashed before him. His Uncle Vernon, face purple with rage, shouting at Aurors, and gesturing for them to leave. As they Disapparated, one by one, Vernon clutched at his chest, and his face went slack. Petunia screamed as she ran to him.
Draco glanced at his watch. Blast. Where was his tie? He always kept his tie in the same spot—hanging off the edge of his bedroom mirror. He searched the floor behind the mirror, inside his wardrobe, the laundry basket (even though he would
The Dark Lord loomed over everyone, eyes cold and reptilian, as he announced Harry’s death with obvious glee. There came a collective gasp from the crowd and a wail of despair. Draco’s chest tightened—searing pain surged through his heart, and he knew he would slowly bleed from the wound for the rest of his life. Tears formed in his eyes, stinging, just like on that fateful day, and he must have made a sound because Harry pressed closer.
Harry reached out and pulled Draco down for a warm embrace. “You had a bad trip, love. I’m sorry about that. I’ve mostly had positive experiences.”
The realisation dawned on him—forever. Nobody else knew he was here. She’d sent Draco away, told him whatever she’d told him, and he had no other friends. Nobody would come looking for him.
Draco had chosen not to use magic. It was a conscious decision and he stood by it. How was this possible? He didn’t even have his wand with him. It was like… accidental magic. The cogs turned inside Draco’s head. The LSD had left him agitated and was now reacting with his magical core, amplifying his thoughts and accelerating his latent magical tendencies. A grown wizard was expected to be in charge of his faculties, but Draco was having difficulty keeping his in check, just like a magical child.
“Great,” Harry said, and smiled. He reached over the counter and grabbed a piece of paper and a biro. “Here’s my number. Call me. Soon.”
Harry wanted to ask about Vernon, but he wasn’t sure about the best way. Petunia seemed a little unstable, as though the smallest thing might set her off. He decided to fish for information in a roundabout way.
The scene faded, and Draco was falling, falling through darkness. He clutched at Harry—who wasn’t dead—and pulled him closer.
After a pause, she rose without speaking and left the room. Draco went to check on Harry, serene within the Stasis Charm, as though asleep.
Back at Privet Drive, Petunia suggested more shots. Harry gently guided her away from the drinks cabinet and into the kitchen.
who flaunted their abnormality around willy-nilly. It was one thing to suffer their presence—their interference. But it was completely too much when Diddy became friendly with them. The Strumpet. Dudley said she was all right.
“Oh, I’m afraid another migraine is setting in.” She sighed and swooned, making a show of how poorly she felt. “Would you be a dear and go find my pills?”
He gave a deep moan as Harry withdrew his fingers, already missing the fullness. Draco grabbed a pillow and slid it under his arse as Harry slicked up his neglected cock, giving it a few quick strokes. Looking deeply into Draco’s eyes, Harry lined himself up and slowly, tortuously, pushed inside. They both groaned when he bottomed out.
The tree in the centre is incredible, clearly installed by magical means — most likely magically enhanced as well — there is no other explanation for its sheer size and complete perfection. The tree stands five floors tall, the star at the top grazing the ceiling, elegantly decorated in silver baubles and Slytherin green bows.
“I wanted to save the best part for when we were together.” Draco flicks his wand. The double doors open; the Malfoy peacocks file into the room and gather by the tree. They peck at the rug, the furniture, Harry’s shoelace. A few call out, and one fans its tail feathers.
“Oh, Harry,” she shouted over the din, her cheeks rosy. “We should do this more often. I feel like a schoolgirl again.”
eagerly sitting too close, and also because the only other wizard in the mostly Muggle class is that tosser, Anthony Goldstein, who’s chosen a front-row seat.
“I have another question for you. How did you end up with Harry’s wand? He took mine from the Manor. I always assumed his had been lost or broken.”
All I can think about is the mission. Months of hard work, research, and intelligence are about to be rendered useless. I have to get us out of here before we’re seen. I grab Malfoy’s wrist, and before he can protest I Apparate us directly to Robard’s office. We land with a jolt and my skin stings, but I can’t tell if it’s from the potions or from punching through the multitude of Ministry wards.
Harry groaned softly, and fresh blood seeped through the lightning bolt scar. Draco carefully tipped the potion—a modified Calming Draught mixed with a Muggle muscle relaxant—into his mouth and whispered soothing words as Harry swallowed. He’d infused the potion with treacle to mask the peppermint.
The slide of Harry’s leg against his skin stifled the words. A brush of hair across Draco’s cheek, the scent of sandalwood at his throat, sent a jolt of arousal straight to Draco’s cock. He knew he shouldn’t, but he wanted Harry so badly.
Hermione nodded and took a deep breath. “Harry started taking private lessons with Professor Dumbledore during Sixth Year. He’d hoped to prepare Harry for the war, so he could face Voldemort and defeat him once and for all. Voldemort was so sick and twisted, determined to preserve his life at all costs, that he split his soul. Have you ever heard of the term
Harry shivered. Draco’s hands, affixed in place, were now spreading apart the globes of his arse. Hot breath ghosted across his pucker.
Harry collapses beside him. “So good, Draco. You’re always so good for me,” he pants and casts a wandless Cleaning Charm over them. He tugs Draco closer and kisses him. “I could get lost inside you forever.”
“Take that, you little freak!” It was a boy’s voice. The stomping came again, pounding from above, reverberating around the small, enclosed space.
“Well, in theory, what would you say if a witch or wizard was experiencing repeated headaches, but nothing showed up on the Muggle scans?”
Tonight Petunia wanted to go out to the pub. Surprised, but accommodating, Harry agreed. They started with a pint each, but when Petunia ordered shots, Harry discreetly switched to soda.
The thing about meditation was it required physical presence and a relaxed state of mind. But Harry could not calm down or focus—his mind whirled with untamed thoughts about his multitude of worries. What was he to do about Petunia? Where was Dudley? What did his nightmares mean? Why couldn’t he remember anything?
She’s right. Harry does his best not to fixate on Malfoy’s gorgeous, perfectly sculpted thighs as he hurries to finish his sketch.
up just in time. The snowball explodes against the invisible shield, and Draco can’t help but laugh. They both look at Teddy, who’s grown bored with all the grown-up talk, and is attempting to skate unassisted.
Hermione smiled. “Nothing. It’s just you’ve come a long way. You’re not the hateful boy you once were back at Hogwarts. I’m proud of you.” She took another sip of wine, the tannins staining her lips. “And to answer your question, it depends on the witch or wizard. Magic, or magical ailments, won’t show up on Muggle diagnostics. It takes magic to detect magic. Non-wizarding medicine will only detect what’s physically apparent, right down to a cellular level. Magic exists essentially on another plane.”
Draco’s fascination with Muggle medicine continued. Every day he immersed himself in human anatomy, diagnostic techniques, and the modern advances made available through
“Transfiguring a vine into a broom was clever.” Draco’s voice drifted out from the loo. “Fancy that, they have a salve specially formulated for curse burns. Right next to the
“I just saved our arses,” I huff. I’m sticky, wet, and not in the mood for any of his shit today. “You can thank me later.”
With the towel wrapped around his waist, Harry headed back to his room. He sat at his desk and lit a cigarette. He exhaled and opened his journal, the one Dr Vaughn insisted he started keeping. It was mostly blank, except for this list.
, he wrote. He was a smoker. Obviously. He took another drag and relaxed as he exhaled. It made sense and certainly explained the smoky feeling in his lungs that first morning. And his hand… His restless hand, always reaching for something. Petunia said idle hands were the devil’s tool. So, he kept busy. Gardening, reading, helping his aunt around the house, and smoking… always smoking.
Harry hesitantly enters the sitting room. Draco, upright and regal in a high wingback chair, faces the fireplace. It shouldn’t be possible, but he’s become more handsome and distinguished with age—his pointy features now chiselled, eyes a deeper shade of slate, and minimal grey hair gleaming like liquid silver among his platinum locks. He favours smart, tailored suits, well-suited to his slender frame, and could probably still fit into his old Hogwarts uniform if he tried. Harry swallows down his mounting dread that Draco won’t find him attractive anymore.
No magic? No mention of the past? It was almost too good to be true. Without the war, the rest of the wizarding world, including annoying Gryffindor hangers-on, Harry could be his—all his. For the small price of a lie… Draco felt a tingle of guilt in his belly. What would Lucius Malfoy do? Lie through his teeth. But this was different, and Draco would not look a gift Thestral in the mouth. He knew full well if Harry’s memory was intact, he wouldn’t want anything to do with Draco. It wasn’t a guarantee that things would work out between them, but at least he had a chance. Draco would do anything for a chance.
Dejected, Harry went back to sleep. At some point, the cat flap opened, and Petunia pushed a plate through. But he couldn’t be bothered to get up, so it sat next to the other uneaten meals.
Harry decided perhaps it was for the best they stayed out of the ocean. Draco agreed wholeheartedly. They stretched out side-by-side on lounge chairs beside the pool instead. The water was crystal clear, no hideous surprises lurked within. Harry ordered another round of mimosas and the tropical tapas platter.
The words popped into Harry’s head, along with a flash of anger that rippled through his gut. His cheeks burned with shame. Where had that thought come from? Why would he think such a thing?
Draco wraps his arm around Harry’s waist and pulls him closer, he speaks quietly beside Harry’s ear. “When I was little, perhaps seven or eight, Mother said I could decorate this tree any way I wanted. It’s always been the purest white, to represent our Pureblood lineage” — Harry turns his head and rolls his eyes, Draco smiles fondly back — “and I wanted to keep with the theme. I wished and wished, with all my power, and, in what Mother calls
Where was the fresh bottle he’d put in last night? Harry glanced around the room. To the untrained eye, nothing was amiss. But things weren’t exactly as he’d left them. Someone had carefully rifled through his room.
Harry whines in protest and looks over his shoulder. Draco’s completely wrecked—eyes blown dark, pale skin flushed, hair a sweaty mess. Harry’s cock, painfully hard and aching for release, twitches at the sight and his heart flutters.
He’d spent the greater part of the week reading and researching memory spells. A carefully modified Obliviation Spell was the answer to his problems. He’d constructed the spellwork to isolate the past five months. All memories of Harry, Hermione, and his life working at the cinema would be gone. He’d start over, just as he’d done that first day in his new flat. Except it would be the first of October.
She nodded, her emotions carefully tucked away and replaced with the calm professionalism of a Healer. “Come this way.”
Harry reached his hand into the secret compartment and extracted a small bottle and a business card. The bottle, filled with a clear liquid, had no label. The lid had a dropper attached. Harry examined the business card. One side had a technicolour aeroplane. He flipped the card over. The other side read:
in this house or around Harry. No talk of magic or Hogwarts or witches or wizards. Do I make myself clear?”
He’d done the right thing. He’d helped Harry regain his memories. His power. His life. Why did it feel so bad?
But he hadn’t. The note simply instructed Draco to go around to the back garden. The air was brisk, but not too chilly to sit outside. Draco shook his head and took a deep breath, relief and anxiety setting his nerves abuzz.
The store is empty. Not a customer or employee in sight, which is strange for a Friday afternoon. Malfoy, the gorgeous bastard, holds his finger to his lips, and I roll my eyes. I can be quiet and careful. We both make our way forward in silence. I’m so focused on each footfall, ensuring a stealthy approach, that I don’t notice when Malfoy suddenly stops. I bump into him full force, and we lose our balance. There’s a display case to our right, stacked to the ceiling with corked bottles and glittering phials, and we stumble right into it. The entire thing comes crashing down—shelves buckle, stoppers fly loose, and glass shatters. We’re both drenched in a variety of unknown substances.
When he reaches their place, he looks out over the sea. The waves are white-capped in the wind; the moon, nearly full, is reflected in the ripples below. Harry casts another
Harry rests his head against Draco’s, and they remain still, breathing slowly until they come back to themselves. Draco’s cock softens and slips from Harry’s body, his seed trickling out. Slowly, Draco reaches down, and with a flourish, cleans them both. He takes a deep pull of whisky, then hauls Harry in for a passionate kiss. The complex flavours—rich and smoky with notes of vanilla—fill Harry’s mouth and add to the heat between them. Harry sits back, and Draco looks at him intensely, his expression a mixture of satisfaction and a depth of love that matches his own.
