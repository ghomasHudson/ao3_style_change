~~~~~~~~~~
Harry's cleats were marking their place in the ground, as he ran up the field, dribbling close to his feet, looking up around to make sure no one was in his way, before passing to George Weasley, but the pass was short and the opposing team, came to intercept the pass, Harry groaned, as #17 took a shot. Draco ran up from the top of the Goalie box and booted it to the other half's 18. Harry chased after it, pounding his feet into the ground sprinting up to catch up from his spot at the half mark, he swept in and scored another point for Hogwarts. The game ended 2 and a half minutes later, the score 5-2, making them 6-0, another win. This was one of the best teams the school had seen for awhile. However despite their win Harry was fuming.
“Have you been spying on Potter again?” Theo had been drawn to the Gryffindor since the other boy had saved his big mouth from being hexed into perpetual silence.
Draco stared wordlessly, lost.
“I know what hide and seek is, you oaf. I was young, once”.
He watched as Theo’s hands clenched into fists. “Fuck you, Malfoy.”
It was around 5am when the journal suddenly warmed, glowing faintly in the receding darkness of room 78.
The envious admiration of the other students in his regards had, also, a huge appeal to his vain side and his father was seldom impressed with the stories as his school mates were.
Blaise’s take on the Dark Lord’s matter was of disinterested arrogance, like if he felt above all those blood disputes. Draco was aware that, in truth, Blaise was making a statement with his unbothered attitude. I don’t want to be involved, just like Theo. Overall, Blaise was a far better man than he was, and Draco knew that, even if differently, he would be a far better friend for Theo too.
“Definitely the fucking palm tree!” Potter agreed with his friend, both snickering like idiots.
Weasley faked offence “Ok, ok. I’m going”. And with a last salute, he left.
The smile that the other boy gave him was as delighted as the one he used to reserve for his beloved golden friends. “I really think this is going to work out.”
Theo hissed feverishly. There was fear behind the anger and, for a moment, Draco was taken aback.
He watched closely, not sure if hoping or dreading for a trace of uncertainty, something that could excuse his sudden need to keep Harry close and damned the consequences.
“Scared, Malfoy?”
He rubbed at his eyes, finally forcing them open. The first thing he noticed in the haze was a soft purple light coming through the window, casting the scarce furnishing in long shadows. Dusk.
His father had been sentenced to jail, and this time Draco had written that owl he should have sent when Stephen died. He had said he was sorry and many other things, and had told Theo he was welcome to stay at the Manor if he needed a place. Theo had gently declined. Blaise was staying with him for a while, before joining his mother in Italy, and he needed some time to sort things out at home and eventually sell the place. He came to visit though, quite often.
“I’ve been Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter the Liar, the Deluded Orphan, Dumbledore’s Pawn and the Ministry’s Poster Boy, Harry Potter the Undesiderable Number One and the freaking Saviour of the Wizarding World nonsense. I think the time to be Harry Potter the Boy that Does the Fuck He Wants is well overdue”
Even the smallest chance of recognition, even the tiniest possibility of Harry reacting to his name being called, was too dangerous. The only way for the boy to disappear and finally have his shot at normality was to cut every single tie to the past.
“Do you. . .?” Lupin asked, gesturing awkwardly towards the pensieve.
And then, when back at school with other wizards and witches, people like Draco would make them feel as they didn’t belong, they weren’t deserving.
It was a strange thought, as the Potter he knew had never quite managed to go unnoticed. Even so, the demeanour was not completely unfamiliar. While at Hogwarts Potter had often tried to look unassuming, hunching on himself whenever he felt threatened under the attention he always seemed to attract, negative or otherwise. Draco had mostly accredited it to the other boy’s arrogance and seemingly precarious tolerance for other people, but part of him knew the constant spotlight must have been exhausting.
“I can assure you that the Wizarding World would know if the Dark Lord had found Potter. As you surely know, Albus, he is not one to keep his accomplishments quiet. You don’t need me for that.”
“Anyway, if you come back next week I’ll introduce you two.”
Anyway, to quote my sweet child Theo “I bet it won’t last”.
Sprawled across the shabby carpet of the last carriage of the Hogwarts Express, he lay motionless, but for the frantic quivering of his irises, the only indication he was still alive.
Dusk.
They stared at each other, eyes locked, both factions waiting for the other to break contact. Finally, Granger stomped her feet in frustration but grabbed the other’s arm and led him away, mumbling about unworthiness.
“Obliviscere”.
“What do you mean?”
Finally in the next chapter we will have D and H in the same place alone. In Snape’s head, very romantic, i know
It was the deject that Draco could hear in his voice that made him add, almost as an afterthought “The prophecy”. Damn self control.
“Harry” she corrected, distractedly.
The werewolf had spent the previous afternoon patrolling the area around the airport in search of the best spot for them to apparate to, so it was of no surprise to Draco when they landed in a deserted alley behind some old buses. He shook the other man’s grip off his forearm and glared “It smells of piss!”
“She is meddling, Ellen is.” Potter commented, shaking his head fondly. “I assume you know that at the moment I am only looking to cover the rest of Summer, as my better half has left me unexpectedly stranded. I mean, the contract gets renewed in September, so if it works…” he babbled, stopping as Draco put his hand up in front of his chest.
He lingered for a moment, watching Draco curiously, his head tilted in consideration. “I don’t know where you are going, but I hope you’ll find happiness once you get there.” And with that, he gave a final wave and disappeared into the crowd.
“Oh.” Lupin said dumbly, running a hand across his face.
“Don’t do anything stupid, Draco. You are better than this”.
Having a free period after Defence, Theo and Draco sent Blaise on his way to Arithmancy and decided to take advantage of the good weather. With the sun kissing their cheeks, they discarded their robes and walked towards the lake. “Perfect” Theo sighed in contentment, plopping his satchel unceremoniously against the trunk of a three. Around them, quite a few other students were enjoying the late September day. The scent reaching them from the Gardens was delicious, and Draco let his body melt to the ground.
There it was, his fear slammed in his face, not unlike Potter did. Not hidden, deep inside him, but out in the open. To be dealt with. He was angry at being caught out.
“Err. . . You need to pour the content of this bottle into the surface and then touch it. . . Ehm, I guess a finger should do”. They stood awkwardly next to each other until the other boy said “Well, if you are set. . . I —“
Harry could be a boy, somewhere along the sand and the ocean, while the men fought in the conflict he had already given so much of his youth to. It felt somewhat wrong, making the choice for him, but then Harry hadn’t chosen to be the obsession of a madman either.
In Draco’s unbiased opinion, they had been doing just fine. Best 11 years of his life.
But the clock ticked to zero and the steps were now voices and Dumbledore was falling with all his answers. Draco stood frozen, fingers tight around two wands and a glass vial. Until Snape’s hand tugged at his wrist, dragged him down the stairs and eventually lost grip in the chaos waiting for them inside the castle.
Draco sighed again, wondering what he got himself into “You are terrible motivator” he scolded “But a good friend”.
Amycus was scanning the room when he stopped on Theo, and Draco’s heart sank. “Nott, perhaps” the Death Eater said, putting a hand on Theo’s shoulder. Draco saw his friend moving backwards out of the touch, eyes wild, but Amycus didn’t seem to notice and continued “lets see if you are as good of a wizard as your brother was”.
It was his first time inside someone else’s mind and he found that the journey was quite different from apparition or even using a portkey. No unpleasant tug in the middle, none of the dizziness he had come to associate with teleporting to another material place. Simply a shift in and out of his body, almost nice, like a cool wave rippling through his inner essence. He was in the Headmaster’s office and at the same time he wasn’t.
He swallowed twice against the lump in his throat and blinked, willing the tears back. He had never cried in front of anyone but his mother, and he certainly wasn’t going to break apart in a pissy alley with Potter’s fanclub Leader as his witness.
“Why are you telling me this?” He asked.
Lupin, as per usual, ignored the rudeness. “I guess some harmless stuff like that just stayed with him, like an echo. It will make it easier for his mind to adapt again to the countercharm. Is that the only thing that you have noticed?”
Draco looked in horror as Longbottom rose to his feet and, keeping his eyes fixed on the other man, spat “Harry was a better teacher and a more powerful wizard that you’ll ever be”. Apparently Potter attitude was contagious. Although fundamentally stupid, Draco was impressed with Longbottom’s audacity, as he had begrudgingly been with Potter’s before.
Also, from now on the POV will mainly be Draco’s only
Draco feigned horror and the Gryffindor let out a loud chuckle. “No, not like that. It was mutual. I just think there is potential there. . . Terry is obsessed with dragons, he is going to Romania after graduations. We just want different things”. He shrugged again.
As per usual, I love your comments🙃
Let me know in the comments if you ship Draco and Cat Ron as much as I do
So the flowers meanings are
Lupin smiled sadly “It’s an adaptation of a charm that I haven’t used in many, many years. I had to tune it into your magical core, for the lack of better, as I didn’t really have a location exactly. . . Well, it’s complicated, but her magic is connected to yours by familiarity and it picked up her “signal”.” He made finger quotes in the air, looking awkward “All you need to know is that as long as your mother’s name is on that page she is we- alive.” He corrected, unwilling to make a promise he couldn’t keep.
Potter? Potter found the bat-like skeletal horses lovely? The idea was actually a bit ridiculous, and Draco felt a veil of sadness lift from his shoulders. The idea of the Gryffindor cooing and petting the creatures,in the same odd way Luna had done before, almost provoked a chuckle to escape his throat. Then he remembered, Potter could see them too. Harry, his brain automatically calling him Harry whenever he felt emotionally close to the other boy, could see them too. And had been able for far longer. With that in mind, the image of 14 years old Harry, scared and angry on top of Cedric’s body while screaming to the world the return of Lord Voldemort, didn’t seem pathetic and weak as it had 3 years before. Harry, who had seen death at 14 and still wanted to fight. Harry, who had been witness of horrors even before being old enough to remember them. And Draco, that at 14 still lived a life of privilege and love, because even though his parents had pushed him to achieve, they really loved him, had made fun of that little boy’s weaknesses when in truth he was much stronger. He had been one of those people, like his friends now, that laughed at the misery of others. He saw himself in Vincent, in Greg and Millicent and the others, grinning over their victims, proud idiots. Now he knew pain, he knew fear. In the comfort of the forest, in his secret place, there was no reasons for pretending and his feelings were there, for nobody and the world to see. And this girl, this target of bullies like him, could read it all over his face but instead of taunting him she talked to him, like he was worthy.
“What I mean is” He said, pausing with a sigh “Aren’t you scared?”
“I think Longbottom would like to try the Cruciatus curse, see if a little bit of pain teaches him how to treat his superiors”
There was no going back.
“The train, you say?” The Headmaster demanded. There were no traces of crazy in his voice and Draco wanted to ask “how”, because it wasn’t fair to sound that composed on the edge of madness.
It was gonna be a fucking long night.
“But you would not have taken her classes,” said The Dark Lord. “For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“I think Harry wouldn’t want any more people to die”, she said, looking at her friends. “I like Harry” she added, more to herself, and with that Draco watched her walk away to join the group.
That. The motive that brought him there, in the Headmistress’s office. Draco couldn’t understand why people were so civil with him when he had done nothing to deserve it.
“Well, you do tend to stick together” observed Finch-Fletchley. Most of the table was glaring at Theo by now.
The weak illumination coming from the dining room projected long shadows across the kitchen, painting Lupin’s face with harsh stokes of black. It made him lose all his soft, worn edges, the one that separated the man from the creature. In that light it was hard to distinguish the unthreatening, almost unassuming figure that was his former Professor, and it was terrifying.
“Well, boy?” Prodded the werewolf.
Draco glanced back a couple of times between the Gryffindor and the box in his hands, and Potter started to look embarrassed.
“I am not sure I know how” she said, voice broken.
Harry laughed with that pure sound Draco was getting addicted to.
She pursed her lips and looked at the fire again “My beliefs, they are all that I have left”.
Draco smothered his face in one of the pillows and groaned.
He was just making his back to where he was previously standing when a hand grabbed his arm.
This is mainly dialogue actually. I hope I did fine and that it flows. It’s a bit of a filler chapter but I need to get Draco on that plane 🧐
On his way out he bumped into the Headmaster.
“Very well” Professor Achebe said, turning her attention back to the class “I am actually glad for Mister Smith’s intervention, as it demonstrate how the rule of thinking before acting doesn’t apply only to physical attacks. You are at an age in which you should understand well that grouping people under categories based on a few examples is detrimental. No two snowflakes are alike, after all”.
His reverie was interrupted by the arrival of Snape, and “Severus, please...”. Then two words, spoken with rage and disgust, and green light and a soft, horrendous thump. Sound, light, sound. And then nothing, for a moment or for hours, days, weeks. Snape’s voice, telling him to follow, and it was all mechanic movements after that. Running, dodging, getting away, surviving. Somewhere, a cry of rage and shock, and maybe panic. Potter, he knew it. Don’t be afraid, Potter, Harry, the name coming in the moment of kinship, two boys so young and so terrified. He knew that, as well.  Don’t be scared, Harry, because Dumbledore is dead and you are all we have left. I can’t afford to hate you anymore, because I am scared enough for both of us and I need you, i need hope, to save me from myself.
“I am” he murmured. Scared. Sorry. Wrong.
“Thanks, Potter” Draco said. The Gryffindor nodded without looking back, then walked away.
Harry narrowed his eyes, and the yellow actually contrasted well with his dark hair. “Its truly remarkable, how you bully your way into comfort”. He observed, almost impressed.
“Hermione. Harry!” Boot yelled, and suddenly they were all over the newcomers.
He shook his head to get rid of the feeling and he glanced up again. The other wizard was regarding him curiously, an eyebrow raised.
A twirly, lavender font that stated “Le Parfait Paris” took over most of the car’s side, and Draco noticed that there weren’t any back doors, like the taxi had. He resigned to slide in the passenger seat, fasting his seat belt as per Lupin’s instructions. He was aware that this particular Muggle’s job qualification didn’t encompass driving, and he couldn’t help feeling a slight unease, like mounting behind someone else’s broom. The boy looked to be in his late teens, maybe a couple of years older than himself, but Draco couldn’t recall for certain when people started learning how to drive. Both the bus and the taxi drivers had seemed much older, and he hoped this guy knew what he was doing.
Also, I am technologically impaired, so unfortunately every time I write something in italic this website reformats it to just plain text, and I had to use “” instead. I hope it’s ok anyway.
“You know what, you can fuck off”, Theo suddenly lashed, leaving Draco to watch the other boy’s retreating form in bewilderment. There was something wrong with him, and Draco was beginning to worry.
“They surely don’t give a good first impression” he said, in lieu, nodding in the direction of the creatures.
The other wizard stammered, unsure, although he didn’t look surprised. “But. . . I-why?”. It was a plea more than a question and, not for the first time, Draco thought about how deeply Potter was loved.
Longbottom looked back towards the big oak door, shaking his head slowly “Out. . .outside”.
With that thought in mind, he found a secluded spot and apparated back to Cardiff.
“No.” Draco interrupted again, raising to his feet. “As extravagant as it might sound to you, I need sleep.” He deliberately ran his eyes over the other man’s figure, mouth twisted in disdain. He wasn’t sure when was the last time Lupin had slept, but the weariness from the approaching full-moon only accentuated further the signs of exhaustion on his already pale skin.
Prompted by their long-established pattern, Draco snapped “I am not a bigot, Pott-“. He faltered as soon as he realised his mistake, but his mind could only provide a lame “P-Potty”.
“One way or another, there is little time. Lets us discuss your options, Draco.”
“Muggles are people, Draco. And Harry might have not been lucky with the ones he grew up with but he spent more than half of his life as one of them. He knew it in his bones how to adapt, and it was the safest option. Magic is not everything, despite what you were raised to believe”.
The soft rosey light reflected on Harry’s glasses, pink and gold. “Hey” he responded, and Draco felt like climbing a steep set of stairs. The first step had been taken.
Harry had been asleep for three days, his mind slowly adjusting around the new memories.
So long, in fact, that he couldn’t really recall the exact shade of her eyes or whether her smile had really been as bright as he remembered. So long that, sometimes, he found himself frantically rummaging about in his drawers just to look at her one more time. He would stare at her pictures, drinking in all the details that, later, were inevitably bound to fade in the void of his memory, like leaves in the current.
The small homage to Harry’s parents felt flat when compared to the enormity of what he was doing, yet the insistent voice in his mind commanding his actions kept reminding him that no magic had been able to save James and Lily Potter.
On one side, provided he could find their location in the first place, he was doubtful his little stunt with their Ring Leader had brought him the favour of any of the members of the Order. On the other, he wasn’t that deep in denial to keep pretending he still wanted the dream-life of a Death Eater. He was stuck and his only hope was the man in front of him, who was eyeing him with a mix of impatience and weariness. It was probably time to tune down on the insults.
“Then maybe you should look into a substitute for the adder”
And Draco once again reflected on the power of actions, and how a simple phrase of acceptance had change the course of everything. Blaise wasn’t the only one to be impressed.
“Watch it.” Dumbledore instructed, resigned. “You are not a killer, Draco, but you are also a survivor, and you want this war to end. I wish I had more time to explain, more time to lift this burden from your hands, but I am dying tonight. Find Harry”. Then, to the air, again “Remus, please”.
Draco nodded, trying to contain his nerves. He barely registered as the other boy moved a little further to have a private conversation into one of those cello-phones things. In just a little while he would see Potter again.
“I told you, Ron. He was behind us in the Great Hall and then he was gone”.
With a laugh, Harry kicked his legs and sped away in the air. Draco stared for a while at the way he graciously looped and turned like he was born to fly. Yes, he was afraid. But it was a new, exciting kind of fear.
“Fine.” Draco truly hoped that, if there was justice in this world, he would be amply rewarded for the shit he had to put up with.
“A few months too many!”
Draco held a breath and reached out. He plucked the keyring, holding it as far away from his body as he could. He made sure not to touch the little wooden ball dangling from it, the room number painted on it almost invisible under layers of dirt. It looked extremely sticky and Draco had no intention to find out if it felt just as much.
After a quick Sonorus Slughorn booming voice resonated trough the dormitories and bleary eyed students started to appear in the Common Room, until the place was filled with squirming young people, insisting for answers. The Professor tried to maintain a certain order and explained them that the castle was under attack and they were required to follow him to the Great Hall where further actions to assure their safety would take place.
“Wait, why don’t you send her instead?” It was a weak objection, one not carrying much hope.
In this climate of animosity the Carrows still found some allies and Vincent and Greg were between the ones more eager to aid in inflicting punishments. After years living in his shadow, Draco found that his friends were happy to prove themselves good at something and showed a viciousness he didn’t think they had in them. They too had taken the Mark, just before the beginning of the school year, but while Draco was having second thoughts, they were clearly dedicated to the cause. When the Defence classes, that were now communal for all the seventh years, had turned into evident teaching of the Dark Arts, the two, Vincent especially, had embraced the opportunity to gain experience at the other students expenses. Draco believed that many of them were allowed into the class just to be used as experimental material.
Lupin was already in the kitchen, hunched over a cup of coffee. Draco snatched the pot from the counter and drank directly from it, swallowing it all in two big gulps.
His mother was right, they did do some growing up. He read her words of apology once more and knew he needed to talk to Theo, who was strangely missing from their room.
The two of them had just made it back from seeing Potter’s landlord. As the idiot had predicted, Miss Pérez was easily convinced. A woman in her early forties, she had a strong accent and a striking face.
As the two inconvenient nuisances they so insisted on being, it was only natural that Potter’s sidekicks chose that exact moment to cross paths with him.
The airport was busy and his eyes got caught up again in the stange, effortless way in which airplanes around him seemed to take off in the sky as if they weighed nothing. It was magic, Draco thought with wonder.
He fell into place in line behind a tired looking family, mindful to keep a safe distance away from exuberant feet. He was getting increasingly agitated and the two little imps chasing each other in the confined space in front of him didn’t help settling his nerves.
“Stupefy”. Draco’s vision went black.
Still, he wasn’t sure what to say, how to talk to this person so different from him. Luna, on the other hand, seemed happy to do all the talking. She looked back at the Thestrals and said sweetly “They might look a bit daunting, but me and Harry find them quite lovely”.
When his wand started buzzing insistently next to his ear just a few hours later, he was unfortunately still 17, still wrapped in Potter’s clothes and, worst of all, he still had a flight to catch.
Draco wanted to snap at her, asker why was she even talking to him. She was batty, after all, it was common knowledge around the school. She even looked the part, with her large dreamy eyes and crazy accessories. But Draco was lonely, and although most of the time he didn’t have the strength to care, she was there in that moment. Is she worthy of your time? younger Draco would have asked. But older Draco had seen the actions of people he had surrounded himself with in the previous years, the cruel mirth in their eyes while they watched their classmates scream in pain at their feet, and was reevaluating his idea of worthy. In just a few days he was going home for the holidays, back to the Manor, back to feeling scared all the time, and Luna was there and she wasn’t scary at all.
Out of depth and time in between the tees and shorts clad youths of the Californian coast. Maybe the potion had wanted to give him just that, a private corner of “different” where he could feel the most like himself, as much as he himself would never have dared to associate with such an establishment before. As it was, he felt quite at ease in the presence of the stranger in front of him and her odd taste in furnishing.
“And aren’t you?” Draco couldn’t stop himself from asking, recalling the way the other boy had never seemed able to stop himself from being the self appointed hero of every injustice.
“Well, your strange fascination with redheads, that you should be scared about” Draco said, curling is lip in mock disgust.
In that moment, one glimpse at Harry, looking lost and still too addled to even notice the Patronus, was all it took.
Blaise voice resonated in his ears like a mantra “We are just trying to survive, to see the end of this war a way or another”.
But Potter didn’t stop at the snitch. He kept speeding towards the ground, broom gone, and he was falling. Falling. Falling.
Potter’s delighted laugh followed him all the way to his room.
That night, Draco thought about the letter, about the comfort he had found in his own gardens during dark times. About how lovely it would be to have his final rest surrounded by the beauty of life.
They ate in silence, the only sound the clinking of cutlery against the plates.
“No, you can’t,” Draco replied, his wand hand shaking very badly. “Nobody can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.”
“I would get it if you rather not. But I’d like to see. . . To understand. . . “ It was hard to explain what he was trying to achieve, as he was unsure of it himself “At my trials, if we want to call them so, they said it was Dumbledore’s wish to protect my soul. Snape had tried to help me, all along, but I was too arrogant. . .Sure that all he wanted was to steal my glory” He swallowed “I wanted revenge. . . On you, Potter. For something that wasn’t even your fault. Then I suppose I was just too desperate to see reason. . . I was the one that had to do it, I couldn’t take the risk. . . When the time came, and he did it instead, I was relieved”. Draco felt suddenly tired. Old.
The Carrows intimated for Boot to stop his cheerful praise of Potter and his friends. It’s all lies, they said. But Draco knew from the excited whispering going around the Hall that the students believed it. That they believe Potter was strong. That they had a chance to win the war.
“Not exactly” Lupin actually smiled at that “but close. Do you remember how Hermione won a bottle of felix felicis in Slughorn’s competition?”
I’m not sure this chapter is any good and I’m not rereading it but I feel the story will never progress if I don’t just go for it and get it out. I will probably correct all the many mistakes later. Thank you for reading ❤️
Never mind. People talked and, without any evidence, Draco knew Potter would keep the ordeal between the two of them. For all his flaws, the Gryffindor wasn’t one to wash his dirty laundry in public and Draco begrudgingly admired him for it.
It was so early that the room was drenched in darkness, a single sliver of first morning light barely filtering through the heavy drapes. Draco covered his face with his hands and let out a muffled scream.
“I was aware that the inability of keeping your mouth shut was a Gryffindor’s trait, but this is edging on self arm”.
He scratched the back of his head, stalling for words. “We all have flaws. Take Dumbledore and Snape, for example. Were they good men? Ultimately. But they made plenty of bad decisions”. He turned to the graves, that were barely visible between the branches of the lush vegetation. “It’s all a matter of what we learn from our errors.”
And people called him selfish!
Draco dreamt of Quidditch of all things. At first it was freeing, the bite of wind on his cheeks and his feet dangling miles above the ground, like he was on top of the world. Like he wasn’t suffocating in responsibilities and dirt. Even in his subconscious he sensed it, the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of the chase, and leave it to him to feel the most alive while he was dreaming.
It wasn’t until they had made their way downstairs and Potted had asked “Do you want to take one of the skateboards, or I am sure you could borrow Scott’s bike?”, that he remembered how utterly fucked he actually was.
“Luna, we are not supposed to —“
Draco rolled his eyes, pondering if he could flip off someone he had technically just met, but the bus driver was starting to glare impatiently. With a last glance at his future flatmate, he hopped off, muttering “Ask me again when we actually start living together”.
“That’s my point —“
“Wait I- I’ll help you!”
Theo’s father, that up until then had looked at them in shock, gazed quickly at his companion on the floor.
He passed it to the other boy “Open it”.
Thanks for reading and sticking with me all this time✌🏼
"Blaise I'm in a routine. What do you want"
"I most certainly did not"
Harry hung his head back and sighed. Jesus Christ, what was wrong with him? He wasn't saying he didn't like Draco. However it would be a hell of a lot easier if he didn't, and then he wouldn't have to deal with these, weird emotions he was feeling. Couldn't he just go back to hating Draco, like the good old days, where everything seemed fine and normal.
Lily wouldn't agree to go out with him until junior year, and the way she agreed was not the way a lot of love stories go. Lily's sarcasm was the reason the two were married, on the soccer field, Sirius and Peter kept asking if she would ever go out with Jame's. Pestering her over and over again. It was a big playoff game, so Remus was announcing plays of the game when,he said this,
"Wait" The twins looked back.
"Wow" Harry laughed "Does Dad or Mom know yet"
"Fred,George what's wrong" Ron asked
~~~~~~~~
"So what even was that" Harry couldn't possibly remember correctly that his friend had just kissed him, he hadn't right? He didn't know what to do, he couldn't date a teammate people would think he was bias, plus he had just broken up with Ginny, and everything was big ball of confusion shifting around in his mind and leading him to make the worst and most idiotic mistakes someone could think of in a lifetime.
"Well, just so you know, you made a good choice switching teams" He laughed mostly to himself, and Harry felt silly for feeling so reassured by this, that he had made the right decision. Because no kiss, or fuck had ever felt that good. He was surprised he knew what he was doing, and the feeling of pride was still washing over him over the fact he had made Seamus cum, which was still on him, he grabbed his uniform's tie and wiped it off.
Jesus Fucking Christ
Song-Shark Attack by grouplove
"Okay what ever you say golden boy" They smirked
Insted of being mad Harry felt kind of proud of him, then Draco turned around and looked at Harry's blushing face.
Walking home from the restaurant, meant no car, and no car meant bus. Which was torture device in itself. But again insuring someone didn't ruin the Strokes for Harry was much more important then comfort of your car and your pride when boarding the bus.
"Last time I checked you still scored, and we still won. No need to get your panties in a twist because of your lack of skills on the field"
"Because you love me" Jame came up behind her grabbing her waist and kissing her cheek.
Draco spent most of his time in the shower next to his bedroom, so he didn't have the time to check his phone. Monday morning however he was finishing up his run when Blaise called.
"Hey Wood" He smiled at his teammate, Oliver was always there for everyone on the team, ready to help teach someone keeper, skills, if they wanted to learn, or he would miss a game. Harry looked up to me, trusted him completely. Maybe that extra trust is what made the next thing that happened happen. How Harry ended up snogging his team's Goalie. One shouldn't bore you with the conversation that took place next, and frankly Harry couldn't remember really. It was like he blinked and was in the passengers' side of Oliver's car.
James made a confused face "Short one with the heavy Irish accent" He intimidated it as he questioned who the boy was.
Thanks for reading!!!
Lily looked up at the ceiling with a pleading gesture "Why did I have three kids" She said joking
But Hogwarts happened. His mom somehow convinced his dad to stop sending their son to Christian boarding school, and he came home. She missed her only son, even with him in it the house was almost silent, so with just her and Lucius it was eery. Just having the presence of her son was nice. There aren't many out gay kids at Hogwarts but enough that Draco learned it was normal, and at 14 he could finally say it to himself. It wasn't like he was hiding it but it also wasn't anybody's goddamn business. Blaise and Pansy never asked, they might know, they did know him since he was 2 but it didn't matter. Plus Hogwarts brought him Harry.
“Uh… Thanks, Draco. Really.”
you don’t understand! He’s going to be-!”
Harry’s head felt like it was spinning with everything he was being told. The Chamber of Secrets had definitely been opened before. It was open whenever it was that this Riddle person went to Hogwarts. Who knew how long ago that could have been? It had
Everything shoved into his bag, Harry picked himself up and made a hasty escape, leaving Malfoy behind him still cursing his name to the high heavens.
The two of them spent a few seconds looking each other over, sizing each other up before Draco finally nodded. “I suppose you might be right.”
Draco seemed to take that moment to compose himself. “I’m going to have to ask you to leave, Potter, as I need to close up my shop. We do uphold regular business hours.”
for no good reason and it’s only been up two days.”
As the two of them sighed, he watched Fred shift from foot to foot, and George rubbed at the back of his neck. “Geez. That must have been a great surprise for him to come in to.”
“A coffee.”
’ To his astonishment, the text began to fade quickly until it was gone, leaving just a blank page.
blood purity discrimination. In fact, one may say it would be discrimination if I were to give you the flowers your ordered at only half the price that those of different blood purity statuses pay it at. Wouldn’t you agree, Potter?”
Over the next week, Malfoy seemed to get himself into a panic, snapping at near anyone that spoke to him, even his friends. They were just outside the Great Hall when Harry heard him, “
“We’re gonna go say hello to Malfoy.”
The two of them looked at him before nodding and sighing. “You just seem very interested in Malfoy these days, Harry.”
Huffing, Harry turned away from the dwarf. “
Harry drew back a bit. He was… definitely uncomfortable with that. The way he saw it, all he did was survive. Not that that did much good for him. ‘
“Pretty dick of someone, you ask me.”
Draco turned to the flowers he had been putting together when Harry had come in and picked them up, vase and all. “Yes, of course.”
“Wow. Uh… What exactly
“He was all grown up.”
shop.
Harry watched as he examined the arrangement, tilting his head this way and that before he raised his wand and rearranged the way the flowers sat in the vase. Was the exact minute way they looked so important? Harry shook his head. He wasn’t sure he would
That had Draco straightening up as he frowned, looking Harry over. “They said that you asked them to pop over and help straighten up.”
Harry didn’t stop in again for a few days. Not until he looked in on his way to work, and it looked like Draco was having an argument with one of his customers. Well… It looked more like the woman was having an argument, and Draco wasn’t doing much more than just fielding her responses and trying to keep from escalating the situation. Harry could respect that, but it also looked like it wasn’t working all that well.
It felt like he waited
“Draco, we’ve checked the halls a million times, that book of yours is nowhere to be seen.”
Now Harry felt like his head was spinning, and he was trying to catch up behind him as Draco ran circles round him. Note to self, never let Draco interact with the twins. It could only end in disaster. “A coffee. You mean you want me to bring you one, or…”
“Potter,” Draco said with a nod to him. Stubborn prick. “As I hope you can see, I’m in the middle of something with one of my customers, I’ll get to you in a moment.
Well, that was a good question. Harry looked around the shop. It really felt like it was filled to the top with flowers. “You got your shop back together.”
Draco smirked this time, his hand held out towards Harry. “There. You see? I’m only trying to serve everyone equally, after all. So it would only be fair of me to insist that you pay the same amount as everyone else, Ms. Anders.”
Getting back over to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, Harry was still glancing behind himself, trying to reconcile the Malfoy he knew back in school with this new Malfoy who seemed to be entirely different. He bumped into something and stepped away. “Oh. Sorry, Fred.”
understand the man in front of him. When Draco finally nodded, he turned to face Harry. “So, what do you want?”
Looking up to the both of them, he nodded. “I guess so, yeah. You know Draco Malfoy’s got a shop in the Alley, now?”
“Great welcome to the neighborhood, isn’t it?”
Harry thought it over before finally nodding. “Yep. Sounds like discrimination to me.”
His mother? What did Draco’s mum have to do with this? “No no, Charity, mother’s got no such hand in my arrangement. The shop is entirely mine, the work done myself.”
Everything. So he really had just been keeping a diary?
Looking between the two, he gave a shake of his head. He never understood what it was the two of them were on about. So, he may as well keep going. “Yeah, the shop a few doors down that just opened up a few days ago.
“Did we say it mattered?”
The twins, to Harry’s surprise, looked to each other and groaned. “Thought we were done.”
And it looked the same as the book Malfoy had been writing in all year.
after thinking about it for a moment. “I suppose it’s all the same. I appreciate the help they gave, though I had been close to not allowing them inside the shop to begin with. It was only after they said you sent them that I decided to give them that chance and let them inside.”
Hearing a loud laugh, Harry turned.
“Past all this.”
Making a face at the words, Harry shook his head. “I like to help people plenty. But working in the Ministry and facing off dark wizards my whole life? Thanks, but no thanks.”
Draco smiled at him. “Of course. You’ve probably helped me twice or even thrice just in the past few weeks, not counting… the rest of our lives. It’s the least I can do.”
This was it. This was Harry’s chance to see what it was. Was it just a diary? Maybe he’d been writing all the dark spells and curses that Snape and Lucius Malfoy taught him.
Tom Riddle. The person who owned this book? Or maybe just the book itself? Malfoy had been writing in a book that could talk back. ‘
Tilting his head back, Harry read the sign that had been put up.
He saw Draco staring at him, and the blond rolled his eyes. “I swear, the day that lapels fell out of our daily wardrobe was the day true culture died.” He leaned forward and, pointing his wand, pressed the flower against Harry’s robes, spelling it on there like a pin that a man might wear on his suit. “There you are.”
“You’re just too paranoid, Harry-kins.” Not willing to argue with them and have the two of them run him in circles, Harry shrugged the two of them off and started to take stock. September was coming closer and closer, and all the Hogwarts students were stopping in to get their pranks and jokes to get ready for the school year.
Harry watched with fascination as the woman grumbled and handed over a few sickles. “It’s not a very masculine thing, is it, to be running a floral shop? What would your father have to say about this, Draco?”
What was wrong with him? Maybe someone had Charmed him to be nicer? That made sense. That seemed like the only explanation for his strange behavior. Or maybe… Maybe he’d just gotten more mature?
To his surprise, Draco finally
let this thing kill anyone this time- He stopped himself when more writing from Riddle appeared, however. ‘
Looking through it all, he nodded. They had sold a fair amount of Skiving Snackboxes, it looked… Eyes were on him. Someone was staring at him. Turning, he saw that the twins were whispering while glancing to him. “
“A carnation?”
And… they were gone. Harry shook his head setting his things down in the backroom. He never understood the two of them. May as well take stock of what they lost in the latest stages of research and development.
Harry looked at the shop again before staring at him. “What are you doing?”
In the windows, in the boxes outside the windows, in pots on either side of the door. If you had asked Harry, he would have said that the shop had thrown up flowers.
“Jensen.”
Harry watched after her before finally looking to Draco again. “‘Blood purity discrimination.’”
Finding a free moment away from it all, Harry finally looked down at that book again. There was a lot more here going on than it seemed like. Picking up a quill, he dipped it in ink and wrote, ‘
The two of them both turned at hearing the bell ring above the door. “I’m here for my floral arrangement.” It was some witch that frequented Diagon Alley, but rarely if ever had stopped into the Wheezes.
Grabbing a cup of coffee. With Draco Malfoy. That was definitely something he never thought he would be planning, but there he was. “Yeah. Sure.”
The woman handed over the money with no fuss, and soon enough, she was walking out the door with her little parchment slip. It was nice, that Draco seemed so natural for this. “Hey.” Harry held no reservations about stepping forward and taking up his attentions.
Some days, it was better to just not question the two of them.
He whirled to face Harry, and Harry saw the way he wanted to spit out a response before he took a breath and nodded. “Potter. Can I help you?”
“It has been a couple years since school. People can change in that amount of time.”
Harry’s eyes nearly popped out of his head when he read that. ‘
“Yes. A green one, in fact.” Draco turned back, removing the lily from his robe and attaching the carnation. Wait a minute.
Turning back around, he saw Draco was holding out… a flower? “Oh, wow, uh… Thanks?” What was Harry supposed to do with a flower, exactly?
“...Nevermind, Harry. You’re not ready, yet.”
Draco shrugged at Harry, looking away from him and trying to reproduce that cool, aloof nature he’d commanded when they were younger. It wasn’t working so much on Harry anymore. “I had thought perhaps it was your way of extending the olive branch, so to speak. It doesn’t matter, it’s in the past, now.”
“No, Freddie, we in fact did not.”
“I mean the two of us should go out for a coffee later. Unless you don’t want the flower?”
Any amusement Draco held was immediately wiped away at the mention of his father. “Pardon my language, Ms. Parkinson, but I don’t give a damn about what my father’s got to say about the matter. Thankfully, we won’t have to bear ourselves with such knowledge, as he’s received a lifetime’s sentence in Azkaban.”
“Lost in the clouds there, Harry?”
Oh. So that was what Fred and George had- Wait. “Sending them over? I didn’t send anybody anywhere.”
shop?” What in the hell was Draco Malfoy doing opening up a flower shop in Diagon Alley. Harry opened his mouth to ask that exact question before Malfoy was heading back through the door.
“Jensen. Alright, that should be ready this time tomorrow morning, all I need is a down payment from you.”
Looking down he frowned. “Why a green carnation?”
“It’s a Tiger Lily.” A… tiger… When Harry looked up, Draco was still staring at the flower, and almost looked sad. “Unfortunately, we haven’t yet bred a ‘Lion’ variation.”
Harry never would have expected Draco to be the type of person to believe that one good deed deserved another. But then, if you had asked him a couple months ago, he wouldn’t have expected Draco to be the type of person to open up a flower shop, either. Maybe there was more to Draco than met the eye. “Thanks.”
The woman shot him a nasty look and turned and left without another word. Harry took in a sharp breath, looking over him. “Well, that went well.”
Stepping inside like shop, Harry only took a moment to assess the situation before he stepped forward towards the woman and Draco. “Hello there.”
“You’re not… mad? You’re not upset? Your shop was just
“Yes,” he was told, and he looked back up to see Draco staring at him with those piercing, cold eyes. “I try to look ahead, now, rather than backwards.”
The man didn’t even seem to see Harry, he was only levitating a sign behind him, and Harry watched him put the sign up at the top of the building using a Sticking charm. The man stood there, his hands on his hips as he looked over the shop, and Harry took the opportunity to walk over to him to examine him properly. He still looked posh and proper, but he seemed… Happier. More relaxed. He was smiling at the shop, and that was the part that really took Harry off guard. “Malfoy?”
Charity looked like she didn’t entirely believe him. “I see. Do I owe you anything, then?”
Holy Merlin. Harry stopped in his tracks. The shop looked like it had been hit by a Bombarda or two. Hearing footsteps coming up behind him, he turned to see Malfoy walking up the alley to his shop. He rose an eyebrow at Harry before turning to look at his shop. Harry watched his eyes widen as he took it all in, and then…
Of course, idiot that he was, his bag strap broke at the moment, and both their things were sprawling across the ground. Harry knelt down to the ground, cursing himself all the while, Malfoy doing the same thing. “You stupid idiot! Lookit what you’ve done to my bag!” Malfoy and Dudley would either catch on like a house on fire, or tear each other apart, he swore it.
She never entirely believed him, but he digressed. Looking to one of the buildings that had been empty for as long as he could remember, he paused. It… wasn’t empty. The drab, grey building that had been emptied out since the end of the war when Harry had started to work at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes was now filled with bright light and
The twins looked to each other, raising an eyebrow before patting Harry’s shoulder. “Man the shop, Harry.”
Once Harry stepped outside, he pulled his robe up to sniff at the flower. It was sweet.
’. Who was Tom Riddle? Not finding anything, and not knowing any charms to reveal anything, Harry finally tucked the book away.
Malfoy rose an eyebrow at him. “Well, I believe that I’m opening my shop.”
Ms. Anders picked up her vase of flowers and turned on her heel with a sniff, leaving the shop.
It was only two days later that Harry was walking down the alley and looking around at the shops. It looked like Flourish and Blotts had a new biography about him. Harry would have to pick that up later and see what crackpot new rumors and theories everyone was circulating about him.
Harry did his best to give him a smile. “I guess someone has to. I… still haven’t thought much about what I want to do with my life. I work in the joke shop, right now, and I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting on everything that’s happened, and the way things could have gone. I try to learn from the past.”
“Yes,” Draco groaned, rubbing at his temples. “I’m certain that will not be the last I hear of this nonsense.” He looked up at Harry, and Harry saw the hesitation before he finally nodded. “Thank you, for your assistance. It seems you missed your calling with the Aurors.”
Draco watched him for a moment before finally turning to one of the bunches of flowers. Harry figured that was the end of it and started to turn to leave. “Here.”
“Yes, my shop. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I still have a lot more to do.” And the door closed behind him. Harry was left standing out on the walk, staring at the shop.
Then, more words started to appear.
Draco turned to him, rolling his eyes. “What do you want this time? You know, I’m not a damsel for you to keep barging in here, saving from women with shrill voices and hideous purses.”
Popping himself into the shop, he was pleased to see that it seemed like business was picking up for Draco. He had a couple customers browsing around, and one more that he was talking with. The man was taking notes in a small notepad, looking to be very attentive while he did so. “Mhm. Yes. That’ll look perfect. And what’s the name on that one, love?”
“And there he goes.”
He watched Draco raise an eyebrow before he finally sighed. “I suppose I should offer my thanks to you for sending over your Weasleys.”
Harry couldn’t help but shake his head at the thought of it. Malfoy really was insane.
Now Draco was definitely giving him that wicked Malfoy smirk. “Someone doesn’t know their flower meanings, do they? You may want to look into it. So, have we got a deal, then?”
Was he supposed to be the snapdragon? That was… actually kind of clever. Looking at the shop again, Harry slowly nodded. Draco Malfoy with his own flower shop in Diagon Alley. Huh. That was definitely a new one.
“You didn’t say how much it would cost.”
“Don’t be silly, Harry. We’ll only be a few minutes.”
Well, at least that meant that this wasn’t a part of some Weasley-Malfoy immortal blood feud. Harry nodded along to their little dialogue they had going. “Yeah, definitely. Here’s the thing. He didn’t throw a tantrum or anything. He said he was pissed, yeah, but he just… got to cleaning.”
Opening up the book and sitting on his bed, there was… nothing. Nothing was there. Harry frowned. ‘
That had Harry’s eyes widen where he’d just caught the words. Including him. Malfoy had been writing about him. What had he been writing? Had he been trying to plan out some horrible ways to get Harry into trouble? Or maybe worse.
someone back then. What if it killed someone now? Finally plucking one or two questions out of the hundreds racing through his mind, Harry wrote, ‘
“Yes, as already agreed upon, you still owe half of the payment.” He took half before he gave her the flowers? That didn’t make sense. Why not have her pay after he made the flowers for her and gave them to her?
Looking him up and down, Harry was certain he saw a trademark smirk, but it was gone as Draco turned away to pick up a flower. “A carnation.”
He’d hardly bothered Harry most of the year, more interested in writing in some old book of his. Probably a diary, or something, knowing the prat. Harry glared as Malfoy laughed at him. “Lookit that! Potter’s got himself a valentine! One of the first years has a crush on him, I’d bet!”
“Anything to… confess?”
“A flower? Just the single one?”
Tearing his gaze away, he peeked at the broom shop. He needed to get back on the stick, so to speak. It was a good idea, and it would help get rid of a lot of that nervous energy he had. At the very least, he needed to pick up new broom polish, because he was certain his was worn out. At this point, it was sounding like he needed to make a shopping list for after work. And he turned to glance at The Snapdragon-
I don’t want to hear whatever it is.” He stormed down the hall and aimed straight for Malfoy to shove against him.
Harry walked the same way as always. It had been a few years since the war, so thankfully, his mere presence in the streets no longer warranted crowds and paparazzi. Instead, he only got a few nods from the regulars around the Alley, and a wave or two from the other shopkeepers. It was nice to not have to worry himself with raging crowds, and girls or women trying to dose him up with love potions every opportunity they had. That first year after the war had certainly made him paranoid. But, well, he liked to tell Hermione that it was paranoia for a good reason, and that he had every right to be concerned over things like that.
Snape, who was sitting at his immediate right, spoke first “My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”
Draco’s heart was hammering in his chest, and his gaze darted in disbelief from the Hawthorn wand back to the boy that just won a war and still was there to return what wasn’t his. “Why?”
“Do you think I will see the dolphins?”, breakfast Harry had asked, eyes wide in wonder, before gleefully shrieking at the endless possibilities of the ocean.
He gave the witch a shrug “Thank you. It was overdue, but yesterday, after Defence —“
He rarely saw his friends, the ones whose parents were involved with or were Death Eaters themselves, and the encounters with Theo, Pansy, Greg and Vince were usually very uneasy and withdrawn. His secretive behaviour in the last year had put distance between him and the others, and he knew that the whole business with Dumbledore had left his friends somewhat shocked. Their arms were, ultimately, unmarked and Draco knew he was alone. Despite being of age, he felt like a child trapped in a role that didn’t belong to him. A new sentiment, regret, planted its seed in the pit of Draco’s stomach, growing and twisting, leaving him with waves of nausea and discomfort. If he could go back and talk to the cocky and proud 16 years old he had been the summer before, Draco was sure a few hexes wouldn’t have gone amiss.
The boy that looked stunned “What?”.
If he hadn’t been so lost in thoughts, the dark crimson stain slowly spreading across the flooring should have been a telltale sign of the other wizard’s presence. But such was that, when he rushed forward and scrambled to rip away the invisibility cloak and found himself staring into green, he was still utterly unprepared.
“Uh-“ he replied dully, still half licking the blood off his cut “Oh, yeah, fine!”. Were all Muggles this amiable or was it just his blasted luck, once again having him sitting next to someone that couldn’t mind their own business? Probably the latter, if he had to base it on how things were going lately.
“Just eat, kiddo. I see people eating all day! . . . Honestly.” She prompted, when it looked like he was still hesitant to pick up his fork. Draco half expected her to start scolding him for how thin he was and decided he was actually too hungry to care about any lingering awkwardness.
“I wasn’t trying not to be seen” Draco retaliated. The other boy turned around, letting his leg dangle from the edge of his makeshift seat and addressed him with a curious tilt of his head. He was holding a small intricate object in his hands, thumb lazily brushing soft circles on the surface, and Draco felt a surge of recognition “Is that a magical puzzle box?”. He had more than once delighted himself by solving the testing riddles but the patience required didn’t seem to click with his idea of the boy in front of him.
What a wanker.
And Draco was scared, because he never wanted to die, but now all he wanted was another day. A day to tell Theo he was sorry, that he was much more than a secret of a boy that gave importance to the opinion of many instead of the feelings of the few that mattered. A day to assure his parents that he loved them even now, more now. To look at Greg and Vincent like equals, like friends, like it wasn’t too late. To tell Granger that he knew his blood was just as red as hers and that she was a witch just as he was a wizard. To tell Potter he understood why he didn’t shake his hand all those years before.
Theo walked on a white path, looking up all the way, not in challenge but not hiding either.
She gave him a long, calculating look. When Draco thought she wouldn’t reply, she spoke “Harry, he sometimes still. . . Feels guilty.”
It worked, somehow. Maybe because they had been children who fought; then boys and they had to fight something bigger; and lastly they were men and tired of fighting. Maybe because Draco had really, really wanted it to work, and Harry went along with it. Harry was wise, nowadays, a little in the way Dumbledore had been. Like a man that had lived through a lot and who tried to be better and to be happy.
“Is that why you are clueless about how to properly work a vhs player? Did you have someone else doing it for you?” Potter joked.
Harry was dead.
“Draco, Draco you are not a killer”
Only when he caught up with the ridiculousness of standing in a place full of people while fussing over hand lotion of all things, he finally tucked the vial into one of the inside pockets and zipped the backpack closed, letting his eyes wander back up.
my dearest Draco,
“What is happening?” Theo asked. He was shaking “Draco?”
And Draco cried.
“And that’s why the spells aimed at the mind are, in my opinion, the most dangerous kind”.
Looking back, he knew his mother had needed the reassurance as much as he did, helpless against a situation out of her control. She had been chasing a flame of hope in the insurmountable darkness of her son’s affliction, trying to find a positive in a pain that she could not make her own.
But the other man didn’t take the bait, just spared him a look one would give to a tantruming child before opening a few doors and dropping a block of cheese, crackers and a spotted banana on the small breakfast table in the kitchen’s corner.
The first thing Draco noticed was that the room had been “cleaned”. He appraised with distaste the wrinkled bed sheets and the old-looking towels piled crookedly on the desk, before pulling his wand out of his magically enlarged jeans pocket. Reveling in using it again after a long day without, he set to “scourgify” every available surface.
All Draco could see now was the destruction of the room and Granger’s blood pooling red on the floor.
Thanks again for reading
Stay, Draco’s mind thought. It was an opportunity, he wasn’t sure for what but he felt like the moment was somewhat important. So he interrupted “I’d like you to stay, if you don’t mind”.
“Theo, listen to me, he was your brother. It’s ok that you want to remember him”.
“You look tired.” He observed, not unkindly, after calming down. “And I actually have to go. I’m sorry but I made plans for dinner a few days ago, but I can get you back to your motel on the bus and then me and Scott can fetch you in the morning with your things.”
“Alluding at something crass happening during your and Potter’s rendezvous.”
All the eyes at the table darted towards the boy. Draco grabbed his knee and tried to squeeze it in warning, but Theo batted him away.
The sound of steps was getting closer and Draco knew. His heart clenched painfully, and suddenly he wanted this long day to last a little bit longer. A little more time.
Draco fixed him with a disbelieving stare, which actually elicited an amused chuckle out of the other wizard “I thought so. She, at least, seems to think that your face that day was the highlight of her year”.
Draco almost lost his footing again. He wheeled around, eyes darting between the other boy and the cat. The cat looked back, his head tilted in judgment.
Draco had to look up then. The other boy’s face was abnormally swollen and pink and the features were so distorted to be unrecognisable. The prisoner was still avoiding his eyes, his own kept downcast, but through the tiny slits in the puffed face Draco could see green irises. Potter, he knew. Merlin, even just by Wasley and Granger’s presence alone, logic wanted that the wizard in front of him was Potter. And Draco was a logical man. Still, his mind was working frantically to find an escape.
He looked up and met his father’s eyes. The man had never looked worse, but his eyes were alive once again. He breathed in twice, slowly, closing them in pain and relief. Then he looked back at Draco “Son. . .”
“Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban. . . . When the time comes, we can protect him too. Come over to the right side, Draco . . . you are not a killer. . . .”
She nodded, sighing.
Potter grabbed two mugs, filling one up from the tap. “Sorry, we never actually got around to buying glasses. Are you sure you are okay with just water?”
At the end, some people stayed behind. Draco, who had been talking to Daphne and Luna, found himself tuning out when the Ravenclaw had breached the subject of Freshwater Plimpies.
This is the link to deviant art again. This really frustrates me to no end!
“He was beautiful, you know.” His mother had once told him in a detached voice, none of the affection that he could hear in Lupin’s present in her words. “Aunt Walbuga had always been severe looking, harsh jaw and small eyes, but her eldest was all pure blood symmetry and charm. You have his eyes, Draco.” She had said, as if talking about the weather. “He could have gone far.”
Potter, the absolute fuckwit, had started wheezing, grabbing him by the arm and, with the half arsed excuse that he was “Home schooled”, dragging him upstairs after a promise that they would be back in the morning.
You’ll come out stronger.
“You’ll like him. Evan, I mean.” Scott affirmed with conviction, finally breaching the topic of Potter that Draco dreaded but at the same time was so curious about. “He is great, Allie wouldn't have left if she could help it. Allie - she is, or was, his roommate. They have been sharing almost from the moment he arrived in the States, and he might look a bit grumpy at the prospect of changing things, but you’ll get along.”
Neither do I. . .Neither do I. But he took her elbow and guided her gently towards Luna anyway.
He knew that some of the Death Eater had managed to sneak their way into the dungeons already, probably looking for their children, but so far most of them had been contained outside the perimeters of the school. Now it was clear that Hogwarts was losing ground. Draco’s stomach churned and twisted and, while the world crumbled around him, he thought of his parents. Once proud, powerful. Now wandless, broken, at the mercy of people they had never showed mercy for. He last saw them at the Manor and even then he knew well that their goodbye, for once full of emotions, could have been the last. He thought of them, that had birthed him into this life hoping to give him everything and were now denied the simple wish to see their son for what could be the final time. He had no doubts the Malfoys, fallen from grace, weren’t between the lucky ones who were helped to sneak into the school in search of their children.
“I have six!” Macmillan was blabbing “I am telling you, do you have a Garden? A proper Garden always has fountains”
“Hell yeh is the Mark, it is. Time you weaklings get your shit sorted” Vincent barking voice called from near the door, startling Blaise awake.
Now, in a shabby motel room, twirling 24 hours worth of golden luck in between his fingers, he was suddenly anxious.
Draco tried to think only of Theo while he forced the Gryffindor to bend and kiss his shoes. Better me than Theo. His wand trained on Longbottom, he didn’t look at the other boy, letting the prickling feeling of Dark Magic flow from his hand. He had used the curse before, but the uncomfortable sensation under his skin never faded. Better me than Theo. “Get up, Longbottom. I’m done”.
“Why did you kiss Boot?” He asked hurriedly.
“Anyway, it’s really not that strange. Think about it this way, your chances to die in a car crash are way higher, and we use cars daily without much fuss.”
So, this is mega cheesy.
“Funny, i thought your blindness was clinically proven”.
Granger and her freckly boyfriend looked like they hadn’t slept in months. Her red-rimmed eyes still glistened with tears and Draco spared Weasley a look of contempt when the ginger sniffed loudly.
Draco felt a bit like an old spinster as they resumed their spying.
So, he had sold his grandfather’s vintage car, almost legally, with just a little push of magic to help move the transaction along.
His internal conflict must have shown on his face, though, because a voice piped up, hesitant.
“People will like you for who you are”. The distraught faces of Ron and Hermione, tear streaked and lost, ignite a different kind of guilt. Some already have, it’s what he wanted to say.
“I’m sorry. . .”
At the swarm of heads, mostly terribly ginger, that surrounded his life. And lastly back at his children again. They had reached him and their arms wrapped around his waist, thin faces tilting upwards in a last greeting before boarding the train. He looked into wide pale-blue eyes and green lovely ones and behind the excitement, behind the trepidation, he could sense a bit of fear. With a smile, he kissed his children goodbye and whispered in their ears “It’s going to be ok”.
It tasted as bitter as the coffee.
When it came to what to do with the space in the four corners, they had stalled. After hours spent without reaching any conclusion someone proposed that, once the last of the students had arrived, they could split into 4 groups and each would be in charge of one.
Snape raised one eyebrow “Well, I am hardly in any faculty to stop you”.
After they left Draco searched for Luna, but she was staring at Macmillan. The Hufflepuff shrugged “It was the truth”.
His father had gotten closer to Potter and was inspecting his face. “There’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be the scar, stretched tight. . .Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”
Still, it was different and his magic had never been the same, never at its full potential.
“Dean.” Draco said.
Ugh, so much for the mild, placating teacher persona. Lupin’s control was slipping and Draco wanted to give it a shove.
“Would you like me to cast an Impervious on your clothes?” Theo asked. He obviously hadn’t bothered on himself, so Draco shook his head.

Vincent’s knee, bouncing with expectant energy. With gleeful anticipation. Draco dug his nails in his own knees and swallowed the bile.
Draco could not deny it, and he grimaced.
“Well, however low your opinion of me might have gotten in the last year, I haven’t actually killed the prat.”
Lupin, the paranoid bastard, hadn’t wanted to involve magic. Consequently, on top of everything else, the fucking man had spent a fair amount of the last three days holed up in one of Cardiff’s public libraries. He had declared that, based on the little fragments of information he had collected during his two-way mirrors voyeurism sessions, he could use one of those metal knowledge boxes of theirs to help him pinpoint the whereabouts of Potter. Draco hoped with all his might that the town north of San Diego he was headed to did in fact include one Harry Poncy-middle-name Potter in its population count.
Anyway this chapter has a few things taken from the original book but hopefully not too much to make it boring.
“You are nothing like your brother” the older Nott spat, looking at his only surviving child with mixed emotions.
“Don’t come and play mates with me, Potter” he spat, voice dripping with venom and wand arm straightening slightly.
Time was passing in a blur of following orders and waiting, his survival instinct taking control of his body like a puppeteer. Then his aunt touched her Dark Mark and Draco froze in terror.
Potter had flushed when Granger had asked the others for permission, to which she had laughed and told them about sending him into a flower shop during their trip “I really needed to get something for. . . A person. Anyway, I was so nervous and I asked Harry to go instead. He spent the best of an hour discussing with a Muggle about the meaning of flowers. . . It was really sweet”. She had added, smiling softly at her friend.
He had felt guilty when he had realised Harry wanted children.
“What an amazing sense of humor, no wonder we are best friends.” Draco scoffed, and then vindictively “And she only has you to thank for her wonderful year, doesn’t she?”
The man gasped from his place somewhere mid-table and hurriedly left, apologising. Draco was disgusted to see a grown man reduced to a whimpering puppet, but were they not all like that, the followers of the Dark Lord? Made to serve, expendable. None of the glory and power his father had talked about, just men driven by their instinct of survival and a sick compulsion to please their leader. Oh how his father had been wrong, and now that he wasn’t in the graces of the Dark Lord any longer, Draco knew he was starting to see that.
The hour was almost up. Draco had helped a little to look for injured people, but mostly he had stayed out of the way of the mourners. The time was ticking. Fast. An hour was barely any time at all, but dragging on forever. A slow torture that was over too soon. He had kept an eye out for any sign of Potter, but the boy was nowhere to be seen. The hour was almost up.
Oddly enough, the first thought that crossed his mind was that the Potter he knew must have been starved because the boy in front of him definitely wasn’t. They were roughly the same height now, Potter an inch or so shorter, not enough for Draco to feel any satisfaction, but gone was the bony prat he remembered from school. The boy in front of him had well defined muscles, broad shoulders and looked healthier than ever. Only by comparison, Draco realised how gaunt and tired his Potter had looked, like the weight of the world was heavy on his shoulders.
“I didn’t even remember about that stupid bint!” He lied, the image of Bell’s seizing body suspended in mid air forever burnt behind his eyelid and in the deep subconscious of his nightmares. “Im under no obligation to tell you anything but. . . A dead man’s last wish, I suppose I owe you that much. It’s ironic, how the Greatest Wizard of our age couldn’t figure out what happened to a 16 years old whose talent only exist in legends and bed-time tales. It’s killing you already, I can see it.” He spat, feeling a rage that wasn’t entirely directed at the man in front of him, a man that he had almost begrudgingly come to respect on some occasions. “Or maybe it’s the guilt eating at your flesh, for not even you could protect our precious celebrity”, he added, glancing at the darkened hand gripping at the rail without any strength if not sheer shock.
Dumbledore, however, called his bluff, seemingly knowing all the struggles Draco had endured during the year, all the horrible things he had almost done. “Maybe your heart wasn’t really in it”
If only I could convince myself of that, was Draco's last bitter thought.
Draco raised an eyebrow at the odd choice of words, but at least they explained the connection between the guy and Potter. The two must be living together.
“It is amazing!” Potter protested, before turning suspicious “If it’s not food, what is it?”
“Thank you. Give my regards to father”. I love you, too.
“My family, I mean, the Dursleys, well. . . They were never my home, really.”
“Not fully. Rees told me the Aurors can wait, but I think I am considering an internship in Rehabilitation and Reintroduction of the Magically and Emotionally Affected. Professor Achebe explained that is similar to Muggle Social Services. . . I would still be following cases with the Aurors, and Hermione is going into law. . .” Harry rubbed his nose and blushed “I don’t know, I feel like I can relate and you know. . . My saviour complex”.
Fucking nice people.
She suddenly turned serious “How is he?”
In that moment, Weasley’s baritone voice resonated from somewhere in the proximity “Harry! Merlin be damned, I am not going to look for you all night”.
“That you like him” Luna replied, matter-of-factly.
The second flight was much longer. He tried fitting his 6 feet frame in the smallest space possible away from the considerable size and sweaty stench of his travelling companion. It only took an hour of uncomfortable shuffling in his seat for Draco to give up. He rummaged in his backpack until he found Potter’s Tshirt, an hasty last minute addition that he had packed that morning without really consciously meaning to do so. The cotton was soft and he rolled it into a ball before wedging it between his seat and the window. Then, careful to shield his movements behind his hands, he uncorked one of the vials of Dreamless Sleep Lupin had provided.
The towel slipped down his legs and for a long moment he stood stark naked against smooth wood, chest heaving spasmodically as if he had been running for miles.
“I seem to be lacking in patience and concentration”, Harry replied, as if reading his mind “Hermione thought I would benefit from the exercise. There’s a treat inside” he pointed at a discarded box behind him with a chocolate frog wrapping on top. “You know, for motivation”.
“Stephen told me she was funny. I used to be jealous, but now I know it wasn’t his fault I didn’t remember. . . I think that’s actually why I’m rarely sad about her, so at the end I’m the lucky one. The one without memories to be sad about.”
“Feeding the Thestrals, of course. Which, If I should listen to Miss Lovegood, is one of your favourite pastimes”.
“Hello?” he demanded, when the greasy man behind the counter didn’t do as much as lifting his eyes from the screen in front of him.
“Well, I would call it Allie-never-outgrew-her playing doctor phase and can go and get stuffed.”
“I will not let you speak ill of a man that had more intelligence in his finger nails that you could ever dream for yourself”. The voice of Professor McGonagall cut trough the outraged whispering, sharp and steady. Draco could see the Transfiguration Professor clenching her fork firmly in one hand, the other, hidden under the table, probably holding her wand just as tight. The light from the floating candles bounced off her glasses,  hiding her eyes behind mirror-like lenses, but he was sure they were alight with fury.
When he felt sufficiently in control and he was sure that nothing supid like a “thank you” was gonna escape his mouth, he snapped the journal shut and turned around.
Draco shook the feelings away and looked around. The slight desaturation of the colours was the only sign that something was amiss, the washed out tones serving as reminder that this was not reality.
“She took the best view!” The other wizard joked, not sounding resentful in the slightest. “And I got stuck with that stunning transmission pole”.
“Boy never sleeps, I swear. Isn’t the new guy for Allie’s room coming today? How is it handling it?”
The woman laughed and Draco was starting to lose the thread of the conversation, growing more nervous by the minute. Every little revelation about Potter’s new life made it obvious how he himself was no longer part of it. The boy that had been such a constant during the most part of his formative years was now as good as a stranger. The realisation left him feeling surprisingly lonely.
“Fuck no. As you helpfully reminded me, I am just the messenger. My job here is done.” He snorted.
“Clearly.” He agreed, mouth curving in what looked suspiciously like a teasing smile.
Lupin's voice was reaching a new level of exasperation that a morning spent buying clothes for someone used to expensive and tailored cuts hadn’t helped with at all.
“What?” He whispered, alarmed. He was conscious his eyes were still set on Harry, who was chatting animatedly with Theo, of all people. He was still wearing his knitted yellow hat, which was ridiculous considering they had been inside for at least half an hour. His hair were barely contained and escaped in thick curls over the bridge of his nose. Draco knew Harry struggled with his own sense of guilt but, in that moment, he looked young and completely relaxed talking with Theo. He shook away a strange pang in his chest he didn’t really want to dwell on.
Click.
“Uh? Ah, no, definitely not Scott”. Draco confirmed awkwardly.
“She can’t help it. But you look uncomfortable, and no one expects you to go for breakfast and come out with a two months contract for a summer rental you didn’t ask for. So, you know, feel free to say screw it and go your way. No hard feelings.”
Blaise expression softened and he stood, taking Theo gently by his hand and guiding him back to the bed. The boy flopped into the mattress and curled up on his side, looking at Draco but past him.  Blaise climbed on after him and sat on the pillow, from where he started to slowly stroke the other wizard’s hair.
Draco let himself cry. Cry because, somehow, he had become the boy that was capable of choosing a life over another. Crying because, despite the tears and the guilt, he knew he was still gonna do it.
“You are sick” his father said with a tremor.
Draco was speechless, wondering what pushed Potter to tell him, of all people, something like that. He always mocked the other boy for his fears, knowing deep inside it was to cover the evidence of his bravery, and surely Potter would know he would use such a confession to ridicule him. Except this time you won’t, his mind supplied, and he nodded numbly.
“I bet they won’t last” He added after a while, giving Draco’s foot a nudge.
“Yes” Draco gritted out. His flight was early the next morning and most of his day had been spent mechanically folding his new clothes by hand, in the desperate hope to keep his mind numb. As much as he had tried arguing against it, international portkeys were only released with the Ministry approval. It was a commodity they could not afford when playing “find the Potter before they find you”, so he had to swallow years of mistrust and loathing and put his life in the hands of Muggle’s dubious physic knowledge. While he had, in fact, tried listening to Lupin’s long list of reasons why airplanes were perfectly safe, actually being inside the thing was gonna be a completely different matter. Draco suspected that, even when presented with solid evidence of an airplane actually flying, part of him would always believe they had no business doing so.
When he started speaking, thought, he realised he understood now why a lot of students would seek Harry and look at him for guidance. The powerful intensity in his green eyes had people holding their breaths.
He wondered if Harry would be happy that Christmas.
He entered the Three Broomsticks and headed straight to the counter, without looking around. Madam Rosmerta was rearranging the bottles on the shelves, but stopped as he approached.
As soon as the cab left him at his destination, though, his good mood plummeted. In front of him was a shabby two storey building that didn’t even seem to warrant a name but for a broken red light languidly flashing “MTEL”.
The Gryffindor in front of him, the still lingering roundness of youth made rough by the wear of too many punishments, was far from the nervous boy Draco used to made fun of.
You are better, the words had resonated in his ears, but reality at school had turned out to be different.
“I am tired to be afraid, I want to make a difference” and with that he went back to his wounds, dismissing him.
Thanks for reading
In truth, he was as committed as Theo to get to their next class on time, so he aimed a quick vanishing charm at his friend’s breakfast. “For Merlin’s sake Blaise, cut the man a break”.
Professor Achebe was concluding her lesson, but Draco’s brain was already running trough what they had discussed during the hour.
“Let’s do it together. Not all your family is gone, Theo”. Blaise’s voice sounded strong, and Theo wiped his tears.
You’ll survive this.
Harry rubbed his nose, pushing his glasses up his forehead and sighed, casting a Sonorus. Draco could sense his unwillingness and wondered how he could had ever thought the Gryffindor was one to rejoice in the spotlight.
Draco entered the Great Hall with a sense of accomplishment and a proud stance in his stride. After a rotten summer, finally having the upper hand on Potter had lifted a little weight off his shoulders.
“Wanker”
The pond was going to be the central piece of the Gardens, around which the flower beds would develop following a circular pattern.
He felt suddenly antsy, his breathing getting shallow and constricted. The air in the dungeons was heavy, sweat and must filling his lungs like poison.
Draco could feel the room bursting with anticipation but the Dark Lord didn’t supply further explanation. He just looked at the unconscious woman  with a mix of contempt and amusement and then to the door, that opened to let two cloaked figures enter the room.
Draco and Harry together: http://fav.me/ddfki90
“What do you want me to say, Pansy? Things have happened”.
Waiting impatiently for Christmas break, I send you all our love.
He knew that mouth.
Primroses: I cant live without you
He wondered what the other students would have thought of this new Potter, the one without the name and without the fame that came with it. Evan James. Would Evan James blend in the background, had he arrived in Gryffindor as a nobody?
Maybe it would all end in disaster. Maybe he would never see Harry again, and the loss was already unbearable. Maybe he was a foolish man.
Maybe because, out of all the people that had accused the Gryffindor of being mad and a liar, the Malfoys had always known he spoke the truth. It was so Harry Potter, honesty no matter what. And maybe because, when you are desperate enough, you will believe anything you want to hear.
Anyway, I hope you liked the chapter and any thoughts are always welcome 😊
He turned over, burying his face in the pillow, but Draco kneeled in front of the bed and forced the other boy to face him.
“Mhmm” The other boy said noncommittally, a mirroring smile playing on his lips. “Anyway, we are going to have a small gathering in the Great Hall tonight. I think everyone will be there, you can tell the other Slytherins but I have a feeling they might know already. We have been given the ok to stay past curfew.” His grin was excited now.
I would appreciate if you want to let me know what you think 🙃
So Potter worked at the cafe. Draco briefly wondered if it had been the same sense of familiarity he was feeling that had first attracted Potter to this place, as well.
“I don’t know. Everything is different. Daphne is friend with Lovegood. . .I saw you, with Potter, too. You used to despise him the most”.
“Have you ever used a pensieve?” The other boy asked, clutching a small bottle filled with a silvery substance in between liquid and gas.
“Think of him. But listen, Potter, I want you to show me his memories. His pensieve memories”.
He watched impassively as the fragile glass started its descent towards the laminated floor, to then snatch it at the last second with his left hand, just barely gripping it between his fingertips and his wand. His father might have bought his team a better chance at winning, but he did not buy his spot as Slytherin’s rightful seeker, Draco thought viciously.
What was wrong with him. He played it smooth that time, but it was only a matter of time until Harry was going to notice that one Draco Malfoy was head over heels, for Harry James Potter. God it was pathetic wasn't it.
"What are you talking about"
"Draco's being a twat"
but time to update my friends :)))
"I don't care about those idiots you dickhead" She shouted which left the Twins to running to their beaten down car, knowing what their sister was like angry and it was not the nice girl everyone seemed to know.
At Half time Henry came running over to him, graciously taking the food and drink from his older brother's hands. "Brady and Chris said they would bring me to their house and the dance. Can I go? Can I go?"
Harry greeted Seamus with a smile "Hey"
The game tied 3-3 but they were still in high spirits. Henry gave his parents and brother a hug before running off with his mates. Lily and James took their car and said goodbye to Harry figuring he would off with his friends or Ginny. Harry did go over to Ginny, however it was not to ask her to the homecoming dance.
As soon as Harry was old enough to start on a rec team, they let him, outshining all of his team. At 11 they found him a private travel team, that he started along with the rec team. And of course Harry wanted to play on the middle school, team, and of course he made it, three teams seemed like a lot for one kid but Harry kept pushing through.
Song-"Youth",Daughter
"Maybe I could teach you" He sighed "But I don't know bud"
"George, he's gay, come on and you know exactly who it's for" Fred laughed "Just don't let Ginny get too restless when you tell her, be careful"
"I was catching up with an old mate" He wasn't lying, he smiled to himself thinking of the hidden meaning behind 'catching up' "Seamus Finnigan"
"Ginny"
"Why'd you invite me out" Harry asked as the finished up, pushing his plate away and throwing the used napkin on it. The diner was themed like the 50s', common for a small town joint close to where Seamus lived. He waited for the boy across from him to answer, he seemed to be thinking of some excuse instead of the obvious that he wanted to hook up with Harry.
Really like where this is going, if you have any prompts leave them on my tumblr (Goody_Malfoy) or on here. Comments and kudos appreciated.

"What are you so cheerful for"
Lily and James were the parents that always showed up dressed in the team's colors, cheering on their son, it killed James every time work kept him late. They always wanted to show up, because that's the type of people the Potters were.
~~~~~~~~
"Coming Mom"
Life was happy for everyone. Lily became a teacher after completing her 6 years of schooling to achieve her masters degree. She taught 1st grade, because she loved teaching young kids, after a couple years, she started teaching 4th grade saying they were more mature, her attitude changing towards six year olds, when you have little ones at home.
Harry walked up to his room after a post school, post practice snack. Draco wouldn't be at practice next Tuesday, he'd be there for the game, so that was a good thing. Harry was just so confused. He looked around at his room, it was pretty nice. The walls were painted a blue that resembled on of a mid-day sky, with a twin sized bed pushed up against his wall by the window, tucked away in the corner. He had a couch on the other side of the cluttered floor where, He, Ron and Hermonie would sit and do homework, when his siblings were taking up the counter tops in the kitchen. There was his closest and desk, piled high with homework. His walls had pictures of soccer players like Messi and Suraez. The team colors of his school-red and gold-stood on his walls with HAOS banners and a team jersey that read Potter on it hung on the center of the wall next to two local London bands posters.
"Confusing" The twins asked.
Once they had finished a quick dinner, they sat in the car, parked far from others, Oliver kissed him. It started slow and sweet, Harry opened his mouth and let Oliver's tongue intertwine with his own,cupping his cheek, his lips becoming swollen from the kiss. They broke free, and Harry felt kisses down the side of his neck, letting his head fall back,as Wood kissed his collarbone and came back up to look Harry in the eyes.
Lily and Petunia didn't talk much, The Dursleys came over for thanksgiving, to drop in, say 'hello', and Christmas to drop off a present, or two to Lily. Not James or the kids, they didn't like her very much. They left giving Harry, Henry and Haley, a disgusted look before Dudley could try and say hello, that stopped once he turned 7, and the same look his father and mother carried on their faces when the Potter's were around became etched upon his face as well.
Seamus picked up quick on it "Yeah" His voiced matched, stretching out the yeah just as Harry did on the so. Cheeks blushing when he smiled at him, Harry had a nice smile, one where all his teeth showed and these cute little dimples that drove the shorter boy crazy.
"Then I'll walk to my car" Nothing would be more cringe worthy thing looking back and remembering sitting in the car with someone you just snogged for ten minutes, in complete silence. What would make it worse would be someone would try and lighten the mood by playing music thus, making sure whatever songs played would the be ruined for the both of them. So instead Harry decided that rejecting the boy again would be better then ruining some good music. Good priorities right?
It's been almost two full months, i'm sorry but i'm back hopefully this schedule will get better. i update tear me apart more, so go check it out but i honestly only update it more because the chapters are shorter, but this is probably the story i'm most proud of so thank you i hope you all like this chapter !! :)
"You guys need to stop doing that"
Draco wiped the hair out of his eyes pushing it back to its usual place "H-hey"
"Bye Harry"
When he got home both his parents were asleep. Which left Harry alone once more but this time with his thoughts. Why did he care so much about Draco?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"I like you too" The older boy smiled, before flattening his mouth with what came next "But we can't date or anything, I just-"
He always told himself it was because Harry wasn't gay, he liked girls, surely if he liked boys he would like Draco. Right? But the truth he knew was he didn't even like him as a friend, sometimes not even as a person. He spent so many years pushing Harry away hoping that his secret crush would go away, not that he wasn't okay with being queer. Fuck what his dad thought. It was such a big deal, and god knows he wants him to show some sort of affection towards him but hearing his hour long rants about how gays don't deserve to live really didn't make him want to go up and hug his father.
"Boys" Molly looked at them bewildered "You were fine, until we brought up Harry. Is he alright"?
"Ummm not really to that either" He paused "You see I kind of have to brea-" He looked behind Ginny where the Twins stood listening. "Fred George would you mind to leave"
"You had us worried" Lily continued with the bad cop facade, but she was still relaxed not really mad just letting her eldest son know they really were concerned. "What kept you so long. You missed dinner"
Harry sat uncomfortably in the car, before Oliver spoke again. "I'll bring you home"
~~~~~~~~~~
"Nah. it didn't" He laughed "So Haley has a boyfriend named Chase huh"?
"'Ginny don't'" She mocked "Your love is like ice, you heart too. Like stone. I don't want everyone to think I was dumped for whatever bullshit reason the golden boy comes up with alright. So sorry but this is the way life works people were gonna find out sooner or later. Why not now"?
"Really"
~~~~~~~~~
They were all sitting out on the field by the bench, tying cleats and rolling up socks before they would begin. The usual chatter of what teacher gave what homework,the stupid vice principal Umbridge, giving another detention out to someone, what girl Flint went out with last. Harry smiled looking around to his teammates all sitting different levels of ready talking to each other, everything seemed fine. He was the last one sitting on the grass tying his last cleat when the twins walked over.
Getting through the day was pretty easy considering Harry complained of a headache and slept through his Algebra quiz, and health class. Going to his brother's game was a relief and before driving across the street to the middle school, Harry drove to the gas station for an energy drink and doughnut. He bought a Gatorade and candy bar for both Henry and Haley, then made his way to the green as the game was just starting. His parents were there and a couple kids from his team as well. Haley had a longer practice going on then went into watch her friend's volleyball game. His stomach lept when he saw Ginny across the field and wave to him. He was going to have to do something about this problem. He didn't want to call her that but it was a problem. A pretty big problem.
~~~~~~~~~
"Yes"?
~~~~~~~~
Once, Fred,George,Ron, and Ginny were seated they started eating, Arthur came in once everyone had their plate and taken their first bite. Not too late was he, but also not on time.
#9 Micheal McManus-Left Defense
"Yep" Lily muttered "My kids are growing up and Henry you're asking out a girl named Emily"
Hey, Thanks for reading guys :)
"You're not cheating on me are you" She went wide eyed. Harry shook his head "Well alright. Tell me we can get through this".
Seamus had a small boxy car, he was leaned up against the drivers door scrolling through his phone. School had let out about five minutes earlier and he awaited the taller boys arrival. He let out a light smile when he saw Harry come over, sliding his phone into his back pocket.
"Whatever, I won't be at practice, next Tuesday-"
"Wow"
The school was in full blown riot when they found THE Harry Potter was gay. The news was spread by Friday night just hours after Ginny Weasley and him had broken up. The twins were each slapped twice when Ginny found out that they had known her boyfriend was gay and didn't tell her. Ron was shocked and Hermonie said she was a little suprised but Harry was unpredictable but not really consider his unpredictability was so predictable.
"YES" They both shouted "That too" They nodded
Thank you guys!!! LOVE YOu so much!!!!
"Hi Henry" He smiled at his little brother
"Hey Fred Let's pass around the soccer ball, or go for a run"
"Took awhile" His mother sipped the glass of wine from beside her "Did you eat"
"I just need to explain-"
"I have game tomorrow are you coming"
"Mom does" She smiled and her and Henry followed him to the kitchen and the three of them sat at the bar stools at the kitchen counter. They all had a granola bar and a Gatorade.
The halls were buzzing with the usual commotion one would expect in an adolescent filled high school, laughter, talking, perhaps crying? The usual things going on in the utter horror that was high school. Harry stuffed a book or two in his locker-things he didn't need that day-and slung his backpack over his shoulder, carrying it to his first class. Oliver stood talking to the Weasley twins, not an unusual sight, the three were quite close. However Harry couldn't meet any of the six eyes that followed him when he passed their area. Was he ashamed for kissing a boy. No not at all. He was embarrassed for walking out, you could say that, kissing was good, but it didn't keep Draco out of his mind, fucking git.
#16 Adrian Pucey-Center Mid
"You'll get there I'm sure" Draco laughed. Who's brother was this?
James saw her the first day and took a liking to her, pointing her out, to his friends, Remus, Peter, and his best friend Sirius. Sirius was still close to the family to this day, he was Harry's Godfather, Haley's Godfather was Peter, and Henry's was Remus.
~~~~~~~~
Word travels fast in high-school. You saw it when the news of Potter being gay came to rise in Hogwart's Halls. So the news Oliver Wood snogging Harry Potter also traveled around the school like nobody's business.
"Well kids" Molly spoke looking around the table "How was school, any plans, games"
"Well Harry, I knew because I was just so incredibly dashing and handsome I couldn't limit myself to only one sex" Fred smiled
"I figured" Harry scoffed.
"Good" His voice was deep with confidence and that's when he started to thrust harder and deeper, he was balls deep in this boy's ass and it was the best feeling he could've ever imagined. Seamus continued to jerk himself off fast matching the pace of each thrust. He was pounding into him now it was orgasmic, he wasn't going to last much longer. He kept going though and what sent him over the edge is when Seamus pushed Harry off of him and got back onto his lap. This time he was the one lining his ass onto the large cock and sitting all the way down, easy as he was already open wide for Harry.
But would there ever be a right time?
Harry finished packing his things form practice up, and was ready to get in his car and head home, when Oliver Wood came up to him.
"I need to ask you something. Kind of serious" He paused and the twins stopped nudging each other in their little playful manner. "How'd you know you were....you....know......gay"
Harry groaned at the sound of his alarm blaring on the bedside table. Why did school have to start so early? Tomorrow was game day so that was something to look forward to. His room was a mess clothes were strewn across the floor, dozens of water bottles and wrappers to energy bars, he'd clean it this weekend, the slump he was in needed to end, it was so annoying why did he have to tell Ginny, he regretted that but he didn't regret Seamus making him cum harder than he ever had in his entire life. He was so happy less than a week ago, ready for anything life sent his way-except this.
"At 4"? She asked.
~~~~~~~~~
Oliver laughed "Yeah"
"Shut up-"
"DAD" Henry yelled "HALEY'S GOING OUT WITH A BOY NAMED CHASE"
"Yep, and luckily Fred was feeling the same way when I asked him about it." George laughed "About the same person for godsake too"
"Yeah" Fred agreed "We didn't decide, but it also didn't just happen over night you know? It took awhile, but I guess I was BI" He emphasized the word bi "for pretty decent amount of time until I just was looking ol' Ollie over there, and kind of went 'shit I'm a poof man'"
"-Boys! Stop this nonsense" Their coach ran over shouting "Stop arguing"
The ongoing chorus of words going through his head, it's all Harry could think about. It seemed to be the Harry was living this double life where by day he was calm,cool, and collected, but by night, well, he was this new person all together, this person, who couldn't shake this boy out of his head, this horrible, mean, nasty,beautiful boy. Fuck. Draco fucking Malfoy, why couldn't he get him out of his head, this had happened before. It was like Harry was telling everyone-including himself-about how terrible, Draco was, but deep down he wanted to be with him all the day. He was telling himself that he didn't care about him, but just last night at practice, Draco had fallen forward onto his knee. Harry rushed over to check and see if he was okay, but was greeted with a mislay 'What do you care Potter' . Which shouldn't bother him, all he had been to Draco these past three years was Potter. But somehow Harry caught feeli-no he hadn't. There was no way in hell that Harry Potter was a poof, he had a girlfriend. Ginny. Now there was a big problem, a big piece of trouble slipping into the cracks, into Harry's life.
#8 Oliver Wood-Goalie/keeper
"No no" he panicked what was he going to say. God dammit "You're beautiful it's just" 3.....2....1 "I'm gay-fuck"
"HI HARRY" Henry came running to the door, his shirt was muddy so he must of just came from soccer as well. Henry played defense, once he got onto the A team instead of the B he would probably start playing the same position as Draco, a sweeper.
Lily sighed "Of course he is" she said laughing.
Draco threw his phone across the room. Deep down he knew he would never actually have sex with Harry Potter, but it was fun to imagine, especially when he found out the star player wasn't straight. Those three days were magical thinking of him kissing his neck, leaving a trail of bruises down his pale skin to his collarbone. He just wanted to be all his, and he never would be.
"I'll take you"
"So good Harry" He pushed himself-as much as he could in the small space-onto the boy trying to get him all the way inside.
"Love you" They said together and resumed their tasks as if nothing happened, a little more smoothly though as their house was full and they thought happy. They cared they really did, but you couldn't be on top of your kids 24/7, they were caring parents not helicopter ones.
So Draco did what he did best. He hid away in his room pretending he didn't know anyone but himself existed and talk three showers a day where all he did was sit with his legs to his pale chest the water hitting his back as he stared at the white wall. The soft piano in the background.
"Not really" He rubbed his forearm
The window was down and the wind hit his face, it felt refreshing with one arm out the window feeling calm as he drove alone. There had to be a reason why he still had an empty feeling at the bottom of his stomach, why was he still so confused if he thought everything was figuring itself out.
"I remember him" Lily nodded

#6 Ron Weasley-Stopper
"Thank you Harry" He smiled "I might ask this girl named Emily, she's on the volleyball team"
Harry completely bombed the game, he scored once, the only shot that was on target. Diggory, Flint and Pucey carried the goals. They still won, thanks to the back lines defense and the center mids. As much as Draco was in love with boy he really wanted to tear his head off his neck. Winning was everything and he was completely sabotaging the teams chances at championships if he kept this up, they would start losing games.
"Well a little birdy told us that you rocked Seamus Finnigans world last night" Fred chuckled
"Harry" He answered with that thick Irish-Wales accent.
Also if you have any prompts you want me to write just leave it as a comment, and i'll respond and get to it. Thank you once again.
Lily jumped up and ran to the field, and James picked her up laughing and hugging her, before, kissing her right there in the middle of the field, in front of half the staff.
Pulling into the driveway he examined his house, before going in. It was nice, fairly big to fit the large family 4 bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths-that was always nice in the mornings-his house was a soft olive green color, Lily spent hours on the weekend,between lesson plans and grading papers, gardening out front, trimming hedges along the front, replanting flowers along the walk way-which was barely even used, people opting for the garage door instead-letting the house be presentable. They had a deck out back and a pool. They had money from Jame's family, but they made most of it on their own. They were middle class and it suited them well, never flaunting any money that came their way, always paying the bills even if there was a struggle at times, but they were happy, and for James and Lily if their spouse and kids were happy that's all that mattered.
"What's wrong with you" He smirked shaking his head, walking away while slinging his back over his right shoulder, carrying his soccer bag in his hand.
"Me too" He was used to his post practice snack, which today was canceled. His coach kept canceling, which would normally be nice, but whenever practice was canceled now he kept getting himself into these little predicaments.
So Dr. Severus Snape is inspired by a bitchy Science teacher
"Just had practice too" Ron Said
"We have a game next Wednesday" Ron said through a mouthful of chicken, which Molly just shook her head to sighing.
"Hiya Harry" He jumped at their voices which got a laugh from them. Did they ever just walk up to someone or did they always have to scare you. The twins were talking to him more than Ron was these days.
#10 Fred Weasley-Right Mid
So Draco took his car, and pulled out of the parking lot, he had to get home so he could study and do his homework, then probably lock himself in his room. Shutting out the insufferable bickering his parents were yet again bound to be doing once Draco managed to get home if this traffic would fucking hurry the fuck up. Lucius was probably whining about how his paperwork was screwed up, or 'how was he supposed to get elected next term, if Narcissa didn't do her part and make him look good, instead of a goddamn fool'. There was always some problem with Draco's parents.
Imagine not posting for almost two years, couldn't be me!
"No I'll walk to my car"
Coach made it increasingly difficult to make Boys Varsity, no doubt only a mere 16 boys made it onto varsity, even getting onto JV was pretty hard 20 were on the team, 36 out of the 73 boys that tried out made onto a team. Which was why it was most impressive when Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy made it onto the school's Varsity team. But it wasn't that surprising they both breathed ate and drank soccer, they practically were the sport.
But maybe you're forgetting that Draco was practicality head over heels in love with Harry James Potter.
Henry looked up smiling at the him "Do you think maybe you could teach me? Or maybe you could come over my house and teach me. Wait that's weird. I don't know I just really want to play like you."
Harry was skeptical about going to them about this, he didn't want anyone to know, especially Ron or Ginny, and he was going to their older siblings for advice. Stupid.
"DINNER WEASLEYS" Molly shouted at the bottom of the steps, before making her way back into the kitchen to start serving up plates, for her children.
Harry thought about what was awaiting him all mornng
~~~~~~~~~
"Excuse me"
"Whatcha staring at their huh Harry"? The twins appeared from behind the bench laughing when they saw Harry jump.
The person who holds the prestige title of "First guy to fuck Harry Potter" is one Seamus Finnigan, and he's quite proud of that thank you. Seamus wasn't a soccer nut like Harry and Draco, but he wasn't one that despised the sport either. He was one of the boys who would pass the ball around but not commit to the sport. So how exactly did he wind up riding Harry Potter senseless? It happened the morning after Potter and Wood's "little kiss".
~~~~~~~~~~
"Hi Harry"! Lily smiled "Something wrong"
"It's alright" He smiled weakly "I understand"
Lily needed to know what was going on. But how would she find out.
Harry smirked as well and spoke up "So you don't need a ride then"?
"Ronald" Molly said sternly even though she didn't have much tolerance for the boy either.
They eloped when they, turned 23, and had Harry shortly after, right before Lily turned 24.
This was so foreign to him, not the kissing, kissing boys was similar to kissing girls it was rougher though. He was surprised he won, did this mean he would be on top? How did it work? What did he need to do? His thoughts were interrupted by his own moan when Seamus ground down on his lap, Harry grabbed his thighs and pushed him down for more friction, he wanted more, his hands ran up the boys shirt, and he hastily unbuttoned it, trying not to ruin it, but he needed this. Seamus followed the other boy's lead and helped his own shirt off, his breathing getting heavier as he climbed off and Harry's shirt was removed as well. It was only a minute later they were both completely naked. The shorter  boy took Harry's semi hard dick into his hands and started to pump, the later threw his head back and his eyes closed as the boy continued to give him a handjob. He took him into his mouth and continued to rub the shaft as he swirled his tongue around the head, licking at the sensitive opening, it drove the other boy crazy. He resisted the urge to push his head down, Harry was bigger than most, Ginny had a hard time to take him all in her mouth, it was always upsetting, he wanted to be deepthroated so bad, and he got that. Seamus went all the way and Harry could've cum right there, especially when his hands went down to cup his balls pulling ever so lightly. He was enjoying the show below him it was so entertaining just to watch the boy take his entire cock into his mouth, spit running down it and out the sides off his mouth as he came up for air and smiled.
James laughed "Gentleman. Since when is our son ever a gentleman."
"I don't care about your routine. HARRY POTTER'S GAY DRACO! BLOODY GAY" He laughed "Can you  believe it. Draco. Draco??"
Harry didn't tell his family what was happening and stayed in his room drinking his dad's rum up. He didn't need to check his phone to know by all the phone buzzing he was getting that his secret was out. It sucked but Ginny was right-what no she wasn't. Why not now? Umm how about the fact that Harry had figured out just days before that who he was. But now the entire Sophomore, Junior and Senior class knew he liked Dick. So what. Fuck 'em.
"Hi Harry" She titled her head to the read questionably "Everything alright"?
"Nope" He replied to the question again "Only girls"
"Bye Harry" George said "Fred"
Lily smiled "Well Henry have fun and you better get back to the game" She paused then added "And treat Emily like the gentleman you are"
"I never said you were" She smiled brightly "Now give me your stuff I'll bring it home, you take your car and go celebrate with the Weasley's, and I'm sure you want to see the end of Ginny's game right"? She winked.
Draco approached his car, taking his time as he walked at a leisurely pace. The game had been okay, but it's hard to concentrate while running backwards, when the star striker's ass is right there. I mean come on, have you ever tried running backwards? On its own it's pretty difficult to look out for other players, and the goal post if you go too far. Now try running attempting to concentrate on not colliding with fellow team members, and your opponents, as a perfect ass, and human is in front of you. But Draco couldn't date Potter. Why?
Draco made his way across the field trying to keep his face from blushing further, and trying to keep himself from looking back at Harry. He made it to his car far enough Harry couldn't make out Draco's face but close, enough Draco could look at Harry and look at him, rest his head back and lay his back against the bench. There they were both sitting there looking at eachother, but not realizing the other was looking at him.
They made it to a Pizzahut, and met Fred George and Ron inside, where they got two large pizzas, and talked about their games, and of course Harry brought up what a little git Draco was. Ron talked about Oliver's save, in the first half and how next year he wanted to go out for keeper.
The walls of the “MTEL” were a sandy brown, paint flaking in more places than not and rude words scribbled everywhere. Two dead potted plants were carelessly positioned at either side of the entrance, like a mocking welcome sign to hell. Hoping that the place wasn’t representative of the local fashion, Draco dragged his luggage behind him and entered the building.
Everything was so clear and sharp that he had to ponder if he had actually ever looked at a place so well to impress all of its tiny details in his mind, like Dumbledore seemed to have done with the office.  Maybe it was something the human brain always did, take photographs and then store them so deep into its recesses that it was impossible to remember them without the aid of magic. It was a weird concept, of remembering without noticing, but one that Draco had considered before during his idealistic dreams of becoming a mind healer. Dreams that had been trampled down a long time before.
Dumbledore's voice wavered “You cannot possibly mean. . . No, it’s impossible, I would have known. You are a child, Draco.” The last sentence sounded like “monster” to Draco’s ears.
The slanted curve of Blaise’s eyes, fixed on his face with that knowing look that curled Draco’s fingers into fists. He wanted to pound at the soft flesh of Blaise’s high cheekbones until smooth velvet turned purple with abuse, demanding who had appointed him to the Supreme Court of the High and Mighty.
He changed out of his sweaty clothes and took a short and uncomfortable shower, trying to keep his naked skin away from touching the tiles. It was a rather difficult task, seeing how the entire fucking cubicle was only about 3 feet wide.
He dropped to his knees, gently supporting the lean body in his arms and just let himself look.
Draco pursed his lips, deciding it wasn’t worth an answer, and reached for the pumpkin juice. Theo, though, was a nagging little shit.
“My second big mistake was to believe I only needed myself. That I knew better than anyone else. During the war, there were moments in which I was terrified —“ He shook his head. “Even admitting this is a sign of how much I have changed. But, yeah, I was fucking scared” He looked at McGonagall apologetically, but she nodded for him to go on “I know it was a shared sentiment and many of you probably think that I put myself into that situation in the first place. . . Which I did. But once I realised it wasn’t all what I imagined, I was so scared. Still, I didn’t reach out. I didn’t seek help. Honestly, the only thing that kept me going was knowing that someone was afraid, too. Even if I was never too fond of that person —“ He heard Harry huffing behind him “it made me feel less alone”.
When you control, though, or modify the mind, it’s only the victim of the spell that will have to face the actions their body performed without their consent. Something done by them but not wanted. And yet, they couldn’t stop it from happening. Professor Achebe had told them that often those victims, although knowing they were indeed the injured parties, couldn’t help blaming themselves, especially if they were made to do something terrible. It was a different kind of torture, long lasting.
Draco’s mouth was uncomfortably dry in the heat of the day; despite the soothing breeze coming from the open windows, he was still overdressed. He was about to ask for a glass of water, or to demand to know what the hell was Potter doing with all those boxes, when the other boy suddenly hummed in triumph, emerging from the cabinet, one of said boxes in his grasp.
Not that it was hard to, his distracted wandering the only thing that had allowed him to overlook the quirky cafe before. It stood at the corner of an intersection, dwarfed by the sleek and modern buildings surrounding it. It was oddly familiar, like it could have belonged among the outdated architecture of Diagon Alley, with its wooden frame painted sage green and two handfuls of bright windsor style chairs dotting the pavement in front of the entrance. The mustard sign above his head read “The Mad Hatter” and each one of the little tables outside held a dainty teapot bursting with flowers as a centerpiece.
He wasn’t even sure Daphne was still listening but, when he glanced at her, her eyes were shimmering.
When they reached the top of the staircase in silence, Draco’s breath was ragged. He wasn’t sure it was the steps or his fear of breaking down. He turned around, unable to go further.
“I am here” he said, gesturing in the direction of the flower. “You can talk to me, Theo”.
Draco thought of his own childhood, always pampered and spoilt. It was clear than Snape did not receive such attentions, as the child looked neglected and ignored, but when he spoke of the Wizarding World he had the same confidence of Draco. He was obviously proud of being a wizard. The fact that he only had eyes for Lily while the other girl, who appeared quite ordinary, was ignored was a further statement of his preferences. Draco had found out that both Snape and Voldemort had Muggle fathers and both had been resolved to distance themselves from that world.
I know in the book Draco calls Crabbe and Goyle by surname but I thought that was a bit too impersonal for someone going trough the mental changes I am making him have.
There weren’t many people on the roads, and none paid him any attention. It wasn’t like Draco expected Potter to bump into him in the middle of Chestnut Avenue, so he just kept walking until his shirt was plastered against his warming skin and he was suddenly very thirsty.
“Although mine is slightly less pretentious” his grin was getting bigger and Draco felt one of his own tugging at the corners of his lips.
When they reached their destination Daphne let out a surprised “Ohhh. . .”
Flares of a long tamed jealousy prickled under his skin, feeding his anger like gasoline. He wanted to destroy. He wanted to break this man that loved Potter so much it was revolting.
“Oh” Lupin said with a strange mix between a grimace and dread “Let’s go shopping”.
“Yeah, I think I understand” Draco agreed. It made sense, after everything “Do you know what you are going to do?”
It had passed in a whirlwind of emotions and words that made the contrast with the silence in the cab even the more poignant.
And, despite none of them had exchanged more than a few words with the Ravenclaw and knew virtually nothing about him, Draco found himself smiling.
“What’s gotten into you?” He hissed in Theo’s ear.
“You have a point” the other boy laughed, like if it made sense. “Anyway, I think we shared. . . What did you call it? My strange fascination with red heads”.

“I find it rather impossible to sleep with a effing hippogryph wreaking my room!” Blaise yelled.
“What the fuck?” Draco glared in the direction of the blur, that now that his vision was settling had started to take the shape of a fluffy ginger cat.
No, he wanted to lie.
“I know you think I am the hero of this war—“ The boy said, clearing his throat “And I will not start speaking about merits of demerits. But if there is something this war has taught me, is that we are all humans. All of us, even Voldemort.” Some of the audience still shuddered at the name. “It was his error, to think he was invincible, and at the end he died just like everyone else. Nothing spectacular, nothing great. I am just Harry, I might have done something big but it was a mix of circumstances and a lot of help from the people that care about me.”
“I’ve never been in one.” Draco deadpanned. “Car, I mean.” He clarified, after a beat.
Draco nodded again in acknowledgment and watched quietly as the other wizard fumbled around the pockets of his worn cardigan for his wand. He had seen his father organising his own thoughts in the Manor’s pensieve enough times for the process not to be entirely foreign, but it was still fascinating to witness.
His eyes were caught by the presence of a second broom next to the Headmaster, and his heart gave a panicked thud. “Who else is here?” He asked. Dumbledore twisted his question and he felt himself answering, trying to put an inflection of proudness into his voice at the scheme he concocted.
“You have poor impulse control”
Somehow, it was more comforting than any words could have been.
Lupin looked both stunned and pained “I know”.
“I love her” Theo whispered, elbowing him in the ribs, and Draco, who was thinking that not long ago he was like Smith, couldn’t do anything but agree.
“Just slightly dehydrated, really.” He mumbled under her skeptical scrutiny.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who, Ron? Nah, we are just really good friends”. For a moment, Draco blanched. The other boy looked a bit thoughtful, as if surprised of his own joke. And suddenly, the mood significantly lightened.
“You have changed, Draco. Very well, you might proceed” he sighed in the direction of the Gryffindor, like if he wanted to say more, but only resolved by looking torn and a bit regretful. It was a look that Draco had never seen on the Professor’s face and he pondered about how much of Snape he had actually gotten to know when he was alive.
Theo and Blaise were the last to arrive and joined the group on the evening of Saturday. Blaise regarded the other pupils with his usual aloofness, receiving a few huffs and eye rolls. He had never cared much about making a good impression, even when with other Slytherins. Theo, on the other hand, was really jittery.
“Me? No. But maybe there is a way”. Draco had an idea, as crazy as it was.
“You are a wizard, you’ll figure it out” Lupin chuckled before sobering up so suddenly that Draco had to wonder if he was actually seeing things. “Open it, please. On the first page.”
“I’ll have you know that I could be lots of fun if I wanted” he replied, trowing a squashed raspberry at Draco’s head and missing by a foot.
Therefore, when he stumbled across an invisible barrier, right in the middle of the worn out floor of Compartment I, it was just too much.
She had told him not to discredit the importance of painful experiences, for it was the bumps in the road that made the journey memorable.
“Okay” he nodded. They talked until the sun was up.
The Gryffindor shook his head in amusement.
The woman in front of him was no longer unconscious and was now grunting in evident struggle against her invisible bonds.
As a little boy, his mother used to tell him that life was like a waterfall trying to fit inside a glass. At some point, the overflow was inevitable.
“I can’t. And they are gone now, you have been here for almost two days, Draco”.
He gestured for him to keep his place ahead in line, quickly shutting his expression off when it looked like the other boy wanted to engage in conversation. The Muggle seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, mouth opening and closing a few times. Draco stared back, trying to convey as much hostility as possible, until it became uncomfortable and the boy turned around, eventually lost in the moving queue.
And Draco was surviving, but every day he asked himself more and more if it was enough.
But the chapter came quickly, so that’s a plus, right? Right. So no hate for the author!
He found Theo on the left one, twirling a red Chrysanthemum in between his fingers while he stared at a point far away. It was drizzling lightly and his hair was plastered to his forehead, his eyes squinted.
“Malfoy. . . Hey” he said, awkwardly, once he noticed the intruder.
As if able to follow his line of musing, the gaze of the Dark Lord fell upon his father and he requested Lucius to submit his wand.
Yes, Draco was definitely grateful for his friends.
“They sense danger” a soft voice said from somewhere behind him.
“I don’t believe I’ve thanked you, Draco” she added, turning to him.
“Good evening, Draco” Dumbledore’s voice was gentle, shooting. No, no, no Draco screamed in his head. Please, don’t be kind, I have to do this, make it easy, please.
As usual, let me know if you spot any mistakes or things that don’t make much sense. I think as an illustrator im quite visual in my writing as in i write things like they were an image, so I am not sure it always works. I really want to do some artwork on this as well so maybe one day
He had always believed that his last day would taste like longing and regret, but all he could feel on the tip of his tongue was a tender ache and burnt coffee. As if the elves knew it would be his last and messed it up, just this once.
He sank deeper into the velvety armchair at the far right corner of the Slytherin common room, away from the crowd of students most likely speculating about Potter. For some reason, this particular armchair had ended up in front of a window, which meant an unappealing view of the murky lake water. Draco watched as some bubbles raised from the bottom, popping mid way and releasing a green substance vaguely similar to bobotuber pus. He wrinkled his nose, focusing on the repetitive motion of the bubbles and willing his mind to clear and relax.
“Why do you care?” The other boy challenged.
“You look a bit young for coffee.” She commented, before placing a tall mug next to the plate anyway. It was followed by a glass of orange juice and a little bowl of fruit salad.
“I made a few copies of that. I can talk to the embassy, find out the quickest  way about getting a visa.”
“Allie would call it a manifestation of your lack of sense of self worth.”
Also, I don’t think surrogacy has ever been considered as an option for them having kids, has it?
For what he could make out Lupin was blathering about dolphins and Draco pinched himself.
The journey wasn’t long and the driver blessedly quiet. It was too dark outside to really make out much of the passing landscape, so Draco relaxed against the leather seats. Given time, he could learn to enjoy travelling by car, he thought. It was almost peaceful.
Potter was in the castle. Draco had known it already, from the Mark, but it had been surreal to actually see him there, still there even when the Dark Lord demanded for his life and his life only. Potter could have fucked off to some desert island or far away land and declared to hell with all that shit. Honestly, some people would have done it. Most, probably.
“The only apologies you should make are to your Ravenclaw for that atrocious hat you are wearing” he drawled, peering at the offending accessory as if it was personal.
“You’re a real fairy, Nott. You comin’, Draco?” Greg called, a stupid grin on his face.
“The fuck you are! Take me back!” His hawthorn wand glowed, sending little sparks that caught on the other man’s jumper like cigarette burns.
This is a link as I can’t upload it
Granger stared at him with a mix of fascinated incredulity and disgust that kept him going. “He was really ashamed, you know with me being this evil overlord and everything his poor Gryffindork heart stood against. He is probably giving birth in a ditch.”
He waved Lupin off and stared blankly at the kitchen ceiling. “Dandy”, he heard his own voice croaking in the distance. “Just fucking great”.
That was it. The end. A terrible scream ripped the air, but the voice was different, male. Weasley and Potter, having somehow escaped Wormtail, barged into the room.
To his surprise, Lupin tilted his head, assessing him curiously “You are quite mouthy for being Lucius Malfoy’s son”.
He had, despite himself, been impressed by the animation, as Potter had called it. Moving images was a fourth year charm, and not an extremely easy one at that, so achieving it without the help of magic was something even he couldn’t discount.
“Don’t mind him. He was dropped on the head one too many times and he is now afflicted by. . .Idiocy” Potter shrugged, not really answering the question. He still looked guarded, and Draco felt the need to rectify that.
He uncorked the vial and let about one third of the potion fall onto his tongue, surprised at finding it completely tasteless. For whatever reason he had expected sweetness. As soon as the liquid had reached the back of his throat he felt pervaded by a strong sense of purpose and the compelling need to go for a walk.
Also, Theo is probably my favourite character to write. He doesn’t say much but I feel connected to all he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had just finished brushing his teeth when Lupin’s reply came with a faint light.
No, no, no you can’t.
If he survived, tomorrow nothing would be the same. And, the cowardly part of Draco that was the last standing piece of his old self, was planning to survive with his teeth and nails, Salazar be damned.
(See the end of the chapter for
That brief moment of happiness was gone, pushed away by shame and guilt.
Harry looked calmly happy, in a way he hadn’t since before that blasted tournament in fourth year.
“Er -“ Draco briefly considered lying, but Potter was smirking. “I am sure it was all perfectly fascinating” he drawled instead.
He tugged at the green t-shirt that was still uncomfortably plastered against his skin.
The next line held a completely different tone. “How are you feeling?” Lupin asked, simply.
“And why not?”
So he turned to Pansy “It’s ok, because I was like that, and now I’ve changed. Maybe some day they will find their reason to change to”. And if they don’t it’s their loss, because the world with this new eyes looked brighter and a bit more colourful.
He reached out, as he had done many times in the past, a long gone past. The other boy’s eyes widened and he moved slightly backward.
“Blaise!” Draco warned.
He had faced up to the first five steps when he felt Blaise presence sliding beside him.
Even with Christmas widely being the most popular of the holidays, Draco had always favourited Easter. Being used to have the best of everything with just a whim made the exchange of presents less exciting, and summer was too long and tedious. He found that Easter gave him a balanced respite from the busy schedule of the approaching exams, when life at Hogwarts was getting demanding and chaotic. When younger his parents, normally focused on his school career, would often take him somewhere nice for a few days, where they would just spend time being a family, mentions of school and achievements forgotten. In his constant pursue to come out on top, besting the other students to satisfy his father’s desires and his own ambitions, this time was a much needed break to just let himself be young and relaxed. On top of that, the Manor in spring was simply a sight to behold. The white stoney walls of his home looked regal and neat, a beautiful contrast to the gardens, that were coloured by an impressive array of blooming plants. The gravel path, that led visitors from the intricate iron gate to the imposing entrance door of the Manor, was edged on both sides by symmetrical French gardens, developing around two beautiful central fountains, frequent attractions for chirping birds, looking for refreshment and a place to play. But Draco’s pride had always been the area stretching to the left of the Manor, where all pretentiousness was abandoned in favour of a more natural landscape. Here, lost in the middle of groves of trees, were a lovely little pond and, just before the land touched the orchard, the raspberries bushes where Draco had found his secret corner of normalcy the summer before.
I am so sorry this is not really up to standard at the moment but I have so little time for writing. The story is all there in my head tho so I am not giving it up, maybe one day I will fix the chapters that I’m not satisfied with🙂
“Good. Now repeat that part about not being his keeper. . . Slowly, as if you believe it”.
From the mirror expressions of bafflement on both Potter and the Muggle’s faces, Draco hadn’t quite managed to convey the “here, take my money” vibe he was going for.
After agreeing to have the new contract ready to sign by the next morning, she was just reminding them to bring a copy of Draco’s documents with them when he had thought it appropriate to dig out his wallet and hand over his bank card-thing.
Draco watched the fire die.
“So you assumed we want to create our little corner with green roses and snakes?”
The Weasel’s nostrils flared threateningly. Draco shrugged, “He wasn’t even a good lay.”
Potter. Harry. Who until now had kept his eyes trained on his mother, diverted his gaze. Draco, that had found himself often more interested in watching the other boy than the memories, looked again at the way Snape’s regret had changed him and, consequently, the fate of the war. A man, fighting constantly with his own childhood beliefs and experiences, that told him to hate James Potter’s son while the boy looked at him with Lily’s eyes. As Dumbledore accused him to only see what he expected to see, Draco knew he too had been guilty of making the same mistake. He listened while the two wizards discussed the punishment Lord Voldemort had set upon his family and how the man he had been supposed to kill had ultimately saved his life. And then he watched, horrified, as the same man confessed Harry Potter had to die.
