Harry must have fallen asleep for a bit, because when he opens his eyes, the fire is burning brighter again, and Malfoy isn’t with him. He looks around and finds the other man already dressed again, staring into the fireplace.
The reunion is Hermione’s idea, of course. She goes on for half a year about how it would be a peacebuilding exercise, and Harry doesn’t think anything of it, until one day he receives a “save the date” owl asking him to confirm his attendance.
At this point Malfoy’s grin returns, wider than ever, that arrogant, teasing, insolent grin he’s always had, that still twists Harry’s stomach with rage and something else too.
But Malfoy comes up to him and offers to get his next drink, and then they sit together in silence for a bit. Harry feels like he could drop dead from embarrassment, but he also really likes sitting here like this, Malfoy drinking his whiskey next to him. Like they’ve got something between them. It’s the most they’ve ever had, he realizes, the longest they’ve ever gone without being mean to or outright hexing each other, and he dreads never having it again. The other dreams come to mind, the ones in which they have never been enemies, in which they are easy old friends who hit each other up to go dancing or whatever. He wonders what Malfoy would have to say about those.
Eventually Malfoy just runs a hand through his hair, downs the small rest in his glass, and says completely evenly, “Do you want to fuck?”
The knowledge that this is Malfoy is pounding in his head the entire time, and yet when he eventually pulls back and opens his eyes it feels like the sight of Malfoy’s actual face physically slams into him. This is really, actually, the man from his dreams; the boy from school; the adolescent who threatened him in the Room of Requirement. This is a face he has hated, but a face that has haunted him. And he still doesn’t understand. He feels like he might be sick but then again he might come in his jeans instead.
At least Hermione suddenly looks very uncertain. “Yes, I – you’re right, Harry,” She stammers. “Sorry, I just – Sorry.” Meanwhile Ron is staring with his mouth agape like Harry has sprouted leaves.
Before long, the stories shared start to turn to the embarrassing kind. Because of course they do; it wouldn’t be a proper reunion without those. They talk about who fancied who, who was caught kissing where on the school grounds; they tease each other and gossip about others. Malfoy is mostly silent, with the exception of a joke here and there, but his face is alive, all in on the gossip.
Every single person in the circle gasps again, this time including Malfoy. His eyes widen in shock, his mouth opens just a little.
The flames dance on. Harry doesn’t know how to hold all this. He doesn’t have a magical cure to offer that will absolve Draco of his guilt. But he feels with him.
But Harry still can’t wait to meet him again. They actually haven’t met in years. Well, they have been in Diagon Alley simultaneously, of course, but they’ve always sort of passed each other in the crowd and pretended not to notice. That’s what Harry has done, anyway. He doesn’t know if Malfoy really just didn’t see him. Ever. Even though Harry notices his blonde head out of the corner of his eye the minute he comes walking down the street.
Malfoy is still too wealthy to work for money, but he’s been giving to wizarding charities – museums, libraries, to Hogwarts itself. Harry knows that, it’s been in the papers. Malfoy has neither wife nor children. Harry did not know that, but he has suspected that he would have heard about a marriage. Malfoy has a cat, a white one with one black ear and the other half chewed off. Malfoy went on holiday to Norway. Malfoy is, more or less, a normal person, it seems, and he is remarkably good at pretending that this is just like any other reunion.
Malfoy’s wand lurches out of its master’s hands, flies in a less than graceful arc at Harry, and hits him in the shoulder before he can catch it. Absurdly, he finds time to feel embarrassed about his uncharacteristically clumsy spellwork, before processing the shocked expression on Malfoy’s face. The blond actually has his hands raised in defense.
Malfoy doesn’t reply. Instead he slips a hand in his robes and pulls out an object that most closely resembles a shiny black sock.
Still hazy, he reaches down to take himself in hand, but Malfoy notices and grips his hand in a steel grasp.
Malfoy isn’t a good person. War and reconciliation and politics aside, this is personal: Malfoy has personally done Harry wrong too many times to count. Sure, there were many other moments in their shared history that weren’t exactly outright hostile – shared potions classes, quidditch matches, feasts. Sometimes they passed in the hallways and, like, didn’t sneer at each other. But that was about as far as it went. Malfoy has certainly never given Harry any reason to dream about befriending him. Or shagging him. Definitely not that, even if he’s always looked … well, it doesn’t matter how he looked. He’s Malfoy.
“No,” Harry breathes when he realizes the other is waiting for a reply. He is breathless, and pulling on Malfoy’s hips to egg him on. But Malfoy stays still, considers him quietly for a moment. Then he asks, “Do you enjoy not being what everyone expects of you?”
But before he has fully opened the door, Malfoy is behind him, all of a sudden so very close that Harry feels his presence from head to toe. Taken aback, he freezes, and Malfoy takes advantage of this to put his hand over Harry’s on the handle and gently close the door again.
‘Harry wait, what are you doing here... I thought we were meeting later’ he asked quickly, the blood still dripping down his chin.
He walked to the quidditch pitches where he had argued with his classmate the night before, he climbed up the Slytherin spectator stand and sat in the wooden seats, thinking of his Slytherin classmate. He looked around him, the stars shone brightly in the night sky and were the only light to guide him, he could make out all of the constellations and thought back to his astrology classes and how he really should have tried harder, perhaps he might have been able to read his future in the stars so he wouldn’t act like such an idiot all of the time.
‘I know what you are you know, I figured it out not that you did the best job at hiding it that is’ he smirked slightly trying his best not to show any sense of fear, he didn’t want to give him anything over him, ‘we should talk Draco, that’s all I've wanted to do since last night when your stupid head crashed into me and knocked yourself out... talk’ he walked closer to the quidditch pitch, the blonde-haired boy following behind him.
He turned from the glass window bending down slightly to pick up a large maroon sweater from the aged wooden floor that bore the Gryffindor crest on its chest, placing it delicately over his head and onto his bare torso providing him with a slight warmth that he guessed was similar to what a hug might feel like, warm and comforting. He looked over at his dorm mates who all lay peacefully letting out soft breaths that made visible clouds in the air due to the temperature, they were all so calm and absent minded, he wondered what that felt like. How he longed to not have a care in the world, to sleep calmly without nightmares intruding upon your peaceful slumber, it was something he had never experienced and feared he might never experience a well slept night so long as he lived.
He lifted the boy in his arms, he was a lot lighter than he would have expected considering they were the same age and he believed the boy to be taller than he was, he was cradled in his arms like a baby and continued to look extremely peaceful in his grasp. He carried him through the castle grounds coming to the stairs that would lead him from the outside into the magical school and stopping at the bottom of those steps he thought it would be wise to use magic for the rest of the journey. He set the boy down gently on the grass as he lifted his wand from under his jumper casting a levitation spell, the boy floating behind him as he walked up the cool stone stairs. He opened the large wooden door and watched as the boy floated behind him entering into the castle. As the stairs moved softly in the night, he decided it best to follow them to his dormitory, he entered the dorms wooden door with the boy behind him once again seeing the intrusive red and golden hues of the dorm room trying his best to ignore them as he walked up the stairs into his dorm, he was surprised the stairs didn’t turn into a slide like they might for girls trying to get up them, he couldn’t tell if it was because he was floating or if it was because he was a boy, either way it worked for him, he wasn’t in the mood for a slide tonight especially not when he was trying to keep the boy afloat and out of anymore danger.
‘I don’t hate you Potter... I just thought you were different I- I hoped you were different’ he walked around the boy leaving him there, alone in the cold October night.
He had snuck out of his dorm past curfew many times before with his friends Hermione and Ron under the light of the moon but that was nothing compared to this. Those times he had been searching for a way to defeat Voldemort or searching for answers when he shouldn’t have been, using his invisibility cloak to conceal himself. This time was not like that. No invisibility cloak lay on his shoulder, only the red sweater, leaving him exposed in a quite literal way and to the revelatory nature of the moons light and he was not searching for answers, at least not in that way. He was searching for the truth in himself, and he hadn't even realised it. There was something missing in his life, something missing in him. He felt fragmented, like a shard of his mirror was missing, perhaps that was why he had found it so difficult to sleep lately, because how could he sleep if he wasn’t fully himself quite yet? His mind was constantly flowing with thoughts, of things both dark and demented, he had seen horrors and as much as he would smile and pretend, he was doing fine he knew that what he had been through would forever leave a lasting effect on his mind.
Once he had finished, he wiped the blood off of his chin and the two began to dig up dirt together and buried the bowtruckle and covered it in the dirt. He looked at the boy smiling as the two of them sat together by a tree talking about his eating his experience and how interesting Harry found it.
His looking into the mirror was interrupted by his notice of a shadow in the mirror's reflection, he was surprised he could even notice it, despite not obeying the laws of physics it could still catch the shadow of a someone outside of his gaze. He turned away from the mirror, his parents disappearing from his line of sight as he saw the end of a shadow turning into the corridor past him. He decided after a moment of deliberation that it would be worth his time and effort to follow the unknown figure. He lifted himself up leaving the mirror behind him as he had so many things that night, he had left so much behind him often not by choice but tonight he was choosing, and it was his choice to leave his dorm, to leave his dormmates behind, to leave this mirror behind him and now it was his choice to follow after this stranger.
‘There are several ways to tell if someone is a werewolf or more accurately known as a lycanthrope’ Harry heard Hermione give a sigh of recognition of the boys knowledge, ‘these are seclusion from general society especially near the time of a full moon, disappearance for several days after a full moon, excessive thirst or hunger, mood swings usually to the point of aggressive behavior there are of course physical signs like scarring and scratches on the body, and there are the superstitions but I am sure you would prefer me to stay to the facts professor’
‘I know you’re there Draco, please don’t hide from me, it makes me feel like a criminal of something’ he said turning around looking for him, ‘you’re very good at hiding but I don’t want you to’
The light of the moon was not reflected in the mirror although the more he thought of this the more it made sense. The mirror had been enchanted to show the viewer what they truly desired, it did not obey the typical laws of physics, although what item at Hogwarts did? He edged closer to the mirror and sat with him legs crossed in front of it seeing the image he had pushed to the back of his mind so many years ago. He saw his mother and father behind him although the image was slightly different than it once had been, as he sat on the floor so too did his father and mother, kneeling beside him their hands placed on his shoulders, his mother's head laying on top of his head, her other hand running through his messy hair that was so similar to his fathers it was scary. He was so often told of his similarity to his father that it had become like a habit for people to tell him of it, but every time he stood in front of that mirror, he saw what they meant, his messy hair was much like his fathers despite his grandfather Fleamont Potter creating Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion that was designed to tame and style even the most bushy or unruly hair, his jaw shape, his eyebrow shape, they all resembled his father. The only thing that did not resemble his father was his green eyes that were also so often commented on by those who met him.
With nothing but a house crested maroon sweater that covered a pair of boxer briefs he was wearing, Harry walked away from the large dorm window, past his dormmates who lay in their bed and to the dorm's door. The door swung open with his touch and the light of the moon from his window flooded the dorm room as he softly walked down the stairs to the common room looking at the red and gold features of the room. He noticed how the appeal of these combinations disappeared during the night, their hues were better suited to the golden shine of a summer sun or the orange glow of a warm fire during a winter night. But the summer sun shone no longer and no fire was lit, the colours looked more intrusive and aggressive than they had before, his mind wandered to the Slytherin common room and how the pale light of the moon would have been better suited if it shone through the large glass panes that showed the lake, the lake so beautifully reflected the light of the moon but to shine it through the common rooms large glass panes that revealed the lake would be a true beauty to behold.
‘Yes! He was! Merlin’s beard is there an echo in here?’ they grew quiet looking rather resigned at his raising his voice at them, ‘I didn’t mean to yell, I’m sorry I know you’re just concerned I’m just tired... yes i left I couldn’t sleep and so I went for a walk and I found my way to the whomping willow and one thing lead to another and he bumped into me and knocked himself out, so i brought him to our room to watch him because I haven't the faintest clue as to where the Slytherin dorm is beyond the dungeons not that I’d get in anyway, so i took him to our dorm and put him in my bed but when I woke he was gone, so that’s why I was asking’ they stared at him once he had finished his rant and despite opening her mouth several times Hermione could not form a sentence to reply to what he had said before the owl post decided to come and interrupt them, Hermione opened the Daily Prophet and looked rather concerned at whatever she was reading.
‘Well Harry it appears you’re question from early has been answered, he’s right there’ she was right he walked forward all eyes locked on him as he sat in the desk to the side of Harry, they both sat at the table at the edge the only thing parting them was the gap in the center on the class for students to walk through the two sides of the class to each set of tables. Snape made no comment about his late arrival instead turning on a projector to show the image of... a werewolf, hadn’t they learned this when Snape had taken over for Lupin?
‘Harry, Ron look’ she held the paper in front of them as she read it aloud, ‘Hogsmeade residents have reported a serious of animal attacks, large teeth marks have been found in a variety of livestock leading residents to believe there is a werewolf on the loose in Hogsmeade... it couldn’t be... could it?’
‘Well not impossible sir just increasingly difficult, as we are all aware Professor Lupin was one himself and he still got a job... before his resignation of course’ he looked rather guilty probably because his father had been one of the many parents who had complained about his teaching, ‘it would be impossible for the ministry to ban them from common society due to their near human intelligence they are held to the same ministry standards, and seeing as they are primarily human for a majority of their lifespan excluding them entirely would be a breach of their wizarding and human rights as set by the ministry during its formation in 1707’
‘No you’re not dreaming, yes I am a vampire and I suppose they do but I tend not to use them, I mainly eat raw meats or and here’s a fun fact, coconut water can be used as a blood plasma substitute in emergencies and so I can drink that if I need to, I tend not to drink real blood and I've never drunk muggle or wizard blood, that I’m aware of anyways’
‘I think the reason you do all of those things and know so much about those magical creatures is because you are one’ his smirk fell, ‘I think you, Draco Malfoy are a werewolf and... this part I am not sure about but I think you might also be responsible for those Hogsmeade attacks’
He walked slowly over to the seat they had saved for him, or the one he was assuming they had saved for him; it would be rather awkward if they had been saving it for another classmate and he had sat in that seat, but to be honest things were already incredibly awkward between them so he might as well pile on the awkwardness and get it over with, it would be awkward and over or awkward and ongoing, he knew which one he would prefer. As he edged forward to the seat, he saw Ron look up slightly from his food with a small smirk before hiding it and looking back down, Hermione gave a small quick glance up from her book and then returned her gaze to its aged pages, her expressions unchanged. They were sitting beside one another which was a rather uncommon sight but he supposed it made sense that if he wasn’t there and they were annoyed with him that they wouldn’t want to sit beside him, despite saving the seat for him, curtesy and kindness were two very different thing. He sat down in front of them, giving them a smile that was not returned, as they slowly turned to one another with an uncertain glance before looking at him and giving him a reluctant smile back. They sat in silence for a few moments before laughing at the awkwardness of the situation.
‘Well if you are going to tell me that I am crazy if I don’t be honest then I suppose we shouldn’t talk anymore’ Harry stormed off despite Hermione and Ron’s calls after him and refused to speak to them in any of the classes they had together which made group work rather difficult and awkward but he held his tongue as well as his pride regardless, he knew he was right in his beliefs and he wouldn't let Mrs. Know It All Hermione tell him otherwise, she was constantly undermining and correcting him, well not this time. He refused to let her do it. Despite their best efforts he would not speak to them, he was stubborn like that. He wouldn’t even speak to Ron in their dorm room and refused to reply when he wished him a good night, he knew he wouldn’t sleep tonight much like any other night, clearly Ron didn’t listen when he told him of his sleepless nights, too hung up much like Hermione on his so called ‘obsession’ with Draco.
‘No, I have not become mentally deficient I am aware that I taught you this very subject not two years ago, but given the recent... attacks’ his eyes fell upon the blonde-haired boy before continuing, ‘the headmaster and school board appear to find it imperative that I remind you the dangers of werewolves, how to defend yourself against them and of course the signs of a werewolf... because much like myself they appear to be aware of how idiotic you all truly are’ always like Snape to get that insult in there, wouldn’t be a lesson with Snape otherwise.
‘Actually, I think it’s my turn to ask a question right does that sound fair?’ Harry nodded shocked at his forwardness, ‘so what I'm wondering is why couldn’t sleep is that a common thing or was that just a last night thing... this night too I suppose but I feel you were only out tonight to find me’
The next morning, he could feel the weight of yesterday's problems on his shoulders, he moved through the motions almost like he wasn't entirely there, like he wasn’t fully present and while he often wasn’t sure if this was because of his lack of sleep or not this time he was sure. It was because of what had happened with Draco at the quidditch stadium the previous night. People kept speaking to him; telling him stories, information for classes, ranging from the unimportant to the critical but no matter the importance he did not fully listen, it went in one ear and out the other as the phrase went. He hadn’t seen Draco all of that day despite having quite a few classes with him, he did not spit out knowledgeable facts on werewolves in their defense against the dark arts class that morning – he didn’t even show up. He wasn't at breakfast, but the two that were, were the last people that he planned on seeing... Hermione and Ron. They hadn't hidden, or ran, or did it out of defiance, they had even saved him a spot to sit in despite how horribly he had treated them regarding the whole Draco thing, they had only been trying to help him and all things considered, he realized had they done the same he might have and probably would have reacted in the same way as they had probably worse, he had been a pretty shit friends lately and they really didn’t deserve it, especially considering everything they had done to help him with Voldemort and the death eaters, they had almost died multiple times for him.
He left the intrusiveness of his common room behind him as he opened common rooms aged wooden door as softly as he could and while looking once more at the room behind him he carefully closed the wooden door without making a sound, he was surprised it did not give off a revealing creak that would echo through the corridors, luckily for him it had not. The corridors of the magical school too looked different in this light, the soft greys of the ancient stones suited the light that shone on them, the staircases now appeared to move more softly and calmly in the night, they no longer looked dangerous and aggressive as they so often did when he had stood on them and had faced the staircases moving and obstructing his path to wherever he had been going. The moon seemed to have that effect on things, it either softened them or showed their true aggression, he knew which one he preferred and though he could not see it the moon also softened his face despite the lightning scar on his head and various other scars he had collected over the years, the pale light had neutralised them momentarily making them appear almost artistic. Harry had spent so much of his childhood searching for the truth behind things, that the moons light revealing the truth for him was a real comfort, he wished he had discovered its revelatory powers sooner, it might have been a useful skill to have.
What happened next was not what Harry had been expecting, in fact he would have preferred literally anything else, because at that very moment Draco Malfoy was laughing at him. His laugh was soft yet had an unintentional mocking tone to it, and had an infectiousness to it that made Harry want to laugh with him, but Harry did not want to laugh, he felt incredibly awkward sitting there as the boy's laughter slowed and finally stopped his grey eyes meeting Harry’s green ones.
The stranger had all but disappeared, he couldn’t see them in the dark of the night, despite the light of the moon lighting his path their shadow was nowhere to be seen, he had completely lost them or he supposed they had completely lost him had that been their intention. As he looked around him, he noticed the lack of life that was present on the school grounds. In the corner of his eye he could swear he saw the movement of a shining tentacle in the lake as it slithered softly through the water. He would ask himself why the beast was awake at this time of night although he supposed he could not judge it; he too was restless in the night and understood why it might be awake at this time of night. Maybe it too was following a mysterious shadow it had seen under its waters. Hopefully the giant squid was having more luck than he was at finding the owner of its shadow.
The boy was quite knowledgeable on the subject, the more Harry thought about it the more he realized that the answer he gave was something similar to one Hermione would give, dare he say more detailed than she would give. It was quite strange the more he thought about it, his long absences from class, the fact that no one ever saw him anymore, his late-night wanderings, could he have just turned? No, it was nowhere near the full moon, although perhaps he was preparing for his next transformation. Could Draco Malfoy be a werewolf? He now realized it might not be that unlikely. The class drew on and as Harry turned to speak to the boy, he found he was gone.
‘Hmm well now Harry don’t give me any ideas’ Hermione raised her eyebrow jokingly as she closed her book placing a bookmark at the page she had left, ‘of course I cannot speak for Ronald here but as for myself I am willing to leave the past in the past and move forward, but Harry you have to be more patient and friendly to us, we know you’ve been through a lot but so have we and we’re here for you but you have to be here for us too, and I suppose we could be more open to your ideas, even if it is you jumping to conclusions about our classmates’
‘So you saw me in the corridors and turned away planning to go back to your dormitory but you heard my footsteps growing closer and then turning away and your curiosity got the better of you and you followed me, to the mirror of Erised and watched me as I looked in the mirror and as you went to leave I caught your shadow and so you left the castle hoping I wasn’t following you, when you realized I was you hid behind something and when i continued to walk you followed me now caught up in this game like thing we were doing what you didn’t account for was me hiding behind the whomping willow and so you crashed into me and knocked yourself out, now I might be filling in some blanks here so pay attention, so when I saw you knocked out I realized I did not know the exact location of your dorm and knew i wouldn’t get in anyway so I took you to my dorm and tucked you in, after I fell asleep you woke up at some stage and realized where you were and panicked before rushing quietly out and going back to the Slytherin dorm, that sound about right?’
He couldn’t describe the feeling, at first there was a sharp pain as they were inserted but as he began to suck the blood out of the boys neck the feeling was absolutely euphoric, it was almost like a drug, addicting, as he pushed the boy into his neck further the two of them moaning, his blood tasted sweet and Draco had never tasted the sweetness of wizarding blood and he didn’t want anything else ever again. As the night led on after the experience of him sharing his blood with Draco, the two were bonded in a way he could not describe but he knew they both mutually felt.
He walked silently under the light of the moon finding that he was not as alone as he might have thought, although faint his ears had caught the sound of rustling leaves... from behind him. Perhaps the stranger had not being running from him but had been following him all along, if that was true then they were the person that was standing behind him, they were following him. His only question was why? Why was the person following him and what had they been doing out so late? Were they burdened by restless nights like he had been or had they just made a choice like he had to leave their dorm and explore how the night affected the castle like he had?
‘Well don’t worry about that, I definitely will not be accusing him of anything after yesterday’ he gave them a dry chuckle as they smiled at him, Hermione handed him a plate of toast and he lifted a piece and ate it, smiling at the two of them, things were getting better.
‘You were following me last night, I think... I don’t think that’s why you left, I believe you were in a situation not unlike my own, you were restless, you couldn’t sleep and so you went for a walk, what you weren’t counting on was me being there... am I getting this right so far?’
‘So why did you... I didn’t want you to leave me, I missed you quite a lot... sorry that was stupid for me to say’ he swallowed hard trying his hardest not to stare at the boy's fangs, but it was extremely difficult.
Harry rubbed where his head had been bumped and looked up to see who on earth had bumped into him and to conclude who had been following him all night. As he looked up he saw a jumper not so different to his own with hues of green and silver that were complimented by the shine of the moons light, as he thought it might. He turned the figure over to their back and saw the face of a boy. His pale skinned face looked almost white under the light as did his pale blonde hair and grey eyes, he was the perfect candidate for the moons soft light to extenuate his already gothic features. He analysed the boy more clearly and began to notice more of his features than he had before. His cheeks were hollowed to such a state that he made Harry look filled out almost as though the boy hadn’t eaten in years. He too had bags under his eyes that shone a beautiful shade of purple and black, further indicating a lack of sleep, this clearly was not his first late night. He was beautiful in this light, every feature was enhanced, every shadow on his face increased. He felt that he knew the boy from somewhere and it soon dawned on him that the boy was a fellow classmate of his, he believed his name to be Draco... Draco Malfoy. He never saw him in class anymore, there were whispers of him, some had said he was sick, others believed him cursed however the most common one was that his deranged parents had taken him from the school and locked him away in their manor due to over protectiveness. If all of those theories had been incorrect then where had he been?
He flipped the projector showing a rather aged looking image of a werewolf with writing alongside it that was barely readable as their textbooks floated in front of them and opened on the page they were to learn about, clearly snape was in no mood for any hesitation in their education or more likely he wanted to get his topic over and done with so he could continue with his usual lesson.
“Well he can’t very well be serious about coming here, can he? However did he find the location? Unless it’s some blood magic, that would be just the thing…” Hermione puts in, trailing off as she appears to start mentally cataloging the spells she’s heard of that could do such a thing.
“Anyway, that’s adults for you. Add the flightiness of teenagers and I have to say I’m not a fan of the idea. Even less so if we can’t put a name to a face!” Moody continues, as though no one had spoken. “Doesn’t mean much to have someone speak for ya if no one actually does the speaking up, does it?” He nods at them all when he’s finished his diatribe, but it hardly matters.
"It's quite alright." Lupin nudges the other set of socked feet on the ottoman with his own. "Sirius?"
or anything, but once—and only once, near the end of the year—when Malfoy had ended up in a shower stall two down from Harry on the other side, he had reached up to adjust the spray with his left arm, and there hadn’t been a scrape or freckle on it. It was all just pale, pale skin.
Harry tastes blood but he’s tasted it before and he’ll taste it again. What he can’t get over is the pervasive tiredness radiating from Malfoy; even his punch had been somewhat weak. Harry steadies himself against the wall and appraises Malfoy again. “D’you wanna talk about it?”
She stops as if she expected it, and Harry gets up, bad knee popping, without letting go of the woman who was his wife for, shite… twenty years.
"He didn't do anything," James finally mutters, which doesn't enlighten Harry any further. "He finally broke up with Vicky and I finally broke up with Eliza, and I dunno how to explain it, Dad, but I guess sometimes when you've got two people who are going through the same thing but were, y'know, raised totally differently or who are just yin and yang, well maybe we both need a little bit of space. Is what I'm saying."
After the initial fanfare, Malfoy mostly becomes a non-event, that first day. It helps that he's both drawn and withdrawn, sitting by himself in the corner of the library, reading a book that—after having snatched it out of Malfoy's hands and looked it over suspiciously—even Moody was forced to allow as harmless.
She pats his back and then draws away. "Yes," she says, brown eyes bright. "You always did. You always did do that, Harry."
They’ve both wandered, it seems, clear up into the attic; Harry didn’t realize those back stairs were cramped for a reason and not just because of something silly like their being a servant’s staircase. But he can see it now, how the roofline narrows and how the late afternoon sun slants sideways in through the windows, uninterrupted by the heights of other homes or buildings. They’re clearly on the top floor.
Ron's still eyeing him, of course, but Ginny is busy having a talk with Mr. Weasley somewhere, so eventually he loses interest.
Harry… never thought he'd be sat here during the summer hols bantering with Malfoy. He doesn't know what to say. Maybe this is the trade-off for not having to be with the Dursleys for a bit. “Let me guess, in Slytherin that’s an insult? You’re offended?”
Ron, for his part, looks like he's about to rain down a verbal assault on Malfoy for involving himself in the conversation, or maybe for insinuating something bad would happen to Harry's godfather. His ears are red, though he's distracted by the way Hermione is tugging on his arm in a quelling manner.
"-my point is, as far as the family is concerned, the gay thing isn't a problem. Like I said, Charlie's gay now, so…"
him, I was making a point that it's not an issue of… look, Hermione and I talked about it and we agreed it's important you know that we're not… and Mum and Dad, they're not… it's not
you either, mind. Don’t stand a chance without you, do I?” His smile had been tentative, not his normal, carefree one.
"Oh," says James then, and Harry watches as his oldest son clenches and relaxes his fist where it rests on his knee, twice. "That means he's having a rough go, but that he’s feeling up to faking it.”
Ron and Hermione are off doing god knows what—though Harry has his guesses—so he feels justified in taking his leave of the library and going off to search. Worst case scenario, he finds Ron and Hermione fighting instead of Malfoy. Slightly better scenario, Harry finds them… not-fighting, finally making good on those moon eyes that have been going between them since Ron’s unexpected and unexpectedly heartfelt apology to Hermione for his role in all the discord of last year.
"Well done," Harry interrupts. His Ogden's and soda is making him caustic. "Back to talking about me like we're back in school and I’ve another stupid
“So, as I was saying,” Lupin continues, voice gentle as it nearly always is, “you may feel uncomfortable, but we really need to know which of you Malfoy thinks will attest to his trustworthiness.”
at her and smiles; it's comfort he wants suddenly, rather than something to wake him up. Harry even stuffs another biscuit into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully, grateful for the sugar. He feels better after he swallows.
Somehow, Harry always manages to forget that November is a month of mourning for more than just him, that Halowe’en gives way to All Saints’ Day and a sort of quiet melancholy, even beyond his own imagination.
Harry is halfway through a drink trying not to think about that, when the fire goes green; he’s standing before it flares down, wand out and glass coming to a muffled end on the living room carpet. “Who is it?”
And James may well have him there, but Harry wasn’t born yesterday either. “Well, why haven’t you checked on him either, then? Did you two have a falling out?” he asks.
So then, if she can shake her rightful resentment and act the bigger person, that simply forces the question: why can’t Harry?
Harry puts down his coffee with a disgusted sigh and catches the shop girl's eye. They're one of only two tables with people here. He mouths '
Harry copies Sirius's grin. It's good to see him a bit happier. "Well, maybe the presence of a potential witness will keep Kreacher from offing you in your sleep, too."
Harry and Ron share a fond look over her head. It’s a useful sort of tic for covering what Harry’s really feeling, aside from the fondness. Namely, anxiety.
Instead, Harry pounds back mug after mug of strong, opaque tea like it's going out of style, and the other Aurors give him a wide berth.
Harry, for his part, wonders how Sirius has occasion to know what lengths the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black will go to keep its own secrets. He wonders how many times and how many ways Sirius must have tried, to have such faith now. Hermione looks like she’s having a similar thought, if her pitying look is anything to go by; Sirius goes back to studying the tapestry.
As his search through the disused but very full rooms of Grimmauld Place wears on without a sign of either his friends or his enemy, Harry begins to wonder about this place where Sirius apparently was raised. It’s dingy, it’s dark, it’s cluttered and it’s creepy.
But Harry drains his glass as Ron steams in the corner of his eye, and then leaves enough coins for both of their tabs on the counter. And then he walks away.
All of them are busy looking between themselves, considering. Who would do anything with Malfoy that would make him consider them ‘close’? Ron in particular looks a bit green at the thought.
“I just didn’t want Sirius to think I couldn’t take a joke, even from that git. I don’t know. I was just thinking, well, we’re stuck here with him, aren’t we?”
He’d taken her hand and Harry had just sat there. Hermione had said nothing, so fixed was her gaze on Ron’s.
After knowing her for years, Harry and Ron stand too and Harry begins to make his way to the door to the hall, sure Hermione wants a pow-wow in his and Ron’s room. However, Sirius gets his hand around Harry’s wrist and stops him.
"I'm not a kid anymore. I love you, Dad," James tells him as Harry himself stands. He gives Harry a hug that's just like Ginny's, just like the one she gave him earlier in Barnok's windowless law office. "I really do, y'know? But you've cocked it up."
The next morning at work is a Horntail of a morning, and not just because Harry is mildly hungover, although that's part of it. He can't drink like he used to when he was twenty-five.
"Just make sure you figure out what you're doing by Christmas hols, will you? Albus and Lil will be home and we can't shuffle them off to the Burrow the whole time. This place is a graveyard. Okay?"
Draco scoffs but he also looks unhappy, like he knows he lost that one. "Fine. I'll have some precious tea. If it's awful, I blame you."
While he’s thinking about it, Ginny beats him to the punch. “We’re dating. Well, not dating. But seeing a bit of each other as long as he’s promised not to be a pain about it.”
make us seem more mature, more focused to the adult Order members.” She leans forward and gives Harry a significant look. “If you’re serious about getting more information, proving you can be trusted to handle it without indulging a schoolboy grudge would go a long way, I think.”
The Order of the Phoenix doesn’t just let fifteen-year-old Draco Malfoy in the front door; they’re not idiots. They make him wait on the front step first.
Harry continues saying nothing. He has a horrible feeling, like the one he gets before a storm or a fight. It crawls along his skin.
Only so much of that is explainable by way of its lack of maintenance over the decade of its abandonment. Certainly, some of it predates Sirius’s incarceration, and that gives Harry some rather unpleasant ideas about his godfather’s home life.
In this instance, the words his son says also go straight to the heart of what's wrong between Ginny and Harry, and that's dizzying too. But he can't make this about him. He is the parent and James is the child, for all that he has apparently grown into this mature stranger.
Ginny makes for the door, all Weasley red ears and Seeker quickness, but in that last at least they've always been matched. Harry reaches out for her wrist. "Wait, I-"
“Nah, it can’t be, Fred,” says George—well, presumably George, unless they’re having them all on—immediately, “she’s only just gone and she said it would be a week of work.”
, and (most touchingly in Harry’s mind) four sets of heights carved into the doorframe of the kitchen. There they all are: James, Lily, Albus, and Teddy.
, and it’s somewhat of a relief to find out that now is no different. The only unsettling bit is how close Harry came to feeling bad for the git.
And that’s suspicious. It sets up the familiar drumbeat of curiosity in Harry’s mind. This, he is used to when it comes to Malfoy. He’s always up to
He doesn’t hear what Lupin says in response, but it sounds affirmative. Harry lets the leftover warmth in Lupin’s tone fill him up as he climbs the stairs. It carries him until he flops on the bed he’s been using and rolls over to see Ron and Hermione perched like a pair of parents on Ron’s own bed.
A sigh. “You’ve been drinking.” James only goes full Shakespearean when he’s had a pint or two, and at least one shot. “Broke up with whatsername, have you?”
His gaze meets Harry’s for a moment and Harry hears it in the silence that answers Remus’s assertion; he hears what was left unspoken. (It cannot be allowed to happen
“Honestly, I shouldn’t; you’re not worth the inquiry, Potter,” Malfoy says at the same time as Harry opens his mouth.
“Yeah, m’fine, Sirius.” He makes himself smile, aware that Malfoy is still watching them. “Dinner soon, yeah?”
Sirius, who has until now been leaning nonchalantly against the tapestry at the far wall, the one with his family tree, speaks up. “The house has accepted me as the rightful heir for now, and since he isn’t of age, Malfoy can’t challenge that. It will keep him from revealing its location, as long as he is within these walls. Directions to here, written in a letter, will slide off the page, Patronus charms sent with messages will dissipate at the property line, that sort of thing. But we can’t keep him here forever and the house’s reach is limited.”
He finds himself at Andromeda Tonks née Black’s home, or more specifically at the door of the little cottage on the property where his godson, Teddy, lives. Why? He can’t say for certain.
"I thought he was going to marry her," James admits, and it's striking how affected he sounds by the notion. Harry can't figure it out, except that it goes back to that same idea of all roads leading back to the sea of Weasleys, when it comes to the disparate tributaries of their family.
Harry is just contemplating how darkly funny it is that two worlds that are so different—so different that they barely share the concepts of things like trousers or ballpoints—seem to agree on
Mad-Eye Moody casts a Disillusionment Charm on him so he’s quite safe standing there, Harry supposes. Not that Harry cares. He barely has the time to peek around the horrid moth-eaten curtains in the sitting room—and all he sees is a shimmer to the air, like a mirage—before Arthur Weasley, followed closely by his wife and then the rest of the Order members that are about today, walks in.
But Harry has to admit he’s curious. That curiosity only grows as no one comes forward. The twins start snickering to themselves until their father gives them a look, and Ron is watching Hermione like a hawk. Harry continues picking at a thread in his too-large jeans, and considers his options.
It's the sort of cold-down-your-back, nasty shock of a thought that he's been having more and more lately. It's the kind of thought that has him here, in an office piled haphazardly with books and scrolls presumably concerning Wizarding family law, in the first place.
Teddy to be worried. He's the godfather and Teddy is the godchild. Harry is supposed to worry over him, not the other way 'round.
Harry has thoughts. But he can't talk about them here. He means to find out what Malfoy is really up to, but so far there's been nothing for it but to watch his platinum head bent over his reading. It's boring.
something, rather than things merely happening to him. “What did Teddy do?” Harry ends up asking instead.
Harry, who is still digesting the fact that Malfoy and Sirius are related and has been since finding it out, says nothing.
Harry's throat goes tight. All the firewhiskey in the world can't numb what it does to him to hear his son's voice go so strained and stammering. He feels
This place is about as far in the other direction from the outward appearance of Privet Drive as it could possibly be, but. But the air is the same, somehow. They’re both, for him, full of stagnant pain, the kind that one has come to expect. Harry’s not sure if that’s the kind of thing wizards can sense normally, or if it’s something like Parseltongue that’s going to be further evidence against his sanity. For that reason, he hasn’t mentioned it to anyone.
Sirius blinks. He turns to Harry and draws his knees up to sit cross-legged, which makes his joints let out a crackling sound that Lupin winces at. "Oh, hey kid."
He has no idea what that's supposed to mean, really, but he feels the truth of it anyway, somewhere in his chest. James pats him on the back and lets go, even as Harry tries to find words to apologize for something he doesn't quite understand.
And then, surreally and from across the room, Malfoy speaks. "That's assuming he doesn't ask for my help, Potter." His book gets lowered to his lap.
Well, it turns out, Harry sort of can. Malfoy is kind of easy to feel sorry for when he does things like not come out of his and Sirius’s room for three days.
Unmarked, basically. Not by nature and not by Voldemort either. So Harry could speak to that, possibly.
Truthfully, Harry wishes he and Gin hadn’t had an audience at all, for their breakdown. But it’s rather good that James was here to distract Albus and Lily, now that he thinks on it.
Malfoy sneers at him and turns away, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. Harry takes a step forward over the threshold of the attic room, and notes two things. First, a person made of pillows stuffed into a jumper and an old cloak, tied to the pockmarked wooden post of a rather narrow bed. Second, a shadow fleeing the frame of a nearby portrait.
Harry just doesn't want to lose the jovial mood. He doesn't want Sirius to think that he and his friends can't take a joke. He says the first thing that comes to mind. "I don't think so. House elves are smart and they talk. Surely your reputation as the consummate cock-up waiting to happen precedes you."
Moody casts his eyes—both the magical one and the other, though at separate paces—over the group of them, but Harry pays it little mind.
Draco hesitates for a moment. Then he looks Harry dead in the eye and says, "Whoever knew you were such a priss, Potter? You really are champing at the bit to run and tell 'Father'. Or what passes for one, anyway."
He can’t give it any more thought, though, because Mrs. Weasley stomps from the room with her hand over her mouth while Mr. Weasley remains gravely silent, Mad-Eye Moody does a scary half-growl, half-tsk sound, Remus watches Sirius, and Sirius watches Harry very, very carefully.
After three-quarters of an hour spent silent over bitter coffee and sandwiches at some back-alley tea shop tucked away near the Ministry, Malfoy comes out with it.
"If you're not going to pretend to pay attention, you could at least refrain from speaking about me like I'm not here," Ginny says quietly.
“Tonks?” one of the twins puts in from over near the bookcase that they’ve been all but guarding since breakfast. Harry would be willing to bet they’ve found some naughty journal, or perhaps an advanced or otherwise questionably-legal tome of charms.
He may think Malfoy a raging prick, and Harry does avoid working with him at every chance he gets. However, that hasn't insulated Harry from the gossip amongst the Auror ranks at all. Malfoy constantly gets the shite assignments and always has, ever since he joined. He gets the calls out that have the highest propensity for danger and the lowest likelihood of netting him any glory. He never gets to round up any of his or his father's former friends. Instead, Malfoy is put through a monthly meeting with his section captain where he gets mined for intel, and then that intel is used to drum up assignments for other Aurors. (More trusted Aurors.)
Teddy answers when he knocks, after a moment, and Harry can admit that he finds it deeply endearing, Teddy's eccentric mix of bookish and punk. See current example: the younger man opens the door clad only in a pair of fawn-brown corduroy pants, and a moon tattoo that curls against his sternum and over his pec. Both Teddy's feet and his chest are otherwise bare.
"Look, I reckon she can just have half of it, she's the mother of my children, can you lot just… I dunno, divvy things up?" Harry asks recklessly. He really doesn't want to be here.
"He didn't need checking in on," Harry finally says, contemplating his firstborn. "He so rarely does."
And Harry doesn't think Mrs. Weasley would hold a grudge against a child to the point of not feeding one of them, not really, but then again he vividly recalls her sending Hermione a tiny chocolate egg alongside his and Ron's dragon-sized ones last Easter. And that had been over a rumor of schoolgirl romance gone wrong, whereas Draco's father nearly caused Ginny's death via soul-sucking enchanted diary.
“Said one of you would speak for him. He said one of you lot were close but wouldn’t say who,” Moody discloses further, and now Harry’s paying attention. “Now I’ll have you know I don’t put much stock in the strength of adolescent bonds, formed as they are by your rotten… hormones and things to hear the Muggles tell it. You can’t even trust an adult lover, not if you want to keep all your bits attached as they’re meant to-”
The laugh that bubbles out of Malfoy’s throat, seemingly without his permission if his expression is anything to go by, is ugly.
Teddy stops fiddling with the electric kettle on the rickety sideboard. He pushes back his long, pink bangs and looks at Harry. “Yeah, he did.” He comes to sit next to Harry, the advent of tea seemingly temporarily forestalled.
Unfortunately, they're not subtle about it, and knowing that he's being managed and avoided by his team only makes Harry's temper even more foul as the day wears on.
Ginny just looks at him for a long moment. The goblin coughs a grumpy little rumble of a cough, being completely unsubtle about it. Ginny sighs, extricating her wrist from his grasp, and folds Harry into a hug. It feels like the very last one, Harry thinks, being somewhat of an expert in saying goodbyes, but then so did the one previous from back when she'd first moved out.
Mrs. Weasley opens her mouth first when Mr. Weasley hesitates, but Sirius cuts her off. “My cousin is here,” he announces.
But Malfoy simply raises the heat, with slow firm strokes that squeeze Harry just right. Harry continues to fight for a calm façade, even though his jaw tightens under the effort and his eyes space out. But when Malfoy adds an unexpected twist at the top of a stroke, he can’t hold back a moan.
Malfoy’s head whips up and he stares at Harry in shock; it takes him several seconds to understand. Then he snorts.
It’s obvious what he’s getting at, but Harry isn’t sure if he can even make it that far. This, this is what he’s wanted. All of this. It doesn’t really matter what they do exactly; he would have been fine just kissing Malfoy all night long. Hell, he would have been fine drinking whiskey together. This is just … overkill.
Harry finds his shorts and his t-shirt, and joins Malfoy by the fire. He isn’t sure if this silence is meant to be enjoyed, but he does. That is, until Malfoy speaks and his voice is dripping venom.
“Well,” He says, eloquently. Considers pretending that he was joking too. Discards that strategy as too obvious. Continues on autopilot, sort of detached from his body. “Yeah.”
It’s clear from the way he sounds that any answer Harry could offer is doomed to ridicule. So Harry counters with a question instead: “Why did you save mine?”
“Well,” Malfoy deadpans, “I figured maybe Weasley would be up for a shag tonight.” When Harry fails to laugh, he sighs and gives the sock a shake in mid-air before pocketing it again. “This is a Lifesaver. It always contains that which you have forgotten. Like Longbottom’s stupid bauble, except actually useful.”
Before long, everybody is talking to everybody, sharing funny stories from their school years. There is a lot to tell. Some of their jokes fall short, because they suddenly ring on painful notes, but someone always refills the glasses and picks up the threads. They all want to get along tonight, it seems.
Malfoy looks at him with a strange expression. A dash of surprised amusement, maybe. “Yes, quite,” He says. “They’re very rare. Now turn around and get on your knees.”
When Harry attempts the same a minute later, after a brief stupor of absolute astonishment, he is intercepted by Hermione and a very drunk Ron.
“I always wondered why you saved my life,” He snarls. “Made you look like such a hero. So was it because you had
, is it really that late?!” Harry jumps up. “Hermione was supposed to apparate us home, she’s probably about to tear this place down if I’m not back soon!”
There are no words for the rapture that is Draco Malfoy’s lips on him, the way pleasure spills over his skin like ambrosia from a shattered flask. Malfoy’s arms slide around his waist, pulling him close as the blond barely ends the first kiss only to press another just below it, and Harry can’t speak, can’t move, can’t breathe. He stands still as a statue, barely able to stand just receiving Malfoy’s attention without breaking into a thousand pieces.
Now that Malfoy isn’t moving, that Harry isn’t as caught up in his own sensations, he notices that the blond seems to be panting, his lips still parted though he’s no longer smiling. There may even be a flush on his cheeks, but that could be the dying fire.
so?” He says, and then starts laughing, the kind of laugh that barely allows him to breathe. Harry joins in, and they laugh until their eyes water and their ribs hurt, at the absurdity and tragedy and the pain.
Harry can’t get his mouth to work. He feels hot and cold at once, feels everybody’s eyes on him, feels Malfoy’s wink like a shove in the chest. Malfoy knows. Since when? Has he known all this time?
Harry just swallows, just stares, just begs Malfoy with his eyes and hopes he isn’t going to have to do it out loud. Because to hear himself say those words might split him right through the middle.
Harry can tell that this is kind of a moment for the people around them. He can appreciate the fact that for them, seen from the outside, this is sort of a story of reconciliation –
“Thank you,” He finally whispers, so quietly that it can barely be heard over the crackling of the fire. “For defeating him. For everything. I was so-“ His voice falters, and he looks down at his hands, or perhaps at his arm where the evidence of his evil choices will always be engraved. “I really did hate you,” He confesses, eyes cast down. “I really believed all that bullshit. I’m – so sorry.“
He admits it must have started before they were even 13. He admits that it didn’t stop even when Malfoy was a Death Eater. He doesn’t admit that it never stopped at all, but he doesn’t deny it either, just sort of leaves it unspoken. Nobody asks.
,” Hermione says. “You said it yourself, Harry, this is a time for unity and peacemaking. Just let Malfoy be Malfoy and come back to the party.”
“No magic,” He says. Better to avoid a repeat of this situation; both of their nerves are probably on edge now.
Gradually the shock is replaced by a hard, cold look that Harry could have lived with having seen the last of. “What, you’re willing to get in bed with me but you still think I’ll hex you?” Malfoy spits out. “Not sure what that says about your judgment.”
It’s painful, Harry has to admit, the way Dumbledore is suddenly here with them. The loss of him still hurts after all this time. But even through the weight of his own sadness, and the anger he will always feel at Malfoy about it, he can hear the self-loathing in Malfoy’s voice, and he knows it for what it is. He makes a conscious choice not to go down that road, not right now, perhaps not ever. He stays in the here and now with a waxen Malfoy whose hair is still a little messed up.
When Malfoy gives him a particularly deep thrust, Harry’s hands shoot up and claw into the other man’s shoulder blades, his eyes rolling back, seeing stars, and Malfoy seems to find his personality again. He laughs at Harry, but it sounds a little chafed, raw the way that Harry’s entire body feels too.
Like a mostly naked Malfoy, pushing Harry’s legs apart in a way that makes the prostrate man choke. Slicking up his beautiful, long cock with the remainder of the vial’s silvery contents, unselfconscious of how catastrophically sexy he looks. Lining the head of his dick up with Harry’s hole.
,” Malfoy repeats, more sharply than before. His pale hands curl into the armrests. “I just didn’t kill you. That’s the difference between you and me, Potter. You saved people. I just … didn’t kill them.”
Malfoy’s face lights up at that, his eyes widening and his lips curling, and he does it again, and again, begins to break up his slow rhythm with faster, more irregular strokes. All the while he stares at Harry’s face with a look like intense, almost manic fascination; every sound, every swallow, every twitch of Harry’s abs is echoed on Malfoy’s face as he drives him on. Before long the blond’s sparkling white teeth are bared as if in a snarl and Harry is biting his lip to stifle the worst of it as Malfoy jerks him off vigorously.
This has been going on for years, and the only reason Harry has never stood up and said what they all must be thinking—namely, that it's bollocks even if Malfoy is a prat—is because he was always well aware that Malfoy was racking up points for his appellate case. If this bit of suffering, he'd thought, was going to keep Malfoy out of Azkaban by overturning his knee-jerk conviction from only a few weeks after the end of the war, then fine. As far as Harry was concerned, no one deserved that place, and more than once he'd been part of Hermione's political push to shut the place down.
But Malfoy won’t let him hold on to this defense. As soon as he’s got Harry fully naked, himself still wrapped in his shimmering robes, he backs off and takes a long, uninhibited look. His cool grey eyes seem to take stock of every line, every muscle, every dapple of hair. A particularly long and pointed look is directed at Harry’s erect penis, and when he’s seen it all he catches Harry’s gaze as if in a steely grip and smiles in that gloating, menacing way Harry has never seen anyone else quite manage.
He isn’t sure how he is going to do it, though. He has imagined the conversation a hundred different ways, but in the end, it just doesn’t make sense. These things should be kept private, secret. He shouldn’t even be thinking about Malfoy in the first place. But then again, the world is magical. And somehow, in a strange way, maybe this actually is a sign that he should … make up with Malfoy. Somehow. Maybe.
He tells himself it’s because of the dreams that he wants to see Malfoy. Why they’ve come back now, after a period of arguably more or less forgetting about his school crush, is a mystery. Harry’s always liked mysteries, and never could leave them alone. He wants to know what’s going on with his head, and since he hasn’t been able to figure it out on his own, the logical thing to do is meet Malfoy and confront his feelings.
Harry looks up in surprise, at Malfoy’s face that is suddenly much closer than it was before. Once more he is shocked by this face, by the beauty and proximity of it. A full-body shudder washes through him and he leans up on instinct, catching Malfoy’s lips with his own. He has to strain into it to reach the other; it feels like leaning across an abyss and Malfoy doesn’t exactly help him bridge it but at least he doesn’t move away, at least he welcomes Harry into his mouth and kisses him back. Then he starts thrusting again, and Harry’s head falls back onto the bed as he cries out wordlessly.
Malfoy, who flinched at Voldemort’s name like the flames had jumped out to lick him, clearly isn’t following. “But you
“Would you like that silence spell now?” Malfoy asks. He withdraws his finger and adds a second one, which slips into Harry as easily and sweetly as the first. He brings both fingers right back down on Harry’s prostate, to the desired effect. “Too late. Let them all hear you.”
Somehow that statement makes Harry even more suspicious. He narrows his eyes at Malfoy, suddenly more alert than he has been since that first kiss. “And you just happened to have that with you?”
He does not stop until he has drawn the first, if tiny, whimper out of Harry’s throat. Then he lets go, gives Harry the chance to turn to him. He seems about to say something, but it dies on his tongue when their eyes meet, and they crash into a kiss instead, a closed-eyed, unbreathing, back-clutching defueling of a kiss. Once broken out of his petrification, Harry can’t keep his hands to himself; he grabs and pulls on every part of Malfoy he can reach. He kisses with his whole body, like an athlete putting every muscle behind a throw.
Everybody around them falls silent, seems to hold their breath but not like Harry does. Malfoy’s eyes are just like they always were, that icy shade of grey, sizing him up.
He can hear Malfoy’s breaths, if you can call them that; gasps would seem the more appropriate term. The man sounds as if he is undertaking a great feat of strength or endurance, like he’s tensing every muscle in his body. He pulls out a little bit, only to thrust right back into Harry’s slickened hole with a hiss.
There is silence after this, in which steps drift in from the hall and fade again. Malfoy seems to pale even beyond his usual state. His eyes flutter down to his hands, up at Harry, back down.
Harry is not prepared to deal with this. Rubbing his temples, he says, “Would you believe me if I told you I just had the best sex of my life with Draco Malfoy?”
“Draco,” Harry says. This isn’t how he has dreamt of first using that name, but it is the only one that will do. “Dumbledore had the most powerful wand in the world. The one Voldemort was after. When you didn’t kill Dumbledore, and you disarmed him, you mastered his wand. When you didn’t kill me, and I disarmed you, that’s how I became its master. That’s the only reason I had the power to defeat him in the end. These things you didn’t do – they’re as important as anything I did. You were as important in the war as me, or as Dumbledore for that matter. As important as Hermione and Ron and Snape.”
When it has just crossed Harry’s dazed mind that this might be over way too soon, Malfoy lets go with a flourish, leaving Harry’s flushed cock to bounce up and down obscenely. They stare at each other. Malfoy’s eyes are piercing and sharp; they make Harry uncomfortable.
Malfoy doesn’t seem inclined to let him resolve his confusion. He returns his hands to Harry’s waist, slipping below his t-shirt, rubbing at the dip above his hipbones like he is going to reach into Harry’s pants, but he doesn’t. He tugs at Harry’s shirt instead, and Harry lets him pull it over his head and throw it over his wand on the chair. While he shudders at the cool touch of Malfoy’s hands on his bare skin, the blond looks him up and down appraisingly.
The Slytherins have completely normal jobs – which is somehow surprising, even though Harry should know these things already. But it becomes more real, more personal, when he hears about the things they do every day, how they sell things, make things, how they teach and heal. When he sees the pictures of their children, their spouses, their gardens and the flowers they grow. Somewhere in between all of that, a lot of the old animosity is lost. He doesn’t miss it.
He hasn’t seen Malfoy laugh like this in a long, long time, Harry realizes as he watches the man’s hard eyes glitter and his pale skin crinkle. There wasn’t much cause for laughter after their fourth year or so.
Malfoy stares at him for several seconds, visibly recovering his composure. Eventually his posture relaxes and his face smooths out. “I was
Harry grins. “Loyal to a friend, regardless of casualties or privacy?” He says, as he slips back into his jeans. “Rather Slytherin, I would say.”
How do you look back at someone for the first time since the aftermath of a battle in which you fought on opposite sides? And what if since that day you have spent whole nights dancing, fighting, flying with him in your head?
In that instant he understands – a piece of it all, at least. This. This exact feeling, this … humiliation, this is what he came for tonight. Why he sought out Malfoy. He wasn’t looking for reciprocity, he wasn’t looking for understanding or comfort, and not at all for political reconciliation. He was looking for this. To have Malfoy take his dirty secret and taunt him with it. Those laughing eyes, those words, they feel like winter air searing his lungs after a reckless run. A deep, intimate hurt, but one that he needed. They seem to open him up where he’s been locked too tight, to lift some weight from his shoulders in a way that he can’t explain or justify. Except that he knows this feeling, can come home to it: Prickling under Draco Malfoy’s leer.
The first breath he draws comes as a belated, shuddering gasp that speaks as clearly as he possibly could of how he feels. How he’s been feeling this whole time. Malfoy doesn’t heed it. He pushes a hand into Harry’s unruly hair, up the back of his head, and pulls a bit to gain access to the other side of Harry’s neck, where he resumes his slow, sensual kissing. His other hand is moving up and down Harry’s waist, long fingers teasing in a way that makes Harry’s insides tighten.
Harry shudders, and knows Malfoy is thinking the same as him even before the blond adds, “Let them know who’s fucking the Chosen One.”
at that. Malfoy’s hand on his cock stills as his orgasm overtakes him, and Harry grabs his own dick instead and pulls it exactly like he needs it to come, and in four, five seconds he is shooting again, and then they lie slumped together covered in semen, and neither of them speaks for a long time.
used to fancy a Death Eater. And he is standing here telling him about it, in front of everyone – seemingly without a care about the politics of it all, about the implications. He can see the headlines that this story will make in the tabloids, and in a detached Hermione voice he can even kind of see the positive impact such a story might have.
“I get that,” He whispers, and Harry struggles to understand because he feels that there is something important about this, but he can’t follow, can barely remember what they were talking about. Malfoy is stroking him slowly like before, but the delicious sensation of Malfoy’s cock in him, combined with the blond’s precome-slickened grip on his member, is quickly building up to a new level of urgency, evident in the way his thighs have started twitching and his eyes are falling shut. He doesn’t think he’s going to last much longer.
Throughout his whole speech, he has refused to let Draco look away, imploring him with the intensity of his gaze. It gives him full view of the unraveling behind the other’s eyes as he listens, visibly hanging on Harry’s every word. By the end of it, two tears are gliding down Draco’s face, and the fact that he doesn’t wipe them away is almost more disturbing than to see him cry in the first place. He continues to stare at Harry, caught in a rigid position, as if he’d been turned to stone.
“Aren’t you going to get mad?” He asks. And – just to be a little shit as usual, Harry assumes – punctuates his words with another deep thrust that has Harry groaning.
Draco hasn’t stirred out of his chair. He is regarding Harry with a look of amazement. “Yeah,” He says, sounding stunned. “Okay.”
Harry’s reply is lost when Malfoy hits his target, once again not wasting any time. An eruption of pleasure mixes with the warm and pleasant feeling, drawing a high-pitched, uninhibited moan from Harry. Immediately Malfoy doubles down on the spot, rubbing his fingertip gently but insistently against it, and Harry all but shouts from the pleasure, grabbing the sheets.
Harry finds it difficult to reply because he hasn’t got a clue if she has heard the news yet. Does she think he’s off to duel Malfoy in a back alley, or to engage in inappropriate displays of affection?
He floats for a while, surrendering entirely to Malfoy’s movements, but the way the other man hisses and gasps above him, the way he holds on to Harry’s shoulders and grimaces into his neck, starts working him up again almost without him really noticing, and before he knows it – he couldn’t guess even vaguely how much time has passed – heat is building up in his lower body again.
Harry should deny it, of course, but he can’t figure out the appropriate tone between furious and cool. Doesn’t believe he can pull it off without making a fool of himself, because surely his voice will shudder, his eyes will twitch, his neck will tense, surely he will misspeak and then it will only make things worse. Then Malfoy will win. He’s developed a keen instinct over the years for not letting bullies win, and it’s hard to shed.
you?!” Hermione cries when Harry re-enters the party room. It’s empty but for her and Ron, who is snoring with his head on the bar. A trash can is rumbling through the place, munching up anything it can find, and a mountain of glassware behind the bar is polishing itself. “Are you okay?” Her eyes give him a once-over, making him acutely aware of his probably disheveled state.
,” He exclaims, raises his hand to partially cover his mouth, “I was joking! You seriously fancied me?”
A long, whining moan tears free of Harry’s throat, lengthening his torso as he grinds down on Malfoy’s cock. “Like what,” He whispers, with his eyes still closed, but then opens them in time to see a shadow of Malfoy’s evil grin ghost over his features. It pins him down into the mattress, that smile and those grey, grey eyes; his legs tremble and he chokes out another moan.
But he and Malfoy just stare at each other, and something else is going on between them. Something that has been simmering for thirteen years.
For some reason, this makes anger rise in his chest. “You two do remember that we saved each other’s lives, right?” Their looks of surprise make his voice swell even louder. “I dragged the guy out of the fucking Fiendfyre. Then we won the goddamn war. Maybe our little feud is a little outdated, don’t you think?”
Naturally there is some tension, as the crowd of them gathers in a magical pub out of London. But everyone who showed up – which is, surprisingly, almost everyone who survived – seems willing to jump over their own shadow a bit and at least … cooperate. Alcohol comes into play, and loosens tongues and smiles.
He almost wishes somebody would suggest they drink veritaserum – like they did sometimes at Hogwarts, just a tiny dose of it for everyone playing spin the wand to spare the costly liquid as long as possible – so that he could say it. But of course, the ice is too thin for veritaserum tonight. Everybody is biting back things they shouldn’t say. So he bites his tongue.
“Thanks anyway,” He says finally, lamely. Malfoy, who has been staring ahead with a sick expression on his face, looks over in evident confusion. “For saving me.”
, too. All the wizarding world will know tomorrow, probably. Harry doesn’t care right now. He feels addicted to this moment, wants to draw it out. He may never feel so alive again.
At least it surprises Malfoy, gives Harry the briefest look behind his outward appearance. If he were pressed to name the look that passes over the other man’s features, he would call it apprehension.
He pushes Harry onto his back. He’s slipped out of all his clothes except for a fine black dress shirt that hangs from his shoulders unbuttoned. The sight of him like that, half-hidden by deep shadows and half illuminated by the red glow of the embers, is simply too much for Harry to process. The former Gryffindor is beginning to feel like he’s tripping, like reality is unraveling around him and coming back together in the most unlikely shapes.
“He was a person,” Harry says. He isn’t sure at all why he is telling Malfoy this, but the words just stream out of his mouth. “Dumbledore … took me to his past. Through memories in a pensieve. He showed me Voldemort’s childhood. I saw his mother, his father, what they were like. What he went through. I saw him as a kid at Hogwarts, understood what he wanted back then. How he became the way he was in the end. But I killed him anyway.”
After a second of silence, Malfoy raises his glass to Harry in a half-ironic gesture, then downs all of its contents. Harry follows suit. People begin to breathe again. Slowly, a new conversation stutters into existence.
.” He mockingly motions down his body – clad in gorgeous, shimmering robes. His eyes blaze at Harry in that provocative way he knows so well. Daring the other to react. Challenging him.
Harry stares. He can’t form a response. He doesn’t understand if this is a joke, or a dream, or an alcohol-induced illusion. An incredibly good-looking illusion.
“I didn’t,” Malfoy says. He makes an angry movement with his hands, stops in mid-air, rearranges himself. After a pause, he adds, now sounding eerily emotionless, “It had nothing to do with feelings. Killing you“ – he pauses there – “Handing you over to him would have ended the war. He would have won.”
Harry does, although he feels rather silly about it. He’s second-guessing himself, wondering if this is a practical joke after all, if Malfoy is about to jump up and pull the curtains on
As fucking usual when he gets his temper up, he notices too late that he has spoken too loudly. Several people nearby have turned around and fallen silent. Harry winces and avoids eye contact.
With his back to the wall, Harry knows only one way to rise to the challenge: Shift the battlefield. If he acts like it’s no big deal, maybe he can defeat Malfoy with maturity. Make him look like the silly one for being a dick about this.
“Can’t believe the golden boy of Gryffindor is letting me do this to him,” He rasps. When Harry doesn’t react, except by tilting his head back and exhaling audibly, he squints at the man beneath him almost dangerously.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Somebody asks, incredulous but transparently greedy for a good story. And Malfoy says, “Oh please, did you see all those looks he was always giving me? How he asked people about what I was doing all the time? The guy couldn’t let me walk around two corners unshadowed. He really wanted some of
In the months and weeks leading up to the event, Harry pretends that he’s going to attend for political reasons. He nods to all of Hermione’s talking points about unity, about rebuilding a better world, about societal cohesion. And it’s not like she hasn’t got a point. As an Auror, Harry is more than aware that they can’t go chasing all the members of the old dark magic families until none are left. They must be reintegrated into ordinary society, and one obvious way to do that is reunions just like this.
He’s torn out of his trance when Malfoy speaks again, close to his ear: “So you will like hearing how much I get off on seeing you like this.”
Malfoy withdraws, and Harry is left feeling wrecked, shaking, panting. “Interesting,” Malfoy drawls.
He starts panting Harry’s name, his full name, in escalating pitch, and then he screams wordlessly and his dick starts pumping in Harry’s ass and Harry just-
Like the show-off that he is, Malfoy reaches out slowly, dramatically. He closes his hand around Harry’s member and draws it first up an inch, then down far enough to slide the foreskin off the tip, all with one elegant twist of his pale wrist. The whole time he keeps his eyes fixed on Harry’s face, watching for his reaction. Harry senses that this is a test of some kind, and struggles to keep his features neutral, his breath even, to keep his body from curling.
Gripping Harry’s hips with one hand and his own member with the other, Malfoy starts pushing into Harry’s ass, making slow but steady progress. Just like before, the potion smooths away any pain or discomfort, leaving only the maddening sensation of Draco Malfoy’s cock moving inside him. And there’s so much of it; inch by inch it fills him up, until he’s ready to burst with the pressure of it, but in the best possible way.
Exhaling, he prepares himself for an ungentle invasion, but the fingertip that probes at his anus is soft and warm and accompanied by an incredibly comfortable feeling. Something like warmth spreads out from the place where Malfoy is applying the potion, easing Harry’s tension and preparing the way for Malfoy’s finger to slide smoothly and painlessly inside him. It feels so good, so easy, that Harry
This time Malfoy comes down to him, bowing his head to stay close to Harry’s. He does something to the place where Harry’s neck meets his shoulder, something between a kiss and a bite, and reaches down to wrap his hand around Harry’s cock again.
It must have been terrifying to be a Death Eater during the war, Harry realizes. He’s never really thought about it before, not this vividly. How it must have been for a boy to be surrounded by what he at first assumed were friends of the family, but soon understood were torturers and murderers. How it must have felt for young Draco Malfoy when his family fell from the favor of the most powerful dark wizard of all. When he learned first hand what this man was willing to do to his followers just as readily as his enemies.
” Harry groans, loudly, recklessly, dropping his head and elbows to the mattress. Small helpless noises shake his chest, between sobs and shredded breaths. He lets himself go, lets his hips grind back on Malfoy’s finger, his face twist in a grimace of lust.
It’s the best feeling in the world, the best he’s ever felt; everything is pleasure and nothing matters. Malfoy’s dick is still buried in his ass, Malfoy’s actual body still on top of him. He’s heavier now that the tension has dissipated from Harry’s muscles, except for the aftershocks that rock through him irregularly, clashing with Malfoy’s thrusts as the blond picks them up again, saying “I always knew you didn’t have discipline. But that doesn’t mean I can’t take my time.”
Despite an involuntary shiver at those words, Harry stares at the vial with deep suspicion, prompting Malfoy to roll his eyes. “Don’t worry, Potter, it’s safe. It’s not like I knew when I brewed this that I’d be using it on
He knows Malfoy must be able to feel that he’s hard, from just a bit of kissing, and the sting of it shoots through him. But Malfoy ignores his dick for now, slides his hands down Harry’s backside instead to grope his ass. From there, his teasing fingers slip down and around, until the fingertips are ghosting over Harry’s perineum and nudging at his balls, which makes Harry flinch and yelp. It’s so intimate, so suddenly, his brain isn’t keeping up with it all.
Harry spends a lot of time consciously not looking at Malfoy. But the entire time he is anxious for a chance to be near him. He inserts himself into a group standing next to Malfoy’s group, stands there for ages, making small talk he doesn’t really care for, until finally, someone turns around and makes a comment to someone in the next group, and the groups sort of, kind of, merge and form a lump in which Malfoy is forced to look up and look Harry in the eye.
“I never killed anyone,” Malfoy murmurs after a moment, quietly, as if speaking to himself, but it’s evident that he’s talking to Harry. Needing him to know this. It shouldn’t be a question, but Harry is disgustingly dizzied with relief.
He has been dreaming about Malfoy. A lot. Almost every week now. Sometimes they make up in the dreams, sometimes they are old friends who don’t even need to. Sometimes they meet in the war. Sometimes they meet in a Muggle nightclub, and they’re about to have steaming hot sex, but then Harry wakes up. More often than not when this happens, he gets himself off and wonders what the hell is wrong with him.
So Harry continues to sit in silence too. He thinks of all the things Malfoy could say; dozens pass through his head. Hermione eyes them from across the room, and he tries to look at her and not look her in a way that will hopefully keep her from coming over to check on him. He would do anything not to interrupt Malfoy right now. In this space of silence, while Malfoy hasn’t spoken, it feels like all of Harry’s dreams are possible. This could be a moment out of any of them.
, he wants to ask, but doesn’t, because it feels like surrendering and he can’t do that again. He’s just done so much of it.
He makes Harry beg for it, in such jumbled, whining sentences as the black haired man can form. All the while he’s thrusting himself between Harry’s cheeks, and he’s considerably faster now than he was before, quite obviously getting off on Harry’s words. When he’s finally satisfied with Harry’s begging, he pushes Harry’s head into the mattress, face turned to the side, and starts jerking him off at the same time as he’s fucking him faster and faster.
And maybe that’s what it was always about. Maybe the dreams are no more than a need to revisit a place he’s spent so much of his youth in. And maybe even the reason he fell for Malfoy in the first place was already this: He was a traumatized child beginning to experience a scary new world of feelings, and everybody else that he could have liked at Hogwarts might have actually returned his affection. Might have gone out with him, at least, because he was after all the bloody boy who lived. But not Malfoy. Malfoy was reliable in that way. The anticipated humiliation of him ever finding out kept Harry safe from ever having to disclose any of his feelings, to anyone. It was an obsession that played out purely in his mind. And in that way, it could remain intact for years and years, could grow with them as they turned from children into teenagers and into young adults. Could survive the debacle with Cho, which in contrast seemed so much less risky. So much less that Harry was able to court her eventually, because as scary as that was, there was a bigger secret he was still hiding, that nothing she could do would touch. An icicle that protected him from burning.
Embarrassment turns to bile in Harry’s throat, and he awkwardly tosses Malfoy’s wand back at him, mumbling “Sorry. Professional habit.”
But privately, he mostly thinks about how Malfoy will be there. Might be there, he should say, because he shouldn’t know it, but he does; he checked Hermione’s notes one night when she was crashing at his place. Malfoy rsvp’d. Harry barely slept that night.
Malfoy withdraws, then rather unexpectedly pushes Harry toward the bed and down onto the duvet. He crawls on top of him and kisses his mouth again, small hard kisses sucking forcefully on Harry’s bottom lip. His weight pressing Harry into the mattress is a shard of real-ness helping Harry make sense of what is happening. Maybe fucking Malfoy can be like doing it with any other bloke, relying on instinct to go through the script. It makes Harry feel a little more in control, helps him not to lose his shit when Malfoy drags down Harry’s jeans and throws them irretrievably off the bed, and then when his shorts follow suit, revealing precisely how eager Harry is for this.
‘Oh no Harry you did not’ Hermione looked rather shocked, Ron seemed not to understand what she was talking about, ‘please tell me that us not talking you out of it did not lead you to talking to Draco about, or Merlin forbid... actually accusing that poor boy of being a... of being a werewolf’ she hissed the last point in a whispered voice so as to not gain attention from the classmates that were around them.
‘Coconut water... huh I never would have known’ he said giving a nod, ‘so uh... how did it happen, you weren’t born like that were you? N-not that there would be anything wrong with that I just never would have guessed if you were’
Harry waited outside his dorm room that night for Draco, they had planned to meet but the boy was nowhere to be seen much to his disappointment. He decided it best to walk, hoping the boy would find him but the further he walked from the castle and the longer he walked on his own he felt slightly isolated in the cold of the night. As he walked further, he heard a noise coming from further in the distance and thought it might be Draco playing a game with him and so he decided it best to play along following the direction the noise had come from. As he walked further, he realized the noise he had heard was coming from the forbidden forest, but he supposed the danger might be a part of the fun for him and so saw no reason not to go into the forest anyway.
Harry's smile turns sharp; he can feel it. "I've been taking lessons from you these past four years, you see."
, he’s not gonna use Malfoy’s word, and anyway, the thing is Harry is quite sure that Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, however disgusting and bigoted they are in general, must treat Draco something like how Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon treat Dudley— that is to say, he’s surely not
"It'll be alright. You and Ted are different, it's true, but you're both good lads. He wouldn't have broken it off with Victoire if he wasn't, I don't think," says Harry.
Malfoy does a slow exhale and an even slower smooth turn back around. His expression looks strangely calmer than it did a moment ago. He looks just about the same as he always has done otherwise, all angles and paleness. "Well you see, Potter…" he says, drawing it out, "being alone with you in the gents', as you call it, went
that siphons the water from his skin, drying his hands. Then he squares up and finds Malfoy doing the same. “I didn’t mean to slice you up then, which you bloody well know,” he says. “But if you’re wanting a fight...”
Harry calls his bluff, putting his hands up. “Fine, I’ll just go let my godfather know you’re training for some mysterious fight. I’m sure the Order won’t think it could possibly be against them or anything, that you’re not some sort of ferret- sorry, I mean
Once upon a time, James might have blown off such a question; it’s always been a delicate subject, Teddy. There were a few years there when James had feigned indifference, rivalry, teenaged scorn even, towards Teddy Lupin. And Teddy had ignored him right back, particularly in favor of the more age-appropriate, more interesting company (during those years at least) of Victoire Weasley. But James has gotten more serious, more mature after spending the summer hols at home after his last year at Hogwarts. He’d turned seventeen just in time for final exams, the youngest in his year, and been unable to go in on a holiday flat with his friends as he hadn’t been of age to sign the contract.
The sigh that James heaves is heavier than what Harry is used to. It's odd. His children have only known peacetime, all of them, but the way James has been this summer reminds Harry of nothing so much as that last awful, tense year when everyone had felt isolated even amongst each other.
Something warm and pleased runs through Harry at the prospect of being mistaken for his son. It's a nice bit of flattery, at his age. But, no, James hadn't told him. Perhaps he'd been embarrassed to be breaking up again; Harry's son has a long history of serial monogamy, with most of his relationships ending nastily.
Inside, however, Harry is bemused. He knows for a fact that Ginny isn’t seeing Malfoy. For one, she’s not a prat like that. For another, everyone and their mum—except perhaps Ron—knows that she has a thing for Michael Corner. To be frank, even Ron knows… he just hasn’t accepted it yet, Hermione says.
Sighing, Harry picks himself up from his seat near Ron and Hermione and heads over to the nicer couch that Sirius has taken over; he and Lupin share the large ottoman that goes with Lupin's armchair, their feet nearly touching.
