“I’m not uncomfortable working with you!” Harry exclaimed, feeling extremely guilty at the accusation, “I don’t want you to think that.”
“I’m still worried about her showing up at our house,” Harry murmured, “She’s a monster. I know Ginny and the kids are purebloods, but what if she decides to kill them anyway?”
“Yes. I even told Ron that, but he seemed to think assembling a makeshift Order of the Phoenix was not what we needed at the moment. He told me to stick to the plan and not put anymore people into danger,” Draco said sullenly.
“You’re right,” Harry grasped Seb’s arm, “People who love more than one gender feel like they have the choice to hide behind a heterosexual relationship, regardless of how real that relationship may be. You need to tell your story at the protest. It’s not okay to hide any part of yourself, because it will slowly kill you inside.”
Harry opened his eyes, his vision blurred as he tried to figure out where he was. He realized he was lying down on something hard, but he couldn’t place where. The room was so bright, he had trouble focusing on anything other than the lights overhead. Harry attempted to move his arms to try and lever himself off the ground, but to his shock, he had no control over his own body. It dawned on him that his whole body was immobile, which could only be the work of a Petrificus Totalus charm. Despite this, he continued to try and move but nothing happened. He was stuck on the ground, unable to make a sound or figure out his surroundings.
But Harry was still looking at the picture of the quidditch pitch. As Ida reached for it, Harry bent down and grabbed it.
“But you have to take it easy. I saw some of your visitors yesterday. If that’s a hospital visit for them, I can’t imagine regular day to day activities are calm and collected,” Mateh said.
“I think so,” Harry answered. He took his last bite of pie and stood up, “I’ll go ‘n see what he wants.”
“We didn’t know who information was being spread to before, but now we do! We know Ida and Aries are working together. All we need to do is find a way for Ida to have to go to Aries. Once she has a reason to talk to her cousin, she’ll want to talk to him about everything that has happened,” Draco explained.
As the music of Lavender and Parvati’s first dance came to an end, a classic Twisted Sisters song began playing.
“I have something I need to say,” Ginny stated, the small waver in her voice the only thing giving away the fact that she desperately did not want to have this conversation, “Something I’ve needed to say then longer than I’d like to admit.”
“Don’t start with me!” Ginny snapped, “I’m just as mad at you as I am Harry! And Ida! And my own fucking brother, who did the interrogation along with Padma and Ida! I can’t believe two of the people I count on most in the world would go behind my back and put my boyfriend on trial for something he would never do!”
He stuck his face in and was surprised to see the lights were still on. He looked around and spotted Ida sitting on the floor, papers stretched out around her. She was casting charms that created streaks of light across the papers.
“It’s true,” Seamus confirmed. He leaned in to whisper to Harry, “And, we have decided that we are going to try and adopt. We are treating this extreme misfortune as a blessing in disguise. I mean, it would be amazing to give a kid born into an unfortunate life a good home.”
Ron sobbed harder at this. Harry gripped his friend’s arm and tried to get Ron to look him in the eye.
Harry knew it. All this time, Draco was right. He had been the only one to truly see what Kareach was and the threat it held. Now, because of that, he would pay the price.
“Ida, we will take Harry’s statement after he sees Dean. He deserves to see he’s alright for himself,” Ron turned to Aviary, “Av, could you and Remmins take his statement? Since Youll is out of commission, he’ll need someone to take the statement with him.”
“It’s just a hobby,” Draco snapped, but Harry could tell it meant more to him than he was letting on, “And it’s not a hobby I do not plan to share with anyone, especially you!”
“So what happened?” Harry asked, now highly intrigued in what derailed Malfoy’s investigative career. Now that Harry thought about it, Malfoy had written many of the articles the Prophet received praise for for being above the superficial and altered stories that had once defined it. Although Harry had never worked with Malfoy when he was an Auror, he now recalled some of his colleagues working with Malfoy to see what he had uncovered. Hannah Abbot had gotten useful information about a drug ring from Malfoy. At the time, Harry thought it was easier to blame the eventual spell damage Hannah suffered from due to the fact she went into the place Malfoy thought held the drug ring alone. Harry now realized that Malfoy had given Hannah crucial information that no one really took seriously due to his past reputation. He felt a sudden pang of guilt at this realization. Maybe doubts like his and Hannah’s was what was costing Malofy his job now.
Aviary turned to Harry, “So this is why you were so upset the night we told you Kareach wasn’t real?”
“It's part of my charm,” Harry quipped, taking a long swing of his coffee and grinning at Malfoy, “Let’s get to work!”
“Harry, I can’t stop thinking about that. I feel like… a bad person! But Blaise…” she paused awkwardly, looking away.
With that, Draco began to carefully explain Chann to Dean and Seamus, being compassionate and comforting with each word. Harry tried not to admire this nurturing side of
“I can't believe it…” Harry said, pulling his daughter close to him in a moment of excitement, “I can’t believe it! I’m okay!”
The Healer who was sitting across from Harry (he thought her name was Mary) sent Dean a quick look and he stopped talking about the attacks. Harry knew that the Third and Fourth floors were most likely under strict secrecy to the findings on the mysterious attacks, so he opted to stop pushing for answers. He would know soon enough if either the Aurors or healers figured out what the poison was.
Padma gave a stiff nod, “Ron’s right, Harry. We can’t morally put Malfoy into this much danger. Technically, we shouldn’t involve you either. You aren’t an Auror anymore.”
“Not at all,” Scorpius piped up, “I was just going to tell him more about my favorite magical creatures.”
Harry smiled back; this man’s sense of humor immediately reminded of him of Fred and George's, who managed to make a joke out of everything, as they had always refused to believe laughter couldn’t solve anything.
“It was supposed to be,” Angelina agreed, collapsing into the couch, “But Oliver insisted we take advantage of the weather and get some extra practicing time in.”
“No,” Harry spoke as Molly shot him a warning look, “no worries, Molly, I have no more information than you or Bill. But,” he reassured, “Uncle Ron, Padma and Ida all said they are working hard to stop these terrible people. There is no reason to worry.”
“I love you all, too,” Ginny said from the doorway, “But I need to get to the pitch!” she turned to look at Harry, “You have a study thing today, right?”
Harry looked closer; sure enough, the man was not Zabini. His build wasn’t as lean and his smile wasn’t as kind. Harry wondered absently when he had begun to think of Zabini’s smile as kind.
Seamus sent Dean a half-hearted glare as Parvati exclaimed, “What gossip chain? I’ve been missing out on Ministry gossip for years. The Department of Magical Transportation has next to nothing interesting going on.”
“Well, we hope that between us, Nott, Harris, Blueskin, Finch-Fletchley, Reyes and her new partner, we can get a task force together and figure out the best way to tackle this,” Ron looked down at his cluttered desk, “In the meantime, we’ll do the rounds of paperwork that come with a muggle attack. Really, Harry, you may have had the right idea getting out of this madness.”
Padma and Ida began to laugh at this, but Harry barely heard them. The man had just turned around. The beanie had obscured a key feature to this man’s physique. He had platinum blond hair that stuck out in pieces from under the beanie. When piercing blue eyes caught Harry’s own, he acted without thinking and apparated into his kitchen, breathing heavily as he landed next to Ginny and his kids playing ‘Sorry’ at  the dining room table.
“No time. You have a statement to give, I have so many things to do that I can’t waste another second. Go to the first interrogation room. Aviary should be in there now, ready to take your statement.”
“You,” she said in her shrill voice, “Look exactly like the respectable man my dear niece Narcissa married. You must be little Draco!”
“I trusted her!” Harry screamed, “With my life! She was one of my best friends! I told her things that I haven’t told anyone. I thought I knew her!”
“Don’t you dare start,” Aviary threatened, “I don’t fucking care if I’m in danger. It sounds like Draco is in just as much danger as me, and he’s still going. I am doing this for Gani. I appreciate you taking me here, Harry, I really do. But I need to be there, wherever there is. I need to fight for him.”
“Draco,” she wrapped her hand around his wrist, “Is this a situation where I need to be ready to hex? Because I’m pretty pissed but I can try…” she trailed off as an attractive woman with long silky hair and a short dress beckoned to her.
Harry shook his head, “Ida, what in the world are you saying? You’ve always told me that you will never do what your parents want, that you are your own person. Now you’re saying Draco isn’t able to make his own decisions?”
“Oh Harry, what is it? Is Hermione okay?” Seamus asked. He looked guilty about accusing Harry a moment ago.
Although Ginny sounded angry, the telltale signs in her voice told Harry she was on the verge of tears. Though they both knew Ron was in the wrong, the things he had said stung.
“That doesn’t matter,” Harry said, “You’re a pureblood too and you would never do anything like this. They are all like you, Ron. I know they are.”
“Sometime this morning,” Brayan said, “For someone who hasn’t slept in almost forty eight hours, he is a very good conversationalist.”
Harry found himself nodding although the last thing he wanted to do was go in and see Ron and Padma again. But he followed Ginny into the house without another word, because it was Christmas Eve. He couldn’t miss spending that with his family, no matter how frustrated he was.”
Rose and Hermione left (Ron had left hours ago, claiming a stomach ache), leaving Ginny and Harry standing alone in their entry hall. The silence that fell over them after the noisy affair that was Christmas Eve felt suffocating. All Harry could focus on was the gaping hole in their marriage, the one that told him they were missing something Harry never knew they needed. Something Harry thought wasn’t possible. Something that Draco made him feel every damn time he talked to him.
“Thank goodness you are here!” Blaise said, “If I had to spend another moment with Draco here, I was going to lose my mind!’
Hermione looked at Ron with tears in her eyes, “I know what you mean. When Padma sent owls to everyone, letting them know what was going on at the Ministry, I felt like I was back at Hogwarts. When we never really knew if each day would be our last.”
Draco stood frozen, his eyes wide. As Harry realized what he had said, a large blush began to spread across his face. He turned away and began to move toward the door.
Ida nodded, sorrow enrapturing her features, “It’s true. This was the most vicious attack we’ve had yet.”
“Just one thing, Harry,” Ron argued sheepishly, “We think it’s safer if we remove Malfoy from this case.”
“Well, thanks for that,” Harry muttered, trying not to laugh himself, “Now just tell me about the stakeout.”
Harry made his way back to the sitting room, where all of the guests had congregated. He sat down next to Louis and Ida and began a conversation about his favorite spells . Thankfully, no one seemed to be interested in asking Harry, Ron or Padma about Harry’s outburst earlier, allowing Harry to slip into the conversation. Harry was just explaining why he liked Expelliarmus best with an unwavering passion when Seamus stood up and began tapping a spoon against his wine glass to get the room’s attention.
Draco nodded, “Yeah. Women who are already pregnant aren’t infected. The poison has no effect on already partially developed babies.”
Harry just nodded as Draco paced the room. He was running one hand through his hair with an anxiousness Harry had never witnessed from him. He was eager, angry, beyond determined. Whatever he had found out was big.
“Then stop drinking it, you prick,” Seb yanked the bottle across the bar and towards himself, “I knew you wouldn’t like it. You’re picky.”
Ron nodded. Harry wondered what he was thinking, whether he was still mad at Harry for being Draco’s friend.
Draco must have realized what he was thinking again, because he said softly, “You’re the only one I can talk about this stuff still,” he continued, more animate now, “Anyway, I was able to trace a package of Chann that was sent to the Puddlemere team!”
“And please,” the patient continued, the ridiculous smile now back upon his face, “Do call me Seb. Mr. Haffer is my father, the git.”
“I’m beyond drunk so I’m going to regret saying any of this to you. But I’m going to, because I have no one else to talk to and I’m fed up. And fucking angry,” he hesitated and looked around, then leaned in close to Harry. He could smell a strong scent of vanilla and what he thought was coconut.
Harry shuffled awkwardly, “I didn’t think non-work talk meant diving into my relationship. You do know I’m still married, correct?”
Harry’s whole body seemed to thrive with the effort of trying to fight his non visible constraint. This was the worst form of torture, and he could tell Ida knew that. She knew all along that Harry liked Draco and that they were working together. He had told her he was gay before almost anyone. He had trusted her to understand everything he was going through. And now… now he was watching her torture the man he loved.
“No,” Draco answered pointedly, “I sent my best friend and the man you accused of genocide to your house to keep your ex-wife company.”
“Lily Luna, don’t hit,” Harry reprimanded. He looked up at James and sighed, “Just let her walk for now. There’s no use in carrying her if she’s going to fight you the entire time.”
Deciding to distract himself, he asked Blaise, “What happened to your arm? I didn’t get any of the story from Reyes.”
Ginny pulled a face and moved to say hi to Angelina and her father. Harry did the same, as Lily, Albus and James joined the group on the floor. Within seconds, Rose and Albus sprang to their feet and were off towards the backdoor. Harry knew what they were doing; Molly had wanted someone to de-gnome the garden, and he knew Al and Rose would volunteer. The two had taken to playing the game Harry had once played with Ron and his siblings while de-gnoming the garden, that being swinging the gnomes around and seeing how far they could throw them. Rose and Al had taken the game to the next level. They had made makeshift quidditch hoops that they would set up at various distances from the garden for different amounts of points. Harry admired the two’s ability to make a game out of anything; they had been making up games as a pair ever since they could walk. If Harry had thought he, Ron and Hermione were inseparable, he had thought wrong. Rose and Al were never not together if they could help it.
Harry gave him a quizzical look, “Ron, it isn’t your fault. You and the rest of the Aurors did everything you could.”
“Sorry I’m late!” Angelina's words rang out from the other room, tearing Harry’s eyes away from the confusing Twister game unfolding in his living room.
“My thoughts exactly,” Ron agreed, “I know in my gut that Savant, Ida and Padma are innocent. I’ve known them all for so long. I’ve seen them give up so much of their time and energy to fight against these attacks and so many other incidents just like them. There is no way they were involved. Even if they are all purebloods.”
“And you only used them on me because I won Charades!” Fred argued, “Otherwise it would make no sense to Sorry me! James has been winning this whole time!”
“Not to mention your kid naming skills,” Malfoy continued, “No originality whatsoever. How Weasley put up with that, I have no idea.”
“And that’s why Marvin lost half the badges last week,” Harry returned to Seb’s voice in time to hear the end of what he supposed was a story. He groaned inwardly, Seb was raising his eyebrows in a mock offense. He knew Harry hadn’t been listening.
“How fucking naive are you?” Ginny denounced, glaring straight into his eyes, “Blaise is an ex-Slytherin who was known for being associated with Death Eaters. And before you tell that’s even more proof he was guilty, we both know it’s not! Unless, of course, you think your little gay crush did this too! No, you only think it’s Blaise. Because he had a human moment and slept with me. Because he’s Draco’s best friend and Draco would rather spend time with him than you!”
“Who are you rooting for, Uncle Bill?” James demanded after he pulled back from a hug with his uncle.
“Yeah,” Ginny said, easing up a bit on the intensity in her voice, “Although, I have to say, you don’t seem all that surprised. Especially if you just found out,” she looked at Harry, “Is there any reason for that?”
Darius wiped the tears from his face, “Well, at least she went the one way she would have wanted. Fighting to protect others.”
Harry shook his head, “How on earth are you this perceptive? I was never this smart at your age. You are only ten!”
Draco obliged half-heartedly by letting Harry pull him away. The light streaming from the cracks in the stands made Draco’s face look mysterious and almost regal in the half-darkness, making Harry’s stomach do an unhelpful turn that distracted him from their conversation. Draco looked momentarily caught off guard. He stared at Harry for a second, then shook his head in anger.
Lacey gave him a wave over the heads of numerous Healers as Harry made his way out of line and looked hopefully for Dean’s face among the crowd. Being significantly older than his fellow trainees, Harry had yet to make a lasting connection with any of them that correlated to sharing a meal in the canteen. He had taken to eating lunch with Dean and his friends, but it was hard to anticipate when and if Dean had a break. Although Dean worked on the Fourth Floor in the Janus Thickey Ward, Harry knew he had been on call due to the long-lasting inflictions of the poison the Muggles had been infected with. The Janus Thickey Ward dealt with long-term patients that had suffered curses and spells that left irreversible damage, so Dean and his co-workers knew how to alleviate long-lasting effects. To Harry’s pleasant surprise, he spotted Dean with some of the fellow JT Ward workers, laughing over his own chicken pot pie.
Harry couldn't help it; he let out a loud giggle at this. Malfoy leered at him for a moment, then broke out into a small laugh that grew as Harry continued to laugh. Soon, they were both laughing uncontrollably, and only stopped when the bartender shot them an annoyed look. Malfoy took a breath to control his laughter, then turned to Harry,
“We are going to be entrusting them with a serious investigation,” Draco huffed in response, “I think I could start using their first names. Maybe not in front of them, though. Not if it’ll get this reaction.”
“We need to talk about this another time,” Ginny said stiffly. She reached for Albus and Lily and gestured for James to grab the floo powder, “Now’s clearly not a good time.”
Rachel nodded, “That I understand. We just miss you around here, Harry. And you were among the best. Not that Ron, Padma, Nott, Reyes and the rest aren’t good!” she exclaimed, “You were just really great!”
“Well, he is the offspring of Harry Potter,” Draco said, “And if anyone has nerve, it’s you. I’m not saying this as a compliment, though, simply a fact.”
“Wait!” she blurted. Harry stopped and turned around reluctantly, already knowing what she was going to ask.
“It has to be! My mother and father always talked about how Voldemort suspected the Order was using a former Black residence as the headquarters. They were so upset… talked about how it was a disgrace on the family name…” Draco trailed off as he looked around more. He spotted the portrait of Sirius’s mother on the wall, covered in the drapings that were always left in front of it.
“This is one of my favorites!” Aviary said giddily. She grabbed Seb by the hand and led him onto the dance floor.
Harry, Arthur and Bill laughed at this. Only a few hours after his talk with Ginny, he was once again at the Burrow for Sunday lunch. They were all waiting to eat, with Ron and Hermione pulling the bulk of the preparation as they had been absent from numerous lunches due to their jobs. This gave Harry the opportunity to catch up with everyone. He had just finished learning about Louis’s first time using magic accidentally, which had drawn the entire family’s attention to Louis, resulting in him leaving to play in the yard with James and Roxy only minutes after arriving. Harry couldn't blame the kid; Molly had started baking an entire cake for him as soon as she heard.
Ginny pulled back, tears streaming down her cheeks. She was still in her quidditch robes; she must have come straight from practice. Her hair was unkempt and sticking out around her face and her eyes were emblazoned in a fear Harry hadn’t seen in years. He felt relieved to see her, but guilt was slowing forming under his skin. Here she was, worried and desperate to make sure he was okay, and he had been coming to the realization that he had a crush on Draco Malfoy.
Ron nodded determinedly as Harry moved on to address Ginny, “Gin, are you okay to watch over the kids? You know where I’ll be.”
His mind raced at an impossible speed as he considered this. Blaise? What in the hell? He had been telling himself for the past couple weeks that Draco and Blaise were a couple. Had he been wrong?
“Of course, Dad,” Ginny smirked, “I believe full-heartedly you won’t lose any of them in Diagon Alley.”
“I know what you are thinking,” Ida said, looking at Harry, “But she is a muggleborn who worked hard to get into one of the most challenging careers a wizard or witch can have. I know what it is like to be completely different from the rest of your family. I also know what it is like to work your arse off. She has promise, I know it.”
“That’s what magic’s for.” Harry pointed his own wand at the offending mud and muttered “Scourify.” The mud vanished off the carpet within seconds. Turning back to Angelina, he said, “Ang, if I had known you had practice today, I wouldn’t have asked you to babysit. Ginny said it was your day off.”
Harry searched frantically around the pub for Malfoy. To his dismay, the beanie clad man was nowhere in sight. Harry sighed and heaved himself onto an empty stool. He supposed he could call Malfoy, but he wanted to tell him everything that had just happened in person. He wanted to share his anger towards Ida, Padma and Aviary with someone. Having long forgotten his awkward interaction with Malfoy only hours before, he was now focused on finding the git and talking to him.
“I had to!” Harry explained, feeling worse and worse the more he spoke, “There were too many reasons to think he was involved! I can explain everything. I did this all for the investigation, not for me.”
“What!?” Ron shouted, “How is that possible? You two have been together since you were at Hogwarts!”
“And,” Seb continued, “I will be able to tell my coming out story. It may not be much, as my parents are the most accepting people in the bloody universe, but that’s not what matters. I was still terrified of telling them I was bi, it felt like I was erasing the person they thought I was. That everybody thought I was. And that’s terrifying, whether or not you know your parents will accept you for who you are.”
“Ida, I wanted to. But I promised Draco I wouldn’t talk to anyone about it. We wanted to be as cautious as possible,” Harry decided to leave out the fact he had told Padma and Ron.
“The face you made. It’s the same face you make whenever you realize anything,” Draco explained. If Harry wasn’t mistaken, he thought he saw a blush creeping onto Draco’s cheeks. At that moment Harry fully registered this was the first time they’d been truly alone since the kiss. Knowing it wasn’t the time or place, he said to Draco, “When you read off the things you learned in Cambodia about Chann, you said something about victims that were already pregnant, didn’t you?”
Harry stole a quick glance at Ida to find her shift awkwardly. It was small, something no one would have thought of as strange, but Harry knew. Part of her plan had backfired, and that brought a small shred of comfort to Harry in the moment.
“Of course, Healer Patrick,” Harry corrected, walking in behind her. The room had one bed in the center of the room where a patient lay with a book across his lap. The patient, without question, had Dragon Pox, a disease distinguished by the red bumps and greenish tint that occupied all of the victims skin. The man looked as if he was in his late twenties, early thirties. Despite his current ailment, Harry could tell the man was quite handsome. His tousled blond hair fell across his green face in waves, and his eyes were a deep brown that were intensely expressive. Due to the contagiousness of the disease, a large protective bubble had been spelled around the man. As Healer Patrick walked towards the young man, she spelled a bubble around her own head and gloves on her hands. She then told Harry to stand back as she removed the bubble.
“Thanks sir,” Harry paused, then decided to add, “I’m actually reading up on what the poison could be that’s been used in all the attacks. Do you know if there have been any new ideas?”
“I would never,” Harry grinned at Seb and then grabbed his bag. He walked to the first door in the hallway, the one Seb had told him was the guest room. He couldn’t help it; he gasped when he walked in. The entire room was painted yellow, with a light pink carpet to accent.
He looked into Harry’s eyes. Harry nodded, any anger at Malfoy alleviating as purpose began surging through his veins.
“I don’t have time to make us a more comfortable arrangement, so this should do,” Draco noted as he walked towards the fireplace and knelt in front of it.
Seamus looked from Ron to Ginny to Harry, “I’m sorry, mate,” he said to Harry, “I didn’t know this was a secret.”
Ginny looked pleased at this statement but didn’t say anything. This gave Ron a chance to jump in, “I hardly think Blaise’s opinion will make or break the match.”
“None of this is your fault, Harry,” Luna comforted, “And they will be upset, but not at you. What’s most important is that they know as soon as possible.”
Harry tried not to cringe at the fake concern. Clearly, Ida didn’t care at all about what happened to her partner.
“I know,” Draco whispered, looking at Dean and Seamus in turn, “That’s why we will fight to make sure no one else has this same terrible fate.”
Molly looked like she was about to argue, but she only huffed and said, “Fine, but this better not be the only topic of discussion at lunch today!”
“I know that, Harry. I’m just saying, think of yourself too,” Harry looked at Ida now. She seemed extremely uncomfortable. Harry realized that Ida wanted to talk about this even less than he did. This was her way of letting Harry know she supported him completely and wanted him to find happiness. Harry could almost laugh at how much Ida’s approach at a supportive friend talk contrasted Hermione’s, who was nothing if not direct and filled to the brim with the desire to talk about feelings.
“I still can’t believe he set the shed on fire! That’s some powerful magic right out of the gate!” Arthur exclaimed to Bill, twirling his own wand in the air, “My first magical “accident” so to speak was making a pebble float by looking at it! Hardly impressive, I have to say.”
Glancing at the time, he realized it was almost six o’clock, mere minutes before Ginny’s alarm would go off. He glanced down at his wife, who was sprawled out next to him with her face smashed deep into her pillow. Last night he had been expecting her to tell him off for the now clear lying he had been doing for months as he met with Draco, but she hadn’t. After putting their kids to bed, Ginny had proclaimed she was tired and went to bed without another word (Ginny could fall asleep within seconds, it was one of her many talents). Harry had decided as he lay in bed last night that he would initiate a talk with Ginny this morning and explain everything firsthand. He wasn’t planning on mentioning Kareach or how frequently he and Draco met (he hoped she would believe some of the times he had truly met with fellow trainees) but he would tell her that he and Draco were friends. He wished he could tell her the full truth, but he knew that wouldn’t be fair to Draco.
Laughing, James nodded, “Al says he’s got it. Which could mean Lily’s on fire or something worse, but we have to hope for the best,” he got up and started heading for the door. He paused in the doorway and turned around and continued, “And I’ll make sure Al doesn’t call Lily a wanker if that makes you feel better.”
“I should have tested it no matter what,” Draco said angrily, “Immediately! Everything I did, rushing off to you and then the pub, was all a rookie mistake!”
Harry said goodbyes to the both of them and shifted his knees to begin to move out of the fireplace when Savant spoke again,
“No, we can never live up to what our minds envision,” Harry agreed, “What about now? Are you a quidditch player?”
“An article!” Harry blurted. Draco and Blaise shot him an alarmed look, “I mean, an article’s great! Show Reyes as a clear prat and bad quidditch player.”
Draco was standing there. Without any warning, he grabbed Harry by the arm and led him across the room towards the conference rooms. Harry tried to pull away while simultaneously ignoring the terrifying beating of his heart, but Draco held tight. Harry had never seen him this determined, this threatening in his demeanor. Once they reached conference room B, Draco dropped him to a chair and slammed the door shut. He then began a round of silencing charms as Harry watched in silent confusion.
Harry didn’t know how Hermione had been holding up, having been stuck at home for the past week as she recovered. She was still doing all of her work from home, insisting that she wasn’t about to sit around doing nothing while the wizarding world was in panic mode. She had even convinced her healer to allow her to go to important meetings as long as she remained seated the entire time.  If Harry thought it was hard pouring over books trying to figure out all he could about Chann (Draco had imported about every Cambodian history book possible into his house, and Harry had about a good quarter of them holed up in his house), he couldn’t imagine what heading the department of international wizarding relationships would feel like. Not to mention Ron’s position. Harry was shocked he had any time to agree to a family get together, something so normal after a week that had been anything but normal. Yet both Ron and Hermione agreed that they needed to retain some normalcy if they were going to grasp onto any form of sanity.
Ginny spoke again, the words seemingly dragged out of her, “I love you, Harry. I need you to understand that when I’ve said that to you, each and every time, I’ve meant it. But,” she began to cry softly, a rare sight on Ginny Weasley, “I don’t love you in...in...well… that way,” she finished, looking down at the floor.
“I feel like I’m imposing,” Harry admitted, “I mean, I haven’t spoken to you in well over a month and then I show up on your doorstep.”
Malfoy looked back at Harry and then down at his elbow, in which Harry abruptly dropped. He seemed reluctant, but he slowly sat back in the chair beside Harry and signed.
Silence followed as Malfoy began to gather everything he needed for the interview. Harry was still in shock from the functional family scene he had just witnessed. Anytime he had imagined Malfoy’s life as an adult, he had never envisioned anything quite so normal.
“In the park,” Al stated, as if this was obvious, “Scorp is in the park a lot with his mum. Whenever Grandma Molly takes us there she lets us play with him.”
But Harry was barely registering Ron. He pulled himself to his feet with some difficulty and then made his way as quickly as he could across the room to Draco’s side. Seamus moved aside to let Harry kneel beside Draco, who was shaking violently from the pain.
“He tells me that every night,” Dean boasted jokingly, “Why would I tell you that? He told me that Aries fell off his broomstick during a friendly quidditch match. Serves him right. That’s going to be embarrassing when it hits the presses.”
“Despite what I’ve been through in the past couple days, it’s against my nature to not be at St. Mungos in a time of crisis. The Healers need all the help they can get, what with all the people injured in last night’s fight, so I’m here,” Brayan waved his hand as if to dismiss this all, “But that’s not what matters. What matters is that you are alive and doing well, Harry. It would have been quite a misfortune, to not only this hospital but all of the wizarding world, to lose you.”
Harry stayed rooted to his spot, watching as Ida slammed the door behind her. Although he was angry with himself for upsetting yet another one of his closest friends, he was much more focused on the fact his boss was behind everything. Harry couldn’t fight a sinking feeling that this wasn’t right. Yes, it seemed quite obvious that Brayan was behind a lot of this. The Death Eater father, his admittance to going to Cambodia, his perfect cover-up; it all made sense. But Harry had believed Draco all the times he spoke about Kareach. Brayan couldn’t be the only culprit. Draco had talked of a pair running Kareach. It couldn’t be just him and a bunch of purebloods he employed to do his bidding. There was more to this story.
“She did that?” Harry asked, laughing, “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of Patrick doing anything at Mungos that wasn’t directly related to her job.”
Harry placed his face in the center of the flames but felt no heat. The bright red of the fire blazing around him disappeared and reformed to the inside of his former boss’s office.
“That, I apologize for,” Malfoy explained as he took a seat at the table and gestured for his son to do the same, “Scorpius’s mother couldn’t get out of work on time to pick him up. She should be here any minute, however. She works on the first floor.”
The six of them pulled out their wands and apparated to the side of Seamus and Dean’s building. Harry quickly gulped in bouts of air as he steadied himself: no matter how many times he apparated, Harry always felt put off by the tightness in his chest and the weariness his body experienced once he reappeared. Despite the fact apparition would never be his favorite, Harry had no doubts in his mind that it was the most practical way to get from one place to the next and stuck with it for daily commutes.
“Harry, I’ll do it,” he said softly, locking his eyes with Harry’s own, “You’ve been through enough tonight.”
“Of course,” Harry felt a little odd at the formality in Ron’s words. Now, however, wasn’t the time to address the awkwardness still lingering in their relationship.
“Obviously not. This isn’t Hogwarts Draco we’re dealing with,” Draco shuddered, as if the memory of his old self caused him physical disgust.
“Kamusta, Harry,” Ida laughed as she set done the scones on a small jeweled table (she had also designed the table; the girl was a machine) and patted Harry on the shoulder, “Guess you lost those Auror-like reflexes, bes.”
“She’s probably on the third floor because she arrived first. That floor is actually for patients who’ve taken poison.”
After a couple minutes of eating as Lily chatted away (she was the only one not affected by the awkwardness of the situation), James looked straight at Harry and interrupted her chattering about a robin she had seen out the window this morning to ask,
“Ron!” Hermione exclaimed from her place a couple seats away as Rose said angrily, “I want a galleon!”
Annoyed at Malfoy’s rude answer, Harry snapped, “I thought you were here for me. You are standing outside the conference room, excuse me for thinking there was some problem with my interview!”
Harry filled the silence with, “Why don’t the five of us stay here? We probably shouldn’t drink ourselves silly with kids in the house, but we could still have a good time with a few silencing charms! How about that?”
He began to follow Ron to the lift to visit Dean’s hospital room. He held onto Ginny’s hand, trying to control his shaking. Dean almost died because he was a muggleborn. Yet he was one of the best healers on his floor. He was hardworking and contributed so much to this hospital. The thought that people believed all that was irrelevant due to his blood status was revolting. It was an ignorance that Harry had helped destroy, but never fully eradicated. He wondered if the wizarding world would ever be void of the terrors of prejudice.
With that, Seb left in a rush, leaving Harry to wonder why he couldn’t fucking get his life together.
“I like blokes,” he blurted, realizing immediately this was not the smoothest way to come out, “I mean, I am attracted to both men and women. And more.  I’m bi, or pan, or poly, or something else. I don’t know yet. But I’m not straight.”
Harry explained what he needed to check, carefully avoiding Draco’s gaze, as it made him feel he was on fire. What was happening to him?
Harry felt as if the floor had fallen out beneath him. Did Malfoy just say he was gay? What about his wife? His kid? What was happening? Had the rumor Seamus heard been true?
Harry winced at this, “I’d like to remind you that the word ‘man crush’ is usually associated with a straight man finding another man attractive. This is not that.”
Draco nodded. He opened his mouth as if he was going to say something else, then closed it and looked down at his lap.
“Harry James Potter!” Seamus yelled, “How dare you cheat on Ginny! I understand that dealing with your sexuality is a difficult process. Believe me, I know! You know how I spent a year dating Belinda while nursing a nasty crush on my best friend. But that’s no excuse!”
Ida laughed. “If only that were true. I’ve got to get home. It is Saturday, after all. See ya, Harry.”
“I really wouldn’t expect anything less, Malfoy,” Harry said, standing up regretfully from Murr to look at Malfoy.
“Harry,” Hermione reached for his hand, “You just told me you can’t do that anymore. Whether or not you and Draco ever work out, you need to tell Ginny. Everything. You can’t live a lie. We all know better than anyone that life is unpredictable and so, so fragile. We all managed to get through hell to have the lives we have today. You of all people deserve full and complete happiness.”
Arms wrapped around him, “He’s going to be okay, Harry,” Ginny murmured, “We’re all going to be okay.”
Harry stared at him. Draco’s voice was weak, weaker than he had ever heard it. Harry realized Draco must have been holding this feeling in for so long. The feeling of desperately wanting to atone for your past but knowing that may never be completely possible.
“Not when they are trying to attack St. Mungos! Not when…” he paused. He was about to say “Not when they are targeting Draco!”, but that would involve him explaining why Draco would be a target of Kareach. That would reveal to the Aurors that Draco was indeed investigating something they not only believed was fake but knew the Prophet wanted him to drop. He decided to stop trying to convince Aviary and Remmins at the moment. They weren’t going to believe his evidence, and they weren’t going to accept Draco’s position on the case. As of now, both the Aurors and Draco and Harry needed to continue what they were doing and hope someone could find evidence that actually helped then stop the attacks. The more he thought about all of this, the more he thought about how much danger Draco could be in. He needed to see him, make sure he was safe.
“Aunt Ida tried to kill daddy?” Lily said, her eyes wide as she looked up at her brother in surprise.
“I’m not worried about that,” James said softly. He looked up at his dad, his face honest, “I know I will always have both of you to count on. I love you dad, and I’m sorry I became so upset after you first told us.”
“Oh, Seamus,” Hermione said, a parallel of her address to Harry minutes before. Hermione crossed the room and embraced him, letting him cry into her shoulder.
“Yes, it’s true,” Brayan heaved a large sigh, “Ida was smart. It made for the perfect setup. Here I was, claiming I was a halfblood when she knew that my own father was not only a pureblood but a Kareach member. Of course, she didn’t bring up any of this in my confession. She wouldn’t expose Kareach. But Draco explained everything to me this morning. The goal of Kareach, the poison they used, the plan to use me as their scapegoat. I’ve still barely processed any of it. How terrible it all is!”
Malfoy smiled at his son, “I’m sure Potter would’ve loved to hear about your scholar- level knowledge of hippogriffs, but I’m afraid I see your mother.”
Harry’s body was on fire. He had never felt so aware of all his senses. From Draco’s vanilla scent to his soft skin to his murmured “thank you” on Harry’s neck. This is what Harry has been waiting for all his life and it was over too soon as Draco pulled away and walked across the room to one of his armchairs.
“Anyway,” Harry said, turning to a scowling Ron and breaking his thought spiral, “Ida told me there was another attack. What’s going on?”
“Let’s head out, then,” Harry walked to the door and held it open as Lily and James went through (Lily running as fast as her little legs could carry her, James trying desperately to keep her from tripping on the front steps). Rose and Al went through the door sideways, Rose leading the way while clutching gigantic Darren’s beak. Harry breathed in the fresh air and let his face break into a grin. It was going to be a long walk, but he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“I’ll tell her and everybody else that you are awake and well and that you will not be leaving your hospital room, but anybody who wants to visit can later,” Ginny gave him a stern look and led Al, James and Lily out of the room. James gave Draco a thumbs up as he passed him in the doorway.
Harry did choke on his mead this time, “What the fuck? I thought we were done with the third degree over my love life.”
“So,” Draco said, composing himself, “Should I only refer to you as ‘Harry fucking Potter’, or will just ‘Harry’ do?”
Harry sighed heavily and drowned his drink in one gulp. Standing up, he moved to get one last look at the pub before heading goodness knows where. He couldn’t go home now, surely, when he was still too mad at his friends to apologize for his outburst. That’s when he saw it- blindingly bright blond hair reflecting the dim lights shining from overhead. Harry moved without thinking towards Malfoy.
With that, he ignored Walburga’s angry screams as he pulled the curtains shut and turned to Aviary and Harry, who were still standing at the doorway.
Remmins was an Auror that had been working at the Ministry for about a year or so now. Harry had never gotten to know him well, as they were far apart in age and experience. Remmins was known for being a hard worker who could be a bit clumsy at times (there was one time he was almost killed on a stakeout when he tripped over his untied shoelace). For this, and multiple other, mishaps, he had often been overlooked in the past. Harry was glad to see Ron was trusting him with doing the interviews.
“I’ve just been really tired lately, that’s all,” he lied, “healer’s training takes up all of my energy.”
“George is still taking all the necessary security precautions as well, right, Angelina?” Arthur asked worriedly, no doubt thinking about all the possible things that could be poisoned effectively in WWW.
He bent down beside Aviary, “It was Aries Reyes, wasn’t it? That no good bastard! That’s why you couldn’t tell anyone at the office! Because Ida and Aries are cousins!”
“I was going to clean it first.” she mumbled apologetically, using her wand to move all her things into the corner of the room.
“I couldn’t agree more,” Aries beamed. Harry had never noticed how menacing his smile looked, “Where to begin?”
Al gave him a disappointed look but said nothing. Harry was surprised at the lack of argument, especially since Harry had given no actual reason as to why Albus couldn’t go and talk to Scorpius. He could only assume Al didn’t want to push his luck on a day like this; he knew Harry wouldn’t buy him sweets later if he misbehaved now. Sometimes Harry forgot how diplomatic his children could be. Leaning back, Harry happily listened as Luna and Al moved on from the topic of Wrackspurts to talk about the origin of the Puddlemere logo (there was surprisingly a lot of murder in Luna’s version). After awhile, though, Harry couldn’t help himself. He shot a glance at Draco and his friends and family. To his surprise, Draco was no longer sitting in his seat. Harry quickly looked around and found Draco walking down the bleachers towards one of the side entrances. Draco was moving at a quick and determined pace, causing Harry’s stomach to turn.
Harry froze with the margarita he was drinking in hand. Ginny and Ron followed Seamus’s gaze to Harry, confusion written across their faces.
“And we won’t tell anyone else,” Dean said, “But I think I reserve the right to if a victim is talking about having kids.”
“Ron, I told you I talked to Draco as a witness for the Trustins attack,” Padma said, looking up at Ron, “He really isn’t the same wanker he was at Hogwarts. He was still a bit distant, but he was willing to help in any way he could.”
“I have plenty for the both of us,” Al agreed. Harry couldn’t argue with this either. Out of his three kids, Al was the one who worried about everything and wanted all that he did to be perfect.
Remmins looked away, “Ida will explain everything,” he hesitated, then continued, “She believes you deserve to be here, as you are the reason she thought of this suspect in the first place. Also, she needs you to give a statement.”
“Oh, Harry! Ginny!” she exclaimed through tears, “I am so, so sorry! Ron’s so confused right now, he doesn’t mean all the things he said!”
“You didn’t ask it of me,” Harry said simply, “I asked it of you. And I understand the risk, I died once.”
Harry rolled his eyes as he wandered back over to his own seat, between Lily and Luna. Thankful to have Luna at his side during the match, he began a lengthy conversation with her about Wrackspurts. Al, who was sitting on the other side of Lily, argued with Luna over the logic of Wrackspurts existing.
Harry froze, not knowing what to say. After a moment, he asked, “Then why act horribly towards me throughout the entire interview?”
Harry followed the group as they entered the building, said their hellos to the doorman, Tony, and made their way up the stairs to Dean and Seamus’s flat. Ginny stepped up to the door and knocked. A moment later, Dean appeared, drink in hand.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, wincing when the words came out more accusatory than he had planned, “Sorry, I mean I’m happy to see you. I just didn’t expect you to be back working so soon.”
Harry stared at Draco, who was now breathless and running an anxious hand through his hair. He felt numb, his whole body was cold. Draco had been living in remorse for nearly fifteen years and had spent all of his career making up for the person he had been. Harry felt a sudden surge of pride to be his friend, to get to know this new Draco, however confusing he might be.
“I looked that woman in the eye,” Hermione said bitterly, “I called her a friend. I talked to her at bloody gatherings with my friends and family. And the whole time, she had no problem stunting my reproduction.”
Harry shook his head, “If the person is really good at concealing magic, couldn’t they be allowing the Aurors to see that one wand was used?”
Harry snorted. In all actuality, Harry wouldn’t expect anything else from a pet of Malfoy’s. He had already seen the way he treated everything in his life, with a care and precision Harry hadn’t thought possible, and he was best friends with Hermione Granger- Weasley. He had also met Malfoy’s gracious and dignified child, so it was no wonder he raised a ferret to be held up to the same standards.
The minutes seem to last longer as they waited for any word from Padma. After about forty minutes of hearing nothing, Draco stood up and began to pace the room.
Lily, clearly intrigued, announced, “I’m co-spinna!” to the rest of the room, propelling herself off of Angelina’s lap to go and grab the rejected board from the ground.
“Ida, I’m not going to stop being Draco’s friend. You can believe what you want, but I know your wrong,” Harry said confidently.
Ignoring Draco while pretending life is normal with his wife proved to be much harder than Harry anticipated. Yes, his feelings were real. Yes, he had already told Ida and had consequently brought his feelings into the world. But he was not Draco’s person, and Draco was not his. For all he knew, Draco was in love with Blaise, a friend he had known since Hogwarts who was gay and nice and confident and so fucking attractive that Harry wondered repeatedly what Draco could ever see in him, Harry. A week had gone by and he had successfully ignored all of Draco’s angry calls and voicemails. He felt like a prat, but he couldn’t think of any other way to deal with his messy feelings without betraying his wife and family. And Ginny was great. She really was. The things he had felt after the attack had been enhanced by his insistent worry that Draco could have died. Yes, he was fully and hopelessly attracted to Draco. But that didn’t mean he didn’t love his wife, that he couldn’t make their, albeit rocky, relationship work. So he went through the motions of his life, spending as much time with his kids as he could. At the hospital things were  worse because every time he went anywhere near the canteen or the Ground Floor, he was reminded of Draco. As being those are the only two places he went for most of the week, his job was a new form of hell he had not prepared for.
Lily looked between her mother and brother, then shook her head softly, “I believe Al. I never liked Aunt Ida.”
“He apologized for being a Death Eater?” Ida said alarmingly, “I always thought he was one of those ex-Death Eaters who would go back to their old ways as soon as they got the opportunity.”
“Yes, we do,” he agreed, “And now we know that Kareach is trying to conceal their group and that it’s effective. We need to prove the attacks involved more than one person.”
Harry hurried down the office to Savant’s office. He gave a knock that was immediately answered by the door swinging open. Ida was sitting on the floor of the office, papers spread like a fan around her.
Harry opened his mouth to argue this, but a waitress approached them. They both ordered their usual teas and a plate of scones. As she walked away, Harry turned back to Malfoy,
Harry nodded, not looking her in the eye. He followed a moment after she left the room, moving Lily from the couch in the living room to her own bed as Ginny moved Albus (only James had crashed in his actual bed; Albus had managed to stretch his entire body across Ginny and Harry’s). One by one, he walked into each of his kids’ rooms, kissing them gently on the head and staring down at them in their peaceful slumbers. He imagined how promising their lives looked now. They had faced no real fears or sorrows, which is exactly what Harry and Ginny wanted for them after the horrific events of their own childhoods. Harry had wanted a family like the Weasley’s ever since he first met Ron and his family at King’s Cross Station so many years ago. He wanted the easy comfort and reassurance that came with two parents who loved you unconditionally. He got that with the Weasley’s after years of living in a special kind of hell with the Dursleys. Now he wanted his kids to have this feeling of love and safety, despite the unpredictableness of life. As long as their family life was solid, he hoped they would believe that everything would be okay. If he and Ginny were to end this safe haven they had created, he worried that he would destroy everything they had built for their family. Implode the very foundation that held them together.
Harry smiled, but his smile began to falter as he studied Draco’s face. Up close, Draco looked even more exhausted than before.
Harry turned now to Ron, “You need to be at the Ministry,” Harry asserted, “Aviary’s right. You can’t afford to arise anymore suspicions. You’ve already been gone for too long. Not to mention, we need someone who knows the truth on the inside. Monitoring her. Tell Padma. The two of you can figure out this together. Just be careful”
The whole group laughed at this as Seamus mocked offense. Luna and Hannah were already bubbling over what accessories they would wear to the wedding, to which Parvati and Lavender told them “anything goes.” Angelina was fighting with George over who would make a better bridesmaid (to be honest, Harry thought George could pull it off quite well). Harry was content with watching these conversations until a quidditch discussion sprung up next to him between Ginny, Ron and Seamus, in which Harry joined in to discuss the Cannons constant improvement under Ginny’s watch.
“Unfortunately, I did,” Blaise said regretfully. He regained his confidence and laughed, “It was Seamus’s idea. Promote the match by showing a friendly competition between the Games and Sports employees, coaches, and players. Clearly the teams were mixed, because none of Games and Sports could win against any of those coaches or players.”
“Well, then it’s good you didn’t tell me,” Aviary shuddered, “Just imagine what would have happened if you told Ida and I?”
Harry's eyes lit up in shock, “Yes! I do! He said he was shopping when he heard people screaming and decided to hide. We believed him, because he said he was a halfblood!”
“I know the drill,” Seb said, looking wearily at the cup. Harry had learned about the painful treatment to Dragon Pox. The potion was exceptionally excruciating to consume. Harry knew someone as cheery as Seb wouldn’t even see a positive spin to having to drink the only treatment.
Malfoy laughed, a clear and light sound, “What did you think, Potter? I was going to let my Murr behave like any other ferret, or animal to be precise? You must know me better than that by now.”
“I thought you wouldn’t want to hear from me, Draco,” Harry confessed, “And if it’s any consolation, I’ve been feeling an immense amount of guilt all weekend thinking about you going on a stakeout for our investigation.”
The rest of the week passed in a blurr. Harry had spent every evening in with his family now that the aftermath of the latest attack had subsided. No more muggles were in danger of dying, so the entirety of St. Mungos had become more relaxed and orderly. Harry and Ginny talked, and Harry agreed to try muggle therapy in order to help control the sudden bouts of sadness he felt. His first session was the following week. The possibility of some improvement in his own life put him in a much better mood and allowed him to focus on his excitement for his training with Healer Patrick during the entire week. Drinks with Bill, Fleur, Angelina and George on Saturday night distracted him enough to even make him stop thinking about the Malfoy pub adventure from a few days before. Sure, Harry was interested in what Malfoy could uncover with his investigation. He believed Kareach could be a legitimate problem. The way Malfoy talked about it with such determination made Harry believe he had solid reasons to relate a new rumored organization to that of Voldemort and his Death Eaters. But there was nothing Harry could do about that. Malfoy clearly had only told Harry anything because he was drunk and lonely. He had even told Harry that himself. Harry needed to stick to his own books and move on from whatever the night at the Leaky had been.
“Should we tell him? I understand that we shouldn't alert everyone that got infected at the moment because that would definitely draw the attention of Kareach, but it just all seems so unfair. How can I not tell Dean that something like this has happened to him?”
Harry turned without fully looking at Ginny and began to make his way towards the stairs. Before he could get far, however, Ginny spoke.
It took all of Harry’s energy to muster a concerned expression, “I come with some difficult news. A little while ago, I found Aviary outside my doorstep, passed out on my front porch.”
“Draco… it wasn’t personal,” Harry began, “You have to believe me! It has nothing to do with spite or anger at you! I did it for the investigation, that’s all.”
Wizards and witches were passing every which way, frantically handing off paperwork and apparating into thin air. Many passing Aurors had a look of nervous triumph. There was no doubt in Harry’s mind a confession had been made today.
Thankful for the distraction from all his worries, he leapt up from the bed and apparated straight to the front of the Ministry.
He couldn’t explain the bout of courage that had brought him to the front of Draco’s flat. He couldn’t explain why he had apparated here directly after leaving St. Mungos. He especially couldn’t explain what he was planning on saying to Draco. Blocking out the numerous protests and hesitations buzzing around in his mind, Harry knocked on the door. He considered fleeing for a weak moment as he waited for Draco to answer (he knew from a Healer that Draco had gone home to get some sleep), but he made himself stay rooted firmly in front of Draco’s door.
“Harry,” Aviary began again, “The idea of Kareach is an organized cross-cultural society against muggleborns and muggles with an ultimate plan to eliminate them. That is a far cry from poisoning muggles.”
“What’s there to talk about?” Draco said, “I paint things in my life. It has nothing to do with you or your fucking ego.”
Harry hadn’t properly talked to Blaise, well, ever. He hadn’t been expecting such gravitas from the man.
“Of course! I didn’t want him to be guilty,” Harry insisted, “I just feel terrible, Aviary. I shouldn’t have said anything.”
“I’m still not sure that it is!” Ron argued, “At what point did it become okay to be chummy with the entirety of the Slytherin house!”
Draco sighed, “I don’t know. They were clearly aiming for me. Unless they were just aiming to kill anyone and anything. But it all felt so deliberate. They know we are onto them. Whether or not me being at the hospital was a lucky coincidence is up in the air.”
Draco smiled softly, unexpectedly, “There’s no way Weasley believes you are reading these books for training. I didn’t get to witness your Hogwarts studying habits firsthand, but I’m sure they were abysmal.”
Harry tucked into his first pie and sighed softly at the explosion of flavors. Dean laughed at him as Harry took another ravish bite but Harry didn’t care.
“Do you… do you think it’s him?” Ida questioned. She turned to him and grabbed his arm, “Harry, tell me all you know. You know something. We need any information.”
“I do not care at the moment, Ida. I am the head Auror, let me make the decision,” Savant’s voice was soft but firm as he addressed Ida. Turning back to face the fireplace, he said, “Potter, Brayan’s confession was thrown out. He was found to indeed be under the Imperius curse. Remmins was right. He used his dying breath to state what he thought to be the truth, and he was right.”
“Yes!” Harry looked at Ron, suddenly remembering the event that had started all of this, “So he’s fine? I need to see him!”
Harry looked at the place where she had sat and wiped his tears on the back of his hand. He was working on getting the courage to go back inside when he heard the door open once again behind him.
“Draco!” Harry reached for his arm, “I wouldn’t break your heart! I feel the same way you do. I want this to work out, so much it hurts. Don’t you understand that?”
Ginny took a deep breath and seemed to settle herself. She then looked directly at Harry and said, “I’m not happy, Harry. And I have a feeling you aren’t, either.”
“Granger- Weasley… I mean Ron,” Draco emphasized, “I appreciate you saying all of that. I want to help in any way I can.”
“I mean… the way she looked at Hermione. Or Dean. When she thought no one was looking. I chalked it up to general mistrust of people or just a resting angry face. She is an Auror, after all. But something always felt, like I said, off with her. Like she was holding back something,” Ginny finished.
“Gin,” Harry said, his voice shaking, “That is how I feel. I’m just… so scared of messing up our family.”
Malfoy looked like he was considering standing up and leaving, but he stopped and looked right back at Harry.
A thought formed in Harry’s head, and before he knew what he was doing, he answered, “Healer Brayan. He wants me to go back in for the next couple of hours and help Healer Patrick with the last of the Muggle patients.”
Aviary slammed her fist into the floor. Harry watched as he knuckles began to bleed, but she didn’t seem to notice or care. She continued to pummel the floor, tears coming fast and hard to her eyes. Harry sat back in shock, his own grief and anger over Ida overtaking him. He watched absently as Draco moved across the floor and gently pulled on Aviary’s arm. She stopped trying to smash a hole through the floor and turned to look at him. She then threw her arms around Draco, who held her as she cried and cried into his shoulder. Harry watched in amazement as Draco comforted someone he hardly knew as she cried over the murder of her boyfriend and the betrayal of one of her closest friends. His heart surged for Draco, which was a completely unhelpful thing at the moment.
“Of course, Arthur,” Angelina reassured, “I’ve seen to it myself. Even if the attacks haven’t been in Diagon Alley recently, it doesn’t mean they won’t happen again.”
Harry felt a surge of gratitude towards Hermione. But if she was handling the Ginny of it all poorly, she was definitely not going to hold up well when he told her he was in love with Draco.
Harry tried desperately to ignore the blush forming across his cheeks at this statement, “Gin,” he said, “I’ll explain everything later. I promise. Right now, I need to make sure Dean and Seamus are alright.”
He looked at his wife, the woman he loved and adored. The woman who he was raising three amazing kids with. Harry was a jumble of emotions and endless thought cycles. He couldn’t go on like this forever. The tears started before he could control them, running down his face messily and making Ginny wrap him in a fierce and protective hug.
Dean’s flailing was subsiding as Harry muttered spell after spell. He kept his hand steady and his mind focused. Despite his efforts, he could feel Dean suddenly getting worse. Dean’s whole body began to shake violently. Harry began to shout out for help, hoping for a more experienced Healer to swoop in and take over.
“Harry!” he exclaimed, rushing over, “What happened! I tried calling back…” he trailed off when he noticed Dean and Seamus sitting next to Harry.
“Alright,” Draco said. He reached for his coat that was now resting across the armchair, “I’ll be off.”
Malfoy looked up, his blue eyes alight with surprise until he realized it was Harry. He then ran a hand through tossed blonde hair and glowered, “For your information, I choose this spot not because of Mr. Beckham but the Spice Girls. I happen to enjoy their music” He gestured towards a poster directly behind Malfoy that Harry had missed. Sure enough, the Spice Girls posed on the album cover of ‘Spice’ in all their mid-90s glory.
“Yes, thank you, Harry,” Ida said. She stood up to move closer to the fire, “Let her know as soon as she wakes up how sorry I am. I haven’t gotten a proper chance to comfort her, not with everything that’s been going on. I need her to know I’m thinking about her and sending her love. I know how much Gani meant to her.”
As two more deep red filled glasses came sliding to a stop in front of Malfoy, he shot Harry an annoyed look but didn’t move as he took a small sip from the new glass of wine nearest to him.
Ginny turned to Harry and yanked him off the floor. She then turned to James, “Why would you say your father cheated on me with Mr. Malfoy?”
“Ron,” Harry said hesitantly, “Draco is a good person, who has changed. We are just friends. We get tea sometimes. That’s all.”
Harry tried to control his breathing. Why did Draco do that? Did he even understand how much the simple hug was affecting him? Reluctantly, he sat on the couch besides Draco. There was a strong possibility Draco didn’t share his feelings. There was also a strong possibility that Draco was in love with Blaise Zabini. Who was about ten times more attractive than he was. Right now, he needed to focus on the fact that Draco and Dean were alive and how they needed to keep it that way.
“Don’t be upset with him, Harry,” Molly added, “It was a very caring action. I am glad both you and Ginny have found someone who makes you so happy and cares about you so.”
Harry pulled a face at her. “It means “hello”. I’ve been gone for two months. I think I can handle remembering the few Filipino phrases you taught me.”
Seb laughed at his joke. The soft and airy quality of it was soothing and almost made Harry feel better, “I like what you did there,” Seb commented, “I always appreciate a good pun. I used to give Healer Patrick a new pun every time she came into my room. She then began coming into my room every five minutes one day until I admitted I couldn’t think up puns that quickly.”
“I was at a pub! A muggle one,” Harry thought fast, “With two trainees, Caser and Hedra. I knew they were going out last night and they had initially offered for me to join. I showed up and got pissed.”
“Really?” Ginny asked, appearing in the doorway, “Why would he ask for a trainee to come back so late at night?”
Harry rolled his eyes, “Honestly, Draco, you did what anyone would have done in that situation. You can’t blame yourself for any of this. And if it was a decoy, whoever left the letter would have erased any evidence of themselves or their magic in case you did figure all of this out beforehand and want to test it.”
She turned to Draco now, “And I am more than disappointed at the actions of this one, pinsan,” she walked towards Draco, “He was raised by a respectable pureblood family who doubt taught him the ideals of a true wizard. But, somehow along the way, he lost sight of this. Probably when he decided he wanted to fuck Harry Potter.”
“I just spent two hours pretending I knew nothing about what she did,” Aviary said, her voice hollow, “I think you can manage.”
“Alright, alright,” Blaise said. He looked from Harry to Draco and looked as though he was going to say something, but Draco shot him a fierce look. He stopped and simply said thank you to Harry. Harry walked to the door, looking back silently to see Blaise grasp Draco’s hand. A shock shot through him. Harry abruptly left the room and closed the door behind him.
After a good thirty minutes of Brayan telling his side of Harry’s life story (from a man who had know Harry for only a couple months, he sure had plenty to say), Brayan excused himself after a nurse who had been searching for him asked him to finish the trainee class he had been running before he came sprinting to Harry’s interview. Once Brayan was gone, silence quickly consumed the room as Malfoy moved to pack up his things.
Dean opened the door and greeted the party to an excited cheer. Harry watched as Ron, Hermione, Padma, Ida and Aviary trailed into the flat.
Harry laughed; he was beginning to like Blaise’s boldness, despite himself, “Yes, that would be the reason. He immediately insulted my wife, so that wasn’t a joyride.”
All five of them turned to see Draco, standing in the doorway, leaning against the doorway. Despite the attempt at a casual look, Harry knew him far too well to buy into that. Draco looked like he hadn’t slept in days. His hair had a very Harry-at-Hogwarts-before-he discovered-what-combs-are look and his clothes still sported patches of dirt. Harry knew he must have been worried, because it was not at all like Draco to leave dirt on himself when he was perfectly capable of taking it off with a wave of his wand. His face was mostly healed from where Ida and Aries had carved into it, but large scars still spread across a large portion of his face. They were battle scars, proof of all Draco had done to take down Kareach. Fuck. His kids were right. He was so fucking in love it hurt to look at him.
“Fine,” Padma turned to Harry, “Just remember he’s just doing his job and there is no reason to turn it into one of your schoolboy showdowns.”
Seamus looked at him, clearly impressed, “That’s very wise, Mr. Potter,” he smiled softly then reached for Harry’s hand, “But in all seriousness, I don’t think you are a monster to go to Draco’s. I remember what it felt to really start to fall for someone. When I realized I liked Dean, I would have done anything if it meant a chance to just bloody kiss him. You are a great father and friend. Just look at all the things you did today! Many lives were saved because of you and Draco. You two… you seem to make a great team. And he must have changed if he was able to pull off what he did today. Harry, I support you endlessly. I hope you know that.”
“She’s fine,” Ginny reassured, “She was hit by multiple stunning spells last night at the Ministry. Nothing major. She’s been conscious for awhile.”
“Otter nonsense, there’s nothing fun about that!” Malfoy joked. Harry was about to tell him about how he got the name from Sirius, but paused. Their conversation was light and friendly and Harry wasn’t ready to ruin that. Not when Malfoy had almost finished his third drink.
“Nice to see ya, Potter!” she barely looked back at Malfoy as she made her way with the woman to the center of the pub.
“You know what?” Draco tore the curtain completely open and spoke directly to Walburga, “My parents taught me awful things. Do you know why? It’s because they came from awful ancestors with disgusting beliefs, just like yours! You should be proud that the Order was based out of your house. They changed the wizarding world for the better. This is where I wish I would have been throughout the war. And I realize I’m shouting this all at a painting, but I don’t care! I’ve wanted to scream at my ancestors for so long, and this is the closest I can bloody get!”
Seamus shot James a half-hearted glare and ruffled his hair, “You take that back, Weasley-Potter. I’m not scared of you just because you learned some spells.”
“Why is everyone fixating on that?” Harry wondered desperately, “He’s my friend. It’s not the most insane thing that’s happened.”
“Fine,” Harry crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows. If Malfoy wanted this to be a bitter and jaded reunion, Harry would make it one, “I have to say, asking the questions instead of criticizing me for not answering correctly might make this run at your desired pace, don’t you think?”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Brayan gasped, beaming down at Malfoy, “I can’t believe I almost missed your interview with my star trainee here!” he gestured towards Harry and continued, “I have much to say about Harry’s work ethic and continued successes as a trainee, and I am sure Mr. Potter has just as much to say about my influence on him as a teacher and mentor!”
Seb reached over and patted Harry on the back, “Listen, I know the perfect cure for a long day. Go put your stuff in the guest room and then we’ll hit the Leaky.”
Harry nodded silently; this did all make perfect sense. It was just terrifying to think that so many of his friends and family, many of which were muggleborn, could be going to work with someone who wanted to stunt their reproductive system with the goal of ending their ancestry.
Malfoy let out a sudden snort to this. Harry saw something light up in his eyes. Here was the Malfoy he had seen briefly at the bar, the one who spoke of ferrets and Harry’s bad naming skills.
“Victims are now being sent directly to the canteen!” Harry shouted, “Any available personnel needed.”
“Fine. Ask me more questions, get my signature. But I need you both to promise to stop making me feel like a fool for believing in Kareach.”
The group walked for about fifteen minutes until they reached the park, a large green field in the center of the neighborhood equipped with a play set, swing set and football field. Lily took off towards the play structure immediately, the slide being her favorite. James gave his Dad a desperate look that told Harry he would rather go and fly the kite with Al and Rose than go on the play structure with Lily, so Harry took after his daughter. However, she only made it up the stairs and down the slide one time when she shrieked with delight. A young boy standing near her started at the sound and began to cry, causing his mom to send Harry a disapproving look. Harry was about to defend his daughter when she took off again towards Al, James and Rose, who were now flying kite Darren in all his winged glory. Harry followed Lily over to the group now surrounding Al, Rose and James, one eye on his daughter and his other on the kite. If he had thought the kite looked cool immobilized, he was hardly prepared for how amazing it looked in flight. It’s giant wings soared in the air, glistening in the late autumn sun. Months of kite flying had paid off; the kite was gliding effortlessly over the large crowd of bystanders. As Harry reached the circle, he scooped up Lily and put her on his shoulders so she could get a better look. They continued to watch as Al, Rose and James alternated turns with the owl and tried to outdo each other by getting the kite to do all sorts of flips and tricks. Eventually, the crowd thinned out as afternoon turned into evening. Harry and his kids showed no signs of going home. James was now helping Lily fly the kite towards where Al, Rose and Harry stood. Their once large crowd only consisted of two young girls, who Harry thought were there more for Al and James than the kite. James and Al, thankfully, seemed oblivious to this and were focused solely on the kite. All of a sudden, Harry heard an excited but unmistakable polite voice from behind him ask “Is that a northwestern tawney?”
Harry nodded, “You’re right,” he said softly. The memories of the night began to flash before his eyes. Malfoy saying he was gay. Malfoy talking about his pet ferret. Malfoy telling him about Kareach. Malfoy saying he was gay. Harry wouldn’t have found about any of that out if he had been with Ginny. He wouldn’t have felt free to let loose. But he also wouldn’t feel as he did now; angry at Malfoy for leaving so abruptly, confused on whether or not they were on good terms.
“Ginny,” Harry tried again, “The Aurors and I had plenty of reasons to think he was guilty! It was not spiteful. You know I’m not upset with you about Blaise.”
“All of our friends and family are fine!” Ron quickly reassured, “All the kids are safely at my mum and dad’s.”
“Do I? Anytime things get hard you ignore me for a week! I like you too much to have my heart broken!” Draco’s eyes grew wide.
Dean hesitated for a second before holding up his wand and grabbing Hermione. Draco let go of her legs but Ron wouldn’t let go of her arms.
“Yes, you should have,” Aviary said firmly, “All the Aurors agree that you had significant reasons to believe Blaise was guilty. You also gave us reason to believe that the actual culprit is most likely a Ministry or hospital employee, in order to have the level of access they did. We are beginning to focus on the scope of the case, and that’s because of you. You must have been a damn good Auror.”
As soon as she released Hugo’s hand, he took off towards his group of cousins, who were now all sitting in a circle on the grass, playing what Harry assumed was duck duck goose (they really did know every muggle game in the book).
She looked up, “I can’t lose him,” she whispered, he voice containing a sadness Harry couldn’t begin to describe.
“I will never understand you, Potter,” Malfoy said in a strange tone, but thankfully he lowered himself back into his seat.
“That’s bullshit!” Harry exclaimed, voice now fully raised, “You don’t trust him! He’s gone out on a limb to trust you two, and you are writing him off as if he’s nothing! As if he hasn’t been working at this for months!”
Ginny nodded slowly, “I think so,” she shook her head, “I still get this feeling that I’m destroying our kid’s childhoods. I mean, Lily won’t even remember a time where her parents are together.”
Harry smiled as Aviary began to talk about a woman she had a suspicion wasn’t straight as Padma shot her down continuously. Harry knew Padma well enough to know she wasn’t the type to hook up or even talk to a stranger in a bar. Over the numerous years he had known Padma, he had only seen her with a date twice. The first time was with Ron at the Yule Ball, which was now only mentioned as a source of humor for Padma, who liked to poke fun at how abysmal Ron and Harry were as dates (Parvati had her complaints as well). The second time was at one of the annual Ministry Balls. Padma had shown up with a kind and pretty girl named Stacia who Harry had instantly liked. Unfortunately, Stacia had moved to Albania only a few months into their relationship and Padma had stood firm against long distance. This was all in sharp contrast to her twin sister, Parvati, who Harry had seen date more men and women than he could count. It was only in the last couple of years that she reconnected with Lavender (it was only a matter of time until one of them proposed. Harry had never heard two people talk about weddings more). Padma, however, never seemed upset to be single. She was more sure of herself than most people and never seemed interested in seeing anyone. That, however, didn’t stop her from pointing out people for her friends to hook up with when at a pub. Harry was glad for this; he had missed these pub nights after a long day at the office with his Auror friends.
“Of course I do, Hermione!” Ginny insisted, “I just… I felt like I owed it to Harry to tell him first, you know?”
With those words, Harry realized Draco had no idea that what Aviary was most upset about wasn’t Ida, but the loss of Gani.
Malfoy turned slightly and gave him a perfectly indifferent glance, before turning back to the menu and asking, “I’m a big pot pie fan but I’m reluctant to risk getting it at a hospital canteen. Is it any good?”
Harry was lying in bed. Hermione had left what must have been hours ago, and yet he was still lying here, no closer to sleep then he was then. Ginny had passed out as soon as Hermione had left. Harry had moved downstairs to the couch and had been attempting to sleep ever since, but his brain was moving too fast. He couldn’t stop thinking about Blaise and why he had taken the job at the ministry. The truth was, he was pretty sure he liked Blaise. In spite of the fact the last time he had spoken to him he had been upset because he thought Blaise and Draco were a couple, he had still taken to Blaise’s large and vibrant personality besides himself. But wouldn’t that be the perfect distraction? A large personality? The head of Games and Sports? No one would expect that person to be part of a secret society dead set on destroying muggleborns.
“Dover, I promise you’ll be safe if you get some sleep…” he trailed off when he noticed Harry and Ida standing there.
Harry was shouting desperately as Draco began firing spells at more masked figures. The killing spells had lessened, as the masked figures had thought Draco and Harry would be untouchable for the duration of the fight and were coming up with ways to end their shield. This now worked in Draco’s favor, as he used spell after spell to take down masked figures. Harry jumped up and followed him, fully recognizing Draco couldn’t fight all of them off forever. Harry didn’t think the Aurors were here. Draco was alone and Harry needed to save him.
“She came to help and fight,” Padma explained softly, “Much of Mungos did once I sent the call. Anyone who could came over to the Ministry.”
“Draco!” he yelled desperately as he bent down next to Ron, “I know what to do,” he says to Ron, trying to keep calm and focused.
Harry bent down to place a hand on Ron’s shoulder as Hermione asked, “Ron? I’m going to be okay. Honey, I’m here and alive. It’s okay.”
Harry let out a laugh at this. James had a point; Harry had never met a kid more at ease with who he was. James was confident and direct, but also kind, generous and thoughtful.
“Nothing is wrong,” Draco said evenly, “Not if I forget the fact you accused my best friend of a heinous crime.”
Despite how rude this was, Harry couldn’t help but appreciate being identified for being something other than ‘The Chosen One’. He doubted anyone had ever referred to him as ‘Ginerva’s husband’. But that could also be because Ginny would not hesitate to murder anyone who called her Ginerva.
Harry watched again as Ida pressed her wound into a gash on Draco’s face. She ran her wand down the length of it, sending even more blood trickling down Draco’s neck and onto his shirt. All Harry could imagine was the internal pain Draco was feeling, all concealed on his unmoving face.
Brayan pointed at a newspaper clipping on his desk when Harry approached, He loudly whispered to Harry, as the room had fallen silent, “Look at this, Harry! Second page with a large quote from yours truly! You should be proud.”
“Exactly,” Molly said, pointing her wand at James, Louis and Harry’s finished piles and transporting them through the air to a pot on the stove, “No reason to bring down Sunday lunch. Ron and Hermione may even be by later, so we will not fret.”
“Harry!” she looked as if she had been crying for hours, “Ginny is looking for you. She’s wondering if you are done with your statement.”
Before Harry knew what was happening, Draco’s lips were on his. The world imploded around Harry as a forceful feeling of desire overtook his body. He arched into the kiss, hands finding their way into Draco’s hair almost as if they had a mind of their own. Draco’s hands were on the back of his neck and his tongue collided hotly with Harry’s own. He moved to deepen the kiss, pulling Draco closer and basking in the warmth tingling throughout his entire body. His brain flooded with thoughts of vanilla and his skin ached with a feeling equivalent to fire spreading just underneath his surface. He had never felt so alive, so sure of what he was doing.
As Seb leaned into the kiss and deepened their contact, Harry told himself that this was something he should want. He initiated it. Seb was indisputably handsome, kind and generally amazing. He also was kind, patient and understanding. Seb was everything Harry could ever want. But all Harry could picture as he closed his eyes was Draco.
Angelina snorted. “I’ll take it. We are the best in the league. Even with our tosser of a coach. What I would give to have Ginny take over for Puddlemere.”
“I’m not going back to the Burrow, idiot,” Harry told Draco, “So tell me all the thoughts that have been swarming that poor brain of yours.”
“Well, off you go, Harry, Gin,” Arthur said, guilty avoiding Molly’s withering gaze, “Have fun with Dean and Seamus!”
But Harry cut in anyway, “Ginny, he’s proven innocent! Anything I said about him doesn’t matter now. I’ll apologize to him myself, I’ll make things alright.”
Darius looked at Hermione’s round stomach in shock, “Mrs. Granger-Weasley! What will happen to your child?”
Aviary countered with, “But it’s great evidence!” while Harry said indignantly, “To cover up the fact a group is performing the curses! A renowned group that could be connected to the crime!” He was positive this was true; it had to be Kareach! He needed to talk to Malfoy.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Well, yes… Draco and I are friends. But that has nothing to do with my and Ginny’s relationship! We are perfectly fine.”
Ida caught his eye and shook her head, “No worries, Harry. I agree with Ginny. My cousin is one giant wanker.”
“Yes!” Harry snapped, voice louder than he intended, “I’m at work! My break ends in a matter of minutes. I don’t have time to deal with your thoughts on the you-know-what every time you bloody feel like it! Some of us have an actual job!”
Darius inclined his head towards the edge of Harry’s bed as if to ask if he could sit down. Harry nodded and Darius took a seat. He looked much more exhausted and uneasy now that he brought up his father.”
Ron shook his head, “You don’t understand. I was standing near Rana. He was fighting too. I didn’t see the person sneak up behind him. If I had been paying attention, I would have saved him.”
A moment later, Angelina appeared in the doorway, one hand holding on to her five-year-old daughter, Roxanne, the other wrapped around what looked like the entirety of her quidditch equipment. Her long dark hair was barely held up in a windblown ponytail, and she was still wearing her bright blue and gold quidditch robes. At the sight of James, Albus and Lily, Roxanne abruptly dropped her mother’s hand and ran for the Twister mat. From behind her, another small figure pushed around his mother, brimming with excitement as he screamed, “James! Al! Lillllllly!” and disappeared into the thick of the Twister game.
A knock on the door caused them all to look up. Harry hoped it was Draco; he had left a couple of hours ago to go home and get some sleep and Harry was thinking he would be back sometime soon. But, to his and Ron and Hermione’s surprise, Healer Brayan made his way into the room.
“Yes. They managed to leave the room before she could hurt them. By them leaving, however, it dramatically weakened the charms when they tried to reinstate them. She’s now trying to get out of the room, and by the sound of it, she’ll be out any minute. And once she does…” Ron trailed off.
“No worries, my dear!” Molly exclaimed, “You will be missed, but we understand the importance of opportunity.”
“You seemed so happy around Astoria,” Harry said, taking a large gulp of his beer as he waited for Malfoy to say something.
“One that hopefully protects him from the hatred in this world,” Dean adds solemnly, leaning once again into Seamus’s touch.
“Absolutely,” Draco said from her other side, “She was your partner. You deserve to deal with this betrayal in any way you need to.”
“Yes, it has to do with Mr. Malfoy. We worked together a bit to figure out as much as we could about the attacks,” Harry admitted.
“Another gay wedding for the Gryffindors,” Seamus said, “All those years Lavender and Parvati spent talking about boys, and here we are. I still can’t believe that out of our entire Gryffindor class, only two of us ended up being straight.”
“You too, Harry,” Hermione hesitated, then asked, “Is it completely irresponsible for me to not be at work right now?”
“I never had impeccable reflexes in the first place, Reyes,” Harry responded, “I’m not your ‘mate’ anymore, then?”
He pursed his lips, “I don’t know. Zabini has been a trusted part of this staff for a long time. I have never suspected any wrongdoing of any sort.”
“I’m sure Fred loved that, Rox,” Harry said. Turning to Angelina, he continued, “Perhaps I should’ve warned you about this one. James and Al didn’t talk to one another for a couple days after our last family game of Sorry.”
“He discovered what the poison from the Imperius attacks is!” Harry burst, immediately covering his mouth afterwards.
“No worries, Molly, I’m not here to dwell on what happened. I understand Christmas Eve isn’t the time or place for  worries,” he paused and beamed as Lily removed herself from Arthur’s lap and went to wrap herself around Seamus’s legs, murmuring “Uncle Seamus”.
Malfoy shrugged, “It’s the job, and he’s your boss,” he chided, “There’s no need to make it personal.”
Harry didn’t answer. He looked left and right. A muggle woman was walking towards them from the right, a small corgi trotting in front of her on a leash. Harry gestured to Aviary and Draco to be quiet. Aviary and Draco seemed to understand, as they walked silently with Harry towards a park bench. The woman gave them an odd look as she passed, her face half lit up by the light of the streetlamps. Harry supposed they did look odd, as Harry was dressed in an old t-shirt and pajama bottoms while Aviary was still wearing her Auror robes. They waited patiently until the woman disappeared around a turn after the last house on the block before Harry began to whisper furiously to Aviary and Draco:
Harry shook his head, “I don’t know about that. I didn’t like having someone who doesn’t really know me tell me what is wrong with my life.”
“And, of course, Padma will be my maid of honor and Lavender's sister Lila will be hers,” Parvati said, smiling over at her twin sister.
Harry didn’t get home until early the next morning. He ended up crashing on the couch as soon as he walked in. Harry and Malfoy had stayed in the cafe until the sun began to shine in through the multi-colored glass windows, talking about their theories for Kareach, everything from members and strategies to potential meeting places. Harry had blocked out his outburst from the night before until he apparated into his living room and saw the glasses of wine and bottles of beer still lying on tables throughout his living room. Guilt hit him hard in this moment, but before he had much time to think about it, he collapsed from complete exhaustion on the couch.
“Quite well. I see you are doing some late night reading? What an honor student!” Brayan complemented.
“I’m not going to talk about it! I just wanted to say, I heard a rumor that you were gay, and if that’s true, I want you to know I’m here to talk. I understand what it’s like to come to terms with who you are, and if you ever need someone to hear you out, I’m here. It doesn’t have to be now, or soon, or ever, but it could be whenever you need it,” Seb finished hurriedly, looking nervously to the side.
“Dean?” Harry asked worriedly, reaching across the table to touch his friend. Suddenly, Dean fell sideways out of his chair, twitching violently and flailing on the canteen floor.
The normalcy of her appearance made the situation worse. She had created a signature crown of braids, that somehow, despite the fact she had just fought the entire Auror department, was still held up pristinely on top of her head. She was still wearing her Auror robes. She looked as if she was heading in for a day at the office.
Without any intention of doing so, Harry gave a small gasp. The Malfoy who walked into the room looked nothing like the boy Harry remembered at Hogwarts or the man Harry expected to interview him today. Malfoy’s signature slicked back hair he had adorned for the entirety of his time at Hogwarts was gone, replaced by fine strands of wild blond hair that was falling into his eyes without Malfoy seeming to be any the wiser. His clothes were nothing Harry could have ever imagined a Malfoy wearing. He had on distinctively muggle clothes; a soft blue jumper paired with black jeans and grey pointed shoes. What possibly surprised Harry the most was the kid walking into the room behind Malfoy. He was obviously Malfoy’s son, but he was not the pristine and proper kid Harry had envisioned. He looked like he was around James’s or Al’s age, and dressed just as they would, in a simple t-shirt and pair of blue jeans. Malfoy’s vivid white-blonde hair and pointed chin were instantly recognizable in his son, but his eyes were a soft brown that screamed something new all together. Neither of them, Harry realized with a shock, reminded Harry of Lucius or Narcissa or any Malfoy-Black he had ever encountered.
Suddenly something occurred to Harry. As Ron went to answer Draco, Harry interrupted, “Draco! I need to talk to you,” he looked at Rose, watching intently from her position on the bed, “Outside.”
Harry realized as he stared at Aviary that whatever anger he was feeling towards Ida was nothing compared to what Aviary was feeling, “Aviary, I’m so sorry,” he whispered.
After taking a sip, Malfoy said, “Astoria was picking up Scorpius to take him to her house for the week. I thought that seemed obvious?”
“Better than me,” Seb said, “I didn’t read if I didn’t have to before I got into my twenties. The only thing I wanted to do was play quidditch. I was only a few years behind you, you know. Hufflepuff. Didn’t make the team until after you left, though. Wasn’t as good as I imagined in my head.”
“Yes I do!” she insisted. Her laughter died down as she turned to look directly at him, “I always had a feeling. I mean, come on, I’ve had an expert ‘gay-dar’ ever since I was a teenager.”
Harry’s brain began to spin, “For how long?” he whispered. He barely recognized his own voice, rough and detached from his body.
“Wait!” Harry insisted, but Malfoy was rushing across the bar, pushing his way through drunken couples to find his friend and escape Harry.
“Yes, you are, actually,” Seb grinned as Harry attempted to protest, “Don’t even try. I’ve gone out to get tea with you only a few times. Not only do you only drink one type, you also need the precise amount of sugar or you won’t drink it.”
“I don’t know, are you planning on screaming at me again? Or is this not a public enough place?” Draco snapped, glaring at Harry.
She then rushed towards the hallway and continued to call Ron’s name, disappearing behind the swarm of frantic Aurors.
“Don’t change the topic,” Ida said fiercely, “Are you and Ginny fighting a lot? You seem on edge anytime I mention her. Does this have something to do with your friendship with Draco Malfoy?”
She asked this as if she already knew there was someone else. He wondered worriedly if she suspected anything about Draco. Deciding to ride the Seb train and ride it hard (excuse the double entendre), he said, “You’re right, Ida. Don’t act so smug about it, but yes. I like Seb.””
Harry exchanged a look with Ron and Ginny and then crossed the floor of his living area to the front hallway. In his front entrance was Aviary Dover, a look of pure terror on her face.
“You are right, Aviary…” he began to say, but he stopped abruptly when he heard a voice from the end of the hallway.
“No. Harry do not tell me I imagined this all. I know Ida’s voice. When you are in multiple high pressure situations with someone, you know their voice all too well. And now all I hear is her voice, saying she was going to kill him!”
“Yes, of course. She told me that you and her decided, mutually, that you would be better off apart. And from what she has told me, it sounds as though you are making the right decision. As for the accusation of Mr. Zabini, I don’t believe Ginny is completely in the right on that.”
The two laughed at this. Harry put one hand on Seamus’s arm and laughed himself weak into his shoulder.
“Yes, although I don’t understand why I have to be here. Savant didn’t make Abbott come back and find a partner for Blueskin when she resigned,” Harry leaned back against the wall.
“For the record,” Draco put in, “I didn’t ask him to help. He was willing to put himself in danger.”
“Okay, okay,” Astoria reached for Scoprius, “Hopefully I will see you around the hospital, Mr. Potter.”
He had been a disaster the night before. After the man, a bloke named George, had shown him to his room, Harry had collapsed on the floor in a fit of tears, blubbering to a complete stranger about how he had lost his kids, the love of his life and his friend all in one day. George had let him cry himself out before telling him he wasn’t in a position to give life advice. When George left, Harry sat in complete silence on the floor, thinking about how much he had fucked up. More than anything, he was replaying his kiss with Seb. Everything about it had felt wrong, out of place. For a brief moment, Harry had thought maybe being with Seb would solve all his problems. Seb was someone his family would support. It would make adjusting to the divorce and his new life much easier to have such a bright presence at his side. But maybe what Harry needed wasn’t a bright presence. Maybe what he needed was Draco. Not that that was ever going to happen. If Harry had learned anything in the past week, it was that he and Draco just weren’t a viable option now, or maybe ever.
Feeling pleasantly full, Harry sat outside with Molly, watching the afternoon activities play out around him. Rose, Al and Roxy were busy elaborating on the gnome tossing game by creating an obstacle course of sorts while James, Fred, Dom, Louis played a game of football with Ginny, Angelina, George and Bill. Harry had taught his kids the game and it had quickly become a family favorite at the weekly Burrow lunches. Dom was easily the best at the game and was leading her team of Ginny, Bill and Fred to what Harry assumed would be victory. Arthur and Fleur were talking while Lily played with bubbles Arthur was creating  out of his wand.
“I didn’t lie for months,” Ginny whispered, her voice low and almost dangerous, “For months and months while you snuck around with someone who’s hardly trustworthy!”
“Involve me!?” Harry whispered harshly, “Are you kidding me? This is our case! Mine and Draco’s! We trusted you by letting you in on the poison, there’s no way in hell you are going to kick off Draco.”
“Precisely,” Ida spat at Draco’s feet, “Our plan with that fool, Brayan, would have gone smoothly if it weren’t for him.”
The joyous cheers were rapidly declining into one’s of fear, of pain. Instinctively, Harry reached down to grab his daughter. He then looked frantically around the stands, trying to figure out what was going on. From what Harry could tell through the thick commotion, many people had collapsed from their seats onto the ground. Imperius attacks. Harry grabbed his wand, ready to fight, when a scream he knew all too well rang out over the chaos. Turning towards the sound, Harry saw the thing he feared most; Ron, screaming and rushing towards a figure lying on the ground. Without hesitation, Harry handed Lily to Al, who was sitting in shock next to him. He shouted to Molly and Arthur to apparate his kids away. Then he rushed over to where Ron is crouched over on the ground, already firing spell after spell on his poisoned wife.
She addressed this last part to all the girls sitting in the apartment of Dean and Seamus, which included Padma, Luna, Hermione, Hannah, Angelina, Fleur and Ginny. Lavender and Parvati had just announced that they were getting married (Parvati had proposed) and needed enough bridesmaids to fill a two-bride quota. They had told the room that they were planning on making every girl  there a part of the coveted bridal shower.
Aviary gasped, “Draco, that’s genius! She would never think of that… I doubt she’s even heard of that type of technology!”
“We think Blaise Zabini is involved with the attacks,” he said boldly, knowing the only way to say it was quickly and firmly.
“You know who killed Gani?” Ron gasped, completely interrupting Aviary as she attempted to continue speaking, “But you said…”
Harry shook his head, “It was not obvious at all. I just thought she was taking Scorpius home after you had been watching him all day!”
“Expelliarmus!” a shout occurred from somewhere behind Harry. He watched, with a renewed hope, as Ida’s wand went flying and ricocheted off one of the walls.
“Please, Harry, call me Darius,” Brayan said, “We are far past the niceties of a student teacher relationship.”
“Really, Ron, you have nothing to apologize for,” Brayan said, “Really, I’m quite thankful that I was merely accused of a crime. Nothing happened to me. Not like…” he trailed off as his voice cracked. He looked down at his feet.
Ida laughed, “I’m not sure I ever do,” she looked around for a second, then leaned back towards Harry, her face suddenly somber. “I technically shouldn’t be telling you this, but it happened again,” she whispered.
“Harry!” she exclaimed, quickly removing the black ink with her wand, “What are you doing here? Is everything alright?” She stood up and quickly made her way over to him to see what the problem was.
Bill turned to the three kids and explained that the attacks they had heard about in Diagon Alley had happened again in a muggle village. When he finished, James spoke,
“Then why do this? Now his job is at risk! The job he loves and is exceptionally good at. And he surely won’t make Head of Security, and Merlin knows he could have made a real difference there! He is smart and knows more than any of those wankers in the Security department, but now he’s seen as a huge risk! It doesn’t matter that he proved innocent, his past and the accusation of the entire Auror department will cast a shadow of doubt he may never recover from!” Ginny finished with her face bright red and her breathing hard.
“I’m not the only one you need to apologize to,” Ginny pointed out, “You yelled at three of your friends last night for no reason.”
Awkwardly picking at his scone, Harry grasped onto the topic of quidditch and the upcoming match. Ida, thankfully, latched onto this conversation, probably just as relieved to change the topic as he was. But as the two joked about how ridiculous Aries looked in the robes he always wore for matches, Harry couldn’t ease the nagging feeling that Ida suspected more than she let on. And if she was upset with Harry being Draco’s friend, she sure as hell wouldn’t want Draco to be his… boyfriend? Love interest? Harry didn’t know. But he did know that not having Ida’s support would drive him mad. If one of his best friends in the world, who was intelligent and accepting, couldn’t get behind the idea of Draco, then how could he expect anyone else to?
“Draco came over to the Burrow a few hours ago to tell me about your relationship. He wanted to make sure I was one of the first to know, as a mother figure to you,” she smiled at Draco.
Aviary and Draco remained silent as Harry told Draco what happened to Remmins. After he finished, Aviary was sitting silently, staring absently at the wall. He waited for Draco to say something.
He watched as Ron’s head disappeared and then his entire body materialized moments later. He looked exactly how someone who had spent the day at an office who had captured a confirmed criminal would look. His hair was a disaster and his eyes were bloodshot. But there was more than that in Ron’s face, which is what made Harry believe this was about much more than Brayan. This was the expression Ron held when something disastrous had happened and he was feeling hopeless as to how to fix it.
Harry felt a little off put by the lack of expression in Savant’s voice. He was used to the loud, booming abrasiveness of the man in front of him. This new Savant had seen and done things that had left him this new man, tired and broken down while still working at the dregs of night.
Harry trailed off as he pictured the kind and hardworking kid that Harry had seen only hours earlier. He was so young. So full of life. Certainly he wasn’t dead.
Ida came back in moments later with two full glasses of mead. She handed one to Harry and then took a large swing of her own.
“A bloody good tradition that is!” Neville countered, “Not to mention the fact it was a rather good Bat-Bogey! I’m starting to think Harvin’s been taking lessons from Ginny.”
Harry shook his head, “Something different, something new. Certainly you know what I am talking about?”
Harry stared at Seb. Was he right? Was the reason Harry had gone through so much in the past couple months because he was finally trying to cheer himself up, and that proved to be messy and confusing and just plain chaotic? Had he spent so much of his life doing what others wanted or expected that he had forgotten he had his own feelings and aspirations as well? Was Seb the only one who truly understood that?
“I know. I’m relieved we’ve found one source of the attacks, but clearly this case is far from over. I think you were right, Harry. This was done by a group of people, and I don’t just mean Brayan and a bunch of mindless followers. I mean a real group… not necessarily Kareach, but… possibly? Who knows at this point,” Ron sighed, “Harry, I really thought this was over. I’m starting to think it will never end. I’m already constantly worried about my wife’s health. What’s next for her? Will they just try to kill her?”
“Ida is the exact reason we couldn’t tell too many Aurors,” Draco added, “Although we never imagined you or her would be involved in Kareach.”
From the front of the room, Brayan said, “Now Potter, I know you are having a big day with the article release. But I can’t grant you a free pass to talk in my morning briefing, no matter how much you’ve earned it!”
“Harry!” Draco yelled, grabbing his arm and yanking Harry around to face him again, “You need to tell me!”
“Clearly you’re not here to tell me how good my pottery is,” Draco stated, “So just get out with it.”
“It’s only for your protection,” Harry reassured, sitting down in a chair a couple feet away from the edge of the bubble around Seb’s bed.
“This is actually what Oliver has been waiting for. The weather has been so nice lately he feels we haven’t had substantial storm practice,” she reached for Lily as the three-year-old clambered into her lap, “And unfortunately, he isn’t wrong. Do you remember that one quidditch game we had third year where it downpoured the entire time? Well, of course you do,” she said, looking slightly embarrassing, no doubt thinking of the dementors that brought the match to a screeching halt, “But anyway, we somehow had a match with weather worse than that last year. Oliver wants to make Puddlemere as weather friendly as possible to avoid another mishap.”
“What?” Harry said. He knew Draco well enough to know the gasp wasn’t for something bad, but for something surprising, He followed his fiance’s wide gaze to the dance floor.
“No, I’m not!” Dom declared, “Uncle Ron said he would give me a galleon if I cheered for the Cannons!”
Sure enough, after a moment of compressing darkness, he reappeared in Draco’s vibrant living room. Regret came slamming into him; what was he doing here? After the whirlwind of feelings he had just experienced, there was no way it was a wise idea for him to show up in Draco’s apartment, while his wife waited for him back at the hospital. What if Draco wasn’t even home? Harry had assumed he had gone home because he wasn’t in any of the conference rooms, but he didn’t know that for sure. He could be somewhere with his son, or at the pub, or Merlin knows where. Harry was considering apparating back to St. Mungos when a sliver of white came scurrying across the floor towards him.
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, rushing towards him and enveloping him in a hug that was all soft brown curls.
Draco nodded. Harry could tell he was relieved to see a room that wasn’t decorated like his childhood home. Aviary turned to Harry,
“I suppose it’s always an emergency, with the urgency of our investigation,” Malfoy commented, “But I don’t have any new crucial information. I’ve just been home alone all day with thoughts and speculations swarming through my brain, and you are the only one I can talk to.”
Seb smiled softly and leaned over to kiss Aviary. The two of them had begun dating, ironically, after Seb had come over to Harry’s house during a party to ask Harry if he wanted to give a relationship a shot. After the initial awkwardness as Harry explained he was dating Draco now, Seb and Aviary had gotten to talking. Now, here they were, about two years later, more in love than ever.
“My name is Harry!” Harry nearly screamed at Malfoy, causing a woman pushing her child in a stroller to speed up as she walked past them, “Harry fucking Potter!”
“Victore sent a letter just yesterday telling us how much she loves Charms. That was always my strongest subject as well, so it was wonderful to hear she was a natural. Of course, I was taking it at Beauxbatons, but the classes I attended at Hogwarts were just as good! I only hope she makes some more friends soon. Teddy is a wonderful boy, but a young girl needs to learn to make new friends she hasn’t known since birth…”
The two locked eyes for a second before Draco looked down at his book and began to read in his usual focused manner. Is this what Ron felt? Looking at Hermione all those years? Admiring what a powerful determination and refusal to give up could do? Harry shook himself. Draco wasn’t his to admire. Ron and Hermione always belonged to each other, despite their weak attempts at romance before seventh year. He and Draco weren’t that. Harry had a wife who was supposed to be the Hermione to his Ron. She had been, for years. Or at least he thought she had been. But regardless of everything, he couldn’t sit here and admire the amazingness that was Draco Malfoy when he had a wife and kids at home. Suddenly he felt selfish and, well, just terrible.
“Let’s begin,” Malfoy pulled out a quill and began to write, “How long were you an Auror before deciding on a career change?”
She looked up, not at all alarmed as she spotted Harry and pointed her wand to remove the charm. He watched as she walked over and knelt down beside him, her long black hair framing her face in ragged strands. Harry couldn’t imagine how long it had been since she had left the office.
“We all did,” Aviary spat, “I’ve worked side by side with her for the past couple months. Hearing her voice… speaking to Gani…” she trailed off as her face went still with fear and anger.
“Really?” Harry said, thinking immediately of Malfoy spending hours pouring over a binder that said otherwise.
“Ron,” Hermione chided, “being in Slytherin does not make you a bad person! What if Rose was in Slytherin? What would you say then?”
“Because I’m a wanker,” Harry held his arms up, “That’s just it. I’m a mess who’s dealing with a fuck ton of stuff at the moment, and I’m not handling it well. It has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with me.”
“It means life is a fucking disaster, but that doesn’t mean everything is terrible,” Padma shrugged, “There’s a good in the center of everything. You just have to get through the shitty parts.”
Harry was sure none of the women were buying this (although it wasn’t really a lie. Harry had felt quite queasy), but thankfully none of them went on to say anything else.
Harry squirmed a little at the term “wife”. It felt wrong to still associate him with Ginny when they both had spent months thinking of other men. But he re-engaged in the conversation to hear Seamus explain how he was not going to root for either of the teams, as he respected both for their hard work and dedication to the league.
“So you cheated?!” Harry exclaimed, rage suddenly taking over him, “Do you know the feelings of longing and confusion I’ve been having lately! Do you know how many times I’ve wanted to cheat, but didn’t! I was torturing myself while you were going behind my back. No, our family’s back!”
Smirking, Harry made his way to the table. He sat down in the chair across from Malfoy, who was so immersed in one of his binders that he didn’t even acknowledge Harry’s presence.
“I knew it was a bad idea for you to befriend him! And know you are throwing away your whole family just for him!” Ron yelled. Before Harry knew what was happening, Ron shoved him. Harry landed on the floor, shocked.
“He was. I had to fight back my angry retorts after he insulted Ginny,” Harry said, hoping to convey this was the main reason he was upset. Not the fact that Draco and Blaise were probably more than friends and there was nothing he could do about it or about the fact that he cared for some reason. I mean, he didn’t like… no, he didn’t. He was straight. He was married. End of internal discussion.
“Well, you may as well. There’s no one else who understands the situation quite as I do,” Harry pointed out.
“Only to prevent anything bad from getting out about him!” Blaise snapped, “We could bloody get on without his cover-up money!”
Harry shot a look of mock offense at her. “I don’t do that!” he said indignantly, “Just tell me whatever it is that you three need me to weigh in on.”
“It really is a shame,” another voice Harry knew all too well came from somewhere behind slowly. He watched helplessly as Ida Reyes made her way into the room to join her cousin.
Harry smiled back and tried to ignore the small pang in his heart at Caser’s mention of his inspiration. He wished he had had parents to look up to and help influence his future decisions. Sometimes he felt so incapable of figuring out what to do with his life. Becoming a Healer was the first decision he felt that he really made for himself, and the choice had been more liberating than he could have ever imagined.
“That’s not what Granger-Weasley said when I talked to him,” Draco countered, “He said you haven’t wanted a meeting and that’s why we’ve been researching separately. Or at least I have. I don’t know what you’ve been doing the past week.”
Harry watched for a second, relief finding him like an old friend. Dean would be fine with Healer Patrick, he was sure of it. He watched them for a second and then hurried to see who else he could help. He moved to help another trainee control a healer having a seizure when Draco appeared next to him. Harry refused to let himself focus on anything but the man having the seizure as Draco helped with his own spells. Draco had been studying the Imperius attacks for so long that he no doubt knew exactly how to help. The man began to stop flailing, just as a Healer came and leivitated him away. Harry now looked at Draco, who was frantically searching for another person to help, desperation in his eyes. Then all of a sudden Draco was gone. Everything was gone. The room had gone dark, so dark he couldn’t see his own hands in front of him. Then, as suddenly as the lights went out, flashes of green began to head towards them. Harry used the brief flashes of light to see Draco and push him to the ground. Harry’s whole body was stricken with terror as the green lights continued to flash over him.
“Of course!” Lavender assured, reaching across the armchair to touch Luna’s arm, “Why wouldn’t we? All of you girls are our closest and oldest friends!”
Ron dropped the blanket he had grabbed for Hermione and stared at Harry with a look of complete petrification on his face. Hermione, however, didn’t look nearly as fearful.
“Ida?” he called into the seemingly empty house. Ida could be anywhere without leaving a trace. She was a stealth expert, something Harry had been eternally grateful when she was his partner. Now it came off a bit eerie, to tell the truth.
“Harry!” she said abruptly, creating a path through the paperwork with her wand so that Harry could walk through the room and sit down besides her.
“Shambles?” Harry inquired, “I read your article, and you're a bloody good reporter. Why would your career be in shambles?”
He turned around and saw Luna. She was dressed in the most elaborate Christmas sweater he had ever seen (while Harry only had a Christmas tree on the front of his sweater, Luna was basically a living three dimensional tree, strung with lights and singing ornaments). She walked down the steps toward him and then waved her wand over her sweater dress to make it flatten against her so she could sit down properly next to Harry.
“Perhaps, Harry,” Ginny said, “Whatever happened, he was conscious enough to reverse Ida’s curse without us noticing. We were all so focused on you and Draco that we weren’t paying attention to Ida and Aries.”
“Except for Reyes,” Draco put in bitterly, “For the coach of one of the best teams in England, that man cannot play. Just watching him yesterday brought tears to my eyes.”
Harry turned to look at her shining eyes, “I’m happy you’ve become to figure out your full self,” Ginny spoke softly but strongly, “I’m honestly shocked. I can’t say I had any idea. But I do know that I support anything that will make you happy.”
The group of five eventually made their way across the room and found seats (Seamus and Dean made plenty of chairs whenever they invited people over). Hermione had taken a chair in between him and Luna after she gave Harry a hug. He couldn’t help but notice she seemed agitated and a little morose.
“It’s, well, a rumor,” Harry relented, “A good one at that, but it really is a rumor. One that’s spreading around the hospital. I just thought the Aurors should take it seriously. But,” he finally looked Ginny in the eye, “I took it way too far. I’m sorry.”
A pang in his stomach reminded him that Draco was the same way. But just because Draco’s changed doesn’t mean his friend truly has.
Before Ron or Hermione could answer, there was a knock at the door. Harry went to open the door. He stumbled backwards when he saw who it was.
“Are you implying we have no control over our children?” Harry joked, “Because while you may be right, let’s just remember that your daughter just took off running as soon as you arrived.”
Harry held his tongue on the numerous questions he had been forming about Malfoy’s life and answered the question, “I went into Auror training in ‘99. The training took about two years to complete. This year would’ve been my ninth year in the field.”
Draco was so fixated on his writing he didn’t even glance at Harry as he approached. Harry braced himself and then gave Draco a small tap on his arm. Even that sent electricity up Harry’s arm. If something this small gave Harry an unexplained chill, how was he going to get through the next week? Or day?
“A family operation! Of course!” Aviary shouted, anger now taking over her timid silence, “They took two jobs they knew wouldn’t associate them or their family with bigotry, and they hid! For years,” She looked from Draco to Harry, “You two could be right. This has to be much more than just Ida and her cousin. How else would she have pulled all of this off without blowing her cover as an Auror? I cannot believe her! Pretending to care and then going to plan new attacks!”
“Harry fucking Potter,” he said, shaking his head. He ran a hand through his long, jet (change) black hair and sighed, “It didn’t have to be this way, you know. Fucking half blood,” he turned around to face Draco, “And you! A pureblood! You could have survived nicely in this new order.”
“Move, Harry,” a strong voice commanded. Harry looked up to see Healer Patrick, her face set determinedly as she began to cast spells on Dean. He watched as Dean’s flailing subsided enough for Healer Patrick to use the levitation charm to move him up off the floor and out of the canteen.
Seb began to talk again, but Harry hardly heard him. His attention was drawn to another sudden flash of bright light as someone’s hair caught the light. As the person in question came into focus on the other side of the bar, Harry almost considered leaving on the spot. Draco was making his way towards the bar. Harry didn’t think he had seen him, or he was really good at hiding it. Harry watched as Draco sat down at a bar stool. He tried desperately to look away as Draco ordered a drink (from what Harry could tell, it was a firewhiskey) and took long swings in a solemn silence, all by himself. Harry watched as he finished off the glass and turned in his seat to signal a bartender over to him. Draco turned just enough to have a view of Harry. Draco froze, his face unreadable as he looked back at Harry.
With that, he threw open the hospital room door and ran to Hermione’s bedside. He then threw his arms around Hermione and Rose.
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Harry said, “They like you. I think it’s mainly because they like Scorpius, but we’ll have to take what we can get.”
Harry looked back at Seb in the light of the bar. Seb poured another shot of whiskey and tilted his head back. Harry watched as the light caught his hair and made him glow in his own little halo. Then he looked back at Harry with that ridiculous grin on his face, the one that lit up everything. Harry looked away quickly and took another long and fast swing from his own glass. For the moment, drawing his thoughts in alcohol seemed like the best solution.
Tonight was the night he planned to tell Ron and Hermione the truth. A week ago, he had told his kids, which had been perhaps the worst thing he had ever had to do. James had barely talked to either Ginny or Harry all week long, while Harry had found Al crying in his room multiple times. Lily was too little to understand any of what was going on, so she was the only one in the house blissfully unaware that the situation had changed drastically. As of right now, the five of them were planning on living in the same house for awhile as to not throw too much at the kids all at once. Ginny had talked to him; she planned to move in with Blaise after this period. Harry had been shocked at this. He hadn’t realized their relationship had reached that level while Harry and Ginny were still married. He didn’t quite know how to handle his wife falling in love with another man for months while they were married, even if he had been falling for Draco. That situation was completely different, anyhow. Blaise and Ginny were mutually in love. As for Harry, he liked Draco an unhealthy amount and Draco seemed to want nothing to do with him, although his kiss had said otherwise. But that wasn’t important tonight. Harry and Ginny were going over to the Weasley- Granger household with their kids to catch up and break the news to them. He was also planning on monitoring Hermione the entire night. He had been over multiple times in the past week to make sure she was remaining stable, but she had become upset with him when he had tried to stay with her for the entire day. She kept reminding him that Draco said she would be fine (he had even given her some of his research to prove it. Harry hated how sweet that was). Regardless, Harry wanted to see for himself that Hermione seemed unaffected, and an evening at their house was a perfect way to do that. It was also going to be an evening of emotional support, as Ron and Hermione planned to tell the family about the pregnancy at Sunday brunch while Ginny and Harry were planning on talking about their divorce the same day. Yes, Ron and Hermione didn’t know yet about the divorce (well, Hermione probably did), but Harry was banking on their responses being supportive.
Malfoy froze as an angry look flashed across his sharp features, “That’s not your business,” he snapped, trying to keep his voice even but failing due to the large amount of alcohol he had consumed.
“We’ll just have to wait and see whose team comes out on top, won’t we?” Ginny sneered, “And I wouldn’t bet on a team captained by the biggest wanker I have yet to meet.”
Harry opened his eyes and pulled away abruptly. He looked immediately towards where Draco was standing. Draco was staring at him, the same unreadable expression seemingly on his face. But Harry knew him too well. Even with the distance between them, he could see the sadness around his eyes, the slight shaking of his hand. He was upset.
“What?” Harry whispered back, shocked. “But we haven’t had an incident for months! The extreme safety measures were lifted from Diagon Alley!”
Harry grinned at his friend. He could feel his eyes shining with tears that threatened to spill over at any moment, “We really could.”
Laughing, Harry made his way with the rest of the group towards the living room. Much of the regular crowd was already there: Parvati, Lavender, Neville, Hannah and Luna were all seated either on the couch or in armchairs. Harry sat down on one of the couches next to Neville and said hello to everyone in the room.
Harry turned around to see Draco walking quickly towards him, any concern gone from his face as he reached to grab the mug from his hands.
Harry turned to her, his blood now coursing through his body at an unprecedented pace, “That’s where Blaise was sitting! Of course!”
Laughing, Harry and the rest of the group made their way towards the group of kids, gathering their own and heading towards the chairs arranged in arches in the center of the lawn.
But before Malfoy could answer, a ringing sound emitted from his pocket. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small flip phone.
“Draco, they’re trying to kill you!” he whispered fiercely as sounds of yelling and fighting commenced around them, “Did you see how many killing curses were shot at us immediately? It’s a miracle we are alive! I can’t let you leave this shield!”
Harry stepped into the fireplace and appeared fully in Ida’s living room. He glanced down at the papers she had been working on and noticed long lists similar to the ones has Draco made. One page had a large sketch of the quidditch pitch, labeled with places where the vendors were located and where most of the attacks happened.
“What?” for someone who had recently rejected Harry and called their kiss a mistake, he didn’t seem upset. He was concerned, which Harry could not deal with right now. Not with the news he was about to give.
“The issue isn’t Diagon Alley this time,” Ida looked around again, then continued, “This attack didn’t happen in Diagon Alley. It happened at a muggle shop in Yorkshire.”
To Harry’s surprise, she didn’t look angry. She looked perfectly calm, sitting up in bed with her arms wrapped around her knees.
Draco nodded, seemingly processing this, “So you don’t want to cut me out of the investigation and just work with Padma and Ron?”
Savant looked hesitant, but he nodded in agreement, “What you are both saying has merit. We will bring Zabini in tomorrow.”
“For his safety!” Ron reiterated, “He has no Auror training. What he is investigating is extremely dangerous. As Aurors we can’t risk it.”
Seb shook his head, “No, you’re not imposing. And don’t worry about not contacting me lately. I can’t imagine what it’s been like, working at Mungos during these times! I completely understand not having time for a new friend.”
“Draco,” Harry breathed, choosing to ignore Draco’s anger, “These are all incredible. You are truly talented!”
“Well, I’m certainly not going to steal someone else’s partner, now am I? And anyway, I reckon the best way into the field is being thrown in with an expert,” He beamed at Ida. “I am of course, referring to you.”
Harry gave a stiff laugh, “I was actually just down on the Ground Floor today. Both Reyes and Zabini are in the hospital.”
Draco laughed and shook his head, “Even when I’m trying to confess my love for you you’re a bloody wanker.”
“Because she’s terrified, and I can’t blame her,” Ida stated, “She is a muggleborn. Her and Remmins are some of the only muggleborn Aurors who haven’t been poisoned yet.”
“What the bloody hell?” Ron accused, “You’re friends with Draco? Since when? The last time I checked you were bloody livid to have an interview with him?”
“Harry,” Ida said, grabbing on to his arm, “Of course I don’t want to say any of this. I want to believe Malfoy is good. But I wasn’t raised under the influence of prejudice and hatred. My parents let me make my own views and ideals from the time I was a young girl. I don’t rebel against their beliefs, just their expectations of me. They wanted me out of the Auror field, they thought it was no reasonable job for a young girl trying to make her way in a new society. I believe that people have the strength to make their own decisions and fight for what they want to do. But I just don’t think I can believe that Malfoy’s views he once clearly and openly shared with his parents are now all gone. Most likely he wants to re-establish his place in England as an admirable part of society. And, I’m sorry Harry, but you would be his best way to do that. You are the single most important person to most of England.”
Draco winced, “Are you upset? I should have let you tell her. But I felt so guilty with everything that I wanted Molly to know from me that I had nothing but good intentions.”
Harry hesitated. He looked into his son's face: innocent, curious. Wanting the truth from someone he trusted. Harry owed him that much.
She stopped, thankfully, before the blood could consume Draco’s whole face. Ida turned now to her cousin, a question forming on her dark red lips:
“Your interview?” Malfoy looked exasperated, “That was over two weeks ago. I published it yesterday, for goodness sake. Do you think you’re getting  follow-up? This soon?”
“You’d be surprised,” Seb said, “And I could have said the same about you, Harry. At least when I first met you. But the more I’ve spent time with you, the more I’ve realized that you are one of the people who needs cheering up the most because you’ve spent your whole life cheering up everyone else around you.”
So when Seb contacted him one day right after a practically hard shift (one of his patients was not only in the room Blaise had been in days earlier, but he was both gay and blond) and asked to go out for tea, he had taken the offer gladly. He arranged for them to meet in a more modern wizarding tea shop, so he would not be at all reminded of Smith and Waltons. Through all of this he was aware that he was acting as if he was going through a break-up, and he supposed in a way it felt like one.
“I told you he was tolerable now,” Padma said proudly, looking at Ron, “And you told me it wasn’t possible!”
