Draco’s fingers twitch, and he can feel the heat creep up his face.
At the age of forty-two, Draco doesn’t like to think he would be this susceptible to
has got him this hot and bothered and he doesn’t make an effort to. He doesn’t have to think of any of that right now; just the fact that Harry’s hand has slid down, and the way it has found its way onto his arse, holding onto the flesh and squeezing it merrily.
“It wouldn’t fit on a button, so I had to rethink it.”
“No magic, remember? It’s an adventure.” Harry smiles, moving to sit down on the bed and kick off his shoes in a way that’s both inelegant and stupidly sexy.
“Sounds to me like you’re jealous of your baby sister…” Rose teases him and Albus goes red and grumbles a “
“Let’s go leave our bags in the room, then.” Harry beams at him and the kids all engage in more excited chatter.
Draco can feel the heat rise on his face and gets busy with his own clothes, peering at Harry from time to time and drinking in his form in shy sips.
It was two years since Harry got divorced and exactly ten days since he and Draco got together when Hermione asked, and twelve days
Harry’s eyes are closed when Draco turns his head and closes the space between them, kissing him gently. It’s soft but not hesitant, the way their lips touch and then the way their lips part to deepen the kiss.
“You’re gonna be the death of me, Potter.” Draco laughs softly again as a rush of deep affection surges through him, the feeling mixing with the spark of Harry’s wandless magic that washes over them, clearing everything away.
would fill his chest with dread, was it given the time to.
, something Draco had never heard of before one night when they all had way too much Chianti and risotto, and Ginevra decided to share their most recent
Harry laughs softly at that, but doesn’t comment on how Draco’s using magic again. Instead, he holds his own pyjamas out for Draco to Charm them, even though Draco is pretty sure that they wouldn’t hold up against too strong of a spell, since Harry’s sleeping clothes consist of a decrepit pair of flannel trousers, a threadbare vest and a bumpy woolen jumper with an H on it.
as he’d tried to convey to Astoria by bewildered blinking only.
Draco looks around with genuine curiosity, taking in the modern setting of the room. It’s nothing extravagant, but still spacious and comfortable. While the children’s room looks over the garden, theirs has a better view of the city lights. The grey afternoon seems to have dissipated into a clearer night sky, though it’s still humid and there are no stars to be seen.
Harry’s flame burns, and even though it still feels like some kind of cosmic joke, Draco knows
. It’s all too much.
And Draco doesn’t know what happens, how it happens, when it happens, but his cardinal rule is forgotten. He keeps waking up in Potter’s bed, eating ripe fruit off Potter’s fingers, complaining about the shit instant coffee until one day there’s a tall cork-lidded-jar on Potter’s kitchen counter full of fragrant coffee beans.
Draco drags him over to his sofa, pushes him down. It’s odd, really, this Potter who doesn’t fight back. It’s odd because there’s no loud music, and they’re not in a rush to get off in a dark corner of a club, surrounded by a mass of bodies and lit by a kaleidoscope of dancing colours. And it’s odd because it’s out of place. Because Potter is in his house, begging for Draco.
pleases Draco greatly and he kisses Potter back properly, hands sliding around Potter’s waist. A little voice on the back of his head reminds him he shouldn’t, Potter isn’t sober.
Draco finishes washing his hands and steps away from Potter, taking a deep breath as he dries them.
I can tell Draco is in a mood. I can
And by taking his side on a wild fancy, I am part of it. And I’m in deep, even though we have known each other for no more than twenty minutes.
Draco remains firmly seated, measuring his options. This is not what they’d been planning for for months.
The cake is forgotten. Harry, and the blade in the box, are dragged into the bedroom with an urgency Draco has never felt in his life.
And I just can’t stop trying to picture it. Much like Bill and Fleur’s wedding, much like Teddy’s birth, what it would have been like, to do that, to plan that, on the brink of the war. I can’t stop wondering who was there — and how whoever was there is now dead, except for me. Was Remus there, with Sirius? Were they holding hands, happy, completely oblivious of what the future held? Or had the cracks of suspicion started to form between the Marauders, already? Had Pettigrew been there? Had the traitorous rotten bastard got to witness this special moment of my life?  Quite possibly the last I had with the people who were meant to be my extended family?
“Fuck,” Potter practically moans and Draco wonders if he’s drunker than he thought he was because there is no way this is actually happening.
Potter has the audacity to look sheepish. He runs his hand through his mess of a mane and Draco wants nothing but to lick him, right there on all that exposed skin, navel to jaw.
before — more times than he probably should have— in the locker rooms at work. But never like this. Never this close. He mourns the lack of the small pearls around Potter’s neck and decides he’ll have to make do with what he has, letting his open palm travel over Potter’s abs and chest to finally settle low on his neck, squeezing gently. Potter gasps and a feeling of euphoria settles comfortably over Draco, just from the simple fact that he knows what Potter likes.
He doesn’t think of the bodies inside. The questions he didn’t ask Harry.
He smiles up at me, and Scorpi blinks her eyes open too and it makes my stomach flutter how they look so similar. I find myself looking at her and her brother all the time and thinking “
He finds a pile of letters at the bottom of his Hogwarts trunk he hasn’t touched for years, addressed to everyone he has hurt. An endless list of names, a bigger list of sins. He wishes he didn’t remember every single wrong thing he’s ever done. He can’t fault his brain though, that’s a lot of memories to retain. There’s nothing left of what once was his childhood bedroom after Draco is done with his letters. It’s often this way, when Draco picks at the little things, when he can’t control the fire from catching, from being carried by the wind to the dried wood of everything around him. In a blink of an eye, it’s all gone.
He’s not a man, though. Not really. He’s a beautiful and inviting smile, he’s wet skin and a sparkling scaly tail, as shimmery and as bright as his eyes. I wonder if his singing would get me to do his bidding, get me to follow him into any and every situation. But there’s no singing. There’s only his bright smile, the kindness in his eyes as he asks me about my life, about who I am.
He never liked the feeling, ever since Second Year. The burn of the potion itself, the discomfort of his skin changing.
It is simple. I don’t eat until we’re back. I know some people do, but it feels too early. I may be awake, but my stomach isn’t. Tea keeps me going until we’re back and once the fish is passed to the women to take to the market, I come back home and finally make myself a coffee and thick slices of buttery toast.
I’m only half listening (something about a bonfire, sunrise, sunset, juniper, water, I don’t know) until she fishes the two little sets of robes out of the basket. I do pay attention — it’s impossible not to with the way Narcissa Malfoy speaks (much like her son), but I’m really only half there. I’m only half there most times, these days —
Draco doesn’t know what his face does then, but he knows what his dick does — going from 0 to 100 in no time whatsoever.
, like
Draco nods and watches as Potter peels them down slowly, like he’s unwrapping a very precious present.
Tickets finally purchased, they filed into the cinema, finding their seats in the dim light. Draco had assumed that Teddy would sit in between the two of them, but he insisted that the seat on the end of the three they had selected was the best placed, and he absolutely would not sit anywhere else. Doing as they were told, Harry and Draco settled in the remaining two seats, Harry next to Teddy and Draco on the end. The lights dimmed further as they sat down, and the trailers began to play on the screen. Teddy was immediately entranced, his expression comical with his wide eyes and open mouth. The trailers managed to hold Draco’s attention for a while, soaking up the details of Muggle life that he saw depicted in the adverts and film trailers. But then Harry moved slightly, and Draco lost all interest in what was happening on the screen.
‘I’m sorry,’ Harry said, so quietly it was nearly a whisper. ‘For doing it, and for taking so long to apologise. I had no idea what the spell did but that doesn’t mean I should have used it. I—’
They’d slowed to a complete halt, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat as Malfoy quietly confessed his hopes. Malfoy was looking directly at him, not shying away from the intimacy of their conversation, and for a moment Harry was sure that everything he was feeling was showing on his face.
‘I should let you rest,’ Malfoy said, glancing down at the watch on his wrist. ‘It’s late.’
; that wizards, especially pure-bloods, learned from the mistakes of the war and realised that they weren’t better than anyone else. In fact, thinking that made them worse. And Draco would personally be very happy if all their traditions and misguided beliefs died out completely, vanishing forever just as Voldemort had. Giving Teddy these lessons would go against that promise completely, and certainly wouldn’t be what Professor Lupin and Tonks would have wanted for their child.
‘Poor Andromeda is starting to struggle with Edward,’ Narcissa began, Draco groaning internally as he braced himself for the guilt trip that was surely coming. ‘He somehow stuck himself to his bed on Tuesday morning because he didn’t want to wake up and go to school. Andromeda couldn’t get him out for several hours; she was beside herself with worry.’
‘I think I spent about a year and a half, maybe even longer, I’m not sure, doing not very much at all. I half-tried to sort out Grimmauld Place, but there was so much to do it was overwhelming. I spent a lot of time walking around London, or Apparating out to the countryside and just walking for hours through fields. I think I just needed to switch my brain off completely, you know?’ Malfoy nodded when Harry paused.
Harry agreed—it’s not like he wanted to work late tonight, and it certainly wouldn’t go down well with Ginny—and they quickly got to work. Curse-breaking was intense, focused work, and Harry was soon sweating as he tried to concentrate on channelling his magic into breaking the threads of magic that bound the curse to each item. They remained mostly silent as they worked, both of them lost in concentration, only occasionally calling on the other to hold a protection charm or provide an extra wand for particularly complicated bits of magic. It surprised Harry, how quickly he settled into the routine of working with Malfoy, how soon it felt just like working with any other curse-breaker.
‘Oh, so you can give but you can’t take, Malfoy? Should have thought of that when you stopped sucking me off earlier.’
Twenty minutes later, they were settled at a small table in one corner of the tearoom. It had taken Harry quite a while to navigate the stairs, his hip protesting at the unusual movement, and he gratefully accepted the cup of tea and slice of cake that Malfoy handed to him, in desperate need of nourishment after the effort. Nearly all the tables in the tearoom were unoccupied due to the late hour. Their only company was an older couple talking softly near the door, their hands joined over the table, and a young man sitting alone, an uneaten sandwich sat on a plate in front of him. He was facing them, and he looked exhausted, on the verge of falling asleep where he sat.
As the aftershocks wrack through his body, Harry picks up Draco’s hand, bringing it to his mouth. He licks off the remnants of his come that still cling to Draco’s fingers, and then drops kisses all over his hand, trying to wordlessly express how much he loves what they do to him.
‘I wouldn’t do that again if I were you,’ Malfoy said cooly, looking down at the chart he was holding. ‘You’ve broken multiple bones, including your hip, several ribs, and your left arm.’
‘You better not flake like you have the past few weeks,’ she said.
‘Do we know anything about the owner?’
making him loopy when he suddenly thought how pretty Malfoy’s eyes were. ‘Are you sure you still don’t want any?’
Draco climbs onto Potter, thighs against thighs and repeats the words he said that night, a year back. “Don’t come,” and Potter’s head falls back, exposing his throat to Draco. Draco pushes Potter’s jumper and t-shirt up and helps him get out of them, before chucking them on the floor.
When Hogwarts was divided into four kingdoms, Gryffindor dealt with magic. Legend says that when Riddle killed the Potters and took over Hogwarts, some Gryffindors managed to escape, make it to other kingdoms under fake names. Some died, or were sent out to Azkaban. The majority is said to be in hiding, to have used their magic to join the fae, or the merpeople, the centaurs or the dragons.
“Do you want me to show you what it does?” He asks.
“Hello, Potter.” And then, because curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought it back, he asks, “What’s in your bag?”
Potter moans at the threat, but lowers his hips back down and lets Draco resume his earlier job of slowly fucking himself on Potter’s cock.
The gate creeks ominously — open, then closed — and Draco’s polished shoes echo in the silence of the cemetery, against the old stone of the stairs that lead to the corner where Harry is. Draco doesn’t know what to expect, but it’s definitely not the tall figure standing in front of the grave.
Draco’s eyes fill with tears as the gold rim on the hourglass cracks under Harry’s spell. The last Time-Turner.
“We don’t have to take two three month old babies to bloody Stonehenge at four in the morning, do we?”
“You want to, but you’re not going to. You’re going to get on your knees like the pretty thing you are, and you’re gonna blow me.”
“It was good seeing you, Harry,” he says.
“Mine was here too,” she says, in a serious tone, as she smooths out the fabric of the robes now lying on the table. “These are the Black Family robes. Every one of us wore this set. Regulus was the last one.”
He’s got Scorpi on his lap, all milk-drunk and sleepy-eyed, her sweeting little curls matching Draco’s perfectly. And Jamie is in the Moses basket on the floor, fast asleep — how I wish the precious bastard had been like that a mere five hours ago — looking like an angel.
“Do we?!”
There’s nothing stopping Potter from touching himself, but he isn’t, and the thought that Potter is here, moaning and grunting around his cock, just from the feeling of Draco in his mouth and Draco’s hand in his hair, does him in.
Now Draco watches Harry kiss her. She looks at Draco after and giggles. And he watches Harry take her apart on their bed. Watches her pant and grab at the sheets and say Harry’s name as she comes.
Of all the values and virtues of a man of the sea that were instilled in me as a child,
“It looks like a lightsabre,” Harry says, smiling.
And when the waves come rushing in — tide high and unrelenting — and he misses the buzz of the drugs, it’s into Potter’s bed that he sweats and weeps.
“Er—” I honestly don’t know what to tell her.
“We need to stop doing this. This is no way to take a holiday,” Harry says, but sighs contentedly when Draco slides off him and starts taking his trousers off.
The first time Draco sees Harry’s tombstone is nearly twelve years after the funeral. The service was on an unbearably hot day, everyone sweating in their black robes. What is now an impressive grey slab stone was but a mound of dry crumbly dirt that a very small Scorpius — unaware of the unspeakable loss that had just shaken his family — tried to put in his mouth by the fistful.
I help him dive back into the water and promise to meet him at sundown, when there are no boats around anymore. He reaches for my face, a gentle caress on my cheek with a wet hand – something I’ve never gotten from anyone, other than my own mother.
Draco lets his hands explore, going straight for Potter’s peachy bum, pulling him closer into himself. Draco is on the verge of coming already, the friction of denim against denim and his trapped cock against the heat of Potter’s turning out to be too much.
I remember Narcissa’s words,
“Make me feel good, Malfoy,” Potter says, and kisses him. Draco lets him. “Please, Malfoy,” he says again when they break apart. “Like you did that night.”
“Are you?” He asks.
It’s definitely the sudden realisation that an infant Sirius once wore the robes in front of me, that the very ritual we’re planning happened to him, in this very house, in the garden he left to me.
To anyone outside the small bubble of anger that is Harry Potter, the pure, dripping anxiety of Ron Weasley’s rapidly diminishing patience, and Mavis’ worried elevated heartbeat, it happens almost in slow motion.
“Fuck,” he sighs. “Please.”
We speak at the same time.
I know which he’ll hold against me for longer.
The last time, Draco had only hooked his pants just under his balls and let Potter go to town. The look on Potter’s face this time is one hundred percent worth getting fully undressed for.
It’s early, Draco feels like he’s had enough sleep for once and his boyfriend is on top of him snogging the living daylights out of him first thing in the day. So it’s not really his fault that all blood rushes South quite dramatically.
There’s something very deep in me telling me I can trust him. I can trust him, whoever he is. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, the most stunning creature my eyes have ever had the pleasure to look at. I didn’t know it back then, I didn’t know it when my mother (my poor mother, no doubt waiting for me at the harbour, waiting for the fish she’ll take to the market) held my hand and taught me how to do magic. When my mother kissed my hair and told me it had to be our secret, forever.
it — and squeezing the sides of Potter’s throat with his hand.
Mavis points one shaky hand at the note on the table, which is the first red flag — Mavis is
Draco’s eyes scrutinise the small room. He touches the wood of the doorframe with a sudden wave of nostalgia, as salty as the sea he can hear raging outside.
Potter bites his lip, a row of white straight teeth sinking under his bottom lip with such force Draco leans forward and runs his fingers over Potter’s mouth until he relaxes his mouth again.
It was learning how to be numb, how to not feel, how to keep everyone out of his mind and away from his thoughts, it was the paralysing terror of crawling around in the shadows, the bone-deep dread of dropping leftover bread rolls on the floor by the bars on the dungeon and kicking them swiftly into the other side, where they kept his classmates. It was sneaking a blanket or two down and saying to himself, “If they find out…”
Harry Potter feels like a violent storm brewing. Heaving and roiling above Draco, leaden and ready to burst, on a bright warm late summer’s day.
be good.”
“God, yes. Fuck. Draco, please,” Potter says, and Draco keeps pulling.
“Auror Potter,” Draco drawls. “I was starting to think no one would come to save me from danger.”
“He loved you. I know he did. I know because he told me, the Gryffindor idiot. All passion, no logic. I know it doesn’t mean much, I’m sorry you never got the time you deserved together. If I knew what I know now, I would have let you go so much earlier.” She lets go of his hand and takes a step back. “Bring Scorpius around for tea before you disappear again, Theo and I would love to see him. I’ll leave you some time with him before the cemetery closes.”
Potter tries to keep fucking into Draco, pants growing faster and lower and Draco says, “Don’t you dare come, Potter. Don’t you fucking dare. If you come I’m going to take this,” he holds up the sex toy from the bed, “and I’m going to use it on you until your brain is fried, until it smells like charred meat in this room.”
Grey eyes, white hair, pink lips. Silver scars all over — the fruit of your labour.
He doesn’t know how long it passes, but Potter is washing him and telling him he’s eating much better now, that it’s good he has an appetite again. That they can go running together when Draco has the strength, that they can go dancing if Draco doesn’t think that’s playing with temptation too much.
The fox runs alongside the wolf — like the stag and the dog, many moons ago.
“Okay,” he exhales.
May comes and goes again but this time he doesn’t forget. He’s in Paris, finding love in the way sugar cubes melt into absinthe, a shade of green that looks so familiar it hurts his heart, finding somewhere to forget in a man with a dreadful mustache that tickles him in all the right places, and Mustache’s friend too, who doesn’t have facial hair but has a wicked tongue and stamina for days.
“Harry.”
Harry can’t take his eyes off the portrait.
It turns out maybe having sex is something Draco and Potter are doing now. At least Draco thinks so when Potter corners him in the loos next to the bullpen, without even looking around to make sure they’re alone, and says, “Can I come to yours tonight?”
Then, a small sob. A kiss to his forehead. Draco doesn’t remember closing his eyes.
I can’t hide my smile. She does this a lot, my mother-in-law: referring to Draco like he’s some kind of misbehaving five year old. It brings me some stupid kind of joy every time it happens.
Potter likes it. Draco doesn’t know why he’s so surprised, Potter has liked most things so far. He’s not massively into being restrained, which Draco doesn’t mind. He’ll try anything though, Draco’s convinced.
A sudden, weird feeling numbs his mouth and he opens one eye in time to see Harry put his wand away.
If Draco tries really hard, he almost forgets where they are. If he ignores the feeling of the robes swishing around his ankles, the sound of dozens of people dancing around them too, the sound of the shocked whispers rippling through the room and the flash of cameras going off again and again and again, it’s almost their weekly routine. It’s almost as if the wireless is on and the french toast is frying away in the pan — the kitchen rich with the scents of cinnamon and honey — and Harry is barefoot, spinning him around the kitchen table, a warm firm hand under Draco’s t-shirt, against his bare back.
Tonight Harry speaks to the sea air, the salty wind. And he tells Draco about patterns of self-destruction and something his Muggle therapist calls PTSD. He talks about being worthy of being desired and experiencing joy. And that not everything that brings pleasure is inherently bad.
There’s movement: the fish, I presume. I take a moment to collect my strength and start to lift.
Draco is standing outside in the quiet, the cherry on his fag mimicking the orange glow of the setting sun.
There’s a fair chance this is my ticket out. I’d once dreamed I’d see Ravenclaw. I’d roam the halls of their schools, I’d experience the powdery feeling of chalk and the roughness of slate under my own fingertips. I’d learn history, magic, alchemy. Harry smiles at me from the water, like we know each other. Like we’ve always known each other. Like the way I feel inside (new, wild, terrifying) is reflected on him and multiplied tenfold. Ravenclaw is no longer my priority, because Harry tells me he will walk on two feet again – “just like you,” he says, “just less freckled and blonde” and I can’t help but laugh. Something tells me then that my future lies in Gryffindor and that same something hopes that it’s by Harry Potter’s side.
“I’m sure you had plenty of kneazles to pull down off trees and the like, Potter. Don’t worry,” he retorts.
It was confiding in a ghost, it was crying because the fear of failure was so intense he reckons he would have preferred to be dead then, it was the only person he believed was actually kind and pure and incapable of willingly inflicting pain on anyone slashing him open and leaving him for dead on a bathroom floor. Draco had looked at Snape, murmuring spell after spell over him, and he’d whispered, “I am dying.”
Draco finds him in the bathtub, clothes sticking to his body. It’s always like this when Harry’s magic flares up. Draco doesn’t ask — there's no point giving Harry excuses to say things like “dangerous” and “sick with magic.” Instead, Draco climbs into the tub and holds Harry until it passes.
“You do, don’t you? I can feel how hard you are, I can feel you humping my leg shamelessly, you dirty little slag.”
He looks up at Draco like he knows what he's thinking, like he wants Draco to be watching him, glasses still perched atop his nose, wonky and half fogged, choking on Draco’s dick.
The Boy Who Lived hates his many titles, but in moments like these, it’s very hard to forget about the scar on his forehead. Harry doesn’t go back to his desk, doesn’t grab his robes. He doesn’t put his cup of tea down, the liquid sloshing about as he shouts, splashing on the floor. He is lightning striking down a tree, and before anyone can stop him, he snatches the small note out of Ron’s hand as Mavis gasps, and disappears into thin air, leaving his mug to smash across the checkered floor.
May comes and goes for a third time and, as if it’s not a day of mourning, an owl drops an invite to Theo and Daphne’s wedding (and what a joyous occasion that will be), and Draco spends his hours fucking Blaise into oblivion, wondering who it hurts the most, after all. Is it arson if they’ve both asked to be burned?
He keeps grinding down, their pricks sliding together easily now they’re covered in oil.
There’s a fair chance this is my death sentence. My father’s, my mother’s. But faith is a funny thing. And I can’t help but believe this is what my mother prepared me for. What she wanted. Why she taught me the gift of magic despite it being the most dangerous thing we can do with Mr. Riddle watching our every move.
It’s not a chatty job, fishing. Or I suppose it is, for some people. It’s a quiet affair between myself, Vincent and Greg. We grew up together, been taken on the bigger boats, learning the ropes (both literally and figuratively). We share a polite, faint ‘good morning’ when I hop onto the Nimbus and that’s it for a few hours, apart from the occasional grunt when tying the cod ends, shooting our nets, readying the ice boxes.
The next day Draco walks into work to find out that Potter, along with four other Aurors, had been caught up in a nasty crossfire the night before. Potter had been the only one not to end up at St. Mungo’s with serious injuries. The feeling of uneasiness doesn’t leave him for the rest of the week.
Draco has done it before, he has. With people he probably trusted less, people who definitely shouldn’t have trusted him.
Potter lifts his hips up, meeting Draco halfway, hitting his prostate dead-on as he does.
He watches Draco lose it, fist a blur over his cock.
The last time Draco sees Harry’s tombstone is nearly twelve years after the funeral.
They’re not dating, not really. At least it hasn’t been discussed. Pansy says they are. Pansy may have a point. Thing is, they’ve not discussed it, so they aren’t.
“There was something else. There’s something… I don’t think it’s in your box.”
He remembers saying it after being thrown on his arse by the family Abraxan. He’d been very little, then. Five or six, maybe. He’d cried, big fat tears running down his face, and when his Mother finally managed to pull his tiny fists down and stop him from hiding his crying behind them, he’d announced, “Maman, I am dying.” She had assured him he very much wasn’t. They’d had scones with big heaped spoonfuls of clotted cream and raspberry jam in the garden and he’d soon forgotten about his fall.
Draco has to try very hard not to come in his pants, like last time. “Get on your knees,” he says, letting go of Potter and climbing off.
“You mean a christening, Draco!? We don’t fucking go to church!”
Despite it all – despite everything Riddle has done, all that has changed in Hogwarts – it seems that the Gryffindors are still well aware of what’s going on.
Waking up before the sun is up is unnatural. It’s unnatural at any stage of life, even if neither of my babies agree with the fact.
“Look where you’re going, Potter,” Draco spits.
It’s a short walk down to the harbour. The world isn’t yet awake, unless you count the gulls crying in the sky above me.
Draco makes a show of it. Unlacing his brown brogues, taking his belt of, pulling his shirt up and unbuttoning every single button slowly. When he’s down to his underwear, Potter is panting in front of him.
“Will you cut me?”
Draco is a flame burning through the stain of the war and the stench of death that seems to follow him everywhere. He doesn’t know at what point the spark turned into this all-consuming, ever-blazing mess that he is now. Sometime between being released from his dark and disgustingly damp holding cell in the first week of May without as much as a trial and Greg’s death a month later, he’d started burning.
Then: “Incarcerous.” He hears it — muffled but there. And after, “Fuck, Draco.”
“Jesus,” Harry says, as Draco rolls off him and kisses his temple. “I love you.”
Draco looks at him again, letting his eyes linger. Harry looks different than what he’s used to, but that doesn’t feel like a bad thing. He’s got his hair cut recently, and it’s shorter on the sides, though not enough to hide the sprinkle of grey at his temples. It suits him, Draco reckons, finally moving to remove his own coat.
Over the years they have been friends, he and Harry have talked about the difficult things. The six of them have talked about the war and Draco has apologised more times than he can count — to Harry and Hermione and Ronald and Ginevra and the Weasley family and everyone else he could think of. He apologised with words, but also with actions within the Ministry and multiple charities to change what he could, and with the family money he had no better use for once his father died and he became heir.
Harry looks at him for a couple of seconds, his eyebrows raised. It’s barely a moment, but it feels like it may be what ruins this all.
was the one to share something steamy.
It was slightly
“I’ve only been with Astoria. I’m not sure you know that.” Draco purses his lips and fights the wave of embarrassment that is caused by the weight he has just given the fact, more than the situation itself. “I have
“It doesn’t bother me that you’ve done things. I—” he exhales, and the whole thing sounds juvenile in his head. He’s in his forties and he’s got a son; he’s been married, and widowed,
“Tosser,” Draco scoffs fondly, shrugging off the button-down he’s finally gotten open and going for his trousers next.
Draco snorts. “No, I didn’t!”
“This isn’t the most romantic place,” Harry begins when he eventually pulls away.
“You were a right prick back then,” Harry smiles, shoves more chips in his mouth, and quickly looks around to see if any of the kids has heard him curse.
Draco Malfoy isn’t sure how this became his life.
“You’re all stiff,” Harry notes and once again there’s that tone to his voice.
“I’m sure you can transfigure something…” the youngest Potter says, and Draco isn’t too pleased about that arched eyebrow he sees. People may say he’s the spitting image of his father, but that’s a Ginevra expression, if Draco has ever seen one.
“I’m gonna get some juice, Mr. Malfoy. Do you want some?” the boy offers.
In fact, he’s been seeing them for over twenty years, since Astoria joined Hermione’s class at the Wizarding Law department’s school and they struck up an unexpected friendship that got the Malfoys invited to dinner parties they never thought they would be welcome at.
under his breath, which would be less noticeable if he didn’t pout, too.
. They’ve been on two official dates at stuffy restaurants and there’s been one snogging session after they ditched the third posh place for a trip to the little greasy-smelling joint near Harry’s cottage and ended up walking home. Kissing by the front door like teenagers before he made up an excuse and Apparated home hardly counted as intimacy, Draco told himself at that point, and wondered when (and
“I can change in the loo,” Harry offers, then, and Draco is surprised by how it sounds honest, and not like a dismissal.
“I’m sorry we’re late, uncle Harry, but we messed up setting the alarm clock!”
‘I was curious about sleeping with a woman and Harry was on board, so we talked to Jones, our Keeper, and she told us about this place… and then he wanted to try it with a bloke so–’ Draco remembered hearing and trying not to blush, to which his wife had held his hand and leaned against him on the sofa they were sat in, in a comforting gesture he didn’t know he needed at the time.
the spark they’ve been sharing for the past years as their friendship clearly changed and shifted and their feelings for one another began to show. It is that thrill of a new relationship that they are just starting to build — this time on a much more solid foundation than any relationship Draco had before.
” and “
“Huh?”
“Changing is fine. I’ll do it as well.” He clears his throat. “And you can look, if you’d like,” Draco adds, feeling the harshness in his own expression melt away as he relaxes.
“That’s not news,” Draco jokes, a tad bit self-deprecatingly, adding a tiny smile to his expression for effect.
he remembers slurring in a terrible stage whisper to Astoria one night, as everyone laughed heartily — and Hermione Granger was witty and sharp and ruthless, and Ginevra had stories to tell about Quidditch and– well. About hers and Potter’s
Harry laughs and the sound is warm and sweet. Draco feels a rush of affection for him and has to hold back the urge to snog him right there.
“It’s all built-in, after all. That makes the process much more difficult.”
“And you wouldn’t want to return the room all crooked, would you?”
“Don’t tell James and Lily, but you’re still Grandma Molly’s favourite, Al,” Harry joins their little circle, a protective hand on his son’s shoulder. It is a small gesture, but Draco sees how it helps the boy relax. It makes
“That’s right.” Harry nods.
“She ate a banana all by herself,” Albus informs him before pocketing his phone.
Harry warns them one more time from the door.
“I wouldn’t say
“There you go,” Harry coaxes, and Draco feels himself unravel. He comes with a low cry, shutting his eyes as he spills over Harry’s fist, his cock and their laps.
Mesmerised, Draco watches as Harry follows him — as Harry throws his head back into the pillows and bites on his already swollen lower lip, with the most attractive flush colouring his tanned skin. Draco watches his cock twitch and spurt, and the sight may just be the most erotic thing he has ever laid eyes on.
You fall into him like you would into a Pensieve.
He alternates slow long licks over Potter’s rim and fully fucking him with his tongue. Potter’s grunts and the way he desperately grabs at the sofa cushions have him going wild, and it’s not long until Potter gasps, “fuck, I can’t, Draco, I can’t, I’ll come if you don’t stop.”
It’s the same every weekend but it still tastes coppery and bitter in his mouth. It shouldn’t hurt when it’s routine: wet mouths, reddened skin, slick fingers and whispered pleas. The come hasn’t dried on the sheets and Potter’s already halfway out the door.
Unsurprisingly, sprawled on the middle of the enormous bed in the main bedroom is how he finds his husband, white shirt undone all the way to his bellybutton, tight grey trousers still on, gorgeous, slender bare feet hanging off the edge of the bed.
I have with Pansy. But Blaise is a, well, for lack of a better term, a less intense type of Pureblood. He understands how lost I am most of the time. He’ll mock me for it, relentlessly. But he gets it.
is all Draco can think about through the alcohol haze and the dizzying atmosphere of the club. He really, really isn’t. Potter is across the club, surrounded by his usual entourage, looking at Draco when he thinks Draco isn’t looking back.
He watches my eyes, too. The moment it happens, he knows I know.
Draco keeps a tight grip around Potter’s neck as he wanks him, slow and hard and watches as Potter’s breaths get shallower and shallower. Draco knows he’s made a mistake almost immediately in not freeing his own cock, because the pressure is torture but he doesn’t want to let go of Potter just yet.
dying.”
Harry wraps his legs around Draco, and traps him into that shallow thrust that’s perfect for a morning fuck. Just Draco’s hand putting a little pressure at the base of Harry’s neck, on his collarbone, and Harry running his nails down Draco’s sides. Draco kissing Harry as he fucks into him again and again and Harry whispering against Draco’s lips “fuck, yes, God, yes, Draco, so good, so fucking big, I love it when you fuck me, oh God, oh God, oh God, right there.”
Neither come that night, although Harry is in near ecstasy when Draco cuts a small shallow line across his chest.
“Fucking hell, Potter, that feels good. Look at you. How badly do you want to come?”
The day is dying when they release him. Potter hands him his wand with a mumbled “happy birthday.”
He reaches for the waistband of Draco’s briefs and asks, “Can I?”
and sometimes that’s all it takes to convince me the lack of sleep and general tiredness is worth it, after all. That feeling doesn’t last long but it’s lovely nonetheless.
Harry over Astoria.
“God, Malfoy. Oh god,” Potter all but whispers, one hand stroking Draco at an unforgiving pace, the other one grabbing the cushion behind his head. “Keep me, Malfoy, please, Draco, keep me.”
But the electrostimulation? Potter loves it.
“Yes,
“We’re going to be okay, aren’t we?” Harry asks, and Draco doesn’t know what to make of that.
Mavis finds Harry Potter five minutes later, just across the bullpen, in the small shared kitchen, with one hip cocked against the counter by the kettle. He’s waving a half-eaten rich tea biscuit in between his fingers, chatting with another couple of uniformed Aurors — not a care in the world, no idea his world is about to collapse under him.
“It’s okay if you don’t like it,” Draco says.
And I aim towards land. I have work to do.
And they see Theo and Daphne, who’s plump as a balloon and equally as ready to pop, and they see Blaise who hugs Draco so tightly Draco thinks he may snap.
Draco had pictured it so often throughout his life he couldn’t honestly believe he had made it all the way to twenty-seven.
There is only one person in the world I would wake in the middle of the night for. Only one person I’d attempt to squeeze two small babies into intricate robes before four in the morning for. And he’s currently giving me a face that says “if you’re not out of bed in thirty seconds, I’m gonna drag you out of there myself,” so I get out of bed and check on the babies: still asleep, because
Harry looks sad, when he looks at Draco again, sitting on Draco’s bed, looking impossibly small.
They can’t go more than a couple of weeks without knocking on each other’s doors, desperate, wanting. Or rutting against each other at work. Or making up late nights working a case that isn’t even that urgent just so they can suck each other’s cocks.
Potter moans at that.
“Look at you. So well behaved, you. I think I really may keep you, you know?” He says, a teasing tone in his voice.
, like
Truth is, I’d be lost without him. Even if he’s in a mood — is it the eyebrow, is it higher than usual? Or maybe the twitch on his lip? Maybe
Draco mouths it at him at the same time that he wraps his hand around Harry’s thick cock. “Come.”
I like Blaise. He was the last of Draco’s friends to warm up to me in the end, which was surprising, considering all the…
We don’t speak of Gryffindor, these days. Just like we don’t speak
Trawlers need maintaining, need looking after, but mostly, they do their own work. We set the net for the desired depth and we let the fish get themselves caught. I like to think the waiting is not idle, but we often take turns having a kip in the cabin while the other two keep watch. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t get a little while to enjoy it when the sun finally pokes its bright tendrils over the edge of the horizon, marking the start of a new day.
think Ginevra had that much literary talent at eleven,
May comes and goes and everyone is talking about that day. Pansy’s eyes are rimmed red when she sees him and she mumbles — unintelligibly, in between sobs — words that sound like “anniversary” and “I thought” or “I feared” and “gone,” “like Greg.”
Harry never speaks to him directly about the important things. The serious conversations, Harry has them with the wind. He’d said it once, that he’d forgiven Draco. That time, he’d been talking to the breeze in his back garden, the one that tickled the hair on the back of Draco’s neck. He’d asked Draco about moving in, a long while ago. That time, his words had been directed at the beam of light shining straight through the bathroom window and creating rainbows on the bubbles on the water between them.
Things are exactly as they should be: Harry’s head on Draco’s chest, his leg over Draco’s thighs, the light filtering through the gauzy curtains, the soft rhythmic pace of Harry’s breath, the lemon and thyme cake on the kitchen table, and the ring in the box in Draco’s sock drawer.
Draco stopped pretending Potter is not attractive long ago.
This is not the kiss I wanted for Draco.
Something you’re meant to forget is real.
“Draco,” Harry says, suddenly. Serious.
You learn to love the mornings, in my profession. Not that I ever had a chance to pick this profession, or even consider what else is there out in the world. But despite it being destiny and not choice, I appreciate the quietness of the world before dawn. There’s something about the routine that I enjoy. The dichotomy of having that routine on land when the rule out at sea is to always expect the unexpected.
“No. Please. Just do it. I want it, Draco. Make me feel good.”
“Potter, what exactly do you want?” He asks, and trails his fingers up from the coarse hair around Potter’s cock, up his chest, and into Potter’s open mouth. Potter sucks on Draco’s fingers with a wild hunger, like they’re coated in honey. As if Draco himself is the Ambrosia the gods promised.
It turns out Harry is holding Draco’s small but powerful electric wand. It’s magically operated, but it works just like the Muggle stuff. “Like a cattle prod,” the lady at the sex shop had told Draco with a devious twinkle in her eyes.
He waits, like his mother told him to, pretending he’s not afraid. The first rays of sunlight kiss his blood-covered face when the Aurors take him.
Their fingers brush when Draco reaches out for the lit joint and he lets Harry fall back onto his chest and maybe that’s the first time in nearly a decade that Draco feels peace.
“A Malfoy,” he says. “Didn’t think you’d have the guts.”
It’s not a conscious decision, but Draco knows as Harry’s back arches off the bed that he needs Potter to fuck him. Tonight.
They kiss for the longest time. Undressing each other, cocks sliding against each other in a torturous tease. Draco is half turned on into oblivion, half in dire need of a Calming Draught. He kneels between Harry’s legs and takes Harry’s thick cock in his mouth, relaxing the both of them as he does.
I practically screech — or as close to screeching I can come to without waking up the finally sleeping offspring.
I couldn’t say what it is, exactly. What his tells are. But I’m still yawning away the sleep in my eyes (of which there is much, because Scorpi is hungry all the time and Jamie is colic-y — or is it the other way round?) when I see him through my blinks and I know he’s in a mood.
Draco wants to speak. He wants to say “I am dying, I don’t want to die without telling you,” but he has no strength. His thoughts are going faster than the newest Firebolt as he hears Harry tell whoever else is in the room (Ron?) to leave. He wonders if this is it. This what they show you in the films: your life flashing before your eyes right before you die.
Why is Potter telling Draco this in the middle of the workday in the Ministry loos? And why does Draco like it so much?
It’s not cold
“Too much?” Draco asks, and strokes his hand over Potter’s thigh in one of the gentlest touches they have ever shared.
I look at him and he’s still smiling, all the way to the eyes and
When I reach the harbour Crabbe and Goyle are already onboard the Nimbus 2001, my small trawler. She’s old now, a twelfth birthday present from my father, but well maintained and she’s served us well all these years.
“You were in love with him the whole time, weren’t you?” And that is the Astoria Draco has known most of his life. Straight to the point, sharp as a knife.
“You know magic?”
“Arms?” He asks.
Harry yelps when Draco zaps him on his thigh.
on the bed and watches Harry grab his prick with desperate hunger.
When the night is still dark and everything is bathed in that endless velvety blue, I drink my tea standing up at the kitchen counter, leave the cup in the sink and make for the door, stopping to pull my boots and my hat on.
“Yes, hello. We have got to stop meeting like this.”
Draco’s flame burns brightest and quickest in a tiny Muggle club that Daphne and Astoria take him to, where it’s dark and hot no matter the time of day or the weather outside. It’s somewhere called The Attic, despite it being in a cellar. Somewhere he quickly makes a reputation for himself, somewhere where he’s always wanted and he can forget about the weight of the cross he bears.
The moon hangs low, blindingly bright.
Words are hard. His mouth is heavy, dry, broken.
And he keeps waking up in Potter’s bed, and eating his meals, and seeing his friends, and the next time he sees Pansy she smiles and she doesn’t call Potter any names.
All in all, Potter really isn’t as slick as he thinks he is. But it’s fine by Draco if Potter wants to pretend.
“Don’t worry,” I tell him. “You just caught me by surprise, is all. I didn’t even know it was a thing. Let’s do it.”
“We’ll end up dead,” I say.
And Draco thinks, sod his “no words before tea“ rule, and whispers back, “I love you, too.”
Without even having to raise his wand, Harry marks the perimeter of the land that belongs to the Malfoys with a barrier spell.  He watches as the thatched roof of the shed-not-shed goes up in flames and the Fiendfyre begins to spread across the dry land.
It turns out we don’t, not that Draco tells me any of this. In fact, I learn very little about the whole Sain thing, and the following day Draco is called into work because apparently
All of it, when added together,
. He’d say the wind was whispering softly and rustling the leaves. The wind is giving Draco a headache.
He grabs the small knife off the bed and breaks the seal open on the box.
For the first time in three months (three months, seven days and approximately seven hours to be precise), I am woken before sunrise by Draco, rather than one of the babies crying. He’s kissing my temple gently, stroking my hair and whispering, “Wake up, darling.” I groan and roll over, away from him. “They’ll be here soon,” he says.
Draco isn’t sneaking around; he’s loud enough that she must know he’s there but he doesn’t announce himself or greet her before he’s right next to her, both of them facing the tombstone, side by side.
“Sit down, Harry,” she says, gesturing to the chair in front of me. Not one to disobey a Malfoy (or a Black, for that matter) when they use that tone, I take a seat.
I call for help, voice straining with the weight of the heaviest net I have ever pulled.
Draco stops and comes over his own fist with a cry.
“Bend. Over.” Draco says, again.
“You’re not going to come. You’re not going to come when you go home tonight. You’re going to be good. And you’re going to wait until tomorrow. For as long as you can take it. And tomorrow you’re going to touch yourself, Potter, you’re gonna stroke yourself and you’re going to be thinking of me when you do it,” he says, rutting desperately, at the thought Potter in his own home, fucking himself to thoughts of Draco.
he still calls himself that) seems to trust me right back, as he tells me how I’m the missing piece of the puzzle.
“So?” she says, in that tone that reminds me oh-so-much of Draco.
“Yes. Do you want blood?”
“I don’t want you to come,” he repeats.
Sure I’d love to see the valley and the mountains, but when the door shuts behind me I’m immediately struck by the familiar saltiness of the water and I know
Harry Potter touches Draco like he’s learning him. Like Draco is a long lost lover. Like Harry is the sun and the heat coming back when the winter snow melts, as it takes in Draco’s shape again, studies his edges, grasps the parts of him no one sees.
We’re barely all showered and suited up and semi-awake, when Blaise walks through the Floo, smiling way too much for the time of the day, carrying enormous branches of juniper with him.
He begs just as beautifully as he would for Draco’s cock, just as he would ask Draco to stop if he was too close to coming, just as he would for an extra spank or a harder grip on his hair or  around his throat.
Draco doesn’t answer. It’s not acceptable to talk before tea.
Harry hates the mirror: the zigzag on his forehead, the circle on his chest, the words on his hand. He looks at Draco instead, still in bed, and wonders if it’s like that for him, too. Scars, and for each one, a secret. Heavy with the burden of the past.
We unhook the net, sharing a look between us, preparing for the worst. The thing doesn’t seem dangerous. Not like a shark, or a whale, but I can’t be sure until I see it properly. The net falls open and I can’t help but gasp when the beautiful bright-eyed siren tumbles out among the fish.
Draco can’t help but smile when Harry reaches him, bright eyes and chin dimple showing.
Draco doesn’t know what a lightsabre is but, truth be told, he doesn’t know what Potter is on about half of the time.
“Everything’s changed,” he says, voice shaking.
“Is this what you wanted, Potter? What you’ve been thinking about?” He asks, and Potter nods, vigorously, eyes unfocused and mouth slack.
Hogwarts is an island itself. I forget it because of how big it is. Because I’ve read about it in books like it’s some fantasy made-up world, instead of the place I live in. Long before the world was what it is now, Hogwarts was divided into four separate kingdoms, with their own history and their own values but still under the rule of Hogwarts. Slytherin has got the largest slice of coast, so fishing became our duty. The Hufflepuff, in the valleys, deal with cattle and agriculture. Ravenclaw, in the mountains, are the kingdom of knowledge, where the universities are, where they invent things and explore the world outside Hogwarts.
“Draco!” Says the first voice and he hears the sound of three pairs of feet rush towards him.
Potter never even asks to come. He cleans himself up, a mixture of wiping his face with his t-shirt and a gentle Scourgify and kisses Draco almost gently, before pulling his jeans on, grabbing his things and Apparating away.
“I want you to spank me,” Potter says.
“Please what?” Draco asks.
He shouldn’t respond to childish provocations, he knows he shouldn’t, but Draco slides his hand firmly into Harry’s palm, relishing in the feeling of the familiar heat. For a moment, he almost regrets it, as Harry lowers his face down and kisses the back of Draco’s hand with reverence.
There’s a plan.
“We’re not meant to be Auror partners if we are… uh…”
“You want me to keep you. Don’t you, Potter?” Draco says, and fuck, he’s gonna come if Potter doesn’t stop feeling so fucking good. “I think you want me to keep you.”
. I wonder how my parents felt the day of my Saining. I wish I could ask them. I wonder how
Draco closes the door behind him and says, “What can I do for you, Potter?” thinking a healthy bowl of pasta and a glass of water may be in order. He may even have a sobering potion in the bathroom sink cabinet upstairs.
Traditions are funny, in my eyes. I never had any, until late in my life. This is very much like the Order of Merlin ceremony (for which Hermione’s voice repeated in my head what I was meant to say and do), or my wedding (for which Draco’s voice repeated in my head what I was meant to say and do).
Spattering rain when our eyes meet across the room. A burbling river when he finally agrees to go out for dinner. Dripping holy water every time he drops to his knees. And now, a flood as he walks down the aisle towards me.
“You’re gonna see Harry alright,” Ron says. “He’s gonna have words about having to heal you again.” It’s almost like a joke. Like a Ronald-typical joke. But there’s an edge of worry there. There’s panic. Ronald doesn’t panic.
“Who are you?”
“Draco, please,” Harry says, and Draco bites his lip. He drags the blade a little harder against Harry’s thigh and gasps, just as Harry does too.
“Oh yeah? How about you get on your knees, then, Auror Potter?”
Which is why it’s a little intimidating how serious he’s acting. And it’s more than the time of the day. This is big,
“Oh.” Draco says, stupidly. “That’s… nice.”
cw: divorce (not drarry)
Exactly thirty-seven minutes pass between the moment a gloved hand leaves the note on the Head Auror’s desk and the shrill voice of Mavis, the Head Auror’s secretary, calls, in a panic, “Deputy Auror Weasley!” and then, almost immediately after, “Ronald Weasley!”
But first, coffee and toast. Being faithful to your schedule is the most important part of life as a fisherman. Even if you’re a spy for the resistance.
“I’m going to heal you, okay? I’m going to heal you and we’ll do that again. I’ll take you to dinner, or brunch, I know you like brunch. Or just coffee. We’ll go to the pictures. I’ll hold your hand. We’ll go flying. We’ll go clubbing and I’ll dance with you, I promise I will, and I’ll let you tell me how bad I am. I’ll find you a copy of that book you were talking about with Hermione, no matter how much it costs. I’ll throw my name around if I have to, okay? And we’re going to do that again, properly. When I’m not your healer and you’re not hurting. I’m going to heal you now, you just—“ he stops, then, breath wild and panicked.
“Harry.” Draco says firmly.
I often think my mother does have something in common with that cousin who left and ended up rotting in Azkaban. Only she’s quiet about it, she’s resourceful. Because Mr. Riddle has broken my father through fear and threat and evil. And my father does his bidding, works for him, relentlessly, day and night. It’s much more than fishing, it’s ensuring no one ever speaks of it, no one goes against Riddle’s agenda. No one thinks of all we used to have in the beautiful world we live in. No one thinks of
, he tells himself.
He hadn’t realised it was his birthday.
When he sees Harry like this, Draco is reminded that for every bit he is technique, Harry is fire —
I’ve always thought of him as liquid:
“Salazar, Potter. You’re such a slut. Touch yourself for me, will you?”
He’s hard as a rock, but if he wants to make this last, make it good for Potter, he’ll have to wait. He uses both hands to help Potter out of his trousers, and sighs at how much he wants to dive straight in and suck him off until he’s crying. He won’t though. Not yet.
“Maybe I’ll keep you,” he says, lowering himself on Potter’s cock a little harder as Potter wraps his hand around Draco’s cock. “I’ll keep you, if that’s what you want. All for myself.”
“I trust you, Draco Malfoy. You’re what we’ve been missing all these years.”
has rather unceremoniously wrapped his lips around their cock? Certainly not Draco.
“Oh my god,” Potter exhales. “You’re so fucking fit.”
At age forty, I like to think I am well aware of the workings of the Wizarding World. Sure, I didn’t know it was even a thing at age ten. And at twenty… well, I didn’t really care much for anything at twenty — things were hard then. And then I was a prick for a good while, but Draco sorted me out, for better or for worse (it’s mostly better). I eventually learnt about magical inheritance rules, and about Pureblood courting traditions (not to mention
It’s a can of worms like one that’s never been opened before.
“Have you been thinking about me this whole time?” He asks, and slides his hands under Potter’s jumper and t-shirt, finding deliciously warm skin. He kisses up Potter’s jaw all the way up to his ear and whispers, “Have you been thinking about me?”
Draco’s mouth dries up and he suddenly has nothing to say that Harry doesn’t know already. No
I watch them bring him out, all sharp angles and too-long matted hair. Hermione puts her hand on my shoulder. The trembling never stops.
And then, I realise something. Midsummer. Solstice.
Harry blushes, then smiles. “Cake,” he says.
Chaos descends onto the Auror Office at an unprecedented speed, a swift domino effect that topples out of the office door and soon the whole DMLE is in uproar.
He seals the office as he would a crime scene, with sure, practiced slashes of his wand — every procedure correct, no mistakes — and only then does he allow himself to put his head in his hands and whisper,
So Draco pushes, “Do you want to come, Potter?”
Voldemort was dead but the war felt endless. Harry hadn’t known that seeing Draco Malfoy in a holding cell would be the spark to set his world on fire.
He’s almost disappointed when the song finishes and Harry twirls him around and plants a slow, gentle kiss on his cheek, taking the time to whisper a “Was that so bad?”
Protocol says his husband should not be involved in the investigation at all, even if he is the best Field Auror the Department has, but
“I had a feeling we’d meet here one day.” She sounds like a villain in a bad film, the kind Harry used to like. Draco doesn’t say anything — what is he even meant to say to that?
There it is.
Potter looks up at him, a little confused.
“Should we tell them you’re safe?” Harry asks.
He ended up in Gryffindor, I believe, for a while. And then out at sea. Not like me, not like the other Slytherins. Not free, in our boats. He ended up in the island they send our prisoners to. Azkaban. A desolate rock full of nothing but despair.
He had not accounted for Harry Potter opening the door as he’s leaving Teddy’s birthday present on the doorstep, and, against his better judgement, he says yes to that cup of tea.
Draco has twelve years of catching Harry up on his life, on Scorpius and how he’s grown to be the smartest child Draco has ever met. But the wind stops and the yellow light
But under my father’s own roof, my mother taught me everything I know. And the moment I see the siren, I know what to do. I know this is the chance I have been waiting for – the nugget of hope I’ve been holding in my heart. The only way Hogwarts can ever be itself again, beautiful, thriving,
“Hey,” Draco says. “I just want to understand. You never… I know you like pain. But I don’t know—“
And now Narcissa is showing me the two sets of robes, the ancient linen one with the embroidered black trim, and the cleaner looking one — satin and lace, Draco’s.
Draco takes his time teasing him. Zapping him with the wand, and then licking the area right after. Stroking Potter’s cock, and sending a jolt of electricity through him when he's sufficiently distracted.
“Mine. At 8. Don’t be late,” he says, and doesn’t wait for Potter’s reply.
And then, the music starts again, and Harry leans in closer and offers Draco his hand.
“I love you. You know that, right?” Harry says to the fire pit burning in their back garden one night. And Draco nods. Because Draco never says anything when Harry speaks to him without looking at him, but he listens.
it makes Draco
“And legs. Whatever you want, Draco. Please.”
Until now, that is. This time he’s pretty certain he won’t be afforded such luck. He feels the curse hit him square on the chest. It’s his own fault, really, for not realising there was someone already in the room he entered. He’d been too busy throwing a rather flourished Incarcerous across the room at the two potions dealers he’d been running after for the past five minutes to notice the third man.
“I was dreaming they sentenced you to The Kiss,” I gasp.
He lets himself look, despite the fact he
Once the ceremony is completed, we wait for the June sun to be up in the sky fully, and Scorpi falls asleep on Neville’s lap. Jamie won’t settle without Draco (a common occurrence), and I retreat into the house to make everyone a well deserved cup of tea.
“If I’d made it to the interview with Luna, we’d be in all the papers tomorrow anyway. Come on.”
“I am dying,” he says, and Ron makes a noise that can only be described as half agony, half agreement.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Harry. The initiation rites! The blessing. You know, the ceremony where you get your godparents.”
Harry continues babbling for a few seconds, “Keep going, uh, fuck, uh, Draco, don’t stop, don’t stop, don’t stop— ah!”
“Get him out,” he barks at the Auror.
Potter does, in one of the most devastating displays of submission Draco has ever witnessed. Draco sits on the sofa, spreads his legs and undoes his trousers just enough for him to be able to get his cock out.
traditions) and a million nonsensical rules that would never fly in the Muggle world.
“Sweetheart—“
“Worth it,” Harry replies, already pulling me into another rough kiss.
“I come to see Harry a lot,” she adds. Harry’s name in her mouth feels a bit like the space left behind a lost tooth and Draco wants her to say it again, wants to dip his tongue in that space not yet healed until the discomfort becomes real pain.
Harry presses Draco against the mattress and climbs on top, continuing to attack Draco with small little pecks followed by long deep kisses.
He keeps one hand in Potter’s back pocket and brings the other one up to Potter’s hair and is surprised at how soft it is, which just makes Draco want to touch it even more. His fingers find the back of Potter’s necklace as Draco plays with his hair, and he can’t help but pull a little, play with the small beads between his fingers, see what happens.
” Draco chuckles, shaking his head and covering his warm, likely reddened face with a hand.
“Life,” Draco breathes out in a little laugh.
“Now that’s not cryptic at all,” Harry teases, stepping closer to him. He’s already removed his coat and scarf, leaving his neck bare for Draco to see.
“Next time,” Harry tells him, matter-of-factly. “I’m sucking you off. And then you can do it right in my mouth.”
“And you were,” Harry assures him.
Apparently they were into
Instinctively, Draco’s hips keep moving as his body wants more. Their legs tangle together in the most natural of ways as he shifts to lie on his other side, finally able to see Harry fully. And there he is, sans the lumpy jumper Draco is sure he’s gone to bed in, in only the worn trousers through which Draco can perfectly discern the contours of an erection. The sight makes his mouth
together, and it became just one more of the things that had made their relationship special.
“On three?” Harry jokes, putting his now-ironed clothes down on the bed and taking hold of the hem of the shirt he’s wearing.
Hours before, Harry had fallen asleep with his head on Draco’s lap while he carded his fingers through the knots that insisted on forming in Harry’s hair in spite of his worthy attempts to tame it. It felt great to share that moment; like another step on their path towards getting to knowing another and into making their relationship more meaningful. There was still a lot waiting to happen, Draco thought then, but they had also come a long way already, from where they once were at school, for instance.
“More pictures of Olivia?” Draco asks him, genuinely curious.
deep down, knowing the whole thing was built without any magic and that some of the structures have been there for a hundred years, but Draco made his best effort to find the Gryffindor in him and brave through. It earned him some giggles from Rose and Scorpius, and a few concerned looks from Albus, which he was surprised by but appreciated immensely. Luckily enough, Harry decided they’d had enough Muggle transportation for a day and agreed to bend the rules of their Muggle adventure a little bit and use magic, Apparating them to the point closest to the hotel so they could walk the short distance over.

“What’s on your mind?” Harry asks him, rising from the bed. They still haven’t touched today, not daring to let anything show in front of their sons and Harry’s niece. Albus hasn’t dealt well with Ginevra getting remarried and having another daughter, even though there’s no animosity between her and Harry. It’s hard to point out why he’s reacted this way, but Draco doesn’t want to risk it. He doesn’t want to overstep any boundaries, or come between Harry and his son, Circe forbid.
The atmosphere at their table reminds him of the one between him and Harry from a few months ago, thick with something sweet and special, with every glance in Harry’s direction making him smile.
“Treacherous, us Slytherins,” Draco chuckles and kisses him again.
He is hard too, at this point, to no one’s surprise. And, when Harry finally opens his eyes, Draco
When they kiss, it feels like a natural progression of their last movement; like closing the distance between them and touching Harry’s lips with his own is just the way of the universe, the way it’s all supposed to be. It’s soft and soothing, and it helps drain the tension from Draco’s body, to which Harry’s hands respond by tangling in his hair.
“It doesn’t bother
“Ron and Hermione had booked a room for the kids and one for themselves, so all they’ve got is a double bed,” Harry explains, and that much Draco has grasped already, thank you ever so.
“You’re gorgeous,” he whispers, almost as if thinking out loud, and Harry has the audacity to blush.
Gathering up some more of the courage he used in the underground, Draco circles the bed with a small, shy laugh and broad steps. He’s met with a smile and Harry’s reach for him. With a deep exhale, Draco wills his shoulders to relax, rolling them back before Harry can get his arms around his neck.
“That went well,” Harry notes, gathering his discarded clothes in a ball and tossing them over the armchair in the corner. If

They have a lot of fun out with the kids.
For the first time since they arrived, Draco pulls his wand from its holster to cast an
“It’s a new thing they’re trying out, with the hybrid towers!” Scorpius explains excitedly, and Draco is both impressed that he knows about it and proud of him for it. He doubts they are teaching this kind of subject to twelve year-olds in their Muggle Studies class at Hogwarts, and it warms his heart to think that Scorpius must have gone and researched it on his own.
“Hagrid bought me a burger the first time I went to Diagon Alley,” Harry tells Draco with his mouth half full of chips. It’s disgusting and endearing.
Draco takes a special interest in the réchauds and is positively impressed by how effective they are in keeping all sorts of food warm. He knows Harry is watching him as he leans closer to peer into the hot water reservatories and manages to keep his expression neutral enough that it only elicits an amused chuckle from him.
He doesn’t remember feeling this way in a long time — having small shivers run up his spine just from feeling someone else’s body against his. He’s never had anyone’s
The Muggle hotel room with its abundance of plain built-in furniture and plastic blackout curtains isn’t the perfect romantic setting that Draco would have thought of for his first time with Harry but, as he rolls them over so he can lie on top of Harry and take control of their movements, Draco notices that he doesn’t mind it. He doesn’t care about idealisations of romance when he’s got Harry underneath him — hair mussed and lips swollen and shiny from their kiss — and his cock is so hard he’s on the brink of lightheadedness.
,” he curses under his breath, nipping at Harry’s bottom lip as if he can never get sick of doing it. It feels divine, letting his fingers tangle in Harry’s wild hair and kissing his lips and jaw and neck and drinking in the feeling of stubble burn on his sensitive skin. As they lay there, everything feels connected: every move feels fluid and sensual as their bodies move in sync, undulating and shifting, seeking pleasure with impressive fluidity.
, by the way,” Harry continues, gently kissing Draco on the cheek, and then moving to the other. “I don’t mind taking things slow, not at all. We’ve waited for things to feel right all around.” Harry moves to his jaw, then, to the shell of his ear. “And I’m not in any rush, Draco. We’ve got no reason to be.”
“Tell you what— we’ll get into bed. We’ll turn off the lights, turn on the telly and and I’ll mock you for the way you freaked out the first time we all went to the movies together.”
This time, he’s the one to draw Harry close. Draco fits their bodies together and gasps out loud when their hips align.

and all but trapping him in place. It has happened before — they are heavier than they look, and entitled enough to think it is their right to use Draco as a self-heating pillow whose only purpose is to serve them — and so he goes instinctively for the proven method of wiggling and turning. Except, when he wiggles, there’s an

With a small sigh, then, Draco lets his eyes fall shut once more and shifts closer to Harry, melting into his embrace. Feeling bold, he slides one leg over Harry’s, inviting him to fit his thigh between Draco’s. And
, and there is no time to feel shame about how primal of a reaction that is.
“Agreed.” Draco nods.

the most romantic setting…” Draco tries for humour, and he’s sure Harry knows he’s not deflecting.
Harry waits.
When they fall asleep again, it is Draco’s arm that rests around Harry’s middle, Draco’s soft kisses to his nape.
It makes Draco’s blood
Draco smiles at him and tries to decide what to do with the tightness he feels in his core, the pulse of his building arousal thrumming in his ears. For a second, he can feel himself get closer to that mindspace of panic as doubt threatens to arrive for good, but Harry’s quicker.
‘It’s gonna be good for the kids to see you together,’ she winked, and Draco thought he would die a little.
The breakfast buffet turns out to be the thing to wow him, after all.
Instinctively, he runs the pad of his thumb over the underside of the wedding ring he’s never taken off.
“That’s a lot of built-in furniture,” he observes once they’ve swiped their key card (!) and made their way inside.

It takes him a second to understand what’s going on, but Harry is still smiling and it doesn’t look like he’s about to leave.
After Rose come Albus and Scorpius, who seem distracted by something on Albus’ mobile.
“You’re cheating,” Harry calls from somewhere behind him and Draco freezes for a moment.
Skilfully, Harry wiggles enough to get his trousers down, working on Draco’s next, just enough to get his erection free. With one murmured Spell, his palm is full of warm, slippery liquid and Draco barely has the time to process it before Harry’s got his hand around them both and
Draco thinks, feeling silly.
Draco has no idea of whether Harry’s saying this to just be agreeable, and the idea that he’s being

“Not at all,” Draco tells her, clearing his throat.
It’s not like Draco is surprised by it; he enjoys being a parent and that is all about the small things. Seeing Albus, Rose and Scorpius fascinated over the artifacts at the Natural History Museum fills him with a kind of joy that makes it way too easy to forget what’s going to happen once they’re back at the little hotel. Seeing his son — whom he saw shrink into himself and lose that spark about him when his mum passed — with a glint in his eyes as he examined an abundance of fossils and ceramic pieces with his two best friends was enough to make all of this worth it.
In a second that seems to take at least a thousand more, Albus’ eyes narrow as he slowly turns to look at his father — who’s now fixing the ends of the braids in Rose’s hair as they chat merrily about the paintings she wants to see the most today — and then back at Draco.
at all.
It’s still dark out, as Draco can see when he dares to open his eyes. Slowly, the environment becomes familiar: the curtains they forgot to close all the way, the modern furniture and the soft glow of the city lights outside their window. The realisation helps him relax; a slow breath leaving his lips.
“No, it isn’t.” Harry smiles back.
,” Harry replies. He moves up his arm that’s been holding Draco’s middle, shifts and uses his large hand to gently tilt Draco’s chin towards him.
“It turned out well for the kids, and we get to spend the weekend together.” Harry nods, and Draco finally realises how silly of a scene they must make, speaking from opposite sides of a hotel bed for no reason at all.
to have that knowledge at all, in fact — but he has never realised that they would have left physical scars as well as the emotional ones. It’s nothing obnoxious, really. A faint round outline where Harry’s chest hair is sparse and the skin is a different texture.
it, after all.
Instead, he groans. He squeezes his eyes shut, tilts his head back and takes it as Harry sucks a bruise onto his neck. Draco doesn’t think of another world where he would have walked through the halls in Hogwarts sporting that love bite as a trophy because that world will never be as good as this one, that they inhabit together.

The kids are all exhausted when they finally make their way back to the hotel. They insisted on going to the British Museum to get their tickets for the next day, just for the sake of taking the
It makes him blush, to notice that his body has responded even before he could think of it, his hips undulating off their own accord as he sought Harry’s warmth. There are several layers of clothing between them, and no movement towards taking them off — which seems to take away from the pressure from last night and leaves only this electric, bright anticipation in its wake. Meanwhile, Harry is still breathing deeply behind him, and Draco wonders if he has fallen back asleep. He misses the kisses to his nape, even though Harry’s body has not stopped responding to his movements.
“Hope magic can save my data, really, because it’s the seventh picture since we left this morning…” Albus grumbles.
That is, at least until Harry James Potter runs his fingers through the mess they’ve both made all over his middle and
“Is that why you won’t use transfiguration on the furniture?” Draco turns to look at him, then, reciprocating Harry’s amused expression.
He likes the way Harry doesn’t bother shaving every day, and the way there are specks of silver in his beard, as well. He likes that Harry wears the cologne Draco bought him as a Christmas present a few months ago, when they were still circling each other and the tension between them was dense and sweet, as if they both already knew where they would end up and there was no rush.
do they fit well together, Draco thinks, enjoying the swooping feeling in his stomach as he adjusts and notices Harry’s arousal.
“And then she passed,” Harry nods, tucking a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear.
,” he shakes his head and Harry laughs. “But I did. Scorpius has been talking about this Museum trip for months in his letters... I’m glad he got to see it, even if Ronald and Hermione couldn't take them.”

It’s a funny question to ask himself when he’s at the lobby of a small Muggle hotel, which seems
‘Is there something you want to talk about?’ Astoria asked him that night when they came home, and Draco wasn’t sure of why he’d ended up intoxicated and crying in her lap, of all things, while telling her he loved her and that he would never leave her and that they were happy and he didn’t want to go to any
Draco gets distracted for a second as he looks Scorpius over, reaching out to fix his hair out of habit, earning himself a “That’s fine, dad!” and a laugh before he runs off to get himself some food.
,” Harry cries and flushes again under his gaze.
Across the table, Harry beams at him.
The years in the Auror department are still evident in Harry’s build — in the way his shoulders are broad and his arms are littered in faint scars from spell damage, as well. There are some on his chest, too, and the round-shaped one catches Draco’s eye the most. He knows about the Horcruxes — he feels
“The point is, ah. I—” he stutters.
And, to his surprise, the dinner parties had remained. As it turned out, Ronald Weasley had a great taste for wine —
He and Harry have gone through so much, and now they are here
All of his nerve ends feel alive, and the sensation is right on the perfect spot between sultry and overwhelming. And so he sucks on Harry’s tongue ever so gently, and caresses it with his own and basks on the sound that Harry makes — breathless and broken. Harry squeezes his arse cheek and kneads it in his hand and pulls Draco against him, and Draco is pretty sure he may melt.
“It’s not about the money, Al, it's about us not having to rush you to St. Mungo’s in the middle of the night to get your stomach pumped because you ate too many sweets
he’s smitten.
He also doesn’t want to question his place in Harry’s life — not when they’re about to undress in front of each other for the first time, and sleep in the same bed for the first time, and maybe do things that Draco hasn’t done with anyone since Astoria died.
. One by one.
“Are you nervous?” Harry asks, lower on the teasing tone. He stops, pulling the jumper he’d been wearing over his head and off, leaving him in a worn vest top and jeans.
They are going to need a shower in the morning, and Draco honestly hopes that the water pressure will be the thing to impress him about their hotel room. This time, they remember to close the blinds — and also to text the children to meet them downstairs for breakfast at eight, so there won’t be any surprise knocks on their door.
,’ he finished, seemingly at a loss for words.
It was strange, being back at home. Harry hadn’t been in the hospital that long, but time had blurred over the course of the long days and nights, and it felt like forever since he’d been at Grimmauld. As directed by the rehab plan that Oliver and the team physio had sent over, Harry spent his days doing gentle exercises, stretching, and strength training to build up his muscles again. He knew the exercises were essential if he wanted to get back to training soon, and yet Harry felt like he was just going through the motions, his heart not in it.
