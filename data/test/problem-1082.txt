It was pathetic. He knew it was pathetic. But he couldn't take it; he just needed a break from constantly seeing the hateful faces, of hateful words being hissed at him. The whole thing with Malfoy was bringing back memories from when this happened in second year, which just continued to make him miserable.
Harry lifted an eyebrow at Ginny, who shrugged but gave a look that told Harry that Luna may be mistaken.
Harry rushed outside to the grounds and tried to find a place where absolutely no one would see him or bother him. He ended up selecting a small area among the boathouses, lake and castle. A good size boulder blocked his view of the rest of the grounds, and there weren't any windows at that part of the castle. He wasn't worried about anything from the lake seeing him, of course.
He punched his pillow a few times before officially curling up for bed. He was fuming, extra furious that he was still watching Malfoy on the map, where he had been in the toilets, obviously studying the sinks. Moaning Myrtle joined him, and he thought about going back under the Cloak just to see if he could find a way to eavesdrop on their conversation, hoping against hope that Malfoy was questioning the ghost about what she knew and was confirming that Harry really, actually did do what he said he did in second year.
The most pathetic part, Harry concluded, was that either way, Harry was clearly someone to whom his sexuality was important, a literal defining factor, if he was up at Merlin knew what hour thinking about it in a loop.
Her words were stern as always but with a kindness he had never heard from anyone before. It was gentle but unyielding, understanding yet inspiring as if daring him to explore every and any identity; as if the momentous realisations Harry had been having lately were merely molehills in her eyes—in the best of ways.
"It might as well be," Malfoy shot back. He had spent a good while just flipping through books and setting things up. Now, he had a full-body apron with elbow-length dark gloves on with admittedly intimidating tools in each hand, not to mention a face mask that made him look quite like a mad scientist. Where he had produced a stool to stand on, Harry had no idea, but on it he stood, towering over Harry who was sitting cross-legged a few metres away to stay clear of the mess.
"Wh-... what was… what was that spell?" Harry managed to ask. He couldn't say the stench was actually gone, exactly, nor was he really breathing any type of fresh air, but it did feel like there was an invisible bubble around his head, filtering the air and cleaning it.
Because this was his life, not that stupid fantasy. His reality didn't feature a Malfoy who smiled lopsidedly, even if it was still cocky, who had miles of pale skin and would use his smooth, posh voice to encourage Harry to touch him. Nowhere in his reality would or could there be a Malfoy who would ever even
Malfoy very slowly peeked around the corner at the end of the corridor, and Harry watched with amusement as Malfoy emerged, wand already out and ready, to squint down the seemingly empty hall.
Please note, again there is lifted dialogue here. I didn't mean there to be but I needed it for a segue to my own dialogue.
Every rehearsed word died in his throat. He anxiously gathered any ounce of courage he had and managed to croak, "I didn't mean it. Yesterday. I didn't… I… I'm not..."
attractive. He looked himself over, trying to pretend it wasn't himself to decide if he would find someone like Harry good-looking. He bit his lip, trying to think of other words to describe himself other than 'skinny' and 'bony'.
“That is all we will ask, and we are willing to do anything to get him back to you. That’s why we’re here if there’s one thing we’re good at its sneaking around and figuring out a crisis” Hermione finished with a laugh. Ron just grumbled an agreement behind her.
“Hold on you know him” she raised her voice pointing at the new boy. The boy looked at her and smiled Blaise looked up at her then to the boy and back to her and smirked.
He slowly sat up and slid out of the bed locating his shirts and throwing them on. Then he grabbed hs shoes and slid them on. He started making his way over to the door then stopped and looked over his shoulder at the blond. What if he hadn’t been drunk? What if he knew he had offered for Harry to sleep with him? Then what, he could be ruining the beginnings of something he had always wanted. Harry slipped over to the black desk and wrote out a note.
“Lets get to bed you all first full day back to school and Blakes first so we need our rest” Pansy said standing up and making her way up the stairs to the girls dorms. The three males stood up and followed but turned towards the opposite stair case. Blaise first followed by Blake then lastly Draco.
“But we are not mad, disgusted or anything like that. I mean Harry and I told each other a long time ago about our preferences” the red head said.
The sight that met him brought a deep flush to his face. Blake was staring up front but obviously zoned out. He had the tip of his sugar quill in his mouth and every so often his tongue would poke out to run across his lips to clear any remaining sugar. Blake made eye contact with Draco and smiled removing the quill from his mouth.
Everyone looked confused they did not think Draco would smell anything. Blake and Blaise were staring at each other with a worried look on their faces but turned back to Draco who was still astonished. Instead of commenting they all wrote down what they smelt and cleaned up. Snape walked over and collected their papers but frowned when he glanced at Dracos seeing what the boy smelt. The group gathered their things and headed out to go to their next classes and said they would see each other at lunch.
“Look this is going to take getting use to and we’re going to fall into old habits, we’ve only ever had each other. But we will try, and I’m willing to do anything to get Blake back at this point” Draco said quietly, his head hung.
“Yes it is, there was no other rooms for me to have my own, but Blaise said I could stay with him.” He didn’t know why but something bubbled in him at that, he didn’t like it.
“ Draco dear, its hard to believe that when your still staring at him as you say that” Pansy chuckled again. Draco flipped her off and rolled his eyes. Damn girl got on his nerves some times, ok maybe all the time. But he wouldn’t let her go for anything.
“Pans I feel wrong” he started, staring off into a realm only he could see. She stayed quiet giving Draco his time to come out with it.
“Malfoy has now taken an interest in you, that means if he doesn’t know where you are or what your doing, he will throw a fit. He has horrible only child syndrome” the girl finished looking at her nails and picking at them. Blake tipped his head back and looked at Draco, and the blond just staired right back at him, Blake groaned out.
“Harry what’s wrong what did I do” he asked bringing his hand up to wipe away the tears. Harry sniffed but shook his head saying nothing.
“Yes that is a nasty habit of ours, but I’m happy we stopped calling her what we did” the three grimaced at that.
“Blake your ill, I’m going to get Madam Pomfrey” the blond was out of bed and putting his slippers on.
“Yeah I promise” the blond whispered and pulled the smaller against him to hug. He liked hugging the boy it calmed him.
The group had shown up early to insure there would be plenty of room for them and that no one else would get to the two before they did. The plan was for Draco to go up first and talk to them and apologize for the past, as an olive branch of peace. So the blond lead the way and once in the great hall they immediately found the two sitting there quietly chatting. They made their way swiftly over to the table and stood there waiting for their presence to be known. After a few seconds Hermione glanced up and her eyes went slightly wide and she coughed a little. At this Ron looked up and had an expression of pure shock. By this time more students had made their way inside and was watching the group. Draco straightened his back and extended his hand.
“But Mione! This is dangerous, there will be drinking and all kinds of things. The students won’t be in their right mind. They’ll be susceptible to any dark magic the Snakes could throw at them” Harry said accusingly. Ron was next to him nodding eagerly his mouth full of some snack he had acquired.
“You have the grace of a garden gnome next time ill let you fall” with that he flew past the two boys, trying to push away the small ache it caused to say such words to the teen. As he reached his door and said the password he could hear Blake saying he didn’t mean to cause an issue he had miss judged the step, and Blaise reassuring him it was just how Draco was and not to think noting of it.
“ Blake get over here” Dracos eyes widen a little at himself he didn’t even know this kid why was he being so casual. “No need to listen to all that we’ll make sure you know what you need to know and catch you up”
Since Snape didn’t want a bunch of eighteen year olds running around stupid on love potion they were to test it on mice to see the affects and write about them. Blaise and Ron went and got their mice and brought them back, then they all gave them some of the potion. It only took a few minuets to get the information they needed then returned the mice. Now it was time to write about what they each smelled.
His eyes were completely black his breathing heavy, his normal nails now talons. He started stalking towards Blaise and McGonagall his sharp teeth bared for all to see.
“You do realize when he sees you were lying it will be your ass correct” she said “But I do have to give you kudos it was a good way to put it to him” as she opened the door and they walked in they all heard a shouted “Viper!” Blake smiled and hurried over to the table hoping to get a seat to where Draco couldn’t cause him any harm yet.
When Blake was around, his veela went wild and started to rear its head. When Blake would touch him in any way even just a hand on the shoulder, he would want to lean forward and grab the boy. His sent was comforting to him, it calmed him whenever he was mad. If anyone made a comment to Blake or disrespected him Draco was right there stepping in, but at the same time held himself back from attacking the other person. Draco wanted to be with Blake wanted him as his own. Today when Blake had said ‘Your mine’ during potions his inner self had reared its head. It wanted to make that true, to make Blake his and himself Blakes. Show the whole world they were each others and no one elses. And now that he had come to terms with what he was feeling there was burning inside himself, his veela side was going crazy with want. That is what sucked about being a dominate veela, you had to use a lot of self-control, and right now that was really hard. He heard a knock at his door and whipped his head towards it wonder who it was.
“That’s brilliant Granger” Pansy squealed “Its romantic in a way, you’ll get to know one another better by talking then when the day finally comes you can be together”
Hope you all are still enjoying, at this point I'm letting the story do as it pleases and continuing to have fun with it. As always feel free to let me know your ideas.
Draco stiffened but only for a moment then his body instantly relaxed and leaned into the hug. At the words Blake spoke it felt as if all the weight, sadness, anger, loneliness, and hate flooded out of his chest. The tears stopped, the head ache stopped, and he felt light like a weight was lifted from his whole body. They sat there for a little longer Blake just rubbing circles on Dracos back.
“Well lets get going, the sooner the better.” With that he turned around and walked out of the room. The other three following after.
“Lets go to breakfast Dray” she said. He nodded and followed her out and to the great hall. He saw the two other boys sitting at the complete opposite end of the table. He went to make his way towards them but felt a hand on his elbow. He looked back and saw Pansy shaking her head no. She led them to their normal seats and they sat down. Draco looked around and couldnt bring himself to eat any of it. Instead grabbing a mug and filling it with coffee.
“You have to eat, Blake already warned me you’d try to starve yourself and made me promise to force feed you if necessary” the dark haired boy said casually.
In the short time it took to argue with the head mistress Severus had gotten Blake into the isolation room and closed, locked and warded the door. Draco ran over and started beating on the door madly. He took out his wand and through every hex and unlocking spell he could think of at the door. When nothing happened and he could not get though he rounded on the three people behind him.
‘In, hold, out. In, hold, out’ Draco thought to himself and slowly he returned to himself. He stood straight up and walked to the doors of the great hall. Pansy and Blaise following behind. They made their way to the Slytherin table and sat down waiting for the first years to be brought in and sorted. Within minutes they were led in by Hagrid and the usual speech given, the usual song, and the usual screams and applause when a new student was welcomed into the house. Draco could really care less nothing was the same anymore not without him there.
The potions were sitting in front of the three groups bubbling, and four of the students looked very worried at the moment. Because any minuet now it would be time for them to write down their notes which would include what each person smelled. Draco wasn’t worried at all, considering the one he loved was gone, his eyes saddened and started to glaze over with tears.
Harry decided to make his way over to a chair set off to the side on its own. On his way over he stopped and got another glass of wine. He sat down and watched Hermione and Blaise dance; he couldn’t help but smile when he saw the joy in her eyes. It had been absent for far to long all thanks to their….. former friend now. Soon he was gazing out over the room looking for the blond haired boy he wanted to see. He hadn’t seen Malfoy at all, all night and it was starting to cause him to be depressed. The whole reason he had even come was to get a chance at being near him.
"Oh, of course!" Skeeter grinned away her plain disappointment, both the quill and parchment slinking back into her bag. She aimed her grin at Hagrid. "How trying for your first year! I would love to tell your side of the story."
"Everyone born in proper families has godparents, Potter," Malfoy sniffed. He shifted a little on his feet though.
"So, you're thirsty and might have a fever." She put a hand to his forehead and frowned. "Actually, you are a bit warm." She waved her wand over him, and he fought a shiver. He had to be imagining it lately—sometimes he thought he could
"I didn't think about it until later!" Malfoy yelled. "I would have asked, but you were rather passionate at the time!"
"Such betrayal," he breathed, hand coming up to cover his mouth. Two of his guards had come in at the signs of the Killing Curse to drag away the body, not looking at him. Nicholas ignored them, too, to come to sit by his fire.
Harry nodded, thinking. "So… it is possible that she could have told Voldemort about the tournament, and now a Death Eater is here at Hogwarts. Do you think he's here on Voldemort's orders?"
the next day that Potter was lying-liar who tried to use his lying-lies to lure innocent victims like himself into girls' public toilets and get them into trouble. The thought actually got a very begrudged grin from Harry because wouldn't that be a hell of a follow-up for today's article.
"If they did, they didn't ask it loud enough," Harry agreed. "Okay, take a step back. I'm going to open it."
Malfoy was already hurrying to the dungeon. He sent Harry a sharp wave over his shoulder without looking back.
"No, no, I just mean, Professor Trelawney. She, well… she's bloody morbid, to be honest. Especially when it comes to me. I only ever get good marks when I'm predicting my own doom and gloom."
Malfoy performed the invisible-bubble charm before Harry opened the second entrance, and he was a little amused by how Malfoy resembled a kid in a candy shop as he bounced over to his things. The first thing he did was release and open a large chest that tripled in size once opened. Harry had to keep his mouth from dropping open when the chest unfolded on itself to create a large work section, complete with shelves, a small prep table, and even an icebox underneath.
. Harry was terrified the whole time. He sometimes still had nightmares, sometimes still slowed down when in that corridor just to make sure no more writing was on the wall. He sometimes thought he could still hear Riddle's voice, see him in the corner of his eye calling the basilisk forward.
For whatever reason, that seemed to become the main criterion with them because if they mentioned anything else, almost literally anything else, some form of argument broke out. It was as if the novelty of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, putting aside their rivalry to harvest a basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, was rapidly wearing off in favour of their usual and habitual animosity. Harry's casual, "Wow, that's a pretty advanced spell" was a catalyst to a detailed monologue in all the ways he was inferior in spellwork. Likewise, Malfoy's small admission at another point of, "I got the idea when Professor Flitwick cooed over Granger's latest essay," was met with a spitting rant about Malfoy's prejudices.
"Sirius!" he cried, rushing to him. He had seen Mr Diggory do this over the summer, so he was able to quickly deduce it was a fire-call. He grinned as he dropped in front of his godfather who was looking tremendously better than the last Harry saw him. "How are you?"
, allowing him the simple gratification of observing whatever he liked. The experience sprouted holes so deep in his avoidance bin that old memories Harry had been doing well without resurfaced.
"Never mind me, how are you?" Sirius returned seriously. "That was a mighty deep sigh I just heard."
was and its reputation, something Luna apparently took as gospel, but Ginny ended by smiling and declaring Luna all right in her books.
Draco gave Blaise a thankful look, spooned their potion into a few vials, and hurried to the side table to sort them. So focused again on
"Who here can tell me the importance of adding the drops of frog blood last?" Professor Snape asked the class.
He curled his knees up to his chest and, taking off his glasses to have them dangle in his hands, buried his face in his knees. He took slow even breaths.
Harry shrugged back at him. He noticed Malfoy also had his wand out, but it wasn't lit and just hung loosely in his hand. Harry resumed, "I guess we caught him off guard, and when we saw he was running, we kind of confronted him. He admitted to us that he never actually did any of those things in his books, instead he stole the stories and
He very quickly made his way to the second floor where he left his Cloak and map then back to Gryffindor tower. He was exhausted but still took a shower, longer than he needed but he chose not to think on why, and went to bed feeling more relaxed than he had in weeks.
, I can't explain it. I mean look, look how dry my skin is," he showed her his hands, "and my lips too. I can't go more than a few minutes without wanting to just chug water—I keep having dreams about water—which sounds insane, I know, but trust me, it's so much weirder experiencing it."
Was it a test for Malfoy? A way Snape was showing extra favouritism by challenging him, stretching his knowledge to make conclusions on his own that Snape usually just told other students.
Harry idly wondered if this was what he was starting to do the night before, but Harry only thought he was dragging his feet.
And Malfoy himself seemed to have lit up. He had a smile on his face, a genuine one, and his eyes seemed to dance in mirth. He looked so pleased, Harry could…
Harry nodded again. "I guess, what I mean is… What are your thoughts on," he took another deep breath, "people who don't like… thegenderthey'resupposedtolike."
Then Ron ruined both of their good moods by attempting to wrangle Hermione into going to the ball with one of them, offending her as he did so. After she stormed off, Ron scoffed, "She's lying."
The front entrance to the castle was now covered with fairy lights with many bushes, stone statues and ice sculptures, the tell-tale noise of fountains, and many paths dotted with benches. Harry supposed it was meant to be romantic, and he wondered what it would be like, to be there with someone he had romantic feelings for.
They left the kitchens with arms full of sweets, and Harry laughed along with Ron about how easy it was despite Fred and George always making it seem like a grand feat. He was happy at the way Ron took a shining toward Dobby and hoped with Hermione that the other Hogwarts elves took to emulating Dobby rather than Winky.
Harry clenched his jaw. He hadn't been missing that every time Slytherins come up, she began to hedge an obviously reluctant conversation. Each time, it made him feel caught out, that she knew of his secret meetings with Malfoy or worse. Malfoy didn't help either, the bastard. He hadn't let up on Harry—Harry doubted he ever would—but the timbre of his taunts had taken a turn. Harry liked to imagine it was to soften the blows or something. He wasn't stupid enough, however, to think it had anything to do with Harry but instead more likely to ensure Harry wouldn't get angry enough to stop taking him to the Chamber.
Cedric had apparently decided to bring Cho Chang, and Harry couldn't help but notice how good they both looked. They also looked happy and like they couldn't quite believe they were there with the other. Fleur was with Roger Davies, who was practically drooling after her, and Krum was with…
"You're to go in here with the other champions." Her voice was slightly shaky but sounded determined all the same. "Mr Bagman is in there… he'll be telling you the—the procedure… Good luck."
Harry did practise allowing himself his 'abnormal' thoughts. Giving himself that blanket permission, however, opened him up to a whole world of distractions.
think about certain people..." he trailed off, not knowing how to finish that without giving himself away and feeling panicked he already did. "Never mind."
I know this is a shorter chapter, but the next one is the Yule Ball. I wanted it separate and didn't want anyone to wait a whole week for a small thing again.
The closest he came to letting himself think about it was worrying over the whole bloke-thing of the matter, but as he already had enough to worry about, he tried not to.
"I'll have you know I had to suck up to that oaf Hagrid about his outrageous, illegal skrewts just to get access to the Restriction Section's unit on magical creat—"
"Listen, I knew Bertha. She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot, frankly. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It's not a good combination, Harry. I'd say she'd be very easy to lure into a trap."
He smiled brightly at her. "I'm sure they did, Luna. I hear there's also going to be ice sculptures."
Dean nodded and paused buttoning his waistcoat to toss it to him. Harry frowned at him as he caught it. Dean had been staring at Seamus who was now pointedly ignoring him.
"Yes, sir," Malfoy said quickly, scurrying past Snape. Once around him, he shot Harry one more unreadable look before disappearing around the corner.
Harry hadn't realised he had been bellowing at the top of his lungs until he ran out of words. Stone dust was falling down around them from how his voice echoed so strongly, the ancient stones rattled. The invisible bubble Malfoy had cast around his head felt to have expanded, working overtime to accommodate Harry's rapid breathing.
May this week be good! I'll be posting the next chapter in a few hours, life-permitting. I would right now but I need to proof it and, to be frank, food. Heads-up for some stan-Hagrid!
He found himself chewing his nails as he mulled over both negative and positive reactions from those closest to him. It wasn't that he hadn't ever thought about telling people before, but faced with the blunt suggestion of it made him feel like he would rather have to fend against a dragon again.
Silence passed between them a beat, Malfoy just staring at him. Slowly, he seemed to accept that as the apology it was and turned back to the basilisk. Harry let out a slow breath.
Honestly, if it was left to just Harry, Harry probably would have been down there for days, if not more, but Malfoy not only apparently had a knack for puzzles, he also seemed to be enjoying himself in the mystery. Whereas Harry dragged his feet and seriously considered just napping at a couple of points, Malfoy flittered all around the Chamber, demanding Harry to do any manual labour and having him hiss in Parseltongue at whatever he thought might do something.
," Hermione hissed, jerking her head to the shelves. It was Krum, and Harry released a sigh as subtly as he could. Krum had also been spending a lot of time in the library, but unlike the rest of them, Krum came with a bunch of giggly girls who would watch him. "They only like him because he's famous! They wouldn't look twice at him if he couldn't do that Wonky-Faint thing—"
Harry felt a lump in his throat form. He blinked several times to keep his vision clear. "Th-thank you, Professor. That—it means a lot."
"But of course," he answered, shrugging a shoulder as though it was the most logical thing in the world. "I wouldn't abandon the course, even with my history."
Harry and Luna had agreed to meet on the first floor as Luna was worried they wouldn't be able to find each other in the inevitable crowd in the entrance hall. Ginny, who was keeping to her promise to be Luna's friend, had agreed to meet Neville there as well. So, Harry and Neville broke off from the rest of the descending Gryffindors and grinned at each other when they turned the corner to find their partners dancing with each other.
Harry nodded, unable to find words. Snape spun around, robes billowing as usual, and stalked away. Harry turned back to Luna, who appeared to be giggling either with the sculpture or at something the sculpture somehow told her.
"Look, there were other circumstances around the Chamber being opened," Harry replied defensively. "And I have no idea how much you do and don't know, and if you don't know, I don't think I should be the one to tell you."
Harry grinned widely at her, wishing he had words to express himself, before hurrying into the tent and swallowing repeatedly to dislodge the lump in his throat.
He entertained himself a little bit by pretending the letter in his pocket was actually from his parents, telling him to damn what others thought and ask a bloke to the ball. Remembering the actual letter in his pocket depressed him enough to move to one of the windows, curling up on the ledge and thudding his head against the glass.
Hermione, of course, was a fixture in the library, and as Ron wasn't speaking to Harry, making Hermione Harry's best friend and what felt like his
"Ooh, trouble in paradise?" Malfoy cooed. He was back to smirking and held out a badge to Ron. "Well, here you go, Weasley, enjoy. I've got loads. But don't touch my hand, now. I've just washed it, you see; don't want Weasley slime on it."
When Professor Moody danced by and complimented Harry's socks, Harry proudly told them that Dobby the house-elf handmade them for him, which led to him explaining to Luna who Dobby was. For the first time that night, some shiness slid in her features when she asked if harry was willing to introduce them.
Professor McGonagall seemed thoroughly confused until her shoulders slumped woefully. Harry looked away, not knowing if what he saw was the beginning of pity or disappointment.
Luna tilted her head at the sculpture, seemingly waiting patiently until, "My name is Luna Lovegood, and this is my friend Harry Potter."
Hermione's eyes focused on the egg with interest, but Ron clapped and rubbed his hands. "That's great news! It's months away!"
Harry was opening his mouth to give a scathing remark back, but Luna, who Harry was embarrassed to admit he had not noticed was walking by, interrupted.
These thoughts were tricky nowadays, however. Inevitably, thoughts of his parents were quickly followed by ponderings of what they would think of
"That's because Ronald wanted me to pick a date for him and do all the work. He probably would have made me ask for him! This is different."
Harry refocused on the books in front of him, re-reading a paragraph on dragon talons that once might have been boring to him but was now bloody terrifying. He was so busy imagining just how painful being gutted by one could be that he almost didn't notice when a shadow fell over him.
Still, and even though Harry could admit he was probably imagining it, it felt like Malfoy's jibes stung less. He still carried on as always, but his eyes would shine as if Harry was somehow in on the joke himself. Harry could also feel him watching Harry, both in the Great Hall and the library.
"Excellent," Malfoy sneered back, although he did truly look pleased. "I'll have to do some measurements," he began, stepping back and using his hands to gauge the large beast, face pulling into a frown that Harry privately called the Malfoy-Potions face. It was one of pure concentration and focus, and for once, Harry let himself fully admire it.
Nicholas knew his valet wasn't stupid, and that he knew just as Nicholas did that it was a purposeful ploy to give them time to run. Wanting to spit fire, Nicholas snatched the scroll and read it quickly.
Harry himself was just in regular trousers and a jumper. He thought for a moment about removing the jumper, just wearing his vest, but as he was not going to be fighting basilisks and Riddle this time around, he figured he was probably going to feel the chill. It wasn't an important jumper anyway.
Harry, though, was pretty sure what Malfoy actually meant. Malfoy smirked back, telling Hermione that her words did have a nice ring to them, but Harry was tugging at Hermione's sleeve, trying to gently tug toward an empty classroom. Hermione fell silent, glaring at Malfoy but obviously trying to think quickly what Harry meant. He tugged again and used his foot to quietly kick open the door a little. Hermione frowned at the door, glared back at Malfoy, and gestured to the room.
all this tosh shoved onto me. Go ahead and hate me, making me miserable at every turn, making me feel like shit over things that
Harry grabbed one of the jars between the smallest and medium jars and approached Malfoy, still thinking of Hagrid. Malfoy flung out a hand without looking at him, and careful to avoid whatever was coating Malfoy's glove, Harry passed it over.
Was Harry trying to somehow give Malfoy a chance? Was Harry not only willing but also wanting to reach out—to see if Malfoy would reach back, to see if there even was a possibility of a middle ground?
Harry thought back to his dream. The other fantasies he had had. He stared openly at Malfoy's jaw and neck right then, wondering just how long that long neck could become when thrown back to give Harry access. It was an idle wonder, one that didn't much stir anything in Harry past the descending numbness he was giving himself over to.
Harry was taken aback, nonpulsed at the real venom in Malfoy's voice. Harry had definitely hit a strong nerve, and he didn't like how Malfoy's face was completely in shadow, ominously, but Harry could still feel his hateful glare like a physical weight. Every single one of Malfoy's walls that Harry hadn't even known had been down now slammed back up. Harry knew that the two Slytherins favoured each other over the other professors and students, but apparently, he had no idea the extent of it.
"That was excellent, Potter!" Professor McGonagall cried, which Harry considered high praise hard-earned. Her hand was visibly shaking as she pointed toward his bleeding shoulder where her hand had been just an hour or so before. "You'll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score… Over there, she's had to mop up Diggory already…"
He was pleased himself, he supposed. He didn't get a definitive answer whether Malfoy believed him or not, and he didn't want to appear so pathetic as to actually ask, but Malfoy had said 'okay'. It was perhaps a foolishly optimistic hope, but it was still hope that Malfoy
He had about another hour before lessons began, and if he was going to have any hope of surviving the day, he needed to get his emotions under control.
"The hall looks grand as well. I've enjoyed the music, even if the Weird Sisters are something my father would scoff at."
the Chamber of Secrets was something he should have ever done, he didn't know, and he marched back to Gryffindor tower.
That was around the Yule Ball, and now it was the end of January. He couldn't figure it out, what was making him so dehydrated. It was embarrassing enough as it was, with the others noticing he drank practically a whole pitcher of water at every single meal. But it was just getting worse and worse. He was now carrying around a travel goblet, only taking sips from it when he knew no one was looking. Which he could deal with, sure, but this…
"Oh, yes, you do," she replied, sounding stricter. "Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball."
. We decided then we were going to go after Ginny—just me and Ron, mind, with Hermione petrified and all—and bring him with us."
Harry felt humiliated at the thought as well. He couldn't imagine going back to Professor McGonagall and Hermione to tell them that he was mistaken.
“He wasn’t in our room he was…….” Blaise stopped when Snape shot him a cold look. ‘Yep were all in trouble now’ the Italian thought.
The day had passed quickly after that and soon the four were making their way to the common room after dinner. Blake still hadn’t said anything to Draco but at the same time didn’t completely ignore him. Blaise had spoken to him but not in the same manner he usually would. Guess he really meant the whole them being even when he witnessed the groveling. They made their way through the opening in the wall to the common room. Blake made his way to the couches before Blaise stopped him.
“None taken chap, you already know your not my type” he laughed and sat back enjoying the company of others.
“Get some sleep Draco you need it” the other whispered and started to move away slowly. Draco instantly tightened his grip on the boys’ hand.
I apologize for being so late on updating. I lost my younger brother this past week and its been very hard on the family. Please everyone don't be scared to talk to someone if you need to. There is always someone there who will help, you mean the world to your family and friends. If need be message me don't sit there alone, go to someone. Please everyone take care of yourselves You.Are.Loved
Of course, the person of his inner conflict would show up at the most inopportune time. He stood up and padded across the floor to open the door. Blake stood there in a pair of silver silk pajamas staring at his feet. He looked up when Draco opened the door and smiled, then his eyes wandered to Dracos bare chest and his face went red.
“Damn you Malfoy, don’t curse the day as soon as you wake up! At least give yourself a chance to enjoy it possibly!”
“Well I smell a musk, sandalwood, warmth, and I don’t know but it smells good” Ron went red again as everyone laughed including Draco. He knew what that last smell was it was Blaises imported cologne.
“ Draco Darling, please write me within the first week that you are at school” Narcissa said to her son with pleading eyes. She had watched her son die inside over, and over again, over the past few months. His once glowing platinum blond hair was now dull and limp. His ice gray eyes she once looked to, to bring her happiness in the hard times were now lifeless. She had held him everyday since the day Harry Potter died saving them all from The Dark Lord. He swore to her Harry was his mate, saying he felt the pull the smell, the instant spark and connection. She had tried to suggest to him that there was another there he might not have seen or was nearby that was his mate due to the fact after Potter died Draco was still alive. And being a Veela all knew once the Veelas mate perished so did the veela. But that had ended in her son throwing her out of his room and locking himself in for four days. After that she never brought up other possibilities to her son in fear of him doing the same again or possibly going further.
“Don’t go, everyone goes” he murmured sleepily and moved a little closer. Blake froze for but settled back where he was leaning before and the other as well. The last thing Draco remembered before dozing off into a dreamless sleep was Blakes whispered promise.
“Draco I cant tell you now or ever I can only give you what I already have” the boy paused then continued “remember sometimes there is more there than what you can see with your eyes” Blaise staired into Dracos eyes for a few moments then smiled.
He took a whiff of the steam and his eyes snapped open in surprise. He had to be tricking himself, it wasn’t possible. He got closer and smelled again getting the same response. He looked up at everyone in surprise.
“I wanted to have at least one normal year in a school. To be around others, make friends, and live like a normal person. So after begging and pleading I was allowed to come here to Hogwarts” he finished and looked up to the others waiting for the next question.
“Good you need it” the blond said watching as the four people made their way to the Slytherin table.
“Yes Professor Snape Ill follow these rules” the venom in those words caused Snapes heart to clench.
“Don’t get a big head Malfoy I think my owl is pretty too” Blake laughed out. Draco reached out and smacked him in the back of the head.
“ Ten gallons says neither of you can get Hermione or Ron to go to Hogsmeade with you by dinner” if there was one thing that the two loved more than anything it was showing up the Blond and having bragging rights.
Draco sat the letter down on his lap and stared at the wall in front of him. He had deeper feelings for Blake then what he was letting himself see. He should have known especially with him always pushing away the little things that kept popping up in his head. His mother had seen it right way, why hadn’t he. Because he was an idiot that’s why, he didn’t want to acknowledge them because to him that would be disgracing Harry. His mother was right though Harry would be upset if Draco were making himself miserable because of Harry. He wanted to say it was his veela holding him back that it wouldn’t let him think or be with the other boy, but that wasn’t the case.
Breakfast was soon over and as the girls and Blake made their way out of the hall Blaise stood up to follow. Draco caught the letter being passed to Blake but was surprised to see one being passed back right then and there too. Draco and Ron caught up quickly to Blaise who had slowed his steps after exchanging the letter with Blake. The Italian slipped said letter to Draco right before they walked into potions. Even though Draco knew Blake wouldn’t be sitting next to him anymore it still hit home and hurt when they all sat down and Blake was all they way across the room. His skin started to boil when a Gryffindor sat down on the other side of Blake that was not taken up. Said boy was leaning in way to close and being way to friendly. Blake said a few words and gave a shy smile but other than that he did not seem interested, but the boy didn’t seem to get the point. Draco was about to stand up when Blaise shouted.
“Actually, you’ll see him, you’re not to talk to him or be within twenty feet of him” the Italian said slowly waiting for the out burst that was sure to come.
“Come on we need to get back, we all have enough assignments we need to get started and finished” Draco said and the others sighed. They made their way back to the castle and to the dungeons, they were met with a group hovering around the information board, most looked a little panicked. They pushed their way forward and read the posting.
Draco was woken by rustling in the room and soft voices. He stiffened as his mind raced trying to get its bearings, but then the night before came to the forefront and he settled back. The rustles had to be coming from Blaise or Blake.
“Draco look at me” he said sternly but the blond didn’t move or say a word. “Damnit Malfoy! Look at me”
“Yes, Draco, I did I’m his closest friend right now that’s ALLOWED to be near him right now. At least Until we figure out how to fix this issue of you being near him. Just know he’s almost as bad as you are right now since he can’t be around you” Blaise looked down with a sad look. This was not fair to either of them after all they had been through, they should have what they want.
Draco flopped down on the couch beside Pansy and stared off water pooling at the sides of his eyes. “Pans I fucked up” was all he said.
“Oh Draco I’m so sorry, but know Blaise and I are here, we will find a way to get you through this”  she said and rubbed his knees. Blaise didn’t say anything but watched on he knew Draco knew he was there and would do anything possible to help. The train was starting to slow down from the speed it had been at for the majority of the trip. “Come on Dray lets get in our robes we don’t have a lot of time” with that Pansy stood up and grabbed her robes and stepped out of the compartment to go change. Draco and Blaise changed quickly and silently a few short minuets after they were dressed pansy reentered. Shortly after that the train came to a stop and the three friends gathered their trunks and such and left the train and made their way to the carriages not even paying any mind to the beasts that pulled them.
“I promise to never leave you Draco….” Draco didn’t hear what was said after that because he was already gone, to the realm of sleep.
“That’s ok just means you’ll probably have multiple detentions” Draco said as he sat up his area as well
“And you didn’t think to say anything about your friend coming to Hogwarts at all” Draco asked but really was an accusation. He was a little irritated with his friend, big news like this should be shared.
“I do see that but Im not going to sit back and watch you sleep with anything that has legs. Go sew your oats but im looking for a real relationship now. I don’t have to wait” she threw back to him.
“I know its only been maybe twenty four hours but talking to Blake or listening to him, it all slips away when he’s around” He looked at Pansy to see if she understood. She nodded for him to continue.
“I was going to read while you all hung out, I don’t want to be a bother” was the soft reply from the boy. Blaise looked at him sadly then turned a questioning gaze to Draco.
“Thank you, Blaise we’ll consider it” she said politely then stepped up and grabbed both boys and drug them towards the Gryffindor common room.
Dracos eyebrows drew together in thought. The two smartest people in…. then it hit him, the Italian was talking about Hermione and that meant the other two would be Ron and Pansy. What confused him most was why the two Gryffindors wanted to help. Yes, over the past few days they had become a more prominent part of their group, but he didn’t think it was enough for them to actually want to help. Unless Blaise and Pansy were making them. Apparently, that thought was written all over the blonds face because the next thing he knew he was being hit with a pillow to the face.
“Its Black to you Weasley. There’s nothing to discuss now leave, you have no reason to try and force your way into a ladies room. If you wont leave then I will make you” Harry said in a deadly tone. Hermione stood back she knew when he used that voice not to interfere.
“Damn you! Do you have to throw that damn Charms book at me every time? You are a wizard use a damn hex every now and then I don’t want brain dama…. Shit, fuck, you’re such a bitch in the mornings. You send another stinging hex like that towards me and I’ll pour all your potions down the drain” when Draco heard that he sat up quickly and looked around to find the Italian boy so he could hex him as well for the threat.
“And how is that my fault I just wanted a nap is that a crime” at this point he had sat up and had his back up against the front of the couch rubbing his head. Draco slid down into the couch on Blakes left side and Pansy on the right. The smaller teen looked up when Pansy spoke next.
“Cheeky bastard” but it held no malice and a smile played at his lips. The two teens made their way to the great hall for lunch. And more than likely he would be in some shit with both Pansy and Blaise.
“We figured it’d be better to all sit together while we try to get through all this. The more the merrier right”
“Why would you call for Draco to get me you should have left him in your alls rooms and came yourself” Snape hissed as he jerked on his cloak.
“Well we were invited by the hosts personally I think it would be rude to not attend” she said with a smirk. Harry laughed at her he saw right through her.
Hermione was now standing behind him waiting her turn. She stepped up and when she did Draco actually reached for her and pulled her into a hug, shocking everyone. She smiled and hugged the blond back then turned to the others.
He had finally made it to the Gryffindor common room after stumbling around with a headache and nausea for about fifteen minutes. He needed a hangover potion bad and he knew who would have one handy. He started making his way up to Hemiones room when he heard a shout coming from the top floor where her room was, he picked up his pace and as he got closer, he could make out Ron yelling. When he made it to the last step, he was met with his sister standing in front of the door red in the face and eyes glistening with unshed tears. Ron was red from his hair down to his neck and he was screaming.
“ Not my place and he asked me not to say anything to anyone, so I didn’t, would have done the same for you Draco” Blaise glanced up then looked at the boy that still hadn’t said anything. “Well go on you’re not mute introduce yourself”  to anyone else that would have seemed harsh but to his friends they heard the playfulness.
“What do you have to take, and what for, maybe I can help you. I know potions I was trained by my god father” Blake wiggled around and tried to look away but Draco wouldn’t let him.
“Oh Draco! You didn’t tell him did you” the girl had thrown herself at him and was hugging him tightly and weeping. Ron had shed a few tears as well knowing there was pain there.
“One thing I will say about Potter Draco is that he never breaks a promise” The tall man whispered and pulled away. They both straightened themselves back up but the tall black haired man had a knowing smirk on his face. Draco gave him one back and they left it at that. Soon the others started flowing in, then finally the Slytherin group. Apparently Blaise wasn’t overly pissed at him because he sat on one side of him and Pansy the other, but he didn’t even look at Draco, Blake sat down glanced at the blond and went about setting up his station. Soon Snape began his lecture reviewing from last year.
Draco disrobed and walked to his chest pulling out his pajamas. He changed into the soft silk bottoms then tucked himself into his bed. He thought about the day passed and smiled to himself. He felt lighter like the weight he had been carrying around was slightly lifted. Then he frowned a little at himself, when had he become so touchy. He had never hugged Blaise, he had Pansy a hand full of times when consoling her yearning for the brown haired little loin she wanted so bad. Other than that Draco did not do contact, but here he was letting Blake just do what he wanted. He didn’t hate it but it confused him greatly. He really wished he could figure it out, it was there, ready to jump out at him from the back of his mind, but he couldn’t get it to come forward.
Blaise choked on his saliva and the other Slytherins looked surprised by the information. Rons face was now as red as his hair at the information he had let slip. The Slytherins were quick to let him know they were just surprised and it didn’t bother them in the least. Draco knew Blaise was doing a dance in his head right now.
Draco was standing in a clearing he had never been in before. The grass was a bright green and littered with small blue flowers, the warm breeze causing them to sway back and forth. Draco turned slowly taking in the sight, it was peaceful. The sky was a brilliant blue with wispy white clouds and the sun was high in the sky. When he turned back around, he saw two people standing at the other end of the field with their backs to him. Draco took a few steps towards the pair then stopped; something was familiar about them. He started walking to the pair again and as he got closer, he saw one had raven black hair and the other chesnut brown. The two suddenly turned around and smiled at him, Draco stopped in his tracks. There stood Harry and Blake side by side smiling at him. They both held out their hand to him waiting for him to come to them. Draco continued to stare on at them not knowing who to go to. He wanted to go to Harry he missed him so much and treasured the time he was allowed to dream about him and be with him. Then there was Blake he wanted to go to him just as much and hold him.
He walked up to her door and knocked softly after a few minuets she walked out, and Harry smirked at her. She blushed and hit his shoulder and walked past him down the stairs. She looked gorgeous and he had a feeling a certain Italian was going to enjoy watching her all night. She had tamed her hair and now had it falling in loose waves down her back. She was wearing a dark pair of skinny jeans that showed off her curves. The Black button up she wore fit just as well and she left the top three buttons open, not showing anything but also making you wonder what could be shown. She had on her Black family crest also, but what amazed him the most was how perfectly she walked in her black heals. He quickly caught up to her and offered his arm.
His eyes flew to Malfoy, who was turned around watching them, his face unreadable but diary and quill still in hand.
It only made Harry grin a little again, however, and he looked back to the sink and opened it. Without waiting for Malfoy, he jumped.
"My uncle Gary and his partner Leremy," she said easily, keeping her head up and straight forward. "They've been together my whole life. I know it's probably unusual here, still a little in the Muggle world, but my uncles have been together, out and proud, for… twenty years now? Going on twenty."
A little further down the path, they overheard Hagrid, who was speaking in a husky voice. It wasn't something Harry thought they should overhear, and he quickly hurried Luna back down the path, passing Fleur and Davies half-hidden in a bush.
journey, Harry. I daresay you will have decades to explore them all. For now, please just focus on what is immediate and at hand."
"Today, we will be brewing the potent poison, Weedosoros. Take great care to keep this concoction away from your hands and mouth. If you do swallow some of this poison, immediately proceed to the Hospital Wing. The rest of us shouldn't have to be bothered with your convulsing."
Also, please forgive any extra typos - no beta, and this thing doesn't support my usual spelling check software.
generous and sickeningly arse-licking—speech, from both Gryffindors and Slytherins. He could see Ron in the corner of his eye staring at him with his mouth literally hanging open. The room was dead quiet after, and Snape bored into his eyes in that way of his that made Harry suspect he had x-ray vision.
He turned to the cauldrons and checked each one. He stopped when he felt a presence next to him and glanced over to his adopted shadow and found the boy smiling at him. Blake took Dracos hand in his and squeezed, Draco squeezed back and smiled at him. Again, with those eyes, they always made him feel better, made the pain disappear. He liked how him and Blake had come to be able to communicate without words, they just understood each other. They stepped back and looked at the caldrons and nodded.
Draco started shaking at that last question. His breath started coming shorter and shorter, his chest constricting. He scribbled down a hasty ‘Yes and he’s dead’ then forced himself out of his seat and ran out of the room. Blake jumping up just as he ran out the door. Draco ran down the corridor not even knowing where he was going, he ran until he felt far enough away from anyone then slipped into an alcove. He pressed his back up against the wall and slid down puting his throbbing head between his knees. He did his best to hold back the pain but after so long it was to much and a heart wrenching sob fell from his mouth. He hurt so horribly he just wanted it to stop he’d rather feel nothing ever again then to feel this.
Harry cleared his throat, suddenly feeling awkward. "And I found Ginny, killed the basilisk, and we left."
He looked at their table, to the board, then back to the table. He and Ron had the flame too high, the excess goosegrass was gone, and no nicotine had been added. As he assessed this, their cauldron began to shake.
The dragon keepers were rushing over to reign in the Horntail, and Harry turned his broom toward the entrance where he saw Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Hagrid running toward him and beckoning him over. He landed smoothly just in front of them.
"I won't lie and say that there wouldn't be some push-back, and no doubt that such a public display would fuel the
"Tomorrow night," Harry answered without thinking first. He internally winced. If he didn't have enough time tonight, he doubted he actually would tomorrow.
when he thought Harry could have any girl he wanted. He couldn't imagine if Harry actually had decided to take the plunge and ask a bloke— if the bloke said yes. He would like to imagine he would have informed any relevant parties about it beforehand, but at the same time, what if he did want to keep it private until the ball? He would feel humiliation and shame coarse through him every time Ron badgered him about it. How nervous he would feel about Ron finding out when Ron showed that much interest from the get-go?
Dobby now looked healthy and happy. Clearly, freedom suited him, which was more than Harry could say for Winky. The difference between them was striking, one bubbly and bragging about his new wages, the other gloomy and horrified, bound and determined to stay loyal to her former master.
He had just snuck toward the tent's flap to peek outside when two figures rushed in: Hermione and Ron.
"They don't exist!" he snapped once when Luna mentioned to him that something called Blinkweses had a habit of locking themselves in briefcases by chewing on the metal latches.
As successful as Harry had hoped that odd night was with Malfoy, the next day, Malfoy acted like nothing ever happened. Harry didn't know what he expected, but he had expected
The slide down was exactly as he remembered, and he would like to have said his landing was significantly more graceful. Perhaps encouraged by Harry taking the first jump, like Harry knew he would be, Malfoy wasn't far behind, and Harry had to quickly scoot away to keep the blond from slamming into him.
"I was on my way to give you this," his valet said with only a slight flinch. He held out a scroll. "Aarav and his child left this morning. They sent this all around the Manor before it was given to me to deliver."
to stop. It was driving him insane, and he refused to think about it. As a result, every wank put him in worse and worse moods.
Skeeter continued to Harry, "So, you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favourite lessons?"
"Then how do you know?" Malfoy asked, and his tone sounded so unfamiliar, Harry's head snapped back up.
"Probably one of his more impressive breaks, to be honest. The screens are probably easy to break, I guess—they're like a telly's screen—but that wasn't what he broke. He broke the computer itself. See, they come in two parts; one is a monitor, which has the screen, and the other is called the hard drive, I think, which is this big rectangle thing made of thick plastic. It has the wires and fans and stuff, and you connect to the monitor, right? I suppose one side of it where the wires connect can be fragile, but he broke it from the side, through the hard plastic. I don't know how he did it, probably just sat on it with how big he is—his school has actually required him to go on a diet—last summer was nothing but grapefruit, I swear—and he—"
badges, too, even among the Slytherins. A few Slytherins still tried to taunt Harry with Skeeter's article, but they weren't getting nearly as many laughs, and they seemed to be giving up.
Both Harry and Malfoy jumped apart, Malfoy spinning around, to find Snape down the path and looking murderously at Harry.
Some of them were admittedly depressing: dying alone from a home accident and not being found for days because no one cared to look in on him; committing suicide because he was so miserable and no one ever found out and his name went down forever as merely missing when people eventually noticed he was gone, being murdered because a loved one finally got sick of looking at him. Despite that, they were still funny, or at least they were the way Malfoy presented them.
," Malfoy pressed over his interruption, "I encountered all manner of foul information about creatures not even your basilisk and dragon-slaying self could manage."
I've seen a ton of fics wherein Hermione has gay uncles. I don't know where it started nor currently find an example, but it's a headcanon I personally like. It's also a useful tool for fics like these. When I originally sketched out his coming out since with her, I had meant to put more backstory behind the uncles, but I forgot. I have a few other places I could put it in, so we'll see. (And of course, I gave the gay uncles backstories!)
The only thing Harry had, his only saving grace, was the letter he received from Sirius later that night and the prospect of talking to his godfather face-to-face in a fortnight.
"Immediate and at hand" that you'll see in this chapter is something my mother always told me in times of great stress. It's become a mantra of mine lately. Right now, my mother is really sick and in a skilled facility, so if anyone wants to pass along encouraging words, please do. I will buy a card for each, writing your well-wishes inside, and send them to her. (I can't physically visit because of COVID… )
He wanted to bring his list to Madam Pomfrey, but Merlin, she really didn't like him. He didn't think she would take him seriously.
Despite Harry's prediction of the ball, he was actually having a good time. He didn't much fancy going over to see what was wrong and have his mood brought down. So, he agreed.
He was sitting in the Potions lab telling himself to focus. To concentrate. It was starting to get ridiculous—really, it was. At first, he didn't think twice about how much he started drinking water during meals. It was Greg's comment that Draco must piss like a racehorse for Draco to realise that, despite how much he drank, no, he didn't. Clearly, his body was absorbing the water, and he told himself he must have just been dehydrated.
There was a muted squish sound as Malfoy did something with the tools, hunched a little over the beast.
For all he knew, he could go to the ball that night, see not only all the Hogwarts girls but the ones from the other schools, dolled up and looking beautiful, and he could realise that he found them attractive after all. That all of this was just some sort of freak out because of the dangers of this year. That he was fixating himself on an actually small, minute blip, and that once he met the right girl…
"Wow!" Harry gushed. He rushed over to hug her. "You look amazing, Hermione!" He stepped back and held out his hand to Krum. "Krum," he greeted.
"Just a bit warm. Better safe than sorry," Draco said easily, not wanting to worry them. At the same time, this ridiculousness had to stop. "Go on, I'll join you soon."
"I'm proud of you, Harry," Hermione said. Harry dragged his wide eyes away from the professor to look at her. She seemed very cautious and was frowning, but she still gave a quick, small smile. "That was very big of you."
Draco closed his eyes. His skin felt hot. Sweat beaded his brow. It was just the potions, he told himself. The heat from making the potions. That had to be it, that was why he was extra thirsty right then, that was why he felt hot. Just the potions.
"I didn't know you had a godfather," Harry said thoughtfully, watching as Malfoy messed with some jars and something that looked like an ancient scythe.
Malfoy stood in front of him, lips parted, face blank, and staring at Harry with eyes that shone with an emotion Harry couldn't place. Slowly, what Harry had just spewed—and to
It was slow going, as Harry didn't have it in him to be creative at the moment, but after the third time Malfoy interrupted him to grab one thing or another, inspiration struck.
He didn't like to think too hard about telling Ron about his abnormality— or his… whatever. His whatever. Besides, Professor McGonagall said herself that
Malfoy was looking back at him, expression still hidden in the shadows. This time, Harry couldn't make out his tone as he said, "How… Slytherin of you."
"Thought about it? Yeah! But," Harry inexplicably stepped closer, finding that he really wanted Malfoy to know the
No, most of his wanks were just his body reminding him that it existed and had needs. He would do a shower routine almost daily, and occasionally, like tonight, plan out a wank in hopes of… oh, he didn't know. Stress relief? Was that a good enough excuse? Honestly, he just wanted to feel good. He loved the toe-curling experience of climaxing.
"Didn't mean to scare you," Pansy purred. Or, he was pretty sure she thought she purred. Her voice was always so high-pitched, it sounded more like a suspended squeal. "I have some potion that can help."
He stumbled to the sink, to rinse out his mouth and splash his face, but the moment he smelled the water, he almost lost it. It felt like the potion dehydrated him more, if possible. He didn't realise how
"Er…" Harry shuffled on his feet, extracting his arm from Luna to rub the back of his head. "I just mean… I mean, you both look… but yeah, you… erm…"
He blamed the dream. He blamed the wanks. He blamed his life being a complete nightmare, and because of the dream and the wanks, and finding out that Malfoy—
Their spells ricocheted off each other. Goyle was sent to the hospital wing, Snape brought Hermione to tears at her rapidly growing teeth, and both Harry and Ron lost Gryffindor fifty points and got detention each. If that wasn't bad enough, he was removed from Double Potions for stupid press photos and the Weighing of the Wands for the Tournament. Even if Harry wasn't having a problem wanking for girls, he had a sneaky suspicion Rita Skeeter could put him off females for life.
and apparently, a few other spells at the door, including a locking one, Harry surmised when he tried to push it.
Harry scrubbed at his lips and jaw, trying to stop grinning and push down the humour of the thing. It wasn't funny—it
"Right," Malfoy drawled, eyes narrowed. "You expect me to believe someone—other than me—wants you dead so badly they would go through all this trouble. Right. Just like we're supposed to believe you fought the Dark Lord at eleven, slain a basilisk at twelve, and fought off hundreds of dementors at thirteen. No, it sounds to me like this is just another year where Precious Potter has found a way to make himself a hero of legends once again."
The next night, Harry found Malfoy in the toilets, speaking surprisingly amicably with Moaning Myrtle. There was always a fifty-fifty chance of running into her, and it seemed Malfoy had learned what Harry had, which was the best way to keep her as calm as possible and ensure she wouldn't tell on them was to be nice to her.
Some of them were eerily reasonable, considering Harry's life: struck down by evildoers, cursed by begrudged peers, sacrificing himself to save a friend, even just simply death by quite literally being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Those weren't so funny, and Harry wondered what it meant that Malfoy presented them as ideas so obvious, he was sure Harry had already used them.
On Christmas Eve night, Harry laid in his bed watching the moon slowly trek across the sky. He waited until he knew the commons would be empty, everyone asleep, before he snuck out of the dorm. Staying awake on Christmas was a habit he formed when he was little, wanting to stay up to catch Father Christmas and ask how he can start being a good enough boy for presents. He had long since stopped believing in Father Christmas, but the habit of wondering how to be better stuck.
Harry threw out his hands in a frustrated gesture but didn't answer. He was very aware of Krum watching them now, and while he didn't think Luna would exactly put it all together or realise this wasn't just an extension of the small talk they've been having all night so far, he didn't know about Krum. There was little he could do about how disastrously obvious he had been, but he could defend himself to Malfoy that he just didn't want a fight to break out so he blurted something that would shut them up. But Krum?
"I do as well. Their earlier music is much faster and louder. You know, the Weird Sisters first formed when they were students here. My father said Dumbledore allowed them to perform concerts on the Quidditch training grounds."
She held up a finger, telling him to wait, and disappeared into her office. He must have been very dehydrated this time. The last two times, she just told him he was slightly dehydrated, nothing a couple of glasses of water wouldn't fix.
Harry bounced once on the balls of his feet again, hands in fists in his pockets. "Yeah," he agreed, but he couldn't look away from Malfoy.
Even better, Luna approached him the next day in the Great Hall to tell him that another Ravenclaw, Padma Patil, Parvati's twin, was willing to go with Ron. Ron was less than thrilled but accepted under the mean glare Parvati was giving him.
—didn't believe him, any of it, of anything that had happened to Harry, was just too much to bear. Because it meant Malfoy's predictions of what would happen to Harry in the tournament was something he actually believed. Because it meant that Malfoy fully expected Harry to make a fool of himself and die. That Malfoy wasn't just being hateful toward Harry but quite literally
They decided to take their own butterbeer break and walked together toward the buffet. It was here that Ludo Bagman found them, wasting no time in starting in about Harry's lead in the tournament and subtly offering his help.
Draco bit back a groan, cracking his neck. The skin pulled tight, uncomfortable, and for a moment, it was like his lungs had to remember to accept oxygen. "I don't think so. Professor McGonagall will probably just bring in owls or cats or something for the practical."
"Yes, I'm very happy to have this opportunity. I've heard great things about the ball, and I get to help a new friend."
Malfoy opened a few cabinets and began to mix something that glowed slightly. Harry obligingly added his own
Harry looked back up at Snape, meeting his cold eyes. He could almost hear Malfoy taunting him with how Gryffindor this was, but he made a snap decision to go with his impulse and take a leap of faith.
The scraping of stools on the floor made him jump, and he realised that Snape had put up the ingredients for them to start brewing. Ron, as always, had gotten up to gather said ingredients, and Harry set to work filling their cauldron with water and setting the flame. Some of the base ingredients they already had stored in their respective kits, and Harry checked both his and Ron's to see them still reasonably stocked.
Pansy had been holding out for him, after all. And she was dense enough to believe him if he said he wanted to wait for physical stuff until he was married, and smart enough to leave it well alone.
Malfoy still didn't move though. Harry gulped a few times, roughly and purposefully swallowing the lump that had tried to form there.
It was so far from their usual banter or teasing, it was almost alien, but Harry knew it was the best she could do at the moment. So, he played along. "Yes, mother."
"Apparently!" Harry threw out his hands, barely missing Malfoy's face with his bag. He yelled out for the second entrance to open and stomped into the chamber.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, Hermione and I are close, so I can attest you have one of the best people on the planet on your arm. I don't know whether to congratulate you or give you the shovel talk."
Malfoy's slowly closed his eyes, letting out a long put-upon sigh, and he hid his face. It wasn't something Harry expected Malfoy to do, and he wondered if the guarded, suspicious freak that was Malfoy was actually
Throughout the meal, there wasn't a single conversation that Luna was shy about adding her two knuts. Hermione and Krum largely went unbothered, deep in their own conversation, Fleur didn't deem Luna worthy of a reply, and Davies was too busy watching Fleur. But everyone else had at least one round with Luna. Ludo Bagman seemed puzzled but determined to entertain her with looks to Harry that suggested it was for Harry's sake. Karkaroff didn't seem to know what to think of her, and Harry quickly steered Luna way from him. Madam Maxime seemed to find Luna amusing, and Dumbledore seemed practised at humouring her. Percy, on the other hand, took her very seriously and was apparently unable to resist trying to correct her.
But then again, what if it was? What if he was actually self-destructive, searching for ways to ruin his life because he was an attention-seeking liar who thrived on drama and wanted to be special so much that… what was one of the deaths Malfoy came up with? That he would choke on the realisation that he was exceedingly average?
"You'll look a fool up there, I just know it. I'm looking forward to it. I think it's the perfect way to kick things off. Perfect Potter stomping on the other champion's toes."
"Correct. Five points to Slytherin. Upon consumption, the drinker will experience similar effects to what? Bulstrode?"
"A bit," Harry agreed, standing and wiping his hands. "And I wouldn't let your face get too close to the ground. There are loads of bones down here."
Draco stopped Greg from doodling, read over what Vinny had written, then set them about reading another section for what should come next in the essays. Depressed from the Healing books, his eyes started to wander instead.
After a weekend of blatantly hiding, Harry found himself alone in his dorm, trying to study, when a tap came to the window. It was almost pathetic, with how his heart rate picked up merely because he recognised the owl. Of course, he recognised the owl. It was the same owl he had seen make near-daily deliveries to the Slytherin table for four years now.
"The next task is February twenty-fourth at nine in the morning. This," he lifted the golden egg, "opens and is supposed to give me a clue about the second task to help get ready for it."
I am also so nervous when I try writing Luna, and it's one of the reasons I've never posted some things because she's in it. Like Snape, there is book-Luna and movie-Luna, but I don't think either is all that favourable about her? There are times they are, but still. At any rate, I've combined them. I want to give her more weighted value, I guess, but I apologise if my Luna is too OOC for some.
As he walked to the hospital wing, what was going to be his third visit for the month, he thought over his symptoms—because they had to be symptoms, right? It was honestly hard to pinpoint. Draco had avoidance and denial down to an art, could probably convince himself of things quicker and more efficiently than he could other people, so it was hard to think back to how things got this bad.
He returned to his notes, another possible symptom nagging at his brain. He kept trying to dismiss it because he never heard of anything like it, but now that he could really admit to himself that he had something
people all along. Harry had always had Hagrid, from the day he turned eleven, and even though he hated the idea of what Hagrid could think of him if he knew Harry was… Still, Hagrid, currently… "Yeh did it! An' agains' the Horntail an' all, an' yeh know Charlie said that was the wors'—"
Malfoy was slow as he approached it, a couple of times pausing to spin in place and take in the rest of the Chamber. He spent a long time looking at Slytherin's statue, and a longer time staring at the basilisk. He even came closer to its head where the sword's fatal blow was still visible.
It was far-fetch reasoning, but, "Yeah, alright," he sighed, letting his arms drop. "Fine, Malfoy. Let me know when you're ready to come back down here, and we'll do it."
Again, Harry was lost to the thread of conversation. He could hear Hermione was saying something, her tone sharp, but he could only remember that the last thing said was Luna's compliment. Without any consultation to his brain, he opened his mouth and words fell out.
He straightened, deciding he was going to be proud to have his friend on his arm. "Yeah," he agreed. "But for the record, Luna, I'd be your friend even if you didn't come with me. You still don't have to."
That afternoon, Harry and Hermione joined the Weasleys on the grounds for a snowball war. As the Great Hall was being decorated for the ball, there was no Christmas tea like usual, so they were able to play four-sevens. Hermione, however, left early to get ready for the ball, which apparently was going to take her three whole hours.
"I almost was," Harry shrugged. He shoved his hands in his pockets, thumbing one of the dragon books he brought with him. "Would be, if it wasn't for Fawkes."
"What?!" both Harry and Ron exclaimed. Harry had begun feeling cold where he felt numb before, strange duplicity running through him. Hermione's words lit a fire through it.
He was looking at Harry now, face completely and utterly unguarded. Harry's lips parted as he forced himself to take a breath.
"Dress robes will be worn, and the ball will start at eight o'clock on Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great Hall. Now then… The Yule Ball is, of course, a chance for us all to—er—let our hair down." She sounded woefully disapproving, and Harry eyed the professor's tight bun. "But that does
"You could have any girl at this school, you moron. You're Harry bloody Potter, and a champion to boot. But you choose to bring…" his eyes flicked back to Luna for a moment before he appeared to change direction. "To bring a friend."
Harry blushed. He felt like one of those forward fools from one of Dudley's programmes, swagging up to a lady to ask if she was single. Judging by those sitcoms, a slap in the face should shortly follow. Instead, inexplicably, Harry and Malfoy shared small smiles.
Malfoy, whose face was only lit by the bright moonlight coming in through the window, blinked at the door a couple of times then said flatly, "Right. Yeah, I'm leaving."
"Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now… You have to get ready for your first task."
Merlin, he felt insane just thinking about it, but there were serious conditions witches and wizards could get that affected their magic, their magical performance, or their magic getting sick itself. Rare, but possible.
people out there today on his side made him want to rebel, to push the boundaries and test if he really had the professor too.
That first fantasy of Malfoy had been a good one though. He believed it started with imagining an encounter with him in the locker room. He thought maybe he originally imagined that Malfoy had been waiting there, pouting until the pitch was clear, and Harry walked in to use those showers instead of just going back to the castle with Ron. And Malfoy would have gotten flustered over having been caught trying to wait them out, and Harry would have called him on it, and it would lead to them arguing, which would lead to them pushing at each other…
"No trick," Harry shrugged. "And I don't know. Look… you don't have to, you know. You don't have to come with me. But I really do know where the Chamber of Secrets is, and I really did fight the basilisk. I just want to prove it to you."
"Do you…" he opened, interrupting her. He hadn't been listening anyway. "Do you… ever, think about stuff?"
She gave him a watery smile and reached for Krum's hand, who didn't protest. They weaved their way through the crowd, presumably to find a better dancing spot.
did ten extra inches on my essay of the Summoning Charm detailing the properties that run parallel from the Vanishing Charm in order to ascertain the similarities and differences in both the theory and practical use that not only—"
Usually, Draco spent this time while they stumbled to follow his instructions by doing extra reading, getting ahead of his other assignments, or doing his own projects, such as creating Potter Stink badges. He was still proud of those—the charms weren't easy. That night, he was looking through Healer books while Vinny and Greg were writing an essay on a Transfiguration that was technically in last year's curriculum. Professor McGonagall generally assigned them extra credit like this to prepare them for upcoming lessons.
"—was up to par of my usual dedicated work but allowed me the opportunity for a more empirical application in my practice. Not to mention a ready excuse for when I was caught."
"Noted," Harry snorted. He started toward the bathroom then stopped and turned back to Malfoy, who hadn't moved and still had his wand aimed at Harry. "Can you put that away please?"
"You mean to tell me…" Malfoy opened, and for once, he looked like he was really trying to control his voice and volume, "that you
Hermione frowned, trying to look over at him even though she couldn't see him. She always did hate that about the Cloak. "Is this about Cho?"
"Skeeter was only there to get more information on Harry, to publish something else. I doubt she would have published anything about Hagrid or those monsters, to begin with, but Malfoy just ensured she won't go near it. Not only does his name and—" Hermione's eye twitched "—blood status give him a lot of weight, but the implications that the school's governors
Harry felt like his heart was going to beat out of his chest. He was taking in her words, but he was still stuck on, "Your uncles are…?"
That night, the three were in the library. Draco had already done his Transfiguration essay and Charms homework, but as usual, he got it done quickly because he knew his two closest friends were going to need re-teaching and a lot of help.
Though, perhaps he didn't know about that part. Harry was never sure exactly what got around the school as he never actually talked about outside of Ron and Hermione.
That, and as long as he didn't embarrass them, such as jumping so obviously into bed with someone and becoming the butt of gossip.
Hagrid had thrown himself bodily on the last skrewt, and as he wrestled it into a lead to tie it back up, he asked, "Who're you?"
—almost like using magic drained him faster when he was like that. As if using magic worsened his state.
So, he tried to think of girls, because he was a boy. That was how it worked. He was a boy; therefore, he was supposed to toss over girls, like his dormmates clearly did. He would think of nameless, faceless female figures doing things to him.
and Skeeter, and Ron and the rest of the school, about feeling trapped and alone, about how much he wanted to just be normal—but on that, he only elaborated enough to say that he was confused about some things and some people…
"I heard the champions have to open the ball," Malfoy continued, walking past Harry with his nose up.
Professor McGonagall raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised. "I see. I highly recommend letting in some other people, Mr Potter. Perhaps your friends, at least."
He was obviously starting to get desperate, and it must have shown. She considered him then pointed to a bed. Draco rushed to it, sitting readily. She came to stand in front of him, arms still crossed.
Later, as he stood invisible in the forest staring at four dragons, Harry wondered if he killed kittens or something in his past life to have deserved this. The dragons stood tall, strong, and seemingly invincible, breathing actual fire with roars that, if there were words attached to them, probably would burn just as much. He hated how his brain—almost poetically—compared them to the boy he left to see them, how similar they and the boy with their namesake were. And how dangerous they both were to him, yet both seemingly inescapable.
Harry blinked, his stomach falling all over again. They weren't just talking about him, they were originally discussing whether or not Harry would… that Harry apparently
"I was a right wanker," Ron said, some colour coming back in his cheeks. "I—I know you didn't put your name in, Harry. I just…" he looked to Hermione who was watching them both nervously, eyes wet. "I was jealous. I—I didn't understand… I
Harry's attention was caught from their work when Snape had gone a round of the classroom only to circle back to Malfoy's table where the blond was brewing with Crabbe. Or, rather, brewing with Crabbe there.
"Right," Harry said. He wondered how long he was going to hear about Malfoy doing his own work. He was regretting saying anything now.
In the shower, Harry tried not to be embarrassed by his body's reaction. Not willing to risk a wank with so many people around, Harry forced himself to think of the least appealing things he could imagine.
Krum nodded slowly, and Hermione plucked Krum's drink from his hands and shoved it at Harry as well.
Harry was darting back into his dorm and getting dressed before he could properly think about it. He snatched up the miniature Horntail, hoping against hope that its mere presence would give him some semblance of the courage he had the day before. What was
It was quiet with only distant echoes of dripping water, just like before, only this time, there were also small scurrying sounds, most likely rats running away from them. He felt an ominous chill being back. He was so caught up in proving Malfoy wrong, he hadn't thought what returning would make him
Snape barely sneered at it and didn't take any points. He also only snapped at Harry a couple of times, and Harry meanwhile would merely nod at him and do as he said.
He only got one floor down before he was bolting to the closest toilet and hurling. The potion, if possible, was vilest coming back up, and by the time he was left just panting over the toilet bowl, he was so thirsty and hot, he almost wished for death.
how he could tell just by the set of his shoulders—that Malfoy was pulling all his attention on his task. Trying not to feel confused, Harry focused on his own.
As always, Malfoy was already waiting, but this time had been waiting inside the loo, which Harry only found out when, ten minutes past their meeting time, Malfoy stuck his head out and hissed at him. Trying to convince an annoyed Malfoy that one wasn't late but was actually just stupid enough not to
"Here we are," she said coming back. She handed Draco a potion. "Take this, and that should clear you up. Must be the weather."
Dobby looked properly abashed, and Harry's immediate scolding to poke him or something next time didn't help. Guilt filled Harry when Dobby told him he was there to give Harry a Christmas present, so Harry lied and said he had one for Dobby as well. He thought shortly of giving Dobby a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks, but Harry didn't want to subject any part of that man to anyone. So, instead, he gifted a pair of his own socks, black with the Hogwarts crest.
With the most interesting meal of his life and the entrance of the Weird Sisters, Harry forgot they were supposed to open the dance. Luna, apparently, did, too, and it took Percy shoving them to get them to realise the other champions were already heading to the floor.
"Thank you, Harry, Luna. Viktor, these are two friends of mine. Harry, as you know, is one of my best friends. He's like a brother to me."
Malfoy's sneer slipped a little, probably at Harry not rising to his bait like he usually did. "You mean you don't trust your idiotic parents are watching over you?"
." He had a wild urge to tell her what happened with Professor McGonagall before the task but ignored it and only held her tighter.
She gave him a look as if she couldn't tell if he was being purposefully ignorant, but was displeased regardless. "If it is your wish for your partner to be male, you can."
" Malfoy read the cover. He looked back up at Harry, face hidden in shadow with his head still down. "Earlier you were reading about the anatomy of dragons and had a book on Chinese dragon culture."
"Harry, you were brilliant! You were amazing! You really were!" Hermione called. Harry could see what looked like fingernail indentions on her cheeks.
Malfoy looked slightly unsure of him for a moment but visibly reaffirmed his stance. "I sure as Merlin don't think you've been telling the truth."
Harry quickly decided after the first minute of climbing that from then on, Harry would go first because it was a struggle not to focus on what part of Malfoy was directly in front of his face.
Harry held up his free hand. "It's a joke, I promise. Sorry! You both look great, though." He looked Krum up and down and quickly looked away before anything caught too much of his attention. "Everyone is looking great, well… you haven't seen Ron yet, but he tried."
And if anyone is worried about how they bridge together, the Yule Ball makes big steps, mostly because of Luna. That is already written-BUT, if anyone has any ideas or wishes, please let me know!! I absolutely will put it in if I can!!
Draco grinned, feeling fond. "Because that's what we did last year for you. This second round, we have to try to learn it properly because you don't know what the thing will be ahead of time."
. The only thing I could think about when I was down here last was saving Ginny, my own life be damned! And since then, I try my very best NEVER to think about it! To NEVER think about how terrified I was! How that monster sounded when it came in, how it hissed, how
Harry shrugged again, moving forward to the hole. "It'll be a tight fit now. Dunno if you want to try to make it bigger?"
His eyes landed next on Pansy a few tables over who was staring dreamingly at Draco. He held in a grimace as she waved at him and acknowledged her with slightly waved fingers. Stupid Pansy, too, being a stupid girl with her stupid blooming chest and stupid mother-henning and stupid smell and her stupid
She lit up at the mention of having another friend, and Harry vowed to introduce them as soon as possible.
I think we can all see how plot began to form in this lol. Any thoughts on the matter are absolutely welcomed!
Luna let out a sound Harry assumed meant good humour. "I see. Don't worry, I know all the basic wizarding dances."
He scowled at her again, but apparently, that was all the help he was going to get. It was more than the last two times, at least. Draco struggled to stand, the potion heavy in his stomach, and slowly made his way out of the room.
It was almost an hour before someone entered. Professor Flitwick pushed through the door with an apparent bounce in his step, but he froze upon seeing Harry.
"Parseltongue," Harry grinned, knowing it was a button for the blond. "The sinks will open up and reveal a hole."
"This information is extremely important, Potter. With how you go stomping into any and everything, you would get yourself killed if you did this."
Harry blushed because if only Malfoy knew his 'observational prowess.' He bit his lip in consideration, though. "Exactly what would…" he started but stop, remembering who he was speaking to.
Making sure no sarcasm was in his voice, he said, "No, sir. You're right, I was being idiotic. I was not giving my full attention to the potion, which you had warned us several times is highly dangerous. I was putting myself and everyone else at risk. You trusted us to be wise enough to make this responsibly, and I was betraying that. I apologise, and I will do better."
That was the third time since returning to Hogwarts. It was hardly the first time a bloke appeared unbedded into his thoughts while wanking, but unlike those times, he wasn't worried or concerned over what it could mean. He didn't have any room for those emotions because he was too busy being furious that it was
Ron had called him bonkers, Hermione pointedly interrogated why his attitude had suddenly changed, and Neville stared at him in awe. Harry shrugged them off and took pleasure later reaping the rewards of Malfoy's changing behaviour.
himself for sounding very much that he did care, Harry stormed from the loo and right to where he hid the Cloak and map. By the time he was under the Cloak and invisible, Malfoy was pushing through the door, whisper-yelling, "Potter!"
"Mr Potter," she said when they reached her, "the champions and their partners are to wait over here." She then lowered her glasses some and gave him and Luna a sharp look. "Miss Lovegood."
was cast during the night. Those were just side-effects of living with four other blokes. In fact, the first few times a boy would appear in his fantasies, he originally assumed it had to do with that somehow, like an unconscious link between wanking and boys because of his dormmates.
Harry and Ron jumped. They were in Transfigurations, and since they had already finished their work on Cross-Species Switches and therefore bored, they had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George's fake wands. Ron's was now a tin parrot, and Harry's was a rubber haddock. They both instinctively hid their items under the table, looking dutifully up at Professor McGonagall. Harry could feel the head of his haddock fall off and hoped it didn't roll off somewhere in view of McGonagall.
It was much, much better than just him in a towel. The dress robes gave the illusion of his shoulders being broader and his joints not so knobbly and bony. His hair was mostly dry, sticking up every which way because he was an idiot that didn't comb it while wet.
Heads up for Harry's explosive temper. I'm basically running this off the characterisation of how Harry is when under tremendous pressure--which in this he already is but then add in the tension of coming to terms with sexuality and being a disaster-gay. If it doesn't work, just let me know! Happy to edit and change!
," like Harry was truly the vain of his existence, then went inside the toilets again. Harry thought about following, and seeing what Malfoy was going to do, but before he could make up his mind, Malfoy was audibly casting a
He rubbed his forehead, a headache coming back. It was generally a headache first before everything else started up.
"Ooh, excellent." Luna's eyes lit up. "I wonder what stories they will tell, whether from their depictions or the water."
"He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released. I'd bet everything that's why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year—to keep an eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the first place."
"Yeh did it, Harry!" Hagrid boomed over her. Harry felt immediate gratitude and smothering guilt because he had had
Ginny considered him, seeming surprised but also strangely relieved by this. "I… think so. It just depends on… well, how well you handle weird."
Once back in the dorm, Harry stood in front of his mirror, only in a towel himself now, and observed himself. He felt like he spent so much of his time thinking about what and to whom he was attracted, he rarely paused to wonder if others found
He was nagged and pressured by Ron about asking someone to the ball, Ron constantly muttering to himself about them having not done it yet. Harry mostly tried to ignore him, running words over and over and over and over in his head until he felt like it was going to explode. He had a plan, he thought, but he was terrified of it getting screwed up.
Harry felt a bit triumphant at that, and he sensed it was because of their Potions lesson earlier that day. Although Snape was leaving him alone around the rest of the castle, Harry figured that probably wouldn't hold in class, so he went in determined not to rise to the bait and to pay attention.
He was admittedly, and begrudgingly, impressed. Malfoy seemed to be keeping his own hand-written recipe book, the diary Harry had seen him writing in last time, and although he took notes as the rest of the class did, he seemed to combine them all together in the diary along with Merlin knew what else. It did, however, give him plenty of opportunities to copy him. He naturally did a few things wrong, but his potion turned out more acceptable than usual.
Ron opened and closed his mouth. Harry knew an apology was coming, and he wondered briefly if he even needed it. Privately, he thought he didn't. If Ron was willing to pull his head out of his own arse, Harry would gladly welcome him. He would
And now, Malfoy. Harry really didn't like the way Hermione narrowed her eyes at him each time they glimpsed him at Hogsmeade. He was an idiot saying anything. None of it
Malfoy's eyes flicked over Harry's shoulder, back to Harry, but then quickly back over his shoulder where he frowned. "What on earth is she doing?"
for quite some time. It is not common practise in the wizarding world to be so open as I understand some Muggle communities have become. I have been discreet in my inquiries, but you can rest assured that if you so choose to do so, you will have the support of the staff."
"He's not even good-looking!" Hermione muttered angrily one day, making Harry jump so hard, his knee banged the table.
"Oh my…" Malfoy's head dropped, him pinching the bridge of his nose and mumbling to himself. Harry only really caught "... impossible… trying
"I'm so sor—" she stopped herself. "I'm sorry, I suppose I should have realised that… other people might… appreciate the knowledge."
Please note, there is dialogue not just from the book, but also from the game Harry Potter Hogwarts Mystery.
"Earth to scarhead!" barked a whiny voice, and Harry blinked over to finally see who was next to Malfoy. Pansy sodding Parkinson, in yellow dress robes, was hugging Malfoy's arm. Because
He watched Malfoy as he seemed to systematically move around the common room. At one point, it looked like he was going back and forth between Crabbe and Goyle who appeared to be at some tables. Harry thought maybe Malfoy was helping them with homework or something, but the thought sounded so un-Malfoy like, Harry didn't know what to make of it.
"Harry…" Hermione sighed. They were on their way back from Herbology, and Harry's little tumble almost caused her and Ron one as well.
Harry watched, a little pacified to see Malfoy jog down at the end of the corridor calling out for him, then the next. He swore loudly, said, "
Luna Lovegood was a third year in Ravenclaw, and within a single minute of meeting her, Harry had to rearrange his definition of weird.
feeling. For the first time in a long while, Harry really let himself remember that horrible night, and he could feel proud. He stood his ground, and he won.
Malfoy led his Slytherins away, but Harry stared after him. He wasn't disappointed. Malfoy gracefully stepped away from them, letting Parkinson lead, and turned around to walk backwards, watching Harry. Harry was beyond pleased by this and tried to send Malfoy the slow, small nod Malfoy had given him before the task. By this time, Malfoy was rapidly getting too far away for Harry to see if it was returned.
Harry fought his smile and smoothed the note down, adding it to his secret pile that he was keeping.
understand how this could be bad for you. But just now, watching those dragons… Harry, I'm so sorry."
Hermione was silent a long moment, feeling like hours to Harry, before she said carefully, "I don't think there's any one or more gender that people are
Krum came up from behind her, holding two butterbeers. Hermione straightened, physically slamming a bright expression on her face so quickly, Harry wondered if it hurt. "Viktor! There you are!"
"Indeed," Professor McGonagall agreed, physically turning Harry toward the medical tent. "Right then, Potter, the first aid tent,
Finally, this chapter was originally longer, but in an effort to keep my hopes for a Monday chapter, and because I didn't want to weigh it down with every single interaction between our boys, it's been edited. If something seems off, please know why and point it out if you want. I'd love to correct it.
On the way back to Gryffindor Tower, they passed by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle who were on their way to the dungeons, most likely.
Hermione didn't accept 'nothing' as an answer, though, and pestered Harry through the castle grounds. As she did, he chewed his lip and thought. Harry doubted Hermione would support anything to do with Malfoy, but he wondered what her thoughts would be on
Harry swallowed thickly and flicked his bed curtains open a little to see out the window. He scowled at it.
enough to warrant his attention and not him just being unhinged. That if he tried just a little bit, Malfoy would try just a little bit back, and maybe somebody that wasn't an evil-adjacent pompous bastard was underneath. That there was an excuse, some reason, for his cruel words and callous actions. That someone good could be inside that body that looked like it could go for miles… That he could be capable of kind smiles as he leaned over Harry, pressing that kind smile on those pink lips onto his throat—
Professor McGonagall looked as worried and anxious as Hermione. She put a hand on his shoulder and said, "Now, don't panic, just keep a cool head… We've got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand… The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you… Are you all right?"
"We can sit down if you like," Luna said, correctly reading his mind. "Or I can show the other dance if you want."
"Last time it was quieter. I don't know if the thing had just been living down here or was in an enchanted sleep or something, but the last time, it was the predator kind of quiet, y'know? We had no idea where the hell it was. All year, I kept hearing these voices, and it was Hermione who figured out it was a basilisk, and I could hear it because of Parseltongue and everything. She also figured out it was using the pipes. But it kept saying how hungry it was, how long it had been, that it could smell blood and was ready to kill."
Lavender stiffened in her seat, shoving a magazine down in her bag with her foot. "Uh… is it… the smell?"
Harry tried to leave as early as he could, but he was pushing it. It took a while to get down into the Chamber and Merlin knew how long it took to get back up, then he had to meet Hagrid at midnight and Sirius at one. It was too tight, and something was probably going to have to give, especially if he couldn't somehow get Hagrid to finish whatever he wanted early so he could be sure not to miss Sirius.
"I…" he thought for a moment about just saying fine, but he felt so far from fine, he wasn't even sure how to pretend to be.
"I don't even want to go," Harry grumbled, tearing his eyes away and focusing on his book. He needed to make predictions about the hols, and he didn't think it was a long shot to predict his death now over any of the other tasks.
When they reached the enclosure, Hermione and Ron explained the scoring system over each other. Both of them cheered, grabbing onto Harry where they could, as the judges gave their numbers.
"Yes, I can. But only you. I'm not cornering myself in Salazar's secret lair with a bunch of Slytherins."
"Perhaps the Weaslette? Her family probably can't afford the proper robes, but I doubt you would mind, would you, Potter? Chummy with the Weasleys impoverished ascetic."
, it would help somehow. If Malfoy had to concede that Harry might have had a chance just to survive, forget winning, then maybe Harry really did.
change something between them. The whole thing and the prospects that could come from it were annoyingly attractive. Plus, with one o'clock deadline, it guaranteed he couldn't be out long.
He winced a little, thinking of Ron, but the pain he felt over Ron's recent behaviour couldn't dim the
Hufflepuffs were apparently comfortable enough to disrobe in the greenhouses, and while he wasn't Justin Finch-Fletchy's biggest fan, the boy often would roll up his sleeves to work, sometimes even taking off his tie and unbuttoning his collar. He had a prominent collarbone and veiny arms, and really square palms that Harry thought would nicely make up for shorter fingers.
Movement down the path caught his attention, and he looked over to see none other than Malfoy. Only, Malfoy was alone, shoulders slightly hunched and hands in his pockets. Harry turned fully toward him, wanting to take that moment to observe him more, but his own movement seemed to have caught Malfoy's eye.
Malfoy, however, usually got second and third follow-up questions as well. He was doing that this time as well, and Harry leaned over to watch Hermione. Those questions, she had to frown and clearly think about it. She had more of a tell that way, her face frowning before lighting up and raising her hand. He looked back at Malfoy and Snape, and Malfoy didn't appear to have any particular tell, but his voice did come out more slowly and measured.
Draco had never been a very patient person and now wasn't any different. He saddled along the wall, avoiding the other students who were noisily getting packed to leave, and went over to the sink basin. He turned on the cool water, and immediately, his heart picked up in excitement. He ignored it and barely restrained just sticking his head under the flow. Instead, he cupped his hands under it, loving the coolness, then ducked to take a few healthy gulps.
Of course, a paranoid part of his brain supplied, he could have just used Harry to get entrance into the Chamber, but Harry was the one who had offered. Like most things with Malfoy, getting him just to come down there was like pulling teeth.
"It is more impermanent, sir. The Drink of Despair can only be emptied or depleted by drinking it. The Weedosoros can become expired, and once expired, can be safely disposed of."
All the boys were in different states of undress, mostly chatting about the ball and expectations for the night. Dean and Seamus, however, had been having a heated but quiet discussion. They had been fighting the last few days, which was unusual for them.
And it was a bark, Harry knew now. It was artistic in its own way, haughty and posh, yet musical and free. It took hearing it a couple of times to know why it reminded him of Sirius because the sound was so different, but it was most definitely a bark of laughter.
Harry thought it was safer if he didn't look, but something bitter twisted in him, and he had to. Sure enough, on Parkinson's thin, pointy wrist was a dark red corsage, and another was sitting neatly on Malfoy's chest.
"I already told you not to judge a Slytherin by public appearance. But alas, I should have known better than expect
Another commenter, Elaine_ORoake, said something about the last chapter that has me in fucking stitches!!!
Malfoy nodded. Harry wasn't sure, trying to focus on the conversation and not Malfoy's face, but he thought maybe they had stepped even closer. Either way, Malfoy was close enough for Harry to see in stark detail as one snowflake too many landed on a front strand of Malfoy's hair, causing it to fall across one grey—silver in this light—eye.
"It is tradition. You are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school," she said firmly, tone booking no argument. "However, I took the liberty of checking the rules, and nothing specifies a requirement for the partners."
The silence between them seemed to stretch so much, it almost felt like that invisible bubble around his head was expanding again. Sounds echoed in the Chamber as Malfoy shifted on his feet once more.
Because Malfoy's hair wasn't sleeked back. It was still styled, but now it looked amazingly soft. It was parted at one side, his locks curling into a small wave where it sat by his ear. He looked like he had more hair on top, as though the sides were a closer cut. It was terrible, it really was, because Harry could immediately picture how easily a strand could fall into Malfoy's eyes, making him look far softer and easier than the boy—man, there didn't seem to be a spec of boy left in his face— his face which had those grey eyes, arched eyebrows, high cheekbones… and, as Harry's vision took in the picture as a whole, a very angry-looking scowl on it.
"Right—these dragons," Sirius said quickly. "There's a way, Harry. Don't be tempted to try a Stunning Spell—dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon—"
The hospital wing was empty when he entered. He honestly didn't have much experience in the hospital wing. The longest he spent there was the year previous when that nasty creature sliced at his arm. He milked that for all it was worth, and he found the hospital wing reasonably comfortable. Not so much when the matron was there, but without her, comfortable enough to be getting on with.
Everything else in his life seemed to be improving as well. It was such a relief to have Ron back and for the school at large to be less hostile toward him. Harry guessed the latter had to do with Cedric Diggory, whom Harry suspected had told the Hufflepuffs to lay off in return for Harry's tip about the dragons. There were even less
Malfoy crossed his arms, seeming honestly insulted. "How else do you think Vi—Crabbe and Goyle have passed all these years."
Malfoy snorted over another muted squishing sound. "Do you honestly think even the Ministry would allow for any regulations of
She hadn't done anything about his confession yet, and she had plenty of time to. However, he couldn't curve the brand-new panic pinging around in him. He wasn't
Malfoy somehow had slipped a note into Harry's Charms textbook, and when they met up again to go into the Chamber, they were back to a tentative normal. Harry had asked him if new creatures really were under private review, and Malfoy had scoffed and called him an idiot. It wasn't a direct answer, but Harry felt better about the whole thing. From there, they restricted any conversation to only the basilisk and the Chamber.
Harry, still grinning, looked back at the snake. He imagined it being real, took a breath, then said, "
"Find out how they feel about those with different preferences and start from there, Mr Potter." She sighed again. "I gather from this that I should not be expecting to have a meeting with the staff to ensure tolerance at the ball?"
Pansy had seemed like a safe option, before. He wasn't going to take anyone to the Ball, especially after he heard Potter hadn't gotten a date. He figured if Potter was good enough to go stag, so was Draco. Then at the last minute, he heard Potter had asked that Indian twin, so it was more or less a last-minute decision on Draco's part.
Harry winced when Hermione tried to get Winky to see that freedom was a good thing, and it went over about as well as he expected. He was, however, surprised to hear that Mr Crouch apparently bad-mouthed Mr Bagman enough at home for Winky to classify him as a bad wizard. He also felt a sinking feeling of dread at Dobby's proclamation of the Malfoys being
dipped his quill in his ink and made some lines, connecting his symptoms that were more commonly related to each other. He frowned at it. The only ones that made sense were the ones suggesting he had a cold, flu, or something else mundane. Something Pepper-Up would solve. It left out the worst of them.
" The last he said in Parseltongue, and the sink obediently began closing. "Fine. Go on believing I'm the world's biggest tosser who actually
Malfoy rolled his eyes and turned back around. He was flipping through another book now, and Harry scooted a little closer to see it was their Charms textbook.
Madam Pomfrey was in fine form, seemingly bickering with nobody and everybody about her students facing dragons. Cedric didn't seem too badly injured, however, and Harry watched with mild fascination as Madam Pomfrey cleaned and healed his shoulder. She instructed him to sit, but he couldn't.
"We know he's a good actor because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn't he? Now, I've been keeping an eye on the
It took a moment for the words to process in Harry's brain, but when they did, he sat up straight. "Illegal?"
Draco rushed out of the library, only slowing when he was in the corridor, knowing Vinny and Greg would catch up eventually.
He cracked his neck again, feeling more uncomfortable. Scratchings of quills were starting to grate his nerves. His arms were itchy, and his toes were sore for some reason—not actually the muscles, maybe his nails? He blinked a few more times, willing the blurriness from his eyes, willing himself to read. Some people were whispering, and why did some people have to turn pages so loudly?
He turned, hurrying down the hall. Harry, and he still wasn't sure why he was bothering, chased after him, skidding in front of him to stop from going. "I'm not having you on. I promise. It is in there."
"I am sorry," Harry mumbled, throwing the Cloak over himself quickly. He barely covered himself before Malfoy was pausing, turning around with his mouth open and obviously about to say something. Harry froze, but so did Malfoy, looking around.
Harry made a face. He was curious but decided if he was still curious later, he would ask. For now, however: "Well… sorry I didn't think about the smell, but welcome to the Chamber of Secrets."
Malfoy shrugged, suddenly like he didn't care. "Fine. Don't know what else I was expecting. I suppose you want to try again next weekend?"
Harry conceded that with a tilt of his head. Dumbledore never asked to see the Chamber or to do anything with it, but that didn't mean he would agree with students making several trips down into it in the middle of the night. "What do we do then?"
He actively ignored the exciting flutters in his stomach when once returned to Gryffindor Tower, he told Hermione he was going to call it an early night, grabbed his Marauder's Map and Cloak, and carefully snuck back out as the prefects were hoarding in the last of the straggling Gryffindors.
Malfoy wore dark dress robes that were open at the top to reveal a lighter waistcoat and a deep coloured bowtie, and just how fit Malfoy was. The waistcoat hugged him like it was basking being able to wrap around his flat chest and run down his smooth stomach. The robes buckled at the hips, spotlighting his narrow frame. He somehow looked
badges that glowed slightly on some tables. The Creeveys had been trying to change them but have only been able to make them say
"As bad?" Ron grinned. "Yeah. Harry really showed them, with the dragon and all." Ron had been laying Harry's victory on thick whenever he could; Harry figured he was still making up for their fight.
Some of the Beauxbatons boys wore their thin uniforms tighter than probably necessary, and they all seemed to sit so gracefully, even when they were shifting in their seats being rowdy during meals.
Harry was freezing, so he made a beeline to the showers. He decided to at least try to make an effort and borrow some scented soap from one of the older boys also in there. The boy in question was in just a towel, fresh from a shower himself, and had to bend over to dig in his shower caddy. Harry allowed himself to watch and when the boy handed the soap over, asked to borrow his scented shampoo as well, sending the boy bending over again.
Also, a headcanon I see often is applied here, which is Hagrid's blast-ended skrewts weren't exactly legal.
Harry gulped and shoved his own hands in his pockets. Malfoy paused briefly at that but continued, probably because Harry wasn't drawing a wand.
They went, and Harry wrote a long letter to Sirius detailing almost everything about the first task. Ron let him borrow Pigwidgeon; meanwhile, Harry updated Ron on everything Sirius warned him about Karkaroff. They then went back to Gryffindor tower where a celebration of Harry's victory was well underway. Lee tempted Harry into opening the golden egg which was empty but emitted a loud, shrieking sound that had everyone covering their ears.
Hermione rolled her eyes in an answer that told him he should have figured this revelation out a long time ago. She had known about him since they learned about veela, and Harry should have known about himself. In so many ways, he did, but he was simply terrified of it.
Hermione wouldn't let him skip another day, however, so he endured two more days of the torture that was Hogwarts student gangs and the rumour mill. He was shoved in the hallways, openly laughed at, and stupid Malfoy's badges seemed to have gotten around the entire school. Everywhere he went, people were laughing at him, pointing at him, loudly predicting his death, and he could have dealt with it, clenched his teeth and let it go, but with everyone, he couldn't help but wonder if they, too, thought he was a lying fake who really did just want the attention.
They picked a path and began walking down it, comfortably silent. They didn't get far before they hear a familiar voice, and Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Karkaroff was obviously concerned about something, and Snape looked as ill-tempered as ever, blasting bushes to catch snogging students.
"Huh?" Harry asked, turning back to his friends. Ron looked furious, and Hermione was darting eyes among Harry, Ron, and the Slytherins. Harry turned again to follow her gaze only to see Malfoy turning his own head again back to them. Harry fought a blush.
"Harry—we've just got to grit our teeth and do it. When we get back to the common room tonight, we'll both have partners—agreed?"
"Shut up, you little shite. Listen, we have enough time to drop off your stuff so you aren't stuck with it, but then I have to go."
"Yes," and, "Sure," were their clipped answers. Harry and Ron exchanged a shrug and returned to what they were doing.
"Of course you are," Malfoy sneered. "You're a hopeless, pathetic, absolute moron, and I will be genuinely surprised if you survive Tuesday."
The humiliation alone was enough to make him wish the dragon had finished him off. Professor McGonagall didn't seem like the type of person to tolerate the likes of something like
Harry pressed his lips together to keep in an incredulous laugh. If he didn't know any better, Malfoy was also trying not to laugh. Harry's own voice was a little shaky with how tight he was trying to make it. "Well… when you put it like that…"
What was their relationship? Trying to think through an unbiased lens, Harry had to admit that Malfoy always was very respectful to Snape, more so than he had seen him be to other professors besides Flitwick and Sprout. Moreover, Malfoy always clearly worked harder to please Snape, the only person Harry could really think of seeing Malfoy
“We were surprised but not really. I mean the two of you were obsessed with each other for years” Hermione said sadly. Ron nodded in agreement
“ I smell treacle tart, broom polish, wood, and….. a potion” Draco smelt Harry simple as that, but with the added potion smell he usually smelt from Blake. He also smelly Blake too he was utterly confused at this point.
“This is my hospital wing Ill remind you Severus, you will move aside and let me care for this student this instant”
“Dray, come on you need to wake up. There’s things that need to be discussed” Blaise said sternly. The blond shifted and mumbled a little his brows pulling together. Finally one eye opened up to see his best friend and he sighed.
They were both quiet for a while both staring at the wall Infront of them. Draco was trying to gather his thoughts, how he wanted to say everything. At the same time he didn’t want to say anything at all.
Draco locked eyes with his godfather and bared his teeth. Snape sneered and didn’t back down, bringing out his wand and aiming it right at Dracos chest. They continued this match of wills for some minuets before Draco looked away and sat back against the headboard of the bed and looked around the room. Blaise sat in a chair next to Dracos bed, Severus was at the foot of his bed towering over him still with that same sneer. McGonagall was no where to be seen which meant she left or was with the boy in the other room.
“Well my apologies Mr. Viper I was wanting to insure I looked my best so you had something nice to stare at all day” Blakes eyes widened dramatically and his face went three shades redder in surprise and honestly Draco was just as surprised buy the words that had left his mouth also.
Draco folded up his letter placed it in the envelope and sealed it with his crest. He stood up and made his way out of his room and met Blaise in the common room giving a half hearted smirk. Blaise took the letter from the blond and patted him on the back.
“Its not really his HEALTH” Blaise started but quickly shut his mouth with a pained look. “I cant say more but I can say his health is very good”
“Draco….” She gently placed her hand on her son’s cheek turning his face to look down to her. Her eyes glistened as she saw the broken soul that stared back at her. “ Draco please take care of yourself and….. please promise if it becomes too much you will at least go to Serverus” he nodded slowly and kissed his mother on the cheek before he turned around and boarded the train. Shortly after he stepped onto the train two individuals stepped up beside Narcissa. “ Please keep an eye on him and if anything happens inform me. I know he won’t” she sighed “ And please help him make at least one new friend”
“Blake just come out and help it’ll go faster. There’s no need to be embarrassed over something so small” Draco yelled to the boy. He heard shuffling then a quiet ‘No’. Draco spun around thinking about going over and busting the door open but then stopped himself and took a breath. He didn’t need to start issues already, Blake said no so leave it, he told himself again. Blaise watched Draco war with himself but smiled when he saw the boy back down.
They met not far from the Astronomy Tower where Luna was having a lively discussion with a portrait of dancing quills. She had long, blonde hair and large, round blue eyes. She was a whole head shorter than him and had a dreamy sort of voice when she greeted him.
Harry didn't care about his score. Both of their indignations on his behalf on Karkaroff's low score was worth the entire tournament to him. And despite himself, he couldn't help noticing that it wasn't just his friends—it wasn't just his five people—nor was it just Gryffindors or even just
Madam Pomfrey's hands were on her hips immediately. "You can and you will if you want me to fix your problem."
The usual hatred and anger boiled in Harry's belly, making him clench his fist. Some of the Slytherins were openly sniggering at him.
A large portion of the obviously rotten flesh across the basilisk's belly vanished. Harry blinked, begrudgingly impressed. They had been working on the Summoning Charm all week, and Harry still couldn't even get the wand movements right. Harry was honestly just poking at a clear sour spot for the boy, but perhaps it was a bigger button than he realised.
Harry didn't notice Hermione first mostly because of the lack of bushy hair. Instead, her hair was straight and in an elegant style. Her dress robes were also elegant, a light blue, and she was blushing fiercely but looked pleased.
"Looks like a really good plan from where I'm sitting." Harry grinned bleakly. "They'll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff."
Harry didn't know what was safe to say or not, so he decided to risk being right about what the shifting of Malfoy's feet earlier meant. "You tell me about yours, I'll tell you about mine."
"Because first of all, that would be mean and cruel of you to lead someone on who doesn't actually have a chance with you. Secondly, you would be miserable all night, pretending to be interested. Thirdly, she would be miserable because she would be able to tell, you aren't that good of an actor, Harry," she added to his scowl. "And lastly, it would take the stress off the entire situation if you brought someone who understood you are just going as friends. You could end up having a good time."
Harry clenched his jaw. He was joking earlier about giving Krum the shovel talk, but if he really did do something to Hermione…
' is just a setting on Muggle laundry contraptions. I'm aware that it is your relatives' ambition to be '
The next morning, Harry woke up already horrified because his body, apparently, had decided to get revenge for the wank-ban and give him a wet dream about
A lot of those could be ruled out, though. He wasn't bitten by anything, he knew. He hadn't swapped fluids with anyone, blood or otherwise being a virgin. He could have been cursed, but how? Why? When?
Harry's mouth was dry. He never pictured Malfoy as a small talk kind of person, but it felt like so much progress between them, he was desperate to keep it going. "Two of them are non-binary."
Sirius hesitated. "I've been hearing some very strange things… The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn't they? Someone set off the Dark Mark… and then—did you hear about the Ministry of Magic witch who's gone missing?"
"Oh," Luna gasped, realisation dawning clear on her face. "Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot about homophobia."
This is a double chapter update, so please lookout for the next. After these babies are up, I'll circle back to comments!
"What?!" he squeaked, then cleared his throat, lowering his voice as pure panic spread throughout him. "What? What—no—no, I didn't—I don't—I don't think of—I'm not, I'm not like—I—"
What Harry thought was the second scenario was Malfoy showing up, but after being told the entrance was in the girls' toilet, not believe Harry, hex him to an inch of his life, and then tell the
When Malfoy returned his gaze, his nasty smirk faltered slightly, and Harry hurriedly looked away, not at all confident his face wasn't showing every inch of how badly it stung.
It was pathetic and stupid about how he couldn't say that without smiling. He could refuse Malfoy, but he knew he wouldn't.
Ron, who apparently already knew this, came back with the rest, and they began chopping, mincing, smushing, and dicing and trying not to mix up their each mortars and pestles.
Cautiously, Harry looked back at her. She looked just as stringent as ever, but her eyes shone with understanding. Harry suddenly felt her words from the day before, that unspoken challenge to be brave enough to explore his own identity.
The eyebrow got higher. "Majs, in America. That's their terms, I think." His expression turned thoughtful. "Muggles and no-majs use non-binary, I think. If I'm not mistaken, it's a relatively new term in the community."
Also: the reason why there are drops of nicotine in the potion here (of which there are no known ingredients) is because nicotine is something that opens and encourages cognitive thinking. Let's take for an example, most everyone knows nicotine to be in cigarettes and other tobacco products. When stressed, people addicted to nicotine will crave more of it because stress limits cognitive thinking. For a further example, thinking BBC's Sherlock and "three-patch problem"-when faced with a problem Sherlock cannot automatically deduce, he relies on nicotine to encourage his cognitive thinking. The reason why I made it an ingredient is that the Drink of Despair (potion Dumbly drinks in book 6 in the cave) induces fear, etc, so imagine how more powerful that is when your cognitive abilities are put on the extreme.
"Your hands," she smiled at him, reaching for his hand again. He watched as she smoothed her palm across the back of his. It was indeed dry. His head pounded.
Nicholas Malfoy stared in horror at his informant for a full minute before, quick as a blink, he flicked his wand and killed her—in sheer utter incredulity to the information.
Harry huffed but had no rebuttal because, as he peeked up to watch Malfoy lean over to tie up his special boots, Harry didn't doubt it.
It took some wiggling, but Harry was able to make it through. Though Malfoy was taller, he was also narrower in frame, so it didn't take nearly as much wiggling. Harry still offered Malfoy a hand and told himself he wasn't disappointed when Malfoy scoffed at it.
"Why can't we have a list of things this transfiguration will work on, and learn it the old way?" Vinny asked.
"'Well, yeah', he says," Malfoy mocked. "Listen, Potter, if nothing else I can accept that you have a lot going on right now, and therefore, might be even stupider than what I usually give you credit for—which I imagine is no easy accomplishment, so congratulations there."
“You best think about what your going to do next Ron. Or you might find yourself In the hospital wing.” Harry warned.
Blake slid onto the bed and up to the headboard. He settled in next to Draco with his shoulder touching the blonds. Draco took Blakes hand in his and squeezed, Blake jumped a little surprised by this. Out of all the time they spent together Draco had never hugged or took his hand first.
The doors swung open and Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Blake walked in. Dracos heart clenched when his eyes met Blakes. Blake sent a small smile then frowned when he saw the uneaten bagel on Dracos plate. He then glared at Blaise hard, said boy groaned.
Harry lounged back and did a once over of the room looking for the blond again. He should have just left but there was still that possibility he would show up. Or he might be occupied with something or someone else. That thought made Harry sneer he didn’t want to think about Draco with someone else. It was bad enough watching Pansy chase after him let alone see or think of the boy willingly being with someone else. He had always wanted Draco he knew now, back then he thought it was because he had hated the boy for always tormenting him, but he knew he did whatever he could to get the boy to torment him. As he continued with these thoughts, he fell asleep in the oversized chair.
After an hour or so Draco had an idea. He pulled out a piece of parchment and wrote on it then flicked his wrist towards Blake. It never made it to the boy because Blaise caught it and read it. He shot Draco a pointed look then wrote a reply and slid it back to Draco.
Afternoon found the four friends under a tree near the Lake, it was warm but the chilled wind coming off the lake took away any uncomfortableness. Blake and Draco had their backs to the tree, Pansy and Blaise sat in front of them. They were currently catching Blake up on Blaises obsession, I mean crush, on one Ronald Weasley.
Draco felt a hot rage go through him who would do such a thing. He wanted to find his family and rip them apart, but he reigned in his anger. He shouldn’t feel this angry.
“ Well I guess the most obvious question to start with is why Im here now.” All eyes were on him, he flushed and resumed staring at the feet in his lap. “ Well I lost my parents in the first war and was sent to live with family. They kept me hidden most of my life and then was decided it was best I be home schooled until it was safer. So I was locked away up until Voldemort was finally defeated” at the mention of his name all three flinched but it went un noticed by Blake.
“I think Ill listen to Blaise on this one Harry” she said. Harry started back astonished he was not mad but at the same time he didn’t want to deal with all the questions that were bound to come out.
“That’s for making us deal with a pissy ass Draco because he didn’t know where you where” Blaise said while flopping down in the armchair but there was another look in his eyes. Like the looks you gave when someone almost told a Gryffindor the password.
“ Pans give him time to comprehend and answer before you go to the next question” Blaise said as he stretched out and threw his feet in Blakes lap. Blake gave the leather covered feet a glare and pushed them out of his lap.
“Well I guess we have a start to a plan, I distract Hermione, and You Ron. What you say Blaise?” pansy asked flipping her hair over her shoulder.
Draco sat straight up in bed gasping, what had that dream been about. He oddly felt calm even though the dream was very confusing to him. He snapped his head to his right side when he felt movement. The previous night came back to him, the realization and acceptance he had had with his feelings of Blake. He smiled and laid back down next to the boy and placed his hand on his cheek but jerked it back when he felt the heat coming from the boy. Draco sat up quickly and started looking the boy over, he was to pale and shivering. He shook his shoulder to try and wake him up and frowned when the teen did not budge.
“Look there’s other houses already here and everything’s fine. Lets go get a drink and enjoy ourselves” she yelled over the loud music and lead them over to the table to get a drink. They each decided to take a shot of fire whisky before each of them took a glass of wine for themselves and began to make their way around the room. After a while they came across Seamus and Dean and chatted with them awhile. Harry was distracted and didn’t pay much attention. He was to busy looking for the prince himself but had not seen nothing of him. When he glanced at Hermione he could tell she was doing the same thing but looking for dark skinned Italian.
“Then I forgive you and you have my trust again, so lets start again” He lifted his chin to rest on Dracos chest with a full blown smile, but it faltered.
Draco smirked at having caught the teen laying on his side facing him staring at him as he got into bed. Even in the darkness Draco could see the dark red blush staining the Gryffindors cheeks. He smiled to himself, a little teasing never hurt anything did it, he thought to himself. Draco laid on his side facing Harry but scooted closer until he was only a breath away.
Draco looked down at the parchment and thought about the offer. He did have a lot of questions for the boy but the problem was how much was he himself willing to share. After thinking on it for a few minuets he wrote back.
Harry blinked a few times taking in the information and smiled to himself. He tried to look up but could not with how tightly Draco was holding on to him. He kept wiggling trying to get a little room to look at the blond properly but Draco wasn’t having it.
Harry placed his hands on her hips and they began to sway back and forth to the beat of the music both laughing over the fact they obviously had no business being on the dance floor but alcohol made them brave. He doesn’t know how long they spent there but they were enjoying themselves. They swayed to the rhythm, and would spin each other around every so often and laugh. Neither of them noticed the set of brown eyes that stayed trained on them the whole time. Harry felt a tap on his shoulder and stopped mid spin to look over his shoulder. He was met with Blaises smirking face, Harry lifted a questioning eyebrow at him.
“Well looks like our plan just fell in our lap” Blake said with a laugh. The three others just staring at him as they made their way over to a far table and started pulling there work out. Blake looked at the confused teens then laughed again.
Draco let his mind wonder as they climbed the stairs. He really didn’t want to be alone in his room he knew the only thing that would happen would be him crying as he had every night for ages now. But if it came down to it he could always wonder the corridors, it would give him something to do. As they were nearing the top floor where their rooms would be Draco heard a started cry and looked up in time to see Blake falling backwards towards him. On instinct the blond opened his arms and caught the boy, his back falling against Dracos front, his arm wrapped around the smaller boys waist trying to steady himself and Blake so they both didn’t tumble any further.
Rons face had contorted in anger and he was now getting to his feet. He still had more height on him than Hermione and Harry and towered over both of them. He reached out and grabbed the girl by her elbow and turned forcing her to follow him. At that Harry grabbed his shoulder and spun him back around and forced him away from her.
Before Draco could step forward and cause any issues Blaise stepped in front of him shooting a warning through his eyes at the blond. He then turned around and held his hand out to Harry and Hermione.
‘I wish mother was here. She’s always able to figure things out’ at that he sat bolt up right and jumped out of his bed to his desk and grabbed parchment and a quill. He had completely forgotten to write her. He’s lucky he hadn’t gotten a howler yet. He set to writing to her hastily running over the past few days.
“I haven’t had the chance, but I will write her tonight or tomorrow” he promised not meeting his eyes . He felt a hand on his shoulder and leaned into it.
“I dont have a death wish” with that he stood up and held out his hand to Draco to help him up. The blond took it and Blake pulled him up with ease.
“You better have a good explanation” she said coldly her brown eyes staring into Blakes. Blaise didn’t say anything, but his look was actually a more threatening. Blake looked at them and his eyes dropped to the table.
Draco stared at his friend and schooled his face into his normal mask then smirked. Blaise was right he could figure this out this isn’t the first time he had been denied his favorite toy, and he always got what he wanted, this time he had back up.
‘Well’ the Italian mouthed to him. The blond sighed and stepped forward pulling at the cufflink of his sleeve.
Draco leaned more heavily against Blakes shoulder still staring at the wall. He let the words sink in and realized both his mother and Blake were right. But he was scared he was hurt and he didn’t want to be hurt again he couldn’t take his heart being ripped out again. He sighed when he felt a hand run through his hair and massage his scalp. This felt right, sitting here in the silence with Blake, it felt like home.
At that Draco leapt up and took the book. Now that he was holding it he could tell it wasn’t a book but a journal. It was made out of black leather and had a silver crest he had never seen before. It looked like a snake wrapped around a lion, but it seemed like there were two letters woven into it. Looking closer he could tell the letters were a ‘B’ and a ‘P’. It was obviously a family crest, but he had never seen it before. The pages looked like they were lined in silver also the way they glinted when he moved the book around. He opened it and nothing was in it, it was completely empty. He looked back up at Blaise in confusion. Blaise was still smirking at the blond but shrugged his shoulders.
“Live Draco, be happy, and if whatever this boy is to you makes you happy, then go for it be open hang out, be friends, but be happy. You owe yourself and Harry that” with that she took his arm in hers again and they made their way to the Great Hall for dinner.
“As I said Im a veela I found my mate, literally as he was going to fight a damn mad man. I only ever got to hold him once and kiss him once. Then he pushed me away and ran, after that he sacrificed himself for all of the wizarding world. He left me alone, I should have died. Veelas are supposed to die when their mate does, but I guess my punishment for the crimes committed by me and my family was to continue on and live and bear the pain and agony of living without him” by this time tears were falling from Dracos eyes and he just let them fall as he stared at the curtain at the end of the bed. He felt Blake shift and then found himself with the boy almost in his lap and his head on his chest as he embraced him.
Blake whipped his head around to the boy and placed both hands on his side and pushed him off the end of the bench glaring at the boy.
“I have to write to our Father about this situation that has happened. While I’m at it I’m going to go ahead and write to him about your all’s relationship, go ahead and get the ball rolling with that” he said with a smirk. Blaise face darkened and he started sputtering and Hermione shot him a glare, but no heat was behind it. Harry just laughed Sirius was going to get a kick out of all this. Eventually Blaise calmed down and smiled back at Harry gratefully, knowing he had Harrys support for what he was about to go through for his sister.
“We just walked almost two miles I think we’ve had enough ‘outside time’ Pansy” Blaise replied with a lazy tone.
The smaller boy looked like he was arguing with himself but after a few minuets pulled back the cover and slipped in turning on his side to face Draco. The two gazed into each others eyes for a while, Blake brought his hand back up and started petting Dracos hair again. Draco closed his eyes and smiled, yes this was right, this is where he wanted to be.
“You are so confident in all you do, but here comes a red head and you turn into a whimpering Hufflepuff, and I swear to god Blaise you hex me and ill break your fingers to the point it will take skellagrow all night to fix you” Draco said seriously at the end giving the Italian a pointed look. The olive skinned boy returned the look full force but didn’t send a hex his way.
His head snapped up when he felt a hand on his leg. Squatting before him was the smaller teen, his chestnut brown hair disheveled, his chest heaving in and out, and his eyes sparkling with sorrow. Those eyes soothed his soul and his heart automatically felt like it had stopped ripping itself apart. Draco angerly threw his head forward to his knees again, letting out a frustrated growl. None of this made sense and he wasn’t understanding. He couldn’t figure it out and it made his head spin.
“Well its your bed and I’m just crashing here” he said like it was the most obvious thing ever. Draco rolled his eyes at the raven and pulled him to the bed.
Draco walked up to the other teen and smirked. Blaise knew things just got interesting, because in pure blood society it was eye for an eye, and Ronald Weasley hurt someone Draco considered close to him. So someone close to him was going to be hurt as well.
Draco jerked awake and stared at his canopy above his bead chest heaving. He hadn’t had a dream about Harry that detailed before. It was usually always just vague memories that all ran together, from their quidditch games, to their fights in the hallways. But never a full-blown conversation make out session. As he thought of the dream kiss his heart dropped and ached. It had been so real to him, he truly wished he could have stayed there. Then he was brought back to the end, the part that had caused him to wake up. Blake Viper. His eyes, his hair, his lips, all felt just as real as Harrys. He was bothered, Blake was in his dream and kissing him but also, he felt, Happiness? At the promise, the boy made to him in his dream just like Harry had.
“Shhhh I cant answer that but you have to be strong, you are strong. Go on living you have to, you still have people here who care for you and will be there for you”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy as long as I’ve known you I would have figured you were smarter than this. Really threatening teachers and almost getting expelled!” the bushy haired banshee screeched.
“I had to come back Filch was right outside he almost caught me” Harry slurred. Draco quickly shut the exit and stepped back into the room.
Blaise and Draco were standing off to the side watching the scene unfolding in front of them. After everything that had happened the three had been scarce in the public and hid themselves from the media very well. So needless to say they were surprised with the events in front of them. But that didn’t mean they weren’t prepared for a fight if it came down to it. Blaise stepped forward with a mischievous glint in his eye and placed his hand on the small of Hemiones back.
Dinner was uneventful, well besides Draco looking for Blake. Blaise said they had gone back to their room for awhile and talked, which he didn’t answer any of their questions about what they talked about, then Blake had said he needed to go speak to Snape. Snape was at the teachers table for dinner so why wasn’t Blake sitting with them. Draco kept glancing towards the door all through dinner, which didn’t go unnoticed by his two friends. During this time Draco started wandering back into that dark hazy state of mind and he didn’t like it. He hardly ate anything and when Pansy and Blaise finished they pulled Draco along with them to the common room hoping to distract him for a little while.
“I’m afraid he tends to get a little jealous over things he considers his” he finished sharing a knowing look with the brown haired girl.
“I’m not Potter I’m Black, if your going to use my last name use it right” the raven laughed. Draco just stared at him for a few minutes.
“I only ever came into your room when you, Harry, and I had something to discuss. Same reason you ever came into my room. Don’t you dare act like we have ever had any other things going on in a manner such as that” the girl yelled back.
Blake relaxed as Draco started to rub his back up and down. They stayed like that for a long time not saying a word just enjoying the moment. Nothing ended up being said because both boys fell asleep, holding on to each other.
“ Well I smell vanilla, apples, and……. Spring.” The boy said and looked at the others, they all looked confused besides Blaise who was trying to hold in laughter.
I’m going to be honest, its been a really long time since I’ve been able to write anything. It’s also probably been even longer since I’ve read the books. I’m writing this to get back into a hobby I use to enjoy and get my bearings about me again. Not only that writing is fun and I’m wanting to have fun with this. Please bear with me if things are off or not completely right. I do plan on this being smutty and for the mature. There is a possibility that there will be characters that are alive that actually died and so on and so forth it really depends on where my mind takes all of this. Please feel free to provide ideas if you have any or constructive criticism. Please no flaming, being rude, or mean just because your bored or for whatever reason. As I said before this is for fun, I want you all to have fun reading it and I want to have just as much fun writing it. I own nothing it belongs to J.K Rowling.
They all looked around at each other wondering who would go first. None volunteering to give up what they smelled for fear one of the others figuring it out. Finally, Blake stepped forward and leaned in taking a huge breath in of the steam. He closed his eyes and a smile spread across his face then he opened his eyes and stepped back.
“I don’t believe you own her Weasel” Blaises eyes were burning brightly waiting for a fight. Draco now stood taller behind his friend his hand in his pocket obviously waiting for Ron to make a move.
The room was silent for a while everyone taking in the situation. Obviously the noble Lions had staked their claim on the four Slytherins and now considered them theirs. Which none of them were used to the only ones they ever trusted were each other the rest of their house was cut throat. It was a lot to take in and they would take longer to adjust to it and learn to trust them, but at this point Draco would do what ever he could and take whatever help he could to keep Blake.
Draco was shocked when Ron plopped himself down across from Draco and Blaise and started piling his plate full of whatever he could reach. The red head looked up with a piece of toast hanging out of his mouth.
He didn’t make it far because two strong arms wrapped around him and pulled him to a pale chest. One was wrapped around his waist and the other was holding the back of his head pressing his face into Dracos chest. Harry stiffened not knowing what to do. Draco started rubbing the others back hoping to sooth him.
“You like to see me blush” he repeated and gave Draco an accusing look. The blonde sighed and hid his face in the soft raven locks.
The two quickly made their way to the hospital wing luckily not running into anyone. Snape burst through the door and looked around and saw Draco and Pomfrey leaning over the bed. Hopefully, they had gotten there in time before the two had found anything out. Snape briskly walked to the bed and pushed the nurse away.
Harrys face lit up red and started coughing while he ran a hand through his wild locks. He had taken up that action once Sirius had taken Harry into town to get his vision corrected. That was not the only thing that had changed during that trip. Sirius had made it very clear no God Son and heir of his was going to be and I quote ‘A nerd’. So thus, the epic shopping spree of the decade had taken place. Harry came back with his vison corrected, a new hair style, and a whole new wardrobe. Harrys hair was now a new style cut that was cut close on the side and longer on the top. It was now manageable with the way Harry styled it in an intentional messy sweeping motion. His green eyes shown more brightly now with out the glasses. His wardrobe was now more up to date on the new styles in both muggle and wizarding cloths. All in all, she could say Harry was drop dead gorgeous, and unfortunately very gay, well only gay for Draco Malfoy she should say. She let out a giggle but stopped herself when she saw Harry glaring at her.
“I promise to try and live Harry” with that he smiled and took my cheek in his hand and leaned forward. His lips mere centimeters away from mine.
Draco was beyond confused and lost at this point. This was the second time he had felt this, this spark from the teen next to him and he didnt not like it but at the same time it terrified him. Could he have been wrong about Harry? No there is no way he was wrong, Harry was his mate he knows that with all his heart. But what was ‘This’ that was going on, that he was feeling towards Blake. There’s no way the smaller teen was his mate you only had one mate your whole life, right? Draco glanced over at that time to observe the boy.
Blake frowned and grasped Dracos hand in his and looked at him with sad eyes. He then stood up and removed his black and green robe and tossed it on top of his trunk, then leaned forward and bent slightly to unbutton the buttons on Dracos and started to push it down then pulled it off tossing it to land on top of his. Blake then climbed up the bed and leaned against the headboard, he beckoned to Draco to join him. Draco was hesitant but slipped his leather dress shoes off and slid up beside Blake leaning against the headboard too. The smaller boy took Dracos hand in his and they sat silently for awhile before Blake spoke up.
Draco was the first down to the common room and sat down to wait for the others to show up. He leaned back and closed his eyes letting his mind wonder. He actually felt pretty good his mind wasnt as groggy as it usually was, his body felt rested, and he didn’t have a head ache. His physical appearance looked better some too. His eyes were not sunk in, and his cloths and hair were not as disheveled as they had been for a while, thanks to actually getting some rest and having the energy to put forth the effort. Not only that somewhere in the back of his mind he wanted to look the best he could. He told himself it was because he didn’t want his friends (more specifically Blake) to worry about him anymore, but there was that small instinct to preen and look good for someone else. He kept telling himself that wasn’t the case, but his little veela inside him wouldn’t listen at all. He sat up and stood once he heard foot steps coming down the stairs of the dorms. And there stood Blake and Blaise glaring at him, what the hell had he done, he wasn’t even around them for the past thirty minutes.
All that was heard was three different people screaming stunning spells and then Draco fell to the floor knocked unconscious.
Draco slumped against his friend and hugged back fiercely. He could not believe this was happening, he lost Harry, and now Blake was being ripped away. It was like every time happiness was in his reach the fates ripped it away from him. He had just gotten a taste and shown there was a possibility to be with Blake and now nothing. He was truly being punished for his crimes he was sure of it now.
“Oh hold up! You don’t get to come out here demanding us to hurry up when you just spent twenty minuets getting ready” Draco spun around surprised by where that comment came from. It wasn’t from his two long time friends but from Blake the boy that seemed to have a staring problem. Draco raised an elegant eyebrow at him and smirked.
“I’m going to leave you all alone for now I need to go check on Draco, see where he disappeared to last night” Blaise sounded irritated as he said those last words. With a kiss to Hermione’s hand he left swiftly. The two sat in silence for awhile before Harry spoke up.
“No one will see it Ill have Hermione heal it” Harry said walking over to the girl and as she raised her wand Blaise gripped her wrist lightly.
“Did we or did we not say we were Friends Pansy?” she screeched again. “That means when there’s major issues that effects our friends lives we need to all work together to fix it, because lord knows no one else is thinking straight” she finished throwing her hands up then slid onto the bed.
“You’ve been out of it all day. Just kind of wondering around in a daze, and you didn’t eat anything at dinner. I was worried about you so I came to check on you” Blake was now standing by Dracos bed looking on worriedly at the blond boy.
“Come now, I’ve dealt with it no need for more tears” He said and handed the girl his handkerchief and patted her on the back.
Draco threw himself on to his bed and dropped his arm across his eyes and sighed. Then his eyes widened he had completely forgot Blakes letter. He dug in his robe pocket and pulled out the crinkled up envelope. He broke the seal and carefully pulled out the letter his heart racing with excitement and read it.
