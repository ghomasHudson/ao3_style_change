Harry paused and raised his eyebrows at him. "What are you talking about?"
"When?" Harry muttered.
Draco snorted, "Do you see a scar on her forehead, no, I do see blonde hair though."
"No," Draco replied leaning in. "The thought about being front page didn't cross my mind at the time, and I didn't expect it to be a big deal to be seen with Harry."
How did he not know? He thought, trying to remember if he did know and just forgot. "He works at the ministry? I have never seen him."
"You alright?" Draco shouted, turning his head around to look at Harry, who looked like he was enjoying the thrill of riding for the first time.
Theo looked up from his book. Blaise stood up and cheered loudly, walking over and patting Draco hard on the back.
After Harry got dressed into his Auror robes, he went downstairs in 12 Grimmauld place and made his way into the kitchen where Draco was now sat with his reading glasses and quill, reading and dissecting the daily prophet.
Harry put a hand on his lap quickly. "Erm, yes, just last night catching up with me, had drinks with Dean and Seamus."
"Some bad, some good, all depends on the side your on doesn't it?" she giggled again, "What side are you on Draco?"
"Are you okay?" Harry asked quietly.
The conversation he and Harry and this morning played through his mind, and he felt even worse, "why am I such a dick?" He sighed sinking into the sofa in the sitting room, "I just need to solve this case, then take Harry on a long vacation."
"I am fine," He muttered under his breath, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand.
"Potter?" Malfoy eyed him irritatedly.
"You were thinking about something; I could see it in your eyes," Draco smirked dipping his quill into a pot of ink and then continued writing his letter.
There was a long moment where Harry and Draco just stared at the floor and their surroundings.
"Technically he wasn't trying to poison you," Hermione replied but gave them an apologetic look. "Alright if you're that worried get one, but only because they can come in useful should anyone get poisoned accidentally or purposely."
"All those against Draco Malfoy returning to Hogwarts under the conditions discussed here today, raise your hands," Kingsley said loudly again, and, to Harry surprise, only six hands were raised. "All those for?" The rest of the Wizengamot raised their hands. "Very well. Draco Malfoy, though your actions in the past have been more than questionable, and if it weren't for the fact that you have the Headmistress and Harry Potter here vouching for your freedom you would most likely be seeing a very different outcome, so I suggest you keep your head down and work hard in school."
"I am sure, I know what I am doing, and Draco isn't that bad anymore, he is very professional and hard-working," Harry said truthfully.
Hermione had outdone herself, it was exactly how he envisioned it to be, the large buffet table held all Harry's favourite foods and sweets the present table was overfilled with presents. Panic hit him when he couldn't see the birthday cake, the essential part of his surprise.
"You used us?" Ernie said to them angrily. "I have you know; I do not like to be used."
"Do you want to come to lunch with me tomorrow?" Draco seemed nervous asking the question.
"And how do you suggest we do that?" Harry asked annoyed.
Harry nodded and gave a small smile.
"That was a foul," He shouted with the rest of the crowd to the referee but they didn't listen.
"Yes Draco, in the outfit you have carefully selected." Harry couldn't help but grin, he was so used to Draco's quirks it made him love him more.
"I have read about you and your family and what you have done, I would like you to leave," The waitress replied.
"Probably only wants Harry to go so he can show off and win," Ron said.
"Why, what are you doing at two?" Harry asked intrusively.
"No, they wouldn't charm themselves in would they?"
"How did you get that?" Draco gasped across the table. "It's not supposed to be out yet."
Harry's face reddened and felt sad that his reign of being the best at potions was entirely over.
Too far gone, Harry obediently played with the hard nub of flesh, tweaking and twisting it between slender fingers, his eyes closed in pleasure.
"Dawlish is looking into it; he is under the impression that Robards has been up to some shady dealings."
"Well, Teddy doesn't know you..."
Harry nodded with his mouth full.
"We didn't realise you would be coming, Potter," Lucius Malfoy said in a snide tone.
"I... Have to go," Harry muttered, opening the office door and hurrying out.
"Yep, your father," He turned to Draco. "Came in earlier and gave evidence against Robards. Ron and Dawlish searched his office and found a flask of polyjuice potion, clippings of white blonde hair and photographs of you swapping a door handle."
Lucius muttered something under his breath and started placing sandwiches on his plate.
"I will go get us some drinks," He told Harry brushing his hand against his. "Don't go anywhere."
"Well I am sorry," Harry said. "I promise you I am going to be around you so much you will be begging me to go away."
"I like you, Harry," Robards said composing himself feeling slightly embarrassed from the rejection.
"She isn't my date, my mother invited her, she is trying to arrange our future," Draco replied grimacing.
"Please can you pass me the gravy," Harry asked Pansy who was closest to it. "If she wakes up he can put her back to sleep." He poured the gravy over his turkey and handed it to Draco.
Draco walked past Potter and sat in the chair in front of his desk; it was a lot bigger and nicer than his own office, which wasn't a big surprise. Potter got everything he wanted.
"Master Draco, please Master Draco wake up," The nervous squeak of Juno was calling him. "Master Draco you have a visitor, you must wake up."
"That was my anniversary present to you," Draco said quietly, "I thought after 15 years we should renew our vows and now just felt like the right moment. I don't want you to have to exhaust yourself trying to be the man you don't remember; I want you to be the man you right here right now want to be."
"Were," Harry corrected her. "You were my girlfriend."
"No thank you, I think you should have them before Grandma sees you pigging out."
He packed up the things in his office that seemed important and threw away everything else, he carefully placed the picture of him and Draco on top of the box and placed the resignation letter over it. Standing by the closed door, he took one last look at the office.
"Mister Malfoy, Mister Malfoy," They called as he walked towards the lifts. "Mister Potter, Mister Potter."
"I didn't," He said. "I told you I needed you."
"You're not ill, come on," Malfoy sighed.
"Yes," Harry moaned as Draco rubbed his hand up and down the shaft.
"Thank you for coming, Mr Potter," Robards said in a fake polite tone.
"Study, desk, middle drawer," Draco directed as they walked ahead toward the study.
He was back at Hogwarts; in Professor Snape's Defence against the dark arts class, he was staring aimlessly at the board in front of him, he was confused, they were copying down ways to defeat A Malfoy. He was a Malfoy; Snape liked Draco he made sure he was his favourite. He raised his hand. "Do you need the toilet, Potter?" Professor Snape said in a drawl.
On his way out of The Manor he ran into his mother walking with Pansy Parkinson, they were deep in conversation pointing at things and smiling in agreement.
"Ron was just telling me what happened at work today, I can't believe it, I mean I can but, I didn't realise there was all that other stuff."
"No," Harry replied with a hint of annoyance. "I am telling you, I don't need you as my secretary anymore, maybe you should take this box and make a career out of it." He took out a medium size neatly wrapped brown paper package from his drawer with a bow tied around it.
"There are many speculations from my readers saying that you weren't meeting for part of your case, and you just wanted to meet up as friends, can you confirm or deny this?"
The empty bowls disappeared and were replaced with the main course of lemon herb roasted chicken served with corn on the cob, roast potatoes and a selection of vegetables. The only sound was the knives and forks hitting the plate as they ate and occasionally glanced at each other. Draco often caught his mother glaring at Astoria and looking at Draco with concern in her eyes. Lucius was also glancing at Draco and Astoria with an odd expression on his face.
"How long can we have fun for before something gets leaked before one of our friends lets it slip? There were at least thirty people here last night; it only takes one of them to say something."
"No, wait, it was an accident, he said the wrong spell, we were trying to get Theodore back to the Ministry, but he messed up."
Harry said nothing.
The two girls followed an excited third year into the shop and made sure they didn't catch the cloak on anything. Ginny watched Luna as her eyes darted towards the valentines stand. She grabbed hold of Ginny's hand and pulled her forwards trying not to knock into Dean and Seamus, who were also looking nervously at the stand.
"Does it bring back any memories?" Draco asked observing Harry carefully.
Harry gaped at Luna, then felt furious at Ginny and Blaise for even thinking that plan would work. Even though Harry had thought about Draco a few times like that, he felt it was still completely inappropriate to even try getting them together; he was his enemy, they despised each other in school they taunted each other at any chance they could. So why would they even think that them two getting together would be a good idea?
Malfoy laughed. "Oh, Potter, I would love to hear you tell me all about me and my families dark past, but I don't have all day, unlike you I have a Quidditch match to go to at three."
"I lost control somewhere over Birmingham, luckily I was flying lower and had my wand otherwise I would probably have ended up in St Mungo's," Harry said wincing when Draco felt the graze on his cheek.
Harry groaned and rolled over still fast asleep. Incredible, Draco thought.
"Alright, everyone, dinner is ready," Mrs Weasley called placing a crockpot in the middle of the dining table.
"We are hardly the same since school are we? I mean you were an insufferable git then, who thought the world revolved around him and pined over his best friend's sister."
Harry shut his eyes willing the subject to change, but when he felt Draco's hands closed tightly around his own, he knew he would have to talk about it finally. "The only way I am going to be able to tell you what happened is by showing you."
"I think I have a Quidditch match at three and if we were going to find something it will still be here tomorrow, you can either stay here and look or come to the match with me," Malfoy said then blushed and added, "or not."
"And would you have?" Harry asked.
"No one is forcing you to lie on the floor either," Morty sassed back.
"I can't help you if you don't talk to me," Draco said temper rising, flexing his hands anxiously under the table.
Harry pulled out and lay flat on his back on the bed panting heavily next to Draco; it felt like his heart was about to beat out of his chest. “Fuck,” He exhaled heavily.
"Noticed," Ron said impressed. "Looks good, liveable."
"Ron," Harry corrected. "Ron is the reason you are here and not in a cell. Kingsley even knew you were working this case he told me to tell you, "It will do you no good to go looking for him." I just wish you would have told ME about it; I don't need you to get revenge for me."
Draco used the back of his hand to wipe his face, "I have let you down, I am so sorry."
Mr Weasley passed him a piece of parchment and smiled more prominently. Malfoy started walking out the room, putting the parchment in his pocket.
The heat from the fireplace made his mood happy as he cosied up to Harry who sat next to him at the table. Harry had been enjoying his time not working and found himself very busy with their very blonde three-month-old girl Lily Potter-Malfoy, who was finally fast asleep in the stroller next to Lucius. Everyone was in a complete shock to how quickly he had bonded with her, Draco actually thinks she prefers Lucius more than him and Harry.
"Is everything alright, Harry?" Ginny asked across the table to him.
"Great, I will take the Firebolt, you can have the child's broom," Draco smirked heading out of the bedroom.
Harry wasn't in the kitchen or sitting room when he walked through the house. He couldn't possibly still be asleep; he thought as he stalked up the stairs of the cottage almost knocking a picture frame off the wall. He straightened the picture of Harry, and the small boy who he assumed was Teddy. Draco had only met Teddy once when he was about two years old; he had gone to his Aunt Andromeda's home to return things from Bellatrix's vault that she had claimed as her own. It was part of his redemption tour that he forced his parents into.
A tiny bottle flew towards him, and he grabbed it skilfully. He passed the mirror again and stared into it, smiling when he saw Harry smiling back at him.
"Someone has taken Harry," Draco said through gritted teeth.
"Together," Harry agreed eyeing the space between the gate.
Draco turned around and saw Harry walking through the Artium being also blinded by flashes.
Spotted by Draco, Hermione and Ron glanced away, but Harry remained eyes locked carefully on the Blonde. He had whispered something into his mother's ear, and she had turned to look directly at their table.
"James Potter 27th March 1960 - 31st October 1981, Lily Potter 30th January 1960 - 31st October 1981. The last enemy that should be destroyed is death."
"Of course he denies it, he wasn't going to admit it was he?" Arthur chuckled. "It was locked nicely in his desk drawer along with your paperwork on the missing Death Eaters."
He got Harry's attention. "What have they got to say this time?"
"Ron," Hermione gasped. "Tell me you didn't."
"I am not Potter," Draco shouted standing up slamming both hands on the table. "I am Draco Malfoy." A pain shot through his forehead and he was now sat in Dumbledores office.
He sat with Ginny, Blaise, Ron, Harry, and Luna at the dining room table eating bacon sandwiches that Ginny had spent the past ten minutes making for everyone. Draco had to admit they weren't as good as the one he ate at Harry's house the other day.
The name stung his chest, but he didn't let it show, he was fine. "What about Potter?"
"You could have given me a heads up, the girls have set me up with Ernie," Harry frowned,
"No, Mr Malfoy," Harry replied sarcastically.
"We need to talk to him about that, but we are not going to hurt my best mate, agreed?" Harry said trying to bring him back down to calm.
"Your mother has told me to tell you dinner is ready," He replied with a hint of annoyance. "Sometimes I feel like a house-elf with her," He muttered more to himself than to Draco, so Draco ignored him and left the room ensuring that it was fully sealed behind him.
"And is it true you would taunt Harry in school?" Pansy asked cutting him off.
"I KNEW IT," Ginny shouted across the table.
Harry laughed, "I don't think so, we have Angelina Johnson on our team."
“I will allow it, as long as it is not interfering with your performance levels, as soon as I get word you have been late for class, not handed in your homework, I will ensure you are pulled off the team and your second will take over.”
"Okay, but you will tell me eventually?" Draco asked.
"So, it was alright when I was with Ginny?" Harry replied hurt.
He felt Harry's teeth bite his lip softly, then suck it gently. Draco stifled a moan as he felt a twitch in his pants. Harry's free hand was travelling up his jumper and stroking his chest.
They circled around, staring into each other's eyes as if they were ready to begin a duel, hands tight around their wands. There was a long moment of nonverbal conversation between them, Draco ran his free hand through his hair as he felt suddenly exposed.
Harry had gone back down to the kitchen with his suit where Hermione and Ginny were still standing waiting for him impatiently, Ginny's towel was leaning more to one side.
Harry was sitting at the dining room table talking to Ron, while Ginny and Hermione were giggling over her being pregnant.
Harry let go of Draco’s cock, and Draco could feel it turn softer under the pain. Not completely limp but enough. That was all right. For right now that was all right.
"Good Morning, Auror Potter," The lady at the desk outside the door greeted him, Jane Honeywell her plaque on the desk said. "How is Draco doing? I still miss him in the secretary lounge; he was the life of the party."
"Wasn't baby Malfoy on the cover with you yesterday?" Fred asked smirking.
Harry began to wonder if he had always acted like this, or is it since he had the upper hand over Harry that he had become slimy and unbearable to be in the same place alone.
Harry smirked. "Yeah, better." He pulled back his blanket and shuffled to the edge of the bed until his feet found the floor; he stood up and saw a towel to wrap around him. "Okay, I am covered, but I need to find something to wear."
He pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. "I want to ask you something."
"Yeah, could be worse, could be Malfoy," Ron laughed his eyes following Malfoy as he walked through the door. Harry uncrossed his legs and kicked Ron's shin. "Ouch. Sorry, didn't mean to offend your boyfriend."
Friday 1st July 2005
"If I remember this correctly, you said 'Draco I have to let you go, your talents are wasted as my secretary.'"
"It was Ron," Harry remembered. "Ron, cast the spell."
They walked side by side; he had both hands in his pockets. "So, what made you buy a cafe?" She asked quietly trying to make small talk.
"And?"
"There was a person, who I won't name yet, who was blackmailing me and told me to cut ties with Draco, or they would release private pictures of him and me," Harry replied trying to be as honest as possible without telling her everything.
"Harry, this is Rose and Hugo, our children," Ron spoke, "Kids, Uncle Harry doesn't have a good memory at the moment remember, so he will be confused until he starts remembering things again."
"What did you do?" Ron gasped.
*****
He decided to get out of bed, which caught the attention of Zabini, who just nodded his head at him.
"Yes."
"Oh, I thought our sad failing relationships was the reason," Harry said sarcastically.
"You seem much happier, a bit peaky, but I am sure once you have had a few of my Sunday lunches you will be back to normal."
"Please Draco, you know I can't tell you, I regret my part in what happened that night, so I am not going to make it worse by telling anyone, not even you." Blaise walked to the door and held it open, which meant their conversation was over. "Are we good?"
"Well?" Lucius said impatiently continuing his crushing when Draco hadn't said anything.
"For Merlin's sake mother, we are not telling you we are getting married, we are here as two people who have fallen in love and want to  be together, and we are letting you both know, so we don't have to sneak  around behind your backs."
"Wow, Harry you look amazing," Ernie said, practically jumping up and down.
"Really guys?" Ron said unimpressed, and Draco had to agree with him as Harry wobbled unsteadily on his feet to grab the glass and to hold it with both hands.
Draco watched Harry stumble away from Ernie, and he too was heading in the same direction as himself. Draco grabbed a glass of wine and leaned against the same wall Harry had been propping himself up against. The live band was blaring all around the room; it seemed to be a weird sisters tribute band by the sounds of it.
Harry felt Draco's hand move to his lap. Oh shit, Harry thought, eyes widening.
~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry thought there was definitely something odd going on, but it was Fred and George, and they were always in cahoots about something or asking him weird questions about himself.
"Well, now you can do it without Snape's annotations," Hermione said with a hint of pleasure.
"We are not together," Harry said. "I mean, I don't think we are... officially, we haven't talked about it."
"Robards has been blackmailing Draco and myself with those pictures you saw; he has been threatening to send them to the Daily Prophet for weeks."
Harry twisted his mouth and looked at his feet, "You don't think I'm an insufferable git anymore?" He asked in a mutter.
He opened the first of the boys' dorms with the gold number one on it and found Blaise already sat bouncing up and down on a bed with Theo sat on the floor reading the same Arithmancy book as on the train.
"How can you tell?" Harry asked, "I mean, how do we know what we are looking for?"
"DRACO!" Ron Weasley was running towards him with the look of anger and horror on his face.
Harry raised an eyebrow at him. "You would really move out of your Manor?"
"Goodbye then Potter," He stood in the fireplace for what seemed to be the last time. "Malfoy Manor," He called trying to keep his voice from breaking.
"One moment," she replied, sounding ticked off by him.
Harry looked at the Draco approved outfit that was hanging on the door to the bathroom. It was black tailored trousers with a dark emerald green shirt, with a matching tie and black suit jacket. Harry couldn't leave the house without Draco approving his outfits first. He always says 'You are not leaving our house with my wedding ring on, dressed like a squib.' Harry had given up arguing with him about it long ago.
Breaking news:
"Any good articles?" He asked sitting in his usual seat at the head of the table.
Lucius sat down in his usual chair and crossed his leg over the other. "Haven't we had this conversation before?"
Draco read the sign a few times and felt tears coming to the surface, he turned away, faking a cough and wiping his eyes.
"Well, Harry has resigned," Draco announced making Lucius raise an eyebrow.
Draco sighed. "My father thinks you would be trying to find out how I could afford a whole Quidditch team."
"Ah fuck," The engagement ring slipped from his hand as he used it to steady himself on the chair. He managed to sit himself down and put his head in his hands. "What the fuck just happened?" He tried to replay the day in his head but it was all blurring into one, his mind started focusing on the blonde hair he had been facing at lunch. "Draco," He whispered suddenly standing up. He shifted over to the kitchen bureau and pulled out a quill and parchment from the drawer.
Draco broke apart from Harry with a broad smile on his face; he was going to do the best he could to make sure he did a better job than Potter. He just hoped he was drunk enough to deal with Zacharias Smith. He gave him a sideways glance and sighed as he was trying to get the rest of the soup with his tongue. He needed an Order of Merlin first class award after tonight, he thought sourly.
"You can have mice when you get into my office or nothing at all," Harry said whispering in Parseltongue.
Harry was in conversation with Granger and Weasley, and Draco was pleased when he saw Blaise and Ginny walking over to them, which meant they could all have a conversation without it looking suspicious. Draco never thought he would be this happy to have Ginny and Blaise be together.
"Miss what?" Harry asked, staring at the players, eyes darting around.
"Glad you asked Harry," George smirked and took out an empty bottle of Firewhisky from the bin next to the desk. "Medicinal purposes," He said, pointing to his ear. He placed the bottle on their desk and spun it around until it stopped and was pointing at Fred. "Truth or Dare, Fred?"
Harry got quickly to his feet. “No more, come on I am hungry, let’s get a burger.”
"So, do we start taking bets on how the family meal goes tomorrow?" Blaise asked rubbing his palms together excitedly. "10 Galleons, Harry ends up dangling upside down."
"No, it's my fault; I shouldn't have come on to you like that; I have had a few too many glasses of wine."
"I'm sorry," Harry said quietly.
"What was is it you said earlier, Yee has little faith?" Draco smirked. "Give me some credit I think I can tell the difference between my husband and a fake, plus you are wearing your wedding ring."
"How about we take it in turns carrying it?" Draco suggested. "And we can do two things you want to do."
Draco got dressed in silence, he walked to the door and turned to him.
Draco decided to have lunch in Diagon Alley today; he thought he might as well try to act as normal as possible, eat food with the regular witches and wizards on his break instead of locked up in his office.
"About time," She said and stood up, though she didn't sound annoyed with him.
"It feels like we never see you anymore," Mrs Weasley said with a tear in her eye.
Harry's bedroom door was wide open, and Harry wasn't sprawled on his bed naked this time to Draco's dismay. The bathroom door was shut, and he could hear the shower running. He slumped onto the edge of the bed trying to force himself not to rip his clothes off and join him.
"It's alright," Potter replied. "I had forgotten how you react to having no chocolate frogs."
"A letter has arrived for you," She handed him a piece of folded up parchment.
They walked over to the drinks table, and he picked up two glasses of firewhisky drinking them both himself, he was going to need more if he was going to be stuck with him all night. Ernie took a goblet of wine, giving Harry a slight wink; he apparently thought Harry was going to have a drunk hook up with him.
"What happened on Thursday and Friday? I was informed you took off without letting anyone where you were going or doing."
"Please Grandma," Teddy jumped excitedly. "He is my new friend."
"I have missed this so much," Draco whispered into Harry's ear as he nibbled it and moved his lips down his neck to the collarbone.
"Mister Malfoy, do you think you will be voted best dressed for the 5th year in a row?" A reporter that was in smart dress robes asked him.
Harry in passion was very sexy.
Draco and Ron arrived at Theodore Nott's house, it was silent, and that worried Draco. Ron had Harry's invisibility cloak on and was clutching his and Harry's wand.
~~~~~~~~~~
"Yes, your fourth year, in particular," The first twin said smirking. "That was the year you got turned into a ferret wasn't it?"
"No, he doesn't much like those," the witch shrugged.
Draco’s hands slid round to grip at Harry’s arse, and he whimpered as Harry pushed himself against the head of his cock. Holding Draco's cock steady, Harry lowered himself slowly until he felt the widest part of the head slip inside, and stop. Draco’s fingertips pressed into his bottom cheeks, and Harry saw his chest lift and fall with shallow, quick breaths. His eyes were shut tight as he worked his lips and grunted unintelligibly.
"And what is your involvement in this Mr Malfoy? As I recall you no longer work at the Ministry," Kingsley frowned.
He braced himself as best he could as he pushed back harder, faster. He forced Harry to the speed he needed and fucked himself like that. He fucked Harry like that.
"Mister Malfoy, Is it true you are the new owner?" One of the reporters asked.
He led the way out of the library, and through the manor to the east wing where he stood in front of a blank wall waiting for the familiar black door to appear.
"Then that should just leave Goldstein and Macmillian and Turpin and Brocklehurst."
Harry frowned curiously but nodded his understanding. He couldn't quite believe he had managed to spend over an hour alone with three Slytherins. He stood up with Teddy now fully asleep.
"Good morning," Draco sang kissing his mother on the cheek before sitting in his seat.
He pulled his jumper back down and watched Harry sit up straight again taking calming breaths; his hair looked more messy than usual.
"Now if I ask him another question, he can lie to me," George told them. "Fred, did you sleep with all the girls on the Gryffindor Quidditch team?"
"I'm sorry, did I interrupt your conversation?" She asked, looking between Harry and Draco.
Appleby Arrow Try-outs Today
"Hmm, I wonder where I put them?" He paused then gasped dramatically. "Oh, dear, I think I put them in a pile to be sent to the prophet."
Neville had stood up, and everyone turned around to him and watched as he started his speech. "Thank you, everyone, for coming to our engagement party; it has been a great night so far, we hope everyone has been enjoying themselves and are not too drunk to get on the dance floor in a moment and dance like its 1999." Draco rolled his eyes as everyone laughed. "We have set our wedding date," Neville continued, "It will be January 5th, 2006, so save the date, and we hope you will all be there to share our special day."
"So what does this mean?"
"Smith, Boot and Finch-Fletchly," He scowled.
She looked at him offended and then turned her back on him, pretending as though she was keeping an eye on the house elves. Draco rolled his eyes behind her back.
"No, don't I appreciate your concern, I am fine. Honestly, I just need some Murtlap essence," Harry groaned sitting down in the chair.
"And they just stay in here?" Harry asked as his eyes scanned each shelf left to right up and down.
Harry watched his eleven-year-old self riding his Nimbus 2000 from his first ever Quidditch match on the front cover. "Unofficial," He corrected him. "I don't even know who J.K.R is or how he got the information for these books."
Teddy looked like he was going to spend the whole night thinking about the clue to give, and then finally he smiled. "It's big, with wings."
"Do you think he knows Ron is an excellent chess player?" Harry muttered to Draco.
"Just do as you're told. Honestly, you're more, and more like your father each day," She insulted.
"No further questions," Harry said bitterly and started walking away from them. Harry felt his cheeks go red with both anger and embarrassment as he heard them calling him back.
Hermione shook her head. "You are so oblivious sometimes," She said, opening the office door. "Stop drinking, and stop feeling sorry for yourself."
They all turned to look at Draco Malfoy stood at the entrance with his mother linked in his arm. He was a lot paler than the last time Harry had seen him nearly two years ago. He was wearing his usual all-black suit and signature smirk.
The man inside looked up, it was indeed Theodore Nott. "You and I need a little chat."
"We have been looking everywhere for you, what if something had happened, what would I have told your father?" Mrs Weasley trailed off on a rant. Harry and Hermione ducked out before she could start on them next.
A witch holding a quill and a piece of parchment stood in front of his table and tapped her shoe impatiently while chewing gum. "What can I get you?" She asked in a drawl.
Green eyes finally opened. Harry smirked up at the crestfallen Draco. “If I don’t remove it, we’ll never get anything done.”
"I would risk my fucking life for you; I told you the day I married you, if anyone hurt you I would kill them, I would kill for you."
Lucius shrugged. "It didn't say," He said staying where he was. "Well, aren't you going to open it?"
"I'm sorry Harry," Draco said softly.
Draco stood up and walked back over to the pensieve taking out his wand; he emptied the contents back into the vial. He closed his eyes and pointed the tip to his forehead and withdrew it allowing the memory to be extracted. He placed it into the pensieve and swirled it gently around.
He heard the fireplace behind him. "Hey guy's, everyone is in the sitting room."
"Yeah," Neville replied and kissed her cheek. He put his wand to his neck and cast sonorous to amplify his voice. "Hello everybody, If you haven't found what table you are on there is a chart by the doors, if you can kindly take your seats."
"Oh, that's excellent news," She beamed. "Well, how does this Friday sound?"
You're a man now, boy
"And Mr Wealsey," George said.
Teddy scrunched up his face like he was trying really hard to remember; then let out a resigning sigh and shook his head. "I can't remember, there was a lot of food, and I was asleep most of the party."
"But why did it have to be Potter? I thought you would have at least gone for someone who wasn't the fucking chosen one."
"Come on, Narcissa, it was obvious."
"I need to ask you about the article that came out yesterday," Draco finally said flexing his hands.
"Grandma Molly never lets me go; she said she doesn't want me to get any bad habits from Uncle Fred and Uncle George."
"Anything after that?" Draco asked, hopeful.
"You get a sparkle in your eyes when you stop over thinking things and just relax, when I first ran into you I didn't see it, but now I see it all the time, because you haven't had one predictable day this whole month, because Harry Potter, you thrive on unpredictability, that's what makes you, you."
"I have read snippets in the prophet while I was in the hospital but you never know what's true with them it's mostly lies, lies and more lies," Harry shrugged.
"Do you hear that Gin? They want a private conversation in our home, at our table where we are sitting." Blaise said dramatically.
"All that has changed now, little brother," George chuckled.
"No Harry, it's me, Draco."
Draco pulled Harry down an empty corridor, between his office and Mr Weasleys there was a maintenance closet that nobody ever went into. He unlocked the door with his wand, and they quickly went inside, closing the door behind them.
Ron drew out his wand and Draco did just as quick. "And there he is, The real Draco Malfoy," he turned his head slightly towards Harry. "You don't need  your memory to remember this is who Malfoy really is."
Harry sat up straighter in his chair and smoothed out his suit jacket, Draco had wanted that colour but was now glad he didn't as he thought Potter looked absolutely breathtaking in it, though he would never say that out loud.
Harry's face looked like he was thinking about it for a moment but it was too late Ron looked at their table. "Harry?" Ron called surprised, walking over to them. "I never thought I would see you two sat together."
"Yes, for the ball tonight," Draco replied like he had read his mind. "We had this conversation this morning; don't tell me you forgot already."
"Who's playing?"
"No, and I couldn't tell you even if I had, it's called customer confidentiality, now please leave if you are not buying anything." The waitress replied loudly. The door rattled open then quickly slammed shut. Draco leaned in and kissed Harry hard on the lips. "The coast is clear, Harry Potter."
Christmas 2000, was spent at The Weasleys in the Burrow everyone was there apart from Draco's Mother. Everyone was all happy and smiling as they posed for photos and the meals looked delicious.
Draco jumped out of his skin, startled by being snuck up on. "You could've announced your presence before almost giving me a heart attack," Draco scolded.
"Did anything happen at the party?" Draco pressed for more.
"Well that makes me glad you did have work, Ronald," Hermione said scolding Ron.
"Yeah, Draco told me," Harry said deciding to tell the truth.
The sound of Hermione and Mrs Weasley squealing broke the shocked silence, and then Ginny was attacked with hugs and kisses from her mother. "Oh Ginny, I knew it, I had a feeling, I am so proud! Head Girl! That's nearly the whole family now. Oh, Ginny, I just knew it."
"You get given a stick, and you have to hook it onto one of the ducks some have a colour on the bottom which means you win a prize. If it is blank you just win a goldfish," Harry explained.
Draco laughed darkly as he worked Harry's cock in his hands, getting used to the feel of it and feeling it pulsate as Harry moaned louder as he worked quicker.
He scoffed at the article in disgust he was so tired of his family name inevitably becoming a political burden on his career and personal investments. He reminisced the time when he went to America with Blaise; he would employ a fictitious name which he wouldn't get away with in this country as he was reasonably known. He thought for a moment about sending an owl to the prophet to complain of the apparent bias, but he thought better of it. He had realised by now the only way to earn respect was to prove them wrong and being better than them.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, uncertain of what was going on. "Malfoy, now is it?"
"You talk about him in your sleep, and whenever he is mentioned you smile like a bafoon."
The Manor had been fully converted to a completely different place it looked warm and inviting, whereas usually, it was cold and dim lit. There were purple carpets laid out through to the ballroom, and a backdrop with the daily prophet logo splashed across where every guest would get their photo taken.
"Enlighten me," Draco smirked.
Harry left the kitchen and padded up the stairs. He came to a halt outside a violent purple door that was open a crack. It had 'Nymphadora Tonks' written on the front, with the first name forcibly scratched out with a knife, so only 'Tonks' was legible. He was going to try another room when he heard loud sobbing from the other side. He pushed the door open carefully to see Draco Malfoy curled on the bed in the foetal position, shaking and crying with empty boxes of chocolate frogs all over the bed.
"Have you come to take me to the lunch you have promised me?" Blaise asked, picking up half a sandwich and swinging his hips in his chair, so it rocked side to side.
Draco took hold of Harry's hands. "Harry James Potter, today I stand here with you, sharing one of the biggest moments we will ever have or ever thought we would have. I have become a better man in the short time we have become friends, colleagues and more importantly, partners. I still have a lot of growing up to do, we both know that but I want to grow up with you, I want to be sat in Grimmauld Place in 50 years and still be sat next to you. So I Draco Lucius Malfoy promise to stick with you through sickness and health through thick and thin I will love, honour and obey you till death do us part."
Draco's head snapped up to look at them. "Is Harry not in there?"
Malfoy sighed and softened slightly. "It's fine, just please read carefully."
"She tried to use the cruciatus curse on you when you dumped her," Blaise exclaimed.
He took his invisibility cloak off Morty and placed him on the floor next to the tree so he can slither up it freely. He took the box of mice out of his satchel and threw it at him, which he caught quickly.
Malfoy straightened himself up and put on a straight face. "I wasn't worried."
"I don't care, if you want to know something just ask me," Harry said sitting down at the head of the table breathing hard.
He knocked on the front door, and the noise died out, as Mrs Weasley opened the door. Her face fell from grinning to a frown. It didn't bother Draco; he wasn't expecting a warm welcome, it was only really Ginny, Blaise and Mr Weasley he cared about.
"Interesting. So now it's the Masquerade Ball, and you two are spotted sitting together at the VIP table. You are seen dancing and together the whole night. The daily prophet story was confusing, and they brushed off the juicy story as being a statement, can you reveal if this was for a statement or have you both come out as gay?"
Draco perused his fingers. "I guess, but you are going to tell me one of these days whose girlfriend you screwed."
"Please, Mr Weasley I know I can find it," Draco pleaded, he wasn't ready to part from Harry just yet. "Just one more week."
Draco scowled again and strutted into the dining room where, to his surprise, his parents weren't alone.
Draco raised an eyebrow again. "Is our history with each other going to be a problem, Potter?" He asked with the same tone as Harry had used.
"Good afternoon, Mr Potter," Lucious Malfoy said stiffly walking towards him.
Draco hesitantly read Richard Brown's unfavourable review about his cafe and was immediately disheartened by it. The food was delicious and received exceptional customer service.  The identified issues he was that the modern decor was ill-suited with the rest of Diagon Alley, and he was a Malfoy, which was written in so many words.
Draco rolled his eyes as her eyes began to well up. "Oh, don't be so dramatic mother, it's called having friends."
"I didn't plan on getting caught," He turned his head back to Ron.
"You seem to be struggling," Lucius spoke amused at the sight.
Hermione had outdone herself, it was exactly how he envisioned it to be, the large buffet table held all Harry's favourite foods and sweets the present table was overfilled with presents. Panic hit him when he couldn't see the birthday cake, the essential part of his surprise.
Kingsley raised an eyebrow at Harry. "And how do you suggest that will work?"
"Did he fire you?" Draco gasped, clapping a hand to his mouth.
“You sure,” asked Harry, not really caring to hear the answer as he slathered the cold lotion over his cock. “Fuck. Cold. But god damn that feels good.” He fisted his cock in his hand and rocked into it a couple of times.
Narcissa pursed her lips about to respond, but changed her mind and began to stumble away losing balance on her low heeled black boots.
They held hands at their closest apparition point and appeared outside the gates of The Malfoy Manor. The gates had been tastefully decorated with red and gold balloons.
"Are you asking if finding out who cast a memory charm on Harry, is worth it?" Draco's hand tightened around the wand in his pocket.
Three hours after visiting his parents grave Harry had not expected to have been sat in the office of the Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt. He had received an owl an hour after he had got home requesting to see him as soon as possible. Draco hadn't been pleased he had to leave him, but he told him he would go home and let his mother know he was still alive, but Harry assumed he was feeling a bit sentimental after seeing Harry's parents grave.
"I'm sorry," he began. He dropped his hand, and took a step toward his... he had no idea what Harry was to him now. "That you thought I was using you." He removed Harry's glasses and folded them neatly, setting them on the ground near the chairs. "I'm sorry about a lot of things. But not about this."
"He’s going into early retirement," Fred said with a mischievous smile.
"Of course I will," Harry replied, he leaned over and kissed him on the lips.
"I am sure you will be able to deal with a picture of you kissing a guy for a couple of weeks till it becomes old news."
******
He had drifted to sleep and let the glass in his hand slip out and thud to the ground, His head tilted to the side, pulling him slowly down, so his head was now touching the cold black floorboard beneath him.
"I thought we were going out for a meal?" Harry asked him confused.
"I'm sorry, I wasn't sure what you wanted," Harry said nervously and hating himself for being an inconsiderate prat as Malfoy had so kindly told him.
"Boys, Pack it in right now, you're both acting like a pair of schoolboys," Hermione snapped.
They stood in front of Goblin who was busy sliding pound coins down a chute.  Malfoy cleared his throat to command the Goblins attention who looked at him irritated.
Draco's parents had been slumped in the corner of the ballroom most of the night drinking a lot of wine, he was pretty sure they were so drunk they wouldn't remember anything in the morning, which is what Harry was hoping and they would forget about Draco's idiotic idea of Sunday lunch. He had tried to back out of it, but again, Draco had dangled their deal over his head, if only he had brought Teddy a proper broom, he would have smoked Draco.
She sat back down a little putout and went back to the newspaper.
"What's your excuse for yesterday?" Ginny bit back.
The action hadn't gone unnoticed by Draco as he placed a hand over one of them and whispered into his ear. "What's wrong?"
Mr Weasley, who was usually the most accepting and supportive Weasley had been acting weird around him since he had arrived, Harry knew it was because of the photo of him kissing Malfoy. He wanted to say something to him, but there were so many people in the burrow that any one of them could hear him.
He pulled back the curtains to show his Fiance how he looked.
Draco didn't know whether to be pleased or concerned that he could see something Harry couldn't. "It was invisible, but I cast a reveal spell, a dark wizard has been here."
"Ok, great, there is a cafe I go to it serves the best food," Draco smiled.
“You knew?”
Lucius sighed and held up his hands in surrender backing slowly out of the room.
Draco didn't respond straight away; he looked as though he was trying to focus his eyes on Harry. "You lied to me," he repeated wobbling on his feet. Harry pulled a chair back and told him to sit down. "No, you lied to me; I will rather stand." He said, sounding like Teddy when he didn't get his way.
Fred opened the safe and pulled out a little Phial with a clear liquid inside.
Draco removed the tie from the bedpost so Harry could get on his hands and knees, Draco unzipped his own trousers pulling them down with his briefs and slowly inserted his length inside Harry being careful not to hurt him.
"It's fine. I will do it; you will only mess it up," Malfoy sneered.
"Are you guys moving?" Harry asked.
"Forgive me, I simply mean you surprised me, I wasn't expecting Lucius Malfoy's son want to graft with the regular folk," Richard faked a smile, and Draco forced himself to smile politely back.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Edwin?" Harry sighed, putting the glass between his, hands on the table and playing with it.
Harry started to walk towards him carefully. "We need to get him, out of here."
"What? I'm on your side," Draco smirked shaking Blaise's hand. "Oh great, here comes Robards."
"Draco snuck into the ministry holding cells and almost got himself thrown in one himself, for trying to use the cruciatus curse on Theodore Nott." Ron looked like a completely different person; he had rarely seen him get so wound up.
"Very well, I will let you get back to enjoying your birthday; try not to worry about this Robards business; I will be sorting it out."
"Be careful you might start making your girlfriend jealous," Theo said from behind his Arithmancy book.
"You will also notice," She continued calling for attention once more. "There are changes in staffing this year. The Defence Against the Dark Arts position has been taken on by Bill Weasley, who fought valiantly in the Battle of Hogwarts and has plenty of experience in curse breaking."
His face reddened as he realised what he said and that he had probably upset Parvati, who has always been so kind to him.
Harry felt a little caught off guard by the news of the women being Draco's date and felt a weird sense of jealousy kick in. He looked at Draco, who was staring at his glass of wine intensely.
"She know's I like you," Draco muttered.
"Ah, Mr Malfoy," Mr Weasley said, putting the poster carefully flat on the desk. "Take a seat."
"Me too," Harry replied.
Harry Potter was dying. The heat in the office was killing him, it was the hottest day of the year so far, and he had to be stuck in the stuffiest, hottest office in the whole of the Auror department. He had cast as many cooling down spells as he could think of, but it was no use he was too hot. He had taken as many clothes off that he could without exposing too much flesh; he even had taken his shoes and socks off, luckily no-one could see under his desk unless they walked behind his chair.
Anabel held open the door to let in his best friend Hermione Granger. Her bushy hair bounced as she walked into the carrying what looked to be a newspaper. Anabel closed the door behind, and Harry could have sworn he saw her smirk.
Draco had been sitting in the chair he had sat in the other day when he was given the assignment. "You wanted to see me, sir?"
"Before me you were miserable. I have seen you laugh more times these past two weeks than I have ever seen you laugh, and now you're pushing me away, for what? For more time in a stuffy office? Just this morning you were ready to quit and move to America."
"Like circling daily prophet articles?" Harry frowned even though his eyes were welling up.
"I am crying cause I am mad at you," Ginny snapped. "You have waited until we are back at school to decide to break up with me."
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "So you kiss all your friends?"
Draco walked over to him to try and help him, but his hand went right through his left shoulder.
"We have come to collect you," Ginny said smiling.
Thrusting hard back inside, Draco honoured his wishes; he was close now too he could feel Harry's orgasm as they both let go and exploded their load. Draco quickly pulled out as they both fell into each other breaths ragged.
"Can we not talk about him anymore," Astoria said uncomfortably.
"Tell you what?" Harry asked angrily as he pushed open the kitchen door and walked inside looking at the startled looks on their faces. "It's one thing to talk about me behind my back but another to do it in my own house."
"Come on mate," Zabini said coming up behind Malfoy. "It's just a chocolate frog."
"It has feathers."
Draco's grey eyes peered over the book; Harry could see he was smirking behind the book. "I am reading, this very boring and overly exaggerated autobiography."
"You don't need to know how to drive to go on the bumper cars you just need to put your foot on the pedal and turn a wheel."
Hermione and Ron finally confessed to Harry that they were secretly seeing each other behind his back.
"You really need to clear out your desk, Harry," Draco said a little out of breath.
"What's the potion?" Draco asked curiously.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"
"Get off me Weasley, I can walk by myself." Draco tried to yank himself away, but Ron was surprisingly strong.
"Christmas day," She said sarcastically. "The Masquerade Ball on Saturday, the one we graciously volunteered to host, thanks to your father." She glared at Lucius.
“It’s fine; can I think about it?” Harry asked.
"I wanted to reply in person," Draco smirked.
Draco gulped.
"What's up, mate?" Ron asked concerned.
"Teddy isn't a Weasley; he is my cousin," Draco replied still not relaxing. "If I want to treat him, I should; it's partly my fault his broom broke in the first place."
Ron and Hermione were sat in front of the fire when Harry returned to the common room; he wasn't going to let them know just yet that he asked Malfoy to teach him to cast nonverbal spells, he never seemed to tell them much when it came to his encounters with Malfoy. After his apparent obsession with him in his sixth year, they seemed to either switch off when he mentioned him or get annoyed with him.
"It doesn't matter about the money," Draco said objectively.
"Well, I am going to see them tomorrow. Why don't I ask her to meet you?" Harry suggested realising that was probably a bad idea considering he was supposed to be going to to the game under his invisibility cloak.
"And who is your date for this evening?"
"I thought you said your father wasn't in contact with any Death Eaters?" Harry said trying to remain as calm as possible.
"They have heard that I am in a secret relationship with a woman," Harry replied laughing a little. "They wanted to know who it was."
"Oh, my apologies, Mister Malfoy," She said bowing her head.
They rubbed their bodies together, erections hard and taut between them. Harry nibbled on Draco's ear, his lover gasping, and Draco cupped the peachy arse and squeezed, Harry, moaning in his ear. Harry poured all his love for his boyfriend into his kisses. Draco's body moved beneath him, passion building between them.
"Were you going to tell me you had a date?" Harry asked turning slightly towards him.
"Harry saw you," Draco said a little more agitated, he couldn't work out whether he was trying to deny it.
"I will see you soon, behave will you?" Harry warned before leaving the office and locking it behind him.
"No, my dad says peas are the most overrated green vegetable, and it shouldn't need any more attention," Luna said seriously pushing her bowl away from her.
"You weren't to know," Harry said quietly moving to sit next to him.
After a long moment, Draco rested his forehead against Harry's back.
"I remember that night, I was with Hermione and Ron, and we spoke in the restroom."
"We're, screwed," Harry whispered.
Moments later the finished meals had disappeared and were replaced with bread and butter pudding with custard, Draco's favourite dessert since he was a kid. He smiled pleased as he took a big spoonful.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair after putting on his round glasses, and let out a long sigh finally deciding to get out of bed. He stumbled a bit as he stood up and felt a pile of his clothes on the floor. It was an obstacle course to get to his ensuite bathroom; there were cups, clothes and shoes all over his bedroom floor, it had been accumulating for a few weeks now since he quit his job at the ministry.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. "It's not like we hadn't tried, we were going to tell you before the engagement party, and then we tried to tell you at our house a few days later and then again at your house, but you were so caught up in your own drama to pay attention," She sobbed angrily. "So don't say we never tried, Harry."
"We were just talking to Fred and George in the back," Ron told her, trying to avoid her scolding stare.
He saw a dark purple velvet suit in the corner of his eye that grabbed his attention; he wondered if it would suit him or just look ridiculous.
Draco had a feeling there was a specific reason they had invited Daphne this evening.
~~~~~
The memory changed again, and this time Harry was in Ginny's bedroom, he supposed it must have been Harry's as well; Harry was sitting on the edge of the bed with head in both hands.
"I think I am going to stay at home tonight Harry," Ginny ignored the question and stood up quickly.
"Of course it's too much, I wouldn't expect anything less from you," Harry teased.
After a very long steamy shower--that he definitely needed after the past two days with Harry-- He put on grey plaid trousers and a black long-sleeved turtleneck with a matching grey waistcoat. He checked himself out in the mirror like he usually did to make sure he was presentable and didn't look like a squib.
Draco did have a point Harry thought, but it wasn't that black and white, "Ron could lose his job, and he just got promoted to Head Auror, he has a family."
He lowered his wand and reinserted it back into his robes. "I am only doing what you say cause you're my mate, just make sure he stays away from Theodore."
"Of course, it's like she doesn't trust us, George," Fred said, shaking his head. "It will only be sold to N.E.W.T level students."
"Yep," Harry nodded solemnly. "Here look at this." Harry put his hands on the little brown gate and out from the ground rose a sign with golden letters.
"Isn't he just fantastic?" She beamed at him. "He will make your cafe the best, you have ever seen, and I would love to do a piece on it, if I may?"
"I really think it would be good to get it off your chest," Astoria said encouragingly.
"Robards destroyed them, we don't know if the person made copies, though," Harry said, filling up his glass with the bottle Hermione slid over to him.
Harry turned around and faced Draco Malfoy who was down on one knee.
You're a man now, boy
"He was in the room of requirement Hermione, why else would he have been there if he wasn't plotting something?" Harry argued back.
They lined up at the back wall Harry, Ron and Hermione stood next to Terry Boot who was staring at the bubbling cauldron, of what Harry knew to be Polyjuice.
"Yeah, you must have noticed Harry wasn't exactly outgoing before you came back into his life."
"I know what I am doing, Blaise, just let me sign on the dotted line so I can go on with my day."
Harry shrugged and pulled out his Marauders map, scanning it to find Draco Malfoy. It wasn't hard to find people this time of night they were either in their common rooms or the odd few would wander the corridors looking for a private make-out spot. Harry looked in the Slytherin Common room and paused over Slughorn's office. He had seen Susan Bones and Justin Finch Fletchly together in his office while Slughorn was in there, at least that's what the map had said, but it was most likely they were just handing in their homework, they weren't members of the Slug Club, so they wouldn't have any other reason to be there.
"Yes, I have," Draco replied proudly.
It was getting dark outside when Harry had heard Ron and Hermione come upstairs to find him slumped in his armchair in the drawing room. He smiled when he had seen them as it felt like it had been several weeks or months.
Draco's eyes opened reluctantly, his vision blurred as he tried to focus on who the man was that had lifted him up. It all became clear when he saw the round glasses and the red lightning bolt scar staring at him full of concern and annoyance. "Potter? Why are you in my bedroom?" He groaned.
"Mr Potter, It's good to see you again," Tom said his mouth wide showing yellow, rotting teeth. "What can I get for you?"
Draco wiped his mouth on his napkin and dropped into his empty dessert bowl; His father had just finished his third glass of Firewhisky and his mother her "first" bottle of wine when really it was her third. Blaise and Ginny were now sat together holding hands and kissing, which his mother always hated, as it was poor dinner etiquette.
Harry ignored him again and played with the glass.
"Yes, you are, I won that bet fair and square not my fault you lost control of your broom," Draco snarled. "Come on, shall we go back to bed?" Draco carefully moved Harry's legs off his lap and stood up holding out his hand.
"No chance," Nott said. "You said that the last time."
Ernie Macmillian leaned across the table next to Dean Thomas calling him. "Harry, is it true you and Malfoy got in a fist fight on the train?" he asked with excitement in his eyes.
Luna let out a deep exhale and began telling them how Ginny and Blaise set Harry and Malfoy up with Ernie and Zacharias to hope their dates would make them so miserable that they would be attracted to each other instead.
Harry ignored him.
"I'm sure if you talk to him..." Hermione was saying.
Harry tried as hard as he could to stop himself from smiling. "Have they sent you to be their spokesperson?"
Harry woke up alone in his private hospital room; it was now filled with flowers, get well soon cards and balloons. He saw the daily prophet newspaper on the chair next to him opened up on the crosswords page with a black quill against the fold, he hadn't been alone.
Watching Harry in his pleasure, how his fingers were playing with his nipple gave Draco an idea. He drew back from his lover, gently removing their hands from their cocks. Green eyes drifted open, dazed and confused, as he laid Harry back on the bed.
"I ssssmell food," Morty hissed wriggling himself free.
Draco laughed. "Well, get used to it," He replied, then blushed when he realised what he said. "I mean, shut up, Potter."
"Robards said something didn't he?" Draco asked wanting to know that this wasn't really what Harry thought. "What did he say?"
Harry felt weight leave his body as Draco stepped backwards, grey eyes inspecting him and biting his bottom lip.
Lucius Malfoy was leaving the moment Harry had arrived which couldn't have been a coincidence, and he hoped Draco wasn't involved.
"What for?" Draco asked, mindlessly stirring the cornflakes around his bowl.
"Harry Potter? The fucking chosen one, the hero of the wizarding world, precious fucking Potter?" Draco scoffed.
"You asked me to marry you," Her lips were pursed as though bracing herself for the answer, either way, he cheated on her.
Pansy and Blaise were sat together next to Harry, still in their honeymoon period even after she had been pregnant for nine months and pushed out Lily, Blaise was in total awe of her. Ron and Hermione didn't come this year as they were away in Australia visiting Hermione's parents.
Harry backed entirely away, and the floorboards underneath creaked, they both snapped their heads to the door, faces panicked.
~~~~~~
Draco raised an intrigued eyebrow, taking another bite of his apple feeling impatient. "Yes?"
He pressed his pelvis forwards a bit and swallowed Draco’s moan.
"Why don't I make our dinner, and you go have a rest, I will wake you up when it's ready," Draco suggested kissing Harry again, Harry loved just being able to feel Draco's kisses.
Thirsty, gasping, Draco pulled off a moment, heard Harry make a low, displeased murmur. Draco licked his lips, ran a finger along the ropy vein on the underside of Harry's curving cock, and kissed the crown, lapping it lightly. He kneaded the velvety sac, drawing up between the other man's powerful thighs, and rested his cheek against the narrow curve of Harry's hip.
"I dunno Granger, I just walked through, not hard," He shrugged, wondering why she was bothered about how he got through if he hadn't she probably wouldn't have known to come.
Ron jolted awake and blinked at Malfoy. "Watch it, Malfoy."
"Ok then, thank you," he smiled and left the office.
Lucius put his arm around Narcissa's waist, and they both put on their brightest, fakest smiles for the flashes from the camera's and then Draco joined next to them, smouldering slightly. He could hear his parents muttering insults at each other through their gritted teeth which would be surprising if they didn't do that.
"Yes, Miss Granger?"
"Edwin, Weasley," Draco nodded as he greeted them. "I assume this isn't a social call."
"I have always been fascinated with them; I used to love to go to Borgin and Burkes with my father and imagined having my own little collection like it."
"Sorry," Harry apologised turning on the black kettle. "What are you working on?"
Draco hadn't come to practice the following days, and Harry was getting more worried. On the Friday morning when he got to practice, he decided to ask Cotton where he was.
"Come off it, you did," Draco pushed his empty plate away from him.
"I like Rose fine; she is young, her imagination gets the better of herself sometimes."
Harry was humming to himself in the kitchen; he had just finished cooking the mince for the taco's, it was one of his favourite meals to make, mostly because it was quick and easy, you can't really go wrong with taco's he would tell Draco.
Everyone turned their attention to Lucius. "You knew about this?" Narcissa snapped, narrowing her eyes.
Neville and Seamus nodded together.
Hermione narrowed her eyes on the glass and his feet on the desk. "I take it you have already seen the article this morning then?" She said holding up the prophet.
"I’m Head Girl," she whispered, opening the palm of her hand and revealing the red and gold Head Girl badge.
"Harry, we need to tell you something," Hermione said sitting up and holding Ron's hand in her lap.
"The Ferris Wheel," Harry replied, holding the unicorn awkwardly.
Harry let out a long exhale; he felt like he had been holding his breath the whole journey. They stepped out of the lift and headed to their offices.
“They are impossible to win;  most people just get small consolation prizes,”  Harry warned.
"Nobody likes their job," Draco replied with a smirk. "But we all have to do it."
“It’s an anklet.” Harry studied the silver jewellery with his usual detached curiosity. “I never had an anklet before.”
Harry bit his tongue.
Harry adjusted his round glasses and leaned in closer, squinting as he did.
"Yes, hello Harry, did you not get my note?" He asked, turning his head to look at the bed for the note. "I said I was coming to pick you up."
"Andrews, Peter."
"Blaise, I would like to thank you again for introducing me to Zacharias, I can't tell you how glad I am you convinced me to come," He said with as much forced enthusiasm as he could muster.
Ignoring Harry’s curse of disappointment, Draco urged the brunette onto his hands and knees. Hands on the pale round bottom, he parted the cheeks and licked.
"Of course," Draco said, and they continued to Quality Quidditch Supplies. Teddy hurried ahead and stuck his face in the window to look at the latest Firebolt model; they both let out an amazed gasp.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked sitting back up in his chair.
"Yes it matters, I would like to know when my boyfriend cheated on me," Ginny snapped.
"Ok then, I guess I can give you a second chance," Harry held out his hand, and Draco shook it, both smiling.
A knock at the door broke him from his thoughts, "come in," Harry called.
"Door Knocker?" Mr Weasley gasped amazed.
"What is it, mother? Spit it out," Draco said irritably.
They all sat down in the lightly lit room, Draco pulled down the glasses that were still on the top of his head. Pansy and Blaise sat hand in hand looking at him excitedly.
"How are you dear?" Mrs Weasley asked, squeezing him hard.
"Fine," Draco agreed. "Good day Minister," Draco bowed his head and left the Ministers office almost knocking into Jane Honeywell.
"Fine," Harry frowned and folded his arms.
"But why?" Harry asked. "Why didn't you just ask me?"
"Ok, what is it?"
"Well, it is suspicious," Harry replied, folding his arms and frowning.
"Nonsense," she said blushing slightly, and hugging him again; Draco watched on in envy.
Draco stood on the platform in front of the Scarlet train, getting attacked with kisses from his Mother; she had come to see him off with his Aunt Andromeda and Teddy. Draco was really going to miss Teddy; he had been on early morning bottle feeds most of the summer on the day's Teddy wasn't with Potter. Teddy was actually a really good alarm clock for him when he needed to get up and go to Hogwarts to serve his probation of help fixing the school. There were a lot of volunteers that had been helping to and some that had been forced to by the Wizengamot.
Blaise smiled his million-dollar smile at her and Harry felt the love and connection they shared together, and it made the knot in his stomach tighten as the feeling of resentment he would often feel for them both after a few drinks appeared and he found himself balling his hands into fists.
He caught his father's reflection in the glass, he turned around to the doorway where he was stood with his arms folded his long white hair loose around his shoulders, his grey eyes observed him curiously.
"And that's when you decided to buy a Quidditch team?"
"No," Harry scoffed.
"And what is your new plan?"
Draco snorted amused at the question. "Raise me correctly? Whatever you said went in this house, there was no room for my own thoughts on how I was being raised."
"Yeah, how did you know?" Ron asked.
"It's not... I mean you... It's fine," Harry was nervous and hated that Draco had always made him nervous.
"Will you come to the bank with me tomorrow? You know just in case?" Malfoy asked in a tone that said he really did need his help but didn't want to ask for it.
Two days ago, he had to make a decision that would affect him and someone he really cared about; it was either end what he was doing with Draco or have Draco's secret released to the papers and outed to his parents. As much as Harry didn't want to be outed himself, he knew things would be worse for Draco, so he made the regretful decision and broke it off with Draco. He knew it would be hard, but he hadn't realised it was going to be that hard.
The Goblin handed Harry £49.79 while Malfoy put the remainder of the gold in his pocket.  "Thanks,"  He muttered to Harry.
She stopped inspecting him pursing her lips in a thin line and slowly nodded. "You spend so much time at their house; it feels as though I never see you anymore."
After having so many years of living with the Dursleys and them ignoring his birthday and then having friends who would celebrate with him, he wished this year they would forget, and he could spend the whole of Sunday in bed with a bottle of Firewhisky. Then again, he might still take up Draco's offer to run away with him, though they hadn't discussed it since and they didn't know what the outcome of Lucius Malfoy's fire calls was.
"I need you to promise me you will stop drinking, I can see more of your father in you every day," She rasped. "And you are not your father."
Draco raised his glass, "To things in common?"
"Good," Is all Harry could reply.
"I promise you, Harry. If I didn't think it would work, I wouldn't have suggested it. But I believe it will, and I need you to help me make it succeed. As your Head of House, I have watched you return year after year with that same sense of returning home written on your face. Hogwarts is your home. Wouldn't you like to return to it, one last time?"
Draco smirked and walked up the steps to the double doors at the front of the Manor. "Alohamora," he muttered, and with a click, the doors unlocked and swung open.
"Not that it is any of your business, but Potter and I were tying up loose ends in our case." Draco lied hoping to sound convincing.
"Do what?" He replied and stopped doing it.
Harry had a feeling he knew why but didn't think it was something everyone else needed to know. "He must just really like chocolate frogs," Harry shrugged and stared at the space where Malfoy had stood.
"What Ginny is trying to say is you are both kind of loners, and we thought we could help you out," Blaise said bluntly.
Harry ripped up the letter angrily and threw it in his desk drawer. Draco was going to The three broomsticks, and he didn't even tell Harry about it? Why should he? Harry thought it's not like they were dating or anything they were friends who had kissed and met up in secret, but not in a relationship. He exhaled and then opened the letter of Draco.
"No bother, No bother, I heard you went home yesterday, and I wanted to see how you were doing?"
"I would make him pay," Draco said through gritted teeth. "I would make him regret ever uttering those words."
Robards loosened his collar and shifted uncomfortably in his seat. "Potter, I.."
Rolling off the sofa and onto the floor, they panted and breathed hard once more.
"It took Harry and me nearly an hour to get her to sleep," Draco went on.
"Seize the day."
"You sure?" Draco asked softly, caressing his hand. "You would tell me if there is?"
Shadow was waiting for him when he got into the kitchen she had brought him the daily prophet, this was the one he had been waiting for, the announcement of Appleby Arrows new Quidditch team. He took it eagerly from her and went to flick to the sports pages but had stopped when he saw it was front page news.
"So you're saying we can't be friendly or seen with each other ever again?" Harry said, his face turning angry, Draco was feeling it too but had more self-control.
"Level two, Department of magical law enforcement...."
He heard her reply something about him not looking like he has eaten in weeks, she frowned and went back to her own plate.
"He offered me back the position of Head Auror, and Ron has to do to a four-week retraining," Harry replied. "And then I told him I can't be Head Auror and I would like to give my four weeks notice."
"No, that's not what I meant, I am just saying; the Weasleys are too proud to accept gifts or things of value from others."
"He can't undersssstand me anyway; I'm sssssstuck talking to you."
Draco scoffed and turned his back on them to face the cake again. It was too difficult to watch. He heard a gasp and then a moan. He squeezed his eyes shut trying to focus on the music playing; why did it have to be Celestina Warbeck?
She walked into the room with Blaise, and they sat down next to Ron on the couch.
"Cause he can't handle losing."
They apparated to the same spot in Godric's Hollow, as they did the other day and walked through the small wooden gate to the front door.
"Have you come for round two?" Lucius said wearily.
"And, what?
“Shit,” Draco cried out, tensing beneath Harry while the head of Harry’s cock breached centimetres into his arse. “Fuck, fuck.”
Saturday, 16th July 2005
"I thought you said you were done being petty?" Harry frowned.
"I didn't go," Harry replied.
"We need to get those photographs off him before we report him," Draco told him. "If he hands those in I could get sent to Azkaban, and that's precisely what he wants."
Harry sighed and went to his desk feeling resigned. He went through the piles of paperwork on his desk that he was behind on and rubbed his forehead out of stress.
"Am I not allowed to sit in Hagrid's chair?" Draco asked the little boy who was staring him down.
As Harry walked down the corridor towards Robards office door, he froze when he saw the long white-blonde hair of Lucius Malfoy coming out of the door.
"Well, don't laugh at me, anyway, I got Dudley's second bedroom after my Uncle saw my Hogwarts..."
"I'd like to see you try, Potter," Draco replied, tilting his head back, so it rested against Harry's stomach. "You haven't got the balls to arrest me."
He paused and thought about the question before replying, "My husband's side."
"I am reading the second one now," Draco smiled eagerly pulling out a book from his bag.
"You look nice," Hermione said, trying to sound normal again. "I am sure you will win the best male dressed this year."
"Good evening," She began and became stern once more. "Welcome back those who have returned this year and welcome first years who have just joined us. Those of you who have returned will have noticed a few changes, one of those is that there is an additional table, for the students who never finish their seventh year, or begin their seventh year due to being in hiding from He who must not be named."
"When was the last time you rode your broom?" Draco asked, brushing off the dust and cobwebs from the handle.
He sat in the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee and reading the daily prophet, his eagle owl; Shadow had brought him. He studied it carefully looking for anything slightly significant, but it was mostly the boring rubbish the prophet published. There was, however, a small bit about Appleby Arrows try-outs today that Harry was excited about, still no mention of the new manager though.
He shook the idea out of his head and nodded. "Thank you; I will be just in the office."
"I really wish I could read your mind," Draco said, disturbing Harry's reverie.
Harry was running down the stairs, out of the kitchen and out the door to the garden. He stopped and bent over heaving to catch his breath and possibly to throw up.
"You too, Professor," Harry replied, returning the smile.
"Women trouble?" Louis winked.
Pansy giggled and sat back on Millicent's lap. "Millie doesn't get jealous."
Fred and George looked at each other as though they were silently communicating and then nodded. "Fred had kissed Angelina Johnson that day and was trying to remember all the details; poor bloke just wants to relive one of his favourite days, are you going to deny him of his happiness, Harry?" George said shaking his head solemnly.
"We ate earlier this morning, a lot to do today," she replied, trying to keep her cool as house elves weren't doing as she had commanded. "Where were you?" She asked, looking him up and down.
"You are late, again," Astoria said looking him up and down.
"Not bad Mr Malfoy," He told himself as he smouldered and ran a hand through his hair.
"You miss it don't you?" He found himself asking as he was now watching Harry get more impatient and tense.
"Not for me, it's not, I don't want people to think I want the attention."
"New Uncle Harry is so much more fun," Hugo jumped up happily.
"She is trying to find a rule against Slughorns assignment," Ron told him, shaking his head and rolling his eyes. "I keep telling her he has been doing it for years."
Harry simply repeated Draco's kiss back to him. For a long time, there were no words.
"Seriously? I literally saw you naked last night," Draco smirked, but Harry still didn't move. "Fine," He closed his eyes and put both hands over his face like a child playing hide and seek.
"What would you like to say, Mr Potter?" Kingsley asked, after Harry had stood there in silence, trying to keep it together.
Draco grabbed hold of Harry's hand. "I promise you."
The length of Harry’s cock protruded in a tight bulge behind those trousers; it strained to be free, pushed hard against Draco’s ass. Harry groped for Draco’s hands and squeezed them. He lifted them back and slapped them against the wall. The shock of it stung Draco’s palms. He could feel the reverberation of the slap travel into his forearms, his elbows, ride high into his shoulders where Harry’s forehead lay pressed against him.
“I have a new wand now,” Draco said, uninterested.
"Worry not Draco; the cake is hidden behind the stage curtain, I didn't want it to get ruined, I could see that Weasley boy with the missing ear, eyeing it up." Her voice was calm which drove Draco crazy why was everyone always so fucking calm.
"I would say so yes, I always have thought of him as a son," Mr Weasley admitted. "Why do you ask?"
Draco pursed his lips and knocked his elbow into Harry's. "Alright, smarty pants."
"Oh, aren't we?" Harry answered.
"Smith," Malfoy said with a look of disappointment and Harry saw his pale cheeks go a slight pink.
There was an agreed murmur this time, as well as many nodding heads, which surprised Harry.
"You know, when I lost my memory I asked myself the same thing, It was a question I still don't 100% understand, but I know it's something I want to do." Harry felt Draco's hand in his. "I also recommended Ron as my replacement, which he accepted after Ron has completed his four-week retraining programme."
"Too much," Ron smiled for a moment then his face turned serious. "Look, Harry, I don't know how much you know about what's going on at the Ministry, but I have been filling in temporarily for you, so you don't need to rush back or anything."
"Who will you be attending the Masquerade Ball with?" A young female witch asked blushing at him.
"I will have a firewhisky," Harry decided now with a defiant look.
Ron Weasley's desk was empty when he arrived at the Auror department. There was an older lady sat outside Potter's office reading the daily prophet.
Hermione Granger rushed into the room with three other nurses, her bushy hair rounded the bed as she checked Astoria and confirmed to him that she had indeed passed away, he slumped backwards into the chair in as though she had taken a club and swung it right into his stomach. He head muffled voices around him as he stared at Astoria's body, his head nodded on its own accord to the questions he was being asked but didn't comprehend them.
Harry nodded. "Okay, I think I can do that."
"Do you not remember the mail Hermione got sent after Rita Skeeter said she was cheating on me with Victor Krum, even Mrs Weasley treated her differently."
"Hello, Harry," She muttered as their eyes met. "So nice to finally meet you in person, my name is Clara Bennett, I was in my final year at Hogwarts when you started." She said answering Harry's unspoken question.
"Three days ago you and Ron were out chasing after Theodore Nott, you got hit and badly hurt we didn't know what spell had been cast until, well...now. Harry, you have lost 15 years of your memory."
"Shut up, Potter."
"Yeah, Ron said he see's you there."
"Yes, well, a bottle to you and a bottle to everyone else is a lot different," Draco snarled feeling his stomach grumble.
"I would like to see Mister Zabini, please," Draco replied cautiously flexing his hands.
Draco walked out of The Manor fireplace as quietly as possible. It was a little after one in the morning, and his Parents were usually asleep by now, and even though they would probably have not heard him, given the size of The Manor; the act of sneaking home in the middle of the night, after not telling them where he had been for the past few nights seemed like an appropriate thing to do. It seemed silly considering he had turned 25 last month and had been of age and free to do what he liked without his parent's permission for years.
"Yes, when I am ready, I will tell you," Harry replied and kissed the nape of his neck.
"You know who the author is?" Harry asked stunned. "No one knows who the author is."
That wasn't the problem he wanted to say and kicked himself for letting all these thoughts come to the surface; he had done so well to keep them away. "How considerate," he sneered instead and rolled his eyes as an added extra. "Will you let me think about it?"
"Draco have you had anything to eat?" Molly asked examining him thoroughly.
"I can't promise anything," Draco replied, and Harry gave him a  'don't you dare look' "Okay fine, I won't hurt Ron."
"What was the fallout about, Harry?" Pansy turned her head to him, and he gulped.
"Well, if you are so confident that you will beat me on..... that, then I suppose you will have to earn your freedom."
"Yes, what?" Draco spoke with dominance now.
"Malfoy," He said, returning the nod and then looking him up and down. He was wearing a velvet suit similar to the one Harry was holding in his now clammy hands, but he was in black. His white-blonde hair was how he had last remembered it to be, and his face as pale and pointed as ever, so why did Harry feel his heart thumping hard in his chest?
Harry stood up. "I was protecting you."
“I heard them talking about it at the drinks table at Neville's engagement party; they were annoyed because you hadn’t given them a chance to tell you yet.”
"Are they writing about you again?" Harry asked leaning his back against the kitchen surface holding a freshly made cup of coffee.
"So Nott, what is your deal?" Draco said to real Harry.
"Thank you," Draco said to the old lady, and then smirked in Harry's direction, "And I don't need you to speak for me, Potter," He snarled squeezing his cock.
Draco shrugged and scooped a spoonful of custard off his bread and butter pudding, his favourite dessert.
They all sat the table with a steaming cup of coffee; there was an uncomfortable silence.
The first thing Harry noticed was the smirk on Draco's face, he was dressed as perfect as ever and looked like his normal happy self, he didn't look like he had lost Harry. Maybe he didn't care that much about him to begin with.
Draco let go of his hand and stood up. "Right well I better go home before work," He announced stretching tiredly.
"He works outside the office most of the time; he is more of an independent agent, dad says," Ron replied then added. "He is usually there first thing in the morning to hand in his reports and get his assignments, then leaves."
Harry shrugged. "God knows, I assume someone has seen me talking to  a woman and come to the conclusion we are dating."
"A chicken?" Draco guessed again.
Draco rolled onto his back, staring up at the ceiling, he hadn’t imagined it would feel that incredible.
Harry arrived home in a bad mood, he was looking forward to playing Quidditch again, but as usual, Draco Malfoy has to ruin everything. Harry slammed the front door shut, and threw his broom in the cupboard under the stairs. He paused as he heard low voices in the kitchen, it was Ron, Hermione and Ginny. He let out a deep sigh, he just wanted to relax after a long stressful day, and now he has to entertain his two best friends and Ginny.
"I suppose," Harry shrugged. "Not like I have anything to lose, is it."
"I'm sorry but I can't," Draco said standing up, "Blaise, what were you thinking?"
"Let go of me," Draco snarled at Harry. "I am not going to do anything; he isn't worth it."
He entered the sitting room where she was sat by herself flicking through today's daily prophet. She looked different; she had cut her hair into a bob and was wearing makeup she hardly ever wore makeup. She smiled nervously at him as he sat down in the armchair. "You look good," Harry said.
“I want to try again,”  He demanded, pulling out the pouch again and handing the man another pound coin.
"Just a tuna sandwich for me, thanks," Harry said, scanning the menu quickly. "And a bottle of cold butterbeer."
Draco stepped back opening the door wider to let them walk inside. "Have a good look around Weasley; I am sure Robards is confident you will find something to incriminate me."
The boy shook his head again and looked at him confused. "What is a festarial?" He asked not be being able to say it correctly.
"Maybe they wanted to boost their profile?" George said smirking as well.
When he got to Mr Weasley's office, Malfoy sat in one of the two chairs in front of the desk; he looked just as confused as Harry did which made him feel slightly at ease.
"It was a last minute decision," Harry replied confidently, not wanting to feel intimidated by Mr Malfoy.
"How many measures was that?" Malfoy asked, looking at his book.
He watched as Potter thought it through before finally saying. "Yes, alright, fine."
"I said I need you to make sure you have brought your suit and mask today, and if you can pick up those cases of wine and Firewhisky from The Leaky Cauldron, I would much appreciate it."
Draco wanted to so desperately to say no, he wanted to obliviate Harry and make him forget the whole thing, but he had to fight for Harry, it felt like all he ever did was fight for Harry to believe in him. He bowed his head and then slowly nodded. "Ok, I will show you."
"Nonsense Draco, everyone wants you to succeed in whatever you do, your father was worried about you in that P.I job he said you seemed miserable in it." His Mother smiled warmly.
"Shut up and fuck me," Harry moaned, closing his eyes at the sensations on his neck.
Draco drew his fingers from Harry and complied, slouching down in the hot seat and sliding his arse towards the edge, so his cock passed between Harry’s legs.
"Why not? It was the only reason I agreed to go all the way to Hogsmeade with Blaise," Draco made a wider circle and then started doing little tricks.
Draco convulsed, making the last few thrusts, as the orgasm drained from him. He collapsed on his brunette lover, both of them falling over onto their sides, gasping hard as they tried to catch their breath. Beneath him, Harry was completely limp, eyes closed in post-coital bliss.
The end of the day couldn't have come sooner when Cotton had told them to go hit the showers. Harry was relieved and was the first one off his broom. He sped across the pitch and under the tunnel into the changing rooms, on his way he saw Draco's office, the door was slightly ajar, so he glanced inside.
Draco couldn't understand why Harry was acting like this; what had brought this on all of a sudden?
"Saw you on the front page this morning mate, nice picture." Jimmy grinned broadly.
He heard Harry groan again. "I went to that party with you," He protested.
"I didn't invite Astoria," Draco replied, crossing his arms. The last time he had spoken to her was after she had shoved her tongue down his throat.
Draco was walking away from the drinks table and saw Robards whispering into Harry's ear, he could tell by Harry's face; it wasn't a pleasant conversation. A few seconds later Robards walked strode away, Draco carried on towards Harry, grabbing Hermione on the way, who surprisingly went along with him.
"Did you see the reporters this morning?" Harry asked after a few awkward moments.
They turned and moved into the spooning position; Harry kept up a steady rhythm as he bit and sucked on Draco's neck. Draco tugged and pulled at his own cock feeling overwhelmed with passion and enjoyment. Harry touched every part of Draco that he could, his chest, torso, biceps, hands, legs and arse.
Today was a good day though; Harry reminded himself for the third time that morning. Today Harry would be trying out for a professional Quidditch team, Appleby Arrows. He had heard the team had just come under new management and the new owner wanted a fresh team that will match up to his standards, he had no idea who the new manager was, he assumed it would be an ex-manager from another team, but it was all very hushed up.
"Because it's illegal and we weren't exactly at a secret telling stage in our relationship when I took it," Draco replied rolling his eyes. "That's about the whole of it."
"Perfectly safe, here, take my hand," Harry held out his hand to him, he took it and instantly felt safe.
"Probably," Draco laughed.
Harry looked at the coffee table that was in front of the black leather sofa; there were many brown leather books piled together.
"Fuck," Draco shouted exasperated. He was on top of a hill somewhere up north, near Lake Windermere, he had tracked Theodore Nott there, but he just managed to miss him, "Where are you, fucker?" He held the gold device in hand tightly twisting, turning and pressing things. It was hard to pinpoint a person you are tracking when you have so little to go off.
"Why do you want to leave with me?"
"Gin," Harry broke off.
"Be quiet Arthur, tell me what is going on with you both," Mrs Weasley demanded. "Don't think I haven't noticed something going on."
"Why's that?" Andromeda asked, taking Teddy out for the stroller.
The drawer had seemed tiny when he had looked in it, but Draco was practically diving inside of it, large things were getting flown across the room, a black leather briefcase almost hit Harry's head.  A few moments later Draco came up with a pleased face holding a gold device that had multiple coloured knobs and buttons.
Hermione and Ron had been speaking in whispers now and then while Harry had been thinking about his...date? With Malfoy tomorrow. He was confused about the whole situation.
"Please don't cry," Harry said softly.
The time had come for the big cake reveal, and Draco's palms were sweating as he flexed them open and close. Hermione had gathered everyone around the stage when Draco had given the signal.
Draco's hand flexed quicker this time. "I am not sure; you will have to ask him that one," He replied with a forced laugh.
"What do you think Ron?" Harry asked to get a second opinion and noticed Ron hadn't added his input; he had been sitting on the floor in front of the sofa, doodling on the back of his Defence Against the Dark Arts book.
Harry looked Draco in the eyes, completely head over heels. "To things in common?"
"Who is it from?" Draco asked taking it hesitantly from his father.
"If this is about me, I can't stand in your way; I thought you wanted to be Head Auror?"
It took several minutes for the potion to kick in, and when it finally did, he picked himself off the bed and headed to the bathroom for a long warm shower. He closed his eyes, letting the water wash down his face, flashes of the night before filling his head. Harry in his purple velvet suit, his green eyes, the smile that showed his teeth, hearing his laugh, clinking glasses, kissing in his kitchen.
"No, you need to rest," Draco ordered.
"Only in a note this afternoon, he was returning the suit I lent him for Blaise's house party, why is something wrong with him?" Draco began to panic.
"You're in today then?" Ron finally said a little more reserved than he usually was.
"We do talk."
"There's nothing to tell, we just realised we weren't compatible anymore," Harry said feeling guilty for lying to his best friends.
They opened the piece of paper with their new room assignments, and each let out a groan.
He was well aware of Ron's mood swings and would typically just let it slide, but he was just not ready to let it go yet. "Take your potion, and put on silencing charms," Harry said flatly and rolled over, so his back was to Ron.
********
"Now, as you should all be aware, The Forbidden Forest is strictly off limits to all students. Mr Filch has asked me to remind you that Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products are not allowed and if I catch anyone using products from the skiving snack boxes you will be receiving a week's worth of detentions. Which brings me onto my next point, the first Hogsmeade visit will be October 17th, those in the third year and above make sure you have your permission form signed and handed to your head of house before then. Finally, Quidditch trials will begin at the end of next week, so if you are in the second year and above and would like to try out, please speak to your Head of House. Now it's time for bed if the prefects will escort their houses to their respective common rooms and Eighth Years remain seated. Goodnight."
They were in Lucius's study the only place he finds peace nowadays after his wife decided to be friendly with all types of witches and had book clubs, cooking nights and some kind of get help group. The study always reminded Draco of when he was a child before Hogwarts; he would pretend to read books so he could listen in on his father's meetings, sometimes he just wanted to feel close to him.
"I know Harry just told me," Blaise replied, wiping the crumbs from the corner of his mouth with his finger.
"Please, can everyone take their seats, so we can begin," The same voice called again.
"Worry not Draco; the cake is hidden behind the stage curtain, I didn't want it to get ruined, I could see that Weasley boy with the missing ear, eyeing it up." Her voice was calm which drove Draco crazy why was everyone always so fucking calm.
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco hissed as he saw him go down.
He leaned into Harry, "I don't think your plan is working, do you?" Draco whispered.
"Just come on, you know your mother won't be in a room with me without you there," Astoria grabbed his arms forcefully pulling him towards their dining room.
"Do you maybe want to go with me tomorrow?" Malfoy asked so quietly Harry hardly heard him.
"C' mon mate you know I had to follow orders," Ron said dropping his arms and walking towards Harry. "We didn't find anything, but you know Edwin he is very good at finding things and he could sense something was there."
"Is this it?" Ginny said quietly.
"More," Harry begged as Draco slowly pulled halfway out. "I need more."
Harry re-read the resignation letter multiple times, what was he doing throwing away his career? Was this something he wanted? He wished he had his memories so he could understand what was going through his head at the time. He stared at the words start a family and then to the photograph of him and Draco dancing together on there wedding day, that was almost blocked but the stacks of paper on the desk. "What do you mean, Harry?" He asked himself out loud. "This is 15 years of hard work down the drain."
"Only by a few, nothing I can't handle, I haven't commented on anything, I didn't know whether you wanted me to play along or not?" She smiled closing the gap between them.
"Yes," They both said together.
"Thank you," He smiled. "Look I just want to let you know I am sorry about my behaviour last year, I know we haven't really addressed what happened, and I don't really want to go in depth..."
"Okay, I will probably never have to see Malfoy until the wedding, now can we drop Malfoy, altogether?"
Draco grinned smugly and kissed his cheek tenderly. “I think the anklet is a very good idea.”
His eyes shot open, how had he only just remembered he had kissed Harry fucking Potter, he was incredulous at the new information.
“Is this what you want, Harry?” he growled hoarsely.
"Yeah, I mean feel free to say no,"
"Since getting sent to Azkaban? No." Narcissa’s tone was harsh. "I am hoping this time away from him will help Draco come into his own; the rebuilding of the school seems to be helping."
"Good morning, Mr Potter, what are you doing all the way down here?" Robards said in a false happy tone.
"Ginny, were you going to announce something?" Blaise's voice boomed again.
"As you can see it's a terrible job," Draco said knocking Harry's confidence.
"Yes," Harry replied looking slightly disappointed.
"No father, I am just asking for your advice to sneak into the holding cells," Draco replied with bored irritation leaning against the roaring fireplace staring at his father who was sat on his throne chair at the head of a long table.
~~~~~~~~
"Ok, I will give you a chance," Harry said moments later.
"Harry could be the father too," Narcissa corrected.
The old witch looked at Harry taken aback, and all eyes around the table were resting on him, maybe he should have kept his mouth shut, he thought.
"It doesn't matter how I found out; it matters that you didn't trust me enough to tell me the truth," Draco snapped sounding more like himself.
"Oh Lucius, you're home," Narcissa strode towards her husband and kissed his cheek.
"Appleby Arrows and Falmouth Falcons."
Harry turned to look at Draco, blinking when he saw the smouldering desire in the grey eyes. He looked back at the anklet and his bent leg, and he smirked. “Or just how I have to look at it?”
Malfoy Manor had a mournful atmosphere about it as Draco Malfoy was drunk again sat down against the wall in his bedroom. One leg lay flat while the other was against his chest there was a glass of wine which was slack in his hand. He had been like this for a few hours; the only company has had was by one of the house elves who came back every so often to bring him a new bottle at his request. "Juno is worried about master Draco, Juno thinks master Draco should stop drinking," the house elf would say when she saw him, but he would tell her to mind her own business and do as she is told.
"Yeah, I have been a bit awol on you haven't I?" He frowned apologetically.
"No, you said lies, lies and more lies, why did you say that?" Draco's tone wasn't angry; it was startled like he hadn't expected it.
Harry bit his lip, he didn't know if he should tell Kinglsey about the blackmail and the photographs, but he thought maybe this is the only chance he will be able to get rid of Robards.
"No, you were just somewhere else; where did you go?" Malfoy asked quietly.
He walked across the kitchen to the corner where there was a large fireplace and a dark wooden dining table that could seat all of the Weasley’s plus extra. On the shelf above the fireplace, he took down the box of mice he had brought home and chucked one at Morty who caught it quickly.
"Are you sure, I am happy to help?" Harry wasn't the best cook, but maybe the part of him that was storing repressed memories could help.
"To Harry," everyone sang.
"You can't blame a guy for trying," He smiled.
"It looks busier in there than usual, should we maybe split up?" Ron asked, hoping to be split up from his Mum and sister.
Hermione frowned, not liking where this was going. "Go on."
Draco walked up to the main desk where a Goblin stood writing with his quill.
Draco caressed Harry's face and looked deeply into his eyes regretting what he had to say next.
"Good evening, Mr Potter," She greeted him kindly as he led her downstairs into the kitchen, where Ron and Hermione were playing chess. "Good evening Miss Granger, Mr Weasley."
Harry didn't hear the rest of the sentence; he was already inside his office and running to his desk. The tray with the missing Death Eaters files was empty.
Harry and Draco shared one last kiss before Harry trailed upstairs to bed.
He could see Draco was processing what he had said and trying to find a flaw in it but eventually just smiled.
"I was just dropping off your suit," Draco replied, stepping into the room and slipping into the closest armchair.
Harry groaned again. "If I say no, will you stay?"
Harry leaned over and kissed him softly on the lips. "I can't ask you to return it; just don't mention my name when Mrs Weasley comes to kill you."
"Anyway, enough about our sad failing relationships, I haven't told you the reason I asked you here."
He saw his mother in the corner talking to the DJ; He marched up to her with purpose.
There were 77 differences that he could see between real Harry and fake Harry he could tell pretty much straight away which one was which he wasn't an idiot he had been staring at Harry since they met, he knew how Harry wore his hair, his facial expressions and his mannerisms.
"The first years look a lot bigger compared to Flitwick," Ron whispered, with a snigger.
Draco slowly stopped shaking, and his sobbing came to an end as he rolled over and looked up. “Potter?”
"How very considerate of you," Theo replied sarcastically. "But you are distracting me, so sod off."
Harry stood up. "Mr Weasley, come in, take a seat, I was not expecting you."
"Harry was blackmailed into staying away from you," Hermione said quickly as if it would do less damage.
Now Harry thought about it; it had been a while; it was something he had heard a lot recently. It wasn't like he was trying to avoid his friends; he was just so busy with work. "I know, I'm sorry," He replied gloomily. "We will have to have a guys night soon; we haven't had one of those since I don't even remember."
17th September 2001
Draco almost let out a laugh. "You want me to teach..?" He paused, searching his face for a sign of the punchline of the joke. Potter was looking down at his feet; his hands closed into tight fists. "Why?"
"Harry, might I have a word with you in private?" Mr Weasley asked.
"Is everything okay, Mr Potter?" Narcissa Malfoy asked, looking slightly concerned as Harry felt his cheeks redden.
He followed him through the hallway, where they had once stood against the staircase up close together. They had entered the front room and found Ginny curled up on the sofa asleep with a blanket hanging off her and mostly on the floor. She looked angry as she slept, her forehead creased and her brows furrowed.
Their faces weren't convinced. "Right, well go get your clothes and come with us, mum is cooking us a light dinner before we go," Ginny said waving him out of the room.
"Well, you can't make me," Harry said and folded his arm like a stubborn child.
"Shall we sit?" Hermione pointed to the table.
"Okay then," He agreed nonchalantly, but on the inside, he was jumping up and down with joy. "We should probably cancel our order then."
He didn’t care, couldn’t care. Not right now.—He grabbed the man’s hand instead. He led the way to his bed, bypassing the pile of dirty clothes. And when they got there, he pushed Draco in front of him, let him stumble backwards unaccompanied onto his bed. He knelt at the foot of it, not bothering with the pleasantries of head teasing or mouth stretching.
He picked it up off the hanger and held it up to himself and looked in the mirror, it wasn't terrible he thought, but could he pull it off?
"Is that your only response, a shrug?" His father always got irritated when Draco ignored him.
He pulled quickly away and took a step back expecting to be punched in the face, but instead Malfoy was now kissing him.
They walked side by side to the big wheel, they paid and got in a wobbly, box with a bench that had room for both of them. It shook and wobbled as Draco put his foot on after Harry had sat down. "Are you sure this is safe?" He asked nervously.
"This time last year," Draco continued. "I had met Harry for the first time since we had left school and we had been set up by our two friends Blaise and Ginny with the worst dates imaginable, no offence Ernie and Zacharias. Their plan had actually worked, and Harry and I had a weird connection that seemed to keep drawing us back to each other. Don't get me wrong there were a lot of lying and arguments, but last month on my birthday Harry got down on one knee and asked me to marry him."
"No, he was invited, he helped Neville get rid of a few dangerous artefacts last year, and they actually kept in contact."
"Well it came from the Minister, Kingsley himself, he says its urgent." Draco handed Harry the note and sat carefully on the edge of the bed.
"Not everything," Draco said. "I need to go have it out with my father."
Harry nodded. "Yeah, everything's great."
Footsteps approached somewhere behind, gripping his wand tightly he raised it in the direction of the noise.
"Well it will have to be quick, I need to pick Rose and Hugo up from Molly's soon, and Fred and George is there, and we both know how responsible they are," Hermione frowned as she sat hastily down followed by Ron.
Harry's cheeks went red, and he nodded his acceptance as he threw the powder down. "The Burrow."
He had however been curious to know why his father was in the ministry on Friday and was trying to work out the best approach to ask him.
“Draco…?” came the soft voice.
"Then why did you?"
"No comment," He replied, beginning to walk again.
"That is where you are wrong, Potter, I have to do this."
"Yes, father," Draco confirmed.
"Yes, I do," Draco replied in a bored tone now, it sounded like he had been having this conversation all week.
When she tried to argue, Ron muttered, "just drop it, Mione."
"A bit early to be thinking about Christmas isn't it? I am pretty sure its valentines day today."
Draco hesitantly lowered his wand not breaking eye contact with his father, breathing rapidly. "I will do it without your help."
"He has been like this for three days; I hardly think it will change today."
They all stepped into the office. The three men stood behind the desk arms folded at Draco and Harry, who were both as confused as each other.
"I am working with Malfoy, no big deal," Harry shouted defensively, then blushed when he realised how he had acted. "Sorry."
Ron, a little less tense, walked back in about ten minutes later dressed in his Chudley Canon pyjamas; he got into bed and rolled over to face Harry. "Sorry, mate."
Harry exhaled sharply. "Fuck," He whispered so quietly it was only heard by Draco, who smiled pleased with himself.
"Don't take this the wrong way Harry," Hermione said with a look of hesitation on her face. "We were all starting to worry about you. You stopped showing up after your birthday, I know we aren't supposed to talk about it, but you were going through big life changes no-one blames you, but you disappeared for three weeks after that, and you didn't even tell Ron or me where you were."
"Draco," Hermione said in a soft voice "Harry, will have subconscious memories stored in his head, it doesn't mean he remembers."
~~..~~~..~~
"Come on, you know I love those the most," He replied enjoying the look on Harry's face.
"Goodbye," the kids sang as they floo out of the fireplace leaving Harry and Draco in a disturbed silence.
Harry laughed. "Awol, not awally, you wally; what I am trying to say is I have been a selfish Godfather."
Harry Potter.
Flashes of movement and images went through Harry's head; he was lying on the floor clutching both hands tightly against his head. Moments after moments swarm through his brain and it hurt.
"We will see," Draco frowned. "Anyway, I better get back to, well, to Harry."
"You didn't know?" She frowned guiltily now. "She has a Blood Malediction."
There were a lot more people gathered outside the cafe in Diagon Alley than Draco had expected when he and Harry had arrived. There were photographers and reporters also shouting questions as usual and flashing their cameras. There was a red ribbon ready in front of the cafe doors; He assumed Blaise and Ginny had put it there earlier, they, unfortunately, couldn't be at the opening as they had to go to work.
"My history?" Harry asked curiously.
"Right, well Mr Malfoy if you go back into your dressing room, I will go find that material for the collar, Mr Potter you can go try that suit on in that dressing room," she pointed to the empty dressing room next Malfoy and hurried to the back of the shop.
He wiped the sleep out from his eyes as he focused on what the letter said.
"She was a Muggle, and even she judged us for being friends." Draco frowned. "What will everyone else say?"
“Draco…?”
Draco stared at him, open-mouthed. “Sort of, like, ‘don’t forget the lube,’ I think we’re okay.”
"You are definitely starting to show," Ginny said, rubbing Hermione's belly over her dress.
"To Lily," Everyone called raising their glass, and Lily began to cry.
The stone in the kitchen was cold beneath his feet when he stepped inside to make himself a cup of tea. The sun was shining brightly through the slightly open curtains above the sink, which made him squint uncomfortably.
"Mate, what did he do?" Ron asked encouragingly.
"Shut up, Potter I love you," Draco mumbled, pulling Harry's cock harder.
"Don't lie, Harry, I read the letter remember," Ginny cried.
"He demoted you?" Draco's temper rose again "He can't do that, It's not your fault."
Harry shook his head. "Unfortunately not," He sighed.
"Fine," Harry sulked taking it and stood up feeling a lot better than before.
“A couple of hours. Enough time for a nap, I see.”
"Why would they put us together after everything you and your family did?" It came out more aggressive than Harry realised.
After being greeted and hugged by all the Weasley’s minus Percy and Charlie, they all sat down at the table, helping themselves to the spread; Harry didn't fancy much, so he took a couple of bread rolls and spread them generously with butter. He observed Ginny and Blaise as they whispered and giggled together; it was never like that when they were together, it felt more platonic. Hermione was sitting next to Ron who was in a deep conversation, which he tried to listen to but it seemed like one of them had cast the muffliato charm so no-one could listen in.
Harry, Draco and Ron stood in Kinglsey Shacklebolts office the next day, Kinglsey's head was in his hands he hadn't said anything for a few minutes since Ron had told him the full story of what really happened in the woods. He had told him that it was an accident and that he wanted to tell the truth but was too scared to, and realised it had been a mistake.
Draco stood up. "I will let you get on with those, I um have work to be getting on with, I am fairly behind."
“But,” Malfoy began, but Harry grabbed hold of his sleeve and dragged him away from the booth. “I almost got one.”
Morty swallowed the mice and wrapped himself around the tree, pleased with himself, "Thanksss."
His head was hurting, and the knowledge that he had just lost 15 years of his life didn't help. He picked up the newspaper and flattened it on the first page.
Hermione stood up and called Ron to stand up also. "Thank you all for coming; I know you all have busy lives, so we appreciate you coming on short notice." Hermione seemed nervous for some reason; maybe they were announcing bad news. "Ron and I, we are expecting our first child."
"You could be right there Fred."
Harry tried to count the hands that had been raised; it seemed to be less than half.
"I don't see why I need to be here, Draco."
"Harry?" He heard the familiar voice of Draco call through the house.
"Ok, well, um, I definitely felt pretty stupid afterwards, I suppose," Harry replied.
Draco cleared his throat and put on his best sincere smile. "No, of course not, I am just being silly." He leaned over and kissed him on the lips. "You deserve the award; you were so fucking sexy in that suit."
He smirked and nodded. "See you soon little man," He said, bending over and kissing Teddy on the cheek. "Right well I better go find Blaise and Theo before they let anyone into our compartment."
Seamus didn't move away; instead, his hand was on the back of Harry's head, deepening the kiss.
"I think someone has sabotaged this case."
"Not you, Harry, what was that you said about the daily prophet?"
"What do you mean?" Lucius frowned, looking at him now.
"This is fun, isn't it?  A Malfoy is begging me... do you make Potter beg?"
"And in the outfit...?"
Draco straightened up and walked unbalanced away from the pensieve to an armchair near the mirror of Erised.
Draco sighed and put the book flat on the desk. "It will need to be ready for tomorrow; you said you could do it."
Harry held the desk drawer handle, and a little glowing light appeared as the drawer clicked unlocked. He stepped aside holding it open letting Draco find what he needed to find.
"Rita Skeeter has a new book coming out," Harry said after a few moments of food being grabbed and drinks poured. "Rita Skeeter: Exposed 'A tell-all book about my life and my time at The Daily Prophet.'"
Lucius looked up from his lists and frowned at him. "Not in front of our guests, Draco."
Draco groaned expecting it. "Did he?" He asked, turning his head to the long blonde haired man at the head of the table who had been quiet all evening writing lists.
"You don't mind giving him his bottle, do you, Harry? I'm simply exhausted from all that walking," Andromeda said, opening one of the kitchen cupboards and pulling out a bottle of elf-made wine. "Would you like a glass Cissy?"
"I want to say no," Harry bowed his head. "But I can't."
"I'm so sorry; I don't know what to say."
"Another red, Please," Draco asked grabbing a waitress's arm as she walked past his table.
He frowned at Malfoy and checked his watch, it was only half one, and there were still so many rooms to check. "Don't you think we should at least check the rest of the rooms on this floor?"
"You alright, Ron?" Bill Weasley was striding up their table with the new timetables. "You look a little pale."
They both cheered with the majority of the arena as they were now leading 80/70.
"What are we having?" Harry asked giving in.
"How did your first day go, darling?" Narcissa beamed leaning in.
"Mr Weasley," He said knocking on the office door.
"No, it's Saturday," Harry mumbled again.
Fuck, Harry missed Draco.
"He is up in the stands," Jimmy whispered as he thought he would hear him.
"Not enough," Harry said, picking up the glass of wine in front of him and clinking it with Malfoy's which they both drank at the same time.
"A personal matter, what kind of personal matter?" Harry asked alarmed.
"Right, yeah, of course, you would. Um, I’ll just leave it here, then.” Harry walked over to the nightstand and carefully placed Draco's wand on top. “I guess I’ll see you later.”
Robards face fell, then frowned. "I want to apologise for how things went down the other night, at the Ball."
"You don't look it," Draco noted.
"I hardly think Malfoy is going to tell his parents he is going on a date with Harry, Ronald. Besides I don't even think they know he is gay, from what Ginny and Blaise have told me." Hermione said.
Harry had rescued a snake, two years ago, it was something that worried the people that were closest to him as Lord Voldemort had a snake, but Harry didn't see owning a snake as a bad thing. He felt it was something that was meant to be, as his first conversation was with a Boa constrictor in the zoo when he first realised he could talk to snakes. Morty had been trapped inside a box in a shop down Knockturn alley when they had raided it; it was almost dead by the time Harry had found it, but managed to heal him in time and decided to take him home.
Draco tilted his chin up in defiance--"Yes, I do," he said and lifted his hips to Harry's.
"What for Potter? I am swamped with homework and haven't eaten yet," Malfoy said with a half-truth.
"Instead of telling me you listened to him?" It was more of a statement than a question Harry noted but answered anyway.
"It's a contract," Lucius replied, in a scornful manner.
Draco inhaled angrily. "Potter?"
"It should be, Justin tried to get through before, and it turned into a slide."
He was wearing dark purple robes with silver fastenings, and his black hair was slicked back in a ponytail. He gave a Harry a smug look before curling his lips into a smile if he could call it that.
"So what was the point in trying out?"
"Wow, big achievement," Harry said amused but couldn't help feeling somewhat jealous. "What are you doing at work on Saturday anyway? I thought you would have somewhere more important and less boring to be."
"This has nothing to do with Blaise, mother," Draco said saving Blaise from responding. "You would have found out sooner or later," He paused and inhaled and exhaled. "I am in love with Harry."
********
Harry smiled and relaxed his hands, realising he was acting ridiculous. "Nothing, I am fine."
Harry looked flustered, his shoulders twitching under Draco's soothing hands.
"His birthday?" Draco gaped, it had completely slipped his mind that Harry was turning 25 this month.
"If you were the real Harry you would be able to answer this question," Draco began. "The crossword is my favourite part of reading the daily prophet, true or false?" He pointed to fake Harry.
"I..." Draco stopped and glared as a redhead entered his kitchen followed by bushy hair. "Yes, you may enter," Draco greeted them sarcastically.
“No, I mean,
Harry woke a few hours after being woken from Ron's nightmares, Zabini was stood by his trunk, shirtless and just in his boxers; Harry stared longer than he thought he ought to have and shifted his gaze to Malfoy's bed. It was already made, and no sign of being slept in; Malfoy must already be at breakfast he thought and looked to his best friends bed, who was snoring, the potion must still be in his system.
"Your Harry Potter."
"Why do you need three?" Harry asked quietly when she walked away.
"... I think if you are going to drink firewhisky, you should at least know the age of it," Blaise was saying in the background.
"So, what's up?" He asked, sitting on the top of his desk getting comfortable.
Draco flattened out his loose hair. "Yes, Potter."
Blaise shot up; Harry grabbed hold of the buckle on the back of Draco's waistcoat, Robards chuckled darkly.  "Temper, Mr Malfoy, you don't want to end up in Azkaban do you?" Robards asked holding his wand inside his robes.
"Yes, I had no idea about you and Potter until the photographer brought me the pictures. It turned out I wasn't the only one who had hired photographers, Robards was keeping a very close eye on you, and it was only a matter of time before something would be leaked to the prophet, so I had to use all the connections I had left to get things hushed up. However, you and Potter insisted on parading around together."
"Ill?" Harry asked. "What's wrong with her?"
Harry shivered as he snapped back into his office, he was thrilled he actually remembered something, maybe he was going to be okay after all.
The thing that made Harry most intrigued is the brief conversation they had after Draco had returned. It had been running around in his head the whole of yesterday, had Draco really looked into the mirror of Erised and seen Harry smiling back at him? There was nothing in there that had Harry's reflection, so he must have looked into the mirror and seen Harry. He grinned at this, Draco Malfoy, the man who could have anything he could ever want, desires Harry most in the world.
"Thank you," Harry smiled and kissed back. "What's this?"
"So I am being replaced?" Harry didn't quite know what he should be feeling, on the one hand, Ron was his best mate and was happy for him and the other He, well Harry with memories had earned that position, but also he in his current state had no experience in being Head Auror.
"I never said I didn't accept you."
"Thank you for coming in at short notice, Harry," Kingsley said sitting down at his desk. "Happy birthday, by the way."
Harry picked him up quickly and hid him back under the invisibility cloak, Malfoy stood in the corner furthest away from Harry as possible he was holding what looked to be a sausage roll. "My snake, he smelt your food," Harry said, glaring at the roll in his hand.
Pansy gave him a satisfied smile. "Of course," she cleared her throat. "So let's go back to the 11th July, you were both on the front cover under the heading friend or foe; you were coming out of Gringott's, were you both expecting the reaction you received?"
Harry took out a piece of parchment from his desk drawer and scribbled a quick reply,
Potter, was in the bed opposite his own; if it weren't for the closed curtain at the end, he would be able to see him lying in bed; the thought sent another tingle through his body. Weasley let out a loud snore, Draco groaned and sank back down into his pillow.
Mr Weasley's smile faded, and he stood up straight stiffly. "I am not sure; I think he just had a party." Draco could tell he was hiding something.
"I'm not going to wake her up Draco, stop being so dramatic," Lucius said as he was moving Lilys new teddy bear close to her in the stroller.
Even though Draco was only in Harry's house a few days ago, it was like he had never been inside before, it was like it had been obliviated from his mind, all he remembered was kissing Harry in the kitchen.  His cheeks flushed as he thought about it, he wondered if Potter had remembered it, they hadn't really spoken about Saturday night apart from when they were at the match, and he said he had fun with him, was that him hinting at the kiss, he wondered.
"Well, I don't like it." Draco sulked folding his arms.
*******
"They might try and tear us apart."
Draco heard Blaise and Harry snort behind him. "Why don't we all discuss this over Sunday lunch tomorrow, when we don't have half the wizarding community in our home?" Draco suggested.
"Fuck," Harry shouted and kicked his desk making it shift slightly. He checked all his drawers, knowing full well they weren't going to be there, he slumped into his chair and tried to work it out in his head. Was Robards covering up the Death Eater disappearances?
"You brought him up," He heard Ron mutter.
"Are you joking? It costs a lot of money to buy a cafe, especially in Diagon Alley."
Harry sat in the empty chair next to Malfoy avoiding his eye as best as he could.
Draco snorted and pushed himself out of the armchair. "I really am going now," He said and gave Harry a quick kiss before leaving.
"I am just saying are you sure the Malfoys aren't..."
Stepping into Hogwarts again and seeing it almost completely restored filled Harry with a sense of pride, though he had been to Hogwarts during the summer it was somehow different returning the start of a new school year. The sensations of sitting around the fire in the common room the warmth and love of his friends. The walk into the Great Hall was another experience altogether the rest of the school minus the first years had been seated, and all four tables of the houses and the teachers applauded, a booming glass shattering applause and cheering. It wasn't just for Harry; It was for all the Eighth years that had returned and who had fought bravely to protect their school.
Sunday 31st July 2005
"What?"
"We have been buying cafes," Ginny smirked. "Oh no wait, that was you."
Theodore had been on their radar for a while now he was apparently trying to build up an underground following to continue what Voldemort had set out to do, but they didn't have any proof, so they had been watching him for a year to see where he went and who he met.
"I think I am falling for you Harry," Draco broke the silence once more.
Draco sat for breakfast with his parents he was halfway through Potter's book and was thoroughly enjoying it, he had only decided to read it out of boredom while he had to wait for Harry yesterday, but when he discovered the closet story was right, he was even more intrigued. Apparently, his mother and her book club had already read the first three books, so he didn't have to go out and buy them. His father wasn't too pleased that he was reading it and smiling while he did.
"Mione, what can I do for ya?" Harry asked with a slur.
"Are you fucking serious? You are trying to hush the paper up by throwing money at it?" Draco's nose flared. "Not everything can be solved with money."
He eased himself onto Draco's lap, so he was straddling him, his arms around his neck, moving in until he was up close and personal, heat bleeding through the thin material of his shirt, making his mouth go dry, getting him hard and making his hips nudge up against his without thought. He only wanted to be closer, only wanted more of him. Harry smiled at the feel of him; his pupils were wide and rich. He kissed him, teasing him with light touches when Draco was straining for more, the ropes, hitting dully against the wood behind him.
He watched as Harry struggled to take off his shoes, which made him smirk slightly.
"Why are you here? Are you here to kill me?" Harry's voice was hoarse and didn't come out as loud as he intended.
for being my first beta you're amazing
“At least I'm with you,” Ron said to Harry, trying to find a bright side. “Could be worse. Neville is on his own with Goyle, Michael Corner and that weird Hufflepuff, Wayne. It’s just a shame we have to share with Malfoy and Zabini. What was McGonagall thinking?”
"Mate, I have learned not to argue with Hermione," He replied, smiling at Hermione, which made her blush.
Harry lifted up each hanger showing each suit and scowling when Draco took them off him and shook his head. "What's wrong with that one?" Harry asked when he took away a pale blue suit.
It's just the cost
Harry sighed. "Okay, I will end things with him, only because I don't want that for him."
After he got dressed back into his clothes, he happily paid her ten galleons for the whole outfit they had picked out and tailored and left to get some lunch before he had to go back to his office.
Harry smiled at him. "If I didn't know any better I would say you just want to spend more time with me," He teased.
"It's not about you," Harry said quickly. "I mean, it's not just about you; I don't like my job anymore."
"No, I got demoted," Harry said in a calmer voice.
"Do you think there's someone in there?" Harry asked him quietly.
"Aw, thanks mate."
"That makes no sense; you were all over each other yesterday morning; you shared a bed and everything."
Draco smiled weakly moving in front of the bowl; he could see a kitchen way down below. He lowered his head inside, and the ground beneath his feet disappeared as he was sent spinning through deep dark nothingness and landing in the kitchen; he was in Ginny's kitchen.
"You two," She replied. "Do you remember, last year at Neville's engagement party, I said to Harry maybe it will be your engagement party next year. And Blaise you said to Draco you could have a joint one."
Harry looked behind him too, and saw Ginny was now fast asleep. "I guess."
Draco sat in Lucinda's, the fanciest restaurant Draco could find that wasn't full of muggles. He was very irritated and not because he had already told off three waitresses for their rude service but because it was 7:45 and Harry had not arrived yet. He better have a good reason for this Draco thought to himself checking his watch for the third time in the past 30 seconds.
"Sometimes," he paused. "I just wish he would finally accept me, and not use me being gay against me."
"Not so good at the moment I am afraid, the Goblins are getting irritable with wizards that are bringing in Goblin made items for their own vaults, there will be a war over it soon I reckon," Blaise said enthusiastically.
Harry leaned back looking to see who was sitting between him and Zacharias, but there wasn't another chair there. "Who?" He asked, confused.
"You're going to knock those over Ronald," Hermione said as she watched Ron leaning against a stack of large cardboard boxes that weren't there last time Harry had been round and when he came to think of it their house was looking bare and full of the same boxes.
"So he made you write your resignation?"
The Carnival had become even busier since they had been on the Ferris Wheel, there seemed to be teenagers everywhere acting like idiots. Draco felt uncomfortable now as he walked next to Harry carrying the unicorn.
"Happy Birthday Mr Potter," A little old wizard squeaked coming out of the post office.
"Ron, Hermione, could you both sit? We need to have an important conversation," Harry said politely ignoring Draco's grey daggers.
Draco sat up straighter in his seat; Harry could tell he was intrigued. "What kind of favour?"
"It's not just the one picture, Mr Malfoy," Mr Weasley said, holding the bridge of his nose.
"Then I'm not late?" Harry said it was more of a statement than a question.
"That's the whole point," Draco smirked and kissed him tenderly on the lips. "Just keep it on for the rest of the day."
"They have only just got through the bloody fireplace, Draco," Harry waved him off them. "At least let them sit down first."
"I don't want to, you're boring," Teddy said making his pink hair turn bright red.
"That your outfits are hideous, and should be burned so you can never wear them again," Malfoy said, walking over to the closet next to the bathroom. He opened the doors and disappeared inside.
Harry smiled slightly as he wasn't used to seeing a nervous Malfoy, and he did want to support his team, on the other hand, he didn't think it would be good to skip out on work, he had responsibilities, it would be reckless to just leave with him. "We can come back earlier tomorrow?"
All their jaws dropped in surprise and horror which was Harry's reaction when he had seen him emerge from the tunnel.
Hermione and Ron were the reason all the Weasleys was having dinner together; they had sent an owl to everyone to be there as they had some important news they needed to share with everyone. Harry had no idea what the news could be; he already knew they were moving into a bigger house, so maybe that was it.
~~~~~
When 6:45 came Draco was more nervous than this morning; he had told everyone to get there by 6:30 so they could be ready for their arrival he just hoped that it had gone to plan. He hadn't a chance to see what the ballroom looked like before they arrived, but he had good faith in Hermione, he had left her detailed instructions which even a Weasley would be able to understand.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "It looks like a guest list or a very long hit list."
"He seems fine to me," Fred chuckled.
"I am going to be back in a few months for Christmas, Mother," He said, pulling out of her grasp. "Just keep sending me sweets, since I am not allowed to visit Hogsmeade."
"HUFFLEPUFF," The Hat called, and that seemed to have broken their eye contact. They both glanced away and back at the stage.
He loved hearing Draco groan as he worked his cock rhythmically, feeling it grow harder as he did so. After a few more strokes,  Harry let go. “Hang on,” he said after pulling his tongue from Draco’s mouth. He grabbed his wand again and used it to release Draco's hands.
"Crossword puzzle Draco? your deciding factor was a crossword puzzle?" Harry said angrily as he was being untied.
He walked down the hallway in his department and spotted Harry walking towards him.
"Then pay attention," He snapped and then continued. "Cotton has placed coloured pegs over there; I want you to stand behind the position you are trying out for, Red, keeper, Green, seeker, Yellow, beater and blue, chaser."
"Who is it?"
His hand was now sliding up, and down his shaft, as he replayed the memory currently in his head, he let his mind wander further as he was imagining ripping off the purple suit and throwing it on the kitchen floor. He saw himself biting his neck and sliding his tongue down his torso, he pulled down his boxers with his teeth, imagined his mouth opening to let in his length.  He snapped his eyes open and moaned as the release came to him; he used both hands to lean against the wall as he panted heavily.
"What are you talking about?" Lucius asked, he looked angry now but, Draco could tell the anger wasn't directed at him.
