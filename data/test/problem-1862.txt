You want him for yourself. It does not matter to transgress the laws of time and space ... that is only a small and vain limitation in terms of the love you feel for him.
"I went out with you because I needed to discover something, to know if I still felt something for you…" He whispered as he caressed her cheek with his pale and cold hand. And sadly, I no longer do.
"Well guys, I want a fair contest." Madam Hoch's voice caught everyone's attention, who moved to center court in their positions as they released the snitch and bloddgers. Let the party begin.
He stretched out on his bed, and tried to get comfortable on the bed for the sixth time without success; he felt oblivious to everything. Perhaps because he was already so used to the presence of Harry Slytherin, that now, even though he didn't know what time he would arrive, he wanted to see him.
He was like a friend — not wanting to sound too sentimental. Very different from his friendship with Pansy and Blaise - since their relationship was based on sarcasm and frolicking - or even the recent closeness with Hermione - which was purely intellectual.
Well, generally speaking: Harry is frustrated, a lot. Reading some books that he guessed had quite a bit of information about the world he currently resides in hadn't helped him at all, just to go over some basics and history that (he swears) Professor Binns had told at some point, between his stories about his youth and the rebellion of the goblins. Harry hadn't asked much before , but now that he intended to use as much information as possible to his advantage, he began to have too many questions that he was sure would take time to get answers, and Harry really wasn't the patient type. Merlin knows.
He thought about the previous days, it was evident that Draco was avoiding him since what happened in the hall that night; To say that he was disappointed by it was not enough because he believed, in his silly Gryffindor naivety, that that moment was the perfect approach to Draco Malfoy, the ideal bridge to start connecting with him, enjoying the union that was beginning to blossom ... but the other On the contrary, it marked a limit that little or nothing could cross.
Draco had a dream body, a body of crime. He melted when touched, being slightly deprived of his breath ... he tried to store a whole repertoire of what his partner liked, and he grew adrenaline in himself when he heard the moans and guttural sounds that denoted the ecstasy in which he was it enveloped her lover's body.
"Do you regret asking me not to put you in Slytherin?" The hat asked. He is everything you could be if you stayed in the house I originally intended for you.
"Why are we having this talk?" Now it was Draco who was curious about the strange approach of Harry from his world to him. I don't remember you trying to speak to me in months before this, at least since my trial to avoid Azkaban.
"And before I do, I have one condition." Draco raised his hand, trying to place a barrier between them. I don't care what you're up to, but yesterday never happened, okay? And you know what I mean.
If there was one thing that Draco hated, it was the resentful or pitying looks that more than one person gave him when he walked through the corridors of the newly built Hogwarts; although faced with that, he couldn't really do much, at least not with all his past in tow. He was determined to finish the entire Eighth Grade course at the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and no one could stop him. After the war, the Malfoy family was put on trial to debate full or partial involvement with the plans and affinity for Voldemort; the fact that his mother decided to lie to the Dark Lord - regarding Potter's supposed death - and that he failed to assassinate Dumbledore - in addition to Harry's endorsement as a witness to both events - was enough to exonerate them from all guilt. He would never admit it out loud, but he was eternally grateful to Potter for it.
Fred and George looked at him in surprise, as did Ron, and before either of them could ask, Harry brushed his hair away from the lightning bolt scar, and rolled his eyes at the surprised gasp of the three, but smiled. It wasn't like he could get too mad at them.
"Ha, again Weasley…" The sorting hat was silent for a brief moment, "didn't he put you in Gryffindor 8 years ago?"
Shortly after the battle, after a hot dinner and a bitter toast of victory, Harry locked himself in the books in the forbidden section of the school. The only way not to go crazy, he thought, was to distract his mind with what connected him to his lost person. Books were always Malfoy's favorites - much to his regret and jealousy - because if Draco found an interesting piece of writing, he would forget the whole world, even himself.
Draco opened and closed his mouth; he was overwhelmed by the words he had just heard, the ones he had wanted to hear for a long time. His hands sweated, and the heavy weight on his chest prevented him from breathing normally; although he was forced to diminish the emotion that was growing in his body, and tried to put any other face, except the idiot one that he surely had.
"Eight years of telling you, telling you, Potter to… Potter, they won't go away with three weeks." He tried to be rational, but he knew it was an eternal discussion.
Well, you might need to mentally prepare a bit before going head-to-head with the man who gave his bit in the worst Hogwarts he remembers, but you will. Hundreds of lives and a bloody Wizarding War depend on that.
"Are you sure it's for the best?" Ron's voice was heard coming out of the room that Draco wanted to enter.
"Even if you don't want to tell me, I think it's important that you talk about it." Not with me, but with Pansy or Blaise ... Pansy is better, I like her, she is funny and she gives me sweets in class.
He decided that it is better to do than to say ... or it was his animal part that spoke, because without asking prior permission, he took the member out of the obvious prison to which he was subjected and swallowed it in his mouth completely.
"I know you've been following me and I've been avoiding you." Harry exhaled relieving a feeling of anxiety installed in his heart and admired Draco's fervent bravery in making the first approach; he managed to nod and saw the other continue "I don't mean to go on being silly and I just want to finish this stupid eighth grade in peace, so I will ask you, no, I will demand that you stop being behind me. Nothing has happened between us. "
Harry couldn't meet the inquiring gaze of his friends and leaned his head on the head of the bed. Little by little, the fuzzy memories of the other Harry's gaze came to his mind, with that Slytherin pride and the smile he had when he scored the 190 point for his house since, with this, it indicated that he scored 15 times by himself to Gryffindor.
Soon, Madam Hooch's whistle ending the match; the look of glory and complicity that was directed between the other Harry and Draco, both embraced and as on Draco's pale face a blush became evident.
He even told him about that warlike world destroyed due to Harry Potter's fall to Voldemort; a universe from which he escaped as soon as he had the first opportunity and to which he never wanted to return.
"Did you hear me, Draco?" I won't let you go, ever. Harry unwrapped the paper that was right on the stool next to his bed and slowly entered it again, showing him what he had written on it. This is your letter, where you sell your soul to the devil, to me ...
He opened the door and slammed her, lay down on his soft bed, the one that smelled musty, dusty and old, but he didn't care. All he wanted was to sleep, sleep a lot maybe ...
Wearily and hunger sated, Harry flopped down on the bed in his room in the Leaky Cauldron and took a deep breath with his eyes closed. Now, it only remained to wait until classes started, so Harry had a month from tomorrow to catch up on all his books and plan a few more moves. He couldn't actually leave his room, not if he knew that at some point someone from the school or someone Dumbledore's acquaintance would pass by, be it for personal things or to search for the Stone, Harry didn't want to risk it. Even though he knew none of them would know him, he really would rather stay in the room reading and preparing.
And Sirius? Sirius is in damn Azkaban unfairly (and there is another question that came up: what the hell happened to Sirius's trial?), And Harry can save him in a matter of days if he's lucky.
Think of a still large family , of parents who still remember their daughter, of a boy happy to win an innocent tournament, of an innocent prisoner in Azkaban, of many children who grow up surviving in a war that does not even belong to them, of directors whose Well older is more important than hundreds of children and, no. Harry can't just turn his back on them to have a better life for himself, while knowing that thousands more are slowly but surely destroyed.
Hearing Harry's voice so early was a direct heart attack, almost a heart attack. His breathing accelerated in an obvious way, he opened his eyes completely and when he turned to see him, he realized that the other did not have glasses on, all the memories of the previous day came to him; How to meet that Harry said that he came from another world and consequently, how he was forced to share his room with him.
"When I came down from the bleachers, you were unconscious," Hermione said, stroking Harry's wrist. You had a broken leg and two broken ribs. We ran to bring you to the infirmary to be restored, apparently you are already out of danger.
Harry remained close to him, and although he still had a smile on his face, the sparkle in his eyes completely faded, leaving in his wake an unusual and cold tranquility that had nothing to compare with the green eyes of his world. they glowed at every challenge, or even just eating Honeyducks candy.
-Of course. Magic money can be exchanged for any Muggle currency. Answering your question, a galleon equals £ 4.93, a sickle is £ 0.29, and a knut is £ 0.01. The price is adjusted according to the currency and the economy of each country. ”When Harry nodded in understanding, Bustlesong continued. In turn, a sickle, which is a silver coin, is equal to twenty-nine knuts, which are bronze coins, and a galleon, the gold coin, to seventeen sickles. That is the system of Great Britain. The United States, for example, is governed by other rules, having only two currencies.
He watched them turn and walk to the cafe entrance, dipping his head on instinct as they glanced back at him, and he didn’t dare blink until they were out of sight because otherwise he would swear it had been his imagination. Then the glass door shut behind Potter with a gentle clang, the hem of their robe vanishing around the corner, and Draco let out a sigh so large his body nearly collapsed from the weight of it all. “The Great Harry Potter wants to get drinks with me, a confirmed Death Eater.” Even in a barely-audible whisper, hearing the words out loud sent an electric spark up his spine. “Merlin this is ridiculous, there is no way this is real and happening, it - my luck is not this good,” he groaned, rubbing at his eyes and quickly opening them again when Potter’s limp body reappeared in the darkness.
When he finally pushed the door open and stepped inside, it was just as he expected - dusty lamps hung over wooden booths, soft music played from speakers in different parts of the room, and a few grizzled, tired-looking regulars raised their heads at the bar as he entered. He was out of place, that much was obvious - his black trousers and turtleneck were probably worth more Galleons than this building’s rent - and he awkwardly waited by the door for some sign of what to do next.
“How sweet of her.” The danger hadn’t left Pansy’s voice and she leaned forward, chest nearly falling out of the steep neckline of her dress. “You have five minutes to explain what the bloody hell happened at your trial.”
. His fingers twisted into a painful knot in his lap, and Draco was terrified to breathe too loudly for fear of setting off whatever potential explosion seemed to be lingering in the air.
“So they trust it during the war when it was run by bloody Death Eaters, and now that it’s cleaned up its act they hate it? At least muggle loyalty makes sense.”
calls Mister Harry Potter to the witness area to speak on behalf of the accused, Mister Draco Malfoy.” The surprise must have shown on his face because some of the wizards in the lofted pews laughed softly amongst themselves. Shacklebolt, the Chief Warlock in this case, hadn’t said a word despite leading the first day of the trial completely on his own, and instead the speaker was a short, pudgy witch sitting to the right of Shacklebolt’s tall seat. Her blonde hair was stick-straight, barely reaching the tops of her robes and greasier than his own, but there was something in her eyes that made him want to take a step back, like when he had met Dolores Umbridge the first time.
Their words stung but only because at one point they were true, and they both knew it. He ignored the insult and stirred his drink with the straw, watching the ice cubes slowly starting to dissolve, and when he spoke next his heart was in his throat because they were so, so close to getting to the point, the problem of it all. “I don’t hate you.” The words came out so quietly that he could barely hear himself over the ambient sounds in the pub, and he could already sense Potter’s further confusion. “I haven’t hated you since the end of fifth year, actually. Blame your trip to the Hall of Mysteries.”
Aedan quietly excused himself at the pause in conversation, their robes brushing past his arm as they moved around the table. Leaving him alone with the Boy Who Lived, who he had tried to kill on more than one occasion.
“We both know that’s a load of bullshit.” Pansy looked unimpressed, swirling the red wine in her glass gently before sipping at it. “
“Sure thing...” She was scribbling it all down even as she followed Potter to a table on the back wall, chewing on her lower lip. “You know we might even get snow on Wednesday.”
Their words are stiff and polite, more to fill the silence than actual interest. “A bit. Went to Diagon Alley to pick up some textbook to study from and was almost killed,” he admitted, and he lifted his gaze in time to see their eyes flash with something that he thought looked like fury. “What’s the story behind his place, Potter? It’s clear you’re a bit more than just a regular customer.”
“You were more than decent at potions, Malfoy.” There’s a seriousness in their voice that throws him off for a second. “Snape didn’t just love you because you were in Slytherin, you were brilliant at them, Hermione wouldn’t shut up about how she beat your O.W.L. score for Potions by only 5 points.”
Draco woke with a start on the living room’s couch, eyes flying open as he nearly fell off the seat cushions he’d been draped over. The wards from when the Dark Lord resided at the manor wailed like banshees, echoing through the vaulted rooms along with a booming knock at the front door, and he was thankful his mother had chosen to stay with her sister during the week of the hearing. After the initial rush of adrenaline had started to die down, he groaned loudly, eyes squeezed shut again, silencing the alarms with a swirl of his wand as he slowly rose to stand. Everything in his body hurt. A brief glance at the clock told him it was 7 in the morning - three hours of sleep was not a flattering way to appear at the second day of his trial. Another knock ricocheted around his skull before settling into an angry throb. “Coming,” he shouted, wearily opening his eyes fully and striding for the door, spine aching with every step. He hadn’t bothered to change out of his outfit from the hearing the day before, white dress shirt creased in all the wrong places, trousers twisted awkwardly around legs that felt too long for the rest of him.
Any other protests died on his tongue. They still had their hand out, and it sang of acceptance and friendship, and if he let himself dream, hope for something else - the idea threatened to make him dizzy. “Okay,” he found himself saying with a small nod, and then he was shaking Harry Potter’s hand in what felt like an Unbreakable Vow with none of the fanfare because the perfect way their palms fit together sent magic spiraling up his arm. “Draco Malfoy. Nice to meet you too.”
“Is it true that he has intentionally gone out of his way to make your life much more difficult than it should have been, including giving a highly dangerous, cursed item to a member of your Quidditch team, and interfering with your time spent in classes?”
Why did he hesitate? She was his best friend, really one of his only friends, and she would rather die than tell any of his secrets. “Potter did,” he admitted, trying to swallow the blush that was already threatening to creep onto his cheeks, and her laugh made it appear faster.
”, and he felt a swell of affection towards her. These few weeks during the trial had been incredibly lonely, especially without mail of any sort, and it was flattering to have two separate event invitations waiting.
peered down at him, and Draco swallowed the nagging pull he felt towards the stairs leading to the roof of the manor; it always came at this time of the night, but his mother would notice his absence the next morning. He couldn’t let her lose her child and husband so close together.
Again they paused and inwardly Draco groaned, using one hand to gently massage his temples. “I am truly sorry, Mister Malfoy, but I don’t think I am able to discuss such things with you, even if it does concern you and your safety,” the auror said slowly, shaking their head.
“Yes.” Draco couldn’t look at anyone, focusing on the floor just past his feet instead - he just kept seeing the lifeless expression Potter had on his face at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, and if these memories stuck around for much longer he might lose what little composure he had with three hours of sleep. “Before I was on the ground,” they continued, “he’d hit me with
He turned towards them, holding the parchment up and shaking it a bit. “I’ve been summoned to coffee tomorrow by some unknown party that managed to sneak a letter through the Ministry’s defenses.”
This whole story, even if it was a different side of the fight recalling it, was entirely new and unexpected to Draco. His mother had neglected to mention her bold defiance of the Dark Lord, even after the war had ended, but it explained why his parents had taken him and fled the moment Potter’s fight against You-Know-Who had started. She had known that the moment he found out Potter wasn’t dead, the moment the Dark Lord won the fight, he would’ve slaughtered her and the rest of the Malfoy name without a second thought.
Oh fuck, he knew exactly where this was going. It suddenly dawned on him that her smile looked more predatory than his first impression suggested and Draco swallowed hard, leaning back in the stiff-backed chair in an attempt to brace himself. He had been stupid, so stupid, all of the petty harassment that was completely unwarranted was now coming back with an added vengeance. An Azkaban-like chill settled into his bones as the witch resumed her questioning.
Saviour Potter was quiet for a moment, and Draco looked up just enough to see their eyes glaze over slightly, a hand running through their unruly hair before falling back into their lap. “So, the Snatchers,” they started, and there was something hesitant in their voice. “They were sort of like bounty hunters almost, during the war. They’d roam around everywhere, looking for muggle-borns or - or people that were like openly speaking out against Voldemort, and generally they’d catch them and bring them back to him to be dealt with.”
He only remembered the third letter when he could smell something on fire, looking over to see the corners of the envelope smoking and starting to shake in the owl’s beak. It was a crimson envelope with a formal-looking seal, and his heart sank because it was a Howler, it had to be, and when he looked at it in closer detail there was no sender written on the outside. By this time the owl had fled to a separate part of the house, and the other two seemed to quickly follow suit as the envelope smoldered and shook violently in his hand.  He quickly cast a
, many of the members shifting to whisper to their neighbours, robes rustling like leaves in a forest. The same witch seemed at a slight loss for words, jaw silently opening and closing for a moment, before she looked up to Shacklebolt in his towering seat. An unspoken question passed between the pair, then Shacklebolt gave a small shake of his head and the witch nodded, her seemingly default smile returning to her face shortly after. “I don’t believe that will be necessary, Mister Potter, but thank you for your honesty. Let’s continue with your testimony, to the other incident, with the Snatchers. Can you explain to everyone what those are?”
Aedan came from behind him somewhere, their jacket hem swirling around their knees. “Not a bad day, only one outburst.” They withdrew their wand from their sleeve, tapping it to one of the manacles and stepping back as they opened with a loud clang. “There’s usually a few more at a massive trial like this.”
If you enjoyed please consider leaving me a comment or kudo! Life will be extremely chaotic for the next few months so updates will be even further apart, but I promise it isn't abandoned <3 Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a lovely day!
If Harry hated anything more than herbology classes, it was learning of the fantastic quantum existence of alternate universes to his own. And what better, that in each one of them - or at least in the majority -, a version of him inhabited.
That Harry was everything he imagined at his tender age of eleven with the offer of friendship he made.
"Surprising, you were early, even before me," Draco said, breaking Harry's scan, and although his voice sounded confident, he could see his hands shaking slightly; I was nervous.
She gathered up her things, carefully putting her scrolls and pens in the small briefcase that Blaise gave her, and threw in a tempo, indicating that it was close to nine at night; It was past dinner time, and she didn't want to look ridiculous by arriving when everyone had surely finished. He hoped Pansy had saved him a piece of cake.
Will he have to kill Quirrell with an unsuspecting Avada, and thus kill that piece of Voldemort's soul? And if he does that, then will it stop Voldemort from trying to search for a body with Pettigrew's help?
Thank you all very much for the kudos, favorites, comments ... I am very happy to know that someone is reading this and smiles (or despairs, whatever the case may be)
Blurred and confused scenes came to his mind, the sour memory of watching Slytherin score point after point thanks to his team's Harry, the worry of not being able to find the snitch, the helplessness when he was distracted every time he listened like the other team. they celebrated.
He was dedicated to observing him, to learn more about the Draco of this world, who, in essence, was very similar to the one in his universe, but there was something different, and he wanted to know everything.
He clenched his hands and started running towards what was his room in the dungeons. There were not many who were left of his house, but he did not want the duties of a prefect either, so they gave him a room very close to the common room, but far from the other bedrooms.
And also, he acknowledged, that for many years he longed to hear the Harry of his world say those words to him, to look at him with that contained desperation and anxiety.
"No," Bustlesong narrowed his eyes, "even if he tried with his key." Which you didn't do, if you're concerned.
Many thanks to everyone who has read so far. Draco will have to make a decision sooner or later, and hopefully soon, because I don't like seeing either of Harry suffer :( (Well, I do like it a little bit because I like drama) Thanks for the kudos, the comments , favorites etc., I am excited to see how people like the story.
"It is not your decision, Potter." Draco frowned, and he could see that, for the first time that day, he was upset. I am grateful that you have saved me on more than one occasion, but I am not indebted to you to sacrifice what I really want for you.
A neat and elegant black outfit and over it, a cape with the crest of the Slytherin house on his chest.
"Yeah, well, here I am." Draco looked impatient, looking everywhere except at him. Where will we go?
Malfoy scowled at her, but before she could answer him, the lady with the cart knocked gently on the door. Harry grinned as he opened and pulled the small galleon cloth bag from one of his pockets. He ordered three of everything from the cart, and after paying the surprised salesgirl, he tossed all of the things onto the seat next to Ron.
"Well, I think they'll release me until tomorrow." I still have a headache, ”Harry answered, smoothing the sheets that covered him.
"You say his name!" Ron exclaimed in terror, and Harry was mentally struck at his little great forgetfulness: Voldemort's name was a stupid taboo in the wizarding world. Before I can say anything, the twins reappeared.
Pansy, of course, wanted the darkest and dirtiest details; as who of the two kissed better - to his consideration - if Harry Gryffindor had a good penis - big and thick - and if he enjoyed cumming in the hand of the savior of the magical world. Draco, without a hint of embarrassment, answered it all with his chest puffed out with pride.
"Well, since we don't know until when Mr. Potter… who is not from our world can leave, and he needs to stay here where we can keep him guarded." Minerva was silent for a few moments, walked to where the Sorting Hat was resting in a glass case, and turned to see them again. I hope you don't mind if I put the Hat back on his head, I just need to make sure that I will make the right moves so that he is in the temporary house.
You protected him, didn't you? Of Quirrell, of Remus and Sirius when he believed they were a danger to him and Ron and Hermione and then took them to the infirmary, then continued his role as a spy to help with the War, he tried to help Sirius despite his hatred against man, damn it. Snape even heard it when things were serious. He helped him and his friends to get the horcruxes destroyed as much as he could while continuing his role of perfect loyalty to Voldemort.
He narrowed his eyes when the man looked with a raised eyebrow at some parents who were definitely Muggles as they said goodbye to their son, and saw the other two Malfoys. The last time he saw Lucius Malfoy the man was devastated by Azkaban; however, Narcissa Black Malfoy was destroyed by a war that she did not want to be a part of. Despite being alongside Lucius in the war, Harry knew that the woman was not a Death Eater and did not seem to have any intention of being one. The last he heard from her, she and Snape had a deal to protect Draco, and almost reluctantly, Harry respected her. He knew perfectly well that good mothers, to protect their children, would do many things. And he couldn't tell if Narcissa was a good person or not, but he was pretty sure she was a good mother, and that was actually enough for Harry, as long as she didn't get in his way.
—They had a very important business trip in the United States, and none of us three knew this letter would actually arrive, so they could only wish me the best of luck and send me to one of our neighbors who, in reality, cannot See the place, so I went in alone. ”Harry shrugged and then looked around with a little fear. Dad told me to find a place here to stay until classes start because they won't be able to be there, so ... I wanted to know if you know of any place, and how to get to the alley, maybe?
Harry wasn't so convinced he's a Gryffindor by now. Right now, he lacked being sincere, and lacking the courage to face even those who were his friends and who were supposed to love him unconditionally.
"You could, Mr. Weasley." McGonagall maintained the serenity that characterized her so much. But since I poured some of the truth potion into the tea I offered you just moments ago, it could mean that there is some reason in his words.
But as time passed, he grew the indomitable need to get closer and closer to Draco. It was mesmerizing the silver gaze that shone when it seemed no one was seeing him; it was unbelievable how fine he was being tall and thin, even when he was covered with school capes. More than once he found himself staring at the slightly pink lips that harmonized with the rest of her face.
Nobody believed that the oldest members of Slytherin would return, they all associated that they had fled, had shut themselves up or something similar; but seeing them there, defying that fact as resounding as it was that the members of Salazar's household were not welcome, provoked in them a primal emotion that few could properly express.
Harry, brave — or maybe stupid blinded by jealousy — leaned closer to Draco and kissed him hard. When he felt that Draco did not reject him, he continued his contact with more intensity, reaching into Draco's cloak to caress the other's firm body over the clothing. He didn't think that was happening, and to be honest, he could die very happy in that moment if his nemesis wanted to curse him after that.
The voice of his partner began to be heard in the distance, he really did not pay attention to what he was saying. The effect of the Harry Potter name - Gryffindor - was aberrant. It caused him instability, anger, yearning ...
Do not hate him please, it is that he is small and he barely gets twenty of many things. Thank you all for your comments, favorites, kudos, thoughts ... I am very happy that people from other countries read what I write, and when people read it whose mother tongue is not Spanish, well, it is a sugar bomb straight to my heart.
"It's you, remember?" That useless spell could repel everyone, except those who have the same brand of magic.
Draco turned to see him at that moment, and he could see the perfect moment where the pout in his mouth transformed into utter amazement. He saw him, and again he turned his eyes to the other.
Draco ran as fast as his ripped clothes allowed; the objective was his room, but he had to stop at one of the men's restrooms near the dungeons. He locked himself in one of the cubicles and sat on the floor; He tried to control his rampant breathing, and how not to do it after how the Harry of his world caressed him completely, leaving small bites and scratches on his legs, where his mouth had wandered freely without feeling in the least self-conscious.
"Hi, sorry, but ... could you tell me how ... to get through?" Harry looked up at Ron and smiled at him, glad to receive a half smile in return.
Soon, he felt the tingling in his abdomen, the one that told him in a hurry that he would ejaculate at any moment; He decided to let himself be carried away by the evident orgasm he would feel and surrendered to the intensity of the sensations that plummeted over him.
And he was only dedicated to listening. There was no better experience in this life than Draco Malfoy's voice as he relaxed for the night.
The magician who wrote it had mentioned the theory of the existence of worlds parallel to his own. He did not describe evidence, nor did he manage to say clearly where his central idea was headed, only mentioned that he had gone to the Muggle world one day and stopped his excursion at a Muggle University where many people - apparently quite intelligent - were meeting in a class. and in this they indicated that our universe was not the only one that existed, but that in parallel there were other realities that coexisted with ours, on a different but simultaneous plane.
He wasn't that interested in the house cup - hey, it wasn't his world in the first place - but what he did care about, to the degree of giving himself with all his heart and soul, was helping Draco Malfoy smile for everyone. possible causes; like when he was informed that, for those remaining points, Slytherin now led the annual house competition.
Draco opened his eyes when he felt the faint rays of light bathing his face, he rubbed his eyelids and ended up opening them, observing the thin silk fabrics that decorated his Victorian style bed. Normally she kept the curtains covering the window — honestly, it wasn't good that the first thing she saw when she woke up was a giant squid hovering around the room — but for some reason it was open now; He could see cloudy water, algae, and strange things — he doesn't want to know about — swimming outside the glass.
"Hello, Potter," he said casually, but kept his distance even with the surprise of hearing him say his first name. I see that you are better.
"Mr. Potter, I have told you that I have worked with your great-grandfather, and before me, there were a few others who worked with the Potters since the 12th century." It's stupider than it looks if, in fact, you believe that Vault 687, which by the way is the trust vault your parents left you for the school years, is the only one you have— Harry actually blushed in embarrassment this time. before the accusing eyes.
—I remember that the you of my world, used to get away from what bothered him, be it situations, places or even people. Draco was instantly uncomfortable at the mention of his alter ego, the affection in his voice was evident; and he couldn't help feeling a stab of self-loathing. I don't want to say that you are someone you are not, and much less impose something on yourself, just… I think it's the best when there is something that you don't even understand yourself. It is necessary to put distance sometimes.
Not Harry, Harry was Draco's best friend and for his son, Lucius seemed to swallow everything he wanted to say.
Therefore, as night fell and being in the privacy of his room, he had to take advantage of the moment of privacy he had with Draco.
Hello! I hope you continue to love our Harry Slytherin ... this character little by little enters Draco's life, and I think Harry Gryffindor doesn't like him too much, will he do something to stop him?
Draco could feel a certain tension building around him as the presence - and existence - of another Harry Potter besides himself surfaced; which was very rare.
Harry nodded and turned to leave, though he paused for a second, thinking about how to express the only thing he wanted in exchange for his departure. He breathed, over and over and ...
Harry ducked his head down in an attempt to hide the blush that was inevitably blooming across his face. “
The tension was broken when Draco let out a light laugh, gesturing for Harry to pick up the Snitch. “Go on.”
As Hermione and Ron bickered about their new appliance, Harry searched the crowd for any sign of Draco. Realizing that the sea of people was far too thick, he sighed and turned to his own purchases. He’d been successful in buying presents for nearly everyone on his list, which was a great relief. He’d spent far too many Christmas Eves in years past scrambling to Diagon Alley after realizing that he’d waited to buy presents until quite literally the last second.
As soon as he unlocked the door to his flat, Stockinette twisted out of his arms and made a beeline for one of her favorite spots, the back of the couch in the living room. Setting down his things on the kitchen counter and digging his knitting out of his satchel, Harry let out a heavy sigh, his mind churning with thoughts of Draco.
“Also,” Harry began, taking Draco’s hand in his own once again, “to answer your question from the letter, I don’t care what we are, Draco, as long as I’m with you.”
Harry stepped closer, patting her reassuringly on the back. “Why don’t I help Teddy get dressed? Go take a minute to yourself before we leave.”
“Hi,” Draco said, glancing around the shop. “My mother got your letter, and she insisted I bring this as a thank you along with her response. Wow, this is the emptiest I’ve ever seen the shop during the day.”
“I promise,” Harry said, reassuringly patting her on the shoulder. “Everything’s going to be great.”
Draco slowly tore his eyes away from the risque magazine spread Potter had done for charity, only to find Pansy staring at him, eyebrows raised and mouth quirked knowingly. The cow.
Malfoy’s lips parted slightly at his words. He murmured another lubrication spell before lining himself up with Harry’s hole. Harry braced himself, forcing his muscles to relax as the head of Malfoy’s cock pushed in. Harry gritted his teeth at the stretching sensation, knowing that they would have to go slow. Given all of the weeks of preparation that had gone into the Christmas exams, as well as the exams themselves, fucking each other hadn’t exactly been a priority. It had been a while, and Harry could certainly feel it as Malfoy continued to gently push in until he was seated entirely inside. He let out a long, shaky breath, overwhelmed by the feeling of fullness that was somehow too much yet not nearly enough.
“Very well.” He pulled the container of sugar cubes closer, dropping one into his tea before withdrawing his wand from the back pocket of his trousers, pointing it at Aedan as he waited for the sugar to dissolve. “I’m afraid that you have given me really no choice. You will tell me exactly what has happened for the Ministry to suddenly care so much about my wellbeing, or I will ensure that you are fed to our estate’s peacocks and the many other delightful creatures the Dark Lord entrusted to my family’s care.” The auror looked apprehensive for the first time they had set foot into the manor, and Draco tilted his head, watching them. “Do I make myself clear?”
Their cheeks turned a slight pink, and their sudden embarrassment made him feel a little more at ease. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Excuse me,” Draco said stiffly, standing up, and he tried to steady himself with deep breaths as the world started to sway and darken around him. It felt like someone was pushing on his chest, compressing his ribs to the point where it hurt, and he struggled to take in any air at all. “I’ll be right back.” He carefully made his way into the restroom, weaving around whatever was in his way and barely managed to keep himself composed before locking himself in a stall.
“I told you Malfoy, I don’t think you’re all bad. I think your dad and friend choices are pretty shit, but I am going to actively try to give you that second chance.” They shifted, taking a sip of water before pushing on the table to stand, and gazing up at Potter was a view he hadn’t known he wanted. There was definitely a hint of something gold shining in their dark, birdsnest of hair - if Draco did believe in the muggle idea of angels, he was sure that the Boy Who Lived was the most revered of them all. “Just - if you want it,” they continued, pulling his mind back into the cafe. “There is an open invitation for drinks when you can get regular owls again, my schedule is - it’s pretty flexible now.”
“It was a joke, Draco,” she replied primly, rolling her eyes. “And stop being so dramatic about it, falling in love with the Boy Who Lived is a perfectly reasonable reaction to being under Ministry observation, happens to everyone, I’m sure.”
The moment Draco heard that Potter was the one who requested his guard he choked on his tea, coughing quietly into his elbow while his mind raced and Aedan finished talking. Potter? They had always hated him, ever since that terrible first-year meeting, even tried to kill him in sixth year; why did they want him protected? A tiny, hopeful part of him reared its head for the first time since the Battle of Hogwarts and he forced it down again, shaking his head. “I’m sure some of the aurors informed you of how notorious the Malfoy name is,” he said instead, watching ripples shimmer across the surface of his drink.
as the trial drawing goosebumps to his skin and seeping through his bones. Draco opened his mouth to talk, didn't even have a plan for what to say, but Potter held up a hand to stop him before he could utter a sound. “Don’t you dare Malfoy, I don’t want to hear your voice, not until I’m finished, or I’m leaving and you’ll be left alone again.”
“You... You said you are training for the aurors, yes? What do you think of it so far? I remember being surprised by how much paperwork is involved, I had thought we would always be in the field,” Aedan replied with a small chuckle, leaning back in his chair. As Potter’s eyes moved to focus on the other wizard Draco took the chance to sink into the chair across from them, idly tracing the top of the glass with an index finger. He sat quietly as the two chatted, sipping at his water whenever he felt like their conversation might try to involve him, and soon the tremble in his fingers died down. It felt so surreal, being this close to Saint Potter with none of the Hogwarts animosity between the two of them, just a semi-awkward vibe in the air, and he stole fleeting glances in their direction. They looked different now, now that the war was over, as if some of their edge had gone and they could relax more.
When Draco turned to lean against the countertop, he saw them still lingering in the doorway awkwardly, and he raised an eyebrow as the man tucked their wand away into their robes. “There is a perfectly good chair right there. You’ve already invited yourself into my house, might as well invite yourself to the table as well,” he drawled, and even in his sleep-deprived state he got a twinge of satisfaction as the man flushed. Now that he wasn’t concerned with a curse hitting him right between the eyes, he could take the chance to look them over properly, leaning back on his hands and watching them pull out one of the wooden chairs. They were tall and lean, with the sort of build that seemed more suited to the beach than watching war criminals, at least from what he could see from the way their dark, three-piece suit fit.
After they left the restaurant Harry silently led him through the village’s winding, weathered streets up to a park, finally stopping near a bench that overlooked a carefully kept pond and a perfect view of the sunset within a grove of trees. They both sat down almost simultaneously, not close enough to touch but close enough that it’s not seen as avoidance, and Draco was conscious of how much warmth the Chosen One was giving off compared to the evening chill of the air. He’s not sure when he changed his mind, moved from thinking of them as Potter-the-enemy to Harry-normal-guy-from-school, as if they were on a first-name basis, but he silently rolled the word around on his tongue and decided he liked the feel of it.
Potter carefully stood up, stretching a bit. “That was really good, I needed that.” Draco silently nodded his agreement, finishing the last swallow of chai before pushing to stand as well. “Hey, I want to show you something.” If it had been anyone else alarm bells would have been going off, warning him away from following into a trap, but this was Potter - if the idiot Gryffindor wanted him gone there had been plenty of other chances.
The latch had barely been lifted before the heavy door was pushed open, knocking Draco off-balance enough to have him stumbling as someone stepped into the front entrance hall, their cloak flaring out dramatically behind them. The first thing he noticed was the carefully-gelled hair that topped the figure that stood over a head taller than him, his groggy mind barely able to take that in before a slender, light-colored wand was pointed at his face, its owner peering suspiciously at him with piercing, grey eyes. “You must be Draco Malfoy.” There was a hint of a Spanish accent on their tongue, and he knew they had to be with the Ministry if they hadn’t killed him on sight. “Please place your wand on the floor and raise your hands to your head.”
That, that was what he had been bracing for since the start of the trial - she didn’t believe he could pull this off, that he had been innocent during the war and nothing he had done was of his own free will. “I don’t want to talk about this anymore,” he said sharply, and he felt a quiet pang of shame when she stayed silent until the trio had left the Ministry building and apparated into the manor again.
“What the fuck were you thinking!?!! Why the fuck would you go and do something so, so - so stupid!! You do realize you’ve basically ruined everything, right, all that freedom and good image you’ve been working on, it’s all fucking gone because you can’t keep your bloody dick out of it!!” She was pacing on the uneven cobblestones, back enough from the main street to where her shouts wouldn’t be heard by a passerby, hands clenched into fists as she ranted. “He’s going to sell your stupid soul to the fucking
“There is always going to be a chance of that, regardless of if I testify or not.” She had reached for his hands and he pulled them away, carefully stepping around her and going towards the door. “I refuse to take a potion just to tell the truth about how the war went. It’s - it’s humiliating.”
“Sorry.” Potter looked genuinely apologetic as they leaned back in the booth, visibly relaxed. “She’s not normally this bad, it must’ve been a slow day.”
Once the worst of the nausea had passed he raised his head, looking up to Aedan in time to see something like understanding flicker across their face. “Draco, you - if my -” They seemed to be searching for the right words and he let them, his heavy breath the only sound in the bathroom. “I would be sick as well if I found out my fiancé died,” the auror said finally, and their words sank into his gut in an ugly way.
“Potter,” he replied without thinking, and to cover himself he quickly added, “He said I owe him a drink, since he saved my life, that’s all.” Then it hit him like a bludger to the face: that smell on the parchment was
They smiled a little, shrugging and shifting to lean on the table with one arm. “Her dad died last year, some brain aneurysm they couldn’t catch until he passed away, and her and her mum fell on hard times. I came here a decent amount before then, but I had enough saved in the fund from my parents, and the reward money from the Ministry and everything to help support them until they could be back on their feet. I think her mum considers me to be some miracle son she never had.” They paused to take a sip of the chai and Draco waited patiently, wrapping his hands around the mug to let the warmth seep into his fingers. “They spoil me with good food, and if I ever need to go underground again, they would do whatever it took to get me out of the country.”
When Draco arrived outside the pub, he had to double-check Potter’s letter twice for the correct address. The building was tucked away into an alley, front weathered horribly and with windows that looked to be clouded with age, so much so that he could barely see the yellow light through them and thought it was abandoned. From what he had seen the village itself was quaint and mainly muggle, only a faint hum of magic in the air, and the main street was all small shops he’d never heard of.
They looked grown up now, like all their proportions had worked themselves out nicely; their shoulders had broadened, some stubble had grown along the jawline that had appeared in the last few months, and he could even see faint outlines of pectoral muscles beneath their shirt as they breathed. However, the dark, bruise-coloured circles under Potter’s eyes didn't go unnoticed either - Draco privately thought that they had started to rival his own.
“I want him as a regular, not you,” she said primly, and then she disappeared from sight as Potter sighed, cheeks pink with what Draco assumed was a blush.
Their defense of his abilities left him completely stunned, and he worried that his jaw was hanging down to the floor. What could he possibly say to that? “Thanks,” he managed in a strangled-sounding voice, nodding and trying to look composed, and inside he was about to burst with how pleased he was at their support. “No rest for the wicked and all, you know how it is.”
He maneuvered around the other customers and tables until he was standing on the opposite side of the Boy Who Lived, Aedan following closely behind. Potter was reading a book he hadn’t heard of, something named
“Yeah, yeah that’s right.” Draco watched their gaze flick down to their drink before becoming unfocused for a moment. “I mean I don’t really remember anything from that first time, back when I was a baby, but everyone’s pretty sure I did then, and now I’ve got that new time, from the Battle of Hogwarts.”
will meet on their own and decide how to proceed, and we will send an owl when we have come to a decision.”
He couldn’t bear to look them in the eye after that, choosing to shift his gaze down to the gouges in the mahogany tabletop. The Golden Boy was right, about everything, and as much as he wanted to look up at them and see the face of someone that had solved his every problem without realizing it, he knew all he would find was the stone-cold expression Potter had worn the last few times they had been photographed for
Aedan passed the letter back, Draco opening his eyes, carefully folding it and slipping it into the envelope again. “I don’t know what you mean, I get loads of fresh air,” he said with more defensiveness than he intended, but he knew that wasn’t what they meant.
would have a field day tearing apart our every move, it would - it’s the last thing we need, after the war.” He looked up just long enough to see them nod and take a large swig of their beer, and he knows he’s gone and fucked it all up, they’d changed their mind about the whole second chance thing and they were going to finish that drink then walk out the door and owl
“Sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.” She had a hand to her ear mockingly and he leaned forward in the chair, licking his lips before speaking again.
“Leaving already?” Amber is suddenly back at their table, pouting a little with her hands on her hips. “It feels like you just got here...”
He groaned, tossing the parchment onto his bedside table in favour of rolling back onto his stomach and burying his face into the soft swell of his pillow. He had meticulously folded and hidden the robe Potter had forgotten under his pillow, pretending it was for safe-keeping and not his own selfish want to trigger dreams of the Chosen One each night, and one of his hands fisted into the thick material as he closed his eyes tighter. That night, the one where he had messed up everything so badly but came out with a hesitant friendship, had been playing endlessly in his mind’s eye since it had happened; the lights lining the manor’s hallways reminded him of the way the lamppost had circled Potter’s head in a golden glow, he’d wash his hands before breakfast and remember the way their horrible scars had felt under his fingertips, even something as simple as pausing in a doorway would remind him that Potter had asked him to stay, even grabbed his arm to hold him there because his presence was
As he took in the view, he felt the car begin to slow. He looked towards Harry, who was navigating the car off the road and onto a dirt area that sat at the edge of one of the fields. He put the car into neutral and shoved the handbrake on before glancing up at Draco with a glint in his eyes.
Once he had placed his order through tapping the items he wanted with the tip of his wand, he made himself a cuppa and settled onto the couch. Stockinette jumped in surprised, glowering at Harry as she rearranged herself.
After forty minutes, Harry found himself deeply immersed in coconut curry over noodles and fresh, warm naan bread. Stockinette, having grown quite curious, was sitting opposite Harry on the coffee table, her tail swishing in anticipation.
Draco stumbled out after him, straightening the collar of his coat as he looked around. Ron and Hermione lived in a decently sized flat in the heart of London, the city’s bright lights shimmering against the darkness of the night through the living room window. Their walls were, with the insistence of Hermione, covered in Muggle art prints, and the flat had been brought to life with levitating houseplants hovering next to the fireplace and the couch.
Draco opened the door, and everyone ― barring Teddy, who had promptly decided to cling to Draco’s legs ― shuffled indoors. Once the group had shucked off their extensive collection of outerwear, most of which consisted of too many knitted items to count, Draco led them into the sitting room. There was a large fire crackling in the hearth, and Harry could feel that his fingers were, thankfully, beginning to thaw.
“ … Well, I was pretty sick after the war. Hermione suggested knitting as a way to cope, and I took to it like a house on fire. As I continued to improve with my knitting, I kept getting letters from the Auror Department saying they wanted to hire me. And, well, I just
After thirty more minutes of lounging in bed, Harry knew he needed to get up. Carefully, he detached himself from Stockinette, who flopped sideways as soon as the support of Harry’s head was no longer underneath her. As she let out a high-pitched chirp of surprise, Harry grinned sheepishly at her.
Once Ron and Hermione had stood up, wiping as much silver fur off of their jumpers and jeans as possible, Harry swiftly picked up Stockinette and opened the front door. After locking up, the four of them headed down the narrow staircase that led down to the shop’s backroom.
— to ease the pain of the situation. However, before he could do anything, Malfoy walked away, leaving him alone with nothing but his thoughts.
As he stood there, watching the sun sink completely over the lull of Diagon Alley, he began to mull over his evening plans. When he’d arranged to play a match of Quidditch with Draco a week ago, he’d only just come to terms with his feelings for him. Now, here he was, completely addicted to Draco's presence. Harry knew his flying wasn’t as good as it had been at Hogwarts; he was more than a little rusty, and it certainly didn’t help that his gaze would more than likely be stuck on Draco throughout the entire game. However, he was set on not losing, and he could feel a quiet fire of determination begin to burn in the pit of his stomach.
Harry sighed, his heart breaking at the sheer amount of pain sitting behind Andromeda’s eyes, and he couldn’t help but think of Sirius. After all, he’d had that same wily streak in him, determined to give his family hell for their foolish beliefs.
“What? Do I have something on my face?” Harry asked, instinctively rubbing the area around his lips.
. Blue numbers appeared in the air, glowing against the early morning light, and revealed that it was eight o’clock. Rolling his eyes in annoyance, he peeled back his duvet and slid out of bed, the soles of his feet meeting the icy wooden floor. He padded to the bathroom, relieving himself before wandering to his wardrobe and exchanging his pajamas for a pair of fitted black jeans, a light pink cable knit jumper that complimented his golden brown skin, and canvas high-tops.
“You should talk to Hermione about it. I’m sure she’d know a few people at the Ministry looking for apprentices,” Harry said.
“Wait, Pans—” Draco scrambled out of his seat, but he was too late. He watched as Pansy pushed open the café door and walked outside, her belted cherry-red pantsuit looking stark against the dreary overcast morning.
Harry grinned widely in response as he looked at Draco, who was dressed particularly well tonight. Wearing a knitted charcoal turtleneck and light grey trousers that fit him perfectly, Harry swore that the sight of Draco was leaving him dizzy.
Draco shook his head. “I did as a child, but not now. It seems silly to worry over who someone’s attracted to after all that’s happened.”
“Since everyone knows that Draco and I are officially together,” Harry began, anxiously shifting his weight from one foot to the other, “I thought that Christmas would be a good excuse to get everyone together, even if it’s for an hour or two at most.”
The platters began to arrange themselves across the table, and Harry was finally able to see what they were to be having for dinner: a lemon and rosemary chicken, creamy mashed potatoes with gravy, and buttery string beans with salt and pepper. Teddy began to clap his hands eagerly as he eyed the food in front of him, causing Harry to grin.
“You know,” Hermione said, her voice turning serious as she put a hand on Harry’s arm, “I’m really pleased for you, Harry ― we both are. You just seem so … happy.”
With a heavy groan, Harry sat up and rubbed his eyes. After a moment he reached over to his nightstand, grabbed his wand, and lazily cast
As Harry watched a large number of people pass by with bulging shopping bags, he was reminded of the fact that he desperately needed to begin thinking about Christmas presents for everyone. Hermione was easy ― books reliably left her overjoyed. The Weasley clan was a bit more difficult, although Harry knew that Bill and Fleur had been looking into taking Victoire to the Muggle cinema for the first time, so perhaps surprising them with fully funded tickets would be a good gift. Molly was in need of a new sewing machine, and Arthur had struck a curiosity for Muggle cameras, so those were daily straightforward purchases. Charlie, George, and Percy were mysteries, so Harry knew he’d need to do some poking around to find out what they wanted. As for Ron, he knew that Hermione was knitting him a hat, so that was out of the question. However, as he mulled the idea of a hat over, he realized that a knitted beanie would look particularly lovely on Draco.
After taking an hour to decide on what to wear ― eventually landing on a rich purple jumper and blue jeans that were slightly ripped at the knees ― Harry ventured out into the bitterly cold early afternoon. The sky had changed to a clear, light blue, but the sun only provided so much warmth as Harry made his way to the closest tube station. Strong gusts of wind prompted him to tighten the knitted navy and gold triangle shawl around his neck, and he quickened his pace.
When Harry had learned that there had been a building for sale in Diagon Alley that included both a storefront and a flat above, he thought it had been nearly too good to be true. Looking back, it had been the best purchase of his life, especially since he spent practically all of his time at the shop. Somehow, he had managed to luck into living in the very place that made him the happiest, something he swore would never be taken for granted.
they’d figured it out and it sent an ache of dread into his sternum. Weakly he shook his head in protest. “No, you’re wrong, I’m not - it’s not - it’s not like that,” he tried, but the words sounded feeble even to his own ears and after a few deep breaths he let his head drop again in resignation. He didn’t have the strength to keep arguing, not when it was taking all his energy to just stay standing, and when Aedan just stood there, Draco swallowed hard. “It doesn’t - what I think doesn’t matter. He wants me dead.”
“I might have to teach him a few of my industry secrets when he visits then, get him to live up to the Malfoy name properly.” He didn’t miss the concerned look she sent back at him as they made their way towards the kitchen again, cracking a smile after what felt like a long, long time. “Someone’s gotta teach him to break into our broomshed, I’m too old for midnight flying.” She laughed at that, and he pushed the Howler and other letters to the back of his mind as he tried his best to pretend everything was normal, just like it was before the war.
started whispering amongst themselves, noise bolstered by the rustling of robes and soft creaks of the wooden benches. On the edges of his vision he could see some members of the
“I’m fine mum, honest,” he replied, waving dismissively and holding still long enough for her flicked
Fuck. His gaze seemed drawn to Potter as he clung to the arms of the chair like a lifeline, and when their eyes shifted over, he flushed and quickly looked down after nearly being caught staring. He remembered the night they were referring to; he remembered every single second of it, and it had been one of the most terrifying evenings of his entire existence. Bellatrix had known, she had to have known that it really was Potter and that of course Draco would be able to identify him, and that’s why she had shoved him up close and dangled Potter’s life in his hands and made sure he’d be the one to suffer for letting him slip through their fingers.
“You know, my congratulations does extend to the future drinks as well.” His head shot up and they were looking at him with a slight smirk, leaning back in the wooden chair. “I am employed to protect you, Draco, and that includes listening spells whenever I am not by your side. I must admit, it is a nice change from earlier. I thought you were both going to begin dueling.”
He had chosen a dark green suit with silver detailing to really hammer home that Malfoy aesthetic he told himself, but in all honesty it was a nice suit. He wore a black dress shirt under it and snappy black dress shoes, his hair was slicked back as per usual.
Pansy interrupted his inner snide monologue. “Draco, don’t look now, but I do believe Ms. Beaver's teeth is trying to make an impression on the weasel.”
Draco had been expecting Granger to hold the Weasley back and so he stood up only to be punched in the nose. Nevermind that he had been expecting a magical rather than physical attack. That seemed to happen an obnoxious amount in his life. Ah well.
Draco still seemed preoccupied but his response was as courteous as ever. “Here let’s both head in, I'll take you back.” He knew she’d made that jib about the music for his benefit but he was too anxious to focus on something so small and inconsequential in comparison to the inevitable disaster that was to come.
“Harry as much as I hate to agree with the half-eaten sandwich,” Hermione started. Ron flicked the back of Hermione’s head, Hermione continued, “I would really love it if you would hurry it up a bit, we don't have a lot of time.”
McGonagall looked less than impressed. His grades couldn’t take much of this, or any of this really. He needed to fix this.
Sorry, I haven't updated in ages, commitment is hard. But I promise I will keep updating even if it takes forever! (lol, so good at this!)
Draco winced hard and gasped. Pansy looked at him worriedly, wondering if he was okay, or at least if he could be. Draco sighed heavily and kept rubbing his arm.
This one is a bit shorter I know, but I have a good reason for it(well a half decent one at least). Besides, there's no reason to make something longer than it needs to be; as ao3 keeps reminding me, brevity is the soul of wit. No worries though, I'll update again soon
Okay, a list, who could he trust not to report back to anyone? Pansy, Blaise, his mother, and Snape. A rather short list, and, in all honesty, most on it were immediately disqualified. Pansy and Blaise wouldn’t know what to do. His mother would involve going home and that was right out unless he wanted a mental breakdown. Then there was Snape, he was unpredictable, true he was close to Draco’s family but he kept his council to himself. Snape was also a teacher and therefore likely to go Dumbledore, which also didn’t quite fit Snape had always been loyal to the old ways, yet he seemed separate and distinct. Draco had spent quite a bit of time with his godfather as a child and he had always been half friendly with him. Draco sighed. Well, what did he have to lose anyway?
Lucius continued, "you will present yourself as though you were not a profound disappointment and you will bite your tongue if you are asked about it."
Harry couldn’t imagine the Malfoy family taking any vacation let alone a family one. The thought of them wearing safari shirts and playing in the sand seemed ridiculous, certainly the thought of that family getting tan was. Most likely they sat on the edge of a swamp looking moody and reading ancient human sacrifice tomes.
“Hello, how are you doing?” Draco asked. It felt strange to be so formal, but then again it felt strange to have a normal conversation in general so maybe it wasn’t actually so odd.
Lucius met his eyes over the newspaper, “Guests. Guests that must be given the right impression, and I’m sure they will introduce themselves once they get here, now run along and get dressed.” Lucius’s voice was cold and offered no vestige of leniency.
“I’m not sure,” he said it carefully as though embarrassed, “my father must be coming to Hogwarts otherwise there is no reason for the headmaster to speak with me.” he took a deep breath here as if stealing himself, “and if he is coming he only has 2 possible reasons. The first is that I have in some grave way dishonored the family and he has come to encourage me to better myself,” the ‘encourage’ felt bitter in his mouth, “ the second is that he has a task or a job.”
“Look as soon as you find out, come and find me, I’ll be here if you need someone to talk to. And we can do something to get your mind off it.”
The group began shaping their magic but since he didn’t know the spell he simply added his magic into the mix allowing it to be formed by the others into the correct shape. The magic blew a breeze that wasn’t real into his face, Draco closed his eyes into it comfortably. Suddenly the floor seemed to shift under him, he wrenched his eyes open and suddenly he was eye-to-eye with a man. He was uncomfortably close for a moment and then he swam out of focus and the view changed to the top of the man's head leaning over a desk. The man was working on something with his hands but he couldn’t see what he was doing. Then the tone of the magic shifted, and instead of precise ritualistic scholarly it took on a mal-intentioned craze directed at the man. Draco knew that if the magic caught up with the man he would die a very painful death and be ripped apart by his own magic. No, no, no. He didn’t even know the bloody man and he might kill a man but if he were to do it it would be in person. Draco panicked and yanked back from the spell, the room swam back into focus, he felt dizzy from the sudden change in surrounding.
They made it into the abandoned bathrooms in the castle without too much attention although someone had recognized her, another black mark on her reputation. She almost laughed but then Draco hissed beside her. He was sitting near the sink and taking off his robe.
Hermione dragged Ron off but not before he had muttered, “he always bugs me.” and Draco had responded by thanking harry for preventing the animal cruelty he was about to enact.
This was awful to write I'm sorry it took so long but it was really a pain. I did not expect it to be so hard to write an abuse scene, it made me feel really disgusting so the editing isn't very good and the writing may not be either. I'm honestly debating cutting it all together but ya know, quantity over quality right?
Acting as if he hadn’t timed it so they would overhear, he turned and feigned pleasant surprise at the couple.
“Why does Malfoy do anything? As far as i can tell he is as likely to be plotting Dumbledore's downfall as his dad is to be a death eater,” Ron shrugged.
“I was thinking that maybe he meant to sabotage that divination test we have later this week, ya know the one with the star interpretations? But he wouldn’t need his father to do that with him”
“Did it work?” Draco asked as she left the room. He could have kicked himself, why try to upset her.
“Guys, stop it,” said harry. Looks like wonder-boy had made his debut. Draco could feel the dreadful ruffle on Potter’s shirt against his back. Draco struggled a bit in his grip but couldn’t get free.
Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry guessed she was upset about the name but she only said, “Ron please at least finish eating.”
A few minutes before the library closed he checked out a few books, he would be back the next day anyway, no point in checking out the whole section. That night he said a quick hello to Pansy then read for another hour. He stretched, then decided to get to his homework, he may as well do his best to avoid too much detention.
Draco had gone back to his room and bandaged his hand. It hurt, but a lot less than the thought of being exposed or thrown out of Hogwarts. He paced up and down his room, then he promptly sat down on his bed and put his head in his hands, blowing out a breath. He was running out of time before once again he had no control. He had to do something, he couldn’t let his father take control and he wouldn’t be thrown out of Hogwarts for this, and yet if he didn’t come up with answers one or the other would happen soon. A pair of feet entered his line of sight and he straightened up immediately.
Screw it. He grabbed his wand and a cloak and left the Slytherin dorms, with his heart racing. He did his best to hide his face, unfortunately, his family's influence did not extend to the dreaded Filch. He walked quickly through the halls keeping his eyes open for any sign of Filch.
“Ron that’s not confirmed, stick to facts. It’s also entirely possible that Draco had to come home for a family vacation,” she said.
Draco felt his stomach flip but he came to the kitchen door. He found his father standing behind the countertop, and met his cold eyes over his battered arm and spotless kitchen floor. Everything seemed impossibly paradoxical. Surely this wasn't how his father wanted to handle this. They had never been close but this crossed a line. Between using his magic against Draco and hitting him, Lucius had to say something, explain some part that would have a logical root, something to make it even the smallest bit better.
As always i'm open to new ideas, and thank you for reading. The next chapters are better and i'll update more frequently.
Draco couldn’t answer, the sobs dragged out of him, he was shaking. Pansy looked horrified. Draco choked and tried so hard to regain composure but nothing was stopping it now. He looked away. He shouldn’t have asked her to come.
He didn’t insult her by saying thank you. Thank you was just a way to dismiss the significance of her offer. Instead, he simply sighed and placed his head on her shoulder. She placed her hand over his gently.

Hermione was also fuming but she wasn’t interested in getting in trouble and she guessed that Draco was just playing his own game and she didn’t want to be a part of it. She whispered something in Ron’s ear.
Hermione gave them both an incredulous look, “You mean you haven’t noticed?” She raised an eyebrow. Harry rolled his eyes at her superiority complex, though he allowed that it was probably deserved. However, as she had said earlier, lunchtime was running out.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek. He knew he should probably feel something but he was just tired and hurt.
He looked around and the fool of a teacher had their back turned facing the snack bar. Looks like it was time for some good old fashioned fisticuffs before the weasel really did attempt to carry through on that threat.
“YOU PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND MY CHOICES AS A FATHER??” the side of his head stung, “YOU THINK I DON’T HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE YOU AS I WILL?” Draco tried to protect his head with his hands but didn’t manage it, “YOU ARE A PATHETIC DISGRACE YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THE MALFOY NAME!” it felt like that slap went through his skull “EVEN WHEN YOU WORK AGAINST ME YOU CAN’T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. PATHETIC WASTE OF MY TIME.” His father's voice roared in his ears and with that last sentence instead of a slap he was shoved onto the ground landing hard on his arm which gave a sickening thunk. Draco knew to stay quiet, not to cry out. He cried silently curled on his side cradling his arm with Lucius’ voice echoing in his ears. He heard his father's steps fade away as he left the room. Draco began to cry, his sobs filled up the empty hallways and rooms and yet they still felt empty. Draco felt like he was choking, there was too much pain, his father’s words bounced around his skull and the face of the man he had almost killed, seared into his memory, burned him from the inside out, everything about him felt like an open wound spilling over with tears and the loss of the control he so valued. The loss of the only thing he’d ever had. He couldn’t feel the physical injuries or the tears falling down his face and pooling around him, everything was drowned out by the ache in his chest. Why couldn’t it all just go away. His sobs wracked his body until everything faded to exhaustion.
One of the days at the library Weasly had grabbed his shoulder and demanded to know what he was up to. Draco had winced and jumped at his touch. He regained his composure quickly (or rather a mask of one, he left to go sit on the bathroom floor shortly after), unfortunately, Hermione had been watching so she had definitely noticed.
Lucius led Draco to a point just outside of the border of Hogwarts then apparated without looking to make sure Draco would follow. Draco took a deep breath, and stealing himself for whatever was waiting, he apparated into the entrance hall. Then he walked to the dining room. His father was reading a newspaper, the picture of uninterested calm. It was as though he had been there all morning. When Draco walked in Lucius didn’t react. Draco waited, standing by the table.
Harry responded unusually calmly, “I heard him. Hermione, go enjoy the party with Ron. He won’t bug you anymore.”
“Hermione, we love you and we know you’re brilliant, now please take pity on those of us with a social life and answer,” Harry said smiling. Lucky for him Hermione seemed more interested in answering the question than in answering the method of his question.
From what Draco could tell the look in his father’s eyes was calculating and dangerous, but. Then the moment was gone, his father nodded curtly and turned back to what he was working on. Draco was obviously not worth intimidating. Draco’s arm was killing him so before he collapsed and killed his last shred of dignity, and passed out in front of his father, he left the doorway and sat down by the front door near his shoes. Then he put on shoes and apparated to just outside the bubble that Hogwarts inhabited.
“Well it seemed obvious to me, he only ever acts out in classes where he would be required to use magic,” Hermione said.
Pansy was playing with them, she’d raised her voice just enough so that the pair could hear. Draco quirked his brow and moved back to his original seat so that his back was to granger and Weasley. He knew this game well and was happy to play at it. He just had to wait until the weasel's nasty curiosity brought him over for a listen in to Draco’s “evil plan”. He looked around the room and caught Potter's eyes. He looked confused and suspicious. Draco didn’t justify that with a real emotion he simply quirked his brow at him then turned back to Pansey and the performance knowing full well that now he held each member of the golden trio's attention.
On the bright side, it kept him relatively busy, he tried to stay that way because when he wasn’t thoughts intruded and left him wondering what in the world he was going to do.
Moments later he stood in front of Snape's door. He’d been standing there for a while, he knew he should move, he knew he should. He stood there, his breath the only sound. This stupid decision could well make everything change. He hesitated for a moment more then shook his head. May as well go out with the bang of a scandal as go quietly into oblivion under his father’s care.
Harry nodded, “exactly, so i think my only half decent idea left is that he’s trying to get Dumbledore fired.”
Draco blinked, “We’re leaving now?” He had not expected that, maybe in a few hours, maybe some time to pack or gather his wits.
It turns out the guests consisted of death eaters. Death eaters Draco had no problems with, in fact some of them were rather kind to him, however these were unusually crass and seemed to jump at anything and everything. They were truly ruffians although Draco guessed they must have something his father wanted or needed. Draco spent most of his time nursing a glass of amber liquid until his father made a cutting remark about slobbish drunks and he set the drink aside. Quite frankly he was miserable, however he hadn’t been yelled at yet so things were going better than they might have. He sat down and watched the party pass only making conversion when necessary.
“Were you even paying attention? That time we had the surprise dementor practice and Draco said he didn’t particularly feel like joining and, although he richly deserved it, Lupin did not give him detention.” Hermione looked down at her timepiece.
In the most innocent voice he could muster without completely losing it he said, “My goodness, speak of the devils. We were just saying what a perfect couple you two are. Weasel, I mean, Weasley, in that lovely er,,,antique, and our darling granger in that, hmmm how to describe that ensemble? Gaudy? No. intriguing? Not quite.”
Draco froze the only time Dumbledore wanted to see him was when his father did. He tried to throw on a nonchalant uninterested air of importance. Lucky for Draco his poor attempt at concealment was unnecessary, Potter was too preoccupied to notice his expression. Pansy, however, wasn’t. She frowned but didn’t say anything and Draco was too anxious to notice her looking at him.
His father had hit him before but never to this degree, it was generally less and mostly verbal. He shied away from his thoughts, like maybe if he didn’t think about it it wouldn’t be so bad.
A few hours later Draco had a headache from reading, he was exasperated and growing increasingly apprehensive about tomorrow. At least a few hours ago there had been some chance he could find the answers but now he debated what he could do, he had very few options, Pansy wouldn’t know what to do and he didn’t want to scare her, and the library, though lovely, seemed to be useless in regards to this question. There were a couple of other laughable options but nothing concrete, no one he wanted to tell everything to.
“I’ll do it,” she said, clenching her hands around her wand. He didn’t thank her, he never did, but she knew he was grateful.
“Alright all of us that have read the spell will lead and the rest simply cast your magic so that we may shape it. Do all here understand?”
He sat sobbing on the floor of the room once again, he was unable to process the room. He had just almost killed someone and his father had forced him to. The betrayal of his very existence made him shake. How could that happen? How could he be forced into using his magic? It made him feel disgusting as though he had done the thing himself. Like he was unclean, he couldn’t wipe that act away and thanks to his father that was now a part of him. The world seemed to swirl around him.
Three hours later he looked up from the books and his neck cracked, the library closed in two hours and he was no closer to finding any sort of answer. He looked at the stack of books surrounding him dejectedly, this was near impossible. Everything was wrong, he should be researching for his potions class or for some nefarious scheme, not here. Not here, not now. Memories came, unbidden, to him of his father's face and voice, of the cold ferocity of his voice. Nothing was okay now, how could it be? And like usual he had to fix it on his own, even though he had no idea where to start, even though tears threatened to overflow every other second, even though he couldn’t eat because he was so anxious. He swallowed down his fear and picked back up the book taking care to read every word to block out his own thoughts.
“Oh and I suppose you think I owe you an explanation?” Draco said. Hating himself as the hopeful look faded from her face to be replaced by hurt. He watched her closely.
Draco had no choice. He inwardly apologized to Pansy. He wouldn’t be able to explain until later why he never showed up to let her know what was happening.
Draco let out a bark of laughter, “no, no. He would have owled if there was anything that mundane to convey, it hardly constitutes a reason for the head of the Malfoy family to visit if it can be said in a letter.”
“I can’t. Now look,” he must have seen the panicked look on her face, she really didn’t want to do this, “I’ll talk you through it, please, I can’t do it on my own.” Again those eyes of his spoke volumes, he was scared, probably that she’d say no. His face was tracked with tears and dirt and he was still fighting tears. Damn it.
“I'm simply interested to find out what research holds Draco’s attention,” Hermione said. She finished packing up her books.
“Merlin, definitely an improvement although only enough to bring her up to passable and completely overshadowed by that horror of a dress.” he indicated her straightened hair and smaller teeth.
Draco felt like his feet were made of lead as he walked towards Dumbledore's office. Maybe his father was just here to inquire about Potter or perhaps complain about the quiz he had gotten a 4/6 on last week. This was ridiculous. He shook himself and, back straight, knocked on dumbledore’s door.
Harry sighed, “I would honestly love to have a good answer. It feels like we have all the information but none of the answers. We know he spends every waking second, not in a class, researching. We also know that for whatever reason he’s decided to give up on all of his academics.”
He explained how the spell would work, and what the important parts to make sure she got right was. She went over it a couple of times in her head then steeling herself she met Draco’s gaze. He nodded- a clear go-ahead. He was braced against the wall, jaw clenched. More advanced wizards were able to make it less painful but she had no such expertise. She closed her eyes and steeled herself for a moment, then she opened her eyes and before she had a chance to back down she said the words and weaved her magic into the spell making a web that gripped harshly around broken blood vessels and bruised bone snapping them back to normal.
Draco who had been looking down at his sleeves finally looked up. More than anything he was uncertain. Every time he tried to do something his father would appreciate it backfired and instead Lucius looked at him with disbelief that a Malfoy could be such a disappointment to the family name. He could never make his father happy whether he tried or not. The only hope he had was that occasionally his father had a job for him and so decided to be civil.
“Have fun!” Dumbledore's voice made its way down the stairs outside the office. Trust Dumbledore to completely misread and misinterpret every situation. Lucius grimaced and picked up the pace.
Harry glanced over at Malfoy and found himself marveling at the speed with which he wrote. Still, this effort was becoming rare, the past four classes he’d been acting out. This puzzled Harry, yeah sure the guy was a prick but now he was doing something he never did before; jeopardizing his grade simply to piss people off. Harry shook his head and tried to go back to whatever the teacher was saying.
“Malfoy you bloody bastard, take that back, or I will make you,” He said with barely contained anger, like he was biting the end of every word.
Harry stretched his arms above his head, yawning. They were almost done with their essays and Ron was running to grab snacks.
By the end of three days, he had twelve days of detention and no answers. Four of the detentions were given to him by dear Snape. Granted Draco had deserved them, but it was beginning to ruin his reputation as a student. Luckily tomorrow was a Friday so he would get a break from the constant gaze of his teachers. He didn’t know if he could make it another day.
They were trying to kill that man. Some man Draco didn't even know. Someone who wasn’t even part of the conflict that he knew of and yet they were using an unforgivable curse on the man. Draco couldn’t seem to catch his breath, his father stared at him coldly for a moment. Draco shook his head a clear ‘no’. Lucius frowned then flicked his wand and suddenly Draco’s magic was being dragged out of him mercilessly. It dragged him back towards the spell. Draco clenched his wand in one hand and the bookshelf behind him in the other hand trying desperately to hang on to this reality and keep his magic from the ritual. Fucking hell, his father was trying to force him into killing a man! His father was forcing his hand into murder of someone he didn’t even know! Draco gritted his teeth and held tight to the present reality. He wasn’t even sure what his plan was, he just knew he wasn’t going to be even partially responsible for this man’s death.
“You’re quite right my dear, I was being quite callous, it is the best she could do. Although one wonders why, surely to the weasel is not superior to a beaver, in fact, I think I would be hard-pressed to find a more fitting couple than a stinky weasel and a mudblood beaver,” about halfway through he met potter’s eyes in a lazy challenge and was rewarded with a look of wrath but no action yet.
He walked past the door of the kitchen heading for the hall where his shoes were. His father's voice from the kitchen stopped him.
“But that’s not right, he was in defense and he didn’t do anything to ditch then,” Ron said. He was still rather busy with his sandwich.
Draco started, “Father…” then he broke off and started laughing which immediately turned into tears again. Pansy, alarmed, awkwardly put her arm around him, wondering what in the world to do.
“We are having guests come over for dinner, they will want to meet you, be ready in an hour.” He still hadn’t looked up from the newspaper.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Me?? I’m the problem? Last time I checked I’m not the one who just shoved my son's soul into the middle of a killing spell! Last time I checked I'm not the one trying to kill someone not part of the war! Last time I checked I DIDN’T ENDANGER MY SONS LIFE FOR A--” a sharp slap interrupted his last sentence knocking him against the brick wall. Malfoy made a strangled noise of anguish. His hearing and vision went hazy. His father's voice continued to follow him through the haze, each sentence punctuated by a slap.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Draco, I know you can’t tell me everything, or maybe anyone else either,” ah, so it was odd, “but you can only keep this up for so long, so please find someone who can help you with part of it. I will be here, and I will cover up whatever I can for you, and listen to whatever you want to tell me, but I suspect you’re leaving things out.”
“Draco,” she was scared, Draco was never like this. He was always the one to pick her up, but he needed her now, so she swallowed and continued, “let’s get you home.”
The next punch weasel threw he ducked with as much grace as possible given the table but wasn’t paying enough attention to anticipate it when the weasel grabbed Draco's shirt and punched him in the face. Draco's nose started to bleed. His brand new shirt was in those grimy hands. That’s it.
He spent the next couple days trying desperately to dodge detention, get out of having to do magic, keep up his appearance, research, and finish his homework. Things were not going great, and on top of that, the stupid defense against the dark arts teacher thought he couldn’t cast a Patronus because he had made some excuse.
“Ya know how you said Malfoy was acting weird? Like, all distracted and pale?” Hermione nodded, “ Well I saw him the other night in the observatory and then today he was going somewhere with his dad.”
Later that night the party was in full swing. It took place in one of the larger sitting rooms. The chairs and sofas were dark brown mahogany and dark green velvet upholstery. The room itself presented as more of a library; the walls were covered in books. The dark oak floors of the room were offset by the high windows showing moonlight. While the room was high quality the guests were of a different breed.
“‘Mione, leave off, I don't have enough time to both eat and talk at different times,” Ron answered.
“Now, where do we start?” she asked finally, almost in a whisper. She knew she was being weak. Draco would have done it efficiently but all she could offer was her best effort.
Dumbledore continued, “you will of course be expected to keep up with your school work and catch up on the classes you will miss. But other than that I think you’re all set.”
Draco was back to school the next day. His arm ached a bit and he felt numb, but his main focus was hiding any evidence from anyone that might be looking for it. Last night he’d tried to use his magic but using it had only hurt him. Something must have happened when his father used it. He was worried that if he pushed too hard the magic would come unstuck from him altogether. Draco kept trying to get to the library to find information but every time a teacher would give him a look or one of the Gryffindor crew would be following him a little too closely for comfort, and so he attended all the classes of the day with relative normality. Unfortunately in transfiguration, he had to get himself kicked out in order to avoid using magic but that was easily done. He simply sabotaged the precious Neville’s attempt at a pin by asking him too many questions.
Draco got his chance to explore the library at the end of the day. At the library, he began to look for books having to do with inhibited magic and the bond between a wizard and their magic. It was honestly rough going, every time he thought he found something it turned out it was about repairing a wand or restoring trust between the wand and a wizard. He sighed and sat down with a stack of books at one of the farthest tables from people. He knew he was in for a long afternoon.
Draco tilted his head, pretending to mull it over, then he opened his mouth and carefully enunciated “no.”
I'll add another chapter today as well to make up for being late and uploading a chapter i might delete.
Hermione rolled her eyes but let the conversation move on. Harry let the comfort of their voices roll over him. He sat comfortably and let himself drift in and out of the conversation sleepily.
“You,” he rounded on Draco, “YOU! You disgust me. YOU are a useless vile worm not fit to even playact the Malfoy name. How dare you! How dare you openly contradict me?”
“I’m going to what?? Draco, seriously, go to Pomfrey!” Pansy said incredulously as she looked at the swollen arm bruised face and cuts.
He was jarred from his thoughts when he felt pansy place a gentle hand on his shoulder. She looked worried and scared. Draco turned away, he knew he was covered in bruises.
, and they wore a black leather jacket that stole more of his sanity the longer he stared at it, until Draco cleared his throat quietly and they looked up. “Hello,” he said, awkwardly twisting his hands together behind his back. The rectangular, wooden table had four chairs at it, two on each side, and suddenly he wasn’t too sure about sitting directly across from Saint Potter.
Ah. He was mildly surprised by the question, wondering where Potter had been hearing gossip about him. “It was called off shortly before my trial started,” he said coolly, watching as their expression changed to confusion. “Her family didn’t want my tainted blood to be mixed with her respectable family name.”
Draco looked up from his drink to meet their gaze. “You are allowed to call me Draco, if you insist on trying this ‘friend’ thing out.”
Of course the Boy Who Lived was waiting when Draco and Aedan arrived at the cafe, his stupid hair all messed up and standing on end as he sat with his back towards the door again. Instead of the leather jacket from last time, the one that lingered in the back of his mind despite all attempts to erase it, they were wearing the same basic all-black trousers, undershirt, and robes that aurors-in-training would wear, last name most likely embroidered in gold on the left chest. Even from here he can see three of the plastic glasses on the table, already half-full of water and placed where each person had sat the last time they were there, and after a moment he realized it was the exact same table as well.
The thought made him choke on air, coughing into his elbow even as pink dusted his cheeks yet again, and he tried not to let his mind run away with the daydream. “Merlin Pansy, keep your bloody voice down.”
“Oh fuck off Potter, you don’t have to pretend like you care for my sake.” They visibly flinched and he swallowed the guilt with a large mouthful of chai. It was warm, the cardamom lingering in a way that tasted of fall, and he found himself longing for the last family orchard trip when he was thirteen. “It wasn’t this elaborate assassination plot that you could’ve prevented. I walked into the bookstore, got my things, left, and got dragged into an alley by a couple of people calling me foul names and talking about how I’d pay for my family’s crimes during the war, the usual. I managed to break free and apparated out the moment I could, no harm done.” He was lying, and he was sure Potter knew, but for now he could hold back the memories of the fingers threatening to scalp him, of the punches and kicks and bruised ribs he was hiding under his turtleneck.
Draco cleared his throat, grabbing the glass of water and pulling it closer to him, thumb gliding along the lip of the glass. “Anyway.” Potter raised an eyebrow but he ignored it. “You’re done testifying, Potter, why did you call me here to talk? Did you miss the company?” The words came out with an unintentional sneer, eyes quickly lifting to see their reaction, which was simply biting their own tongue again. It physically hurt him a bit to say it, to keep up this facade of disgust and condescension he had worn for so long because he
“But.” That one word made his heart skip and Draco didn’t know how he felt about it, because there was something different in it, a tone he’d never heard from them before. “They’re all gone, all those bad influences are gone, well at least most of them are, and I’m hoping now that they’re all out of the picture you’ll change.”
a bunch of people, some reporters that didn’t agree to his demands, some muggles in the wrong place at the wrong time. There were a couple times I took some nasty curses in place of my mother, with her right there to watch. There were more than a few times I thought him or Bellatrix were going to kill me with my own wand.” He left it at that because it was easier than explaining why he had to switch bedrooms within the manor, or why he could never sleep a full night anymore, or why he refused to eat any sort of beef, or anything that was vibrantly orange would make him tremble. Taking a long, desperate gulp of his drink, he wished he had just gotten a bottle of straight vodka, some of the intense American brand Etherclean or whatever shit Blaise had brought over the last time they had met.
That day had started no different - he’d roamed the library with a thermos of tea tucked under his arm, using it as a welcome warmth to combat the typical October morning chill, plucking down a paperback from one of the further shelves at random. It was undoubtedly a muggle book, something he had never heard of called
The courtroom had shifted into a solemn silence, and Draco’s the one to finally break their gaze and look to the floor again; they were right, it was all he said, even when he was told to stand watch so Bellatrix could torture Granger in ways he didn’t want to think about. “If he hadn’t lied for me, looked his parents and Voldemort’s second-in-command right in the eye and said I wasn’t Harry Potter, I would’ve been killed that day. Probably like the moment he identified me I would’ve been hit with the killing curse or a
were standing and applauding. Draco twisted to see what they were looking at and watched, open-mouthed, as Potter made his way from the audience seats onto the polished floor, then past his chair into the designated area for witnesses to speak on the side of the room, almost perfectly halfway between the accused’s chair and Shacklebolt’s spot. What was the Boy Who Lived doing at the trial for a Death Eater, let alone the one that he’d been feuding with for nearly ten years?
The same witch that spoke earlier shuffled through a stack of parchment held in one arm before looking up. “Now, Mister Potter, can you give us a little background about yourself please? Explain your relationship with Mister Malfoy, that sort of thing, whenever you’re ready.” She gave him a short nod, and Draco noticed that Potter looked slightly uncomfortable.
Her face shifted through a myriad of expressions, finally settling on a wrinkled nose as she looked him over. “And what did the Golden Boy want?”
“We’re on a break,” they said in a way that made his tiny flame of hope grow brighter and made him sure it was something a lot more permanent than a break. “She lost one of her brothers in the Battle of Hogwarts, we both survived a war, we needed time and space to figure ourselves out. She hated the spotlight anyway, wasn’t a fan of all the press that tends to follow me around.” Draco was quiet when they took a large, sighing drink from their bottle, but he didn’t miss the way they leaned heavily into the back wall of the booth - there was something else there, something that they seemed to be holding back, but he didn’t push it, especially not when he could feel those green eyes gazing at him so intently. “What’re you doing, now that you’re graduated and freed? I could help you get a proper new start with the aurors or something, your times with Voldemort would be a big help to the department.”
reactions and witnesses testimonies, then suddenly I see ‘Harry Potter Clears Young Malfoy of Death Eater Charges’ as a headline? Who did you pay off?”
all stood, talking amongst themselves, more than a few shooting furtive glances at him, and his cheeks burned as he stayed trapped in the chair.
“Everything okay, Mister Malfoy?” The witch’s high-pitched voice jerks him back into the courtroom, wrists instinctively pushing up against the manacles holding them to the chair, and when he opens his eyes the fifty faces of the
“We can start over.” They looked completely serious. “I mean it, no war, no Chosen One or pureblood bullshit, no Hogwarts, no Slytherin or Gryffindor or Voldemort or Dumbledore, just you and me, like on the train. Hi, I’m Harry Potter, nice to meet you.”
“See, Malfoy, I know you’re not sorry, you don’t have to play dumb with me. I know all about you. You can’t use your parents as an excuse, since they weren’t at Hogwarts with you ever, and they definitely aren’t with you now, which means you were an arse of your own free will.” They leaned in then, even closer than before, and Draco had to fight every fiber of his being to stay where he was. “It’s like I’ve said before, your father’s vile, and cruel, and you’re pathetic. It’s a miracle you had enough backbone to stand up straight on your own without needing Crabbe and Goyle to hold you up.”
Here it is, the long-awaited chapter to make you cringe! As is the general theme of the story, there are some mild panic-attack elements sprinkled in, and some alcohol references. Hope you enjoy!
Hey everyone, like the last chapter, this features potentially panic-attack-inducing language, and there's some pretty vivid descriptions of a panic attack happening. There are also some hints at suicidal ideations mixed into the panic attack sequence, but they're more offhand comments than fleshed-out thoughts. Besides that, I hope you enjoy!
“Yes.” Draco’s blood ran cold. No one, absolutely no one knew about that exchange apart from Professor Snape, and that had been because the man had saved him from bleeding to death on the bathroom floor - unless Potter had told someone. The spell itself had barely even landed, and any pain they had felt was from his sheer panic because of the
“I -” He struggled to keep his voice nonchalant, wracking his brain for a way to brush off his mess of an appearance, and he can feel nothing but the loud, hurried thudding in his chest. “I’m fine, just - just a stomach bug, I’m sure.” The words came out as shaky as he felt. Another gag shuddered its way through him and he could barely swallow it down, the effort nearly making his knees give out.
The witch smiled down at him, and this time it struck a chord of fear into his bones. “If Mister Malfoy has nothing to say to us then I suggest we end the hearing here for the time being. The
Draco was only kept waiting outside the pub for a few minutes before Potter came strolling up, wearing a soft-looking T-shirt under a yellow-and-cream flannel button-up, and he could barely resist making a comment about Hufflepuff as he nodded his head in greeting.
“You’re a menace,” he shot back, swapping his wine glass for the shorter glass of water next to it after clearing his throat. “He wanted to tell me that he was giving me a second chance, even after he testified that I was a bully that tried to kill him. Apparently saving him from the Snatchers cancels out the snake I sent after him in our second year.” Pansy knew about what had happened at the Manor, and what had happened to him after Potter had escaped, but she only hummed as confirmation that she was listening so he decided to get the worst part over with. “After I was freed he wanted to get drinks to just finalize everything, that was this past Wednesday, and I let slip that I fancied him.”
“Crystal-” she choked out and he instantly stepped back to release her, arms out and ready to catch her as she slumped back against the wall with a gasp. “Merlin’s dick Draco, I’m not - I’m not as alive as Potter, you can’t keep doing this...”
They raised an eyebrow at him. “You know you can report that to the Ministry, right? They’ll help up your wards and look for the sender.”
Interesting, Bellatrix’s gut instinct had been right. Draco’s eyes were drawn to the witch that was leading the proceedings as she shuffled through her stack of parchment. “Right, but aren’t you claiming that it was Mister Malfoy that actually saved your life, not Miss Granger’s Stinging Jinx?” she pointed out, and Potter nodded.
The atmosphere change, from something light to this tense, stifling air, had him on edge. “Sure, yeah.” Something underneath the table nudged his leg and he looked down to see a pile of black fabric being held out to him. “Wha -”
He watched in disbelief, then embarrassment, as the auror laughed a little, shaking their head. “I am not here to pry into your thoughts, Draco. I just wanted to see if you had eaten lunch.”
He watched as the auror paused before slowly nodding, leaning against the doorframe with their arms crossed. “I believe we should at least be cautious going into tomorrow. They must be an extremely powerful wizard to get through the wards set up around the manor.”
The ache from before, when they had figured it out, reappeared in his chest, and Draco dropped his head to look at his hands as they circled the plastic cup. “Since the end of our fifth year at Hogwarts, just over three years,” he replied quietly, and he hated himself more for each day that passed. “Too long. It’s - it’s been too long.”
He could hear the soft click of her heels as she followed, and he assumed Aedan had fallen in-step behind both. “Draco, please,” she tried. “Be reasonable, I just don’t want you to end up like your father.”
He gagged again and barely managed to swallow the bile before it escaped completely, grimacing at the foul taste, and he could feel his hair stuck to his forehead with sweat. “Fuck,” he panted, squeezing his eyes shut, forearm pressed to his mouth as he tried to take deeper breaths and willed his heart to slow the fuck down. A muffled whimper slipped past his lips and he wiped at the wet tracks down his cheeks, coming from tears he hadn’t realized had started to spill from his eyes. This sudden panic from the idea that they
Hey everyone, hope you enjoyed! Please consider leaving a comment or kudos, I love hearing everyone's thoughts as time goes on.
Just the thought made his stomach grumble eagerly. It had been so, so long since he had eaten something other than a homecooked meal from his mother or himself, especially a dish with as much flavour as a curry. “I don’t think I’ve had Indian food since before the war,” he admitted, shrugging when their head whipped around to reveal an astonished expression. “Don’t look at me like that, I was virtually on house arrest for the last few years. You really think the Dark Lord would just let us get takeaway for dinner?”
Aedan had the most fascinating, slate-coloured eyes, and Draco met their gaze when it shifted up to his own; he couldn’t sense any malice coming from them, only a cautious curiosity. “I see,” he replied after a beat passed and their words had time to sink into his tired mind. “The Ministry has never-” Both men jumped as the kettle whistled loudly, Aedan chuckling softly in what he assumed was embarrassment, and Draco ignored him and quickly added his Earl Grey teabag to the cup before pouring in the boiling water. “As I was saying, the Ministry of Magic hasn’t been particularly concerned about the safety of their accused criminals in the past. Why the change of heart?”
“Yes.” In his defense, it hadn’t intentionally been directed towards Katie Bell, she had just been an unfortunate near casualty.
Potter let the silence hang between them for a bit, the hum of surrounding conversations attempting to fill in any awkwardness, and Draco’s mind raced with the scenes from Potions, from the Room of Requirement and the tower and Umbridge’s raid on Potter’s Army and the Golden Trio’s visit to Malfoy Manor and the train in sixth year and every other moment that could have doomed him to the same fate as his father. “Ron and Hermione will probably never trust you again,” Potter said suddenly, and the passion that had been in his voice had quieted. He kept his eyes closed and just listened to them talk again, because something told him that if he looked up at them right now he’d bolt for the door. “Pretty sure you’re the most horrible person they’ve dealt with, and I don’t blame them for hating you, I would if I hadn’t met a lot of your Death Eater friends. Look, you - we’re eighteen, Malfoy, we were kids that had to fight in a literal war instead of going to school, and I just - now that it’s over I want you to get the chance to change like the rest of us, now that you’re got time to properly grow up.”
“Just a vodka cran, please.” He settled onto the hard wood and watched as they went to the counter, exchanging some low words with the bartender and coming back moments later with the drink in a short glass, a small straw leaning against the rim. “Thanks.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.” The man was only a few inches shorter than him but Draco enjoyed it, crouching slightly so they were eye level. “Next time, try to mind your own business. Don’t be a hero.” He straightened, circling to stand behind them with his wand tip pressing gently into the back of their head, and he could hear a muffled sob come from the man. “
It seemed as if they wanted to argue then thought better of it, opening and closing their mouth silently. “I would write an answer before the owl flies off,” the auror said finally, slipping their wand back into the sleeve of their robes and shrugging. “Since all of yours have been temporarily confiscated.”
“Is that why you didn’t testify at the trial?” Potter asked quietly. “You were afraid of that all coming out, that you... that you fancied me.”
Without waiting for Aedan to look over the room he started weaving his way across the cafe, carefully easing between the other tables and customers, and every step had his heart slipping further and further up into his throat. It felt like an eternity before Draco sat down across from Potter, pulling the chair out and settling into it with one fluid movement he half-expected to send him sprawling onto the floor instead.
“He tried to kill me the morning of that final trial day,” he replied bluntly, pushing his hands into his pockets because they seemed to be constantly shaking now. “You probably saved my life just now. Savior Potter, back again from the dead.” He couldn’t muster up any of the bite he used to have, now that his secret was out and they knew it was all fake anyway. “So. What now?”
pretty much dead on, and then he’d wanted to make sure I was actually dead, yknow, since I am the Boy Who Lived.”
and absolutely towering over the room once he was on his feet. The tip of their wand pressed into his cheek and then his voice boomed. “Silence!” they roared, voice magnified enough to echo around inside Draco’s skull, and the wizards and witches he could see had their hands clapped over their ears. Everything became so quiet he swore he could hear the blood rushing through his body. “There will be no one speaking apart from the investigator and the witness, and if there are any further outbursts, I will not hesitate to remove people from this courtroom.” As they sank down into their seat again they gazed over everyone with a stern expression, pulling their wand away from their cheek and nodding at the witch on their right. “You may continue.”
“Always are. It’s nice to be doing this with you again.” He waved his wand to vanish the ropes and gag before slipping it back into his sleeve, waiting for her to catch up as they started towards the entrance of the alley. “Next time I have news I’ll save it for after you’ve eaten and are too tired to come after me.”
“I’m fine,” he replied quickly, closing his eyes to steady himself and shaking his head. “We’re just - we’re going to London again soon.” Potter had written to him again, had even asked to meet, he hadn’t messed everything up, and the world spun for a moment.
, what Granger and Weasley and Pansy are doing now since they’ve graduated, really anything other than
Hearing You-Know-Who’s name again paired with thoughts of the war almost immediately sent him spiraling into a panic attack, and beneath the table his fingers clawed at his thighs as he tried to calm his heart down. “Are you really sure you want to hear it?” he asked quietly, not that he’d tell them much, and after they nodded he closed his eyes. “For starters, he wanted me to kill you, or at least bring you to him. Drilled it into me every time I came home for breaks. Had me lure and
He mimicked them despite how shaky he felt after the visions, rolling his shoulders back. “Don’t worry about it. I’m not out long enough to see the sunset much anymore, this was nice.” Almost on instinct, he turned to face them, finally able to look them over completely. The wind had picked up a little more, tousling their hair in the way a Quidditch game used to, something lost and distant in the Gryffindor’s gaze when they finally met his eyes.
Hey everyone, thank you for being patient with me! There is some choking/suffocation in the first half of this chapter. Hope you enjoy!
” in a warm red and yellow glow. “Well, here we are. I’m paying, by the way, since I can assume you’ve never handled muggle money before,” the Gryffindor said, holding the door open for him with a little bow, and there was only a little bit of mocking in their tone. “You can get it next time.”
“Well hello, Mister Malfoy.” Her voice was pitched higher than normal and sickly sweet, and she drew out his name in a way that made a nervous flutter appear in his gut. “Nice of you to join me.” Her dress is skin-tight and made of black silk, a slit cutting high up her thigh and revealing a decent amount of skin as she recrossed her legs when he sat down in the chair opposite her, unbuttoning his jacket as he did. “I’ve taken the liberty to order some wine, since you took your sweet time in joining me.”
When Draco left forty minutes later, Harry found himself feeling sorely disappointed and threw himself into helping customers for the rest of the afternoon.
“It was around then that my mother began to fiddle with the idea of a floral arrangement company. She’s always been an avid gardener. When I was a child, my father would chastise her for not letting the house elves tend to the garden. She never budged, though, insisting that it was her work and hers alone. Since I had nothing better to do, I wound up helping her research how to go about creating the company. The laws were a bit tricky to navigate given her criminal status, but we wound up figuring out how to manage around it.
. The levitating shelves surrounding the stall were clad with bright, shiny cauldrons glazed in a variety of different colors. Some even had patterns painted on them, ranging from stripes to animated Cornish pixies flying about.
“Yes, well, no one says no to Father,” Draco muttered. “If you write Andromeda and my mother tonight, then surely we’ll be able to pick a day for the visit tomorrow.”
While there had been a small line for the bakery, the rest of the restaurant was jam-packed with people seeking shelter from the cold. The host showed them to a small, two person booth in the back corner of the restaurant, giving them a surprisingly decent amount of privacy. As they took a seat across from one another, Harry realized just how hungry he was.
“Sure. So, do you want to set a formal schedule for your lessons, or do you want to just come by whenever you’re feeling like it?” Harry asked.
Draco frowned, setting his half-eaten plate on the coffee table. “I know, Potter. This wasn’t anything out of obligation.”
Harry let out an incredulous bark of laughter. “That’s rich, coming from you. Need I remind you of that one time ―”
“Thanks,” Draco said wearily. “I imagine Mother will have you work on the tree while we do the more intricate work, like individual bouquets and wreaths. How does that sound?”
, Pans.” Pansy sighed, rolling her eyes as she signaled for the check. “Listen, darling, I hate to go, but Granger is expecting me soon. We’re to go over this month’s budget for our next charity auction. Surely you understand.” She stood up, draped her handbag over her shoulder, and leaned down to press a soft kiss to Draco’s cheek. “Thanks for grabbing the check. I owe you one. Toodaloo, love.”
And here it is - the final chapter of The Way We Wind. If I think about it too hard I'll burst into tears, and I can't have that given the sheer amount of prep for my English final I have to do today.
Draco looked particularly lovely, clad in an eggplant colored jumper and form-fitting black trousers. Harry watched as Draco greeted Hermione and Ron, his face lit with what Harry recognized as both nervousness and excitement. Stockinette had hopped down from her spot on Ron’s lap and was now parading around Draco’s ankles, occasionally butting her head up against his legs in request of pets.
“Well, it would appear that Mother is on board,” Draco said. “And just so you know, the only time I mention you is when I’m complaining about what a git you are.”
Before he knew it, their clothes had been vanished and he was being dragged by Draco down the hallway and into his bedroom, where Stockinette was stretched out on the windowsill in a patch of pale sun. Somewhere along the way, Harry had lost his glasses, but he didn’t particularly care; he had far bigger things needing taken care of. He was pushed backward onto the bed, and Draco quickly followed, leaving a trail of kisses down his neck and along his jaw. Harry felt drunk on the softness of Draco’s skin, as though no matter what, he couldn’t possibly have enough.
Harry let out a light laugh. “Yeah, I suppose you could say that. Hey, what about your love life? Weren’t you and Parkinson a thing back in school?”
“Fine, fine,” Draco said dismissively. “Anyway, how’s the shop been? I know I haven’t stopped over in a little bit.”
The tips of Malfoy’s ears grew a steady pink, and he shot Harry a soft smile. “You’re not too bad yourself, Potter. Dinner sounds lovely.”
“Sure,” Harry said, picking up one of the presents he’d so carefully wrapped and handing it to Draco. “Here you are.”
Harry led them out of the bedroom and down the hall. There, they found Andromeda sitting in a stupor on the couch, a glass of undrunk water in her trembling hands. Her tears had dried, although there was still red rimmed around her dark eyes.
“What can I do for you?” Harry asked, pressing a gentle kiss to Draco’s collarbones. “How can I make you feel good?”
“Well, I’m sorry to see you go, Draco. I’ve had a lovely time,” Hermione said, setting down her knitting and standing up.
Harry waited another moment to see if Andromeda needed help. However, it was clear that she could use a minute to herself when he could hear soft sobs coming from the bedroom.
An hour later, Harry and Draco found themselves deeply immersed in the tall bookshelves of Flourish and Blotts. While Harry skimmed the time-turning section, trying to find a suitable book for Hermione that she hadn’t read yet, Draco was poking around the ancient herbology section, which sat a shelf over.
Harry grinned, excitement thrumming through him as he quickly grabbed a piece of parchment and pencil. He, Ron, and Hermione hadn’t eaten dinner together in quite a while, so this was a luxury that he had sorely missed.
Thankfully, Crookshanks gave a single sniff before wandering down the hall that led to their bedroom. Stockinette took this as her cue to curl up on the couch’s right arm.
Silently cursing her, Harry blinked his eyes open. He hated to admit it, but the sight of Hermione immediately made him feel a little warmer. As usual, she was still in her work robes, and her corkscrew curls were pulled away from her face, sitting in a knot on top of her head.
There was a silence as Draco stared at Harry’s cock, which was jutting out and red at the tip. Then, “You’re beautiful, Harry.”
Draco rolled his eyes before turning towards Ron and Hermione, who were still engaged in a pointless battle, and raised his eyebrows. “What’s with them?”
