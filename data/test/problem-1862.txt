Harry thought. The only thing giving Harry comfort and telling him that Draco was, in fact, not dead was the rise and fall of his chest.
shared a room with Harry Potter—he’d thought it was a miracle.
Harry turns to Andie and mutters under his breath.
His glasses aren’t dissimilar to Draco’s own, Draco notes, Draco’s are just less round. He has more scars now too. There’s another one on his forehead, near the famous lightning bolt. It’s an old one, lighter than the skin around it. There are smaller ones all around his face, but they’re only really noticeable when you pay attention. He also has a piercing on his eyebrow, and another on his bottom lip.
she questions, catching Harry off-guard, which causes him to start coughing violently.
“A metre thirty. Scared, Malfoy?”
. It’s a completely rational reaction to have when you had to watch a giant snake of a madman that was living in your house, devour innocent people almost every day for two whole years.”
“Hey, it’s the common room, I have as much right to be here as you do,” Harry pointed out lightheartedly, taking a couple steps closer to Draco.
When the Wizengamot let him stay out of Azkaban—on the condition that Draco both returned to Hogwarts for the new Eighth Year
Right now, for example, Potter is lying face down on his bed, shirtless and in his pants, sucking obscenely on a sugar quill. Draco has had sugar quills countless times but never once has he felt compelled to make sounds quite like the ones Harry is making.
Draco halts. No one would be
It doesn’t really matter what people would expect of him though, or rather, it shouldn’t. This has been Draco’s reality for almost 20 years now, ever since everyone in The Wizarding World started seeing him as an irredeemable war criminal. It
Malfoy’s response comes with Earl sooner than Harry expects it to.
Hermione gave Draco a sympathetic look and passed him his drink. Draco took a large gulp and Hermione watched as his features relaxed slightly. “I don’t know how you do it, Granger, but your drinks always manage to make me feel better and I’m not even drunk. What do you do, slip potions in them or something?”
He has to do something to fix this. He doesn’t know if he can take this another day, let alone for the rest of the school year. He supposes he can talk to McGonagall and ask if he can have a room transfer without the Ministry finding out about it, or ask if they could put like a divider in the middle of their room or something. He doesn’t know how he’d say “I’m too gay to function with Potter around” when asked for his reasoning though, so maybe not.
Potter takes a big step towards Draco, towel still not quite covering his parts. “Well, that depends. Are you turned on?” He takes another step closer. He’s less than half a metre away from Draco now, and Draco has half a mind to step back. “If you’re not,” another step forward, another step back. “Then I have no clue,” another step. “What you’re talking about.” Draco’s breathing is heavy as Potter takes yet another step closer to him and Draco falls back on Potter’s bed. “But if you are…” Harry trails off, leaning over top of Draco, his face mere centimetres from Draco’s.
he’s very much the only person that can help Draco with this. And it’s not even for personal reasons, is it? Draco’s doing this for his client, he needs
The address is 723 Knockturn Alley. I’ll be there until 8 tonight.
“Whoops,” Hermione said sheepishly, shrugging.
He finally gets to the building and greets the receptionist in the lobby before heading towards the lift.
eyes. It’s been ages since the war, some of us would prefer to leave it in the past, thanks,” he says before muttering, “Merlin, I never should have contacted you,” under his breath.
With Draco’s luck, he really shouldn’t be surprised that it’s Potter. Alas, he is and he once again can’t do much more than stand there and gawk at his roommate’s arse. Of course, Potter chooses that exact moment to let out another salacious moan, his hands roaming over his chest and back. Potter isn’t doing anything essentially sexual, but Draco thinks that Potter couldn’t be more erotic if he was having the wildest wank ever.
Harry scowled at Draco and opened his mouth to retort but Hermione didn’t let him. “You are both adults! You’re my friends, not to mention former Auror partners. So stop acting like children, bloody grow up and be civil with each other, will you?”
them with a simple wave of his wand. “I told Teddy he couldn’t have more sweets before dinner, he got mad and you know how his accidental magic has been getting stronger lately…” Harry trails off.
“You’re staying here over Christmas break?” Harry asked instead of answering Draco’s question.
“You know, snakes used to remind me of Voldemort too,” he says, wincing. He walks to one of the armchairs and sets the carrier down on the side table before plopping down on the chair. Malfoy stays standing by the now closed door. “This isn’t really common knowledge but I used to get visions of what he was doing, sometimes through his eyes and sometimes through Nagini’s. To say it was unsettling would be a severe understatement.”
Draco stared at Harry without saying anything before he lifted his gaze to the ceiling, making Harry look there as well. All this time trying to get Draco under the mistletoe and it had happened just like that without Harry even trying! It was a Christmas mi-
“I know, Harry, I did hear you, you know, when you spoke to me. Granted I don’t remember most of what you said but I did hear you,” Draco said softly before his tone turned teasing. “Though I’m not sure anyone could remember a lot of what you said with your rambling, unconscious or not.”
“So, what can I do for you, Malfoy?” Potter says leaning against the pillar that has the leashes with his arms folded.
He chucks out the letter he wrote in response to Potter’s, feeling his cheeks heat up. “Here,” he says, because well, he hasn’t had a good fucking in almost a year and Potter’s too fit for his own good, and his stupid mind isn’t working and the best he can think to say is bloody
“Yes, that would be great.”
Harry woke up to the sound of someone calling his name. “Draco? Are you back?” He mumbled sleepily, trying to feel the area around him for his glasses before realizing that he never took them off.
🐍HARRY🐍
“So you drugged us instead?!” Harry yelled, promptly shut up by Hermione’s hand on his mouth.
“Draco,
Andie says.
Harry pulled the Marauder’s Map out from his bedside drawer as he lied on his bed way after curfew the following day. He watched Draco’s little dot walk back and forth in the room he shared with Blaise, abruptly stop and then make his way into the eighth year common room. Harry glanced over at Ron who was fast asleep in the bed next to his before stuffing the map back into his drawer and tiptoeing out of the room.
“I can think of a couple fun ways to stop your rambling, though I’m not quite sure my body would allow me to do either one. So do try not to go on for ages, love.”
He doesn’t bother tying the letter to the owl's leg; he’s heading there anyway. He tells Earl not to wait for his response and watches the owl fly away, another squirrel-shaped treat tucked in his beak. Draco walks over to his desk to take his jacket and bag, and also put the Firewhiskey back in the semi-hidden compartment under the desk. He leaves the office, with a curt goodbye at Adelaide.
Malfoy stops dead in his tracks and turns back to face Harry in one fluid motion. “I’m not afraid, Potter. I just find them
Potter smiles a wide smile, before hissing at Nymph, possibly to translate for Draco.
I told you not to send back an owl and you made your owl stalk me to my flat? Has no one ever taught you manners? I guess you were mostly timely with your call to Adelaide, though, so maybe someone taught you some manners.
be Head Auror and we’d all be free of Robards.”
“The saviour of Wizarding Britain, ladies and gentlemen, defeated by a child’s accidental magic,” Draco muses.
“Never you mind, Potter,” he says dismissively. “Let’s get to work, shall we?” Draco says, looking around for a place to drop off his satchel and suit jacket. He walks up to a counter that seems safe enough and puts everything down.
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco says, wrapping his arms around Potter’s neck and pulling him down by his still-wet hair.
“Harry! I didn’t know you’d still be here!” Luna Lovegood steps out of the Floo, brushing off excess Floo powder off her dark blue cargo pants. “I just stopped by because,” she starts before her eyes land on Draco. “Oh! Draco! You’re here too!”
Draco practically runs out of the showers. He doesn’t slow down until he gets to his shared room with Potter. And if he’s caught a glance of The Saviours cock before running out, he tries not to think about it.
Draco lets out a sigh, depositing his satchel, coffee cup and glasses on the desk. He shrugs off his coat and sits down, putting his head in his hands. He needs someone that knows about snakes and can provide snakes for his sessions with Sky. And no magical herpetologist or snake breeder in the UK was willing to work with him. Most of them hadn’t bothered to respond to his owl and the ones that did… Well, they had less than kind words to say. He was his last hope. Letting out a deep breath, he sits up straighter and picks up a sheet of paper from his desk drawer. Picking out his favourite fountain pen, he begins to write.
“Wait, Draco,” Hermione said, her plan already formed in her head. “Won’t you stay for one drink? It’ll be on the house.”
PS: If you are coming, you can just come through The Floo using the address I gave you in my
“So, you kept an eight-year-old kid from having some sweets and he made them explode on your face,” Draco says, very obviously amused. “Where is he right now then?”
DRACO L MALFOY
Harry took in a deep breath and held Draco’s limp hand in one of his own. “I was going to ask you something today,” he started, feeling the ring box through his pocket. “I’m not gonna tell you what, just in case you can hear me, I don’t want to spoil the surprise. It’s nothing bad, I-I mean I don’t think it’s something bad and hopefully, you don’t think it’s bad either. It was just kind of important, I guess, but it’s nothing that can’t wait until you wake up. Well, it kind of has to wait now but, um, what I’m saying is it’s okay.”
“Hey, you alright, Malfoy?”
So Harry made his way over to the castle gates after breakfast, telling Ron and Hermione that he was going for a walk. He didn’t really have a plan, he probably should’ve made one, looking back. Instead, he went right up to the gates just as Pansy and Blaise were stepping out with Draco right on their tail. Most of the other students had already made their way onto the train so there was only a couple of sixth year Hufflepuffs saying their goodbyes other than the three Slytherins. There was mistletoe hanging from the gate and not that many witnesses. It was perfect.
“Well, yes, but does it really matter? Are you going to kiss me or not, Potter?” Draco asked with a smirk.
I wouldn’t have pegged you for someone that watched the window waiting on a response. Not from me at least.
Another one of the one word prompts I got
Harry doesn’t respond, choosing to look away instead, so Andie changes the subject.
Draco stops listening to Lovegood and Potter babble about snakes, in favour of watching Potter and his muscular tanned arms as Nymph slithers down his arm and rests her head on his hand. Draco’s eyes follow as Potter absentmindedly strokes Nymph’s head with his thumb.
“Malfoy,” Harry started, his brows furrowed. “What are you doing here?”
Lyra meowed in response and followed Harry into the study where Harry’s floo was. Harry sat on the armchair across from the floo with Lyra lying on his side and just waited and waited and waited until he fell asleep.
Sky grabs their purse and flashes Draco another smile, before bidding him goodbye and leaving Draco alone with the words,
I will need you to join a session, Tuesday, April 19th 2016 at 2 pm, if you are able.
he thinks dumbly,
Harry groans, realizing he made a mistake with his choice of a younger snake. He wishes he went with Hestia, the four-year-old ring-necked snake, instead, seeing as she’s only a couple inches bigger than Andie.
Are you coming?
“Granger, what you did is still very illegal and it could’ve gone very wrong. You will never, ever, put potions in people’s drinks
Harry hadn’t known how to deal with it at first, Draco wasn’t really the “let’s talk about our feelings” kind of person but it had become more and more impossible for Harry to ignore Draco frowning at a potions book or a letter that came in the afternoon. Making Draco feel better was a lot of trial and error:
Draco walks into the showers after the “friendly” game of Quidditch between the eighth years —they aren’t allowed on the house teams because they’re not actually

“Might be a good idea, I’ll see if Sky’s in the waiting room.”

Harry knew was a snooty prick who thought he was superior to basically anyone.
“Ah, of course, Saint Potter with his orphanage.” Draco sneered halfheartedly, downing the rest of his drink and pushing the glass towards Hermione. “You know, The DMLE never was the same after he decided he was too good for the Aurors. Maybe if he hadn’t left to look after a bunch of children,
“I see you still like to snoop, Potter.” Malfoy fixes Harry with a subtle glare, though Harry thinks he looks a little silly because his glasses are sitting low on his nose and his white-blond hair is in his face, so the glare is probably not as effective as Malfoy would like.
after all, but it’s still shocking to him.
“Hello, Cassiopeia, I hope your journey here was more pleasant than mine this morning.”
Draco lets out a laugh, it’s mainly out of shock. “No, no I’m not. At least, not that I know of.”
Though he manages not to go through with the urge to touch, his mind still lingers on the exposed skin, wondering if the lines of the tattoo were bumpy or felt no different than the rest of his skin.
———————————————————
Operation mistletoe was
Draco rewrites the letter, this time leaving out the parts that he struck out. He also decides to use his official name stamp along with this signature. He figures Potter might be more inclined to help if he sees that this isn’t some plot that Draco is devising but someone actually needing his professional help. He reads the letter through one more time and makes a couple of minor changes.
“Thank you, Adelaide. I’ll be in my office, should you need me for anything. Although I do have some work I need to get done so please see to it that I don’t get disturbed unless absolutely necessary.”
she says, leaning over his shoulder to face him.
With that Potter sits up and fucking crawls to the edge of his bed. He raises his hand up towards Draco’s forehead. The moment that Potter’s fingertips touch Draco’s forehead, Draco jumps back and walks backwards into the bathroom they share, tripping over his feet ever so slightly. He yells about being fine all throughout.
Andie pipes up.
“Fine, but I’ll wait by the door of the operation room.”
Harry reaches for the milk on the tray, putting some in his tea and takes a sip after he deems it milky enough.
Harry repeats, this time making sure to sound more confident than he felt.
echoing in his mind. Because regardless of whether Potter qualified as an associate, Draco is indeed going to be meeting him. Today.
“She says thank you,” Potter says with a smile. Nymph hisses some more and Potter laughs. It’s one of those loud, carefree, genuine laughs. The kind of laugh you have when you don’t care who hears because you’re having so much fun. Draco doesn’t know if he’s ever laughed like that. It’s a nice sound. “She,” Potter starts, cutting himself off with another laugh. “She’s asking if you’re also an albino.”
“Well then, just remember that I’m only doing this now, here, because you couldn’t wait. So you can’t blame it on me,” Harry said before taking in a deep breath and locked his eyes with Draco’s. “Draco, I love you more than anything you know that, right?”
“Harry, he’s going to be alright, Healer Milner’s in there with him and his vitals were fine the last time I was in and if something had gone worse they would’ve alerted me,” Hermione said, as Harry brushed off the ashes on his muggle jeans.
“What if I told you I didn’t care,” Draco said. “You made me very curious and I think that I can’t wait any longer for it.”
—————————————————————
“We weren’t good Auror partners,” Harry noted.
At this, Harry looks up at Malfoy, immediately meeting his gaze. “Can I let him out? He’s a lot more likely to behave if he’s not annoyed.”
Come over to the shop when you can so we can discuss which snakes would be the best to have at your sessions.
“You could put it that way, yes. I Flooed him over to Ron and Hermione’s a couple minutes ago after the, um, incident. They figured we could use a break.”
🐍DRACO🐍
Draco can practically hear Potter’s grin, and he doesn’t need a mirror to know he’s blushing. “You wish, Potter. Not scared, merely curious,” he says, hoping that he’s believable.
“Sorry,” Potter says, looking as if he’s holding back a laugh. “She’s eight and a half.”
Potter,
Getting from the apparition point to the clinic proves to be harder than Harry thought it would be. The streets are much too crowded for this time of the day and people are either paying so little attention to him that they just about knock Andie out from Harry’s hand or staring and pointing.
“I’m coming through, Hermione,” Harry said, already reaching for his wand and the floo powder.
He represses the urge.

Draco latches his lips onto Harry’s candy-coated neck and Harry shivers, his eyes fluttering shut. Draco hums against Harry’s neck as he trails his lips up to Harry’s, leaving kisses in his wake. He kisses Harry hard on the mouth and then leans back just far enough to be able to speak. “You taste like fucking Fizzing Whizzbees,” Draco whispers against Harry’s lips, before pulling Harry back into a kiss. “It’s making my mouth all tingly.” It’s all passion and lust and trying to make up for the week of no sex.
“I-I don’t know, Mr. Potter, sir. Healer Milner just told me to fetch Healer Granger, sir.”
“Hermione. I’m coming,” Harry said in a way that left no room for further argument. He watched as Hermione’s face disappeared from the flames and Harry walked into the flames and came out into Hermione’s office on the other side.
Harry felt Draco’s hand twitch and looked up at Draco’s face to see if maybe whatever charm they used to keep Draco unconscious was wearing off. Harry was half expecting to see Draco awake and rolling his eyes at Harry for being sappy. He wasn’t awake or rolling his eyes at Harry. He was just as unconscious as he was ten minutes ago.
Not many people that knew him when he was a spoiled child would expect to see Draco like this; riding the tube on his way to his job at a

themselves in the communal showers, right? Another moan cuts through the silence and Draco turns toward the source of the sound because it sounds familiar. He walks silently to the last stall, where he sees the Chosen Arse yet again.
Sky leans in closer to leave about half a metre between them and Harry. “He kind of has a derpy look to him, doesn’t he? Like his eyes are too big and round for how slender he is.”
“I do,” Potter confirms. “But Nymph lives with me. She goes wherever I go unless I absolutely need to leave her home.” With that Potter turns around and heads toward the back of the store where it’s sectioned off with a black curtain.
“Yes, Potter, would you rather I was in France with my mother, or perhaps in Azkaban with my father?” Draco sneered, walking away without waiting for Harry’s answer.
“I was wondering when you’d finally crack. I was starting to think that you were straight after all,” Potter says with a smirk, making his way onto the bed. Draco wants to feel the smirk on Potter’s lips on his own and make it disappear.
“There’s a cafe I often go to for lunch right around the corner.”
Sky takes a deep breath, looking from Harry to Malfoy to Andie. “Okay, do it.”
“I don’t have my wand,” Potter yells back. “I’ll burn myself if I try to do that wandless.”
“We found the spell that hit Draco. Well, we don’t know the incantation, it must have been a custom spell that was developed by the castor or one of their accomplices. But we’ve found how it works more or less,” Hermione said before Harry interrupted her to get to the point.
Malfoy makes a dismissive gesture, which Harry takes to mean yes. So Harry waves his hand to cast a wandless
“No, Potter, I did not hate you,” Draco said, almost angrily. “I might as well have begged you to be my friend in first year, I think it’s safe to say I don’t hate
“Malfoy, want a chocolate frog?”
“This is Nymph,” Potter says, kneeling next to the snake holding out his right arm to let it crawl on him. “She’s an albino Honduran milk snake. Nine years old.” At that, the snake raises its head to look Potter square in the eyes and hisses.
“Granger was right about that, you know, I don’t give a rat’s arse that you’re The Saviour, you’re still good old annoying Saint Potter to me.”
Draco opens his mouth to say something about the artwork being very nice before he’s interrupted by the Floo roaring.
“It seems that our time is up, Sky. We made a lot of progress today. For our next session, you have two options, we can either continue with more videos or, if you’re feeling ready, I can ask my… associate to bring over something more real or realistic,” Draco says, hoping that Sky didn’t notice his hesitation at the word associate. Is that what Potter is to him now?
Now, Draco thinks he’d prefer rooming with
“Yes, yes, bye now.”
“Uh, he’s small and not really moving much? And that’s good because it doesn’t make me feel as terrified.”
Malfoy heads outside, leaving Harry alone, save for Andie. In Malfoy’s absence, Harry starts looking around with Andie occasionally lifting his head to peek around. He walks over to Malfoy’s desk that matches the dark wood of the door. There is a leather cover planner and a gold pen next to it, which upon further inspection Harry realizes is engraved with Malfoy’s initials. There are framed (muggle) photographs of him with Narcissa Malfoy and another with a woman with black hair that Harry thinks is familiar but can’t name.
“Bugger off, Potter.” Draco said staring at the fireplace with a blank expression.
“In a little bit, yes, Healer Milner’s just running a couple more tests to see if we’ve missed anything and you know diagnostic spells take a little time. Once he’s done we’ll just remove the
“Oh, yes, I’ll put Andie back and be on my way,” he says, trying not to dwell on Malfoy’s use of his first name. “Lovely meeting you Sky, I will most likely see you again in an upcoming session. That is, if M-
, he thought looking at his watch that showed that it was nearing 3 am the next day. He couldn’t lose Draco, not now, not ever but especially not now.
But they were being stubborn idiots and they wouldn’t get anywhere on their own, so
“Sorry to burst your bubble, Potter, but I’m pretty sure Greg doesn’t swing that way,” Draco joined their conversation. “Potter,” he gave a polite nod at Harry who was staring at Draco, apparently startled by his sudden appearance. “Hello, Granger,” he said, turning to Hermione.
Draco hummed in confirmation while Harry stared at him in surprise. “It’s not even Christmas, Draco,” Harry mumbled, not knowing what else to say.
“Curious, Malfoy?” Harry asked with a raised brow before responding. “I was just telling Hermione that I can’t date in the Wizarding World because everyone sees me as Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort, and I want to be seen as Harry, just Harry. Hermione said that our old classmates wouldn’t care that I’m Harry Potter. And that’s when I joked about Goyle and yeah, you were here for the rest.”
Potter hums in confirmation. “I have six,” he says. “You’ve seen the one on my lower arm, that one I got when I decided on this as a career path.” Potter gestures to the room they’re in before he continues. “This one,” he starts, pulling the hem of his shirt up and his dark muggle jeans down a few centimetres on his right side. Draco stares at the inked flesh Potter just revealed. It’s a bouquet of lilies, the stems disappearing under the hem of Potter’s trousers. Draco gets the overwhelming urge to reach out and touch the lines of the tattoo.
seemed to be working. Until one day Harry offered Draco a chocolate frog, not actually expecting anything to come out of it.
Harry wonders why he had to choose the sassiest animals on earth as a career. Why not owls, or crups, or even kneazles?
, and Merlin, it’s making Draco lose his mind. There’s also the fact that he keeps sauntering around their room half-naked—at best. It’s not even a month into the school year and Draco has seen much more of Potter’s chosen arse than he can handle. It is getting to the point where Draco thinks that Potter somehow found out that Draco’s gay and is doing this on purpose to
This makes Malfoy snap his head up to look at Harry with disbelief and pain. “Would you kindly fucking stop, Potter? I would really rather not hear about you seeing me being forced to torture people or whatever horrible things you saw through
Potter raises his hand and waves it once, murmuring the incantation. A fluffy white towel comes flying into Potter’s hands. He uses it to wipe his face and rubs it at his hair carelessly, not bothering to cover himself. Meanwhile, Draco is still gawking at the Chosen Prick.
to give potions to muggles. But she wasn’t hurting anybody; on the contrary, she was helping them. It wasn’t like anyone would actually find out either, as Hermione was pretty good at being discreet and kept all of her potions in her trusty little bag (that, of course, has an undetectable extension charm on it).
Multiple things happen at once.
he thinks to himself upon casting a wandless
Alas, Draco was not awake, or at least he didn’t look it even if he was. Harry let out a sigh and put his head in his hands, rubbing at his temple.
“Har har, that’s hilarious, Draco. Look, can’t you just cast a Scourgify or something?” Harry asks huffing. “I don’t really wanna point my wand at my face when I can’t see.”

Cassiopeia squawks.
, Potter, just the fact that you wanted nothing to do with me.”
“Wait, um, I go on my lunch break right after I’m done with Sky here, we could grab lunch together if you wouldn’t mind waiting,” Draco offers with a pinkish hue to his cheeks.
“No, Potter, it was an uneventful day, I’m back in my flat now,” Draco said. “Can I come though? I brought you dinner.”
“You can’t be bloody serious, Potter.”
Draco lets out an involuntary moan when he just can’t take it anymore. He pushes up ever so slightly on his elbows, latching his lips onto Potter’s. They kiss fervently for what feels like ages before Potter pulls away, leaving their foreheads touching.
DRACO L MALFOY
Malfoy,
“The snake is here?” Draco asks, hesitating. Maybe he should have mentioned to Potter that he himself isn’t… fond of snakes. “I thought you kept the snakes at a reserve.”
“Yeah, she does,” Harry says. Now that he has a name to go with the face he remembers Parkinson, though, “Did her nose always look like that?”
Potter’s lips quirk up as he reads the letter, and Draco feels like a huge idiot again. This was a bad idea. Writing a response to Potter’s letter when he was going to come over within 10 minutes was a mistake. Coming here tonight was a mistake. Contacting Potter was a mistake.
“I know, Harry, I’m sorry this one was a failure too,” Hermione said sympathetically.
Harry walked into the common room to see Draco sitting in the armchair with his face in his hands. Harry wordlessly cast a
“I did,” Harry sighed. “It had to be cut short because the guy only wanted to hook up and I don’t want just that anymore. We’re almost thirty, ‘Mione, I want a real relationship. I want someone I can come home to, someone who isn’t half my height and covered in dirt.”
so much that you actually stopped being an Auror.” Draco’s eyes widened as if he wasn’t expecting to say all those things.

their respective houses anymore.
Harry heard a door open near him and raised his head up from his hands. Hermione stepped out of the door adjusting her lime green Healer’s robes and sat next to Harry.
“I just might, Harry.”
Draco’s last appointment ends ten minutes later than it’s supposed to, at 18:40, and not a minute too soon. Draco thinks that he’s about to suggest Mr and Mrs Huckabee get a divorce as couples counselling might actually just not be working for them. Once Mr and Mrs Huckabee have calmed down enough to go out in public, Draco slumps down onto the sofa he normally reserves for his clients and takes his wand out from the pocket of his trousers to summon the bottle of Firewhiskey he’s been craving since before noon.
“Shall I go try to seduce… Goyle, then?” Harry asked teasingly.
This is the other thing, it feels so out of the ordinary to see Malfoy being so nice and encouraging with anyone, let alone a muggle. Harry knows he should’ve been expecting it, this is his
Draco hummed before changing the subject. “You said last night that you were meaning to ask me something?”
“What?” Harry said, baffled.
OAK COUNSELLING
He summons some parchment and a quill from his desk, startling Nymph who was asleep on the coffee table in front of him and gets to writing.
I know what exposure therapy is.
“I was trying to impress you, you prick!” Draco yelled, his words only registering a couple seconds after he’d said them. “I don’t know why I said that. Why would I want to impress you, I wasn- I wasn’t-” Draco’s brows furrowed when he couldn’t say what he was trying to. That was odd, it had felt like he physically couldn’t get the words out of his mouth. That only happened when- “Granger! I can’t believe you would do something like this!”
Hermione nodded, more amused than afraid of Draco’s threat. It wouldn’t be amazing for business that she had to stop using potions but that was alright, this was worth it.
Draco had opened his mouth to decline but paused. He’d instead opted to give a curt nod, letting Harry know it was okay to toss a packaged chocolate frog to Draco. Draco had grabbed it with the ghost of a smile on his face and murmured “Thanks, Potter.”
“I didn’t know you still spoke parseltongue,” Draco says. “I mean, people were saying you lost the ability after, you know…”
Draco wonders if it would be too unprofessional to put some Firewhiskey in his tea, or better yet, some tea in his Firewhiskey.
“I agree,” Draco says. “Go on.”
He wishes Blaise or Pansy or Goyle were there so they could knock some sense into Draco.
“Fine,” Draco says begrudgingly before halfheartedly calling out to Ginny and Luna.
“Sorry, Harry, it’s Hermione. They brought Draco into St. Mungo’s about te-“
Hermione knew better than to say that it wasn’t exactly the same thing. “You do realize that you can quit being an Auror if it doesn’t make you happy, right?”
“No, Potter, you are not fine. Besides, I don’t want you to infect me with your disease.”
Harry and Draco let out simultaneous laughs making Andie look up at Harry, curious about what just happened.

“You’re already doing very well, so we can leave that for another day if you want Sky. This all needs to go at your pace. But two weeks ago you wouldn’t have been able to even be in the same room as Andie.”
“Shit, Malfoy, sorry,” Harry says, feeling a little ashamed when Malfoy turns back and takes a couple more steps before stopping in front of a door.
Harry frowns and rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. “Sorry.”
he hisses loudly, once his coughing subsides.
“She’s a bit sensitive about her age,” Potter mouths at Draco, standing up.
“But you
Potter hisses and halts.
“Now, wasn’t that nice?” Hermione said smiling at them.
“You wear glasses?” Harry asks before he can stop himself.
“Raining outside?” she asks, smiling in a way that accentuates the wrinkles around her eyes.
Potter, mind your own business, would you?”
Harry’s head snapped up at the sound of Draco’s voice seeing the tired but genuine smile on his face. “You’re awake!” he exclaimed, lunging at Draco for a hug before remembering the condition that Draco was in and slowing his motions, which resulted in a somewhat awkward hug. But Harry didn’t even care that it was awkward, because Draco was hugging him back — not very tightly but that was to be expected — because Draco could hug him back, because he was alive. And then Harry was kissing Draco, he was kissing his lips, his cheeks, his eyes, his neck, every little bit of skin he could find.
“Good morning, Adelaide,” Draco says with a small smile, putting down his coffee at the front desk to remove his glasses.
He fails.
“Oh, come on, I had to do something to make you two stop acting like a couple of idiots. You weren’t gonna get anywhere if I left you two to your own devices,” Hermione said, putting her hands up in front of her chest towards Harry and Draco in a way of shielding her from them.
“Do you actually think I’ll drink that?” Draco said rolling his eyes. “Merlin knows how much of your germs it has on it now. Go home and rest, you’re obviously very sick.”
“What’s this?” Potter asks, straightening the letter out.
He’d tried outright asking what was wrong, that hadn’t really been the best idea.
He realizes that he forgot to put his glasses back on only when he walks outside and the London fog seems thicker and blurrier than usual. He walks to the alley behind the clinic and casts a slight adjustment charm on his eyes, not bothering to go back. With a sigh, he disapparates, picturing the apparition point in Knockturn Alley. It’s only when he’s standing in front of 723 Knockturn Alley, looking at Harry Potter rearranging what seems to be a variety of snacks and treats for reptiles, that Draco realizes he could’ve just apparated into his office and grabbed his glasses. It would’ve been easier than the adjustment charm he cast. He can actually still go back, he realizes, just when Potter turns around and fixes his eyes on Draco. Except now Potter’s seen him and… Oh, Merlin fuck, he’s Draco Malfoy, why is he so bloody scared of seeing Potter again?
I’m afraid I require your help. I have a client that is afraid of snakes, and we’re trying exposure therapy. In case you don’t know what exposure therapy is, it is a very common and effective way of overcoming phobias, by exposing the client to the source of fear in increments. So, in this instance, we started out looking at pictures of snakes in our first session while there was a plastic snake on the table between us. We will move on to videos today and I’ll ask them to hold the plastic snake. Eventually, I would have them hold a real snake. We’re going to have to move on from pictures and videos to real snakes soon, if not next week, then the one after, and I have yet to find someone willing to work with me. I hope that you will be willing to leave our history behind and help me.
“I think it would be best to have the snake in its cage at the start of the appointment, so in about 10 minutes you should put it back while I go fetch Sky.”

Draco is certain that Harry Potter is trying to kill him. They’ve been roommates for about two months now and Draco feels that he’s about to die of sexual frustration at any given minute. Potter’s taking a shower and while Draco is really trying to pay attention to his Potions essay, he can’t seem to think of anything but the day he walked in on Potter in the showers.
“I’ve come to have a drink to ease my nerves, Potter, as I do quite frequently,” Draco said, in the most Draco Malfoy way that Hermione had seen him speak in a long time. “Is that a problem for you? You don’t think I’m up to something, do you?” he asked, raising a thin brow.
The latter was happening currently. Harry checked his watch — second anniversary present from Draco, because they’d once had to obliviate everyone in that very restaurant after Harry cast a
“Great thanks! I’ll check that out. Goodbye, Sky. Goodbye, Draco.”
but she paid it no mind. “Come on, now, you know how much the orphanage means to Harry,” she said, putting a drop of Draught of Peace into the freshly made old fashioned. Apparently, today was a "two drops of potion" kind of day. “You know better than everyone how unhappy Harry was as an Auror. You were his partner before he resigned,” Hermione pointed out.
“It seems like a variation of the
he doesn’t really know how to get there, past figuring out the nearest apparition point that morning.
Draco gives her a curt nod. “My first appointment isn’t for two more hours, yes?”
Draco muttered an incantation, pointing his wand in the air between him and Harry. “What are you…” Harry started, stopping as he saw the festive plant appear above their heads. “Mistletoe?” Harry asked, his heart thumping so loud he was sure Draco could hear it.
——————————————————————
though,” Potter says, swinging open the door to the bathroom and Draco’s jaw drops. Because Potter is standing at the door in all his naked glory. Drops of water are falling down his too long hair onto his sculpted chest, travelling down to his soft-but-still-quite-impressive-in-size cock and Draco can’t––doesn’t really want to either––look away from it.
Hermione opened her mouth to respond but heard another customer come in and smiled apologetically instead. “I’m sorry Robards is a shit, Draco, but don’t take it out on Harry. Now, I have another customer so I’m afraid I’ve got to go.”
Then Potter hisses again, except this time it sounds different. Draco realizes a couple of seconds later that Potter is speaking parseltongue.
“Harry, what the bloody hell have you done?” Draco asks, taking in his boyfriend’s appearance. Harry’s drenched in a shiny, red, sticky substance, standing at the door of Draco’s office.
“Well, it’s bad luck if I don’t, isn’t it?” Harry said before meeting Draco’s lips, accompanied by a chorus of ‘finally’s from their friends.
“I… I, um, Imight’vehadatee-HUGEcrushonhimandnowitmightberesurfacing,” Harry said, letting out a breath.
“N-no, I just, uh, hadn’t seen you around here before,” Harry stumbled through the sentence, making it sound more like a question than a statement.ik
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry starts as they walk past multiple closed doors. He knows he shouldn’t pry but he can’t help himself. “Isn’t it a bit weird that you’re treating this patient from their fear of snakes, and you’re also afraid of snakes?”
It takes him a moment to notice that Potter is still talking.
Pansy and Blaise,” Draco whined.
About two months later, Draco and Harry were almost friends. Harry didn’t know what had changed but obviously something had. They’d gotten into the habit of studying together; along with Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Blaise. That evening when they were all studying in the common room, Draco put his quill down and looked at Harry.
“It’s just a minor cold…”
“Yes,” Draco said and continued before Harry could express his excitement. “But you can’t have any before you finish your soup.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco leans in even closer to whisper into his boyfriend’s ear. “I bet you’ll taste even sweeter than you normally do.”
“What does something more real entail?”
on the carrier.
Draco’s eyes widen as he realizes what exactly he’s said. “I-I mean, put some clothes on, Potter, you’re highly indecent.”
On the day that everyone left, Harry still didn’t know if Draco was staying or not. He’d overheard Pansy and Blaise saying they were leaving so there was quite a big chance that Draco would too. So this might’ve been his only chance to get Draco under a mistletoe and kiss him so that he’d actually have an excuse to kiss him.
“I’m up, I’m up! Stop screaming. What happened, do you need me there?” Harry said sitting up straight on the couch and grabbed around for his glasses. Draco’s face was sticking out of the green fire.
“Hey, Malfoy, me and Hermione are going to the library to work on the Herbology essay, wanna come work with us?”
of Voldemort. But then, I found Nymph left behind in an empty nest, trying to get out of her egg that just wasn’t cracked enough. Her mum must’ve thought her not strong enough to survive.”
“Anyway, Potter, now that it’s established that the weird thing here is not my being in this pub, do tell me; why are you planning to seduce my friend?”
“No, I’m-“ Harry said before getting interrupted by a sneeze then sighed. “…fine. I got you tea.” Harry said gesturing at the paper cup full of English breakfast tea.
, forgetting that they were surrounded by muggles. It was 22:07, two hours and seven minutes after when they were supposed to meet. Harry bit his lip, worried, going through every single awful thing that might have happened to Draco in his head. He got up, apologizing to Joy, the old lady that owns the restaurant for having to leave while dismissing her questions of whether Draco was alright, trying to reassure her (and himself).
“Well, I had an inkling but I figured I might be a close second to your non-profit for Muggleborns,” Draco said with a teasing smile.
“That’s putting it lightly, Granger,” Draco started, distractedly looking at Hermione make his drink. “Robards is being a prick again, but what’s new,” Draco huffed, taking his eyes off of Hermione, giving her the chance to add a drop of Draught of Peace into Draco’s drink to calm his nerves. “You’d think that after seven years of being an Auror the man would trust me to take a case that’s actually a case and not just saving a kneazle from a tree. But no, I’m still Draco Malfoy the Death Eater to that lot.”
“Very good, Sky,” Malfoy says, before turning to Harry. “P- Harry, uh we have about 20 minutes left in our session, so you are free to go at this point, as I would like to finish up with Sky privately.”
“You do realize that this is illegal don’t you, Granger? I should arrest you right this second!” Draco said, leaning over the counter towards Hermione.
“Hello, Draco,” she greeted the blond haired man with a smile. “The usual?”
Just as Harry takes the photograph to look more closely, the door opens and Malfoy comes in with a tray containing their tea.
“I have a better idea,” Draco says, leaning in closer to Harry. Even without his glasses, Harry can recognise the mischievous glint in his lover’s eyes.
she mused.
Harry holds back a laugh, and puts back the picture frame, apologizing in the process. “Girlfriend?” he inquires, his curiosity getting the best of him.
Hermione tried not to smile at Draco’s ‘secretive’ way of asking about her friend. Draco would never admit it, but it was very obvious to Hermione that Draco was absolutely infatuated with her friend. Hermione had a hunch that Draco’s feelings weren’t one-sided as Harry had always been kind of obsessed with Draco. But the two never spent more than a minute in each other’s company. Even now, nearly a decade after the war, they still pretended that they couldn’t stand each other despite being a lot more civil than they had been at Hogwarts. “Harry’s doing alright, he’s busy with the kids as usual.”
Christmas time was always beautiful at Hogwarts and a lot of the eighth year students had decided to stay there over break because it would be their last Christmas at Hogwarts. This year was different for Harry though, this year he was on a mission (one that didn’t involve evil wizards -well, it didn’t involve ones as evil as the ones he’d dealt with before). This year, he would kiss Draco Malfoy.
“Fuck, that’s hot,” Harry said before he could catch himself, immediately turning Gryffindor red. “Fuck. I’ll just go now, not making any noise and pretending I don’t exist,” He got off the bar stool, stumbling for a bit before starting to walk away
“Thanks, that means a lot, I also think you’re an insufferable git,” Harry said, rolling his eyes before he took another sip of his rum and coke. “Hey, Malfoy, did you really think we were good partners?”
“What? What’s happening?” Harry asked, looking lost.
“Still moping, are you, Potter?”
Harry’s breath hitches. Teddy has been staying over at Harry and Draco’s for the last couple days while Andromeda visits Narcissa in France. And ever since Teddy walked in on Harry with his cock up Draco’s arse after having had a nightmare, three years ago—being five at the time, Teddy didn’t really understand what was happening, thank Merlin, but it had scarred Harry and Draco for life—they’d vowed never to have sex when Teddy was in the house. And now that Teddy was no longer in the house…
“Do you think you can wait here without terrorizing the trainees, Harry? I’ll let you know what’s happening as soon as I can. And before you ask no you can’t get in with me you’d just be getting in our way.”
Draco hears a throat being cleared and snaps his head back up to face Potter. The brow with the piercing tilts upward and Draco realizes that he’s been staring. For a very long time.
“Okay, okay, you’re right. But can we just walk over there? I really don’t want to shout like a mad man.”
The mechanical voice on the tube announces the next station, pulling Draco away from his thoughts for a moment. He’s been putting off sending
Harry
“Okay, Sky, I want you to look at Andie and tell me three positive things about him if you can.”
PS: I like the plants on your parchment, I would expect you to have the Malfoy family crest or something post and twatty like that. Not that having any design at all on your parchment isn’t posh enough.
Draco’s thought process is stalled by the sound of a shower turning on. Apparently, Draco didn’t wait long enough to be alone in the showers. Draco huffs, about to walk back out of the showers and head to his room, when he hears it: a moan, followed by a content sigh.
Sky takes a tentative step closer. “Um, I really like the colour. It’s a very nice bright green.”
Really, Harry was stumped, nothing,
“Healer Granger, you’re needed with Auror Malfoy.”
Harry sighed and brushed Draco’s hair out of his eyes with the hand that wasn’t holding Draco’s. “I just really want you to wake up and make fun of me for being a sap.”
“From Toni’s.” Draco confirmed.
“Hey wait, where are you going,” Harry said when Draco rushed away from Harry and the mistletoe. “Malfoy! It’s bad luck!” Harry called after Draco to no avail.
“Coming right up!” Hermione said joyously, getting to work on the drinks. She knew exactly what potion to put in their drinks. The problem with these two was that they kept pretending. Everything would work out just fine if they stopped being daft cows and told each other what they really thought; if they told each other
“It’s just that everyone from the wizarding world wants Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lived and it seems like every muggle that I’m interested in only wants sex.”
“Very sound analysis,” Draco said through kisses, making Harry pull back and grin at him.
Potter steps to the side and turns part-way towards Draco, revealing a rather large snake that is red white and orange striped. Unable to stop himself, Draco jumps a little.
He was greeted by Draco’s cat, Lyra who stayed in Grimmauld Place more often than not as she didn’t like to be alone and Draco’s flat was likely to be empty more frequently.
the bag of treats for the owl. The owl immediately stuffs his head in the bag and true to Harry’s word, pulls out a squirrel-shaped treat after a couple of seconds of searching.
“Hermione left a couple minutes ago,” Harry said. “I… I don’t know if you heard. I don’t know if you actually can hear or if that’s just something they tell visitors just to keep them from going insane waiting.”
charm on the wall showed 07:16, not that Harry could see it. Harry felt for his glasses on the nightstand next to Draco’s hospital bed and put them on, taking in his surroundings. He looked over at Draco to see if he was awake, hoping that he was awake.
The thought is distracting enough that Draco fails to notice how Potter’s eyes are no longer fixed on his Advanced Transfigurations book but on Draco instead.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay,” Harry said, his voice weak. “Can I stay here with him through the night? I’d like to be here when he wakes up.”
It was a slow night at the pub when Hermione saw Harry come in, his frustration clear on his face. “Hey, Harry,” she greeted him once he was close enough to hear. “I thought you had a date tonight.”
I will have to check with Luna about Tuesday but it should be okay, I’ll let you know by Friday.
charm that’s keeping him unconscious and we’re still working on healing the burn, but other than that, he doesn’t have any critical wounds,” Hermione said before adding. “The curse seems to have worked fast, Harry, we might not have been able to heal him had they brought him in a minute later. But they didn’t, and Draco is going to be fine. We’ve cast multiple cooling charms to stop the burning from continuing and patched up the parts of his lung that took the most damage. We’re going to be taking off the
Draco wants to say something—a snarky comment about how that’s probably the most action Potter’s ever got—but he can’t bring himself to look away from how Potter’s lips close around the quill-shaped sweet and his tongue wraps around it as if it’s…
“I- I wasn’t!” Harry exclaimed, flustered, before composing himself. “It was a joke, Malfoy, don’t make shit up when you don’t know what you're talking about.”
“Does this have a point, Potter?” Draco asked, but he was smiling.
. He’s no longer wearing the hideous round glasses with the thick plastic frames. They’re still round, but they have thin metal frames, making him look a lot more modern
Nobody expected Harry James Potter, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, to be dating Draco Lucius Malfoy, known ex-Death Eater. Yet he was doing just that and nobody had ever seen him happier.
“I didn’t hate you,” Harry blurted out. “I never hated you. It was being an Auror that I hated.”
“Oh, Merlin’s beard, Harry, tell us what you actually think of Draco, will you?” Hermione said, exasperatedly.
Draco must make some kind of noise then because Potter whips around, eyes blown wide. Potter flushes, and Draco knows that his own face must look very similar to Potter’s rapidly reddening one. “I wanted this shower,” Draco explains––lies––trying to keep his eyes from wandering further down Potter’s body, “but I can see that it’s occupied so I’ll see you later, Potter.”
“I’m fine! I can *achoo* work.”
I just got off the phone with Adelaide, I’m sorry for the delay, I’ll help you.
to check the time, making the outline of a clock flash in the air that showed that it was just past 2. “Can’t sleep?” Harry asked walking over to Draco.
“Potter,” Draco says warily, slowly following him to the back. “Just how big is she?”
“I don’t know for sure, the Aurors that brought him in said that he got hit by a curse but it was cast wordlessly and we weren’t able to identify it. He’s unconscious now,” Hermione said before she was interrupted by a Healer trainee at her door.
“Well, you’re already making jokes at my expense so I think you’ll be up in no time,” Harry said.
“Oh, right, of course,” he says, looking slightly taken aback, and walks behind the counter. He produces a transparent, grey tube almost double the size of Nymph.
“I’m working with a client to help them overcome their ophidiophobia. They’re doing really well so far with the pictures, videos and plastic snakes but that hardly compares to being in the presence of a snake. So, anything that you think would be a step up from that, without being too far up from that would be useful.”
Harry
Draco’s most recent interaction with a snake was, frankly, not very recent at all, and quite harrowing. But Nymph doesn’t look like she has anything in common with Nagini… So, repressing his worries, Draco leans in closer to Nymph, who is now looking intently at Draco. “She’s gorgeous,” Draco says, without thinking. Because she really is. Her ‘splotches’ are individual scales that are coloured differently, and upon closer inspection, Draco realizes that the white is really more of a light pink. Potter makes some hissing noises at Nymph, and she responds, before turning back around to keep looking at Draco.
“Thanks, Potter.”
He takes his glasses off carefully placing them on the table by the sofa. He takes a long swig of the Firewhiskey, the liquid burning his throat on his way to Draco’s stomach. An owl flies in through the open window and lands by Draco’s head. Draco thinks it’s Cassiopeia first, then remembers that he sent her back home for the day. Draco turns his head slightly towards the bird, noting that it’s a gorgeous grey spotted owl, to see a scroll identical to the one from Potter this morning tied to its leg. Draco unties the scroll with a groan. The owl looks at Draco incredulously as Draco unfurls the parchment.
The weird thing is, Harry knows that he’s going to accept Draco’s offer; he wants to help. It’s just the confirming bit that he’s having trouble with, Merlin knows why. Harry glances at the clock on his wall, with the hands almost at half 18. Just then, he feels Nymph crawling up his arm from the counter.
PPS: It’s post post scriptum NOT post scriptum scriptum
“I don’t… speak it in front of people much,” Potter says, not looking at Draco, and even though Draco can’t see Potter’s face, he can tell that Potter’s smile has faltered. “It still reminds people a lot of Voldemort; it used to remind
Thinking back on it, Draco had right to be confused because there was absolutely no logical reason for Harry to be there. Harry really should’ve thought this through more. “Uhh, just taking a walk. Thought I’d come say bye?”
“Uh, hi, nice to meet you too.” Harry turns to Malfoy and walks closer. “Sorry I’m late, Malfoy.”
It hadn’t been so easy at the start, back when they were newly friends in eighth year and sharing a dorm. Draco was impeccable at concealing his feelings after the war - it was a necessary skill when The Dark Lord was living in your house. But over time, Harry started to pick up on small things Draco did that were telling of his mood, like the little crinkle he’d get next to his left eye when he was genuinely happy, or how his eyebrows would sag just a millimeter when he was sad, and how he would get a small crinkle in the middle of his brows when he was upset or bothered by something.
“Circe’s tits, Potter, have you never heard of boys pulling girls’ hair because they like them? I’ve been obsessed with you ever since first year, you nitwit, I just didn’t know why until fourth year when I-” Draco cut off abruptly, his face turning beet red. He cleared his throat before speaking again in a more calculated, dismissive tone. “Anyway, Potter, I guess I like you too, for some reason.”
Draco blanches. “You’re a wizard! Why can’t you just summon one? Or cast a hot air charm on yourself?”
Hermione thought she heard Draco mumble something like “
“Why did you say you had to stop by, Luna?” Potter says, picking Nymph up from the counter and placing her on his shoulder. The colour of the reptile somehow both clashing against and complementing Potter’s green shirt.
Everyone was silent for a beat and Harry silently cursed himself for ever thinking this was a good idea. “Right,” Pansy said turning to Draco. “We have to be going, darling, but we’ll see you after break. You’re absolutely sure you don’t want to spend Christmas with me and father?”
🐍DRACO🐍
she notes, once close enough to Harry’s ear.
Harry clears his throat and tells her that he was never involved with Malfoy in that way, again, neither denying nor confirming his attraction to him.
“Yes, of course, though it is merely a carrier, Malfoy, I don’t keep them in cages.”
“I did wait for an answer Potter, you didn’t give me one fast enough,” Draco said setting the takeout boxes on the TV table in front of Harry. “I got you chicken noodle soup.”
looks like a soft punk god.
“I could probably manage an
PSS: Earl will start pecking at your hand if you don’t feed him an owl treat. It’ll start soft but if you ignore him… Also, he won’t stop until you give him one. He likes the ones shaped like squirrels if you got ‘em.
He put his head in his hands and tried to block out the too bright too white lights. He felt the weight of the little velvet box in his jacket pocket. It felt too heavy now. Now that he thought he might never get to give it to Draco, that he couldn’t even try. He was going to propose tonight.
“Call me Harry,” Po- Harry says, just before meeting Draco’s lips once more. Draco thinks he might as well start calling Potter “Harry” if he’s going to keep snogging him. And really, Draco has no intention of stopping anytime soon.
Flying against Potter had always been a thrill but that was never because Draco was thirsting over Potter. That is, until now. Draco wonders how he ever survived games against Gryffindor—
“I should put Andie back,” he says, to fill the not-so-comfortable silence, after a while of them standing by Draco’s desk, sipping at their tea.
“Well, I wrote a response to your letter, since you care so much about proper etiquette.”
“Fine, fine I’ll go. Floo call me if there’s an update, okay?”
Harry thought he saw Draco’s eyelids flutter but all movement had stopped — if it ever existed — when Harry blinked.
“Hey, Draco,” Hermione greeted with a warm smile.
“So that’s how I started speaking it again,” Potter confirms. “I’d quit the Aurors recently too, so a pet turned into a passion which eventually turned into a job.”
Now, 10 years later, when Draco came home from work with the tiny crinkle between his brows, Harry would summon a chocolate frog from their emergency stash in the kitchen and shove it in Draco’s hands. He’d lean in to kiss his boyfriend on the cheek before whispering “I’ll go run you a bath.”
Hermione ignored it. “And for you, Harry?”
“Well, they can’t hear us, we tried, let’s go back to your flat.”
