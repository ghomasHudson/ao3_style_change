“Draco c’mon join the game. It’s stupid but fun!” exclaimed Pansy. Draco looked around the room full of people telling him to join. And one of them, in particular, looked at him like in a challenge “scared Draco” said Harry with a smirk.
Harry cautiously took a step towards him, hands in a surrendering position, “you did not kill dumbledore” he said. Draco’s expression changed, “potter, what?” he said in disbelieve.
He put his hand on the wall beside the door and focudes his magic through silent spells to listen inside. “that potter get everything” Harry heard a man say,“the golden boy my ass, gets everything. Even this beauty right here” he heard another. “we all know he’s keeping Malfoy around to warm his bed. Let Jace deal with him. Then you can have all the fun you want with this scum of a death eater said another and all laughed
“I found a lot of other people she and her brother killed. She was bringing back their father. Their plan was to take over the ministry by resurrect him in Kingsley body” he explained. “and Malfoy’ asked Beatrice. “He took him before we made the jump on Alice” said Mo knowing the situation was particularly hard on Harry.
He handed him the chocolate and the water bottle, “I’ll be right back. Stay right here love.”. he walked towards the man still on the ground. He checked his pockets but found nothing. He took out his phone and clicked the picture of the man and then obliviated his memory.
He followed his routine, went to the gym, worked out, took a quick shower. Kreacher was standing in front of the black family tapestry when he came down. Harry stopped in his footsteps and quitely leaned on the entrance door frame.
He already decided the best attire with the help of Pansy to wear on the ball night and the stuff he needed to break his fast was already arranged.
the smut part is in italic, so skip that part if you don't want to read. it would not affect the story.
“thank you Alice, i swear I’ll gift you the top brand of hair colors”. That cheered her up more than he expected and she went out of her office with a huge smile.
Harry sat their clutching his knees to his chest, tears rolling out of his eyes in constant stream. Harry knew he didn’t feel the actual physical pain infused upon the man in his dream but he knew it was even worse than all the cruciatus he ever took
He was quick and the bag was still light when harry picked it up. He looked towards Draco with an impressed look. Draco shrugged and said, “what, it’s not my first time running away”. Harry smiled and waited for Draco outside the apartment.
Malfoy stared at him approaching and sat a little straighter. “Can I join? he asked with a smile, he hoped he looked confident despite being shit scared. Malfoy nodded his head, “it's a free country” he said, gesturing towards the opposite empty chair.
He was all prepared for the refusal that Malfoy will say that he already has a boyfriend and all but to his surprise he agreed to go on a date. Correction, not a date, just two ex-enemies going on a dinner together, no matter what Harry’s brain says.
Draco looked to his mother. “it’s going to be hard I know my dragon, but we’ve been through the worse already”. Draco smiled at her in return. They survived living under the same roof as the dark lord, how much harder can the school be.
and climbed behind Harry. Harry started the bike with a jerk and Draco’s breath hitched and his hands came upon Harry’s shoulder.
They had successfully transferred both Alice and Jace to Azkaban. Kingsley was still in recovery, but he was out of danger thanks to Hermione. They managed to save Billie as well who was currently in the St.Mungus.
They both were standing in a dark alley besides some bar. Harry led to the street and Draco realised it was a local market, “where are we” asked Draco. “we’re in a small town of Ireland.”
He thoughts played the kiss in his mind like a tape on loop, how Harry’s lips were a little rough against his, they fit like a piece of puzzle that was long lost, returned to its rightful place.
The angle was just right for both of their dicks as the next roll made Draco moan louder again, this time Harry kissed him to shut him up.
“what kind of dreams?” she asked. “nightmares about him, but lately I’ve been having nightmares about someone who’s being tortured. It’s like I’m in their body but I can’t figure out who it is.” He explained.
When they both returned to the compartment Harry pulled him back on his lap. “looks like you two had your fun” commented Ron.
“I’ll write to you mother.” he picked up his trunk. Before entering the train, he turned around and waved Narcissa goodbye before finally letting the worry show on his face. He ignored the pestering eyes and walked through the train to look for an empty compartment.
Draco took one last look at his apartment and Harry casted a spell to remove every trace that Draco was ever here. When Draco joined him, Harry held his hand out, “your phone”. Draco handed him his phone with a confused look. Harry took the phone and broke it. They took the emergency exit out.
Draco let go wielding that much power at once exhausted all of Draco’s energy at once. Before he could fall to the ground Harry was by his side holding him close. “I love you too” he whispered and kissed the Blonde’s temple.
When they reached the restaurant, Draco got off the bike and handed the helmet back to Harry, “That wasn’t as bad as I was expecting it to be”, he said flicking a hair strand back behind his ear. Harry laughed in return.
Harry stood in front of the mirror with his hands on the counter and looked at himself, he looked at his hair, long enough to cover the scar on his forehead. He's not depressed anymore but he longs for the feeling of fulfillment. He sighed and walked inside the shower cubical. He didn't even wait for the water to get hot and stood under it, his thoughts went back to Malfoy,  to how he used to stare at him through the dining hall, his face, he was so beautiful, long lashes falling on high cheeks. Harry' cock stirs in interest.
Harry realized he was in Draco’s head. Jace must be keeping him locked inside his own head by manipulating his memories. He needed to make Draco realise he didn’t kill professor dumbledore in order to wake him up
“no, I am going to save you and put an end to this, and everything is going to be alright. Just have a little faith in me” he said holding Draco as tight as possible. Draco nodded and kissed him drawing a deep breath through the kiss before letting go completely.
“you”, said Malfoy not more than a whisper, “uhh… hey Malfoy”, said Harry with a sheepish look. “you”, said Malfoy again with a little confidence. “yeah me, sorry to startle you like that”.
“What are you going to do to him” he asked looking towards Malfoy. He looked like he was barely breathing. Seeing him like that broke Harry’s heart.
“I think there is a way we can find him before” said Beatrice. “your blood bond, you said earlier that you dreamt of how Malfoy like you were in his body” she clarified, “yeah, that was when I was in deep sleep. I don’t even have control over it”.
Wands at ready they scrummaged through the place. Harry was going through her bedroom when he heard Mo calling out his name. “what is it?” He said walking into the study where Mo was. As he walked in, he looked around the room in shock.
Draco nodded. He hugged Harry tight, “promise me if things went sideways, you will kill me”. Harry tried pushing him away, “Draco what?”
Draco looked down at his drink and thought maybe something is wrong with this beer or maybe this all is just a complete big hoax. But the way Harry kept glancing at him, told him that maybe he was just simply trying to move on from the past, starting by fixing up a stupid school rivalry.
He was such a gentleman to Draco that he had to calm down the urge to just snog the irresistible bastard right there in front of everyone.
Harry was about to say something when they both heard, “Draco". Harry turned to see the man. The man approached them. He stood beside Draco and looked at Harry wryly.
Draco didn’t let his fatigue show on his face but Harry still looked at him worriedly as they walked. Harry was always tongue-tied whenever Draco was around. He’d flush completely whenever they sat a little too close.
“we know who’s controlling the Minister” said Harry. “Jamie stay here and find out every information you can about her. I can’t fucking believe she played us right under our noses.
Few moments later he held Draco’s chin to look up at him, “I’ll never let anyone hurt you ever again. I promise you Draco Malfoy” harry said leaving no space for doubt.
Draco stood in front of him, “hey p-Harry”. Harry had to take a minute to look at Draco’s appearance, he was wearing a dark blue knee-length dress. It was a deep v neck which showed his pale, hairless chest, with little moles, his hair was done in a loose side braid. “Harry?” said Draco.
He was close to the restaurant when he heard his name being called. He turned around and saw none other than the wizarding world’s poster boy running towards him.
“What?” asked Draco, how could they have possibly known. Ron pointed towards Draco’s neck. Draco’s eyes went wide as he felt all the hickeys Harry’s left on his neck. “you brute!” he turned towards Harry who had a proud smile on his face and Draco just wanted to die of embarrassment as everyone started laughing.
Harry was lost in the beauty before him, Draco’s eyes were dark, lips all swollen and pink, and his cheeks were red.
“don’t you understand I have to do this, I have to” said Draco. Hands shaking for what he was about to do. He looked around looking for Snape to come. Any moment now.
Malfoy looked at him a bit surprised and angered, “I’m not doing anything illegal Potter, you can check whatever you want, I know you’re an auror” said Draco barely controlling himself to not shout at the man. Of course, why else would Harry potter, the savior of the world wants to do anything with Draco Malfoy, an ex-death eater?
“okay It wasn’t like you were any better”. Suddenly Draco felt a pang of guilt on his heart and he looked down.
” said Jace as he took Draco up the stairs. One of the many things he learned from Beatrice is never be dependent on your magic. He carefully focused on his hands and dislocated his thumb. He had done it so many times that he didn’t even feel the pain now.
The man was still lying unconscious on the ground. He sat down in front of Draco, “ you’re okay Draco, you’re safe” he said trying to get him back to him. “you’re with me, the man can’t hurt you anymore. I’m here darling, come back to me” he said softly
“Draco you are no assassin” harry heard. He tried to follow that voice suddenly he was in the astronomy tower, the night Dumbledore was killed. He saw Dracco from beneath the floor boards holding his wands towards the professor.
Harry was so proud of himself knowing he reduced Draco to a point where he couldn’t think straight. Draco blushed furiously at his embarrassment but he could not hide the smile that broke his face, “see you again Harry” he said and walked inside the building.
“Yeah, that happened to me and Blaise as well, Gryffindors darling”. Before she could open the door. he pulled away.
Billie poured down the potion making a line just below the window. The potion created red smoke that spread like wated and created a gap enough for them to cross over
“I will show you what true suffering feels like” Draco voice sounded like he was possessed with power. Harry could feel the power Draco had. It was like their combines magic. At that moment Draco held his and his own magic. Which in return made Harry feel the magic like he had never before.
Jace fell to the ground and crawled away from Draco holding his head. Looking at distance like he was living through the pain all over again and again. slowly going insane.
He looked behind Draco and then immediately started working on Draco’s hands. Draco looked behind him and saw that Harry was standing over him with arms crossed and a stoic face, the outline of his muscles clearly visible. Draco flashed him a smile and Harry returned it with as much sweetness.
Harry took the water from the thali and fed it to Draco. He stopped after drinking half and offered the rest to Harry.
“are you sure, Harry. It’s the minister we’re talking about” asked Moriarty. “yes, he’s…. he’s been acting strange” he know he doesn’t have much evidence to prove it but he also can’t tell them the real reason why he’s so sure.
Harry crouched down looking at the look.  He took the lock in hand and examined the keyhole, “give me something point, quick”. Billie took out her hair pin, “will this work?”
Harry knew he was right, the thought of loosing Draco filled him with dread. He knew if he lost Draco today, he will cast an Avada kadavra on himself without a second thought. “that’s right I don’t think so. Meet me at deathly Hollow at 12pm with my sister if you want your boy alive. Come alone, if I suspect anyone else I will kill him.”
When he reached the restaurant, he saw Malfoy standing out waiting for Harry. Harry was relieved to see the blonde was safe. He stopped in front of Malfoy and gave him the helmet. “get on, we need somewhere private to talk” without missing a beat Draco said, “we can go to my place, it’s only 10mins from here”
He accepted his desire for Potter when he moved to London and found himself thinking about Harry much more often than he’d like to admit. Soon he realized he actually missed Harry.
Since gender-fluidity and equality were the hot topics in politics right now most of the guests encouraged him for showing the courage to break gender norms, some of them judged him but didn’t dare say anything with Harry by his side. He didn’t leave his side even for a second. Glared at anyone who got a little too close to Draco. He was absolutely enjoying the attention.
“I know nothing makes sense love. But you are in your head. Someone is out there trying to keep you from waking up. I really need you to remember what exactly happened that night in the astronomy tower” said Harry, taking little steps towards Draco.
“You better complete those reports before Kingsley shows up, he would not like the mess on your desk”.
“Oh, hey Malfoy,” said Ron testing the grounds. Draco could not believe the situation he was in. “I guess you can join us too”. He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out.
He looked at himself in the mirror and thought that it has been a long time since he felt this happy.
“how do you know, somethings will shock you. I was choosen” said Draco showing his dark mark. Harry remembers clearly that Draco did not kill dumbledore. He couldn’t.
“tell me every time you go the cafeteria what is the first thing that you ordered?” he asked again. Harry so wanted to be not true right. But seeing how Kingsley struggled to answer simple details about himself only confirmed his suspicions.
"Potter" they shook each other's hand with a tight grip. He took Draco's hand but instead of shaking he turned his hand and kissed his knuckles. "you look lovely tonight Draco" he said with a sharp smirk. Draco took his hand back with a tight smile "thank you"
He whispered few wandless spells and with his hands blocking the air passage, she passed out easily. Harry casted an episkey to heal minor injuries of Mo. Mo came back to consciousness. Harry helped him sit up and handed him his wand back. “We need to move, Jace took Draco” he explained. Mo got up with a groan, “what are we going to do with her?” he asked.
he saw he bodies of his friends and family lying around. He walked ahead a few dead bodies and saw one of them was of Ron’s.
They decided to walk a bit so Harry charmed his bike to pocket size. “do you miss it, magic?” asked Harry while they walked slowly alongside each other on the streets. “I used to, in the beginning, it was hard doing everything manually, but I got used to, the more I work the less I think about the… the past” said Draco with a sad look.
He saw a notification from Draco and opened it. As soon as he opened it, his smile grew too big for his face. Can’t wait to see you too Dray. He typed that thought attached to a picture of himself, hand underneath his head, with a huge ass smile on his face and sent it.
Draco got back to his apartment studio and fell down face flat on his bed. Running into Harry Potter was not on his to-do list or rather having him pressed behind his back like he imagined so many times.
he imagined Harry would say. And with a hand last few rubs of his fingers and strokes of his hand he came so hard shooting white ropes of cum all over his hand and belly.
The conversations flowed easily after that, they both managed to stay off the dark topics related to war and focused on other stuff about their lives. The food was amazing and in the main course they had
“thank you”, Draco sat up against the headboard and took the plate. “where’s Mrs. Malice?” asked Draco. “she left on behalf of some work. She’ll be back later” answered Harry preparing himself to tell Draco everything.
“Ginny would do, Ginevra sounds like I did something terribly wrong,” she said with a grimace. “that’s because mum always says that when you do something wrong” added Ron.
"Get Alice to find out who might have done it. Can you track back some of the magic of the medallion to the person who's controlling  him?" He asked looking  at Mo. " yeah i can try, just need to get close enough  to the minister" said Mo.
He picked up the sieve from the thali, looked to the moon through it, and then faced it towards Harry to secure its blessings.
He got up from his bed since there's no going back to sleep, it never is. He went to the gym in his house, Grimmauld Palace. He changed it a lot since the first time he came here during the war, it accommodated to Harry's needs, it even has mini movie theatre, though Harry never uses it. He didn't change a thing in Sirius’s or Regulus's bedroom. Sometimes when he dreamt about Sirius he'll go and sit in his room and apologize in between his cries begging for forgiveness.
Draco got on his back and folded his legs in a criss-cross position, and hesitantly put his hand on Harry’s back. He could feel the hard muscles underneath along with the warmth his body offered.
Harry apparated near the back door of the bookstore. He took out his bike from his pocket which he charmed to fit in his pocket. He straddled the now enlarged bike and put on his helmet and made his way to café where they almost had coffee which was interrupted by Jake.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and asked, “were the dreams really that bad?”. Harry took Draco’s hand in his and kissed his knuckles. “yes, I was killing me not knowing how you were. And I felt it, I think, like I was you in few of those dreams. Like I was in your body, I felt how much pain you were in.” he said holding both Draco’s face with his other hand. He wanted to talk to him about the blood bond but figured now isn’t the right time.
Harry meets with his team at apparition point. There are all wearing their auror robes, complete black in color. They all have spells protective spells engraved in the robes to avoid most of the minor injuries. “ready” he asks everyone.
He thought if being in control came naturally to the man with the way he kissed. Hungry and possessive but still soft and passionate. He reached inside for his cock and spread the already leaking pre-cum all over his shaft for friction.
Alice was levitating Mo, her focus completely on him, “Damn Mo, you just have to be this Heavy that even a leviosa can hardly lift you!” she cursed. She didn’t even realize when Harry broke free from his bonds. He knocked the wand out of her hand and got her into a head lock. One of the advantages of being an all-powerful wizard, you don’t need a wand to do spells.
“no no no, please No. I’m begging you Jace. Let him go. I’ll do everything you say. PLEASE!!” screamed Draco. “I can’t let him go Draco. If I let any of them live. Can’t let them ruining all the fun we’re gonna have”. He focused on Harry once again. “AVADA KEDAVRA.”
“Where are we headed?” he said looking around, his strength was still low. “someone I know lives just outside the town, I can’t apparate us there directly. First I have to make sure we weren’t followed” replied Harry taking out his phone. He called Alice.
It was so awkward that Harry could practically taste it on his tongue. Malfoy schooled his expression into a straight face and said, “well, you can look around, I’ll be by the reception” and with that, he walked away as fast as he could.
“okay” proceeded Cedric like Malfoy had fallen right in his trap, “Sit on Harry’s lap for the rest of the train ride”
“Tie her up and take her back to the Grimmauld Palace. I’ll go up to the room and see if he left any evidence behind” with that he sprinted upstairs.
“wait, look at the side of it, the markings are faded but I’m sure that’s the spell to activate it.” Said Cassie. she was excellent at noticing little details that other missed.
Draco knew Harry was close with his family in India after the war so he knew how the custom goes. Draco read about it and he wanted to do it as it is.
He casted a revelio on the walls to look for any spells protecting the building. “I can’t see anyone inside. We need to get to the basement” whispered Billie. “we can’t just walk in.  The place has got alarming charms on every door to window.” He waved his wand towards the building which created a light yellow centric circled indicating the charm.
Harry did dream about Malfoy that night, but it wasn’t a nightmare. He dreamt about the time when Harry justified in favour of Malfoy at his trail. How had Malfoy looked up at him when Harry arrived in the court, shocked, scared and a little hopeful, he looked so fragile, like porcelain doll. All Harry wanted to do was hug him tight and never let go. 8 years of rivalry melted away from that one look. He would have hugged him and never let go if he knew that was the last time he was seeing him. Until tomorrow.
The man was tall almost Harry's height, he was muscular and the sun made his lightly dark skin so beautiful, and the scruff on his face brought out his cheekbones.
“hey” said Draco and snuggled closer to his hand. “how are you feeling now?” he asked in soft low voice. “better”, just then his stomach roared, “and hungry” he said, face red with embarrassment. Harry laughed a bit, “here I got you some food” he said picking up the plate of sandwiches from the tray.
“Nothing, so do they keep record of wizards who’re working in the muggle world?” He asked nonchalantly.
Even just thinking about his name brought him a little e peace. He picked up his phone and lay back down on his bed. He was too tired to even go to the gym after this nightmare.
Harry vanishes the content now that their fast is broken and kissed Draco passionately. He wrapped his hand around his slim waist and Draco moved his hands around Harry’s neck.
Harry cut him off, “It’s okay, I’ll change that in a few years,” he said with a cocky smile. Draco rolled his eyes but, but he smiled with relief.
“Wh… what? Why?” Harry Potter stuttering, what would the Ministry say if they saw their precious savior like this. Draco smiled at that thought.
Harry set the plate aside and moved to sit beside Draco. Draco hid his face in his neck and breathed Harry’s scent to calm himself.
Draco noticed that everyone was looking at him and he got a little self-conscious. Harry leaned in his ear and said, “you look so beautiful Draco”. Draco flushed so hard at the compliment and the way his name on Harry's tongue that it made him forget his worries about any prying eyes.
Harry rubbed his face with his hands and sat down into of the chairs, “earlier today he told me to look for Malfoy, but he already knew where Malfoy is. He’s the one who helped him get a new life. He totally forgot about that. And also someone  erased Malfoy's details from the records of wizards working in the muggle world.” he said. His head held down on the table, already feeling guilty about keeping things from his team.
Billie walked ahead of him, “harry there’s another” she waved her wand towards another drop of blood on the ground. “Draco” he whispered in dread and they both sprinted towards that direction.
Draco looked down and silently took a seat beside the door. Pansy came back with Blaise. “you’re one shit arse do you know that Malfoy”. Draco got up and hugged Blaise. He missed them both.
He backed away but harry pulled him by the waist and crashed their lips. The kiss was neither slow nor fast, just perfect for the moment. His one hand held Draco close while the other held Draco’s cheek. Draco snaked his hand around his neck and into his hair. Harry licked his lower lip, desperate for permission to deepen the kiss. Draco let out a little moan when he felt Harry’s tongue caressing his and tightened his hold in his hair.
“you alright” he stepped back a little. Still not removing his hands. Draco let his hands fall to his side but not pushing away.
“care to tell me what is going on Harry, team is getting suspicious” she asked as soon as she picked up. He knows he should tell him. But someone inside must have told Jace of his location. “I can’t right now, but you just have to trust me. I’ll tell you everything soon. Did you find out how Jace got inside the ministry?”.
“We were so worried about you man,” he said with sincerity. Draco almost believed that his friends had forgotten about him. He couldn’t write them letters nor was he allowed to receive any. In case any of the death eaters tried to contact them.
He remembered all the heated looks Harry gave throughout the day and imagined Harry looking at him like that while he’s on top of him. He inserted a second finger and curled them hitting the spot, all while stroking his cock. His back arched at the pleasure.
Halfway to the staircase, he heard someone loudly bang open the gate they came through. “run” he shouted as Draco and they both ran down the stairs. The man threw a few stinging spells which Harry blocked.
Harry ignored Draco’s confused looks and walked towards the window to make sure he wasn’t followed here either. He saw the same guy from Knockturn alley and hurridly turned towards Draco.
“good baby me too, cum for me” he whispered in his ear. And Draco came so hard his whole body spasmed. Harry followed right after.
The ball was going to be held at a sanctuary to keep it enclosed from the muggles. Arrangements were made for them to stay there as well. The ball was on the same night as the festival.
They were walking towards a nice two-story suburban house. He could see the lights coming from the inside. Harry walked towards the door his hand never left Draco’s since the apparition. He knocked.
“it was first used during the first war with Voldemort. He used it to bring back a woman in the body of Bellatrix. I visited the prosecutor who was working the Malfoy case. He said the medallion has five stages. First it takes control of person’s habits” she said sliding the paper. “you’re telling me there was someone who loved the nose less git?” asked Jamie.
Harry was out of breath when he reached Malfoy and his hair was even messier than before, Draco just wanted to run his fingers through them. He put his hands in his pockets before he actually did just that.
Hermione raised her wand and converted the red roses on the dining table into tulips. Ron picked them up and rapped them nicely and also charmed them so they last longer. "there you go mate"
Harry answered without stopping. “there’s someone out there who followed me till here. I need to get you some place safe.” he said as he put out a few pair of clothes on the bed. “what, why me, I haven’t done anything since the war, I don’t even have magic anymore for fuck sakes” he said angrily.
He decided 15 minutes. He roamed around the aisles for minutes and right when the needle showed his 15 minutes are up, he walked as fast as a man could. He grabbed a book without even looking at it and made his way to the reception.
It was 7 AM when he got off the bed, he put on his joggers and sweatshirt and went out for a jog. He passed by a few restaurants and local shops stopped for a regular cup of coffee.
They laughed at his comment but didn’t say anything in return, they knew Kreacher was not like other house elfs.
“Who was he?” asked Draco handing the half-eaten chocolate and the water bottle back. “I don’t know know, we need to get moving”. When they reached the apparition point Draco looked unsure, “we’re going to apparate?”.
When Alice returned, she closed the door of Harry’s office and took out a book size of a coin from her pocket and kept it in front of Harry. Harry raised an eye towards her silently asking for explanation.
This time Draco didn’t hesitate to hold Harry. When they reached Draco’s apartment. He ushered them in and closed the gate. Just as he was about to speak his phone rang.
"Yes everything is splendid, i just have to go. i'm awfully late."  All three of them stared at her sudden odd behavior.
In his attempt to get to Malfoy he didn’t even look at the book he picked, which was 50 shades of grey by E.L James. A very erotic romance novel because the universe just hates him that way. Harry hasn’t read the books but he watched the movie.
They made their way to the reception, "table under the name, Harry James”. “yes, this way gentlemen” a waiter led them to their reserved table, which Harry made sure has the best view. The waiter handed them the menus and left. “Impressive” said Draco. “of course only the best for the Slytherin Prince.”, Draco rolled his eyes at Harry but his lips were upturned a bit.
‘I’m so sorry”. The encounter was extremely awkward in front of all the people. Along with the golden trio, Ginny, Neville, ginny, Luna, Cho and Cedric were also there. Cedric and Harry were sitting a little too close to his liking.
He carefully bent down and ensured that he was still breathing and was only unconscious not under the spell Jace put him under earlier. He healed the cuts on his forearm along with a blood replenishing charm with his silent magic before he let his anger take over to deal with the other two.
Draco looked at the warily, “I’ve never been on a bike and what about my dress?”, he made a gesture to himself . Harry looked at him with a smirk, “scared Malfoy?”. “you wish potter”, but his words had no venom like they had in school. He took the helmet from Harry’s hand with look that said
Harry was fuming with Anger by the time they reached their place, “this is all my fault” he whispered to himself. They were standing in front of her house looking for any sign of threats. “she played all of us Harry, don’t blame yourself” said Mo offering a comforting hand on his shoulder.
He lay there in post orgasmic bliss, eyes closed as he came down from his high. He got up to the bathroom to clean himself.
Draco has been hard the entire time they kissing, that god his knickers had a tight elastic, so it didn’t show through his dress.
“you expect too much from him Draco” he turned his wand towards Harry, “I’ll show you how it’s done Potter” he raised his wand towards Harry. Draco was writhing violently in his grip and clawing at Jace’s hand. Mo and Cassie were trying their hardest to break through the bonds as well.
He saw a column of squibs working in muggle London, which only had few names. Harry fingers went over the names of all the squibs and stopped at the bottom of the list, there it was.
Kingsley closed his eyes and began to scream. Harry immediately casted a maffliato. Beatrice moved beside, “untie him, get him on the couch” as soon as Kingsley was untied he started having a seizure. “ what is happening to him?” he demanded.
“how are we gonna find Malfoy in two hours, merlin knows how long it is!” she hissed in anger. Harry casted lumos and walked a couple steps ahead looking for any sign. He came across a droplet of blood. He crouched down and saw the blood was fresh.
“merlin mate can’t you dream about unicorns and rainbows for once” asked Ron caressing his head and back. Harry let out a light chuckle, “I know how to find him” he said letting go of him.
Nothing that Harry said made Malfoy come out of his shocked zone. “what.. what are you doing here Potter?”.
When Harry reached his office, he saw Kingsley talking with James and Cassie. When he reached to Kingsley, he handed him a file, “we got a new case”.
Every time on Regulus’s or Sirius’s birthday they would  do something  to honor their memory. His first year in the house, on Sirius’s birthday  he took his motorcycle  out for a ride, since then he’d been enchanted by it.
“well we need to make sure which stage he’s at and collect evidence” said Harry. “I don’t know about the last two stages, if we’re lucky we won’t need to” said Billie.
"it isn't much of a debate Blaise. Both the ministry decided that the fund will be going to the schools, instead of Zabini funds." Draco replied with practiced ease.
Harry walked towards him and held him by the shoulders, “dray right now I need you to trust me, I’ll explain everything once we are someplace safe”. Draco looked at him for a second, “alright, I’ll pack”. Harry walked to the fridge and saw a bar of chocolate and out it in his pocket along with a water bottle.
Harry reached behind Malfoy and caught the book before it could hurt him and placed it where the blond was trying to reach.
“yeah It’s the fastest way to a safe house”. He turning his bike small again. “don’t worry I won’t let go of you” he said taking Draco’s hand.
It was Hermione-fucking-Granger. “oh hey, aren’t you two coming inside”. It’s like they have completely forgotten the past 7 years.
Nothing happened. Harry looked from where his eyes were on Draco in shock. Jace looked at his wand and the tried again, “avada kedavra” still nothing.
Jace put his hand forward for Harry to shake, “Jake Acroes, it’s pleasure to be working with you Mr. Potter”. His pointy eyes and twisted smile made Harry feel unsafe. His whole body was telling him to now trust the guy, but he knew how to manipulate his body language accordingly. With a big toothy smile, he said, “the pleasures all mine, and please call me Harry” and shook his hand.
“when Kingsley brought the case, he had no idea where you were. He also acted differently. Now I know why” said Harry putting on his boots. “so, you’re saying what, Kingsley is involved in this?”
He quickly purchased the book, eyes trained on the blonde the entire time. He walked out of the bookstore and towards Malfoy.
“Well, we can pretend that we’re rivals like before if it makes you feel any better?” she asked genuinely. “Or we can put it all behind, be the grown-ups the war forced us to be and move past it”
Harry knew Draco understood him because he lived under the same room as Voldemort. As they walked their knuckles brushed against each other. Harry took the first step and took Draco’s hand in his own. Harry’s heart was beating out of his chest but he relaxed as Draco interlinked their fingers. Draco gave his hand a reassuring squeeze and looked up at him with a soft smile. They walked in comfortable silence as Harry lightly caressed Draco’s hand.
sleeping curse. “we haven’t hurt your pretty boy yet, but we will.” Said Jace stroking his hand through Draco’s hair.
“perfectly” harry took the pin and set to pick the look. They lock clicked open and gave her a victory smile, “you gotta teach me how to do that” she said opening the door.
Now that he was laying in the comfort of his bed, he could let his thoughts run free. He thought about how his hands held him tightly in place. He reached a hand down and palmed himself through the damp fabric and squeezed. He gasped as he felt his own hardness up and down slowly.
"Master Harry, breakfast is served" said Kreacher. His relationship with Kreacher changed since he found out that Harry avenged the death of his master Regulus. It's an odd relationship, but it works for him. Once, his depression got so bad that he came home drunk every night, shouted on Kreacher  and threw clothes at him to dismiss him. Kreacher  folded the clothes in a neat file and told Harry that his service is not his to dismiss, he’s bound to the house because he chose to, master Regulus dismissed  Kreacher of his duties  long ago, but Kreacher stayed.
“I need to buy something from the trolly” he hurriedly excused himself out of the compartment. He closed the door behind him and started walking mindlessly in one direction.
Harry worked out in the gym till he tired himself to the bone. He found the pain in his muscles a good distraction from his thoughts. He went to take a shower in his bedroom, he had two hours before he needs to leave for the ministry. Kingsley gave him the job of the auror the minute he completed his 8th year. He still decided to go through the basic training. Ron changed his thoughts about being an auror after the war, It's good Harry thought. Now Ron worked at the shop with George, the business is going so well that the Weasley's don't have to worry about the money like they used to.
He wondered if it’s the right kinda pic that should be sent to your ex-rival. He stared at the screen waiting for Harry’s reply, biting his lip in anticipation.
Job: Librarian, at the local book shop in 187 Piccadilly, St. James's, London W1J 9LE, United Kingdom. and local restauranr 'all mayham' 2 blocks away from the library
Harry woke up with tears strained on his cheeks and hand on his chest where he shot the sceptemsempra on Malfoy. He gulped down huge gasps of breaths and dug his fingers in his palm so hard to focus on something, anything other than the image of Draco's lifeless body.
“they think you have something to do with the medallion, I would have taken you to the ministry but right now there are few traitors who can hurt you there. Until I think it’s completely safe for you out there, you have to stay here, love”.
It was no secret that Harry was pansexual. The world went upside down when Harry came out as a part of the LGBT community but the noise died down.
Harry appreciated his presence and the silence. He looked out the window and saw the moon emerging from behind the clouds. He thought back to the dream trying to make out something to figure out who the man. It was just pain and agony.
Harry was also wearing traditional Indian attire. A maroon red Kurta to match with black tight pajama and a scarf. His hair was a mess as always. His aura demanded respect in every room he walked not because he defeated Voldemort but because of who he is, which was just the perfect contrast as he walked towards Draco with a smile so bright it could outshine the sun itself.
He rubbed the spot increasing the speed while he thought about Harry fucking him hard and rough into the mattress, claiming his mouth all while his cock slammed his spot again and again. I’m about to cum harry, more.
“I think it was in 6th year. When I went to look for him in abandoned bathroom” he dreaded that memory. “’he and I had a little duel and I shot him with sectumsempra. We were both bleeding, him more than me. I was kneeling over his body when I realised the depth of my feelings for me. I guess that was like a confession and a promise that created the bond while our blood flooded down the drain on the floor.” He finished
“shit, I didn’t mean it in that way,” said Harry hurriedly trying to console the blonde. “it’s okay potter, we all made mistakes, some more than others, I’m assuming there’s a reason why you’ve run all the way here to stop me?”
Harry’s face turned into a smile but he masked it before Draco could see, it was a miracle he didn’t got up and started dancing in the middle of the restaurant, “oh, but you said he was your boyfriend”. Draco let out a frustrated sigh, “I panicked and I just needed to get away, I didn’t know what your intentions were, it’s doesn’t happen every day when your ex enemy shows up at your work place”. Harry looked down at his hands and with an apologetic smile said, “yeah I’m sorry about that”.
Malfoy had a bewildered look on his face. “um Jake”. “Yeah hey, are we still on for the brunch?”. Harry looked at the man interacting with the blonde and a sudden roar of jealousy rose in his gut. he might have puffed out his chest a bit, unconsciously of course.
He didn’t have much work to do, a few meetings on the recent events, playing Jenga in the free time with everyone and listening to Moriarty being a sore looser.
“alright we have three hours, we have to get Draco out before it. Mo and Cassie will stay out on the lookout. Me and Billie will go inside the chapel.” Said Harry looking around the room for any questions.
He never dreamt of Malfoy even once. Maybe because he often thought about Malfoy when he’s awake that his subconscious decided to give him a break during the night, until now. The same dream in three nights, he couldn't even write him a letter since no one knows where he is. It's been 5 years after the war and no one has seen him, the daily prophet wrote articles about him in the beginning, but soon left it alone.
Harry vowed to himself to spent all his life plus those extra years Draco wished upon him to make him happy.
“Actually, we need to protect him.” said Billie. Everyone looked at her confusingly. He knows his team isn’t biased to ex-death eaters. Each of them had one thing in common, that is someone close to them was on the wrong side of the war.
He realised he would not be able to get Draco out of here without getting hurt. He guided Mafloy to take the door to the next approaching floor. When they entered, he hid behind the cut and waited for that man to enter.
“I thought this would go along with your plans for tonight,” said Hermione in his ear. Her smartness never ceases to amaze him. He surged with excitement that he forgot about his empty stomach.
He thought about mentioning the library but he wanted to meat Draco alone. After half an hour an owl came with Hermione’s response
A lot of wizards and witches took up muggle education and muggle jobs, even from pureblood families, but Malfoy’s name was nowhere to be found. It's been 2 hours looking for his name.
Cheeks turned red he involuntarily looked at Harry with Ron who was seated a few tables away from them. He looked away as Draco caught him staring. He smiled and then looked down on his paper again.
Hermione said without looking up, “yeah, Arthur made a strong case on how wizard jobs are not enough for the youth and we need more jobs, Kingsley supported it”.
“you did nothing, babe. Look at me” he said with a little authority. Right now he needed for Draco to focus. He moved towards him and took Draco’s hand in his. “you didn’t kill him”
Eyes were still locked onto each other, neither wanted to move away. This time when Harry kissed him, it was gentle but firm. Draco sighed in the kiss and brought their foreheads together. Harry caressed Draco’s cheek lightly.
“c’mon I want to get mehndi, look how pretty their hands look” she dragged Draco over to a small stall where a couple of Indian girls were applying Mendi on other women.
There were only to on guards inside the room who did not see Harry. Harry went past them to Draco who was lying unconscious on the ground. His heart was in his throat looking at him in this condition.
“ever since I started having nightmares about you, I knew I had to find you” said Harry wiping away Draco’s tears with his thumb. “that at the bookstore, I didn’t just run into you, I came there purposely to see you” he said with a sheepish look. “stalker, I knew you were following me” said Draco with a smug smile.
Draco took Pansy’s cup and drowned that too. He got up slowly and walked to Harry. “you don’t have to do it if you’re not okay, no one’s going to push you” said Harry in a low voice so only Draco would hear. Everyone already got back to the game
“I couldn’t. They wanted me to. But I knew I just couldn’t” said Draco looking down at his feet. Harry lifted his chin with his fingers to look him in the eyes, “I know, I was there. I saw you”.
Draco almost lost his brain processing at how easily Harry had used his first name, “you wish Potter” he managed retorted. He looked towards Ginny “alright then, spin the bottle we- Ginevra”.
He couldn’t. he throws his wand on the ground and got on his knees, “I’m sorry Dray I can’t” he said through loud sobs, “I’m sorry I failed all of you” he looks towards Billie’s now lifeless body
After a few moments of trying, Harry woke with up a hard gasp. This dream was even worse than the other he encountered. And also, different. Like he was in someone else’s body, who was being shot with the crucio again and again by Voldemort.
It's been three nights in a row he's been having the same dream which had never happened. Every time It's a different dream, every time. And every time someone else dies, Sirius, Remus, Fred, Collin. People he couldn't save, people who died because of him. Sometimes it's even about the people who made it through the war, Ron, Hermione, Neville. So he wrote them a letter asking how they were, general stuff, not revealing the real reason behind the letters.
"Yeah Hermione wants to go, she doesn’t know which one yet and you know I'll never say no, and it'll be fun if you came, i think we need a day just for the three of us."
The little pain along with the pleasure was too much to handle for Draco. Harry brought his other hand under his hip and lifted him and Draco wrapped his both legs around Harry and pressed them as close he could.
“of course, what do you need?” she said already excusing her self for privacy. “I want you to look into a guy named Jace Acroes, he’s another auror at the ministry. Call me once you have something” said Harry and hung up.
“second, it erases the memory of the person to accommodate for the memories of the person they’re turning into. It starts with little things. like a change in likeness or dislikeness towards something”. She said.
He took the directions Draco told and soon they reached the building where Draco lived. They both got off the bike and took their helmets off. “I had fun tonight, thank you”, said Draco shifting his weight on his feet. “yeah me too”.
“I need you find how to break the curse on Kingsley, Beatrice will fill you in on the medallion. It’s hard but nothing the brightest witch of all time can’t fix” he said with a genuine smile. “ of course, I will try my best, after all I’ve got my best assistant with me” she said looking towards Ron and making him blush.
“of course, not every godfather gets their godson a copy of an erotica romance novel for their 5th birthday," he said with a grimace but Malfoy laughed and Harry thought It’s not that bad being an idiot if it makes him laugh.
“I have some plans,” he said softly. Hermione sighed to herself as she watched the little scene unfold.
With one flick of his other hand the wand went flying across the room. with one motion of hi hand Mo and Cassie was set free. They moved towards Billie.
Harry’s hand fell from his mouth. They were both too close and breathing heavily. They stood there staring at one another for a few moments. Draco was trapped between the door and Harry’s body.
"Are there any Malfoys even left?” asked Jamie. “only one and no one has seen him after the war” said Moriarty. Harry purposely kept it a secret that he knew where he is.
She ignorned Jamie’s comment, “the person being controlled doesn’t even realize it.” Harry looked at the photos and saw images of Bellatrix. In one image she looked like a perfect Black. White crisp dress robes, not a single hair out of place. In the second image she looked different. Maybe it was the way she was sitting or her clothes that were all black but still held a lady like posture. With every image, he saw how she changed completely to the Bellatrix he remembered, slowly slipping into insanity. A completely different person.
“oh, it’s nothing interest just asking for a case”, he waved it off with his hand and he could tell by her expression she didn’t believe him one bit. Damn this brightest witch of all time and for knowing Harry like the back of her hand.
Cedric wrapped his hand around Harry’s shoulder and pulled him a little closer. Suddenly jealous, Draco reverted his eyes and emptied his cup in one go. Just then the bottle pointed at him and Cedric.
Kreacher was the one who helped getting  down the portrait of Wulburgra which took a lot of convincing, he also called Hermione when he started hurting  himself  during  his nightmares. Hermione being Hermione dragged him to a mind healer like toddler being dragged to a dentist. He appreciated her efforts, though the potions prescribed helped with the depression. But the nightmares never ended. He doubted they ever will.
He roamed around her office like a toddler, touching everything and nothing. There was a muggle photograph of Ron and Hermione at her desk and one of all three of them from Hogwarts. His brain lit up like a bulb.
“promise me please” he said through a choked throat, “I don’t want to be responsible for more deaths Harry”. he held Harry’s neck and joined their forehead, “please” he whispered.
“I’ll manage with the rest, you go help them” he said walking towards the room still under the cloak. He knew Cassie will be alright as the people who entered were none other than Mo and Billie to creating a distraction.
When they landed, Draco felt extremely exhausted. He was having a hard time keeping his eyes open to even look where they have apparated to guess that’s how he feels when someone completely muggle apparates. “here, finish this”, said harry handing him the bar of chocolate.
Right before Billie was about to open the door Harry stopped her hand, “wait, this seems to easy” he said, all he wanted to do was barge in that door and get to Draco but he knew had to be smart about it.
He changed to a black see through night shirt and white shorts. He took the phone and clicked a mirror selfie and sent it to Harry with a caption, “can’t wait to see you again”.
A woman opened the door. her hair was grey and short. She looked old but her body was still lean and muscular. “hello Harry” she said coming out to hug Harry. Harry let go of his hand and hugged her back, “it’s so good to see you Beatrice”.
“send me your location, I’m coming to get you. I’ll tell you everything just do what I say.” Said Harry already taking out his bike and putting on his helmet. His phone pinged and the location was not that far from where he was.
Draco caressed Harry’s cheek, “I think I have a thing for falling into your arms like this.”. Harry gave him a full tooth smile through his watery eyes, “I’ll always be here to catch you my love”
He visited Hermione during  his lunch break, he saw her sitting  in her office writing merlin knows what. He dropped a cup op pumpkin juice at her table which made her look up, “ohh it's you”, he knew Hermione sometimes gets so lost in her work that she forgets the basic necessities.
The got to the trapdoor. Harry held the handle and tried opening it. Billie casted alohomora but the spell was useless. “shit, that fuck. He must have spell proofed the locks. Magic is not going to work Harry”
“but I never created a bond like that with him, I don’t even know how to make a blood bond” he said getting more frustrated. He did some healing charm on his wounds but it still hurts.
“Draco!” he turned around to see Pansy Parkinson standing a few compartments behind him. He stopped abruptly. She came crashing down on him and eloped him in a hug with such force that he had to take a few steps backward, barely saving them from the fall.
He still couldn’t believe that he was sitting in a compartment full of people who would have cursed him dead a few months ago. But it wasn’t that bad. No one bothered him about not playing. Now and then, Luna would ask if wanted more beer or anything. He’ll decline her with a little smile.
“I’m so sorry Alice about whatever happened to your family, but this not the way to make it right. You’ll just be starting another war” he tried to get through to her.
After walking for a few what seemed like hours and taking many turns. The blood trail came to a slightly opened door. They both raised their wand, spells ready on their tongues.
“hey,” his mother called softly. She was standing tall, dressed in the finest of the silks. The only difference was that her face wore a soft smile instead of that hard make-up used to hide all that is beautiful about her.
Harry lay back on his bed, hands under his head, and stared at the wall. He thought about his time with Malfoy in Hogwarts. He figured that his obsession with Malfoy was not only because of the reasons he thought were true, long before the war but just couldn't bring himself to accept it. Every time Harry thought about starting something new or going on dates likes Hermione suggested he just couldn't help but think of Malfoy, so he stopped thinking about it at all.
“Fuck it,” said Harry and crashed their lips together in a hard kiss. Draco kissed back with equal enthusiasm. Harry was overwhelmed with the sensations. He was drowning in Draco's smell, he smelled like vanilla and god damn he tasted almost angelic mixed with the taste of beer on his lips.
His thoughts came to a stop when he saw Draco walking to him. Harry’s heart skipped a beat when he saw Draco had a soft smile on his face directed towards him.
He has to talk to Draco alone. The medallion absorbs dark magic and Malfoy has no magic at all. He knows that because for the time he was with him he felt no magic radiate off him
“great, we’re abducting the minister of Magic”, clarified Jamie. Other thing they all had in common, their love for reckless adventures that could probably end their lives. Harry couldn’t be more proud.
That morning Draco woke up before the sunrise to drink a glass of water as he won’t get to drink any till night. He made sure to eat something that would last long throughout the day as well, as he had to make arrangements for the other guests arriving for the ball.
“I’m always up for something illegal I can’t get the record without a warrant but you're lucky the guard Larry owes me a favour” she winked at him and went out. Fighting with Bane to have Alice on his team was so much worth it.
Kreacher bowed his head, instead of just leaving he sat on the small chair in Harry’s room. Every time Harry had an episode that was worse than usual, he would just sit there in silence with Harry until Harry went back to sleep or left for the gym.
He sank to the floor as soon as the line went dead. Mo came and sat beside him and pulled Harry into side hug, “ we’ll get him back safe man” his words did little to comfort Harry but he was lucky he still had a team he could trust.
“Pansy we’re about to start” called none other than Ronald Weasley before he could respond to Pansy. He looked at him and then at Pansy then back at him and then raised his eyebrow towards Pansy.
It was Saturday, he didn’t have much to do, and the constant jitters of possibly getting to see Malfoy today, made him useless to do anything else. He spent hours cleaning his room manually which would take only minutes by magic, but right now he needed to kill time. He looked at the clock and frowned when he saw it was only 10 AM.
“okay, I find a potion to put you in a sleep like haze. You will need anchors on both sides. While Draco is your anchor on another side, Ron will be your anchor on this side” she
The conversation between the guys inside. He was filled with disgust and anger making it hard for him control his magic. There were at least six or seven guys inside. Harry knew he can’t walk in there, if he was alone he would have done that like yesterday. But he couldn’t let Draco hurt anymore when he’s already bled so much creating the blood trail.
He cursed the time for going too slow and hopped into a proper bubble bath with candles, yeah, he’s a grown man who likes taking bubble baths, sue him! He felt like going on a blind date, the only difference was the other person is completely oblivious of this little information. Harry spent half an hour thoroughly cleaning himself.
so i started this story with something else and now it's going somewhere else, i really hope you all like it.
He can’t stop looking at Draco though as he might disappear if he moved his eyes even for a second. When they returned to Grimmauld Palace Draco was already asleep in his arms.
Harry snorted at his statement, " cmon Zabini we both know he'd smoke you in the court". Zabini walked away.
he thought looking at him. “your phone is easily trackable; I’ll get you a new one with all the security charms on it”. Draco looked at him furiously and said, “you better!”
“he you” said Harry, voice softer than cotton. “heya back” said Draco with a little smile, still coming back to his consciousness. “we’re almost of out of here okay” he said caressing the side of Draco’s face. “I knew you’d always come, my saviour” he said getting up and holding Harry close.
To say he was nervous would be an understatement. In the gist of getting to see Malfoy, he completely forgot what he’s actually going to say to him. After half an hour of playing dress-up with Alice— and another 15mins of her encouraging him— while she did her hair for her date, he was finally feeling confident in what he was wearing, a black t-shirt with white stripes and white pants and a blue jacket to finish the look, and his hair was a lost cause so he didn’t even bother.
Harry was not even expecting to even see the blonde today but when passed by the window of the restaurant he ran towards him ignoring his friends, thinking it was now or never.
“Master Harry is too kind, thank you" Kreacher bowed his head in the highest form of respect, Harry smiled and scratched behind his ears and they both headed to the kitchen.
When Draco turned around and saw Potter, the air left his lung. At first, he thought that this was one of those surprise confidential auror visits, but this was no ordinary auror, it was Harry freaking Potter. He knew he didn’t do anything wrong since the war but still, the shadow of being a death eater never left him.
Malfoy looked like he could be anywhere but between the two men “yeah uh right, Potter this Is Jake, he’s my...” Malfoy paused before adding “boyfriend, he’s my boyfriend”.
It didn’t look small to Draco, “we need to stop, you’re bleeding. You need to cast some healing spells now”. He said checking the wound. “I will, we’re almost there”.
“umm yeah, Uhm, Jake this is Harry Potter, my umm school... " started Malfoy, “we were in school together, I just happen to ran into him today" finished Harry, Jake moved his hand forward and Harry shook his hand with a tight grip.
Being the head of department of magical creatures is no walk in a park. She raised the petition for free wolfsbane solutions to werewolves and also free treatment of the newly bitten.
Once the guards were on the ground, he picked Malfoy up and started walking towards the same way he came in. when he reached the ladder, he carefully put Draco down. The movement made Draco open his eyes.
“we gotta do this off records, we can’t let anyone know about the minister until we have some proof. Billi and cassie go up to his office and get him to Grimmalud palace. The wards will let you in. don’t tell him anything until I get there. Mo Jamie, you’re coming with me.”
Harry was furious, he was having a hard time controlling his magic. He got up and dragged Alice’s chair to another room. he locked the door and turned towards her. he kicked Alice’s chair from behind, “get up!” he growled. Alice started coming out of her consciousness, “what the fuck?” she said blinking her eyes to adjust and looking around the room.
Harry looked down and Draco turned his head to see his expression, he was breathing hard and deep. Harry looked back up and Draco saw the green in his eyes being covered by the black.
“I can’t you look so beautiful like this,” Harry replied. He circled the thali in front of Harry’s face the agarbatti was already lit, its rosy scent only added to their environment. He prayed to every deity who would listen to him to wish all the happiness in the world to Harry along with a long and prosperous life.
Draco looked back and saw Harry was just walking right behind, apparently checking out his ass. He hooked his fingers in his pants and pulled them a little up in an act to adjust them a bit, or really just highlight his ass more.
“Cassie and Billy, you two figure out if you can find the spell that activates it, James I need you to look for any counter curses that can work against that” ordered Harry. His suspicions about a certain Malfoy was growing minute by minute and he didn’t like not knowing.
He remembered the first few days he joined auror team, Beatrice Malice was the head of the team he was assigned to. He remembered how much paper work she made him do. It was after 6 months he was allowed to go on his first field mission, she didn’t treated him like The Golden Boy, but rather someone who had a lot to prove just like everyone else, not for the world but for his own sake.
The waiter came over, it was an old lady, maybe in her 50s, “what can I get you lovebirds?”. “oh we’re not…”,” he’s not my..”. They both said at the same time, but the waitress got the hint,” oh my apologies for assuming”, she said.
With the corner of his eye, he saw Cedric move away from Harry and wrap his hands around Cho who kissed him in return. When Cedric looked back at him and let out a laugh knowing Draco understood what he did. Draco blushed furiously.
Harry silently opened it and began walking downstairs slowly. It was dark so he casted a Lumos and searched the area. He turned, and suddenly came face to face with none other than Draco. He almost fell to the ground from the shock. “drop, your wand or he gets it!” came the hissing voice of Alice from behind him.
“I always come prepared for anything Harry” she said and took out a clear liquid vial. “this, will create a temporary break through the spell”
Harry hid behind a bookshelf to not startle him. He noticed Malfoy had grown his hair long and was tied in a messy bun. And merlin did he look so damn adorable in his white oversized sweater which made him look so tiny, and those black leggings were made in hell he was sure.
Alice looked at him like she couldn’t believe this was happening, but fuck it, she’s a Slytherin and Slytherins always help a friend in need. She took a deep breath, “okay”
With a sudden wave of confidence, he said, “oh, I’m fasting for you?” he kept his tone nonchalant. Harry who mostly avoided looking Draco in the eyes, abruptly looked at him and stared before he could get his brain to function again.
Harry felt Draco stiffen from Blais's gesture. he wrapped a possessive arm around Draco's waist and pulled him close. He rubbed soothing circles from his thumb on the naked skin which made Draco relax completely into him.
“Avada kedavra” harry snapped his neck above him and saw it was Draco who did it. No, that’s not how it was. Draco didn’t kill dumbledore. He didn’t.
“can’t Kingsley help you? After the war he helped me disappear, got me a job and everything”. Harry sat up on his elbows, “wait, Kingsley knew where you were?” he said, confirming his thoughts.
“I promised Draco I would protect him no matter what” he said feeling the weight of everything that has happened. He had no idea if Draco was in there or not. He had no idea whom to trust. Alice was like a sister to her. She reminded him so much of Tonks that he couldn’t believe she would do this to him even in his wildest dreams
The game went on, more stupid dares and truths, but Draco was having a really hard time focusing. It was a long ride and he was doing his best not to move at all and keep his breathing in control and the sudden tightening in his pants.
He composed himself, “No thanks, I think I’ll just take some other compartment,” He said in a plain tone.
The train was already on the move. Draco didn’t participate in the game so he sat there drinking his beer slowly. He watched as his friends and his ex-enemies enjoyed a simple game of truth and dare.
“sure thing, I’ll take the portkey to France for two” said Jace. “actually, you go there alone, I’ll go to Knockturn alley, I have a gist I’ll find something there, we’ll cover more leads this way”, said Harry already in the floo and left for Knockturn alley.
, though he, and laughed his way to his bed and fell into a peaceful slumber the moment his head hit the pillow.
They both walked towards the restaurant and Harry opened the door for Draco, “putting all you gentlemen skills on the table today now are we” said Draco with a playful smirk. Harry leaned in a bit and said in Draco’s ear, “oh Draco you have no idea”. Draco’s grip on his sling bag tightened and his face was equivalent to a tomato.
Draco already has a life; he’s not going to mess it up by bringing in his feelings. Nope, he is going to be a perfect gentleman tomorrow, he’ll swoon Draco with his manners and hoping that the porcelain beauty will fall in love with him.
“meet me at the balcony after the ball Harry” he stood on his tippy toes and leaned in to plant a soft kiss on Potter’s cheek, carefully to keep his hands at a distance, and then walked into his room.
He saw Malfoy’s cheeks had a light blush like he didn’t mean to say that out loud. And there goes Harry’s brain to mouth connection. Malfoy clicked his fingers in front of Harry’s face and he realized he’d been staring at Malfoy a little too long. “it’s for Teddy, he loves books”, he said quickly.
“why can’t my life be just boring!” groaned Draco. “that option went out the window when you said yes for a date with me” said Harry with a cocky smile. Draco gave a tired smile in return. He would follow this man anywhere in the world but the situation still made him feel anxious.
Harry noticed Draco’s hand where he held Jace’s with wide eyes. Jace followed his stare ad with shock he tried to remove his hand from Draco’s. But the tables were already turned.
Harry was so close to the orgasm he speeded a little. He bit down on Draco’s lip and he pulled hard on Harry’s hair, “I’m so close Harry, fuck don’t stop”
After a moment he gave up. He’ll talk to Hermione seriously about this. He wished he had someone to hold him tight at that moment, his mind could only come up with one face, Draco.
“please!” draco writhed under Jace’s grip. “you promised” he said with teary eyes. He wanted to tell Draco that it’s going to be okay, that he’s going to save. But he wasn’t sure if that was true anymore.
“No need to be so dramatic Harry. he needs to go through full transformation. His magic is trying to undo the curse but it’s impossible. The only way he survives is if you let me go and complete the spell” she said like it was that easy.
He got up from his bed, it was almost past 4 pm. He washed his face and buried all his thought about Potter and changed for his shift at the restaurants. Sure, living in a muggle world was peaceful but it wasn’t cheap even with two jobs Draco struggled a bit. He locked his apartment and went about his day.
They still had to deal with the press conferences and everything but he couldn’t worry about it now, not with Draco lying so peacefully by his side, away from all the troubles.
Before he could say anything her phone rand. Harry took out her phone from her pocket and saw it was Jace. He went outside ignoring the threats Alice threw his way. Kingsley was again unconscious.
When they got on the bike Draco sat a little closer and held him a little tighter. In that moment Harry was content to have Draco’s warmth pressed behind him, his vanilla scent filling his senses and something which was uniquely Draco. He could feel Draco’s one hand on his shoulder and the other hesitantly sat on his side waist, he took his hand and moved it so now it was on his abdomen, “hold tight” he said in a low voice. At his word Draco fisted Harry’s shirt.
Malfoy turned around, taking the AirPods out of his ears. He stared wide-eyed at Harry and backed away in what little space was left between him and the bookshelf.
“I’ll do everything I can to find him sir”, usually he would tell him things that at time he could not trust his team with but something was not right. “I want you to take one of my auror with you” he said gesturing towards the man standing in front of his office.
“what is it?” asked Mo. “Alice said she was from Dumstrang right?” he shoved the photos towards Mo. “but how? I checked her profile at the time she came here. I even got the confirmation from the school?”
he raised his wand and pointed it towards Draco. “oh I see” says Jace taking in the scene before him. “do it, Harry. Be the saviour, do what you need to do” he challenged.
He got off the bed and went into his study, his team followed him inside. He pushed everything off the table and unfolded a map of London. “I saw a road sign that said ledbudy road, launderette. Jace must have took him nearby this road.”
Draco tightened his hand Around Harry, “you, were?” he asked. “yeah, I know Snape was the one who did. Dumbledore knew he had to die too”.
Beatrice didn’t hire them out of pity but she saw that each of them shown remarkable talents that were going being, no one would hire them because of stupid prejudices. And in return they proved themselves worthy. Harry was sceptical of his team at first but soon got over it when he saw how remarkably talented they all are in their fields.
“yeah, every damn one, nothing”. Alice was one the best in her field, if she says she checked every record there is no way she would have missed Malfoy name in the muggle registrar. “can you find the connection the Black family has to the medallion, go to my house library, maybe something is there in the old books”
“crucio” said Alice and Mo fell to the ground in agonizing pain. “fine, don’t hurt him” said harry dropping his wand. “kick it towards Jace” she demanded. Gritting his teeth, he did.
He hugged her and pecked her on the cheek. They have never been this affectionate towards each other, but after Lucius being away and the house arrest, they opened up to each other.
He used the opportunity to explore Draco’s mouth with his tongue. Draco brought his hands up to Harry’s neck and hair. They were softer than he had imagined. He pulled his leg up to pull Harry closer by the waist.
“I’m sorry for this, but you are under the control of the medallion you brought us as a case” he said. “Bullshit, I’m the minister. You think I wouldn’t know if someone tried to take control over me” he replied angrily.
Harry watched him go and he groaned when he was out of sight. He contemplated when to go to the front desk,
Now Draco knows this is stupid. But he had already made up his mind. He was going too fast for Harry Potter on Karrwa Chauth. It’s is a festival celebrated by Hindu women from the Indian Subcontinent on the fourth day after Purnima in the month of Kartika.
The bottle ends on Harry and Neville. “Alright, Harry, truth or Dare” slurred a more than a little tipsy Neville.
Those word felt like someone took a huge load off of his shoulders of being The Chosen One, Voldemort was dead and Harry was no longer The Golden Boy. He’s Harry Potter, head of the auror team of five drunken bastards. She meant more to him than dumbledore.
“it’s okay, I’ll have a coffee, black please”, said harry and the waitress turned towards Malfoy. “I’ll have a Cinnamon Roll Frappuccino Blended Coffee, extra sugar”, ordered Malfoy. His cheeks still burning red from the waitress’s prior assumption.
“You came back,” she said a little breathless, “I told Blaise you’ll be back”. So, Blaise was also attending.
Harry noted down the address and turned the book back into a coin size and told Alice to keep it back. He went home and took out his laptop. He owned few muggle devices, like an iPhone to facetime Dudley and his niece, a camera filled with pictures of holidays at Weasleys, TV with Netflix subscription.
“there’s only one way to find out” said Jamie and sat down on to her desk. He took out the yearbook. After the war, wizards really adapted to muggle technologies. “it says her name is Alicia Lunox”.
After few minutes the spelled that bounded the building indicated that someone not invited had entered inside. Once most of the people in the room were out to look for the threat, “go after them” he said. “but what about you?” asked Cassie.
Mo and James were staying at his place, too exhausted to apparate home. Cassie was with Billie and Harry was finally at peace.
“Alright, truth or dare Malfoy,” asked Cedric with that same stupid grin on his face as he could see right through Draco. How his jaw clenched as he noticed him caressing the side of Harry’s arm and how uncomfortable he was at how close they were sitting.
“well we Can’t exactly say that in front of the council that we think he’s turning into some big baddie because he’s taking tea instead of coffee” said Jamie. “I can look for evidence in that context”
He took out his invisibility cloak charmed to fit his back pocket. He always took the cloak everywhere he went. He enlarged it and got under it. He then again made his way to apparition point without hitting anyone.
Draco knew those green weren’t lying to him, he breathed deeply, “fine, I’ll go to dinner with you, for now, I have to get to work”, he saw how Potter’s face lit up like a Christmas tree, his eyes were even greener when he’s smiling.
“we’re going to the bazarre. Hermione wants you to join. No excuses.” He said with shrug. He knew denying Ron would only make the queen herself come upstairs to drag him down
“Wow you don’t get it at all do you?! Voldemort tortured muggles in front of his army to show them how useless they were. Every person you gave a “second chance” to did nothing while he tortured our mother. While he and his father stood by and watched him murder hundreds of muggles.” Said Jace. “We’re cleansing this world the way you can never do” he said sitting on his heels in front of Harry.
“Um yeah, I mean... it’s a good book I think”. Malfoy had a smirk on his face, “sure, you must be a fun godfather". Harry laughed a little embarrassingly.
“that’s cause we’re not under the chapel, the trapdoor was just a portal to somewhere” he said looking both ways to look where to go.
His excitement didn’t last long. His phone rang, “someone took Malfoy” came Beatrice’s voice,  knocking the air out of his lungs.
Harry are Draco are lying curled up in Harry’s bed. Draco is sleeping with his head on Harry’s chest and Harry’s hand wrapped protectively around Draco.
He was making Jace feel the pain he gave other. The pain of all the innocent lives he and his sister took. The pain of the people in their lives. Every single ounce of pain.
Harry had no answer to why he was here that would seem appropriate for the situation, but thank merlin his brain was quick to come up with something. “ I was just passing by, and thought to stop by”.
. He didn’t see any physical injuries on him. “Killing them one by one by was a lot of work. Months ago, we came to find about this medallion. I know Billie had it figured out by about how it works. We are going to bring back our father. See he was the mastermind of this whole operation. Unfortunately, he died due to cancer, not even wizards can figure out how to cure that. What’s better than to bring him back as the minister of magic.” She said with an evil smirk. Harry couldn’t even recognize who she was anymore. “you’ll never get away with this” he growled.
Before Harry could say anything else or before he changed his own mind, Draco sat crossed-legged on his bed and clicked a picture and sent it.
Once he reached there, he started walking down the street to the apparition point and called Alice. “hey, I need you to do something, you’re the only one l can trust right now”, he said as soon as she picked up.
Harry took a deep breath and explaines, “today at the office, Kingsley brought us a new case. It’s about a dark artifact, a medallion to be precise. Last it was seen on Lucius Malfoy”.
Draco saw Blaise walking towards, he was there to represent the American community in the wizarding world. Everybody knew that Draco was promised to Zabini by his father, but that world changed when Draco broke off the engagement when his father went to prison and proceeded to price everyone wrong who thought Draco will never be able to handle a position of power, including his father.
Outside his head, Harry’s body was going into seizure. He violently started thrashing his hands around, “harry wake up, c’mon mate wake up!!” tried Ron trying to shake him up. Harry sat upright with a bold breathing heavily. He saw Ron and immediately hugged him tight thanking every deity that existed.
“master harry, please wake up” said Kreacher. His hands trying to wake Harry up from his nightmares again. “it’s just a dream master Harry, please wake up” he tried again.
Harry was so close to burning up his entire wardrobe. He couldn’t find anything to wear and even when he did choose a shirt, he couldn’t find matching pants. It was almost 12PM and he was freaking out like Ron on the day of the Yule ball. Defeatedly, he sent a Patronus to Alice screaming it's an emergency.
He walked towards Malfoy and stood behind him, Malfoy was still busy arranging the books on the aisle, humming some music Harry never heard before. he cleared his throat to say something. it startled Malfoy and a book fell out of his hand.
“yes,” he said breathlessly, “god yes” he shook his hand desperately to get on with it. Harry sealed their lips together again. He kissed his way down his neck and rolled his hips at the same time he bit into his neck.
He also noticed that Harry wasn’t eating anything either, “why aren’t you eating?” he asked when they were finally done shaking everybody’s hand.
"No thanks mate, I already  ate, I actually came over for a favour" he said with a sheepish  look on his face
Draco climbed out first and then Harry. when Harry came up, It was like all his fears had come true. Along with Jace’s men his own team was on the ground and Billie was bleeding that she was lying on her own blood. Jace had Draco kneeled at his feet, hair held tight by a grip too painful and wand at ready under his chin.
He slowly tucked a strand of hair behind his ear and moved his fingers down his face. Draco stirred a bit and then he slowly opened his eyes. He smiled when he saw Harry looking down at him. “hey” said harry, face filled with adoration for sleep hazed man.
But Harry couldn’t believe the sight before him. Draco’s hair was disheveled, his lips a bit swollen and red. His cheeks held the cutest blush he’s ever seen.
His babbling was stopped with Draco’s lips. His heart stopped for a moment, Draco’s lips were softer than he always imagined, it was a light kiss and before he could respond it was over. “I would like to count this as a date and also I would love to go on another date with you”.
“Tea, to sooth master. Does master want Kreacher to call someone?” asked Kreacher. Harry wiped down his face with his hands and said in a voice laced with grief but still he managed to put up a light smile for Kreacher,” thank you Kreacher, and no please don’t call anyone”.
They both groaned at the feeling of each other’s evident arousal. Harry pulled back a little to breathe, but not too far. Their lips were still touching. “I need to hear you say you want this Draco” his heavy voice made Draco’s knees weak like never before.
“Of course, you stupid Gryffindors,” he said in-between his laugh. Harry’s kissed him again. He couldn’t stop now that he’s gotten a taste of it.
It was because of this that his team of five auror members, Jamie, Moriarty, Alice, Billie and Cassie voted for him to lead the team after Beatrice retired, and she was happy to give him her place. “The world will always see you as Harry Potter, don’t ever let their opinions be an influence on your decisions kid, or you’ll always be disappointed. You gave this world enough now live your life" she had told him in the pub where they were celebrating her retirement.
Draco looked at him, “Harry” he said in a whisper. “yeah It’s me”. After making sure he was focused on Him, Harry wrapped his arm around Draco and picked him up. If he was someplace safe, he won’t even let Draco walk, he’ll be giving him all the care in the world a person needs after an episode but right now they needed to hurry.
He walks over to Beatrice who was going through his liquor collection, “all the money and you still can’t buy a proper bottle of gin” she said. he gives her a shy smile, “Beatrice, I know I shouldn’t ask you but could you to stay here and keep an eye on Kingsley and Alice?” he asked.
Draco noticed how much Harry had changed, physically and otherwise as well. He was taller, stronger and he carried himself with more confidence now. Harry got on the ground and waited for Draco to mount his back.
Listening to her shouts Harry ran to his living room and saw Alice ready to shoot any threats with her wand. Which was rather ridiculous seeing her appearance was not at all threatening. “I need help deciding what to wear?” said Harry.
Draco doesn’t know if it’s the voice or being called baby that made him suck harder and nod. Harry got back to leaving marks on his neck and rolling his hips in rhythm along with it.
“Man, why does every bad guy have to be insensitive, I gave her best partner in the world cup!!” said Jamie with a whine. “Mo and I are going to her place”.
“neither, I just have a personally vendetta against the Malfoys, but I assure you my personal reasons will not come in the way on this case, it’ll only serve as motivation to find him”. Harry swore he’ll never let this man go even an inch closer to Draco let alone find him.
Pictures of Draco and the whole Malfoy family, along with people who were Voldemort followers, decorated the wall, some who were dead were crossed in red. He walked over to the picture of Narcissa Malfoy. He had heard when he was training that she died of heart attack but there was no solid proof. Eventually the aurors let it go thinking it was on less
They breathed each other in heavily, still holding on to one another. Harry gently put Draco down and performed a silent cleaning charm on them both.
Everybody went silent. Draco was turning red by the seconds. He was mortified and confused. Harry sat a little straight. “it’s just a stupid dare Draco, get it over with so we can move on with the game” said Pansy.
“Later, we don’t have time right now, I need you to pack a bag and take only necessary things”, said Harry already walking towards the closet. “What, what do you mean. Harry Potter I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell is going on!!” he said standing his ground.
