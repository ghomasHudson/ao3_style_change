Harry stares dumbfounded for a second before following him. He stands with his toes touching the wall and reaches a hand forwards. He frowns when he meets glass that’s cold, firm, and very
"Why would you ask?" Harry replies casually.
After knowing each other for so long one would think that Malfoy's face would be familiar enough. But right this moment, in the stillness of the night, all Harry can focus on is his eyes. And he doesn't remember taking notice of them before, not really. It is fascinating how light they can look. It’s hard to tell where the gray of his irises gives way to the whites. Harry might as well be seeing him for the first time.
The first few years had been the hardest, leaving everything he knew so he could become Tom´s son. And two years later he sill found himself struggling with it.
—Lie, be brief, play dumb
—Yes, apparently, we are not supposed to talk, are you suing him or something? —he asked intrigued, trying to guess what was that she wanted.
—He had to leave anyway— he said shrugging—. But for the record I’m making my mom feel guilty by pretending to be heartbroken
He nodded and she continued.
—Does it have to be Malfoy? —Harry rushed to ask, making Snape raised his eyebrows —. I mean…we don´t really get along
Except he really wasn’t supposed to be here this time.
Harry was about ready to complain but something was strange in Tom´s voice. Confused he moved the phone away to quickly share his location.
Ahhh Tom thought, there it was
Bellatrix just looked at him, it felt long, as if analyzing him.
people will talk Petunia
—Is what you wanted to get at, right?
—Even Blaise got it right away —Audrina added—. Is cute really, how they tried to pass it as casual by making it a lunch, I mean they even threw Regulus into the mix
—That man thinks he can drop him here whenever he wants? He ought to pay child support because that kid is going to boarding school and is not coming out of my pocket
—I thought you meant people with financial freedom, I don´t know how much help we can get from people our own age
Harry saw her leaving the room and tried to acomotaed himself better on the bed to wait. It been two year since the last time he saw Tom.
—What…Are you… sniffing me? — he asked laughing —. Someone told me you had like a good sense of smell but dude…
Harry faltered a little at that, They had just found out Neville was an omega, the only one in their grade beside Blaise… as far as anyone else knew.
—I’m going to put this on the baby´s room —Harry said taking the gift, determined to ignore Draco.
— she said stressing the las word, the real meaning of that for them, left unsaid—. Just make sure to negotiate the parties with your mother, they are essential
—Ron, can you come down for a second? There something we need to talk about — she said before walking back into the room, obviously expecting him to follow.
If he tried to remember those days, right before he left. The memories were mostly overwhelming, but he could find a lot of anger and hurt, towards Tom, Bella, his aunt and uncle… but about Morfin? No…
—Speaking of, got to go — he said to them before hurrying to the door.
The girl looked at him weirdly.
—What a day uh? — Frank said to him, rubbing his hand in greedy manner that seemed almost parodic.
—There are perfectly good school here in Surrey
He typed that and threw his phone on the bed, as if it was on fire, he wasn’t surprised when it started ringing just a few minutes later.
—What do you mean he didn’t want to meet me?
—Nobody asked you to…
He considered the situation, he could not show his cards yet, he was not strong enough and would have to trade carefully until they were ready
—So what? you two getting back together?
—I haven’t lied — he offered calmy. He really wanted to flash forward this session. It couldn’t be helped however, psychiatrists just loved to play games.
— We are going to call the ambulance, did you hit your head?
—O shut up! As if this isn’t for you to get a fucking pat on the shoulder from your father
Ron´s phone started to buzz and he took it out of his pocket to check
—With Malfoy? You must be joking— Ron said after he finished telling him how it had gone with Snape—. But you got a 70 on that test
Narcissa bit her tongue, realizing her mistake.
—You father married her because she was a dog, because dogs are supposedly nurturing,
—A coffee shop, Tom what´s going on?
—I talked to agent Remus, he is willing to speak in your behalf,  he is… aware that juvie is very often not a solution and would rather work with me in getting you a place to live…and if there is a family that could provide that for you…
Malfoy ignored him walking to the fridge and taking a beer out of it.
—And while we are on this subject, Don’t do that again —
Harry looked at Regulus for confirmation.
The way she said it, with a clear mock of innocence irritated him and Harry found himself wishing Tom would hurry. Couldn’t she just say what she wanted to say?
He considered the situation, he could not show his cards yet, he was not strong enough and would have to trade carefully until they were ready. He took his cellphone to type a message.
—Hi…— he started unsure, caught off guard.
Harry laughed
—You can´t talk to Morfin
—I got detained at an appointment, I’m at the Hogwarts pick up now, I don´t see you
—Ms Malfoy, why are you interrogating me? — he said, getting upset.
While Harry was pondering over this, He was so up in his head that he didn’t hear anyone coming, until he was hit by the kitchen door opening.
—Could you elaborate?
Ron finished pouring something into two red cups and handed him one.
—That is because my mother was a snake, Non-Beast, I’m afraid are not the best incubator for our species
He got a dreadful sensation on stomach immediately after, that stupid feeling he got when he thought he was in trouble. He knew he had gone too far, yelling and then leaving Tom hanging…still, when the phone ringed again he threw it against the wall, breaking it.
—You get nothing but pampered and spoiled
Bellatrix laughed.
Tom walked out swiftly, and Bellatrix was left to rot in anger.
would seems
Harry kept his eyes on him until he was at a safe distance. Then he turned to Ron, enraged.
Officially they had all been told on Friday that Milo was back. And as part of the facade, they had to pretend they had been in contact all this time, hence Regulus annoyance.
—By marriage — he cleared quickly.
—Well once you are back you should come stay with us — he heard Draco grunting in the background, probably not happy with that idea.
—I hadn’t even thought about it, but good to know— They both laughed
Harry tuned himself out of the conversation as Neville approached him.
In the dining room the food was already served, but not signs of anybody else yet, he wondered if he should expect to see Bellatrix.
—I guess we´ll never know — she said finally, resigned, tired.
They were hiding behind the art building while discussing the case of Bellatrix.
—Yes, Morfin — He announced proudly
—Ohhh that — he said remembering —. I don´t know, things aren´t good between me and Tom so I don´t really want to ask him for anything, and he is set on picking me up every day so I figure going to a party will be less than a maybe
—Any plans for the summer?
—Ok darling, sorry for the wait — came Madame Malkin’s out of the back room carrying a bunch of packages that she lay over the counter—. So… is four pants with the fixed hem, just as we measured…let’s see… the sweaters… — she kept checking if everything was there —. Tie, socks, all set for the school year
—Are you beast? — Hermione inquired.
—Fuck…that’s…messed up, Riddle must have been furious— Regulus said.
—You have been gone for a while
—My father is here, he says hello—
—…Bella doesn’t really like people going in there— Draco grunted, exasperated at hearing that.
—I spoke to your father about the trip to Norway
Regulus seemed troubled all of a sudden.
…So…what if he really had to stay here again. It hadn’t hit him until now, this could be permanent…or at least long term, who knew how much time it would take for Bellatrix to stabilize, for her instincts to accept him…how long until she didn’t felt threaten, who knew how long he would need to stay here…he didn’t think he could take it.
—I do everything you say doctor, how is that not valuing your opinion? — he asked smiling.
—Yes, but she is always been, and he still married her, right?
He looked in the direction of the counter where Bellatrix was waiting for their drinks and wondered what could have possibly possessed Tom to ambush him with this.
—What do you mean?
Harry took a deep shaky breath, Tom could had asked many questions, "what do you mean meet you?", "when they told me what?"...the fact that he didn´t ask anything made him think he knew exactly what Harry was talking about.
Harry nodded vaguely. He was getting tired.
Draco opened his mouth, ready to backtrack when he saw something out of the corner of his eye, he turned to find his father.
—. You guys said you wanted to see more of Draco… — Pansy said  mischievously, giving him the side eye.
—O yes… is a pity— Bellatrix said picking up a napkin and starting to play with it—. But when you are upset, I can see it, you two get the same distant expression in your eyes
Knowing Bellatrix, Harry had expected to be dropped at the house swiftly and with minimal conversation, so her invitation for coffee had caught him by surprise and he couldn’t think of a way to refuse.
—I don´t want to know — he cut him quick.
—Regulus? My cousin Regulus?
—You know me so well, So to what do I own the pleasure?
Tom waited for her to be far enough before continuing. A few turns later he found the room.
He took a deep breath, and that familiar smell filled his nose again. He never knew what flower was exactly, but in the two years he was away, whenever he felt that fragrance it reminded him of home.
—Thank you — He said taking a sip immediately to warm himself up —. Tom just called
—Jesus Pansy— Draco commented
Harry moved brusquely at that, turning to look at him frowning, like he couldn’t believe what he just said.
After the call ended Tom let himself fall on his chair and threw his head back in exhaustion. He was tired of entertaining people like Karkaroff, as if they presented any type of authority. They wanted him as a part of their den because he was from an old lineage, the most important one in Europe and the only snake family remaining in England, but that did not stop them from mentioning occasionally, how surprised they were about the power he carried, being a bastard and all.
—I do everything you say doctor, how is that not valuing your opinion? — he asked smiling.
The Zacharias dude seemed unbothered, but Harry looked between him and Ron and felt a slight tension. He would have to remember to ask him later why he didn´t like the fella, although he already had his own theory.
—What do you mean? — he asked playing dumb, in the way he had seen his mother do so often—. I thought he was doing good in Durmstrang
—Why are
—I know it sounds stupid— He admitted —. I´ll think of something
—You know what we both need? —Regulus started as if it was an epiphany—. Rich girlfriends
The burrow, just as the family financial situation, had seen better times, and now it seemed set on reflecting the difficult current situation, probably on hand of his mother just don´t having any time to care for it recently.
—Look amm — She read the file that on her hand, to see what his name was. He tried not to take it personally —. Milo…—
—Nerves? — Bellatrix said indignantly —. Well, what would you know about nerves— Narcissa bit her tongue and handed her the cup —. Is all just so stressful, he could be the first snake to be born in England… in ages!
—Yes miss Granger, except the girls— The professor accepted with a kind smile —. So here we have some trees from families that adhered to one custom or the other. You can see how more prevalent breeds, able to produce many children, like dogs and lyons, adopted the ottoman style, and thrived on it— He pointed at one drawing where the Black shield could be seen—. Some others went the complete opposite and in an effort of producing the most irrefutable heir, pure English style, started marrying each other, this was a very common problem until the last century or so, and some species have almost become extinct because of it —He pointed vaguely to the reptile three his eyes briefly finding Harry´s on the classroom but he quickly went onto the next subject probably knowing it could get sensitive —. We can see both influences among different English Beast families.
He accommodated his body where he was pressed against car door, right where the sun was hitting. It was instinctive , even when sleeping the snake in him was trying to stay warm.
—Nothing yet, but I’m waiting for it
—in… What? like… pajama parties? — they both laughed at the idea.
—I don´t know, money? Divorce things — he said shrugging.
—So lets do that
—So, are you coming on Friday? you haven’t answered any of the group’s texts
—He is not bad, you can trust him
Tom, took long steps to reach his study, not wanting anyone to hear this conversation. After he had closed the door, he finally approach his desk to take the call.
For the next few nights he had trouble falling asleep, and it was as it used to be, before everything, before finding out he was a snake, before Tom. He felt in the cage again, defenseless, alone, numb.
—Oh, ok…so— he fidgeted nervously.
When the door opened again to let something in It wasn’t Tom who came in though.
—That’s alright — he said —.  I’m mad at you too
It was just so random, what business was of the Notts to be throwing her nephews a party?
—Well then trust
—Cut the crap Draco, nobody liked him—Blaize said rolling his eyes.
—I’m not supposed to push my own beliefs on the matter onto the patient
Draco threw his head back signing.
—Hey, how is Durmstrang going?
Harry frowned.
—So here I am at school for the start of the new year — Pansy said to her phone screen, transmitting live to her followers. She turned a little trying to show her surrounding—. We are at the gymnasium waiting for the assembly to begin.
This chapter chapter and the following are fragments of the past
—Peasant name? Really Malfoy—Malfoy came close, took something from the table and hit him on the head with it.
His phone started to buzz. He pursed his lips annoyed at seeing “Tom” on the screen.
—Uh? …I’m not very hungry — he saw that Tom wanted to say something else but was interrupted.
—Your voice has change—
—My mom just came in and is making faces at me…she is scolding me now…mom I don´t understand — he heard Draco´s voice like it was from afar now —. Would you rather I give the phone? — he heard some squabble going on the other side before Ms Malfoy´s voice came through
—Shit…—Regulus said while holding his cigarette midair, pausing before taking a drag.—. You think they paid to get her out?
—Money to pay the fine for starters, you know that’s why they called Percy, him with Bill and Charlie are the only viable candidates right now
—For what?
—You don´t have to fake it to make me feel better— she said brusquely, making Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise.
—Milo Darling, how are you?
—You did
—Can´t he help you stay in Norway then? — Sirius was years from taking over the family, but surely as the heir he could exert some influence.
—…Doesn’t matter — he shook his head trying to end the conversation —. Let´s just finish the exercises
—I would feel so lost, all on my own, this baby is very lucky, he will have Milo to teach him—she said sweetly.
Tom took long steps as he walked through the hallways. The maid running beside him barely keeping up.
—There will be no need after all, they are going to put me in an apartment
— I Suppose but…I don’t want him to feel bad if he turns out to be a dog
—But…?
—But mister Black is leaving this semester
—It gets old after the first few weeks — another voice said.
—Everything alright? — Tom said as a greeting, confidently approaching and sitting as head of the table.
—What do you want... for you to feel motivation? —
—You need to google what ghosting means—she said playing with at strand of here own hair—. Oh I know! What if we make a group chat? Now that your friend is here, wouldn’t that be amazing? Hermione you can join, human girls have to stick together, right? — she said all very quickly and smiling, like it was a done deal
—Is he mad? I mean…I don´t know the details but he has some responsibility in you leaving, right ? You shouldn’t have to walk on eggshell — Draco asked frowning.
Just then he saw that from behind the group how Draco appeared back in the classroom door, Regulus by his side. Draco was waving his cellphone, letting him know he had gotten the message.
—Of course not, that fucking asshole, can you believe him? Neville just lost the last member of his family and he think he has the right to complain
—Well let me know when you are going to actually show and I might pick you up at the airport
—The twins messed up and got expelled— Ron laughed when saying but it was in a sad tired manner— I mean… it was always going to happen, not this necessarily but something with them, still…there are damages to pay for, we had to go to court…Ginny didn´t want to come today, there’s other things going on, is…whatever
—I think parenthood is an assignment, in the practical sense
Harry was a little taken aback by the question, fortunately Frank chose that moment to show up.
—Yeah, a nearby school had some sort of scandal last year and a lot of students transferred here, it was a huge deal, there were not that used to beasts and some of them are kind of nasty
—Are you sure you are not just being prejudice?
—It hasn’t been announced but is going to be Sirius for sure
Harry turned around, surprised at hearing an unknown someone butting into their conversation. A boy standing behind them extended his hand and Harry tried to cover how weird out he was.
—Sorry, is just…I never met — He looked really confused —. I….
—Is a little different now — Regulus started carefully.
—Yeah whatever— Draco said before remembering something —. So…Were you like…being secretive about him? you didn´t mention a friend of yours was coming
—Is the trip going to be pushed back?
—How…Like…depression?
Draco rolled his eyes
—I want to be here when Morfin is born—he tried instead—.
—Why is that good? — he had never heard that before, quite the opposite in fact.
—omg, right? — The girl Ron had introduced as Lavender, his girlfriend, said excitedly —. Is like I can´t get him to keep up, and he hasn’t updated his Instagram in weeks, like he´s been ghosting me all summer and I couldn’t even see what he was doing online
—Are we being too loud?
Draco entered the house, making his way to the living room, meanwhile talking on the phone distractedly.
—Yeah uhmm…— he vaguely pointed to the window and Madame Malkin understood immediately.
Harry tried his hardest to stop bouncing his legs while the noise of the pyramid clock on Professor Snape´s  desk kept ticking. He looked around trying to distract himself as Snape kept reviewing his last test, but the dark walls and sober decoration did nothing to soothe his mind.
—Yessss— Regulus said smiling to himself —. And now if she has question, I just can´t answer the phone because I’m at school — he announced.
She started taking him away and in direction to the party. Draco truned his head and saw that Sirius stayed there, not even bothering to pretend to play along.
—Let me take a guess — Tom continued, ignoring her—. Given the information that you have from what I have told you, you think I resent my son in some way
—Man thats rough…— the support words were so uninspired that it made Harry scoff.
He kept telling to himself
—…you add the opposite of the number in both sides, the result is like passing it from one side to the other, because here is cero but over here, hey! —Harry was hit with a pen on the head —. Are you paying attention?
He heard his uncle walking away and then came the hushed voice, the ones that he was only able to hear ever so slightly because of his beast side.
Harry smiled at the idea.
—I mean, he is not a prisoner, he is allowed sleep overs
—Great question— the mans looked delighted —. So during the late 1800s there was an explosion in beast population, many of the most well know covens today were formed during this period, like the Norwegian snakes for example. But as you can expects conflict also became more common inside clans. From… I would say 1930 and 1950 we had a reactive retraction, many families choosing to solve the issue of inheritance with limiting to only one child, and this is how over time beast genes became rarer and more associated with an elite
—There is no Morfin… Harr-…Milo… he didn’t make it
Ron just took his cell back as if nothing and clicked on send
—Draco — he corrected —. Get used to it Scarface — he said before leaving.
—Sure…When do you think will be a good time? — Tom tried, a little playfully. Harry did not respond.
—Is a thing
—Viktor Krum — Draco answered, and he was about to explain some more when comment from Neville stopped him.
Ron walked off and Harry saw how Lavender grabbed his arms immediately. Distracted as he was it took him a minute to realized he hadn’t even asked for his number
—oh! You are only half, that’s good — she said taking more notes.
—Hmmm no…I left with Bellatrix —there was not response for a while.
—Hmmm…— Draco and Harry exchanged looks
wanted her to take you as a son, and
Tom took a deep breath and looked around. Gone were the toys and crib, the evidence that there was ever going to be another child had been erased.
—Oh you teenage boys, always with such proficient verbalism — she joked lightly.
—And he was still born outside of marriage — Bella added.
won´t oppose my family and besides, I do want to go home, is just that It can´t be on their terms
—But you wear glasses — Lavender said, looking really confused.
Thank you so much for the comments and support, today we celebrate the first 100 kudos of this fic n.n, im really happy
—I’m sorry, is just…I haven’t really done much— that was  a nice way of putting it.
She hanged up and noticed a pretty enveloped with green letters among usual plain ones.
—Do not call Blaise! — he pleaded before the off tune came on.
—Is it really? Because if not we will have to look for a school to take you at the last minute— his aunt pressed him —. Lucky for us we still have custody, he never took us to court for it
—I’m not having this conversation right now.
—No, he is highly enjoying this, he tells me everything that’s happening at home, he even sent me an audio of my mother losing it last week
Bellatrix blinked and looked confused, she then straightened up changing her previous calm demeanor drastically.
—Is this what puberty is like? Who do you hire for it?— Tom said finally, turning to his assistant.
—Has anyone but you noticed?
Was the first thing Ron heard.
—Ignore them — Tom told him in a way that seemed light, but Harry knew it was the end of that conversation—. Eat the meat at least, the doctor said it would help.
—Yes, on when to have dinner or…go to school…
—how gallant of you, Will Blaise come too?
—You are not answering the question
—Well then, take this as an opportunity to know each other better, It could do no harm, you ought to be family after all—Harry pressed his lips in a line. Right…Tom was getting married soon.
—I can manage
— You know — she started, suddenly angry—. I never wanted it to be a competition between us.
Draco was not sure if this was a win for him, nothing guaranteed that his father would not start pressuring him again later, but he didn’t want to push it, so he just slowly nodded , agreeing.
—I’m so sorry my lord, we thought master Sirius would have called you— she began explaining in a hurry—. We were not expecting them so early and you said to never call the mistress…
—Well it makes sense, I mean they are still very young but it is the best prospect on both sides, there aren’t any female snakes in their generation
—That’s enough — Tom ordered harshly.
—I thought…aren’t´ minors records confidential, why would you need to make it disappear?
—Oh I wouldn’t go that far — he smiled.
—I don´t want him telling Duddley abut those freakish beast things!
He leaned back into his chair taking a deep breath and wondered if he was being manipulated, dogs were good at that, the were emphatic and as such able to fake emotions very well.
Harry hoped his face wasn’t showing much, but he could feel his eyebrows got up at the way Bellatrix had said “big brother” as if it was a huge task just to get the words out of her mouth.
Narcissa Hummed noncommittedly and kept her opinion on the matter to herself. Being an alpha these days was rather overrated. In the past there were assumptions that alpha children inherited more power from their beast presentation, it had proven to be false back in the 90´s, still there was a lot of pride linked to having an alpha, sadly Lucius was among the people that wanted to feel that kind of pride.
—Is it? — he asked petulantly.
Harry let himself be squeezed tight by Ron.
Ron thought about it for a second.
—Not much, not really, for me…it used to be really easy... at my old school i mean
Harry thought about it, his eyes becoming lost in the memories.
—What? — he feigned innocence.
—So what did aunt Bella said to you exactly? — Draco asked turning to Milo.
—I’m making conversation
— She rolled her eyes at him for that but smiled—. …I´m Harry by the way— he quickly shook his head at realizing what he said —. I mean, Milo, I’m Milo
—Get in — Bellatrix urged.
—What is an omega?— he asked confused.
—No, he is here freaking out, Blaise and Neville are with him, and they are acting really weird, I didn’t know what to do
At that Bellatrix stopped playing with the napkin and froze for a second before continuing.
He shook his head, understanding her implication.
—I didn´t, it just became that way, your father gives so little that the people around him end up fighting for the scraps.
His family was already struggling with the expenses of the process alone and would for sure not be able to pay if they lost in court, which was sure to happen with how things were going. The only logical result was them going to another family for help.
—It doesn’t take much effort, we are just naturally averse to each other
—I read that the modern methods of birth control come from a beast invention, if having heirs was such an issue why was this a worry for them? Even before it was for the rest of society?
—I’ve been there
Tom wished he could have been there when they found out he had a son, but a formal letter with the announcement was suggested to be more tasteful for such an occasion. Only 5 snakes families in Norway had snake children right at this moments, and for three of them the mothers died in childbirth. So for most of that infertile community he had proved himself superior, and they wanted him to be put on his place.
—Do you really want me to explain the meaning of nepotism to you?
Their relationship was not exactly bad, but it had never been good either and it had definitely tilted to the wrong side during her pregnancy. Even when the doctors had said it was a side effect of her instincts, after speaking with Draco, he could not stop noticing the many small things she did to inconvenience him. He wondered if her insistence abut them not going on this trip had anything to do with that.
—Yes, that of course, but… he is an omega, and He is Milo´s age,  very promising, right?— she said Brightly.
—Why aren´t there more snakes?
—Look man, I may break up with her, I don´t know
— Longbottoms are only turtles but I think better and English reptile than a Norwegian one— Sirius supplied.
—I´m sorry
—Don´t you tell me to calm down! — his mother enraged voice yelled—. Is not your place to tell
That last morning, the day he left, he got out of the Dursley´s house with the intention to just go across the street, there the elderly would be waiting for him, he just had to walk up to her door and knock, easy right?
—Yes, I’m already set, rich future boyfriend selected, I was just being considerate of the wording for you
—Oh…that — Lucius said, seemingly having forgot about it—.Well… the least he can do if you ask me, even a Weasley can get passable grades if that’s the case…in anyway, don´t get too involved in all that drama
—Maybe… once she is more stable honey
On that state of mind, he packed his bag to go stay with a neighbor, Arabella Figg, who would take care of him during his relative vacation abroad.
—Ahhh…—Ron sighed —. Got to go mate, how are you getting home?
—How can you say that when you know what I went through? I was sick, my instincts were out of control
—I Know, I wish I was like you, with not expectations on me at all—
Harry raised his eyebrows and blinked a few times, trying to understand if he had just been insulted.
The world of this fics is inspired by the manga sex pistols. It is not a retelling of the manga story, is an AU created based on the animal society that exist on it, using the elements on Harry Potter, and as such you don´t need any previous knowledge of the manga to enjoy ( i recommend it though :))
—There is a lot of new faces…humans
—I yeah you’re aright, I see it, you are so much shorter — Draco moved his hand between their heads, comparing heights.
—I don't want you talking to her
—. You are upset — Harry looked at Bellatrix for a second, wondered how she could ask such a thing after what she just told him.
—Yeah?
—I …don´t know why i left — he said finally. And turned to look away once more.
—Me too, that’s why I told her I was dating, I didn´t know she would get so weird about it, she is not even here half the time, but now she suddenly cares…—he finished sarcastically.
—Kid, don’t move— he said putting a hand on his chest, keeping him on the ground.
—Fine, but he better be chill
Tom rolled his eyes in annoyance, good thing Karkaroff couldn´t see him. He had been expecting this to be an issue, he had warned the Blacks, but they were being stubborn and he didn´t have much pull with the family anymore, not with everyone suspecting he would be divorcing Bellatrix.
—You are making that up— he finally decided, standing up.
Harry kept his eyes forward, the presence of his sire calming him instinctively, and he was surprised to realized his beast side had been on high alert, as if in danger.
Those had been the goods times. Harry would have been content with his life staying like that forever, he wished he´d never gone to London.
They started walking off but Draco stopped at the door and gives him a strange face before closing it.
He quickly changed the chat from Hermione to Tom.
He looked around Hogwarts´s entrance and saw how most students were already leaving the school grounds, it was 30 minutes pass two and Tom should be here.
—Mom — he ran to hug her.
—He transferred from Durmstrang, he is a bit grumpy though—Lavender said pouting— He only talks to his friend ammm… Regular?
Hermione turned her head to look at them with a helpless expression before being dragged away, they started moving to follow.
Draco considered the idea, he knew the Gaunts had some king of agreement win Norway, given that so few snakes were left they wanted to stick together.
Hermione raised her hand.
—You are so absurd— he heard him sigh through the phone
—Yes, that of course, but… he is an omega, and He is Milo´s age,  very promising, right?—Harry frowned at that and turn to look at Tom intrigued, hadn’t he told her?
—Someone will have to get mated — Ginny said somber.
—Is fine, we´ll keep it quiet
—Fuck…—he muttered realizing.
—Fine, don´t, if you are that much of a coward to do it —she taunted.
—And are the connections broken because of that? — he tried.
—That is absurd
was the one pushing about them going to Norway.
—Always— Blaize and Pansy answered at the same time.
—Clam down —he told himself when he realized his heart was beating like crazy—. He didn’t hit me, he hasn’t hit me in years
—I did, how embarrassing is that? Blaise was beyond upset, I’m actually leaving the country just to avoid the whole affair— she joked.
—He wants to talk to you— Harry hesitated a little but took it.
Harry wasn’t hungry, being used to work a “night shift” in Glasgow, but not wanting to be difficult he got up to go with her.
—Tell them not to bother — Blaize threw himself on the bed beside Draco.
—How old are you? —
Ron showed him his phonescreen
—The maids were quite baffled, they could not understand why you locked yourself here
—You know I’m not the type to bark
—No…of course not — Lavender said blinking a lot, somehow Harry thought she was exactly that type of girl—. Hermione tomorrow — she announced taking her by the arm—. I´ll make sure to introduce you to the girls —Lavender started pulling her forward.
—Audrina—she greeted —. I hope I’m not catching you at a bad time, I know your leaving the country again
—Doctor? — Bellatrix asked.
—And she…recovered? — he asked
Harry frowned and looked up to find his eyes, but Victor wasn’t looking at him, he was looking at their hand, his posture stiff. He was about to ask if anything was wrong when he caught Victor taking a deep breath, his nose moving.
Gosh, what had he walked into.
—What are you talking about?
Silence, death silence for what felt like a minute. He could almost imagine Tom going still on the other side of the phone call.
Regulus and Draco exchanged looks.
—I Dare you to kiss Milo— Pansy said annoyingly.
—Milo don´t be difficult
—She didn’t kidnap me — Harry tried to appease, finding the wording much too severe for what happened.
—Yes Miss Granger?
—The paperwork is in order and record shows you were even enrolled in a school while living with them in London for a while, is that right? — The woman looked at him expectantly
Harry had almost forgotten he was even there.
Submerged Deep into his mind he couldn’t hear the steps approaching him. It wasn’t until a pair shoes where in his line of sight that he looked up to find Sirius in front of him.
—God, I hate him, I can´t believe Tom is marrying his aunt
—It makes us uneasy you see…hiding your son from us and then—
—You are very special —Tom said one day, while they were out having ice cream.
— there, happy
—Oh…! Of course, the Lord— she laughed—. He will be down soon; he usually just has coffee but now that there is you — she said before walking out.
—Stress? — he frowned finding that word a bit dramatic for a teenager.
—Isn’t he amazing?
—Are you texting her the news? — Draco asked half laughing to Regulus, ignoring Milo´s weak defense.
—Allowed? — Lavender asked laughing, finding the idea absurd— What are you talking about?
—A little, not much
—Is Milo —he corrected extending his hand to Victor— Regulus just keeps forgetting — he added throwing his cousin a pressing look.
—Oh! That sounds nice, much better than Norway if you ask me — Harry felt too embarrassed to correct her, to tell her that he meant he wasn’t going, just his relative were.
He took his phone to call him and saw he had a message from Hermione.
—Fuck, you scared me — He went to get the control remote and turned off the TV. The guy, Remus, was a recent client of them, Harry had seen him a few times at the club before and was surprised to hear this chill bloke wanted to make a big purchase.
—Does you father know you go around telling people your peasant’s name —
—Excuse you?  — Draco asked, clearly offended.
—Hmm…apparently, we can´t got to Norway— Tom laughed, probably thinking it was a joke. When Harry didn’t answer Tom looked at him again, questioning.
—Blaise— Pansy crossed her arms —. Do you feel that now because you have a boyfriend you can judge the single and independent?
When Narcissa reached the room she had to stop by the door with the maids, who were observing, unable to approach. They as humans could not understand what they were seeing, on their eyes it was only two kids consoling another. To Narcissa the manner of how they were going about it said everything. Almost silent, sticking close to each other, eyes flashing intermittently…these kids were omegas on distress…
—I didn’t know — Ron shrugged —. Must be new
Harry, a small figure sitting on his aunt´s couch felt like in a trial, with a group of adult men asking him question after question, like on the tv shows aunt Petunia liked to watch.
—Ronny! — Lavender startled  them both.
—Why are there conditions? —Harry started again—.The woman from social services said it was better for me to come here
—That Morfin uncle went mad though…— Draco didn´t seemed ill intended when he said it and Harry tried to think if he had ever heard something about that but Tom very rarely spoke about his family, it was sort of a sensitive subject.
To everybody else this event wouldn’t seem strange at all, but to her, knowing what she did it, was beyond bizarre, what was Tom´s move in playing along with the Notts? Milo and Neville as a match were not exactly unviable but it was not a smart move to pair the only two reptile omegas together.
—What is that smell? — Draco said, wrinkling his nose as they looked around the room.
—Surprisingly I agree, this is less than ideal, I would have prepared you with tutors for a few months and enrolled you on the second semester
—I don’t know, maybe is just me—he said shaking his head—.  Anyway be careful with what you say in front of Victor
—we always had humans at Hogwarts
After the death of his Grandmother the Nott family had taken Neville under their wing a few months ago, and apparently a lot of pressure had been put into Theo to look after him. He had finally exploded yelling at Neville on how he was such a helpless omega weakling that could not even take care of himself.
Harry laughed and was about to respond when a car stopped in front of him, he recognized it immediately as one of Tom´s sport cars but when he looked up it wasn’t him behind the wheel. There on the driver seat was Bellatrix.
—So you think Is about Neville?
—How I’m a being difficult? I do everything you say all the time and I just get punished for it — he realized he was raising his voice, but he didn’t care
—I´ll pay for it, I’ll get money once I’m eighteen
—Of course not, they are taking you as a six grader—Tom dismissed—. Is that all?
—Well yeah that was my defence, apparently is not enough
—No, you are different, like me— he said smiling.
Draco gave him a bored look but straightened up. It was true, the venue was full of his guests, family, friends, classmates…and he just didn’t care. But he wasn’t going to cross the line into pathetic by voicing that out.
There was an awkward pause as she looked them over.
—What are you two weirdos doing in the kitchen? — was his way of greeting.
—I’m sorry honey, is that one of your friends? — the woman inquired him sweetly. Harry was so dumfounded by the question that he was not able to answer right away.
—That is just a fancy name, it doesn’t mean anything
She took a deep breath and decided, the Zabinis were her best choice. As their sons had been best friends since they were little he had a good relationship with Audrina and Blaize was close with Neville so they were surely invited.
—Not at all — Regulus answered nonchalantly —. Nothing is ever enough to Walburga Black, so I shall oppose her with everything I have.
help with this Milo, sadly for men, and I’m sure you will experience this someday, the baby does not matter until is here, until they are able to see it, before then it seems is like an abstract concept and his needs are of non-importance
—My father is picking me up
—…Sometimes I still forget…— there was a little silence —.What else has changed? your height? have you grown?
—I’m sixteen
Regulus ran off quickly, leaving them by themselves, and when Harry turned to Draco he was filled with a sudden sense of awkwardness, not knowing what to say at having already exhausted the topic of conversation.
—I will be here, Norway is just a 2 hour flight away
—Harry…— the voice sounded worried
Harry felt a sudden wave of irritation at the petulant tone.
Bellatrix looked at him without saying anything for a long time before speaking again.
They talked for a little while before hanging up, and Harry was left considering the idea of staying somewhere else. Truth to be told, he would rather stay with Ron …but he knew the Weasleys were going through a rough patch… financially…and for a while now…he didn’t want to cause any problems.
He turned the phone around on his hands, thinking of what to do. He really didn’t want to speak to Tom so soon, and he had been making a statement on their last interactions, no answering his calls and only responding in short sentences to his questions via text. Tom had called this behavior a tantrum but Harry hope to get his point across, he was beyond upset at the current situation.
—You little asshole, didn´t even sent a message— Ron said letting him go.
—You can be at ease —he answered evasively. Something was definitely going on, it just wasn’t any of Karkaroff business.
—You two know each other? — Zacharias asked.
—Beatings — he muttered no looking at her, no willing to say more about it.
It was strange, hearing Tom speak for the first time in almost two years, he didn’t know what to say.
—There must be something that will make you feel more centered, you were doing well before all this mess
He threw his head back a little, having a physical reaction at hearing the question. It sounded so awkward and forced coming from her. Even when they lived together, she hadn’t asked about his day even once.
—They say plenty, although I don’t always understand, like…just the other day they were talking about the Black´s inheritance.
Blaize, that was standing a little ahead of them, turned at that.
—Is only for a few weeks — he muttered.
—How was the first day of school? Did you see your friends? …that Weasley boy— she asked instead of answering his question.
Harry blinked realizing he must have been silent for too long.
—Thank you —When she left Harry turned back quick enough to catch Draco rolling his eyes
—Oh…—
Regulus started chuckling at that.
The girl turned to him.
—What?
—Indefinitely would be ideal, That’s the thing, since the baby is an hybrid between species we can´t be sure about the due date, and the chances of him being premature are very high, it would bring me so much peace if you were in England during that time, It would be awful for you to be overseas when the baby comes
Draco nodded.
—What would you have me do uh? When Karkaroff calls me to ask me things…you know he is going to ask
Tom stepped into the room and knocked twice on the door frame to make his presence known.
—Yes…I thought a lot about what you told me, about me focusing on my grades— he tried.
—Yes, he just woke up—Harry couldn’t hear the other side of the conversation but he didn’t have to wonder long before Sirius handed him the phone.
—I’ve made my piece with it
—Why is that? — Draco snorted —. Did you make up a different persona there in Norway?
—…Sorry, I have to go back to study
—What did you do? — Were her first words. A if he was at fault of something terrible, just by subjecting them to his early presence.
—Jesus Pansy, I think you are drunk already— Blaise decided to interrupt coming into the room. He walked until he was besides him and Ron-
—Oh…— Lavender looked strangely disappointed— Do you…have a boyfriend?
—ahhh…Almost, my…dad is outside—he explained and could tell she was disappointed somehow at his response —. But he is you know…compensating, taking me places and all —he added lamely.
Harry wanted to continue to be angry, but the mood on the table felt somber and Bellatrix looked smaller somehow, the energy sucked out of her body.
Harry knocked on the door twice before entering as he was used to. There in the middle of the office, Tom was seating behind his desk signing documents, an assistant standing at his side.
And he really was, so embarrassingly naive, trying to fit, make it better, when he had just been the bastard son in a close to dickens book situation.
—I´m practical, and you are dreaming if you think your parents won´t have complains on your girlfriends, only child, is going to be brutal. And by the way — she said turning to Blaize once more—. I thought your mother let you do whatever you wanted
Harry perked up at that.
—Everyone has been giving me shit about it —
—Why are you defending her? — Draco seemed genuinely surprised.
Finally he just couldn’t take it anymore.
—Draco! I didn’t have my phone ready — He heard Pansy complaining—. Go again
Draco stretched his neck to look.
—Weren’t you like…in love ?— Draco tried.
He had numbly explained the situation. That there was an accident, that his stepmother was having a baby and it was considered a high-risk pregnancy, that she had just been hospitalized would have to stay there until his brother was born.
—The professors said I needed to study
—Way to make an impression — Regulus muttered deadpan —. Victor don´t be weird, I’m trying to get you invited to parties here — he said getting in between, making them let go of the hold of their hands.
—Every time —she said signing but still wearing a smile —. Tell you what, why don´t you take a look at the scarves while we wait for your father to finish his call
—I think I would have liked a little brother—Neville commented. Crouching down to touch some of the baby´s toys.
—Well, beasts are very clan based, so is common for the judges to incline on placing beast kids with their kin, but if you are half…there could be a case to be made…if we need to…but so far … it seems you have family out there looking for you — The social worker said encouraging.
—Is better than last time —he offered lamely, and Snape finally put the test down to look at him.
Harry rolled his eyes and made a show of hanging his head in a bored gesture.
—Zacharias Smith — he introduced himself.
—Ok guys, the assembly is about to start so I will have to cut the live here, bye — she hurriedly ended the transmission and sent Blaize a death glare.
—Sudden interest? What do you mean, they invited me, and I go there all the time, you are always pushing me to be friends with Draco, because you don´t like Ron and-
There was some door slamming and then the only thing he could hear were muffled voices. He closed the entrance door and stood there trying to see if he could listen more, worried.
Harry noticed Ron making a weird thing with his nose, scrunching it slightly, as if annoyed.
—And what is that going to accomplish?
Regulus thought about it
—When are you coming back? —
After that they had taken his blood and made him spit in a tube. His aunt had given them farewell happily and Harry had been surprise at her good disposition at having stranger in their house but after a few days all had gone back to normal as if nothing, the incident no more than a coma in their life. Harry had even began to wonder if he had imagined it all and just when he was deciding to forget they brought Tom.
—I'm trying to postpone it until last minute— Regulus signed tiredly.
—Yes, your father didn’t want you around that, her instincts are making her a bit aggressive right now, I don’t even let my Draco visit her
Harry frowned at the question and noticed how Zacharias eyes fell to his backpack, it was a ratty old thing he had brought with him from Glasgow. He knew the appearance of the thing was less than acceptable, as Tom had also taken his sweet time eyeing it the day before, but even he, as snobbish as he was, hadn’t shown this much contempt about it.
—How so?— he asked, already annoyed with him —. It was the name of Tom´s uncle, and like that we would both have names with M, Bellatrix would like for it to be a tradition
—…Can i…can I talk to Morfin?
Draco and Regulus, from a third-floor window of the school building, could see Harry with a group of people
He even feared Tom might just refused him just to teach him a lesson, but he was willing to try, everything to get out of this hell hole.
—Well, she is crazy — he said as if conceding the point.
—Well, I know, that is why is such a pity — Bellatrix answered nonchalantly.
—Sixth, and you?
—That has an expiration date, how long until they notice? and I still need to pay for university Regulus
—She is just having I hard time adapting, the doctor said dogs can get very territorial
—Oh…—He said already dreading the upcoming conversation.
—Over there, with his friend — he added.
Harry started picking up his things so he could leave the class, keeping his eyes on Draco. He had been wondering about Bellatrix after yesterday´s shit show and Tom´s answers when questioned had proven most unsatisfactory. It hadn’t taken much thought to know he had to ask the eavesdropping cousin of the family.
—I’m sure you can, you’ve been doing it by yourself, still, Do not let it get too bad
—First snake in a long time
He opened his mouth ready to give a piece of his mind when he felt someone coming at him from the side. He instinctively started to raise his arm to stop them, but he was quick enough to realize it was just Lavender.
—Humans… Everything is so basic for you, you have no instincts
Harry rolled his eyes Ron gave him a pressing look.
They really wanted to make an example out of them this time, being from an elite, beast…no matter if they weren’t really wealthy or elite at all, the beast part couldn’t be denied, and nothing was satisfying the court. The twins were already doing community service on top of everything and now the civil lawsuit…it was just out of control.
—Really? ... I haven’t noticed
Remus suddenly straightened his stance.
—Hermione— she said simply, waving her hand lightly but keeping her distance.
—You are a member of the Gaunt family, you had to be named accordingly, do you know just how fortunate you are?
Harry was about to respond when Regulus returned dragging another boy behind him.
Bellatrix took a deep breath.
—Where is Tom? —
—did he know why I was absent?
—Ceremony? — a voice said through Draco´s phone, he had been talking for half an hour already.
—Unrested, like with an uncompleted assignment
—Yeah…Neville stays at Blaise´s every other night, just so that he doesn’t have to be in that house —
—oh Fuck off — Ron pushed him jokingly and they both started laughing.
He took the keys out of his pocket and as he was opening the door the twins’ voices reached his ears.
—Well you haven’t changed — he said sarcastically.
—Do you have the drugs?— Remus said
—You weren’t listening to anything I said? — he tried to come up with something but decided to just give and admitted. He shook his head as an answer and Draco threw the pen on the table.
—Maybe the Notts will have another son…—Draco offered half-heartedly.
—Sirius? — he said starting to smile.
—Is Miss Bella, she has a headache
—Please…— Draco scoffed—. Your grades are fine, but they aren’t fucking satisfied, are they? they never are and— He cut himself and harry turned around to see he was looking at one of the maids standing by the door, she seemed troubled.
—Would you just stop, they wanted you here a year ago, don´t you think is enough? —
—Well you know, when they first found you— she waved the words away—. So I was thinking maybe you could go on Christmas, after the baby is born, visit Regulus maybe—Bellatrix kept on talking but Harry could not hear it.
It hadn’t been exactly like that but Tom had been very clear that he should not find himself alone with her.
— Yes…
Pansy held her phone up to take a picture of him when someone buried their elbow on her ribs.
—I don´t want you speaking to the Malfoys right now
—Is only until you can regulate your own temperature, reptiles are…— Tom started to explain, but Harry had heard this a thousand times before.
It was never openly stated, but everyone knew. The way the Notts tried to push those two kids together was ungallant.
—….Does he…does he not know about me? You haven’t told him? — he raised his head to see Sirius looking at him, no more pretense of privacy.
Sirius grabbed his arm stopping him.
—Which part? I might get confused and do plenty
—There I sent it — he said putting the cell on is ear again—. So what´s this about? I thought you guys were separated.
—Milo…—he started exasperated —. Having one son is a lot of work and you are making it worst by the minute subjecting me to his conversation… I thought I wasn’t capable of having children so you will have to excuse me if I do not have this baby yet in my calendar, surely it can wait for his time until he is born
—is all new staff — he explained shortly, omitting how Bellatrix had fired everyone after Morfin´s passing.
—I just meant for you to give your best effort — his father interrupted him before he could finish.
—Hello? — he said picking up
—Doesn’t seem like it
—Is your party—
—That is just dumb
Draco looked at him intently before giving in.
—How would I know? I assumed so, anyway it doesn’t really matter, you missed the last two weeks of school, we never do anything on those, Snape is the only one who likes to torture us until the end
of September so…
—Is it still undecided?
—That Morfin´s death hadn’t been an accident — He said, just skipping the weirdness of it all and going for what had shocked him the most.
—An Uncle —she looked at him for confirmation while taking notes —… are your other relatives aware of this uncle? Was there any type of abuse?
—…Bella said you didn’t want to meet me, even when they told you
—You guys seemed ok — he said unsure, because what did he know what ok look like really?
Tom clicked his tongue annoyed
—You lost your own battles already, so what is it that you want, hmm?— he nuzzled her cheek, keeping the pretense of affection —.  To conquer where you don´t belong? — he asked finding her eyes —. Don´t think for a second that I will let you
—No need to make a scene, we were just having coffee
—Milo, You will not go and that is final — in a fit of rage he hanged up.
There was a little silence between them before Tom decided to speak again.
—He is just a friend— she answered one of the questions—. You know how i´m, my favorite person is myself
—hmmm…I shall consider it— he gestures Harry to leave —. I´ll speak to you later
His usual self would be able to give better answers, maybe try and think of a way to get out of this mess, but he could recognized that it was over,  and maybe it was right about time, he was too tired to keep fighting…and honestly at the moment, a tiny bit sedated.
—Beyond what’s normal? I mean…they are under the Norwegian coven
His mother had told him of this idea, threatening to quit playing futbol and how it supposedly would scare his father enough to cut him some slack, he didn’t know she would run with it though.
—You are too young to go to prison
—No last names? — the boy… Zacharias, asked.
"Well," his friend takes off her glasses and puts her own paperwork aside. "You should've thought about that before getting yourself almost killed."
I'm not sure what this is but it was in my head and now is here (:
“Okay. Then I suggest you stop wasting time and start
He looks to the right and sees Malfoy with Astoria, he's surprised to see her after everything he's heard. She does look a little bit too thin and a little bit too pale, and it makes Harry's heart clench. Malfoy is holding her close as she waves their son goodbye. He looks down at her and kisses the top of her head.
"Harry, dear!" Molly is coming to greet them and ushers them towards the dining table. "Come, come. The table's already set, we were waiting for you both to get here so we could start…" She looks back to give Ginny evil eyes. "I did say to be here at eleven, didn't I?"
“I can’t.”
Harry chuckles. He
"I thought I'd enjoyed the quiet, you know? I was kind of looking forward to getting a break from all the screaming and whatnot. But then I just… don't."
"I should be, too."
"Fuck this," he murmurs closing his eyes, holding his head in his hands. "Why
"Why can't you be like this?"
As soon as Harry sets foot in the Burrow he's hit all together with the sound of children playing and the smell of delicious food cooking. He closes his eyes and takes a minute to take it all in. He feels Ginny stepping out behind him and almost knocking him to the floor.
He feels shuffling in the room and looks to his left to see Ginny walking towards the sit-down vanity. She’s dragging her feet again. Harry is almost getting used to seeing bags under her eyes.
The thing is, he
crying?"
sure of this- be asking personal questions and brushing his tears away.
Even if Harry was never a fan of Malfoy, he feels kind of sad for him. He takes a look around the table and, not for the first that day, feels extremely grateful for every single person in the room.
“Yes, you can.” Malfoy does sound pretty sure of himself, Harry thinks. “Harry, this is a dream. The laws of physics do not apply here. You can go through things, you can fly without a broom. You could even be someone else if you focused hard enough.”
Pansy started laughing.
—We are in a car
—Except the girls — Hermione pushed.
He saw that Bellatrix was making her way back and felt a sudden wave of malice. On a whim he hanged up, silenced the phone calmly and put it on the table, when the screen lighted up again showing Tom´s was calling he just turned it over, face down.
—Is beautiful —Neville added.
There it was, the snake incident.
Among the Black cousins, besides Draco´s mother who was a veela, and consequently not considered, there were four manifested dogs, three of them alphas, and Bellatrix which was a Beta. This gave the elders plenty of options for their choice of heir, it was honestly brutal.
—I’m sure it was, for a Burmese phyton too — one man said, his tone was very calm and harry felt like he understood.
Tom didn’t let himself be fooled by the display of emotion. He took a step closer and softly caressed her on the cheek, leaning in, until they were almost touching then whispered in her ear.
—You know that is not true
—So…You were saying, is interesting then?
—Hmmm— she pursed her lips, somehow disappointed, at what? he didn’t know.
is failing
—So what? we just go ahead and give them it before they ask? — he complained.
—Ahhhh— he let out, looking at Ron, asking for his help—. I think I’m alright
—You don´t really want to know
—He carries the Gaunt name, I don´t think his legitimacy is in question— she dismissed lightly.
Narcissa narrowed her eyes at her, but said nothing more.
—My parents talk a lot when they think I’m not listening…— Draco said shrugging.
Neville shrugged but his cheeks turned red. The other three shared a look at this and tried to hide their laughter, Neville was so reserved that it was amusing to see him showing that much emotion, the urge to tease him was strong.
In the past he was always forgiving on Bellatrix, telling himself he was looking too much into things, being sensitive…he was glad at being able to meet her again, older and smarter even if just to prove to himself he had not imagined it all.
—How probable you think…?— he let the question in the air
—As opposite to…?
—She said it was boring and people didn’t talk to her there...
Duddley, who up until that point had been happy just eating, looked up at that.
Back when he was younger he didn’t quite understand who Tom was, didn’t thought much about it really, he was just a guy who visited him form time to time, brought presents, took him out on trips…it took him a while to understand, that this man was his father, and it was crazy to think now, that he as happier before knowing.
Draco took the phone off his ear for a second.
They all turned to see who it was, there on the next road of students was Neville. He smiled and pointed forward.
—Why? Does she have something to say to me? — he said, taunting. Bellatrix had said some upsetting things to him in the past…truths. He figured that must be the reason Tom was fussing.
—You like that sort of thing? — he jumped a little on his spot at hearing the voice behind him.
Tom only looked up briefly to acknowledge him.
—And Bellatrix kept the Black name… is just how it is— Harry considered the situation, confused.
—I think a therapist sir
—I’m a snake, sight is not our strongest suit — He said in a good mood. After hiding this for two years while he was away it was nice being able to talk about it—. Also I’m only half, so I don´t get all the perks — he explained.
—Yes, sorry Milo, she insisted I tell you
—Going to Blaize´s, we have to kill a few hours though, he went to lunch with his mom, he said he´d text me when it’s over
—So your mother told me you are thinking of quitting the team…— Draco frowned at that, surprised.
—They don´t to school —Harry said taking a bite of his biscuit —. They like to be free and roam around
—I’m sorry? — he stalled there, confused.
—Pansy don´t be gross, we are about to be cousins— Malfoy said from his spot on the couch.
—Just do as I say ok?
—Milk that, requested breakups should feel like max achievement to them, extreme compromise, set a high price early on—Pansy said in such a professional tone that they couldn’t help but snort in shock—. Believe me, you´ll thank me later
—I’m surprised Tom agrees with it — she commented, deep in thought.
—People don´t care about that as much as you think Bellatrix, or aren’t I also the product of an affair?
—Is that why you opened the cage Harry?
—…Tom told you no? —
Regulus started laughing but then stopped unsure of the answer.
—Burdened? — She said unsure, after a deep breath—. By the responsibility
—uh well…—
—Yeah but…like summer love in love, you know? he had to go back to Germany and I’m sixteen, I’m not having an online relationship
—Yes well, you know I’ve been trying to knock some sense into him for a while, the baby is coming and is important for him to be close to his kin, both his father and his…big brother
—Aren’t I going to prison?— he asked.
—Then what is it?
—Bad time? For you? Never…I am leaving the country though
—Yea…you missed the last test remember—
Harry was ready throw shade back, but his eyes found Victors and the guy was frowning and looking directly at him.
—I was gone for two years…— he left it there, thinking it was reason enough.
—Just listen to what I’m telling you, alright?
—Well of course if you have only one son you would make him your heir, is completely different if you were to have options— Bellatrix refuted stubbornly.
—he has always been a bit morbid
—Can I see it? —Neville asked him. Harry hesitated a little.
—He was, but then he told me to just not listen to her and tried to play it down while at the same time being very drastic about it, like he basically told me to scream for help if I see her again.
—you know, being in a new place with no friends while everyone else knows each other, is stressful
—Is your family alright? I didn’t see any of your siblings here today
—Fine…but you should know, even as a dog she can´t hear this far
—Alright …
Ron haltered for a second taking it in
—…And what is important? Remind me, I mean besides parading me around as a trophy in Norway— Tom gave him a long look, flashing his red eyes. Harry knew he had crossed a line but stood his ground.
They both started walking away from the window.
—Milo?
—I don´t feel like my son is an imposition, I don´t treat him nor think of him as a chore
—No…snakes don´t talk — he repeated quickly, just as his aunt had insisted when he tried to explained what had happened.
—Ok, so let´s not say more about that…are you well, not too cold? —Harry looked at Sirius again, checking.
—Fuck no, she hasn’t been at Grimmauld, I doubt my mom knows even, I bet she is going to flip when she finds out she kidnapped Harry... — he paused for a second thinking —. I’m totally telling her — he said taking his phone out to start typing.
When he got to the tent people sheered. Lucius Malfoy already had a microphone in hand and Draco thought everything was just too much, but as his parents said, It was an important birthday supposedly, deserving of a big celebration. So he put on a smile and tried to feel anything but numb.
—Irrelevant, half the population can die from eating peanuts, you just need a jacket — he said dismissively before inclining and putting his head above his —. You are my perfect son and heir, the last snake, don´t forget that.
—I don´t think you have…ever, you hardly value my opinion enough, and you don´t care about what I think of you, so you wouldn’t have a reason to lie
—We think we found Harry…a teenager his age is in a hospital in Glasgow, he was identified as a snake.They refused to send picture of an underage boy to unrelated people, it didn’t help that Riddle´s doesn’t share his name so, I’m flying there tomorrow to see him myself, bringing the papers and everything.
Harry hastily took his backpack and got out of there.
—Don´t worry, I´ll be fine — he said bracing up.
—You are calling me that now?
—...i don´t know — he looked around frantic and felt it, it was happening again, that thing when he felt cold, so cold, he couldn’t keep warm and then blackness.
—It was such a small space…— the tried
—we should have gotten together before, to get the story straight— Regulus muttered, arms crossed —. I could at least greet him properly… can you believe them? Telling us last minute
—I’d rather not risk it, is says very explicitly why you were arrested, it would be scandalous if it ever came out
—What happened? —Harry asked
—So I need you to tell your father
— Why are we even inviting this guy to hang out then?
—Is Sirius nearby?
—We don’t …— And Harry really wanted to ask more about it but they were startled by Bellatrix coming in.
They both jum startled when a loud voice broke among the rest.
—Don´t you dare point that at me — he refused quickly.
—Didn’t you leave because of him?
Harry tried to think about it but had to agree.
Harry frowned not understanding, what was he sorry for?
—How are you?
—I’m surprised you know that — Blaize said, making a weird face between a smile and a frown.
—Something about me being and omega and having options — Blaize seemed uncomfortable talking about it.
—Is true, she was in an institution for a while.
—No I mean, everyone is different now, older, I don´t know —he said shrugging
And he had thought about it, in fact he was enraged for a whole week after that conversation.
—…I’m just over it…and to be honest I was over it at the end of last year already. We had these problems at home, and she wouldn’t stop bugging me, like, I didn´t have time for her and she got on my nerves
—Good, …is greattt…well, weird though— he admitted.
—Because I was just too young to understand you didn’t give a shit
—Of course is about Neville, I assume they are finally accepting that him and Theo can´t stand each other
—Is not really ghosting if we are hanging out— Ron said scratching his head.
—Weren’t you planning to woo this Blaize you keep talking about?
—Yes, I’m going! — he could feel tears getting on his eyes, he wasn’t sure if there were out of anger or just the stress of having this fight, truth was, he would never get this emotional if they were face to face, but now he could not stop.
—I´ll pay for it, I’ll get money once I’m eighteen
— …Sure
—That’s interesting —
Sirius eyes moved to him.
Harry kept quiet for a moment, fuming, thinking of what to say next, Tom was not listening, at all, so he might as well just ask what had been going through his mind.
Regulus sighed
—Why? What is wrong with it? —Neville asked, taking the newly purchased teddy bear.
—I guess I was lucky that you never realized you were winning, if this is how you behave when you are on top — she said bitterly seeing his reaction.
—Already? —she seemed genuinely surprised at hearing that.
—Who is that girl he is talking to? — Regulus pointed at someone on the crowd.
—Don´t you get tired? antagonizing her all the time
—What?...uh, no no, we are not dating —she clarified quickly
—Oh…for significance? — Neville asked reluctantly and Harry signed
—Nooo — Ron alarmed —. Actually, try to keep it on the low, is more like a small gathering
—Of course, but of a rich prominent one, it makes a difference
—What do you mean?
—You know Milo, is no fun for me either to have to spend the afternoon doing double work because of you
—What word would you use then?
Draco was hiding outside, leaning agaisnt a wall. The big white tent holding the party was shining with life in the distance, but he didn’t want to look at it. So he kept his eyes on the floor, and as the music kept playing, muffling the voices of people cheering, he felt like it was happening to somebody else.
—I´ve seen others, on tv, dogs, lyons, veelas…
—I know, I was just teasing— he said giving him a playful push—. So what are you doing after? I need hiding from my mother
—Let’s go then, wouldn’t want to miss my Father´s speech — he said sarcastically.
He looked around thinking maybe he ought to wait outside after all, this clearly hadn’t been one of his best ideas.
While he was saying this a maid entered the room to leave a basket with bread in front of them. There was an uncomfortable silence while they waited to be left alone again.
Blaise nodded slowly before speaking again.
—Who invited you?
—That’s two years from now and I don´t trust you to not get disowned before that — they both laughed at the idea.
Harry quietly shook his head.
When Harry was first sent back to Surrey his aunt had greeted him brusquely.
—That boy is giving his family lots of trouble — Lucius commented.
—And isn’t that comforting?
—Well, it contradicts everything you told me about your son
—No need for that, I´m not judging, you just don´t seem like the type — Harry shrugged not really in the mood of making conversation, he was nervous as fuck and Frank was running late.
—Ahmm…— Harry hesitated —. I´ll send Frank a text to find out
—It wasn’t …I wasn’t that bad, the tackling,  it was mostly the car involved that…well
Hermione found his eyes again and he saw her smiling mischievously before she spoke again.
The woman looked defeated for a second before continuing.
—Didn’t you resent him? didn’t you ran because you thought you were being casted aside because of him? — Harry tried to think really hard, to look for that feeling, to see if it was there.
Draco laughed.
Harry leaned over the kitchen island while  Ron kept mixing whatever drink he thought he was inventing. Screams could be heard already coming from the living room, as those who had arrived earlier  were already tipsy, and with Blaise’s mom out of town there was nothing to worry about.
—Percy arrived this morning, he says he knows the guy, for sure he works on the Lestrange law firm— she said referring to the new lawyer representing the theater owners.
Draco pursed his lips, troubled, but understanding Regulus stance on the subject. After all, he had to find out he was being transferred back through the principal. And his parents response when asked was, “ you shall continue your education at Hogwarts or not at all”
—You didn’t invite Theo
—I know …—there was a small silence between them —. We´ll figure it out, alright?
—But you already have an idea in your mind, you just don´t want to share it
Harry was still in a bit of a shock when he was forcibly thrown on his room, the door closing with a big slam.
She sighed when the phone biped sending her to voice mail.
—You must be joking — Harry scowled at recognizing what it was. The design of the yearly calendar had changed a little since the last time he was here, but the Hogwarts shield was still big, bright, and obvious.
—Black is your cousin? — Zacharias asked suddenly.
—Wow…I forgot how bad you were…— he said crossing his arms and sighing.
—Which one is it? — she asked laughing
— What? I’m not even allowed to take my stepson out for a treat? — she tried nonchalant.
—Is a species thing? is his smell like offensive? I mean, it would make sense, everything else about him is offensive — Draco joked.
Victor went to take his hand but as they made contact something weird happen. Victor got suddenly tense and squeezed his hand in a strong grip.
—No matter what?...i even thought he was about to leave… like Andromeda
Before he could think Malfoy grabbed him and gave him a quick peck on the lips
—augh! Jesus Draco
—Did you get an invitation to the Notts this weekend?
—Alright…—he snorted at the idea —. Anyway, I’m kind of grounded so I will have to see if I can swing it
