However, all the goodwill he had initially possessed towards Daphne had now evaporated. How could dark hair, no preference for blood status, interest in muggle technology, discerning tastes in clothes, avid interest in learning and a love for slow days equate to Finch-Fletchley? In retrospect, he really should have pursued the reason for Daphne's amusement when she processed his application. Had she been thinking about his compatibility with Finch-Fletchley? It was a wonder how her business could thrive when her comparability spells were so poor.
Draco swiped the shampoo suds from his eyes in frustration. If only he had made a better impression on Potter today. Mind wandering to the memory of Potter's muscular thighs and his still-knobbly knees, Draco felt his consternation fade a little, a soft moan reverberating in the shower chamber as he worked his cock once more, albeit slower this time.
" Hermione commanded, glaring at Harry when he failed to comply. "I am doing this for your sanity, Harry," she said menacingly through clenched teeth.
The combination of Harry's right dimple and earnest hunger for praise made Draco nervous. He wanted to push Harry against the wall and to devour the smile so that it would only be his alone. He wanted to bruise his lips, to cage that innocence for himself. He shrugged brusquely before heading to his collection of colognes.
Draco tried to look as understanding as possible. "Alright, I'll let you both go just this once, okay? If I catch any of you harassing Potter again, I will be deducting house points. Potter has expressly stated his desire to live a normal student life, and the both of you would do well to respect him."
"Maybe you could teach me your detection spells too? Mine aren't as complex as yours," Harry said, looking at Malfoy as he pushed the parchment paper aside.
I appreciate the invitation, but I would like to counter propose a full day of shopping. A whole wardrobe cannot be purchased in a few hours. I am available on Friday if that is amenable. I would prefer to avoid the shopping crowds.
Ron says that he'll eat enough for the both of you tomorrow. As if he's not doing that all the time already.
Harry opened his eyes just a fraction to watch his bickering friends before sneaking the fruit under the table, and into his bag.
“Please what?” Harry asked as he shoved his hand in his briefs. He pushed it under Draco’s balls roughly as he whispered a lubrication charm.
Draco froze, not believing his ears. Composing himself, he turned around to watch Potter running towards him. "Potter," he addressed coolly, hating himself for instinctively lamenting Potter's fresh bun. He preferred it when Potter tucked his loose fringe behind his ear.
“There’s still tests and quizzes,” Draco said, amused by Harry's conversation leap and flimsy logic. “Besides, I’m the smarter one. Hermione’s grades come from hard work.”
Draco checked the mail and sorted them accordingly. Half of the scathing letters went to his bedside table for light reading, while the rest remained on his desk. Then there were the booby traps for careful unwrapping and intellectual stimulation. He marvelled at the remaining three letters that were supposedly polite.
Harry quickly released the spells on the both of them. There were simply some things that they didn't need to hear or see.
"I almost died, if it wasn't for your cousin," the patient said as he pushed his sleeve up to show Teddy the scar for which he had stubbornly declined dittany.
"Thank you Draco. Your first resolution wasn't very realistic, but I acknowledge the effort." Hermione said, her lips threatening to burst into a smile when she finished.
He would have to put up a request to review Mattheo's appointment tomorrow. The thought of the number of committees involved made him sigh. He should drop by Serendipity tomorrow to bribe Kingsley's secretary—
"It's alright. You're a curse breaker now, aren't you?" She asked as she gestured for him to follow her. "Perhaps you could work on improving it during your spare time? Draco tried his best but I'm sure that it's not quite up to your standard."
"Malfoy, you don't want to give us a white Christmas?" He called out from across the room, nearly falling over in laughter when Malfoy only scowled harder at him. He was slightly tipsy already from the alcohol Seamus had purchased from the collected funds, and everything was hilarious to him.
"Do you want to go to bed," he asked as he waited for Draco to work through his confusion. "It's ten past six right now."
"Draco," he whispered as he shook him lightly on his bare shoulder. "Draco," he repeated with more force, smiling nervously when the boy hummed at him with bleary eyes.
Bloody hell, he swore as he quickly sent a golden arrow at Pansy. He had underestimated his friend entirely. To be able to bed two-thirds of the Golden Trio? No wonder she had been preaching for him to do whatever he wanted.
“Finally, I would like to thank you for the participation in our anonymous gift exchange. Today will be our last exchange, but the kindness should not stop here. Do something for a stranger every week, if not every day. Reveals will be conducted over the course of our meal. Please mingle, and make a new friend or two.” She gave a perfunctory nod before returning to her seat while the Hall broke out into applause.
The Blacks probably hadn’t been called upon by the Cupid Branch much, judging from the painting that had been so easily let out from the family. Did it mean that he was marginally better than his ancestors? The bar wasn’t too high though, and dwelling on it was pointless, he decided as he sent out his deliberately vague letters to the branch of Blacks dispersed throughout China, craving for guidance while careful to not reveal too much.
“No, that’s thirty one cakes. You've been obsessed with Draco since you were born,” Greg said as he keyed in the purchase into the register. “But it’s only twenty cakes because I'm giving you a bit of leeway.”
"I'm glad that you're back because I got a present today," Harry said, pleased when his words made Malfoy pause.
Potter blinked at him in shock. "I just realised it yesterday," he said slowly, looking at Draco in complete disbelief.
"—to get a broom for Teddy." Draco blinked as he caught only the end of Potter's speech. He scowled at the man.
"Then it's quite accurate, isn't it? You all were hot headed and arguing all the time in Gryffindor. Plus the whole being brave business. Now that we're here, you're reading about gardening, your knees are dusty from burrowing about, and I'm thinking about stealing food. We couldn't be more Hufflepuff if we tried."
After flying for more than an hour, more interested in goading each other into admitting defeat than Seeking, the confused Snitch had fluttered close by, and had been caught by Draco. It didn't count as a proper win though, he complained throughout their journey to the dorms.
"Does Andromeda report my comings and goings to you?" Draco challenged with an eye roll. "Did she tell you why I'm in Paris?"
"Why don't you tell me since you've already read my letter anyway," Draco replied crossly as he continued to write.
. We're just a bit left out with everyone coupling up. And he's quite tactile, so it seems like something more. But we're only just friends."
Disrupted by an Order fuelled by the righteous fury of a bunch of slighted Gryffindors, the revenge-bent Ministry had folded, and his trial had concluded swiftly by the end of May. Draco had returned alone to a Manor left in shambles by the Dark Lord's henchmen.
Harry stewed in worry while his friends argued amongst themselves. What if Draco didn't want to talk to him after and they couldn't even have these awful squabbles anymore? It was unthinkably depressing.
He was overcome by betrayal when girl Weasley nodded and circled around to take his intended seat. Draco felt his heart squeeze in hurt and muted fury. What had he done wrong? He was simultaneously embarrassed by his concern and furious at being jilted. He stood dumbly, unsure about how he was supposed to address the situation.
"A persisting thirst for knowledge, I see," the Hat suddenly spoke up. "Greatly esoteric, hmm. Teenagers are harder to sort, you see. There's so much flux to work with, so much
"Well, it's the principle of the matter," Malfoy said snottily as he crossed his arms. "Your Muggle wear is
Harry James Potter closes his eyes slowly as he takes a deep breath. When he opens them, a relaxed and lopsided smile spreads across his lips. He raises his brows in challenge at the viewer.
"Are you alright?" She asked when he looked at her from his awkward angle. "Have a cushion," she advised as the French movie continued to play.
Harry had spent most of his post-war efforts trying to bridge the understanding between the Muggleborn, Half-blood and Pureblood communities and he had returned to Hogwarts hoping that most importantly, his schoolmates would understand that the Slytherins were products of their upbringing. They had all been children, frightened for their lives. At the very end, the law had also judged Malfoy and deemed him capable of rehabilitation. Most importantly, Malfoy had changed. Who were they to mete out their supposed justice?
"Come on now, off you go," Professor Sprout ushered them into the dorm brightly as Draco sighed deeply for the second time.
Harry finally pushed away sheepishly. “So that happened," he said with the typical embarrassment of a Gryffindor after leaping into a situation.
Harry gathered everything quickly, heading for the basins. He needed some space from Malfoy, even though he couldn't stop thinking about him.
“No, it’s not. It’ll be a lot more stable and impartial. Beautification spells are targeted and isolated, and the effect depends on the caster’s perception of their features. Whereas your Potion acts on the beholder and makes the drinker more beautiful in their eyes. It’s a lot more reliable.”
"It's the extra-extra-extra-extra-extra-large version with additional and special photographs," Potter murmured as he regarded Draco distractedly.
"Are you getting your kiss next?" Draco asked with polite interest, shocked when Potter laughed heartily instead of taking offence.
"Thanks," Draco said as he stowed his wand away. "I'll extract Mother’s agreement and then I'll be updated. How did you even come across the property?"
"That's good. Then the possibilities are endless, aren't they?" Narcissa said as she helped herself to more tea. "And we both have so much time to figure it out."
Harry sifted through the stack of rigged mail with his wand. "You've been shopping? It smells like Bubotuber pus."
notebook and redo his essay. Harry had to resubmit his application to Morten on his behalf post haste. "Harry, do you have my black notebook with you?"
Potter thanked the blond with a grin as he moved to put his hair up. "So, another letter to Parkinson? Or Goyle? Or Nott, or your mother, or your father?" He listed off in quick succession, shivering exaggeratedly at the last guess.
Harry made a face as he served Draco a helping of sausages. “I’ll work on it over the holidays. I promise,” he emphasised when Draco only looked at him sceptically.
It is with great apologies that your duties have reached you so late. You should have come to your inheritance upon your age of maturity, but we didn’t think that the past one and a half years was a good time for you.
Harry exhaled sharply in annoyance. Another source of dissonance he experienced was how everyone seemed to have forgotten about the dynamics between himself and Malfoy. They did
Harry frowned as he chewed on his food, distinctly aware that Draco was underplaying the effort he put into the presents. After maxing out her borrowing allowance too many times, Harry had suggested that Hermione copy the books, only to be served a discourse about the anti-replication spells in many books and how using magic on the older books would cause them to crumble to dust. Harry looked at Draco pensively.
"Please, Potter," she held out a hand as she pressed her glasses higher with a trembling hand. "Please also bring Malfoy to the hospital wing. Take this in case you meet Filch," she handed him a pass.
"Maybe murderous teachers is the common factor. It'll be a lot easier to pull off," Harry said, crumpling the note in his fist before he lobbed it vehemently at Malfoy. He smirked when it thwacked against Malfoy's fat head.
Hermione frowned in disapproval. "But your pinching was likewise without consent. Couldn't you have found a better way to teach Harry?"
"So I guess that you're also a feelings person now? Dating a Gryffindor has addled your mind, too?" Harry teased as he thumbed his tears away.
"Add six Butterbeers," he requested, dialling on the charm as he smiled at the bartender. Paying for the drinks, he returned to the tables with Pansy. He gave out the drinks brightly to everyone, inclusive of Potter.
Breaking out of his spell at Potter's strange throaty noise, Draco looked up, frowning when he noticed that Potter had not touched his proffered tart. "Potter, are you not having any?" He demanded. "Have you grown out sweets too? Are they only for kids?" Draco interrogated with a sneer, connecting the fact that Potter had hardly touched his own cake and was now refusing to have any tart. Whatever had the world become?
The both of them startled when a server stopped at their table. When they had placed their orders, Potter enquired about the wine selection, ordering two glasses of light wine to go with their mains.
"Can I help you?" He asked suddenly, taking pleasure in watching the Gryffindors jump in fright. He waited patiently as the girls communicated with each other in a series of frowns and pointed looks.
"Morning," Ron said brightly as he sailed into the office, gasping when he laid eyes on Draco. "Mate, you look like shit. Wild night?"
Malfoy contrite dissolved when Harry only continued to stare at him. "Let's just go," he swung his bag across his shoulder.
Draco was taken aback by the revelation, but looking back at the reading materials Potter favoured and stories about redoing the Grimmauld Place house during summer break, Draco couldn't help but wonder why it hadn't been obvious to him before. "Maybe you could set up something with Greg," Draco suggested. "You could do the renovations, and he could do the custom furniture. And you could rope Blaise in for the schmoozing and design."
"Hermione's a week ahead of you for charms," he pointed out helpfully as he read Malfoy's to-do list in his organiser.
," Ron gasped, red in the face as he tried to work through his coughs, pumpkin juice entering the wrong pipe when he had laughed at Hermione's rant. "Save us again," he managed in between tight coughs, more occupied with making fun of Harry than saving his own life.
"Ronald," Hermione warned without looking up from the study notes she was making for the next month's Transfiguration curriculum.
Harry had been so willing to accommodate Draco that he hadn't questioned it. But alas, he hadn't budged on Draco’s single request.
A nude Harry James Potter is sitting on a Slytherin green couch, slim ankles crossed before him to protect his modesty. The book,
"Shut up," Harry said as he placed the apple beside Malfoy, heady with his success in manipulating Malfoy. He had already used Malfoy's friends to establish scheduled relations; and there would only be improvements in store.
wasn't that hard. Honestly, I initially thought that you guys would only rig it once, until you started being so dramatic about the reveals. I mean, worrying what they'll think when they find out that you were their partner?"
Harry was brimming with happiness as he watched Draco joke with Greg. He had initially been worried about returning to the confines of traditional schooling after the year’s hiatus, but it had brought more than he had expected.
"Well, it doesn't have to be if you–" Malfoy started to reply with a smirk before stopping abruptly.
"I like it," he said stupidly, immediately wincing at the amusement he received. "I mean, you look good."
"To the new French restaurant in Diagon," Harry felt his heart skip at the pleasant surprise that crossed Draco's features. Knowing Draco's picky standards, he had asked Hermione to visit to corroborate the reviews from the Prophet.
Which reminded Harry—"I'm sorry about the-" he waved his hand weakly as he mimed burrowing underground. It was incredibly rude to scope someone's wards without permission, but it was so hard to resist. "Occupational hazard," he said as he combed his hair backwards sheepishly.
"Are you okay?" Harry asked quietly as the started to walk. After Malfoy's comment about his 'cronies' during their first class as Potions partners, Harry had been reminded about his map, and had taken to virtually stalk Malfoy again. Within a few days, he had noticed Walters and his rotation of buddies surrounding Malfoy and he had finally figured out the reason for Malfoy's previous limps. The knowledge that his schoolmates were bullying Malfoy set him on edge. It was the exact bigotry that had perpetuated the war.
Draco hummed noncommittally. It wasn't a bad idea, per se; he had always found Hogwarts' education to be a bit lacking—he paused when he realised that he was thinking about his imaginary children with Harry. He flinched as he pulled his hand away.
"Erm," his eyes jumped from Neville to Lisa Turpin, who was one of Hermione's favourite prefects. He leaned forward to check on Hermione, slumping when Hermione only shook her head helplessly. "Erm, I'm gay, so," he peeked at his roommate guiltily, worried that Malfoy would be disapproving or worse, disgusted. He knew that the wizarding community was accepting of homosexuality, but it was viewed as an inconvenience to Purebloods in their obsession of lineages. He was thankful that Malfoy's expression didn't seem to change.
The Healer glanced at Harry quickly before turning back to look at him. “Cowherd performed a dark slashing curse on your neck. Mr. Potter helped to reverse the darkness and cast some recovery spells before you arrived in St. Mungo’s. Cowherd has been apprehended and will be charged. You might feel a bit of itchiness on your neck while it recovers, but everything should be fine in a while. The scars will fade with more applications of dittany.”
"As the Headmistress has said during the Halloween feast, Hogwarts students are expected to respect each others' right to privacy and dignity. I don't think Potter would appreciate it if he knew that you both were looking for him regardless of your good intentions," Draco said in a swotty voice that came easily to him.
"I'll allow you to dry my hair forever," Harry said, breaking off into a moan when Draco suddenly bent to mouth at his neck, a hand on his cock.
Suddenly feeling a pair of eyes on himself, Draco looked up, going faint at the sight of Potter smirking at him, Hermione chattering away on his right as they made their way to their assigned table. Regardless of the discomfort Draco felt at being the source of Potter's amusement, he could not deny that his ex-nemesis was a sight to behold.
Harry smoothed his thumb against the back of Draco's hand as he looked at Draco fondly, quietly excited for the times to come. Setting aside the soiled handkerchief from Draco, he paused at the hand on his arm.
"Not quite. I'm more of a show-er boy." He burst into laughter when Draco shoved him into the display window of a shop.
“Let’s hope that your gift isn’t too bad then,” Harry joked as he nodded at the present between Draco’s crossed legs.
Harry was frightened by Malfoy's forcefulness. He scanned Malfoy's face in confusion while the other continued to stare straight at him. For no particular reason, the room suddenly felt too crowded and oppressive and he needed to escape.
"Are you feeling better?" He asked, biting his lip when Pansy's knee jerked. It was impossible to take back his question though, and it hung heavily between them. Harry tried to convey the sincerity he felt on his face.
"Well, you'll have me around to maintain your coat anyway," Draco replied, immediately wincing at his carelessness at implying that they had to be sexually exclusive to one another. They had only agreed to be discrete, not exclusive, and he was already flouting the month-old agreement. His face burned as he desperately busied himself with looking for a pair of briefs to wear to preserve whatever was left of his dignity.
Harry reflexively opened his mouth to protest, only to realise that it was actually true. He nodded tiredly in agreement while scrounging for another paper. "They'll probably just stare at us while we try to talk to them."
"We should start penalising people. We'd be rich," Harry grinned as he played with the ring of water on the table.
, but his fringe was a lot longer than it had been before, which was information not shared on his profile. It was ridiculous. These changes were precisely the sort of thing that should be catalogued, not the sunset, peonies, dusty books on a shelf, his computer, Pansy’s fingernails, a swan, and Blaise holding up his middle finger. It was incredibly frustrating when out-of-place Harry grasped the concept of social media better than people who had created it.
"Draco, you're not an it," Harry said breathlessly, his eyes dancing with mirth. He exclaimed when Draco jabbed him sharply in the abdomen.
"I’ll save it for our second date then," Harry smiled brightly as he opened his mouth for Draco’s fork..
Speeding through the pages, he tugged the drawstring bag open and poured out its contents, shoulders slumping at the tiny gold, and lead arrows.
Mrs. Malfoy only waved him off with an amused smile. "It's alright. He really deserved it sometimes, that boy. I'm also more than aware that the hitting went both ways."
“Okay,” Draco whispered as his eyes swept across Harry’s face and rested for a moment on Harry’s lips.
At least Potter's lack of subtlety was heartwarmingly familiar. Draco raised an eyebrow in challenge.
Draco was still walking to the bus stop around the corner of the Post Office when his bus pulled up noisily. Closely avoiding an old man, he ran to catch the bus to Harrods where he would buy more of the biscuits that his mother liked. He also saw his mother and Pansy every week – in separate occasions of course – though sometimes they would overlap, which would be a strange experience for none of his companions but himself.
, you're taking the younger students so you can be the fun teacher. Which, I mean," he made a show of running his gaze from Harry's untameable hair, to the green button down, dark slacks and Muggle shoes before shaking his head in disapproval.
Even though the funds raised from the calendars would go to Hermione's innumerable causes, the purchase of the calendar had brought what felt like the weight of society's suffering upon himself. He would wake to the call of Potter's lewd picture, smirking as he read Tonden Thunderous' scandalous book,
Quickly grabbing Potter by the arm, Draco pretended to push Potter into the road, bursting into laughter at the flash of shock on Potter's face.
A snitch is flying in the air. A hand reaches from behind, catching it between a thumb and index finger. The camera focuses, revealing a nude Harry James Potter lying on in a bed on his side, smiling widely as the wings on the snitch fold into itself.
Draco frowned at the Golden Boy as he considered the possibility of a badger Harry Potter. It left his head spinning, as did the fact that he was sharing a carriage with the most lauded war heroes of magical United Kingdom.
"Is this a Wheeze?" Potter asked as he scrutinised the velvet box before casting a series of detection spells on it with a frown.
Slipping the box back into his pocket, Draco picked a book tangentially relevant to their research before returning to Hermione. He paused at the sight of Pansy perched on their table.
He had shaped the cookies and iced them to look like Malfoy's friends and Hermione, Ron and himself, and it had turned out so well that even Hermione had cooed over them.
"Indeed," Harry agreed as he thought about what he had been subjected to the day before, "let's go."
“Karma really does go round, doesn’t it?” Harry joked, flailing when Draco pinched his nose roughly.
Starting to button from the bottom, he watched the guilt flash across Harry’s face as he took in the scars on his chest. Harry's eyes stayed for a few moments as he bit his lips before trailing down Draco’s body and then returning to his abdomen where his hands were at.
Draco huffed as he pressed his face into Harry's chest, “if you must,” he huffed and Harry laughed fondly at the grudging reluctance in his tone.
Potter rolled his eyes as he burrowed his feet under Draco's thighs. When Potter had first done so half a month ago, Draco had startled and moved away instinctively. However, after repeated exposure to Potter's insolence, Draco had submitted. If this was the price to pay for Potter's company, Draco would comply. Their relationship – Draco didn't quite dare to label it as a friendship – which was initially born out of necessity with Hermione and Weasley constantly snuggling together and making out – had come to be comfortable and genuine. Potter would sit with him in the common room, and their conversations would be lively and amicable.
' when he had laughed it off previously. But needs must, and he was running late. "Harry, you can do it, alright?" Draco repeated seriously as he looked into Harry’s eyes, waiting until he received a confirmation from his friend.
"It's fine," Malfoy replied as he sent his toiletries, dirty clothes and cosmetic products away before sitting down at his desk with a sigh.
"Are you in trouble?" Harry moved sharply in his seat, the sudden movement of his hand tearing the flimsy page of his Muggle motorcycling hobby magazine.
“What is this?” Harry asked as he reached for the bottle of dried loose leaf chamomile flowers. “I think that they’re dead,” he said stupidly as he narrowed his eyes at it.
Draco threw open his cupboard doors the moment he apparated into his walk-in wardrobe. Unzipping his jeans hurriedly, he moaned at the pull of the rough fabric against his already hard cock. Concentration shot, he struggled to conjure lubricant onto his shaky hand.
The grin he received was disproportionate to the statement he made. Draco's frown deepened into a scowl at not being taken seriously.
"Well, if you didn't have to be so embarrassing you wouldn't be in this predicament. You can consider releasing me, or using your left hand," Draco raised an unimpressed brow.
"Zabini! I'm your Secret Santa!" Seamus called out randomly as he waved at the group of Slytherins in the corner of the Eighth Year students' dorm.
"I've told you that it's fine! I'm happy to even be able to spend time with you, erm, to see Paris!"
"Oh come off it, Potter," Malfoy rolled his eyes as he started to walk away. "Not to ruin your fun, but you should probably spend your energy worrying about yourself. Granger has Weasley and vice versa, but you'll only have sick fucks stuffed with stories of your heroic acts, or nutters like Lockhart trying to be in your Potter halo."
"Yeah. We're staying together, right?" Harry said as he toweled his hair, making it messier than it already was. Mother and Andromeda were continuing their tour of China, Arthur and Molly were visiting Charlie, Hermione and Ron were visiting Japan, and Pansy and Theo were going to France while Blaise and Ginny were attending his mother's seventh wedding in Cairo.
Potter sputtered before running to his friends who were seated on top of one another. "Malfoy pinched my butt!" He exclaimed as he collapsed onto the sofa opposite.
"Has the Lake frozen over properly?" He asked as he returned the paper to Draco. Privately, he had checked with Hermione and gotten an affirmative.
"Motivated by spite and jealousy," Harry commented as he nuzzled against Draco's neck. Draco tensed when Harry suddenly paused. "They've sent you letters, haven't they? Don't read any of those rubbish. Those people are bloody mental." Harry turned him around to look straight at him. "If they do anything funny, forward it to the Aurors. I had a letter from Magical Menagerie that tried to bite my face off. It didn't have a magical trace, but I'll be watching them closely. Don't get yourself injured, okay?"
"I already have both," Harry said as he waved the suggestion away. "You'll have to tell me why you don't want to go to l'Intimiste."
Draco rolled his eyes at the glazed looks on Potter and Weasley's face. "You'll still be in Slytherin, I wager," he said to Blaise.
Harry swung his legs from his perch on Malfoy's desk. Helping himself to another mouth of treacle tart, he watched Malfoy sort his parchment papers. He cut another bit and held it out for Malfoy.
“Second, third, fourth, and fifth years move along!" She continued with a lantern in hand. The confusion was palpable as an unusually large crowd gathered around Hagrid, who was speaking cheerfully to a bunch of sixth years.
Are you sure that you have not lost your mind?? But that if your apology was sincere, I will accept it. I was hurt and confused when you insulted me. I actually update my work wear closet from time to time and I genuinely thought that I looked quite smart. I didn't notice that I had grown out of them.
Harry placed a hand on Malfoy's shoulder to hold him steady, overcome by ridiculousness as Malfoy alternated between peeking at the happenings and hiding his face in Harry's knee all the while giggling to himself.
"Harry James Potter, do you permit the proprietor to disclose details of your stay at the property to Draco Lucius Malfoy?" Draco said gravely.
"Malfoy, Jesus! You scared me, fuck!" Potter swore as he inspected their surroundings, quickly concealing his wand.
"Well, Ron isn't as helpless as you," Draco defended before stealing a kiss that quickly deepened. Afterwards he would lament that he hadn't properly recorded their first kiss as a couple mentally, and Harry would disagree about their timeline, but it was still chaste for the short moment.
Harry nodded as he looked at Draco’s legs intently. “I’ve torn my Achilles tendon four times—the left one,” he clarified. He wondered about the coincidences that they had yet to uncover.
"Dunno, he got lost," Teddy shrugged before starting to squirm in his arms, demanding to be released. Draco set the boy down gently, spelling him close as he nudged his cousin back to Mr Dearborn.
Falling to his chair, he felt his eyes sting. He glared desperately at the letter as he tried to control himself. It was hopeless. Conjuring a quick Patronus, he sent it off to Harry, requesting for his company if possible. He needed to be held; he needed to talk to someone. The letter offered no platitudes on guidance or reapplication. It taunted him mercilessly when his pride needed to be coddled for a few moments more.
Malfoy nodded earnestly. "Pansy has a thing for intelligence," he explained as he trailed off in laughter.
Harry shook his head as he lay back down. "Just for today. Too tired to get to Narnia," he mumbled as he turned around to be the little spoon.
Potions that afternoon had been good. Malfoy had not let him handle the brewing, but he had been reasonable–almost
"It was absolutely delightful! And they were hardly fazed when the police appeared!" His mother laughed at Aunt Andromeda's shocked amusement.
"Mr Dearborn?" Potter repeated in confusion, brows rising in surprise when he suddenly noticed the sandy haired stranger between them.
, he thought as his hand glided up his length while he stared at the calendar affixed to the back of his cupboard. He had been so close to those muscular thighs today. When had Potter decided to put his hair up? Draco exhaled with a breathy moan as he imagined his fingers being caught in Potter's messy bun as he pushed Potter's ridiculous dragonkeeping book aside to ride him. Fuck, the sight of Potter's green eyes behind his curtain of long hair, wet mouth dropping open wide like today when he orgasmed, fuck. Draco's muscles contracted as his orgasm ripped through him violently. A loud groan tore from his lips as come spurted out with a shudder.
With reference to the topic at hand, I believe that you would still prefer Muggle work wear? I would like to plan the shops to visit so we do not amble about aimlessly. Is your wizarding wardrobe properly sized and in fashion? Do consider that your attendance would be expected in key society events with your return to the United Kingdom.
Harry put an arm around Draco's waist. "There's still a bit of time between now and dinner. Maybe if you can play it off you'll have a bit of space for some pasketti."
"I'm not wanking," he flipped his comforter open violently, revealing his clothed crotch when he noticed Malfoy narrowing his eyes at him in suspicion.
"Do you need help reaching Narnia?" Draco asked he stretched languorously on his bed, feeling the release in his muscles. "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," he laughed, frowning when his dressing room was silent.
"Yes," Harry snapped his mouth shut as he scrambled to prepare for the showers. For a moment there, Harry had been frightened by the similarity of Malfoy's frenetic energy with Hermione's. After years of domestication, Harry had learnt better than to ask what had been uncovered.
"Read any books lately, Potter?" Draco mentally flinched at his own question. Oh, of all his choices! It took all of his Malfoy upbringing to not betray any of the trepidation he experienced while Potter blinked at him, his lips slowly curling into a smile.
Harry hummed as he waved goodbye. It sometimes felt like Greg was coddling his feelings, which was a weird thought to have, because it was completely unnecessary.
Harry jerked at the sharp kick to his ankle. Sitting back onto the bench, he turned to glare at Ron.
It was more than Harry had ever expected! Potions theory with Malfoy? Harry felt faint in anticipation, flushing as he peeked as Malfoy. The fight in Malfoy's body had ebbed and he now looked weary and defeated.
Most of the eighth years had congregated at Three Broomsticks after a spot of shopping, and Parkinson had gamely volunteered the Slytherins to organise the next party. Hermione pursed her lips disapprovingly at the debauchery of her peers.
with them about propriety when the gifters were revealed. Most importantly, he would not share his new lube with Malfoy. Let him beg for forgiveness when he was struggling with the fiddly
“I don’t,” Harry said as he looked up quickly. “I don’t spoil him,” he repeated quietly when he noticed the shock on Malfoy’s face at his aggressive tone.
Harry grinned shamelessly as he watched Malfoy head for his own bed. He had managed to negotiate for twice weekly Potions lessons during lunch, and their day had ended with a dinner and Harry's first remedial lesson.
Draco frowned as he flipped the page. Based on the catalysing factor of the Lady's Mantle, the book was supporting the fact that his latest potion should have worked.
There was nothing to do when Harry wasn't around. He would turn in early tonight. He had to reorganize the Auror archives tomorrow, and it would take his sanity and then some to complete.
How is the coordination of lesson plans with Heather coming along? I hope that you're liking the job more already.
"I work in Magical Law Enforcement. Contracts are effective. I quite like it, actually," she said with a shrug.
"Why would I do that?" Draco scrunched his nose in distaste. "But yes, there was. The leases continued beyond the change in ownership, of course. We don’t evict people for fun,” he said coldly.
Catching Harry's eyes, he directed his friend a look of concern, frowning when the other looked away quickly.
Breath laboured, Draco pressed his forehead against the door of his cupboard, steadying his breath with his softening cock in hand. Merlin, the interaction with Potter had really done him in. Draco couldn't remember the last time his orgasm had been so quick and violent. Registering the absurdity of his situation, Draco waved his come away before casting his day-old clothes to his hamper.
"Well, it's just the aura." Harry turned back to him consolingly. "You look fine," he assured as he waved his wand at Draco's head. Draco shivered at the tingle of Harry's magic that shot down his spine.
classified as friends. It was always easy to be on top of each other's lives, and suddenly having so many other people interested in being his
"Oh my god, yes! Thursday or Friday! Will you be free, oh my god!" Harry was yelling now as he sat up in agitation.
Draco beamed at his companion, involuntarily bursting out into laughter at the downcast expression on Potter's face.
Draco drew back in confusion. “Shouldn’t Gryffindors have some sort of loyalty towards Weasley’s Wheezes?”
"Lunch will be served in an hour. You can have a rest and wash up in your room. I'll call you when it's ready."
"I don't know." Harry was unconvinced as he watched him closely in scrutiny. "You were excited about the restaurant when Theo talked about it last week. Is Blaise going to be there this Friday? Narcissa? No?" He looked upwards as he considered the matter. "Robards?"
The camera glides over the vast selection of beautifully decorated sweet on display before replaying.
“Draco, it’s okay! It’s okay,” he huffed at the vials pressing on his knees. It was indeed a terrible present, he thought as he tried to shove them away, only for them to roll back, into the depression of the bed, where he was crouching. He reached for his wand to vanish them in annoyance.
Joining the queue for stamps, Draco refused to chicken out. Firstly, his mother would be disappointed. So would Headmistress McGonagall and Professor Vector, who had helped with his application. Secondly, he really
"No wonder Hermione was so insistent on putting that full frontal photograph for that edition. She probably knew that you were the one purchasing it." Draco hummed in agreement. It was unfortunate that his life was now populated by numerous Gryffindors with no sense of privacy. How did Hermione manage to not bring it up to him? Draco refused to think about everything that he might have missed.
Harry moved his heavy limbs to take it, conscious of the ache in his bones. He blinked as he surveyed the otherwise empty room. "Where's Hermione?" His voice was raspy as he filled a cup with water and brought it to his mouth. He pretended not to notice Ron's eyes tracing the movement of his cup intently, the shock about Harry’s precise wandless magic evident.
The man startled as a look of irritation crossed his face. "Young Malfoy. Good to see you back," he barely managed before quickly clearing off.
Ron held a hand up in his direction. "Everybody knows that you and Luna are just friends. Maybe that's why the letters keep coming."
He bit his upper lip under Hermione's challenging gaze, as if daring him to remind them the nature of their relationship.
"It hasn't turned brown yet," Malfoy raised a judgemental eyebrow at him. "You could really do to pay some attention if you want to learn anything at all in this lifetime."
"Well Potter, your very mature friend sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. But I'm sure that he was only pretending to push you out, which makes you a smelly liar." Draco smirked as he held Potter's eyes defiantly.
"No one gets it," he groaned as he deflated with a noisy exhale. He shoved his plate aside to lay his face on the polished wood.
"Draco's right. You guys could stand to be apart for a while," Ron said as he took a sip of his Firewhiskey.
"The glamour you have at your lower temple?" Draco asked in confusion as he tried to pull his hand away.
"Come here and give me a snog too," Harry demanded as he pointed at his lips. Laying beside Harry, they slotted their feet together as Harry scooted closer. Reminiscent of their first kiss, the kiss they shared was no less tender.
She fell silent and they continued walking. "Enough about them. What about you? I saw how Potter was practically fawning over you just now. Do you have anything that you would like to share?"
"Cissa, are you baking again?" His aunt exclaimed from his right. His mother nodded, a look of shy pleasure coming over her features.
Pressing the bit between his tongue and the roof of his mouth, Draco savoured the sweet eggy flavor with a sigh. His work as a healer and his corresponding competence gave him a sense of contentment but it was moments like these, with such simple pleasures, that made him miss the happier days before Hogwarts, when he had run about the manor with his mother and the elves catering to his innumerous whimsical demands.
Teddy giggled when the both of them peppered kisses on the sides of his face. "Okay, no more. I need to decorate my tree," he said almost immediately as he pushed Draco's face away.
Draco's jaw fell apart incredulously. "I'd quite rather choke you, thank you very much!" His neck started to flush as he looked at the tables around them in scandalised shock. .
"Bunch of traitors," Ron replied, downing his firewhiskey with a careful swallow. "George wanted to acquire the shop beside Scrivenshaft's in time for Christmas, but the seller was being difficult."
Knowing his luck, he would probably be a worder or end up with something equally nondescript that would make it impossible to identify his soulmate.
Draco huffed in amusement as he poured the failed potion into a flask for storage. Stowing it away in his stasis chamber, he was smiling regardless of the disappointment at Harry's earnestness. “Shall we go? I’ll reward you for that comment.” Having Harry around made it hard for him to wallow in his misery. Even though the research process was lonely and frustrating—he would have entertainment during his long hours of brewing, and Harry always encouraged him to push his boundaries.
Unlike Hermione, Draco had not been successful in his endeavours–which only confirmed Harry's prior opinions of his capacity for evil. Pansy was entirely unmoved while Draco ranted, blind to his violent gestures. There seemed to be an unspoken 'nobody talks about the Slytherins' party' as most of the Eight Years slumped over their breakfast, miserable and half awake. Harry counted himself lucky, having vomited before he passed out.
As they trudged along, Draco began to feel guiltier for snapping at Potter. The other looked so frustrated and afraid that even Draco's cold Slytherin heart twinged. Potter kept beginning to say something before chickening out almost immediately.
He had moved towards Harry when he saw panic flit across his friend's face, his eyes darting around before landing on girl Weasley. Draco was confused as he watched Harry seemingly plead with girl Weasley.
Trailing his fingers across the rough finishing of the Hogwarts walls, Harry walked down the corridors as the magic in the castle glided along with him. Its eagerness was contagious, and he complied in amusement whenever it alerted him of the new additions to the castle. He was appraising a (relatively) new wall lamp when the magic suddenly began to tremble in excitement.
–with his grudging nods and lack of insults. Malfoy had even pointed him to the right knife, even offering a gruff explanation for its use.
? That's awfully indecent," he complained as he opened his book again. "Bloody Pansy," he groused as he wrote
"How else can I get you to be with me? You're the contracts person. I'm the feelings person. It stopped being about the contract for me months ago."
"I'm sorry. I'm an arse. The biggest arse ever," Draco said quietly while Harry tried to count his breaths so that he would not lose his temper and throttle Draco.
Within an hour, the most junior staff of WEEP had been assigned to the Aurors—Draco had been pulled out from his work in Magical Intellectual Property and thrown into Robards’ office, where the man had warned Draco about obstructing and delaying justice.
"Apparently hair ties disappear all the time," he laughed as he gestured at the mass of accessories on his bed. "They obviously don't know how fastidious I am."
"Yeah. Figured that we forgot more than we learnt in the war," Weasley commented, the carelessness of it taking Draco by surprise. He looked to Potter, only to find himself already under scrutiny.
Potter engaged Draco's lips in another quick, soft kiss as he tucked Draco's fringe behind his ear. They continued to stare at each other, smiles on their faces as they caught their breaths.
Draco was cheerily signing out a patient when he suddenly heard a stream of childish laughter and the chant of his name at the top volume. "Please fill this out, Mr Dearborn. I will be back with you shortly," he said curtly before dashing off.
Calling back the entire team of house elves sent away to the Malfoy properties worldwide for their own safety, Draco had tried to remake the house to the best of his abilities while penning lengthy letters of apology to his schoolmates. However sincere his words were, they were as ineffectual as his efforts in rehabilitating the Manor.
"You wouldn't notice. Even if it hit your face," Draco insisted as he looked straight at Harry. His eyes moved speculatively across his face. "Maybe you would if it hit you right on your filthy mouth."
"Oh, the laundromat—makes me grateful to have magic. People are so chatty in there for some reason," he shuddered as he quickened his pace.
Reaching over, Harry felt the fabric of Draco's suit, gasping quietly when he felt the resonance of a glamour weaved subtly into it. Harry took a step backwards in shock. He had never seen Draco without a suit, and it must have been intentional. Draco wanted to conceal his pregnancy, but why? Harry felt his heart drop when the answer came easily to him. His eyes were hot and his limbs felt weak. Without knowing how he had made it out of his room, he closed the bedroom door. He wanted to hold Draco and to apologise but he was ashamed of himself.
Harry craned his neck to read the signboard. “Serendipity?” he said incredulously. With his wallet almost emptied, he had suggested a quick break before continuing their shopping trip, and Teddy had led him to the end of Horizontal Alley. Even the name of the recommended shop was pretentious.
"Potter, you bloody fuck–Expelliarmus!" Malfoy caught the package easily. "Merlin's pants!" Exasperation gave way to shock when he saw the familiar label on the bottles.
"Can't help it if it likes me," Harry grinned as he accepted the offered hand, gaping when he entered. "Your parlour is obscene!"
For Draco, it was humiliating to be on his hands and legs again after the war. Making his people kneel and grovel had been a major aspect of the Dark Lord's regime, and being in that position made him feel ashamed and vulnerable.
Harry felt Draco squeeze his thigh as his eyes warmed. “Our loved ones, both in our memories and around us, fought for us to sit here today with our friends–both old and new. As we celebrate the shortest day and the longest night tomorrow, I hope that you will share your blessings, and let the light within you shine brighter. Let us examine and let go of our past this holiday. Give the people around you the gift of forgiveness and focus on your goals and intentions for the coming year.”
"Welcome to our sett!" Professor Sprout was cheery to the point of being exhausting as she held everyone's attentions in front of a pile of barrels in a stone recess near the Hogwarts kitchen. "The password is easy, so you'll never have to worry about forgetting it! Just tap this barrel to the rhythm of 'Helga Hufflepuff'!" She demonstrated as the door swung outwards. "Make sure to tap correctly, or," she trailed off, laughing as she caught the eyes of previous students from her house.
Harry was empirically attractive, his hair thick and wavy, eyes bright and intelligent, his skin a healthy olive, his single dimple deep and generous, his chin as strong as his sense of justice. But even when Harry was content on his lap, he was never Draco’s to love. Harry belonged to the brave and the worthy, not the condemned, greedy, and timid.
Draco helped himself to another pleased mouthful of his desert. Giving his date a cursory glance, Draco started at the expression on Finch-Fletchley's face. Not only was the Acclaimed Investment Banker silent for the first time since Draco had asked about his work at the start of the date, Finch-Fletchley was also gaping at him with a strange intensity in his eyes.
The injustices he had levied against non-Slytherin students had discouraged Harry from studying Potions, and the weak foundation compounded anything else that he learnt. It had been obvious when Malfoy had quizzed him on the basics to gauge his proficiency. However, unlike Snape, while Malfoy had been frustrated, his patience did not waiver, and Harry had been immensely grateful.
Harry nodded eagerly in agreement. He wouldn’t be able to focus on his own gift if he didn’t stop worrying about Draco’s reaction. He bit his lips while Draco peeled his gift open in his excruciatingly slow speed.
Thanking the lady, Draco was awashed with an incredible sense of relief as he left the hall. He should have just done it earlier! With another item finally off his self-improvement list, even the weather felt better. Draco felt his mood lift significantly as he walked towards the bus stop. Hiking his bag idly, Draco’s steps were light and unhurried.
The edges of Potter's lips curled from his will to not laugh even as it reached his eyes. "Bloody hell, Malfoy. I might actually appreciate that."
Harry blinked at him in shock, astounded when Draco only dug into his dessert. "So you're not mad?" He asked Draco hopefully.
“Please,” Draco begged as he thrust his swollen cock against Harry’s hip. Harry took mercy on him as he enveloped Draco’s cock with his slick hand. The warm and familiar wetness broke Draco from his fog, and he began to thrust furiously. He pressed his face against Harry’s shoulder as he circled his arm around Harry’s neck.
"No, they have to be together!" Teddy insisted, stomping his foot as he pushed Harry's hand away from the rainbow Teddy blob on the tree. Draco had purchased the Wheezes' customisable figurines ornament set, and Teddy had spent the Saturday morning drawing pictures of everyone that he could think of. After Draco had charmed the drawings into tiny ornaments, Harry had discretely carved the individual names of the Weasleys on the otherwise indistinguishable red haired figurines.
"That's not true," Harry said hotly, unthinkingly clenching his fists in frustration. "You deserve more than that! You'll be able to find someone who would love you!"
"I just, erm–" his eyes settled above Malfoy's shoulder instead, "I was just wondering if you were going to erm, follow your dad's instructions and marry a Pureblood witch." Harry said haltingly. He peeked at Malfoy when the other boy huffed in laughter.
"Thanks," Harry tore the wrapper off hurriedly when it was clear. Honestly, couldn't he had gotten a more enthusiastic gift partner like himself? It would be nice to get gifts more often.
"No, you didn't. I haven't had French food at all." Harry's brows were twisted as he tried to remember the meals he had had with Draco.
Harry Potter was dishevelled when we met, his complexion grey, his eyes dull, and his hair standing from exhaustion and distress. His message was plain, as referenced in the headline of the article.
“There's no need for that.” Harry grinned, pushing the cushion flat on Draco’s lap to lay his head on it.
Exhaling impatiently, Draco pushed a frustrated hand through his hair. He looked at the end of the library blankly as he considered his next steps. There was no clear substitute, unless it was something else in the ingredients list, but nothing else was pinging. He had broken the potion down so many times, obsessed over the reaction in each step. Draco was angry and frazzled. Nothing was making sense, and this potion was taking too long. He had spent two years building his portfolio to be an Unspeakable, and if he never got his third potion down—he swallowed as his stomach clenched. He got to his feet, the heavy chair sliding against the polished wooden floor.
"Stop moping right now," he jabbed his elbow into Harry's ribs, "you look like it’s your seventy second time having difficulty conceiving. It's unattractive."
Draco moaned softly in surprise and surrender, his breath shaky when Harry suddenly leaned in to press a kiss at the curve of his neck and shoulder. He clutched weakly onto the checked wool coat he had bought for Harry last winter.
After they had visited the Arc de Triomphe (Draco had managed to wrestle Potter into submission to take the underpass instead of dashing across the road), Potter had mentioned that it had been his first time being successful at sightseeing. Draco had learnt that Potter had an abysmal sense of direction and would always get lost whenever he ventured out alone. Taking pity, Draco had shared that he would be looking to purchase some toys for Teddy. Would he like to join? Perhaps they could grab dinner and visit the Eiffel Tower afterwards?
Draco sighed noisily as the fight left his body. "You're really my Achilles heel. Let's go in, shall we?"
Swallowing the warm come in his mouth, Draco continued his ministrations, speeding up his own hand on his lap. He was so close. The sight of Harry keening underneath him finally pushed Draco over the edge, his mouth going slack as he moaned against Harry's cock.
"I'll always reign in Arithmancy and Potions though," Malfoy said as he began to draw up his to-do list for the next day.
Draco laughed at the nature of their bet. "I took the bus. There was a direct service from my house."
Potter looked miserable, and his friends who had all coupled up were not helping. Weasley and Hermione were continuing with their not so secret make out sessions, Luna and girl Weasley were always whispering inside each other's ears, and Longbottom and Abbott were busy mucking about together in the greenhouse.
He needed to do something quickly to end the thrall of the arrow without jeopardizing the friendship with Harry that he had come to value so much.
Harry slapped his thigh in laughter when Brocklehurst gamely got onto her knees and crawled towards Padma who was seating two seats away from her. Padma was blushing as she reached for Brocklehurst's hand.
Draco stumbled as he landed at the Leaky Cauldron. Scanning the place, he quickly spotted Harry and Ron at a corner, Harry listening distractedly, eyes flitting about the door of the pub and Ron, who was gesturing wildly.
Draco sighed when he boarded the carriage. Couldn't the Golden Trio have walked a little further down? The awestruck students on the platform had migrated to outside what was presumably Potter's cabin, pushing against each other to catch a sight of Potter, as if months of idle reporting of Potter's whereabouts hadn't been enough.
"That's cute," Draco mirrored his smile before he slapped the bit of cake into the corner of Harry's mouth instead, viciously spreading it with the back of his fork while Harry looked at the ceiling with heavy resignation.
Potter pouted at the sarcasm. He didn’t know that the statement wasn't too far from the truth. "Are you going for dinner?" He suddenly asked as they crawled towards their common room.
Draco shrugged. "It's helpful, I guess. I suppose that you don't?" He took a sip of the water when it arrived, desperate for a distraction.
Draco felt his face heat at the casual jab, desperately wishing for the floor to swallow him whole. He only wore variations of his preferred woody scent, and the one with citrus notes was his choice for respectable gatherings—something that Harry had obviously noticed. He so often belittled Harry's eye for details to disastrous outcomes. He bit his lips sharply while Harry made a show of looking through every cupboard.
Potter raised an unimpressed brow. "Honestly, being Finch-Fletchley wouldn't be so bad would it? He's got things going for him, with or without sweets. It'd be quite nice, I think."
Malfoy was Malfoy and he was Potter. Just because the eighth years had become closer didn't mean that his and Malfoy's relationship had to change. He opened his mouth to disagree, only to be cut off by a speculative Malfoy.
"Harry could do with a partner so the Prophet doesn't lose their minds. They'll crank up the gossip, and then the letters will come," Hermione looked heavily at Draco as if the Prophet's shoddy reporting was his fault.
Harry tapped his jaw as he waited impatiently for his students to leave. His practical class had accidentally overrun and he was now late for his weekly dinner appointment with Draco. Taking only the graduating Potions class, Draco was at Hogwarts thrice a week for a few hours each time, and Wednesday was the only day that their schedules coincided.
"For old time's sake, why not?" He replied, acutely aware that it was the first time Malfoy had ever joked with him. Harry was worried that he would scare Malfoy away with a wrong word.
Listening to the rustle of parchment, Harry curled his legs as he looked at the neat slope of Draco's hair at the back of his head. He curled his fingers as he desperately resisted the urge to comb through and trail his hand down the slope of Draco's neck.
Spending time out of school with Harry was a lot like spending time in school with Harry. It was a strange but necessary statement. After their fight (which Draco theorised had helped Harry to be more secure of their friendship), Harry had become more comfortable with him, which had culminated in increased physical contact. When they parted at Kings Cross with promises to meet, Draco had expected Harry to be less touchy-feely now that they were out in public, but that aspect had remained. Harry had shushed Draco with a finger over his lips when he had enough of Draco spoiling Fight Club, and Draco had proceeded to lick the offending finger gleefully while their fellow moviegoers glared at them in disapproval.
Draco pat his cheek with a sardonic smile before striding off. Craning his neck, Harry watched as Draco tapped Anthony Goldstein on the shoulder to hand him the present he had been fidgeting with the whole afternoon.
Draco sighed as he leaned backwards. Harry had just left, but he was already missing him. His relationship with Harry was so easy. Ever since they had agreed to be friends years ago, they had always paired off during outings, the conversations between them endless as the number of inside jokes piled up. The transition from friends to more had taken him a bit, but Draco would learn to let his guard down overtime. Unfolding the papers, Draco was excited for the future to come.
"Please pardon Potter's performance," Harry mumbled when they got up to leave for their classes. Most of the Eighth Years had decided to seat at the Ravenclaw table that morning and it was hard to complain to Hermione and Ron about his issues.
"No, you can't. You're an expert. Experts can't be so—" He stopped when Harry managed to close his hand into a fist. "Oh, you're nothing. You don't exist anymore," he said gravely.
"Let's go to the Headmistress, shall we?" Ron said with fake cheer as he levitated two students, nodding for the paler-than-usual Malfoy to handle the last.
"Oh, erm, if you don't mind," Harry said nervously as he sat at the polished dining table before a hearth. He idly wondered if the wards’ familiarity was in recognition of their intertwined bloodline, his ownership of Grimmauld Place, or the life debt that he owed Mrs. Malfoy. He was content for it to be a mix of all three. Despite the uniqueness of the situation, his occupation hazard didn't extend far enough for a thorough investigation. Besides, after sustaining another injury in Morocco from his partner's misjudgement, he was tired. The constant travelling was also wearing him out, and he needed to figure out his life. He took a sip of tea before humming in surprise at its preparation.
I have never been more grateful that Harry Potter saved us all so that we could all live to see this day—Our Wizarding Hero on the Best Dressed List! With obvious influences from his friend and date of the night, Harry Potter is similarly dressed in tailoring genius Winthralls, making a bold statement with dark green velvet and delicate embroidery. Call your bookmakers, can we expect more?
"Do you think that we're going to be re-sorted?" Draco asked Blaise as they gathered with their fellow eighth years, a much smaller cohort than previous years.
"No, you cannot," Teddy said curtly. Stepping backwards to inspect the tree with a solemn nod, he picked up a length of tinsel on the floor.
Malfoy suddenly broke out into a grin. "It's complete rubbish," he said, finishing his whiskey at a single go.
Potter jumped when Draco's warming spell washed over him. He gestured for them to continue walking. "I wasn't aware." Potter stated unnecessarily.
Malfoy's head shot up sharply. All private conversations ceased, the room falling silent as Malfoy narrowed his eyes at the bottle pointing at him, then his friend. "Truth," he said after a prolonged staring match. Everyone leaned in in anticipation.
Draco listened as his mother told Aunt Andromeda about the nudist group she had met while shopping in Rue St Catherine.
"Mate, let's go," Ron kicked his foot as he held a hand out. Harry took it gratefully, laughing when he almost tripped over himself. He looked around the room. Malfoy and his friends were still having an intense conversation at the couches while the Hufflepuffs had commandeered the leftover drinks in their small circle.
Draco rolled his eyes as he pulled his hand away. “Save it Potter. You’re a saviour past his prime,” he said as he reached for the mashed potatoes. “Imagine not being able to memorise Golpalott’s Three Laws.”
Draco pressed their lips together in lieu of a reply, a soft moan escaping his throat when they met clumsily. Harry went slow, moving his lips deliberately as he savoured every moment. Opening his lips slightly, he sucked on Draco's bottom lip, sighing when Draco slid his tongue into his mouth. Harry's skin was buzzing from the simple pleasure, and his mind went blank as he surrendered himself to Draco. They kissed for what seemed like minutes before Draco pulled back, lips swollen and breath heavy.
At a stop away from St Pancras station, Draco collected his thoughts and steeled himself, slipping into the Malfoy sang-froid. Alighting the bus, Draco's steps were unhurried, betraying nothing of his trepidation. He weaved through the crowd easily, filled with a deep sense of displacement. He could still remember the excitement he had felt when departing for Hogwarts for the first time, the puerile anticipation he used to experience like that lifetimes ago. Yet here he was, heading towards Platform Nine and 3/4 once more, without his parents.
Draco opened the lids to inspect the contents. "This is yours, Potter," he turned around, box in hand to offer Potter when he noticed the man staring contemplatively at his arse, bottom lip between his teeth. Draco's eyes widened in shock, a confused noise escaping his throat. His brain refused to process the situation before him.
Draco shook his head as he flexed his empty hand. Harry had pulled away when the Healer had burst in, and Draco felt vulnerable and unmoored.
"Alright," Harry laughed, smiling when he noticed Malfoy looking at him in the dim illumination of the moon. Harry went to sleep contented, giddy with amusement and gratitude towards Malfoy.
As Hermione relaxed before pondering about his question, Draco wondered if he was supposed to triplicate his letters in future. He would send one to Pansy, one to Hermione, and the last to Potter, who was always so strangely obsessed with him.
"Shut up,” Draco hissed as he straightened his uniform. “I’ll be hauled to Azkaban for flouting copyright law,” he said, lips curling at the edges even though his eyes were serious.
"Bloody hell, do you guys ever travel alone?" Malfoy complained as Ron's wand accidentally fell to the ground mid-twirl.
"The more you try to be perfect to be accepted by those people, the more you'll be torn apart because they wouldn't accept you even if you bent over to beg. And if Potter does, then you should bloody get on it."
Harry dropped the mirror in his hand with a groan. Knowing his luck, that scenario was more likely than a mundane meeting at a post office.
The arduous owl deliveries had been replaced by a glossy, carved wooden box to hold messages, and his mentors had whittled down to one. The exchange with his fifth cousin once removed had given him more information to understand the existence of gods, and an avenue for questions regarding their inheritance.
Harry focused on his amusement as he tried to ignore the tightness in his stomach when he peeked at Malfoy–who was already doing the same. Harry quickly looked away when he received a raised brow.
"My great great great great great grandfather won this from a bet in a Gentleman's Club in the 1600s. It's been with our family since."
"Well, maybe Andie told you," Potter retorted, shortness evident in the stubborn set of his jaw even as the tension in his shoulders loosened.
Looking back at this ridiculous date years after, Draco would only remember the shape of Finch-Fletchley's skull, Potter's unbelievable sexiness, and the crème brûlée. It was just as well that he could only remember the good parts.
After bidding his mother goodbye, Draco took up residence in one of their London properties with Worry and Sneezy. Having raised him, the elves had been adequately disgruntled at being banished from the Manor during the war, and the idea of leaving Draco alone once more had not sat well.
Potter looked up quickly, his look of hopefulness quickly turning into excitement. He talked about trying out the spells he had learnt to redo his gardens and redetail the ceiling trims of his inherited property.
Are you sure that you can spare a full Friday?? Please don't inconvenience yourself! I am already deeply thankful that you are willing to go along with me at all.
"Secondhand books, or copying from my family's collection,” Draco replied as he helped himself to the leg of ham.
He had yet to resume his usual workload, but the job of past-Harry was what he had always desired. His Auror team was competent and close knit, their strong bonds forged from tough cases. However, Harry had thought that he would have had a lover by thirty. He understood that his work was consuming, but surely there was somebody he could share his life with? What if another six years passed? Would he still be alone in his cavernous house when Teddy finished school, when Ron and Hermione had their second child?
Draco shrugged. In the immediate aftermath of the war, when the magical community had shunned them for the parts they had played, the Slytherins had closed ranks in both support and commiseration. His family's trials had just ended and they had gathered in Blaise's house, worrying about their gloomy prospects when Pansy had gotten frustrated by their pessimism, enquiring if her friends were going to be like the rest of the school in questioning her judgement. All of them had frozen up then, but eventually they had learnt to take their past follies in stride. Had all of them not grown up to become better people? Were they not capable of seeing the wrongs in their past decisions? Then why should they be taken hostage by the erumpent in the room?
Potter, I worry for your date. They seem too nice to die like this. But honestly, being enemies when you were both in school? That would mean that you guys have been a part of each others' lives (for better or worse) for more than twenty years. If you're at the stage of going on dates, I don't think that it'll go too badly. I happen to think that you're perfectly sincere in a bumbly, endearing sort of manner and that can be quite charming. They'd be silly to not enjoy the date tomorrow!
Judging by Potter's casual confidence as he skimmed the menu, it was evident how much Potter had changed from his school days. The past Potter would not have been comfortable releasing a sexy calendar that solely relied on his popularity for sales, nor would he have been at ease in a fairly upscale restaurant, much less a foreign one. And Draco was certain that he wouldn't have gamely spent time shopping to get a new blazer just for dinner.
My mind-healer says that I should hang out with you more often because I am happier and more excited. I'll be bringing Teddy to Thorpe Park on Sunday and it has the fastest Muggle rollercoaster in the UK. It is an amusement park where Muggles visit to scare themselves and get their adrenaline going. Would you like to join us? Teddy is incredibly excited and I would be very happy if you could join us. I'll apologise in advance for it being a Sunday. Unlike you, we're both layabouts :(
"Ayeeee," Seamus called when the floppy wizarding hat reached him. Harry watched nervously, ignoring the elbow to his side as the boy made a show of picking a name.
Nonetheless, Draco had prepared accordingly. He produced his list, before clearing his throat lightly. "Firstly, to maintain my top in class ranking for Potions, History of Magic, and Transfiguration until I graduate," he recited, grinning as he looked straight at Hermione.
Harry shook his head as he finished his glass of milk. "I'll fetch it for you? You should get some rest. I'll have a shower before I return. You can dry my hair if you're still awake."
"Yes, it does. We are harassed daily, and every other day there's a letter with malicious intent." That's polite language for delayed suffocation spells and lethal contact poisons.
"Of course," she replied evenly as Harry surveyed the surroundings once more with a renewed perspective.
Draco frowned at Harry, who was swaying in his seat while laughing. He swapped his drink with Harry disapprovingly. "Potter, you're getting morose again," he said as he nudged his water towards Harry.
"That makes me a small WEEP. Or a tiny WEEP."  Harry's right dimple was showing, his eyes shining as he beamed at Draco.
Draco stared at the offering in shock. "This is the first and last time, okay?" He warned as he took the gifts from her. Thanking him profusely, they quickly disappeared, leaving Draco to himself as he inspected the Parisian chocolates with grudging approval. Plucky Gryffindors with a good taste were as rare as invisibility cloaks.
“How was the game?” Draco asked, the familiar minty scent of Harry’s shampoo tickling his nose as he kept the book away. He was nervous, his eyes unable to still as Harry sunk further into the sofa, the warm line of his body pressed against him.
for Merlin’s sake. Not trusting himself to speak lest he propositioned Harry, Draco nodded quickly, shivering involuntarily at the bright smile that Harry gave him.
Draco's blood rushed south at the sight. It was an image worthy of the charity calendar in his cupboard, and the past six months' images flashed through his mind, mixing with the unintentional seductiveness of an amused Potter. Fuck, he shot up quickly, ramming against Potter's arm that had strangely reached over him. Draco fell backwards on his head.
"You must have been a very good boy this year, Blaise," Malfoy said quietly to his friend as he looked at the glazed expression on Seamus' face. Malfoy raised a brow in question when Harry continued to stare at him instead of reaching for the hat.
wanted to make sure that you liked your gifts, and then I didn’t know how to stop afterwards.” He looked at Draco nervously as he tried to gauge his reaction, despairing when he caught nothing on Draco’s stiff face.
Draco glanced quickly at Harry, careful to not rest his eyes too long on any part of him. Even though Harry's crown was bumpy and his hair was slightly frizzy, his hair was shiny, wavy, and healthy. Draco focused on the tip of Harry's ear instead before meeting Harry's eyes for a beat. "It's Potter-esque," he said before being distracted by the new note that flew into Harry's cubicle.
for Merlin’s sake, and his supposed compatibility partner was the bastion of goodness, the complete antithesis to his entire existence, and if they ever got together the media would be relentless, shredding him to pieces as they did to Mother, who was now a shut-in.
Narcissa patted his leg in commiseration. Harry turned back to face the television, conscious that he was now a year older. He steadfastly refused to think about the letters the both of them had sent out for his new job. Settling in to watch the movie, they were heedless of the time.
“How about I’ll cook you dinner too on the day you accept an offer that you like?” Harry said, not noticing Draco’s panic. Draco hadn’t been looking at anyone when the arrow had pricked him, which meant that the arrow would point him to an available person that was the most compatible with him in the vicinity, and nudge him towards them.
“Speak for yourself,” Malfoy rearranged the plates so that the shiny chocolate-coated pastry shaped like a dome was in front of him. “You don’t even treat
"No, as I said, we're no longer together. I've decided that you guys are too Gryffindor for me. Goodbye," Pansy said flippantly as she walked off.
9. Jacqueline Marsh, Marsh Tyres and Auto Fittings, 7 October 2002, Letter detailing how my degeneracy and unnatural tendencies are affecting Harry.
"Definitely not," Pansy insisted, pulling Draco along as they walked towards Platform Nine and 3/4. "You wouldn't be betting on that if you actually knew Draco properly."
"Gotta go," Draco said, pulling away from Harry. Quickly pressing a kiss to Harry's cheek before he could overthink it, Draco rounded the table to address Pansy. "Let's go," he said. He nodded at Hermione and Ron, disregarding their confusion at the sudden interruption, completely unaware that he was saving their relationship.
Draco scarcely looked at his reflection, not bothering with his hair or cologne. With the help of his potion, he would look the best that he would ever manage in the eyes of his beholder anyway. Downing the latest potion confidently, Draco flooed to the foyer before apparating to the gates, headed for his favourite club from what seemed like a lifetime ago.
Potter hummed in agreement. "I love it when my very mature friend pushes me into the road just to end an argument."
This parallel universe was growing steadily more bizarre and he had no idea at which point it had spun out of control.
It was in this ridiculous position that they were caught by the Headmistress. After a stilted and heated explanation, they were rewarded with a
Draco rolled his eyes at how dumb and hopeful Potter looked with his gift in his hands. "Are you ever going to open it?" Draco asked fell into the space beside the Chosen One.
Do you think that I'll be posting something to Hogwarts?" He asked as he continued to scrutinise his mark, just to be sure. "How can something this normal be red marked?"
Potter nodded. "I couldn't sleep much, and I suddenly woke and–" he looked at Draco before quickly looking away. "I'm gay," Potter blurted out. "Gay, bisexual. I'm bisexual," he corrected himself.
"You wouldn't have to worry about that," Harry said as he climbed into the bed. "Hermione told me that brown and black don't crack. As in, we don't age that quickly, you know? Whereas—" He looked at Draco skeptically.
"I don't think I'll ever get over taking pleasure in your misery, friends or otherwise," Draco laughed. "Harmless misery, of course," he quickly clarified when the server arrived with their starters. Potter continued to look at him with his strange expression even as Draco thanked the man.
Draco frowned at the strange tension from his patient. While Draco had to offload some of his patients to his colleagues due to the complexity of the case, he had always found the man's effusive gratitude to be excessive. Draco cast a quick look at Potter who looked strangely unhinged. It was a look which Draco was unfortunately familiar with.
Draco flicked the tanned hand off his parchment. "You're wrong, Potter. Even a wee baby could do with more adorable outfits and interactive books."
Harry looked at Ron, acknowledging the dark smirk on his friend's face with a grim smile. It had been a while since he had let himself be consumed by this nervous energy. He led the way, scanning the map quickly, his heart racing in perverse excitement to see Walters and his gang still waiting along the corridor.
"How is it not?" Pansy laughed tonelessly, her lips twisted in a cruel smile. "You just need to do whatever the fuck you want."
Draco had been heading for lunch one day when he had received a recruitment flier for volunteering at GOSH. He had been exploring the convergence of Muggle and Wizarding psychology, and had been taken by the more sympathetic nature of Muggle psychology (regardless of its multiple false starts due to unfortunate bigotry). The idea of utilising his knowledge to provide support for patients and their parents appealed to him. The opportunity to interact with Muggles was also a significant boon in his quest for self-rehabilitation.
“I wasn’t slacking, I was—” he began to defend himself, breaking off with an eye roll when he realised that Malfoy was only pulling his leg.
He decided to test the efficacy of the arrow. "Did you spend your Hogsmeade outing with the both of them? Are you going to do it again?"
Harry nodded and tried his best to look as earnest as possible. He wondered if he could schedule a chat with Malfoy beforehand just to satisfy his curiosity.
Draco’s head shot up when he heard quick footsteps towards their direction. He stumbled forward. He had to divert them, bring them away from Pansy until he could speak to her privately. He would talk her down from her foolishness, he would help her to see the error of her ways, he would—“Hermione,” he greeted breathlessly, catching her immediately when they collided, his reflexes fast from the adrenaline, his heart nearly leaping out of his throat when his mind processed the gravity of meeting his friend.
"When the answer became obvious, I realised that Ron had probably rigged it twice for you to draw my name, which was why you had your hand in the hat for so long. Everything finally came together," he waved his fingers proudly with a smirk.
Draco shook his head with fond exasperation. "Obviously I'll be the sexy one," he yelped, nearly falling over putting on his trousers when Harry groped his arse. "Potter, hands off the arse. I'm the top in bed."
"Alright, see you tonight. Neville can hardly fly, much less play Beater and fly at the same time. Don't miss me too much when you win," he joked as he brushed past his friend, heading for the common room's poorly designed exit.
Knowing that Draco would be returning to assist Narcissa in refurbishing the Manor, Harry had been reminded of the nightmares Draco used to have in the semester. After a bit of agonising, he had purchased natural sleeping aids and bath products to help Draco feel a bit better.
After the joint meal between Potter, Andromeda, Teddy, Mother and himself, Draco had experienced a bout of guilt at the idea to wanking to Potter. The increasing familiarity with Potter made it awkward whenever Draco inevitably saw him again.
"Do you see why he annoyed me so much previously? He just manages to be so into himself without even trying!" Draco exclaimed while Potter looked at him, hurt.
Harry raised his brows at the suggestion. "Finally a decent idea from you," he lowered the drawer's wards and pulled the wrapper out without revealing any of its contents.
"Your mother's a Black," Harry wheezed between laughs, bursting into a sharp giggle when Draco managed to pull his hand free.
41. Constance Cowherd, Magical Menagerie, 28 October 2002, Delayed suffocation spell. Had to summon Worry.
"Yes, thank you," Malfoy replied finally. Harry nodded, realising that maybe he shouldn't have come to visit Malfoy so early–but he had spent the entire night worrying and it had only felt right to check on Malfoy first thing in the morning.
“Well, you can’t say such things without offering me a chance to check. If you're not going to show me your arse, at least turn around, will you?”
Harry hummed from his lazy sprawl on his bed. "Maybe it's a love letter. About your hair. Maybe," he mumbled as he tucked a hand under the warmth of his comforter. Had he been less sleepy, he would have seen Draco gaping at him, face flushed pink with pleasure. But alas, it was past the usual time that they slept, and Harry’s vision was already fuzzy from fatigue. His bed smelled minty, and it was so soft. He could melt in it, maybe. Harry pulled his legs up in foetal position.
suspended before him. Focused on the contents, he did not seem to notice the book releasing heart-shaped bubbles from the top of its spine. Detaching after it reached a certain size, the bubbles vanished quietly after drifting too far.
"I'm going to leave now," Harry said, pressing his nails into his palms in helplessness and frustration when Madam Promfrey tutted at his presence.
"Well, I'd vote to keep the next party on Wednesday. Not only is it disruptive, it's also incredibly chaotic, which automatically means that it'll have my support," Parkinson said over her champagne to the resounding support of the Hufflepuffs and one Seamus Finnegan.
Stunned by her optimism, he suddenly remembered that she had after all, uprooted her entire life and withdrawn to an old Malfoy property to run a bed and breakfast on her own. He suddenly felt ashamed by his thoughts, but he was so tired, and he didn't want to be brave, independent, or strong on his own. He was so lonely, and he just wanted to be
"How plebeian," Malfoy commented as Harry turned the bag around to estimate the cost of it. "Does it have any note?"
"Alright," he said while Scourgifying his legs just in case. Because of his injury, he had been confined in the house, but despite being in close quarters for more than a week, their relationship had managed to flourish. Harry would spend his time reading the novels she had, try his best to paint landscapes with her in the vast fields, and trade stories about their lives over tea. If he disregarded the ache in his leg and the deep sorrow he nursed over his persistent singlehood, he otherwise felt like a child, and it was an unfamiliar but welcome experience. It was novel to have an adult figure so focused on his well being. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were always distracted by their chores, children, and hobbies, while Dumbledore saw him more as a means to an end, more preoccupied with obfuscation than to care for him. Remus was too haunted by his losses and his furry little problem to think about him. For Harry, Narcissa was the Sirius that he could have had. Ravaged by Azkaban, his godfather would often lose himself within his mind, but he had tried to make Harry happy, in as much that he could. Nowadays, Harry fell asleep jealous of Malfoy's luck.
Draco smiled at her gratefully. He had barely skimmed the write-up from Pansy, but knowing the effort from Harry and his friends, it would surely be good. "Did you meet Harry on your way out? I just woke up, and we had a bit of a talk." He said shyly.
, curling his fingers in Draco's hair as he pulled him close. Harry's lips were on Draco's as he pressed all of his happiness into him.
"Yes, I did. I'm glad that you guys are finally together. I thought that I should wait, but you'd probably appreciate it." She extended a hand at Draco, nodding for him to take it. He slipped his hand into hers quizzically.
Harry stared at him. He looked at the handkerchief, before returning to look at Draco. "Oh, you bloody—" he complained, before the laughter overtook him. The both of them laughed together, their respective gifts crumpled and forgotten on their laps.
2. Confine topics of discussion to school related questions only. Do not talk about yourself or your life!
In a fit of insanity comparable to the Headmistress', Draco sent an apologetic look to Blaise before thumping his bag down beside Potter with a wide smile for Professor Slughorn. "Elixir to induce euphoria today, sir? One of Potter's best, isn't it?"
A week and a half into their fall out, Draco still felt uneasy about telling Potter about his volunteering stint. It wasn't something to be flaunted, or used as a statement for his personal development journey. He wished that he could talk about it while Silencing Potter, then lift it and continue with their
Potter's eyes shot up quickly, blinking at him with an expression of shock as his cheeks pinked. "I can't believe that you take so much pleasure in my misery," he complained with a pout before dissolving into mumbles as he fidgeted in his seat.
Draco was immediately comforted that the Sorting Hat had yet to make a judgement. It had hardly landed when he had been sorted Slytherin seven years ago – and what a pride it had been for him, then!
transference of knowledge in any form. You wouldn't know fashion even if it hit you in the face!" For some strange reason unknown to Draco, Potter seemed upset by the statement. Regardless of his intention to reconcile with the Chosen One, Draco refused to apologise for it.
Apart from the small smile on Parkinson's face, she seemed almost disinterested as she basked in the attention of everyone. In contrast, Malfoy was completely wound up as he twisted his fingers repeatedly. It was evidence of the Slytherins' insanity, Harry thought privately. To fear that your friend would betray your confidence for entertainment.
"Goodnight," Harry mumbled as he nuzzled against his pillow. His lids were heavy, and his mind was foggy. He sunk deeper into sleep as a hand pat him softly on the head.
“It’s always nice to be validated,” Draco commented casually as he reached for a cup of chocolate mousse, “what did Ron give you?”
"Go wash the equipment, Potter," Malfoy ordered impatiently. "You're an absolute nightmare today," he complained.
"Oh. Harry loves you so much too," he said as he crawled over and wrapped them both in his muscly arms.
conversation wasn't painful, and interests converged. Most importantly, he would have been adequately affected if the Dark Lord had suddenly resurrected and AK-ed them. The revelation had left Draco sleepless, having grown up with all the people he
A floppy, big red ribbon is revealed to be tied into a beautiful bow around his cock. He reaches and pulls the end of the ribbon. It uravels smoothly, and falls silkily onto the floor.
Reaching across the table to catch one of Draco's moving hands, Harry smiled shamelessly when Draco stopped talking to gape at him.
to him the day after he gone Christmas shopping with Potter, and Draco had been upset about the unfavourable coverage before Harry had appeared, ranting about the lady at the video rental shop. Draco had quickly forgotten about his strop as they settled, watching The Matrix.
He continued petting Draco as his sobs slowly subsided into sniffles. “Do you want to lie down?” Harry asked quietly as he pulled back. His heart ached at the miserable sight before him–Draco’s eyes were bloodshot, his face blotchy and mottled, his nose a dull red.
Their renewed friendship was unlike anything Draco had had. The closest description would be a much chattier version of Theo, or a Pansy that thrived less on people's mistakes, which were both unthinkable. Theo was as stoic as the goblins he now worked with, and Pansy took great pleasure from tutting in disapproval. Draco enjoyed the change in pace so much that his gayness had reared its head and haunted him.
Draco only hummed in response, used to Harry’s unsubtle pleas. It had been months but of unsuccessful begging, but a Gryffindor’s stubbornness was incomprehensible. “I’m busy,” he replied, grateful when Harry didn’t push.
Draco had thought about spending most of his time at GOSH, and the invitation had reminded him that he had to spend time with his new friends too. "I'll ask Mother tomorrow. She would be delighted, I believe."
"I'll negotiate for a better time," Malfoy said when he noticed Harry's raised brow. Harry laughed in comprehension. His sleep schedule had improved significantly since rooming with Malfoy who would be asleep by ten thirty, and awake at seven thirty.
Working his other hand along the bottom of Harry's prick,  Draco swallowed as he felt fingers along his scalp, guiding him as Harry thrusted into his throat. Breathing through his nose, he loosened his jaw as he continued to pump the base of Harry's cock, basking in the groans he pulled out.
"Oh, love," Harry sighed as he rushed over to hover over Draco. Draco pulled him close as he pressed his face into Harry's jumper.
Harry laid the back of his hand on his forehead. He really needed to figure this out even at the expense of his life.
Pushing the shop's glass door open, Draco suddenly fretted. "Are you okay with Chinese?" He asked quickly, suddenly remembering to enquire about Potter's preference. "It's authentic and they even pull their noodles fresh," he explained hurriedly at the hesitation on Potter's face. Healer Zhou had brought them to the shop during their trainee days and Draco had come to crave their beef noodles from time to time. After both his mother and Andromeda agreed that it tasted like the noodles their great grandfather had served, they would often drop by as a family.
Stopping by the toilets, Draco had looked at himself in the mirror, to marvel at the Head Boy badge on his chest. Years ago, the immature boy he used to be would have been dizzy with the power entrusted to him. Now, as he rubbed at the tension between his temples, Draco wondered how his incarcerated father would react to the sight of him now. Would he be proud of Draco's Head Boy status, or be more affected that his heir was now in Hufflepuff? Shaking his head, Draco cast the question out of his mind before running towards the dungeons, worried about his tardiness for double Potions.
Arithmancy and Ancient Runes?" Weasley interrupted Draco's discussion with Hermione about their latest assignment.
Draco leaned away. "What are you doing?" he demanded in shock, yelping when Pansy smacked her lips noisily against his cheek.
“Oh,” Draco said quietly as he worried at his lips. Harry kept his newest gift away in his drawer, huffing in amusement at the row of them. He met Draco’s eyes to laugh at it, only to be taken aback by the conflict in them.
