“Do you see now?  Do you understand why I cannot tell the minister?” Harry asked.
“The potion for my mother? Please?” Draco turned towards Harry pleading.
Draco groaned, if anything he knew Harry was the better flyer… plus it was totally unfair he had all those years...but if he was rusty because old guys don’t fly...He just might have a chance.
Ender Wiggin, Ender’s Game (Orson Scott Card)
Draco thought for a moment, “He takes neat notes, and does exactly as you instruct him, just give him one task at a time otherwise he will get confused.  And Harry?”
Harry had been deeply affected by the events in his vision, though he did not share everything.  Draco had seen the effect of one death, and from hints, he had gathered there had been many more.  Harry seemed to carry such a large burden on his shoulders.  How would it be like to live only to know you were meant to fight one person?  What would it be like growing up knowing you were only a means to an end?  Harry must have been so grateful to have friends, but scared for them as well.  Draco had seen how Harry had matured since his vision, it was a maturity only time could wrought.  Draco barely recognized the boy he had known these many years, the new air of authority and humility is one thing that he found to his liking.  Though Draco liked to have his own way, he preferred to follow rather than lead, in a way it was a comfort.  Harry’s natural leadership was a balm to his restless spirit.
“What I am going to say and ask may make little sense, but you will please just listen first. I know your rotation for watching the prophecy is soon Mr. Weasley.” Both men looked surprised, “I have something you will need and instructions. First,” He pulled out a small box. “There will be an attack on you while you are there. It is important Headmaster that you do not interfere with what will come,” Harry said then faced Arthur again, “Your attacker will be Voldemort’s familiar, a snake called Nagini. In that box is a bezor, take it before you start your shift, as a precaution against the venom.” Harry moved to a vial to hand to Arthur, “It is imperative you capture or stun the snake, if you immobilize it, pour this on it. It is a special potion, this must be done first. Keep the snake immobile and under the potion for at least 30 seconds,” Harry then reached for the package he pulled from his trunk, “Once the potion has sunk into the snake, you can kill it with this,” He opened the package to show a silver blade, with runes on the side, and a dark stain along the edge. “Don’t cut yourself with this, it is a Goblin made blade, on which I have added Basilisk Venom, Use this to kill the snake, and only this. Can you follow those instructions?” Harry asked.
Friday was quite, Ron was anxious as his father would be there that night. Harry pulled a package from his trunk just before dinner and would not reveal what was in it to Ron. Only that in a few weeks his father would probably tell him.
“I am not sure she knows, but she inadvertently gave me a gift that may affect her choice, though I am not sure how much.” Harry replied.
Harry looked up and his eyes were bright, his smile wistful.
"Mine...That. Is.  Who. You. Are." Harry rasped, punctuating each word with a deeper thrust.
“Just two more treatments and your legs should be good as new,” Harry said, offering her the last two vials of the potion he had created for her.
“I probably should have let you know sooner, but last month something happened.  Hermione did some research as she always does, I had a vision last month and she thinks it is because I am to be the next Augur.” Harry explained hurriedly.
The meeting was concluded, with the Headmaster formally welcoming the Malfoy’s into the fold, and an explanation that he would provide support, should anything go wrong.  He did not state who was working for him, but that he had someone on the inside that will watch and act if needed.
This was to be a lesson for the Professor though.  Harry had to show him how best to sit for the meditation that starts the wall building.  Harry transfigured a few items into large seat pillows for each of them.  Harry took a seat on the floor, and pressed his feet together out in front of him, his legs making an almost perfect diamond. He instructed the professor to follow his lead, no matter how silly it made him feel.  Snape was a bit grumpy about looking like a jellyfish that had been stunned.
He pictured the blond begging for his help.  Those silver eyes pleading with him, lips pouring out pleas.  The picture in his mind morphed from the simple begging for a potion to begging on his knees and Harry groaned at the sight.  He pressed his palm to his trousers and decided to refocus on his research instead of his darker thoughts.
Sirius let the words float over him, branding his heart, capturing his soul. He gasped again and again with the silk of that voice manipulating his body’s responses.
Harry smiled now, that was not really the past, and it wasn’t going to be the future.
The first student dropped in, holding onto their invitation.  It was Draco Malfoy.  He looked around the empty room then back at Harry and smiled.
"Remember the prophecy is the goal, If the Order arrives, leave… we will get it another way…"
“Yes, she was,” Harry stated, looking at his husband, and reaching for him.
“Yes, professor, 21 years. Can I change any of it?” Harry asked, hope sprung into his eyes, a longing was there, that Albus had not seen in a long time.
He pulled a vial from his cloak and pulled the stopper and used his wand to imbue the box with the potion.  Once the box glowed and the potion took hold, Harry noted the slight look of relief that Mrs. Malfoy exhibited.  He moved the box to his own cloak pocket.  In three weeks’ time another would be destroyed, and that would put two destroyed, two hidden.  That left the ring and the locket.  He had to wait for Mundungus to pilfer, that would ensure that Kreacher was won over. He would have to talk to Sirius to allow the home to look ‘available’ for plundering.
“I noticed you were nervous the last couple days, I figured I could try to help… Maybe another kiss...” Draco’s icy eyes were pools of mercury calling to Harry.
“Thank you, I will.” Draco stated, and both Harry and he took their seats among a throng of noise that grew around them.  Harry noted the large smiles at the Teacher’s table.  Well, not Professor Snape, but he wasn’t scowling so that meant he was pleased.  Student’s started to whisper, many furtive glances were sent their way, including Ginny Weasley.  Her glances were the most worrisome, there was something akin to fear in them.  Harry would have to talk to her separately.
Hermione decided to put her hunch to the test and decided to con Pansy Parkinson into a bet.  Pansy thought she was sure to win because hate just means hate to a Slytherin, nothing more.
“This connection, has brought us to a point where we have called a truce and have publicly become friends.  My thought was to let this cause a ‘rift’ between Mr. Malfoy and yourself Mrs. Malfoy.” She tried to speak, but Harry cut her off, “Hear me out first, then we can discuss the ‘merits’ of this strategy.  First, the duration will not be long.  Second, it is necessary for Mr. Malfoy, actually it is imperative for him to remain in the grace of Voldemort until June.  I know he is obsessed with the ministry and a prophecy.  I want everything to proceed as it was meant to until he moves on the ministry when he thinks he can get the prophesy.  If things work as they did in my vision, we can take care of things before everything can get out of hand.”
Harry nodded back towards her.
"Know what... Draco?" Harry bent over and whispered in Draco's ear.
“Very well, thank you.  And you, Po... Harry?”
Harry wanted to include Draco for this, but there was something that made him hold back the information for this task.  Harry ached having to focus on something other than Draco.  The defense club sessions were his only consolation.  There he could let his eyes drink in Draco, with the thought of their time together in the back of his mind.
Detention in Professor Snape's Office was at least cozier than the previous Occlumency lessons he had.  Harry was grateful for that. The office was clear of clutter, the bookshelves full of old tomes and the wood dark to match the darkness of the dungeons.  Sconces were lit to give the room light.
“I sent him on an errand to help Hermione.  I needed him out of the way for today.” Harry replied with a brilliant smile.
“If you ever paid attention you would see he is one of the best strategists in the last 50 years or so...or he will be… but his strategy is the best I know.” Harry said.
“That’s for me to know and you to find out. Keep it up, or if you choose the better path, stop the house rivalry, drop the loyalty to the loser who calls himself the Dark Lord, by aligning yourself with all those against him.” Harry said, his offer hung in the air like a ghost wishing for substance.
It was two days before Halloween and Harry waited patiently inside the Room of Requirements, his impervious privacy charm was imbued into the walls, no one would have any inclination of what went on, nor have the ability to gain access while he taught.  He would not allow a repeat of his vision, where Umbridge broke into the room.
So the two boys strategized, and Harry bounced a few ideas off of him.  Ron was on board with the Malfoy plan, sort of… Harry was bound not to talk directly about it, so he worded things differently.  He also discussed taking out the strategic items, and how that may affect a final battle strategy, and how best not to alarm Voldemort, that there is more going on.
Harry walked out to the common room, only to be ambushed by Hermione with a hug, and Ron looking groused.
Harry had to take deep breaths to calm himself.  He desired Draco more than he had any past girlfriend or boyfriend.  He was also second-guessing his actions.  This started out as revenge and punishment.  But the more he let himself feel with the blond, the more he realized that he wanted so much more.  Would Draco still want this after he had completed Mrs. Malfoy’s potion?  He would have to clarify some things before he did the one thing he could not take back.  A blowjob was one thing… Giving Draco his virginity was another altogether.
Later that evening, Harry made his way to the headmaster’s office.  He was still unsure of the path for the Malfoy family, but he knew that with the headmaster’s help, they could come up with a plan.
“Don’t look away,” Harry ordered.  Silver eyes were fastened on his.
“What?” Ron asked.
“Those first seven, they need to be crushed once, then sliced. They get put in first, and heated until the smoke turns blue and they are just about crisp. Then we add the liquids in the order as on the page.” Harry instructed.
Harry went rigid. Severus Snape watched his student drain of every color known to man in seconds. Those green eyes turned up looked straight at him, and then rolled into the back of his head, and Harry was falling. Severus reacted quickly reaching for the boy before his head met stone.
“I don’t understand.  My patronus never changed even after I married in my vision.  It always was the Stag you knew it to be.” Harry exclaimed rather intently.
Harry bolted out of the tower, he had to know. He ran fast, but his eyes were taking in everything, the walls, the portraits, the staircases, Hogwarts. He had one path, one direction, one hope and one fear. His eyes were filling now, tears at being back inside his head, surely that is what was happening. A hallucination maybe, he had to be dreaming. For a moment, his focus was lost, and he collided with something Large, warm, and billowy. A voice from the beyond graced his ears.
The grey of life is consuming.  Every day it eats you, the bad and the good, though there is not much good going on right now.  How can you tell if you are even alive, when you go through the motions every day.  The pain in your life is dulled by the passionless expressions you display for the world.  In that one moment, he was bleeding, blood flowing into the pool of water on the floor in the bathroom at Hogwarts.  In that moment, he was alive, and those remorseful emerald eyes captured his.  In that moment all he wanted was to be known, to be alive.  His life was full of lies, but Harry was the only truth he knew.  The magnet of his anger and the only one who could make him bleed and know that he lives.  He was saved in that moment, by the chosen one.  Saved in a way that could only be expressed, as from himself and the grey life he leads.
They swirled around him, lighting the entire room in a brilliant rainbow effect.  They stopped swirling and he held out his arms, and each rune dropped to meet his tattoos… and they lit up like florescent lights on his skin as he absorbed them.
“How is the potion working for you?” Harry asked politely.
“I… He has been good for me too.” Harry said, his eyes falling to his hands briefly before looking back up, “I would like your permission to ask him to bond with me.”
Harry felt good on his way to the hallway.  He was starting to feel more like a colleague to his teachers, instead of just a student.  And though his biological age was one of 15, he was definitely feeling more like the self that he had become.  It was strange to think of his other life as just a vision, because to him, this was like going back in time, not waking up from a dream.  Reality of now was starting to become a part of him, allowing him to feel like he belonged. Not belonging as young Harry, or as Harry from his vision, but more an acceptance of who he was because of what he is.
“Relax, just follow my lead. Like in all our other lessons.” Severus began a gentle waltz. Draco muttered the counts in Harry’s ear, steering him around in time to the music. Harry stumbled along with Draco. The last time he danced was the yule ball in his fourth year. He was abysmal then and hadn’t gotten any better since, “Look at me, not your feet.” Draco’s voice cut through his musings. Harry dragged his eyes up from his boots. He gripped Draco’s hand tighter, “Better.”
“I’ll tell the others tonight.” He gently lifted Harry’s sleeping form into his arms and moved to his feet, “I’m going to put him in his bed. See you later, Uncle.” Snape watched Draco maneuver himself and Potter back to their room, shaking his head. A soft smile crept on the corners of his lips before he turned and billowed out of the room.
“And how is he as a student?” Draco slung his arm around Harry’s shoulder.
He tucked himself on the floor with his back against one of the couches, alternating between the rest of his charms assignment and watching the plans of his temporary house unfurl. He’d just finished when Blaise came to sit on the couch beside him. Harry set his work aside, he turned to him but before he could say a word Draco climbed over the back of the couch. His long legs pressed on either side of Harry, trapping him in place.
It made it easier to pretend he wasn’t there if he had something to keep his mind and hands engaged. Harry bit his lip. Between the rustle of the brush bristles, he could hear Draco humming under his breath. Something that didn't seem to bother the man at all. But Harry was sure this was a common occurrence for Draco to work here. In the blond's posture, he could see that Draco was the same Draco he was in his common room. Unapologetically himself with a smile straining the muscles in his narrow cheeks. The Slytherin reached his hand over toward Harry without looking up from his station. Harry paused in his work to squeeze the offered hand before both boys returned to their tasks.
“It’s not a real window, but you can still smudge the glass by touching it,” Draco said in a tone that was almost gentle. Harry pulled his hand away, wrapping his arms around the top of his knees. His chin rested on the tops of his knees. Draco noted that Potter had wrapped his hand over message scrawled into his skin to hide it from him.
“Hush Potter, you had this coming,” A voice, muffled beyond recognition, sounded from behind him. Harry shuddered, straining to get a peek at his assailant. But the arms gripped him tighter, “None of that. It will be challenging for you I’m sure, but try to be on your best behavior.” Harry let out one last strangled mewled behind the hand, falling still.
Harry frowned. He shook his head hard enough to see stars. Draco frowned, prodding Harry back onto the pillow.
“What’s the matter, Harry?” Draco asked. His finger’s held Harry’s chin from turning away, “You’re safe now. You can go back to Gryffindor.” Harry’s throat tightened. He nodded, not trusting his voice, “Or is that the problem?” Another nod. Draco dropped his hold on Harry’s chin, in favor of pulling the Gryffindor into a tight hug, “Just because your colors changed again, it doesn’t mean you’ve lost us. You’re one of us, now and forever.” Leaning forward, the blond’s lips brushed against Harry’s forehead. Right beside his scar.
Harry's eyelids fluttered. A dull ache throbbed through his skull. He groaned, yanking the familiar starchy hospital wing bedding over his head. Madam Pomfrey bustled over to his bed. She tutted, dimming the lights in the room to a soft glow that wouldn't be so harsh on the Gryffindor's eyes. Two glasses of potions clinked against each other, sloshing the potions inside them. Harry gagged at their scents, swallowing down the stale air in his throat before he dared to emerge from the blankets.
"Don't go." Draco rolled his eyes. He wasn't even sure that the Gryffindor knew who he was, at all at the moment. But he couldn't stand to see him looking so pathetic. Tucking Harry's new boots and the parcel box beneath the bed, he climbed back onto the mattress with Harry. The dark-haired boy's fingers latched onto Draco's sweater, and before he knew it Potter was fast asleep. Draco sighed. He, once again, removed Harry's glasses. Stroking the boy's messy hair, Draco resigned himself to settle back into the pillows until Harry woke again.
Draco Malfoy hadn't returned home. Harry didn't blame him for it. His father was in prison and his home had been used as a headquarters for evil. It wasn't somewhere Harry ever wanted to return to either. So instead, he moped around the castle.
“Hermione would never agree to that.”
"So, it would appear." A twitching smirk crept into the corners of the blond's mouth, "How's your transfiguration?" Harry shrugged, his shoulders collapsing, "I'll take that as you're woefully out of practice." Harry nodded, his tanned cheeks flushing, "Sit." Draco's slender neck craned toward one of the courtyard benches. Harry complied with the order. It was as forceful as the blond had been since returning for eighth year, no room to argue. Harry felt a little funny anyway. Sitting didn't seem like a bad idea.
Harry bent down to pick up an abandoned stick but stopped wide-eyed as the colors of his robe shifted before his eyes. Gold and crimson replaced the silver and green. He was a Gryffindor again. He let the stick fall to the ground and kicked it, watching it rattle away. Eyes glassy again, he bent down to retrieve it when a finger tucked under his chin and dragged his gaze back up,
"I see we have different definitions of sitting quietly. But go on Potter, what is it?" He drawled in response. Harry flushed. Heat spread through his cheeks.
Draco ran his fingers through Harry's hair again, "What can I say, it's a gift. Now, get some sleep." Harry nodded. His eyes drifted closed.
Harry turned on Draco, "Why didn't we just go in through the common room?" He whined. Draco smirked, eyes twinkling in reply. He pulled him onto the stool beside him at the largest worktable, "What are we even doing?" He asked, more to the potion’s professor than his boyfriend. Snape pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Do I even want to know?” Harry asked. Draco flashed a grin back. He shook his head.
"I've had enough attempts on my life. S'hard not to hold a grudge." Draco snorted. He buried his nose into Harry's hair, taking in the honey scent of the Gryffindor's shampoo.
“Merlin, Luna what did you do to this?” Harry slammed into a chair to chase his snitch when it drifted over the table. Checkers scattered across the floor. Luna giggled. She scooped up checkers while Harry ran after the snitch.
Smirking, Harry craned his neck back toward the warmth of the person behind him,
"I'm sure it didn't mean it, Petal. Besides, I'm rather fond of the Giant Squid." Harry squirmed in Draco's hold. He turned himself around until he met the blond's gaze in the fading light, eyebrows furrowing.
“Honestly Harry, you should be more excited than anyone else that Umbridge is gone,” Hermione began while spreading jam across a piece of toast. He shrugged and picked at his breakfast. Owls swooped from overhead to deliver packages and copies of the Daily Prophet that would be splattered with stories about Umbridge, no doubt. But an unmarked letter from an owl Harry didn’t recognize fell into his lap.
Draco groaned. One of his arms stretched out, reaching for Harry. But his fingers brushed the cool, rumpled sheets on the other side of the bed. Empty. Empty for quite some time from Harry's usual radiating heat. Blinking, Draco peeled open his sleep heavy eyes. He frowned, threw the blankets back, and shivered from the sudden cold wafting over him. His toes curled against the seeping cold of the stones beneath him.
How exactly did Snape know about the ancient Hogwarts Writ of House Protection? That's what Harry wants to know. The opportunity to ask comes when Draco drags Harry to Snape's private lab to help out with some brewing. What does Harry learn when he's supposed to be sitting quietly?
“Did you seriously invoke the writ against your best friend?” Harry asked, glancing up to see every Gryffindor in the common room staring back at them. He shook his head and helped Draco to his feet.
“Go on, but if you don’t show up in the common room at least once a week for cuddles, then I’ll stage a kidnapping.” Harry groaned. He doubted that was a joke. But after a few thanks and goodbyes, he collected his charms essay and left the dungeons. Taking the steps up two at a time, he was panting by the time he reached his dorm. But the Fat Lady welcomed him back to Gryffindor and swung wide for him.
"No harm done, I suppose. You seem to be much better than you were." Harry nodded again. She turned her gaze back to the Slytherin, "You may escort Mr. Potter out for some fresh air, but ensure you return him directly after lunch." Draco flashed the woman with a winning smile. He took Harry's hand and dragged him out of the hospital wing before the woman could change her mind.
“Potter, get over here.” Draco crooked a finger toward him. Harry pushed himself up off the floor. He crossed the room to the blond boy. His eyebrows furrowed beneath the frames of his glasses. Stopping a few feet away from Draco, he batted at the snitch again, “Closer.” Draco ordered, with as much force as Harry had heard him use in a while. Harry shuffled a few steps closer, “Good, now look up.”
"It suits you," He reached forward to tuck a stray hair back to its place behind Harry's ear. Harry's ears burned a deep Gryffindor crimson. He ducked his head, running his fingers between blades of grass again. Pushing himself up, he leaned on the boulder next to Draco. Their shoulders brushed against each other. Draco snorted. Nudging Harry's shoulder, he pointed to the lake in the distance. Tentacles poked above the surface of the water and bobbed before diving back beneath the surface. Harry shivered. He resisted the urge to bury his face in his arms. Draco glanced down at Harry's changed posture, wrapping his arm around the other boy's sloping shoulders, "Hey now, don't worry. I won't let the big bad squid get you."
“I, I apologize for earlier this morning. I assumed…” He trailed off, his grey eyes flicking toward the opening. Harry shook his head.
Snape snapped back to focus, containing the brew before it splattered the room and the two of them as well.
“Good, Uncle Sev is going to be by in an hour or two to check-in and we’ll need something to show for our morning. Charms first?” He asked Blaise. The other boy nodded. While Blaise stacked up dishes and banished them, Draco dashed to their dorms and returned with his and Blaise’s school bags, “Since your stuff isn’t here yet, you can borrow parchment and the like from us.” Nodding, Harry accepted a quill from Blaise and shared ink with Draco. The trio began to work without a sound, except the rustle of parchment and the scratching of quills.
Harry snorted. He pantomimed locking his mouth and tossing the key into the depths of the lake, “I know, I know, for now, your lips are sealed, but I’m talking about later when you finally give this up.” A gust of wind wafted between the rocks. Draco felt Harry shiver and wrapped his arm tighter around to keep him warm, “We should go inside.”
"You were sneaking dough, weren't you?" She asked. Harry stuck out his chocolate speckled tongue at her. He took his mug and inhaled a deep breath. Christmas Holidays were never something he'd enjoyed before coming to Hogwarts. Too much of the Dursleys and Aunt Marge. Not enough fun. But it was different now. Though Ron and Hermione had gone home, Luna had decided to stay for the break. The two had the run of the castle, most of the other students were gone and the professors were few and far between. One other eighth year, however, was noticeably present.
“And the Writ extends all the way to the Whomping Willow?” Harry asked before he could stop himself. The man stopped in his stirring for a moment. His cool gaze turned on Harry.
Draco nodded, "Yes, I brought you something. But you can't have it until your potions are gone." He passed the glass to Harry and helped him steady it until every sip of the mixture passed his lip. Draco lifted the glass away from the Gryffindor's mouth, letting it clink against the table tray, "There you go." Draco's cool fingers brushed against Harry's forehead. Leaning into the touch, Harry's gaze swiveled from Draco's eyes to the brown paper, his green eyes dancing.
Harry set the parchment aside. The two played one round, then another. Draco muttered the occasional comment now and then that made Harry have to stifle his laughs from making the others, and a spell to rekindle the fire. Harry stayed otherwise silent, but the Slytherin found himself in awe of how much the Gryffindor could say without words at all. In the lifting of an eyebrow, the cocking of his head, and the pursing of his lips. By the end of the third game, their eyelids were drooping and the two offered each other soft smiles before reluctantly returning to their respective beds.
A piano.
He heard Draco click his tongue, then his glasses slid back onto his nose, “There you go.” Harry blinked at his reflection in the mirror. The person staring back at him didn’t look like the scruffy teenager he’d seen in the mirror for years and years. No, the person in the mirror looked like a man, “A lord.” Draco whispered in his ear like he read Harry’s mind, “So will it grow back by the morning?” He asked.
Not hard, Harry noted. None of the holds were particularly rough, just enough to keep him cooperative. Harry didn’t fight as the hand came to rest back over his mouth. He leaned back into the other’s arms hold, feeling them shift forward to support his weight. Nimble hands set him back on his feet, “Knock it off,” The voice ordered.
“Shush, or she’ll make me leave.” The Gryffindor’s expression softened. He tugged Draco’s hand away from his mouth, back under control. Harry laid his pounding head down on the pillow beside Draco. A smile fixed on his lips. Rolling his eyes, Draco tucked his arm back around Harry, “I’m fairly certain that you cheated. I wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest if you did that on purpose.” Draco muttered.
“That pink tweed-wearing wretch is seeking entry without the password.” Harry’s blood ran cold.
“I’m sorry too,” The dark-haired boy opened his mouth to continue, but before he had a chance Professor Snape strode into the common room.
Harry opened his mouth, but the snitch bolted between them. The piece of popcorn flew across the room. He shook his head.
"My apologies, I'm not trying to mock you, really." He leaned over to the flip-up part of the counter and opened it for Harry, "Come to the back room and we'll chat over some tea." Harry shuffled after Draco, his hands stuffed in his pockets. They walked through a doorway with a hanging curtain of beads. The beads swung back and forth, clacking in Harry's ears. He snatched his glasses off his nose to wipe off the fog building up into the lenses from the warmth in the room. Shoving them back on his nose, he peered around the cozy little tearoom.
Harry crossed his arms and shook his head. That wasn’t Malfoy asking for him to talk, just giving him permission. It wasn’t good enough. He used a wandless, wordless cast to summon parchment and a quill. Dropping to the stone floor, Harry wrote out a furious scribble before he shoved the page at Draco.
"You're a lucky young man, Mr. Potter. If Mr. Malfoy hadn't acted so quickly, well..." The woman trailed off. She shook her head, the white cap perched on her head flapping, "Now, up you pop and drink those. I'll be back to check on you in a few moments." Madam Pomfrey bustled off toward her supply cabinet to retrieve the bandages she needed to tend to a little Hufflepuff girl who cradled her swollen wrist. Tear stains trickled between her freckles. Harry pushed himself up, grimacing as he downed the potions one by one. He flopped back onto the pillows behind him, glancing out the windows to gauge how much time had passed.
“Would you be able to bring up another tray, so he doesn’t have to eat alone?” The elf nodded, her giant ears bobbling on her head. She smiled at Draco. Her eyes crinkled around the edges.
A flash of blond popped into view over his shoulder. Harry jumped, upsetting the board and its pieces all over the floor. Gripping his knees tighter, he snapped his head to the side to catch sight of a wide-eyed Draco Malfoy. The blond held up his hands in a peace gesture and bent down to retrieve all the swearing pieces off the floor. When they were all set right again, he turned back to Harry.
“And another, if you wouldn’t mind,” Blaise piped up. The elf nodded again. She popped out of the room and returned moments later with two more trays. Blaise moved the chessboard aside so they could share the little side table. Harry joined them at the table again with his tray, watching the rest of the house start to filter out. He stared down into his soup,
Hot breath ruffled the wiry hair around his ears, “That’s it. Nice and easy.” The muffled voice praised, before casting a quick Notice-Me-Not charm over both of them. The grip tightened around his forearm, tugging him into the hall. Blinking away the tears and dust building in his eyes, Harry stumbled down the hall in the grip of his captor.
Harry shrugged. He closed his mouth with a soft smirk. His green eyes flashed behind the lenses of his glasses. Snitching a scrap of parchment from Granger's notebook, Harry scribbled something on the paper before tossing it at Draco. The blond caught the paper between two fingers. A manicured eyebrow rose, but he unfolded the scrap and squinted to decipher Potter's horrible scrawl.
"Don't want to walk," Harry mumbled into the collar of Draco's thick jumper, "and you're warm," The Gryffindor whined. Rolling his eyes, Draco squeezed Harry's legs closer to his chest when he shivered. Draco resolved himself to spending his evening searching the Gladrags catalog for a warm jumper for Harry, perhaps a matching cap as well. He had the coupon, after all, and he just wanted to bundle him up.
Approaching slowly, Draco cleared his throat to announce his presence. Harry whirled around, the scene fading behind him back to the lake.
"Draco, this is the third time you've kidnapped me this week. It's getting old," Harry muttered. He'd found an almost balance in the last few weeks between his schoolwork, spending time with his friends, and being a better boyfriend to Draco. It didn't seem to stop the Slytherin from popping out of abandoned classrooms or between narrow library shelves. They weren't usually so public. Snorting, Draco slid his hand down Harry's arm, so their fingers intertwined. He shook his head, hair stiff from his gel.
“Other than the password changing,” Harry nudged, nestling into his side.
It was the truth. Sleep hadn’t come easy to Draco after the war. Even with Voldemort gone, the Death Eaters dismantled, and being safe behind the wards of Hogwarts the Slytherin rarely felt safe. Random noises in the common room were far from helpful. Standing up, Draco padded over to one of the tables and extracted a loose piece of parchment out of a pile of someone’s abandoned homework. He snatched up a quill and inkpot, bringing the looted supplies back over to the Gryffindor, “Your turn.”
After cooling off for an hour or two, Harry returned to the great hall. He found Draco and Luna sorting through boxes of ornaments that the elves left out for them. The snitch perched on Draco’s shoulders. It sputtered back to life when Harry walked in and twirled around his messy hair.
“Remains to be seen. So, if you’re invited to tea then eventually, you’ll have to return the favor. Let’s go over how to serve tea in a slightly more formal setting than between school companions.”
He caught the reflection of Snape sweeping back over to the table, his conversation finished. The man cuffed the back of Draco's head, having caught him in the act of snooping. Draco flushed sheepishly. He rubbed the back of his head, "Who was it, Uncle?"
“If he tries to steal me away, I’m sure you could protect me,” Harry began. He chortled before managing to say, “Or at the very least, stage a kidnapping.”
"Where we're going to go. I don't want another Christmas here or Grimmauld Place. The Weasleys are spending Christmas in Romania and Mione's going with them. And no offense but I never want to set foot in your manor ever again." Both shivered, holding each other tighter. Draco broke the silence. He slid one of his hands into his dressing gown sleeve, gripped his wand, and cast a low Accio. Moments later, they watched a piece of paper slip out from beneath the doorway of Draco's room. It flew through the hair, drifting into Draco's waiting hands.
He turned on his heel and stalked back to his bed. Tossing his blanket over his head, he tried to block out the enchanted light. Leave it to Potter to ask for his help, then act like Draco had taken him prisoner. Stewing in his thoughts, he listened for the door opening. For Potter to stop being so stubborn and come back to the room. He never did.
Harry yelped, but fingers clamped across his lips to stifle his cries. He twisted and thrashed against the hold. All he managed to do was kick up some of the layers of dust. Sputtering behind the hand, Harry’s stinging eyes watered. His potions textbook slipped from his fingers. It fell with a bang to the flagstones beneath them.
Draco Malfoy lounged on one of the couches in the common room, a book balanced on his stomach. He jumped when Harry and Luna walked into the room, his book hitting the floor with a dull thud. The blond boy didn't lean down to pick it up. He'd frozen like a frightened animal. Luna strode forward and scooped up the fallen book. She set the book back in the Slytherin's arms.
“Do you know that you’re an amazing friend, Nev?” Neville blushed at the question. He’d never really gotten used to the idea that people both noticed and
“Murder of the owner,” Potter replied, before quickly adding, “Not that I murdered the owner!”
Parents, or guardians, ought to love their children unconditionally. There is nothing that a child has to do to earn the love from their parents because
instead of Harry when he felt like shit.” With a sigh, the blond dropped his head in his hands. “I
“It’s okay to let it out, love. It’s okay to feel it.” Narcissa’s breathing was so erratic that she could barely make out the words, but the sentiment in them already felt nice. Like an anchor stopping her from completely spiraling out of control.
“Says the Slytherin who built himself an ice castle and locked the rest of the world out of it.”
Draco’s heart broke, but he didn’t let that show on his face. Instead he smiled and sat on the edge of the bed, taking the hand Scorpius was offering him and squeezing it. His fingers were icy cold. “Hi, love. How are you feeling?”
I feel like I’m taking up a lot of your time (I know you told me not to feel that but I can’t help it). I’ll end my letter here for now and go and write myself a list of things I enjoy doing, as you’ve asked. I may even write some angry letters, though it’ll be hard to pick a recipient at the minute - not because I’m angry at a lot of people, but because I’m
of it. Anger burned inside his chest as he took another step back. “I’ve raised more children than you can count.”
But tonight felt different. She couldn’t fall asleep, not even after drinking her mom’s
Once he landed in Harry’s house, the only place he knew no one would bother him, he immediately had to redirect his energy to not breaking down. Sadly, there was not enough energy in the whole world to hold him together.
“Oh, you mean, after she invited me over twice and gifted me with a cup of tea? You think that’s reason enough to just let her walk all over my son’s personal boundaries without any repercussions?” He was quite shocked by the cold edge in his voice. Usually he left the old pureblood Malfoy far away in the past were it belonged, but something about the demanding tone of Percy’s voice brought it back. “My son was uncomfortable, she didn’t listen, and then when he got upset she got angry at him, as if being a child means you have no say in how you are treated. I very much disagree with that rhetoric and I will not compromise my views on that, so no, I will not apologise, and if she doesn’t want to either then that’s her fault for causing a rift in the family and not mine.”
I hoped you guys liked this! It's short again, but i feel like the draco POV just doesn't lend itself to anything longer. Next instalment will be more than this.
“Sort of. I just don’t know why it’s still so hard for me to come back here.” Draco stared into his apple juice, willing his eyes to stay dry and failing. This pub had offered him his first decent job. It hadn’t been much, just a few shifts a week with poor tips, but it had been proper work. By the book work, with taxes and paychecks and everything. The day he got that phone call was the day he regained a little bit of hope that life just might be worth living. “I used to be so happy here. It was my safe haven.”
“I’ll remind you that Auror Malfoy isn’t five years old,
was he grateful that Harry was still at his side, ready to catch him when he briefly allowed himself to break down and sob into the man’s neck. He clutched at Harry’s back, desperate for something to hold onto, desperate to block his emotions before the flood gates were fully open and he’d turn into a giant mess. Scorpius deserved better than that.
“Decent enough to tell you my name then. That friend of yours, I mean.” Harry put his hand through his hair, messing it up even more. Draco wished he could do that for him. Give him a legit just-fucked look, instead of a naturally tousled mess. Just when his mind began to drift off to places where it really shouldn’t be yet, the band saved him by starting a good, up beat song. “Wanna dance?”
“You have?” Harry sounded even more surprised than Draco felt, and before Draco could think too much about it he pulled Harry into a hug. And then Harry whispered into his neck, “I can’t believe I have you in my life.”
“I’ll ask Mippy to send some tea over to your home, Harry.” Draco’s mother rose from her chair and walked around the table. She hugged Harry once he got up. A proper, warm, non-pureblood hug which she’d developed a knack for since the end of the war. Draco and Scorpius immediately joined in line to get one too. There was nothing quite like the hug of a mother. “Have a good shopping trip, boys.”
“Oh my God, you are such a gay disaster.” Pansy threw her hands up in desperation and then ushered him to a long, nearby table which functioned as bench for the moment. “You go sit here, I’ll get you something to drink and tell Adonis over there that you fancy the pants off of him.”
“It did?”
“I can’t imagine it’s an easy thing to tell.”
“I thought you’d never ask.”
I grew up in an environment where showing any kind of affection was not done and sometimes I need to be actively reminded of the fact that just because I know in my head that I love my friends, that does not always mean they know that too.
“No don’t you
“She was in the room when Albus floo’ed Ron.” Harry explained. “There was no stopping her when she heard what had happened.”
If you discover anything noticeable about yourself, I would love to hear about it.
I hope this was an alright update, I'm not 100% sure about it. Comments and kudos are very much appreciated<3
“I’m not brave.”
Well… after reading that I’d rendered you speechless, I read ahead to see your name. And now, well, I’m crying again. Everything in my head is screaming at me not to tell you that, but I don’t want to hide anything from you. I had an inkling that I knew you when you mentioned Pansy earlier. I didn’t imagine it would be you that I’ve been talking to. But… I’m actually quite glad it is.
, soul heart and body included, was focussed on that one thing.
“I’m not thinking too much,” Draco snapped, before catching himself and reigning in his temper. Not that he was angry, he was just a little overwhelmed. “I just… I never thought about that at all. I just never realised that I… that I don’t really care for it.”
Draco let himself get dragged away by his son after a quick smile in Harry’s direction. It turned out that the orchid really was worth all the excitement. The light blue and white petals emitted a soft, almost hypnotic glow. Draco knew that was their purpose; passing animals and humans would stop in their tracks to look, and most never left after that. It was how the orchid got its food.
Draco didn’t know how to respond to that. He didn’t know how Mrs Weasley meant it. Would she cling to her old ways because they made her feel useful, and did she expect Draco to grant her that pleasure? Or had she only just acknowledged this was the reason behind her actions, and did that mean she was willing to change?

you work harder for it. But my family will not hate you for believing and doing dumb things as a kid. They believe in second chances, and you never really had a fair first.”
“No.” To her credit, the nurse looked nothing short of gutted when she had to admit that. “We have very little experience with patients who remain in a coma for so long, so it's hard to predict anything. But his main Healer thinks that discovering solid evidence for brain activity like this is, at the very least, not a bad thing. There is still hope, Mrs Parkinson.”
still taking walks though, so don’t worry about me becoming a recluse (as tempting as it is sometimes). I like the outdoors too much to confine myself to my house. Plus, sometimes, it’s too big and empty for me to stay there.
“You’re right, I’m sorry. I-,” the words got stuck in his throat as he was overwhelmed with a feeling of
“Luna? I haven’t seen you here in a while. I thought you didn’t like the city?”
“And here I was thinking I was cute.” Harry snickered behind him. “Make up your mind, Malfoy.”
Draco bit his bottom lip and thought about that for a moment. There was one thing he’d asked before and the answer had been negative then, but maybe it was worth it to try again. “Could the Healers ask my son’s consent before they check him over? Make sure he knows what is going to happen?”
.” Draco snapped, some of the life finally seeping back into him. “You can’t reheat tea water. It’s a crime.”

“Scorpius?” Draco asked. He sat on the floor next to the couch his son was on. That way he wasn’t towering over him. “Can you tell me what happened before you asked Mrs Weasley to let you go? I promise I’m not angry, I’m just curious.”
. He thought as he quietly watched the Weasley matriarch leave. At some point in the future he would talk to her again, once his son was alright, and apologise for some of the things he’d said himself. But for now, he had more important things to focus on. Scorpius stirred in his sleep, and Draco lay down next to him again, careful not to invade his space without removing his body heat. The tea Mrs Weasley had brought as a peace offering was still cooling on the nightstand, the mugs long forgotten now.
pockets, especially not in the beginning, but at least he’d been warm and somewhat well fed. Not safe though. Never safe. Men were animals, and Draco didn’t understand how he still managed to fancy them. It was as if you lost your humanity once you were paid goods. Not a person, but a doll.
, or some entitled rubbish like that. Only when Malfoy made a move to yawn again did Harry snap out of it and answer his question, albeit a tad dishonestly.
“Can we sleep now?”
“No Potter, I read those just for fun.” That sarcastic reply earned him a confused look, which in turn made him roll his eyes. “Yes Potter, that’s why I was reading a neurology book. I have exams just after Christmas.”
“That-, that’s true,” Draco stuttered as he tried very,
“Shall I lie with you and warm you up?” Scorpius nodded and Draco was under the duvet before his son could even blink.
“Hey.”
“He’s not going to leave you over this.” Neville interrupted before Draco could go there. He truly didn’t understand how either Harry or Draco could ever think the other would leave them. Neville had never seen two people with more chemistry together. They weren’t like orchids, needing the exact right circumstances in order to grow. They were more like grass, everywhere, inevitable to turn up on every patch of land no matter how barren or battered.
“I have to hold it back.” Harry said way too soon for Draco’s liking. He was clearly fighting his tears with all he had. “I can’t break down every time Lily asks me where her granddad is, or when James can’t find anyone to play that stupid hungry hungry hippo game with.”
Out of all the things Draco could have expected Harry to say, this one hadn’t been on the list. It might have been something that passed through his mind in the early days, back when being locked away in the Manor became too much, when he’d still had enough of an attitude to feel sorry for himself.
“Neville couldn’t kill me, he wouldn’t hurt a fly, least of all a weed.
Harry,
“I’ll get right to it, then.” The Healer clasped his hands together after sitting down, and looked at Draco over the edge of his gold rimmed glasses. He looked older than the world itself, though he’d always talked and acted with an amount of energy that made Draco jealous. Often just being near the man made him feel even more exhausted. “As you know, his curse is a nasty piece of work. We thought we had it under control and cut off from all energy supplies, and all of our check ups backed that up, but somehow the magic acted faster than we thought it could. Somewhere in the last couple of days the curse latched onto the natural magic of your son and fed on it until it was powerful enough to resurface. We’re trying everything we can right now to once again cut it off from any kind of magical energy, but it’s a tricky surgery given how potent your son’s natural magic is. Which is why, as we speak, my colleagues are trying to lull Scorpius’ magic to sleep.”
Harry
“Relax a little and accept that you’re raising him to be a good kid and that you don’t have to stress that much about him?”
“Scorpius.” Scorpius flinched at the harsh tone in Draco’s voice, so Draco cursed himself and tried again. The harshness hadn’t been aimed at his son at all, which meant he should keep it well away from him. “Scorpius, can you look at me?”
Percy’s voice became white noise somewhere in the back of his mind as his words began to sink in. Scorpius would never wish for Mrs Weasley to be his mother. He would wish for Astoria, for his actual mother. Draco did the same. Not a day went by when he didn’t wish that blood curse had never been cast. But wishes didn’t come true. Draco had seen enough shit in life to know that.
“I love Harry, you know? But he’s about as delicate as a brick wall. And I don’t-, I mean, you know this side of me. He doesn’t. I don’t want him to-”
, who are you, that’s what I meant.”
Scorpius didn’t respond for a very long time, but Draco waited patiently until he was willing to look up.
I must admit I have begun to look forward to your letters.
“I just hope it will help. The first year after losing someone is always the hardest.” Draco sniffed a bit himself. Harry took the books from him, added some extra copies from the piles on the table and put way more money than he owed in the charity box. Some things never changed. Just before he left, Draco grabbed his hand and squeezed it. “I’m sorry for your loss, Harry.”
Neville laughed. He couldn’t help it. After soaking his entire pyjama with tears, the first thing Draco Posh Git Malfoy asked in between sobs was about
So, I want you to examine your own behaviour a bit this week, only gently, one thing at a time, baby steps, not because I think you cannot handle more, but because doing more is incredibly dangerous and risky. Just take one thing at a time, think about what you do, why you do it, put it in the context of our current peace and see if it still makes sense there. If it does not, then maybe it is time to change them. Not radical changes, but gradual ones.
, but it would be nice if they actually were genuine. Draco had never properly dated anyone before. He couldn’t say he had close friends either. He’d tried to reconnect with Pansy and Blaise but after everything that had happened it just didn’t work out. He’d changed too much. And his colleagues liked him alright, but it wasn’t really anything proper.
badly, but it never worked. You’re too nice.”
“What is?”
But in the end, all the Healers and experts and potion masters had managed to heal Scorpius with the aid of his son’s powerful, unharnessed natural magic. Finally Draco could take his son home, only to find he was a shadow of his previous self. Scorpius had nightmares, he’d gotten touch shy, he hated strangers so much that just seeing one at the other end of the garden sometimes made him burst into tears.
“But what if I keep growing away from people?” Harry lifted his head and looked Draco straight in the eye. The insecurity behind those green eyes was painful to watch, but Draco refused to look away. He didn’t want to send the wrong message. “What if I grow away from you?”
“Thank you Mrs. Malfoy.” Harry nodded politely.
“Fuck school,” Victoire muttered, sounding both fierce and tired. She was holding Teddy’s hand, Ginny noticed when she looked down. And when Teddy let out another sob, she patiently pulled him into her arms. “Family is more important.”
Draco smiled in reply and obeyed Harry’s words. He didn’t think he could speak right now and he wasn’t keen on trying. Harry’s friends seemed to take his silence as a sign of nervousness about meeting them all again and left him alone for the most part. He didn’t know if that was better or worse, because it just made him realise that he hadn’t even thought about being nervous to see them. There were too many other things on his mind.
It will not change the truly dark parts, but bit by bit, what first seemed like a big black hole, will start to get some patches of grey, and here and there maybe even a dash of pink. The way you experience life and your past right now, the way you see your future, is not set in stone. It is a marvellous story filled with so many details it would take multiple lifetimes to have a look at it all and yet you experience all of that in just one life.
Comments and kudos are always welcome!
And then he leaned all the way down, and kissed Draco’s cold lips.
Molly took a step closer, fuming as she kept swaying with her ladle. “And so is raising picky spoiled brats!”
“I heard Mrs Weasley watches them regularly too.”
“No, Scorpius. I am never mad at you.” Draco actively had to stop himself from pulling his son close and kissing his forehead, because he knew that especially in situations like this, he should let Scorpius come to him or just leave him alone. The little guy felt shit enough already, he shouldn’t add to that. “I just hope you’ll get better soon because I want you to feel healthy and happy, okay? But I’m never mad.”
“How do I know if there’s something wrong with my normal?”
“Yes, you may, Scorpius.” He held out a hand. “Shall I join you on your quest to the kitchen?”
“I know.”
Harry threw his head back and laughed. Draco soon joined him. Scorpius had been quite the sight when he’d come back from the Granger-Weasleys. According to Hermione, Ron was still removing glitter from behind his ears two weeks later.
As for the attack you described, I had to take a step back when I read that. I am myself a gay man, and I have been attacked like that, albeit sans partner. I have some very specific and personal tips because of that, namely, if you ever find yourself as a witness again, call the police, stay close to the attack without putting yourself in danger, do not try to stop the attack if you know you will never win that fight, and (especially if things get really out of hand and police are far away) try to persuade the people around you to step in together. More often than not, people want to do something, they just do not want to take that first step.
“Oh, the city is very likable, Harry. That’s the problem. The countryside needs more looking after.” Luna smiled at him and hopped onto the counter. “You want to look after someone too, Ginny told me. He’s in quite a worse state than the countryside, I found .”
“Looking for some peace and quiet, which I apparently won’t get here.” Malfoy glared at him, a look made a bit less impressive by the ginormous bags under his eyes. Being a coffee shop owner meant he saw his fair share of exhaustion, not to mention all the experience he’d had with Hermione, but this was taking it to the next level.

it for some reason. Liked
Draco bit his tongue and cursed himself. Why was talking so difficult? And why couldn’t he leave his bloody arrogance at the door? He thought he’d lost it when his father kicked him out for ‘disagreeing with the family traditions’, but apparently not.
Potter caught his gaze, eyes looking horribly sincere. “No. It’s because the Ministry was unfair to you and Hogwarts failed you when it mattered the most.”
When his son nearly fell face first into his dessert, Draco carefully suggested an early night.
He was still scared what Harry would say if he found out about his past though. Not the fact that he was a Death Eater, but everything that came after that. It was easy to take advantage of a teenage boy kicked out onto the streets, especially when he knew nothing about muggles.
But despite the comfort, he still jolted out of bed when he woke up and realised he was an hour late for his next shift already. He ran downstairs, stuffing his arms in his Healer robes while hoping that he still had a banana left to serve as quick breakfast.
“It was supposed to get better,” Harry whispered. “He’d started twitching, they detected brain activity, he was supposed to get
, Draco Malfoy, depressed widower and father of a troubled five-year-old, to be his boyfriend. But Harry had said something else. Something more.
“Draco, look at me.” Harry suddenly sounded a lot more serious and stern. “Your son is in surgery, he’s getting the best of care and as soon as he gets out of there and wakes up, he’s going to want to see his father. And he doesn’t want to see this father, hyperventilating in a hospital hallway with tears on your face. He’s going to need a rock, and he’ll need
With a soft click, the recording stopped. Neville couldn’t suppress a shudder. He knew Draco found himself horribly useless when his mental health got bad, but those words hadn’t sounded useless. They never did.
Of course emotions do not easily listen to reason, but you can shape them to be more useful to you. Take that anger and put it in a fiery speech to change people’s minds, instead of using it to defend those who were hurt with force, as that will only lead them and you into deeper trouble. Use the anger not to yank at the branches, but stick a spade in the roots.
, there was
want my kids to feel that way.”
“If your grandmother says so, then I guess we are.” Draco said carefully as he watched Harry. He could have dropped the care, because the most brilliant smile appeared on Harry’s face. So far they’d only slept with three in one bed after Scorpius had a nightmare, they’d never started out like that. But Harry was clearly just as excited about the idea as Scorpius was. “Alright, Scorp. Let’s get you into bed then.”
Luckily, or unluckily, depending how you looked at it, Draco had his looks and accent working for him. He was worth money. Money that didn’t end up in
Harry James Potter
. Draco had fought
“Hey.” Draco thought Harry had taken longer than necessary for breakfast to grant him some more time, and he was very grateful for that. And now he was even more grateful for the luscious breakfast that Harry carried, much better than the mushy old banana Draco had hoped for while sprinting to the kitchen. “I bring food, and a lazy arse that would very much like to join you in bed, if you let me.”
That does not, however, take away the fact that I am no longer your therapist, no matter how much I might still sound like it. That is just my standard way of ranting these days. With our shared past, I cannot offer you that help. If you want to get some good, proper help, and for the love of Merlin, Potter, please tell me that you do, you need to be able to talk freely about everything in your life. Even if that is about how annoying your ginger friend can be sometimes, or why that stupid blond git always tried to ruin your life back in school.
“Your brain is a chemical mess right now, it needs help to recover.” Neville carefully pushed on when Draco didn’t immediately reject the idea. “You’d go to a Healer if you broke your legs. You’d get glasses when your eyes are shit. Why should getting help for your mental health be any different?”
I am glad to hear you’re looking forward to these letters, it is very good to know you are able to do that. I personally struggled for years to look forward to anything, back when my depression was at its worst, and ever since I have grown to appreciate excitement a lot more.
Draco sighed as he opened a second tub of ice cream. Harry had known how busy he would be; Draco had even told him to bugger off and find someone who actually had time for him, but Harry wouldn’t hear it. And when Draco had told him he lacked the energy for dating a few weeks after that last evening, he’d been so bloody
Maybe he was a decent public hero, but to the people close to him, the ones that really mattered, he just brought pain. Every time he watched Molly’s silent tears, the cries of Mrs Malfoy or Ron trying to keep it together with all his might while Luna seemed completely lost in dark thoughts, he knew it was all his fault.
. I didn’t know he knew. Didn’t know he’d grown so bitter. He was my
Test results and a detailed analysis from the operation came in the next day, just after Harry was done massaging the knots out of Draco’s back. Scorpius had looked a bit better in the morning, but Draco didn’t dare get his hopes up. He knew the horrible relapses from the blood curse like no other.
“Fine, I’ll eat,” Draco grumbled and sat up, though he couldn’t fake being pissed off anymore when he saw the deliciousness that was Harry’s fry up. Albus came into the room when he was halfway through and he was soon followed by James and Lily. Draco was just beginning to wonder why Harry wasn’t there yet when he poked his messy head around the door.
But Draco was in no state to rant now, Teddy saw as they quietly went to stand besides aunt Hermione and Pansy. The women noticed them, but stayed quiet. All four were too absorbed by the sight behind the glass. Seeing Draco lie there, between Harry and Narcissa, suddenly reminded Teddy of how young he was. Only thirty one. A lot compared to fourteen, but nothing in the grand scheme of things. Despite the ashy grey look of his skin Draco looked so very young. The sight reminded him of the few pictures he still had of his mother. Of what he imagined she’d looked like after her death.
Potter was taken aback by his honesty, and looked even sadder than Draco felt. It was rather strange, given that they’d only just seen each other again after nearly seven years. There was no reason for Potter to be so invested in his well being. Draco himself didn’t care that much, not even on good days.
Scorpius was a bit drowsy from the cake and the excitement from before, but Draco didn’t want to put off talking about the fight any longer. He knew himself, he would chicken out of it if he waited any longer. And as his own childhood had been full of unexplained fights between adults, he knew how frustrating that was. Plus, he needed to make sure Scorpius wasn’t blaming himself for anything.
when I’m with people. With you.” Draco stopped hugging his knees for a moment and massaged his toes, never once meeting Neville’s eye. “It’s easier, coming to you. You’re so… Warm. I can’t… I can’t fall apart like that around you. You’d… I don’t know.”
The room was quiet. His face felt like it was on fire. Then McLaggen roared, laughing at him, saying ‘
Draco huffed. “I didn’t know they hired walking, talking bird’s nests as baristas these days.”
“You’re an
Your feelings of anger about how dark your past has been are very understandable and valid, though I do hope you do not drown in them. Everyone reacts in their own way, and I know too many people who got angry at the world and locked everyone out, while others got angry at specific people and did very foolish things, while I personally turned my anger on myself, which can get nasty really fast.
“Anything for you.” Harry kissed him again, properly this time. “Anything to make this the best Halloween I can give you.”
now. Why is that so hard for you to believe?”
Draco let out an awkward chuckle. “How very Gryffindor of you.”
“Don’t worry, Rudolph,” he chuckled, softly booping Draco’s nose. It was sad, really, that Draco didn’t have anyone but him to drag him back to bed when he was sick. The once so popular Malfoy heir was quite alone now, and Harry couldn’t stand it. Too many Christmases he’d been left in his cupboard begging for scraps. No one deserved that, whether they had someone terrorising them or if they terrorised themselves. “I’ll make you part of my pack if the other reindeer won’t have you.”
I haven’t had anybody to share a bed with in a long time. I know what you mean about having someone there when you wake up. It’s one of the things I miss about school - not that I was sharing beds with anyone there, but being in a dormitory meant there was always someone there the next morning. Are you still not allowed to sleep alone? (sorry, that might have been too personal a question - feel free to ignore it!)
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded. “I talked to Molly about what happened. Explained a bit of your situation and all that. And maybe I cornered her, maybe she was still angry, I don’t know, but she said it was no excuse. Children had to listen to their parents and that’s that. Even if the parent isn’t actually their parent but just a grown up. It’s what kids are supposed to do.”
spend the rest of his life trying to make up for past mistakes, trying to become someone else, someone better. There was a reason why he hadn’t joined his mother in France, started a Potion’s degree, and left everything behind. He had to prove to himself more than anyone else, that he could change, that he could be a good person even after royally fucking up.
Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to do it again, even if it was for the second time.
Before Neville had time to reply to that, there was
Apparently that was not the right thing to say, because Draco then put his arms around Harry’s neck while his coughing fit slowly turned into crying. Confused and cursing himself for being such a poor host, Harry held him there, rubbing slow circles on his back.
“Of course,” Draco replied. Harry squeezed his hand one more time before exiting the room, leaving Draco alone with his son. Draco turned his face towards him, studying his skin, his bluish lips, his slowly moving chest. He thought of last time this had happened, the unexpected symptoms of the curse, the many healers constantly prodding and poking his son as if he was some sort of doll….
“Do you-, do you still feel like that now?” Neville asked tentatively. He wasn’t really sure what to say to his friend, what he could do to make him feel okay again. Even though a lot of his friends struggled in some way or another, he’d never learned how to handle this. Usually a hug, a listening ear and some strong tea did the trick but this sounded bigger, scarier. He didn’t know what he would do if he ever lost Draco.
“I’ve never found it to be very healthy to live for others instead of yourself,” he said eventually, when the silence became unbearable for him. “Your self worth shouldn’t be determined by what other people need from you. Even as a parent.”
Draco finally sat up when he heard that. He looked down at the man in his bed with wonder. Looked at his badly trimmed beard, his lively green eyes, the serious expression on his face,
But Draco refused to listen to Neville when he brought up therapy, sometimes even flat out leaving until exhaustion drove him back. Eventually, Neville stopped asking. Not because he gave up, or because he stopped trying, but because he could see that the reason why Draco didn’t want any help was because it was imbedded in his brain that his nightmares were his own fault, and someone as proud as a Malfoy would never ask for help to fix their own mistakes. The cause of Draco’s problems was exactly the reason why he needed therapy, but also the reason why he refused to go.
That last one took his by surprise when the words came across his lips. He hadn’t known how true that was until he said it. But the longing for that quiet life was soon overtaken by the overwhelming worry that he’d never get to have that. That Draco wouldn’t pull through, wouldn’t wake up, wouldn’t ever be able to look Harry in the eye again, would never again hold him close and sing him to sleep and tell him everything was going to be alright.
“You protected your son. I might have done worse in your position.” Harry pushed a stray strand of hair out of his face, before quietly rubbing circles on his back again. They sat like that in the quiet of the guest bedroom for a few minutes before Harry spoke again.
She’d known he would pull through only an hour after arriving at the hospital then though. Quite different from what was happening now. Though her perception of time was a bit off, she knew she must have been waiting for at least five days now. A long time anyway.
“I want to have a family with you Draco.” His voice was somewhat functional again, but only because he’d ran out of tears. “I want to take you out on dates, walk in the park, kiss you goodmorning and goodnight,
Harry, more so now that he heard his voice. He was pretty sure more tears wrestled their way out of his eyes as he curled in on himself.
But Draco’s medical condition, no matter how important, wasn’t what was on his mind right now. He had heard Pansy’s rant through the glass, had heard her accusations and anger, and he knew that none of it was misplaced, and none of it was a lie. He was a worthless boyfriend.
“Of course I watched
“It’s okay,” Draco reassured, more to himself than to Harry. Worrying about his fight with the Weasley Matriarch was the last thing he needed right now. “I’m glad that there is someone responsible around for the kids. Not that you aren’t-,”
Draco let out a low groan as response. It was probably too much to ask for a coherent reply, with the nightmare and the crying and Harry not being able to keep his trap shut and all. So he let Draco rest on him, bribed him with soft words and back rubs to take his potions and soup and lay him down again when he refused to eat any more.
“Much appreciated, Harry Potter.”
The other side of the bed was empty and cold when Draco woke up the next morning. He hated it when that happened, especially right now, because it was bloody cold outside and since Harry was a living and breathing furnace, he had never bothered with any kind of heating charms on his bedroom. Draco suspected he even left the window open a crack.
“That’s not entirely true.” Draco could be wrong, but he thought he heard a small smile in Harry’s voice. “I hit you during that quidditch match in fifth year.”
That, and if she were to drop everything and sit at Draco’s bedside, there was no denying anymore that she could be well on her way to losing one of her best friends. She was a bit more mature than her husband and very much not ashamed to admit to how much she liked Draco. To this day she had yet to meet a better debate partner. What Draco was with chess to Ron, he was with discussions to her. Losing that, never having her usual lunch break with him anymore, the one thing to keep her sane in hectic weeks, would mean the end. For years she’d been stretching herself to the limit and then some and the blow of losing Draco…
Draco guessed that the man in his arms had tried to be strong for everybody else, and in turn people forgot he was hurting too. It was a role older siblings often played. Hide your pain to keep the family together.
(See the end of the chapter for
Her entire mind, or rather her entire
“Come on, Draco.”
Draco had stepped around the table before Harry broke down because he had already seen the inevitable in his eyes. It wasn’t all that rare in his line of work. But what did surprise him was how Harry melted into his hug like he’d been starved for that kind of touch.
“But you have to wake up first, darling.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hand. New tears had found their way onto his cheeks. He didn’t bother wiping them away. “Wake up, Draco. Please.”
Potter’s face went from annoyed to interested. “You’re a student? Is that why you had that neurology book on you the last time we met?”
“I know.” Draco nestled himself besides Harry and pulled him into a hug. The man was clearly upset, as he always was when talking about his childhood, and Draco wanted nothing more than to comfort him. It had been a strange feeling at first, because Astoria had rarely needed comfort and when she did it had been for entirely different reasons. But it wasn’t a bad feeling. He quite liked making Harry feel safe and loved when life got him down. “Hey, you don’t have to explain or defend yourself to me. I’m the one who asks before even holding Scorp’s hand, I would
Neville took a deep breath, placing his hands on the cool kitchen counter while he closed his eyes. It was alright, Draco had come to him, he hadn’t done anything stupid. Plus, he had Harry and Luna and plenty of other people around him. It was going to be alright.
Hello Harry,
“I’d actually quite like some toast,” Draco muttered after recovering from the idea that
I’ve started keeping a journal so I can write in that in between sending you letters. I’ve been writing random thoughts down, as well as memories - good and bad - and I think it is helping. I feel… lighter.
Now Uncle Harry frowned, confused, but at least he wasn’t crying anymore. “What do you mean? I thought you were my princess?”
“Yes, please.” Draco was too eager getting up and nearly fell in Harry’s arms. Lucky for him, his years worth of etiquette classes and love for dance saved him now. Dancing was something he could do. Now he just had to learn how to do Harry. How to talk to him, kiss him, date him, make sweet, sweet love to him. But first, they would dance.
“I might be depressed guys, but I do still enjoy breathing.” Both he and Harry were shaken out of their moment when the muffled voice of Draco rose between them. Quickly, Neville moved away, but Harry stopped him from going very far as Draco resettled between them.
“Alright Harry, we’ll ask.” Hermione reached out to him and squeezed his arm. “But try not to let this consume you, okay? You have a job you love now, there’s no need to try and ignore all the problems you have in life by obsessing over him.”
“How can you know that?” Draco asked, finally bringing some variation to his whispered pleas.
After about half an hour of waiting, his mother arrived at the hospital, delivering some much needed pyjamas and Scorpius’ well loved stuffed niffler. She also brought a firm hug and some comforting words, though she refused to stay in the room and wait with them when Draco asked her. “Scorpius doesn’t need three people at his bedside, it’ll only overwhelm the little man. Plus, I have other things to do. Scorpius will do just fine with just his dads in the room.”
She had only broken down like this once before, after being forced to watch Fenrir enter her son’s room. Back then, her sister Bella had soon tired of her screeching and
there. No shaped, no curves, and definitely no bends.
Draco groaned and buried himself under the duvet as his mother left the room with a wink, Scorpius following close behind. He couldn’t believe she’d just done that. His own mother! The most saintly, strong, serene woman in his life, his brick, his anchor, the one person he could always trust and rely on had just-! Just-!
Draco sighed. He didn’t know why he’d agreed to this. It wasn’t fun to be at a party where half the guests hate you. But if he’d stayed up in his dorm, Harry would have dragged him downstairs halfway through anyway, and he had a hard time saying no to those puppy eyes. Damn Potter and his cute antics.
was the one who made that request first. You cannot just steal my question, Potter, that is not how it works. Honestly, you would think the Saviour of the Magical world had more than two brain cells, but maybe I should not have expected that given that fact that you only seem to know a single duelling spell.
“I know.” Teddy took her hand. “And I’m sorry. Now lets catch a bus.”
ever could.
But it is like the demons from inside my mind started to occupy the once untainted rooms, furniture and hallways of that house. Each corner had a memory of a panic attack, each pattern on the wall had been followed endlessly by my eyes as I was forced to stay awake after a nightmare.
Rose beamed and turned around to share the moment with her dad, but the rest of the room was empty. It was just her, Uncle Harry and the Princess. So, she fiddled with her sleeve as she waited for her godfather to make a move. Harry gently brushed the hair out of the Princess’ face, just like a fairytale prince would do.
“Harry, I had a panic attack in front of your kids.” Draco cast a discreet silencing charm around his son’s head so their talking wouldn’t accidentally wake him up. “I was hyperventilating and I’m pretty sure I smashed a vial of calming draught on the floor when a nurse tried to calm me down. That must have been terrifying for them. I’m not joking when I say I’m sorry.”
“And I appreciate it, Harry, but I can’t do that,” Draco replied, lowering his voice until it was almost a whisper. “This is-,
Ten minutes later, his mattress dipped. Two strong arms pulled him against a warm chest before he could really register what was going on.
“If-, if you want to be together, that is.”
I'm so sorry that this is so short! But I will try my best to make the next chapter extra long as compensation. It's already written for the most part, so hopefully the wait won't be too long. Anyhow, thank you so much for supporting this fic so far! I love you guys
“Yes, Mother. We did,” he answered as politely as possible. His mother could smell blood ten miles away, and he didn’t want to let her in on the nature of his lie-in. Hopefully she would assume they did what she implied they should do. It was odd to want his mother to think he’d had sex, but the conversation from that morning with Harry had left him so shaken that he really wasn’t ready yet to face a discussion about it with his mother. “Pass me the jam, will you?”
longer than he’d been alive, though he no longer really knew what being alive meant. Not this. He knew it wasn’t this. Everything was terribly blank, not white, just blank. No colour, no light, no darkness, just nothing. It scared him when he tried to think about it, so he mostly avoided it. The only problem was, that apart from the lack of
The thought alone made her shudder. It wasn’t a new fear for her. She’d been scared of that even since before she first caught him slashing open his own skin as some sort of sick punishment for choices that hadn’t even been his. The self-loathing he had dealt with before, during and especially after the war, had been of a magnitude that she was sometimes still surprised that Draco had survived it all. Dating Potter had helped a great deal. If that hadn’t happened, Pansy would have never taken on her current job because she would never leave her best friend in less than capable hands.
All of those things were reasons Kingsley was striding through the halls of St Mungo’s right now, praying Malfoy would be alright. Things weren’t looking promising if the man had been in a coma for three weeks now, but stranger things had happened. Especially around Harry Potter. There might still be hope left.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You really called me a stupid pointy git?”
into each other, being nothing if not soft and sappy together. “And you're an amazing father to him.”
“Hey, hey, stay with me, you idiot.” Draco turned around in his arms and cupped his face in his hands. “I’m telling you because I
The silent question hung in the air, apparently too painful to get over Draco’s lips.
if that wasn’t a depressing thing to know.
“I did not stalk him! And I do
Harry’s voice was softer than a whisper when he spoke again. “I pushed Ginny away.”
She vividly remembered the day she’d entered his room only to find several empty liquor bottles and a close to death son in there. He’d used his father’s favorite whiskey. Not because he wanted to end it, but because once he’d started he couldn’t find it in himself to stop. Everything had become too much to bear and he knew the alcohol could take it all away.
Draco was fighting, struggling, doing
“Oh, stop trying to dig yourself out of a hole, Potter. It’s not your strong suit.” Draco shook his head, balling up his frustration at his life and filing it away for later. It technically wasn’t Potter’s fault that he was lonely, even if the man did keep making him painfully aware of the fact. He ignored Potter’s invitation, it probably wasn’t sincere anyway. “I know why I’m alone during the holidays and it’s not because I’m busy with exams.”
“I can’t imagine Malfoy ever taking the tube,” Ron said jokingly when no one else made a move to break the heavy silence. “When I first went to the underground with Neville he just sat down on a bench and expected it to move!”
“Have you met Ron recently?” Harry looked as if he couldn’t believe Draco would doubt that. “He loves Scorpius to bits. Plus, I know for a fact he thinks you’re a great father, even though he would never say so to your face. He’ll have the food ready before you can say the word
pine, thank you very much. And I didn’t nag you.” That last remark got him a death glare from Hermione so strong he physically cowered away. “Okay, maybe I nagged a little. But the ministry was being unreasonable! You can’t just lock a teenager away in a house of nightmares for four years after basically admitting that he’d never voluntarily committed a crime. That’s not fair.”
“Yes.” Draco beckoned for Harry to come closer, before he turned back to Scorpius. “Can I give you a hug?”
But anyway, it didn’t matter what any of them thought. He was going to break out and see Draco and he was going to do so right now. Or at least right after he talked himself into getting on the broom he’d nicked from the shed near the quidditch dressing rooms. He wasn’t that much of a flyer, if he was being honest.
. No wonder your son is acting like a spoilt little brat when his father never changed a hair.”
i hope you guys liked that! also yes i named kingsley's husband after Kevin, the husband of Captain Holt from brooklyn 99. i hope some of you could appreciate that lol. Thank you for reading so far<3
“I got you a beer.” Pansy’s tone was completely neutral when she finally got back to him. His stomach sank. Of course he hadn’t been interested. He didn’t know why he’d gotten his hopes up, life didn’t treat him that way. “And a phone number.”
“Because he’s a fighter, that son of yours.” Harry squeezed his shoulders, trying to get him to look at him. Draco stubbornly kept his face in the crook of Harry’s neck though. He didn’t want to face the world, he didn’t want all of this to happen again, he didn’t want to lose his son.
again.
It is certainly a good choice to tell me who you are if you think that would ease or even erase your anxiety about talking to me, although even if I would be able to guess from your information who you are, I would never use that against you or assume things about you that I know from outside of this letter exchange. It is part of my job not to do that, and I feel like it would be rude to you if I broke that rule.
“I’m sure it is, Draco.” Neville pushed his insecurities aside and focussed fully on his friend again. More specifically, on making him some tea. “Earl Grey or Darjeeling?”
“But you still don't know if he'll wake up,” the Indonesian woman cut in before Kingsley could even think of the words.
Er, hi,
Both he and his mother attended several classes on therapy for kids in addition to their own private therapy, doing everything they could to help Scorpius recover. And it worked, in part. Scorpius got over his nightmares, though he still slept in Draco’s or his gran’s bed. He became more relaxed around strangers again, as long as they were kind, introduced themselves, and never raised their voice. And when he met the Potter kids, he’d started to have fun again. Or at least, he did the second time he met them. The first time James had been way too over enthusiastic and Scorpius had ended up yelling at James before hiding behind the couch.
Draco wanted to freeze this moment in time and never stop sleeping. The bed was warm and soft and he had a Harry on one side and a Scorpius on the other. There wasn’t a single thing he could change to make his morning more perfect. Well, except for taking away the horrible prospect of needing to get out of bed and face the world later. He could do without that.
so this update took longer and the next one isnt written yet bc my current uni period is 100% crazy insane busy. i barely have time to breathe. I am still continuing this fic, but it's going to be hard to find a moment for writing so it might take a bit longer again. Sorry for that!
“Could I maybe have the name of the tea? The flavour, I mean,” Harry spluttered. “I-, eh, I was actually meant to go shopping yesterday evening, my pantry is empty and the kids are coming to stay with me for a week this afternoon.”
had been the reckless one.
. It was… I was walking quite late at night - walking helps me cope if I’m having a bad day. A walk always calms me down. I was in town, walking past all the Muggle nightclubs and pubs. I’m not a big drinker, but being around people who are has never bothered me. I like to walk through the area when it’s busy, there’s always a good atmosphere.
. “I’m bi Harry.”
. Somehow he managed to work the job unnoticed by his landlord slash boss. After that, things began to look up. He found cheaper lodgings, more pubs who needed staff, and this time when he quit, he didn’t have to look back ever again.
Added to that, I suppose it brought back memories of innocent people being targeted during the war just because of their blood status. I’m not pureblood, but I’m not Muggleborn either, so I was never a target in that sense. But seeing others who I considered friends persecuted was hard. Not being able to speak up for them without being afraid of retribution was harder. Not that I was really afraid, but I had to be careful. My head of house warned me multiple times. I sometimes had trouble listening.
“Your mother told me where you were.” Draco was so far gone in his panic attack he didn’t even hear Harry’s words, nor did he notice that he had climbed onto the bed. “Oh Draco, don’t do this to yourself.”
“Don’t let your breakfast get cold, Dad. Harry said you had to eat all of it because you are too skinny.”
“Shut! Up! Harry!” Draco abruptly sat up, grabbed a pillow and began to beat Harry’s laughing form with it. “It’s! Not! Funny!” he said as he emphasised every word with a blow. “I’m traumatized for life! I will never have sex again now that she said that!”

I would really like to stop taking the Dreamless Sleep. I don’t remember the last time I had a nice dream (I imagine it was some time before fifth year). I think there’s some truth to activity before bed helping with sleep. I never had trouble sleeping after Quidditch practice at school. Perhaps I’ll try going for a little jog around the park near my house some time. I quite like the sound of a white noise machine - silence allows my thoughts to take over, which I suppose is why I take the Dreamless Sleep. My street is surprisingly quiet at night.
work, that
“He’s twitching.” Pansy replied, her voice hoarse and soft. “He’s been doing that for two hours now.”
“That implies that you would be the idiot if I weren’t, and I won’t stand for that, Potter.” Draco knew he was refusing to admit Harry’s point, but he was already such a mess with everything going on that he didn’t need this adding to it. Not that he didn’t feel his heart grow three sizes when Harry said that. “I just hope we’ll keep-, we’ll keep-”
Despite what Draco had wished, Harry still stood up for him then. Draco didn’t really take notice though. He kept staring at a stain in the carpet, letting the sounds of his fellow students wash over him as time went on.
“No,” Draco said resolutely as he turned his back on Harry and crawled deeper into the impossibly comfortable bed. “Now fuck off. I hate you.”
The sound of her own clicking heels in the hospital hallways irritated her so much she actually took them off and walked to Draco’s room barefoot. She was too late, way too late. She knew that. Running
Worried, she quickened her pace and passed the sleeping form of her wife on the waiting room couch in favour of seeing what was going on. So far she’d never really thought all that much about Malfoy’s condition. Weeds were hard to kill, he’d be alright soon enough. But in the hectics of her training schedule she’d lost track of time, and with a shock, she realised Malfoy had been in a coma for nearly three weeks now. That, together with the crying and the presence of the ever busy businesswoman Pansy Parkinson, did not bode well.
At least his mother didn’t say things like that. If she believed he deserved something she made sure he got it instead of talking to him. It was how their dynamic worked and why he loved spending time with her so much. Without her, he’d be utterly lost.
Harry hated every last detail of it.
have changed so much since then.”
“We’re messed up, aren’t we?” Harry asked as he nestled himself on Draco’s chest.
“Can I come in?” George knocked on the door frame, getting the attention from a very defeated looking Harry. He’d never seen him this lost before; not even after the war.
And then Draco was crying again, trying to cover his eyes while quietly leaning into Neville. Neville welcomed him with open arms, glad he was bigger than Draco so he could properly wrap him up in a bear hug. His figure used to be a source of shame for him, but now he was slowly starting to like it because everyone else did too.
Neville frowned. “But-”
!” Percy bellowed so loudly Draco wouldn’t be surprised if they’d get kicked out of the shop soon. He was getting redder in the face than Ron did when people talked about their sex lives within earshot. “She’s amazing and would be the best mother your son could wish for. You’re really blind if you…”
our idiot, though,” he sobbed, suddenly overcome by emotions; his bubble had burst.
Harry told himself no lies, Draco was amazing with kids, much more than he was. Especially when they were young. After just one night of babysitting, Ron and Hermione only flooed Harry to ask if he knew where Draco was.
damage from the war meant Draco was often cold, but that was never an issue when Harry was there. “But you're doing a brilliant job, love. And I know for sure Scorpius couldn't wish for a better dad. He wouldn't want to. He adores you.”
“Again! You’re obsessing over that git
You might grow, but your house does not automatically grow with you.

Draco knew why Potter was reassuring him already. Indeed, his first instinct was to say no. He didn’t want his pity invitation. Plus, he only occasionally saw Luna, and the rest had no reason to like him. Well, they might have one annoying, green-eyed, messy haired reason, but Draco didn’t even know why Potter was being nice to him. It felt odd given that Draco struggled to even be nice to himself sometimes.
Draco chuckled. “The wording gave you away. The fierceness of that little speech was all you, though.” Draco searched for Harry’s hand under the duvet, only found his hip, and decided to just squeeze that. “And I still know you mean those words, so it doesn’t matter that they weren’t your own. We all have our-,”
’s, rambling like an absolute fool.
It was all he could do to stare,
seen that coming. Though she’d never been openly hostile or unsupportive, Draco had always had the idea that she wasn’t his greatest fan, either because he was dating her ex or because of his past. This went against all those ideas though. “Thank you, I-, I didn’t like how it went down yesterday, but I felt like I had to take a firm stand.”
Draco nodded but didn’t say anything. Instead he just held onto him, shaking a little as he silently cried onto his shoulder.
“Hey,” Harry whispered, as if he did this on a daily basis. “Is this okay for you?”
is more something for kids becoming teenagers, though I found some parents like reading it too. And
“Well you seem to like looking in his ‘general direction’ a lot,” said Pansy. “You do it at dinner too. It’s embarrassing.”
"Yeah." He smiled fondly at the memory. But then he seemed to deflate and his smile slowly slid away. "I wasn't exactly popular as a kid."
He wasn’t wearing his glasses. He looked different without them. Draco wasn’t sure if he liked it. Those hideous things somehow suited him.
“No, he hasn’t said a word.”
“Go back to sleep Draco,” Harry whispered, somehow knowing without looking that Draco hadn’t followed his lead and was still staring intently at him. Draco had never liked the sound of his own name more than when it slipped from Harry’s lips, almost as if by accident. Finally, Draco copied him, forcing himself to squeeze his eyes closed and be fully consumed by darkness. He focused on the sound of soft puffs of air escaping Harry’s slightly parted lips, letting it relax him until his heartbeat had calmed down and he was drifting off into a dreamless sleep.
“Yes.”
Despite this being frustrating, Harry found that he didn’t mind the silence too much. It was nice to sit with someone who expected nothing form you. Just like he didn’t mind sitting with Malfoy in their room, quietly studying or reading, or in Harry’s case, pretending to do those things then getting distracted five minutes in. That didn’t mean he would give up. Of course, he would prefer it if Malfoy joined in with his attempts at conversations, but he was working towards that. Which led to the second part of his plan. He needed to get Malfoy to talk to him. For now, he was focusing on gaining Malfoy’s trust.
Most of all, he didn’t want to be friends, not really. But he would take any part of Harry he was willing to give. Even if it hurt him when Harry eventually remembered why he hated Draco in the first place.
Draco’s lips tightened into a straight line and he forced himself to look away. Pansy laughed at him.
"What if we get caught?" he asked as he slipped his shoes on. He knew that if he was with Potter he would probably get away with it, but he didn't want to risk it. No doubt Potter was allowed to break curfew whenever he wanted, being the saviour of the wizarding world and all, but Draco was still being watched for bad behaviour.
“I don’t care.” He didn’t want to give up so easily. He was stubborn, he couldn’t help it.
She should subtly bring it up. But she had no idea how to do that. Harry could be pretty dense, so she couldn’t be too subtle. But “hey Harry, just wondered if maybe the reason you’ve been obsessed with Malfoy for the past 8 years and why you’ve now practically forced him to be your friend is actually because you have a crush on him rather than because he’s evil like you thought?” seemed slightly too accusatory.
“Fine!” Harry flung the hand that wasn’t holding Pepper into the air in defeat and picked up his own trunk.
“There’s nowhere else to sit...” It was probably true. Draco chose to sit on his own to get away from everyone else, but today he didn’t have a choice anyway, there were very few places to sit in the library and every one of them was currently occupied. But that was just a convenience.
“Well he’s not really got a choice, has he? It’s either that or be miserable for a whole year. Right Harry?” Ron said because he was a good friend and knew when Harry needed saving.
Harry just pouted exaggeratedly and frowned down at his fingers.
He hadn’t known at the time that he was jealous. It was only when looking back at his time at Hogwarts, that Draco realised he only resented Potter because he hadn’t wanted to be his friend. He’d never been good at handling not getting what he wanted. He blamed his parents for making him believe he should have whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it. For spoiling him. He blamed them for a lot of things.
Harry had noticed that Malfoy was a bit of a clean freak, if the orderly way he had arranged his things was anything to go by. So he started leaving his side of the room messy and ‘accidentally’ crossing the line onto Malfoy’s side. He was sure this would at least get him a sneer but disappointingly for Harry, Malfoy would just give the mess a disapproving look and then tidy it away when he wasn’t there. He tired being a distracting as possible, tapping his fingers on a table or humming along to whatever song came into his head whenever Malfoy opened a book to study. This received no reaction at all besides a clenched jaw, which he could have imagined altogether. He even started letting Pepper climb onto his bed and curl up on top of the sheets, no doubt leaving black and white fur behind. But Malfoy didn’t seem to mind. In fact, he seemed almost fond of the cat, stroking her head before gently shooing her off his bed.
After spending the last half hour of their free period studying together, Potter keeping his promise of being quiet, they had walked back to their dorm room. Draco had no reason to argue when Potter had stood up after him and followed him out the door of the library. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t exactly tell Potter to go away when they were both going to same way. They hadn’t said much but Draco had allowed a little conversation, and it was nice. It was true, Draco didn’t understand why, but Potter seemed extremely happy to be talking to him. It was most unsettling.
“What was that about?” Hermione asked when they reached him at the bottom.
It was probably easier to agree. He tried to put up a front of coolness, like the thought didn’t cause a lump of ice to form in this chest. Turning his attention back to his friends, he shrugged and said “Yeah… That’s all it is.”
He clenched his jaw but ignored her question. “Why were you waiting for me?” He was planning on sitting in the common room all day since no one would be around.
Harry yawned, Draco knew it was fake. "I'm tired. Maybe we should get back."
“I wasn’t planning on it... Pans and Blaise probably won’t,” Draco said. Honestly, he didn’t want to. It would only make him feel left out and he had no one to sit with anyway. But Harry’s hopeful expression fell into disappointment and Draco couldn’t resist his pout if he tried. “But I guess I could go on my own…”
Draco stopped staring like a creep and slid out from under the covers, trying not to disturb Harry but failing miserably in his rush to put some distance between them. He twisted round to see Harry’s eyes fluttering open to squint up at him.
Potter was once again, inexplicably, talking to him willingly. He had been doing this all week. Every potions lesson he would come and sit in the seat besides Draco as if it were the most normal thing in the world, which it was anything but. He may have believed Potter’s flimsy excuse of needing a partner, after all it did make sense for him to sit next to Draco rather than on the end of Granger and Weasley’s desk, had he not then done the same thing the next day in defence against the dark arts.
Draco shook his head and Harry nodded once, looking away.
“Sorry…” Harry said, a little offended.
Ginny frowned. “I’m sorry?”
"Of course I know it isn't. It's just not that big of a deal." He looked as if he'd rather be talking about anything else and Draco wondered if he had ever told anyone this before. Surely he had told his friends? They seemed like the kind of friends that told each other everything.
Harry seemed to be lost in thought, oblivious to Draco's staring.
For once Draco was being honest, he really didn’t want any company. He may secretly- or not so secretly if Pansy had anything to say about it- enjoy Potter’s company but he needed to write his essay. And Potter had a habit of fiddling with the first thing he could get his hands on. Besides, Draco was still suspicious of Potter’s intentions and he wasn’t interested in playing any games.
“No. But I want to.”
Now that Harry had found Malfoy, he wasn’t going to let him slip away. He was worried he had scared Malfoy off. Though he seemed to have enjoyed himself too, Harry couldn’t help but feel they had crossed some line. There was no way Malfoy could deny they were something like friends now, at least not to Harry. He couldn’t help but feel a little smug. But now Malfoy was avoiding him and he felt like he needed to make sure Malfoy wasn’t going to shut him out.
Harry just groaned in response, rubbing his eyes with the balls of his hands. “What time is it?” he said in a sleepy voice.
Draco walked into the potion’s classroom five minutes early. He took a seat at the table right at the back, hoping no one would sit next to him. Pansy and Blaise would sit together, they had always been closer to each other than he was to them. Which was fine. He didn’t mind sitting alone. Students slowly started to fill up the seats around him as the start of class neared, thankfully none of them even looked in his direction. Except, of course, Pansy and Blaise who sent him apologetic looks as they took a seat at the table to his right.
“I’ve explained it to you four times now,” Hermione said quietly. Harry thought it seemed more like ten. She was trying to be patient with him but there was underlying frustration in her tone. Their study session had been going fine, Harry had written almost half of his essay when Ron first asked for Hermione’s help. Now, after hearing her repeat the same thing with increasing annoyance, and volume-she had been asked to lower her voice more than once-he had made no progress and was starting to get a headache.
“Who’s it from?” Harry asked, not so subtly peaking over his shoulder at the envelope.
He didn’t realise he was shivering until Malfoy pulled out his wand, waved it around a bit and then felt the air heat up around him.
“Idiot. Why didn’t I finish this yesterday?” he muttered to himself as he hurried to throw more clothes and books into the trunk. Pepper watched smugly from the doorway, her tail waiving from side to side. “Shut up,” he told her.
“I’m not staring at him,” he mumbled, turning his attention away from Potter and back to Pansy.
The night before was different. As he had laid in bed, trying to escape the images his mind had conjured up, he wondered if maybe Malfoy was awake too. He never heard a sound from the other side of their room but that didn’t mean his roommate was asleep. Malfoy had seen just as many terrible things as him, it wouldn’t be a surprise if he also suffered from insomnia.
Harry pretended to search for something specific, but it wasn’t a book he was looking for. He had almost given up, thinking Malfoy had slipped out again without him noticing, when he reached the very last aisle, one people rarely went down and spotted a slender figure in Slytherin green robes. He was facing away from Harry, sitting at a desk in a hidden shadowy corner at the other end of the row of shelves, lit by a single lantern. Harry knew it was Malfoy, no one else had hair that blonde.
“Right. Obviously.” Having grown up with Muggles, Harry didn’t naturally turn to magic as the solution to all his problems. “Can I sit?”
Despite her suspicions of Malfoy, she was glad Harry now had someone else to talk to. It was obvious Harry felt awkward around her and Ron sometimes, like he was intruding on their relationship. It wasn’t true, obviously. They always had time for Harry. But if it made him feel better to give them space, she’d rather he wasn’t alone.
“It’s not really,” Hermione interjected. “He’s not going to go picking a fight with Harry after everything that’s happened.”
Potter ignored him, pointing his wand at the parchment and muttered something Draco couldn't hear. Coppery ink spread out over the parchment, forming a map of Hogwarts. Draco subconsciously moved forward to get a better look, peering over Potter's shoulder. "It lets you see where everyone in the castle is. See, there's us."
“No. It was my fault. You ready to go?”
He also wanted to argue, but he didn't think he had any right to make Harry talk about anything he was uncomfortable with. He opened his mouth, about to change the subject but all he would think about was little Harry, being forced to sleep in a cupboard by the people who were supposed to love and protect him, and found he couldn't think of anything to lighten the mood. Harry was the more cheerful one of the two and Draco had next to no experience with comforting people. He felt a little lost.
"I didn't think they'd let me... and even if I was allowed, I wouldn't feel welcome on the team." The younger Slytherins were distancing themselves as much as possible from the elder students, as if to prove that they hated them just as much as the other houses. A moment of slightly awkward silence followed where Potter searched for the right thing to say. Draco didn't want his pity; he knew he deserved everything he was getting.
It was Hogsmeade weekend and he had decided to start heading down to the entrance hall so he could meet Ron and Hermione and start walking into Hogsmeade. He assumed Malfoy had already left as he didn’t seen him when he woke up, early as always. He reached the bottom of the stairs before his friends so he lent against a wall while he waited. Excited voices echoed through the entrance hall as students rushed past him and through the doors to escape from the castle they had been stuck in for the last month. He understood their excitement, being in the castle for too long could be maddening sometimes. The hall started to clear and Harry wondered absently why Hermione and Ron were taking so long and rested his head back against the stone wall.
“I’m sorry about what happened to him. He was a good elf,” Draco said, trying not to sound awkward.
“Whatever.” He didn’t want to tell them he was trying to make friends with Malfoy. They wouldn’t understand. “It’s none of your business.”
“Is that supposed to make me feel better? That’s just more proof he’s gone mental.”
“How are you coping with being stuck in a room together?” she asked, ignoring his denial. She had tried to ask him about this before but he had only given her half answers. “Has he decided you’re plotting to kill him yet?” she smirked and Blaise let out a laugh. It was something they and the other Slytherins always joked about, Potter constantly thinking Draco was up to something. Draco had found it funnier before Potter’s suspicions were justified.
She mentally shook herself out of her thoughts. Eventually she would talk to Ron about it, but she wanted to be sure before she did that. She wanted to put off Ron’s inevitable freak out at the idea of Harry liking Malfoy for as long as possible.
of him and still Draco couldn’t stay away. But he didn’t want to be his dirty little secret.
“We both need a partner,” he said, as if it was obvious.
“Thank you,” Harry chuckled and rolled them over again. He loved using Draco as a pillow, even though Draco was convinced he was too bony for it. Though with his less than healthy lifestyle choices, he figured he might have gotten a bit more comfortable since the last time they’d shared a bed. “I love this. Waking up next to you.”
“That’s your battle to fight, love.” Draco smiled when Harry pulled a face to match his son’s. He hated playing bad cop, but as a single parent he still had to. It wouldn’t surprise Draco if they ended up eating pancakes that night though. “Andy! I’ll fetch you a cup of tea.” He greeted his aunt with a jovial smile and added in a low whisper as he walked past her, “And I’ll add something stronger to it.”
And with that, she hopped off the counter and found herself a place to sit. Ginny came in soon after, and in fear of her legendary teasing Harry didn’t bring Malfoy up again. But the note burned in his pocket all day, sometimes feeling like a promise, sometimes like a curse. But there was only one way to find out which one it would be.
things, they were exhausting.
“I’m not so sure about that. Ginny looks like she wouldn’t back away from the opportunity,” Draco replied, which wasn’t even all that far from the truth. Ginny didn’t mind him, but when they went out together, her humour was more often than not at his expense. “Or James, next time he’s playing vampire.”
Harry chuckled at the mention of his youngest daughter. If Lily wasn’t following James around, she was sleeping someplace that wasn’t her own bed. Any place that was warm really, like Harry’s bed just after he left it, the door mat next to the Muggle radiator, that one spot behind the couch with a warm water pipe running under it, or of course the cabinet under the kitchen sink where they’d put the boiler. She was so often referred to as a cat that they sometimes called her kitty instead of Lily.
