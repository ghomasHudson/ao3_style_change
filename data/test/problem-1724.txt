"Welcome everyone to a new day.." he smiled to them, a genuine smile "...I assume that you have all noticed that Headmaster Dumbledore is not here.." everyone nodded at his comment but said nothing.
"How could you do that to the students and think to get away with it! You disgusting girl! Hadrian is more than enough traumatized by what his relatives have done to him since the moment he was placed within their care...
"Everything was fine today I found out a number of people were using... Oh what were they called... Oh never mind but it was going great until I got a Floo call regarding her" said Arthur pointing to his daughter.
"Ok Otiz ok, Hadrian pick out anything else and then we will head to the children's section for Otiz and then collect more toys".
The gifts for the Weasely's were joint from Harry and Severus and they were a new cook book, a Muggle one, for Molly, Arthur was given a radio and was told by Harry not to touch it until he helped him with it.
Severus was shocked at first by what he had seen but he knew that it was all because of Harry's magic, first he had magiked his two stuffed animals to somewhat life and then Otiz becoming human, just how powerful was his son?!
"Professor the quills aren't mine honest to Merlin they aren't..." but she knew it was lying to her professor she would live with that, she didn't want them to be destroyed she had spent so much on them she couldn't afford to lose them.
Soon everyone were waiting for the Snape family to make an appearance only to here "Harry get off the ceiling, don't go and jump on the sofa or the beds, Otiz don't encourage him!" everyone outside laughed it looked like Harry was going to make this trip fun but was it going to be in a god way or bad.
As I am both I am able to do all of that and more, my magic in some areas are more powerful than other and in others it's lacking... really does depend" finished in a really bored tone.
Ron just kept quiet and when the car pulled to to them and all three got in, he knew he wasn't crazy but no one believed him, they even thought he was crazy!
Hermione was screaming her head off and all Otiz wanted to do was knock her out with either a good placed punch or his wand but he kept it together for Harry always for Harry.
"I'm not sure Hadrian" as he took his hand and lead him over to Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop as someone hybrid Kitsune had decided to eat Harry's last quill and stole the others as he was bored in animal and six year old form.
"...is the only one that can defeat Voldemort who just so happens to be sitting right next to me with my familiar on his shoulder" snapped Dumbledore at them men in the room.
He would of fallen but Severus had found out his was appalling at Magical travel means having to catch him many a times when they had apparated a few times as well as Portkey which he was absolutely abysmal at landing and would always throw up if he wasn't holding to Severus at any given time, with the floo he was ever slightly better as he was using it more due to coming and going from Malfoy Manor but still bad.
"Gross!!" she yelled making everyone in the hall to look at her, they couldn't see what was on her and why she screamed, only what they heard was quiet snickering and then running feet.
Inside the hospital wing Poppy was fussing about like normal and when the door opened she stopped and saw Harry holding his left arm to himself along with Draco and Blaise coming in.
"Oh Hadrian what did those... oh my poor boy" said Severus hugging Harry tightly as he cried into his shoulder.
"Isn't Otiz a animal hybrid of something or other?" said Draco sitting down next to Harry who still had Otiz in his arms.
There sitting on the bed wrapped in his cover was one Harry James Potter, trying to make himself as small as possible, muttering 'don't hurt me' 'I'll be good' 'I'll finish my chores so please don't hurt me' over and over again only for Severus to come slowly closer to the bed and to Harry.
This also would make it very hard to get any sort of job within the Wizarding World meaning that he would have to go to work outside, in the Muggle World which wasn't good within the Sacred families.
"He needed to hear the truth and as the saying goes...... the truth hurts.... and it does and I hope in due time both of them will come to an understanding of each other".
Lastly Severus left the last final seven drops of blood land on the last parchement, this one he was dreading he knew what he had seen when he had rescued him at the beginning of summer but he really didn't want to see what else those... those.. monsters had put the poor boy through.
"I'm not going to open it!" said Ginny to her brother, Ron tried to give it to either Fred, George or even Percy but each and everyone one of them shoved it away saying that it was addressed to him and Ginny as well as Hermione of all things and that they should open it.
Draco came in dressed in a dark green t shirt and black jeans with slits in the knees and bright red trainers of all things!
Happy that his master was finally happy Otiz got up on the sofa next to them and leaned slightly on Severus and fell asleep.
Harry just nodded and stayed close to friends and boyfriend not wanting to be near her after what she had said and tried to do to him since she was only a first year.
They had finally finished their meal and headed to the lounge where Draco's presents were but they noticed that the wrapping paper everywhere and Harry and a teenage Otiz was now playing chess with Draco's brand new chess set.
Albus sat down at his desk and screamed again, he waved his hand and brought his lemon drops back onto the table and took one out of the bowl and put in his mouth.
"I don't know what your on about, the boy must of been scared by how the animal reacted... yes that must be it" said Albus trying to lie but both men picked up on it.
Hermione Jean Granger is now a werewolf which no one wanted and I thought it would be a twist and how I'm going to plan it is going to be fun so watch out. She has been a bully to Hadrian since he was adopted and it was all because of what Albus had wanted Hadrian to be, a sacrificial lamb.
As they stepped though the floo they were welcomed by Lucius and Narcissa, by shaking of hands by Lucius and a tight hug from Narcissa to Harry, she only really let go when Otiz started to growl at her, he want happy with how she was treating Harry.
"Do you think it's his way to cheer me up?" asked Harry, Severus smiled towards him and then hugged his son tightly and nodded.
Again she picked up another parchment this one from a third year Hufflepuff stating that she had to take a morning after pill to make sure that she hadn't gotten pregnant, it was signed Mitsuko Sora the transfer student that came this year alone!
"Leave now or I shall make sure your parents are contacted about your poor behaviour over the past year. You will do nothing to anyone and their pets or familiars. Now get out!"
Severus was given potion ingredients form most of the Weasely's and a hand made jumper that was a snot green with a black 'S' on it and Harry was given some books, another chess set as well as some jokes and chocolate and the dreaded jumper this one was a bright yellow with a bright red 'H' on it.
"Sevvie I'm sorry for being an arse and everything I didn't know it would affect you like it has over the last few weeks. I'm really sorry" said Tom as he tried to worm his way back in to the man's closed of heart.
"Sirius Orion Black don't even thing about that do you want to go back to Azkaban?! After all I've done for you to keep your sorry arse out of it" said Tom making his eyes flash red for a moment.
Harry sighed into Severus and was almost asleep but Otiz had other plans and for the first ever time he disappeared out of the room in search for something.
Otiz hissed at her but did nothing else, Harry was very calm and so he was calm but not a 100% he didn't know her, so he was unsure.
Otiz got some meat and a brand new collar which had beautiful little gems which spelt out his name, these were given by both Harry and Severus.
"Mister Anderson.." said Severus using his new name instead of his old one, he would never be a Weasely again, just like his sister, yes she was still in the Magical World but that was only a matter of time until she was.
"...up to" said the twins and then they turned to look in the direction that their brother was looking at, ultimately frowning when they saw who it was.
"What do you mean I'm the smartest witch around! I don't need tutors to catch up! It's those idiots that need it now me!" screamed Hermione.
"Thank you Mrs Anderson we are going to talk to Maxwell on his own today to try and work out what is wrong with him and why he has started to go back in his therapy instead of going forward like he has been" said Severus and his new mother left the room.
"It appears that you got my Howler and how disappointed your father and I are with the pair of you right now, I think it best that you both heed the warning there that if we find out that you have been bullying Hadrian once again I will take my wooden spoon and it will make contact with both of your rear ends in front of the whole school to watch like they had to watch you bully poor Hadrian".
"Well that was well and truly strange even for him" said Draco making Harry nod to him, while he scratched Otiz behind the ear who purred slightly in his slight doze.
"Could we talk in private please as I have many things to discuss about Harry here along with other things" said Severus and Griphook made to leave making sure that Severus and Harry followed as well, as they entered the private room Harry just stood while Severus took the chair in front of the desk.
"Hadrian don't worry we are out as a family and you can never have enough clothes, plus I would like to get some nice clothes as the Malfoy's are coming over to dinner tonight and I know you don't like to wear robes and I doubt Otiz will wear them" and he laughed slightly to his son.
"Right away, good of you, go then Mr. Mallory" without correcting the teacher Draco got up and pulled slightly on Harry sleeve to bring him into a standing position.
"Forge I have ideas on how we could make them feel how our little brother has made Hadikins feel right now" said Fred looking at his brother.
"Make it so that your youngest son and Miss Granger's parents know what they have been doing for the past eighteen months" said Minerva how was now nursing a cup of tea while Severus had coffee.
It had now been a week since Ron and Ginny had gotten the Howler and then Molly bursting into the Great Hall, everyone, teachers and students alike minus Dumbledore of all things kept them at a wide birth as they just couldn't believe what they had done to their friend, true enough Ginny didn't know any better as it was her brother that was instigating everything and she was following hook line and sinker.
With a grumble Hermione got up and sneered at him, "I will be talking to my parents about getting Professor Dumbledore back in his rightful place and get you out Sötétség, you are not the rightful Headmaster here, Dumbledore is!" and she left.
They walked the other three to Transfiguration class and walking in Minerva was sitting on her desk in her Animagus form which was also green.
"All Weasely's in my office now!! Granger, Potter and Malfoy Now!" he screamed, everyone else tried not to laugh at him as the people named got up and left.
Logan Alexander Anderson neé O'Hara, 63 years old, black hair and deep blue eyes, Ben's father; an older version of his son. A retired carpenter and blacksmith, he took his wife's last name. AKA Alex
Everyone flinched they all knew that voice, he was so passed that they where all late for class and that his son was on the floor next to his godson, nose bleeding and glasses broken.
"Severus you have to see this, it's horrible if I had known he had gone through this I would of asked Albus to let the poor boy stay here" said Poppy to him and handed over the results that she had found hidden in an old storage cupboard within the Hospital Wing.
"Sev, Minerva what a pleasant surprise to have you here, what can I do to help you?" he asked finally decided to have a break from the mountain of paperwork that never seems to be ending.
The roughly picked him up by his arms and said "Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore we at the Ministry find you guilty of treason against our Great Nation and putting young witches and wizards into in-compromising positions where their lives are on the lines where they shouldn't be.
Along with the Weasley's, Charlie was bringing his girlfriend Nymphadora Tonks, so there was a good mixture of people going the four close friends where going to enjoy every last minute everyone had been before besides Harry and they didn't wan to ruin anything for the boy even when he found out that they had been before and tried to get it out of them.
"So he's a double Animagus which is rare in it's own" said Poppy trying to check him over slowly but du to being a Medi witch and not knowing hat she should be looking for in an animal she wasn't much help.
You Draco have a loving family he never has and it's going to take so much time for him to understand that, he hates loud noises, screams you name it it's there anything unexpected really. His appetite is something we are working on, as you saw he wont take anything without being allowed to, only at school he's comfortable with it all.
Classes had finally finished for the day and everyone got up and started to leave before they all left Filius set about giving them homework on the Cheering Charm.
You all accepted this but each one of you loved how my body became one with each and everyone of you!" and she laughed again making everyone that had let her take advantage of them almost throw up everything that they had eaten.
"I wish you wouldn't open someone else's presents or go through our personal belongings Hadrian, you are now almost 14 years old you don't have to do what a child would" said Narcissa as she drank another non potion laid cup of coffee.
When both of them looked it over they didnt see what the teachers saw, they saw was Hermione's perfect neat hand writing as well as many different types of notes and outcomes of all the subject of the homeowrk, this girl loved her work and would make sure that it was correct 100% before handing it in.
"Listen here beaver you should at least say sorry for knocking someone over, especially someone who has just come out of the hospital wing" again he snarled but Hermione just ignored him.
Otiz wasn't having any of this he wanted Harry back in the castle and either in the common room or in Severus' chamber's away from the bushy menace that they knew was still around.
I will set up this meeting with yourselves, his new godparents as well as any others you have interacted with, but I do think a blood adoption will work more in your favour than anything else. Hadrian would you be ok with that?"
The meeting was at the Ministry in Fudge's office no less, Albus was already there in magic damping handcuffs who knew what the old man had up his sleeves.
What do you think?? Do you like the outcome?? I'm sorry that I didn't do much on the pranks on her but I thought that the outcome from tem was better and plus I don't like Ginny one bit.... from the moment she saw Harry in the second book/film I've always hated her!!
They arrived back at Hogwarts by eleven am and so it was back to the mundane life of a student and teacher......
"Ok Lu-Lu we won't" snickered Severus as he started to walk out of the hall and towards the potion labs.
"....you told them!!!" screamed Harry into Severus' face, this made Otiz' hackles rise slightly at the outburst, fur staticing everywhere, Severus sighed he knew he had made a big mistake by it, he knew would turn out much better then he would expect in the future.
"Welcome dear, I've missed you" said Molly hugging Harry again, "that's alright Mrs. Weasely I've had such a great year so far and I'm happy to be here to celebrate the holidays" said Harry as both were led to the sofa, Otiz on the other hand knew that someone was here that Harry didn't like and so kept very close.
"Once rested we will do the blood adoption which will be just mixing our blood together in a goblet, a spell on the blood and then all you have to do it drink it. You will go through any changes through the night, nothing will hurt during then I promise you" .
They had headed to Diagon Alley to finish everything but first lunch and so they headed to the Three Broomsticks, afterwards they managed to get everything else, including two miniture dragon statues one for Harry and one for Charlie which came alive when you said an incanation.
In the end he let her go back to her dorms but not before letting her that she will be having detention with Filch for the next week, but as she was leaving Filius had a feeling that she wasn't listening at all.
"I don't care what his name is I want him in this office now!" and he screamed which only made his already high pitched voice even higher making the students place their hands over their ears. Ouch!
The three smiled at the two animals but stopped when Eriol came flying in and crash landed in Ron's dinner if all things who was quickly followed by Tyki who landed on Severus with a letter attached to his leg from one Molly Weasely.
Filius entered and noted Otiz right away just sitting there next to Harry and his friends while glaring at the Gryffindor's namely Hermione, more so than the others.
He was staring at Harry of all things, who was happily taking to Draco and Blaise while Pansy was trying but failing to get his attention.
"Severus what are you doing here, I asked for Mister Malfoy to bring Mister Potter here" said Albus in his high pitched voice, the twins so trying not to laugh at it.
Only to have his son hide behind him mumbling something about not wanting to explain everything to his friends and so it was down to him.
"Max had a panic attack before coming to class not long ago and his parents phoned me saying he was having a bad day today. I can take him out of class and we can work one on one with him if that's ok" she said having his teacher nod to her .
"Who the bloody hell are you?" he asked quite rudely only for the person to sigh to him "Maxwell my name is Greta Millstone, your school as well as your doctor Dr. Ashford and parents employ me to help you with your mental health problems" she said.
Tom beamed brightly, Fawkes trilled happily that his master was happy, his feathers glowed and slightly sparked but nothing caught fire and Tom just stroked the feathers making Fawkes trill more and more.
His uncle started to throw abuse at him making a right scene, then his aunt did and his cousin tied to pull him away from me which broke him more.
BULLYING POOR HADRIAN, YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT I CALLED HIM HADRIAN JAMESON SEVERUS SNAPE AND NOT HARRY JAMES POTTER, FOR JUST BEING ADOPTED BY PROFESSOR SNAPE.
"Aren't you coming? This is your room" Harry then scrambled to my side, Harry then looked up and asked "M-mu room? My own room? at home I never really had a room, I always slept in the cupboard" Harry slowly looked around the room that he could call his, it had a four poster bed, a dresser and a desk. Harry was still so shocked that me the greasy git was being so nice. I can be when I want thank you very much!! "Thank you sir" Harry mumbled "you're quite welcome, well off to bed with you, if you need anything at all my bedroom is just to the left of yours. The bath room is to the right of your room" I watch as Harry set his things down and climb into the huge bed.
"Harry is this all true?" asked Albus but he didn't move he knew his name now and wouldn't go by any other name, he was no longer a Potter he was a Snape!
"Follow me then young Heir Prince, I have to do the rest of you to all stay behind s if you join us in the Cleaning Hall you would contaminate everything which could possibly kill young Heir Prince" and with that Harry followed Griphook into a different room.
"Is it something like Disney World?" asked Harry only for Tom and Severus nod as they knew what it was..... after much research that is.
She whisked him off to a hospital bed and made him sit down, "so anyone going to tell me what has happened and what has brought him to see me again?" she eyed his two friends.
"She will also be helping with the garden and everything else that we need, if we go out she will have the charm placed on her so she doesn't leave our side like a child, she has acted like" finished Arthur making Fudge nod at their decision.
That how ever had completely slipped and now she was only getting P, on her homework which didn't please her one bit think that the teachers were against her and her knowledge.
"Hadrian what have you been up to?" asked Tom to his soon to be soon if everything worked out right.
"Miss Granger quiet in here, you being a third year should know better than talk while everyone else is reading and studying" said Madam Pince as she came out from a book shelf.
"You freak! I'll make a scene if I want to, you have no right over what I do and say! You freaks need to go back to where you come from!" she yelled again.
Harry muttered in his sleep as Draco tried to wake him, but it was Otiz that woke up first and changed form, he was back to being a teenager.
Draco had managed to get Theo and Blaise to come to join in the fun, they had been playing 2 on 2 Quidditch which had Harry and Draco on opposite teams as they were the best of the best out of the school anyway plus it wouldn't be fair if they were both against poor Theo and Blaise.
"I do but I can finish them tonight when I have a student in detention for blowing up a cauldron again" and so the two headed to the Headmasters.
He then looked at the new Headmaster of Hogwarts and glared the best he could in the circumstances but backed down fully when Tom's eyes flashed red.
"I'm going, I'm going" said Harry as Severus pushed him towards the bathroom, Harry was ready within the lotted time frame.
"Otiz come back here" said Harry only to get the child to turn back into his animal form and jump from his lap over the table and into Harry's arms purring again.
"SIRIUS!" shouted Charlie making everyone look at the young couple and the sighed, it looks like it was a bad idea to bring four pranksters with them on this trip and made a note to themselves not to do it again.
Sirius just nodded at this no way was he going to make 'that' thing mad, he had hidden when Otiz saw him for some reason he was scared of Otiz but he didn't know why he was.
Harry did what he was told and took off his glasses, his father was right he could see perfectly! What in Merlin's name was happening to him.
When the three of them had exited Ron took a bite out of some chicken and right there and then after swollowing he started to blurt out things like.
"Mister Weasley if I was you I would kindly shut up, you as well as your sister and Miss Granger there are in enough trouble as it is. You still have your case to go as well and this statement has just been added to it" and he fixed Ron with an icey glare.
"They said that Otiz saw her in Hogsmeade and Hadrian should be fine but I will be having a room mate for a while but other than that he should be fine".
"It will be alright do you want me to get your father to go with you?" asked Filius only to gain a nod from the distraught boy.
"Ok as you know I adopted you, as well as I am a godparent...." he waited for it to click with Harry to see where this was going, to his nod Severus continued.
"I think Severus.... can I call you that? If it does come to this you will have to. Albus isn't one to listen once he get something into that head of his. I have been telling him that he is your son but not once had he looked at the documents I have presented him with.
He lead him through the door hidden in the back of the office to Severus' chambers where a nice meal was waiting for them as he didn't see him at dinner that night.
Draco put his hand on Harry's shoulder "Hadrian it's ok look up at the Head Table I can see a small blue haired boy sitting on my father's lap" this made Harry turn towards said table.
This shocked the court how could a respectable wizard one of Dumbledore's calibre speak so low, so disgusted with the Boy Who lived they just didn't know.
He bit her shoulder hard making her scream out more, Otiz went to protect Harry but Draco had started to pull him away and hide behind a  tree away from everything that had happened, he was in tears being hugged by Draco he was safe.
"Come on Hadrian we have to get back for dinner" said Severus and they walked out and headed back home, Otiz walking next to Harry his tail wrapped around his arm, he mewed all the way there and when they opened the door Otiz made sure to lick Severus' hand who he now knew as Harry's caregiver.
Tom was in deep, deep trouble by his boyfriend now and he didn't know what he was going to do to get himself out of it.
Otiz came from under the bench and growled, no one had ever heard him growl before meaning that he was annoyed and very pissed off.
"I didn't do anything, this stupid thing somehow ended up in my hair!" she screamed to the dwarf professor.
Twenty minutes later Severus was met by a clean, dressed Harry who still had damp hair and his glasses were still slight steamed up. With a flick of his wand he had Harry's hair dry and his glasses clear.
"So Potter part of the snakes now are you? Remember you will also be a lion in the snakes den" said Pansy
"Hadrian come now child everything will be alright..." said Severus trying to get his attention, all he got was a slight nod of a head.
He stormed away and out of the Shrieking Shack only to have him brought back in my Otiz in human form, sit and listen to each other!"
Severus sighed he didn't want this to happen this was going to undo everything that they had worked for.
You no longer have your magic, you will no longer be able to tap into it. You will remember everything about the Magical World, we are here to make sure that you will not be able to speak about the Magical World from now on" finished Severus as Tom and Poppy came closer to him.
Harry had returned to school and was right away brought into a hug by Ron and Hermione, at first he flinched but slowly relaxed but didn't completely relax like he used to, he didn't really trust them for some reason.
"Miss Granger you can't catch up unless you go back over the basics and get your grades up again. I know you can do it, your tutor will be with you six days a week where you will go over two subjects daily and then hopefully your grades will go up once again" said Tom.
"Ron listen, dad.... Severus saved me over the summer as my uncle beat me within an inch of my life without him I would of died. He adopted me and gave me have a life that I should of been given but sadly was denied until then.
"I bet it did you had twenty seven blocks and potions on you and now that they are gone you should be feeling a lot better if not sore due to the cleansing" and Severus rubbed his son cheek lightly.
"Well Miss Granger as I am the Headmaster I changed the password, it isn't what you think it is. Professor Dumbledore liked sweets I don't so I changed it to something I like... Család Együtt" and the Gargoyle lept out of the way and so Tom let Hermione go up first an into the office.
Remus looked over and saw who Tom was talking too and when he saw the familiar black fur of one Padfoot a.k.a. Sirius Orion Black he knew something was up.
"Y..ye...yes sir..... about... them?" stammered Harry to him, Severus gripping his hand in support and Otiz was now on his lap mewing into his ear comforting him.
"Oh it's Yahtzee, I think dad gifted her to you when you fell sleep last night after we had dinner, she's now your house elf now along with Boris and Mink, she isn't part of the Malfoy family" smiled the blond to his friend.
I comforted him but from what I can recall Otiz noticed Hadrian's distress and so decided to transform but I'm not sure you'll have to ask Otiz about that more" said Severus to the Malfoy family.
Harry sighed too a deep breath and soon Bogert Vernon was blowing up like a balloon and burst making a horrible but at the same time funny noise this made everyone laugh.
"Very well, Hadrian here has been abused all his life, he no's nothing but pain and guilt. Whatever he did was always wrong and was punished for it even if it wasn't his fault. They wouldn't allow him to eat anything besides scrapes if he was lucky enough to get anything at all, he just had water once maybe twice a day, again if he was lucky.
"Don't even think about it or you go into the corner and Severus will take away your treat that he has made for you two" his made him pout and leave the stuff alone.... for now that is.
As they were laughing and joking Ron came barrowing in only to stop when he was his ex best friend and his potions teacher.
He backed down when he heard the snarl from Otiz but with Hermione screaming and blood rushing down her arm that no one seemed to want to clean up at the moment.
"Oh come on you idiots you know why I did it! I told you that once I became Mrs Potter you would all be getting part of his money when I killed him off after a month of marriage.
A spell will be cast on your parchments so then we will know if you have used a self writing quill or not. Your first detention will be tonight after dinner for two hours and like I said you WILL be writing all your essays with me. Now off to dinner" and with that Hermione left the office.
"Now listen here Dursley's, I have adopted him as well as something we like to called blood adoption, you have no blood tie to my son. Lily is still his mother as the same with Potter Sr. but his is now and forever more my son Hadrian and I would likely ask you to leave us alone" as he said this his wand sparked.
Lost in his thought he didn't notice one of the cauldrons bubble and then explode! But due to all his always ready precautions a shield formed right away protecting everyone in the classroom.
The women had tears in their eyes while the men showed restrain not to cry but he knew that they wanted to but they were a big brave gusto to their wives and friends.
"That's my father and I would kindly ask you not to call him such things sir!" growled Harry to him.
"Ron just leave it please, I don't want to get into a fight of all things" said Harry as he tried to talk past his ex friends.
"Dray we should head back then, I don't think your parents including my dad will be too happy if we are late" said Harry to him and waved goodbye to the rest of them and headed back to the castle.
As Tom carried on working he didn't notice that his door was knocked on and then opened and closed, only for feet to stop in front of the desk.
"Hadrian is everything alright, you seem awfully quiet?" asked Severus to his son who was sitting on the sofa looking into the flames of the heath, he only got a sigh back in response.
"Don't even think about finishing that sentence Weasley, I'm different from them and as you can see I'm not a runt or a stupid thing as you so put me!
"Oh so Molly and Arthur knee what there youngest been up to then?" asked Lucius being drawn into the conversation after what I just said.
He walked over to the snakes and then the wolves but he didn't know what to choose at all and looked towards his father holding both.
"Well Harry we are taking you along with the Malfoy's, Remus, Sirius, Bella, Rodolphus and Rebastain and the Weasley's not including the two youngest I might add, their youngest son is no longer apart of the magical world and their daughter will be brought here to be taught more by the house elves as she is now a slave...."
Ninth memory from the age of eleven just before he went to school, dislocated shoulder, elbow and ankle all on the same side.
"Cornelius let me explain it was all for the greater good, without Harry..." he was cut off by Tom and Fudge by saying "Hadrian".
"You fucking heard it, I had sex with everyone I could get my hands on so then I didn't have to do my lousy bloody stinking homework! I did it all so then I could become Mrs Potter, get the Potter fortune and then I was going to kill Harry off!"
"Harry what are you doing there, Gryffindor is the place for you!" shouted Ron to him, this made Hermione nod her head as well as Ginny, who Harry had met on a few occasions.
"All he needs is a name and a drop of your blood and he is all yours and he will only follow you and will trust those you trust no one else" and she smiled to them.
"Come on your you lot if you don't get going you'll be late for your next class which is Herbology" said the stranger to them as he started to walk off towards the greenhouses and Madam Sprout.
The portraits saw what had happened and so went to get Poppy right away and in a flash of green she was standing there in shock.
He saw Harry laying in his bed crying his eyes out, wrapped tightly up within his covers, Otiz ran over to him right away and jumped on to the bed and wrapped himself around Harry protecting him from anything and everything.
Even though Severus was against the whole chocolate thing wasn't for him he had to admit to a select few and I mean a very select few he did have a sweet tooth.
"Severus what does he mean by Lord Prince? I thought they all died out?" said Pamona to the black haired man who in turned sighed.
He was automatically placed in Slytherin as well as he has his own wand this was without going to Ollivander's, due to being what he is, his magic made his wand.
Everyone had arrived and were finally sorted, Severus sat in his normal seat and next to him was Remus Lupin that Harry had breifly met over the summer holidays when they went shopping in Muggle London.
"This is freaking awesome" his blond hair had come out of his leather tie and was all over the place screaming in joy.
"Hadrian please it's too early, I know it's my birthday and all that but I didn't go to bed until 11 last night as I was having trouble with my homework and I wanted to mak..." he was stopped by a stinging hex to his back.
"Otiz calm down, they aren't worth it at all" said Draco as he was trying to calm Harry down as he was starting to have a panic attack, ever since the verbal attacks on him as well as some physical, the three always sent him into a panic attack.
I think some of the Professors as well as Hadrian, I think, will most likely write to our parents about what has occured. With that I wish you good night" and he left to make sure that he had the right information to write to his parents.
"Hurry up and eat we have to be at the Ministry in ten minutes, someone thought it was a good idea to sleep in" and he chuckled again while he banished his plates into the sink to be washed later and place the newspaper onto the table to finish later.
Once they all got off and gave a potion to settle their stomachs all they heard from Harry was "again, again" over and over, it appeared that he loved anything fast well he was always going beyond the limit of how fast his own broom went so that wasn't much of a surprise that he wanted to go on something even faster than the norm.
As they were sitting in Charms which was better than History of Magic and Care of Magical Creatures, he swears that Hagrid was trying to piss him off, listing things about his creatures which in fact was completely and utterly wrong! Where did he get his information again? History which in his book was a high snore fest and many of them had fallen asleep including Harry and Draco.
Ginny tried to move away from her parents as she was stuck sitting on the bench listening to them but every time she moved she knew she would get into trouble, she wasn't allowed to speak to anyone and could only have the bare minimum to eat and her clothes were now an awful shade of grey which she hated.
Instead of being with the Slytherin's you will be staying with me for the next week, if that's ok with you Hadrian?" she asked him who now was white as a sheet of paper.
"My uncle would make me sleep in the cupboard under the stairs since I started to live with them, I didn't even know my name is Harry until I was at least six, when I was finally let to go to school that is, I always thought that is was Freak.
"No Mister Dursley he has not I have adopted the young boy and have changed his name, you are no longer his guardian".
Mother- Hallie Harper Anderson neé Clarks, 37 years old, light brown hair and warm honey coloured eyes. She is a receptionist at a nursery that her children went to when they were babies. AKA Hails
In a swirl of purple magic and a bright light, where Otiz once stood, now stood a small boy that looked to be about six if they hazard a guess.
"My name is Ron! Ron Weasley! My name isn't Max!" he shouted at her making her sigh, it was the same conversation every morning with him besides the one that was "I'm a wizard! Magic is real! I'm not crazy I know magic!"
Dumbledore wasn't much better, or Dum-Dum as he had taken to call him when he was in his room or with his father, he hated how he had tried to get him away from his father and back into his "loving" family as Dumbledore kept saying.
"Well as far as I can work out he hasn't.... what is that Muggle saying... I can't believe I just asked that".
Otiz threw down Mooney, making Harry pick him up which still being active due to Harry accidental magic whimpered and curled into him.
A very angry Severus Snape was making his way to Dumbledore's office to discuss some new information he had just informed on by Madam Poppy Pomfrey.
"Minerva please look after him for me, I know you will be the aunt in his life that he should of had" and with that he left.
"Dad.. Dad... Dad I can't wait, where do I begin to tell you how much I love this!" beamed the twelve year old boy to his father as he tried to help his father put away their clothes for the week they would be staying.
I would never wish this to happen to to anybody old or young to go through what he has been through, it's just wrong I wouldn't wish my twins to go through this they have lost their mother already, again I am sorry for what my client has put young Mister Snape through" by the end of this he was crying and Albus was red with fury!
"There is always a blip in the road, the good comes with the bad it seems" said Remus getting up whacking Sirius with his book on his head and smiled slightly.
"Sowwy" and he too a big sip from the cup making a little bit dribble down his chin, which was wiped away by Harry right away and placed his blood stained finger into the little boys mouth.
The moment they set foot into Kihei, Maui Harry was in awe! He had never, ever been out of Britian for any type of holiday and so was relishing in just being allowed to go on holiday and not spend any of it at Mrs Figgs and her bloody cats.
I walk towards the Headmaster's office and say the stupid password, why does it have to be those blasted sweets he always eats "Lemon Drops" and I head up to the office.
Harry pulled on his father, this bought Dudley's attention and tried to sneak over to most likely hit the smaller boy but Severus saw it and gave a small smile.
"So what are we going to be doing now as it's the weekend?" asked Draco but it was only Blaise that was paying attention to him as the others were working on completing their homework.
Harry shunk down and hid the best he could beside his father, he had to keep up mind you as he had started walking towards the Slytherin table.
"Harry help me, this stupid man won't let me move!" nagged Hermione from behind Sirius was was telling her kindly to shut up.
"I demand someone get me something that I can use my brain against not something that's for children!! I demand someone to come here right now!"
I have had many complaints about how you have been acting in the tower and I had asked everything to be persented to me via writing and if they consented to it I would gather the memoires of each incident.
"Harry I can't believe you have turned against your friends! You are the boy that lived! The one that will kill the one who shan't be named!! We love you Harry come back to our side" yelled Ron gaining everyone's attention that was in the hall.
Out stepped his Uncle Severus holding onto a small boy with unruly black hair, Draco's mouth almost fell off due to the surprise that his Uncle Severus' son was none other than Harry Freakin James Potter!!
Severus asked more questions but Harry just looked back down at the floor and then he started to cry, Severus lifted his chin and as he did that Harry launched himself at him.
Once they landed Molly went on a war path! Not only did she get a letter from the twins, thinking it was a complete joke but to get one of Percy! She knew then something was up but this! Never in her wildest dreams would she have thought that her eleven year old would do that!
"His magic has completely settled now, he's not making things fly around like he has all day long" said Poppy coming to look at her patient.
"She will live as a Squib, she won't be allowed to do magic, snap the wand she won't be needing it anymore, I will teach her how to cook us meals and clean up the Burrow all without magic that is" said Molly making Arthur nod.
"Har.. Hadrian I'm sorry for what happened but you were meant to be with me after what happened to you parents that fateful night, j went and chased after a rat which I shouldn't of done but I did, I wasn't until I was being taken away that I remembered you"
The following day Harry was woken by someone shaking his shoulder quietly telling him that it was time to get up and that breakfast was on the table. Slowly but surely he got up and headed downstairs in a white top with golden snitches on it and dark blue jeans and black trainers.
"Well we were in the reptile house when everything happened they started to verbally abuse me again, and I hid. They just wouldn't stop, the staff at the zoo had to step in and force them out, I think they are banned from going there... not sure.
I'm sorry that I scared Theodore I truly am but I heard Lady Hogwarts complain about that girl and how she and the rest of them bullying you and now she is taking action.
Harry squeaked at the tone burying himself further into Severus' robes making them make both chuckle and sigh at the same time. "Hadrian its ok they won't hurt you, you're not there anymore" said Severus stroking the child's hair slightly making the child relax a bit.
The main course was of course Lucius favorite meal which was a beef Wellington with onion chive mash, green beans, wine gravy and for drinks the adults had a glass of either rosé or white wine the boys had non-alcoholic wine and Otiz was happy with his blood.
"Well it appears that you Mister Weasely are in a whole heap of trouble! Since we left not even ten minutes I've had nothing but information about you and your acts... shall we call them?" she looked him right in the eye.
"You idiot! My son came back distraught and in a full blown panic attack! His familiar almost killed her but thanks to my son's friends he didn't! I have a feeling that due to your meddling, not like that old man, I'll have a mute son for a few days if not weeks, he will be rooming with me yet again..." he let that hang in the air for a bit.
"Hadrian listen to me son, it's our first Christmas together, I know that you would either spend it at Hogwarts or at the Weasley's but I think it would be a good idea to celebrate it together" said Severus to him and Harry only signed to him but then out of the blue smiled.
You are not allowed out of your room unless called for, you are not alowed out of this house unless I am with you, you will not be allowed to talk to any of your friends if they send an owl I will be the one to reply to them.
"Yea, I'm good just shocked that Otiz is now human... but what else is strange, magic is real why not this!"
"My mother was Eileen Josephine Prince, we don't know if I have any aunts and uncles or even cousins due to her being disowned by her family for marrying my father Tobias Snape, but as such I am now Lord of the Prince line an due to me adopting Hadrain he is Heir apparent.
Severus took it upon himself to calm his son down, he was picked up and brought into a cuddle, his head on Severus' shoulder hugging him close.
"Listen I didn't mean to honest to Merlin I didn't mean to honest! I just wanted to get the one that sold your parents out to the man who killed them".
It was the last lesson of the day, Ron still hadn't returned to lessons as Otiz' spell made sure of that, perhaps tomorrow he would come too, who knew when it came to Otiz.
"I'm sure, he was and still is my favourite cousin after Regulus died at nineteen" said Narcissa as she took a sip of the drink Draco had gotten her which was called if she recalled a Slushie.
"Welcome students to a new day at Hogwarts as you all must of noticed we have a new member of staff at the Head Table, this man is now the Headmaster of Hogwarts as the Ministry finds Albus Dumbledore ineligible due to what has happened over the past year.
It looked like Fred and George had done something extra just for them and it looked like quite funny.
My chores would be to clean the whole house, do the washing, washing up, hoover, mop, dust, garden, sort out the loft as well as the garage, cook their food, wash the car and paint the fence and that was just my typical week really.
"That slimy snake, that black bat and that thing what ever it is should be put down, for good!" said Hermione to Marcus and then he knew who they were on about.
"Minerva I can get her a trial and most likely she would be sentenced but becasue she is only an eleven year old, nothing would happen besides having her wand snapped...." said Arthur "...if you want to really go down that route" he turned to Severus for the last part.
Everyone stopped what they were doing when the doors of the Great Hall banged open to reveal one very pissed off Hermione.
Your stuff that you have left at the Burrow has had been burned you have been casted out of the family wholeheartedly, everything that had your picture or name on no longer exists the same with Ginerva.
Severus hugged back and he knew Harry was saying something which sounded like 'dont look' 'its was my fault' 'I'm sorry' and in the end he cried into Severus' shoulder.
I will be informing your parents as your father works at the Ministry I think he would like to know what you have been doing.
"Who knew a hybrid animal like Otiz who drinks blood and changes into a child and teenage form likes coffee" said Theo to them hoping said hybrid didn't take his drink as well.
Without the help from staff members I think his magic would of lashed out like it has now in his room, he had put up very powerful silencing and locking charms on his room and we won't be able to get in there for the time being.
After his outburst on the whole thing Draco was still fuming while everyone was quiet besides the sound of crying getting louder, Severus just started to rub his back gently to try to stop the tears that were in full flow.
"Headmaster, we need to discuss some things right now!" I snapped. "My dear boy, what can I do for you?" Dumbledore asked as he stared at the Daily Prophet before him, really? I just glared before continuing "are you aware of what is happening in Potter's home?" even though I'm so trying to be civil with this idiot even though he's my boss. "Severus, what is wrong? is Harry alright?" Dumbledore finally looked up with concern lacing his every word, wow that got his attention usually we have to say something sweet related to get that reaction. I could only close my eyes and remember how my git of a father used to beat me. I quickly snapped out of it only to stare into blue depths of Albus Dumbledore's eyes.
A house elf wearing a crisp green and black towel with the letter 'S' embroidered on it placed a sippy cup onto the table in front of Hadrian's food.
Harry was just placing his cap on his head when a knock on the door came, this made him flinch but Severus went to answer it.
Tom Riddle stood up and introduced himself, he looked like nothing like he used too, for one he looked to be in his late forties early fifties, his hair was a a soft dark brown almost black with some specks of grey and his dark eyes glowed with life.
Christmas day had finally arrived and Harry for once was happy, he was with his father and he had Otiz with him, which at that moment he was on Harry's chest licking his face to wake him up, thank Merlin he wasn't... Damn he was jumping on him.
The stern stoic man acting like a children which he never got to do when he was a child thanks to his father and grandfather but today they saw him happy and let that stupid Malfoy mask down and they finally saw the man that they became friends with as well as fell in love with.
Breakfast soon ended and Severus nodded towards the Gryffindor table where Harry was sitting with his friends and then got up, "hey mate where are you going?" asked Ron but he said nothing to him and slowly followed Severus to the front of the castle.
He also wanted to be with the Malfoy family he loved baking cookies with Narcissa or Cissa as she wanted him to be called and because of that it also meant that he got to know Draco's cousin Dora more as well as her mother Andromeda and her husband Edward Tonks, it looked like he now had a huge family that all loved him unlike the Dursley's which he had a feeling that Tom was up to something with them.. that or he had his snake Nagini do something.
"Well that is something I never expected to see, thank you Professor Snape, this will help but I would need young Hadrian's memories as well if we want to press the charges you are asking for.
Without thinking Harry hit Otiz on the back of his head even though he was a good inch or so taller than him.
The other Aurors picked Ron up by his elbow and dragged him out along with Ginny while the Weasley parents went and talked to Lucius and Severus who now had Harry in his arms still crying his heart out, Otiz growling when they came near him.
"Sir who do you mean? Otiz or me?" asked Harry to the teacher as now Otiz was doing the spell without his wand.
You are no longer part of the Wizarding World, you are not a Weasley, Lady Magic has made you a Muggle in all sense of the word.
In class Minerva was writing up instructions on the board while everyone waited, this gave Ron time to write a note, making sure it flew over to Harry and his stupid slimy cohorts but before it even had a chance to lande Minerva turned round but before she could even comprehend what was happening the parchment was lit on fire and there was growling.
"Because you're bad at keeping secrets Draco that's why" said Theo to his friend making the blonde blush, this in turn made everyone laugh.
A few of the students came to Harry's rescue while others stayed and others went to get some teachers.
"Dad what are Narcissa, Lucius and Draco's birthdays?" he asked making him look at his son, and then he smiled and said "Draco's is June, Lucius' I believe is September and if I recalled Narcissa's is March, so we will need a moonstone, a sapphire and lastly an aquamarine stone" and he nodded to the jeweller.
Seventh memory from the age of nine, Vernon driving into his anus ripping it apart yet again, blood spilling every where.
Harry looked over to see all black coming towards them and he shyly smiled at him, the others not seeing who was coming up behind them.
Severus couldn't wait to go to the National Park to look for potion ingredients, from the rare native birds, the bamboo forest and hiking into the volcanic landscape.
Harry just hummed and pulled his legs towards him and curled into a ball saying nothing, Severus knew that he wouldn't be talking for a while now and that soon he would be asleep but first dinner.
With a clap of his hands the banquet appeared and Albus said "glibber, flit, gobble, newt" letting everyone know that they could start eating, Remus sat back down taking his chocolate out of his mouth wrapping it up and putting it back into his pocket.
Severus had managed to get into his quarters mind you it was a rather difficult task as Harry wouldn't come out of his robes no matter how much he tried to get the poor boy out.
Harry just blinked to him and then showed a very small smile towards his Potions Professor, he could perhaps get used to this but he would have to see.
Harry soon came round the corner and saw Otiz and Tom talking and he laughed at the meanie pants comment making Tom look at him.
"How can you do that to your own brother! He's done nothing to you two!!" she jabbed her finger to them "he never has done anything! He wants his friend back!" she yelled again to them.
**Did you even check on the boy?? Did you know that he was beaten? Malnourished, dehydrated, bones broken and misshaped, lung punctured, bruises and burns, scars that have healed and some that were still pink. Words carved into his front and back....I don't even want to think about that anymore..... The boy Albus as you put it was safe, I think not I also found that the boy bloody and he was raped Albus!! Raped!! He was treated less than a house elf.
Minerva picked up one parchment that was for a sixth year Ravenclaw stating that he was punched and kicked in the most delicate area and in the face and forced to write his assignments last year even though he was trying to study in the library at the time, it was sighed Alexi Hickinbottom, she could tell that he had been crying writing this.
Next was to by dinner that night and Molly thought of a nice steak and kidney pie and a small vegetable pie for Ginny with mash on the side loaded with gravy would be a good choice for the night.
"I bet he just fell messing around with his cousin, he seems nice enough telling me that he and his friends always let Harry join in any of their games, he says that he treats Harry as a brother, he also told me that he was very much a part of the family. All of them laughing and joking, watching television... what ever that my be... sharing treats and a bedroom, helping with chores... you know the normal things family gets up to...."
"Well done Otiz why don't you sit with Hadrian while I go check everything" and he placed the boy on top his son's lap.
"Dad gave us some money but I don't want you to go over the top and spend it all here" this made Otiz nod to him, transform into his teenage form and left them to have a look around.
Lucius had come to his room that very evening to tell him what had happened.. what he wasn't unsympathetic as many may think he was but what Lucius was met with afterwards was unheard of!
It was finally time for Harry to get onto the train, they had floo'd over to platform 9 3/4 where his friends were waiting for him Crabbe and Goyle had gone ahead to get a compartment and save another for the three friends and Otiz.
That brat is sitting right there are next to the greasy head ingrate as well as that thing they call an attorney".
They were about to leave when yet again Harry was caught wandering off into a pet shop of all things, Severus following behind him wondering what had yet again attracted the boy and when he saw said boy holding onto a powered baby blue cat like thing with beaming emerald green eyes, so much like Harry's and Lilly's something clicked within him, he knew this store it was a store that dealt with familiars.
After lunch Tom really thought that letting Harry pick anything sugary was a bad idea as both him and Otiz were now completely hyperactive and would not stop running off to look around but he was glad that Severus had seen what was going to happen and so placed a location spell on both of them so they could find them if somehow they got lost, but knowing Otiz he wouldn't let that happen even if he was now a six year old.
Everything was set and easy to go, Fred had somehow convinced three of the house elves to put several potions into different food and drink while George had managed to place many different time delay fireworks and fire crackers around the school nowhere was off limits in their books.
Older sister- Rebecca Skye Anderson, 15 years old, black hair and honey coloured eyes. She is Ron's new older sister and twin sister of Jessica. Sporty and out going as well and loves to bully Ron/Max. She thinks he is crazy and doesn't waste a moment to rub it in, hair in braid that hangs down her back. AKA Becca
"Will I have to go back to them and Gryffindor??" he asked quietly making his father turn to him and smiled slightly, "no child you do not, you will stay here in the snakes den and with me" and he bought Harry onto his lap and they both relaxed into silence.
Then he spotted Tom, his brown eyes sparkling at what he was seeing, a hybrid familiar and one that belonged to the Boy Who Lived!
"Go sit down next to Mr. Snape and if you're a good boy you might get a sticker" said Minerva and with a flick of her wand another chair was placed next to Harry as well as some colouring books and crayons.
Everyone stopped once they heard soft snores coming from their Head of House, thinking that it was Otiz they looked but they were caught by bright glowing eyes at them, they then looked at the black haired child, Harry was sleep.
"I never knew..............." said Draco now feeling so guilty that he had picked and bullied the poor boy, he didn't know what to say or do to help the situation that was now on his plate.
"And who might you be young man? I have never see you before at Hogwarts" questioned Albus but Otiz just ignored him and turned to the other two.
Severus did as he was told and once the blood of both of them was in the goblet Griphook started chanting making the goblet glow, he then handed it over to Harry so then he could drink it.
"What have you done to his office I demand you put it back to the way it was right now!" demanded Hermione to Tom but he ignored her.
Ginny's hair was now snot green it even felt like it which made her almost throw up due to it all, Ron was fuming and when he saw his brother's he went right up to them demanding that they change Ginny's hair back.
"Hello and welcome, what can I do for you fine gentlemen today?" asked the jeweller he seemed nice enough which put Harry at ease, "I would like the necklace with the three tear drops on please" he said just loud enough to be heard.
The date is set and I hope that you can have someone cover for you during the meeting. I would hate for this school to fall further down the ladder than it already has thanks to that old man".
Sirius and Remus stood off to the side slightly so not over whelm him like last time and they got "punished" in Harry's eyes of no chocolate and being trapped in Animagus form for a week, Harry was talking to Draco's friends Theo and Blaise jumping on the balls of his feet that was until he noticed Ginny in the background holding onto some luggage not saying anything, she was in a plain grey dress, hair in a bun she was looking at the floor.
Do not fear son, everything will work out I assure you on this, but I would like to ask you another question if that is alright with you on this matter?" Harry just nodded mouth full of pancake smiling slightly.
Everyone in close proximity moved away from him and then started to completely ignore him, shunning him as they did. They didn't want to be anywhere near him!
"I'm sorry Maxwell but your parents phoned ahead again saying that your were struggling and can't remember again so... as you know I'm here to help you with your day to day routine" said the person when he finally looked at them.
"Harry, Harry it's me Sirius, you should remember..." he was cut of by one Remus Lupin hitting him and Otiz biting his leg.
They looked again and it seemed that it had eating it's fill as was now looking at Draco and if it could smile it did.
Otiz had fire coming out of his mouth and shot it towards them, with that they fled from the compartment only to in counter Marcus Flint.
"Oh I got him in the pet shop that deals with familiars, we were looking for the last Christmas present for Bill Weasely when I ended up in there, the teller said he was two Japanese demons. A Bakeneko a Japanese cat demon and a Kitsune a Japanese fox demon, he's very rare and the teller said that no one beside me has been allowed near him" finished Harry only to sigh when Draco put him in checkmate again.
As she came into the library Madam Pince sneered and said "you young lady I want to see you at all times, no going to the back, you are to stay here and study I don't want my books to disappear!".
Harry waited with baited breath as he really wanted to go to the Weasley's but with how Ron had been treating him since he got resorted it was hard, he knew he should say something but it was hard, he knew nothing would hurt him his dad would be there, he just didn't want Molly and Arthur knowing what their son had done to him.
"Hello Miss Lovegood how have you been?" asked Theo as he sat down next to her while the rest of his friends went to a different table not wanting to be near Luna much less Hermione, the out cast.
As you can see within the file the abuse he suffered from the time he was with his ex relatives all the way up to to last year when he was adopted not once did Mister Dumbledore check on young Mister Snape.
"Otiz it's ok they are my god parents, uncle Luc and aunt Cissa, they aren't going to hurt me, promise" said Harry to his familiar who in turn sniffed them both and then licked them which didn't please Lucius at all but once it was explained to them that Otiz was Harry's familiar they left it alone.
Broken and dislocated shoulder, elbow and ankle, burn to arm and back, malnutrition, dehydrated, lacerations to back and anus
With a look of disgust Harry looked at him with a glare that just made him smile more "eat that Harry and then it's time for class" so Severus went back to the staff table.
"Are you alright young man?" trying to get Harry to talk to him but he just hid more, making Severus sigh.
"Albus please get on with why you have asked my son to come here now or we will leave and I will inform the Ministry about this all" again Severus snapped at the Headmaster.
"My office now all of you, Mr. Malfoy go and get Madam Pomfrey, tell her that someone has been injured and that they are in my office" Draco ran off right away.
Severus signed and kept rubbing his son's back to comfort him, "Misters Zabini and Malfoy I would like you to ask that you take my son to the hospital wing to get his elbow checked and twenty points to Slytherin for helping a fellow student".
As the ride took off with the twins, Charlie and Tonks on board as well none of them noticed a certain blond Aristocrat on the ride as well, the had left his cane on the railing making the rest believe that he was down with them until...
If you hadn't of guessed she isn't smart at all. Since her wand got taken away from her the magic that it was stealing from Harry has stopped so she has only the intelligence of what a seven year old would have.
Tom just laughed at this making both men turn to him with a look of horror, they had no clue that Harry was now with Severus so this was going to be fun when he told them about it all.
A howl sounded making Hermione shut up for a change and go completely still something or someone was close by, she wanted someone to hold her like her mum did when she was little when she had bad dreams.
Lucius and Narcissa looked at their son knowing that he had a lot of thinking to do on his part and hopefully both of the boys would try and form some sort of friendship as the school year continued.
The fox was protecting his cub and his mate his beautiful loving mate was protecting something strange and stupid and he snarled at it, her, what ever it was.
"I can understand this is also a shock to you as well, as no one knew what was going to happen after I was called into Dumbledore's office and told to check on Hadrian here" there was a slight thump to his side and it looked like Harry was sleeping but he knew better than to sleep when this was happening.
"You're a fake Headmaster, professor Dumbledore is a much better Headmaster than you'll ever be it would be better if you just leave" shouted Hermione at Tom but he ignored her.
Severus could tell Tom was trying to butter him up badly he had asked the elves to make his favourite food, everything there he loved, he knew Tom didn't like them much but the way he was doing this it was starting to get hard not to forgive him.
I know people, I know but with the other stories I liked either Harrison or Hadrian for his new name but he will still be called Harry either way. I was thinking of taking James out of his name but I thought against it so I just edited his name instead.
He sniffed again and this time purred and brought himself as close to Remus as possible within the tiny space between them, he purred again and then in a instant he was human again.
"Thank you Otiz" said Theo to him slightly shocked by what had happened, within seconds Otiz hand changed into his child from and had squeezed himself between Blaise and Theo sitting happily there lending into Theo as he went back to reading his book.
"Well Miss Granger, I would like you to explain what these items on my desk..." she pointed to the parchments and quills that belog to Hermione "...that belong to you and that you have been using them for unlawful means. Please do care to explain yourself" said Minvera.
"Welcome students, I know the term is coming to an end in the next couple of weeks but I would like to welcome you all to a new year, I do hope I can live up to your expectations of a acceptable Headmaster in the next coming weeks.
As the two was talking they were joined by Pansy, Blaise and Theodore and the five of them stared into the fire for a few more minutes until it was time to finally leave for the summer holidays, thank Merlin he had packed the night before last, he didn't want to forget anything, like Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were right now.
"Idiot I explained everything to you when I found out it was you in Tomas' office that day, Severus adopted Hadrian..."
Everyone else headed to their next lesson which happened to be potions with one dungeon bat, the Griffindor and Slytherin going as one, it looked like the two houses might just be starting to get along for once.
"I'm not crazy!" was all Ron said to them still standing in the doorway, he didn't know these people, so why should he do anything that they wanted.
Remus looked up and saw them "should we stop them?" he pointed to the group and everyone looked up and laughed.
"I found Hadrian beaten and bloody, he had many broken bones and lacerations, scars and bruises all in different stages of healing many were infected, it took us most of the summer to get him to what Poppy would say was a reasonable state of health even though he still has to take a nutrition potion three times a day.
"Hadrian can you choose something for me please this nice man has offered to buy you something due to what he happened.
"Ah refreshments at last" said Lucius as a house elf popped in with the drinks and said to them that dinner will be ready in half an hour.
Harry had finally fallen asleep Otiz keeping watch but soon dozed off as well, this made everyone else looked towards the potions professor all asking the same thing 'what on Earth happened to them' and so Severus told them everything.
"I'm Hermione Granger, the smartest witch around, hey are you even listening to me?, I'm a third year if you would of had a guess you would of known and one of the best there is, will you stop ignoring me?!" she turned to Sirius as he was looking around making sure that Remus hadn't followed him into the forest but knowing his luck he would.
Fudge thanked them and let them be on their way, Harry shaking all the way. They had been in Fudge's office for three hours.
"He looks fine from what I can tell but Hagrid would be better at this than me, mind you Tom is better at the basilisk front" and she smiled "we will have to wait until he's changed back before I can run any tests" and she pottered off back into her office to wait.
"What the hell?" screamed Draco making Harry flinch, "sorry Hadrian I didn't mean to make you jump" said Draco more quietly.
Draco's eyes lit up he had a feeling he knew where they were going he hadn't been to that place since he was a little child, he must of been about six the last time be was there Lucius had started to get busy with work so they could go much anymore so if he was right he would love to go again and this time to share it with Harry!
"Who is that anyway?" asked Pansy coming up to Draco to make sure that her arm was wrapped around his.
There the good was happily sitting there talking away, with a soft whistle Otiz perked up making his ears and tail appear and then without hurt Lucius or Tom he jumped into the air and landed on his feet and then ran up to Harry and Draco.
"That was what we call an Animagus which means animal transformation, it takes many years to train for this but it can be done mine is a cat but there are many different types".
"No!" this brought Tom back to the present and he smiled a true smile while Lucius held onto the small boy who was shaking in fear but truth be told Otiz was trying so hard not to laugh.
"Ron, Hermione, Ginny please you don't know what has happened to me, you were invited to Professor Snape's quarters so then we could discuss this but I don't think it will happen now" said Harry as he saw his father walk in with Draco.
"I was thinking London first then Diagon Alley afterwards if we cant find what we are looking for" finished Severus having Harry again nod to him, he wasnt in a talking mood really.
The following day Arthur had left and Molly called for Ginny to come down which she did with great reluctance.
"Molly I think we leave Ginevra somewhere where she can't get into trouble and away from us for the two weeks but still here" said Arthur to his wife as he got up from the bench and grabbed hold of his once daughter and brought her to stuff members at the front of the theme park so then they could put her to work.
"Later Otiz you've just had breakfast and before that we have to go shopping and then after lunch you can have a blood pop" said Harry to the hyperactive child.
If that was true why was she given something that a seven year old could work out? What were they thinking?
Ginny tried to say something but was cut off by her mother, "I thought I told you not to say anything unless it was a 'yes'" and she started eating her dinner while talking to Arthur about his day and after she had left.
HE HAS DONE NOTHING FOR YOU TO DO THIS TO HIM, ALL HE WANTS IS A FAMILY AND AFTER WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE READ FROM THE REPORTS THAT WE WERE ALLOWED TO READ, WITH PERMISSION I MIGHT ADD, I WOULD THINK BETTER ABOUT WHAT YOU TWO ARE DOING TO THE POOR BOY!
Everything she had was now something for a child, thank Merlin her school books hadn't changed much but there were charms so them she couldn't tamper with it.
It had been a month since Hermione was in isolation and Hogwarts had become a peaceful place even though Tom was there aka Lord Voldemort but he was behaving so....
"Yes we can but I will remind you that we are spending Christmas day together you aren't getting out of that. I shall write to them as well as the Malfoy's to ask when we can come over to celebrate" and with that Severus grabbed some parchment and started writing, once he was done he handed the Malfoy's to his Raven Tyki and the Weasley's to Hedwig and they both flew off.
Everyone was at dinner for the night after a week of getting back into the whole 'school is important and make sure you study' crap that was now the norm after two luxurious weeks of pure bliss, most of his dorm mates hadn't even completed their Christmas homework and were now rushing to finish it as it was all due in this week.
"By confusing one boy and he other is practically out of his seat with excitement, you mean dear?" he points to the boys.
"Otiz calm the hell down you almost attacked poor Theo!" said Harry when he walked into the dorm room seeing the pacing familiar.
She looked at her wand and cast a Tempus charm and saw that she only had another fifteen minutes before end of class for the day.
Harry was enjoying his time with his friends in Hogsmeade when Otiz changed into his teenage form and was met by Fawkes sitting on his shoulder and the two began to talk to each other like they hadn't seen each other in years, good friends through and through.
Remus and Severus entered the Slytherin common room and was assaulted by a black blob only to be followed by a small blue haired boy.
She shall not harm you! Not in my watch!" hissed Otiz to Harry who only sighed and then flicked his nose causing him to whimper, he hated when he did that to him.
It was a week into the summer holidays and Severus had decided to take Harry out for the day in London for some father and son time sadly Otiz would have to stay home due to what he was.
Narcissa ask Harry if he was happy being with Severus and how he had gained Otiz how the rest of the school has reacted to him but it wasn't Harry that answered it was Otiz.
"Harry why in Merlin's name are you with the snakes of all thing! You are a Gryffindor, not a slimy snake!! Come back to where you belong, back with your true friends!" Harry sat there just looking at him saying nothing.
"Thank you Mister Snape, that is most helpful I can gather a lot more information on this in my own time, think of it if you will a project of my very own.
I was locked in the cupboard under the stairs for ten years it was only before I started that I got that sorry excuse of a cousin's second bedroom, which they did so many things to me!
"I think I lost my hair tie but oh well" everyone looked at him like he had grown a second head but stopped when they heard someone being ill.
When he is 14 he has something of a stoic attitude but he is trying to keep his animal under wraps even though everyone knows about, he doesn't want to transform for no good reason like he does when he's 6.
"How long has she been going so far today?" asked Katie Bell only to have Cormac Mc Laggen reply with "three hours so far".
He walked up to a desk and demanded to talk to Cornelius Fudge right away saying that it was to do with the old coot at the school, he knew Fudge would come right away just to get some dirt of the man and as Severus was a very close friend of the Malfoy's, he knew that at any moment he would be diving into Lucius' pockets.
Otiz only calmed down slightly now that he knew why he didn't like this place if Harry was upset, he wanted to protect him and by Merlin he would.
"Draco the guests are coming you know every well but the other you have only know for a year or more, I would like you to be respectful of both of them. I would hate to hear from our guests that you haven't behaved like a Malfoy should" said his father making him gulp.... who could these guest be??
"Hadrian come now, we know what has happened it wasn't your fault my son. You are no longer Harry Potter, you are and for ever be Hardian Jameson Severus Snape my son".
This year we will be learning about the Lapifors spell that turns the person into a rabbit, the hardening charm as well as the Animagus spell that will help you turn into an animal of your choice..." and she transformed into her cat form.
Minerva looked at her and said "Miss Granger I would like to remind you Mister Potter is now Mister Snape and I have been told that Otiz here is his familiar and familiar's are allowed no matter what they are. I think he's a hybrid animal anyway".
The barrier also had a silencing charm weaved into it so no one could hear her but she could hear them and it also had a spell weaves into it that once called by anyone of her family she would be forced to go to them.
"Poor Potter scared? Jumping like that is not how a Gryffindor is meant to act!! You're acting like some Hufflepuff not a Gryffindor at all" laughed one of the females to him.
He wanted to make amends fully for bullying him the first year and partly of this year as well and by Merlin he was going to do that. His friend was Hadrian "Haddy" Snape, nothing more nothing less.... He was a no longer Harry Freakin Golden Boy Saviour of the Wizarding World Potter!
"Me always can!" cheered the little boy, making the man stop down the hall shocked, why hadn't he transformed before?
Harry was still behind him, holding desperately to him, he hated seeing the Dursley's here but he couldn't get out of it.
Harry sat in his dark room crying from yet another beating from his abusive uncle, Vernon Dursley. All of a sudden Vernon burst through Harry's bedroom door. "Oh, just shut up FREAK!" Harry could only nod and whisper "yes sir". Harry's bright forest green eyes were red and puffy, his uncle only kicked him once more then stalked out of the room leaving Harry on the cold and darkened room. While Harry was trying to stop his head from pounding, he could hear his uncle outside of his room putting up many different locks.
"Well from what the Weasely's have said about it is that they have only five sons, the have said that they are looking after a Squib called Ginerva and that you are on longer welcome at their home.
As he was just standing there he didn't notice that someone was at his door again, it wasn't until she hummed that he turned around to face her.
As they landing after the Portkey which Harry held on for dear life Severus greeted some of the others that where waiting for them, he spotted the Malfoys right away and whispered to Harry that Draco were there which made the boy perk up more even if he was still looking very green.
He was now seething in his office marking essays and drinking some fire whiskey and trying to drown out his worries and trying desperately not to cry.
Molly nodded at her and saying nothing to her, grabbed hold of her and Floo'ed to Diagon Alley for the morning to get some new clothes and dinner for tonight.
"Ah Severus, Hadrian welcome" said Lucius to them asking them to take a seat, Harry shying away from them the moment he felt people watching him, Severus sat down on the sofa that Draco had been sitting on but vacated right away when Severus came though the Floo.
"Trying to scare uncle Luc into going onto some rides and knowing Sirius would love them as he had told them about his magical motorbike that flew and could go invisible at a push of a button, it was then the Slytherin children as well as two Gryffindor's started planning.
"What did you do this time Otiz?" asked Lucius who was now holding the boy who snuggled into to him.
"Otiz you know that it's bad to destroy the house right?" asked Severus to the small boy, placing him on his feet and standing up as they walked out of the room.
"Please don't shout Harry I'm sitting right in front of you. Yes I would like Lucius and Narcissa to be your godparents, you and Draco will have to find some common ground to start a new. You both love to play Quidditch, how about going from there, perhaps it might become a friendship in the future" and Severus got up and left the table leaving Harry slightly shocked that his enemy would in fact in days would be his god brother!
"Oi Potter get the hell up!!" yelled the male voice to him making him jump sky high making the three laugh.
Everyone was trying to listen and to perform the Porcupine to Pin cushion spell but it wasn't working even if they managed to get the pronounce it correctly.
One weekend, Harry sat at the table watching his now 'Father' cook a light breakfast for Harry and a heartier one for himself at Spinner's End where they had spent the first few weeks getting to know each other more than anything, Severus had to put everything he thought Harry would be like his father James to the very back of his mind and tried to remember that Harry was and had been abused by his filthy muggle family.
"Who else who pull something like this, we have better things to do then something like this, we have O.W.Ls next year" they said together.
As they are Severus was debating whether to forgive him or not all the while listening to what was being said to him by Tom or at least he was trying to that is.
"Mister Weasley, you are the first person of this school year that has detention with me 7pm if you will, straight after dinner, if you please".
He sat like for most of breakfast and only looked up when Severus tapped him on his shoulder "Hadrian, Harry come on son you need to eat something" and he smiled ever so slightly.
Theo as he liked to be called was very calm and didn't really like conflict like Harry was now, they both loved to read, Harry had gotten more relaxed into his new life. He would spend hours with Theo than the rest of them but he wouldn't be without any of them.
He lashed out making Sirius jump to the side to avoid being attacked and hit by those claws he wore, Hermione wasn't so lucky, she clutched her arm from where he had swiped out to protect Sirius.
"Draco what is the meaning of this?" asked Severus to the blonde boy after being attacked by his son and brought into a hug.
The six friends where shocked at what they had seen, Ronald Weasely was on the floor unconscious of all things thanks to this new.... somewhat familiar person.
"Thank you Mink, could I also get some raw meat please" asked Otiz to the elf and he nodded and disappeared and reappeared quickly.
Since his panic attacks had got slightly worse than normal he had to have check up with Poppy and then some one on one time with Severus twice a week to make sure he was coping with everything but sadly that was all going to change.
"Miss Granger please sit, we have a lot to discuss and I like to get this done before dinner tonight" said Minerva as she motioned for the second year to sit down in the chair in front of her desk.
"I have the evidence that you have been adopted and that you are now going under your new name but I would need more expensive information and evidence about everything that had been written down in your file.
"Really dad? We have been out most of the day and we come back only to find out that you three have been drinking!"
"He's fine just slightly confused as to why it's happening but he perfectly ok so don't worry too much" said Tom placing his hand on Harry, feeling the warmth coming off him.
He threw a fit causing all of the paper on his desk to fly everywhere but to everyone here it seemed the norm for him and so no one said anything, his teacher came over.
"Yes you stupid elf I'm the smartest witch around and I demand that you get me something that will test me in my knowledge!" she screamed at him, he popped away due to his nerves.
Hermione looked at her and knew that if she kept putting it off she would most likely be expelled from Hogwarts and she didn't want that to happen, Hogwarts was the best thing that ever happened to her, she didn't want to go back to her boring muggle life, back to being normal.
He turned round in his fathers lap and smiled slightly at Griphook and the nodded at the question, meaning that everything was fine.
"Lu-Lu.. I wanna sits wif you" and he climbed up onto his lap and started to making the staff laugh at him, while Lucius blushed at what he was being called.
"Dad please!!" said Harry to him and once the fire whiskey was brought to him he let it sit on the table.
"Ah Harry my boy do come in, oh Severus I didn't know you would be joining us, I only asked for young Mister Potter" said Albus.
Harry's gifts consisted of some new robes from Narcissa which were emerald green to match his eyes with the Potter crest on them, from Draco he got a broom cleaning kit as well as some owl treats for Hedwig and some sweets, Lucius had sent a photo of all five of them together along with some parchment and new quills. From Severus he got some owl treats again, another set of robes and some sweets.
((Another filler chapter sorry guys but I thought you would like an insight of Ron's new life as Maxwell and how he deals with everything that's changed, he's now a Squib and lives with his new Muggle family called the Anderson's))
"Date, I know he likes chocolate, potion ingredients might work also. Not sure but if he's annoyed when oven done something I say sorry and give him a bar of his favourite chocolate and then he's fine".
Hadiran's familiar Otiz is very protective of him and won't let anyone he deems untrustworthy near him, Otiz is a hybrid; Kitsune and a Bakeneko which is a a fox demon and a twin tailed cat demon.
"No I don't remember you and I would say that my name is now Hadrian Severus Jameson Snape, as of August before my second year, my god parents are Narcissa and  Lucius Malfoy as well as Molly and Arthur Weasley I don't even know you!"
If you are worried about Otiz there, he won't be allowed to be removed as he is your familiar and the Ministry of Magic can't do anything about it as forcefully removing him will most likely kill you both, sadly" she sighed but then smiled at him.
Quietly the hospital doors opened to reveal two red heads and a bushy brown head, they all peeked in looking for someone they knew to be there. It was lunch time anyway and they could always say that they were just visiting no harm in that right??
Fred, George, Percy, Charlie, Bill, Molly, Arthur, Neville, Luna, Draco, Blaise, Pansy, Theo, Lucius and Narcissa Severus and Harry but with his lisp, when he was human, it was funny how he tried to pronounce their names. ((A/n list will be below))
Harry's magic reacted to Otiz's wish and magic started to swirl around all three of them but mostly around Harry.
Ron layed his head against the window of the car and sighed, this place was so different then he was used to, his missed his mum, dad, his older brothers yes Percy was arrogant but he still loves him, the twins were another story really but he knew they cared for him wholeheartedly, Ginny he was meant to protect as her older brother that was his job! Just like the rest of them!
Oi Snape, you and me wizard duel by the freaking Whomping Willow tonight at 7 we will see who wins this battle after what you did to me and my sister. You will regret what you did to us Weasely's!
"Fine I can't do that one I'll try another work sheet and.... where's my wand? I need to look for it otherwise Professor Dumbledore will have my neck for it, he made sure that I got this wand when he picked me up from home and took me to Ollivanders!
"Dad I think something went wrong, when I put my glasses on I can't see a thing do you think I could get a new pair?" asked Harry to his father as he took off the spell which was keeping his food warm.
The feast had come to end and everyone had headed off to bed, both Severus and Remus weren't happy about being called to his office but as he was in charge they had to go, Otiz as still completely out cold.
"Hagrid got all the information facts wrong about Otiz and what he is and so is in a bad mood over it all".
"I'm sorry sir but I remember at the beginning of the year he got resorted as his name has changed as his father wanted it" he said confidently to the enraged Professor.
I would have to be up at the crack of dawn to start on my chores even before I went to school, I would have to cook their meals and while they ate I was thrust back into the cupboard until they are done.
Draco took it upon himself to grab hold of his hand, noticing the flinch right away, and pulled him towards the stairs leading down into the dorms.
"You two are stupid" said Ginny making Ron agree with her with a mouth full of cereal, but he was staring across the hall to one green eyed, spectacled young boy who was sat between Draco and Blaise.
Severus was sitting in his chair, nursing a fire whiskey and trying not to snap at the little boy making a complete mess of his once clean house. Everything and I mean everything had been pulled out examined and then thrown as far as the little could throw.
"Harry come and sit down, please. We have to talk about everything that has happened as well as the adoption if that's ok with you?" asked Severus making Harry to move from the door and to the spare chair next to him.
She sighed and took a calming breath and sighed a little, a house elf brought in some tea for Severus and Minerva while they brought pumpkin juice for the boys and a bowl of blood for Otiz.
I'm also a Kitsune which is a Japanese fox demon, they are intelligent beings and they possessing abilities which only increase with age.
Once everyone was downstairs and having their morning cup of coffee and tea but as they drunk they all noticed something strange Harry wasn't there..
"Hadrian son, I know you never had much growing up with those muggles but I thought it would be a great chance for you to experience something wonderful and oh so magical, not in the sense of magic but you will see what I mean when we get there honest.
"Tev, Hadwin sads" said Otiz clinging to Severus' robes not wanting to be near anyone besides who he would consider his father figure.
"Dad I think he would also need some toy's as well to keep him occupied for a while so then I can do my summer homework, you can do you lesson plans and potions and hopefully not trash the house again" and he laughed.
"So Poppy hasn't told you then? Well I was informed just recently that Mister Potter's household currently at the residence of 4 Privet Drive is unsafe for the child. Albus he is a young boy soon to be a second year at that! He has been abused since he was three years old".
"So Potter. Severus wanted me to come and talk to you about what's happened" said Draco but Harry said nothing to him only hummed.
Without warning Harry had his hand in Otiz' hair making them both calm, right away his ears appeared and he was purring, this made everyone in the common room smile, the hybrid had finally relaxed.
"Hadrian who's that in your arms?" asked Draco as he came to greet his friend, eye brow raised in the typical Malfoy fashion.
Severus led him to one of the chairs in the office and both of them sat down. "Albus I am here as Hadrian has asked me to come along as his Head of House as well as his father" sneered Severus to the Headmaster.
"Pup who is this?" asked Remus to them and Harry looked towards them and then at Otiz who was scowling into his drink making it bubble and hiss.
You Dumbledore have broken so many taboos so many laws that we at the Ministry find you guilty and you will be sent to Azkaban for the remainder of your life if in the lowest levels you will only have very slight contact with the dementors if they so wish it" and with that Dumbledore was taken away.
After about ten minutes of waiting Harry was scooped up by twin red heads..... the Weasely's had arrived.
"I don't care who it is I would like to take on full responsibility over Harry and Harry has agreed as well, I don't want him going back to those.... those.... monsters!" sneered Severus to Griphook making Harry curl into himself, he hated shouting at the best of times.
By dinner that night everyone had enough of her but there was nothing they could do for her, she wouldn't listen to them, it was so bloody annoying!
"Please just stop, all three of them know each other, Lucius and my father are old housemates and the new Headmaster has known them since they left school" explained Harry to them.
"Well they look happy" said Pansy as she had finally hooked her arm around Harry's as he was busy looking in a store window, not really caring as he had seen those two talk quite often.
"Albus please, Mr. Sötétség, I apologise for his rudeness towards you, you are an outstanding lawyer as well as an exceptional Headmaster from what the students and staff have to say about you, and we are finally getting the paper work that had been missing for ten years and with that I thank you".
She was so full of herself that most of the other houses stayed away from her the only ones to stay were Ron and Hermione.
Soon they had ordered their food and were waiting for them, only Otiz something sitting on Draco's head.
"Misters Headmasters said to Fraggale that yous can haves this book, wills help yous" she said placing it down and took her finished work and left a light snack on the table and fresh water and disappeared again.
"Hardian my boy, my son don't listen to what that old coot says, you will never be going back to them, you are my son from the moment I rescued you from them ok" and he hugged him tightly.
"She did nothing wrong... those two must of slipped somthing into her food" yelled Hermione so everyone could hear her which wasn't hard as she was screaming like a Banshee.
Spotting Theo right away he walked up to the group of friends, Theo flinched thinking that Otiz was going to hurt him but what came out of the familiars mouth was different.
"I think we have to stop the shopping while we grab a drink and talk" said Severus to them and then turned to Harry more and got down to his level.
"Hadwin me go back to Wolfie man now...bye bye" said Otiz getting off his lap and up to Remus again, who this time didn't protest about the small boy sitting on his lap.
"They got thrown up there and Hadrian and Otiz were helping me get them down when you pushed him over".
"Ok let's get dad's new quill and me some for me as well and hopefully someone doesn't eat them again" said Harry while he glared at Otiz when he said the last part who just smiled at him the best he could in animal form.
His nose picked up on something which he didn't like... he sniffed again and then growled making everyone look towards him, his emerald green eyes flashing to a red colour and then his ears popped out of nowhere making everyone jump.
"Severus thank you for knocking some sense into that boy, he only thinks of himself and we are to blame for the whole thing, we never thought something like this would happen but sadly it did" said Lucius after a House Elf brought in more tea and a thin blanket for Harry as he was now spread out on the sofa with his head in Severus' lap.
"Close you mouths before flies get trapped!" said now a very bored Otiz to them as he again played with his wand like a cheerleader with a baton.
Tom hold up her recent papers and see that most if not all of them is marked in red meaning that there was more mistakes than normal even for her!
"Can you put that thing outside my office, it would make this whole conversation worth while" said Albus.
"Hadrian what are they saying do you know?" asked his father but Harry just smiled up at his father saying nothing he was in his element really.
He was bombarded by Harry right away crying loudly into his chest "thank you Draco, you can go back to bed now I have this. We will see you in the morning" and with that the door closed and Draco headed back to bed.
Vernon turned a violent purple and Severus thought he was about to die due to blood loss as well as air but he just screamed at him instead.
A nice little chat with our favourite Charms professor and a little more depth into what Otiz really is
Severus quite shocked by the boys action's, he could only hug Harry back and whisper soft words of reassurance, once Harry had calmed down he stepped back and looked at his professor. "I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to" Harry whispered. "Harry it's fine. The reason I'm here is to take you out of this household, but before I do I have one question" Severus stated, Harry only nodded.
"Thank you for having us and I'll make sure that we visit again" said Severus as he tightly held Harry as Otiz was in the middle so then he wouldn't get left behind and they were off.
Easter was here, Harry was happy and finally enjoying another holiday, he was getting eggs left, right and centre and he was giving his friends some back as well... with the help from Severus of course.
Afterwards it as time for presents, Harry was apprehensive about the whole thing but was happy enough, Otiz was almost calm but not calm enough for Severus' liking but it would do for now.
"Did Sir's have a good look around the resort? Is there anything we as the staff help you with?" asked Nairi to them but Harry only shook his head and smiled towards her.
A whine caught his attention as a yet black Grimm put his head on his lap wondering why he was in a foul mood, yes he was human as they had come, he was rescued from that place and brought here by Tom to look out for his pup but he knew something was wrong with Tom.
He thought for a moment and a name popped into his head "Coco, your name will be Coco" he said and the magic flashed brightly bonding the two together.
"Tuney really do you have to make a scene like this?" he asked her, yes he didn't like her but this was her nephew of all things. He might of been adopted and then blood adopted but he was still her nephew either way.
"Lucius your didn't have to really, I am quite capable to look after us without the need of house elves" said Severus to his long time friend.
"You didn't have to do anything like that, he didn't want to fight or argue at that point he... we just wanted to go to class but you didn't let us" finished Draco as he was trying to calm Harry down.
Draco was more like a brother that he never had, yes they still bickered but nothing like they did before. Pansy motherhened him really making sure he ate the right amount and his school clothes were neat and tidy and his homework was done.
"We went to the Muggle zoo in London and that's where we saw them, I had left Otiz at home due to his fur colour, we didn't know he could become human.... Ouch!"
"...this will all come about and end but as I can see it , it might just be for a few days at least" again he looked at the twins wondering what they were planning next.
"I can't believe they did this" moaned Draco as he was now sporting a pair of antlers which were snow white with silver tips to match his hair and eyes.
Colin Creevey sighed more than anyone as it was him, the poor boy, that she had been shouting at trying to make him help her by booting out Tom.
"Nothing really I just wanted to inform you that o have been spotting a rather large dog around Hogwarts lately and I wonder if it was dangerous or not for it to be roaming free?"
Ginny tried to leave but every time she as stopped! Why in Merlin's name couldn't she get out of her room, she just screamed trying to get her mother's attention but it seemed that wasn't going to work either.
He was about to yank him up when he was stopped by Draco "what in Merlin's name are you doing to Hadrian??" once he was close enough.
"So he finally let you out of the time out corner" laughed the friends making both Harry and Otiz blush.
Werewolf Remus looked at them, stroking them but turned away when he heard a howl, this made Otiz change form as well wondering where the noise was coming from, he wanted to follow but Harry's hand was in his fur tightly so he stayed.
Within no less than five minutes the Dursley's were yet again upon them, Harry tried to hide in his father's side while Severus straightened his back, even though he was sitting down he was still rather intimidating to say the least.
"I know right Becky, it was so cute" and they left after shouting him to get up if not a bucket of freezing cold water would rain down on him.
Otiz just growled at the two but did nothing more, he so wanted to snap at Ron as he walked passed making sure he bumped right into Harry making him fall but Harry just said "I'm fine don't worry".
It had been only a week since the court case against Dumbledore was brought to order and he was infuriated and I mean infuriated!!
Harry said nothing and continued to eat some toast and butter as he had filled up on bacon and eggs before his whole resorting.
"WHAT THE HELL!" screamed Draco making everyone look at him, "why is Potter here of all things? Uncle Sev please tell me you didn't adopt him??"
Otiz was given some raw meat that Severus had brought with him so them he wasn't left out, he munched happily and came up to Molly for a scratch behind his ears.
I have heard something's that have been happening at school but I'm not a hundred percent sure if they are true or not if they are true but with how Hadrian acted when Ron walked in I'm inclined to say that it's true.
Severus slowly crept into the house, he slowly went up the stairs, every one with a louder creek. Once he was at the top of the stairs he looked at the four doors that seemed to open, all except once. The last door, at the end of the hallway, was closed and locked from the outside. He rushed to the locked door, still being quiet as a mouse and once again whispered "Alohomora" all the locks unlocked.
Blind hatred keyed to Severus Snape (broken), Malfoy family (broken) Slytherin House (partly broken), Goblin's (broken... AN thought it would be funny)
Severus went over to Lucius and said "keep him here for the time being and then once this is over we will be heading over to Gringotts to get everything sorted" and with that he left the boy with his godparents and walked over to Vernon.
He slowly opened the door, only to be hit with the smell of blood, he looked around the room but it was too dark to see. "Lumos" he whispered, he gasped in shock at the sight in front of him. Harry lay bloody and bruised in a small corner of the room. Severus could hear a faint whimper coming from the boy. He walked closer only for Harry to flinch away and whisper "I'm sorry sir, I'll be more quiet. Please sir I won't disobey you again. Just don't hit me" Severus could only stare at the boy in shock.
"I want to go on the Drop Tower, the Smiler and then Saw" said Harry listing off what he wanted to go on, this made Lucius smile while Sirius went green.
Detention will start tonight with Flitch and then every night for the remainder of the year with the professors mentioned including me!" and he hung his head, just wait until he got back at who every did this to him, they would pay dearly!!!
Otiz growled towards the man in the green this made the court flinch they thought he was just a boy someone to help Harry but one look at him fully they knew for a fact a familiar was present in the courtroom a familiar willing to protect willing to die.
Severus finally arrived at Dumbledore's office, he whispered the password "Lemon Drop" before stepping into the office. "Headmaster" Severus started "we need to discuss some things right now!" he snapped. "My dear boy, what can I do for you?" Dumbledore asked as he stared at the Daily Prophet before him. Severus only glared before continuing "are you aware of what is happening in Potter's home?" Severus asked, trying to be civil. "Severus, what is wrong? is Harry alright?" Dumbledore finally looked up with concern lacing his every word. Severus could only close his eyes and remember how his father used to beat him. He quickly snapped out of it only to stare into blue depths of Albus Dumbledore's eyes.
