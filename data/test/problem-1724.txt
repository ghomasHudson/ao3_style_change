“Hermione?” he shouts again. The days have smudged together and Harry realizes he has no idea if it’s a weekday or weekend, if it’s morning, afternoon, or evening. The last time he looked at a clock is ancient history, and he paces through the entrance, the kitchen, the giant dining room table in a daze.
“—typical Draco—”
“Yes, well, it turns out he’s more than willing to connect you with all sort of illegal substances.” Pansy wrinkles her nose, but doesn’t say anything.
Because grey eyes snap up, and Harry doesn’t have time to run. He’s frozen in place. An object at rest in a world without gravity. Draco Malfoy vanished from wizarding society five years ago, and Harry hadn’t stopped him.
“You’ve not forgotten about the musical adjustments you’re going to make, have you?” Pansy asks, dark eyes brimming.
There were so many bodies. Pressed up against each other and moving. Trapped in the pull of a song and a drink.
Hermione laughs and Harry chases the sound, tries to hold it. The collection of people around this table is unlikely—Harry still can’t quite believe how easy it all is. How all it had taken was a bottle of wine and a five-hour game of chess before Ron and Draco were draping their arms around one another, a writhing giggling mess of blond and red hair.
“For dragging someone out of one world and back into our own,” she says, gentle as Hermione can be.
“You can’t change what you did. But you can choose what you do.”
The stranger had trailed his hands down Draco’s arms, had pulled him close and buried his face in Draco’s shoulder, and it had been fine at first. The night air nipped at his neck, but Draco licked into another man’s mouth and forget everything.
“You literally cast a curse on yourself to try and figure out the if your soul was—how did you put it? Irredeemably evil?”
“You’re so fucking hot,” the stranger said, pushing Malfoy roughly against the opposite wall. “No one else out here.” The words were an invitation.
The heavy glass door swings shut and Harry’s safely back in the street. “What a strange man,” Harry mutters. His arms too full for takeaway, Harry heads back in the direction of Draco’s flat. The magic from earlier has melted away, and the streets look dull rather than dappled. Still, the weight in his arms feels significant somehow, and Harry can’t quite bring himself to regret it—no matter how loudly his stomach growls.
“H—Harry. More. Please.”
“With a history of unsavory activities requiring this act of community service as penance?”
“I’m not lying!” Draco looks so upset, his lovely hair matted with the rain and the stress of his hands in it, that Harry wants to believe him.
The years that followed his decision, the certainty that he’d come back wrong. It twists in the clean white air.
“There aren’t any kids,” Harry says, narrowing his eyes, but no one is paying him any mind.
“This can’t be a coincidence.”
“I didn’t picture your flat like this,” Harry says, spotting a few scruffy plants sprawling across the windowsill. A leafy fern cascades over an elaborate sound system.
Hospitals, Harry thinks, cannot sit still. One would assume that, at some point in time, in some tiny square of space, the hospital would settle and the shuddering gasps of trauma and healing would even out. Find stasis.
“Feeling sorry for oneself isn’t really brave,” Draco says and then mutters, “I wish I was brave,” softly.
“Second, please call me Robertson. Everyone does.”
Nothing
“I don’t think a curse can do that either.”
Narcissa approaches the heavy gate announcing the entrance to the Malfoy ancestral holdings, and it swings open to greet her.
Three words that slip in through Draco’s sharp intake of breath and squeeze the chambers of his heart into that shape of Harry’s palm. “You don’t need Yeats when you say things like that,” Draco whispers, and the wind picks up the words and sends them rustling through the fields.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Potter wasn’t done. “Even if you were…” The wind rose, twisted around them, sent shivers cascading across Draco’s flesh. “Even if you’ve fucked up and carry guilt around like some cross to bear.” Harry was so close. Draco could feel the warmth of Harry’s breath on his frozen cheeks. “That doesn’t mean you can’t have nice things.”
“You see, you’re the only one I’ve told, and I’m quite frightened, and I might need someone
“I’m sorry.”
Potter takes an unsteady step away from Draco, shouts something towards the door, startles the world back into its linear progression.
“I don’t even know what that is!”
“I never had—there were no—
, Harry thinks absently,
. “I’m so—” But Emma is stalking away from him and Harry can’t help but smile. He’d wanted to get away from the hero worship; an appropriate level of indignation makes him almost warm and fuzzy.
would stifle the melancholy.
Because here, in the world where Draco was supposed to live, Potter would never want him. It was a clever curse, in that it gave him glimpses of what he could have had, if he were a better person. The answer to
“At work? Doing what?” Harry asks, too tired to be angry, but not so tired that he isn’t irritated.
“Stupid?”
, Draco thinks, pulling his mother tight to his side as the faces start to turn. Two Malfoys, striding up the path to the manor, backs perpendicular to fields of green.
“So,” Ron says, blowing steam off the cup Hermione hands him. “Have you…?” Ron has the audacity to wink at him.
“Positive affirmations are bullshit,” John says, his face washed out by the hospital lights. “In moments like these, anyway.”
“But we’ll be—in front of all those—in front of all wizarding—”
Only now, as they step into the safety of the grounds does his mother finally speak.
“Left me in his fucking flat to show myself out,” Harry says, the memory stinging. “If he’d thought it was a mistake, he should’ve at least said so to my face. It was passive aggressive and a shitty thing to do—”
Draco was not sure what else he was supposed to call him, but he’d nodded sagely. “Of course.”
On a balcony ensconced in wrought iron, above him as they moved together in the half light of an hour so late that it was early, and finally in the middle of a hurried emergency room, where the only thing in the world that mattered was pared down to the single point where green eyes met grey.
he says with his hands.
“Well, I’d be happy to explain right now!”
“I didn’t hate you. Haven’t for a long time,” Harry says, rubbing his nose on his sleeve.
“I’m peeing!” Draco shouted, barely registering how undignified he sounded or how distressed his mother would be to know that the word ‘peeing’ had come out of his mouth.
Draco closes his eyes. Perhaps, if he pretends she isn’t here, if he just ignores the question, maybe everything will disappear.
But then he’s under again, and he’s drowning in Draco’s open mouth kissing the line of his sternum, stripping his own clothes from Harry’s skin, slow, purposeful.
“It’s how I show affection,” Pansy says, and she’s off before anyone can say a word or place an order. No one protests. Pansy’s done this before, and seems to knows what each of them will have to drink before they know themselves.
The wind rises, twists around them, sends shivers cascading across flesh.
“What is that supposed to mean!” Harry says, gesticulating so wildly that the rum drink is sloshing over. “What fucking universes?”
“Harry Potter,” Malfoy says, and Harry feels himself shrink, tries to hide, feels his hand go limp. The skin suit that is Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived feels like ants scrambling across muscle.
Harry thinks as he pushes the curtain back.
As the damp air settles on his tongue, Draco makes a decision. “If you won’t come to me,” he whispers to no one, “then I will come to you.”
Harry hadn’t stopped him.
can tell you if you’re a good person.”
The shadows writhe around them and Draco hangs on to the throb of Harry’s pulse under his thumbs.
“Mate, I never thought I’d have to say this to anyone who wasn’t Mione. But you can’t go out for food and come back with books.”
There’s grit in the line of Harry’s jaw and Draco
“Come on, Potter.” Malfoy tugs him towards a door leading to a balcony and Harry goes. Of course he goes. There’s no resisting Malfoy. There never has been.
The canola rustles behind them. “But you don’t want me,” Draco finally says. “You don’t—"
!” Ron insists, but his body betrays him, shimmying back and forth in his chair.
“We’re going to live,” he whispers and Narcissa pulls him closer.
Anger claws at his throat. And when Potter reveals that he’d been there at the top of the Astronomy tower, Draco can’t bear it. He’s carved his palms open with ragged fingernails.
“This is serious!” says Pansy, and Draco realizes, a bit belatedly, that Pansy is distressed. That she’s barely holding herself together.
“What? No.” Harry had looked at his friends with horror. “You don’t need to cut yourself open.”
On the inside, Harry was a corpse.
Potter closes the distance so fast that Draco doesn’t have time to move away. At first, he’s sure that Potter’s going to hit him and he welcomes the contact. But the blow doesn’t come, and Draco feels Potter place his hand on his elbow.
“Yes, I think we can pull him out,” Hermione says as Harry drifts out of semi-consciousness and back into Draco’s living room. “It would be old magic. A summoning spell. It’s practically Pagan, but I think we can manage with the right preparation.”
“That’s it.”
His mother is crying. She hadn’t cried when they’d returned to the manor, not when they’d moved the bodies out of the basement, not when the Aurors had come for father. Narcissa Malfoy had steeled herself against the aftershocks of a war and
“Fancied a walk?” Draco says.
“You told me you liked it!”
Harry shrugs, still stunned that he’s having this conversation on someone’s stoop.
It’s the giant grandfather clock that drags him back to the present, eleven loud gongs knocking him about the head.
* * *
“We’ve neglected our host,” Draco says, words a bit tight. “Come on.”
“That,” Draco says through gritted teeth, “is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts.”
Harry passes door after door, title after title.
Malfoy’s on the step above him, and Harry finds he’s looking up.
“I can page him,” Emma said, as Harry looked down at the assessments Malfoy had attached to the chart. Five years, and his handwriting was still cramped and neat
“Mint,” Draco says, looking into his own cup. “Makes me feel settled. So I thought—”
“Potter, so help me Merlin—”
Draco assumed that the Ministry would take issue—who in their right minds could ever view time spent in a book shop to be anything but self-serving? The Ministry, however, was not interested in vetting Draco’s choices.
“Why do I get the distinct impression that you are
Harry really hadn’t expected anything to come of it, that day in February five years ago. The wind moved across the snow like a hand drifting over silk when he’d strode up the lane. The air was cool and it bit at Harry’s cheeks, nibbled the corners of his eyes.
“Following you,” says Draco, and the honesty throws Harry.
“Sometimes I think you look for people to blow you to pieces,” this Harry says, and Draco must hear the tremble in his voice, because he rolls over, grimacing in agony.
Harry’s never had turnip.
For a moment, they’d all stood on the precipice of
Hermione had reached across the counter and, with the caution with which one would approach a wild animal, had taken his hand. “I know it is.”
“Fuck,” he says, turning around, looking at all of these pieces of Draco that have been left behind.
Robertson has the gall to roll his eyes.
Malfoy snorts and it’s so undignified that Harry forgets to be angry and just gapes. “Then why, pray tell, are you standing in front of my office?”
“Not really,” Harry relents.
“Liar.” Draco spits the word like poison.
“You look—” Draco starts, but can’t quite articulate the unique twist of desire in his stomach; he feels like he’s fallen from a broom.
Eventually, over a lunch where Hermione ate and Harry lay on his kitchen floor, he said, “I’m a warm body without a soul, Hermione,” and hadn’t had to say anything else because Hermione had understood.
“We’ve evaluated her condition,” the healer is saying. “I’m sorry Mr. Malfoy. There’s nothing that we can do.”
“I’ve…” Draco begins but the words are sticking. “I’ve done something a bit rash.”
, Draco thinks, because Harry Potter wants him
Draco: Speaking of jobs (and yes, that was me segueing seamlessly via text. Watch and learn, Potter), you’re off for the next two days, are you not?
“I know,” hopefully-Megan says.
spend a lot of time in A&E as it turned out. Malfoy, who never rolled his sleeves up far enough for Harry to make sense of the tattoo peeking out at the cuffs. Malfoy, whose eyes went so soft when he was counselling, who Harry’d watched de-escalate a three-hundred-pound monster of a man with a cigarette and a touch on the elbow. Who Harry spent quite a lot of his shift staring at and spent the rest of his shift trying to avoid.
For a moment, the world holds its breath. Sending electricity through someone’s heart is not something Harry has gotten used to.
“Not a big deal?” Harry says, incredulous.
“I don’t like when you know more about Muggles than I do,” Draco says, glum and still stewing in self-pity.
“It shouldn’t be like this!” The anger is unexpected but Harry’s been on a knife’s edge all day. “We could save so many people and it would be easy! It would be so easy.” The mug is burning his palms but Harry barely feels it. “It’s like the war, just a quieter kind of hate. We don’t look at them, don’t see them, and so it’s alright if they die from heart complications or kidney failure or lymphoma and who cares, because they’re not magic and so it doesn’t matter.”
she was crying.
* * *
“So you know we work together?”
“Right.”
Draco pulls Celine Dion’s
“Pansy?” Draco says, eyes narrowing, the end of her name a bit soft with drink.
“How else are we going to get human blood?” Pansy said, as if he were a special kind of idiot.
“Let me change the song—”
Harry glances at the clock on the mantle. It’s just past ten. Draco’s shifts usually ends at ten, which means he came straight here—
“Thanks,” Harry says, taking the clipboard and trying for a smile. It’s a catastrophic failure at cheeriness.
Draco realizes.
Rain clings to Harry. It’s like he’s made of ink and his hair should melt right off, drip thick and squiggly. “I come here. All the time,” Harry says, not looking away from the street. Never looking up.
Draco doesn’t have an answer for that. It’s fortunate, then, that he starts to cough and that his spittle is tinged red. Long fingers rub circles into his back, and Narcissa is behind him, holding him steady.
“He matters to you.”
It came for him the night after his trial. He’d lay, curled up into the smallest version of himself, wishing that he could muster a few tears. Was crying the appropriate response? Should he have clapped his hands in celebration of the shiny new future he now had access too? A single act of benevolence from Potter, something he probably barely thought about, had changed the trajectory of Draco’s entire future; the charity would probably haunt Draco for the rest of his life.
Draco sighs. The fastest way to the end of any conversation with Robertson is honesty. “It wasn’t the date,” he says, searching through the junk drawer under the register for a plaster or a stray piece of tissue. “That wasn’t great, but it’s…there’s someone else.”
, he’d thought. The wards were ancient, dated back generations, and shouldn’t have succumbed to an angry kick.
“We’re in the same program,” Potter said, and he wasn’t angry anymore.
“Uh?” he says, looking guiltily down at his book-that-is-very-much-not-curry.
“This is gonna sound a bit weird, but I’ve been meaning to ask you, to tell you—”
Hermione rubs one finger under Bella’s chin.
It wasn’t his imagination, or a violent spectre of his desire come back to haunt him. Draco Malfoy is standing in the door, slacks wrinkled, blond hair thick with rain and pressed flat against forehead.
“Hoy shit,” Harry breathes. Because, until this moment, he’d sort of thought it hadn’t been real. He’d given up on ever finding Draco Malfoy.
“Hmmm.” Hermione’s eyes drift away from Harry, going fuzzy and thoughtful. “I wonder how Malfoy has managed it all these years. Watching people die when he knows they could be saved?”
They’re nearly home now. The wind moves across the grass like a hand drifting over velvet—a soft touch against the grain. Draco feels it on his cheeks, feels the cold in the corners of his eyes.
“You were attacked!”
Draco nods, feels how honest and certain the words had felt.
“Well, this woman, who also happened to be a virgin, got pregnant—”
“You,” Pansy says, slow, careful. The lines in her forehead crinkle tentatively. “You miss him?”
“Why do you get to live when my dad—”
“Magic? Or Malfoy?” Hermione has always been too intuitive for her own good.
“A death eater,” the man whispered. “I can’t believe I’m doing this with a death eater.”
As promised, one happy ending.
“It’s probably better that way.”
is the first thing Draco thinks, until his body realizes he’s woken up and then decides to make it’s complaints known. Every inch aches, like stony knuckles have kneaded him until he’s nothing but bruises.
Harry nods.
“I may have cast a spell—”
“I wasn’t—I didn’t know if you wanted…” The moment swirls and steeps. Harry’s drowning in it. “Me.”
Pansy shuffles though her purchases until she finds a tub of ice cream and hands the entire thing, plus a spoon, to Draco. “You can come back from that,” Pansy says, returning to the cupboards, into which she is stuffing several cans of beans.
“I’m fine!” Draco said, trying to dodge as Potter’s hands reached into his space. “Just going to be out for a second.”
There was something different here, something off in the way that Harry was looking at him. In school—in sixth year more than the others—Potter’s eyes had been on him. Followed him everywhere, until Draco thought he’d go mad.
“Memories,” Pansy says, scanning the room for any strays.
“Neither am I.” But Draco did want him.  It was there in the way he looked at Harry, wild and possessive.
“Why cabbages?” Draco askes, noticing the green and purple globes poking up from the bag.
The weight of what this means—that Draco is lost in the far flung regions of another universe and that Harry has no way to find him—pushes through his anger, and then his panic. Eyes watering and itchy with sleep, Harry yawns, the truth still crushing his thoughts, his lungs. “All that’ll be left are the dreams,” Harry says, words coming out scrambled. All he wants now is to crawl back into a world where Draco was his and he didn’t care if it was when he was asleep or awake.
“I don’t under—”
, Draco thinks.
“I like you,” Harry said, voice low and thick and afraid. “Have for a long time. So long.”
“I don’t belong anywhere,” Draco says. The back of his throat is so tight it hurts.
“I don’t need it! Or you! I don’t want to need you!”
“Mutinous motherfuckers,” Draco says. Under the table, Harry grabs his hand and just holds him.
It was true. He wouldn’t.
* * *
“Potter.”
“It’s Saturday, Harry,” Hermione says, reading his face. “I’ve had a Ministry representative reach out to Royal London Hospital and explain that you’ve had an urgent personal emergency and that you will return to your duties very soon.”
“You’re not going to believe me.”
The reality, that Harry is in Draco’s space—that he is going to leave this room and find Draco in joggers with his hair mussed and loose around his face—finally hits Harry as he turns the shower on scald. The knob is simple, the tile white and clean, and it’s all Draco’s. Draco stands in this shower, naked, and washes off the day, and Harry’s in his space.
John just smiles.
Pointy features have become sharp angles, sneers have softened, and Malfoy is grinning at him. With teeth. It’s all a bit much.
A pretty brunette glares, and Pansy grins back with teeth. “See something you like?” Pansy says, something hot behind her words. Draco expects a blush, or embarrassment, but the brunette has the decorum of a gypsy, and her irritation melts as her eyes rove over Pansy’s body.
she says.
“Oh for fuck’s sake. What have you done?” All of Pansy’s play has fallen away. She’s seriousness and certainty and Draco knows better than to skimp on the details.
And that’s when Draco realized he’s in a truck—an old truck, by the looks of things. And that Potter was driving on the wrong side of the road.
Draco seizes his morning copy of The Prophet and rolls it up into a makeshift microphone.
Unlike his father. If Draco ever saw Lucius again, it would be in chains. Lucius had been sentenced to ten years in Azkaban. Draco has no idea how to process this, and so he hasn’t.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Not all of the plot points have to match.”
“I—” Harry chokes, and realizes that he doesn’t want to talk about it. “Who are you?”
Harry lifts his foot so as not to muss the lines poured by Ron’s shaky hand.
“Why don’t we focus on the more pressing matter of a grown man who thinks he can fly.” It’s becoming difficult to breathe. Draco rubs his calves.
atop the pile. “Make sure you read the Yeats,” Robertson says, holding out Harry’s change, which Harry is wholly incapable of taking, as his hands are filled with books.
Malfoy said nothing.
And Harry had wanted none of it.
“Well, fuck Draco! Why weren’t you more prepared!”
Harry thinks and dutifully follows the green lines on the wall.
The Muggle nightclub pulses and his muscles ache, but the minutes melt with the music.
“We see each other every day. I—” Potter stuttered, and his knuckles were white around the wheel. “I’ve talked in your direction.”
“And I’ve had the most profound moment. You see, I was perusing the cabbages—”
“Fuck you.” There it is. Anger stirs behind those green fucking eyes and Draco almost groans with relief.
“Tight rope walking Archway Bridge?”
“Too much?” not-Potter cuts in, his face the colour of Robertson’s purple cabbages. “I’m so sorry. Oh my god. I’m just going to crawl under the counter and die now.”
“Don’t lash out because you’re secretly processing your fucked up feelings about Harry Potter,” Pansy says, but Draco ignores her.
The consequences of his obsession spill around him. Draco’s record player is askew, all of his lovely vinyl albums spread across the floor like playing cards. Dirt mixes with books, and there’s dozens of those strange vials glistening in the moonlight. They look silvery, almost like memories. Harry feels the urge to collect them, to tuck them back into the chest he’s upended.
“Years?” Why was Harry always the last person to gain insight into his own feelings? Why had no one bothered to tell him?
she’d said.
His magic—which jumped and rushed these days, tended to overflow when his emotions started to shudder—burnt through him. The shadowy din of the ballroom erupted into a white light and Harry felt his star explode.
— Harry feels the memory rising, impurities bubbling to the surface,  and he’s too tired to run.
“You’re not alright,” Draco says, a statement rather than a pointless question. He takes one tentative step into the room, watching Harry like he’s something wild.
But Harry’s not done. “You’ve always been a coward. Running or just giving up when things get hard—”
“Don’t.”
, Harry thinks.
, he thinks, trusting his instincts.
“Are death eaters not fit to be alone with children?”
Harry thinks.
“You went to a Muggle store? Alone?”
“No!” Ron appears to notice the subtle flex in the man’s biceps and takes a step out of his personal space. “Not at all. I was just wondering about those little squares you’ve got there—”
There was a door off to the left, and Harry had forced himself through it. He heard the metal slam against brick and then he collapsed onto the edge of a metal fence.
“Drinks!” Theo said, breaking the hesitation into pieces. “Come on. I’ll get the first round.”
The dark pavement feels like a blackboard and Draco a single white line. He knows where he’s going. His head is buzzing and his thoughts are washed out, but Draco knows where his feet are taking him.
“Shhh,” Draco says, not letting go of Harry’s wrists. “I’ve got you.”
The rage is a rash all over him, fury building and itching and Draco wants to climb out of his skin.
“But with a mobile unit, you’re literally just paying me and a police officer—both of whom will already be seeing the patient. Plus, it will expedite the emergency room experience because of the reduced volume of presentations.”
It’s strange to admit it, even through the medium of digital space.
Draco pulls his hand back, and all of a sudden he feels a thousand miles away. White socks peek out from under his long legs, and his arms are wrapped around his knees so tightly, Harry’s worried he’ll fly apart.
Realization crashes heavy and full of damage. “I fucked up,” Harry says. “He must’ve got pulled away after we…and then he tried to tell me and I just…” Harry swallows, tries to force the things he’d said back down. “I said terrible things.”
The insistent drumbeats stop short and Harry swallows past the lump in his throat. Malfoy is on his doorstep. Malfoy, who left him alone after the best sex of Harry’s life, who left after he promised he wouldn’t—
, spat with venom and fear, blood everywhere, his body taken apart in a way that felt too violent to be real. Draco sits up, nearly screams with the pain that’s cleaved his chest into pieces.
“Harry mate, is that you?”
, Harry thinks.
“My name,” definitely-not-Megan says. “It’s Emma.”
She does not break eye contact as her tiny white paw pushes the glass off the counter and onto the floor.
“Don’t leave,” Harry gasps, stumbling. There has to be something here, some clue to where Draco’s gone, because he can’t be gone again. He can’t.
“Harry—”
“Called in,” Harry grunts.
“You fucking gremlin!” Pansy shouts from the welcome mat. “You horrible little shit!”
The man is enormous, and Harry’s not sure how he missed him standing there beneath the open window, fingers stroking the spines of a title resting on the ledge. Two shaggy eyebrows arch into question marks. “You don’t look like much of a reader,” he says to Harry, who, for a moment, wonders if this should be offensive.
It’s as he’s composing a reply, still straddling the concrete railing, six feet of desperate man perpendicular against the sky as his thumbs race across the screen, that he hears the sirens.
“Both?” Harry says weakly, rubbing at the dirt between his fingers. It’s cool and damp.
. It’s a thought that often leaves him feeling melancholy.
“Do you know how difficult it is to find Muggle drugs when you’ve never used them before?”
“That’s an obscene amount of time,” Draco snapped, irritation crackling in the cramped interior.
Potter wouldn’t. “Get back in the car,” says Draco, trying for a drawl but it comes out thready and scared.
Harry thinks, realizing that this may not be his best idea.
“I haven’t really figured that out. I want—” But he doesn’t know what he wants. Because, “I’m not supposed to want this,” he says, out loud for the first time since he’d realized that wanting Malfoy was something seared into him—permanent, scarring.
“This isn’t just mucking around with time turners, although that would be bad enough.” Pansy’s shriek is in full form.  “You’re seriously playing with…with the whole universe…”
“Pansy, I knew you had a bit of a crush in fifth year, but I’d really thought we’d moved past this—”
Harry opens his eyes.
“That was my objection,” Pansy says, looking at Ron approvingly. “Well spotted, Weasel. Perhaps your use extends beyond the occasional comic timing.”
Not the Wizengamot, apparently.
Pansy is reduced to spluttering curse words.
Six shots of tequila later, the overhead speaker system stutters to a stop, cutting off the most recent Lord of the Rings soundtrack that had been humming through the café.
“You wouldn’t know shit without me,” Pansy snaps back, sharper and meaner than Harry. “I gave you your only clues. And cocoa!” she adds, and has the gall to sound offended.
“I’m a ghost, Harry. I thought you knew.”
A loud thump announces Bella’s presence on the floor.
Harry breathed a silent sigh of relief as they moved back towards the door. He was going home, Ron and Hermione be dammed. Night clubs were stupid and he’d almost seen Malfoy’s dick for fuck’s sake.
“You’re both so emotionally constipated. I can’t believe you made it this far without external intervention,” Pansy says. Harry doesn’t know how to reply and so takes a long gulp of his cocoa.
“I would argue that your feelings started around sixth year actually,” Hermione said.
An ominous yowl rends the air, on cue. It’s as if the villainous creature can read his mind (Harry is sure that she’s telepathic. Even though Hermione insists she has no magical properties and reminds Harry that he got her from a
Someone from the highest benches above says, “The accused being present, I call to order the trial of Narcissa Cassiopeia Malfoy and Draco Lucius Malfoy, on the fifth of August, of the year 1998, into offenses committed during the Second Wizarding War, in which the accused allegedly harboured and housed He Who Must Not Be Named, committed acts of torture, knowingly participated in… ”
Draco’s on a balcony overlooking the gardens, which feel freshly scrubbed but lonely, too. The manor hasn’t recovered from the war. It's still standing, still grandiose in the way that old buildings tend to be, even after they’ve been gutted and damaged. There’d been peacocks once. They’d strutted, arrogant and fanciful and far too brazen for their own good, before Macnair had butchered them all. For sport. Draco had watched, hadn’t stopped him.
“In another, I keep my balance. And live. I don’t think I care one way or another,”  he says and finds he means it. He really means it. Draco’s head is buzzing, with traffic and Jäger.
“Uh, yeah?” Harry has no idea where this is going, but thinks it’s better than where he started. “Hermione made me get one. In case I got lost of forget something or didn’t remember the Muggle medical intervention.”
“Worse,” Harry and Ron answer, simultaneously.
“Something happened,” Ron says, on his knees, leaning close. “What is it?”
“I’m going to fuck you,” Draco whispers, and Harry groans, desperate and delirious with how much he wants. He tries to turn his head, to get his lips on all that smooth skin. The hand is his hair tugs him closer, won’t let him, he can’t…
“No don’t—” Harry flinches, because there’s probably vomit and blood on him and Draco is clean. Harry doesn’t want anyone else to touch the remains of his night.
For a moment, Harry struggles, because this is the same woman who’d stood up in the Great Hall and offered him to Voldemort. This strained, blunted woman, who looks less like a pure blood bride and more like a sketch done in charcoal. She’s barely recognizable. “Sorry, but you’re not exactly—like—you’re not my friend,” Harry says, feeling awkward.
“Not even I could set that mess to rights,” Malfoy says, and he’s smiling. It’s just a gentle thing, but Harry can see it, playing across his lips.
“Right,” the nurse says, and alarms are bursting into life.
“Oh. My. God.”
“How long?” Hermione asks, staying on point.
The story has him, and Harry sees the stars blink down, sees the sky show its true face, sees himself lean across the cab and tie a question mark into knots with his tongue.
idea, if I remember correctly.”
“Prison?” Harry had said, still a bit fuzzy. “What do you mean, prison?”
“I’m—” Harry’s about to say
Nothing changed between them, not visibly, except that Hermione started coming over for lunch. Every day in the beginning. Having someone there—not saying anything inspiring or motivational or trying to fix him, just existing in his space—had helped suck some of the cloying despair from inside his chest.
Harry’s hard. He’s so hard and he can’t move. Wants to touch.
Draco has a wand in this universe, a difference that shouldn’t feel substantial, but is. Back in Draco’s world, Harry had never returned his wand. At his trial, Draco was sure that he would, would stick out his hand and present Draco with the one piece of magic that had chosen him.
“Drinks?” Pansy asks, hopping to her feat, eyes alight with villainy. Harry hates how much he enjoys her.
Harry is framed in the middle of the street, sun at his back, green eyes sharp and focused.
Darwin blushes through his beard. “Have a n—nice night, Pansy.”
“Yes, yes.”
* * *
It shouldn’t calm him—should have the opposite effect—but Draco is comforted, knowing that the precious Chosen One is nervous too. It makes him feel horribly human.
“She was just there and I had your wand and I wanted to help and—”
“The sage, Harry,” Hermione says, gesturing to the dried bundles behind her. “Move into the centre of the circle and—oh! Don’t disrupt the salt.”
“And then he disappeared?”
“An incident?” Draco is struggling to process, still has one foot in another universe, itching to race to Archway Bridge.
No matter what he does now, the facts will remain the same. Draco is almost certainly going to Azkaban. It’s strange, to know what’s coming. His trial is tomorrow and there is precisely zero chance that he avoids a prison sentence. Not a single death eater has been spared what the public at large are calling
“Why don’t you go on,” Ron says, tucking a wild strand of hair behind Hermione’s ear with casual affection that’s nearly a decade old. “What were you saying about Malfoy?”
“Have you thought of healing?” Hermione had said, and it was an offhanded comment. Not one meant to land or said with much intention. Hermione was desperate to get Harry off the couch and Harry was catatonic most of the time. Neither of them had expected it to take.
“Then what are you doing in my book shop? Did you wander in from the bustle looking for respite from the perils of our modern life?”
For the first time that day, Draco looks up. Sees that Harry is staring at him, green eyes wild and alive and focused. He’s always wanted those eyes on him. And now that he has them, Draco feels naked and very much not enough.
, because he knows that face, and yet Harry’s answer still buckles his bones. “In every universe,” Harry says.
Harry hadn’t had an answer for that. So he’d tried to let it go. To forget that Draco Malfoy was out there somewhere, and Harry couldn’t find him. Off kissing strangers and getting publicly mauled and Harry didn’t care because it wasn’t
table. Pansy casts a subtle notice-me-not on it every few weeks to ensure they will always have privacy away from the “insufferable Muggle gamers.” Pansy’s knowledge of Muggle colloquialisms really has improved, Harry thinks, smiling as he spots the shiny black gleam of her hair. Thick liquid eyeliner traces deep lines on her dainty face and Harry realizes with no small amount of horror that the feeling in his chest is
“Are you sick?” Potter said, and there’s something wrong with his voice. “Do you have a fever or something? Cause you really should’ve told me about that before you jumped in my truck. It’s rude to trap someone with your germs, y’know.”
Draco knows that word, recognizes it as the Muggle equivalent of a mind healer—Robertson keeps suggesting he see one. “Where are your positive affirmations? Aren’t you supposed to be a purveyor of wisdom and benediction?”
It’s been ten days. Harry is wearing a path into the hardwood and has been all day. Bella is yowling and wreaking havoc on his Quidditch paraphernalia, and Draco still hasn’t come back.
“What?—”
Draco lifts the cigarette to his lips, breathes in.
“Why don’t you say it?” Harry is startled by how rare the voice sounds—it’s his own, and he’s never heard it bleed like this. It’s raw as a sore throat.
They’re in the lobby, Draco realizes, in a corner near the coat check. No one’s seen them. No eyes are looking. The doorway to the ballroom where the celebration will take place is just up ahead at the top of a set of stairs. Two double doors are flung open, towering twenty feet tall and surrounded by fairy lights floating in the air. Laughter drifts up and out, washing the entranceway in the promise of company.

warmer since Draco moved in. “It’s because of my superior blood claim,” Draco had said as they watched the house slowly open itself up.
“I’m sorry,” Harry yelps, backing away from Robertson and his change. “I’m going to go now.”
“Maybe,” brunette says and Pansy looks hungry. The girl’s halter-top leaves little to the imagination, and Pansy looks ready to take hold of the her long curly hair and twist it between her fingers.
Potter had been wrong.
John holds up a hand and Draco lets himself be silenced. “Past is fixed. Stone. You’re not changing it. Future though. That’s something worth doing.”
“It’s not decided yet,” Hermione had said. “But most people believe that Malfoy and his mother will receive lengthy prison sentences.”
In the quiet place between sleeping and dreaming, when his thoughts were at there most biting and real, Harry knew that she was placating him.
. He scoots back across the room and settles down next to Pansy. She’s taken her socks off and is wiggling her toes.
“I’m sorry—”
“Why are you here?” Draco says at the same time Harry says, “Why’d you leave?”
“Yes, they told me,” Draco’s hands are fists.
Draco had struggled to process, had stared at Potter without shame. The hair was the same—a dark weed sprouting every which way. Same arms and chin and scar. The scar still carved sharp white lines across Potter’s forehead, and Draco wondered if it was the Dark Lord who put it there. “The same program?”
“It doesn’t have to make sense,” Draco says, and he looks so soft in his joggers that Harry wants to cry again.
“Oy! What was that for!”
“Handover in A&E is at five,” Draco says, looking down that long nose at him. “I know. I spend quite a lot of time there.”
Draco nods. Harry focuses on the single point of red light at the end of his cigarette. “But that’s a story for another time.”
“It looks to me like you’ve wandered off the beaten path,” a voice booms, and for a moment Harry thinks there’s a speaker system connected overhead. The tones reverberate in the air, fill up the corners.
“I feel like you’re going to make it
“Leave?” The confusion on Draco’s face is genuine.
Fate kisses him on the top of his head and it’s the last thing Draco feels before the lights go out.
Pansy nods. “At night. But he’s only ever gone for a couple of hours. Eight, tops.”
“No, no I’ve never had that specific problem.” Those socked feet have entered the room and are creeping closer to Draco.
The dance floor had a heartbeat and was sending shock waves through Harry’s bones. The whole world swayed around him. There were just so many people. Sweat rolled down Harry’s forehead, but not the warm kind spurred on by dancing or arousal. The cold kind that turned his skin the texture of raw meat.
Harry needs him to keep going, babbles his need. “But I want. I don’t care.”
Nothing
* * *
Pansy had said.
“Will this consideration include actually reading the proposals I place on your desk?” Draco says, weaving condescension and politeness together with the deft muscles of his tongue.
The quiet shatters. And Draco is so angry, he thinks he might die.
“You’re right here, of course I can.”
“I don’t! I don’t want—”
Harry has settled in the middle of the bridge, is staring down at Archway Road intently. His fingers are pressed flat against the stone railing, his knuckles white and flecked with rain. He looks so alone up here, so removed, as the traffic whizzes by and the wizarding world continues on with its horrible bloody struggle. Up here, none of that can touch him.
In the weeks and months following the Battle of Hogwarts, the Ministry had opened all trials for alleged Death Eaters to the public, in an effort to avoid the hushed suspicion that certain families were buying their freedom. Dollars soaked in blood to smother the guilt. And so Draco’s shame would be witnessed by most of wizarding London.
“That’s a touch elitist of you,” Draco says.
“Of course, in this universe. What the fuck are you on about?” Pansy ignores him, jumps to her feet and starts to scramble at the mess on the floor. At first, Harry thinks she’s tidying the room, and guilt forces him to his feet.
“Wait!” Harry shouts, sliding to a stop in the entranceway in nothing more than his pants, with  a ragged throw draped haphazardly across his shoulders.
“Torture?” Draco says, wounded. “I’m merely providing you with an education. I’m expanding your cultural palate.”
Robertson pushes past him an into the back of the shop. Draco can hear him, monologuing as he goes.
Harry finds some bizarre items—scattered bottles of nail varnish in the bathroom, several pairs of spangly heels that set Harry’s mind racing, a collection of colourful scarves in the front closet. Harry finds all of this and more too, but not what he’s looking for.
“I see.”
Harry thinks and he follows
Harry nods. He was.
The world is wobbling and Draco’s skin is hot but he doesn’t care. He’s above everything now. The ache of what’s happened is so far away, and it’s okay now. Everything’s okay.
Draco nods.
“It’s multiple universes actually. The multiverse,” Draco supplies, and Pansy looks like she wants to hit him.
The hedges herded him up the drive, curving with the road towards large wrought-iron gates. Harry had apparated here on a whim, the box under one arm, confessions cloying against the walls of his throat. There’d been no strategy beyond giving back the wand.
“Draco,” Robertson says, and the words drip with gravitas. “As your employer and an adult figure to whom you look up to a great deal, I must voice my concerns regarding his approach.”
“That’s right. I have them every Friday for lunch and I will not have them pilfered by greedy little shop boys.”
has all the hallmarks of a classic!” Draco says, defensive.
“Hermione!” Harry barrels through the floo, so agitated he thinks it may be bleeding through his skin. “Hermione! I need to talk to you!”
“That’s not really helpful,” Harry says, ready to curl up with the shame of it all.
When he’d returned to see the patient, Malfoy was gone.
“What are you going to do now?”
“OH!” Harry chokes on the hot burn of white rum. “That’s—”
It takes Draco this long to notice the stretcher. There’s a simple white sheet covering something—
“I entered the mental health consult a while ago. The counsellor’s almost finished with the suicidal ideation in Room 5.”
say? It
“Look,” Ron says, collecting their empty mugs and dumping them in the sink. “Just find him at work tomorrow. Talk to him. It’s honestly not that complicated.”
“I can’t go back in there,” Draco said to the open air. He took a deep breath and realized that it hurts. The deep freeze cut into his lungs and chilled him from the inside out. “I can’t.”
Bella springs into motion, her beady little eyes fixed on Harry’s fridge. She meows. Threateningly.
He’d planned to chart, to hide in the tiny little office that he shares with two other residents and try to get caught up on his documentation. Harry’s feet, it seems, have different ideas. Without much conscious thought, Harry is walking up to the switchboard operator, not thinking about what he’s going to say until he’s right there in front of her.
“Potter, I refuse to have this conversation sober.”
Pansy’s eyeroll is tremendous. “Then why are we here?”
“In this universe too,” Malfoy mutters and Harry has no idea what to make of that.
“Memories?” Harry asks. “Of what.”
No one questions him; they all follow Pansy as she leads the way through the empty house.
, he thinks, but only briefly. There’s a pressure building behind his eyes and he decides that tonight he doesn’t care who he’s supposed to be or who he’s supposed to want.
Pansy throws her head back and laughs. “Unlike you, I would never limit my conquests to people with dicks,” Pansy shouts, winking at him, and turning to press a kiss to the piercing on halter-top’s full bottom lip.
John sits up, leans forward, a little further into Draco’s space. “No. It’s not. But nothing will change what you did. No matter how much you wish for it.” John pauses grinning. “Here’s the one and only piece of advise I’ve got for you. Take note, you grumpy twat.”
“Don’t worry about it.” Pansy pats Draco on the head. “But you’ll want to drink at least two of those in preparation.”
Draco takes a few long, wobbling strides, feels destiny hum through his blood. “I knew I’d be back here,” he says, lifting his head to the sky and closing his eyes. “The lines got tangled and this is a part of my story now.”
“Semantics?” Harry says, squinting in an effort to see her more clearly. He’s without his glasses, and the world is crystal around her, but her edges are infinite. “Seems kind of an important distinction.”
“Draco,” she says again. “You trial is tomorrow—”
“A likely story,” Roberson says, but leans down, his mouth inches from the cash drawer, strokes the back of the machinery, and—much to Draco’s fury—the thing springs open.
Two hands have him by the shoulders, frame his grief like a portrait.
Instead, he asks, “How was the date, my blond Casanova?”
“What? Why?” Harry turns back around, can’t seem to stop looking down down below. The cars are so loud, so fast underneath them.
Anti-death eater sentiment had hit a fever pitch. Since the gentler nature of Draco’s sentence and Potter’s public push for a leniency, there had been a dangerous shift in public opinion.
“Right!” Harry says, grabbing the clipboards from query-Megan’s hands and flipping through the charts. The fluorescent lights are a food lamp, baking everyone alive.
“I have no idea what that means,” Harry says.
“Okay?” Harry asks, and that
“Of course you have.”
* * *
He ignores her. “I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”
Harry swallows hard. Barely hears Dr. Horwood’s barrage of questions. Finds his focus pared down to the single point where green eyes meet grey.
“No no! I’m so sorry. I’ve got—bye then!” The sound of her plastic heels clack rapid fire against the hospital tile. If Amber spots Harry in her flight from the office, she doesn’t let on.
“It’s not a question.” Narcissa’s voice is as stern as Draco’s ever heard it. “I’ve instructed the house elves to stop permitting you entrance to the grounds, beginning next week.”
“—idiot. Stop inflating your ego and start telling me about this curse. Are you sure that it even took? Have you seen one of these…universes?”
And Harry…well, the calculus of who owes whom, of how much regret and remorse adds up to something that balanced is messing with his head. They’re dancing and Harry is dizzy with life debts and Fiendfyre. Malfoy had stomped on his face and Harry had flayed him in a bathroom. Malfoy had let Death Eaters into Hogwarts and Harry had…
“C’mon,” Harry says, pulling them away from the enormous tables covered in small figurines. The chairs are crowded with boisterous twenty-somethings, some yelling, some rolling dice.
The manor wouldn’t recover from the war—not now. It was grandiose in the way that old buildings tended to be, even after they’ve been gutted and damaged. When they’d moved the bodies from the basement, Draco had assumed that the violence was over. There would never be peacocks again, Draco knew that now. Azkaban had been a one-way trip for father, and his mother—there were no peacocks for her now.
Draco’s hand reaches between them, wraps around his leaking cock. Pulls Harry to the edge in needy hurried jerks, but it doesn’t matter, because contentment is flowing through him, between them.
“My mother,” Draco says, words turning nasty.
Harry is shaking all over. Draco is staring at him with a look that is simultaneously desperate and furious.
“Try,” Draco whispers, because anything louder would scare the moment away.
Draco thinks, and pulls his mother against his chest.
The early afternoon is tempting, storefronts beckoning in the midday lull. Draco’s neighbourhood is quaint and tries a little too hard at it, but Harry doesn’t mind. There’s an electronics shop that advertises a massive collection of CDs and vinyl records, another that sells stationary—and Harry briefly fantasizes about burning it down, his personal vendetta against muggle pens has grown that strong. Near the end of the lane, right before a stoplight that’s humming red in the dew, is a used bookshop.
Draco feels a boot clamp down on his neck.
“No.” Malfoy holds up a finger, and Harry’s assaulted with the memory of a dream, where Harry had pulled that finger into his mouth and just sucked.
Draco wanted to dissect it. To pin his selfishness to the petri dish, to watch the skin of his ambitions pull off muscle, to wiggle the tendons of his cowardice with the tip of the scalpel. To conduct the autopsy of his mistakes.
He leans into the soft fabric and repeats “shit” out loud, for good measure.
“No!” Draco shouts into his sheets. “Not yet,” but the curse does not negotiate and so Draco knows he’s home. Egyptian cotton, soft and tangled up in his feet, confirms it.
“Are those,” Ron stops in his tracks and leans in, getting far too close to a table of men, all of whom have terrifying muscles, “little squares with numbers on them?”
Draco’s own universe had disintegrated like sugar melting in hot water.
, Draco thinks and sinks into the soft down of his pillow.  Because it’s certainly not easy. Harry’s temper could scorch the earth. He’s too generous with his good opinion and far too tolerant of the press. He leaves his damp towels on the floor and allows his evil house pet far too much leniency. Sometimes, when Draco leaves for work or visits the manor, Harry looks at him as if he’s afraid he will go forever—as if Draco could ever stop coming back.
“Mr. Potter?” the man with the gavel says, and he sounds surprised. Which is when Draco hears the footsteps. Not heading up into the gallery but down. Down into the pit, soft against the cement floor. Settling next to his chair. Draco can see a set of trainers—there’s a tiny hole where the left toe pokes out.
Harry had asked, the last time he’d seen Malfoy.
John doesn’t say anything.
“I’m many things, Potter,” Malfoy says, eyes still closed, lips barely moving. “But nice? I don’t think so.”
Draco gulps, so desperate for air that he doesn’t think, just swallows a mouthful of dust, and starts to hack.
“You’re out of your mind!—”
“What do you miss?” Harry asks, feeling brave.
, Draco thought, and then decided not to ask. That there was no point in seeing how horrible the Malfoys could be in another iteration of the world.
“Malfoy,” he’d said, unreadable. “Where are you going now?”
“I want,” Harry gasps when Draco releases him, starts kissing down the side of Harry’s neck.
Later, Robertson would corner him in Literary Fiction, his caterpillar eyebrows full of mischief. “He left you this,” Robertson says, handing Draco a slip of paper with a phone number on it.
“You’re the curse?” Harry should be afraid, but he isn’t.
. Malfoy got a shot at a life bigger than war trauma and reparations. Harry knew he should have been happy with the outcome. But as he pushed through the crowds of people, the shouted questions, the camera flashes, all he could think about was the way Draco’s skin had felt under his fingers. The way that grey eyes had pinned him in place. The way that his dead flesh had felt warm for those few moments when Draco Malfoy had been paying attention to him.
“Sorry enough to traipse across the multiverse?” Draco wishes his words had more bite.
More often than not, Harry’s dreams were innocuous, simple in the way that a day in the life often was. Harry dreamt of nights on spent the couch, Draco’s head in his lap, and when he woke up, he could still feel how soft Malfoy’s hair had been between his fingers. He dreamt of farmer’s markets and flowers, of showers and the scent of lemon. Of kisses under a sky splashed white with stars, of road trips and fights and wedding rings.
Draco’s eyes follow Harry’s. “Those? Oh.” A hint of embarrassment, followed by, “they’re done by my patients.”
“This is practically Pagan,” Pansy says, tongue flicking out to lick at her lips nervously. Hermione dabs the blood, determined and soft, into the shape of a star.
For half a second, Draco wonders what to do next. Get up, perhaps? But his body is not responding and his eyes feel swollen.
Triggers for this chapter: there is a minor character death, described in some detail. None of our leading lads, but it’s still a tough scene.
He’s a book who’s spine has finally cracked, who’s opening to Harry and giving him something secret. It’s vulnerability that feels like too much.
“It loosely translates to
“I don’t understand.”
In his quest for enlightenment—which included but was not limited to the nuances of what the Muggles call Pop Culture—Draco had purchased the strange box as well as a stack of circular disks.
“Sometimes, we forget to look up,” Harry said. Those green eyes could join them, glinting like that. He was a man made of star stuff.
Bodies hurry through the green privacy curtain. “We need to get her on the stretcher,” Harry says, and reaches down. The girl’s arms are jerking, her body stiff under his hands.
* * *
Malfoy snorts, but Harry pushes on. “We snogged. It was nice. But since then, I’ve been with—it’s—blokes. Almost always blokes.”
He didn’t know why. The idea of Potter liking him…maybe wanting him…no wasn’t possible
“Right,” Draco had said, adding his signature to one final document.
There’s a grip around his wrist, holding. Holding.
“What?” Harry yelps, startling around to find the person attached to that voice.
“There used to be peacocks,” Pansy says as Hermione prepares the ritual. She leans over the railing, her feet lifting from the ground a little as she pitches forward. The wind is gentle in her hair. “There was this white one that always bit my fingers. Draco loved that stupid bird.”
“Yeah,” Harry huffs, watery eyes a bit slow to process. “What the fuck, Hermione? Why are you working with—”
“Wait, Draco.”
“I still can’t believe you actually disappear,” Pansy says, shaking one of the bottles. Florescent lime green.
* * *
“You’re ganging up on me,” says Draco, a bit petulant as he realizes what’s about to happen.
“What’s the point!” Harry had stood up. “What was the point of saving the fucking world if we’re just going to kill everything that’s left behind?”
Draco doesn’t look at the chair, or the chains hanging limp at his sides. He doesn’t look at the raised seats or the purple robes. He picks a stain on the cool cement floor and forces his eyes to stay put. Looking at it will only make it worse.
“Draco isn’t Lucius,” Harry snapped, and the name had tasted strange on his tongue.
“What did you get?” Hermione asks, back on the rug, feet up on the coffee table. Harry instinctively knows that Draco would be scandalized on his furniture’s behalf, but Pansy doesn’t give a whit. “Will it be of any help?”
“You do look a bit…” Ron trailed off, clearly reaching for a word that was kind rather than disparaging. “Well, you look a bit shit, actually.”
“Stop comparing yourself to Potter.”
she says as the station fades away.
she finishes.
“Hermione’s clever. And I had more help, besides.”
Harry surrenders. “Fine,” he growls, rummaging for her food and then throwing it into her dish with far more force than necessary. Flecks of brown mush stick to the backsplash. “Now leave me alone—” Harry’s ravings are interrupted by a loud ping.
Harry sighs. “No.” That had been Harry, through and through, and Draco loved him for it, although he still hadn’t said.
“Draco, I can take it from here. If you could head to the back and start sorting the new arrivals?”
“Are you—” someone laughs behind them, and Draco flinches, bites his lip, carries on. “Are you sure? That you want this?”
“Amber are you sure you can’t spare another minute. I’ve got a few other items I’d like to—”
. There was no resisting her.
“Did you reach out? Ask for his support?” Narcissa says and Draco bites back a snarl.
This was an old want, one borne out of the “
Eventually, the world stills, the street bleeds under the curses that have gouged out the pavement storefronts.
Draco looks at her for a long time.
Draco thought, until Potter replied and he realized he’d said that out loud too.
Draco is in the Mystery corner of the store, drowning in a bottomless mass of paperbacks. He’s committed to forcing some order to the magic of Robertson’s collection—today, by a resolute effort to alphabetize.
“Is she always like this?” Pansy asks conspiratorially, and for a moment, Harry feels like he’s been given a glimpse of what friendship could be like with Pansy Parkinson.
Harry had wanted this, he reminds himself. The busyness, the rush of bodies, the urgent need to help.
thought a green suit would be a good idea.”
Touching Harry Potter is like trying to soothe an earthquake and yet Draco will try, every time. He lays one hand between Harry’s shoulder blades, lets it rest there, waits for Harry to shake him off, maybe hit him.
“Not what?” John asks.
“Oh, I plan to.”
“Oh my god, it’s Potter,” Draco said, before he realized that he probably shouldn’t.
Draco stands up. “Do you smoke?”
“Why didn’t you tell me!” Harry had roared, when he’d seen Hermione’s name in the subheadline.
Here, Robertson’s words stumble to a halt. There’s a sheen of tears ready to spill over—emotions came so rapidly with Robertson, sunbathing to storms. “Um?” Draco says, inching towards his slightly manic employer. “Sir, are you grappling with your mortality?”
It's 1998, and Draco learns a bit about Shakespearian tragedy, scores a set of digits, and attempts to match the vocal talents of the untouchable Celine Dion (you were doomed from the start, Draco. No one can touch this French Canadian goddess).
“Well, that’s convenient.”
“What the fuck?” he said, the cool press of the curse’s touch still chilly between his fingers.
So Harry does. “After the trial—”
“You know yourself better than I do. If you tell me you don’t want to die, I believe you. That and,” John looks Draco up and down. “Sorry, but you look too wrung out to lie to me.”
“Yeah,” he says, looking over his shoulder, searching for the station’s corners. “Once.”
“So good,” Harry babbles, mouth open and searching for those lips, so mean, so soft.
“And you’re a disturbed youth—”
Draco thinks, and the planes of their bodies drift together, arms buried in shirts and hair and skin.
“Fuck a nine toed troll, they made it,” someone says. Ron. That was Ron.
“I asked him why there were horses under the hood of his vehicle,” says Draco.
“Not supposed to want this,” Harry whispers, as his back arches closer to the long lines of Draco’s chest.
“Yes yes.”
Draco laughs in spite of himself. What a delight to work in a place where the name Harry Potter doesn’t produce instant recognition. “Someone I will never have. Not in this universe anyway.”
Harry looks up at Bella now. “Don’t do it,” he says.
“I’m sure we can manage to alter your clothes.”
”Hi,” she says.
Back in 1998, Pansy falls in love with Justin Timberlake (we approve, Pans) and Draco takes a ride across the Alaskan Tundra in a pick-up truck with Harry fucking Potter, who's looking at him in a
. (We love you, Draco)
Harry shakes his head. “I can’t believe I found you here of all places. Working in a Muggle A&E.”
John laughs and it’s such a full sound—as if he’s got goodness to give away. “You’re here because you were tight rope walking Archway Bridge and maybe thinking about killing yourself? At least, that’s what the officer said when he dumped you in the waiting room.”
, Draco thinks
“What the fuck?” He’s never heard that sound before.
It was fine, Harry tells himself after apparating home to Grimmauld. Fine, he thinks as he feeds his evil cat, who had shredded the cabbage he’d left out on the countertop. It was totally fine, he thinks as he pulls on a pair of joggers and his running shoes.
, Harry thinks, looking up from the chart
“Is it?” John says.
The moment is so fragile. “Harry, please,” Draco breathes, looks like he wants to hide.
“Right.”
“Potter,” Draco whispers, and he can’t stop thinking about the way he’d looked. Like someone drunk had tried to draw him. Like he hadn’t slept in days.
People are crowding together. Not in the hundreds, but it doesn’t take one hundred people to make the streets feel dangerous.
There was nothing for it. Harry pours the memory into his pensieve. “I guess we’ll start at the beginning,” he says to Bella and tips into a world made of ice and stars.
“Even if the classic enemies to lovers plot line were not so well trodden, the look you wore when you entered my shop told me all I needed to know.”
They are sitting at a table in the middle of a gaming café that specializes in, but is certainly not limited to, intense matches of a card game called
“Fuck, your lips are soft.”
The world realigns with a shuddering crack, as Harry’s knees collide with the smooth tile. The smell of sage and lavender burns his nostrils. Harry remembers that he has a body and that everything hurts just as he registers the smell of lemons and sweat in the hollow of a neck.
“Right.” Silence is tight in the air between them and Harry has no idea what to say.
“You can start tomorrow.”
“I’m in love with Harry Potter,” Draco says and, Merlin, it is such a relief to have the truth said out loud.
“I think that, given the
“Of course I see children.”
Hermione’s laugh wheezes and squeaks.
“Yes. Yes he was,” Draco answers, turning around and seeing—
“Yeah,” Harry chokes on some soot. “Yeah, it’s me.”
“Okay,” Harry says. “Another time, then.”
Harry opens his eyes, because he still has eyes that can look and hands that can hold, and realizes that he’s in a tangle of limbs in the middle of a circle made of blood.
“Potter, if I have to listen to details of your sex dreams, I will hex your balls off,” Pansy says and Harry flinches. Then he blushes.
“There it is,” Robertson says, thwumping him on the back with the casual force of Hagrid.
are offered in a halting explanation, but Draco doesn’t really hear it. It’s almost as if the shock of it, of the words
“Okay,” Pansy says, nudging the story along.
“I will!”
“Gone,” Pansy says.
“But it was so dramatic!”
This was not a phantom from another universe. He was not a Chosen One determined to save him—to save him and hate him. Not-Potter was looking at him like he was something to eat and it was so much more straightforward.
Keep an eye out for the title line, friends! And hold on. It’s a bit turbulent from here on out.
Harry sits up, stretches. Let’s the ache in his back wring out.
A curse flashes white, someone screams, and Potter’s magic flares. Draco blinks just as a bright shield erupts, collects around a young boy who is crying on the pavement. And Harry keeps moving, untouchable, his mouth pressed into that same determined line.
known. Even if his understanding of what infinite worlds and the multiverse was incomplete, he’d known that finding Draco and returning home at all had been a long shot. Trying to get a fix on her eyes, as they shift in a face that’s made of a thousand other faces, Harry says, “But I had to try.”
The door is an open threshold, and Harry doesn’t know how to let Draco cross.
“Ah.”
There’s a light at the top of the stairs, and footsteps sound a gentle alarm in the silence. Someone is coming.
Draco thinks. Remembers.
“Here,” Draco says, handing Harry a scrap of paper and the exquisite fountain pen. “You can keep it.” Harry can see the red creeping up the back of his neck.
“Don’t let them slip away,” Harry says and Draco looks for him. Potter’s across the street, far enough away that he hasn’t seen Draco yet. It’s like this, sometimes. Sometimes, he and Harry haven’t settled into anything romantic. Sometimes, Draco gets to see it happen, gets to relive Harry’s desire crumbling.
Malfoy’s eyes were still closed and Harry wondered what was so wrong about it. Found that he wanted to interrupt. To ask what was so wrong—
“Go see a mindhealer?” Ron had suggested, and then Seamus had collapsed across Harry’s legs and spilled a full pint into his lap. Ron had laughed even harder and Harry had thrown his head back in despair and they hadnever spoken of it again.
And it’s all too much. The eyes, the whispers, the arrows. It’s all going to fall upon them, and it won’t just be Draco’s shame anymore. It will be Harry’s too.
Harry thinks and it’s such an absent thing, to think.
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry says to the cracks in the tile. “I didn’t mean to.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“My life is depressing,” Harry says, and Bella yowls in response. “And that’s enough out of you,” Harry says to the squished face that pops up onto the counter. Giant blue eyes watch him—judge him.
Draco’s anxiety is pulsing in time with his heartbeat.
“I tried to fix it,” Draco says. “To fix whatever’s wrong with me. Whatever I’ve done to fuck up this entire universe.”
Potter moves through the chaos, magic spilling from his lips, through his fingers. A Death Eater dashes across the street, dark cloak rippling in the wind, wand out. Potter’s eyes twitch, he barely reacts, and the bricks beneath the Death Eater’s feet reach out and grab at his ankles.
The lines of the world start to straighten out. The power lines point perpendicular overhead, ninety-degree angles rushing around corners. It grounds him. Everything settles back into place, firm lines taking shape; around them, the landscape colours itself in. It is a strange gift, to wander until the ground feels solid under his feet and the universes stop blinking in and out of existence.
“Okay,” Harry thinks he says. The tiny room holds its breath and Malfoy looks like he’s considering something. And nothing exists between the silence and what Malfoy might say.
“You sister tortured—”
“So, Malfoy really said that he’d been dragged into another universe?” Hermione says, staring quizzically into her tea.
“I…” Harry doesn’t have a good answer for that. “I have to go. I’ll be late for report—”
“I’m sleeping loads!” Harry said, finally landing on something he was doing right.
Harry flees, with Draco Malfoy’s laughter biting at his heels.
“That’s woefully inconvenient,” Robertson says, sounding genuinely distressed on Draco’s behalf. It’s touching.
“All of those questions. I’ve watched them building up since that first day in A&E,” Draco says, setting the bottle on the cement. “Just ask.”
“You don’t understand—”
Draco tries to shrug it off. Tries to weaponize his nonchalance. “Oh, it’s nothing really. I just…” He breathes in. Once. Twice.  “The curse I cast on myself—the effects make absolutely no sense. It wasn’t supposed to work like this—”
“With
, Draco thinks as he drifts into a tipsy sleep,
A woman with a short grey bob and a set of knitting needles glares up at him. “Do you work here?” she asks, her tone crisp.
It all moves so quickly across Draco’s face—the agony and desire, the disbelief and finally the hope, a determined shade of red in his cheeks.
“You know?” the stranger says, his confidence wilting under Draco’s confusion. “It depends on if you’re single?” The last word squeaks out.
The stranger shrugged. “Suit yourself.”
The electronic doors open and close, open and close as Harry stands just a bit too close. He knows he should just go home, to his empty fucking house and force his evil cat to love him just a little. He knows that’s what he
Harry is stunned. This has been a very bizarre afternoon and Harry opens his mouth to say so, until a memory of Dumbledore beginning his first welcome feast at Hogwarts with, “Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!” reminds him that it’s all a matter of comparison. “I didn’t expect to get advice on my love life,” he says instead.
A single, incontrovertible truth throbs in his knuckles as they batter Potter’s body.
“I think eccentric is a generous interpretation,” Draco says, and the stranger smiles at him. It’s all teeth and goodness.
Draco had said after their chance meeting in A&E.
“I know!” Harry half shouts, leaning his neck back and staring at the ceiling.
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry says, and the tears come. They finally come. Despair and rejection, shared history made liquid. “I didn’t mean to,” he says, to his empty kitchen and his cat.
“Excuse me,” he panted, but the edges of his vision were black. “Move,” he gasped, because his lungs were desperate for air and he couldn’t breathe.
“I know,” Draco says, his lips moving against Harry’s ear.
Forty-five minutes later, Harry stands in front of the ancient register, his arms laden with, “the words of your betters,” Robertson insists. With a flourish that any wizard would envy, Robertson stacks Walt Whitman’s
“Absolutely,” Pansy hisses back. “And we don’t to whisper.”
“Residents,” he hears her mumble once his back is turned. “Like chickens with their heads cut off.”
“No, not at all.” Faux indifference slips off his tongue. “You walking out in the middle of the night and leaving me alone—”
“It was just a fever,” the woman who must be Viola’s mother whispers. “You can’t die from a fever. Kids get them all the time. It’s just a fever.” And the whispers continue, on an on. A litany. A prayer.
Draco slips the white filter between his lips and lifts the flame of his lighter to the tip. “Yes well,” he says, taking a deep breath in. “I had a fairly traumatic interaction with the Muggle mental health care system and decided that I wanted to be a part of it.” Draco breathes out, and smoke spills from the corners of his mouth.
“I mean, he might still be angry,” Harry says and has the distinct impression that his evil cat is listening. “Wouldn’t put it past Malfoy, to play the long game. To wait until he’d gotten a leg up—” His voice breaks and Harry wants to sink into the floor. There’s a pressure behind his eyes. “I mean, I did find his dead mum. And I—” Flashes of blood staining white-blonde hair. Of his magic crackling, red and hot and totally out of control. Of blue lips and then—
Later, sweaty and sticky and utterly sated, Draco feels the world sway to the beat of Harry’s sleep-steady breaths. For years, Draco had stared up at the ceiling, much like he is now, yearning to sleep for the possibility of another universe.
“That’s really unnecessa—” she tries, but Draco is relentless.
It was a small gesture. One that Harry has replayed in his pensieve more times than he can count. They were halfway through the back door when Malfoy had reached for the stranger’s hand. A simple thing. Tender. Almost intimate.
The longest pause so far stretches Harry to breaking.
“People die all the time,” is all Harry can say when his chest loosens. “I don’t know why I’m like this.”
Harry peels his heavy eyes open and sees Bella, who has settled next to his face, two tiny paws resting between her enormous head. With obvious trepidation, she is leaning in, a tiny pink tongue licking the tears from his cheeks.
“OH!” Hermione’s face lights up, residual sleep falling away. “No way! Has it finally happened?”
“Yes! I just need to—ah—consult on the patient with the seizures.”
“You just called him a perfect person who died for our sins.”
Sixty-one different lives have left Harry’s head fractured and loose and right now, he just wants to wander through a life that was his and not some spectre from a future he would never have. He wants to put himself back together.
One heartbeat. Then another.
” Ron had said, when Hermione had started outlining the materials they would need.
Draco had said when he’d thought no one was looking.
* * *
Draco leans forward, forearms on his knees. “Yes?”
Draco thinks.
“Mean to what!” Draco’s voice is a knife on glass.
“I want—”
A content warning before you dive in: suicidal ideation features in one of the scenes, so if that's a trigger for you, please consider skipping this one <3
“Do you want to know what I miss the most?” says Harry, ignoring the question.
It had all been so messy. The accounting of responsibility for a magical civil war exploded all over the front pages of the Profit.
, “acceptable,” Draco finishes.
It was cheating, really, to look that good in profile. “I wouldn’t,” Malfoy says, so serious that Harry believes him instantly. “Now stop stalling. We came to drink, not to linger awkwardly outside.”
The words had peeled off his skin and laid him bare. Potter had said that. Had narrowed his singular green eyes and said,
“The sky,” he whispered.
“You weren’t at work,” Draco says, and Harry can tell that it’s an effort, to break the silence.
“But now,” Hermione soldiers on, “Draco is adrift in the multiverse and we need something that can connect us to him. A link. Something that’s remained consistent in every universe. Probably the thing that he needs to
Any fantasies that he’d clung to were banished in that bathroom, the day Potter had carved him open.
Harry latches on to the lyrics and glares. “Is this a hint, Parkinson?”
The first time Pansy doesn’t notice him was innocuous; it could have been the noise in the gaming café or the distractingly fit bloke trying to charm her at the bar.
Pansy snorts. “You think I’m letting you do this alone?”
And those fucking grey eyes, lifting as Harry approaches. The attention is singular, focused, as if he is the only person in the world who matters. It’s as intense as it was the first time, that night in A&E.
Robertson’s brow contracts with concern. “If I ever encounter this young gentleman, I’ll be sure to set him straight. Whether or not I believe him deserving. If that is what you wish.”
“That is shit,” Ron says.
isn’t exactly the kind of language that one uses to address the Wizengamot. Draco can’t stop staring at the shoes, because he’s scared. He's so scared and looking at it will make it worse.
“But he’s scheduled to be here,” Harry says, mania rising with each syllable. Flo is holding four tiny needles and looks ready to put one through Harry’s eye.
“Where are we?” he’d asked, for at least the third time.
Malfoy drags Harry to the precipice of a crumbling staircase when Harry forces him to stop. “What if Emma doesn’t want me?” Harry asks, years of living as quietly as he could catching up with him.
Except that he doesn’t have one. Harry never gave it back, never—
“Obviously not!”
A sharp bolt of red light shoots past Draco’s right ear. “Motherfucker!” he says, dropping to the ground, pressing himself flat against the pavement as another curse whizzes past.
she asks.
Slow, determined breaths to remind his lungs that they knew what to do and that he wasn’t dying. Not again. Not now. Not yet.
Beneath the enormous text is a photograph that Harry would frame if Draco would let him. Harry remembers the moment from two weeks ago as clearly as if it’d been preserved in his pensieve. They’d been hiking, had popped out of the trails near a tiny town—
“Not while I’m still living,” his mother said. “With your father in…” she’d stumbled. “Without your father, I have full control over the Malfoy estate. It has to be me.”
“That won’t be a problem,” Draco had answered, seriously. He’d learned early on that it was best to treat all of Robertson’s concerns with levity.
“You want it. I know you do.”
“No,” Draco says. “Maybe when I was sixteen. But things...change.” Draco sighs and it’s forever on the exhale.
The night had fallen on the world hours ago. Draco couldn’t see much past the truck’s high beams. They carved the dark open with their solitary blast of white light.
Draco thinks.
Viola’s mum has tears in her eyelashes. “Oh,” she says. “Alright.”
“How much rum is in this?” Harry asks, grinning as he tries to find the answer in the aroma coming off the steam.
“Not quite.” Draco leans in, conspiratorially. Pansy matches him. “This Jesus had the gall to
for Malfoy!” Harry spluttered.
Draco looks up at the tower of titles climbing the walls in front of him with grim determination. Robertson may be filled with more words than the British Library, but his organizational instincts had lost the plot—often quite literally.
what you break the silence to say?”
The light leaves Draco’s eyes. “I’m a ghost Potter. Didn’t you know?”
“Let’s chase it with something tastier,” Pansy says, her eyes following the same halter-top and curly brown hair into a hundred dancing bodies.
The night sky washes the scene in a black and white filter. Harry takes in the familiar street, the slant of the house—his house. A few feet away, atop the front steps of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, blood pours from Draco’s chest.
He’d wanted it to be a fever dream, he’d wanted it to be pretend.
Bright white light burns holes in his eyelids.
she says, grip tightening.
Draco tries not to think of it, as he approaches their usual table and Pansy doesn’t look up.
Which is when he sees the black lines crawling over exposed flesh. “Your tattoo,” Harry breathes, still clutching, still holding.
“Yes, well, neither can I.” Draco frowns at her. It’d been disturbing, to realize that he vanished when he was pulled into another universe. Until that moment, as he’d sat with Pansy in front of his brand new telyvision and watched his body vanish on the screen, there was still a secret hope. Possibility had been prowling the more optimistic habitats of his psyche.
she’d said.
“Cocoa?” Harry says, tugging at one of the fleece throws on the back of the couch cushions. It smells like Draco.
“What’ve you done?” Draco asks, but the curse doesn’t answer. And someone else is coming.
“When Voldemort—”
“Er—” The syllable punches out.
One of Draco’s fingernails snaps and sends him plunging backwards into the wall. “Motherfucker!”
“You.” Draco’s vibrating with fury. “You did this.”
The house has come back to life, and so has he.
“No. No no,” Harry said. “I’ll just read his progress note.”
The pressure tightens as they step through the enormous gate, the lock slithering open in response to Pansy’s hand on the iron. The ground is shuddering beneath his feet and Harry only realizes that it’s him who’s shaking when a hand settles on his upper arm. It’s Pansy and the touch is steadying. “Haven’t been back since that—that night,” Harry says in response to the questions in Pansy’s eyes.
“This was a stupid idea.” Harry kicked the heavy gate for emphasis and then squealed as pain shot through his foot. “Fuck!”
“Are you okay?” There’d been worry between his eyebrows, on the edges of his lips. The truck was slowing down. Potter flicked the indicator and was drifting towards the shoulder.
The yowls that rend the air sound like the mouth of hell grinding open. “Bella, if you don’t stop, I’m going to feed you kale for a week.” It’s an empty threat and Bella, who’s blinking up at Harry with those enormous pupils, knows it too.
“Harry Potter! What the fuck?!”
“Oh,” Harry says, as if the reason for his presence should be obvious. “I’m here to provide testimony for their defense.”
“Me too.”
“He’s…” Harry’s throat struggles for a moment, the words sticking like a wish bone. “He’s bloody brilliant at it. Like, really fucking good.”
A shock of white-blonde hair.
“Oh.” John wasn’t dropping it. Insisted on highlighting Draco’s shame. “I don’t know what gave you that idea.”
“You’re doing such a lovely job convincing me to live.” Feelings had always been a cloak and dagger affair. Malfoys approached their emotions like their posture—rigid, straight backed, controlled. John refused to acknowledge the Pureblood rules of emotional disclosure and Draco feels strange and scrubbed and a bit exposed.
“You’re so emo, Draco,” she finally says, bouncing a paper coaster off his forehead.
“A house party?” asks Harry, and he’s briefly hurt that she hasn’t invited him.
“Spread your dreams beneath his feet,” Robertson says. “And perhaps then you will deserve his affections.”
“F—fuck—” Draco stutters, and it doesn’t matter what universe they’re in, Harry flinches at the fear in his voice. It’s instinct. Harry rushes forwards, reaches for Draco as he collapses in a pile of pain and surprise, but Harry’s hands pass straight through him.
Harry thinks, looking at Malfoy walking purposefully a few feet in front of him.  Black denim should be illegal—god, the contrast with the white-blond hair. Malfoy’s wearing a simple t-shirt with the word NIRVANA on it. There’s a picture of a pink and blue man underneath the lettering. It’s a t-shirt and shouldn’t do things to Harry, but the way that it stretches tight across Malfoy’s shoulders—
Lets him.
Draco snorts. Its undignified but he can’t help it.
“Potter, if you don’t open up, I’m going to blast this door off its hinges.”
“We did,” Harry says, and knows he’s blushing.
Fear nips at his heels, cold as the Alaskan Tundra. It had only happened once though, and Pansy was an inattentive sort when other people were paying attention to her.
The cars rush by, headlights blinking into the distance.
The pause feels infinite, the entire universe feels contained within this single moment and Harry can’t move or think or breathe.
“Precedent?” Harry says, confused.
Long legs. Sharp angles.
At first, Harry thinks he’s gone to the loo. Or maybe to find another bottle. But he doesn’t come back and a strange irritation itches under Harry’s skin.
“You dramatic little shit…”
“Here!” someone says, a stranger with sandy brown hair and an angry mouth. He’s above Draco, his boot pressing hard against Draco’s windpipe. “I’ve got one.”
“He’s one of the new residents,” Malfoy adds, giving Harry’s hand a barely perceptible squeeze.
Words won’t calm him, and Pansy seems to know better. One hand, nails dipped in Muggle culture that she would have spat on a few months ago, reaches for him, grabs hold, and drags him back from the ledge.
“It’s finally happened,” says Ron, waving Hermione over to the hearth with frantic hands.
“How…” The moment feels fragile and Harry’s sure that he’ll break it. His words have always been blunt objects.
“If you think I’m joking, you and your fucking door are about to suffer for your miscalculation.”
“I will. Next time I see him.”
Draco stands in front of the window, makes stern eye contact with his reflection. “All by myself!” he shrieks, because he’s not singing anymore, and he pushes the high note from his lungs. One hand clutches the curled newspaper, while the other stretches in front of him, raising slowly up from waist to chin. As he belts out the final syllable “ANYMORE!!” his fingers snap into a fist
“I didn’t mean to do that to your mum—”
!” Robertson booms, white beard bristling. Even at rest, Robertson’s voice is just louder than the average person. “Or perhaps
“Meatball subs?”
And then Harry had asked Draco to take him shopping for a suit, correctly assuming that he would not have missed the opportunity to see himself in the most exquisite clothing Muggles had to offer. Starting small.
“Are you trying to torture me?!” Pansy says, looking at the device in the middle of Draco’s ballroom with open suspicion.
“What?”
“I’ve plans to make a borscht. Now, stop interrupting. The story must be out!”
The intimacy of the unedited story stuns him still and Harry’s helpless as the rest of the memory unfolds.
“Your mother’s not playing around,” Pansy says, her frosted tips catching the fading light.
Harry starts and deletes several words until he finally settles on:
The door is closed and there’s no light peeking out from beneath the frame.
John smiles. “It’s hard to picture you in love,” he says, not unkindly.
It had always been this way, with Draco.
. Draco had fallen in love with him under the stars of a frozen tundra, in the throes of a haunted house determined to suck out his soul, in the middle of mystery of vanishing portraits and under the auspices of a thousand will they, won’t theys. He’d loved him in robes auror red and healer green. Muggle or magician. He loved every version of Harry Potter.
“I didn’t—Draco I didn’t mean—”
she says.
“How did you—”
“A mobile unit will divert unnecessary patients from A&E. Which saves you huge sums of money, because in Emergency, you are paying several staff to address the patient’s needs. Reception, nursing, Lab, physicians. Mental health.”
“Out,” Potter says, a single word that does not offer any room for disagreement. Three professionals, bona fide adults, don’t dare question the Boy Who Lived—not when his eyes rage and all of that magic shivers in the air around him. They hurry out like chattel.
Something like fear twists in Harry’s gut then. “There’re coffee places open. He’s just gone out for a sec. That’s all.”
And Harry starts to understand.
Draco’s jaw starts to quiver, but this is not the venue for vulnerability. Teeth clenched tight enough to shatter, Draco manages a quick nod.
“I think you might be projecting your war trauma onto this sweet little thing,” Hermione said as Bella licked the tips of her fingers.
In the end, it had been a bit more complicated than that. Draco had apparated to the manor—he had his wand now—and Minty had met him in the shattered remnants of his front door. It stood like a missing tooth. “Go to your room, Master Draco sir. Go straight to your room until we can finish making this right.” There were Aurors in the ballroom, but Minty pushed him past their blue tape and flashing cameras. “Don’t look, Master Draco. Don’t look.” The sagging skin around Minty’s eyes had been red and swollen.
“I’m attaching these pads to your chest,” Emma says and Harry is happy she’s here with him. The heart rhythm is not behaving and Mike is quivering on the stretcher.
And Draco’s scared, because this is also the voice that spat
He’d only seen Malfoy a handful of times. Once, bizarrely, had been at a wizarding night club once, a couple of weeks after the trial. There had always been an air of untouchability about Malfoy; his shirts were too crisp, his demeanour too cutting to engage in something so common as dancing. Socializing with the proletariat, and Muggles to boot, had never seemed very
“We will consider your testimony and return with a verdict,” the man with the gavel says. “This court will recess for twenty minutes.”
Draco had made his peace with the audience, but he still hadn’t expected there to be
Harry shakes his head, green eyes glazed with guilt.
“What is it?” the memory asks.
“What?” It was then that he’d known, in the uncanny way that Harry always knew when danger was stepping onto the stage to turn the tale into tragedy, that something was wrong.
Which left Harry standing in front of an enormous gate with a wand in a box, no plan, and no idea what to do next. Someone was going to have to let him in, but there wasn’t an intercom or a buzzer and Harry had no idea how wizards handled unexpected callers without the convenience of Muggle technology.
“How dare you?”
“We’re doing it,” he says, waving Ron’s scowl and Hermione’s pinched lips away impatiently. “Tell me what I need to do.”
, Harry thinks, considering how well Hermione reads his face.
Draco follows Pansy’s skeptical glance around the room, and does feel that he owes her an explanation.
“Please!” Harry said, rushing into a familiar room. The ballroom. Harry knew the fireplace, the mirror, could picture where the chandelier had hung before Dobby had brought it crashing down.
“You can see me?” Malfoy asks, quiet, as if the words aren’t meant for Harry.
“I can’t see how you will ever deserve him,” Robertson says, hand still outstretched with a few coins, a bit dazed. “Even felons need love too, you see.”
Until something impossible happens and no one recognizes him
“Are you dreaming about Draco?” Hermione asks, her bushy head popping up from behind a pile of books.
And Bella has pushed it to the very edge of the countertop, letting it teeter. One gentle tap, barely a push, and it will go clattering to the floor.
“What are you on about?” Harry says as Hermione joins them.
No one did. The mass of bodies disperses, anger sinking back into the mix of the everyday. The osmosis of trauma in a world that won’t stop hurting.
Pansy’s breath shudders. “I didn’t mean…forget that I said—”
“This is weird,” Draco says. As he plucks one of his pens out of the jar on his desk, Harry realizes that Draco does still indulges in some of the finer things. The pen he cradles between those long fingers is heavy and the liquid is so coming out so soft and easy—
“Draco, your coat,” Harry said, reaching for a lumpy thing that was far too hideous to be a coat. But Draco was already tugging at the ancient metal handle. He didn’t need a coat. He needed to get out—
“I’m not sure anyone will ever live up to those standards,” Draco says. “But thank you. Honestly.” He means it—feels something in his chest kindle knowing that there is someone out there who thinks him deserving.
“I’m going to remove your skin with my tweezers,” Pansy says, tears in her eyes, before she crashes into him. “I was worried,” she whispers and it’s so vulnerable, Harry wishes he weren’t hearing it.
Draco thinks and hates himself just a little more than before. Hate piling on top of hate piling on top of hate. Draco hadn’t known his self-loathing could reach such great heights.
“I’ve got to—” Harry starts, “start shift in—” And stops.
Draco was not in the next day, either.
“I could have just hexed you. You were breaking and entering, you know,” Pansy drawls, taking a generous sip of her wine.
But he’s more scared to let his mother go alone.
Harry takes another step.
, it hurts. “The end result doesn’t change.”
Malfoy had shuddered. His eyes stayed closed.
“Uh,” Harry gasps. His breathing is out of control and the dirt won’t go back into Draco’s plastic pot. “I’m—” But there’s no way to finish that sentence, because there is no explanation for what he’s doing.
The posh twat had come to collect Harry at 10:01, a bottle of wine in hand, and quite literally dragged him away from his files. Harry’d been distracted by how Malfoy’s fingers had tightened around his upper arm—warm, insistent, like a brand. And then he’d looked up at Malfoy himself, and it had sent his whole body into emergency conditions.
“Draco, I’m—”
“Set up a perimeter,” a familiar voice says, and Draco feels his muscles loosen, feels himself lean towards the sound. Inexplicably drawn to Harry Potter.
* * *
“A what?”
“That particular retort doesn’t do much to inspire confidence, young man,” he says, and then proffers a hand. “I am Robertson.”
And there was the proof. Someone had blown the enormous wooden door clean off its hinges.
Until Hermione mentioned the trial of Draco and Narcissa Malfoy—speculation about which was splashed all over the Witch Weekly.
Malfoy, who
“I see that.” Draco bites his lips to keep from grinning. Robertson is not to be laughed at.
Later, with Pansy sprawled across his bedroom floor in a velour track suit, Draco feels the wrongness of the day settle like debris. These were not the dreams he’d had at eleven, boarding the Hogwarts express and waving goodbye to his childhood. He’d not imagined himself a public enemy, a villain. He’d never thought himself to be a cautionary tale.
He could have made it, he tells himself, except he was in clinic most of the week and hasn’t run into Draco at all, and besides, who lets their lips almost brush up against his and then just leaves without a word?
” Draco says, soft.
“I’m waxing biblical,” Draco says, slipping into a booth. “Have you ever heard about the crucifixion?”
Potter snorted. “No shit.”
“Draco—”
the curse says.
Draco rolls his eyes. “No need to make it sound so dramatic.”
“Tired is better than sad,” he whispers to the tile. “Tired is better than sad.”
he thinks as Harry moves, hips swaying easy, casual, without urgency. As if he could drive Draco’s pleasure to the brink and just hold him there, dangling over oblivion without a wand, without a broom, with just the promise in Harry’s eyes as he looks down at him.
“Hey! You!” the Auror says, his voice gruff and feral. “Step down from the ledge!”
Memories of not-Potter’s face when Draco had asked if he could look under the hood of the car come rushing back. “Horrific, thank you for asking.”
Malfoy said nothing, but Harry heard that unmistakable sound of flies unzipping.
“Oh Harry!” she says. “Why don’t you come through. We’ll have a cup of tea and you can tell us everything.”
“Hermione!” Ron yells into the silence and soft candlelight.
King’s Cross blinks at him, the white halls a place where he’d thought he’d left a part of himself behind. “I think so.”
“I do not.”
The curse hadn’t touched him the night he cast it. There was a lingering feeling, like fingers on the back of his neck, that made him sure he’d produced
Back in 2003, Bella destroys Harry’s kitchenware and Harry pretends that he’s not stalking Draco Malfoy (sure Harry).
“Could I?” Malfoy passes him the bottle. The air feels damp on Harry’s tongue.
Come find me on tumblr!
But Harry sees them, dark lines shocking against that pale skin.
“Yes. It was.” The office feels small.
“Right,” Harry says, but he’s not listening. Harry's lost control of the pace and content of his inner monologue, and so hasn't stopped thinking,
“They’re socks,” the woman snaps.
Scenarios flash through Harry’s head.
“Has been for years. It drags him into the multi-verse.”
Harry kisses the skull and the snake and Draco starts to shiver, violent and afraid.
Mouth a thin line, Harry moves towards the mirror. “You know,” Harry says, voice warm, flavours of want and affection twisting in the vowels. “I think I prefer a suit to dress robes.”
“That depends,” not-Potter says, leaning across the counter.
“Idiots,” she sighs. “That’s you, Potty.”
she says.
“Just drink it,” Pansy says, thumping his back and Harry doesn’t have the heart to tell her that doesn’t actually help people who are choking.
“Yes,” Malfoy finally said. Harry could see him. He was looking at his feet.
It strikes Harry just then how difficult this all must be for Draco. Being thrust into different worlds, with no advance notice of who he’s supposed to be or what’s waiting for him. It’s a dangerous game, and Draco could refuse to play. He could let the blood flow from his veins and never raise a wand in protest, could throw Harry into the forgotten fields of snow and drive off into the northern lights, and it wouldn’t change anything. Not in their timeline.
“Quick quills,” Harry says, collapsing into his hands. Under his elbows, a few of the paper charts fall to the floor. “I fucking hate these stupid pens. Like, I know that they’re a clever invention. I get that. But I’m this close to breaking the international statute of secrecy, for a fucking quick quill.”
Draco’s eyes pin him in place. “Harry. Harry. Harry.”
“Right.” Draco turns, taking the pain on his face away, where Harry can’t see it.
The laugh that tears out of him bleeds at the edges. “In what universe,” Harry says, slow and furious and cold, “could I ever love you?”
he thinks, and is captivated by what could have been if he’d made one different choice.
For a moment, Harry loses his purpose in the memories of a forest, the green light, the pained whimpers of something bloody and broken and the insistence that “you can’t help.”
Something is wrong; Harry Potter is not alright.
Draco feels Harry’s magic humming; Potter’s always been powerful, and that hasn’t changed in this universe. The street is a battlefield, curses flying everywhere, and Potter is a power plant, magic is rolling off of him in waves. There are civilians everywhere, trying to escape the duel that spilled out into their everyday lives.
“Because you were looking for a carpool? And I agreed to take you, because I’m way too nice, apparently?”
“No.”
“Yes,” Draco whispers. When he lets himself think about it, in the hours after returning from another glimpse, another universe, Draco knows that he hadn’t stood a chance. That falling for Potter was as inevitable as breathing. He’d always been weak for Potter’s attention—he just hadn’t known that the pendulum could swing so far. “If you had to watch repeated iterations of Potter being stubborn and perfect and in love with
Draco looks over his shoulder, sees the white and blue bleaching the night, and slips his mobile back into his pocket. “This,” he says, “can’t be good.”
But stops short because he realizes that that would be a lie. “Fuck. Sorry?”
Shacklebolt had owled him every day for two months. Reporters published front page spreads on everything from his takeout preferences (greasy), his love life (shambles, since Ginny’s left), and his political affiliations (unknown).
“Past one o’clock,” Draco says, checking his watch.
“Look at you, more than just a pretty face.” Pansy kicks him under the table while simultaneously downing another shot. One can’t help but admire her coordination. “Come on.”
“Administer diazepam, 0.1mg,” Harry says.
“Mate, we’ve been waiting for this day for years.”
Pressure. Hot and hard, moving against his back, rutting between his legs.
“Are you ready?” Harry asks, reaching for the hand on his hip, weaving their fingers together. The gesture is so tactile, so effortless, that it leaves a sting behind Draco’s eyes.
He’d tried to tell Ron once, in a fit of desperation after far too much Firewiskey.
Bella, though, is made of steel and Harry should know better; the bitch is not to be intimidated.
The man grins and it’s cheeky as an ambush behind enemy lines. “I shall call you captain monosyllable.”
The lip of the mug is chipped. Harry stares into the steam, watching it lick the porcelain, and Draco doesn’t say anything. The quiet is a kindness.
“That’s really not how we normally handle these things. The counsellors have a lot of insight into the patient’s mental state. It’s important to listen—”
“And I went and fucked it anyway.” Harry laughs and it scrapes on the way out.
“And deception was kind of his hallmark. So it doesn’t really make sense,” Hermione says.
Draco hadn’t known how to interpret the question. How deeply did Harry Potter wonder about the trajectory of his life? Hours, days, years?
“I’m sure it is, but—”
“That shouldn’t be allowed,” Draco said, too stunned to filter. “Human civilization should refuse to colonize spaces so hideously inhospitable.”
“We’ve been in classes together for two year,” Potter said, sounding a bit morose. “I thought you liked me well enough.”
Pain shudders, bright and fresh across his chest, and this is a wound that he knows. Remembers. A bathroom, the angry syllables of
“I don’t like—bad boys?—what are we, twelve?”
The lift spirits them to the fourth floor.
Harry lowers the book to eye level and shrugs. Everything has felt a bit fuzzy since Robertson said the words “love” and “there it is.”
“I want to move to London!” Pansy says, and Draco’s confused.

The IV cart is screeching and the violent sound of alarms crack the hum of the department. Harry glances at the numbers wriggling across the screen.
he reminds himself as he settles into place.
“Why not?” Potter asked, shivering in his long sleeve.
“It’s multiple universes. The multiverse, Potter. Keep up.”
“The curse!” Draco’s not sure why he’s having this conversation now. “She says I have to fix it. Or that the other universes will…” He tries to gulp the truth back down, but it’s like bile in his throat. It needs out. “They’ll pare me away to nothing.”
Fifteen minutes and several city blocks later, Draco sheds his robes and drapes them over one arm. He’s wearing grey slacks and a white button up beneath his work clothes—Draco is always pleased to discover that he has style in every universe.
Harry forces the squiggly lines of Viola Pinkerton’s chart back into focus.
“You’re perfect, so perfect.”
But Draco doesn’t feel distressed. He feels tired and wonderfully indifferent. Light. Draco wonders if this was why Potter had returned to this spot, over and over; the journey had looked well-worn.
Because Draco didn’t deserve nice things. He didn’t get to have things he wanted. He didn’t get—
“Draco, I know you’re a Brit, but you’ve lived here for three years—”
, Draco thinks, turning to wrap his entire world up in his arms.
