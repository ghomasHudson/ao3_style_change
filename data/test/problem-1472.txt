“Don’t let us keep you!” They laughed, and allowed him to leave their shop wondering what on earth they were thinking. It didn’t bode well for the Ministry, in any case. He smiled, shaking his head and hurried the last hundred meters or so to his destination. It was a narrow, unimpressive building on the corner of Diagon and Knockturn, and it didn’t advertise anything. Strange. It used to. Malfoy was definitely up to something.
“I’m not selling my engagement ring to Potter.” He spat out the name like he used to and desperately tried to recall the old feeling of hatred that used to go with it. He didn’t succeed.
The pure act in itself was very unlike the Malfoy Harry had grown to dislike since their first meeting in Madam Malkin’s robe shop—what was it now? 14 years ago? It didn’t make any sense, and neither did his urgent need to help the sarcastic sod. Still, Malfoy or no Malfoy—Harry could sympathise with the people in need. It wasn’t like he had no experience in being unwelcome, especially by family.
But he couldn’t lie to Hermione. She’d find out sooner or later. And… and whether he liked it or not, the idea of not seeing Malfoy again felt alarmingly wrong.
“Theo better up his game in the vegetable garden then if we want to feed all our hungry mouths.” Draco tried to joke, but it was a lot less funny because they might actually have to rely on that. The house was paid off, but none of the staff members had access to their family money anymore and only Blaise had a paid job. A job he’d have to give up if he kept working this much for their safe house. The last thing they needed was for him to get a burn out.
“Just a moment,” she told him, and left him standing in the porchway. As soon as Potter could no longer see her, she broke into a jog before Pansy or Draco could say anything too damaging. Said squabblers were standing at the far side with their shoulders squared, Draco looked as though he could possibly spit venom. Unsure of how else to intervene, Astoria slammed the kitchen door to gain their attention. “Potter is in the foyer.”
“Why would Malfoy need to sell his ring if he had this lying around?” Ron asked, clearly distrusting the motives behind Astoria’s presence. “And why not bring it himself?”
“I think these will be enough,” he said. “To be honest, I'm not sure I know twenty people who are worth writing to.”
Sod Malfoy. Harry was going to help, even if it meant going through Pansy or Astoria; no one deserved to be outcasted, censored or threatened for being themselves—not at Christmas, not ever.
It wasn’t the eloquent plea Ron and Hermione had expected of him, but Harry knew Malfoy, he knew that any pretence would be scrutinised and mistrusted—more so than usual. Harry folded the parchment into an envelope, wrote Malfoy’s name on the front and summoned Kreacher.
“Where is it?” Pansy’s eyes were sharp like a hawk’s, and Astoria gestured at her purse, sitting on the floor beside the sofa.
“That’s good to know,” Madam Malkin answered, and Draco could sense the relief in her voice. He smiled reassuringly and settled back down while she chose a piece of firm, smooth elastic cotton and started to wrap it around a mannequin, which she then adjusted to match Tiresias’ size. “Is it their first binder?” She asked, and at Draco’s confirmation, she started to cut and stitch so blindingly fast that he couldn’t follow her hand movements. “I’ll write some instructions on its use in that case.”
But mostly, Draco just hated his own feelings—hated the humiliation of having to sell his right to marry, and the knowledge that, if no one else contacted him soon, he'd have no choice but to accept whatever offer Potter was trying to make.
“I can hear you, you know.” Draco threw the piece of parchment into the bin without reading it through. His father had apparently learned some brand-new insults in Azkaban, and he wasn’t interested in knowing them.
“18th-century heirloom. It’s in peak condition and has been passed down through generations,” she told him, leaving out the fact that it was her family heirloom.
“Will do.” She’d led him into the living as she talked, and when Harry didn’t add anything further, she made a little excited jump and went for a pile of LPs stacked under the stairs.
Draco locked eyes with Pansy, defiant. He hadn’t thought about that, but he wasn’t about to admit it out loud. “We’ll figure that out in due time, I’m sure. Right now, all that matters is that those kids don’t spend their holidays in an environment that makes them wish they weren’t alive.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Pansy ushered him, gesturing towards the front door. “Off you go now. You have a lot of work to do.”
felt like the wrong word. In the end, he paused so long Draco quite clearly got fed up and continued himself.
“I told you to stop talking bollocks,” Pansy said sternly, moving so she sat on the sofa and lifting Astoria’s head in her lap.
Malfoy glared at him. “Aren't I supposed to be the Slytherin here? And what makes you think you have any right to get to know me?”
“He has,” she lied. “I’m not here on his behalf any longer now that his ring is no longer available. Instead, I came to ask if you would buy something else.”
“You not being violent? I distinctly remember you punching me in fifth year, and you stomped on my face at the start of sixth year…” Harry mused, enjoying the way he could feel the two of them fall back into banter. It almost felt like they were back at Hogwarts again. “You’re not known to be a nice person, Draco.”
Harry smirked. “Oh, I know I do. I know what his favourite café is, and at what times he likes to go. I’ll make him an offer he can’t decline.”
In that moment, Harry regretted freeing Kreacher more than he'd ever regretted anything in his life.
“I’m alright, mate,” Ron said, heading towards the kitchen. Astoria followed, leaving Harry to enter the kitchen last. “Steak. Nice.”
“Of course, dear.” Madam Malkin strode towards the little door behind the counter and held it open for him. He sat down as she cast a
“That’s what I was trying to tell them, too. But—Merlin. The daft buggers! They think Dean’s responsible for the graffiti!”
Pansy swallowed. “We received the last payment today,” she said simply, as though she hadn’t been silent for almost ten minutes. “Astoria’s heirloom is now officially yours.”
“You’re good at this,” Draco told Joan who shot him a curious look when he chose a candy cane shape to decorate. They sat in silence, Joan occasionally watching what he did and pointing to different decorations to use when he hesitated. Draco figured she would have told him everything he was doing wrong if she vocalised her conversation, but her reticent continued unspoken of.
“Good, you’re awake,” Pansy’s voice said, hotly. Draco turned on the sofa to see her stood in the doorway, an apron around her waist. She looked far more rested than he felt, and her stony look reminded him of where they’d left off last night. “Joan, Astoria and I are in the kitchen should you wish to join us. There’ll be no more tantrums today, so if you can’t behave then I recommend excusing yourself.” The way she spoke down to him like a child riled up the stubbornness in him, and he was just about to ask her who she was talking to when Joan appeared at her side, covered in flour with a smile on her face. “We’re making shortbread,” Pansy said as Joan held out her palm, showcasing a star-shaped dough with red edible balls pressed in around the edges. Joan jerked her head to the side, a gesture down the hallway towards the kitchen.
No. That was not the reason he should stay and face Draco Malfoy. He wasn’t a bloody coward. He was Harry Potter. He’d killed a Basilisk. He’d defeated Voldemort. And most importantly, he held the record for the most liquorice wands swallowed in under five minutes in the Weasley family. He could do this. He could do
He expected Draco to falter at that, thrown off by his probably quite unpredictable response, but nothing of the sort happened. Instead Draco drew his lips into a thin line, before answering in an almost detached voice, “I’ll have Astoria send you the bank paperwork and the price and sale details. Sign the check and the ring is yours.”
At the sight of Malfoy's furrowed frown and his lilac lips pulled into his characteristic scowl, Harry's heart did a little somersault in what he recognised as excitement.
He stared at the other man, struck again by how much he had changed over the last few years. Malfoy was taller than he had been in school and his features were even more well-defined than Harry remembered—high cheekbones, flashing silver eyes ...
”Yes, thank you, Pansy. Potter doesn't need the sob story, I'm sure. He's far too important and busy for the likes of us. In fact, he was just leaving, weren't you, Potter?”
need to be the one deciding where I spend the money on. For once in my life, I know what I’m doing and the last thing I need is for you to swoop in, trying to be the saviour with your money and boy hero status and muck everything all up. So stop fucking assuming anything about anything because you don’t understand it now and you probably never will. Stop inviting me to coffee places expecting a cosy chat after coming in half an hour late. It’s not what I’m here for. Either buy that stupid ring or don’t, but keep your nose out of my business.”
“So if he promises me—with an Unbreakable—that he'll marry the right person when he meets them, then everything—”
“I am,” he admitted. At the look of chastising on her face, he added, “Sorry for not coming earlier. We've had a bit of a financial problem this year, and—”
“That won't be necessary.” Draco had promptly decided he couldn't stay. He needed to get his words out and leave before the image of Potter in woolly clothes, with his ruffled hair and warm cheeks, ingrained itself into his mind. “I'm not interested in whatever it is you have to say. I came here to tell you that you need to leave me alone. You have no right to step into my life or my projects, and I swear, if you tell anyone about the safehouse I won't sleep until I—”
“But we can’t make money appear out of nowhere either, Draco.” Astoria’s face grew hard and serious. Her brilliant no nonsense attitude was what had kept the financial side of the safe house afloat all these years. “I’m sure people will understand. It’s probably quite enough for them to have a safe space.”
As per usual, his first batch of brownie mix ended up on the floor—but the second one made it to the oven. The rhythm of cleaning up as he baked set his mind right and, as he exercised his left arm with mediocre tasks, the shakes slowly let up. That, along with the delicious smell that filled the kitchen, allowed him to relax, and he tried to remember what it was that he’d been dreaming about. The only two things that came to mind were a looming feeling of anxiety and... and Malfoy. The prat had probably been attacking him with a curse if his usual nightmares were anything to go by.
“When isn’t it?” Ron asked, muttering to himself. Harry turned to Astoria, who was clutching her bag while looking around with mild interest.
“You were inconsolable. It was only the next day that we found out the Dark Lord had been vanquished, and we forgot about your mysterious woes. It didn’t happen again.”
“Whatever.” Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to making breakfast. He had more important things to do than worry about Astoria’s opinion of him and his choices. Because with Christmas right around the corner and family tensions at a year’s high, a lot of people would be looking for a way out.
“We don’t have time, we’ve exhausted all of our options.” He pulled away, his gaze torn. “I need you to deal with this.” Astoria frowned and was about to try dissuading him again. “We don’t have time,” Draco repeated, his tone sharp. “The first of our guests will be arriving in a few days. We need the money.”
Hermione’s eyes widened. An instant later, she was smiling. “That’s a lovely idea!” she said. “And it’s very mature of you, you know. To want to make such a friendly gesture towards your former—what did you use to call him? Your
Draco swiftly turned to his friend. “Were you? What on Earth for?” She’d better not been trying to get his ring back, or he’d swear—
“Er, thank you,” Draco said through the lump on his throat. What had he ever done to deserve this woman's friendship?
“Sounds like fun,” he said. He wasn’t sure if it did or if he were humouring her, and he was far too tired to decipher his intent with Pansy still shooting cool daggers at him. “I need to get changed, I’ll be through shortly.” This was enough for Joan, who left them, heading back down the hallway to the kitchen.
“Unexpected, yes I know. For the Draco that you know it definitely is, but I am hardly the same person as I used to be at Hogwarts. You wouldn’t be able to name a single fact about me even if I put a gun to your head.” Draco suddenly got quite red when he said that, making his cheeks match his lipstick. “Not that I would ever be violent, it’s just a saying.”
“Potter is going to buy my ring,” he announced, taking it from his pocket and slamming it down on the countertop. “I need you to contact him with payment details.” Astoria rose, closing her book, and made her way over to Draco with a concerned gaze.
is selling his ring to raise money for Christmas gifts for the people he supports—people who have been cast out by friends or family for being who they are.”
Foundation could help, and then… what? Offer to buy the ring? That doesn’t solve the magical contract problem.”
He gripped the cushion on either side of his legs and glared into the simmering glow of the fireplace. It was late, very late, so late, in fact, that you could call it early. He wasn’t able to sleep though, not with his home becoming an imbroglio of ‘don’t ask’ and silent conversations. All thanks to Potter. The impertinent fool just had to stick his saviour complex into everyone else's business, didn’t he? Mindless twit.
Harry had bid Ron and Hermione goodbye that night with clear intentions, although his friends still weren’t quite so confident in his charismatic abilities—especially when it came to likes of Draco Malfoy. Nevertheless, Harry went straight to his living room coffee table and scribbled out a letter in grey ink that gave the impression of a led pencil.
Astoria was singing when he entered, and he could tell instantly that whatever had been plaguing her mood was now resolved, and given Pansy’s secrecy—well, he could put two and two together. Joan was at the table, decorating variously shaped dough with sugar decorations. He decided to join her, and spare himself another dressing down from Pansy that he knew he couldn’t brush off again.
Astoria would have told him she wasn’t his house-elf but didn’t. It was clear Draco wasn’t in a good place, and she didn’t blame him. She watched him leave, his eyes sadly falling on the ring box one last time. Tension squared her shoulders; she knew what she had to do—she’d known for a while now, but hope had kept her from following through. It was shit, but not as shit as Draco selling his ring. Astoria collected the box from the counter, her book from the chair, and her teacup from the table; she made her way to the top of the house.
The idiot had been staring at him. It had irked Draco to no end, and he was fairly sure he had sneered into his coffee once or twice as he fantasized about approaching Potter to taunt him, just like in old times.
Foundation. For the first time in a very long time, Harry had felt like he was in control over his life.
Harry turned off the oven and plated two of the cinnamon swirls along with two cups of tea on the table. He scowled when he realised he'd overcooked the damn things, too distracted running to the front door to turn off the oven. Trying not to think about that, about how much a part of him had wished it was Malfoy at the other side, he ran his hands over the cards on the table.
Harry was frying steak on low heat when the doorbell went. He hoped Dean wasn’t early as Hermione and Ron had yet to arrive, and he was in the middle of making dinner for one. He transferred the pan to an unlit hob and headed down the narrow corridor to the front door. When he opened it, his eyes first went to Ron, who looked noticeably uncomfortable. His first thought was that he and Hermione were having a spat, but she wasn’t present. Instead, Astoria Greengrass was standing beside him with a stoic gaze.
“Sorry mate, but I had a feeling you’d want to hear her out,” Ron said, and shrugged. Astoria pursed her lips, the only sign of emotion.
“Don’t worry, Harry knows me already!” Said Tiresias as she stood up, a pile of LPs in her arms. “And I wouldn’t take him anywhere near Draco’s stuff! I know what he's like!”
“Well good morning my dear female presenting nipple friend.” Astoria wandered into the kitchen and pulled him into a hug. She beamed at him despite how shit their current situation was. “Did you sleep well?”
Zabini made to leave, and Harry, panicking a bit, babbled, “W-wait. Aren’t you going to ask me what I’m doing here?” He'd really hoped this would be a short visit. Come, give them the postcard, leave. Easy peasy.
“You can’t. Or… you can, but it’s going to be super awkward. When you buy that thing, you see, he’s essentially giving up on his chance to get wed. And that’s not something you can easily return to him. Not without marrying him.”
Which had led to the hilarious yet depressing result that Draco’s in-drag photoshoot from a Witch Weekly edition published last year was now banned.
The first thing Draco saw when he headed outside his bedroom the next morning was a piece of parchment on the floor. Someone must have slipped it under the door during the night. He cast a few spells on it from a distance—one could never trust anything that came from Knockturn Alley—then picked it up and sat on the sofa.
The box was what she retrieved, and though her heart yearned to take the contents out, she couldn’t bear the thought of refreshing her memory before she sold it. Maybe she could buy it back from Potter one day, something Draco would never do.
Draco, helpless to the sheer devastating power of it, fell down on the floor like he'd been struck by a dozen stunners.
Complete silence overwhelmed him. The world around him had frozen. He could feel, but not hear, the erratic rhythm of his heart. It was pure panic.
“How do you—” Ron shook his head. “You know what, I don’t want to know. Just send him an owl asking to meet there. And try to act like you haven’t been stalking him, please.”
Astoria moved out of the way as Draco came at her, his intention to leave the room was clear. Well, if he didn’t believe her before; he was sure about to lose his voice. The kitchen door thumped as it was thrown open and Draco stormed out, muttering irritably to himself like a bloody lunatic. Pansy folded her arms in a sultry fashion as if she had known all along who would win this battle.
“A safe space that goes with a fitting binder and their first pair of heels or lipstick or that one book they’ve wanted since forever.” Draco stepped away from Astoria and glared at her. “I’m not cutting on the Christmas present. I’ll sell a family heirloom if I have to but this is the one Malfoy Family tradition I’m going to keep.”
“You’re absolutely right. Thanks, love.” Pansy winked at Astoria, who blew a kiss at her. “So, tell me, dear. What exactly is the plan after you’ve spent the money you earn with the ring?”
“A chest binder,” Draco said simply. “I know they’ve wanted to have one for a while now, and I’m worried they might start looking for homemade binding methods that could be bad for their health, so I need something that—”
lack of money. She sniffed indignantly and pulled the square box from her bag, trying her utmost hardest not to show how difficult the ordeal was for her. She set it down in front of Harry, who waited a moment before lifting the top off.
With a snicker, Zabini walked past him and gave him a vigorous pat on the shoulder. “Glad to see you again, mate. I have to go, but I’ll leave you with Tiresias. Don’t let them drag you around the house too much, though—there are things in here you don’t want to come across. And by things I mean Draco’s bedroom.”
“You wish,” Harry muttered to himself. After a second, he made up his mind. “Okay, this is what we’re going to do. You're going to take off your coat and have a seat. I’ll make us some tea, and we can have a friendly conversation and behave like the grown-ups we are.”
She hurried to the door, sensing something was off, and when she saw Seamus’ face, she knew she’d been right.
Malfoy's cheeks reddened ever so slightly. He seemed to be shocked by Harry's Christmas decorations—the presents, already stacked under the tree; the snowmen figures standing in between his pictures with the Weasleys. Harry couldn't blame him; Grimmauld really didn't look anything like it had when the Black family owned it.
decent man. Taking in stray kids, buying them gifts, and… well, and wearing red lipstick every other day, apparently. Clearly not what Harry would have expected during their Hogwarts years.
“Answers, Potter. I came here for answers, not to have some friendly chit chat with you. I do have more important things to do with my time, you know?”
“Alright. Oh—don’t enter the purple guest room. There was a girl at the door earlier, Blaise and I set her up in that room. Her name’s Joan—she’s probably sleeping now. Better leave her be for the time being.”
He opened his mouth to ask—who knew what—when Malfoy stepped forward, putting a hand on his shoulder and pushing him towards the door.
Harry started to get an idea about what this year’s project would be. He knocked on the door again, determined to be let back in, but they were clearly ignoring him. Of course. Of course they would find it humiliating to accept his money. Malfoy had made that perfectly clear. There was no way he would let him back inside. So Harry would have to come up with some kind of sneaky secret Santa plan.
“Draco be realistic, please.” Astoria snapped, glaring right back. “The only sellable family heirloom that you still have is your bloody engagement ring, and if you sell that then you’ll forever give up on your ability to marry. We both know how that family magic works.”
“We’ll talk later,” he simply told her and headed upstairs. Whatever it was she and Potter were up to, it was obviously something she wouldn’t tell him; no matter just how much he demanded to know. That left only two other options; he could try and coax it out of Astoria or he could hex it out of Potter. The latter sounded much more enjoyable.
Harry looked down at the piece of paper, at the image of the Malfoy crest and at Draco Malfoy's name and owl address.
Astoria huffed, her expression dark. “The only thing that's terribly wrong here is your makeup, dear.”
Malfoy's hand darted to his wand holster. The motion seemed almost automatic, but it set off every alarm in Harry's brain, making his muscles tense and his breathing quicken.
Harry's eyes flicked from Pansy to Malfoy, who was making a frantic shushing gesture at her, a look of fury on his face.
But the Dark Lord was a cruel master. Too cruel for Draco to keep anyone close. It was too dangerous.
“Nice try, but joking won’t prevent me from talking some sense into that pretty head of yours.” Pansy got up from the couch, grabbed their empty cups of tea and started towards the sink. “Look, I know you want to help those who are suffering, and I know what’s going through your head right now—
“Yeah well we all know past me should have been and has been locked up in a mental hospital so argument lost.” Draco sneered, though he felt quite unhappy about winning when he saw Pansy’s face fall. He’d been banned to the muggle world for three years after the war and a lot of shit had gone down in that time that Pansy didn’t know about yet. The mental hospital wasn’t one of those, but she still blamed herself for not being there for him at the time. He sighed, and tried to push his anger down. “Look, Pansy, I set up this place for people who have nowhere else to go. Mostly people who are deep inside the pureblood community. Potter is anything but that, so he doesn’t need to know. We’re going to be at maximum capacity as it is around Christmas. I don’t want half the Weasley clan banging on my door when mummy didn’t give them a second helping of treacle tart, alright?”
“Believe me, what came to my mind was way worse than marriage,” said Hermione. “See, there’s only one magical contract strong enough to counter the Pureblood Marriage one, and that is the Unbreakable Vow. That was my idea. But I'm sure you'd rather—”
Astoria nodded, all cheeriness gone from her face. “And we’ll have to skim on the Christmas presents this year.”
The attic was her sanctuary. The horizontal slats of the roof were decorated with various bits of coloured tinsel, and the grey leather sofa housed a knitted blanket and two decor pillows she had made herself. Behind said sofa, there was a desk. In the cupboards, she would find receipts, expense and budgeting forms, and a square box that was practically flat.
“Wait,” came a voice from behind him and Harry turned to see Pansy Parkinson step forward. He realised she'd been standing in the doorway watching them and he flushed slightly as he realised how ridiculous he must seem.
The mention of the Malfoy heirloom seemed to rile him up, and a scarlet flush quickly spread over Malfoy's cheeks and neck. He gripped his tea mug with both hands, his jaw setting.
He forced himself to breathe deeply into his belly. He wasn't having an anxiety attack. Not in front of Malfoy.
“That’s a ridiculous price! Harry—” But Potter held up his hand and shushed him, smiling apologetically at Astoria.
It really was a shame they couldn’t run the in-depth research she’d done on mermen’s reproductive rituals, as it featured several explicit, but absolutely necessary illustrations. But she was most regretful about having to scrap the monthly advice column with Draco’s thoughts on readers’ questions about gender and sexuality. With a sigh, Luna pushed away from the desk and looked out of her window. If she wasn’t mistaken, Seamus was approaching her home—and he was alone. How odd.
“Is everything alright?” He asked, his tone softening, remembering what Theo had told him earlier. This must be Joan. Joan shook her head, her eyes glanced around the room before giving Draco a once over. “Can I get you anything?” She shook her head again.
That night, he wasn't cold but Potter would have definitely been freezing. Draco wasn't in any state to wonder whether Potter knew what it meant.
When a bunch of Gryffindors showed up in the Main Hall by the end of the day, the feeling had passed and he got distracted by hating Potter for stealing his House’s rightful glory.
And suddenly, Potter was there, in the castle. Draco lost sight of him soon after Severus fled, but he only had to follow the cold to find him back, in the room of Hidden Things.
So, there was that. He’d gotten that out of the way. Now he would never have to think about Malfoy ag—
“Of course you do, I even made you a list.” Hermione pulled a piece of parchment from her pocket. Harry sighed. He wasn’t sure what he would do without her—she always put far more thought on things than he did. Then again, her mind wasn’t plagued by sinful images of Malfoy in nothing but—
Three hours and several heavy shopping bags later, he returned home. Getting the items he wanted to gift to his friends had cheered him up significantly, and he’d all but forgotten about Astoria’s quiet mood from earlier. Getting home to a dark and seemingly deserted house reminded him, however, and he quickly put his purchases away before checking all the rooms and calling out to his friends. At last, in the kitchen, he found Theo, so absorbed in his cooking that he hadn’t heard Draco return home.
“He’s not even listening to me, is he?” Pansy was still standing right in front of him, but she was facing Astoria. “I can’t believe it. One mention of Harry effing Potter,
“I was cast out into the muggle world completely unprepared for anything. It took years before I managed to find a job and good people who didn’t try to exploit me and when I did manage to crash on someone’s couch it was always offered to me by someone who barely had anything left to spare themselves.” Draco put his coffee cup down with a hard clang before getting up and glaring at Harry.
Hermione frowned at the carpet, still deep in thought. “Forget about it. I'll come up with something else.”
“It’s going to cost you, Potter,” she said stiffly. She wasn’t parting with it if it wouldn’t at least help them through Christmas, New Year and another two to three months. “Nine thousand galleons.”
She chucked the paper back on the desk and it fell open. “It's ridiculous and totally over the top. They're trying to address a very niche issue and instead of using a scalpel it's like they've taken the entire media system and just decided to light it on fire. They're going to be stopping people from handing out pamphlets on the street—”
“Well, that doesn’t make much sense, now does it?” She said rationally, handing him her stress-relief squishy nargle plushie. Seamus’ face became a little less red as he took it, practically squeezing it entirely flat at once. “He’s an artist, not a vandal.”
Friends. He really had said that word out loud, hadn't he? Well, he didn't regret it. Ever since he'd realised he didn't know Malfoy anymore, he'd been feeling… off-balance.
It was cold all year when Draco returned to school and Potter was on the run. He didn't know anymore whether Potter was in imminent danger or under a vague general threat.
Astoria had been half-attentive to the familiar bickering Pansy and Draco had launched into upon his reentry to real life. Potter had always been a sensitive topic what with him being both Draco’s sworn enemy and mid-life crisis waiting to happen. Feeling it unnecessary to excuse herself, she simply drifted from the kitchen towards the entrance, wincing ever so slightly at the pitch rise in Draco’s tone as he declared for the sixth time that he was
“Um, do I?” He tried to sound casual as he ushered her inside. “Must be the heat from the oven. I’m baking cinnamon swirls.” Hermione gave him a you-only-cook-when-you’re-upset look, and before she could make any more comments, Harry asked, “Where’s Ron?” The more the merrier, after all—the more, the less able he would be to zone out and think of—
“There was a big stray dog in that Alley last time Kreacher went there,” Kreacher grumbled. “It tried to bite Kreacher’s leg off, the monstrous fleabag. No, no, Kreacher is most definitely not stepping foot in that Alley ever again! Ever!”
He chose some card with a snowman on it and set to writing to the first person on the list—Molly, of course. He took his time writing to every single Weasley, then Luna, Neville, Dean and Seamus and the rest of their Hogwarts classmates—Even Parvati, though they had barely talked that year—trying not to think about what the hell he’d write on Malfoy’s card.
“He’ll be by in an hour,” Hermione said as she hung her coat up. “I brought some Christmas Cards for you to write in, I know what you’re like.”
With Pansy by his side, it became easier for Draco to distance himself from Potter. To work openly against the Boy Who Lived.
“Why the hell did you have to tell him that?” Draco spun around and glared at Pansy before the echo of his door slam even had the chance to leave the room. “This is a
“Terrific! We’ve been baking all morning, me and Theo and Joan, and ohmygosh, you won’t believe the amount of amazing music they keep in this house! Anyway, how’s Teddy? You’re going to see him today at the Weasley’s, right? Tell him he needs to reply to my owl, I know he’s being a lazy twat about it!”
He had not expected to blurt that out, at all. And by the looks of it Draco hadn’t either. He just sat there, eyes wide, mouth hanging open just a crack, looking utterly shocked. To his credit though, the man only needed five seconds to pull himself together and mould his expression back into something Harry could only call professional. It gave him a slight therapist-y vibe and he didn’t like that one bit. Though given the fact that Draco ran a safe house it made some sort of sense.
He rolled his eyes. “Whatever. I'll find out eventually.” He grabbed his coat, tucked his ears properly under his hat and opened the front door. “See you tonight—make sure Blaise is around before you leave, just in case anyone arrives today.”
Still, Potter was in absolute, undeniable danger. Draco knew. He believed Potter when he said the Dark Lord was back - he'd felt it in his very own bones.
that an angry Malfoy was in his house, but for some reason, he was just... curious. He thought about the wave of Slytherins that had crashed into his life in the past few days, but again, he felt nothing but fondness and... well, and a bit of concern for their well-being.
Draco squinted at her. She was acting suspiciously weird. When she just raised an eyebrow, Draco glanced at Astoria. The look on her face was… off. “What's up with you?” He asked her. “You're never this quiet unless something's terribly wrong.”
The hours passed slowly until 4 pm. Draco didn't tell anyone about his dat—meeting, about his meeting with Potter. He merely told them he had to see someone, then excused himself with enough time to change into decent clothes before leaving. He wanted to feel confident, and brave, and so he put on his favourite pair of boots and his warm, fluffy hat that made his haircut look nice. He looked in the mirror and smiled to himself—but he couldn't ignore the little voice inside his head telling him something was missing. In an impulse, he grabbed the lipstick bar from his bedside table and expertly applied it before leaving the house.
Sighing, Astoria threw herself down on her sofa and pulled the blanket around her. She could feel a headache coming up and she pinched her nose.
Daylight crept in above the curtain rails, rousing Draco from near-slumber to find himself alone. He sat up, confused. He hadn’t actually been asleep, had he? When had Joan left?
“I changed because I fucking lived on the muggle streets searching for food in a trash can. And it fucking sucks that you’ve been abused and I hate the fact that that happened to you but that gives you no right to come into my home with an attitude like this. Like you know me well enough to assume anything about what I’m doing. I put that fucking add out because I wanted money for something I won’t even explain to you because you clearly already made up your mind about everything. I put it out because
Malfoy very visibly tried not to smile. “Whatever,” he muttered. He took off his scarf and coat, and left the room walking with an air of superiority. “You’d better not poison me with that tea, or I’m going to...” He rambled on, his voice echoing between the corridor walls.
Ignoring the pain that soared through his chest, Draco left for Diagon Alley first thing in the morning. It was Friday, and the kids would return from Hogwarts on Saturday, which meant they had one day to buy enough food, presents and logs of wood to keep everyone fed, happy and warm through the entirety of the holidays.
He looked around them. The shop seemed to be empty, but he wasn’t willing to take any risks. “Could we go to the back room, please?”
Tucked inside the cloth was a beautiful silver bracelet. It seemed old, and its magic print was so strong Harry could almost feel it reaching out towards him. It was expensive—perhaps even more so than Astoria’s necklace.
He changed into dark blue slacks and a white shirt, and chose a lilac lipstick to complete his look, matching it with the scarf he draped around his neck.
“No.” Draco’s reply was sharp and allowed no counter argument. “Our busiest time is Christmas because a lot of people come here to celebrate the holidays when they have nowhere else to go. We can’t skim on the one moment of the year when our guests can be themselves.”
“A mental hospital? Really?” Pansy crossed her arms, looking very unimpressed by his temper tantrum. “That seems a bit hypocritical coming from the man who used to be so obsessed with him it went far beyond what muggles call stalking.”
Ron looked over, “He what—he can't be. Those things are like ... sacred. No pureblood would sell their ring. Especially not a Malfoy.”
“Yeah, it’s a giant mess, isn’t it? Blaise is still sorting out the details but as far as I can see anyone who hands out our information leaflets after the seventeenth will get fined at best and might even face jail time. And we’re already low on funds as it is.”
“Male!” The twins crowed when Harry’s face started to itch and apparently grew an impressive moustache. Another second later and he had his mouth back, just in time to give Fred and George a piece of his mind.
He knew what Pansy and Astoria would say. That he needed to meet Potter and listen to what he had to say. With the first part he agreed; he was going to do as the git had said,
“I did actually. Me and my female presenting nipples had a great night.” Draco chuckled into Astoria’s neck but then grew serious. “My morning though… Not so great.”
In the end, with Hermione’s help, he came up with a much less pathetic greeting. He read it over and over again before giving it to Kreacher, just to make sure there wasn’t a single word in there that could give away his dirty secret.
Draco snickered, letting his head hang down as he leaned on the kitchen counter. “If there is any deity out there watching me, I’m sure they’ll send me to heaven for this, actually.”
Harry sighed to himself. The ‘prat’ really wasn’t a prat anymore, was he? He’d turned out to be a pretty… hell, a
“Yeah it is.” Harry had to use all his strength to stop his voice from shaking. Wording what happened in his past like that was never easy, no matter how much time had passed. “That’s not what I came to talk about here though. I mean, it’s one of the reasons why I’m interested in what you’re doing, but this meeting isn’t about me, or you actually. It’s about money and homeless people as far as I understand.”
Harry followed her back through to the kitchen. “Thanks,” he replied, glad for the change in subject. “D'you want some swirls while we fill them in?”
Potter for growing up to be fit, even if he still was a stumbling idiot. “Not unless he has more money than I know about. This ring has been in my family for over a millennium. Word will be out soon enough, and we’ll get a much higher price. This kind of magic doesn’t come on the market all the often.”
Diagon Alley was filled with Christmas lights and decorations of all sizes and colours. The cheerful voices of excited children were accompanied by a choir of old people who always spent the morning of Christmas day singing carols under the awning of Flourish and Blotts, and the music, as well as the scent of recently baked gingerbread, followed him as he walked down the street.
Not that he’d expected much of anything at the time. His life had been so… empty, back then. Dating Ginny, joining the Aurors—it had all felt like too much, too fast.
Hi! Marina here! These three parts were written by Jeldenil, Quicksilvermaid and me (not necessarily in that order!) Can you guess who wrote which part? ;)
Excited, he pushed his way back home, eager to tell Ron and Hermione what he’d found out. They’d be happy, right?
. And oh, how he hated her for putting such a—a ridiculous idea into his mind. He hated Potter, too, for not leaving him alone already.
was in the wrong. Was this how quickly Potter had fucked up the foundations of his entire haven? Now his own friends were keeping secrets from him.
“Because selling your engagement ring means ending your bloodline for good, yeah we know. But that’s not the reason you don’t want to sell it to Potter.” Pansy had clearly recovered and was now studying his face. “You don’t want to sell it to him because you can’t bear to see it in his hands without you giving it to him. You don’t want him to have it when it doesn’t come with an engagement to you.”
“Well then, fine,” he said aloud to only himself as if there’d been a conversation taking place. “If Pansy won’t tell me what they’re up to, I’ll have to find out myself.” He stood up, energised by his decision, and turned to see a wary gaze staring up at him. A jolt of panic shot through his chest at the surprise, and he had to smooth out his shirt just to recollect his composure.
At Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes at least business seemed to be booming as usual. The red-headed twins were zooming around in their shop, appraising their Christmas Classics, like the brawling balls—red and green baubles that shouted creative (but still ‘family friendly’) insults from the Christmas tree, singing string lights, and indoor snowballs. Another classic and usually a big hit. The naughty nativity—which displayed Mary, Joseph and the tree Muggle kings in rather… compromising positions, was now nowhere to be seen.
“Thank you,” Luna replied absent-mindedly, pouring herself some tea as she worked on a detailed sketch of erumpent anatomy. Her desk was covered in papers—she really wasn’t the best with organising, but she knew where everything was, and that’s what mattered. She would meet with Dean later so he could help her edit—it  truly was quite wonderful to have friends.
Nursing a coffee, he looked over the newspaper on the table in front of him. Merlin, Christmas was merely days away. He idly wondered how things were going for Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins with the safehouse.
, I need to think of more than just myself, my happiness is irrelevant, there are more important things at stake.” She feigned a yawn. “And let me tell you, as your best friend, that you are being stupid.”
Harry gaped for a moment. Astoria and Pansy were together, then? He’d kind of assumed she and Draco… but that was stupid, he now realised. “Won’t that make
As soon as the miserable house elf was gone, Harry shrugged off his jacket and unlinked the cuffs of his shirt. The familiar gut-twisting tension he associated with Malfoy was making itself apparent as doubt settled in.
“Not that it’s any of your business, but Draco is very busy getting the house ready,” Astoria replied defensively. “Do you want to buy it or not?”
Pansy wasn’t dense, she could tell something was up—something Astoria didn’t want to tell her. Usually, she would demand to know what was going on, but then Astoria didn’t often keep secrets—there must be a reason.
When she didn’t say anything, but rather inspected Teddy’s old drawings on the walls, Harry felt the need to break the silence. “Do you want a brownie?”
The more he told himself to leave it be, hidden away under his mattress, the more he wanted to flick back through it. Well, the more his cock wanted to, in any case. But he wouldn’t. No, he was better than that, and he didn’t need to fuck his hand just because Malfoy, of all people, could pull off lingerie.
Harry looked between the both of them in confusion as he stepped back, giving Astoria space to enter first. Ron sent him a sheepish smile as he followed behind.
“Luna…” Seamus’ lip trembled slightly and she immediately wrapped her arms around him. “What can we do?!”
Draco was not going to force her to speak despite the action plans in place. Pansy preferred to engage through doing, making whimsical crafts or cooking until bonds formed, and Draco had always envied the effortless way Astoria seemed to warm newcomers into conversation. But that wasn’t him. He preferred to offer space, time and no expectations. Not everybody that came to the house was looking for a shoulder to cry on, some just needed somewhere warm and dry to heal.
“See, why Astoria decided to sell you her own heirloom instead of Draco’s is beyond me.” Parkinson deposited the bracelet on the table, then looked him in the eye. “But it’s making her miserable, and I don’t want that for my wife. So I’m selling you mine.”
It wasn’t even 8 pm yet, and Harry had washed the kitchen countertops down, done three loads of washing, ironed the living room curtains, and baked some cinnamon swirls with orange zest toppings. He felt taxed, given he hadn’t stopped for a single beat until the cinnamon swirls were in the oven—and then he’d had to pace all the while because the dishes had been done and put away, the radiators had been bled, and there wasn’t a spot of dust anywhere for him to clean.
Diagon Alley was flooded with the usual pre-Christmas shoppers, and everywhere around him Harry could hear people discuss the latest Ministry decree like it was hot gossip. In fact, he couldn’t recall the public being this interested in policies since the war. It was a bit disturbing, really. He pushed his way through the masses with some difficulty, trying to ignore the continuous pleas for their Saviour to
“He’s tired, Pans,” Astoria said sadly, “you know he feels responsible for every person who walks through these doors.” Pansy sighed loudly and scratched her cheek, her eyes hardening as she got caught up in her thoughts. “I have to go, Potter is waiting for me,” she lied.
She sounded so upset, Draco had to stand up to stop her from rummaging through the drawers in search for the right piece of fabric. “You haven’t,” he reassured her. “Tiresias goes by all pronouns, even if they prefer the neutral ones.”
“Oh, you know, here and there—but that's not important. How are the kids? Let me guess—you’re here to buy them some last-minute Christmas presents, yes?”
“I don't think I have a—for Merlin’s sake, I'm only trying to be friends with you! Like normal people do! Jeez, you're exhausting.”
Hermione reached across for the paper, glancing at the article. “That's the new restrictions the Ministry have put in place. You remember I was telling you? They're calling it The Purge.”
“You don’t have to do this, Draco,” she said quietly, not wanting to stir up an argument the way Pansy’s accusing tone sometimes did. “We’ll find another way.” Draco shook his head and sighed, his eyes fixated on the ring box.
“Sorry I’m late—something happened along the way and I couldn't make it. I'll order some chocolate, and—”
He doubted Grimmauld had ever looked so pristine, and it was all thanks to that stupid bloody magazine.
“Damn, erm… tell him to stop by at mine later today. I’m sure Hermione and I will be able to think of some commissions he can do for us at least. And try Fred and George, too. In fact, I need to pass their shop anyway. Walk along with me.”
“Behold—the nipple-toe!” Fred grinned, pointing upwards to indicate a green-and-pink decoration that probably once looked like a leaf and berry. It now looked like a stabby green tit, there was no other way to describe it. Harry made a muffled sound and touched his face, feeling what much resembled a nipple where his mouth once was.
“Okay, don’t worry, you don’t have to go. We can take care of it.” Hermione looked up at Harry, her eyes big with concern. “Well, actually… can you take care of it, Harry?”
Knockturn Alley was the same as every other day of the year, except for the fact that the smell of dampness and piss blended with that of smoke from the chimneys of the buildings. Harry idly wondered what they were all cooking as he approached the Slytherin safehouse—perhaps a twisted, poisonous version of gingerbread men?
“So,” Tiresias cut in, unaware of his inner struggle. “Queen or Led Zeppelin? Or perhaps...”—she dramatically raised one of the records for him to see—“
Draco arrived back at his house in a deflated mood, thoroughly exhausted. How could Potter still take everything out of him?
This chapter was written by Donnarafiki, Quicksilvermaid and Smittenwithdaydreams (again, not necessarily in that order! Kudos to you if you can guess who wrote what ^-^)
Malfoy left a trail of snow as he stormed into the living, and Harry followed him, amused. Perhaps he should've felt annoyed, or mad, or hell,
“He’s selling the ring then?” Pansy asked. She shrugged out of her jacket, swapping the milk between hands as she did. “He’s a bloody idiot sometimes.”
Ron shook his head. “You’re thinking way too hard, mate. You too, ‘Mione. There’s a much simpler solution to all of this.”
Apart from the pain that still took over his arm every so often, the accident at the Aurors really had changed his life for the better. It had forced him to quit his job, and thus he’d decided to fund the
“Hmmm.” Draco shook his head in confusion. Astoria going to see Daphne was suspicious. The two of them hardly spoke nowadays. Daphne got herself a nice conventional marriage to a dull Danish Pureblood named Jon Jensen—and although they hadn’t had a fall-out or anything like it, their lives were just too different. Something must be very important for her to go for a visit. He’d have to ask her about it once she got home.
“Graffiti! Luna, someone’s been spreading erotic graffiti in awkward places. The Hogwarts Express, the Minister’s  reception room, St Mungo’s Emergency department. And they think it must be Dean!”
“I’m afraid it’s not, Harry, it’s a Pureblood thing. Magical contract. You know magical contracts.” Hermione tried to sound patient, he could tell.
He’d been thinking about him lately, and he was fairly sure it had to do with the fact that he’d seen the git three times that week; twice in his favourite café in Diagon Alley, once in Gringotts, while he collected the papers that would allow him to sell the ring that had once belonged to his father.
Harry hadn't been expecting that. Some bantering, sure—getting to know each other, hopefully. But this was just… wow. For a moment he was dumbfounded.
Harry paused as Malfoy stormed into the hallway, his earlier decisiveness deserting him. Now that he was face to face with Malfoy, his reasons for coming seemed ridiculous.
My username (OTPshipper98) appears as a chapter co-creator because I'm the one posting the chapter, but I didn't write any of these parts.
Astoria closed her eyes briefly, her back straight and her face neutral despite the pain she felt inside upon selling her ancestral pendant.
, can.” Stepping back, she allowed Potter inside, closing the door behind him while he took in the decor with suspicious curiosity. “What brings you by?” Astoria tried to ask it in a breezy manner, hoping he might actually explain his presence. Potter, however, wasn’t listening to her now that he was within clear earshot of the kitchen drama.
“I was just thinking... maybe we could send one to Malfoy, too. Th-the Slytherin safehouse, I mean.”
“Okay.” Harry was starting to doubt he'd be able to help Malfoy's cause without going mad. “Sorry. I won't call them that again. As I was saying, I'm only trying to get to know you. You want answers, don't you? Well, that's the deal I'm willing to make.”
He was about to return to the kitchen to offer Theo some help cooking dinner when the front door opened and Pansy entered with Tiresias in tow. Before he could even start to ask where the hell she’d been, Tiresias was already taking over the conversation, chatting endlessly about their day and the people they’d seen—causing Pansy to roll her eyes and Draco to nod and smile encouragingly.
“Seamus, give him a kiss—so his nipple can tell us whether it’s male or female presenting,” George instructed, pushing a red-faced, madly giggling Seamus towards Harry. Harry rolled his eyes—it was all he could do—and endured a quick peck from his friend.
' Harry snorted and skimmed through it, his disbelief growing as he read. He waved at Ron and Hermione to get their attention.
She watched Potter’s eyes widen and could see his throat working as he attempted to suppress a cough, or a protest—really, he wasn’t being subtle. But to his credit, he only nodded while Weasley got red and spluttered audibly.
He straightened his clothes and brushed his hair with his fingers, practically running towards the door. He pulled it open with a nervous smile, and—
It did, though, but Draco never told his parents about it. It’d been right at the end of his first year, and he’d been calmly working on a Potions essay when he suddenly and inexplicably felt cold all over his body, like he’d been dipped in ice.
He couldn’t remember the first time it happened. He’d been too young. Later, his Mother told him he’d woken her up with his cries.
Seamus was fuming, and Luna quietly feared that he’d set her plums on fire. It was a relief to get him inside. Her house was explosion-free ever since the war.
He always felt a little bit overwhelmed by how talkative Tiresias was—but he also kind of loved it. After all, she was the best friend Teddy could have asked for.
And he most definitely shouldn’t fantasize about proving to Potter that he had become a better person.
The ambience of Madame Malkin's always brought Draco childhood memories, even though he was still a regular customer. It was warm, organised, smart—just like Madam Malkin herself.
at him. “He’ll come down any minute now. He’s been getting very little sleep lately, so I turned off his alarm last night. He’s going to be pissed, so I’m really glad you’re here to suffer his rage instead of me.” And with that and a snicker, he was gone.
Malfoy seemed to be stunned by his presence, a faint flush tinging his cheeks. But he recovered quickly.
Now it was Harry’s turn to gape at the other man in surprise, even long after he’d disappeared onto the streets. Because if what he’d said was true, and Harry didn’t doubt that for a second, then he really
But it wasn’t snowing, and anyone who walked out of the house would see his footsteps imprinted on the settled snow.
“Don’t give me that crap, Astoria,” Pansy frowned, her well-groomed eyebrows knitting together. “What did you do?”
Harry picked up the paper. “I wonder what he's up to,” he muttered, his full focus turning to the image in front of him.
“No, Potter, you really don't,” said Malfoy. “You have no idea what it means to be seen as a monster—to think yourself a monster—and to leave all that behind and actually better yourself. To dedicate your life to redeeming your past mistakes so you can look in the mirror and feel proud of the person you've become—someone who helps those who are vulnerable. Those who've been rejected, and who would find themselves alone like you once did if it weren't for you—only to be mocked by some stupid Ministry jerk who has decided advertising your safehouse should be illegal. Along with your damn female-presenting nipples, of all things. You wanted to know who I am, Potter? Well, that is who I am. A gender non-conforming idiot whose efforts to become a better person have been outlawed.” He breathed deeply, and then, almost as an afterthought, he muttered, “And that is why I had to sell my ring.”
He changed into his pyjamas, heated some soup from the fridge and sat down to finish his day with a warm stomach too.
Knowing he needed to eat, Harry hung his jacket up in the hall on route to the kitchen, only stopping to take the letter from Seamus out of his pocket. Dean had managed to get some commissions from Fred and George, so he would stop by Grimmauld tomorrow evening instead which boded well for Harry as the only thing he could think about was Malfoy and whatever he was up to.
It was all crazy stupid and it would be funny if it didn’t also mean that Draco’s safe house advertisements and folders were now officially illegal. He’d set up his home as a place of refuge for anyone who wanted to live by their own rules but couldn’t due to the people around them. It was something that might have saved him from being such a dumb arse back in the day.
“Draco has reconsidered selling you his family ring,” Astoria said, interrupting. She placed her slender fingers around the mug, enjoying the heat. “I’m here to make you a different offer.” Harry’s brows conjoined in his confusion. “It’s no secret that we need money to support our friends this Christmas, and if you were anybody else we would have no doubt appealed to you for a donation. As it is, Draco would sooner—well, sell his only chance to marry—before asking for your help.”
“Take this to the corner of Knockturn Alley. It’s for Draco Malfoy,” Harry explained, holding the envelope out to be taken. Kreacher grumbled something about owl’s work as he hobbled over to snatch the note-come-letter out of Harry’s hand.
“That's what I would have thought up until a few hours ago, too,” said Harry. “But… he is selling his wedding ring to help other people, after all.”
“Yes to all of that, but no, Harry shouldn’t offer to buy the ring. He should ask Malfoy what brought him to sell the ring. Surely something must have happened if they were managing their business fine up to this point, right? Perhaps there’s some other way Harry can invest the money to help Malfoy keep the safehouse going without having to sell his ring.”
“It will be the best material, of course! Merlin, I’m so glad I decided to expand my market section from just robes to all kinds of tailored—oh, but I’ve just realised—I’ve been misgendering this poor kid all along, haven’t I?”
They took their seats on the kitchen table. They ate silently, and Harry finished his soup while she helped herself to another brownie. He fidgeted, then cleared his throat. “So… what brings you here?”
Hauling himself out of bed, he gripped his shaking limb to his chest and made his way downstairs to the kitchen.
“Please Ron, do explain. It’s not like you two have been constantly bugging me to make a decision. I did. And now you’re telling me I can’t?”
Harry halted, frowning. He hadn’t really thought of that yet. Dean was making a living with his art, and most of it wasn’t exactly family friendly. In fact, the majority of his customers wanted nude and explicit artworks for their private chambers. It was his speciality.
“Technically, he wouldn’t be allowed to advertise it if he sold his body,” Astoria cut in. “His nipples are female presenting, after all.”
Draco was a grown-up man now, though. He was well past all his teenage pettiness, which meant he shouldn’t feel the need to act like some sort of evil idiot every time he came across Potter; shouldn’t feel like he was committing a crime just for breathing.
No art about people because that could be insulting even if they were actually politically motivated cartoons. No unsolicited interviews which meant publishing the answer to a simple question now required three hours worth of paperwork. No shocking content lest the younger audience wouldn’t be able to stomach it and for some reason no
“Slughorn?” To her credit, she sounded just slightly surprised at the familiar name. “I do, yes. She’s a lovely girl, very quiet and studious. And she was here just last September—she’d outgrown her Hogwarts robes, so I had to take her measurements again. What did you want to buy for her?”
Right. Harry stood outside the Slytherin safehouse, or what he’d always presumed to be some kind of sleazy hang-out for his snakey schoolmates. It wasn’t. Apparently. But what was it then? He looked at it, confused. It looked really unassuming, grey and narrow and outwardly reminding him a bit of Grimmauld Place, but more modern. Inside it had seemed warmer, busy and bright with more people living there than he’d have thought likely. But… poor. It was well-kept, but he’d seen the way the walls had needed paint, the rugs were worn beyond what magic could fix, and the inhabitants all looked tired and in need of a good meal or two.
When his gaze met Harry's, he was surprised to find a spark of hurt on Malfoy's eyes. Shite. He regretted asking.
“Harry! Have you heard?” A breathless Seamus Finnigan called from the Leaky Cauldron’s doorstep. “Dean’s going to go out of business—how are we supposed to live from my job alone?”
He laughed out loud. “Have you ever read a bigger load of shit in your life?”  He kept reading down it, “What is this? It's talking about restricting free speech ... art ... female presenting nipples? What
