Harry winced when Hermione tried to get Winky to see that freedom was a good thing, and it went over about as well as he expected. He was, however, surprised to hear that Mr Crouch apparently bad-mouthed Mr Bagman enough at home for Winky to classify him as a bad wizard. He also felt a sinking feeling of dread at Dobby's proclamation of the Malfoys being
"Oi, did you think I was lying again?!"
She looked thoughtful and considerate a moment. He watched her swallow, blinking rapidly with her own thoughts. " I think," she started carefully, "that it's normal to think about…" she paused, her cheeks going pink, "to think about
"Mr Potter—a word, if you please," Professor McGonagall said over them.
Malfoy did indeed supply Harry with enough material that Harry didn't doubt it would last him probably through sixth year.
Harry smirked under the Cloak.
Luna Lovegood was a third year in Ravenclaw, and within a single minute of meeting her, Harry had to rearrange his definition of weird.
There's someone coming!"
"Are they?" Ron asked, sounding horrified.
"Professor Hagrid brought me immediately to the school's medical wing, and my father ensured that a thorough investigation happened."
He was a fool, probably, but he went to sleep deciding maybe he was ready to talk to someone. Not about Malfoy, but he could talk about himself.
Harry sighed, still not looking up. "Yes, Professor." He moved toward the door, but Professor McGonagall stopped him.
________
What was worse was that Malfoy took his challenge calmly, evenly, and even as he enjoyed it. The look in his eye made Harry's blood thrum.
It was on the edge of the forest, and a tent had been erected just in front of a large cluster of trees that Harry figured was hiding the dragons. The three schools' insignias were colourful and bold on the tent with its entrance flap right underneath. Professor McGonagall stopped him before they reached it, one hand still on his shoulder.
"What the bloody hell is that supposed to mean?"
Malfoy snorted once then actually barked a quick, albeit quiet, laugh. It reminded Harry a little of Sirius, if not much softer and more dignified. "Did he get sick with slugs?"
Unfortunately, that particular night, the Gryffindors had Astronomy, and the only way to convey this to Malfoy was the groan loudly about it in the library, earning a sharp hushing order from Madam Pince. It worked, though. An hour later when he returned to his seat after putting away a few books, there was another note that simply said:
"I do as well. Their earlier music is much faster and louder. You know, the Weird Sisters first formed when they were students here. My father said Dumbledore allowed them to perform concerts on the Quidditch training grounds."
Sirius hesitated. "I've been hearing some very strange things… The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn't they? Someone set off the Dark Mark… and then—did you hear about the Ministry of Magic witch who's gone missing?"
"Yeh did it, Harry!" Hagrid boomed over her. Harry felt immediate gratitude and smothering guilt because he had had
Chamber, Potter, use your head. Do you honestly think Salazar would have made this without an exit?"
. He missed Ron and was sick of being without him. But he was also scared.
It wasn't until after he was spent that he even registered that his traitorous body found that idea better than any fantasy Harry had had to date. He was
. This isn't like last year—and yes, yes, I will admit I was faking most of it if that will get you to listen to me now. Please. Something is wrong with me—this isn't normal. You have to fix me!"
"Yes, I can. But only you. I'm not cornering myself in Salazar's secret lair with a bunch of Slytherins."
"Hermione!" Harry yelled.
Neville did the same to Ginny, and they made their way to the entrance hall.
"Of course," Malfoy rolled his eyes as if it was obvious.
Harry perked up. "Hermione, would you—"
Because Malfoy's hair wasn't sleeked back. It was still styled, but now it looked amazingly soft. It was parted at one side, his locks curling into a small wave where it sat by his ear. He looked like he had more hair on top, as though the sides were a closer cut. It was terrible, it really was, because Harry could immediately picture how easily a strand could fall into Malfoy's eyes, making him look far softer and easier than the boy—man, there didn't seem to be a spec of boy left in his face— his face which had those grey eyes, arched eyebrows, high cheekbones… and, as Harry's vision took in the picture as a whole, a very angry-looking scowl on it.
The tournament could take its best shot.
The next day, Harry and Hermione ate breakfast while walking around the lake, and Harry filled her in with everything Sirius told him. Hermione was as concerned as he was about Karkaroff, but she agreed with him that their main focus should be the dragons Tuesday.
Probably. He had to figure out what it was first though.
when he thought Harry could have any girl he wanted. He couldn't imagine if Harry actually had decided to take the plunge and ask a bloke— if the bloke said yes. He would like to imagine he would have informed any relevant parties about it beforehand, but at the same time, what if he did want to keep it private until the ball? He would feel humiliation and shame coarse through him every time Ron badgered him about it. How nervous he would feel about Ron finding out when Ron showed that much interest from the get-go?
Malfoy gave him a small, shy-looking smile. "On some things. I'm afraid I'm grossly behind on technology."
Harry firmly turned his back on her and offered his arm to Luna.
"More like God save us from cheaters!" Harry whispered-called after him. He watched Malfoy leave the library and frowned back down to his books. "'Save us from cheaters'? That's the best I had?"
Not for the first time since his and Malfoy's last trip to the Chamber, Harry wondered about the relationship between him and the professor. Harry watched as Malfoy was asked a follow-up question, something he often did for Slytherins when they had forgotten or left out part of the answer. Harry never had Potions with any of the other houses, but he assumed it was a favoured chance he didn't grant anyone else.
Harry was laughing at Luna's running commentary on Professor Flitwick's dancing when Hermione joined them, looking near to tears.
leave him alone. The only problem with that was Harry wasn't sure if he wanted to be left alone.
Honestly, if it was left to just Harry, Harry probably would have been down there for days, if not more, but Malfoy not only apparently had a knack for puzzles, he also seemed to be enjoying himself in the mystery. Whereas Harry dragged his feet and seriously considered just napping at a couple of points, Malfoy flittered all around the Chamber, demanding Harry to do any manual labour and having him hiss in Parseltongue at whatever he thought might do something.
"Er… okay?"
"As you can see, Professor Hagrid still has his job as he did nothing wrong. But I'm afraid the entire incident and my family's subsequent actions have made new magical creatures added the curriculum to be under
"But of course," he answered, shrugging a shoulder as though it was the most logical thing in the world. "I wouldn't abandon the course, even with my history."
His heart was beating wildly as he made his way to this first lesson. A large part of himself was just internally staring blankly at the other parts himself, asking what in the world he thought he was doing. Another part of him was thrilled. His skin felt like it was thrumming, and his stomach was doing flips. And yet another part of him tried to complain about having emotional whip-lash, but honestly, the prospect of secretly meeting Malfoy that night made everything else seem… less miserable.
So, he told the truth and just began to talk. He told Sirius about the
"You could have any girl at this school, you moron. You're Harry bloody Potter, and a champion to boot. But you choose to bring…" his eyes flicked back to Luna for a moment before he appeared to change direction. "To bring a friend."
"He's probably doing it on purpose," Ron grumbled to Harry as Harry tapped out the number of stirs they needed. "He won't think it's a successful lesson unless someone
_______
It was exactly the same, and Harry was relieved Moaning Myrtle didn't seem to be around. He strolled up to the sink, lighting his wand to find the right faucet. He heard when Malfoy entered.
They were quiet the rest of the way to what Harry considered the second entrance. Malfoy finally lit his own wand to examine the snake and ruby eyes. Harry stood back and let him study it until Malfoy was satisfied then hissed to open it.
almost put Harry to sleep.
focusing on how miserable he was, Blaise had fixed whatever they had done wrong. Now the clear liquid was thick, almost like slime.
Stupid Potter. Stupid Potter, with his stupid face, and stupid glasses, and stupid scar, and stupid hair, and stupid eyes, and stupid skin, and stupid arse, and stupid fitted robes, with his stupid morals, stupid voice, stupid stubbornness, stupid talent, stupid...
He felt awkward next. He wrung his hands a little, looking anywhere but Malfoy. He felt like some neutral ground has been building between them, however tentative, and now he had just dropped a bomb on it. It was odd—he used to always associate Snape and Malfoy with the same degree of animosity, but with Malfoy creeping into his thoughts and dreams, the scales outweighed each other. Harry, against his better judgment, was giving Malfoy a chance, he supposed. It was mostly selfish, wanting to prove himself to Malfoy and wanting to figure out why it was him to have caught Harry's attention.
"Do you have
Hermione winced. "I know, Harry."
"Skeeter was only there to get more information on Harry, to publish something else. I doubt she would have published anything about Hagrid or those monsters, to begin with, but Malfoy just ensured she won't go near it. Not only does his name and—" Hermione's eye twitched "—blood status give him a lot of weight, but the implications that the school's governors
Harry tried not to show his confusion and began to lead Luna away. He was acutely aware of Malfoy watching them, slack-jawed. "I guess we'll find out. Maybe it depends where they got the water or how they froze it?"
Harry shrugged. "We probably could call Fawkes back down here some way."
Yeah, Luna was a different breed of weird, but Harry found he liked it.
"I… But, but you're the only one who even
"You.. you do?" Ginny asked, sounding shocked.
Harry sighed. He didn't have the energy right then to bicker with Malfoy. All the information he learned since seeing the boy last flickered through his mind, and he searched Malfoy's face a moment. Malfoy's father used to be a Death Eater too… He could know something. In fact, if what Harry thought (and desperately hoped) was true that Malfoy didn't know about his father's involvement with the Chamber of Secrets, then it could be possible that Malfoy wouldn't know just how valuable whatever information he had was and wouldn't think twice about sharing it.
"Please, she melts when you so much as look at her."
Malfoy gave him a sharp look. "That's a bad idea on so many levels, Potter, the least of which is by doing so we would be alerting
"More or less."
This dance Luna led him through involved a lot of slow-motion twirls done on the tips of their toes. Harry tripped many times, but Luna insisted it improved the dance and began 'tripping' as well. The next dance didn't involve any touching or rotation, just more or less them facing each other and hopping from foot to foot. Luna suggested the best way to perform it was to pretend his feet were on fire. Harry had to admit, imagining that did help him hop more quickly.
Because a very cool, clipped voice broke through whatever bubble they had weaved around them.
"Are you saying that Karkaroff is trying to kill me? Why?"
Malfoy seemed surprised but nonetheless pleased. "Excellent, Potter." He smirked. "And see, now you have more reason to survive the task because if you die before I can finish this beast, make no mistake… I will make your afterlife hell."
It seemed to be. Malfoy sat straighter at having gotten the question correct, but Snape didn't add that last question to the board like he did all the others. Harry chewed his lip, squinting at Malfoy and wishing he could read his mind so that there wouldn't be anything Malfoy-related that he was ignorant about.
Snape waved his wand to the board, the name
"Obviously," Malfoy sneered.
Eventually, he allowed his head to fall back against the castle wall, shoving his glasses back on.
"You won't have a phoenix this time, Potter. Or an heirloom sword."
Ginny elbowed him hard in the ribs. "Not literally, Luna."
He thought of Malfoy.
She was unhappy Harry made them stop by the dorms to put away their things, but Harry didn't want to give himself a chance to get distracted. He also brought his map, hoping to keep an eye out to make sure they weren't overheard. He spotted Rita Skeeter along the lake and was very grateful they were going to the bridge.
He had just snuck toward the tent's flap to peek outside when two figures rushed in: Hermione and Ron.
Draco nodded. "Yes, yes it does. I'm telling you, this isn't normal. I'm thirsty
Madam Pomfrey's hands were on her hips immediately. "You can and you will if you want me to fix your problem."
"So," Vinny hedged, "for this theory… it's only living objects that can be transfigured."
"We can sit down if you like," Luna said, correctly reading his mind. "Or I can show the other dance if you want."
The skrewts not only did not hibernate but were apparently insulted by the notion. Most of the class almost immediately fled to Hagrid's hut, leaving only a handful to help restrain the angry doofers, Harry, Ron, and Hermione included. Before they captured the last one, a familiar but wholly unwelcomed voice interrupted.
"Well, well, well… this
"I can see that. But…?"
Malfoy snorted that time. "In your dreams."
For the world, he should be seething that Malfoy had such a ready stockpile of death scenarios at the ready, but Harry could tell quite a few of them were made up on the spot. And it felt so good to laugh, however much he kept trying to reel it in.
Predictably, Hermione's hand shot up, and just as predictably, Snape ignored her.
"Find out how they feel about those with different preferences and start from there, Mr Potter." She sighed again. "I gather from this that I should not be expecting to have a meeting with the staff to ensure tolerance at the ball?"
The silence that followed was deafening enough to catch his attention again. He looked around. Luna looked back pleasantly as if nothing strange just happened. Krum was frowning and watching all of them. Hermione and Parkinson were looking at him with their mouths open. And Malfoy looked like Harry had just smacked him.
and waste away—"
Harry shook his head again. "I— I don't…
Sirius, who, despite looking better, still had eyes that reflected the hauntings of Azkaban, was looking at him with understanding and concern. He had let Harry talk himself out, but now he said, "Dragons we can deal with, Harry, but we'll get to that in a minute—I haven't got long here… I've broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time. There are things I need to warn you about."
Ginny nodded. "I'll ask."
"Mr Malfoy…" Snape reverted dangerously. "I believe your
, at least
Harry blinked, his stomach falling all over again. They weren't just talking about him, they were originally discussing whether or not Harry would… that Harry apparently
Luna smiled brightly. "It would be exciting to go to the ball as well. I was disappointed I wouldn't be allowed to go, especially since I won't be going home. My father is in Africa, recording the eating habits of Glistering Waterbats."
And of course, it was bloody, fucking, sodding
"I don't know," Harry teased, "McGonagall would probably kill me if I mess this up."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Oh, of course, you'd take the only witch panting after you."
Please no one be upset about Malfoy's pure joy at imagining ways Harry could die. In this, I'm creating Malfoy with a really morbid sense of humour, and Harry has it too. It's very similar to my own, which not everyone gets, I know. I think Malfoy likes to think his joy is purely from the torment of the enemy, but in reality, he just finds it utterly hilarious that there would be a class where the only way to get good marks is to predict the worst. It's def something that's funny in the books and that canon Harry and Ron can find enjoyment in.
it. Then when he left his dorms, he came to another realisation: that he didn't have to worry about dying in the tournament. No, he was going to die from pure and utter humiliation if more blows didn't stop coming.
"... Wait, are you actually wanting to harvest the thing?"
Throughout the meal, there wasn't a single conversation that Luna was shy about adding her two knuts. Hermione and Krum largely went unbothered, deep in their own conversation, Fleur didn't deem Luna worthy of a reply, and Davies was too busy watching Fleur. But everyone else had at least one round with Luna. Ludo Bagman seemed puzzled but determined to entertain her with looks to Harry that suggested it was for Harry's sake. Karkaroff didn't seem to know what to think of her, and Harry quickly steered Luna way from him. Madam Maxime seemed to find Luna amusing, and Dumbledore seemed practised at humouring her. Percy, on the other hand, took her very seriously and was apparently unable to resist trying to correct her.
"... What?" he repeated.
But. That was the thing. Either he would become properly distracted and give up, or he would push past it, determined to finish, and that was when… others entered, he guessed.
Harry sighed but got up and went over to Malfoy's work-chest-station. "What size?"
frown. It was a mildly confused frown that Harry found so adorable, he wanted to reach out and…
Malfoy didn't say a word as they made the trek into the Chamber of Secrets. He stopped Harry before he opened the second entrance to perform that invisible bubble charm again, and Malfoy took his sweet time unloading his bag, organising the things, and picking out a few books he wanted to take with him. Harry knew he was probably doing it on purpose, and it wasn't until Harry snapped that he
"Oh, absolutely," Luna nodded. She then began to ponder on how long water kept its memory and if any of the water could have come from another country and rained where it was then collected. Harry listened, trying his damnest to follow along, and waited until they were up the staircase to send Ron and Hermione a baffled look. They were trailing behind, looking equally baffled.
"They also said you and Malfoy make a good couple."
Pansy had seemed like a safe option, before. He wasn't going to take anyone to the Ball, especially after he heard Potter hadn't gotten a date. He figured if Potter was good enough to go stag, so was Draco. Then at the last minute, he heard Potter had asked that Indian twin, so it was more or less a last-minute decision on Draco's part.
He could do a test, he decided, much like the disaster with Madam Pomfrey's potion was, in a way. He was clearly dehydrated, but a hydrating potion made him sick. He noted that down as a symptom, too, and decided that the following weekend, he would ask Professor Snape for some Pepper-Up instead. See what effect that had.
"I'm not delusional! And I'm not a liar! I don't know how to prove to you what happened last year and first year, but I can prove that the basilisk thing did happen."
Harry threw out his hands in a frustrated gesture but didn't answer. He was very aware of Krum watching them now, and while he didn't think Luna would exactly put it all together or realise this wasn't just an extension of the small talk they've been having all night so far, he didn't know about Krum. There was little he could do about how disastrously obvious he had been, but he could defend himself to Malfoy that he just didn't want a fight to break out so he blurted something that would shut them up. But Krum?
Harry, still grinning, looked back at the snake. He imagined it being real, took a breath, then said, "
They were now about six feet long, still grey, and with suckers, stings, and fire-blasting tendencies, that it was no wonder there were only ten left. In fact, Harry thought perhaps it was fortunate that only the skrewts were dying and not anything else. He was outright morose as Hagrid presented boxes lined with pillows and blankets. Hagrid had provided each skrewt with more comfort than Harry ever had at the Dursleys altogether, much less the cupboard.
"A broomstick," Malfoy repeated, looking solely at Harry with his lips quirking. His pale face was guarded, but Harry didn't miss how stiff his shoulders were, as though forcing them still. "The Great Boy Who Lived went up against a dragon with a broomstick."
. BUT
"I would love to."
Krum shook his hand, but he was giving Harry a sharp, calculating look.
Which, that proposed another problem… getting Madam Pomfrey to believe him.
Malfoy snorted. "Naturally."
Malfoy slammed the Charms book shut, turning sharply toward the basilisk, jabbed his wand toward it and barked, "
" Malfoy read the cover. He looked back up at Harry, face hidden in shadow with his head still down. "Earlier you were reading about the anatomy of dragons and had a book on Chinese dragon culture."
Harry felt eyes on him, and he looked over to see Malfoy had turned back as well but was peeking over his shoulder at him, watching. Harry tried to give him a slow nod. After all, Harry just did that for the bastard—and he bloody better well know it.
The conversation with Professor McGonagall seemed to have shaken Harry to his core, and it apparently showed. His friends tittered around him all afternoon and evening, asking if he was okay if he went too long lost in thought. Or when he abruptly became silent, having somehow forgotten about everything for a moment only to have it crash around him again.
"I… Yes, but he—what?"
, there's something
The majority of the school signed up to stay over the hols, and as they got steadily closer, the Yule Ball was all anybody talked about. A few brave girls approached Harry to ask him to it, and he was so taken off guard each time that he said no and bolted before he could catch up with his own thoughts. It was stupid, he could say yes to any of them and have the matter be solved. It was just... they smiled at him, blushing with hopeful batting eyes, and Harry just couldn't do it.
So, he tried to think of girls, because he was a boy. That was how it worked. He was a boy; therefore, he was supposed to toss over girls, like his dormmates clearly did. He would think of nameless, faceless female figures doing things to him.
"It sounds stupid being said to me."

, for their blood's sake. That blatantly ridiculous worry was immediately soothed when Aarav saw his outlines for using the new strain of the Black Death to dispatch Muggle tenants in the area. Surely, if Aarav had lost his mind and shagged a Muggle, he would have shown at least a little something. At the very least showed more interest toward the proof Nicholas had that wizards were immune to the Black Death—perhaps give a one worried look to his son. No, he was confident the child's mother wasn't

badges, too, even among the Slytherins. A few Slytherins still tried to taunt Harry with Skeeter's article, but they weren't getting nearly as many laughs, and they seemed to be giving up.
It was quiet with only distant echoes of dripping water, just like before, only this time, there were also small scurrying sounds, most likely rats running away from them. He felt an ominous chill being back. He was so caught up in proving Malfoy wrong, he hadn't thought what returning would make him

Hermione hummed. "He hasn't really been provoking you, Harry, not lately. Why are you provoking him?"
He sighed and, against his better judgment, agreed.

"Okay." Pushing down a memory of Malfoy's
"Some
"Absolutely."
"The next task is February twenty-fourth at nine in the morning. This," he lifted the golden egg, "opens and is supposed to give me a clue about the second task to help get ready for it."
That backfired spectacularly as his thoughts when observing Malfoy, while admittedly analytical, weren't entirely logical.
"Riddle it out if you think you know everything."
It wasn't as bad as he thought it would be. Luna did lead while still taking the traditional girl-position, and they seemed to be dancing the exact same as the others. It didn't take long for others to begin joining them, first the staff then some brave students.
Harry took a deep breath.
focusing on how hot and thirsty he was, he bumped into someone.
Malfoy finally looked back at Harry, and Harry's heart fluttered again. It took a second to realise it was less looking at Harry and more directing his disbelieving frown at him. "What do you see in her?"
"We know he's a good actor because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn't he? Now, I've been keeping an eye on the
Harry shrugged in answer, still counting.
"I know," Harry breathed, eyes still on Snape.
"Absolutely," Harry said as Ginny said, "No, nothing like that."
The tone and words squashed some of the exciting, and nervous, feeling in Harry. Harry sighed, feeling tired now. "No, Malfoy. Luna is a genuinely nice person— and a Ravenclaw, I might add."
"Not even Gryffindors can be brave enough to face certain truths about themselves. Facing yourself is far more difficult than anything you will face today. I want you to know that self-discovery and identity is a
This is admittedly a shorter chapter. I tried to make it that the reason for Harry's reactions to things are different from canon (ie, Ron's apology that never actually came in the book) is because of the disaster-gay thing. Which I will be the first to joke about, but in my own coming out, I unintentionally catalogued the people I had, who I thought I would still have if they knew, and randomly telling the people I thought I would lose how much I cared about them. I can testify that people will honestly surprise you, and I wanted our disaster-gay Harry to have that experience.
"Yeah?"
He hated that he liked what he saw.
As it stood, he had told one person and survived.
Harry still gagged and coughed, trying to get the stench out of his nose and throat.
"Huh?"
The eyebrow got higher. "Majs, in America. That's their terms, I think." His expression turned thoughtful. "Muggles and no-majs use non-binary, I think. If I'm not mistaken, it's a relatively new term in the community."
"I'll also have you know that Pansy doesn't pant after me, Potter."
Draco consulted his
"It's fine. I'm honoured to be your partner, Harry."
"I…" he thought for a moment about just saying fine, but he felt so far from fine, he wasn't even sure how to pretend to be.
"I'm warning you—"
He didn't know why it was a big deal. He didn't know why he was making it a big deal to himself. Harry thought of Professor McGonagall's and Hermione's encouraging words, but at the same time, he thought of the other things they said. Professor McGonagall's confidence that there would be backlash enough to need the staff's support. Hermione admitting she never confessed about her uncles because of what happened in primary over it. He thought of Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's words.
Also, please forgive any extra typos - no beta, and this thing doesn't support my usual spelling check software.
Harry hadn't realised he had been bellowing at the top of his lungs until he ran out of words. Stone dust was falling down around them from how his voice echoed so strongly, the ancient stones rattled. The invisible bubble Malfoy had cast around his head felt to have expanded, working overtime to accommodate Harry's rapid breathing.
Harry did not answer.
"What?" Malfoy said again, snapping his head to Harry. Although it was hard to see his facial expression in such little lighting, his tone was clearly incredulous.
She shook her head, smirking again. "I have a date, actually."
"Shut up, you little shite. Listen, we have enough time to drop off your stuff so you aren't stuck with it, but then I have to go."
Harry clenched his jaw. He hadn't been missing that every time Slytherins come up, she began to hedge an obviously reluctant conversation. Each time, it made him feel caught out, that she knew of his secret meetings with Malfoy or worse. Malfoy didn't help either, the bastard. He hadn't let up on Harry—Harry doubted he ever would—but the timbre of his taunts had taken a turn. Harry liked to imagine it was to soften the blows or something. He wasn't stupid enough, however, to think it had anything to do with Harry but instead more likely to ensure Harry wouldn't get angry enough to stop taking him to the Chamber.
"It'll probably be subtle," Malfoy began, looking around. "Let's look for subtle snakes, shall we?"
The moment he had seen Cedric Diggory Monday morning, he knew he had to tell the other champion about the dragons. He was overheard by Professor Moody, but the professor proved to be unpredictable yet again by giving Harry much needed advice. That night, instead of furiously trying to find what could work against a dragon's eyes (Harry lied that it was Sirius' suggestion), he and Hermione practised Summoning Charms.
Nicholas scowled.
"I do my own work," Malfoy argued.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay." She smiled. "But they're right."
"Never mind me, how are you?" Sirius returned seriously. "That was a mighty deep sigh I just heard."
"Yeah, but do you think she would have just walked into Voldemort?"
Harry's grin slipped. He sighed, looking away. He was honestly just relieved to be getting this chance. Every scenario and imaginings he had about showing Malfoy the Chamber of Secrets came back with full-force since getting Malfoy's note. But like last time, it only proved a distraction rather than a cure.
"Yes, sir." Draco straightened. "Of course, sir. Just a bit warm."
Malfoy glared. "You just know all the secret spots in this bloody castle, don't you?"
Harry crossed his arms but couldn't help a grin from wanting to spread on his face. "Fine."
Malfoy frowned a little, but not in his usual judgmental frown, or his mocking frown, or his
Hermione frowned at him, but Ron matched his sentiment. "I know. And Snape. Best to keep your head in the snake pit."
Harry shrugged. "I suppose. But Hermione… You and McGonagall are the only ones who know. I can barely accept it myself, I just… There's no way I can bring a bloke, Hermione."
Unable to stop himself, he plunged his head another the faucet and moaned.
He was shoved from behind, and Hermione stepped in, too, crossing her own arms again.
Malfoy led his Slytherins away, but Harry stared after him. He wasn't disappointed. Malfoy gracefully stepped away from them, letting Parkinson lead, and turned around to walk backwards, watching Harry. Harry was beyond pleased by this and tried to send Malfoy the slow, small nod Malfoy had given him before the task. By this time, Malfoy was rapidly getting too far away for Harry to see if it was returned.
Malfoy sighed. "Tonight, same time and place."
"Talking to the swan."
Malfoy stopped a little more than an arms-length from him.

"Oh, of course!" Skeeter grinned away her plain disappointment, both the quill and parchment slinking back into her bag. She aimed her grin at Hagrid. "How trying for your first year! I would love to tell your side of the story."
of all people, this whole time, thought Harry was a liar. Making up grand stories to be heroic and famous instead of actually barely surviving one trauma after another. Harry thought he knew the truth, was just spreading that Harry was lying just to, oh, he didn't know, bully Harry and isolate him. But he really thought that? For real? It was unacceptable. It was simply unacceptable.
He was sitting in the Potions lab telling himself to focus. To concentrate. It was starting to get ridiculous—really, it was. At first, he didn't think twice about how much he started drinking water during meals. It was Greg's comment that Draco must piss like a racehorse for Draco to realise that, despite how much he drank, no, he didn't. Clearly, his body was absorbing the water, and he told himself he must have just been dehydrated.
"Exactly… she disappeared in Albania, and that's definitely where Voldemort was rumoured to be last… and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn't she?"
, did Harry hate himself that he knew
"Anyway, when Ginny was taken, we had figured out where the entrance was, what the monster was, all of that. Ron and I actually went to tell the professors what we knew when the alert was sounded, so we hid in the staff room, wanting to find out what had happened. That's how we learned about Ginny. Lockhart was here, I'm sure you remember him…"
He was sick—something was
the Chamber of Secrets was something he should have ever done, he didn't know, and he marched back to Gryffindor tower.
"Don't sell yourself too short," Malfoy placated. "I'm sure you would have had loads of offers."
"Right…" Malfoy considered Harry for a long moment, and Harry tried not to fidget. "I would say great minds think alike, but considering one mind is yours…" he trailed off, pulling out a hand from a pocket to inspect his fingernails in what Harry knew was postering.
"I know," was all Hermione said.
Everything else in his life seemed to be improving as well. It was such a relief to have Ron back and for the school at large to be less hostile toward him. Harry guessed the latter had to do with Cedric Diggory, whom Harry suspected had told the Hufflepuffs to lay off in return for Harry's tip about the dragons. There were even less
a relationship..."
Harry let out his own small laugh. "Merlin… no wonder everyone thought I was lying."
"Go!" he hissed quietly. "
"That's okay," he smiled. "We'll figure something out."
"Oh my…" Malfoy's head dropped, him pinching the bridge of his nose and mumbling to himself. Harry only really caught "... impossible… trying
"Really? I've never heard of them before… where do they come from?"
"Oh, really?"
What was their relationship? Trying to think through an unbiased lens, Harry had to admit that Malfoy always was very respectful to Snape, more so than he had seen him be to other professors besides Flitwick and Sprout. Moreover, Malfoy always clearly worked harder to please Snape, the only person Harry could really think of seeing Malfoy
"My cousin had one. Broke it fairly quickly."

Harry couldn't, however, because oh no, Harry had been giving way to
"Ah, er… See… the thing is…"
Rita replied quickly, louder and more cheerfully. "What are these fascinating creatures called?"
Harry blushed because if only Malfoy knew his 'observational prowess.' He bit his lip in consideration, though. "Exactly what would…" he started but stop, remembering who he was speaking to.
"I said watch it," Harry bit out. "And no."
"Zabini?"
Harry nodded again. "I guess, what I mean is… What are your thoughts on," he took another deep breath, "people who don't like… thegenderthey'resupposedtolike."
That was around the Yule Ball, and now it was the end of January. He couldn't figure it out, what was making him so dehydrated. It was embarrassing enough as it was, with the others noticing he drank practically a whole pitcher of water at every single meal. But it was just getting worse and worse. He was now carrying around a travel goblet, only taking sips from it when he knew no one was looking. Which he could deal with, sure, but this…
to stop. It was driving him insane, and he refused to think about it. As a result, every wank put him in worse and worse moods.
He looked at their table, to the board, then back to the table. He and Ron had the flame too high, the excess goosegrass was gone, and no nicotine had been added. As he assessed this, their cauldron began to shake.
Harry gaped at Malfoy, slowly taking his words in. "Are you serious? You… you think I've been
Usually, Draco spent this time while they stumbled to follow his instructions by doing extra reading, getting ahead of his other assignments, or doing his own projects, such as creating Potter Stink badges. He was still proud of those—the charms weren't easy. That night, he was looking through Healer books while Vinny and Greg were writing an essay on a Transfiguration that was technically in last year's curriculum. Professor McGonagall generally assigned them extra credit like this to prepare them for upcoming lessons.
"What?" Malfoy breathed, looking wide-eyed at the skin.
"Computers…" Malfoy hummed. "I've heard of them. They depict stories and live microvision."
, Harry thought as he burrowed into bed,
"Potter?" he hissed.
"This is a dream, isn't it?" whispered Neville, visibly shocked to his bones. "I'm dreaming."
Reminder, this is a double chapter update, and I am working on a really old, slow computer currently. If you do not see the next chapter button, refresh, and please be patient if you have to do it several times… This thing freezes like black ice.
"The Vanishing Charm, Potter. We have to get rid of the rot before we can do anything else."
When he looked back, Malfoy was frowning at him, and he shrugged. "Ready to do this or not?"
"I'm not!"
"You mean you are actually taking a course in coming up with ways to die?" Malfoy asked, sounding thrilled.
He didn't like to think too hard about telling Ron about his abnormality— or his… whatever. His whatever. Besides, Professor McGonagall said herself that
to hover above where he worked, but Harry thought his shoulders tensed. "Why do
Horror, for a moment, slammed into him, his stomach rolling with the memory. But then he let himself remember all of it, including Professor McGonagall's words before he entered the champions' tent. She didn't say what she thought or felt about it one way or another, but she had said that self-discovery was a lifelong journey. She seemed to have no problems with him or how he might be, albeit she was obviously focused on the first task…
The next night, Harry found Malfoy in the toilets, speaking surprisingly amicably with Moaning Myrtle. There was always a fifty-fifty chance of running into her, and it seemed Malfoy had learned what Harry had, which was the best way to keep her as calm as possible and ensure she wouldn't tell on them was to be nice to her.
Immediately, the stone and tile started moving and slowly sunk into the ground, and in their place was the hole.
He would write to his parents, but… they had been acting strangely, lately. They were really stressed about something, though he had no idea what. A lot of the teachers seemed to be too. It was like something was in the air. He would have dug to try to find out why, but he had his own problems.
It was almost an hour before someone entered. Professor Flitwick pushed through the door with an apparent bounce in his step, but he froze upon seeing Harry.
"Thought Dumbledore said you weren' allowed inside the school anymore." Hagrid frowned, tying the lead securely.
Ron was talking fast as he led the way to the enclosure, telling Harry about the other champions. Cedric had attempted to distract the dragon by Transfiguring a rock into a dog. Fleur tried to dissuade her dragon by attempting a trance. Krum shot some spell directly into his dragon's eyes, which would have worked best if the dragon didn't stumble in agony and smash half her eggs. Harry hadn't exactly thought Malfoy was lying or being deceptive in his advice, but having such clear confirmation of Malfoy's honesty—honesty to
"Charm Professor Snape taught me," Malfoy answered, gently tapping his nose.
Professor McGonagall seemed thoroughly confused until her shoulders slumped woefully. Harry looked away, not knowing if what he saw was the beginning of pity or disappointment.
____________
He slowly blinked up to meet Malfoy's gaze. As he did so, an image from the night before—an unguarded Malfoy underneath a messy mop of white-blond hair—flashed across his vision, and it stung. It really did.
"Why not?"
Fine. Alright." He huffed and turned to survey the basilisk again. "I suppose this isn't a total loss. Basilisks are known to decompose more slowly than most animals, and the bones will be fine. I'll have to do some research, but most of her should be salvageable."
Malfoy jumped a little upon seeing him.
That was the third time since returning to Hogwarts. It was hardly the first time a bloke appeared unbedded into his thoughts while wanking, but unlike those times, he wasn't worried or concerned over what it could mean. He didn't have any room for those emotions because he was too busy being furious that it was
"Indeed. Take five points."
He actually told Professor McGonagall—of all people…
"That was fun, I guess," Harry said when the song was over. He applauded with everyone else as the Weird Sisters started their third song. "I like the faster beats."
"My…?" Harry threw out his hands, the dragon book he had begun to clutch flying out of his pocket. "I don't have one! For anything! Damn you, Malfoy, you can't accuse me of being a hopeless moron only to turn around and accuse me of some kind of scheme here!"
"He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic," Sirius bit out. "He said he'd seen the error of his ways, and then he named names…. He put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place… He's not very popular in there, I can tell you. And since he got out, from what I can tell, he's been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through the school of his. So watch out for the Drumstrang champion as well."
Harry and Ron jumped. They were in Transfigurations, and since they had already finished their work on Cross-Species Switches and therefore bored, they had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George's fake wands. Ron's was now a tin parrot, and Harry's was a rubber haddock. They both instinctively hid their items under the table, looking dutifully up at Professor McGonagall. Harry could feel the head of his haddock fall off and hoped it didn't roll off somewhere in view of McGonagall.
"I heard the champions have to open the ball," Malfoy continued, walking past Harry with his nose up.
Harry didn't look away though. For one, he wasn't going to actually show cowedness despite his carefully appeasing words, and for another, he wanted Snape to see that he was
"Divinations, Potter? You found that more interesting than something like Ancient Runes?"

Harry shrugged again. "Because it doesn't sit right with me, I guess. That you, especially
not… You can't just say stuff like that!"
to see. His voice when he spoke just sounded, well, snooty like always, but also confused. "He betrayed your parents, Potter."
He tossed it back onto the table and turned toward the fire, thinking about collapsing into one of the armchairs—only to jump sky-high to find Sirius' head in the fire.
They were nameless, faceless,
"It's the first task, isn't it? Dragons."
Really, he guessed, they started over the summer. That was when the cramps started anyway. He assumed they were growing pains, as he had a lot of them in third year. They kept increasing over time, however, and it became clear they were muscle cramps, not growing pains. They had eased off the past couple of months, and he hadn't one since before the Yule Ball.
She smiled. "Yes."
The first time wanking over
Harry blinked, his temper cooling. Was… was Malfoy giving
The scraping of stools on the floor made him jump, and he realised that Snape had put up the ingredients for them to start brewing. Ron, as always, had gotten up to gather said ingredients, and Harry set to work filling their cauldron with water and setting the flame. Some of the base ingredients they already had stored in their respective kits, and Harry checked both his and Ron's to see them still reasonably stocked.
Hermione was silent a long moment, feeling like hours to Harry, before she said carefully, "I don't think there's any one or more gender that people are
Malfoy watched Luna for a moment, visibly biting his tongue. "That's…" he started carefully.
Harry had to return to the champion's tent for details of the second task. He was beyond grateful that he had months to prepare. The end of February felt like a lifetime away.
The hospital wing was empty when he entered. He honestly didn't have much experience in the hospital wing. The longest he spent there was the year previous when that nasty creature sliced at his arm. He milked that for all it was worth, and he found the hospital wing reasonably comfortable. Not so much when the matron was there, but without her, comfortable enough to be getting on with.
However impulsive and daring his confession to Professor McGonagall was, it had made him feel lighter than even completing the first task did. In a way, her no-nonsense acceptance of him was like her acceptance of regular magical theory, and it felt like he had been given permission to be this way. That he was
"Does this still have to do with you being convinced you're dehydrated?"
"Like them, Potter?" said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached. "And this isn't all they do—look!"
The mention of the task made his stomach roll. He shook her off. "I just… I… Air. I need air."
But then, Malfoy was rounding on him looking truly furious, and Harry took a step back.
"Hey, Ginny, do you know anyone who wouldn't mind going
The desire to know Malfoy— to really, truly know him that he had been battling with for weeks, turned into a burning need. He needed to know what Malfoy looked like in other situations, in other settings— in
It was like if he could
Malfoy blinked, obviously surprised, but Harry slipped in, tearing off his Cloak and hiding it in a corner, and stood with his arms crossed and a scowl on his face.
"Nothing," Harry said, shaking his head and grabbing his Cloak. "Come on, let's get to Hogsmeade."
For whatever reason, that seemed to become the main criterion with them because if they mentioned anything else, almost literally anything else, some form of argument broke out. It was as if the novelty of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, putting aside their rivalry to harvest a basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, was rapidly wearing off in favour of their usual and habitual animosity. Harry's casual, "Wow, that's a pretty advanced spell" was a catalyst to a detailed monologue in all the ways he was inferior in spellwork. Likewise, Malfoy's small admission at another point of, "I got the idea when Professor Flitwick cooed over Granger's latest essay," was met with a spitting rant about Malfoy's prejudices.
Harry himself was just in regular trousers and a jumper. He thought for a moment about removing the jumper, just wearing his vest, but as he was not going to be fighting basilisks and Riddle this time around, he figured he was probably going to feel the chill. It wasn't an important jumper anyway.
people rooting for him in this tournament. He wasn't alone in this.
Malfoy took a step forward.
, I'll need a week to do some research, maybe a few days to get the supplies to at least start."
Harry didn't care about his score. Both of their indignations on his behalf on Karkaroff's low score was worth the entire tournament to him. And despite himself, he couldn't help noticing that it wasn't just his friends—it wasn't just his five people—nor was it just Gryffindors or even just
He blamed the dream. He blamed the wanks. He blamed his life being a complete nightmare, and because of the dream and the wanks, and finding out that Malfoy—
"That's because Ronald wanted me to pick a date for him and do all the work. He probably would have made me ask for him! This is different."
Fortunately, nothing about Hagrid appeared in the papers, and strangely enough, Snape began to largely leave Harry alone.
"A broomstick," interrupted a voice. Harry twirled around to see Malfoy, his gang of Slytherins not far behind. They were already cackling even though Malfoy was too far away for them to hear.
"Dumbledore's bird, though. He's a phoenix, so they can carry loads…" he trailed off seeing Malfoy blinking at him. "Well, see, I showed loyalty, or something, to Dumbledore, so his bird, Fawkes, appeared, and had the Sorting Hat, which was what gave me the sword of Gryffindor, and Fawkes was the one to peck out the basilisk's eyes so I could fight it, and…"
This was precisely why and how Draco Lucius Malfoy got a nasty surprise during his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Malfoy huffed air out of his nose like a bull, the sound slightly muffled from the invisible bubble. He was clearly not appeased.
"I am assuming you are aware that the champions require partners for the Yule Ball?"
"What's wrong?" Greg asked, looking concerned.
"Carry on, carry on," Professor McGonagall's voice broke through the awkward silence, herding the strangling students inside. "Hurry up now, the ball's about to start."
that he was clinging to something he knew was wrong?
Strangely enough, Malfoy nudged her with the elbow she had attached herself to. The movement made Harry look at Malfoy again, and his chest constricted. Harry had seen Malfoy's pale cheeks pink several times, but usually, it was in anger. Or humiliation, such as the ferret incident. Right now, Harry didn't know what was causing the light pinking, but his brain short-circuited and
Malfoy shrugged, suddenly like he didn't care. "Fine. Don't know what else I was expecting. I suppose you want to try again next weekend?"
With a furious roar, Harry balled up the paper and threw it across the room. A few first years that had been in there scrambled as soon as Harry started yelling, and now it was just them. Harry rubbed his face roughly. He felt a slight stinging in his eyes, and he took care to rub them extra hard. The absolute
Malfoy hummed. "For a girls' toilet, I didn't expect it to be so…"
Harry physically missed a step at the word.
He completely deflated and looked back at Professor McGonagall.
Malfoy shrugged. "Who else? Parkinson, of course."
The Saturday before the first task was a Hogsmeade weekend. Hermione convinced him to go, but it honestly didn't take much. She tried to arrange it so they would meet up with Ron at the Three Broomsticks, but he likewise was able to easily convince her that if they went, they wouldn't meet Ron and he got to wear his Invisibility Cloak.
Malfoy's eyes flicked over Harry's shoulder, back to Harry, but then quickly back over his shoulder where he frowned. "What on earth is she doing?"
Nicholas never confirmed exactly what that informant had told him, and mostly, those who worked for the family assumed the child's mother was a half-blood. When Nicholas died and Aarav came back to take over the family, they all politely looked the other way, and it was never spoken of again. Before he died, though, Nicholas Malfoy penned a missive to whoever would be the Master of the Manor seven to nine generations from then to warn that a creature would present in the family. Years later, the Manor would be set on fire during a riot in one of the goblin wars, and the hidden missive would burn.
Because that was what Malfoy did to Harry—always somehow burrowing into him, making him react before thought had time to catch up.
Instead, there he was, chastising himself for wanking over Draco sodding Malfoy
Malfoy very slowly peeked around the corner at the end of the corridor, and Harry watched with amusement as Malfoy emerged, wand already out and ready, to squint down the seemingly empty hall.
Harry laughed. "Yeah, not literally, don't worry, Krum." He offered Luna his arm again, settling in to wait. He forced his face to turn serious as he added, "But I'm watching you."
giving Malfoy extra favouritism. Harry thought back to how strongly Malfoy reacted to Harry's comments on Snape and frowned down at his book.
. I would like to imagine Salazar Slytherin had planned for that and done the appropriate spellwork, but there's also the matter that you said the creature travelled via the pipes, so there's no telling how much of what residue was on the creature and had affected the water inside here—"
"Right, sorry. Me first."
"Lovely." She smiled and looked back to Hagrid. "Really lovely. Been teaching long?"
"Yes," and, "Sure," were their clipped answers. Harry and Ron exchanged a shrug and returned to what they were doing.
Tonight, though…
"I was on my way to give you this," his valet said with only a slight flinch. He held out a scroll. "Aarav and his child left this morning. They sent this all around the Manor before it was given to me to deliver."
, not like, well, not like
I know it's a big canon Harry thing that he hates dancing, but I wanted there to be more Luna-dancing in honour of the actress who played Luna and made up the wedding dance during filming. God, I love her.
"Yeah," Harry sighed again, wrapping an arm around Luna. "Yeah, I suppose it is."
He circled that one and noted they went away around the time he began what he privately called his "drinking problem", mildly thinking of his mother with elf-wine and his father with Firewhsikey.
Ron sniggered. "Come on. They'll be putting up your scores…"
—if she wasn't—
"Well? Looking for ideas, or what?"
"Yes. Absolutely," Harry returned tightly.
"Yeah," Harry automatically said, voice sounding far-away even to his own ears.
"I like your phrasing better."
He put on the Cloak in the dorms, and they began the trek to the grounds. They were on the first floor close to the marble staircase when a soft, "Granger!" was called out, and Malfoy took a spot beside her.
"Potter! Weasley!"
"Hold these."
Harry frowned. "Don't you—?"
"Harry!" Hermione hissed.
He just grinned back at her and shrugged. The crumpled pieces of that particular avoidance bin of his mind felt like the best kind of rebellion.
He stopped around the corner from the corridor where he knew Malfoy was already waiting, stowed away his Cloak and map in his large robe pockets, and took deep breaths to calm himself.
Unexpectedly and seeming out of nowhere, Snape's eyebrows flew up, a look of shocked astonishment on his face. Harry half expected that expression at his words but not a full ten seconds afterwards. Snape looked down quickly, however, and when he looked back, his usual sneer was firmly in place. Although his eyes were just as sharp, if not also calculating.
"You cheat."
"Very good," Professor Snape praised, and Draco jumped, not realising he had come to stand in front of them. It would seem while Draco was trying to focus on
"Perhaps if you take any
really am going to show you, but erm… Look, I know exactly how this is going to sound, alright?"
Ravenclaw students would wear their uniforms without robes most often in the library. Harry knew their tower was second highest in the whole castle, and the more he observed, the more he began to realise that taking that many stairs so many times a day gave way to really fit legs and… very firm arses, to be frank. While other students utilised lower shelves to reach for high-up books, Ravenclaws, particularly the boys who were taller, merely had to stretch a little. Some of their untucked shirts lifted up to reveal how form-fitted their trousers were.
He trailed off as they got to a large pile of rubble and what was left of the basilisk skin. Harry knew what it was immediately, but it took Malfoy a moment to suck in a huge breath.
Harry blinked and realised he hadn't been listening. Malfoy was clearly expecting a reply but was not getting one, and as Harry watched, Malfoy's face twisted, the guardedness coming back in spades. "Gees, I'm sorry, Malfoy," he rushed to say, shaking his head. "Sorry, I got distracted. What did you ask?"
Dobby now looked healthy and happy. Clearly, freedom suited him, which was more than Harry could say for Winky. The difference between them was striking, one bubbly and bragging about his new wages, the other gloomy and horrified, bound and determined to stay loyal to her former master.
Hermione frowned, trying to look over at him even though she couldn't see him. She always did hate that about the Cloak. "Is this about Cho?"
is," his valet continued, "he'll still carry on the name."
Both Harry and Malfoy jumped apart, Malfoy spinning around, to find Snape down the path and looking murderously at Harry.
"I told you I'd be cross if you cancelled."
Harry's attention was caught from their work when Snape had gone a round of the classroom only to circle back to Malfoy's table where the blond was brewing with Crabbe. Or, rather, brewing with Crabbe there.
Harry nodded sheepishly, fighting the urge to blurt out that Luna was not a real date. He also wanted to take a giant step away from Luna to emphasize the point, but he didn't want to be rude. Luckily, Luna apparently felt the need to clarify as well.
. "Actually be of some usefulness, Potter, and bring me a jar."
. Put aside the fact that you should be clever enough to know, but it's
"Drink of Despair, sir, also known as the Emerald Potion."
Harry nodded, biting his lip.
Harry swallowed. He would give anything to have Ron back. Ron was his

Harry felt sick, numbness spreading throughout his body. He tried very hard to push away how this was making him feel, which was mostly betrayed.
Also, please note that the Vanishing Charm is actually technically a Transfiguration spell. I didn't know that when writing this, I thought it was Charms, because you know, Vanishing "Charm". But according to the HP wiki, it's Transfig. Please suspend some disbelief for me there; in this little fic, it's Charms.
He very quickly made his way to the second floor where he left his Cloak and map then back to Gryffindor tower. He was exhausted but still took a shower, longer than he needed but he chose not to think on why, and went to bed feeling more relaxed than he had in weeks.
Luna followed but was silent now. As they entered the entrance hall, that still had several students and watchful professors, Luna asked, "Did I upset you?"
Never again. Malfoy could piss off. Harry had enough to worry about.
"How do you do that?" Malfoy asked, gesturing to Harry up and down.
They hadn't been able to get rid of the rotting smell completely, but Malfoy did a good job vanishing the worst of it. He also had loads of ingredients and herbs, part of the complicated burden of the harvest, that covered the smell pretty well. Malfoy still needed a stool to be able to reach whatever part he was working on, which meant he inevitably would be having Harry go back and forth between him and the chest-work-station. Harry had found a mat of sorts during one of the times he got away with poking around it, and that mat he stomped to and sat on now, in a good position to be Malfoy's runner. Malfoy never protested nor moved it.
" The last he said in Parseltongue, and the sink obediently began closing. "Fine. Go on believing I'm the world's biggest tosser who actually
Harry pushed away those distressing thoughts, reminded himself his crush was
Harry Potter laid awake in his four-poster bed in Gryffindor tower, hating himself.
He picked up one of the buttons, sighing. He had gotten used to seeing them around the school, and so wasn't as bothered by them like he originally was. He hated that he wished they simply just said
Harry's jaw dropped then, and whispers swept through the room, Parvati almost unseating herself to reach Lavender. Snape lingered just a moment, and Harry got the impression that the point awarded to him had nothing to do with Potions.
"Figures," he grumbled, continuing on his way with a sour look on his face.
Harry cleared his throat, suddenly feeling awkward. "And I found Ginny, killed the basilisk, and we left."
"I should add this next, right?"
Or… wait. He shook his head. It wasn't wrong, right? And he wasn't doing that, right?
fault. If it wasn't for the fact that Malfoy very obviously had no clue what went on in his mind, Harry would have taken satisfaction in investigating what sort of drug or potion Malfoy slipped him to thoroughly fuck up his life.
When he looked back into Malfoy's eyes, there was clear surprise there, but also so much else that Harry, unfortunately, didn't have time to parse through.
"Crap," Harry groaned.
', but I highly recommend you take a much happier, self-fulfilling path for yourself."
Pansy had been holding out for him, after all. And she was dense enough to believe him if he said he wanted to wait for physical stuff until he was married, and smart enough to leave it well alone.
Hermione did not look happy about this at all, but she roamed calculating eyes over both of them and slowly left the room. Harry knew she would be right outside, probably with her wand ready, so he stepped closer and spoke quietly.
The Slytherins howled with laughter, each of them following Malfoy's lead and pressing their badges.
He winced a little, thinking of Ron, but the pain he felt over Ron's recent behaviour couldn't dim the
The silence between them seemed to stretch so much, it almost felt like that invisible bubble around his head was expanding again. Sounds echoed in the Chamber as Malfoy shifted on his feet once more.
"Mr Potter?"
Luna was absolutely an oddity, Harry could tell. She had an aura about her that was almost ethereal, not to mention the tiny broccolis that were serving as earrings and her piercing stare at Harry that was almost unblinking. Harry, however, knew he couldn't be choosy, and he was confident there wouldn't be any misreadings between them. Well, not in any romantic sense. He figured he was going to be misreading her often, but it was good enough for him.
Harry gulped. "Okay," he said, standing and letting his fork slip out of his hand. It landed on his plate of uneaten food with a loud
I don't know if it was ever canonically confirmed, but ever since we learned about Legilimency, I always assumed that every time Harry stares down Snape (or at Dumbly) and the other's stare was describe as piercing, x-rayish, or probing, that they were using that on Harry. So, just in case I didn't make that obvious, this is exactly what I meant Snape to have done in Potions.
"Okay…"
He scowled at Harry. "How do you do that?"
Malfoy snorted. "Should have thought of that before you put your name in the Goblet."
while he could still see a fantasy-Malfoy on his knees between Harry's legs.
Heads up for Harry's explosive temper. I'm basically running this off the characterisation of how Harry is when under tremendous pressure--which in this he already is but then add in the tension of coming to terms with sexuality and being a disaster-gay. If it doesn't work, just let me know! Happy to edit and change!
"For fuck's sake, Malfoy, this isn't a lecture course!" he interrupted loudly, having had enough.
Harry opened his mouth but paused. "Actually… that's a good point."
He stared her down. His heart thundered in fear of what the ever-living-hell she would print if she knew half the thoughts in his head—which were
"What does that mean?" Malfoy snapped back. "Me, of all people?"
But then Malfoy was clearing his throat and said simply, "Okay."
After a weekend of blatantly hiding, Harry found himself alone in his dorm, trying to study, when a tap came to the window. It was almost pathetic, with how his heart rate picked up merely because he recognised the owl. Of course, he recognised the owl. It was the same owl he had seen make near-daily deliveries to the Slytherin table for four years now.
No one else was out except for a few stragglers late leaving Herbology. Their path to the bridge was clear, and Harry was quiet as they entered, chewing his lip.
Also, I feel like a disaster-gay Harry would simply get along with Luna better. He knows the queer trails, my friends. I'm also happily trying to take this opportunity to create my own weird-Luna-creatures, hence the Glistering Waterbats! Ha! *slaps leg* coming up with weird shit is fun.
Pain sparked through Harry's knee as he skidded down a few steps, having missed one. A few students walking down them giggled at him as they walked around to pass him. He ignored them, tenderly wiping his knee while re-shouldering his bag.
It was perhaps unfortunate because the movement seemed to have drawn attention from a figure leaving one of the boathouses. The sun was at an angle that it was difficult for Harry to see who it was, but the figure seemed comfortable approaching him. Wildly, he hoped it was Ron, coming to apologise and offer comradery over the article.
Yesterday—it was a stressful day and sometimes people, that is stress can sometimes, or I heard that, you know, stress can—"
He smiled brightly at her. "I'm sure they did, Luna. I hear there's also going to be ice sculptures."
Finally, after an hour of getting distracted and physically shaking his head to dislodge the thoughts, Malfoy began to notice. He mocked Harry for having fleas, to which Harry defended that he was just trying not to fall asleep.
Malfoy, on the other hand, was solely focused on his task, and it depressed Harry that Malfoy was clearly uninterested in whether or not Harry was even there. He tried to tell himself that it was a good thing, that maybe it would give him time to really observe Malfoy and figure himself out.
"I didn't know you had a godfather," Harry said thoughtfully, watching as Malfoy messed with some jars and something that looked like an ancient scythe.
Harry bristled. "I'm not!"
Draco leaned over to look at the section to which Vinny had pointed. He read the section, understanding it clearly, then re-read it through a Vinny-and-Greg lens.
Shower. What he really wanted was a really cold, long shower.
"It is tradition. You are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school," she said firmly, tone booking no argument. "However, I took the liberty of checking the rules, and nothing specifies a requirement for the partners."
attractive. He looked himself over, trying to pretend it wasn't himself to decide if he would find someone like Harry good-looking. He bit his lip, trying to think of other words to describe himself other than 'skinny' and 'bony'.
"No, erm… we flew using… a bird."
"Scared?"
Harry's stomach rolled as he noticed red spreading in Hagrid's cheeks. He knew the man well enough that it wasn't from the exertion of finishing off the skrewt's knot.
Still, and even though Harry could admit he was probably imagining it, it felt like Malfoy's jibes stung less. He still carried on as always, but his eyes would shine as if Harry was somehow in on the joke himself. Harry could also feel him watching Harry, both in the Great Hall and the library.
Luna nodded. "Wouldn't be a ball without a little drama."
does a zoological column every Wednesday, as I'm sure you know. We could feature—"
"So?" Hermione asked.
"What is it with you lately, mate?" Ron asked, giving Harry a helping hand up.
"Yeah," Harry agreed, "we are."
Did Malfoy just really not know Harry?
Across the library, Potter seemed to be in the same frame of mind, looking around, and their eyes locked. Draco raised a cool eyebrow at him, and Potter scowled and looked back down at the book in front of him. Potter, Weasley, and Granger seemed to be studying, and he knew it bugged Potter when they were in the library at the same time. It was never more than the exchange they just had—in truth, Potter probably didn't give them much notice, but when he did, it was satisfying.
Harry could feel his blush spread. To his horror, he began to babble.
"Want to go first or me?"
"Did you think it wouldn't be?" Malfoy mocked.
Malfoy nodded. Harry wasn't sure, trying to focus on the conversation and not Malfoy's face, but he thought maybe they had stepped even closer. Either way, Malfoy was close enough for Harry to see in stark detail as one snowflake too many landed on a front strand of Malfoy's hair, causing it to fall across one grey—silver in this light—eye.
"Harry, we still have three more exams—"
did he have to think about boys this way, and for Merlin's sake
When they reached the enclosure, Hermione and Ron explained the scoring system over each other. Both of them cheered, grabbing onto Harry where they could, as the judges gave their numbers.
Hell, would he even notice Harry's step?
"I think I like boys—"
Harry scowled, crossing his own arms. "Are you kidding me? Do you not believe me
and mocked Harry for bringing something he could so easily lose in the Chamber. Which proved embarrassing when Harry did indeed lose it. To as not highlight that embarrassment, Harry forewent looking for it, hoping that maybe he could come back some other time without Malfoy and search for it and that in the meantime, the thing wouldn't trying eating off the basilisk.
Draco rushed out of the library, only slowing when he was in the corridor, knowing Vinny and Greg would catch up eventually.
It was pathetic and stupid about how he couldn't say that without smiling. He could refuse Malfoy, but he knew he wouldn't.
"Do you…" he opened, interrupting her. He hadn't been listening anyway. "Do you… ever, think about stuff?"
Harry gulped, pulling his sleeves down over his hand when he noticed he was wringing them again.
"I'll have you know I had to suck up to that oaf Hagrid about his outrageous, illegal skrewts just to get access to the Restriction Section's unit on magical creat—"
—he became conscious that he had missed not just lunch but his next class.
Even better, Luna approached him the next day in the Great Hall to tell him that another Ravenclaw, Padma Patil, Parvati's twin, was willing to go with Ron. Ron was less than thrilled but accepted under the mean glare Parvati was giving him.
"So, Potter, pray tell, which of your gagging, giggling fans will be on your arm at the ball? That Hufflepuff that towers over you? One of the little firsties that shriek in delight at your mere presence? I do hope it's not one of them—how would we ever hear the music over your precious date's siren song… Ah, but wait, it's not one of them since they're already terrorising the school with their weeping that Perfect Potter rejected them."
Hermione didn't accept 'nothing' as an answer, though, and pestered Harry through the castle grounds. As she did, he chewed his lip and thought. Harry doubted Hermione would support anything to do with Malfoy, but he wondered what her thoughts would be on
This time, Malfoy was waiting in the shadows, but Harry knew where he was thanks to the map.
it is people think about, when it comes to what
Malfoy crossed his arms, seeming honestly insulted. "How else do you think Vi—Crabbe and Goyle have passed all these years."
"'Weed of Sorrows', sir."
In this chapter, there is some text straight from the book, chapter nineteen. The reason for this is because of Harry's conversation with Sirius, so the lifted text is mostly from that dialogue. The reason for /that/ is to remind readers (and also myself so I don't have to go digging through the book all the time) about where we are with canon plot and things.
"He's not even good-looking!" Hermione muttered angrily one day, making Harry jump so hard, his knee banged the table.
, Harry took a big breath. "Three Broomsticks first, then?"
Harry nodded, frowning.
Malfoy's face became briefly incredulous before going back to the guarded-flatness. "A bird."
Malfoy groaned. "I am in no mood to hear about your great heroics and feats against death—"
"Dance partners, yes."
Before leaving dinner, Harry made sure to catch Malfoy's eye and mouth, "
Harry didn't know what noise he made, but he doubted it sounded human.
Malfoy obviously thought the same. "Tomorrow? Don't you think that's cutting it too close?"
"I know, Harry, but I've been reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman's article last month about Moody. Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm—"
Harry sighed. "Guys, can we just go back to the castle? I think I'd really like a snack and maybe a nap."
He scowled at the boiling potion in his cauldron. It was thinner than it was supposed to be, making the clear liquid look too much like water. This whole thing—it was ridiculous—because something inside him was
"That's good. Does this mean you'll still introduce me to Dobby?"
