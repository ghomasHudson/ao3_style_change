Harry leans backwards, puts his hands on Malfoy’s thighs and pushes himself up and slams right back down. Malfoy growls and tightens his fist around Harry’s cock. Harry repeats the movement, faster and harder. Malfoy starts making small abortive thrusts with his hips. Harry can feel his restraint.
Malfoy nods his head in agreement. “They sure did, Potter.” He palms Harry’s nape and pulls him into another kiss. It’s slow at first or maybe Harry’s mind is slow, because he doesn’t understand. This makes Harry push him away to speak.
I also love having him in my mouth, I can't get enough. I'd do this every day if I could. If he'd let me.
I am almost drunk at this point and can’t believe this conversation is happening. I just nod and then she says she will write and stumbles. I catch her forearm to steady her.
We had lunch. Then there was a dessert and tea and all that time, Malfoy was behaving like a complete tosser. He didn’t smirk once, no sneers, he was laughing and talking, playing with Teddy and even helped cleaning the dishes. Granted, he barely spoke to me, but other than that, he wasn’t obvious about it, because if I asked him something directly, he answered politely. It was some sort of alternate reality, that afternoon.
‘Great! So, this was lovely. I will start on the contract tomorrow and on Monday we will hopefully finish it at the office, but as I know our legal department, might take some time. But in any case, I’ll owl you, yeah?’
‘And then,’ Pansy goes on like she was never interrupted, ‘this went on for ages until you decided to leave, to which Potter said he had to go too and the two of you chose to walk home, probably, I don’t know. I just saw you leaving, and very rudely by the way, you didn’t even say goodbye, and then you were out and that’s the last I saw you.’ They both stare at me intensely.
Instead, what I saw was Hogwarts. Just that. A castle, static, in the distance. Not that I don’t love Hogwarts, but I was a little disappointed. When I told George and Ron what I saw, they both frowned and said they’d look into it and do some adjustments. They would tell me when it’s ready so we can try again.
‘Okay, I’m going to make some tea. Do you want something?’ Hermione asks as she makes her way to the kitchen.
He swivels around and puts on a fake half-smile. “Malfoy. What’s up, mate?” Malfoy looks bemused for a second and Harry imagines his own cringe must be showing. He’s never said
He lies between my thighs, we kiss. I roll my hips and I love his gasp. I love how he moves against me, how his hair is already plastered to his forehead with sweat, how he wrenches his glasses away, how he looks at me, how he touches me, how he makes me feel insane.
‘For fuck’s sake! Stop it Malfoy!’ I grab in the dark and I manage to take hold of something, forearm and fingers.
‘Did you apply for a job with the Ministry before? To work as a potion master?’ Potter asks out of the blue.
‘Yeah, of course I am. You know what I meant,’ he waves his hand vaguely and continues his… work, I guess.
Morning sun is reflecting off flecks of dust in the room. He’s sweaty, even though he kicked the sheets off during the night. He looks at the ceiling, counting his breaths.
So, I’ve been following him this weekend as well, and today he went out, again with Parkinson. So I thought,
When Harry pulls away, Malfoy releases a soft whimper which he covers immediately by a cough but that isn’t fooling Harry. He smiles and says: “If you want, we can go inside.”
'Yes, a good person. Someone like you. Not someone like me.' He took a deep breath. 'Now that we're clear, get out. I am tired of listening to you.' He lowers his wand and steps back.
I flop back down on my chair and just hope Malfoy will be able to get over himself by next week. It’s not like I’m doing it to spite him, murder him or for my own entertainment, damnit!
‘Draco! So nice to see you! How are you?’ Here her expression turns pitying and I know she must’ve heard.
She’s being sarcastic, I think, I can’t really tell but I can’t say I mind. ‘We want just the best for our customers. You are always welcome to use our services as well if you so wish.’
‘Okay. I’m going to fly now. Come on Harry, you can watch!’ He takes my hand and is pulling me up. I laugh and stand up.
'What a hypocrite you are, Potter. Coming here, lecturing me, trying to make me guilty of something I had no power over and here
‘You know what things. And okay, I will not hold it over you, you said it during sex, but still. You could treat me as always, at least.’ He’s angry, standing up, taking the plates and cutlery, putting it in sink.
, when he put his clothes to rights and he did the same with mine, because apparently, I was useless, he asked to show him around. He said he used to come here when he was little, he frowned when he saw the renovated parlour and hall, said the red on the walls was
‘Hm. I think we need a museum. I do hope you’ll try to lick some old artefact or better yet, a bone.’ I grin and he scowls.
‘Of course. So, what, I would just be left to die of a heart attack?’ He rubs his hands on his trousers, his forehead glistening with droplets of sweat.
‘Of course it is, what else would it be about?’ Hermione smirks and I know Malfoy’s behaviour is rubbing off on her.
‘People usually wait to be invited in before barging in, Malfoy,’ I say as I stand up, walking to my desk.
'Nothing, absolutely nothing, Potter! As always you proved your work is above all, above your friends and family, above me! Why would I be upset with you for that? It's not like you're the Head Auror and you could've sent literally anyone else other than youtself for this huge arrest of yours! You made a fool out of me! You didn't let me know, no note, no patronus, nothing!! I had to make an excuse for your horrid behaviour! But do not worry, I had an amazing time, lots of presents and alcohol to flush down the disappointment. I fucking made this place a home, Potter. I decorated for the party, I even baked myself a birthday cake! I cleaned your dirty laundry today from the bathroom floor also, because you keep disregarding my displeasure with your utter sloppiness! I did it all so everyone would feel nice today, cozy and at home, for our friends, for us, because you fucking suggested for it to be today, because 'why not join it, Draco, it will be lovely'! So I fucking expected the decency you would come, I wanted just this day for you to be here with me because it was all your fucking idea from the beginning when you suggested we live together!'
They sent an auror who was not assigned to the Berlin case to investigate the incident. My mind was still foggy the first time he came, yesterday. So, he came back this morning, spending almost three hours asking me question after question and my headache got even worse. Thank god the others already talked to him, or it might have been even more torturous.
Rose pouts like only children can and plops down on the carpet playing with a pair of socks. Ron puts Hugo in his crib and then sits down in the armchair.
Harry considers pretending he doesn’t hear. But Ron does. He turns his head and stops. “Malfoy’s calling you,” he announces helpfully so Harry has to halt as well, because if he wouldn’t, then he’d just come out as an asshole.
He guides us into a balcony larger than the room was, with several people lounging around and tables full of food and drinks. He stops in front of a sofa with five people. He leans in and talks to a woman in long white dress sitting in the middle.
‘Really?’ Ron asks, sounding pretty heartbroken himself. ‘Oh, well I guess, if that’s what you want.’
Harry’s vision is blurred and his eyes water from all the light. He feels woozy and warm. For a moment he thinks he’s back at King’s Cross and that Dumbledore will appear from behind some corner.
He knocks and waits until Hermione opens the door. ‘Hello, Draco. Come in. Oh, Harry, do you need something?’
I smile at him and sip my overly sweet drink. His hand moves higher up my thigh until it’s resting on my crotch, squeezing p. I smirk, looking at the dance floor, thinking of all things I want to do to him.
He holsters his wand. ‘You will once we are back in England. It is in a safe vault right now, so you don’t have to worry, no one will access it.’
'Yes. But to answer your extremely intruding inquiry, I am happily single. You should try it. Does wonders.'
'I think you do, maybe not consciously, but deep down, it's there, true, even if small but there either way.'
He doesn’t expect it when Malfoy helps him stretch his legs alongside his. Or when Malfoy then manoeuvres them and guides Harry’s cock inside of him, wet and ready. Or when he kisses him and keeps kissing him.
Harry blushes even more. He thinks he knows who Malfoy’s type was, but he’d still rather hear it from him. Just to avoid any unnecessary misunderstanding. “Well, who?”
I sit down on the sofa and take an already prepared drink from the table. ‘So, what’s this about? You don’t look particularly miserable and Blaise mentioned some wailing,’ I say and sip from my glass.
I went to get it yesterday, after Malfoy sent an owl, terse and official. I came, he gave me the awful thing and I asked him if he wanted to go take a walk after he’s done. He shrugged but said
'You don't have to know everything. And why do you think I don't speak to you about it? Exactly because of this, because you hate it when I'm like this.'
'I knew you'd love it!' She hugs me and then the others start wishing me all the best. Hermione, who looks apologetically at me and says: 'I tried to stop it, Harry, I did. Bit it was just too much Weasleys, even for me.' Ron hugs me too, pushing beer in my hand which I gratefully take and drink almost half of it in one go. Luna's here, her hair wildly flowing around her, smelling like dirt and grass and I can barely hear her in all the mingling voices and music as she advices me to go erumpents seeing to clear my mind. Neville is next, and then George and Bill and Angelina, Fleur and Seamus and Dean, and others.
I just got back from a four-day mission with Davies. I was being punished for going to Kingsley and demanding for the Knockturn patrol to be cancelled, that’s the only explanation. Otherwise, why would Robards sent me to Swedish woods to track Mooncalf smugglers with fucking Davies? We were living in a tent, no heating, smelling like sweat and eggs, with Davies complaining constantly. We barely managed to catch them because he was just whining about how hungry he was.
‘Yeah? Anything else?’ he leans forward too and kisses me briefly. Then the waiter comes back, we pay and we are leaving, Timothy is grabbing my hand and pulling me with him. Outside we apparate to mine and he’s undressing me and pushing me on the bed, kissing me, making me moan his name and keen in pleasure.
I can’t see anyone from my team, I can’t see Malfoy either. I start sending hexes. I see Jacoby being escorted away, huddled between men and women. I wish I could take them down, but I must find Malfoy, no matter what.
It’s also unfair Harry still has not managed to lure someone into his bed. It might be bit arrogant, but he thought it would be easier, being him and all. Alas, it’s not. He flirts and he laughs and he’s all charm, and then he gets stuck. He can’t make himself follow through with it.
‘Thanks, it was really hard there for a moment, when I saw those birds, looked very lickable,’ I smile. I decided this morning when he woke me up that I won’t let him to embarrass me, or at least won’t make him see it. I decided I will answer with sarcasm all of his stupid remarks.
To sum it all up, Malfoy now knows I was at the Manor (which is not the greatest but I can live with it). He was furious and demanded my immediate resignation as an auror to which I informed him that I’ve been doing this in my free time and so he has no leverage (which is not true and it would fuck me up if he was to go and complain and I think he knew I was bulshitting him because his eyes narrowed in suspicion, most probably) and Parkinson was grinning, saying
'Sometimes it can be and it's completely fine, I get it. There will be a lot more other different parties.'
I notice Malfoy's manged to paralyse other two men in the meantime, both lying on the floor, face down.
I smile, looking around for anything suspicious. ‘Because it wouldn’t be you who would have to run after someone.’
I keep thinking about Robards and his stupid remarks about my competency and it’s not helping at all in this situation. But I really don’t like the man, stuck up in his old ways. At least Kingsley is on my side in this. He approved my proposal so fuck what Robards thinks. I honestly have to stop thinking about him.
‘So… do you think that even though we were both drunk, both times, that I took advantage? I was aware he was more drunk than me and I still… we still did it.’ I stare at the flames again and Ron puts up his feet back up on the table.
He came to mine on Friday. I, unlike him, offered him pasta I made. He looked at it like it was poisoned but ate without too many scathing comments and then he kneeled in front of me, and afterwards I practically carried him in my room so I could return the favour and then he left once his breathing calmed down.
Harry closes his eyes when Malfoy makes a loose fist around both of them and slides it up and down slowly. “I like to be on top.”
I get out of bed, shame coming back for me. How could I ever let this happen, let this go on? I killed a man for him because he would sent him to Azkaban just so he could avoid it.
Almost as though Malfoy reads his mind, he asks: “Why are you walking with me, by the way? No need, I’m fine.”
Harry knows what Malfoy smells like when he’s all sweaty and his skin is glistening. He smells like musk and apple and something Harry can’t even describe, so divine he would like to bathe in it. In Malfoy’s sweat. It’s so fucked that sometimes Harry thinks he’s really gone crazy.
I stopped over for lunch at Andromeda’s. Well, she practically invited me the other day, so I don’t know why she looked surprised when she opened the door for me.
I wanted to say no or not write back at all, but he said we could play a seekers game and who am I to refuse Quidditch?
I use a quick spell to freshen my clothes, put them on and go down as quietly as possible - I try Apparating in his room, but there are wards, of course.
We’re sitting on a bench in the Friedrichshain public park, at nine in the morning, waiting for the contact. We’re under Polyjuice, pretending to be brothers from Manchester interested in the business and Malfoy cannot stop complaining. ‘I hate this cloak, by the way. It scratches my skin. Merlin, awful. And this ugly skin! So itchy and way too big and heavy. Couldn’t the Ministry get someone better?’
We used to go here with Timothy. He always ordered the same thing. The same brand of cognac. The same meat. I loved how his… well that’s about enough.
‘So stop antagonizing me on every step, Malfoy,’ I interrupt him, ‘because I will do the same back to you. It doesn’t feel good, does it?’
Yesterday I found a musical box in the attic of Grimmauld, it just fell out of a chest in a corner under three dusty boxes. It had a strange glow around it, I cast some diagnostic spells, turned out it was cursed. So, today, I brought it to Malfoy to lift the curse so I could safely display it on my mantel.
Malfoy just pushed the small box towards her and told her to take it and leave. She did but not before she said to him, barely audible (but I was close enough)
‘No. I told him to stop contacting me. I felt guilty and disgusted about it all when I sobered up. I still feel disgusted with myself.’
A friend of Hermione from work was chatting me up, not subtle at all, but after few exchanged sentences it was clear he only wanted the Saviour (gross), so, not really being into it, I had to cut it short. Other than that, just few women, but since Ginny was there it might have been a deal breaker for everyone.
I hand it over. Even if it’s not my wand, I still feel wrong giving it to some stranger. The man extends his hand to Malfoy, who frowns down at his palm. After a moment Malfoy drops it into his hand and frowns further.
Ron asked during today’s dinner with him and Hermione. (Malfoy was busy tonight as he informed me the evening prior – after a long necking session on my armchair – I asked him what he would be doing and he said he’s going out with Pansy which led to an odd feeling in my stomach and a question why she didn’t ask me to come too anymore and he said because he asked her not to, so I only nodded because I definitely did not want to know the reason.)
‘So Zabini is okay with this? I just don’t want him to accuse me of stealing you or something,’ she asks after she finishes her wine.
‘I’m not mad,’ I answer, just a little miffed with them. Blaise extends his arm and thumps a part of my back he can reach. ‘You’re such jerks.’
It’s not like I meant to, she was just there, smiling at me, I had maybe few too many at that point and so I kissed her cause she was pretty and she was smiling at me. Ginny saw, of-fucking- course, as did several others. She was furious and I was and still am ashamed.
I went out yesterday and I definitely shouldn’t have drunk that much, I will try not to, ever again. The whole day was a trial in suffering.
'Yes, but this was a wedding. One feels a lot of different emotions at a wedding, even if not their own.'
‘We went through this, Draco,’ Astoria sighs for the hundredth time, ‘I am no law expert, but it looks to me that when you signed it you also agreed to it. So, I don’t…’
I land on my feet but my knees crumble and I fall forward on my hands. Malfoy lands next to me, I hear him yelp and I hope he broke his fucking neck.
Potter just waves his hand in front of my face like he’s dismissing me and I want to break all his bones. ‘You will survive one day. If I and everyone else can, you will too.’ He starts mounting the stairs and then turns back. ‘I will tell everyone not to hex you on sight, I think it would make Teddy sad, for whatever reason.’ I stare at him as he laughs at his absolutely unfunny joke.
We still have a lot of paperwork to do, so I didn’t even stop to breathe since we came back, but I’m going to see Teddy tonight - I bought him a plush dragon toy.
'You were lonely because I was gone so much. Who's fault is it?' He asks and I hate myself even more.
fault! I refuse to wallow in misery because some piece of shit decided to murder his own daughter. You are not some kind of god to make me feel what you think I should!' His wand rests on my cheek, I feel the tip against my skin, warm with hatred.
I was having drinks yesterday in Hogsmeade, with Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville. Not the best idea at the beginning of the week, considering there was a lot of firewhiskey but it’s been a long time since we had such a get-together. And I needed some time off away from all that Malfoy situation.
I order another beer once I finish the first one and there is something stuck to the bottom of it. A piece of paper. I turn around, facing the crowd. Malfoy must have seen it too because he’s leaning over, reading the note.
Ron sighs and nods. ‘Mione will be mad. But feel free to try, I’m exhausted. I love them but being here alone, all week, is taking it’s toll.’ He yawns and sinks deeper into the cushions.
I came by his shop right before closing. He smiled and he was wearing those green robes I hate and it’s been six days since I’ve seen him, so I pushed him against the counter, put my hands under his robes, on the warm skin of his waist (he is always so warm and my fingers are always cold) and kissed him and I managed to notice, in all the haze, that he spelled the windows dark. He pushed my jacket off and put his arms around my neck and it was all so warm and nice, and he still smelled so good if not better than usual.
‘Sure you are,’ she sighs like she always does when she’s completely unconvinced. ‘As a matter of fact, it’s going amazing. He’s very prompt and great at his job, so I can’t complain.’
‘So,’ I start because my manners just won’t allow at least an effort at conversation with my enemy, ‘how’s work, Potter?’
Harry vehemently shakes his head. “We don’t have to talk about it,” nor does he want to. He walks backwards and Malfoy makes a step towards him with a bemused face.
I wish I didn’t forget the ring at home, I can't believe I was that stupid. I won't propose without it. I need everything to be perfect, just like him.
I sigh and bite down my honest reply. Instead, I just tell her that it was quite last minute but it’s fine, it’s work, just as Potter says.
‘Then what? Will you kill me with your constant whimpering? Just shut up and don’t move and we will be fine!’ I cross my arms on my chest. ‘Who actually invited you here?’ I ask because his presence bothers me. Is he all of a sudden friends with everyone?
‘You should’ve seen him today, you wouldn’t call him that,’ Ron mumbles when he stands. They kiss hello, Hermione kisses Rose on her forehead and sits at his place, ready to feed Hugo. ‘Can you make me tea, Ron, please?’
‘Harry! Come back here! Gran says I cannot leave the kitchen until my homework is done and you promised your help even if it’s no help!’
I stay still, just kiss him until his hands grab my ass and guide me to move. I do and my arms bracket his had and we're chest to chest, cheek to cheek, his cock hard, pressed between us, mine grinding inside of him slowly. His nails drag on my back almost painfully as I thrust inside.
. He just stood there, frozen, under the streetlight, looking at me and I don’t know, we were just so close again and I saw a mole on his jaw under his ear, and that smell, it all just got to me and when I realised what I was doing I clapped him on the shoulder, said goodbye and left.
“I do,” he yawns and snuggles closer. “You haven’t fucked the memories out of my head. You were good, but not that good.”
‘I promise you Ron, the first thing I’ll do when I see her is going to make sure she isn’t planning Harry’s demise any time soon, otherwise that really would be a deal breaker.’ She takes my hand and swings it between us. ‘Bros before hoes, right?’
I don’t know what I should do. I met him Friday, yesterday and today. I like spending time with him, but is it mainly for the kissing and the other stuff? Or is it because of him?
Ron’s sad, Cannons lost – again. The game was great, I enjoyed it immensely, Ginny as well, Percy probably, he kept talking to some officials that were in the box with us. She delivered the news today – she’s apparently dating Pansy Parkinson now. Which was shocking to me but not as shocking as for Ron. She decided to tell us before the game to
The assignment went great, we ended up in a wand fight but managed to arrest two of the witches, the third one fled but we tracked her down and brought her in as well. Jonson and I celebrated with kirsch because she said it was one of their traditional drinks and the morning we were leaving I also bought a box of chocolates.
I got a debrief from Ash. There was no suspicious change of plans and the smugglers kept up their usual daily routines. We were ready and I just hoped Malfoy wouldn’t ruin it all.
Andromeda smiles and nods. ‘Yes, she did. She had a very specific idea.’ We are quiet for a moment. ‘I like her, you know?’
‘Thank you. But I am actually calling because I want to personally invite you to the celebration of my recent success.’
‘Thanks for bringing that up.’ I seriously don’t want to talk about it. I've spent enough time, already, obsessing about it.
We find it in a corner, half-hidden behind some ratty drapes. I tap the exit sign twice and the mirror pops out of the wall slightly. I take the edge and pull it off the wall completely to reveal a dimly lit, large empty room, slight shimmer on the sides.
I don’t know for how long we’re sitting there but eventually I’m calm enough to realise my leg starts cramping and I disentangle myself from her, eyes dry.
‘Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing!’ he speeds up and then turns, balance a little off near the end and I hold my breath. But he does great, straightens the broom and flies up and down.
It was 16:15pm when he announced he would be leaving, and so I said I would go too. We said goodbye, and Malfoy said to me outside
and I only wanted to make a civil conversation about what he had in the bag as one would with his childhood nemesis but Malfoy was not having it and was walking away from me before I even managed to ask anything important.
We find out it is a nightclub near the main railway station, mostly opened only during the weekends. I send Ash and Reynards to scout the area, outside and inside. They come back in the evening, reporting it is apparently pretty large area to cover. There are six aurors on the mission, so it’s decided we’ll take night shifts to monitor the building, just in case, in pairs. Tonight, it’s me and Julie and I cannot wait to leave this house and Malfoy.
‘Week or longer, Salazar knows with those idiots. But she started using the potions more, again, I just want her to have some company, even if it’s not pleasant.’
The thing is, I get it - why she wanted to break up. Sure, I was bored sometimes as well, but isn’t it a normal thing? We were together for more than three years, those things happen and I don’t think it’s a reason for a break up, is it?!!
‘Well excuse me if I want to paint as detailed picture as possible for your own benefit. But fine, I’ll speed this up. So, you started drinking, and then very loudly insulting Potter. He heard, obviously, came right in front of you and I swear, I thought he was going to punch you.’ I listen intently even though I start summoning the ingredients and try to pretend I pay minimum attention. ‘So then you dropped your want to the floor and made these cute little fists, in front of your face, hilarious! Potter threw his wand somewhere too and he was about to punch you in your pretty nose when Blaise came between you too and ended the ridiculousness, guided you to the sofa, Potter followed suit and for some reason he gave you even more alcohol.’ Here she turns to Blaise who just shrugs with ‘they were already pissed, no harm done’. Pansy continues and she enjoys this retelling way too much. ‘Eventually Blaise stood up, and there you were, just the two of you. You started talking, well, you started shouting at each other, something along the lines how you admire Potter for saving your life and how he enjoys your potions? Something like that.’
Harry shrugs, holding Malfoy’s tea and his coffee, glad the office will be quiet while she stays here. “Sure, you can.”
I feel the pain in my chest and I think I will choke on it, that this is something that will finally kill me.
The meal is a silent affair. It’s good though, at least I don’t have to listen to him anymore, hopefully for the rest of the day.
I came home and I was smelling like him. Even now, showered, in different clothes, I can still smell that stupid soap.
In other news… well nothing really. Ginny’s still gone, I’m still alone and right now I think I’m about to have some serious headache.
I grin and wrap my fingers around him. 'Better?' I breathe in his ear, feel him shiver, I kiss his jaw, chin and lift him up with me, to his hands and knees. I hold his hip with one hand and stroke him with the other.
'Nice. Oh, one more thing. I talked to Teddy. He's moving to Falmouth. Hope you'll enjoy your month of chores.'
The first thing I see when I come to work is smirking Blaise wishing me a good morning. ‘Hey. I’m going to the lab,’ I say to him because I’m almost hundred percent sure what he’s grinning about.
‘I’ll have to check where the point is,’ I answer, look around and turn my back to few people who are around and cast a spell. ‘It’s few metres this way, in this park.’
He hears Malfoy say: “Just wanted to see if Potter’s still capable of basic skills, such as writing. Lovely to see you Granger.” The door shuts closed, and Harry asks for a potion to relieve the ache that is now spreading through his whole body.
‘All of a sudden?’ Blaise asks with heavy air of sarcasm. ‘But you’ve always loved to do so, in explicit detail, might I add.’
'I hope you are joking. You know very well how it annoys me, I've told you hundreds times and you still keep doing it. How hard is it when you take them off to put them properly away?'
I see Julie, positioned at the bar on the right. Boven and Prott should also be on this floor, Reynards, Brookheard and Ash upstairs. All of us have one way Hearing Aid charm, we can listen but not actually talk to each other. Everything is prepared and I’m feeling only slightly nervous.
'I cooked, there's chicken in the oven if you want it. Then I was contemplating my life choices, took a nap and so on, you know.'
Getting Kingsley’s approval won’t be a problem, as well as all the paperwork needed. The hardest task, I think, will be to get Malfoy on board.
Once we are in the house, he closes himself in his room for the rest of the day and only walks out to drink and eat. He doesn’t speak to anyone, takes his food and goes back.
I put it in my pocket and tell Andromeda and Teddy her hellos. ‘I think I’ll go. I have to get up early tomorrow.’
‘No. I want to go outside,’ I repeat, step closer and because I’m irritated and tired as well, I rip off the blanket and throw it on the floor.
She groans and gulps down the remnants of her wine. ‘This was the worst and shortest pep talk I’ve ever heard. You both suck.’ She summons a bottle and drinks up. ‘Moving on, Blaise, what…’
When Malfoy comes back to the office, he only briefly looks Harry’s way before he sits down and continues scribbling on the parchment.
‘Grand. Make sure you’re convincing.’ He opens the door and he’s already outside when I raise my voice and say: ‘Thank you, Malfoy!’
He’s too tired to go and try tonight. He has to settle for a glass of firewhisky and most probably a quick wank.
'Oh please. Tell that to someone who would actually believe you. I can see your face, how you look at her... don't worry, I won't tell but you can not either.'
Teddy doesn’t let him finish. ‘Isn’t it just? I wanted the new Nimbus, but Draco didn’t want to buy it for me. Will you buy it for me, Harry?’ And what a gall, his hair turns black and messy.
I apparate home, dig out the ring from the bottom of my sock drawer and incendio the damn thing. I feel much better.
‘Yes thank you. We will get the check too.’ the waiter is leaving and Timothy is smirking at me. ‘Lost in your head again?’
Teddy dismounts his broom and runs towards us. ‘Yes! My favourite.’ He goes to grab the piece but Andromeda pushes the plate away. ‘Go wash your hands first.’ He frowns a bit but scurries inside the house anyway.
'I wish you'd remember and then I would help with brewing and no one else would be privy to our sex life.'
Malfoy jabs me in the back and jerks his head to the left with a roll of his eyes. I look briefly and sure enough, another couple with their bits out.
'I'm not making anyone come to my shop and buy whatever they want. People have free will, Potter, I believe even you should be familiar with the concept.'
But this one… I don’t know. I can feel it deep in my tainted heart, now beating out of my chest, like it wants to give out and kill me.
Teddy now looks confused, his brows lowering in a frown. ‘She said you are friends. Wait,’ he looks at me, all disappointed, ‘you aren’t? So no family quidditch tournament?’
She looks me up and down, very deliberately and with a smirk, then looks me in the eyes. ‘Your character progress is yet to be revealed.’
'Turn around,' I say and he does. His ass is on display, his thighs spread. I kiss him there, suck lightly, move to his cheeks and spread them, kiss him there as well, dart my tongue out into him. I know he likes it, he always complains how dirty it is, how gross I am for doing it, but when he does the same to me, all's good. Right now he just spreads his thighs wider and pushes back. I suck, lick, kiss and I love every fucking sound he makes.
‘I am.’ She withdraws her hand and looks at Ron who raises his brows. ‘I can see you guys having your inner mental dialogue about me, you know?’ I eye them. ‘I know what I’m doing. Don’t worry.’
I went to Sunday lunch in a sour mood. The charm still didn’t work as promised and I was getting seriously fed up with Malfoy.
When I come back home, I think about Ana. How my life could’ve been if she stayed here four years ago, if we would have kids of our own, a crup or a kneazle, a home and I just cannot imagine it at all.
‘I’m sorry I came without telling you first, but I was in the neighbourhood so I though I’d stop by?’
Once out of Fortescues’s, Teddy has his stracciatella in hand, eating it away happily, when I see him smiling widely and waving at someone. I look in the direction. Potter, of course.
It’s different than the first. Malfoy’s lips are warm now and tastes of mint instead of alcohol. Harry hears and feels the puffs of air on his cheek when Malfoy tilts his head to the right and devours him. Because that’s how it feels. Malfoy’s lips move softly but hard at the same time, as though he wants to move even nearer if it would be possible. He presses him into the railing next to the door and Harry catches him around the waist. Malfoy releases a small sigh and there’s a hint of a smile.
‘Yes,’ she says simply. ‘I kept refusing to agree to my parents’ schemes, but then I heard the name, Draco Malfoy, and how could I refuse?’
That is why he’s standing in a packed club, trying to get a glimpse of him.  The music is absolutely awful and the drink he’s been sipping on too. Harry can’t see him. There are, however, many people from their department. And then there is Coraline, currently trying to get to Harry through the crowd of people, all the way from the other end of the venue. He decides to flee from her sight.
’. And apparently Lynxar must be coming too, because she’s our potion expert and therefore needed in this particular operation. I don’t know the woman, she might be a real hoot and wonderful company, but she is a horrendous ‘expert’.
'Because I am willing to do it. I will do it for you if it will help. We can get a Pensieve or you can use Legilimency, I don't care.'
‘So fucking leave, I don’t care or look for it! Just do something and don’t whine here!’ I see a flash above the trees. I fly closer and there it is. All of a sudden, Malfoy is next to me, extending his arm. The idiot thinks we are still playing.
The door knob moves and then there is a sound like someone’s trying to break the door with their bodyweight and then a loud knock.
I asked about Narcissa then and I finally know that she isn’t dead but living in France with her husband – happily ever after, seems like. I asked about the peacocks and Andromeda looked at me strangely and said she didn’t know what peacocks I’m talking about. I also know that Malfoy is visiting them again this Saturday, she invited him for lunch.
Then they talk. It’s very short and they will have to have more talks about many other things, but it’s sufficient at the beginning.
‘No, I’m okay, thanks,’ I shake my head as I’m bouncing Rose on my knees. ‘How was your day?’ I ask her.
Malfoy let me in this weekend when I apparated to his gate, ready to dismantle the wards, disgruntled at 9am, saying that apparently there is nothing he can do about me.
'Yeah, maybe.' He looks through the window. 'I still haven't got the promotion.' I knew, there would be articles. 'You were right.'
Can’t say this is the best day of my life, but it’s very close. Teddy is jumping up and down, pure joy, grinning when I hand him the snitch.
'Why did you cheat on me? What did I do? Why did you do it?' He exhales and his fingers clutch the cup.
Harry’s mind is spiralling, and Malfoy’s hands are no longer on him because Harry pushed them off, apparently.
‘I like peacocks,’ I say the first that comes to my mind, ‘they have nice feathers. Which bird is your favourite, Malfoy?’
‘Exactly,’ Pansy agrees and sighs dramatically. ‘Plus, Ginny and I did have a pretty spectacular fight.’
‘No I don’t. I hate that shirt and I only wore it once, here, for her birthday party because Hermione requested I did and immediately as this was taken I spilled that Luna’s concoction she brought, do you remember? It couldn’t be speeled away?’
with a sneer – and there it was! (Shame Andromeda couldn’t see it.) I could feel he was about to apparate so I grabbed his shoulder and said
Maybe I just love the castle too much, or I don’t have an active imagination, or maybe I just don’t feel happy anywhere at any time, other than Hogwarts. That would be grim. I hope it’s the charm’s fault.
I am fully naked and, finally, he comes over. He brings his hot hands to my chest, stomach, shoulders, back, caressing. I am so feverish I want to shed my skin.
Yeah, I am a fifteen-year-old girl now, writing in her diary as soon as something memorable happens. What am I becoming, for Christ’s sake??
He has a view of his whole body now, head to toe. That fucking shirt is so tight Harry can see everything.
God damn it! And still, I don't regret it! I don't feel bad or remorseful. I made everyone a favour. It was justice, for the girl. I know it was. But
I avert my gaze and feel my face heat up a bit. ‘I didn’t choose the place. Let’s just focus on the task at hand.’
'Don't frown. You'll get more wrinkles than you already have. Besides, we have the whole evening before us. You get to touch me while dancing.'
We finished eating, I tried to talk because the silence was stifling, but his answers were short and clipped. He didn’t offer any dessert, instead he said
Immediately as he was back in his own body, he demanded I bring him lunch to his room. I ordered some takeaway for everyone and he said it was just grease on bread, so I shoved it at him and shut the door. Then he wanted tea and biscuits, then dinner, glass of water, he even demanded softer toilet paper and I’ve had just about enough for the day. The others kept giving me strange looks, but no one said anything. Except Ash who smirked with
‘Okay. Ha ha. We’re done here. Thank you so very much for all the info about possibly my most embarrassing night and now please, fuck off.’ I start hustling them away.
And he does come in and freezes when he sees us. ‘Er, I’m sorry, I’m clearly interrupting, I’ll come some other time.’
It’s five in the morning as I go down to the kitchen, still in my pajamas. I barely slept, my neck hurts and I just feel manky and tired. There are two aurors, chattering quietly, one of them pouring water into mugs.
‘Are you insane, Potter? This person must have a Ministry clearance and don’t forget…’ and so he cariies on and on and in my mind, I only think I cannot go on an undercover mission with Lynxar, no matter what Robards says.
I must admit, I wanted to cuddle – because I just like it that way after sex, I don’t want to feel cold as soon as I come and I want a little affection, is that so horrible? Well, Malfoy certainly seemed to think so, because as soon as I wrapped my arms around him after, he stiffened and said
‘Good game by the way,’ Potter says and yanks me from my thoughts, ‘even though you did have Ginny.’
We made it to some pub at Old Compton, I ordered beer, he ordered whiskey, I paid because technically I invited him. It was a bit strained at the beginning again, but after few sips his tongue loosened, and he wasn’t sneering as much.
He nods and smiles wider, switching to English. ‘Please, if you can give us your wands. For security.’
'Stop! Stop! Just...start yelling at me, hex me or punch me or anything, because this... right here is not you!'
'We had a big arrest, quite unexpected, I wasn't even supposed to be there but there were some minor complications so I had to.'
I hurry Julie out the door, should Malfoy call on me to tuck him in for the night. Fresh air will surely do me good.
‘Alright, I take it back. You know I love your company. You are the best company there is.’ I smile and she resumes her stroking.
‘I do, it’s delicious,’ I answer and smile back at him. It’s been a year we’ve been together and I feel like I know him for ages. We are perfect for each other, so similar in everything. I can’t imagine anyone better for myself. We are going to Italy in few weeks and I think it will be the best time to ask him. I didn’t tell anyone, I want it to be a surprise. I’ve got the ring already, matching his beautiful blue eyes.
'That you were so in love with me you couldn't wait to propose and even asked him to help you with the ring. Which, considering, turned out to be to my liking.'
When we finally make it to mine there is no time to waste, we strip and tumble in bed, and I stop thinking altogether.
I take his books, scattered all around the place, and throw them in the fire. And just like that, they’re gone.
'Yes, whatever. I'm way too old for this. I'll be forty by the time I'll be able to do anything of my own.'
I wanted to ask where he was going, but I bit my tongue and dressed, very calmly. He left somewhere and didn’t come back, so when I was at the door I yelled
The waiter brings the food a moment later and he can probably feel the tension because he only puts it down in front of us without a word and leaves.
‘Well, then you tell her and you’ll break up and when that happens, Draco and I will come and rescue you from your sorrow. But until then we will save all the drama and crying. Yes?’ He stands up and brings Pansy’s mug.
It’s one thing to be angry when first learning about it but go mad when being explained everything and reassured it was safe for everyone is completely different. It’s not like we are sending him to his death, which is exactly how Malfoy behaves.
She smirks behind her cup. ‘Hm, how interesting. My dear mother orders from you I believe. Can’t get enough of these rejuvenating brews of yours.’
He grabs my arm. ‘We can’t apparate from here. That woman threw wards around here as she was leaving.’
I think my eyes will fall out of my sockets when I see Pansy playing with the kids in the corner. All of them, Teddy included. They play cards of some sorts.
'Yeah?' I murmur and he pulls his legs higher and closes his eyes and my heart aches. I kiss him wherever I can reach. I release his hands and he pushes his fingers in my hair, the other palm on my back and I know it will end soon and I don't want to let go but it's inevitable.
! He came, we had sex, lied in bed after and he wasn’t immediately leaving. I was lying half on top of him, kissed his neck and stroked his hair and his breathing slowed, and he was asleep. So, I went to sleep, expecting once I would wake up, he’d be gone. But I woke up fifteen minutes ago and his back was to my chest, still sleeping.
'Well it was no different to me. It's Ginny, I will always feel something for her. She is my friend, almost a sister.'
Glass of water is pushed to his mouth. He gulps it down, grabbing it with both hands. When he finally breathes in after what feels like hours, he realises Malfoy’s palm is stroking his back. It’s nice. But Malfoy is not nice.
‘Nothing curious, just random occurrences that I was most often then not forced in,’ I huff, affronted.
‘You think you’re too good for me, Potter? Too perfect? Do you?’ he hisses at me. ‘I tell you, you are not,’ he leans closer, ‘you are not. Someone might be, but not you,’ he finishes and then burps right in my face. His eyes widen even more, he releases my shirt and covers his mouth. ‘Fuck, sorry,’ he blurts out, muffled. And then it’s like he suddenly realises who is standing in front of him, uncovers his mouth and sneers: ‘No, I’m not sorry. You had it coming, if I’d want to,’ another burp, ‘I’d throw…’ and he propels forward and achieves throwing up in the toilet. I don’t have time to react, to decide if I should stay and help him somehow or just leave or laugh at the whole ridiculousness of the situation, when there are some voices in the hallway.
I stand up and push her off my desk. ‘I know this is all very amusing to both of you, but I need to work, so if you can please leave that would be appreciated.’
His hand shakes and few sparks fly out of his wand. 'It's not my business once the item leaves the shop, it's not mine anymore once it's paid for. I am not responsible for the customer's actions.'
‘Thank you, of course! I was joking, Jesus.’ I take the last page and put it inside the official file. Malfoy is already outside so I catch up with him. ‘Did you hear me?’
When I came back to the Ministry, I conducted short investigation of my own, that led to nowhere because it turned out Malfoy was telling the truth when he said his business was licensed and approved and that he’s had it for more than a year.
'Yeah. It was a lot of goblin ass-kissing but when's there desperation there is also lack of self-esteem.'
I want to get up, get dressed and leave. I want to throw him off me and I want to kiss him and I want to leave and stay here.
she said and so I turned to her, being polite, said hello back and felt my face flame hot red. She continued with
There’s tapping on the window and a ministry owl behind it. I take the piece of parchment she’s carrying and give her some snack and water for a flight back. It’s Robards, telling me this case takes priority and to start working on it immediately. Which means right this moment. That’s not happening, so I throw it into the fire.
'You know, Potter, this is getting old,' he drawls and his voice creeps up my spine, smooth and haughty.
and I don't because it's special kind of torture for both of us. But I can tell, in few moments, I will give him what he wants, what I want too as a mean to an end. Then everything becomes harder and faster and he likes it, I like it just as much and I can't remember why we don't do this every day, every night.
I look and yes I did, although I didn’t realise it at that time, lost in my head. ‘I told you, just being civil.’
I went grocery shopping today. Cashier smiled at me, which I don’t consider flirting since it is her job and she was a woman – plus it would invalidate my theory that whatever Malfoy put me under only works on men.
‘Exactly. The add writes itself,’ she shrugs. ‘But I also liked you at Hogwarts. Lookswise, of course, your behaviour on the other hand, atrocious.’
and he looked at me and smirked and it was just too long since Friday and so I kissed him while the smirk was still on his face.
'Not immediately. Maybe in two or three years? It will recquire a lot of travelling for assignements, though. He told me it might be a bit straining.'
‘Mhm, I would like to, very much,’ he nods quickly and then barrels forward, right into me, slamming his face on my shoulder. ‘Ow, fuck,’ he murmurs and then laughs, ‘I think I broke my nose.’
I don’t know what I was thinking, honestly. We weren’t a couple, that was clear way before tonight. But I thought that he was just angry, or his pride was hurt when I said I wanted to keep it a secret for a while. I didn’t think he would go and kiss someone other than me! Okay, well, now I truly sound pathetic.
‘Yeah, I thought I would try if you like them all pure and virginal,’ she smiles while stroking me. ‘Do you, then?’
‘Let me interrupt you,’ I say, ‘but try to be quick, I really do need to start brewing and I’m not in mood for you theatrics.’
We clear the table after everyone is done and Teddy moans that he is so full and cannot possibly go upstairs yet but should rather take his broom and fly. I can see Andromeda rolls her eyes, standing next to her by the sink, drying the dishes, and she summons his school things. Teddy drops his head dramatically on the table. ‘Don’t worry, I will help you,’ Potter encourages.
'Ginny!' I yell at her and she comes to sit next to me on the couch. 'Ron doesn't believe that Canons will end up at the bottom of the league. He says they will be at least two places before last.'
‘I see none of my clothes passed. Well. Bit disappointing but I might survive.’ He walks up to me, hooks his fingers in the belt loops and yanks me forward, presses his mouth on mine. ‘You look fresh. Come, I’m making breakfast.’
Here is what happened (as much as I could observe, because I didn’t want to get too close, in case they would see me, I found a spot, a dark corner near the loos).
I didn't think I would be sitting here, waiting for him to come through the door. I would choose something more private but he insisted. So here I am, losing my shit in some generic looking coffee shop, sweating.
Malfoy was already there when I came, sitting at a table, talking to Teddy. I said hello and he surprisingly didn’t scowl, only straightened his spine and said hello back.
‘What the hell, Ginny?’ I ask a little offended. ‘I don’t keep hating on him plus I barely had time to do anything when you two barged in and…’
Harry pounds forward several times and finishes quickly, helpless. The intensity takes his breath away.
‘Is there anything you want to tell me Blaise? If yes, speak, if not, let me work.’ I move to my desk and look at the list of orders.
But when I'm back home I keep thinking about it. Is this who I'm becoming now? A guy who just sleeps with whoever, whether drunk or drugged, who doesn't care at all?
“I wish I would never have to speak with you, ever again. Tell me where it is then you can shut up.”
‘Well, I guess I could manage once a week. I’m sure you already enlisted Pansy as well, during all your whinging.’
'You prat, no. Just saying that it might be hard sometimes. For me, at least. Being away, not seeing you.'
'I killed him today,' I say in the silence, void of emotion. His eyes widen a fraction. 'I felt good, for a second. Then I felt nothing. He's dead and I don't care.'
‘You’re an arsehole,’ I tell him and taste it. Well. It’s very good but I’m definitely not telling Potter that as I start moving again.
and she bought me some pink drink called Pink Lady Cocktail – was pretty good, fruity – and invited me over to their table. Malfoy squeaked, I accepted, Malfoy’s face turned enraged, and then I excused myself to go to a loo, where I am right at this moment, writing so I won’t forget anything from the interaction and I for sure don’t want to use the DMLE’s Pensieve – those things keep records.
I linger too long, watching him. He must hear me because he turns and his expression falls. I should’ve left, I think, that’s what is expected and polite.
He changes the topic. “I’m sorry about Coraline,” he says even though he’s not sorry at all. He’s only sorry if Malfoy’s heart is broken or some such.
'Maybe. But only at the beginning. I know you much better than three years ago. You wouldn't move in with me if you were. So?'
‘Whatever. She keeps arguing about this since yesterday evening and this morning I remembered that a picture was taken of it and that you have the photo. I’m glad I have such great memory. I’m going to rub this in her face before the game. Don’t worry, I’ll bring it back to you.’
And I know I have no right. We agreed this was all it was. He made it clear he didn't want to get back together, but that
Afterwards, a bit tipsy and warm, I asked him if he wanted to come to mine. He nodded and I took his hand and apparated us to Grimmauld. We landed in the kitchen. He noticed the vase with coneflowers sitting in the middle of the table and he said
'You are making fun, but I would like to see you get stuck at one place. We both know you'd go crazy.'
I said I wouldn't come anymore, that we were done, that I was done with him, never wanting to see his face again. Yet here I am. Again.
'She wanted a break, just that. But then she never came back and I let her be, giving her time. I thought she would come back to me, like always. But she didn't... and found Zabini and forgot about me.'
He wraps his thighs around me. I touch him and feel he's still wet from when I was opening him with my tongue few moments ago. I put just one finger in and he sighs and I'm gone.
‘Blaise, you are just so right tonight!’ Pansy coos and follows with: ‘Now let’s talk about my big relationship crisis and once we are done, we can move to Blaise’s... whatever.’
‘I already told you they are useless. Why do you think I work with you? Because even if you are a git at least you are a git who delivers results. Not always the ones I would wish for, but results nonetheless.’
‘I do! I don’t know what you think is happening, Hermione, but I’m telling you, nothing changed. I still can’t stand him.’
To keep the promise – to myself – I went to the Knockturn Alley after my shift, straight to Malfoy’s shop – it’s called Curious Curses (suspicious much?) – and he had a customer so I waited inside, looking around, looking into glass displays, watching for anything that might attack or spurt some dark magic right on me. Malfoy glared immediately as I stepped in and still managed to glare between talking to his customer. When the wizard left, Malfoy barked
There are still several men sending curses at me, advancing closer. I manage to take two down with Body-Bind.
God, I should’ve never come to this party. I blame Luna for having it and coming up with this stupid idea to play this stupid game.
He cringes and leans in a bit. ‘Don’t be crass, Potter! Don’t say lover in public places, you idiot.’ He leans back and settles in his chair. ‘It’s good to learn new things.’
‘Mhm,’ she agrees and smirks at us, ‘I hope you will join, Cissy, it is so nice having you visit us.’
Stefan returns carrying a wooden box, placing it on the table in front of Jacoby. She glances at both of us as she opens the lid and turns it towards us so we can see the contents. There are three vials of pale pink-violet colour.
'And we will have to talk about the sitting room. Mrs Weasley mistook your carefully chosen tablecloth for a napkin.'
‘You’re welcome,’ she nods. ‘I wanted to see if you’d changed, I guess. I am very curious person, you must understand.’
He makes some sort of derisive sound. I look at my watch, eleven past nine. A jogger runs by and lets a piece of paper slip on the ground. I pick it up while Malfoy keeps muttering something under his pointy nose.
‘Of course, Teddy. We will make it a party, how that sounds?’ she offers and I think I will have to come up with some extraordinary excuse.
Now, of course I think: we have the contract with Zabini and Malfoy, one of them can come, depending on the contract which I only skimmed through, it might be possible. Well, I say so.
He stops short at that but resumes drinking soon after. I watch him cringe at the taste, and even his borrowed face can not completely wipe out his trademark sneer. His face is ruddy and greasy, his hair matted, falling on his hunched shoulders and his stomach is flowing over his belt. Somehow, it’s much easier talking to him in this form.
The waiter comes back and puts the drinks in front of us. Harry sips his, my hands remain under  the table, gripping at my trousers.
She approaches me but I raise my wand, just a little, in case I would really feel like hexing her. She halts. ‘Draco, I swear, Luna is the only one I told and only because she gives the best advice.’
‘Oh yeah, that. I don’t know how I could think you were almost tolerable during that dinner,’ he answers and continues eating, elbows unmoving.
There are muggles everywhere with these little papers with photographs, speaking German and offering it to me. I take them and nod, putting them in my pockets. One such woman even tries to make me step into a weird looking contraption with six wheels. I say ‘no, thank you’ and she switches to English, explaining but I say ‘no, thank you’ again until she finally lets me go with a frown and some murmur I don’t understand. In the meantime, Potter just watches us, arms crossed, smirking like an idiot.
He knocks for the third time and is seriously considering just apparating inside, the wards be damned. He finally hears some muttering behind the door when it swings open. There stands Malfoy, still in the clothes from the party. “What do you want?”
Still, I nod. In the next moment we’re gone and in another he’s pulling at my clothes, standing in his kitchen.
Harry nods even though he doesn’t enjoy it at all, and she goes on. “Come on, there is a VIP box where we can talk!”
‘What are you doing here?’ I snap at him, opening the stack. It’s very detailed analysis of the poison on our latest case.
I straddle his legs and take his hand away from his cock, lean down and lick him. I kiss along the length and then suck him in. I love how he feels in my mouth, hot and heavy and hard. I hum around him and his fingers bury in my hair, gripping tight and painful. He thrusts his hips up once, twice and I taste his release on my tongue.
'Hm. So now I will help you clean up, then, after a job well done, I'll give you your present and then I will make love to you in our bed.'
I straighten up and look at him. His face is flushed - so pretty. The lights reflecting on his skin, pink and blue and purple. He looks like a dream. Like my personal fever dream.
Malfoy is about to close the door on him, Harry knows, and so he says the first thing that comes to his mind. “I just want to have sex with you!” It’s probably way too loud, judging by Malfoy’s horrified face. “I mean,” Harry goes on in a low voice, “not just, not like let’s fuck and farewell. I didn’t want you to sleep with her, or anyone. I want to sleep with you. As in, I like you.” Harry watches Malfoy’s face go pink, bewildered, and shocked. “Merlin, that came out wrong. I don’t think anything bad about you, I don’t think that you’re some entitled prick. I think you’re a posh prat, sure, but not like you were in school. Less, you know? Jesus, just dig me a grave,” Harry finishes in an embarrassed murmur.
that I’m seeing someone. She asked who it was, how long we’re together, whether we’re serious and so on. So, I had to remind her as well to not tell anyone, that it’s new and blah blah all else.
‘Is it? Well, since you’re so interested, work’s great. How is yours?’ I guess he tries to smile but it comes out as a very weird grimace.
Fuck, I wish it was me who did it. It’s always me. I never got dumped before. Fuck. He can go fuck himself. Or fuck him, what do I care. I don’t!
“I’m having fun. I was just taking Harry to the VIP area. You should come with,” she winks at him, and her smile turns feral.
, behind a counter, arguing with some elderly woman. It turned out it was she who filed a complaint because she basically
‘We’re not,’ Blaise interrupts, ‘but honestly, you can stop fucking her for once in order to spend some quality time with us.’
Harry likes exercising. Running, weights, swimming. The best about them is that he never ever does them with Malfoy. He’s blessedly alone, able to focus.
'At least I have few seconds reprieve to chew in peace... here you are again, yes. Give him something of yours, Potter! It is your crup so feed it!'
My joints are almost packing up from how hard I’m trying to not hit him. ‘Listen,’ I say but Potter holds up his hand and sets his jaw.
‘Are you fucking kidding me!’ Malfoy screams so loud I have to cover my ears. ‘Let me out this moment, Lovegood!’
I sit on my sofa and then decide to lie down for a minute to avoid a headache I feel coming. Just a moment of peace before I must work.
‘I’m not unable to solve it but I am no potioneer, am I?’ he growls and takes a swig of his lemon water.
We stand in front of Quality Quidditch, staring for almost ten minutes at the newest Nimbus 6000k. I mean, it looks great, but for how long can a child watch one broomstick for?
I close my eyes. ‘Okay, we can talk later. Have fun,’ I tell her and then without waiting for a response floo back home.
All of a sudden, he’s right in front of me, his eyes narrowed and blazing. ‘You know what, Malfoy? You can f…’
‘So, Astoria,’ my mother interrupts our very pleasant conversation, ‘what is it that you do? I don’t think your mother mentioned?’
‘You don’t what?‘ I hear next to me and to my horror I realise I was speaking it aloud. I turn my head and see Granger.
‘Don’t you honestly regret anything in your life?’ he looks at me and taps his foot. ‘Are you so good and innocent that you can say you never did anything wrong or stupid?’
'Not okay, you are a slob and it has to stop. I am tolerating shirts, trousers and underwear on furniture but I will not put up with unpaired dirty socks in our living room!'
I don’t know to which I should react first when Blaise continues. ‘I know, thanks. So, tell us, Draco, are you in love? Is she perfect? Can I hear wedding bells?’ He fully laughs now, throwing himself next to me, sloshing a bit of his gin on his shirt.
'Don't play dumb. You are all understanding, never complain, you let me choose everything for the sitting room!'
'This close-the-door obsession of yours! And yeah, I might have mentioned something to Ron or Hermione in passing if they ask how you are because you don't go visit them with me anymore. Sorry people are noticing you acting like shit!'
‘I’m not.’ I try not to glare, but barely manage. ‘Fine, whatever you want. I’ll owe you; I don’t care.’
‘You’re serious? Harry, please,’ Ron sits down on the bed, ‘do you know who is coming if not you? Ginny somehow invited herself and Parkinson, I don’t even know how it happened but here we are and only you can save me.’
‘I thought you were supposed to make sure I wouldn’t get hurt on this trip, Potter,’ I say as soon as he is in the hearing distance.
'I know something's happening but I'm not sure what and why. Is this about moving in together? Because you said you wanted to. Did I make you do it or something?'
This morning I sent him an owl, if he was busy or if he wanted to hang out. He wrote back ten minutes ago,
Neville said, while already three drinks in, that he’s thinking of proposing to Hannah. We all encouraged him to do it, placing bets when or if that would happen, Neville was flushing the whole time, grinning, saying
‘What a compliment,’ I smirk. ‘Because it sure seems to me that you hate it every time I solve your cases for you.’
‘Potter, it’s almost midnight, come...’ Parkinson appears in the door, Ginny behind her. ‘Salazar,’ she murmurs and comes to kneel next to Malfoy who has now his head laying on the toilet seat. ‘Darling,’ she says and flushes the toilet, ‘what happened?’ She coos at him, stroking his hair. Malfoy just mumbles something and turns his head away from her. ‘Potter? What did you do to him?’
'Blaise is my friend and it's not his mistake that you two broke up like, what, one, two years ago? If you will ruin this for him, Potter...'
He grimaces and I think it might be a smile and then his eyes widen and there is pain on my chest, dull ache.
He unbuttons my jeans while I feel him getting harder in my palm. He pushes it down my ass, then my pants and starts on my t-shirt, off and on the floor, his mouth open on my neck, his palms on my ass, pushing me closer. I get rid of the rest of my clothes and his too and then I feel his chest against mine, our cocks between us.
I take out the brochure I think I saw the picture of it, I came prepared today. ‘The Victory Column. Sure.’
. So I said okay and didn’t argue, didn’t pressure her into friendship, didn’t tell her she broke my heart first.
I pass Grouse’s desk and deliver the message. ‘Denis, Robards wants to speak with you in his office.’
Yeah, I might’ve gone to another date with him. He owled today, just as I was tossing and turning in my bed, trying to fall back asleep.
The talk didn’t go as good as expected. I came to his this afternoon, we were supposed to have lunch and then go and see Miss Congeniality in cinema, some sort of re-run.
We walk to my flat I have in London. I wish I could just apparate but since he’s a muggle that wouldn’t go well. Thank god it’s not that far.
I push closer, put my head on his shoulder, smelling his neck. His hands move around my waist, to my back, pressing. I breathe him in and smile. I brush my nose along his jaw and see him swallow. I kiss him there, just a brush of lips, barely noticeable. But he notices and tilts his head. I kiss lower, his skin so hot. Then I turn my head away, close my eyes and wait. My fingers playing with the black hair at his nape.
‘So, then who are you that you can be oh, so mighty as to tell me that I’m less because I was on the wrong side?’
When he’s completely seated, he strokes Harry’s thighs, kneads the muscles briefly, licks into his mouth and flops down into the sheets.
‘Okay,’ I exhale but don’t look at him. ‘The other day I hooked up with this guy,’ I glance at him, ‘and we… had sex, as you do, and we were both pretty drunk… and he gave me some muggle pill also… and then we met for a second time, got drunk again, he took the pill again which that time I refused so he was much worse than I. We had sex that time too.’ I stop here and look at him. He’s trying really hard not to put his hands over his ears, I can tell.
'He is just a puppy. Plus he's wet. Yeah, he doesn't look the best right now, but when he's dry and clean, you should see him then.'
I went to see Malfoy yesterday and Davies and Willows were standing in front of him, asking questions. They said hello when they saw me but turned right back, questioning him. Malfoy was furious, answers clipped but polite. Willows was polite too, but Davies was just straight up rude. I interrupted them, saying I could take over. Davies was a bit reluctant but then thankfully left without too much complaining.
‘Well, fine, I hope you know better than to take it again,’ he says, ‘but then what is the problem? You had a… er, good time I presume, you know, in bed. Was he ugly, do you feel bad about your lowered standards?’ I laugh and shake my head. ‘Well what am I supposed to think then? Just tell me! I do feel slightly uncomfortable here, hearing about my best friend’s sex life.’
'Don't even, Potter. This is my cat. Where's that woman? Go and tell her I'm taking her. Come here, come here Clotilde.'
'I am trying but it's not like you can snap your fingers and everything is right again. This is hard for me, harder than I expected. To trust you again.'
I sometimes feel like someone is playing an enormous joke on me, my life. Like now, when I listen to Robards explaining why it’s essential to go to Berlin on an undercover mission to ‘
‘No matter, we can go the next day,’ I tell him. ‘Remember what we agreed, you’re at my beck and call. I understand you have to work sometimes so I am being benevolent. You’re welcome.’
I laugh out loud and she smiles, more honest than before. ‘I bet you couldn’t. Death Eater extraordinaire, hard to resist.’
And if he is while I’m gone, then fuck him. I can’t sit here for who knows how long, in this stifling room with charmed fake windows and green robes that make my eyes sore. I can’t believe I missed a date with Astoria for this! Again!
Teddy bemoans his misfortune, with a real anguish of a boy who just found out he might need to tend to his own food in the future. ‘Then I might get a house-elf or a cook,’ he shrugs and continues on eating.
It had to come from the Minister himself. I, obviously, have no say, but at least, if no one else, Kingsley listened to me. He ordered the group to be discharged immediately and he gave me a written warning, after all. It sucks, but then I did go
I stand next to the lifts, contemplating what I’m going to eat for dinner, when the metal gate opens and reveals Malfoy.
'Yeah, more or less. I thought friendlier tone and language would gauge some secrets out of you, though.'
Is it too soon to think about this? It hasn’t even been three weeks yet since we kissed. Is that enough time to have a crisis?
“Let me fuck you,” Malfoy breathed with his lips near Harry’s ear. He kisses his cheek and temple. Harry might have imagined it differently in his head, but he really wants it this way, too.
and I was hurrying back inside, finding Fleur so she could give her some food. I went to the kitchen then, where Molly fed me some more and absolutely refused my help with preparing trays of finger food.
I’m not ashamed I kissed someone, I am single. But it was her friend and I think there might be some law or something about kissing your ex’s friends.
‘Indeed,’ says Malfoy and smiles at me. It’s not a nice smile, at all. It’s sharp and it doesn’t reach his eyes, it’s… disconcerting. And yet… ‘See you, maybe, tomorrow, Potter.’ And he slams the door in my face.
Celia eventually found me, just as Victoire started crying in my arms so it was a good excuse to say
‘Wow, you’re no fun today,’ Blaise sighs and plops himself on my work table. ‘You drank a lot as we already established, Potter drank a lot also, you almost got into a fist fight with him but someone – and by that I mean me – was sober enough to intervene. Then you drank more and by midnight you were all chummy, talking. I mean, granted, you screamed at each other, but funnily enough not all of it were insults.’
I sighed, kissed his ear and he started on my flies just as I began to push his tunic (or whatever that was what he was wearing under the robes) off and I honestly thought that we were going to wank each other off (for the second time since we started this), right then and there, my pants were already pushed low, and his hand was on me, moving so slowly, there was a door opening and
‘Because you’re my partner, girlfriend, lover? Because you love me and cannot imagine your life without me?’ I look up at her and she laughs.
written in bold red letters floating above their heads. 'Happy Birthday, Harry!' she screams, 'how do you like my decorations?'
She whips her head around and sees him. ‘Harry! Thank god you’re here,’ at her words he sends a death glare towards me and I smirk, ‘can you help me with the drinks? I am a little, you know, pissed!’ She turns back at me and winks. I wink back, just to annoy Potter. ‘Oh yeah, and Malfoy’s joining us…’
‘Okay?’ he finally speaks. ‘And you are feeling bad because you took that pill? Was it … what do muggles call it… durg, drug?’ His eyes widen. ‘Did you take drugs, Harry?’
The only thing he would like to say is, how she’s not worth Malfoy’s time. He bites his tongue for a long time until he finally decides to speak up. Just then she,
We’re there for about five minutes when he speaks. ‘I did take the Mark voluntarily because I wanted to be a part of something big and amazing.’ I scoff and he glares. ‘But after, when I saw with my own eyes what was being done, I regretted it. People can regret their decisions, actions and words, Potter. I regret mine.’
‘Fine.’ He turns around, picks up his clothes from the floor and looks back at me. ‘Are you going to watch or what?’
I snort and take the floo powder from the bowl on the coffee table. ‘Oh yes. One set of robes enlaced with protective charms, shoes with no charms, a bracelet with location spell, gloves, hat and scarf with questionable odour. Give my thanks to the Ministry for a last moment delivery of subpar items.’
I don’t think I was out of line. I just wanted to start a conversation; I didn’t really want to argue. But he just brings it out in me. And it’s not my fault he can’t take the truth.
‘A consultant you say? The first I am hearing of this title. Did you just decide to bestow it upon me? Will I get a raise?’
'So you don't feel anything at all about the whole thing, you don't care an innocent child died because it was your shop that sold the earrings?' Feel something you twat! Show me that there's something good left in you! Make me hate myself less.
Malfoy waves his hand dismissively and looks out the window. “Too much fuss about nothing if you ask me. She hit you with some ancient curse, you bled a little, no big deal.” He looks back at Harry. “They saved you and now you’re finally awake. Looking awful but awake.”
I grab his shoulders and push him away, looking at his face. ‘You didn’t break anything. Now, can you stand?’ I ask and let him go, he sways and his back hits a cabinet behind him. He grumbles something and closes his eyes. ‘Okay. I think you’ll manage,’ and as I say it he grabs me by my elbow, his eyes suddenly clearer and wide and a horrible flashback assaults my mind.
We finished the drinks, left the pub in a slightly sour mood, Malfoy just nodded, walked away and I only heard a pop in the distance.
That was one of the possibilities, but I was really hoping it wouldn’t come to that when we were planning this night.
Malfoy steps out and his fingers curl in Harry’s jumper. He tugs Harry close. “I meant we should really get to the sex now, talk later.” Before Harry has any chance to respond, Malfoy kisses him for the second time that evening.
Hermione comes back holding a steaming cup. ‘I’m tired boys, I think I’m going to head upstairs. Thanks again, Harry.’
still here, lying innocently in those blue sheets, the man who allowed it to happen. The man I know, no matter how many times I will try to stop myself, I will seek and come to. Again and again and again.
'I do but I also see how the Ministry is yanking you around, I wouldn't be surprised if they'd just decided one day to keep at it and promote you in ten years.'
So, should I judge it based on past or present? Sure, we’ve spoken more than at Hogwarts so far, but does that even mean anything?
She sneaks up to Harry from behind and screams into his ear: “Harry! Thank you for coming! Are you enjoying yourself?”
‘They look good together, I think,’ I tell her and I mean it. They definitely look better together then we ever did, they both just have something otherworldly about themselves.
She looks at me apologetically, like I want to talk to her about our personal lives now. I shake my head. ‘That’s completely fine, Granger. No need to explain.’
He catches himself quickly. ‘I only wanted to make sure that the package came yesterday. The one from the Ministry?’
‘And Potter! Tell Grouse to come to my office. Oh, and bring me a cuppa if you would, Lucile is not here today. You can go.’
‘I’m sorry Ron,’ I turn my head so my voice isn’t muffled, ‘but I can’t, I need to sleep, I was awake for full forty hours and I have a feeling that not even this interesting conversation will keep me awake.’
I let myself fall on top of him, just for a moment, still panting. His arms are loose around me and I feel them slipping away slowly. I know it's my cue so I roll over and we lay side by side.
Teddy is now asleep, finally, the kid would play until the morning, I swear. Andromeda should be home soon, so I should probably tidy the toys and make the tomato stain disappear from the ceiling.
I was called to Robards’s offices and he clapped me on the shoulder and asked what I had against Malfoy. I said that not much, (I was a bit surprised I was not getting a dressing-down) and Robards asked me if I needed another auror on the case. So, then I had to explain that it was not really an official investigation but rather something that I did in my free time and so, at that point, I really expected some stern words, written warnings and so on. Robards just laughed, said we can make it into an official affair and
He didn’t say anything else, so I started speaking about the mission, and how cold Sweden is even in summer and Davies and the tent and the vase and flowers I bought and the Grimmauld and the renovation and, somehow, he was suddenly closing and we were walking and I was still talking.
I told him when he sat up. He nodded and started to put on his clothes. I went downstairs and was drinking tea when he came in and announced
I lay my hand on his neck, touching his pulse point with my thumb, pressing gently. And it does me in.
I walk in front of him. Not that I know where I’m going, but I’d rather get lost than to follow him. Yes, ten hours with Potter is basically a torture for me, but seeing as he might hate it even more, it’s worth it.
'Are you sure you want to waste it this way? You know you can do it whenever, but here, like this, we're here right now, only now.'
On Tuesday, I met Luna at Flourish and Blotts, where she hugged me and then smelled my hair and said that I should go with her and her boyfriend to Iceland to get rid of the Blibbering Humdingers and that evening I mentioned it to Malfoy, and he laughed, and I sucked him off in the hall.
Light from the window is shining directly on Malfoy. Pink and purple, making his hair glow, making it softer and warmer. His neck is long and pale, and was it always like that? He’s not wearing robes, just shirt and trousers. Harry thinks he looks handsome. Fit. Then immediately squashes the thought. There is absolutely nothing nice about Malfoy. Nothing.
‘Seven seconds is too long in your presence, Potter. How am I going to survive seven minutes with you? Merlin! At least it’s dark and I can’t see your dumb face,’ he says and jabs me in the chest. If it would be anyone else I’d think it was by accident, but since it is him – this was definitely intentional.
Pansy comes in and looks around. ‘Oh heavens, so dark in here. Is he having a meltdown yet?’ she turns to Blaise and he nods.
in his most annoying, poshest voice. I shrugged. I couldn’t tell him that I just wanted to spy on him, still.
Towards the end he demands I go harder, so I do, making him growl and writhe beneath me until I come inside him, grinding to a stop.
So, I got up, put my clothes back on, he covered himself with a sheet, turned to his side and murmured
Turned out he was right. When Jonson went to investigate, they found some potions in her basement, she was keeping under-the-counter business, banned brews.
This was what I was waiting for more than a year. And now that I can explain, I don't know how. I don't know what to say. When I think of all the reasons, they seem insufficient. How could I've done this to him?
‘Harry, I’m so sorry, I had no idea, she said she started seeing someone, but I didn’t know who,’ Hermione says while looking at Ana and Zabini in a particularly tight embrace.
I stopped by at Hermione’s office to wish her a happy birthday and, also hinting, subtly, about my predicament: ‘
‘Super! See you, Harry. I’m just going to take one last look at the Nimbus!’ He runs to the window and leaves me with Potter.
I take the two containers full of food from Andromeda, say goodbye again to them both and only a nod and murmured ‘Potter’ to Potter.
“Why? We’ve been working here for more than six years.” Harry can’t think of what Malfoy’s talking about. He can’t think of a time recently when someone would have a problem with him.
He stands up, washes the mug and walks out. ‘Come on, Malfoy, I don’t have all day,’ he says already in the hallway.
The woman, Coraline, waves at them. Malfoy leans slightly in and guides her in opposite direction, presumably to their office.
'Yeah, but only because Weasley got drunk halfway through. You bet my mother will be dead sober next Sunday.'
Potter, just as in the cathedral, has his mouth gaping until he notices looking me and closes it. He steps too close to one painting and the guard reprimands him. Potter flushes and apologizes and from there keeps his distance.
Harry stomps his feet and does the same spell Malfoy just did, the one he reluctantly showed him when Harry asked the first week as partners. The folders flutter for few seconds and then don’t do anything. Harry’s never been good at it. That, or the git lied to him.
. What the fuck? Three hundred?  No responsibility? And I am not talking about all the other nonsense regarding losing a limb or any other body parts!’
Yesterday we went out again after work, Parkinson joined us, and we went clubbing. I mean, I mostly just sat and drank, they danced. I watched them from time to time. Malfoy was popular on the dance floor, loads of people wanted to dance with him.
‘Potter, seriously, go home or whatever, I don’t need your help,’ I tell him for the tenth time when he’s shuffling the pages.
I start a slow grind with my hips. 'Good?' I whisper and he nods, biting his lip. 'How good?' I prod. I want to hear him.
‘Happy you’re so in sync today,’ I murmur when Pansy wraps her arm around my neck and I can smell cherries in her breath when she says to not be mad and laughs.
'Let's go to bed.' I murmur, I want to take him slow and comfortable, on his nice smelling sheets and soft pillows.
‘I’ll just finish and then,’ I lean closer, whisper in his here, ‘we'll go to mine and I will fuck you. Would you like that?’
‘Why did you come? You usually just send it.’ I don’t know why I try talking to him. Maybe it’s what Ginny said, or Hermione, whatever. I’m not going to try too hard anyway.
‘Not acceptable, Potter. We need a potioneer there, an undercover auror will not fool these bastards,’ Robards goes on and on.
There’s a dull pain in his chest when he wants to sit up. He groans, sinking helplessly back into the pillows. And then he has a scare of his life when he looks right and sees Malfoy sitting on a chair next to his bed, staring at Harry.
'What's up with me? Well Potter, thank you for asking, I am doing pretty well, unlike you it seems. '
It must have been in the alley, it’s the last thing he knows. Him and Malfoy duelling a witch who was smuggling muggle children to Norway, a flash of red light, and then darkness.
(which, I admit, was super weird). Malfoy laughed, said no and then looked at my hand still on his arm which I immediately dropped. He frowned, but in the end, he nodded and started walking.
Either I will continue trailing him in secret, knowing he knows, or I will trail him so he knows and sees that I’m trailing him, possibly making him mad and more prone to slipping and spilling some secrets in rage. Yeah, that sounds about right, definitely the second option.
She moves up my body, kissing my hips and stomach, my neck and finally my mouth. I stroke her everywhere I can, I grab her ass and she grinds against me.
'And I would love to fuck you, or the other way around, I don't really care. I want to get you naked and touch and kiss you everywhere. I want to suck your cock, Potter, how would you like that? I want you to suck me, too. I want to do to you everything you want, everything you tell me. Hm?'
She smiles and stands up. I do too and we shake hands. She leaves, I sit there just for a little longer.
'Merlin, I know, I'm sorry. I'm being stupid but just... I don't know. I guess I didn't expect it to be like this.'
Malfoy tilts his head and puts a finger on his chin in thought. “Hm, so if I am to shut up, I can’t tell you where it is. I’m perplexed, Potter. I don’t know what you want me to do.”
I had to take one more day off (Robards was not happy) because Parkinson drunk me under the table yesterday and I feel like digging a hole and die. It’s already evening, and I had 2 Hangover potions and still feel dizzy.
I said everything was fine. Hermione started talking about her new bill she’s trying to push through, the conversation turned to Ron then, they’re testing new dream charm in a candy – I offered to help with testing it because I could use some oblivion. It was a mistake that I literally said
‘But when I’m older this broom will be too and a newer one will come,’ he sighs and finally unsticks his hands from the glass. ‘So you’re not going to buy it for me then?’
So, when we were playing hide and seek, I noticed a picture on her fireplace, tucked behind all the others. It was Malfoy with Teddy. Malfoy looked a little stiff, sitting on the sofa and Teddy on his lap, fidgeting, playing with the dragon I gave him, trying to roar into the camera. It was a very nice picture.
I tried to visit Malfoy, just for a fun of it. He looked normal, even talked to me, but there was no usual kissing. We confirmed Saturday, he said to come to the Manor, I said okay and then he had a witch walk in, carrying a miniature window. I left and I really can’t say that I’m looking forward to this weekend.
Malfoy stands behind me. He smells like some old eggs or something and I feel a bit bad for him, thinking my guy smells slightly better.
Today I learned that his parents are in France – which I knew already but didn’t want him to know I knew -, that the peacocks fled during the time Voldemort was living there – I asked, the peacocks were not leaving my thoughts for some reason –, that he is friends with Luna, that he doesn’t like wine too much, that Zabini used to have hots for Ginny – I felt only slightly jealous –, that he likes going to muggle places and even owns muggle clothes.
I didn’t go to the shop for the whole week. No one flirted with me, so it has to mean I was right and this was Malfoy’s plan all along. To get me all obsessed with him all over again.
Harry moans his agreement and bears down slowly, just as Malfoy continues his equally slow push inside.
‘I’m talking about everything! About you being a fucking Saviour of us all! So come on,’ he leers, ‘punch me, I know you want it and no one’s here to see. I know it will make you feel good.’
‘None of your business.’ I went with Astoria the first week we started dating, complaining all the time but secretly enjoying it. She laughed and then took me to another one the next weekend. ‘We are going here. And, of course, you’re paying.’ I snatch it back and, once again, stomp away from him.
“I was talking to you for the last five minutes and the only thing you manage to do was to stare into the distance with your mouth open like a dead fish!”
‘I’m glad you do,’ I answer, a little bemused. They met just twice, as far as I know, I was present once only and it was all very cold and polite.
‘Because you’ve always been opportunistic. You lost and suddenly you just throw money on things just so people would forget. I’m not saying,’ I go on when I see he wants to cut in, ‘you are going around crucioing children, but I’m saying you changed because you had to not because you wanted to.’
Blaise snorts. ‘It’s like you think we are stupid or something. If you want to talk, you can always talk to us. Right, Pansy?’
He sneers and it turns his face even uglier than it already was. Crueller than on his own face. ‘No, but you may as well pretend to be for these several days. It is the least you can do.’
Teddy comes running inside, he notifies me that indeed, next weekend there’s another game. I don’t get a chance to say anything because everyone is coming inside, taking off their outerwear and huddling in the sitting room. Andromeda starts bringing plates with food, it seems like more children are coming from upstairs and I see mother sitting in the kitchen sipping her tea.
‘You cannot send or receive any correspondence, Mlafoy, it was clearly stated in the contract,’ Potter frowns and crosses his arms on his chest.
I roll us around, nuzzling his neck, kissing and breathing in. I grind against him, all frantic and crazy. I want to slow down but it’s impossible.
Harry curves his back and lowers himself down, making sure they’re still connected and says: “You can fuck me hard now.” Malfoy wraps his arm around his waist, kisses him, all tongue and soft lips. He bends his knees and fucks upward. Harry growls into his mouth and Malfoy does it again and again and again, and Harry loves it all.
Before he slams the door in my face, I push my arm against it. 'A child died because of you Malfoy! You want me to apologize? Then go to her mother and apologize to her first!' God, I want to punch him right in his sneering face.
“Maybe we don’t understand each other,” she steps closer. “I would like to go out with you sometime.” Her eyelashes flutter and she’s way too close for comfort.
Ron came by today, without Hermione, thank god. I don’t think I could stand her badgering me. I apologised to him, probably because Ginny is his sister. He said it was fine, that we are broken up after all and that Ginny is not mad, not really and whether I want to come to the Burrow to say bye personally.
But Potter shakes his head. ‘I’m afraid not. From what Ginny says, only on national team. So, by the time you get there, you probably will have to learn to make at least a toast, Ted.’
‘Wonderful. I see the glasses are helping,’ I smile at him, covertly trying to hide the parchment and the quill on the small desk squeezed in this suffocating space.
There’s silence, we sip our wine, the waiter clears our plates. Then she clears her throat. ‘Look, Malfoy. We will be working together very soon and I really don’t want it to be weird between us. So let’s bygones be bygones and enjoy what hopefully will be some magnificent discovering of new facts and knowledge.’
He starts walking where the woman is trying to recruit another innocent person, his steps longer than usual. When he returns he says: ‘Fifteen meters.’
Blaise raises his voice so he can’t hear me and I smirk. ‘No you weren’t! You have Pansy for that and I was only making a point.’
to the already closed door and out of spite stood there for about fifteen minutes before going home.
Party was good, not too many people, just Weasleys and my closest friends and their friends. Towards the end, when the cake was half-eaten and gifts unwrapped, Molly, of all people, played a matchmaker as she introduced me to a woman – Celia.
‘Yeah, very cool! Just hold on to the broom, Teddy!’ I scream back at him when I see he’s trying to swerve the broom with just one hand on the handle.
“Something work related?” Malfoy’s voice is scathing and even though Harry doesn’t see him he can imagine his face – mad at being ignored.
It was surprising though how strong he actually is. He manhandled me, made my lie on the bed – I have to admit it was pretty arousing and if I wasn’t hard before, that would do it. He lied on top of me, warm and solid and I opened my mouth then, saying
Malfoy leans closer and then straightens right back. ‘Looks lovely. What gave it the silver shimmer?’
‘You’re a fucking asshole,’ he curls his lip, ‘and that’s why we’re never going to be friendly or polite with each other.’
“I’ll catch up with you later,” Harry doesn’t let Ron finish and grabs his sleeve instead, to push him through the crowd. Ron doesn’t protest, at least.
'No, none of this. You will be excited and you will do the apprenticeship and you will be the best potion brewer there is.'
I don’t have to wait long for his retort. ‘You should be begging me on your knees to do this for you, Potter. You should be grovelling.’ He pauses, glares, like I should do just that, right now. ‘But since everyone just praises your golden shit whenever you manage to push it out, for me, who is even beneath your mentioned shit for you people, I know all is done and I just have to take it, don’t I?’ He doesn’t wait for my answer when he continues. ‘You owe me for this, Potter, since it was all your damn idea in the first place.’
Why am I like this? I wasn't this way back at Hogwarts, I wouldn't cry because a girl would break up with me!
He couldn’t be clearer. All sleepiness disappeared and I looked up at him, his brow was raised in question like
'Every time I did we had a fight. I am tired of it. You always want to talk and then I do and then you just push and push and push!'
I drink one glass after another after another. I want to get dead drunk. Not because I am heart broken, I am not, but because it’s Friday and I want to forget the whole week.
I saw Malfoy during my lunch break today, walking out of the Wheezes, carrying a bag. Obviously, I had to talk to him. So, I went up to him, said hello, all very polite, more than a meter between us. He frowned with
‘I bet this is about Malfoy again,’ Ron says when he sits down next to me. Rose notices and decides to change people so I let her crawl to him.
‘I’ll take loads of photos if you won’t manage to be done here on time,’ says Ginny, taking my arm and pulling me behind her. ‘So tell me, Harry, did you poison him or something?’
‘Technically you were flaunting it and I doubt she heard a lot, there are good silencing charms in my bedroom.’ She smirks and then continues: ‘I swear, Draco, I wasn’t talking about this to anyone, Blaise and Luna only. I didn’t tell anything to Ginny either, that must count for something, right?’
‘I have enough of you, Malfoy!’ I turn around as he’s standing up yet again, push him into the nearest tree and pin him with my forearm on his chest. ‘What the fuck is your problem?’
‘The wailing might have been an exaggeration,’ he admits, ‘and the breakup as well, to get you here.’ He smirks, sitting next to me, and I want to throw the whiskey right in his face.
So, I waved to Ron who was looking from the shop window waiting to have lunch with me and walked with Malfoy.
'Shut up, am not. Let's go to sleep. The party exhausted me. Every time I see the kids they get more energetic.'
‘Sod off, Malfoy. If you didn’t have a professional on the team you wouldn’t have a chance.’ He throws himself on the sofa and frowns.
… ‘Thank you for calling, Luna, I will let you know,’ I start disconnecting the call when I hear her say
'Come on. We'll be quick. I feel like I haven't touched you for ages. Always so busy with planning and work and planning.'
‘You’re the one to talk, Potter,’ I sneer because I can’t help myself. ‘You can barely stay with me until the sunrise, in most cases. So excuse
He loves the sweat glistening on Malfoy’s chest and his messy hair. He loves his hand around him. He loves the heat between them, Malfoy’s cock in his ass and when it hits the spot on every other thrust. He loves the sounds coming out of Malfoy’s throat.
I put the vase on the kitchen table. It’s pretty. Blue glass with red specks all around. I will need some flowers.
‘You look, arsehole! This is the last time I am doing anything like this. After this sham is over I am going to make Blaise to terminate the fucking contract, I don’t care what will need to be done but I am so done with this crap of yours.’
My palm ended up on his knee to stop him from leaving, he looked down and I thought I was having an aneurysm when I leaned in, kissed that stupid mole of his. He froze, I froze upon realising what I did and how intense that woody smell was on his skin, but he turned his head then and his mouth was on mine and we were kissing. It only lasted for few seconds, no tongue or anything. He leaned back and licked his lips, cleared his throat, stood up, my hand falling from his knee, said
Well, could’ve been worse, considering. I expected some shouting and curses, but Malfoy was just blankly polite and cold. I had to excuse myself halfway through the training for a meeting with Kingsley and now I am finishing documentation for Malfoy’s clearance and equipment and all else.
The woman laughs. ‘Why such rush? I like some pleasure before business.’ She waves her hand, and a man comes and sits beside her. He brings a glass up to her lips, and she drinks, her fingers moving on his thigh.
‘We work together,’ he tells me slow and loud and points to his ear, ‘try to listen, Potter, if it’s you who asked the question.’
The worst thing is, he doesn’t have the right to be jealous. Just because he developed a strange case of some insane lust fever or whatever, doesn’t mean he can now be jealous of everyone who speaks to him in flirtatious manner. Or when Malfoy so obviously reciprocates it.
‘I mean yeah, but it was harmless and it was just this once. I don’t take them at all, ever, but as I said I was pretty pissed already when he offered.’
He eventually snatches his arm free. She faces him with that permanent fucking smile, raises her fingers towards him. This woman cannot take a hint.
Harry embraces him and breathes in Malfoy’s scent, fresh and sweet. It’s everywhere, on his skin and hair, under his arms and between his thighs and Harry’s head is full of it. It’s quickly becoming his favourite smell.
‘What happened to them?’ he gestures to himself, brown hair and eyes, red in face and a bit overweight.
'I want to know the reason, I obviously don't want you to describe the whole...act.' Now I see it. The contempt, there, only for me.
‘Great you say? So why did you decide, after weeks of nothing, to engage us in your case you are apparently unable to solve?’ I ask.
“Do you want to clean yourself up?” Harry motions at Malfoy’s shirt and hair, wet and probably sticky. “I can help you with that.”
I show him and he grabs the note with his meaty fingers and pushes it away from his face, squinting. ‘Salazar, what a poor eyesight. Six days? Are you fucking kidding me? What the fuck is Berghain?’ He’s positively seething now.
The thing with Robards is, he means well but is stuck in the past and he does not like change. ‘I understand, Gawain,’ I say and he frowns even more after I use his first name, ‘that you are the Head Auror, therefore I will always follow your lead and instructions. I just don’t want the mission to fail and I don’t want you to fail if something happens. Which it will, if Lynxar will be a part of it. We will all fail. I only want you to think about it. I know you don’t like Malfoy and that’s okay, but he is much better suited for this task, regarding his current work and given his… past.’
I went to work today, loads of paperwork to catch up on, no new cases. Which suits me right now, as I am conducting my own investigation.
And then it's just like every time, hot and unbearable in its inevitable end. I hear his breathing getting harsher and more shallow, my heart beats wildly in my chest. I pretend it's just the strain of the action, sex and nothing else. I need it to be just that.
I walk towards him and without another word start taking off his clothes, his shirt first. I kiss him and he still doesn't react in any way and that's not what I want. I want him moving against me, with me, not standing there like a cold stone. I pull away and look at his face while pushing my hand in his trousers. The smallest of sounds spills from his mouth and then with: 'I really hate you sometimes' he grabs my head with his hands and starts kissing me, like he always does, hungry and soft and biting all at the same time.
Yet as I pass the kitchen, I see him standing there, naked from the waist up, whisking something and my heart jumps, hurts and then plummets.
I lie on the beach just as Timothy is getting ready to scuba dive, the instructor is checking his equipment, if it sits correctly, if there’s enough oxygen. He waves at me. I tried it with him the first day here and I have more than enough for my whole life. I felt so… pressed, so claustrophobic, so I refused to do it again. I wave back at him, sun is shining on his wet, glistening body. He looks so good, his skin went beautiful brown from the sun, whereas mine just stays as it is. I know if I wouldn’t use lotions I would be just red.
We breathe into each other's mouth, not really kissing, just there, against each other. I push my hand between us and I take him in my fist.
‘You could’ve helped him, Harry,’ says Ginny next to me. ‘Holding his hair or something.’ She rummages in the cabinet and takes out a vial, handing it to Parkinson. ‘Well, some people are lightweights. Will you stay here Pans?’
‘You are too, mate,’ Blaise smacks me bit harder this time, ‘that’s why we are still sticking together.’
She is from south of France, she’s their age, she has a cat and a crup, three siblings – two sisters and a brother, she loves cooking, chocolate, travelling, she’s been working as an auror for French Ministry for two years and jumped at the opportunity to work temporarily in England, she loves her work, she loves helping people and she hates injustice, she wanted to come and help during the war but her parents didn’t let her, she wants to go to America and do exchange there as well, she loves sea food and she can’t stop talking, ever… And all this in a matter of one week.
Jacoby smirks. ‘Wouldn’t you like to know. I guess you will have to figure it out yourself, it’s a secret recipe, after all.’
‘Thanks for the lovely offer, but I think I’ll skip.‘ I gulp down my vodka and offer a glass to her.
Teddy jumps up and lets his snitch fly away in the process. I see in my peripheral Andromeda and Narcissa turning to look at us. ‘Super! I can’t wait! Let’s see, next weekend my friend Alex and I have a sleepover but the next? Yay!’ he runs towards Andromeda and asks her if they can invite all of them to play a game.
I know she’s not moving to other side of the country, but still. It makes me sad that she’s leaving me. Well, she already left me weeks ago, but this seems... it. Like we will never get back together again.
I breathe in deeply and exhale. I can make it, we must be half in, for sure. ‘Shut up, Pansy!’ Malfoy yells back and somehow thwacks my side.
'Yeah. Still plenty of time. And I went to order the invitations and we should have them here in two days.'
Malfoy keeps thrusting. Three times and four, five times, until he stays deep, winds his arms tightly around Harry’s waist, pulling Harry to lie fully on top. Malfoy grinds inside of him and Harry can feel his release, hot and slick.
She looked angry and cold. When I saw that she saw I tried to explain but I think I only mumbled something incomprehensible and left.
I think it tastes delicious, but I can’t be sure because I also think I’m dreaming or hallucinating or I am very ill.
I breathe very slowly to calm down. I try really hard not to hit anything right now. In this case, I try really hard not to punch Malfoy.
Maybe it’s better Malfoy’s not there right now, because Harry is in a mood. Yesterday, Coraline invited him to the goodbye party she was throwing, and which Malfoy has known about for several days, apparently. She even did it in front of Malfoy. He looked mad as all hell. Harry immediately decided he wouldn’t go, to avoid the awkwardness and any further advances.
'Nice. A lot of fun, Hermione went a little wild as the evening was progressing but, considering, was to be expected I guess.'
‘Here you go, but I will limit you tonight to this one drink only.’ Pansy sits back down next to me and watches as I drink the whole thing in one go. ‘Better?’ she asks.
I smirk as Potter flounders, mumbling something unintelligible, probably trying to spare the child of the truth of our animosity.
Wednesday, I came earlier (after his stalkery comment) and went inside. He had a customer, so I was free to look my fill. I peeked into the vitrines, the displays and couldn’t really find anything odd. I even accomplished getting into the back room – when there was no one around he took my wrist and pulled me inside, we snogged until we heard the door opening and he left to service the person and I was able to investigate. There were multiple cursed artefacts, labelled and under protection spells and I wanted to take a closer look, but the person left, and he came back and I grabbed him by his neck and kissed him and we were kissing till he decided to close early. We went to the park, intentionally this time I think, we talked and kissed and then he stood up, said goodnight and left.
'No! Stop! Alright here, have it all, what do I care. Alright, Potter. I fed your animal now go buy me another sandwich!'
There are only two ways this can go, I think. Either he, for some reason, thinks he needs to tell me he found someone or he want to get back together.
“They have these small dragons at the island, and I wanted to take them all home, they were so cute. One almost managed to get inside my
I drink the last of my tea, set it back on the table and look at her. ‘And? Do you think I changed?’
‘I don’t know why it bothers you so much. The jerk cheated on you. You should be happy you didn’t actually propose.’
. I went without the cloak, the place was crowded and I had some charms over me, auror grade charms, no way in hell someone would recognise me. I went in, sat at the bar and not even in 20 minutes Malfoy was there, staring daggers into my head. He said:
‘Good idea, actually. Let’s see. So, you were stupid enough to get cursed by some ancient German curse or something, I heard. You fell, hit your big head on a table edge. I, still in the right mind, managed to take down the rest of them. Then, as I said before - because you’re stupid, almost bled out so I had to heal it first and when you weren’t waking up after some spells and slaps, I levitated you outside where the rest already awaited. And I suppose you know the rest. He finishes and crosses his arms.
‘Sure, but not when you’re wrong, darling.’ Both of her hands are scratching my scalp now and I feel tempted to forget everything. It’s so good.
No point in arguing with her. I might just finish myself off in some questionable pub or whatever it is that Pansy has in that twisted little mind of hers.
I slam it shut. I lie face down on the bed, imagining all the ways of how to make Potter’s life a miserable wreck.
‘Stop this, Draco,’ Pansy interrupts me, ‘I know where you’re going with this and it was not your fault. The fucker was a cheater and I repeat – that is not your fault, whatever the reason was, he should’ve told you upfront and break up with you,’ here the tears intensify for some reason and sobs start coming out. ‘Fuck. I’m sorry.’ She pulls me to her and hugs me, the position slightly uncomfortable.
‘Ugh! Stop it, Harry. I don’t want to hear about anyone’s sex life. But I want to help you to feel better, so I’m willing, but just this once.’
“Now Draco has his tea, and we can talk.” Her smile is saccharine and eyes glint with something weird. If Harry would be five years old, he would stomp his foot and push her away. “So, tell me, Harry, would you like to show me some bars around here?”
‘Interesting,’ mother responds and drinks her tea. In the past she would probably got a fit, but being a part of a losing side of war changes people. She did her best to unlearn the worst, but some things are still foreign to her. Like understanding why a pureblood witch would decide to work with muggles when her family’s fortune is there for the taking. So it is me who asks
, someone else can go next time, it’s not like I want to go myself – then Ginny sent me a t-shirt she packed by mistake and then decided to send it to me when she realised it was mine, so I smelled it and it was her all over it, so I threw it into the bin, took it out and washed it.
There’s a pop and Twinkle appears. ‘Missus Malfoy, lunch is almost being ready,’ she bows and pops right away.
. He frowned but nodded and stood too, we made about five steps when I said goodbye and apparated on the spot.
This is more pleasant than I expected. It was awkward at the beginning, we never interact too much, just occasional small talk whenever we manage to bump into each other during my few Ministry visits. But once we started talking – well she started talking about my research – it was easy, it was work. And now, when it nears to an end I start feeling the awkwardness again.
He spreads his legs and wraps them around Malfoy’s hips. “You’re so hot,” Harry can’t help saying in between kisses. “So fit.”
‘No, you prat. Let’s be silent.’ So we stand there, listening to our breathing and sounds of party outside. I tap my foot in the rhythm of music.
We watch each other in silence for a while. ‘I did. I don’t care if you believe me or not. I was a child and then grew up.’
I’m kind of looking forward to it. Might be strange at the beginning, but that’s to be expected – with our history...
A guy in a muggle bookstore flirted with me today. I think. Maybe he was just polite. He gave me his number, which is useless to me, since I don’t have a phone.
He never promised me anything, I never promised him anything, we never properly talked about this, I don’t even know him that well.
'Why do we talk about this again? I don't know. I didn't want it to be real so I didn't say it out loud.'
Malfoy pushes above him. “You can’t?” Harry shakes his head, still laughing. “I’ll teach you.” Then he kisses him again and Harry’s laugh dies out.
‘I am great, Hermione,’ I smile at her. ‘I know you are trying to get some emotional confession out of me, but as I told you months ago, there’s nothing to say. I wish her all the best,’ I look at them again and now they’re making out. ‘See? She seems very happy. And I am happy too,’ I look at Hermione and she chuckles.
‘Will you offer me a drink or do I have to do it myself?’ I say as I plop down on her sofa as soon as I floo over. She doesn’t skip a beat, puts down her book and goes to the bar.
I know the moment those words leave my mouth how pleased he is. ‘I don’t think this is a necessary information for you. But if indeed it is, ask Granger.’ With that he turns around and walks away, his robes swishing behind him.
'And we already discussed it and acknowledged it was just a misunderstanding, didn't we, Bono? You see? He agrees.'
I shower, using a big amount of his soap. And if I haven’t before than I definitely smell like him now.
‘I work mornings, sometimes very early mornings. Besides, you never tell me to stay, you just turn on the other side and keep on sleeping.’
. I don’t care. I know Malfoy, I know he’s doing something in that shop of his, something evil. Hermione can think he changed just because they sometimes say hello to each other and Ron can be all grown up now about it (but I know he thinks what I think, he told me himself when Hermione wasn’t around that he thinks Malfoy is a git and definitely not as clean as he appears, and he’s only afraid of Hermione so he’s not supporting me in this when she’s with us). So, they can huff and puff all they want, my investigation into Draco Malfoy’s Unsavoury Practices continues.
we were actually talking, even through the whole glowering thing, Malfoy was strangely amenable. He talked about the music box I brought, about the curse that was on it, about how if I would be smarter, I’d be able to do it myself, about the most challenging curse he’s encountered, about how he got into it - I mentioned, offhand, the vanishing cabinet must’ve been a start and he shut down, just nodded and finished his meal quite quickly afterward.
'Sure. But please, do something about those shoes. I don't want to be associated with someone in your current abominable state.'
I didn’t question anything. If this was his way of saying he wasn’t mad at me anymore, I was fine with that.
I nod. ‘I won’t write anything else.’ When he’s still standing there, glaring, I add through gritted teeth: ‘I promise.’
Harry doesn’t know if he should apologise or be quiet. He didn’t do anything but from Malfoy’s point of view, it might have seemed a lot different.
decent and possibly as a revenge he really did put some spell on me and made me all hot and bothered. Honestly, how would I even have explained this to people? To Ron? To Hermione and Weasleys? To
I don't see anything but fury in his eyes. Just as there was nothing but mild interest when I delivered the news.
‘Malfoy,’ I nod, ‘I’m just about to leave, if this is about the case, I did owl you my thanks, not under official ministry post, but still. You didn’t get it?’
I laugh because this is ridiculous. 'Yeah, I came because I wanted to feel better.' He is seething, his hands in fists. 'I want you to make me feel better.'
'I obviously cannot do anything about Bono, I guess I can vacuum more after him and Clo, because she is not innocent in this either. But I stand behind the sitting room, it's comfy and homey but you can change the curtains, they were a mistake.'
‘All right, you two. I’m going to bake the Treacle tart and I do not want to hear anything,’ she warns me, pointing at me and then at Teddy, ‘be careful!’
'No, thanks. You ruined a surprisingly pleasant evening, I'd rather sleep literally anywhere else than here.'
‘I was not feeling well,’ I finally say. ‘I blocked the floo and all owl post. I needed quiet, you do understand.’ I sit down, I hope all poise, even in my pajamas.
'Oh, Zabini wanted to levitate the chocolate from the fountain all the way to his mouth, it was ten metres away. He was pretty sloshed at that point.'
‘Hence?’ he smirks. ‘You can shower here.’ He nods towards a door and pecks me on the lips. ‘You can even borrow some of my clothes. Even though you keep insulting my style. They’re in the wardrobe, have your pick.’ He gets up, puts on some trousers and says: ‘I’ll be downstairs.’
He said he wanted to show me something, so we went upstairs, he opened a door and we walked into his bedroom.
It’s so difficult to even move, though. One, because he’s lying on me. Two, because I’m content exactly as I am.
He’s so red in the face, the veins in his neck bulging. ‘Those are just standard terms of agreement. Nothing will happen to you or anyone else, we know what we’re doing, Malfoy.’
Her lip curls, just a tiny bit. ‘You know she doesn’t like me much. You only will be away, what, a week?’
Harry also loves when Malfoy rants. He enjoyed it before because it meant Malfoy was angry and Harry liked when Malfoy got mad, especially when Harry was the reason. It was satisfying, riling him up. But now, with all this going on, he just loves what he looks like while ranting. The veins in his throat are visible, his jaw set and his eyes thunderous. His cheeks go pink, and his mouth is so enticing Harry has problems with staying still. He likes his voice, too. Still posh and haughty but it has a timber he’s not noticed before.
'Okay, you know what, I'm going to walk Bono because I'm really not in the mood for arguing right now and when you feel like talking when I come back, tell me.'
Pansy snickers also and I keep glaring at them a bit harder. ‘I do not have to explain my relationship to you.’
It probably takes only two seconds when he jerks away. He wants to play it as an accident. “I’m sorry! I thought-“ He can’t finish the sentence. He can’t think of a good excuse. Nothing. In fact, he wants to go back and kiss him some more. “Those hails hit my head!” he blurts out.
'You'll see in two days. Do you want to go take a walk with me and Bono? No? Okay, see you in an hour or so!'
‘I’m just asking. Hermione told me once I should be nicer to you, but I keep wondering why. Maybe I just need to get to know you.’ I put my elbows on the table and my head on top of my hands. ‘So, I’m trying here. Are you really this changed man everyone thinks you are?’
I came to take the box right before he was closing the shop. He muttered something about being on time but brought it from the back room. He opened it and it started playing and gold sparks were flying out from its mirror at the bottom. It was very nice. I thanked him and paid the rest of the money.
Harry would like to hex anyone who came up with the idea because now he has to watch Malfoy doing weirdly named positions, like cobra, bow, a fucking camel or whatever. And all those hand and headstands, when all of Malfoy’s muscles tighten and Harry can see them constrict with the effort.
‘Of course you don’t. But I want to help, it is my case after all and you’re doing me a favour.’ He keeps looking at the files, brows furrowed.
He wishes Malfoy had not visited him at St. Mungo’s five months ago, because he’s now officially pining.
His body relaxes after few more little thrusts, and he slumps fully on top of Malfoy. He’s still inside him, their skin sticks together with sweat, and he cannot move anymore.
‘Darling, you can always tell me about your and Astoria’s escapades. You know I do like to listen to your colourful retellings,’ Blaise stands up and pours himself another drink, ‘but you haven’t done so in some time. Is she some sort of a prude?’
I’ve been here for an hour now. Healers came and went, no news. They don’t tell me anything, because I’m not family and when I said I’m his friend they practically laughed in my face. I only overheard the information about waking him up the other day when Weasley was here, talking to the healer as I was standing behind a corner.
His exhale is almost silent when I’m all in. His grip on my hair is a bit tight and he scratches my back, but I don’t care.
‘I asked for the cherry muffin, Potter. Is that really so hard for you to follow basic instructions?’ I take the lemon bar from the paper bag and glower at him.
‘You could’ve told me she was here! Are you seriously not done with flaunting my dirty laundry in front of everyone?’ I go back to the floo.
The fresh air is harsh. I think I want to get laid. And then I think about Timothy and I want to punch something.
‘No, we’re not doing me today,’ he declines the kind offer of sharing his feelings, ‘I’d rather listen to Draco’s sexcapades.’
I try to answer but then Blaise interrupts. ‘You know you have a job, don’t you? You could’ve at least tell me you wouldn’t be coming! I had to postpone some orders, Draco, I am losing money because of you.’ He bangs the door closed and follows to the sitting room, Pansy behind him.
