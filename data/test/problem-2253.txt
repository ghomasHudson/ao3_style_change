The thought is suddenly there, clear and bright in his mind gone silent. Lucius Malfoy, humming and working in the gardens, not for prestige or appearance but because he genuinely enjoys it. He is
Potter stares at him, eyes wide and looking up at Draco, grateful beyond words. Draco doesn’t know when it happened, but Potter is laying in the snow, form prone and vulnerable, Draco standing over him tall and protective. Potter blinks, like he isn’t sure what is happening either, and then he smiles, relaxing into the snow and surrendering to Draco.
“I always win, darling. Now hurry up, I want ice cream.” Draco tugs Potter further away from the loud fans, loitering to discuss the game. Usually, Draco might be interested in joining them, really rubbing salt into the wound that is Potter’s loss, but he misses the intimacy they had when everyone was focused on the game and the world consisted of only the two of them.
Draco doesn’t intend to give him that chance, so he quickly redirects the conversation: “Tell me about this new hell. Where are we?”
“Don’t apologise!” Harry immediately falls silent, more out of shock than compliance with Draco’s — pretty harsh, he didn’t mean to be so austere — but Draco will take it, before Harry does more than glare in indignation and he lost his chance. “You don’t have to apologise, I mean. You did nothing wrong, I —”
“You mean if you were a giant sap preaching about the war teaching us our similarities and needing to build new bridges?” Pansy smirks at him, leaning forward like a shark smelling blood.
Potter needn't have worried; the way Pansy talks about these two, she would be willing to commit at least as many felonies as Potter should something happen to them. She would look better doing it too, if you take her word on that, though Draco personally always found something magnificent in Potter’s anger.
Potter looks remarkably like himself. The mane is a different colour but not drastically different from his usual hair. His eyes would give him away in any form. Potter looks soft, for a lion, fur covering his face and beckoning to be touched and petted, to be held. Potter is a lion, yes, but it’s not as off-putting as Draco thought it should be.
Did Potter conjure up another monster? Surely not, he promised!
“Besides, the house isn’t in such a state that a stint in some shoddy tent would be preferable. We’ll be done soon enough, there is no need to flee.” Draco goes back to his own food, the conversation declared ended. Harry won’t let him get out of this quite so easily, he really is sick of their living situation.
what it sounds like and has been banned for being inhumane. But that isn’t the worst thing, do you want to know the absolute worst thing? Those are all
Very specifically Malfoy too, no longer a blank placeholder until Harry found the right person.
However, there is one sort of letter Draco never wrote. Pride forbid it, wouldn’t let him get the words out even if he might have needed to.
Draco hopes this isn’t what it looks like.
Yours,
Malfoy,
Draco, so he claims, would leave himself, too.
Harry doesn’t bother with subtlety this time, snapping their attention back to what they are supposed to do with a rushed flick of his wand. Next time they might as well stay in the wizarding world, if they can’t have an uninterrupted talk anyway.
“And there was the wistful sigh! That means I won, Blaise.” Theo rips Draco out of his melancholy, snapping his mind back to the familiar and well-trodden banter between his friends.
hard. Certainly not hard enough not hide it from Potter, who steps on his foot in revenge.)
“I want to bring Pansy,” Draco says, and watches in delight as Potter’s face falls. This is not how Potter had planned the discussion to go.
was the one being unreasonable.
, knows what he needs to look into later and what requirements he needs to check, but Harry stands and lifts him off his feet, twirls him through the air and laughs and Draco forgets all about the list as he shrieks, clinging to Harry and trying hard not to let show how much he is enjoying this.
Draco is still scared, still unsure and hiding, but his hand is forced by the ancient laws of marriage. It doesn’t matter anymore what he wants, he is being pushed through the glass and can only hope that Potter will be there to catch him.
bit.)
I can’t. He stands too far away, too unfamiliar.
That settles it then, Harry wants children, wants them sooner rather than later, and Malfoy will have to answer a few questions.
They say you don’t appreciate things until you lose them. Harry, having lost plenty of good things before he had time to cherish them, always found himself inclined to agree. It’s true, people take the most astonishing things for granted; it’s only fair to raise their awareness before they go through the inevitable pain of losing them and learning the lesson for themselves. However, Harry never would have considered his deal with Malfoy to be counted among those good things.
as such, he kind of walks off, but he asks Draco back and that’s enough hints for Draco to know he is meant to follow. It’s definitely more clues than he had before, when he kept showing up on nothing but a few smiles and the assumption that Potter would have said something if he wanted him gone.
“Potter, are you—” Draco isn’t sure where this question would have gone were it not for Weasley, finally catching up with them.
Malfoy is crying now, tiny tears of stuffed emotions, and Harry gently wipes them away, cupping his face even as Malfoy nods.
“What are you implying, Malfoy?” Potter growls at him, his expression so hopelessly overdone that Draco almost laughs and ends their game too soon.
“It was a metaphor. I want you to meet my mother, I want you to exist out there, in that wonderful, fascinating, infuriating world you saved. Because, if I’m honest, it’s none of these things without you. It’s a dull thing, Potter, to live without you. I don’t want to do it anymore, so I think we should both go back to life.” Draco holds Potter’s hand, holds his eyes, hopes that even just a smidge of the things he is feeling comes through in his words. He has nothing but himself to convince Potter, nothing but his earnest plea.
Because he is sitting next to Potter, right.
—and Potter laughs.
“Oh, of course.” For one moment, he looks like he contemplates just drum rolling himself. Draco hates to admit this, but he actually wants to know now, he really doesn’t need the added anticipation artificially induced by a rhetorical device as simplistic as a
There is flour everywhere, which Draco expected. After it fell onto him and then
He doesn’t want things to return to what they were, doesn’t want them to be what they are right now, and doesn’t know what to do about any of it. One thing he knows, however, is that he
stupid. Which,
There is a scream, a wet ripping noise, then silence.
"Say, Potter, how many courses will there be?" Draco isn't certain he wants an answer. Suffering this won't be easier by knowing exactly how many more courses are waiting. Potter is definitely the kind of bastard that would make Draco eat a terrible 12 course dinner, and he is more than self-sacrificing enough to subject himself to the torment, if that is what it takes. There is no elegant way for Draco to bow out as long as Potter is eating the food as well.
Harry where to interrupt and not immediately lose his head for doing so, what would he have said? That yes, it’s all totally unfair and the world should bow down and kiss Draco's feet? He doesn’t believe that. He also doesn’t believe in the grand conspiracy against anyone not ‘Potter approved’, which is a term Draco threw around like Harry was supposed to know what he meant. He didn’t, but he also didn’t ask. He does have his suspicions, and he would think that a marriage is the best seal of approval one can get (as long as no one pokes and looks too closely and sees all the strings attached, that is) but there was no use discussing the intricacies of possibly imagined paranoid politics, not while Draco was still ranting.
This time, Harry doesn’t smile.
It doesn’t, of course, Draco sits securely enough straddling Harry’s hips, looking smug and obnoxiously pleased with himself as he grants Harry a respite to catch his breath. Big mistake, giving Harry room to think. Because really, now that Harry can see clearly again, this is fairly simple. Harry smirks up at Draco, watches in satisfaction as he frowns in confusion and uses that momentum to flip them over.
“Well, since
The point is, Draco has Potter all for himself and he relishes in it.
"Boys, please, attention back to me." Harry has no idea how long they made ridiculous faces (clearly he was winning) when Hermione interrupts them. She cleared up her papers, all neatly stacked and the books closed. She has come to her final judgement, and Harry better listen to her.
“That is for disappearing just when ‘Mione finally made it up the stairs—do you know how difficult that is for a horse?” Weasley, that is definitely Weasley speaking from somewhere above where Draco splutters earth and grime. He is, as usual, enjoying Draco’s plight and bewilderment too much.
Who would have thought their Saviour has a thing for praise?
“I’m only going to say this once and then I will pretend this conversation never happened, understood?” Ron is lucky Harry can’t speak — or maybe he experienced stuff like this often enough to know better than lifting the spell too soon — and all Harry can do is nod again and feel like a scolded child. Weird comparison considering what he is being scolded for, but Harry quickly moves on from that thought.
There is no time to wonder about whether that was wise, no time to fear what he might have caused and how all of this could go terribly wrong, how even the minds of the sweetest people—which Potter
“Yes, Malfoy?” Potter says, because he is a prick and doesn’t care that Draco is trying to protect his fragile ego here.
“Fine, I’ll get Parkinson that date, but she better not hurt them because I swear to whatever scares you the most, Malfoy, if she hurts them —” Potter trails off, out of words or aware that he doesn’t need impressively worded threats to make himself intimidating. He has quite the fearsome glower — only to be expected after the hell he went through, Draco supposes, one picks up certain things when being hailed as the first defender against evil — green eyes narrowed at Draco and something dark lurking in them, something that says clearly that his friends are not to be touched. That Draco would sorely regret it should he hurt them.
There is also some rational part of his mind that points out that they could just as easily stand
Next, Harry steps behind Draco, mindful to look calm and in control and like he knows exactly what he is doing, slings his arms around him, and prays to whoever is listening that he saw enough movies (enough
“Of course I am fond of Pandas, I'm not blind! You will also have to apologise to
hear, but Draco decided to approach this whole first name thing very gently, so gently that it might not be happening at all until it feels so familiar, it sounds ridiculous that they ever should have done anything else. It will help with their friendship, Draco is sure.)
Harry often wondered where Hermione would draw the line in this whole house-and-marriage thing. Never would he have guessed that it’s bodily harm.
Shame, Harry, too, would like to escape this conversation (no matter how amused Narcissa seems, Harry has a hard time believing she is actually comfortable discussing her son's sex life, even in unsubtle allusions), and tackling Draco onto the couch seems by far like the most entertaining way to achieve that.
The door is surprisingly easy to open (Grimmauld conveying this is the ideal moment for Harry to swoop in and save the git?) and Harry can hear Malfoy’s hysterically screeched whispers. Harry wishes he had thought to bring something to record this, asked Ron for the right charm, perhaps. Too late now, he will have to take in every detail to remember later.
Why isn’t he touching Potter? Why is he kneeling here, like a bloody imbecile, when he could have that glorious cock in his hand?
“I promise I will write you the most glowing review! I’d sing an ode to your talents, if only you’d let me.” Draco doesn’t let his smile waver, nudges the tea closer towards Potter.
never got threatened!” Potter points at Draco like this is all his fault—which Draco supposes it kind of is—and rounds the desk, coming up to Draco to poke his accusing finger into his chest.
Draco gapes at him. That was uncalled for and just wrong.
It’s not the truth, far from it, but it’s better this way. They already started, they might as well go all the way now. Before Draco never gathers the courage to initiate anything again and they are forever stuck. No, this will be how Draco planned, gritting his teeth and thinking of something pleasant, no profound epiphanies about humanities oldest secret and no cowardly retreat. Draco prepared himself for this, from the moment he first learnt about the consummation. He can do this.
“Do I detect a hint of bitterness at the lack of courting?” Theo adds, because he is an insufferable pain and likes hearing he was right. Which he
— how is he still not able to say it?
, but Weasley doesn’t need him to verbalise any of this.
“It’s not going well, no,” Draco tells the table, his forehead firmly resting there after his last drink made the world spin loudly. It didn’t get kinder, though, and Draco didn’t want to see that. So, table. It’s a very reliable friend, much better than Pansy, who pokes him in the shoulder with her sharply manicured fingers, testing to see if he’s still breathing. (As if he would just die like this, miserable and unceremoniously, without leaving instructions for his eulogy to Blaise.)
“You can’t just name my fiddle.” Potter stares at him like Draco is nine kinds of crazy, which is really not fair.
“But you aren’t like Dudley at all, are you?” Harry suddenly speaks up again and Draco, who was sure Harry wouldn’t say anything more and lost himself in Harry’s breathing and taking apart what he already said, startles as both are broken up by Harry’s question. “You care about your friends as people and not just in terms of what they can do for you. Yeah, you were a mean little shit, but let’s be honest, we all were. This room, it’s stuffed full with so many things, Draco, I don’t think you even realise. My mind immediately went to Dudley, to the two rooms he had to cram his stuff into and forget about.
Draco reaches out for him, tangles his fingers into his mane and pulls. He hopes it doesn’t hurt, pulling a lion up by only a few hairs, but he doesn’t reach anything else after scaring him off and he needs to get closer, needs to hold Potter to convince him he is safe.

taking care of Potter’s hair. He would sit the man down with strict instructions not to touch anything, not the brushes and certainly not the hair. Potter could talk, keep himself busy and Draco entertained, and Draco would work a brush through his hair until it would be smooth and shiny. It would take hours, Draco is sure, but there is little else he can imagine more pleasurable than spending them up there with Potter.
Draco forgot, lying awake in Pansy’s guest room and thinking of how to best escape this mess; he forgot how important Harry became in this house, in his life.
Yes, now that Blaise says it, that sounds about right. People don’t get kidnapped for marriage anymore, it’s gone a bit out of fashion. Draco supposes that’s a good thing,
Seriously, Draco knows what the most vicious people in their country—family, most of them, a dubious legacy—can do with a
Potter grumbles but follows easily, allowing Draco to drag him away.
Draco doesn’t watch their flirting as he goes in hunt of the button. He doesn’t like this, a feeling that isn’t helped by how comfortable Weasley is here. After all, he enjoyed the forest too, once Draco dealt with the wolves and they found Potter, after he was turned into a candlestick. Was that a movie reference, too?
What he finds is disappointing. Most notably: it’s more of the bland, grey walls, constructing a large room, mostly empty. There is no extreme temperature and no attack jumping at them.
“Great, now that we are all up, let’s get up a bit further.” Weasley speaks louder than necessary, blundering into their moment and breaking the tension that build between them. Draco is grateful; this isn’t the place and he is
Harry comes back with — is that
Potter raises the cover and presents — shapeless blobs of dull-coloured food. Draco has no idea what that was supposed to be, dismal and drooping, a mockery of the promised outcome. He suddenly seriously doubts Potter’s cooking abilities. But why would Potter cook himself if he can't even manage appetisers?
, perhaps, but he did recognise Draco, and that is the only thing he can say to defend himself.
“I would strongly advise you against addressing another
Potter is an arse, constantly seeking to make Draco miserable so that he leaves and Potter can legally demand Grimmauld after their divorce, Draco has no plans of making it this easy for him. Potter will have to try harder if he wants to get rid of Draco. In the meantime, can anyone blame him for using the most obvious weapon at his disposal to defend himself?
It’s easy enough to focus on other things when Harry kneels down beside them, reaching to take Darlington out of Draco’s arms but settling for patting his head when Draco instinctively pulls him away. He might be overreacting here, but Harry almost blew the animal to smithereens mere moments ago— surely, he can’t be blamed for being cautious.
Somewhere in his lecture, Potter pushed himself into standing, looming over Draco and blocking out the light. He is glaring down at Draco, intent on scaring him into looking away from his problems.
Intend on making Ron proud, Harry descends on Draco for his revenge.
That … is quite the leap. Draco won’t pretend he understands the thought process here — he doesn’t understand how Pansy thinks half of the time, if he is honest — but it’s so ridiculous and unexpected, that Draco breaks out laughing. It’s Pansy’s mischievous smirk, the idea of Potter’s befuddlement at being presented with a penguin and the tension that hasn’t left Draco since the first moment that he became aware of the beasts in his house — it all builds up to the wave of relief clashing over him in form of some dearly needed laughter. It’s been too long since he laughed like this, half frantic and befuddled as it is.
, and Draco can snuggle closer and enjoy the show.
Harry might have realised all of this before.
Harry scowls at her, which earns him more flying popcorn. This time, however, Harry is prepared and easily catches them all with his mouth, making a big show out of happily munching her food.

Actually, don’t answer that.

“Fine then, if the only way to help him is for you to get into his mind, we’ll allow it.” Granger nods, the deal sealed.
As loath as Draco was to give up his name, it's all worth it to see the sheer and undiluted horror bloom on Potter’s face. Something in Draco is cackling maniacally at the sight.
“I want your hands off me!” Draco struggles in Harry’s grip, barely manages to move at all against Harry’s strength.
secrets. Draco searched
Little good as it did as an argument, they all already know each other. Draco was right in that, and he was right in worrying about the impression he left, too. He might not have outright admitted to that, but Harry isn’t stupid; he can read between the lines. Draco's shame was practically screaming. Harry didn’t know what to say to that (he still doesn’t know, what

“Down here, your highness,” Weasley calls, close enough that Draco should be able to see him.
clearly isn’t good enough.” Potter rips his hand away, throwing it in the air instead.
at Draco, which, in turn, leaves Draco blushing and speechless, and then he is out of the door, leaving Draco no choice but to follow.
Draco doesn’t know what demons hold Potter small, lost somewhere in his head, but he doesn’t like them. He doesn’t like this Potter, who barely protests Draco taking up space in his home and who walks through the world blind. Inert, that’s what he is and Draco hates it.
“My, Malfoy—I had no idea! Right here?” Potter clutches at his throat, looking scandalised but also like he truly does consider going to his knees, practically unprompted, and be indecent in public. Draco thinks he might have discovered something there, something that will require more thorough thought later.
, things never seem to be easy for them, but they might have stood a chance. Draco would have needed to tell Harry then, when they were calmer and more awake. They still would have fought — it’s too big a break in what Harry thought to not fight over — but fights don’t necessarily have to be bad. They could have had a
“Hey, stop there for a moment. Do you seriously think you are
“Because he will be busy flirting with his new husband, who hates his guts and has no idea that Draco harbours some kind of affectionate maelstrom for him. Does that sound about right, Pansy?” Theo always manages to make Draco think he is the kindest of them all, but it's moments like this when he reminds them that he is not actually an even-tempered and well-mannered bookworm, but in fact a snake as devious as the rest of them. Of course he is, he would hardly have survived going to school with them if he wasn’t.
Draco didn’t mean to
Yeah, the smart thing would be to leave Malfoy to it, let him figure it out on his own and do him the courtesy of not mentioning it. A tactful veil of silence is by far the safest option.
“I have to say, I’m surprised by how easily you accepted my proposal. I seem to remember you putting up a lot more resistance when the Prophet wanted to tell the story of your miraculous participation in the Triwizard Tournament.” Draco smirks slightly, not enough to be inappropriate in the situation but certainly there, something to remind Potter that he doesn’t trust Draco, especially not with his life-story.

Potter is
“What exactly are we eating?” Harry asks, smiling faintly amused and reminding Draco that actually, it’s not all good.
Malfoy blinks up at him, expression unreadable, but he doesn't pull away again and he slowly but surely starts relaxing. That’s better, Harry think somewhat numbly, most of his attention focused on Malfoy’s hand weaving once again through his hair, quietening the storm raging in Harry.
Draco very much doubts that. Not that he doesn’t think Potter dedicated, it’s just that it’s a common problem these days and Draco heard a few things unfit for prudish Gryffindor ears.
to be here, and Harry didn’t protest (much), and things couldn’t be further from weird.
, not really, but Draco remembers the pink dress and how it seemed made for Potter and mourns that. He mourns the potential he knows Potter didn’t get to use because he clings to these movies and their pasty princesses, takes what they are wearing when he could have such glorious colours.
Harry takes his coffee (does he know there are other ways than dark and bitter? Surely he must!), the mug once again filled to the brim with coffee barely drinkable.
“Slander! How dare you besmirch my reputation!” Draco might have spilt some of his own tea in indignation, but Potter laughs and doesn’t care about the floor and Draco is certainly not going to point it out.
like it’s a proper name—they almost forgot about the game. Considering who they are here to see, Draco almost wishes he hadn’t reminded them. Well, at least Potter looks better in orange than Weasley does (though Draco is still very embarrassed to be seen with someone so enthusiastically rooting for the losing team).
and over Potter’s juvenile prank no less.
. You were bored with that, used to this miraculous, wonderful new world I somehow stumbled into. You belonged in ways I feared I never would. I wanted to know what you were talking about, wanted to say something clever and funny. I wanted you to like me, because no one ever liked me before but everything seemed possible in that stranger adventure. Then you insulted Hagrid and I didn’t like you anymore, because Hagrid was brilliant and kind and he made me cake and rescued me. You discarded him without ever having talked to with him.” Harry trails off again, the words filled with old hurt, scarred and never properly healed, but he doesn’t let go of Draco. He doesn't push him away or condemn him for mistake he made as a child, and Draco forces himself to focus on his actions instead of Harry's voice, tainted with disgust and disconcerting detachment as it is.
“Ha! See, it does make sense to keep the couch! We need somewhere to sit, Draco, keeping it is stuffed so full of sense it’s close to bursting.” Harry’s hands mimic what Draco assumes to be an explosion, the wide grin on his face at odds with the tragedy he is acting out. It’s all very endearing and distracting from the argument they are having. Draco scowls at him and his stupid nonsense point.
Reading that broke Harry's heart a bit, and he forced himself to read it thrice to make sure he understood correctly. There was no turning it, though; Draco hates what he is. Worse, he hates it because he thinks
influence that made this room a proper kitchen. (One might argue that plants do not a kitchen make, but Draco respectfully disagrees.) The plants are everywhere, covering every surface it’s safe for them to be on, thriving and growing high, colours going well together and complementing each other.
Draco quickly learnt to discern the nutters from those who have genuine stories to tell. Potter, strangely, doesn’t fall into either of these categories. He doesn’t have anything substantial, just an owl in flight, but he also truly believes in what he is saying, in an entirely sane, if slightly feverish, manner. Whatever the case, Potter needs to understand that the world is no longer out to kill him.
“Okay, first off, don’t you dare say anything against my friends. I can call them useless, you can’t.” Weasley nods, conceding the point and Draco goes on: “This isn’t about my friends, anyway. I’m here to ask about Potter.”
There is a fire going, crackling near by and warming him. He is sitting upright, relaxed into—an armchair? Is that where he is? Did Potter dream them up some charmingly quaint cabin for Draco to recover in? That is strangely considerate of him, to pause his quest for salvation for Draco to recover.
Now he had his own heart broken and would like a bit of these elusive human compassion for himself, if you please.
How could Draco ever deny this man anything?
“See, it will be fine. Just do as the book—that means me—tells you to and we can make the best biscuits this world has ever seen. No one needs to be traumatised!” Potter grins at him, laughs as Draco, as predicted, doesn’t reach the flour and upends the whole packet onto his head and Draco, coughing up flour and seeing Potter through a hazy veil of flour, thinks that he’ll try.
Potter scrunches his face up into a grimace but nods, as if he expected that. Then he motions for Draco to go on, because he doesn’t like planning their domestic bliss any more than Draco does. Right, so much for the expected, uncomplicated bit.
It doesn’t matter how he feels though, because it prompts an answer out of Harry.
“It’s really not.” Draco tries for more gentleness this time, tries to make his voice comforting, but if Potter’s expression is anything to go by he didn’t hide his disdain well. Or at all, possibly. (It
“Well, yes, a bit. I know you… learnt some things about yourself and that you are still struggling with it all — I honestly don’t understand half of it. And that is okay! I don’t have to understand it all to respect your boundaries, you don’t need to justify anything! But I still didn’t understand it, and then I find you looking at porn, and I thought that changed everything I had just figured out, but it doesn’t, does it? It’s perfectly normal, everyone does it, why would I freak out over that? I
hunting down in that giant family vault of yours, and he wouldn’t notice if you wrote him a bloody ballad—you two are hopelessly blind or we’d be celebrating an anniversary here.” Ron, for the first time in his very passionate rant, takes a breath. “You are fine, mate, your husband will be here any second.”
p.s.: Artemis is a stupid name for an owl, she doesn’t look like a goddess of the hunt.
arrogance, at least) or a superiority-complex, but insecurity. Draco is lost, he doesn’t know what to do or how to fit in, so he compensates with confidence. Overcompensates, really, so that he doesn’t end up suave and charismatic but entitled and bratty.
The odds aren’t kind to him, skewed decidedly against his favour, but Harry has beaten worse than this. It’s all a question of attitude, the state of mind deciding over what you project yourself to be. Harry is determined, he knows what he is doing, and he has nothing to lose. He will turn this afternoon tea into the most impressive courting and wooing the world has ever witnessed, and he will win his husband back.
Granger, too, can’t quite believe that he’s said that and raises an eyebrow at him. Draco suddenly understands what Harry meant when he said that Granger had them all whipped, needing only a single expression to get them to do their homework or readjust their priorities in a fashion that seemed more fitting to Granger.
“You want to do
Dear Potter,
The moment feels surreal, leaning on Malfoy for support and not questioning his sanity for it, the most normal thing in the world. That must be the reason Harry told him about Sirius; little as it is, it’s enough for Malfoy to figure out a whole lot of unpleasant history and loss. Harry is sure he’ll regret it later, but right now he feels overwhelmed and alone, desperate enough to take comfort wherever he can find it.
they go back in.
to know any of this—but Draco has to tell them anyway, speak the words to make them real.
(There is also the issue of Draco being painstakingly aware of how close Harry is, obviously wishing for the wall to part to grant him sanctuary. Harry deliberately doesn't think about that.)
Except that that isn’t true. Draco
“That’s enough!” Draco loudly interrupts him, causing a minor scene with several heads turned towards their table in various levels of subtly. “No one is courting anyone.”
Malfoy,
. Malfoy is going to regret bringing that up.
The words are rushed and garbled together, barely audible over the surging of his blood. Draco can’t decide what to hope for, that Potter understood and he doesn’t have to repeat himself or that Potter
“Potter insisted that Grimmauld isn’t treating him with the due respect — he is right, it’s hilarious — and came up with the crazy idea of tricking the house into thinking we are in love. In theory that would afford him the luxury of warm water. It’s a ridiculous plan, sure to fail, but while Potter makes an idiot out of himself instead of simply
“I feel mocked, Potter, and used.” There is more, the pain and the cold realisation the he might have been wrong about Potter, about
Something moves again, and Harry swivels them around, wand arching through the air and the spell almost cast, magic high and potent around them, his entire force bundled and focused on —
It shouldn’t, but the knowledges comes as something of a revelation. Harry didn’t expect any of that when Draco stormed off, especially not when he brought up renovating the living room next. Knowing Draco is so insistent on those traditions because he doesn’t know how to exist outside of them, well, Harry feels like this is the moment where he should say something. Something comforting and brave, something that will inspire Draco and show him that there are other ways to live, that he can find his way off the paths of inane tradition, that there are other well-trodden paths and even more unexplored vastness than he can imagine.
(He doesn’t look half bad, for a Weasley.)
of all the things Potter said and did today, but his heart feels like breaking.
(This is why he needs the wall, for this exact reason.)
“My place is fine,” he grumbles, glaring into his tea and tense where he sits. Right, Draco could have been a bit softer on that revelation.
“Weasley!” Weasley looks wary at the enthusiasm in Draco’s greeting, but Draco doesn’t pay him any mind. “What the hell is going on here? Are we about to be attacked and drowned?”
answer, time to move on.
anyone in here. No one except Harry.
, he better not forget this moment when Pansy inevitably remembers why they are here and starts hounding Draco again. He could use an ally.
Draco slings an arm around Potter’s waist to pull him down, into his lap and onto his eye-level, a plan either stupid or brilliant.
“Don’t forget that, Granger. I can be your worst nightmare.”
“I hurt him, Ron. I hurt him badly.” Ron makes a protesting noise, ready to once again interrupt Harry and tell him to focus on the facts, not his assumptions of what they mean. But Harry doesn’t have to assume, he knows exactly what happened, knows exactly what he did to Draco. “Please, Ron, just let me talk. You can say it all when I’m done.”
Potter doesn’t spare Draco more than a glance but he makes a big show out of picking an apple anyway, considers them from all angles and holds them against the light; anything, as long as he doesn’t have to think about what’s going on in Potter’s mind.
Well, Draco didn’t get to where he is by being cautious (no, he did that by being annoying and writing scathing commentary the people can laugh at) so he accepts the challenge, throwing himself full force on the unsuspecting lamp.
“How do I fix it?” That's the only thing he should concentrate on, not the various implications and murky thoughts calling to him from the depth of his brooding mind. He can’t change the past (he
Draco stomps on his foot again, reminding him that he still hasn’t answered, and it's getting suspicious. Harry had better come up with something convincing, too; letting Narcissa know that Draco lied about the state of their relationship is simply not an option.
“It’s a
to—to recognise his voice. He melts back into the chair, safe and at peace now that he knows Potter is here with him, that he didn’t leave.
“Well, if you are sure.” Draco shrugs, like he doesn’t care either way.
Draco understands, he really does, but he also sees the goal in a way that Potter doesn’t anymore. Potter has given up, has stretched his short break into early retirement and build himself a place of delusive simplicity. Draco would have been tempted to join him;he has felt exactly like Potter does often enough to know the tempting allure of misery, but this is no space to stay.
Draco talks as though he’s in a trance, no inflection or emotions in his voice. It’s chilling and not at all what Harry was expecting.
Potter sets his tea down in front of him, apologises for having neither sugar nor milk, and seats himself opposite of Draco, cradling his own tea.
Furious, Harry jumps out of bed and grabs his glasses (tapping through the house blind like a mole will do him no favours), cursing at the house when his feet land on the cold floor and then he marches out of his room. He refuses to be treated like this any longer. Grimmauld wants him to freeze his arse off? Fine, but Harry will make damn sure that Malfoy won’t get free passes anymore.
In thanks for his rescue, Weasley spits water at him. Draco makes sure to look unimpressed, even as the water drips down his face and he worries that Weasley managed to mess up his hair.
have been surprised, because this is no place for spite, tumbling through horror after horror just to prove that they could. This is about what Draco said, about their future and that damnable hope, beating in Draco’s chest and making him feel charitable, willing to hear Potter out.
Draco pushes himself to stand up, looking through the room to ground himself back into the real world, out of Potter’s mind.
Perhaps it was Potter, sparing him from the fire and making him incombustible. Perhaps it was luck and Draco stood far enough away.
“Hello Potter.” Draco smiles at him like he isn’t clutching at his door for dear life, like it hasn’t been several weeks and an ugly fight since they last saw each other, like he isn’t suddenly terrified he misread Potter’s letter and he wasn’t invited after all.
“You are talking about Potter’s Weasley and Granger!” Blaise finally says, triumph written over his face. Draco doesn’t point out that they are
He has to be joking, right? He
“But I don’t want another hero, do you understand? I wanted you, only you, and so I saved you and I brought you here.” This, this is Potter’s point and Draco tries to wrap his mind around

the man, Potter can’t do anything much worse than that. (What is he going to do, insist they have a honeymoon after all?)
Potter nods, almost eager now that he has his promise. He pulls at his hair, once, twice, and the ties come loose, falling off the chair and around Draco. It doesn’t make sense, no secret mechanism that Potter could have planned at while strapping Draco in, but Draco isn’t going to question the workings of his freedom. This is Potter’s mind, anything that happens here is because he wants it to, not because it makes any sort of sense.
Draco groans aloud. Why won’t she let him read the letter?
“Not really the point I was trying to make here.” Harry smiles at him, his entire face softened by the quirk of his lips, and Draco can’t remember the last time Harry smiled like that, honest and free and unburdened by what Draco refused to discuss.
The poor man is screwed and he doesn’t even know yet. Harry could almost pity him. Almost.

“Did you find out anything useful about that ward or did you just want to look important?” Harry asks, quickly changing the subject and latching on to the new problem to obsess over. Anything is better than to keep leering at Malfoy.
“I can’t sleep,” Potter says, and it’s so utterly
He doesn’t want to do that. He doesn’t like failure, for one, but he also doesn’t want to lose Potter. He thought they shared something, something real even if it’s dressed up with monsters and swords. Draco thought they had something worth preserving, something that could exist outside of the paradises Potter built, and he doesn’t want to abandon that before they had a chance to try and make it work.
“Can’t I have come by to visit an old friend?” Draco asks, leaning closer and smiling his most charming smile. Potter snorts, whether he doesn’t buy the motivation or the old-friend-bit isn’t clear, but it’s fair enough in both cases. “Alright, fine. Straight to business then, no time for pleasantries. Aren’t you going to offer me tea, at least?”
“Should I be worried, Malfoy?” Potter asks, mostly likely joking, going by his hand still resting warm and heavy in Draco’s. He sits up too, though, watching Draco closely and sitting even closer.
Regardless, Draco isn’t too content with his current situation — his father absent and dedicating most of his time to the Manor gardens, all of his mother’s expectations for his life, the house, their future weighing down on him, a marriage he never could have dreamed of but certainly never wanted, not with all the ties attached to marrying someone binding him down — and he has never been good enough of a liar to pretend for the sake of his friends. They are fiercely protective and, if it would make anything better, Draco would have been long since widowed under mysterious circumstances, or at the very least divorced.
“Unexpected, is that the best you can come up with?” How insulting. Not that Draco has any aspirations in that direction, but he should certainly hope that he would do better than
How would he have known that Harry lied, that he didn’t follow, that he never had any plans to follow?
Harry feels a little bad about his hasty escape. Malfoy is the one trapped in the cold rest of the house now and he will soon come to understand why Harry thought coming here acceptable.
“I need some air, Potter.” Draco sounds feeble to his own ears, weak and fluttering and on the verge of being overwhelmed.
those are? — so that their pelts can be stolen and the animals discarded after losing the only thing of worth.” Weasley is looking a bit pale there, staring at Pansy in shock and numbly letting himself be poked when Pansy makes an especially gruesome point. Draco knows all too well how he feels, he has had enough talks like this to last him a lifetime, Pansy stripping away his wilful ignorance argument by argument.
What’s even more unsettling than the thought of his mother possessing some photo albums to proudly display and humiliate Draco with, is the realisation that apparently Harry and his mother are on a first name basis? And no one saw fit to warn him? Draco shudders to think how they got there, what they could possibly have to discuss that wouldn’t be mortifying to Draco if he knew. There are some things Draco never wants to know (not many, but some).
“I made you coffee, by the way. I don’t think you like tea?” Draco doesn’t look up from the bag, still unpacking evermore of the breakfast Harry hunted.

“Don’t be ridiculous. Is that what this is about? Do you not want my friends to come over so you plan on buying an aggressively small couch?” Harry looks vaguely insulted, not sure yet if it’s warranted but prepared for it anyway. Draco is mostly confused.
Draco is wrong. Draco has doubts about the truth of his words. The spells are convoluted, more than they get credit for before some wide-eyed filly tries their luck and ends up leaving deep dents in a mind they care for. There is no way Weasley knows what he is talking about.
“What did she mean,

his hand held by you. Do you understand that?” Draco nods, because Blaise is still right even though Draco likes it even less now.
Seriously, it’s almost scary how competent he is. There are general plans and specific plans for each room, a binder on the history of the place and how decorations were back then and a completely different binder of what Harry guesses is Malfoy Manor and wherever Draco’s mother grew up. They are analysed and commented and connected to detailed information about that architectural style and the decor, all of it colour coded for how much his mother appreciates it. The Binder of Aspirations and Inspirations is something Harry has only ever seen from the outside, but he reckons it’s heavy enough to commit a murder with. Harry would rather not know the well-structured madness that awaits him inside.
“I can’t help it! It’s not like I’m doing it on purpose or anything; I’m not

it to have been different, even knowing how it ended.
“Still okay?” Draco asks, because he might die if Potter changes his mind now, but Draco needs to check. Potter is breathing heavily and looks almost wild and if tomorrow, his mind clear and without pressure, he realises that he didn’t want this but saw no way of telling Draco—well, that would be worse.
Instead he just had to be a gloomy brat, moping because life isn’t perfect. Well done, Malfoy, destroyed the mood spectacularly.
“We all know you suck at chess.” Theo smirks at him, leaning back in his chair and sipping his drink like it’s expensive whiskey instead of child-friendly dandelion juice.
It's unfairly tempting. Draco wants to wreck him.
Stupid as it was, it’s also brilliant. Draco is weak, yes, but everyone already knew that. He can’t help but bask in the warm sound of Potter’s surprised laughter. Potter sits warm and heavy on Draco’s lap, hand resting against his chest where he caught himself when Draco pulled him down.
reason. Well, he has a thousand and one reason, but none of them that would hold up if you lack a basic understanding for human emotions and decency which, clearly, Malfoy does indeed lack. That much for gaining ground. “Because that wasn’t a real proposal! I didn’t mean it, I … I proposed with deceitful intentions! That means it can’t be taken seriously, doesn't it?”
. Ron has been loyal and wary and thus been appointed to check the contract for anything Harry should better not sign. Ron confessed to knowing a lot about that sort of thing, mumbling about big families and there being scandals at least once a month. At the time Harry thought it was nice, that Ron could still surprise him after being friends for so long. Now, Harry isn't as fond of surprises anymore.
Things were good, weren’t they? Draco thought he had understood what Potter wanted, what he
“I think there has been a misunderstanding here, something that could have been easily avoided if you would respect the boundaries of politeness and privacy or even bothered to ask a few essential questions before jumping to conclusions, Weasley.” Weasley practically

in turn never subjected his hair to—friendly banter, insults exchanged with a sincere smile in the spirit of mutual fondness. Safety.
Draco can admit it’s scary. Weasley fought a war, same as all of them, and evidently his time following Potter taught him different skills than Draco learnt trying to survive in what used to be his home. Weasley doesn’t need to say the words for Draco to be absolutely sure that he would
, of course, Draco never planned any weddings.
Ron, smug and fearless, drinks again. No choking this time, which only makes him look more smug. Harry sticks his tongue out at him, because he is mature like that. Ron laughs and cuts a grimace right back, because he has six siblings and knows the drill, and because, out of the three of them, Hermione is the only one who could pass as mature and responsible. Well, Harry refuses to let Ron win. The game is on, there are more important things than composure.
“We didn’t go back because I was better at it than you,” Potter grumbles into the table. Draco is so ecstatic over any sign of life that the words themselves don’t even register in his triumphant shout.
Weasley mutters something, probably a rejection of her claims, but he speaks too low for Draco to hear. Draco id grateful; he did
“You are not Pansy.” Astute observation; Draco’s seldom felt this stupid.
Draco remembers the so-called couch Potter is referring to, a moth-eaten, horrid thing, covered in paisley and faded colours that once must have been vibrant (that one might be a blessing, come to think of it). Draco would sooner claw out his own eyes than ever look at that atrocity again.
make a good friend? Don’t tell me it’s the hair, please, because I have neither the complexion to pull off that trademark Weasley ginger nor the patience to deal with Granger’s—admittedly very lovely—curls.” Vaguely, Draco is aware that becoming Potter’s friend wasn’t what he set out to do. (He would have approached that differently, would have gently ensnared and charmed until Potter wouldn’t know what hit him when finally, Draco asked him—okay, no, Draco is thinking of dating Potter, sorry about that.)
“Are you trying to poison me, Potter?” he asks, in what is apparently a fit of reckless daring. Or the pathetic urge to make Potter feel better, which Draco won’t examine further (it works, anyway, Potter forgets his failed attempt at food to glare at Draco).
“Malfoy! Did you see that?” Potter gestures at something on the field, something Draco didn’t see because he was looking at Potter, and then Potter turns his head to look at him.

and Draco doesn’t know how to tell him that it’s many things, but
Ultimately, Draco always reminds him of that, one way or another.
“This is a prime spot to find a monster lurking, something for you to fight; perhaps even a Damsel in Distress for you to rescue.” Weasley winks, slow and exaggerated. “I’d advise you follow the river, see what you find.”
That one shouldn’t feel like a victory, not even a hollow one. Harry is a good person, he truly lives up to the picturesque hero saving cats that the papers like to cite (when they aren’t busy tearing him to shreds for daring to water the lawn in his pyjamas, that is). Harry is

There are two kinds of people in these stories, the scumbags that don’t care, and those who listen, those who heard the hitch in their voice and saw the hesitation in their eyes — yep, Harry reads too much trashy romance.
thing to do,” Harry scoffs, feeling smug and blissfully unaware of how accurate his sarcasm is.
At least Potter is dedicated to the role of loving trophy husband who stays home to cook and clean and — well, whatever you do when you organise your entire life around pleasing others. Draco always thought it sounded dreadful, a fate he wouldn’t wish on anyone. He has to admit though, Potter looks good playing the part. He seems honestly excited about his dish and, if he didn’t spent years of his youth and education watching and interpreting every minute detail about the man, Draco never would have known that Potter is shouting insults at him in his head. Good thing Potter is rubbish at Legilimency, Draco doesn’t relish the thought of needing to shield constantly around him. It’s ridiculous and sentimental, but Draco never wanted that kind of marriage.
He wonders if it would have changed things, had he realised that sooner. Perhaps he would have been able to bear Harry’s touch with more ease if he’d had sentiment to cling to? But then, what good is sentiment in desperate situations? Sentiment is a hollow shell, a pretty ornament that you can worry about once you moved all the rest out of the way — it doesn’t make anything easier. It might just be the opposite; sentiment makes things worse. It’s complicated and messy and demands personal investment. That’s why people stay in bad relationships, even when they are fully aware it’s bad and know that the sensible thing would be to cut all ties. No, if Draco had realised how desperately in love he was with Harry, things would have been worse.

If Draco brings just one, however, one of them to horrify Potter and show him that it will take more to intimidate Draco … that might work.

There is a lot of wood, for one. That doesn’t have to be a bad thing, if it’s properly taken care of. This kitchen has not been taken care of, not even half-heartedly. It’s dark and heavy, oppressing, too much empty space while being crowded by these huge cabinets crouching on the walls. The cabinet Potter pulls their cups out of is more empty than filled—Draco would bet a good portion of his money of their being at least one cabinet here with no content at all—and the cups themselves are plain and inoffensive, standard issue. There is a window without curtains, looking out into a withering garden, probably the inner yard of the building complex.
That means it’s his to clean up, as well,
Mind racing as Draco searches for options—jumping over the man; using his moment of pain and distraction to walk over him, stepping on his head first and viciously to smash it against the roof; fiddle for his wand and … do some magic?—Draco stands petrified, watching in slow dawning horror as the man stands back up, growing impossibly larger in his fury.

should have tried to reassure Malfoy that he doesn’t have to leave, that he is the kind of pretentious bastards who has a bed big enough for half an army and they could easily share without doing so much as breathe the same air, but, well, too late for regrets. Besides, it’s not his fault Malfoy decided to be weird about this. They could have shared this bed, strictly platonic like people who might, in the muddy darkness, be called

Oh no, this isn’t good. If Draco realises what this means, namely that Harry is extremely ticklish, then — Draco smirks at him, sharp and dangerous, and Harry has about half a second for the dawning horror before Draco is on him again, cruelly digging his fingers into Harry’s sides and grinning like a madman as Harry shrieks.
They have lost track of how many times Blaise has defied Pansy for reasons not deemed good enough — he regretted it every single time, Pansy’s revenge schemes getting more elaborate and more personalised with every spin they take. Actually, Draco wouldn’t be surprised if it turned out it was Pansy who cursed Blaise with his bad luck in bets, the gambling skills an unplanned side effect. Blaise and Pansy take some weird enjoyment out of baiting each other — something Draco never fully understood, because he might have similar habits with Harry (there he is again,

“I know it sounds like a very simple thing, to write a letter—” Blaise shushes him with a finger on his lips.
“I think it does, yeah.” Potter smirks at him, smug and satisfied and dizzy. Draco wants to see him like that every day.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter. First of all, I will be busy directing you because we both know you don’t stand a chance at creating something pleasant, even after I already picked the furniture for you. Second, and more importantly, you can’t
“I really want to kiss you,” Potter says while Draco is caught thinking of him with dirt on his clothes and hands, Draco himself surreptitiously watching him work, hiding behind French windows and holding a long-forgotten cup of tea as pretence. Yeah, Draco would really like to kiss him, too, dirt and all.
Draco envies them so much that he feels he should be green with it, ugly and bitter as he covets their happiness. He hopes Potter leaves them here, gives them this moment Draco can’t give the two of them.
“Here, that should help,” Potter whispers and Draco wants to lie, wants to tell him not to be arrogant and that Potter isn’t a miracle cure, but then Potter lays something soft and cool onto his forehead, something that curves against him and covers his eyes and quietens the entire world and Draco is proven wrong: Potter

save the world, even died for it, that show-off—but Draco doesn’t appreciate those curled lips directed at
Harry doesn’t answer.
“I like my food with a little more salt, that’s all,” Harry says, his tone reassuring and almost believable. Too bad for him that Draco knows for a fact that he is lying, because these past weeks it has been Harry who did all their cooking. If Harry had a particular fondness for salt, Draco would have noticed. Still, it’s kind of him to pretend it’s not Draco’s fault he can’t eat the food.
Draco looks up at Harry, still frowning and lost in thought, and stretches his arms out for him, making a grabbing motion with his hands to convey what longstanding tradition apparently didn’t.
“Well, I don’t enjoy
Harry can’t fault him. If he were an onlooker on the situation, if he wasn’t the one being left, he would have advised Draco to do the same. Draco deserves better than Harry, someone who pays attention and isn’t too scared to face what they see. (Perhaps Harry would have advised him thus even fully aware he is the husband about to be left.)
Draco doesn’t think he likes what Blaise is saying. Blaise is
So yes, Draco suffered in the war and then he suffered more in the aftermath, because people like to feel superior, which is easiest done by putting others down. Draco should know, under his father’s stern tutelage he had perfected the skill into an art form at the tender age of seven.
“Shall we move this to the bedroom, then? No more kissing though, I’ll have to insist on that,” Draco says and smiles, ignoring everything in him screaming to call Blaise (because he is not a child, he is a grown and married man and he does
“Alright then, I’ll take you to our flat, and we’ll see from there.” Ron doesn’t usually narrate everything he does. Harry supposes that is for his benefit, something to fill the silence and give him something to think about that isn’t what kept him shut in here for — a week? Has it been a week? Harry still doesn’t know; he still doesn’t care, though, so that's fine.
Luna, too, isn’t here when she would be invaluable. Luna has a strange dislike for movies and the TV and rarely joins them. She tried explaining it to Harry once, but it sounded remarkably like old people warning the uncouth youth about their eyes going square and their brains turning to mush and Harry tuned her out on instinct before he fully realised what he was doing. He didn’t ask again.
Ron isn’t impressed with his glaring, content to enjoy the silence and ignore Harry’s gesticulating. It’s situations like this that really show Ron grew up with siblings.
A brief expression of triumph flickers over Harry’s face, but before Draco has any chance to properly savour that expression, Capt'n is shoved between him and Harry, obscuring his view. Draco admits to being somewhat disappointed to lose the front row seat to Harry’s emotions like that. But he also rather does like knowing his dragon is safe and not being either squashed by them or laying abandoned on the floor.
“Harry, could you explain why we are in a scene of ‘Beauty and the Beast’?” Granger asks, tone short and looking less for an explanation and more for the reassurance that they won’t be here much longer.
“What, what did you think I would do, Draco?” Harry needs to hear him say it, now that he already knows. One last fatal blow, a mercy.
think of that?” Draco would throw his hands up into the air if he had the freedom to do so. He doesn’t, though, which is infuriating, and forces him to rely on tone and expression alone to convey his exasperation. “How do you propose I do that, if it’s that easy?”

“Of course, the unexpected hero of the hour: Draco Malfoy!” Millicent raises a mocking toast in his direction, downing her juice like it’s mead. If she sat any closer, Draco would have spit into her drink (yes, he is

“You will be fine, Draco. You only agreed to dinner, nothing more. All you have to do is sit there and eat — a recipe of my mother’s third husband, so you know it’s good — and then you politely bid Potter goodnight and leave. If you should need anything — I mean it, absolutely anything at all — we are all just a floo call away. You'll be fine.” With Blaise standing here, squeezing his shoulders to steady him and eyes blazing with conviction. Draco almost believes him.
Mr. Black, Harry can’t be sure who of them he meant, now that they both officially adopted the Black name. Not his first choice, giving up the name of his parents, but Harry already feared he would have to take
friends. Draco goes back down, away from Pansy’s scowl and Blaise’s disappointment, away from Theo’s problems that might, objectively, be worse than Draco’s.
Dear Potter,
“I want to, I desperately want to, okay?” Draco finally manages to pin Potter’s wrists down against the armchair, shouts the words in Potter’s angry grimace of a face.
So there you have it, that is their ridiculous plan, reduced to its bare essentials. They are doomed, aren’t they?
“This is cruel, Potter,” he says, though he doesn’t think it will help. “You could have said you aren’t done playing damsel yet. You could have told me that you want to be saved more, that you didn’t have enough of them yet. But this? Not only is it essentially the same thing you promised not to do anymore but it also completely ignores everything we talked about concerning our relationship. I thought you understood why we can’t kiss, I thought you agreed to wait until we both felt comfortable.”
“Done! What does the winner get?” Vaguely Harry is aware that he might have just signed his fate away, but competition — especially when Malfoy is involved — always sends a unique thrill through him. He has no regrets, not even when Malfoy looks as if he had already won.
It’s not a difficult task, not all that many things that Potter could have meant, but Draco’s brain is slow in accepting the obvious answer. Potter wants to do it again, and again and again after that, whenever the mood strikes him. He found a way to make it part of their agreement, make it something
. You were good, yes, but I was good, too.”
“Is this your attempt at giving me therapy and apologies again? Because I already told you that I don't need therapy, and that it’s fine.” Draco glares at the parchment handed him with the vague instruction to ‘write a letter.’
Draco tears himself away from Potter’s eyes, landing on Potter’s freckles sprinkled over his face, which isn’t any better than his eyes actually and how is Potter so attractive, when did that happen?
Dear Potter,
and whoever possessed Draco’s brain for that exceptionally stupid thought, he would like them to stay far away from him.)
“That’s all the romance you got, Potter?” Draco challenges, because he is stupid and over-heated and Potter looks up at him like he is hoping Draco will say yes. Draco can’t take this.

road (again).
, Weasley said. Is there a hidden message here? A secret meaning Draco has to decode? Perhaps not every word counts, perhaps the meaning needs to be assembled out of this sentence. Draco needs to find the coda, needs to break this down and build it up from scratch.
“You look like you never saw a room bigger than a broom closet before.” Infused with exactly the right amount of taunting and arrogance, the words snap Harry out of his thoughts.
“Oh, I'm sorry! I thought you said — but I can put them back —” Harry moves to set Capt'n back into her rightful place. If Draco needed any further proof that Capt'n is in good hands with Harry, this readiness to comply with Draco’s wishes would have been it.
“I want out of here, Potter,” Draco says, thinking of Potter in his bed, both of them allowed to touch and kiss and do all kinds of delightfully filthy things Draco doesn’t dare thinking of.
“She did not,” Draco protests, albeit weakly. He stands by what he said, Athebyne is a lovely and kind owl, but Potter has never been a great liar; for him to talk of Athebyne’s dark sides so convincingly, there must be something there. “What would a grumpy owl even look like?”
“Besides your giant crush on your husband, you mean,” Ginny suggest, voice saccharine and smirk firmly in place.
Don’t pout; I apologised, didn’t I?
"Hilarious, Malfoy. We are all marvelling at your brilliant sense of humour. Now get out of my house." Again, the wrong thing to say, Harry is absolutely sure. But snapping at Malfoy is an ingrained reflex and the git practically asked for it anyway. Was Harry supposed to just … not?
“She does this thing where she kind of glares at me? She looks down at me and her ears do that cat thing again, like she is judging me.” Right, Draco doesn’t believe this. Potter is describing an owl here, a perfectly normal owl. Potter, sensing Draco is going to discard this, quickly pushes on: “Sometimes she looks like she wants to eat my soul! Her eyes are all wide and glowing and her ears stand up high and I
“I assumed it’s a Muggle thing.” Draco didn’t mean to, but Granger sobers at the words, her expression almost sneering if she hadn’t been laughing until so very recently.
There are absolutely no security measures on this castle, and not only because all the guards are asleep. In fact,
Or, perhaps he had a bad dream. They all have nightmares — it's only logical that Draco has them, too. And, now he is disoriented and talking nonsense. That is most definitely what is happening here. It has to be, because if it isn't… if it

to hire him, that was disconcertingly easy, which ultimately reflects on their low moral standards and the plebeian vindication of making a Malfoy do their coffee runs. That would become part of the difficult beginning. Turns out, living in what used to be your home with people that have never heard of personal hygiene and wouldn’t mind driving you to a slow, agonising death is a different kind of toxic environment than working closely cooped up in an office with people salivating over your fall from grace, whetting their teeth for the next juicy bit of story that will destroy you.
“Yes, yes, it’s

Draco rounds the corners, doesn’t think about the people, and takes every staircase he finds, making his way up and higher.
Because Harry deserves better, something more personal.
It means wiping out that smile as he reminds Potter of what he doesn’t want to think about. Ironic, how you need to face some things in order to escape from them.
And then Draco is unceremoniously shoved back onto the couch, their momentary bond against their cruel oppressor over and done with as Blaise passes by them to make some noise in the kitchen. Problems aren't discussed on an empty stomach.
It all comes back to it being the truth, and the truth hurts simply because that is what the truth does. It doesn't get easier when shared.
bad) and Harry immediately feels bad. There is no way around it, though, he
Harry told the truth, of course, he saw no reason to lie or hide anything since no one was meant to read it, ever, but the truth can be much more embarrassing than the most elaborate lie.
“For Salazar’s sake, keep up Blaise! It’s not about actions, it’s about what he
“Well, if you indeed read the letter, Parkinson,” Hermione’s tone strongly implies that she thinks Parkinson did
This is exactly what Harry hoped to avoid; yet another stand-off between Hermione and Grimmauld. But Hermione is on a mission now and Harry isn't crazy enough to try and stop her. All he can do is stay, pray that Ron arrives soon with the food and fancy plates, and do as Hermione said. It's not too bad, really.
that you are going to have dinner with Malfoy?” Ron asks not a second after slamming open the kitchen door, making Harry flinch and cut himself on the knife he was inspecting. “And
“Weasley,” Draco hisses, not taking his eyes of Potter getting his life squeezed out of his body. “Weasley, what is going on?”
Doesn't Harry deserve some quiet to sleep? He saved the world; doesn't that grant him anything? Don't the memories rob enough of his sleep?
“That was the plan, you moron. I don’t know what you thought to do to that poor knife but it looked dangerous. I seem to remember you promising to stay out off the kitchen after you nearly burned down our place as you tried to make breakfast, until midway through you remembered that you hate cooking and don’t want to do it anymore.” That is a fair point, unfortunately. Harry
“Moody beasts? Surely you don’t mean Archibald!” Draco, with great satisfaction, watches Potter choke. “We get along famously, Archibald and me.”
“There is a button.” Granger nods towards the console. Weasley makes a betrayed noise, a very dramatic gasp and clutching at his chest.
, Draco supposes there is nothing he can do.
Knowing that Potter expects a fight—and for Draco to win—puts a different kind of pressure onto him. Dying is easy, compared to winning the battle against enemies dark and imposing. Draco doesn’t even have a sword!
“Well, have you talked to them?” Draco is relentless, spoon feeding Harry the realisation he just decided he doesn’t want to have. Harry wishes Draco would shut up, that he stayed in the living room, inappropriately cosy with Parkinson. But the question is asked, and whether Harry voices it out loud or not, the answer is ringing in his mind just as clear.
behaviour. It implies an intimacy that might or might not be exaggerated, one that Draco is very fond of.)
, you may kiss your husband now.” Malfoy looks pleased with himself for all but a moment, before something else flatters over his face and his eyes land on Harry because — oh, because
Black, Weasley. I’m afraid I have to insist that you show the proper respect.” Right, Harry almost managed to forget about Malfoy (Black now, Harry supposed, Draco Black, but that feels wrong and is bound to get confusing). His chances at happiness dissolve in front of his eyes, crushed under Malfoy's heel.
Draco had hoped that consummating their marriage would mean he gets rid of Potter. Grimmauld would see the traditions satisfied, Potter as Draco’s equal, and the tense silence of them both sitting in the same room and wishing to be far away would finally come to an end. Potter would avoid him just like Draco would avoid Potter, they would have their weekly dinners to keep up appearance and they could both move on with their lives. A perfectly normal marriage, as agreed.
Apparently their prodigy can cook as well as kill bad guys and snark at people, which is just great. Potter cooking for him today means Draco has to cook for him as well, or risk being accused of not meeting their deal and trying to sneak out of his responsibility. Potter would make fun of him without mercy and Draco would never be allowed to forget about it.
Manners, huh? Where were those manners when you badgered me every day in my shop? Isn’t that worse than poor form in a letter?
“Okay, this is what’s going to happen now.” Ron sits down on the chair next to Harry, both of them looking out into the living room. Harry was afraid Ron was going to sit opposite him, force dreaded eye contact as he expresses his disappointment in Harry. But Ron doesn't.
Potter
“You have put a lot of work into this friendship with Potter: you brought him flowers and tea and entered his shop with a smile. You tried to gently push him towards talking to his friends and even
, Draco is more than content to remain here, at a safe distance and close to the nearest escape route.
Ron nods at him, all the endorsement he is going to give. That’s fine, Harry doesn’t need more, he just needs to know that Ron will listen as he confesses his sins.
Harry doesn’t need to see Draco to know that he is smirking, pleased with himself and aiming to impress. And impress he did, Harry’s brilliant, devious husband.
Draco will tell her anyway, even though she has wild misconceptions about what she asked for.
Perhaps there isn’t enough friendship to serve as a solid foundation of love and concern required to make this sort of influence, in the very least understandable. Perhaps Draco is insecure and trying to impress Harry while he considers Pansy his sister in all but blood, which means she is intimately familiar with all Draco is, insecurities and impressive abilities included. Perhaps there is nothing more to it than Harry being
Draco catches himself on his forearms a mere moment before he would have crashed into Harry, who is full on laughing at him now. Smug bastard, Draco would like to see him do better than that. The beanbag is obviously treacherous and holds a grudge against Draco because … because it’s been too long since he was here and sat in it! Yes, that is the story Draco is going with.
First to consider are Ron and Hermione, who Harry is going to blame for pretty much everything happening here today.
Now there is no Potter to focus on, all of him given to the broken instrument on his table, and Draco has all these memories, remembers his fingers aching from the strings and his arms protesting the very thought of being lifted again, that satisfied exhaustion of playing for too long, but it’s all worth it, because you finally grasped that piece you were working on. Draco remembers notes floating in the air and learning to listen to himself, to pay attention as the tones ring out and make out what sounded right, what sounded clear and perfect.
“Yes, my duty!” he declares, like anyone here would choose duty over love. “I’m not fully convinced this is a wedding, regardless of your … unconventional attire. There isn’t even a ring!”
“No, because that isn’t what you did. I did suspect, however, that you are grossly oversimplifying things. And, I was right, you are.” Ron is very pleased with the correctness of his assessment and very grim for the matter of it, which leads to a disconcerting expression on his face, caught between pride and misery. Harry doesn’t like it.

“Again, I’m not judging you. I understand what you went through—” Potter interrupts him before Draco can go on, smacks his hand on the table and shutting him up.
joined them now, searching for more clever damsel in distress references they can make, completely ignoring that Potter didn’t even
Harry said this before and he will say it again: he is not a morning person. At all. Especially not when the night before saw him getting little sleep and possibly imaginary emotional debates — in the harsh light of late morning it seems somewhat more unlikely that he and Malfoy (yes,
It’s very impressive, actually, how Weasley stands his ground. Draco remembers him in Hogwarts, remembers a boy flighty from insecurity, his bark louder than his very hesitant bite. Weasley is no longer that boy, unsure of his place among friends and the world at large. Weasley has grown into a man, sure of himself and his ability, gaze heavy on Draco and telling him to get out.
His earnest plea, it would seem, is distasteful to Potter. His mouth curls in rejection, his forehead grows heavy in anger.
“Malfoy, what the hell do you have there?” Potter, unlike his shop, is
“Sorry,” Potter rasps, the world almost impossible to understand, and Draco feels an absurd amount of pride bloom in his chest.
. Sometimes he does feel like apologies were invented to taunt him. “I came to apologise.”
The message is very simple, just one line that Draco’s heart stumbles over before he even reads the words:
about the renovation order to answer. He has been living and breathing these plans since they got married (maybe before that already, he had the first plans suspiciously fast) and Harry has barely seen him do anything else when left to his own devices. Draco knows the renovations inside and out, could recite them in his sleep and, apparently, shoot precise time estimations while dunking a croissant into blackberry jam.
, as if hatred is any less hateful when it’s delivered with excellent posture instead of heated screeching. But then, Lucius Malfoy didn’t need logical reasoning to feel superior.
Malfoy,
Draco snaps into action. He pulls Potter back by the grip he has on his shirt, throwing wards and spells to shield their retreat. He walks them back through people who don’t know Potter and hiss at Draco to pay attention, turning corners until it feels they are going in circles. Potter numbly follows, letting himself be pushed around by Draco.
. That was a new low, one Draco didn't think he would ever make his way out of. But Potter is a hero and notoriously Good and Draco's house is his own again. It seems fitting, in a twisted way, that now Potter should take the role of Draco's captor in tedious, horrible dinners.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Harry grumbles into one of the pillows, already wishing that he hadn’t. Not that ignoring him would have helped any, Malfoy sounds the kind of lost that would have him traipsing in search of a solution for hours if Harry didn’t stop him.
They don’t talk about what happened, about their marriage, or their fight, or the letters. They talk about none of the important things. It almost feels like they are in the first days of marriage, back to Potter and Malfoy, hating without knowing each other. This is worse, though. Perhaps because Harry knows how things
in Harry’s broom, something besides the cold fortune buying Malfoy a — well-deserved, he grudgingly admits — place on the Quidditch team) and devoting most of their time to getting the other into trouble, well, even
He only realises a few steps down that Weasley didn’t tell him anything of worth. When he turns around to confront him about it, Granger and Weasley are suspiciously gone. Typical, the wise mentors are never to be trusted, especially not the kind ones (they are never more than superficially kind). Draco grips his sword tighter, the only real help this movie seems to want to give him.
“No, that’s kind of the point,” Weasley says, like Draco is the stupid one for needing this explained when clearly it’s the architect who didn’t know the first thing about what they were doing. “Harry is trapped up there, kidnapped by an evil crone to grant her everlasting youth or something. He can’t leave, it’s forbidden, so you have to go and save him from his prison.”
Great, now Malfoy talks to him like he is a very stupid, very slow dog that finally made some very tiny progress in something embarrassingly simple. He still looks delectable though, and Harry hasn’t stopped thinking of chasing that imperious attitude away since he swore his revenge for the stolen coffee. And now Malfoy provided him the perfect set-up.
Perhaps he should do that again, throw Potter out of the metaphorical window and do what is right and now what Potter wants to see. After all, this is about
, of course, but Draco doesn’t
“You so are! Theo, agree with me.” Pansy, still uncharacteristically considerate of Draco’s fragile Feelings, recognises his stumbling attempt at changing the mood and, this is the unexpected part, lets him get away with it. Not only that, but she actively encourages it, cutting the softness from her voice like it never was there to begin with and tugging at Theo’s arm to divide the attention focused on Draco.
Malfoy isn’t pouncing, he is
“Yes, I want you and all your little friends out of my house.” Right, Harry had forgotten that Malfoy has no problems with being an enormous git when there is no one he considers his equal around to see and judge.
“Then there is the matter of …” Draco trails off and makes a crude hand gesture, hoping Potter will catch on on his own. He doesn’t, frowning at Draco in exasperation. Right, no way around it then. Draco takes a deep breath, remembers he is behaving absolutely ridiculous because it should
It turns out to be remarkably easy, once Potter showed him how and Draco realised there was no way to eat with dignity. But really, who needs dignity when Potter is too eager and gets sauce everywhere? Who needs dignity when Potter nudges one of the meat balls over to Draco, mumbling how they are delicious and he should try them and completely ignoring that the entire plate is full of them, wanting to care for Draco even in silly gestures. Who needs dignity when their eyes meet, words unspoken between them but filling Draco with the same warmth as if they said them. Who needs dignity when they pick up the same spaghetti, realising it only when their noses meet in the middle?
Potter is not endeared, neither by the use of his first name (which Draco is convinced will break some sort of dam between them, eventually, if Potter doesn’t kill him for this) nor by Draco’s efforts to lighten the mood.
Draco doesn’t want to know what Harry has to say, because he knows he won't like it. Harry might be right in what he is saying, but Draco can’t bear hearing it, listening and analysing and deciding what to do with it. It’s not fair, and it’s not what Harry deserves, but Draco deliberately ignores him in favour of crawling under tables and chairs to find the ferret.
Giving Potter a devilish smirk, Draco focuses all his effort on
That is not the reaction Harry expect, not at all. Surely it’s not
Careful, very,
and distressingly tedious. Draco should ask Theo, he has the uncanny ability to ignite interest and enthusiasm for virtually everything. He would help Draco cut a good figure at the funeral without appearing too prepared. Or his father perhaps, he attended more than one funeral he might or might not have helped bring about.
Which is how he finds himself here, standing in the kitchen with several things started and nothing quite done, his plans and recipe strewn around the room indecipherable from spillage and stains. Draco is only one tiny disaster away from crawling out of the window high up the wall, meant to let the air escape. Draco is desperate, and if he cuts himself again on one of these stupidly sharp knives he might actually cry.
It gets rid of the wolves, though, so Draco leans into it, doesn’t question his strength as he wipes wolves away like they are nothing. He rages and trashes until there are no more wolves, no more sounds, no growling as they approach and no whining as they are hit. Nothing but his breathing, loud and bigger than it should be, hanging in clouds in the cold air, snow falling pleasantly around him like nothing happened, burying the wolves and closing their eyes.
He closed his eyes when Potter surged up, like that might gentle him, but now Draco opens them again, hanging on to Potter and trying to breathe around him in his mouth, ragged and shallow, startled into stillness.
Draco turns—thanks Potter for how unrealistically easy the manoeuvre is in the air—and screams when he is face to face with a lion.
“Hercules,” Weasley says, eyes wide in wonder, gazing up at Draco and blinking against the sun.
There is something Draco knows with absolute certainty, though: he is asexual, and he wishes he weren't.
Well, not a lot. In the end there is only two things Harry absolutely needs to know: why Draco never told him, and if there’s any way to save this weird, wondrous relationship they fought so hard for (or Harry did, for his part, at least).
20 minutes. Draco needs to tell them. They must know, by now they must, but they still need him to say it. This was his job, he is the professional here and he is damn good at what he does.
going to hold Potter’s hand, make sure he doesn’t drown in the darkness he seeks refuge in.
Ron is wrong, of course. Harry wouldn't have survived the war if he weren't a bit more ruthless than that. Even without the excuse of a war hanging over them, Harry knows he wouldn’t hesitate for a second if someone were stupid enough to threaten his friends, his family.
, Draco doesn't say.
It stands to reason, and as further proof of the twisted sense of humour the universe forces on them all, that Osbourne would deliver the citation today, just in time to make Draco splutter on his tea. Draco did a brilliant job pretending nothing is the matter with the way his life is developing (hiding, Pansy calls it, and Draco can’t, in good conscience, disagree), but having to face Harry again would blow his painstakingly constructed delusions apart. They aren’t stable to begin with, and Harry is too full of energy and passion for anything half-hearted to exist around him. The pathetic pieces of armour Draco’s pulled up around himself will be snatched off with only one word from Harry.
“Of course I am here, I’m the one leading this little search party.” It’s Draco’s own attempt at lightening the mood, though it falls flat in the face of Potter’s astonishment.
Malfoy,
“Malfoy?” Right, Potter asked a question. Draco nods, flinches at the movement and burrows deeper into Potter’s warm body. “That’s a no, then.”
Granger inclines her head, not taking her eyes off Draco as she does so. He is permitted closer, possibly only so she can devour him without strain. Draco decides to take the risk—pray that Potter would protect him should she get violent—and steps closer. He also symbolically lays his sword down in the river, a good distance away from her and Weasley. The sword would have been useless to him anyway—because no, he didn’t take lessons between this and the failure in the last movie—but Granger seems to appreciate the gesture nonetheless.
"For the last time, I am not going to marry just so I can keep living in a judgemental house!" Harry might not have grown out of his temper as much as he likes to think. At least it usually hits intrusive reporters who deserve it or Hermione, who barely takes a second to look unimpressed before going back to her notes and references, trying to intimidate Harry into compliance with terms longer than his own name. It works scarily often, but Harry already made his mind up on this one.
Surely that is a good thing? Draco feels like it should be, but Harry's continued silence is making him nervous.
“Right, of course not, that was the point after all. I’ll just leave then, I guess, maybe I can —”
He looks down to find a candlestick, golden and crested with a face.
for that kind of thing in his formative years—but he especially doesn’t enjoy the thought of cleaning
Draco thinks the fact alone that he needs to be
He also has the feeling Draco won’t let him go back to sleep without acknowledgement, and Harry desperately needs either more sleep or more coffee. Draco might have finally learnt that Harry takes his caffeine with milk, but the overall quality hasn't improved much. Sleep it is, then, no way is Harry getting up to make coffee and listen to Draco’s complaints instead of sinking into peaceful oblivion.
They watch the door together, watch it shake under the assault and hold their breath for whatever is on the other side to make it through.
Malfoy sneers, like he expected nothing else but is still disappointed. Haughty arse, Harry can see why Grimmauld is so eager to house him. Maybe that wouldn't be too bad, maybe it would never let Malfoy out again and everyone else would get some peace for once.
“Fine, so we are doing this
Despite that, it's kind of nice to be cared for, even if it’s overprotective and — Harry can’t move his hand. This is officially too much now.
Well, Theo isn’t drunk, Draco supposes. Theo is never drunk, because Theo never drinks, so Theo is never drunk. It must have been horrible for him, at first, when all his friends drank, and he didn’t, and then all his friends got loud or loopy or both, but he didn’t — Draco thinks they’ve learnt to handle things now, though. They are quite well behaved drunks, really, and Theo is a very patient sober.
"That's unacceptable, I thought it would have been an hour at most! Look at you, you look like you'd keel over when you don't eat for a day, all scrawny." Harry almost protests that. What can he say, it's a sensitive topic for him. But seeing Ron so indignant is kind of touching and — Harry needs to remember that — the reaction he hoped for. "Wait a moment and try not to get locked into the cellar again, we'll be right over with some food for you."
for Draco to deal with, has he? They would hardly be in this situation if Harry would, just once, behave like any of the people Draco usually surrounds himself with. Draco doesn't know how Harry would react.
“I really thought you were more intelligent than this, it's hard to see why. You made no secret out of hating me, and by law the property is more yours than it’s mine simply because it was
Now at the very latest Hermione would stop listening to him, telling Harry to grow up and have a
Harry knows before he even fully realises what his situation even
Now Draco wishes he had just gotten this over with. He would have made a disappointing meal that would have been barely edible, Harry would have politely feigned appreciation and they could have dropped the ridiculous idea of cooking before it became a tradition. They are both no good at it, after all, and they could be enjoying delicious food at some expensive restaurant for their dates. They could have taken turns choosing the place where they would eat, even, if Harry would have insisted on this exchange of power between them. Draco could be picking out his most impressive clothes, getting ready for a night of grace and splendour; instead he is having a breakdown surrounded by shiny, unfeeling appliances.
“Then we’ll play a game. I always wanted to beat you, all those rumours about how good you are, unbeatable and all that crap—we can talk while we play a round.” Weasley is gone before Draco can protest, hunting down a board Draco has no idea what to do with. Well, at least he can get some answers, if he manages to prolong his misery long enough to ask a few prying questions.
“Funny, I thought you would want to write about my spectacular fall out of society's good graces.” Potter crosses his arms in front of his chest, leans back against the wall. It’s all very intimidating, might even work in scaring Draco off if he hadn’t spent a majority of his wasted youth with people far crueler than Potter.
Harry doesn’t know nor care — very pointedly unconcerned with
fault (fine, it was, indeed, Harry’s fault, but Draco couldn’t prove it, so it doesn’t count). Harry laughed then, too, and didn’t stop for a long time.
“It wouldn’t be my fault, I would be absolutely fine.” Potter has the gall to smile at him, all bright innocence, like he didn’t threaten to take Draco’s foot off and be fine with it. Too bad Draco doesn’t believe him.
Then he hits his head against a helpfully skewed bedpost, and Harry remembers.
“Okay, this was enough apologising, don’t you think?” Potter ducks out from under Draco, staying as close as possible without being wrapped up in each other. “I produced this very romantic dinner, including candles and music—we should eat before it goes cold.”
“What did you say about the kitchen, when are you going to refurnish it?” Harry asks, glaring at his uncooperative chair.
Potter squeaks—a highly un-Saviour-like noise that Draco wishes he had recorded and will tease him for endlessly—and jostles Draco’s head where it’s resting. Draco pokes him again just for that.
He is about to ask Weasley what their problem is, where the hell Potter is, why all of this feels wrong, when he realises something crucial: the dwarfs are on eye level for him.
Draco gives her a shy and awkward wave, mostly to see if she would be alright with him stepping closer but also because he doesn’t know what else to do. She is scary, even as a horse, which is a hard feat to pull off.
“Alright, give it here,” Draco commands and doesn’t allow his surprise to show as Potter obeys, dropping his hand into Draco’s.
This dragon is nothing like those Draco dreamed of as a child. There is no intelligence there, nothing in its eyes but malice, glowing bright yellow. This dragon is bent on killing Draco, no rhyme or reason but that Potter’s mind decided he needed to be protected. (It wasn’t
That is what happened. Harry never even noticed.
“Fine, you are right. This is your home and I’m hurt and frankly, it’s appalling that you tried to exploit me for work.” Draco feels much better already, sitting down, good enough to smirk as Potter starts protesting. Then Potter laughs and shakes his head and Draco thinks it’s worth the headache, hearing Potter laugh.
Potter is howling in new laughter long before Draco understands what he is looking at, Granger even smaller than Weasley and oddly round, ticking and ticking like she should breathe.
“I would like that,” Harry says. He smiles, small and tentative and a bit wobbly but it’s charming and Draco — why is Harry smiling?
“Come on, up you get.” Ron doesn’t comment on Harry sitting on the floor, or on the light being dim, and the room being cold. He doesn’t comment, and Harry is grateful.
The entire scenery is changed, the forest that seemed to stretch endlessly when Potter first brought them here now borders on a castle, on the hedge of wilderness growing around it. Draco has little motivation to claw his way through that, but there is no doubt in his mind that Potter is in there, up in the highest tower and looking down on him, watching his approach.
Does Draco honestly believe Harry would hit him? That's quite horrifying. Granted, they don’t have the
Draco doesn’t know what Weasley is going through, no, but he knows that same grief and how it looks on himself, on those he loves.
There was no other choice for Harry but to fight through the heaviness, to approach problems with the arrogant certainty that he could defeat them. Sink or swim.
“You are nothing like Dudley, you know.” Harry says it like it’s a miracle, a revelation. Draco wonders how long Harry compared the two of them. “I thought you were, because you look the same from the outside, but you are not.
Pansy Parkinson.
“No, mother, you are perfectly aware of the situation.” A little too aware, if Draco had his way, but he never stood a chance at concealing anything from her, let alone his pathetic and stubbornly persistent crush on Potter.
name, and not only would that twat be horribly smug about it, Harry Malfoy also sounds really bad. After Malfoy refused to take Harry’s name, as was to be expected, and everyone agreed a hyphenated name would be quite the mouthful and defeat the purpose of presenting as a unit to Grimmauld, there was nothing left but Black. All in all, by far the best option. It’s Sirius’ name, after all, though Harry suspects he never wanted it any more than he wanted this house.
At least they got out of that grey hell, that alone might excuse the jump. Draco doesn’t know where they are now—didn’t expect to at this rate—but it’s beautiful, the earth stretching out before them as far as he can see, the light of the setting sun casting a orange glow over the scene. They are standing on a mountain ledge, watching out over masses of animals gathered below, standing peaceful as if in waiting.
“None the matter, I can bring you new ones if these die.” Draco smiles at Potter, as he always does, hoping to get a smile in return.
Instead of facing two Malfoys trying to pin him down with his faults and crimes, which is what Harry expected and prepared himself for, he now has to deal with mother and son making polite small talk, and trying to find something intelligent to add so he doesn’t seem dull or disinterested. Every time Harry allows himself a moment to contemplate how to turn this situation in his favour, Narcissa notices, exploiting his carelessness to shoot him a question Harry answers without thinking, revealing all kinds of unflattering things about himself — ranging from his tendency to raid the fridge after nightmares, up unto the admission that he currently sleeps on his best friends’ couch.
“Shouldn’t it be Black?” Seamus’ voice cuts through the heavy air. Black? What does he — oh,
No, that’s ridiculous. Draco tried that — learning from Harry — and it didn’t work. The best thing he can say about those experiences is that they gave him time and motivation to perfect his Occlumency, shutting his brain to every and all impressions, neatly cutting the strings between his mind and body and only coming back up once Harry was done.
“I know that, I know how difficult it can be. We all wrote some uncomfortable letters, you most of us all, remember?” Blaise doesn’t let go of Draco, cupping his face in his hands and forcing him to meet his eyes.
Draco would ignore him, would focus on the dark figure approaching without mercy, but Potter is putting on a
“I’m gay, Pansy,” Draco reminds her, like she could have possibly forgotten. Pansy’s expression doesn’t change, grows perhaps a bit more coquettish. “Very gay.”
Harry shouldn’t be able to hear when Malfoy gets in — that’s why he chose the most remote floo they have. That Harry can hear him anyway,
“You are sure you don’t want to go out?” Draco asks, because he can’t sit in the silence any longer.
In fact, Draco told him quite enough embarrassing childhood memories for today.
change the future, and so that is what Harry will do.
Harry has seen this before, Ron obsessed with some ludicrously detailed ideal he wants to achieve and trying time and time again, growing more and more frustrated with each 'imperfect' result. If Harry doesn’t stop him, Ron is going to start the next attempt immediately, frenzied and clumsy, doomed to fail spectacularly. A distraction is in order, and quickly at that.
be a conspiracy against him. “Potter doesn’t write you love letters anymore and now you fear he’ll never write any letters anymore—not even the not disgustingly romantic sort—and you are moping because you are looking at a life without Potter. Correct?”
Harry is tempted to tell her that, yes, actually, since she is offering, he
“Should I —” Harry still holds Capt'n high in the air, caught between holding her as per Draco’s reaffirmed permission and setting her back down as Draco implied he ought to do.
though, and in the low light he leans close, their foreheads brushing against each other as Draco starts to paint Potter’s nails.
“Don’t like the idea of your friends head over heels for Pansy? Is it because she is a Slytherin or because she is my friend?” Malfoy asks idly, studying his nails, eyes flitting up to Harry's. Bloody twat, Harry doesn’t find him attractive at all.
For Potter, he’ll try the baking thing. Perhaps it won’t be as bad as Draco fears.

— Harry forgot that under all the revelations and words.
That was the plan, brag about his splendour and make Harry carry the boxes, simple. Why couldn’t Draco keep to the plan?
Pansy sighs, eyes wide and unbearably sad. Right, Draco can’t do this anymore. Asking Pansy was a stupid idea.
Potter
It would have been perfect, too: Harry would have leaned down, pressed a soft kiss to Malfoy’s very tempting lips and if Malfoy didn’t protest, he might even have dared to stay, to prolong the kiss and draw Malfoy out. And, if by some cruel happenstance, Malfoy had decided he doesn’t want to kiss Harry, has, in fact, never wanted to kiss him and got simply carried away—well, then Harry could act like he didn’t want the kiss either, like he stumbled and fell and yes, it was weird but also no one is painfully awkward in love, so it can still be a nice barbecue!
“But this is brilliant!” Malfoy doesn't answer in favour of keeping up his muttering, though it's nothing Harry can easily make out and he doesn’t care enough to ask about it. “That means Grimmauld at long last stopped with the blatant favouritism!”
It’s infuriating.
don’t feel comfortable kissing you under these circumstances. Is that better?” Draco hopes it is, it’s the best he can do.

Most jarring, Potter is no longer in his arms.
He holds them like a shield anyway, presents them to Malfoy without a single word because he still hasn’t remembered how to speak and kind of wants the earth to swallow him and his meagre offering when Parkinson laughs at him.
Thankfully, he
brought a ferret into
“No, Malfoy, all that makes you is annoying. You keep showing up with absolutely no reason at all, talking about that interview you want and trying to bribe me. You are neither interesting nor entertaining—we are
But Draco persevered. Because he is a Malfoy and he is a Slytherin and he was taught early on to hold his head high and not to drag his feet. You are what you let others see, so be mindful of the image you present.
It’s odd — Draco is undeniably gone, and Harry remembers the shift in Grimmauld when he stepped into the Floo, but sometimes, it feels like he is still here, wandering the corridors Ron drags them thorough. It’s the echoes, Harry knows, ghost lights calling to him and hiding the doom they are in under a pretty facade. Sirens, perhaps, beckoning him closer to devour him. If it weren't for Ron holding him close, Harry would go.
to argue with Ron.
Potter’s stroking stops, as well as his praise. Draco misses them both with a pang that leaves him cold, aching to have them back.
Although, maybe they wouldn’t have to talk about it at all. Neither of them mentions it because that would defeat the point, but they are quite good at the denial thing. They would never have to acknowledge anything.
“Absolutely sure.” Weasley nods without hesitation, grave in his confirmation.
There is a joke in here, about Gryffindors and lions and true natures revealed in distress, but the lion—Potter, Potter the lion with that stupid scar and his green eyes wide and scared—backs away at his scream, falling faster, and Draco doesn’t have time to make jokes, not even possibly insensitive ones.
“How is that going to make anything better at all?” As far as Draco is aware, penguins literally
He lays there long enough, thinking and trying not to, to decide that, if the dragon were to kill him, it would have done so already. Draco is breathing normally again, the heat has receded from his skin, and he is getting restless. (Smug, he is triumphant and smug because there has been no sign of the dragon and Draco is beginning to think he might have won.)
If Draco doesn’t trust him, how did they get as close as they are? What about the first name thing, about the hugs and the soft smiles and the elaborate breakfast? What about when Harry told Draco about Sirius and how they sleep in the same bed ever since Grimmauld froze them into compliance? They never said anything about trust, but Harry does trust Draco. He doesn’t know since when or how but he trusts him implicitly. He thought Draco trusts him, as well. He certainly hoped so.
Well, Draco will show him! Draco Malfoy is not someone to be left behind, not even when stumbling and spitting blood. He is the best damn hero Potter could have hoped for and, if need be, he’ll prove it to him again and again. Then they can return here together, to this cabin in a far corner of Potter’s mind, and they can find furs to lay onto the ground, stretch out in front of the fire.
Come to think of it, Harry is a little surprised that
“Does anyone know where we are?” Draco asks, because he thinks it more pertinent than ‘what the hell was that’. He is going to ask that one later, ask Potter directly.
this. Draco nods, acknowledging the suspicion and taking up the bottle to confirm the verdict.
“Still here,” Potter mumbles, the words coughed out of a rough throat, almost incomprehensible but
didn’t doubt that he would be the perfect person to declare Potter’s story to the greedy public, but that doesn’t mean that
“Yeah, that one. Turns out he wasn’t cheating so I didn’t have to make him regret ever leaving Romania. They have… an arrangement, I guess you could call it. An open relationship, because Charlie is ace and doesn’t often want sex, and Lucas does want it, and, apparently, grows cranky when he doesn’t get laid regularly. Which, trust me, is more than I wanted to know about my brother’s sex life, ever. But they figured something out that allows them both to get as much or as little sex as they want while staying together. It wasn’t easy, but they love each other, so they made it work.” Ron nods, done with his little advertisement for open relationships (is that a
Harry belongs to this forest. Harry will adapt.
“Potter, you do know men cannot get pregnant, right?” Draco feels stupid even asking, he shouldn’t have to ask something so basic.
Draco nudges his nose up a bit in response, burrows himself deeper, and Harry takes that to mean that Draco understood what he tried to say.
Granger definitely snorts this time, a very undignified sound for a horse to make. Draco raises his eyebrow at her to let her know that.
appreciate us enjoying their forest.” Potter is interrupted by a hiccup before Draco can ask about that. “And with all of this hiccuping I don’t know how smoothly that would go anyway, I’d be laughing the entire time.”
is difficult any way, that Potter lacks sophistication, but one would be wrong, rude, and judging superficially. Draco’s fellow journalists don’t seem to understand that, seeming to take the reports of Potter refusing interviews since the world begun demanding them as a sign that Potter is
Once Draco realised Harry wasn’t going to change his mind and accost him, things almost got pleasant. Perhaps pleasant isn’t the right word — surreal? Is there a good word to describe the staggering leap in intimacy they did? Something to catch the embarrassment of spilling his ridiculous fears of being rejected, the elation of Harry calling him by his first name that shouldn’t feel as gratifying as it does, the blossoming warmth where before Draco could convince himself there was nothing but the cold agreements of deals and contracts. There is no such word Draco can think of, nothing he ever experienced before, but he thinks he likes it.
“Could I — I mean, I would
“Goodness, Malfoy! Are you expecting to feed an entire army?” Potter looks around the room in wide-eyed astonishment, counting the plates and bowls and glasses.
“Rain, Malfoy, it’s going to rain!” Draco doesn’t get a chance to protest before he is being pulled up, Potter’s arm around his waist as he lifts him and twirls him, setting him down laughing.
“Merlin, Draco, I’m so sorry! I thought you knew. You asked so many questions, and I never wanted to outright say because I didn’t want to be that wanker that hands out labels for his own convenience, just going around pressing people into boxes — I gave you hints! I thought you might start doing your own research, discover everything organically and see how it fits, you know?” Draco doesn’t. He doesn’t know; that is rather the point.
It also doesn’t look like a threat to anything but Draco’s eardrums. It’s a figure—Potter, Draco is quickly growing sure of, because
“Yes, isn’t it brilliant?” Right, of course Weasley would enjoy being a lizard, a weak descendant from dragons that can’t even fly anymore because Muggles shot them out off the sky often enough to warrant a fear of it. If you don’t use your wings, they regress and leave you stuck on the ground, a mere memory of old splendour and what could have been.

Well, Draco can certainly do
The first big thing that makes this better than that stupid lake is the lack of water. They are on dry land once again, in the back alley of some city. Also—and this is the second big thing—there is a plate of food between them, a huge plate of spaghetti with bolognaise sat on a table, candles flickering. Draco hadn’t realised how hungry he was before he was presented with this simple dish, a veritable feast to his growling stomach.
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco says, very deliberately, and pretends not to notice anything different when Potter’s head snaps up and he stares at him.
it shouldn’t get far enough for his aim to matter, which would be a blessing because the man is crowding against Potter and aim is crucial.

(It’s not creepy, it’s
Draco missed him. It’s ridiculous, he has been here all day, but he missed Potter.
There are speeches to plan (and Merlin forbid, Harry’s burned at least three drafts of Ron’s best man speech), guest lists to debate (Harry managed to talk Draco down a few hundred, but he wanted the reception, at least, to be grand — something the gossip magazines he still denies he reads will talk about for months to come), and flowers to arrange (Lucius first criticised their every idea and then finally took the whole thing over, and Harry is slightly worried what is awaiting them tomorrow, but he knew better than to refuse) — the work never seemed to stop.
Finally it is silent, darkness falling back over them both and sleep calling —
The next scene is much better. Granted, it wasn’t hard to be better than that disaster, but Potter has been known to lean into disaster purely out of spite. Draco wouldn’t have been surprised if the next scene was even worse.
For one, there is Harry’s terrible childhood, that Draco only heard exaggerated rumours on. He never consider the rumours a reliable source of information, because that would have been stupid and naive. They changed and grew every year, with every strange thing Harry did and every Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Harry cost their job. Draco never believed a single one of them. They weren’t true anyway, as Harry just confirmed. They were much kinder than the truth.
Harry doesn’t bother keeping quiet as he stomps through the corridor, nor does he knock before slamming the door to Malfoy’s room open.
Did he even have to? They made a deal, Harry and him, and Draco agreed to do whatever possible so that Grimmauld wouldn’t pierce Harry on a rusty nail to bleed out in some forsaken corridor. Grimmauld wanted a proper marriage, and that means a new set of duties, even if, in the beginning, they tried avoiding that. In the end, Draco was never good at avoiding his duties; though, he wasn’t great at
Anger flashes over Weasley’s face, burning and all consuming, and suddenly he is out of the floo and barging into Draco’s parlour, glowering at Pansy and stalking towards her. It’s not a question anymore, how Potter’s awkward and fumbling sidekick managed to survive the war; Draco would almost worry if he didn’t have full faith in not only Pansy’s competence but also the enjoyment she finds in knocking arrogant tossers (which yes, does include Draco sometimes, everyone is flawed) down a few notches. No, Draco’s biggest concern is Potter, who won’t like finding his friend's spirit broken and will force yet
The costume, however, must be the most Gryffindor thing Draco could ever have imagined to find, a garish red and clinging to him like a second skin, showing off muscle in a way that would make him look even more impressive when he does bother to fight. It does very little for him hanging in chains of electricity, more mocking than anything else.
and he fought and if there was tea slopping over it better have been the result of a ferocious rant, including slamming hands on the table.
“No worries, Potter, you’ll change your mind eventually.” Draco salutes him, ducks out of the store before Potter can deny it. He leaves the tea; perhaps Potter will drink it when he feels less observed. Pride is strange that way.
Possibly-a-date, yes. Draco knows better than to say that out loud, but he definitely thought it when he chose an outfit for today. He took care to wear something casual, something that hides all its effort in not
who needs the glasses among the two of us.”
It doesn’t help, Weasley answers before Granger can open her mouth.
“I’d love to,” Draco lies, smirking at Potter and hoping it sounds genuine enough to fool Potter.
Weasley had less luck, pouting where he sits in the river, arms crossed over his chest and legs—goat, if Draco were to guess—stretched away from him. There are horns curling on his head and a beard sprouting from his chin. It’s not the kind of role Draco would have expected him to object against, all told, but if looks could kill Draco would at least feel a little weak from Weasley’s.
Draco has until Weasley realises he is terrible at chess. He better start ranking his questions.
safety Draco should be concerned about, if only because getting blood out of carpets is a pain.
Potter though, as he has a habit of doing, defies Draco’s expectations. There is a spark there, irritation, that was meant to grow into something bigger, something more consuming. But it doesn’t, doesn’t explode into one of Potter’s temper tantrums. No, it … vanishes, sinks back down into the haze of Potter’s green eyes, leaving behind the placid stranger Draco can’t stand.
“You couldn’t get rid of me if you wanted, this was your one and only chance,” Draco whispers back, wrapping his arms around Harry, wrapping them tighter and squeezing.
The process of teaching Draco how to work the coffeemaker is somewhat hazy, Harry’s hands going through the motions without his brain giving them any directions, too focused on how close Draco is standing, how he has to stand on his tiptoes to see over Harry's shoulder and the little squeak he makes when Harry decides that this is ridiculous and pulls him in front of himself.
“Oh it’s not funny, not at all! I just didn’t think
. You are a terrible student, hopeless. I will never get a trophy like this.” Weasley sighs and drapes himself onto the stone, the picture of dying decadence. Draco doesn’t have time for this.
This, more or less, must be how they landed here, stumbled into one, little elegant heap and both their hearts beating loudly, breath coming quickly. It’s rather comfortable, all told. But then, Draco landed Harry, not the chair, and he has to imagine his fall was far more soft than Harry’s, if only for the fact that Draco didn’t have to cushion someone else. Draco is comfortable, Harry’s arms around him in his failed attempt to catch him and keep them from losing their balance, his head resting on Harry’s chest.
Except that he did and it’s important to him that she knows that. (He doesn’t want to look at that one too closely.)
Although, considering what Harry said so far, perhaps he shouldn't say anything more. Asking Draco about his favourite movie — what was he thinking? First, Harry is relatively certain Draco doesn’t know what a movie
Draco stares at him, eyes aware and burning, and he stopped patting the ferret. Harry screwed up, extremely so. Draco will eviscerate him for that. He is clearly not emotionally stable after this — and really, who would be? — so Harry has to pay the price for his carelessness.
me.” Potter is angry, throwing hands in the air as he gesticulates his rage.
Right, Draco will listen to her,
“Athebyne will never replace Hedwig, I know that and you know that and even she knows that, but if you treat her with kindness, she will treat you the same. Do you think you could try that?” Draco is not good at comforting people, he really isn’t, and Potter doesn’t
Too late, Harry is already here.
what he is owed, he agreed to stop sabotaging my renovation plans. Dearly necessary, believe me, and not only because it would mean a lot to my mother.” So much in fact, that Draco cannot put it into words. His last visits have worn him down, having to disappoint his mother’s tentative hopes time and time again. He refuses to do so any longer, Draco shudders to think what it might do to her if he doesn't get this done soon.
“Please, as if that ever mattered before.” Draco is scrambling, reaching desperately for something to say and bring between him and Harry.
“Because —” Harry has nothing. Not
married after all. Appropriate or not, Draco is grateful it didn’t happen.
that is what he did, he certainly passed something in his approaching of the bed, something with consequences that he can’t quite tell yet. A ward would make sense, more than Malfoy just happily sleeping away, completely unaware of anything —
He didn’t even consider that he would worry his friends, that he has people (
“His good looks, of course.” Malfoy winks at him, the expression so at odds with what Harry expected that he would swear it didn’t actually happen. “Now, I’ll announce the happy news to my family and have the lawyers draw up a contract. I suppose Granger will want to read it before she allows you to sign it?”
things he doesn’t talk about and lives with, why should this be any different? Draco obviously wants it this way, dragging Harry back to Grimmauld after tea with his mother and the murder threat from his father, not saying a single word on the matter of their fight or separation. Instead, he pulled Harry down onto the couch and clung to him, not letting go until they both fell asleep, ferrets curled up around them.

, admitting that is a humiliation Harry could have spared him. Then that is a stupid question to ask anyway, even people who do know what a movie is. Favourite anything is a stupid question, really, Harry was never a fan. Huge parts of that is that he never knows what to answer, because favourites are fickle and liable to change at all times, but especially when put on the spot like this.
behaved like bloody gits, but Potter rudely talks over him, further proving his point, “but they always point out that you are my — well, you know, that we are kind of married, and since we are both still alive they figure we must get along somehow and now they want to … re-evaluate, I guess.”
Next Draco stores the plates, all in a neat row. It’s very quick and very satisfying and Draco smiles at the two of the piles he has taken care of. He puts the glasses and cups in the second drawer, places them in two rows and settles them closely against each other, using all the space he has.
Draco has never before been so relieved to see him, weird animal or not.
Even in the — much more likely — case that they don't spontaneously run away together into the rising sun, having Draco breathing and real in front of him would have its advantages. For one, Draco is wonderfully expressive. He doesn't know it, would die of mortification if he knew, but Harry can read him as well as he can read Ron. Better, sometimes, Harry feels.
“Good!” Blaise smiles at him, hands falling away from Draco’s face and settling back into his hair, gently petting. (Draco should probably protest that treatment, but he really enjoys it, so he won’t.) “I think it’s time for ice cream now, don’t you?”
the title, but it seems that the title is a requirement to live here. Only the best for the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black, best being narrowly defined as inbred and rich. If it wasn’t for Sirius and how much this house meant to him (aside from his hatred for it, their relationship was a complicated thing Harry regrets not asking more about) Harry would have simply let it to rot. Adapt or die, just like Darwin said (a reference Harry solely dug out to antagonise the house, he isn’t above rubbing their Muggle predicted end under their haughty noses).
More understanding than Potter himself, who doesn’t look at the tea, back to pretending he doesn’t like it. Draco frowns; he didn’t miss this little ritual of denial.
“It’s alright, you don’t have to say anything. I don’t want to talk about it anyway.” Potter says it so casually, so used to his grief, and Draco shouldn’t believe him, should insist on talking about this, but in truth he is relieved. He isn’t prepared for this conversation, doesn’t know what to say and what to avoid and he certainly doesn’t know how he himself feels about any of this.
“No, stay. You — it helps.” The words are laughable insufficient, nowhere near big enough to capture the gravity of the moment.
. Actually, no, it was
Everything seems as it should be, the low light of morning filtering through the curtains, their clothes neatly sorted into the closet because Draco hates the mess (but he also hates cleaning, so he makes Harry do it), and — Draco!
another man—he seemed to prefer his Weasleys with breasts—he supposes he can graciously forgive him for his ineptitude. Gryffindors, after all, can be horribly uptight.
Also, Draco does have to prove himself in the fight. That is a constant in their dance, regrets or not.
Potter glares at him, which is the best answer Draco could have asked for. He takes Draco’s cup right out of his hands—which is
It’s all very pleasant, dangerously so. It’s okay though, because Draco was given a sword.
catch him and let Potter fall onto his face? He would never let Draco forget about that and honestly, it would have required more effort than standing here and catching the man.
Potter looks lovely. There is no other word for it, nothing that would describe him better though it doesn’t do him justice, pathetically inadequate.
“No, seriously, Harry, this isn’t your fault. You trusted Malfoy to be honest and tell you the truth and you acted accordingly. You are far better than you give yourself credit for.” Ron is painfully earnest in his reassurance, looking at Harry with the utter conviction that Harry would never knowingly hurt someone — not this deep, not even someone he once considered a friend.
“These aren’t the right words, you know?” Weasley asks, leaning against a stone like he has always been there. “Don’t you remember anything I taught you?”
introductions, perhaps — showing Harry how Capt'n likes to be petted, but Harry has similar ideas of overcoming the uncomfortable silence by filling it with words and they both start talking at the same time.
It was also, at this point, that Draco decided he would get his father some books on the value of rhetoric and how to improve in that regard. Not that it was a
The singing is loud enough to hear now, sweet and promising, pulling at Draco and filling him. This is where Harry would grimace, would press the headphones down onto Draco’s ears until the music is so loud, Draco fears he’ll go deaf.
Changing that heavily biased approach had been what Harry hoped to achieve, of course, but over the months of marriage and every tiny detail needing cutthroat negotiating and concessions, Harry had as good as given up on it.

“Lay back down, and let you go back to
, his magic lashing out in fury. That explains it, then. Malfoy has better look scared!
Seeing how Draco was convinced his father didn’t care anymore, it was surprisingly good and touching, a nice reminder that the strange man obsessed with the Manor grounds is, in fact, his father, coping with the horrors of the war (two wars, Draco tends to forget that) in ways that Draco doesn’t understand. Their validity isn’t bound to Draco’s understanding or approval, though, and, as long as they work for his father, Draco shouldn’t give up on the man.
“It hardly matters, since I don’t plan to seduce Potter, do I?” Draco snaps, more defensive than perhaps wise.
is what he decides to go with.
Draco could stare at that smile for hours, could waste away without a care as long as he has that smile to cling to.
“You wound me, darling. I’m trying to be supportive of your interests.” This time Narcissa is definitely laughing at both of them, pointedly looking at how little space there is between them. As if it wasn't abundantly clear what she was talking about.
Draco has been to countless uncomfortable dinner parties in his life, playing nice with stuffy old bats and pretentious wankers trying to explain the world to him, as if it wasn't Draco's people who wrote the rules. Draco is well aware that, if he plays his cards right, the world is his for the taking. He doesn't need social upstarts and new money to fumble with the philosophies of people more intelligent than them to recognise that the system is rigged. But those are the people who make the laws, so Draco nods and smiles and offers his humble opinion here and there, while he quietly remembers everything they do that he can later make fun of to make Pansy laugh so hard that she spits out her drink.
No matter, Harry would rather scare him than beg, anyway.
“I still want that tea, you know?”
“Scared, Potter?” Because Potter can never resist a challenge, especially not if it’s Draco asking.
Thing is, Harry would like to be hugged. Draco
There are the goggles, for one, pushed up into his hair and making it even messier than usual. There are his nails—chewed, has he always chewed on his nails?—and fidgeting fingers, tugging at the seams of his shirt. There are his eyes, of course, bright as they settle onto Draco. There is the magic in his shop, thrumming around Draco embracing him like an old friend.
Draco couldn’t stand for Harry to laugh at him. Harry might not realise it, but he holds the key to Draco’s most treasured memories. This is where Draco grew up, where he discovered the world and hid from it in. This is

Draco is a person, with his own complex motivations and struggles that he’s never shared with Harry. Harry needs to remember that before he goes around strangling him against the closest wall. Draco is his husband, his infuriatingly obstinate husband, but, nonetheless, deserving of more respect.
Draco watches him with wide eyes, well aware that something crucial has changed, that he has to watch his words better. The room is Harry's now, Harry holds all the power.
That’s something Draco encouraged in him, he thinks (Draco likes to claim he
Apparently he was wrong. Apparently Draco does

Draco. The name feels nice on his tongue, much nicer than Malfoy, softer. Harry could get used to that. He could also very much get used to the sharp intake of breath, the look of wonder on Malfoy’s face. Draco’s face. Yes, that’s better.
It’s embarrassing, but Draco honestly, quietly, thought there might be a future for him and Harry if he had a word, an explanation. But knowing the official term for what’s wrong with Draco doesn’t change the fact that there
“Perhaps we should do that,” Draco says, and he hides behind his cup as Harry’s bright smile makes him blush.
way. Then you would act like that was always the plan and it has nothing to do with fear at all.”
“You aren’t going to say anything?” Draco is getting frustrated. How is he supposed to get out of this? There is no monster to defeat, not even in a way that breaks the rules, and if Potter is truly here to get that kiss, Draco doesn’t doubt that they will be here until he is satisfied.
Potter looks at him, about as moved as he was by the spilt tea.
“Draco Malfoy,” Potter starts on what will either be a scolding or a second attempt. Draco doesn’t know what he hopes for, given that his heart couldn’t take a second attempt but he very much wants it anyway. “Love of my life, apple of my eye, moon to my sun—will you make me the happiest man on this earth by promising to spend your life with mine?”
guy and being lucky enough to have the rest collapse without his leadership) but Harry doesn’t want rational solutions to self-made problems.
“We were enjoying ourselves, you know? It’s rude to just jump worlds like this,” Weasley grumbles, like Draco is supposed to apologise they interrupted—he doesn’t want to know what they interrupted. Last he knows, Weasley and Granger were a clock and candlestick, he doesn’t want to know what they could have gotten up to.
say it, all wrapped up in a few layers of sparkling sarcasm.
It’s not, Blaise doesn’t buy it for a second.
“I know, how cruel of me to favour a tedious evening with stilted conversation with my dull husband over spending time with my friends who love to tease and pester me instead of adhering to the loyalty we are infamous for.” That came out bitterer than Draco expected. Yes, he doesn’t look forward to his evening with Potter — it will be even worse than they are predicting, and they all know he has barely concealed resentment and active antagonising to look forward to — but Draco didn’t mean to drag the mood down by putting this pesky truth into words, making it unavoidable.
(Later, he will remember his mother doing this for him, his father sitting up in the middle of the night to read him stories and adopt silly voices, sending Draco off into sleep with a kiss to his forehead. He felt safe, then, loved and protected, and these moments of trust and affection would be sorely missed once he was judged too old for them.)
“You can’t
“They
He doesn’t have to search for long. Draco turns only one tree and there he is, sitting in a clearing and soothing a panicking horse, only still there because its harness got caught in the arms of one of the trees, holding it cruel and close.
Draco lays there, breathing heavy in the scorched air and trying not to move as if that could save him. He thinks about what happened, tries to understand the logistics of it and how it must have looked to outsiders, but he can’t picture it. He should be dead, he is pretty sure, and that is the point he decides not to think anymore.
And yet Ginny always
Potter is very close. Draco realises that once he finally shuts up.
It feels divine. Potter’s lips warm and soft against his, chapped because no matter how many chapsticks Draco leaves behind at his place, the moron never seems to get the hint. (He also doesn’t return them, which saw Draco investing an awful lot in chapsticks that would never be used.)
and—this isn’t going to help my reputation at all and you might actually fall asleep at the mere mention of it—they meet up to play board games? And everyone is supposed to bring food. I was exempt so far because I can’t do anything, really, but it was decided that any further invitations will depend on my participation in tradition.”
“Because he is valued here regardless of his objective utility to the situation,” Granger says to calm her near hysteric boyfriend, before adding, rather pointedly like Draco needed the unsubtle nod to understand the warning: “Unlike some other, whose continued presence is tied to their skill and bedside manners.”
This is it, Narcissa will decide that he isn’t good enough for her son, that he obviously has drinking problems he was trying to hide, and, as everyone knows, it’s only downhill from there. Narcissa is going to discreetly take Harry aside, and very politely, and in the most diplomatic way possible, tell him that he will ask Draco for a divorce, and that Draco is to get anything he wants to help him over the shock.
Keep her well fed, Harry, she deserves your love.
Draco does. He leaves, doesn’t even think of arguing as he takes shaky steps back, eyes never leaving Potter, the fury raging around him, the eyes boring into his chest, sharp and cutting and green like the

“Given the state it was in, I sincerely doubt you cared much about the couch.” A guess, based on values Draco doesn't think Potter holds. He should have realised sooner. Something flashes over Potter’s face, quick and dangerous, and because Draco is a moron with no self-preservation he doesn't do the reasonable thing — shut up and hope to be spared — but he talks on and makes the situation worse. “It would also have been
“You don’t understand it at all! You don’t know what it’s like, to be followed everywhere, to have the cameras hunting you for a picture, to praise you one day and shame you the next, for an entire country to depend on you and hate you, call you a liar and a fraught, drool over my scar like my mother didn’t
Potter clears his throat, the sound out of place and discordant, and Draco slips, the bow too heavy on the wrong strings and his melody drowning in a cacophony of noise.
“I won’t pretend not to be delighted at the prospect of stepping foot into that house again, it has always been beautiful and I shudder to think of what has become of it …” She trails off, lost in memories.
“Because he thought I hated that they have to die, and bringing them with a prison and clinging to earth conveniently made them immortal.” Draco didn’t understand that thought process at first — how could he have? It was based on the assumption of Draco caring about a plant’s lifeem. Which, and he can’t stress this enough, he doesn’t. Harry, the poor bloke, didn’t understand Draco’s dislike at all, or why his ingenious idea with the potted plants didn’t wondrously solve all their problems. Not even his stammering explanation, getting firmer and more insistent with every repetition, could change Draco’s mind.
“And the ferrets, man. Do I even have to say anything more than that?” Okay, Harry draws the line at
Surely, he is wrong? Draco cannot possibly be saying what Harry thinks he is saying. Harry would have noticed!
“Did you say chess, earlier?” Weasley asks, which is
“Leave, Malfoy.” Potter commands, voice cold, expecting to be obeyed. “This time, don’t come back.”
It’s perfect. It’s very characteristic for Potter, disrespecting every rule but with a result so spectacular that no one is obstinate enough to complain about that. Moreover, Potter looks happy. He looked happy in the first dress, too, but it was a more demure sort of happiness, behaviour appropriate to the clothes he was wearing. There is nothing demure about this—unseemly lengths of hairy legs exposed and a material that breaks with all tradition—and Potter revels in it, carefree as he twirls without tripping.
“Don’t blame your issues with Grimmauld on me, Potter.” Unbelievable, how Potter can stand there and still play the golden hero and make Draco responsible for everything. It’s typical Potter, nothing is ever his fault.
He knows Potter is smarter than that, though, because he went to school with the git for six years and because Potter smirks at him, a smirk that promises a repeat.
Potter frowns at his now empty hand like it personally offended him. Then he shakes his head, like he is trying to rid it of an image, and looks up at Draco, his smile dimmed.
“Are you kidding me? That owl would eat me alive if I stood still long enough! She is a glaring menace, who gets grumpy when I don’t feed her immediately when she demands and I

Their breathing is loud in the silence, the only sound audible.
They just need to get these bothersome trousers off of him, first.
with them?” Maybe not his most pressing concern at the moment, but a concern nonetheless.
“Just leave, give me a moment before you come and laugh at me, would you?” It’s a pathetic plea to Malfoy’s humanity — something Harry honestly isn’t sure is a real thing — and he immediately wishes he hadn’t said it. If there was a way to make this entire situation worse, that was it. Harry always had a penchant for disaster.
“If you hurt him, we will hurt you.” Granger catches his eyes, makes sure he understands how serious her threat is. Draco understands, he would do the same for his friends. He saw how much Granger cares, what she is willing to do for her friends—she doesn’t need eloquent threats or gory details to be terrifying.
He probably did, people can’t just express numerous facets of disdain in the curl of a lip without spending hours in front of a mirror. Malfoy must have dedicated years of his childhood learning how to smirk just right, going to his father for approval and getting advice on how to turn it a few notches nastier. It’s a family tradition, Harry is sure, passed on from one generation to the next, Malfoy learning from his father and then teaching their children — no! Mission abort!
“They can do this for hours.” Granger is resigned to her fate, not taking her eyes of them, perfectly blasé and composed.
“What about you, then? What do
Truth is defined over a raw quality that makes you vulnerable, that is
They lay like that for a while, Draco in his victory and Harry plotting his revenge — his head rests rather comfortably on Draco’s stomach after dropping there in defeat and Draco idly curls his fingers through his hair; Harry feels a tiny bid bad about scheming against him — until Draco grows restless again and he uses the grip on Harry’s hair to pull his head up.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise to Harry that Draco doesn’t see his friend as the threat to careful bliss that she is. After all, Draco grew up with her, invited her, doesn’t have any personal boundaries with her — Harry went over this a million times this evening alone, he
They don’t, though, and instead Draco gets the immeasurable joy of watching the silent conversation between a couple that spent too much time together for their conversations to be easily understood by outsiders. Draco used to watch his parents’ silent fights and feel smart and accomplished for understanding most of them. It never occurred to him that they simply weren’t the kind of couple to communicate by looks and subtle gestures. It was a cold day when Draco realised he didn’t have a special talent of observation.
“Ignoring me isn’t going to help you, you know? And don’t even try to change the topic, I need some updates on the Malfoy Situation.” Ginny throws popcorn at him to get his attention, which is not only rude but also totally unnecessary. Also, the Malfoy Situation? Is that what they call it now?
a good friend, but a vile double-agent, corrupted by the snake in his bed. He isn’t the least bit repentant about it, either; he wasn’t as he told Harry the
Weasley smirks at him, his eyebrows doing a complicated wriggling thing that is both reassuring and terrifying to see. Reassuring because Weasley evidently isn’t broken, and terrifying because whatever he is about to say, Draco does
Love? Did he swear that? He doesn’t remember. Their lawyers wouldn’t write up a clause about love, would they? Feelings are mushy, ambiguous things. You don’t base contracts on
“This is a lovely shop you have here, Potter,” Draco says instead and watches the way Potter blushes at the compliment.
“I … yes, of course, right this way.” Draco navigates them on autopilot, mind whirring and circling around that smile, warm and sincere and out of place on a face that should be consumed by disgust.
“Parkinson called me, she just wanted to know where I got that badger from because they can’t be legally sold as pets in the UK and she was worried. Then I watched her bust an animal smugglers ring and called the Aurors while she frightened them all into giving up their associates. It was
I have no idea what you are playing at, but if you are calling me uncivilised I’ll have you know that I’m perfectly capable of talking in dusted phrases; I just choose not to. Does my rudeness shock you?

“You mean if you possessed more empathy than you like to admit and ached for Potter and his fate? If you raged against the entire world on his behalf more fearsomely than you did on your own? If you wanted for him to spend his time free of pain and sorrow and smiling at you?” Blaise doesn’t even have the decency to look away, staring Draco right in the eyes and keeping contact as he speaks his truths like knives.
