Harry poured them both a cup of coffee and they settled at the kitchen table. The tension hadn’t quite left Draco yet, but it was a little better. Harry ducked out to get dressed quickly, opting for his oldest pair of jeans and a well-worn t-shirt. They mostly worked in silence for a while, both starting on a different case. Draco was working on the Death Eater safe house and Harry was working on their paperwork for the kidnapping case. They only asked each other questions occasionally.
Her name was Rosella Young and she was feisty. She actually reminded Harry of himself a little before he learned to (somewhat) control his temper. Her parents had wanted her to pursue a nice and safe career but she had hated every second of it. So after a few years of doing that, she’d decided she was now going to try things her way.
‘I know that. He was just always the one to remind me to eat and then I’d make us go home at a reasonable time because I wanted to make sure
!’ Harry jabbed his finger in Malfoy’s direction, but he dodged it handily.
With the quiet moments the paperwork was so tedious and boring it made Harry go cross-eyed. His focus would drift and drift and drift until he had been staring at the same page for ten minutes and hadn’t registered a single thing that was written on it.
‘They’re not
The Atrium was bustling as usual, but Harry didn’t stop to look around. He just hurried towards the elevators, keeping his pace brisk and his eyes forward, daring anyone to try and stop him. He headed down to where the Wizengamot was.

, so he’d gone back down the rickety stairs careful not to touch anything and now he’d been standing near the front door for the last few minutes, trying to decide if he was walking out of there or not.
for research than Harry did, he was more methodical. Harry would argue he had better instincts than Draco did, but for what they were doing now? Draco was a better fit.
‘We’ll Apparate into the Ministry, I can wear my Auror coat for the rest of the day.’ Harry tried to reassure him. He was pretty sure Draco also had his Auror coat in the office, but neither of them seemed to want to mention that.
‘Oh bloody hell.’ He marched towards him. ‘Sit still, I’ll do it.’ Draco muttered a few unpleasant things under his breath but he didn’t actually argue. Harry peeled his button up off. It was completely ruined, which was a shame, Harry loved this pale blue colour on Draco. Maybe he’d buy him a new one.
‘Ron, we’ve talked about this before Harry went and testified for him.’ Hermione started. ‘I know how much he hurt me, but
. He usually did, but there was something about the gold with Malfoy’s skin colour that made him look silver.
Their next course was The Auror Advantage and Harry felt like his soul was about to fall from his body. He couldn’t focus. He’d had three cups of coffee and instead of waking him up like they usually did, they just made him feel like his brain was bouncing around uselessly in his skull. Like he wanted to bounce his leg and drum his fingers but his muscles just didn’t want to cooperate. Malfoy took one look at him and dragged him towards the back of the small conference room that they were to have today’s course in.
‘Could you get me some towels and lukewarm water, Kreacher? My friend here is hurt.’
‘I’m always careful, Hermione.’ Both Ron and Neville burst out laughing at that. ‘What? I am!’ Harry said indignantly. He knew he wasn’t, he never had been, but it was so nice to hear them laugh, he wanted to make sure that he could hear it a little longer. Sure enough, even Hermione joined in. Harry found himself smiling as he looked at his friends.
. He was going to see him again, in the flesh, he was going to be here.
It was amazing. The image was basically just the solid black silhouettes of a stag and a doe. They were running, looking free and happy and wild and Harry loved it. There was a joy to the way they moved that made him feel a little chocked up. He looked up at Missy.
‘Yes, I was a Gryffindor, but I could have been a Slytherin as well. The houses aren’t black and white. Most people are a little bit of all of them and that’s good.’ He said with a smile.
‘Yes, yes, Kreacher can heal Master Harry’s bleeding friend before he gets blood on the upholstery.’ Kreacher nodded, his big ears flopping back and forth.
‘I didn’t know that.’
‘It’s a talent?’ Harry offered and Malfoy looked at him, horrified. ‘Look, Minister, in your own words, I am an expert in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Malfoy is an expert in the Dark Arts. That could be very valuable, no? Or is there anyone else in the department who could give you the information he could?’ Harry asked innocently. Several mouths dropped open and Shacklebolt’s eyes narrowed.
Some good news, maybe this was exactly what he needed. Maybe this would help him get out of his slump. They sat there for a while, just smiling at each other and Harry felt calmer than he had since Draco left.
smiled at anyone else, but he smiled at Harry all the time. He would never have gone out of his way to get an owl for Ron for a
‘We will now deliberate.’ Minister Shacklebolt said before casting a Imperturbable Charm around the Wizengamot.
‘Of course not.’ Malfoy said with an eyeroll. ‘Just a small dash of a Calming Draught to counteract all of the horrible coffee you drank.’ Harry wanted to ask how he even knew Harry had drank all of that coffee, he hadn’t even been there, but Malfoy was already moving on. ‘I don’t think you missed much, this seemed like things you knew already. Except for the part where they said to strike whenever given the opportunity and not try to “discuss” until they were in custody.’
‘Fine, but I reserve the right to tell you “I told you so” when things go tits up with him.’
Everything finally went into focus and Harry just had time to register two pale hands pulling away from him with familiar long, slim fingers. Draco.
Spells slammed into Harry’s Protego, but stopped once Draco fired back a rapid burst of Stunners and Exploders of his own. Whoever these attackers were, they did know what they were doing. After a dead out sprint, Harry skidded to a halt next to Amelia.
‘Oh, well, I thought- um, you and Malfoy. I was talking to Amelia the other day and she kind of made it sound like you two were- um- not just partners.’ Young was looking at the ceiling now, still blushing scarlet. ‘I thought, well, he turned out to be bad anyways, but he’s your type, so I might be too.’ Harry knew he was gaping at her, he just didn’t seem to remember how to close his mouth. ‘I’ll just- I’ll just go get us some tea. Do you want tea? I’ll get you some tea.’ She fled from the office before he could answer.
, Ron.’ Harry said. ‘And again, I’m never going to tell you that you have to forgive him, or that you have to be his friend or invite him for dinner, but you can
‘Yes sir.’ Robards left the door open as he disappeared and Harry made a face at Draco.
‘Like take over the Wizarding World with your brilliance.’ Harry grinned, okay, maybe not his best word choice ever, but Hermione didn’t seem to mind. She just grinned at him.
was gone, he realized how bad it had been. How wrong it had felt not to be on good terms with Draco.
‘Of course. I will tell them.’ Amelia smiled and then turned to Harry. ‘You take good care of him now.’
They almost ran into Robards who immediately started barking orders.
‘Not even Death Eaters went this far, huh?’
‘And the dramatic speech in there?’ Malfoy asked, still not taking the damn wand back. Harry’s arm was starting to protest. ‘How long did it take Granger to write that one?’
‘Oh please. In case you didn’t know,’ Harry put on his most self-important, annoying voice. ‘I’m Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived Twice. And I have quite a lot of sway with the Headmistress, she was my Head of House, you know.’ Draco’s smile turned into a full blown grin.
is a plan.’ Malfoy said as he pulled out his wand. ‘We need to get back to the offices without Apparating or using the Floo network. We have an hour. I say we just walk in the front door, they won’t expect that.’
, when he was forced to make an impossible choice. I know
‘You’re doing it again.’ Malfoy said as he handed over his parchment and snatched Harry’s from his hand. ‘That thing where you pretend we’re friends and we didn’t actively try to kill each other.’
think so, but we’re not.’ Malfoy snapped. ‘It’s not a “stupid Pureblood thing”. You did not just keep me out of Azkaban, but my mother and my friends too. You made sure I knew I could take my NEWTs, you gave me an idea for a job and then you helped me get a fair shot at the tests, you keep helping me, and you wanting nothing in return is nonsense. The world doesn’t work like that.’
They seemed to fall back into their previous work rhythm with ease.
Draco pulled back a little, resting his forehead against Harry’s.
‘Come on, I’m hungry.’ Harry started walking again. He couldn’t stop himself from smiling. He was just… happy. It was his day off, he’d gotten his first tattoo, Draco was here, the sun was out. It was a good day.
‘Sure, we could invite Amelia and Ron.’ Harry agreed, but judging by her face that wasn’t the answer she’d been gunning for. She was so much easier to read than Drac-
something has changed.’ She took a deep breath. ‘But things are better as well. The houses are actually more kind towards each other, even Slytherin, although that is a work in progress, what you said has really been taken to heart.’ She smiled at him.
‘As sweet as that is, that doesn’t count.’
‘I do remember her mentioning something like that. Do you mind?’ He asked. Amelia glanced at Malfoy.
?’ Draco asked with an uncharacteristic stutter. ‘I don’t know what to do with a child.’ His grey eyes were wide and he looked horrified. Harry rolled his eyes.
‘Get it together, Potter.’ Malfoy snapped at him. Drawing Harry from his mild panic spiral.
‘Awesome. Congrats Ron.’ Harry said as Hermione threw herself at Ron with an excited squeal. Harry turned to Neville when Hermione kissed Ron on the mouth, that was not something he needed to see. ‘What about you Neville? You got an O for Herbology, right?’
‘I’ve been there before, but I don’t quite remember why. The name is familiar though.’ Draco said as he followed the road into the town. It looked like it was the small town’s main road, there were little shops marked alongside it.
. He’s never, not even once yelled at me for being a fidgety bloody arsehole and we both know I can be.’ Hermione came back from the kitchen with a steaming plate of her pasta parmesan and Harry practically inhaled the first bite. Shit he hadn’t realized he was hungry.
In their cubicles there had always been other sound going on. Others working, mail coming in, going out, cases being discussed, talks in the break room. It was never quiet. Their office was on the other hand was very quiet and that made Harry’s fidgeting always the loudest thing in the room. He tapped his pens, bounced his leg and did pretty much every other annoying thing that would mean he wouldn’t have to sit still.

), it had been at Hogwarts where there was the Yule Ball or Hogsmeade weekends. With Ginny it had just kind of… happened. Ginny hadn’t expected much and there had been
‘Yep.’ Harry said. ‘Do you know which one?’
.’ Harry laughed and smiled fondly at her.
‘No I don’t. I
It was a good thing Harry had come prepared. Contrary to popular belief, he did actually listen when people talked, and Tonks had mentioned this class sometime before- before- before she died. Harry stumbled as they headed down another small street.
‘Nah uh, you can’t call me Potter anymore.’
‘Oh.’ Harry said. ‘You want me to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts?’
Harry felt himself relax once Robards came to tell them that the Auror duo would both be perfectly fine. There had been some spell damage to Ron, but the Healers had dealt with it fairly easily and Amelia had also been patched up. They were going to release Amelia in about an hour, that was also when they’d decide if they would keep Ron overnight or let him go as well. Harry nodded in thanks. Robards headed back to the office to update everyone else.
He shuffled into the kitchen and glanced at the clock. Only 9am, well, for how late they had been up, that wasn’t too bad. He started the coffee machine. No matter how many times he tried, he just couldn’t make coffee with magic quite like he could make it the muggle way.
‘It’s
‘So, you were still up? Dawlish send you a message?’ Harry nodded.
‘Oh, uh. I don’t know, maybe?’
Harry instead of just making him feel like an idiot.
His biggest problem here was: he had no idea what to do about it.
‘Is this some sort of stupid Pureblood thing? Like a life debt or something, because I don’t want anything from you. As far as I’m concerned we’re even.’ Harry couldn’t quite control the flare of annoyance, why did Malfoy always have to make everything so damn complicated?
‘Well hello Potter. I suppose I missed you too.’ Draco mumbled as he settled his arms around Harry.
‘Of course. Do you have a way to let your mother know?’ He asked and Draco nodded.
‘And what if I’m not planning on going home until Ron goes home?’
Together they formed the first Post Second War graduating class. They were all given the title of Junior Auror and the Head Auror, Robards, would decide when they would be promoted to fully-fledged Aurors.
‘I didn’t even like the first part.’
‘Potter,’ Robards said dangerously. ‘there’s nothing here.’
“Yes, of course.” Draco nods in an attempt at innocence, but the hunger in his expression says otherwise.
Unlike those times however, it’s been far too long since Harry’s been able to do this properly with Draco. They fell asleep straight away after slipping quietly into bed together the night before. The ache of missing Draco and the happiness of having him back settles deep in Harry’s bones. There’s time enough for languid mornings and bringing one another to the brink before pulling back and building towards a climax all over again. Today, he just wants to spend the day in bed, getting used to being together in a fresh new world where they can say the kind of things they’ve never been able to articulate until now.
“Yes.” Draco sits back in his chair and rubs his eyes. He was so engrossed in his book, the story combined with the warmth of the heating charms almost led him to forget where he was. “Not that you strike me as the sort to care about interrupting people.”
“I thought the Ministry was all about reform these days.” Millie pulls a face. “They’re pretty behind the times if you ask me.”
“You must be desperate if you need my help.” Draco stands and busies himself rearranging an already perfectly organised stack of wands, in a vain attempt to keep his thoughts from straying beyond business. Looking at Harry head on tends to lead his mind in a decidedly non-business-like direction. “Aren’t you supposed to be educating your protégés by telling them about your heroic conquests?”
“Interesting.” Draco moves his fingers over Harry’s wrist, touching the spot where his pulse beats. He pushes Harry’s arm above his head and captures his lips in another deep kiss. “Did you mean it before?”
Harry rolls his eyes. “I’m not here to talk about interest rates or whatever the fuck it is you do. Are you going to let me help, or aren’t you?”
“As if I would.” Harry grins, despite himself. “I can’t imagine you with a cheese and onion toastie, watching a film. Not that they’d even work, here.”
This time I want specifics.
“That’s alright then.” Harry rolls his eyes and shoves his glasses back on. He grabs one of Draco’s forms and leaves his coffee cup on the desk, before making his way to the door. “For the record, I wouldn’t be here if I thought you’d go blabbing to the press. Things have changed haven’t they, Malfoy?”
“You have all the maturity of a ripe Mandrake, Potter.” Draco rolls his eyes. He stands again and moves to the window, watching his former classmates dancing under the magical fairy lights that look like stars. “Why on earth would somebody trying to escape attention buy a flat in the main wizarding shopping street above the busiest nightclub in town?”
“You’re still a decent flier I suppose.” Draco shoots Harry a quick smile, unlacing his boots. “Not as good as me, obviously.”
Draco slides his tongue against Harry’s, his head spinning at the way their kisses are equal parts fierce and tender. They kiss like the incoming tide, the ebb, the crest and the crash bringing them surging together. Draco fists a hand into Harry’s ridiculous, soft hair and gives as good as he gets. He’s not going to sink into Harry’s delicious kisses with a whimper and a tremble. He’s Draco fucking Malfoy and clearly there’s a peculiar part of Potter that gets a kick out of that. He slides his hands over Harry’s chest, down to his belly and lower still, feverishly working open Harry’s jeans. He shoves his hand inside and groans with appreciation when his fingers wrap around Harry’s substantial prick.
“I hate all that saviour, Boy Who Lived stuff. People expect me to be perfect.” Harry's mouth works over Draco’s neck, his hands sliding over the curve of Draco’s backside. “I’m not. I can’t half be a wanker sometimes.”
“It looks like snow.” Harry’s familiar voice startles Draco. “Were you busy?”
Draco rolls his eyes. Harry’s famous, but he’s hardly a celebrity. He hasn’t been anything for the last three years other than absent. His hand twitches towards his wand wondering what the fuck Harry was going to say before they were rudely interrupted.
“Are you sure?” Harry swallows around the lump in his throat.
outside.
“I’m not sure it’s going to do much. Not at the minute. The last thing I want is people getting in trouble on my account.” Harry sighs, peering over George’s shoulder. “Can I come inside?”
Draco doesn’t need asking twice. He moves his hand from Harry’s hair, muttering another lubricating charm. He wraps a slick hand around Harry’s cock and thrusts into him. He takes his time, using Harry’s body to give himself every last bit of pleasure. He makes sure Harry doesn’t come, getting the position just right but making sure it doesn’t take him over the edge.
“Did she tell you that?” Harry looks up, startled. It probably isn’t the best idea for Draco to make it sound as though his parents spend supper cursing Potter’s survival. He suspects by the end it was a relief, for them both.
, his brain sing-songs.
Harry takes a quick gulp of his beer and looks at Lee, whose jaw works. If he was annoyed before, he’s even more unhappy now.
“Give over.” Harry nearly spits out his wine, laughing as Draco glares at him. “You were horny. It’s hardly like you’re a criminal mastermind.”
“Bars, clubs, drag nights, music, saunas. All sorts. It’s all much more open in the Muggle world. I imagine it was far harder when it was illegal in the Muggle world, too, but even then people managed, wizards and Muggles alike. We’ve been here all the time.”
“I didn’t let you do anything,” Draco snaps. “I assumed you’d read your own legislation and you kissed me first. Doing something wrong is a thrill for lots of people. You wouldn’t be the first to get off on an illicit moment of pleasure, trust me. It’s how I ended up in Azkaban. Don’t turn this around as if I’m to blame.”
“I’m so sorry, Harry.” Ginny can hardly speak through her tears, the flames of the fire flickering and the logs hissing and spitting. “George said it was awful.”
“Splendid, thanks so much for asking.” Draco definitely sounds like he’s smiling now, and it gives Harry a little thrill to know he’s lightened the mood between them.
“I wouldn’t know the first thing about art,” Harry confesses. “It’s more modern than I expected.”
“You’re not.” Molly begins to cry, her hands shaking as Arthur soothes her. His face is the same, implacable mask. “No, Harry. You can’t be. It’s not right, it’s not
“Yeah, I was.” Harry smiles and the heat behind his gaze warms the winter air. “But other things are worth persevering with too.”
They stroke one another faster and firmer until Harry comes with a grunt of pleasure and Draco follows shortly after. Sticky and sweaty, Harry hauls Draco close and kisses him hard enough to hurt. Draco responds with equal ferocity until eventually the kisses calm and gentle. Even the soft kisses are good, the sting of the biting kisses from before making Harry’s lips tingle pleasantly.
“Do we have to do this on the doorstep?” Harry pushes a hand through his damp hair. “It’s pissing it down.”
Draco doesn’t respond, watching Harry make tea without asking if he can have some. Harry makes him one anyway, shoving it across the counter hard enough that some of the liquid spills over the rim. A tiny splash of milk, two sugars. Strong and sweet, just how Draco likes it.
“I’m going to have to tell them, Gin.” Harry wishes he could step through the fire and speak to Ginny face to face. He wishes he could hold her close and breathe in her warm, familiar scent. “Your mum and dad are going to ask all sorts, and who knows what your dad’s going to find out through Ministry gossips. I owe them the truth.”
“A word of advice for
“He wouldn’t do that, would you pal?” Harry lets the Bowtruckle move onto his palm, where it seems quite content to nestle.
“I’d avoid the bars in Knockturn if I were you, at least for the time being.” Ginny gives Harry an encouraging smile. “You can come to Cardiff and spend time with me and Millie. Nobody from the Ministry ever bothers with Wales.”
“It does not.” Harry rolls his eyes. “Azkaban has been completely refurbished and there are strict regulations in place to protect the prisoners.”
“My dear boy. What on earth happened?” Arthur pulls a seat out for Harry and Molly begins piling food onto his plate. “Tell us everything. I couldn’t believe it when I heard. Kingsley’s been walking around the place with a face like thunder, the Aurors keep
“You’re firing me?” Harry swallows, his chest tight.
Draco stops checking in at every second opportunity and licks, sucks and pushes into Harry until his limbs are shaky. When he pulls back, Harry groans at the loss.
“I don’t know.” Harry shrugs. “I don’t want any unsolicited Evaporates, but it was fun, wasn’t it? I won’t be able to have overnight visitors at the school during term time and they’re also dead strict about when staff can stay elsewhere. I had to get permission from McGonagall for this weekend.”
“I can’t believe it.” Ginny chokes back a sob. “I knew they could be set in their ways—mum’s so
That’s inane.
“I’ve been trying to work up to a big reveal all week,” Harry continues. “It’s why I went to the shop on Friday, but you were closed for lunch. Not that there’s much revealing left to do.” He smirks and gives Draco’s crotch a pointed look.
“I’m sorry.” Ginny’s voice wavers, her body deathly still beside Harry. “I—I never wanted to hurt you.”
“It’s what family does.” Ginny gives Harry a soft smile and he notices the shine of a necklace fashioned into a
“Good.” Harry grins, taking in Ron’s appearance. “You look very—”
“I will. I already have.” Harry finishes his sandwich and takes his plate to the sink, as Ginny and Millie go to collect their things.
Lee sighs. “Fine. I’m off to find Earless, see if he wants to do some shots.”
“The Broom Regulatory Department?” Harry stares at Kingsley whose expression is furious. “Is he fucking kidding?”
. He doesn’t look angry or sad. Just blank. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen Arthur so utterly emotionless. “You can’t just be
Harry snorts with laughter. “Yeah, right. We’ll see how that goes. I’m not going to live like a monk, Malfoy.”
and tucks it carefully inside his drawer.
“Harry,” Kingsley warns.
“I couldn’t give a fuck about your boring sex life,” Draco bites back. “I try not to think about it at all.”
“Nowhere at all.” Harry reaches out a hand and Draco crosses the room quickly, leaving his towels on the floor and slipping under the sheets. “Still using as many towels as possible?”
“American?” Ron glances across the room, his expression turning fond. “’Mione said the same thing. It’s so I blend in.”
Harry pushes into Draco with one quick motion, holding his body firm as he undulates his hips without pulling out. Draco’s cry leaves him with a punch, and he huffs out a sharp breath at the initial fullness. His forehead beads with sweat and he keeps still for a moment to adjust to the unfamiliar stretch and burn of being taken.
. Even if nobody else gets wind of the reason Harry left without so much as a word to anyone, Ron will have to be informed of the truth as Co-Head Auror. There’s no doubt in Harry’s mind that Robards will give him the full story.
“With difficulty. I’ll tell you another time.” Hermione’s expression softens and in one quick step she’s across the living room and holding Harry in a warm hug. “Oh Harry,” she sniffles. “
“Yeah, that’s the one. Had a thing for Angelina Johnson. Best mates with the Weasley twins.”
“Sorry.” Harry winces, as if registering his error. “This club’s still shit,” he continues. It’s understandable he would be eager to change the conversation to something less volatile than the time Draco went to prison and nearly lost his mind. “I thought they would have fixed the sign.”
“I used to be so terrified whenever I thought about you.” Draco breaks the silence, his voice thin.
They probably thought we’d use their dating service for sharing pictures of something other than our dicks.
“They didn’t
Frowning, Harry follows Robards into his office. Kingsley and a witch Harry vaguely recognises from Magical Person Resources are already there, grim and serious. Robards shuts the door with a sharp flick of his wand and gestures for Harry to take a seat at the end of the long table.
“The practical side is easy. The theory is harder.” Harry shrugs. “I’ve never been one for books. Besides, I’ve always hated leveraging off my name and I want to do things properly. It’s already an unusual enough situation and there’s still plenty I can learn. You know how quickly kids can lose respect for staff. The last thing I want is for someone in the press to insinuate I got the job because of my personal relationships as opposed to my knowledge when the time comes.”
“I’d never have forced you to tell your mum and dad or told people without your permission.” Harry winces, realising in his hot-headed moments he probably hasn’t handled things as well as he might. He does tend to be impatient. “I just wanted you to tell my friends we were together.
“I’ve never had a relationship before.” Draco pushes a hand through his hair and pointedly doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes. “I’ve already told you I don’t know how to do any of this. When it’s all one-night stands and anonymous sex, people make assumptions.”
Draco shrugs. “I started choosing pieces that I knew father would find obnoxious, then I grew to like the style.”
“How’s Malfoy?” Ginny’s question pulls Harry from his thoughts, guilt making him instantly defensive.
“Whether or not you believe it, I want to help.” Harry puts Draco’s papers down with more force than necessary, opening the file. “Although I suppose your parents have already thrown around oodles of money trying to get you out of here.”
“He hasn’t been out at all since the arrest?” Harry keeps his tone casual, but the thought that Draco might not have been going out for other reasons makes his heart kick. He resolves to speak to Draco about Knockturn. He doesn’t like the idea of Draco with other wizards, but he doesn’t want him to think he can’t see his friends.
“Some of them need to work on their Glamours that’s for sure.” Draco sighs. “If you want dancing
she said,
“About Sunday.” Draco leans imperceptibly closer to Harry. “The club will be…completely empty?”
Harry swallows, his initial irritation replaced with confusion. “I thought you wanted the new legislation. I voted for it, on your recommendation.”
“Not even I’m that nosy.” Harry holds up the book. “You left this out. I didn’t know you used Quick-Match.”
“I know.” Harry shoots Draco a wry smile. “Finding a replacement for a dying wand isn’t like choosing your wand for the first time though, is it? It’s more like having a favourite pair of Quidditch socks and trying to replace them with someone else’s sweaty socks from the lost property box.”
“A fair amount. Stop being such a judgmental prick.”
“There’s someone for you too,” Millie says, quietly. “Even Malfoy’s got to be better than living a lie. At least you fancy him.”
“Potter is a very persuasive man,” Draco replies smoothly. The comment makes Harry think of all sorts of filthy things, and he takes a shaky breath he pushes a hand through his hair. He takes a gulp of his pint before noticing Lee and George are both giving him very strange looks.
“I wouldn’t.” A wave of fury at the reminder of Robards and his peculiar, tight smile almost makes Harry spill his tea. “I didn’t even look at it.”
“I see.” Draco’s voice is low and surprisingly comforting. “If you want a bit of advice, stop trying to fight it. It’s better when you do.”
“Is that why you have the cinema room?” Harry rests his hand on Draco’s chest, watching him as he speaks. “I assumed it was something you made for yourself.”
fine with Ron, whatever Hermione says.
“Thanks very much,” Harry mutters.
“You read my mind.” Draco slides his hand down to Harry’s waist, keeping his own voice quiet and smooth. “Don’t bother showering.”
The witch’s quill moves rapidly in the air, taking detailed notes. Harry knows from his experience disciplining junior Aurors that a note-taking Magical Person Resources employee in a meeting is never a good sign. He looks down at the piece of parchment and swallows thickly at the exact copy of Draco’s letter from the day before.
Harry snorts with laughter and slides his fingers from Draco’s body, slicking his cock. He overdoes the lube to the point where Draco begins complaining about wet patches on the clean bedsheets and then shuts him up relatively quickly by pushing into him with one hard stroke.
“No.” Harry’s chest tightens, and he changes the topic of conversation quickly. “You had a nice holiday?”
Draco hates the notion of finding oneself, because it implies something lost or waiting to be discovered. Draco knew exactly who he was during those messy, tumultuous years of racing around the globe. That was part of the problem. Even the first taste of another man, mingling with the salty sea-spray from Fire Island’s shores and the icy, cool sweetness of rum and Coke simply affirmed what he already knew. If anything, Draco’s travels left him even more adrift. His wealth combined with the hot-headedness of youth, heightening his arrogant determination to live like a Muggle and leave the magical world that despised him far behind. Malfoys have never been good at humility. The thought of swallowing his pride and staying grimly silent when confronted with the judgment of the wizarding world held no appeal.
“I used a lot of things as an excuse to avoid having that conversation.” Draco wets his lips. “I didn’t know how to be the kind of man you wanted.”
, Harry thinks.
“Stop that. I’m going to get soaked.” Draco stands and the weird bubble disappears with a flick of his wand. He moves closer towards the open door, an attempt to get away from the hail. “I should’ve brought lager. I know you hate wine.”
. Unfortunately for Draco, the bigger concern is that the one person he wants to be with is standing right in front of him and blissfully unaware of any of Draco’s inner turmoil. “I should have everything I need. Unless I hear otherwise, I’ll expect you on Saturday at nine o’clock sharp.”
When his evening is disturbed by a knock on the door, Harry knows exactly who he’s going to find waiting impatiently outside.
“Probably not.” Harry drops Draco’s belt to the floor and tugs the lobe of his ear between his teeth, drawing a ragged moan that goes straight to Harry’s cock. “But maybe one day it will be.”
“Shut up,” Draco mutters. “Go on then, take a look if you must.”
“Get away or run away?”
“In part. Because of Azkaban, too.” Draco looks at Harry, his face pale. “They want me in prison. Me, more than most. You know that as well as I do. It’s not as though I need to be caught
, of course I bloody heard,” Harry growls.
“Just a bit.” Harry checks there’s no one in earshot and speaks quietly. “You’re gay?”
“You had your cock in my arse half an hour ago,” Draco points out. He’s enjoying seeing Harry squirm. “That seems more intimate.”
Harry immediately grabbed a piece of parchment and started scribbling. Draco sighed and pushed himself off his chair.
‘I don’t like seeing you get hurt.’ Draco sounded like he pushed it out through clenched jaws.
‘It’s not manipulation, it’s just encouragement in a way that would appeal to you.’ Malfoy raised his eyebrows like he didn’t see the difference. ‘Just think about it.’ Harry held his hands out to the side. ‘The sign up for Auror training is in a week. You have to come to the Auror offices and sign in and then they do character and aptitude tests and they decide who will be allowed to start the training programme.’
“That’s not what I—” Harry breaks off, a strange heat crawling through him. He doesn’t know why he hates talking about this so much. He’s starting to worry he’s a bit of a dickhead after all.
Harry takes the armchair, not wanting to sit closer than necessary. In the past it would have been difficult to put any space between them and now that’s all there is. Seeing Draco on his sofa brings the memory of their first time surging into Harry’s mind with unstoppable force. He can almost taste the breathy kisses and feel the press and curve of Draco’s smile against his skin. It felt as though they had all the time in the world to explore one another, sticky, sweaty and sweet. When they were just starting out it was so good between them.
“You too.” Lee gives Harry a brittle smile. It makes Harry wonder if he’s pissed off that it’s been so long since Harry last came out with them. Lee’s usually affable, funny and as laid back as George. It’s not like him to be on edge, and his peculiar mood takes Harry by surprise. “How’s the Ministry?”
“I’m going to the bar to buy shots. Merlin knows I’m going to need them.” Draco gets up and goes to the bar, not quickly enough that Harry doesn’t catch his cloudy expression.
“Sure, Malfoy.” Harry grins and takes off his glasses, sending them to the bedside table with a flick of his wand. He reaches for Draco who comes willingly.
“Yes.” Draco’s lips curve. “It really wasn’t all bad, Potter. I had a tremendous amount of fun. I worked at Gringotts and kept my head down during the week, then I went to Manchester during the weekends. The Aurors weren’t half as interested in trying to weed us out as they have been since the law changed, so they never bothered with any of the bars outside of London.”
“I have an enormous ego that requires constant reassurance,” Draco replies.
As unhappy as he’s been at times without the adrenaline of new cases to keep him occupied, the good times have outweighed the darker moments. Countless visits to The Wandering Thestral and kissing Draco in the middle of a dance floor in Muggle Manchester have been particular highlights. He doesn’t want to lose the way that blissful, heady moment of freedom felt. Not for anything.
just loud enough to be audible. Bettering himself is still a work in progress.
“I remember,” Harry replies. “I understand you didn’t want loads of people knowing, but you couldn’t even be honest with
I’ve got audio.
“I can’t believe it.” Ginny’s cheeks turn red and she shakes her head. “How on earth does Hermione get away with it and not you?”
“Of course.” Harry tries to keep his voice level. The two men in the huge, black and white photograph are entwined together. He tries not to linger on the curve of the men's arses, or the way they clutch onto one another, suspended in an intimate dance. “It’s…nice.”
“I hope to Salazar you didn’t bed me for flattery.” Draco watches Harry take two t-shirts from a full drawer of clothes and he pulls a face at the one thrown in his direction. “Seriously?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “I’m trying to make conversation. As entertaining as it might be to sit here glaring at one another, I’m afraid it could get boring after a while.”
“I want you to tell me. Whatever the reason.”
“Is it?” Harry’s mouth seeks out Draco’s with another deep searching kiss. “I really hadn’t noticed.”
“Too right,” Harry mutters. “Ron left because he wanted to work with George. It’s a lot more fun than getting
“Coffee,” Draco decides. He should probably avoid any more alcohol in case Harry fancies apparating them to any other rooms in the flat. “No milk, no sugar.”
“Being close to a man such as Draco Malfoy is a very unwise choice for a Head Auror.” Robards pauses. “I have concerns about the nature of your relationship.”
Harry takes off his socks and sits next to Draco, stretching his legs out. Draco watches him with a small smile on his face.
“I’m not going to start arresting people,” Harry scoffs. The last thing he wants to do is call attention to himself. Not to mention he’s never been fond of adhering to rules when they’re rubbish ones.
“You enjoyed working with trainee Aurors and people always need to brush up on their magic. Even Gringotts constantly turns talented witches and wizards away because they don’t have strong enough spell casting abilities. We’re not like the Muggles with their pens and computers. Have you ever been on the Gringotts trading floor? Currency Conversion and Statistic Charms all over the damn place.”
Oh, okay. His brain did not appreciate that. The little light that was coming through his curtains did not feel good at all. His head was pounding. Like there were a whole bunch of Centaurs running around his head. Not fun. A good reminder why he didn’t usually drink much. He groaned as he swung his feet over the edge of the bed.
. The first week or so after he’d been back, they’d been fine, but then slowly but surely, he seemed to get more… angry. Angry at Harry and he just couldn’t figure out what he’d done
‘Yes, just that one today.’ Harry nodded. The two of them had exchanged a few messages talking about what exactly Harry wanted and somehow he’d ended up with ideas for far more than just one. Draco seemed surprised by this.
‘Well, I suppose that seems like a good deal.’ Draco got up off his chair and leaned back against his desk. ‘Do you want to guess where it is?’ Harry pursed his lips, he had a pretty good idea.
‘Is that so, mister Malfoy?’ Minister Shacklebolt asked. Harry could feel Ron’s tension next to him. Oh Merlin, Harry had really wormed himself into a tight corner now.
‘So, this is the flat of the Saviour of the Wizarding World, huh?’ Draco asked, looking around Harry’s apartment as he sauntered in. It was his first time here and Harry had actually managed to add Draco to the wards without him realizing it. ‘I was expecting something more-‘
‘Did Missy tell you?’
Ron was… Ron. He was trying to protect Harry, but he’d never been particularly good at putting himself in other people’s shoes.
‘Why does everyone hate my clothes?’
‘You are a strange creature, Harry Potter.’
‘I never did like Potions.’ Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry made Ron and Amelia promise to tell them what happened tomorrow, after they’d all gotten some rest.
‘I know.’ Harry assured him. ‘Go.’ He said just as a Bombarda hit their cover and it shook dangerously. Draco bit out the command for the Portkey to take him to St Mungo’s. It was almost like those steely grey eyes stayed behind a little longer just to stare at him threateningly.
‘Hello Blaise, Draco invited his good friend Harry Potter today, isn’t that fun!’ Parkinson grinned. Zabini didn’t look like he thought it was “fun” at all. Not even a little bit, in fact. Only a few seconds later Daphne Greengrass walked through the doors. She was the first that didn’t look absolutely shocked at seeing Harry in the parlour of Malfoy Manor.
‘That just so happens to be the same as mine.’ Malfoy added with a smirk. He had taken off the red robe, but he’d left the waistcoat on and he looked
.’ Harry pointed out and Ron sighed.
‘Oh.’ Harry recognized her. ‘Parkinson.’ She grinned.
‘I will need to take down the wards, you should not try to go through them they would hurt you.’ Draco said firmly.
‘It’s amazing.’ Harry didn’t want to assume anything, but Draco didn’t take his tattoos lightly. ‘I should probably show you mine.’ Harry threw his robes over a nearby chair, earning him an unimpressed look from Draco. Harry ignored him and pulled off his shirt. Draco’s eyes dropped to his chest. Harry could see the exact moment he picked out the new tattoo.
‘Are we?’
‘Well, because people always just assumed that’s what I would go and do, I never really looked further either. First there was just so bloody much going on. There was a war and people dying and fighting for my life and then dying but not quite dying and then suddenly I was an adult and I was tired of making hard decisions and so I didn’t think about it, I just did what people always assumed I would do.’
‘Oh did he now?’ Her expression went a little calculating. ‘When did he do that?’
Thank you for all the lovely comments, I really appreciate it!
‘What are you on about, Potter?’ Malfoy asked. His shoulders were still pressed against the wall, but Harry could have sworn he looked a little less tense.
Draco had gone to get a tattoo on Saturday, while Harry’s appointment was on Sunday. It had been a bit of a surprise when Draco told him he was getting another tattoo. Ever since Harry had started with his first one, he hadn’t really stopped, but in all those years, Draco had never given any indication he wanted to get more than just the dragon on his back.
’ Ron asked and his jaw dropped open. Ginny was the only one who didn’t look surprised.
He was going to work, catching the bad ones and making sure the good ones went home. Most of the time, he succeeded. Other times he found himself with blood all over his hands and the voice in the back of his head screaming “too slow, you were too slow, you didn’t work hard enough and now they’re dead”. He found himself on the doorstep of parents whose children weren’t coming home, on the doorstep of spouses whose loved ones were severely injured.
to owe you, Potter.’
‘No, absolutely not.’
‘Harry-‘
‘For being there when I came back.’
‘I have it together.’ He snapped back before forcing himself to take a deep breath. ‘Look, both of us are much too recognizable, we need to do something about that.’
He was glad he’d gotten his face back under control when Ron came bounding out into the sunshine.
Their days were long, spend digging through lists of Portkey requests to find the singular one made by a fugitive wizard, through lists of potions sales looking for an incredibly specific combination of ingredients and searching an entire house top to bottom looking for a singular golden ring that had been Transfigured into
Feeling a little bit like a naughty child Harry sat down. His legs felt a little shaky as he stretched them out in front of him. He was surprised to note that the little waiting room was empty apart from the three of them. To Harry’s surprise, Draco brought the first two cups of tea to Hermione and the Mediwitch who was putting up an admirable fight against Hermione. The next two he carried over to Harry.
‘I think you would love it and it’s about what
From what they understood, the wizard had become sick, and when no Healer could help him he’d turned to making sacrifices. He had convinced himself that killing all of these innocent creatures would heal him and they’d only figured it out when he kidnapped a young wizard to be his final sacrifice.
He was so caught up in pretending not to notice anything that he nearly ran in to someone. He sidestepped at the last second.
—Ron never let him forget about it—but at least he could somewhat convince himself they weren’t actually talking about him. Now, not only was his real name highlighted in bold at the top of every article, but the entire Wizarding World thought he was shagging Malfoy.
The Great Hall was an echo chamber of darkness. Draco turned to Potter who stared at the starry sky above them. And perhaps, in another world, another time, Potter may have understood how he felt.
—broke the heavy weight of his stare.
His gaze followed Malfoy on the other end of the pitch, who was flying around in an elegant loop. His robes billowed behind him, and the wind rustled through his hair. He looked dishevelled, in a strangely alluring way, and Harry bit down on his lips to halt the direction of his thoughts.
Act Three.
Every shit thing that had happened leading up to this point seemed almost dull compared to what had just exited Deverill’s mouth. To be honest, Harry was having a hard time believing it at all; surely, this was a cruel joke. In the next moment Deverill would laugh that booming, low laugh, slap his back, and mutter how gullible he was.
Perhaps it was too early to want this, too sudden of a realisation, but it coursed through Harry’s veins as if it had always been there, lying dormant, in wait for this singular spark of clarity.
“Mr. Potter’s putting that one on.”
“Choose one and you’ll find out.”
“You arse!”
to kill yourself? Just admit you lost and move on.”
“Is that—are you wearing a
“Yeah? Well, what’s it got to do with?” Potter wrapped his fingers around Draco’s wrist and yanked him down next to him. Draco was lying on his back like he was ready for his coffin, eyes wide and arms stuck by his side. But he still had four months before he turned eighteen, he had time left. Not a lot, but time, nonetheless.
This will do, indeed. It will have to.
“I just want you to know,” Harry said, as he watched Draco circle around him. His throat hurt from yelling, but he pushed forward, trying to catch the tail of Draco’s broom. “I don’t like how we left things on Saturday. I’m not ashamed of you, Draco. I’m not ashamed of the rumours about us. I’m not ashamed of everyone knowing how I feel about you.”
snaps a photograph and Draco tugs Harry away, before he can go off on one.
Harry looks so earnest, as if he’s genuinely concerned that it might not be okay. Draco’s heart soars and he runs his tongue over his lips, clearing his throat before speaking.
“I can’t wait.” Harry’s throat is dry, his voice thick with emotion. He doesn’t know where he’ll be when they get back.
“Is Malfoy coming?” Lee looks around, scanning the crowds.
, Auror Potter.”
“Of course I do,” Harry lies. He didn’t have a clue there were any gay bars in wizarding spaces, but then he doesn’t have much cause to go to Knockturn nowadays. It’s a security risk, and his face is so familiar it puts people on high alert. The lesser known Aurors and Unspeakables that can monitor the area inconspicuously are responsible for policing illegal activities there. “I’m afraid I can’t change that. You’ll have to exercise caution if you go anywhere the Aurors have jurisdiction.”
They gather Harry’s things into a small rucksack and make their way back out of the castle, into the icy winter air. The fresh snow is crisp beneath their feet as they leave Hogwarts behind and make their way at a steady pace towards the school gates.
“I haven’t spent that long on a broom in ages.” Harry stretches his aching limbs with a laugh. “Now I know why.”
, I’ll ask him. But don’t hold your breath.”
“I’m not suggesting you be there at all.” Hermione purses her lips. “But you can brief them, set some boundaries. Get your Aurors in line. I know this isn’t something you want to get involved with, for reasons I’m not sure I understand.” She trails off, her voice laced with disappointment. “I never thought for one minute you of all people would believe that there’s anything wrong with—”
. Not without talking to me first. Clearly, I’m a bloody idiot.”
“I’m not in the business of giving spare wands to just anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception.” Draco gives Harry a critical look, trying not to let his gaze linger for too long. On the cusp of thirty, Harry’s face is endlessly expressive, his mood evident in every broad, easy smile or agitated frown. He still has the same restless, boyish charm and energy that reminds Draco of Quidditch leathers, the thud of Harry’s magic landing squarely in his chest and the temptation of old to make a sport out of their conversations. Over the last few years when Draco found himself confronted with Harry Potter, he could never quite decide if he wanted to fuck him or fight him. Today, unfortunately, Draco knows exactly what he wants to do.
He’s been making excuses, not ready to talk through the scene at The Burrow with anyone. At last he feels like he can discuss it without crying. He owes Ginny a conversation after all the time spent on late-night calls since their break-up, both of them trying to help one another find ways to negotiate their new lives. Ginny’s undoubtedly been Harry’s closest friend and confidante for years and it hasn’t felt right pulling back from her, but the situation with Molly and Arthur was too raw and painful. Harry didn’t trust his anger and hurt not to get the better of him, and he couldn’t imagine yelling about Ginny’s parents to her. Now he feels calmer, a deep, heavy sadness settling over him and a hole in his heart. He thinks he can manage a conversation without shouting. It helps that Ginny probably knows the worst of it by now, which means he won’t have to go through the whole sorry mess in detail.
“Don’t be obtuse.” Merlin’s Kitchen is excessively shit and nobody in their right mind would buy a property above a nightclub. Draco can’t imagine Potter without outdoor space.
“Surely people have got bored of trying to kill you by now?” Draco arches an eyebrow at Harry, wondering what it must be like to live under such high alert at all times. “I’d say you’re long overdue a rest.”
Harry rolls his eyes and kicks off his trainers, leaving them in an untidy pile. He refuses to be embarrassed about the fact his socks are burgundy and gold. Malfoy should be grateful he didn’t wear the
Of all the ways Draco expected to spend this Saturday evening, being deep-throated by Harry wasn’t one of them but he can’t say he’s complaining. He sucks in a sharp breath, trying to avoid bucking into Harry’s mouth to allow him to control the pace.
Draco presses his thigh against Harry’s and the mild sting of jealousy rolls off him, replaced by another heat entirely. It’s all Harry can do not to reach for Draco. He has a suspicion the night is going to be torture.
“I’m all yours,” Harry says.
“We can stop,” Draco whispers. His hands are firm on Harry’s body and his breath hot against Harry’s skin as he rests over him. “If it’s not good for you we can stop.”
The evening has a strange, surreal quality to it. Harry didn’t expect coming out to be like this. The initial weightlessness was freeing, but he never expected it to be so fleeting. He wasn’t prepared for Draco’s revelation or the crushing panic that followed. It dawns on Harry how irrevocably his whole world has changed. Anything he does from here—all those things he wanted to explore—are crimes, in the wizarding world. His whole career has been based around preventing crime and now he’s committing one simply by existing. He’s not even able to be gay like everyone else, his position a footnote, an overlooked clause. He just wants it all to go away, to find space to breathe.
Draco can’t pinpoint the precise moment that altered his perspective and forced him to take a good, hard look at himself. Perhaps it was the vibrations of the largely unused wand he always kept close at hand, the times he would try to find old copies of the
“I didn’t say that.” Draco waits for Harry to sit again before continuing. He clenches his jaw, staring straight ahead without looking at Harry. “Are you going to pretend I didn’t deserve everything I got?”
‘Yes and yours is Lucius.’ Harry rolled his eyes. ‘That’s not the point. The point is, I think I would be cool.’
‘Mister Potter, I don’t know what exactly your motivation was to do what you did, but thank you.’ He could tell she was not used to thanking people.
‘If you go, Draco can come here and get him out of here. There’s no space otherwise.’ She glared at Harry, hard, but she clutched the Portkey tight and disappeared. He breathed a sigh of relief, one down. ‘Dray! Get over here!’ Harry called out, motioning for him. Robards had joined Draco behind his cover and counted down on his fingers. On zero Harry fired a rapid burst of spells over his cover, giving Draco the time he needed to get over to Harry. Draco’s shoulder bumped into his as he slid behind cover.
‘Well, then why?’ Harry grinned at her.
‘Finally he catches on.’ She grinned. ‘Now come on Saviour, time to head to dinner.’
Dawlish passed by Harry on his way into the breakroom, simply resting his hand on Harry’s shoulder for a second. It startled Harry into motion. Harry had no time or energy to process the look on Draco’s face before he threw his arms around him. Draco felt solid and
‘I hate you.’
‘Oh that’s good.’ Harry could feel the awkwardness creeping in. They’d been fine while they’d been in a bigger group, but now he didn’t really know what to say. Luckily, Parkinson seemed to have had lessons on this, maybe in pureblood school or something.
‘I can pay attention to details.’ Harry argued. ‘Potions is just tedious and some of the instructions are far too specific.’
He heard Draco cry out in pain. He felt a familiar hand on his arm. He heard a familiar voice in his ear.
‘One of the first things I learned when I entered the wizarding world, was that Slytherin was the bad house. That you didn’t want to go there, that Slytherins were evil. I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this before, but the Sorting Hat hesitated between putting me in Gryffindor or Slytherin, I am fairly certain the only reason it
‘Well, I suppose I should say “good job”, just know that the next time you pull a stunt like this I
‘Alright, then we’re ready to start.’
‘Would you just let it go, I am
‘If you want, I could make it for you.’ Harry titled his head.
‘She didn’t feel comfortable just walking into the Auror’s offices and also, she is technically still on house arrest, so.’ Malfoy said. He did actually shift away from Harry, but only to turn so he could face him, leaning one elbow on the back of the booth. Harry shifted around to go sit in a similar position, it was much more comfortable than twisting his neck. Harry had already undone the top few buttons of his shirt, but he started working on his sleeves now. It was warm in this place. He rolled them up to his elbows.
Draco. Kreacher had decided he was as close to a Black as he was going to find and treated Draco better than he’d ever treated Harry even though he technically owned the house.
‘Alright.’ Minister Shacklebolt said after a short pause. ‘Robards, let him take the tests, treat him like any other. If he passes, he can start, if he doesn’t, he won’t.’ He walked back towards the fireplace. ‘I don’t like it either, but Potter is right. He was found not guilty, he must be treated like any other candidate.’
‘Now that it’s been confirmed that they want us to dress respectably while we’re on the job, you really need to let me take you to go buy some decent clothes.’ Malfoy said as Ron weaved between the last few people between him and the table.
am allowed to decide whether I want to hold that against him or not. I am tired, I don’t want to spend energy on holding grudges, I have better things to do.’
‘That does sound like something I would say.’ He took off his coat and put it on the hook by the door, hanging his bag over it as well. He was still in that pearly, silky shirt. Harry busied his hands with his own coat to make sure he didn’t reach out to feel it.
‘I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.’ Now that seemed to work better. There was a familiar spark of interest in the pair of grey eyes. A slow smile spread over Draco’s face.
‘Ah yes, terrifying your students with tales of little creatures that will try to bludgeon them to death. So much fun.’ Draco said blankly.
‘Something my mom used to make me when I’d had a bad night.’ Malfoy said and then he pointedly turned his eyes forward, even though the course hadn’t started yet. It was Malfoy’s “do not ask me any more questions” gesture and Harry had learned he could only push Malfoy on that so many times before he stopped talking altogether. He decided this wasn’t worth pushing over.
‘Maybe you should go home.’ Draco offered. ‘You don’t look much better than when we went outside.’ Draco did, in fact look a bit better.
It was exactly like he’d pictured it. The two black silhouettes were clearly visible, even on Harry’s darker skin tone. The two deer looked free and
‘He’s even blushing Gryffindor red now.’ Blaise said with a smirk and in a completely surprising move, Draco barked out a laugh and flipped Blaise the bird.
‘He let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.’ One of the members of the Wizengamot spoke up. ‘His actions lead to the Death of Albus Dumbledore.’
‘But?’ Draco prompted.
‘Will I not see you at all?’ Draco’s face softened. It wasn’t a look Harry got to see often so he tried to drink in all of the details off it. Draco pushed his chair back and got up. He rounded his own desk and leaned on the edge, facing Harry.
your partner and not me.’ Harry rolled his eyes at Ron’s petulance. If anyone ever dared to say that Gryffindors didn’t hold grudges, Harry would happily point them towards Ron.
‘Mate, if there’s anyone they can’t deny, it’s you. Harry bloody Potter, saviour of the wizarding world.’ Ron said it with enough humour that it didn’t make Harry’s skin crawl like it usually did when people called him that. He wanted to be just Harry so badly. ‘If they’re going to deny anyone it’s going to be Malfoy.’ Ron said, his face twisting into a sneer. ‘Pompous prick.’
‘Potter?’ He asked, confused.
life or death.
. So he was letting it just simmer in the back for now.
allowed her to steal his biscuits, but he let Harry. He
He’d gone into the week prepared to investigate his own feelings towards Draco and he’d come to a pretty simple conclusion, fairly quickly: he was an idiot.
It's amazing!
Draco told him about the case as Harry read. It seemed fairly easy, they just needed to find who the ingredients in this warehouse belonged to. It
of Apparition and then he was sitting on the floor in front of the hospital. He immediately pushed himself to his feet and headed for the door. He could hear Robards pop into existence behind him but he didn’t stop to wait. He needed to know how Ron was. Right now.
‘I should go home.’ Harry stared at him for a few seconds as Draco put his beer down on the coffee table and started heading for his coat.
‘What’s that about?’
Death Eater and even that is questionable, since he was cleared of all charges.’ Harry said with a sheepish smile (the one that always worked) and he could feel Malfoy glare at him. Robards glared at him too. Great, he was already making friends. He did put his wand away, so that was good. He didn’t take his eyes off Malfoy as he spoke to what looked to be the other Auror there to administer the aptitude and character tests.
Potions. Show off. ‘Damn, Hermione. Congratulations.’ He said and she beamed at him.
a ticket, and otherwise you could ask Malfoy, they still have plenty of money right?’ She asked, tilting her head. Harry shrugged.
‘That sounds more like a punishment than a reward.’ Harry made a face at Robards retreating back.
‘Do I do your eyes too?’ He asked. It was a little awkward like this, he had to get his wand right up in Malfoy’s face and try not to stare at the porcelain-esque skin.
take the Portkey and go?’ Draco snapped back. Harry groaned in frustration. Now was
‘Well, I hadn’t considered myself quitting too, but I figured for you, well, you were already doing it during our fifth year.’ Draco said, looking at the gently moving grass in the painting above the fireplace. Harry frowned, trying to figure out what he meant. Their fifth year had been an entire bloody mess.
‘Well yes, I wanted to talk to you about Mirella, but instead I found Harry Potter.’ She said with a tilt to her head that Draco seemed to read like a question.
‘Potter?’ He couldn’t immediately place the voice, but he forced himself to turn his head slowly. He was safe. He was safe. He could tell by the look on Hermione’s face that she already disliked this.
‘Are we?’
‘Would you recognize them?’
‘Huh.’ He said before he could stop the sound from leaving his mouth. Draco looked up and raised a questioning eyebrow. Harry wasn’t ashamed of it and it was unlikely that Draco would judge him for it anyways. ‘I didn’t take the potion I usually take last night, but I slept fine.’
Harry was sitting with Hermione (who was flipping through a book, checking her own answers), Ron (who was laying flat on his back with his eyes closed) and Neville, when McGonagall approached. Harry was annoyed that his hands were shaking as McGonagall handed him the envelope with his results, but she gave him a small smile, so he was pretty sure it couldn’t be awful?
But, he and Draco handled it all with grace (Draco more than Harry) and patience (Draco more than Harry) and a sense of humour (Harry more than Draco, finally
‘Also, you can stay the night, but we don’t need to do anything you don’t want to.’ Harry smirked. ‘I’m up for pretty much anything though.’ The look on Draco’s face was totally worth it.
‘Thanks Gin.’ Harry said with a sigh. ‘Anyone else want a refill?’ He asked, shooing Ron out of the way to get out of their booth.
‘I suppose, but now it’s Friday and we have to finish this house before we get to go home and then we’ll have to write our reports on the weekend. Now
‘Alright Harry, I am going to need you to take off your shirt.’ Harry nodded and easily pulled the plain black tee over his head. Draco had scoffed at his outfit, but now Harry could smile smugly at him. Draco’s eyes, however, were not on Harry’s face. Huh, interesting. ‘And you’re going to need to lay down.’ Missy added and the chair Harry was sitting on smoothly transformed into what was practically a bed.
‘Official, huh?’
In moments like this it was easy to forget everything they’d been through.
‘Well, then do something about it.’ He made an impatient motion with his hand. ‘We do not have time for this.’ Harry rolled his eyes and pictured Ron’s eyes.
It was like every other time apart from Draco holding his hand now when he flinched at the sting of the magic at the bottom of his spine. Missy didn’t comment, but she did grin at him and wink before they headed out.
Draco was taller than him and having to tilt his head up was a new experience, but Draco’s hand cupped around his jaw was helping him along. Draco’s shirt was silky under his fingers and when he dug his other hand into Draco’s hair it was exactly as soft as he expected it to be. It was like a spark at the bottom of his spine. Something hot and liquid and warm that raced up and settled in his chest. It was a proper kiss too and Draco knew how to use his tongue. The thought that that was because he was a snake almost made Harry start to giggle uncontrollably.
. He clenched his jaw and forced the images away. Now was not the time.
‘Well, we were just having a conversation…’
It had already been dark by the time they managed to de-boobytrap the whole house. Harry had learned a scary amount of ways to boobytrap a house with curses. Death Eaters were creative.
The Ministry, at least Dawlish would be there at some point. Harry shot into his clothes. Jeans, t-shirt, hoodie, socks, shoes, wand. He barely even got himself outside of the wards before he Apparated. He didn’t run through the Atrium, but only because he didn’t want to make someone think that there was something wrong. There was something very, very right. Draco was coming back. He was
‘-so, I think that they should let you make the robes green. You’d look so good in green, and what does it really matter?’ Amelia said with a high, tinkling little laugh. For some reason it made Harry’s shoulders go tight.
‘That is
‘Yeah okay.’ He said weakly. He cleared his throat. ‘There was another thing you guys wanted to talk about?’
‘Now see, they’re not as good as mine. Look at those.’ With a wave of those stupidly pale, slim hands. Harry rolled his eyes and did.
‘You’re in love with me?’ Draco cut in. Oh. Harry ran back through what he’d said.
anything, they’re just fun. Molly loves buying and/or making me pillows, so I guess I collect them now.’ Harry shrugged as he put the glasses and the bottle down, pulling the coffee table closer so that he could sit on the couch and reach it. Draco looked a little horrified and mostly confused.
Comments make me squeal with delight!
‘I can.’ Harry said as confidently as he could manage. He tipped his chin back just a little so that the light hit his scar. If he couldn’t use his name to do some good, than what the hell
‘Well, he’s enthusiastic.’ Harry murmured and Malfoy hummed in agreement.
‘Mister Potter, we have to take Mrs Malfoy to the Manor now.’ One of the Aurors said. Harry was pretty sure that was Robyan.
‘That’s sweet. Already bickering again.’ Harry turned to find Amelia leaning against the wall just outside of the breakroom. ‘Mind if I welcome him back too?’ She smirked at Harry. He rolled his eyes and stepped aside. Amelia gave Draco a quick hug. ‘Welcome back.’
‘That is not looking good. I thinks Master Harry’s friend is hurt.’ Kreacher said, actually showing an emotion. ‘Master Harry’s friend must not bleed on the upholstery.’ Ah, that’s why. ‘Shall Kreacher heal Master Harry’s friend?’ He should probably introduce them, maybe Kreacher would be nicer to a Malfoy.
It all felt just a little too real.
‘Kids are just little adults, you are
me enough to believe that I’m telling him the truth!’
‘He looks exhausted.’ Hermione said with a mild reproachful look at Ron. ‘It must be hard on him and his mother with his father in Azkaban.’ Ron rolled his eyes.
‘You’re just getting your first one and you’re already planning more?’ Draco asked, sitting in the second chair near the wall. He was dressed in one of his fancy Muggle outfits, charcoal pants, blue/green-ish button up and a waistcoat in the colour of his pants. He looked hilariously out of place. Not that he seemed to notice that himself. He seemed perfectly at ease, one of his ridiculously long legs crossed over the other, his hands folded under his chin.
‘Do you want me to come with?’
‘You are trying to emotionally manipulate me into getting rest.’ He concluded and Draco shrugged casually.
‘Well, you two are like, together, right?’ She shifted her feet, but there was a sparkle in her eyes that made Harry feel like she was enjoying this now. She definitely also had a little bit of a Slytherin vibe.
‘I’m glad we are.’ Draco shifted uncomfortably.
‘It’s just the adrenaline.’ Draco sighed deeply.
‘Malfoy has done nothing to make me distrust him-‘
As far as Harry could tell, he’d stopped brewing potions for his own pleasure. Where, from what Harry understood, it had previously been a therapeutic thing for him to do, he seemed to have lost that. At least for now.
Amelia Frost who was very capable. When you first met her, you’d think she was too sweet to be an Auror, but Harry had seen her in practice interrogations and she could be vicious. She’d been a Hufflepuff back in Hogwarts and as Harry had learned pretty quickly, badgers were
Their latest case however dealt with a small, but nasty group of wizards who had been attacking Muggleborns. They were the vicious sort and so when Harry and Draco ended up being surprised by them and then cornered, things got dicey.

‘You- you want me to go get the child
‘Mother.’ Draco seemed surprised to find his mother in a chair near the window. Narcissa Malfoy looked almost exactly like she always had, a little older, but still tall and bordering on royal.
‘Oh right, you have lunch with your friends today, right?’ Harry felt like his brain had suddenly come back online
‘Damn Slytherins.’ Harry muttered to himself before deciding to grab a coffee in the cafeteria before he headed home.
Harry paced back and forth between their desks, trying to calm down his racing heart. He wanted this to be over. This whole stupid game they were playing, he wanted it to be done now. It hadn’t been fun the first week and it still wasn’t fun after the first month.
‘I will.’ Harry said before he took a good look at the drawing.
‘That’s my wand.’
‘Of course not.’ And he did what Harry told him to. He handed the other pieces of clothing off to Harry as well and he tried not to marvel over how
‘Malfoy, come with me.’ Robards leaned into their office, his face serious, as always. Draco only blinked once before answering, perfectly polite.
She was beautiful with her gold blonde hair and her dark mysterious eyes, she was fun and she had a spark and yet… she just wasn’t Draco.
