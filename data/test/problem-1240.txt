"Not much. Like at all. It's like there's these huge time gaps and I think it's got something to do with Malfoy." Hermione flinched at the name, so small he almost missed it. "What aren’t you telling me?"
The rest of the class progressed amicably, Harry and Malfoy debating which potions might be good candidates, looking up the properties of each in their textbooks and checking the storeroom for the right stock, before finally deciding on one. There was still five minutes or so of class.
Draco missed his touch as soon as it disappeared, and as he settled onto one of the armchairs by the fire, he started to wonder if he had imagined it all. But Potter returned less than five minutes later with a tray heaped up with lamb, vegetables, bread and a giant teapot with two cups. Draco picked at the food, eating a little, but mostly he drank the tea.
"Because I want them to cover up the Dark Mark," Draco said. "That was why I started. I was trying to get rid of it. I even tried to burn it off, see that mark there?"
"Is that a compliment, Malfoy?" Potter held a hand to his heart as if he was so shocked he might have a heart attack. "Why, I never would've thought!"
With a jolt he stood up and made his way to the doors, knowing that everyone had to be watching him, but he just had to get out of there. Just needed a distraction so that he could breathe again. Once the doors had closed behind him and he stood in the entrance hall once more, he stood still as he tried to catch his breath, pushing away the memories that threatened to bubble to the surface and strangle him. After a moment, he regained a little bit of his composure.
Harry closed his eyes in anger. No more. He wasn't going to let Draco go through any more pain. "I'm getting you out of here." He started making his way around the edges of the room, looking amongst the broken bits of stone. Eventually he found a rock with a sharp enough edge and got to work on his bounds. It took an excruciatingly long time, but he got them off. He made his way back over to Draco, who was watching him with glassy eyes, and started on the ropes holding Draco up. They had dug into his wrists and rubbed them raw, so he was careful not to make it worse.
Draco only raised his eyebrows, surprised to hear Potter using their first names. It took Draco a few minutes to respond, but he replied, "It's not your fault."
Harry became a little concerned when he couldn't find Draco after checking all their usual study spots. He headed to the dormitories, thinking maybe he had just gone back to his room. There was no response however when he knocked on the door. Then he remembered something Draco had said weeks ago about going up the Astronomy Tower when he had nightmares.
"You're up," said Harry from by the fireplace. He got up and walked over to Draco's bedside, taking a seat and brushing Draco's hair out of his eyes. Draco caught his hand and kissed the back of it, then held it against his chest.
"I'm sort of just discovering who I am, and who I can be now that the war is over, when I'm no longer the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived," he had said to her. "I feel like that part of my life is over, and you were a big part of that time for me but… I think I need something else."
Harry rose briefly into consciousness. He was on the ground, and a voice that sounded like Hermione was calling his name. Then everything faded back to darkness.
It was at dinner one night when Draco didn't show again that he voiced his concerns to Ron and Hermione.
"What?" he snapped at a bug-eyed first year across from him. The boy flinched and passed his paper across to him. Draco snatched it and saw that the front page featured a full-size photo of his father behind the bars of Azkaban. His eyes looked crazed, and he was sneering at the camera before lunging at the bars with a snap of his teeth. Then he would retreat, and the moving picture would play again.
"In fact," Dumbledore went on, "I rather think that my Patronus is a bit weak, and perhaps you would do better at teaching the students how to conjure one, Mr Potter."
He let go just as abruptly and turned back to the sink, gripping the edge with shaky hands. Harry was stunned, rooted in place.
"No," Harry said, coming to a stop in front of Draco. "All you're doing is leaving me alone, without the person I need most."
"Then let us go," Harry said, using the wall to push himself to his feet. "If you have no use for us then what's the point in keeping us here?"
The Hogsmeade train station was crowded with more reporters, all desperate for an exclusive with the famous Harry Potter, or even any of his friends that had also played a major part in the war. He was keen to get to the castle where they were barred from entering, and they would finally be free of the press for a few months. Harry had spent all summer dodging them and would be grateful for the reprieve, even though there were sure to be plenty of younger students who also wanted to ask him questions.
The Death Eaters behind the three Slytherins raised their wands and Harry prepared to shout. Before he could the back door to the Three Broomsticks opened, and Draco came out.
"It's okay, I've got you…" he said as they made their way over to the bed. Harry settled him down and even pulled the covers up, then went to grab the water pitcher from the nearby desk. He returned with a full glass of water, which he handed to Draco. "Drink." Once he had drained the glass, Harry refilled it and passed it back. When he was done, Harry set the glass aside and sat on the edge of the bed.
He had approached Ron and Hermione with an idea the next morning. "Hey guys, I have something to ask of you."
He got his wish sooner than he'd hoped. He was tackled against the wall before he even had a chance to defend himself, and then whoever had grabbed him was punching him in the stomach.
"Harry, what's –" Seeing the Slytherins and the Death Eaters, Draco immediately pulled out his wand and took up a defensive stance.
Draco spent the rest of the day hunting down Pansy and Blaise between classes. He wasn't looking forward to this chat, as he'd kind of been avoiding them so far. But they had once been his friends, and if Potter could make an effort to be friends with someone like him, then he could make an effort to reconcile with his own friends.
"Hey, hey." Potter stopped them just outside the door to the classroom, everyone else having already gone in. "If you ever need to talk to someone, I'm here. I know this is new and all, but I really want this to work."
He lost sight of Malfoy, but then he rounded a corner and saw the door to a bathroom. The same bathroom that Harry had followed Malfoy to two years ago, when Malfoy had been breaking down for a different reason. He felt a strong sense of déjà vu crash through him like a wave, causing an uncomfortable tightening in his chest. He hesitated before rounding the corner, letting out a long breath to ease the tension. The last thing he wanted was for this encounter to end the same way. He had a lot of regrets from that day, but he told himself it wasn't going to happen that way again. It couldn't.
He eventually settled on his plainest pullover sweater, which still had a nice silver trim, over a collared shirt and plain black pants. Simple. No need to overthink it. It’s not like that was what he'd spent the last twenty minutes doing.
"Oh, I almost forgot!" Harry exclaimed. "We're planning on getting all the eighth years together for drinks at the Three Broomsticks this Friday night, and you're coming."
Draco's eyes welled up at that, and Harry's face softened. "Stop that," he said, pulling Draco down to kiss him. It was soft and tender, lingering on Draco's lips. He was utterly content and never wanted the moment to end.
Draco laughed, and Harry basked in the musical sound of it. "I actually went and had a chat with Dumbledore this morning," he went on. Draco hummed to show he was listening as he kept playing with Harry's fingers. "I wanted to ask him why he seems so intent on me taking over his class, and he said that that's basically what wants me to do."
"If you don't want to tell me anything then I'll just be on my way," Draco said, taking a step back, but Synde whipped out his wand and levelled it at Draco's chest.
Someone was calling his name, but it sounded like a distorted echo, and then there was a hand on his elbow pulling him away. He struggled against it, trying to claw it off, desperate to get away.
His breath caught when he saw Draco up close. His sleeves had been pulled down and the wrist that bore the Dark Mark and his cuts had been sliced to ribbons. There were more gashes on his other arm and his chest, and his eyelids fluttered weakly as he tried to keep his head up.
As soon as they disappeared around the corner, the binding spell lifted and Harry fell to his hands and knees. He crawled over to where Draco lay and rolled him over, a sob heaving through his body at the sight of him. He was pale as a sheet, almost grey, and his lip and cheek were swollen and dripping blood. His eyes fluttered, and he let out a small groan of pain. Harry cushioned his head with his hand and tilted his face towards him.
Over the next few days, they feel into a routine. Draco re-joined Harry, Ron and Hermione at meals, and Draco and Harry spent just about all their free time together. It felt just as easy as it had before Draco's panic attack, and Harry was ecstatic that Draco was opening up to him again. And each night, Harry would stay over in Draco's bed, falling asleep with an arm draped over him or holding his hand just to let him know he was there. Each morning, they would wake up closer together, limbs tangled and arms around each other.
"He's right about Ginny taking it really well, though," Hermione said after a moment. "It's like she knows something we don't."
"Definitely. Maybe we can even be friends, I mean I'm optimistic. But if that's going to happen, I think we should go by first names."
Every muscle in his body froze. He didn't want to dare turn around in case he had imagined it. But slowly, he spun, one hand still clutching the railing like it was an anchor.
" and let himself in. He couldn't see Draco anywhere at first but saw the bathroom door was open. He ran over to it and fell to his knees when he saw Draco.
Ron immediately turned to Harry, but Harry scoffed. "What are you looking at me for? Hermione's better at Potions than I am, and besides, you’re dating now so you don't want to leave her to find some other random partner."
Potter looked satisfied with that. "I'll take this tray downstairs to the common room and hopefully the house elves will come get it during the night." Draco put his cup back down on the tray and Potter picked it up, taking a step towards the door. "Will you be okay tonight?"
"Still, I just want to say…" Draco steeled himself, needing to say this and wanting her to know how much he meant it. "I'm sorry for the way I used to treat you. There's no excuse. And I can't take it back, but I want to do everything I can to make up for it."
Harry started walking towards Draco and threw his arms around him, almost toppling him with the force of his hug.
Harry gave him another quick kiss. "Everything will work out perfectly," he murmured. And he was sure that it would. As per Aberforth Dumbledore's recommendation, Headmistress McGonagall had hired Harry for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position without so much as an interview. He had spent the second semester helping Dumbledore more and more in classes, and the over the summer had more received a crash course in being a professor, though Harry had flown through the training. He was a natural at teaching, as he had been in his fifth year, and he was beyond excited to begin working. Draco, on the other hand, had rather fallen into the work he was doing now.
He couldn't even stand the thought, so he had fallen back on his old habits and started pushing people away again. He was expecting that any day Harry would get sick of his wallowing in self-pity and try to snap him out of it.
"I'm sorry," Harry said with a sob, letting his head drop onto Draco's chest and bunching his shirt in his fist.
Draco was cut off as Harry crashed into him, hugging him tight. Draco's wand lowered, but the Patronus remained, circling above them. Harry pulled back, and they stood there, still holding each other but neither closing the distance. A thousand thoughts raced through Draco's mind in an instant and with the force of a tidal wave, the fear he had let go of crashed back into him. The Patronus flickered out as Draco took a step back. Hurt flashed in Harry's eyes, and Draco faltered. What was he doing? He was going to ruin this.
Draco nodded and closed his eyes for a moment. At the start of the semester, Draco might have thought that coming up with a happy memory was impossible. Perhaps that was why he had never been able to conjure a full Patronus. Now, however, he knew exactly what – or rather who – it was that made him happy. In fact, he had a surplus of memories, but he chose one and focused on it, drawing out the details.
He kissed him deeply, hands clutching at his shirt, and Harry responded immediately. Draco tugged at his waist, pulling him closer, and felt Harry arch into him. Harry's fingers were in Draco's hair, tugging at the stands, until Harry pulled away and flipped them in a heartbeat, so that Draco was against the wall.
He debated whether he should go over or not. Would now be the right time to say something? He didn't even know what headspace Draco was in at the moment. He listened quietly for any sort of sign, but then there was a loud smash and the sound of shattering glass. That answered that question.
Harry's eyes immediately turned to the head table, searching for new faces, but the face he saw was one that was so familiar that for a moment he felt as though he couldn't breathe again. But it couldn't be – he was dead.
"We are. But I'm going to think of you as my date," Harry said with a mischievous grin. Draco thought he looked gorgeous in the soft bedroom light and pulled him down to kiss him.
Snyde faked a lunge forward, and a wicked grin spread over his face when Draco flinched. Harry's heart ached at the implication that he had gone looking for trouble. Draco's hands curled into fists at his sides, and Harry had to control the urge to take his hand.
"It seems there's really no disciplining you is there?" Lucius drawled. "Such a shame." Draco knew that Lucius had never had any plans to discipline to him, only to punish.
Draco captured his mouth again, wanting to taste him. But Harry's kisses moved past his mouth, along his jaw and down his neck. Draco tilted his head back to give him better access, and when Harry found his sweet spot just above his collarbone, he couldn't help the noise that escaped his lips. Harry suckled and nipped at it torturously, and when Draco couldn't take it anymore, he pulled Harry's face back up to his, recapturing his lips.
After a few shuddering breaths, he watched calmly as the blood continued to drip off the side of his arm, until eventually it slowed and started to clot. Draco then whispered the healing spell that would seal the cuts but not make them disappear completely. They were there in part to cover up the Dark Mark after all.
"I managed to apparate a safe distance away when I was pushed out of the building, but then I passed out."
When they reached the new dormitory, Harry took a moment to take in the common room. It was smaller than the house common rooms, as there were less students for it to house, but it still had a cosy feeling. A banner for each of the houses hung on the walls, and a great fireplace set into the wall filled the room with warmth. Heading upstairs, he saw that each room was labelled with the owner's name, and with a jolt he saw that Malfoy's was next to his.
He cared about Draco. He really, truly did. And over the last month he had let himself grow closer to him, and now there was a new depth to his feelings, and he didn't know what to do about it. Should he tell Draco? Try to explain? Or would it only make things worse and push him away further? Perhaps he had already ruined any chance they might have had.
When he woke, his friends surrounded the bed. He shut out their questions, and eventually they gave up and all but Hermione left. She sat by his bedside, content to sit in silence, and watched him.
This was a concern of Draco's that they'd been over several times, but Harry was happy to reassure him every time until he no longer needed to. "Trust me, if I ask McGonagall if I can apparate in every day instead of have a room in the castle, she'll let me. The woman loves me," he added with a cheeky grin.
Once the door had fully formed, Harry and Draco glanced at each other before taking a door handle each and pushing inward. When they stepped in, Harry was instantly greeted with familiarity. He tore his eyes away from his surroundings however to watch Draco instead. He looked a bit stunned at the cavernous room lined with mirrors and filled with duelling equipment.
"No!" Draco struggled more against his captors, and Harry could only suck in a sharp breath as Snyde pointed his wand straight at Harry's heart, a devilish grin on his face. He braced himself for the pain.
Harry was about to throw the cloak off, when Snyde and the others pocketed their wands. Maybe he didn't need to reveal himself after all.
She had accepted that their relationship had come to an end, and Harry had left the Burrow to do a bit of soul searching. He had visited with the Dursleys – that encounter didn't go wonderfully – to tell them that they could come out of hiding because it was safe now that the wizarding war had come to an end. He had met up with Hagrid in Diagon Alley to get his school supplies, reminiscent of his first year, as well as visited his godson Teddy, who was being looked after by his grandmother Andromeda. Amongst other house calls, Harry had also begun refurbishing Grimmauld Place with the intention of one day making it his home, before finally packing up for Hogwarts and meeting his friends at King's Cross Station.
Before Madam Promfrey could notice, he quickly got up, changed into the fresh set of clothes that was on the bedside table and left the infirmary.
it wasn't Dumbledore, it was his brother. The two looked so alike that they could be twins, but as Harry really looked, he could see the subtle differences.
Draco collapsed to the floor, leaning back against the wall as Snyde came up to him. "I know you're best friends with Potter now, Malfoy. So why hasn't he come to save you yet?"
Draco shook his head as Dumbledore asked for a volunteer to demonstrate. "Ah, Mr Potter, would you care to perform a Patronus for us?"
"Don't!" shouted Draco, surging forward. The two others grabbed his arms and held him back, but he struggled against them.
Draco knew that Harry was worried about him, but he couldn't bring himself to reach out to him even though he knew that Harry had told him to do so countless times. It hurt so much to be away from him, but it also hurt just as much to be near him and know that he couldn't close that distance, couldn't make that final leap. He was so scared of being rejected again, he thought that if he made himself completely vulnerable and was shut down anyway that he might just shatter.
"I can walk, you know, I just need a minute," Draco grumbled, but he wrapped his arms around Harry's neck as he was carried towards the eighth year dormitories.
Hearing his name on Potter's lips finally broke him completely, and the sobs kept coming. They stood like that for a long time, hanging onto each other, Potter letting him cry onto his shoulder. Eventually they pulled apart, and Potter held Draco's face in his hands, wiping away his tears with his thumbs. There was a gentle smile on his face, and Draco couldn't help the flick of his eyes down to Potter’s lips.
"Do you know what's out there, Draco?" He didn't answer. "The North Sea. Azkaban. We have great plans, my son, and I want you to be a part of them."
"A fair fight?" Draco's eyes were darting around frantically, and too late Harry realised he was looking for him. "Three against one?"
But it didn't matter. Draco planned to avoid him as much as possible, which was made a bit more difficult by having his room right next to his, but he would manage. He would cope.
Okay, now that these bonus chapters are up, this is all that I plan on writing for this story, so this is the end! (probably, unless I decide to add something else lol but at this point I think it's unlikely) Thank you all again so much for reading and for leaving kudos and commenting. Love you all x
The rest of the feast passed as usual, and Harry was all too glad when it was finally over and they could turn in. Hermione and Ron shooed away the younger students who tried to ask Harry questions as they left – they were mostly first and second years who hadn't already been to school with Harry. It was a relief to finally get away from the crowds of people.
McGonagall was crouched before him and Harry knew she was trying to say something to him, but he couldn't summon the energy to process the words. He only kept staring at the spot where Draco was supposed to be. He didn’t take his eyes off it until they lifted him up and guided him from the room. He struggled at first, but then let them take him outside.
"Great. Love the enthusiasm," Harry said with a double thumbs up before walking away, thinking that it definitely could've gone worse.
Draco's eyes cracked open a bit wider, and Harry's heart shattered at the pain he saw there. He knew exactly what the cruciatus curse felt like. He cursed himself for letting this happen, for failing to protect Draco like he had said he would.
!" Draco felt himself being flung from Harry, and he skidded across the ground to the edge with the railing, the jagged cliffs below reaching up for him. A bolt of fear seized him, and he grabbed for the railing to pull himself up.
What would it show him now, he wondered? What did it think he needed? Draco decided he didn't want to know and hastily headed down the corridor. The Room only served as a reminder of the life debt that he owed to Potter, and how he could never possibly repay it. There were a lot of days when Draco wished that Potter had failed to save him.
Sitting back with his friends, the four of them chatted for a bit – Neville was definitely down for drinks – before they parted ways to go to their first class, the Golden Trio to Potions and Neville to Herbology.
He caught sight of Harry, Ron and Hermione cringing away from the snapping cameras and came to shoo them out of the way. "Harry! Ron! 'ermione! It's good to see ya!"
Harry found himself staring at the empty Headmaster's chair and realised he had been waiting for Dumbledore to appear. He mentally scolded himself as McGonagall made her way to the seat instead. She made her Headmistress's speech, and Harry's attention drifted elsewhere. Over to the Slytherin table to be exact, and for a moment he searched for a certain platinum blond head before he remembered he wouldn't find it. He was snapped out of it by McGonagall, who had started talking about the war. He guessed it was supposed to be uplifting, saying how they had prevailed and were stronger than ever. It only served as a reminder to Harry, however, of all the people he'd lost and torment he had suffered through. He found his breaths were quickening, and soon he was struggling to breathe at all. He squeezed his eyes shut, remembering that it was just a symptom of his PTSD, and that he wasn't facing Voldemort again, wasn't about to die. Again.
He shouldn't have answered, knew that it was dangerous. But he wanted to see him, needed to see him. And if Harry had somehow gotten his memories back… it was a good thing, he told himself. He had regretted it anyway. So why was he so scared to face him?
Timidly, Harry stepped back around the corner to face him, his chest tight. "It's just me. Malfoy, I didn’t –"
There was knock at his door, and he ran a hand through his hair in an attempt to flatten it (he'd stopped using gel sometime during the war when he was too stressed to care much about his appearance) and opened the door to Potter.
Draco only shrugged, but his mind was playing the words Dumbledore had said about the war on a loop.
Draco laid his head back down on Harry's chest. "Yeah, pretty much. But I think… it was easier to sleep with you here."
Draco chuckled, and Harry felt his own grin spreading, until he was laughing too. He threw his head back, and Draco laughed harder as well. It was contagious.
But what did this mean going forward? Could they really be friends after everything that they had been through? It was a miracle that Potter would even consider it after all of the horrible things that Draco had done, the way he had treated him and his friends… Surely he wasn't worthy of his friendship, let alone anything else. Potter should hate him, but of course he's too good to even hold a grudge.
Thank you all so much for all the support on this story! This is the final chapter that I had written, but I'm thinking now that I might write an epilogue just to wrap up some other plot lines like what Draco and Harry are going to do after they graduate and where their mental health is at that stage (also would it be a terrible idea to end the epilogue with 'All was well'? I know the epilogue in the books has it's issues but I love that final line). I also had an idea to write the chapter plummet from Draco's perspective instead of Harry's so you can see both sides of how it happened. Would you guys be interested in those two ideas as bonus chapters? Let me know, and I'll work on them when I can but it might be a while before they're posted.
The sound gradually became deafening, and Draco couldn't help but flinch at some of the bangs. He noticed that Harry was watching him, and so he tried to take some deep breaths and calm down.
The Potions class was a mixture of eighth year students and NEWT level seventh years and was taught by Professor Slughorn as he had agreed to come back after the war. Harry immediately noticed Malfoy standing at a bench near the back. He tried to catch his eye, but soon Slughorn was welcoming them to the class and explaining their first project. He finished by stating that it was a partner project and asked for everyone to find a partner.
"Draco…" Harry put his hands over Draco's, careful not to apply too much pressure. "Please let go. Please drop the glass."
It was that thought that carried him up to the Astronomy Tower. He wished it hadn't, as this place was only another reminder of his failings. He supposed, however, that he was glad that he had failed at that particular task. It didn't change the outcome, but at least Dumbledore didn't fall at his hands.
"No," Draco said softly. "Sirius handed this place down to you, and…" he gestured widely at the mural, "my family's here."
Draco retreated to his room with one last glance back at Potter, and as he closed his door, he realised that for the first time in a long time he was content.
The two left the classroom and headed straight for the hallway where the door was concealed. This time, it opened for them immediately, and Draco was once again struck with awe at the magnificent space. There was definitely a part of him that wished he could have been here in fifth year, a part of Dumbledore's Army preparing to fight against Voldemort. If only he had known back then how much everything would change.
Potter nodded to his friends to carry on ahead, and then walked alongside Draco at a slower pace. "What's up?"
He opened his eyes and saw the reason for it all standing in front of him, and he knew he could do it. Raising his wand, he shouted, "
Harry jumped out of his chair and ran out of his room, over to Draco's door. He pounded on the wood, then tried the door handle, but it was locked.
It was a relief when things slowly started to go back to normal. Harry and Draco didn't explicitly come out to their friends as dating, but they stopped hiding their affections and shamelessly held hands and kissed in public. None of them seemed surprised – in fact Hermione actually rolled her eyes but had an affectionate smile. He had a feeling she'd known from the beginning.
All the groups had finished forming and moving around at that point, and Slughorn began telling the students the instructions for their projects. It was a very open ended project, allowing the teams to choose a potion that interested them and test a component of it over a series of experiments to see if it worked differently under different conditions or with a different ingredient, and the goal was to either see if there was a way to improve the potion or find a potential new use for it.
Draco sighed, but closed his eyes. This time, he emptied out his mind completely, and focussed on not just a memory of him and Harry, but the warmth, the kindness, the safety of him. He let the essence of who Harry was and how he made him feel flow through him, encompass him. He let go of everything and let himself drown in it. There was no bottom to it, only depthless emotion. And for once Draco didn't let himself be scared of it.
Draco seemed to freeze at the mention of Harry's name. "That's right, the two of them are mates now, aren't they," said one of the boys behind Snyde.
"I don't know about that sir, Ron and Hermione have strong Patronuses too, and so do Ginny and Luna," Harry said, indicating his other friends in the class.
He couldn't feel his arm anymore but he couldn't stop scratching, until strong hands suddenly pulled his hand away, and there was Harry in his face, telling him to breathe. He could only just hear his voice, as if it was travelling through a tunnel to reach him. Harry held onto his hands and Draco gripped back like he was lifeline, pulling him back.
"I did actually come looking for you," Draco said, and Snyde raised his eyebrows. "You said you wanted me to join your cause. I want to know more about it."
It was Harry's turn to shout, and as he tried to run forward another Death Eater stepped in his way, wand raised. He locked eyes with Draco, saw the desperation there, but he couldn't see a way out.
"Scared, Potter?" Draco held out a hand to pull Harry up, and Harry looked at it for a second before taking it and allowing Draco to hoist him up.
Harry quickly realised that he had completely zoned out while watching Draco do his work. They were sitting at their usual table in the library, going over their final notes and findings from their Potions experiments.
Harry was sat at his desk in his room, studying in an attempt to take his mind off things. Or at least he was trying to study. He'd just about given up when he heard the door next to his – Draco’s door – open and shut again. He must've finally come back.
Draco froze, except for his hand which Harry saw twitch at his pocket, a second away from grabbing his wand. Under the cloak, Harry took out his own wand. For a few strained seconds, Draco and Snyde stared each other down, neither making a move. Then Draco grabbed for his wand, but before he could raise it there was a shout of "
The next week progressed in a similar manner. Draco would share his meals with the Golden Trio, sometimes also joined by Neville, or Ginny and Luna. Draco seemed to settle back into their old routine in Potions classes, confidently going about their experiments. Their study sessions, during which they were supposed to be researching more experimentation methods and ways to improve their potion, usually ended with them talking for hours instead. Draco was slowly opening up more and more to Harry, and Harry found himself doing the same for him.
Harry turned his head to look at Draco, and their eyes met. "If I calm you down during a panic attack, will you bring me back to the present if my PTSD hits?"
After a few more questions that Harry didn't have any answers to, they left him to rest and recuperate. But Harry could only lie there trying to think back on what happened. Why couldn't he remember anything? Had he even been attacked, or had he truly just drunk too much and passed out? He could barely even remember going out, and the further back he thought the more he realised there seemed to be gaps missing.
Once the bathroom looked back to normal, Harry gently tilted Draco's chin up to get a good look at his face. It was still tear-streaked and his eyes were puffy, but he also noticed a bruise on his cheekbone.
Draco felt Harry tense up in anger. "I'm getting you out of here." Draco certainly had no objections to that. He watched Harry make his way around the room, find a sharp object and cut himself free of his bounds. Draco's head was pounding, and the edges of his vision were still slightly blurry, but he held on for Harry. When Harry made his way over to cut Draco free, it was with extreme care not to hurt his wrists anymore. Draco was in so much pain already, however, that he barely felt the cutting of the ropes.
"Okay, good, good…" Draco wandered over to a life size dummy in the middle of a training ring. "I'm honestly surprised the fiendfyre didn't destroy the place."
Harry felt a wave of warmth at his friend's words. "Ron, I'm already a part of the family, Molly has made that clear enough on numerous occasions and this isn't going to change that," he assured him. "We’re brothers, Ron."
"And I haven't," she replied. "But I'm going to give him the opportunity to show that he's changed, and then I'll consider it. You should as well."
Malfoy sighed and sat back in his chair. They were sitting at a table in a secluded alcove at the back of the library, away from the distraction of other students – or at least, that was the reason Harry had told himself when he chose the spot. He watched Malfoy, who was looking toward a nearby window but didn't seem to actually be seeing out of it, like he was deep in thought. Harry had started to recognise the small crease between his eyebrows when he was contemplating sharing something.
Hermione only took his hand and squeezed, letting him know she was there. She held onto him as he finally let go of the tears, allowing himself to feel the pain of the loss. Once the sobs started, he couldn't stop, and Hermione stayed by him until exhaustion took him once again.
Draco was most definitely not okay, but he nodded. "I'll be fine." He remembered what one of the Slytherin seventh years had told him when they had first arrived at the castle: "We can only disapparate from outside the building."
They reluctantly pulled apart, allowing Harry to inspect the wound Draco had made. It was fairly deep, but the bleeding wasn’t as heavy anymore. He spelled the wound closed, along with the ones along his knuckles, and charmed the blood away and the mirror to repair itself.
He hit sand instead, rolling down a dune, the impact jarring his bones but saving him from an unsavoury death against the rocks below the cliff. When he slid to a stop at the bottom of the sand dune, he stumbled upright, and in a moment of delirium, found himself grinning. He had escaped death.
"If you go after them it'll only get worse, they have supporters who are ex-Death Eaters that would love nothing better than to see me dead." Harry tried to interrupt, but Draco said desperately, "Harry, please, just leave it alone."
Draco smiled and squeezed back. After a few moments, Harry let go with a sigh. "Will you be okay?" Draco gave a weak nod, but that didn’t reassure him. "I… I don't really want to leave you like this."
"Okay," Draco said, letting a long breath out through his nose. He did as Harry said, trying to place himself in the memory as if he were there, and said with confidence, "
Draco spent the day avoiding Potter, which turned out to be immensely difficult. He knew he would have to face him eventually for Potions, but that was a problem for another day. He was finally unsuccessful, however, when Potter followed him all the way from the Great Hall where Malfoy had snagged a piece of bread for dinner and back to his dorm. Draco had thought he was scot free, but Potter managed to get his foot in the door – literally.
Malfoy had entered the chamber of moving staircases and was halfway down one with Harry close behind when the staircase decided to move, forcing them to come to a halt while it decided where to drop them off.
"I know we were rivals for most of school, and then… the war…" Harry swallowed hard. "But I think that we should put all of that behind us."
"I think a better question would be why am I keeping you alive? And frankly, I think I've run out of reasons." Lucius raised his wand and pointed it at Harry.
Opening the door to his room, Draco stepped in to find that it looked like a typical Slytherin dormitory, but fitted for just one person with a four poster bed, a desk, wardrobe, a small fireplace with a couple of armchairs (not that he would ever be entertaining a guest) and a door off to the side that led to the bathroom. That was where Draco headed first.
"Not interested." Malfoy pushed past him and pulled his door shut, heading down the stairs. Harry followed.
Draco took a step toward him, lowering his wand for a moment, and said quiet enough for only Harry to hear, "It's the only way. Forgive me."
"Snyde," Draco addressed the boy, their leader apparently, as he and his entourage approached. Harry thought the name vaguely rang a bell, perhaps from the Death Eater Trials.
The Death Eaters' wands levelled straight at Harry, while Snyde kept his wand trained on Draco. Harry tried and failed to catch Draco's eye. He had no idea what to do – without his wand, he was useless.
McGonagall, Dumbledore and a few other teachers arrived some time later, bringing with them Ministry of Magic authorities. They confirmed the Death Eaters were dead, found the Slytherin seventh years elsewhere in the building, and recovered Harry and Draco's wands.
"It just never felt right. But I know what I want now." Harry turned his head just as Draco closed the space between them and captured him in a kiss. It was slow and tender, like he was showing Harry exactly what it was that he wanted. When they broke apart, Harry couldn't take his eyes of Draco's misty grey ones, content to stay like that forever. "I don't know if I'm ready to come out as gay yet though," Draco said, pulling Harry out of his daze.
"I can come with you if you like. Or we could go to the Burrow." He grinned. "A Weasley family Christmas with Draco Malfoy, that'll be fun."
He left then, closing the door behind him, and Draco stayed sat in front of the fire for a long while after that.
"Harry, you're awake!" Hermione appeared beside him, helping him get upright. Ron came around the other side of the bed, followed by Neville.
Draco really didn't feel like he was up to talking to Potter right at that moment, so he kept walking. Potter's hand grabbed on to his wrist in an attempt to slow him down, his left wrist, and in a panic he spun around he yanked it out of his grip.
He spotted the castle in the distance up the beach. Harry. He needed to get to him. He took a step forward, swaying with a wave of dizziness. Blackness creeped in at the corners of his vision.
It was what he'd wanted from the beginning after all, to be Potter's friend. But his rejection in first year had led Draco to be resentful, causing him to lash out in ways that he hadn’t truly wanted to.
Harry kissed him on the forehead, then gently laid his head back down. He got up and retrieved their wands and the cloak, stowing them away, before returning to Draco and carefully scooping him up bridal style.
Potter stuck next to Draco as the group made their way over to Hogsmeade, trailing a little bit behind once again.
They finally reached the eighth year dormitories, and Potter followed him all the way up to their side-by-side rooms.
Harry stood up and pulled Draco with him, but Draco lost his balance and swayed against him. Harry wrapped an arm around his waist and led him out of the bathroom.
Draco's heart clenched in fear – he knew how ruthless his father could be, and Harry provoking him was walking a dangerous line.
Draco made his way out, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Potter headed towards Granger with three butterbeers in hand. The corners of his eyes were still watery and threatening to spill over, so he kept going until he was outside and headed back towards the castle. He couldn't even fathom why he was so upset.
He heard the sound of someone apperating behind him and took a moment to calm his expression. He couldn't go running into his arms, or he'd never let go. Slowly he turned around.
He took a few steps closer, but Malfoy only turned back towards the sink, clutching his bleeding arm with his other hand. "It’s none of your business," he hissed.
Harry nodded. He felt warmth spread through him at the sight of Draco's smile, and he didn’t want to ever let go of him.
"How morbidly romantic, Potter," Draco said with a grin, and Harry's breath caught. "Of course I will."
"Keep telling yourself that," Draco said with a smile and a shake of his head. "Okay but, you're not afraid at all of… coming out?"
At that point they had reached the Three Broomsticks, and the group found a large booth inside and ordered a round of butterbeers. Draco sat at one end, across from Potter and next to Granger, Weasley on her other side. The two had their hands joined on the table, but Granger regularly turned to him to make conversation as the others were chatting, and she was so nice to him that Draco wondered how he could have ever thrown slurs at her. He almost felt like he didn't deserve her kindness, but she somehow made him feel worthy of it. Potter also frequently included him in conversations, but mostly he listened as everyone chatted, catching up on what had happened over the summer and recounting old memories. Every now and then something to do with the war would be brought up, and a few nervous glances would be thrown his way. But Potter or Granger (and even Weasley once) would quickly change the subject.
Harry was sobbing when it finally ended. Draco lay motionless, and Harry pulled uselessly at the invisible restraints holding him against the wall, desperate to get to him.
Draco couldn't form words, couldn't find the strength he needed to say what he had to say. Harry raised a hand to Draco's cheek, and Draco leaned into it, his eyes slipping shut and a tear escaping.
Snyde whipped out his wand and sent a hex straight to Draco's chest, causing his lungs to spasm. Draco fought to catch his breath, each gulp of air sending sharp pains through his chest.
Sorry for being a couple days late on uploading this chapter! But I'm sure this one is what you've all been waiting for, so enjoy ;)
!" came a shout, and Harry and Draco were thrown apart, Draco pushed towards the railing and Harry back against the wall. His head slammed against the stone and his vision crowded with black spots. Through the haze, he saw Draco pulling himself up by the railing to face…
"The new Dark Order, following the Dark Lord's legacy." Snyde leaned right into Draco's face. "Voldemort might be dead, but his ideas live on."
"Blame you for what?" Potter actually sounded like he was outraged at even the thought. "Malfoy, I don't know exactly what happened, but you can't blame yourself. Everyone has different circumstances that they have to deal with, and sometimes we can't help that. What's important is that we try to be there for each other, but if they couldn’t do that then maybe they just need time."
Harry stood motionless for a long time, staring at the railing that Draco had gone over. Only when the sky started to lighten did he move, finding a Death Eater's wand and summoning a Patronus. He told it his message and sent it to Hogwarts. Then he collapsed to his knees and waited.
But instead he let them disapparate him, and then he was looking at a different castle. Absently, he was aware of being taken up to the infirmary and his wounds being treated. They gave him a potion and he faded into sleep.
Malfoy didn't respond, only furrowed his brow. Since he wasn't immediately shutting him down, Harry saw that as an opportunity and stuck out his hand, taking them back to all those years ago when they had first met.
"Now that I've walked all the way here I don't much feel like it, to be honest. Besides, I don't think they'll be out that much later anyway."
Hermione's brow creased, and she glanced up at Ron and Neville. "Some other Slytherins are missing too," Neville added.
"Sure," Hermione replied, though Harry was fairly certain everyone had heard Hagrid's announcements up and down the platform.
They were sitting in the Great Hall for breakfast the first day of classes. Harry knew that there were likely to be mixed reactions among his friends when he told them of the proposal he had given Malfoy to start over. Ron's mouth was hanging open, while Hermione's was in a tight line.
He raised his wand again and twisted his wrist upwards. Harry instantly recognised the movement from all the times he'd seen Hermione perform it during the war, and Lockhart all those years ago. He knew what Draco was going to do.
It was at one of these study sessions, however, that Harry noticed Malfoy's dark circles were returning.
His father looked to the others in the room and with a wave of his hand they left. He beckoned to Draco to join him at the railing overlooking the ocean. Draco tried to unclench his hands at his sides and slowly walked over, careful not to stand too close.
"It'll be great, won't it?" Ron went on. "I mean, he helped out in the final battle and everything."
"Oh, I have to disagree, Mr Potter. You fought valiantly in many battles during the Second Wizarding War, most notable of course the Battle of Hogwarts. I'm sure there'd be a thing or two you could teach us."
"Sort of," Harry said with sigh, tossing the book that was still in his lap to the side and laying back on the grass. Draco did the same beside him. "It's more like memories that I've tried to repress pushing themselves to the surface. Forcing me to relive them. It doesn't happen all that often and usually there's something that triggers it."
Harry led him to a space where the walls were covered in mirrors, reaching all the way up to the arched ceiling.
"What's your Patronus?" Draco asked from beside him. "I just realised you never actually demonstrated in class."
Draco pushed those thoughts out of his head as Filch brought him to the painting concealing the entrance to the new eighth year dormitories and told him the password. It was ridiculous, he thought, that he had to share a dormitory with the other eighth years and not just his house. Most of them hated him. But he knew there were a great deal of Slytherins that hated him too, and at least he had a private room here.
Thank you so much for all the support on this so far! Also just a reminder to please listen to the song for each chapter, I recommend listening while reading. :)
"Molly's going to be furious at me, though," Harry said when he pulled away. "I promised her I wasn't going to get into any danger this year. This makes my eighth year in a row of nearly dying."
The names and faces of all the Death Eaters Draco knew of, terrifying witches and wizards, flashed in his mind. His father wanted to free them.
"He was," came a voice from behind Draco, and his blood turned to ice. He had thought he would never hear that voice outside of his nightmares again. But as he turned, he saw him standing there looking just like he had before the war.
Ever so gently, Harry managed pry the shard away from Draco's wrist. As soon as he dropped it, Draco shoulders collapsed. Harry wrapped his arms around him and pulled him close. Draco cried harder than Harry had ever seen him cry before, great shuddering sobs coming in wave after wave. All Harry could do was hold onto him and ride it out, Draco clutching onto him like a life support.
"Protective now, aren't we?" Snyde continued to look between Harry and Draco, both disarmed and pretty much unable to defend themselves. Snyde looked like a kid on Christmas day. "And I thought my night was made when we found Malfoy. But now we have a betrayer of the Dark Lord… and the one who killed him."
!" Snyde went soaring backwards, landing hard. He started to get straight back up, however, as the other two recovered from their shock and took their wands back out. They immediately had to defend against the onslaught of hexes and jinxes that Harry threw at them, but once Snyde re-joined them they quickly went on the offensive. Harry was pushed back, until one of them got in a lucky disarming shot and his wand flew from his hand. Snyde swept his wand in a wide arc, and Harry was thrown against the wall and held there, immobilised.
Draco didn't turn around, so Harry went and sat down next to him. He gave Draco a once over to see if he looked okay, but his face was blank, devoid of any emotions. Harry pressed his mouth into a tight line as he stared out at the lake.
He remembered. When he finally opened his eyes, he collapsed back in his seat, exhausted. Hermione did the same, letting go of his hand. He realised his face was wet and he wiped away the tears that had fallen.
Ron raised his eyebrows, but before he could say anything, Hermione said, "That's a great idea, it'll be good for house unity!"
There was a sudden exchange of whispers and grins between the students, Ron actually letting out a 'whoop!'
"Okay. We'll find a way out." With his arm around Draco's waist, Harry lifted him and they made their way to the door, which Harry opened with ease. Draco wondered why it hadn't been locked, a feeling of dread growing in the pit of his stomach.
"Harry, Harry!" Ron whispered loudly, looking like he was about to burst as Harry sat back down. "Guess who the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher is?"
Snyde shrugged and punched Draco across the face, throwing him to the floor. The cloak was off Harry in an instant, his wand raised.
"Nooo!" Draco really wanted to point out that he sounded like a child, but kept his mouth shut. "Why, did something happen?" Draco tried to keep his face blank but was apparently unsuccessful. "What happened, Malfoy?"
He squeezed his eyes shut and reached for his magic, summoning the last of his strength, and apparated just before he hit the water.
"Because I care about you, that's why!" Draco was stunned into silence at that, and even Potter looked like he was shocked he had let it slip. "I won't stand by and watch you destroy yourself."
He was trapped in this dark room, so alike the dungeon beneath the Malfoy Manor where he was once imprisoned. Harry could feel his breaths quickening as the two places blurred into one, the past and the present converging until he was once again at the mercy of Death Eaters, a sitting duck waiting for Voldemort to arrive. It was happening all over again.
Finally, Draco looked at Harry, and there was only pure fear in his eyes. Harry was rooted to the spot, unable to think, as Draco pleaded desperately with his eyes for a plan, any plan.
From his wand burst a falcon made of mist and light, soaring above them with elegance and power. Harry let out a whoop, and Draco laughed.
He had just wanted to be get away from everyone, to be alone so that he could relieve some of the immense pain that he was feeling. But of course, Potter had found him, and now he knew about Draco's coping mechanism.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Okay, because if you can't, we're sticking together, even if that means I move into Hogwarts for the school year with you."
Over the course of the next week, Harry and Malfoy's Potions project started to move along more, and they began having study sessions outside of class. Harry also invited him to join in on group study sessions for other classes, and sometimes he would, sometimes he wouldn't. But he was always there for the one-on-one sessions, and Harry definitely counted that as a win.
The curse hit Harry in the back, right where it would have hit Draco, and Harry went down. His scream tore through Draco and he fell to his knees as Harry collapsed in the sand, arching against the pain as if he could get away from it.
The night progressed much the same. Harry and Draco would sneak touches under the table, or when they would go up to the bar together. The others seemed oblivious, and Draco was living for it. The more butterbeers that flowed, the livelier the group got, and Draco found himself actively engaging in everyone's conversation. He was starting to feel like he belonged, and it made him swell with warmth and pride. Especially as he watched Harry laughing at something Ron said, and thought how stunningly perfect he was, from his smile to his hair to his strikingly green eyes. When they all took a shot of firewhiskey and Draco noticed the flush that crept into Harry's cheeks, he pulled him by the arm away and towards the bar.
Walking down the castle's quiet corridors, Draco wasn’t paying much attention to surroundings, and so he almost didn't notice the large ornate door that appeared next to him as he walked past. Glancing back, he was sure it hadn't been there a moment before, and that was when he recognised it.
Harry's hair was whipped back and forth in the harsh sea wind. He looked out at the water, then up at the crumbling castle above them, taking it all in. They were on a secluded section of the beach along from the cliffs, walled in by great mounds of rock that provided little shelter from the wind and spray, but it was the best Draco could come up with.
"I draw them out and ask them more about whatever cult it is they're forming, and you stay nearby hidden under the cloak so you can listen and jump in if you need to."
Hermione only nodded. A water pitcher appeared in front of them, and they both drank. When they stood, the chairs, table and everything on it disappeared.
Pushing off from the wall, his feet carried him in a direction he knew well and soon he was atop the Astronomy Tower, pacing back and forth.
Several things happened at once. Draco saw the flash of deadly green light from Lucius's wand arching toward him; he saw behind it the maniacal expression on his father's face; he heard Harry's anguished scream; and he felt a power reaching out for him, strange and at the same time, utterly familiar. It wrapped around him in a bubble of protection, and when it was hit by the killing curse, it exploded outwards in all directions. Draco felt the force of it like a tsunami, throwing him backwards, and then there was only open air.
"It doesn't matter." Potter only stared at him, waiting for an answer, until Draco sighed and figured he may as well tell him. "Pansy and Blaise aren't going anymore so I just don't want to be the only Slytherin there. That's all."
Draco sat there for a long time, waiting for his headache to die down and the shooting pains in his lungs to go away. He definitely had some fresh bruises. But that was what he had wanted wasn't it? He shook his head at himself. Stupid.
"I know you were always somewhat… reluctant." His father stepped up to him and laid a hand on his shoulder. Draco tensed in an effort not to flinch away. "But I know you'll make me proud."
He was still undecided about whether to find Draco or not when he found himself at the bottom of the stairs to the Astronomy Tower. He took a deep breath. If Draco happened to be up to there, he would tell him, and he if he wasn't then he would leave it for now and think on it some more.
Draco's breaths quickened as he raced down hall after hall. What had he done? He hadn't meant to panic, hadn't wanted to run. But he had been overwhelmed, and now it was too late.
"There will be no curfew forced upon you, and you will be allowed to venture into Hogsmeade as you wish, no need for supervised weekend trips and permission notes."
Harry checked his watch. "It's 4pm." Draco's eyes widened. "I was starting to get a little worried, and I was going to take you Madam Promfrey if you didn't wake up by tonight. Good thing you did, otherwise I would've had to go to drinks tonight without a date."
Malfoy looked away quickly, giving his mother a kiss on the cheek. Narcissa gave Harry a small, grateful smile before leaving. Harry had, after all, vouched for them both during the Death Eater Trials to ensure that neither mother nor son went to Azkaban, unlike Lucius Malfoy, who's sentencing had been immediate and non-negotiable.
"I think McGonagall would have a fit if you two started doing potions experiments at the school. Slughorn would probably love it though."
Hermione pointed her wand at him, and ever so slowly twisted her wrist downwards. She closed her eyes and Harry followed suit, focussing on the feeling of her magic flowing from her hand into his. He tried to empty his mind, willing the memories to come back, even though he didn't know if that would help.
Ron's face fell a little, and Harry knew he was remembering Fred. He saw Hermione's hand subtly brush against Ron's. "Yeah, we've been okay," he said.
"We can tell her tomorrow. You just spent a whole day recovering, and I think that going out will do you some good as well. We don't need to worry about that right now."
Harry was knocked down, but immediately scrambled back to his feet. All around him Death Eaters lay motionless, but when he looked to the space where Draco had been standing, it was empty. There was only the railing and the open sky.
"Wait," Harry said. "You're not going to tell me that it's impossible, that it has to be the person who took them, something like that?"
"Of course, it's fine. I actually think it's a good idea," she said. "He doesn't seem to have any friends in Slytherin anymore, so it makes sense."
"It’s strange being back here," Hermione said as they each took a seat. "Alright. Oh, if I had just brought –" A small pile of books appeared on the table, and Hermione grinned. "Oh, I missed this."
"To Harry Potter!" they cried, and Draco found himself joining in. As he took a sip of butterbeer, he noticed Potter watching him over the rim of his own glass. His face was a bit flushed – from the alcohol, he told himself – and it made his eyes seem even more green. Draco made himself hold his gaze until Potter's attention was drawn away by someone else.
Draco nodded, and gave Harry a tight smile as they parted ways. Draco wandered for a bit, not really sure where he was going, until he found himself back at the top of the Astronomy Tower. He took a seat on the edge with his legs dangling over and his arms resting on the lower railing, looking out over the castle and the lake beyond. He felt the wind on his face and tried to let his feelings for Harry be carried away with it. But he couldn't let them go.
Harry put his arms around Draco once again, and he felt his breaths return to normal as he calmed down. Draco was holding onto his waist, and Harry didn't want to let go so he readjusted them until they were laying back down, still holding onto each other.
Draco pointed with his other hand to the spot on his wrist. Harry brushed a thumb over it, feather light. Draco looked up at him and saw that there was a tear running down Harry's cheek. Without thinking, he reached up and brushed it away, and his hand lingered on his cheek as Harry looked up and their eyes met. They were so close, their breaths mingling, and all Draco wanted to do was close the distance. But Harry shifted back slightly and looked away, and Draco let his hand fall.
Soon the class was set up with practice dummies for students to practice spells on, the kind of spells that you would use in a real fight if you wanted to stay alive. Harry and Draco were at the back of the group waiting for a turn, watching the bolts of colour from various spells hitting the dummies and sometimes blasting them away, or reducing them to dust. Dumbledore would simply wave his wand and the dummy would reappear good as new.
back, but it must've sounded off because Harry frowned at him. "You okay?" Draco just nodded, not trusting his voice.
Harry gave him a knowing smile and went back to the rest of the class. Under Harry's instruction, the room was soon filled with various glowing animals darting about, lighting up the space. When the class finally came to an end, Harry came straight back over to Draco.
"I think a better question would be why am I keeping you alive? And frankly, I think I've run out of reasons." Lucius pointed his wand at Harry, and Draco felt the fear in his heart and the pit of his stomach electrify, setting his every nerve on end.
Harry gaped at him. He had expected much more of a rebuttal, but he hadn't even questioned Harry switching to Draco's first name. He looked to Hermione.
"What?" asked Harry, looking back at him and noticing a mischievous glint in his eye. Harry was honestly thrilled that he was able to see this side of Draco at all.
Draco. Draco had been at the Malfoy Manor too, had lied to his father so that Harry might get away, or at least be bought some time. And Draco was here now, pulling him back to the present. He needed him.
"Yes, but you're the one who taught us, Harry," Hermione said – Draco had finally taken to calling them by their first names.
Harry smiled. Though he knew that they were moving into new territory for them, he wanted to stay, desperately. He climbed over Draco and got into the other side of the bed, turning the lights off with a flick of his wand. They lay a couple feet apart, but between them their hands remained joined, until they both fell asleep.
Every time he closed his eyes, Harry saw the blast hitting Draco and exploding back. When he couldn't take it anymore, he got up and made his way out of the infirmary.
Harry's lips were soft against his, and he gripped him tight, wanting to hold him as close as possible. Their lips parted and moved together, deepening the kiss, and Draco let himself be utterly consumed. His hands roamed through Harry's hair and gripped his collar, while Harry clutched at his back, pulling them impossibly closer and melding them together.
There, standing across from him, was Draco. He looked battered and beaten, but he was fully formed and corporeal. Harry blinked, and he didn’t disappear.
"Yeah, right…" Harry was still a bit perplexed, but just then he noticed Draco enter the Great Hall. He called him over, indicating for him to sit down.
Draco woke with a jolt, sitting upright and gasping for breath. He was sweaty and tangled in the sheets. He could feel a panic attack coming on and began clawing at his throat. But then Harry was there, wrapping an arm around his shoulders and putting a hand on his cheek.
Draco only laughed some more, and Harry couldn't stop staring at his lips. He felt a flush creeping up his face, and quickly turned away. "I think our free period is probably over by now, we should get going."
"Okay, okay." Harry held up his hands in a gesture of surrender. He knew that might be pushing it too far this early on, but he had hopes to win him over eventually.
Draco was staring at the mural of the Black family tree that decorated the walls of the room, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his jeans. Harry paused in the doorway, leaning against the frame and following Draco's gaze to where there was a small scorch mark at the end of the branch leading down from Lucius and Narcissa, the name Draco Malfoy in elegant cursive underneath.
"No!" he shouted, and Lucius turned his wand on Draco. Draco knew he should be feeling the adrenaline of fight or flight kicking in, but all he could feel in that moment was relief that Lucius was now focusing on him instead of Harry.
Her last words were practically spat at him, and Draco finally did flinch at that. He felt his stomach caving in, and he looked to Blaise for some assistance, but there was only a cold indifference in his face. Pansy sat back down with a huff.
After several tense moments where Draco wasn't sure if Harry had heard him, Draco heard his breathing even out and the shuffling of his feet as he got up. He heard footsteps coming towards him, and then a sharp intake of breath.
For several terrifying moments, Draco plummeted. He couldn't take in a breath, the air ripped from his lungs as the waves and the rocky cliffs rose up towards him. He could see his death hurling at him more surely than it had when the killing curse was fired at him.
He realised he couldn't breathe properly, hadn't been breathing properly – or maybe he had been holding his breath the entire time. He tried to suck in rasping breaths, quicker and quicker, but it only made him more panicked.
Harry’s sudden intake of breath was louder than he expected, and he stepped back behind the corner. He heard the swish of Malfoy’s robes as he spun around, and in a panic Harry quickly started towards the exit before he could be spotted.
Draco Malfoy hadn't wanted to come back to Hogwarts. There were too many foul memories, and he was struggling enough as it was and knew going back to school would only make things worse. But his mother had insisted, and in all honesty, he had grown weary of seeing her wander the halls of Malfoy Manor, lost in her own thoughts. Draco supposed he was pretty lost too.
His luggage would be brought up shortly, but all Draco needed was his wand to relieve some of the pressure of the day. And it had been a very difficult day – leaving the Manor after feeling like he was trapped there all summer, dealing with his mother fussing over him as she said goodbye, returning to the school that brought back so many memories, and seeing Potter…
The sun was hovering over the ocean now, casting the ancient castle in soft gold light. Harry looked towards the cliffs, searching the waves crashing below. His chest was tight, and he wanted to throw himself into the water to look for him, to bring back his body.
When he reached the Great Hall, he headed straight for the Slytherin table but gave it a quick sweep of his eyes as he walked over. No sign of those seventh years, but there was something else. One too many people were looking up at him as he passed. In fact, there were a lot of eyes following him from around the room. Surely they hadn't roughed up his face as well and he'd just been too dazed to remember, right?
No. He steeled himself and continued on his way to the Great Hall. He wasn't going to let this stupid attack bring him back down when he had been doing so well the last few weeks. He hadn't even cut since the first night he arrived, and he didn't want to fall back into that habit just yet.
Potter nodded. "But if you're being your true self, then that can't be wrong. So be whoever you want to be, Draco Malfoy."
"Good, good." Hagrid looked a bit awkward, so he went on to say, "Well, eighth years are to meet Professor McGonagall in the entrance hall before going into the Great Hall, can yer pass on the message for me? I've gotta take the little ones in across the lake, yer know the drill."
Harry's scream ripped from him as green light shot from Lucius's wand. Harry felt his raw power reach out for Draco in a last desperate plea to save him, and as the curse hit it ricocheted outwards in an explosion of light. The magic blasted outwards in all directions, throwing everyone back.
After a long time, he spoke, saying the two words he had been most afraid to voice but knowing that it was the truth. "He's dead."
Once he felt better again, he realised that someone was watching him. Looking over to the doors to the castle, he saw someone he had come to terms with not seeing here this year at all. Draco Malfoy. Next to him stood his luggage and his mother, Narcissa. What Harry's attention was drawn to, however, was how gaunt Malfoy looked. He defiantly had his shoulders back and his chin high, but Harry could see even from this distance that there were deep circles under his eyes and his cheeks were hollow. His hair was unkempt, without its usual gel (which Harry had always thought was over the top anyway) or even a comb through.
She picked up the first one and leafed through it, until she found the page she was looking for. Harry waited patiently until she put the book back down and held out her hand, looking confident. Harry took it and Hermione took out her wand.
"However," McGonagall continued, "these privileges can be revoked if they are abused." The students quieted down at that. "Finally, your dorms. Along with the rebuilding of the castle, we have constructed a separate tower for eighth years so that you may have your own space, and each dorm is a private bedroom with its own en suite. You also have a shared common room, but you are still welcome in your houses' common rooms. That will be all, you may now join the feast."
Next to him, Draco jumped, and Harry tried not to laugh. It was late at night, and they'd been wandering the dark halls for a little while now but had seen no sign of the Slytherins yet.
"Draco Malfoy," Harry said with feigned shock, "choosing to be at Hogwarts when he doesn’t have to? Outrageous."
Harry reached up to touch his cheek, and Draco leaned into it. "Of course they would. I'm family, so that means you are too."
He continued to follow Draco down corridor after corridor, weaving his way through the quieter parts of the castle. Harry was about to suggest trying another night, when up ahead three figures rounded the corner. Draco immediately came to a halt and tensed up, and Harry stopped a safe distance behind him, still hidden under the invisibility cloak.
When they had both finished their tea, Potter put down his cup and looked at Draco. "I know I've said before to come find me if you ever need to. But I mean it now more than ever. Draco, next time you feel the need to… to cut, please come find me instead. Promise me."
Was Draco flirting with him? Harry had to turn back to look up through the branches of the tree above him, tearing his eyes away from those depthless grey ones before he started to overthink things. He would only drive himself crazy.
He nodded, and somehow managed to get the door open with the tray in his hands. Before he could leave, Draco said, "Potter… thank you."
He felt like he should feel ashamed of breaking down, but somehow Potter made him feel like he was in the safest place in the world. He had cast a charm to get the fire going properly, and he was watching the flames and only occasionally glancing up to check on Draco, giving him a small smile each time. He seemed to know exactly what Draco needed, and he was immensely grateful for it.
Harry laughed, and kissed him again briefly. Draco reached up to fix his hair. "It's fine, really. You should head back inside," Harry said, stepping back.
Draco was apparated to the outside of an old stone castle perched on the edge of a cliff. Far below, waves crashed relentlessly against the rocks and the air tasted of salt. The building looked like it was crumbling under the weight of time and Draco was weary to go inside, but he was led in by the Death Eaters, Snyde and the other two Slytherin seventh years. He was taken to a cavernous room with a high ceiling that was open on one side, a metal railing the only thing between him and the drop to the ocean. He kept away from the edge.
Draco treasured every moment he had with Harry. They had practically moved into the same room by now, but winter break was approaching and Draco worried about what that would mean for them.
Draco was shocked, but there was another feeling swelling up inside him. Was that… hope? No, don't be ridiculous, Draco thought as he squashed it down.
As promised, here is the epilogue, I hope you enjoy! I'm still working on the rewrite of plummet from Draco's perspective, so I'm not sure when that will be up, but thank you for sticking around for these bonus chapters! x
Harry was determined to help Draco as much as he possibly could, and Draco seemed like he was finally relenting and letting Harry help, much to his relief. And since that night he had finally broken down and let Harry comfort him, Harry had felt like they were closer than ever before, and he didn't want to let go of that feeling.
"Not going anywhere were you Malfoy?" the one behind him asked. He was the tallest of the three; the others were shorter than him but made up for it in what Draco hoped was just fat, not muscle.
"No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," Draco said, dropping his arm. Seemed like he was just full of apologies tonight. "I didn't mean to yell at you."
Draco looked back at Snyde, and Harry saw his fear give way to anger, and then the hope started to slowly slip away too. Draco looked at Harry again, and Harry sucked in a sharp breath as Draco took a slow step towards the Slytherins, then another. He shook his head as Draco's wand slowly turned, until it faced Harry, and Draco was standing between him and the Slytherins.
They dropped him, and he slid to the floor clutching his stomach. Dazed, he looked up to see they had disappeared. He hadn’t even gotten the names of the other two. Not that he could report them. It was bad enough that every Slytherin as well as the general public hated him and his family. Calling out other Slytherins, and sons of Death Eaters no less, would only being him more trouble.
As soon as Harry saw Malfoy get up and speed walk for the doors, he followed him. Through corridors and up staircases, seemingly at random, Harry followed him. He couldn't believe how terrible that article had been and couldn't even begin to know how difficult this was for Malfoy. All he could do was be there for him, as he had said he would be.
