"I suppose." Harry didn't want to tell her that all the effort was making him more uncomfortable and more aware that he hadn't missed his wife as much as he should have.
"It's going to be all right, Harry." He hugged him, and the physical contact made Harry feel safe. "I'm going to be by your side all the way. I know it's going to be hard. Things are going to get messy, and the press is going to have a field day. However, you have to go through this. For your sake and for the children. In a year, this will all be behind us, and all we'll have to concentrate on is making the wizarding world a better place, and bringing our children up."
"I guess I am a bit over-enthusiastic. Let's change the subject. Have you seen my kids? How are yours?"
"Since I was old enough to know how babies were made. Don't say you haven't noticed," he shrugged.
"Yes," Harry still answered.
They went close to it, and Harry made many pictures in the light of the setting sun.
"What am I going to do?"
"Can we really afford it?" Draco wondered. He was always worried about money.
"Well, we have two options. You can either go back to your husband." He looked at Hermione, who shook her head in response. "Or you could take my help," he said, looking straight into her eyes.
Harry knew from the sound of Draco's voice that he was trying not to laugh.
"Yes. I had more energy. It was like the fog I had been stumbling in had suddenly lifted and I could see everything more clearly. I must have been ill."
"I only wanted to please my wife, sir."
"More like none at all."
His musings were interrupted by his wife when she got up and suggested a bit of fun in bed. He sighed and cast a last look at the tree to make sure that all the presents were under it, then reluctantly headed upstairs.
Their first course arrived in a few minutes and it was one of the bubbling soups. Harry expected blueberries or something like that, but tasted mushrooms. It was actually very delicious and the bubbling felt funny in his mouth. He polished it off with a smile and was in a much better mood after having something in his stomach finally, even though he was breaking his diet. Mushrooms were among the banned foods.
* * *
The next day, Harry went to work with a distinct feeling of dread. By now,  Ron probably knew that Harry had taken Hermione in and he was not known for  dealing well. As he stepped inside the office, he scanned the area for the  familiar redhead. Ron was nowhere to be seen, so with a sigh, he made his  way to his own desk, edging around that of others'. He barely sat down on  his chair, when he heard the voice of his boss, who demanded that he join  him in his office. Harry cringed and scanned his mind for things he could  have done to warrant such a treatment, but he couldn't think of anything.
The International Floo was a difficult ride. It wasn't exactly like a regular Flo, but rather like the carts at Gringotts. Harry had to sit in a seat-like contraption and have a spell cast on him that would guide him to his chosen destination. It started from an office that was situated on a side street off of Diagon Alley. Harry seriously loathed that mode of transportation and would have rather flown. However, the thought of sitting on a plane for about seventeen hours put him off.
“You knew,” the tall man said by way of a greeting.
“Master Harry Potter, sir?”
"Mr. Stewart, what is this about?" he asked, wanting to break the  uncomfortable silence.
“Yes, Tinky?” he asked, hoping that he got the name of the elf right.
"From what I heard, when they're not at school, they're mostly with Molly. She's not very vocal about the situation though." Harry remembered that the last time they had lunch at The Burrow, the subject of Hermione was tactfully avoided.
Harry sat in the uncomfortable couch in his living room. He took a sip from his cup of mulled wine as he was looking at the large Christmas tree and got lost in the events of the past year. It was hard to believe that the next day was Christmas morning already.
Harry stared in amazement that she had actually done it and Draco had actually liked the present. The other man disappeared into the closet and reappeared dressed.
"You never said a thing!"
"Pool room?" Albus perked up at the news. He didn't like most sports, but the few times they had vacationed at a beach, he had enjoyed spending time in the water.
"Yeah," Harry agreed, grinning. "Brilliant."
So the time came for it for Draco, but though Harry's first instinct was to accept readily, he stopped to consider it for a moment.
"Ugh, I hope this time you'll make much more pleasant ones. Anyway, Hermione is waiting on the eastern veranda with tea." He walked away, leading the other man around the great home.
"Draco, what do you think? Could Al join Scorpius?"
first." He gestured to the correct person.
The control dissolved as another disaster struck at the end of his year in Hogwarts. He was kidnapped by the latest DADA teacher, a young woman named Amethist Delacour. Dumbledork probably thought that a French woman wouldn't be a Death Eater. Well, wrong, again. He was tied to an altar, blood drawn, again, added to a potion, again, Voldemort took a bath, again, and was restored in body to his former glory. Granted, a bit older version of what Harry saw in the diary, but more healthy-looking than before.
"I see you already started the paperwork," she sneered as a way of greeting.
Harry was a bit miffed about what the man was saying. He clearly thought him to be stupid and not even a bit clever. He thought about correcting the bloke, but then he realised that perhaps it was for the best if he was considered unassuming and easily led.
“I have a position in the Wizengamot?” Harry said, and then almost cried out as Malfoy’s eyes were clouding again. “This is the first time I heard about it!” he shouted, attempting to calm the other man.
"I felt it when you entered the wards. Always the Malfoys keyed into them know when someone passes through the gates, even in your case, when you have permission. You certainly took your time."
"Yeah. It would be like getting back at Ron."
"I'm sure this year is much better. Look, I made breakfast!" At Harry's raised eyebrow Draco blushed, and quickly corrected his statement. "Okay, the house-elves made it, and I brought it up. I thought we could have a nice breakfast together, and face the kids afterwards."
"You were a kid and Voldemort was living in your house. It must have been hard to think clearly at the time." Harry tried to lighten the load.
"But all the purebloods have been furious with me, telling me that I should go back to Ron. He is a pureblood too, Harry," she pointed out.
"Yes. I'll have to go talk to Hermione's solicitor."
“No, James. It’s not because of Draco. It’s because it doesn’t work anymore. If it did, then I wouldn’t have looked Draco’s way." Harry wanted the boy to see his reasons. "Please understand, I’m not that kind of a man. I’ve been faithful to your mother for all these years, but I realised that even when she’s here, it’s like being with a stranger. We don’t make each other happy. Therefore, I’ve decided to get a divorce. That I found my happiness with Draco is not connected. Maybe, the two are connected just in that when I closed that chapter of my life, I realised that there was a new chapter waiting for me.” Harry smiled at the blond. “I will never stop loving the three of you. I also want us all to be happy here. I think you have been this past week, and I would like to continue this way.”
"I don't know."
They made their way through a corridor where already many people were milling about. Harry didn't have time to guess who they were or who they pretended to be as he was pulled along by his wife. Ginny was searching for her family. They had a quick look in the ballroom where a string quartet was playing a waltz and then stepped into the dining room, which was conveniently set up with a buffet table, a champagne table and several smaller dining-tables that could seat six people around them.
sitting there?" Harry heard from next to him. He turned to Ginny and nodded. "Who is she with?" his wife inquired.
"Which four?"
Once Harry was at a safe distance, he stepped on the path again, letting the gravel make sounds under his feet. His thoughts were still on the blond man. He was obviously interested in men, so why did he marry Astoria? Then he remembered that Draco talked about how they were arranged to be married as toddlers. Also, it was possible that he was not only interested in men, but women as well. It wasn't that unheard of, even in the Muggle world.
"Ask Dinky if she was giving you a potion."
"Okay, Harry, talk."
"That's why I found everything in my room this morning!" James spoke up. "We're still going to school though, right?"
"Hello," Scorpius greeted with delight in his eyes. "It's too cold to be outside, but grandpa said we could be in the pool room."
Harry knew that the oath was coming. He put his right hand over his heart and his left slightly in the air in preparation. He repeated every word as it was spoken.
Harry put on his best puzzled look at Arthur's statement.
From the train, they quickly made it outside the train station, where they did get a taxi. Draco wasn't that ready to join the Romans on the many crowded buses that passed by. Hailing the taxi was when Harry first noticed the heat. It was a lot warmer than it had been in London, but not as hot as in Thailand. He was somewhat glad, as Thailand was a bit too hot for his system.
Ron next to him was undoubtedly a Chudley Cannons player. His orange robes clashed horridly with his hair and even Harry cringed at the sight. Of course, he couldn't identify which one because he didn't follow Quidditch all that much anymore, just the major events. The Cannons hadn't made it to anything important in a long while. The younger Weasley was currently doing what he always did when presented with a vast amount of food. He was shovelling it into his mouth, grinning around his mouthful. He quickly got up once his plate was empty, probably going for another helping. Harry stared after him for a moment, but quickly diverted his attention to Arthur.
"He's getting his wish." Harry downed another glass.
"Ary!" Draco called and a young female elf appeared. "Lead Mr Potter to his room, please," he commanded.
“Sure.”
“Naw, I knew it too,” Scorpius said, giggling, and the boys shared a smile.
As he was contemplating the book in front of him, staring at the woman on the cover, he heard Jingle Bells again. He turned around to see Draco Malfoy enter the shop. He had to school his features to hide the delight he felt upon seeing the man who was becoming his friend and ally in the recent months.
"Okay, the alcohol is hitting you now. You drank so fast; it just caught up to you. Now why don't you quit before you pass out?" Draco tried to reason.
Draco clearly sneered at her choice in literature and headed towards the back of the shop, clearly dismissing the couple.
"Al, do you really hate school?"
"Oh right!" He shrugged dismissively. "Flat as a board, athletic. Small wonder you didn't realise your interest in boys by then."
The children squealed at the sight of their gifts and dived straight in. Harry stood watching the ruckus with a wide grin. In these moments, he sometimes remembered the time when he was heading towards the Forbidden Forest, ready to die. He thought it was all over, and he would never get a taste of real happiness. How wrong he had been. He looked over to Ginny, who had made it all possible and wanted to thank her. However, he was stopped by the frown on her face, and then he recalled how she always grumbled about the wrapping papers beings thrown about the room. She was always so afraid that her expensive furniture would get damaged in the commotion. He was about to wrap his arms around her to make sure that she would not interrupt them, when Dinky appeared and gave them both a cup of hot chocolate. Harry smiled down gratefully at the little elf.
As always, I thank my two betas for all their work. Faye, because I can ask her stuff about Britain that I may not know, and because she's my cheerleader. Plus she keeps talking about Drarry, which leads me to thinking about my fic, which leads me to writing more. She's like my muse. Icicle, I have to thank, for being my meticulous beta. She's still doing all the comma corrections, which is a feat in itself. I hope all her personal problems are handled now, and her uni work is going well.
Lunch could not come soon enough for Harry. Ron was not in a good mood and he was trying everything to calm the man down, but he kept spewing hatred. He was relieved when he could go and sit down in his favourite pub. Good thing that Ron always brought home-made food and ate it in the cafeteria. They did not have a lot of money with his wife at home and two kids. Aurors were not making a lot of money and Harry was glad for his inheritance. Though at the rate Ginny was spending money abroad… Soon enough Hermione appeared as well, and she joined his table.
“Yes, of course, Malfoy.” She was a bit irritated by his question.
"Years ago." Harry fell silent for a while, silently asking himself the same question. When had he surrendered his own wants and desires to that of Ginny? "It all seems a bit hazy now. I got back with Ginny right after the War. During that hellish year, all I could think about was her and how after it was all over, I could be with her. She felt like home. The Burrow was the warmest and safest place I've ever known and she was a piece of it. So I was with her during that supplementary year. You didn't attend, as I recall, you finished your schooling at home." Draco just silently nodded. "We sat for our NEWTs. Ginny was supposed to finish a year later, but she studied hard and could sit for the NEWTs with us. After school I moved to the Burrow. I proposed to Ginny as I was afraid that the Weasleys wouldn't let me stay in her room otherwise. We soon joined the Auror programme and Ginny played Quidditch. We got married in
"Breakfast?" Draco asked, arching a perfectly shaped eyebrow. "That's supposed to be an omelette?" he pointed to the plates.
He looked around and had no idea where he was. He needed to get back to the Floo, but he wasn't even sure if it was open so late at night.
"Great idea!"
He reached for the lube on the bedside table, and slicked his fingers, so that he could lubricate the opening. After that, he coated his own cock liberally, which was rock hard, and slightly oozing his fluids. Harry took a deep breath, forcing himself to relax a bit. He lined himself up, and Draco spread his legs out further, to make more room for him. He was watching Harry intently, his eyes clouded with desire. Harry slowly inched himself in, breathing hard as the tip was in. The orifice was incredibly tight, inspite of all the stretching he had done. He looked down to see himself inside, the pink cock in front of him standing hard. When he was sure he wasn't going to come, he went in deeper, until he was fully in the other man's body. He sighed, and looked up to see Draco's face. He was smiling.
Draco stared at him, but it wasn't the amused smirk Harry expected. The blond looked a bit scared. Harry suspected it was because of his feelings. However, he needed to see if kissing Draco sober felt as good as drunk. For once, he had to put his own needs before others, or in this case, Draco Malfoy's.
"Look at the statues, Harry. The men are beautiful, strong and muscular. So life-like too." Draco drew his attention to the figures. "This is what I like the most about Bernini. It's almost as if his characters could stand up and walk away any moment."
Harry was glad that that was over and hoped that the ringing in his ears  would stop in a few hours. His colleagues around him were looking at him  with narrowed eyes. They probably didn't like being subjected to his family  matters. He let out an exhausted sigh and left the room, deciding to go to  Flourish and Blotts to pick up a few books on Wizarding Law. He was only  gone for an hour, but when he returned he found that his desk was occupied  by another wizard, who was talking excitedly with Ron. Harry went to his  desk and dropped the books he had bought onto it with a loud bang. He knew  his face was dark, but he hadn't had the best of days and felt himself  entitled to some anger.
Let me give you another warning, if you haven't gathered as much already. There is going to be a sexual encounter between two men in this chapter and in the following chapters as well. If you don't want to read anything explicit, please read the edited version on fanfiction net. Continue reading at your own risk.
Scorpius was a delightful boy. Cute and approachable, still smart and obviously intelligent, Harry was sure that he would get along with Albus famously. He wasn't so sure about James though. Sadly, his oldest seemed to like rough games, which he was trying to discourage, but Ron, as his uncle, was all the more keen to encourage the behaviour. Harry feared that since his relationship with Ron was only going to get worse, his eldest would suffer the most. He would not take well to the environment in Malfoy Manor, Harry was sure of it. Still, if he managed to support the gentler side of his son, perhaps he would calm down a bit. Not that there was anything wrong with boys being boys, but James sometimes seemed to try to ignite fear in the hearts of his younger siblings and his playmates. Harry wondered what would happen once Scorpius and James met. He was bound to see soon enough.
"It's the details, Mr Potter. Mr Picard is very precise and always explains everything in great detail. He also likes to introduce Potions in a rather novel way. He actually spins a story around them. So his books are not just informative but exciting as well. They also need to be read in order."
"It's the handsome mister!" came a voice from beside him and he had to look down to see the boy from the club. Apparently, he hadn't found another handsome mister so far.
"The Dark Families want to keep the separation, which is partly why they used to be all for total separation, not even allowing Muggle-borns in. However, the newer generation - our generation has realised that a Muggle-born in the bloodline doesn't dilute it, because the magic is still strong. Regrettably, that had been the misconception in the past. Remember, the Dark Lord had been a half-blood, so are you, Potter, and Severus Snape was as well. These examples have led to new studies being conducted that have found that Muggle-borns are born when generations of suppressed magic combines in a person, manifesting itself in a great burst. Apparently, all Muggles have a limited amount of magic in them, so no one is completely without magic." He seemed very excited at that point, his grey eyes were shining almost to the point of twinkling.
"I'm fine," he grunted out, not willing to agree with her point.
Harry was a bit sad to leave Rome on Sunday morning, but was also glad to see his kids again. He had sent them an owl with some of the pictures, also talked through the Floo, but it just wasn’t the same. Therefore, when he was bombarded by three bodies upon entering the Manor, he was beyond happy.
"I like to wrap my own gifts. And you're not getting the broom." Inside Harry cheered himself. Sometimes being assertive was a good thing.
"Oh I'm quite sure, my son." Arthur patted his hand reassuringly. "You have nothing to worry about."
Once they arrived to the Ministry, he hurried past the fountain memorial and upon seeing that all the lifts were in motion; he nervously pushed the button to go down. Ginny was saying something beside him, but he took no notice of her. He leapt into the lift and rolled his eyes as his wife took a more sedate pace to join him. Of course, things were made worse for him when the lift refused to take him straight to his destination and stopped along the way for other passengers. Finally, they reached the level of the Wizengamot and he stood in front of the great doors leading to the large chamber where they all sat.
Harry flushed and with all the dignity he could muster walked past the blond and into the great marble hall that he remembered. In spite of his memories, the interior of the building looked a lot brighter and more welcoming than on that day over fourteen years ago.
Harry turned around to see Draco Malfoy glaring at the small creatures, his hands on his hips. He snickered to himself that the gorgeous blond would be in the same predicament as he was. Gorgeous? Where did that come from?
"They will care that you married the poor little Weasley girl only to deceive her."
They both immersed themselves in their work. Harry became a published author after he sent his fantasy book to many publishers. Draco was soon an important part of the night scene as his band got very good reviews for combining classical and rock music, thanks to Draco’s talent.
"Why, what's so great about kissing the redhead?"
"Yes, ever since I entered Hogwarts, but more so once I learned about house-elves. I mean, you probably knew all along that they were the ones doing the cooking and cleaning, while I just thought that it was all done by some magic of the castle.
Afterwards, he was strapped into a seat that the girl levitated out of an adjoining room. She performed the spell and soon he was whizzing through the International Floo Network towards home. As he sprawled out the floor of the office in the UK and dry vomited, he was glad to be home. All he could think about was having a good cry on Draco's shoulder.
Once at the restaurant, Harry revealed the truth.
In the coming hour Harry shook more hands than ever before in his life. Arthur introduced him to everyone important, not just Wizengamot members, but Ministry officials as well. Harry had worked at the Ministry for some years, but he had never even seen half of these people. Granted, when at work he was either in the Auror Department, or out on the field, so he never got the chance to do much mingling. He was mostly of the opinion that the workplace was for work, not for socialising. However, it seemed like his prospective job was more about mingling than actual work. He tried to memorise the faces and names, but after a while it was all just a blur. He smiled at everyone, remarked on the brilliance of their costumes, kissed the hands of the ladies, and was generally trying to make a good impression. He did tire though and told Arthur that he would go and find Ginny, because she would be cross with him if he didn't take a turn with her on the dance-floor. He had gotten slightly better at dancing since the Yule Ball, at least enough to not embarrass himself. Arthur stayed with an old colleague and waved him away.
"Eileen Prince?" Harry caught the name. "But that was Severus Snape's mother!" he exclaimed.
'Harry, I...' His voice broke and his hand shook behind Harry's head.
"I know, it said so in the first book. The author wished to pay homage to the great war hero and Potions master, Severus Snape," Mr Blotts informed him.
“No.” She shook her head. “The things he has said to me since then, the way he’s acted, I could never go back to him. In fact, it makes me wonder why I had married him in the first place.”
Harry was amazed that the two older Malfoys would be looking after the children. They were not the typical grandparents. However, he knew that he could trust them, so he just nodded and off they all went, presumably towards the pool room.
After breakfast all the children got sorted out. Draco spoke to the tutor, and Harry got the other two to their respective schools. Upon returning, he was instructed to join Hermione and Draco in the office. He knew that it was time to tell her that she had been under the influence of a potion.
"Wonderful idea, Gin. It will be a costume event, therefore, be careful in choosing who you're going to dress as," he advised.
"Please?"
“Draco, merry Christmas!” Harry exclaimed.
"Well, we wait to let the public know. Behind closed doors, that's a different story." He got up, and slightly swinging his hips, approached Harry. He leaned back to appreciate the view, and Draco climbed into his lap, straddling him on both sides. Harry put his arms around him, and their lips soon met in a kiss. It became heated right away, and Draco started to move his hips against Harry's crotch. Harry broke his lips away to moan.
"Now can we call the solicitor?" Draco spoke up.
Harry looked into Draco's eyes. They were full of some soft emotion, and then it hit him. It was the same look he saw in the memory that Bill and Fleur shared. He was momentarily startled by the discovery. Draco loved him. Perhaps he knew it, perhaps not, but the emotion was there. He wasn't sure what to do with the information. He was afraid that the previous evening he had toyed with those emotions and hurt Draco. The blond has done so much for him. He was confused as to how to go on. He wanted to experiment further, but if it hurt the other man, he wouldn't forgive himself.
"When you developed emotions," he countered.
Ginny extracted herself from his arm and disappeared in the direction of the romance novels. The two men watched her go and Mr. Blotts returned behind his counter.
Harry sheepishly ducked his head.
"Yes, Master. Mistress instructed Dinky to put it into Master's fruit juice every morning. When Master didn't want to drink fruit juice anymore, I couldn't put it into anything. Mistress instructed it had to be taken with sugar. Master not eat sugar anymore," the nervous house-elf revealed.
They greeted each other and sat in silence for a few minutes, just gazing at the various wizards and witches milling about the room. Harry also took his time to observe the two other men at his table.
“Ron, you’ve never spoken like this before,” he pointed out.
"Goodbye, Mr. Potter," Scorpius called after him.
"No, he actually reads them."
"Though don't expect a lot," the blond explained. "Because of their distaste for the Vatican, and the restrictive Roman wizarding government, most Italian wizards just have a house there, and not actually live there. Their version of wizarding Rome is tiny."
"I see you're up already. Happy birthday, Harry!" he said, and placed the tray on the bed. He parted the curtains with a flick of his wand.
"Do you like anything besides a broom?"
"Why can't you remain purebloods?" Harry was genuinely puzzled.
The air started to change a bit around him. He could feel a sea breeze on his face and smell the water, hear the sound of gentle waves as the traffic lessened around him. Harry got excited at seeing the water and found himself hastening towards it with renewed energy. He finally reached the beach. It was full of people. They were on lounges and under umbrellas, in the water, parachuting over the water. It was a multitude of people and all around him he could hear people speaking in the dialects of British English. The white sand was emitting heat and the sea was azure. He itched to feel both between his toes, but he didn't want to get sandy and wet before he could change into his swimming trunks. He decided to ask one of the other tourists about the hotel, and after a bit of asking around, he finally managed to get reliable instructions from a woman who actually stayed at Banthai herself. She tried to chat him up afterwards, but he quickly mentioned his wife and left.
"Too much on your mind?" His tone was soft and open, prompting Harry to be frank with his friend.
"Then ... goodbye, Draco," he said with a smile.
A year before, he was alone, and now his wife was sitting next to him, watching the fire. Before, Ginny arrived to their home just in the very early hours of the morning, in time for the children to wake up. They had not spent so much time together since Lily was born, and instead of warming to her, he secretly wished she would feel an unquenchable desire for a remote island already. Though he had to admit, she was useful when visiting the Wizengamot members.
"Oh right."
"Napping."
Harry blushed at her words and invited them all in.
"Good afternoon, Narcissa and Lucius," Harry also chimed in.
Later that day, when Harry was in his room, alone in his bed, trying to fall asleep, he was thinking of Draco. He too had taken to calling him that since it seemed like they were going to establish a working relationship, perhaps even a friendship. When the man wasn't trying to ruin him, he was actually not so bad. He let himself wonder a bit about what it would have been like if he hadn't meet Ron on the train, but rather ran into Draco again. Could they have become friends? He could have been in Slytherin House. The difference between such a life and the one he had would have been enormous. Still, he let himself be swept away in the fantasy and it even reached his dreams. He saw himself with the Snitch in his grasp, in dark green Slytherin robes, and smiling towards a Chaser Draco who grinned back and gave him a playful wink.
"Yes."
* * *
“Ugh, I’m sorry if we were not supposed to use the piano,” Harry said, kind of embarrassed now by their very public display.
"Harry."
"I most certainly do. I also like what I see and sometimes feel." He poked a teasing tongue out a bit.
Harry just hoped that he had made the right kind of impressions during the course of the evening.
"Do you want to buy something or not?" he repeated and could not be dismissed.
"I'm sorry I was. It does explain a lot, though."
"Yeah, it was." Harry felt that there was something wrong with that memory though. As if he was missing something. He closed his eyes in an effort to delve deeper into his memories.
"Harry, you know that even my father got passed his prejudices. We learned to give credit where credit is due."
"Oy, Harry, you'll never believe what I heard happened after she left the pub!" Ron was turning that unflattering shade of red again. "She ran into Malfoy of all people! And that's not the end of it! Malfoy offered to help her! It's all a ploy, of course, he's only doing it to annoy me. It doesn't matter whatever that prat does. The law is on our side." He grinned and headed to the liquor cabinet.
He went into the house to try and find Draco, so he could say goodbye. He didn't want to be rude and not bid farewell to his host. However, after about ten minutes of looking for the blond he realised that Malfoy Manor was so immense that he could probably look for days for him and still not find him. He was just about ready to try to call a house-elf, when he noticed a small blond head poking out from behind a modestly ornate couch in a sitting room.
“I’m only asking because if they were not, then you could just reveal that fact and they would be yours. Of course, you can’t lie and say they are not, because a simple paternity spell would reveal it. Anyway, in this case, you will have to prove that he is an unfit father. That is the hardest thing to do. Perhaps he has beat or starved the children?” he tried.
"Good idea," Hermione said, perking up. It felt good to be doing something about her situation.
Harry was very glad when he could leave the plane at last.
"Ten dollars."
In the morning, he made himself forget about green silk sheets.
"I know. You are a smart witch, Hermione, in spite of having made the grievous error of marrying Weasley," he admitted. "Now we only have to decide how to go about it. First of all, Potter needs to have a spectacular, public falling out with you. Preferably shouting at the top of his lungs about how much he wants you to return to your husband," the blond man said, contemplating just how to set up the scene. "Then you move out and move into Malfoy Manor in a huff. We should be seen around Diagon Alley shopping and in the more posh Wizarding restaurants, to show people that I'm educating you and to generally introduce you to the upper regions of society. You, Hermione," he made sure that he had her full attention, "can tell all that will hear that Potter only took you in, in an attempt to convince you to return to the Weasel and once you refused him once and for all, he kicked you out. I will add to that by telling everyone how I heard about your plight and as the Weasleys are an old enemy, I decided to help you. Meanwhile, we also decided to show people that with proper education you can become a part of Wizarding culture," he finished, smiling even more at the wonderful plan he concocted.
"Human waiters," he remarked.
"Of course, Mr. Mildew." He let himself be led to another room to the side. It was much smaller than the ballroom and deserted. They sat down on an ornate sofa that reminded Harry of what Ginny had furnished their living room with. It was just as uncomfortable as well.
“That she wasn’t happy anymore and wanted to become a healer. Something which you didn’t support. She was also troubled by your attitude towards her desire not to have more kids,” Harry summed up.
"Harry, I think you'll need me to show you out." He grinned and got up from his couch.
"No, I just had a strange dream. Nightmare really."
Harry felt very proud that day and looking up to the audience, he could see Hermione's smiling face. They could finally go on with the divorce. However, this had not only been about her. This was for all the women in the Wizarding world. There must have been more who felt trapped in marriages they couldn't leave, because they had children and could not leave them behind. Arranged marriages like Draco's with far less generous contracts and far more loving mothers could be broken with the new laws. He felt that they had achieved something that would impact so many lives. They had done it together.
"I have allowed you to stay in my house long enough."
After one session of lips and tongues, when they lay side-by-side, Draco turned to him.
"You, Malfoy. I never would have thought that you would have the same problem as I did," Harry said, grinning at the other boy.

Harry contemplated it and just as he was about to say no, he noticed a colouring book on one of the dragon-shelves. He took it down and quickly paged through it.
"What are your plans for today?" Draco asked.
"I have an idea," Draco spoke up. "The potion that they must have used is an old recipe, mostly used by Light Families. You were both introduced to the potion at the Burrow. Therefore, someone there must have given the potion to you. My money would be on the older Weasleys."
"I love you too, Draco," he said and they made good use of the couch.
"Then we come back?" he asked.
* * *
"Cho Chang."
Arthur was sipping a glass of champagne as he greeted them. Harry tried to guess who he was dressed as, but had no idea. His father-in-law was wearing and old sort of robe in brown that was ragged, but on his breast he was clearly marked as the Chief Warlock. He knew this because the insignia was the same one as what they used these days.
Betad by Icicle.
"No. I like it here," he said, his ever-present little smile firmly on his face.
"Oh yes, I seem to recall the name myself. Though I can't see why." To Harry one Potions book was like the other. All dull and boring.
"Me - in the Wizengamot? I'm not good at politics. Wait, did you say seats? I have seats there?" He tried to recreate the astonishment on his face that was there the first time he learned of his stolen seats. He had wondered how Ginny was going to explain her father holding onto them without even consulting him. At the time though, he probably would not have wanted them anyway.
"But do the members like me enough?"
From the bed, a voice that sounded through the ringing in his ears like Draco, cursed aloud.
He decided that he had done enough snooping for the night and returned to the ballroom to finally have that dance with his wife. However, what he found there interrupted his plans. Ron, Hermione and Lucius were standing in the middle of the dance-floor. Ron was shouting and beet red. Hermione was clearly annoyed and Lucius had the air of dignified amusement. None were speaking, though Ron had probably already shouted. The other guests were just standing around, like spectators at a sporting event. Harry supposed that, in a way, it was a lot like it.
Hermione got up and poured some water for him from a pitcher on a side-table. She was frowning though, obviously wanting to say something on the matters that had been revealed to them.
"What?!" Ron was getting redder by the minute. "Malfoy reproduced! He has a son, Harry, another generation of that shit and we could have stopped it from happening! That boy is going to go to Hogwarts with our children! Bring them misery like their father did to us!"
The proceeded to have a pleasurable breakfast together, which included feeding each other fruits, and eventually lead to the tray being discarded onto the floor. Harry found it a lot better way to wake up than the previous year.
"Yesterday, I thought of how my life and also that of my children was going to change. The only relatives they have are among the Weasleys." He decided to talk about what concerned him the most and not the tingling on his wrist, or the feeling that their legs still touching gave him.
"But what can you do about it?"
He moved his right hand lower to find Draco's anus. He felt a bit weird about putting his finger in there, but he supposed soon enough another part of his anatomy would also be inside the man. As his fingertip encountered the opening, he circled it, partly to tease, partly to actually find the entrance, as he was keeping his eye on the beautiful face above him. Draco's eyes were closed, his head periodically turned from side to side, he moaned, keened, and sighed. Harry couldn't believe the variety of voices he was making. As he inserted a finger into its destination, he saw the blond jerk and let out an even louder moan. Harry almost forgot to pull out his finger, he was so transfixed by what the man was doing. Then he noticed that he needed to lubricate his finger, as it was dry down there. He should have realised that before, but it was just one of those things that was so different from a woman's body. So he put his middle finger into his mouth to spread his saliva over it, and put it back in. He returned to sucking the gorgeous cock before him, and timed his finger to synchronise with the movements of his mouth.
“Of course I’m sure!” Ron stood up and started pacing in front of the fireplace. “Of course you don’t know anything about dating, Harry, but a woman never leaves a man unless she already has someone lined up. The whore. If our kids didn’t have red hair, I would demand paternity tests on them.”
"Want me to take care of that?" the exhausted blond asked.
"It's not for forever, Harry, just 6 months. I think you haven't been the same either, since the war. The way you sit in front of me now, your shoulders slumped, your eyes almost dropping. Harry, you eat the same thing every day, and don't even deny it," Hermione explained, her voice full of concern for her friend.
"What is?"
"I'm looking for the Banthai Beach Resort  & Spa," Harry read out from a piece of paper that he fished out of his pocket.
"Hermione, I've been thinking," he began. "We should get you a solicitor, to help with the divorce and getting custody of Rose and Hugo."
"They positively love you! Recently, all I keep hearing about it what a great man you've grown up to be. I'm very proud of you for deciding to go into politics. It'll make a great career for you." He beamed at the man in front of him. "Molly and I are also glad that we no longer have to be afraid of you getting hurt by a villain. We just wish Ron would take interest in a safer position as well." He sighed at that.
"Harry, does this mean that now you have become a Dark Wizard?"
“And if it isn’t Hermione. You clean up well,” he remarked as he looked her over. Hermione couldn’t decide if it was a compliment or an insult, so she just ignored the remark.
“But the Weasleys are still poor. If they had seats in the Wizengamot, wouldn’t they have more money?” Harry reasoned, taken aback by Malfoy’s lack of control. Apparently, they were discussing one of his sore spots.
"It does sound like a good idea," Harry agreed. "Where would we go?"
Harry just wished that they could go to sleep already. After all, the children would wake them up early in the morning.
"No, Hermione, it's politics. People make such deals all the time. One supports the other in one bill, and then the other returns the favour. It's how things work," Malfoy explained matter-of-factly.
Harry was taken aback by the vehemence in Ron’s speech. He didn’t sound like the care-free, happy person he knew.
Harry and Draco soon reached the familiar office and both took a seat on the couches surrounding the coffee table, facing each other. Almost immediately, a house-elf appeared with the tea set and poured them both a cup, then popped out of the room. Harry wondered if there was a sort of warning system that alerted the little creatures to someone entering that particular room.
"Yes." That was all Harry could say to that.
Harry decided not to push for more details and just accepted what he was told. He closed his eyes once more.
"None of your business," she retorted.
"Oh, wonderful," Harry said. He was sure that wearing the actual clothes of the man was taking it a bit too far.
Harry got up. Ginny had got the papers then. They had timed it so that she got them after they returned from Rome.
"Of course. Do you have everything ready?"
"You were drunk."
"You're right." Harry blushed. Sometimes he still found it hard to remember that things had changed since school. "Sorry," he added.
Harry swallowed, and lay down on top of the blond to kiss him. He felt the other man's erection through the confines of his boxer shorts, and a flash of desire to touch it and lick it shot through him. He kissed along the long, elegant neck, nipping in places, but trying not to leave a mark. Draco appeared to be very sensitive there as he was keening already. He tasted like vanilla and strawberry, which was just perfect. Harry teased the flat nipples with his tongue, filing away for later that his partner liked that as well. He was in no rush, he wanted his first time exploring a male body to be thorough. As he mapped out every little scar on the beautiful torso, he took note of when the other's breath hitched, when it didn't. He also tried not to dwell on the slightly raised scars he knew were the remains of his Sectumsempra.
"You know very well what it means." Harry crossed his arms and glared at her.
"Your wife is not in her room at the moment," he was informed. "Did you call ahead?"
"Why do you have so many clothes?"
"I'm running away," he whispered, glancing around again, to make sure that no one heard.
It took a minute or two for Harry to digest everything. He had no idea why no one ever told him that he had two votes in the Wizengamot.
At one o'clock they were both standing before the fire in the living-room and the fire changed to green to signal that the Floo was being used. A second later Draco Malfoy regally stepped out, his pale blue robes flaring out behind him. He would have made Snape proud.
"No. I thought you were doing Pansy."
"Okay, but I'll need to rest my eyes a bit ‘til then."
"I’m telling him tonight. I'm just not happy, Harry. Ever since the war I feel like I've only been existing, just going along with things. I do everything the way Ron wants it done. We had kids when he wanted them. I stay at home like he wants me to. I can't go on like this. I have to separate myself from him. It's like I'm trapped. Don't get me wrong, I love my children. But I had such plans." She sighed, remembering those days. "I wanted to work in something where I could do a lot of research. Maybe in mediwizardry, or some other science. I wanted to travel, see the world. After the war it seemed like I lost all my passion. I just went along with what Ron said. I lost myself." She was babbling and she knew it, but it was like a dam breaking. Everything was just pouring out of her.
Harry chatted with Hermione for as long as he could, but he did have to pick up the kids from school. He noticed the sadness in her eyes as he got ready to leave and had to reassure her that soon enough they could meet more often again. He left her out there, gazing out into the park, her thoughts most likely lost in how her children would love to play in the piles of dry leaves that characterised this time of the year.
"All right."
"Oh, just wondering what we're going to do with this week. You were planning on having a vacation filled with exploring a naked body. So, I was thinking, why don't we have that vacation together?"
"What should I have told you? That Dean could make me come more in ten minutes than you could through all the years of our marriage? That you're a terrible lover? Well, I guess I told you now."
"Ron, it's none of your business anymore," he tried to placate his former best friend. "She left. You're getting a divorce. Go home and sleep off the alcohol." Harry could smell the cheap firewhisky from where he was sitting.
The taste of Firewhisky and something else, masculine and sweet. Silky locks in his hand. He found, to his alarm, that the memory was making him hard. That was probably the single most disturbing thing at that moment, even worse than the headache. It also drew his attention to the fact that he was only in his boxers. He tried to shake his head to clear the memory, but it only served to increase his headache. He made himself stop such a foolish action, and he attributed it to not being in his right mind. He had to find his clothes.
His phase two began an hour later, so he sat down to have an actual lunch. He did not enjoy it. He realised that he had not eaten so alone like that for a long time. He missed the kids. Ginny too, of course. She was his wife, of course he missed her. Once he finished, he went upstairs to continue reading his book. However, he stopped once he heard the Floo flare downstairs and the voice of his wife and of Ron could be heard calling for him.
Harry kissed the blond eagerly, feeling a previously unknown tingling go through his body. He really tried not to snog the life out of Draco in front of their house, in clear view of the neighbourhood. He didn’t know how tolerant they were.
Harry looked up to savour the sight of Draco's naked behind.
"I still don't understand why you feel this way so suddenly. You seemed happy and content before," Harry noted.
"I see your point." Hermione blushed at missing the obvious.
“Sorry to bother you then. I’ll go up.” She made her way up the stairs, dropping the subject.
* * *
Harry laughed, and let himself be dragged to a nearby restaurant. Draco pouted a bit at it being too cold to sit outside, but was assured that it wouldn't be their last trip to the ancient city.
"Best Dressed" list often. Not that he read the magazine, but Ginny sometimes pointed it out that he was never on it and that he should make more of an effort. She was always striving to get on their list for witches, but for some reason, never made it. She was even among the "Worst Dressed" a couple of times. Harry didn't know why, but then again, he knew nothing about fashion, which Draco obviously knew a lot about. For the most part, Draco lived a quiet life, much like his father, and didn't seem to be particularly vocal about his politics during social events. Harry assumed that is was because of his oppressed status in the Wizengamot. Perhaps it would change later on. If Draco was anything, it was politically savvy.
“I do know that,” Harry agreed, and undid the other man’s bowtie to use it to pull his lips onto his own. “I know that very well. And not just at piano.”
"At least I got three wonderful children out of it." Harry saw the bright side of the whole sordid affair.
"I'm glad that you and Ginny are spending more time together," Mr. Weasley began. "She had been travelling so much after Lily's birth, we were afraid that your marriage was in jeopardy."
The Gryffindor had told the others about Ron being eager to slow down the divorce process after hearing about Hermione's new beau. Draco was very smug that his plan had worked. He sat in the chair with a satisfied air about him and grinned at Harry over the rim of his teacup.
On his way there, he had to pass the interrogation rooms. Just as he was  passing one of the doors, he heard some shouting in spite of the silencing  charms and the door banged open just in front of him. Malfoy hurried out of  the room, or rather tried to, but bumped into Potter and knocked him over.
"No. I'm not that kind of a man. I like you, Draco. A lot. My attraction to you had been growing these past months, I just refused to acknowledge it. Now that I have, I want to be with you. I want to give this a shot."
They made quick work of pulling down the soiled bed sheet, and left it in a pile on the floor.
He forced himself to put away the albums and try to get some sleep. He slowly ascended the stairs up to his room and lay down in his great, lonely bed. He had been restless since the vote and hardly slept. The following day he would take the kids to Malfoy Manor for the first time. While they were supposed to play with Scorpius, the new Slythendor trio, as Draco called themselves the other day, would discuss the new family law they wanted to put through. Draco said that after they had a specific text they could bring in some influential people from among the Dark Families and present their ideas to them.
"How can I help you?" Harry asked.
"Great? Sure, he's pretty decent, but I wouldn't call him 'great'. You surely didn't fall in love with him now?" he suggested.
After he left the small box that was his trunk at the reception, he went out to the sea again. The first thing he did was to kick off his flip-flops and let his feet sink into the warm sand. However, that didn't prove to be such a good idea as it burned him a little, so he quickly put them back on. Next, he put his bag down on the ground and walked into the sea to let the waves envelope him. He even swam a few strokes. Grinning from ear to ear, he decided to start looking for Ginny. After all, it would have been even better to enjoy these delights with her. He first examined the hair of the people in the water near him. The good thing about marrying a redhead, he thought, was that she was easy to spot. However, he had to get out of the water as he couldn't see her there. Wet and shivering a little at the breeze, he took his bag and began to walk around the beach. He did see some redheads but none proved to be Ginny.
As the Muggle-born witch lead him out through the maze of corridors, he noted how comfortable she looked navigating the passages. They said their goodbyes and the green-eyed man felt comfortable in leaving her in the Manor in a way that he didn't previously.

never even mentioned them."
I am planning on writing the end before the new year.
"None of my business?!" Harry could feel his anger rising like never before. "I could see you through that curtain, Ginny! You were having sex with Merlin knows how many people! Sex! Is this what you have been coming for?!"
Harry shook the man's hand grinning, feeling relieved. In spite of all the assurances that he got, he still couldn't help but feel like he was not going to get them. How wrong he had been.
Draco just nodded, and picked up the most expensive camera on display.
* * *
"But Harry!" Ginny whined.
'With a much better reception too,' he thought as he looked upon Draco's smiling face and grinned back at him.
Teddy
"You didn't say anything about restrictions," Harry said, hoping he hadn't broken any laws.
Beater positions  after the twins had left. Harry hadn't even known that the boy had become an  Auror.
An hour later, Harry was strolling down Diagon Alley with his wife on his arm. He wasn't all that sure what he was going to buy. Just like with most things, he liked to pick gifts out on the spot, no plan, just improvise. He would look in the windows and think about his children, thinking of whether they would like something from there. However, his wife had other ideas. She enthusiastically dragged him to the first shop she saw, which happened to be Quality Quidditch Supplies. She led him straight to the latest racing broom design and just stared at it. Harry got bored quickly. He still appreciated the broom, but he wasn't as excited about Quidditch as he used to be. He still went to games with his children, though James was the only one who enjoyed them. Albus took a book to read and Lily something to colour and some papers to draw on. Harry had considered leaving the two younger ones at home, but he wanted it to be a family outing and hoped that they would catch on as well.
"You know I don't want to. I can't even begin to imagine what the children will think."
As Harry was waking up, he wasn't really aware of where he was, or what day it was. His mind still groggy with sleep, only registered that he was in a very comfortable bed, and he was hugging someone in his sleep. He opened his eyes, and he saw the top of a white blond head. His chin was buried in the soft strands, the body of his companion moulded against his front. As he moved slightly, his soft cock brushed against the backside of the person, and as he groaned, he heard an accompanying sound from the man in his arms.
They walked on, and Harry was glad for the rather warm weather. It felt more like autumn than winter. In the morning rush hour, the street was packed with cars. They never seemed to stop honking, and about once every five minutes an ambulance could be heard blaring it's sirenes somewhere. Harry thought it took away from the ambience. They finally reached a big junction, and some more ruins. Harry took pictures of those as well, even though they didn't look terribly interesting. They turned onto a really wide street with three lanes going in both directions. Tall trees stood on either side, and an arch was visible at the end.
"Why? Why did you want to be my friend so badly? Because I was famous?" He opened his eyes to stare straight into the blond's grey orbs.
“You would take that whore into your house?!” Ron was shouting at that point and Harry was afraid the kids would overhear. ‘Whore’ was not a word they commonly heard in the house. “Maybe you’re the one who’s shagging her! With Ginny travelling all the time, you must be lonely. I always knew she had the hots for you!” He was pointing at Harry, spit coming in large drops out of his mouth as he screamed at the man in front of him.
"Can't face it now though."
Harry woke up in a very dark room. It took his sight a while to get accustomed to the sliver of light coming from a gap in the curtains. He looked around, trying to make sense of the world through a pounding headache. His mouth tasted like something died in it. He was sure he was in a bedroom and based on what he could remember from the previous day, it was probably somewhere in Malfoy Manor. He tried to piece together the fragmented pieces of memory. He recalled arriving in distress over Ginny. Then the alcohol. The talk. Draco kissing him. Draco kissed him! He asked for it! Bloody hell!
"Harry?" he said, after a few choice words.
Still looking for likes to Zelda of Arel and Drarry Shippers on Facebook. Adults only!
"Maybe. It would mean paying Astoria off. I would have to love the man a lot," Draco said and his voice was more emotional than before. Harry supposed the blond never expected such a thing to happen, he was probably enjoying sleeping around too much.
"Potter, when did you develop a brain?" he joked.
"Yes." She seemed to brace herself for what she was about to say. "I wanted you to know first. I'm divorcing Ron."
"You find wife?"
"I never thought less of him because of that," Harry revealed. "I know he was with Grindelwald in his youth. They parted ways over ideology, but I saw a picture of them and I know they had been happy at one point. Gods, it must have been hard to fight someone you once loved," he wondered aloud, but Ginny just scoffed at him.
"Morning, Draco." He grinned to himself, as the memories from the previous night returned.
"Certainly, Mrs. Potter. We'll send that along with the dragon and the book."
"I miss them too," she agreed.
As they sat there, Harry could feel their connection. These were the eyes that he had looked into so many times, looking for a plot, a ploy, his own demise. He knew the man before him so well, but then again, so little. The Draco he had come to learn about in the past months was not the boy from school. He wondered if that boy ever truly existed, or his own prejudices encouraged by Ron, had clouded his vision. Then again, they had both changed. They grew up, became fathers. The world changed too. Harry smiled at Draco and the other man let go of his wrist. The touch was immediately missed. Yes, their relationship was not only about scheming. He had come to see his friend.
"Good morning, Mr. Potter," greeted the boy in a cordial manner.
"Stop! Dry first," Hermione instructed and all three of them did as they were told.
"Good morning, Harry. Are you just going to gawk at my house all day long, or do you actually intend to come in?" He smirked at the man before him.
"I have to go home, Hermione. I'd love to chat, but I don't want to be too long in case Ginny starts to wonder." Harry was sad to go, but it was time.
Harry blushed at the realisation that it was indeed so. Once it stopped sprouting, they both eagerly spooned the delicacy into their mouths. The base of the mound popped in Harry's mouth like popping candy. He thought the whole thing very clever and it was even delicious. Ginny kept giggling.
"Such as?" The blond man gritted his teeth in frustration at their continued ignorance.
"No, Father."
For half the night, he wondered about. He had never been in such a place like Patong. Skimpily-dressed men, women, and some people he was startled to find were somewhere in between, propositioned him at almost every corner, or called him into a club. He did go into some of the clubs, looking for Ginny, but she wasn't in any of them. It was past midnight when Harry was beginning to get really tired. The gaiety around him annoyed him more than cheered him up. He was getting frustrated, but went into just one more club.
“It’s going to be all right, Hermione. We’ll figure it out,” he tried to calm her down a bit. “Go upstairs and make yourself comfortable. Lie down a bit.”
Harry nodded his agreement to that statement.
The children were located in Scorpius' rooms, as he had a whole suite for himself. Harry had never been inside and when he entered the playroom, he thought that it was exactly the kind of room he had dreamt about in his cupboard under the stairs. All sorts of toys were located on shelves around the room from toy brooms to building blocks. Among them were also so many books; it was a miniature library. The room had a swing in the middle, on which Lily was swaying back and forth, carefully pushed by Narcissa. The woman had a smile of delight on her face. James was on a trampoline. He was trying to jump as high as he could go, but safety charms prevented him from reaching great heights and also from falling off of it. Scorpius and Albus were thick as thieves on a rug, Nocer Picard books around them, clearly in an argument over something in one of them. Hermione was also with them, and she was pointing out a passage, trying to explain to the others something. Lucius sat in a rocking chair at the back, his full attention on James.
"Big day."
wife," Harry pointed out.
“Oh, by the way, I’m going to tell Scorpius that I’m getting divorced as well. It probably won’t come as a surprise to him though,” Draco revealed.
Harry's people watching was interrupted by an elderly wizard. He had been previously introduced as Bartholomew Mildew, a Light Wizard member of the Wizengamot.
First, they needed to get an actual violin. They went into town to find something. Draco of course found the most beautiful, and expensive instrument at a music shop. Harry felt his heart break that they couldn’t get it, but they had to settle for a second-hand one. Still, it played reasonably well, and Harry hoped that Draco would be talented enough to warrant a better violin in the future. He had never heard him actually play.
"Yes, down that corridor." She pointed.
"All right, I'll admit probably no one would like that," Harry admitted, but then realised what Malfoy said first." Wait, you're gay? Since when?"
Narcissa changed a lot less, although she had never been a prominent figure. However, she seemed a lot warmer and kinder, especially whenever they came across each other. She would sometimes take his hand and squeeze it in greeting, as if she was still thanking him every time for all the things he had done for them. Harry had actually grown to like the woman from afar and hoped to forge a closer relationship in the future, after he could publicly ally himself with the family.
Everyone nodded enthusiastically and he was shown the swimwear closet. Harry changed and was soon in the water, his worries forgotten for the time being.
Malfoy visibly shuddered at what Harry told him.
As he contemplated the question, he realised that at the edge of his hearing there was a noise. Then a loud clatter of dishes and swearing.
Harry tried to get a look. He could have seen the person clearly if it wasn't for the waitress standing in his way. As she moved, he was astonished to recognise the man. He didn't know his name, but it was the same man that had propositioned Draco during the party.
“What does the Wizengamot have to do with anything?” Harry asked, clueless as always.
"Yes. A toy Snitch for James."
"Sorry, not gay."
Harry had heard enough and felt pity towards Draco for having such a woman for a wife. Then he remembered that according to him, they hardly ever interacted.
When they entered the house, Draco saw the interior for the first time.
"Time difference. Right. I forgot."
"Kiss me," Harry repeated, emboldened by the alcohol.
"It does him good to be with other children," Harry answered.
"Why aren't you asleep?" Harry asked, fishing for something to say that wasn't about his wife.
Harry was touched by the blond’s words, and managed to blink away the tears threatening to spill.
“Hermione, Malfoy, this is not leading us to anything.” Harry tried to take up the role of referee. “Malfoy, can you think of another way that Hermione could get her children? Maybe a solicitor would be of help.”
Harry stepped out the door and found himself on a busy wide street. Cars and bicycles of all shapes and sizes were hurrying about. All around there were restaurants, massage parlours, and small hotels trying to attract tourists with colourful signs. He tried to remember what the man had said. He went down one street to his right, then turned left and started walking on that street. He was glad that there was a sidewalk as the cars zooming past him were going fast and honking a lot. It did hurt his ears as such sounds rarely reached the wizarding world. He was quickly tiring, the walk making him hotter than it actually was, and he was sweating a lot. He cursed himself for not thinking to pack a bottle of water. He had been walking for some time when it occurred to him that perhaps he had gone the wrong way, or the hotel wasn't as near as he thought. He saw a small food-stand on a corner and tried to get directions, but the man just wanted to sell him the food. His stomach still churned at the thought of eating and he hurried off, a little bit green. He kept on walking, hoping to spot the building as he had seen it on a picture Ginny had taken on her previous trip. Still, no luck.
“I may have learned it,” he said, his face turning red. From the corner of his eye he could see Malfoy shaking his head in disbelief. “So could we change the Wizengamot’s mind?”
"He was doing it to me! But how? He was pants at Potions."
"I don't know, Draco. The only real relationship I've ever been in was with Ginny, and apparently, for the most part, that wasn't real either. Not to mention, you're a man!"
"That's all right."
"That
"Harry, I couldn't sleep! That Bitch! With Malfoy of all blokes! She's probably shagging both of them!" He sprang up to pace around; he could never stay sit while ranting.
"Sure, it's going to be amusing! We can pay him back for all the shit he  gave us in school," Jimmy said, joining his partner.
The crowd dispersed then, they no longer had any source of entertainment. Ron was left standing there alone, ignored by everyone.
"This ... this ... woman is dancing, in public, with this Death Eater!" he screamed with rage.
"It made you feel different?"
“I was a fool, Harry. I just assumed that divorce law was the same in the
He was just about to leave a dark room, which was only illuminated by the rather bright moonlight, when he passed a slightly open connecting door. From the next room he heard voices and not able to help his curious nature, peaked inside. There he could see Astoria Malfoy sitting in all her splendour, surrounded by other ladies and holding court. She was obviously dressed as a fairy as her magical brightly coloured wings fluttered behind her.
Once they finally emerged from their room, fully clothed, they were greeted by their children in the garden. Hermione and her children were scheduled to make an appearance at around lunch time. The three of them had moved out a few months after the divorce, to the place where they lived before, and Ron had moved out. Once the red-head calmed down, he became a bit more reasonable. He still ignored Harry and Draco being a couple, but the public didn't.
However, he didn't think it likely that Albus would want one.
It was late in the evening when the guests left. Harry and Draco had a good time and were happy to have made friends so fast, but they were exhausted. They both went to their bedroom.
"Why? I thought you have everything at home," Harry brought his voice down as well.
Harry chewed his food, contemplating the proposal.
The time it took her to reach the Manor and then the room, allowed him to gather his thoughts. He did want the children, but he wasn’t very keen on the house, and if some money could ease the process, he wasn’t against that either. He just wanted the divorce to go quickly, and without much publicity.
"Yes, yes. I've heard that she had been away a lot these past few years and that is probably why you haven't had a child these past years."
As always, I want to thank my wonderful betas. I first want to thank Icicle, who stuck with me. I know I've been bad with updates, but she's much better at them. Then I also want to thank my new beta, the brilliant Faye. She is a constant source of inspiration and encouragement on Facebook. Go like the Drarry Shippers page too, which is admined in part by her. It's a great place to discuss Drarry fanfics.

"Tonight?"
Harry just shook his head and let it slide.
"Alright." He looked disappointed.
"But...that is not possible! Especially not since Lily's birth. She was hardly home."
"Oh. I ... wow, after Severus. Did you know that he was my godfather?"
"Yes, it was," Harry grudgingly agreed. "So, who are you dressed as?" He directed the question to the man before him.
The following day after breakfast Harry, Draco and Hermione went into one of the smaller drawing rooms, and she was told about their relationship. She was very happy for them, and confirmed their suspicion that she had seen the signs the day before. Afterwards, she retreated to the library to leave the men alone until the children arrive. They wasted no time in returning to what was quickly becoming their rooms.
"Now?"
"Yes, that's a good idea. It would seem odd with my parents, my wife and my son around. We are all Malfoys, after all," he agreed.
Harry's fingers shook a little as he opened the letter.
"Yes, I can see how this can be a problem. Maybe, educating you could help me work out the details on how to integrate Muggle-borns." Malfoy grinned. Harry realised at that point that intellectually Malfoy and Hermione were very similar. They were bound to have a good time together. "Oh, just one thing. Don't traumatise my house-elves by trying to free them, Hermione. You just have no idea what freedom actually means to house-elves. They would be out on the streets and subjected to general distrust by wizards. They have spent their whole lives in the Manor. Since the war, we have been treating them well. They helped the family a lot while the Death Eaters were living in my home and have been rewarded by getting their status as part of the family acknowledged. I'm sure if you ask them now, they'll tell you how happy they are," he revealed.
"Harry, you have to see this," she urged.
"Draco, I know you do. I also know that it's hard for you to get by in this strange world, but you're learning. I'm sure that soon you'll get the hang of it," Harry soothed the feelings of his boyfriend.
"Great, Malfoy. Very Slytherin and such plans are just what we need right now. No one would suspect the two of us actually working together," he admitted, forcing himself to concentrate on the conversation.
* * *
"Ginny, if you're not going to buy anything, we need to go."
However, his routine was broken by an owl that he received. It was from Hermione Weasley, who requested a lunch date from him. Since he didn't have any plans, he replied that he accepted her offer.
"I don't know. It was like I had forgotten. We got married a month later."
They started out with the small church across the street. It was pretty, but didn't hold much interest to Harry. Because of the renovation it seemed to lack character. Afterwards, Draco pulled him down the street, until they got to a big wide open field with a few ruins on it.
"What is it, Scorpius?" Draco asked.
"Still, playing in the pool is not without dangers," Harry warned. He was quite stunned by the proposal as he had not known there was a pool. He supposed in such a big home it would be matter-of-fact.
“It was arranged when she was only a few months old. We both knew that and had such expectations of each other. She has her wing in the manor and I have mine. That’s how these things work in our world,” he informed her.
"Right this way," the goblin led him to one of the carts and soon they were speeding through the tunnels.
"Who's Albus?" Draco asked as they walked down a corridor. Harry noted that most of the portraits were sleeping. He was glad as the blond residents of the house generally hadn't liked him in the past and he assumed that it only changed for the younger generations.
"Now it's your turn."
"Harry, I will be eternally grateful for you," Draco said, looking into the green eyes of his lover. "Without you I could have never survived in the Muggle World. They would have probably found me after a few hours and last night would have been the worst night of my life spent in the bed of the Dark Lord. Instead, last night was the best night of my life. I have also dreamed of being with you, Harry. You are the most amazing lover I could ever hope to have. I toast to you, Harry, and the wonderful life we'll have together."
"You have a house-elf, right?"
Harry grinned, and Draco took his hand. He was pulled towards a narrow yellow and pink building with four floors. The facade was decorated by beautiful reliefs around the windows and in between them. It looked like a small ancient palace to Harry.
"Not all people want to breed a herd of little Weasleys." Draco stepped to the counter as he spotted the book lying there. "Nocer Picard? Isn't that rather above your intellect?" he asked Harry.
"What ages is that for?" he asked, eyeing the apparently too-small garment.
"So you think that Malfoy would have a different attitude towards my divorce because he's a Dark Wizard?"
There was a glint in his eye that Harry didn’t like. It was like looking at a person he didn’t know. He thought of trying to convince the man of how wrong it all was, but then he realised that he didn’t know much of the
"Harry..."
"Having fun, Arthur?" he asked.
"They are all great. Ron brings them over sometimes, but I'm not very comfortable about having him over. You're still his favourite subject and it's hard for me to listen to him talking about you that way." He remembered back to their most recent conversation.
“So that is why you’re divorcing Mum?” He stood up, and glared at his father.
Draco appeared! Finally! I know, slow progress. Though we can't expect Harry  to wake up one day and just say "oh, I'm gay", now can we?
"I know."
"He'll love that!" she exclaimed. "You forgot to have it gift wrapped. Anyway, I know what I want for Christmas. That new broom. It's great!"
"Yeah."
First, he looked around for Ron. He would not be pleased and would probably make a scene. He was glad when he didn't find him. Ron was probably still stuffing his face.
If anyone is missing Teddy, then I'll let you in on a bit of an embarrassing secret. I totally forgot about him. I was reading another Drarry fic the other day, that was when I realised I forgot Teddy Lupin. Don't worry, I thought of a way to put him in. Chapter 16 will be good for that.
"Harry, about last night...," Draco began.
"I've wanted one of these for a while," he remarked, and headed towards the accessories section. In the end they left with a lot of gadgets, as they needed a computer and a couple of other things as well. Harry had no idea how to work a computer, as he was never let near Dudley's, and after he left Hogwarts he never needed one. Draco was confident, that they would figure it out, and if not, they would just find someone to teach them.
Harry could only think about three things. One was that he was finally through it and how relieved that made him feel. Two, his wife was leaving the country and he could go back to it just being him and the kids. Three, Draco was still gently clutching his arm and that made him feel warm and safe, two things it shouldn't have.
. You should read that after this chapter.
* * *
He couldn’t understand Ron’s attitude. Yes, he had always been quick-tempered and fast to fly off the handle, but underneath it all he had the rational mind of a chess player. When had he become the irrational, judgemental person that had just left? Harry tried to think the sudden personality change through, but as he was about to wrap his mind around it, he felt a strange calm come over him. His heart slowed down and his mind, which had been in turmoil settled to an ease. In a moment, all his worries were gone. His heart remained a bit heavy though and even the pleasant feelings he was experiencing could not chase away the sense that Ron was no longer his friend.
"You were right." Harry felt like an idiot. All this time, he had been drugged.
"Happy birthday, Harry!" she said as she let him go, grinning up at him.
“I was scared. You’re so smart and so beautiful, you were going to become someone important, and soon you would realise I wasn’t good enough for you,” Ron admitted. “Mum said that I wouldn’t be able to hold onto you if I let you live on your own. She was probably right.”
Leonardo da Vinci Airport didn't look very big. They didn't need to pick up any luggage, as everything was in their shoulder bags, shrunk and protected. Harry hated to think about waiting for his suitcase to arrive, only to find that it ended up in Kenya, or some other far-away place.
"What?! I don't feel nauseous," he protested, giving up sugar and flour just sounded awful. "I don't want to diet!"
They arrived to a lavishly decorated Floo entrance chamber and quickly moved on to leave room for the other arrivals.
"Oh, Harry, actually, this is my desk now. Since I'm Ron's new partner, you  need to switch places with me. My old desk is over there, in the corner."  Jimmy pointed towards the desk in the darkest recess of the room. "I already  moved my stuff. Here, take the box I transported them in, I don't need it  anymore," he offered.
"Really? I never heard of them." Harry was baffled.
"Okay." Draco got up a bit reluctantly, and with some difficulty, they both headed to the bedroom.
"I know."
"Their children wanted you. Probably promised grandchildren. The Potter fortune must have come in handy too."
"Ginny wasn't so good at it either."
"So, my boyfriend is now a professional musician. Do you move like this on stage too?" Harry asked.
Almost half a year had passed and Harry was happy. He was doing a job he loved, living with the man he loved and there were no dark wizards breathing down his neck. Summer turned to autumn and the morning of September 1st passed without any trips to London. Strangely enough, no owls even found them. The Wizarding World seemed to be all right, as the Muggle news didn’t report on any strange happenings.
"That is quite enough, Ron. You'd better go home," Ginny injected and quickly helped her intoxicated brother into the Floo. It was a good thing the kids stayed with their grandmother that night.
Harry grinned at the words and Draco returned his grin.
She quickly placed the necklace back and caressed it, her hand passing over the similarly shaped earrings as well.
"How could you?" she finally spoke up and slapped her husband across the cheek. "That's my family and you just separated us from them! I always knew you were useless when it came to politics, but this is your stupidest idea so far! All you would have had to do was to vote like my father and go along with everything and we would have had a great place in society! I'm not staying in this country anymore I'm going back to Thailand!" With those words, she turned on her heel and marched off towards the lifts. Harry and Draco just watched her as she disappeared inside one.
“Yes.” Harry could only admit it.
"Yes! You've been an Auror. You went to and fro, waving your wand about and taking down criminals. I'm not saying that's easy work, but not exactly taxing on the mind. Also, I am aware that you defeated Voldemort, but that didn't take a lot of brains either."
"That's right. It figures that you would name one of your kids after the old man," he said and the ambivalent feelings towards the great wizard could be heard in his voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You see, sir, Hermione, Ron's wife, wants to divorce him. He threw her out  of the house because of it and I took her in. She's my friend too and has no  one, so I can't stand by and watch her struggle on her own. I want to help  her."
He really needed to find Ginny.
"It's so boring, Dad. All the other children are so behind. Then they tease me for being smart, and the teacher bugs me for not paying attention. I don't like any of it." He hung his head.
“I don’t care. She can go and whore herself on Knockturn Alley for all I care.” The redhead shrugged. “Though she’ll probably shack up with whoever she’s sleeping around with. Oi, and Harry, don’t you dare take her in!” he demanded.
"Luv, Dumbledore was gay."
He hadn't heard the bathroom door open. Draco went to sit down next to him, and took his hands in his to force the other man to look at him.
"I can't now, but some time later. Can you show me where your father is? I need to go home, but first I want to say goodbye."
"This is the famous Circus Maximus." Draco had decided to play the tour guide. "They used to hold the carriage competitions here."
"Oh, it's sort of common knowledge. There had been some studies on it centuries ago, but no one bothers with it anymore. You probably want to read up on it now. I'll point you to the relevant volumes in the library."
Harry laughed a little at the sight of that expression. That was when Hermione entered the room, greeted Harry and sat down opposite him in Draco's old place.
New Year’s had barely passed, and Valentine’s Day was quickly approaching. Harry knew that in the Wizarding World they didn’t really celebrate it. The only time they had it at Hogwarts was when Lockhart insisted on it. However, they were living in the Muggle world, and Harry wanted to have a fun evening. So he made sure with the agent of Draco’s band that they had a clear schedule that night. It was easy enough as the band usually played upbeat songs.
Happy Holidays everyone! Good news is that there are only a few more chapters to go. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I rewrote the ending. When I started the story I wrote out a detailed summary of what is going to happen. However, as I wrote this chapter, I realised a few things about the kind of man my Harry was. Maybe he doesn't seem all that cannon sometimes, but we do have to take into account that it's 15 years after the War, and he's the father of three children. Above all, he's a good father, and when I rewrote the ending, I was thinking like he would.
“Sure. If a wife divorces her husband, she is not entitled to anything. For Light Wizards the most important thing is the unity of the family and it must be upheld at any cost.” Ron sounded like he was reading from a book, the Muggle-raised wizard realised. Perhaps there was a book.
Betad by Hazel and Icicle.
“Malfoy.” Harry nodded, not taking his eyes off the man.
The other man left, laughing at those words.
"Pretty smooth sailing."
"Scorpius, I hope you're not boring Mr. Potter," the blond man said to his son as he came to stop next to him. Harry was again struck by how much they looked alike.
"It may be, but my six-year-old adores him."
Harry couldn’t understand why Ron was acting the way he was. He didn’t seem like the person that Harry knew. Instead, he was horrified at what he was hearing and didn’t know how to respond. This wasn’t his friend.
"We'll see, Hermione. I'm sure he won't ask for anything he knows we are not prepared to give."
Draco did take some time, just breathing. Harry recognised the technique as what men would use to get rid of their arousal. To his surprise and confusion, he had to do it as well because he was in a similar predicament. He couldn't understand why it happened. He reasoned that what Adrian said was so blatantly sexual, anyone would be aroused by it. He seemed to be faster at deflating than Draco, therefore, he silently crept away next to the bushes. As he looked back to take a final look at Malfoy, he could have sworn that the other man was looking right at him. Yet, he couldn't have seen him in the darkness, away from a lamp.
Soon after Harry's divorce the news hit the papers, along with a photo of the two of them together in a restaurant. Harry was relieved to see that they were accepted, and heralded as the new force in wizarding politics. It went a bit too smoothly perhaps, but the
* * *
"Follow up?" Harry asked back. He wasn't sure about how he was supposed to do that.
"Diet?" he frowned. What would eating have to do with anything?
"Of course not! He turned out to be a good friend that's all. We do spend a lot of time together talking, debating, but it's an intellectual friendship. He is great though. He's a really talented politician with very good ideas on how to make Our World a better place and not just for purebloods. He's a wonderful father to his son. He makes sure he studies well, but also plays with him a lot. However, he does punish rule breaking while still remaining a loving dad. He is nice to his wife, even though it's obvious that they are nothing more than friends. If he does have affairs, then even I don't notice and you know how observant I am. To me, he is a gracious and attentive host. With such qualities, he fulfils the requirements of a 'great man' in my book," she finished and looked at Harry with a challenge in her eyes.
"Okay. I'll let you know ahead. If at some point you don't have a finger in my arse, you're doing it wrong." The blond smirked and lay back, spreading his legs to make room for Harry.
He skipped down the stairs to the kitchen, where he startled his house-elf with his loud morning greeting. Hermione was already sitting at the table and smiled at his antics. She had dark circles around her eyes and the fact that she was not trying to take over Dinky's work was a testament to her exhaustion. Their special white flour-free, sugar-free sandwiches were placed before them, along with tea and sweeteners. As Harry was munching on his breakfast, he was glad that Dinky could bake the special bread; it was so delicious warm, and fresh. They also ate a small salad on the side which contained a few slices of crisp green apple.
He approached the group and he was allowed to go near them. Finally, he stood beside his brother-in-law and had the opportunity to put a hand on his shoulder.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. Politics was not his forte, but he knew where he could get help. Therefore, he brought forth his friendliest grin and directed it towards the man in front of him.
"Oh, Harry! I can't wait 'til the kids are old enough to get brooms," she enthused and Harry nodded in agreement.
"It's so calm and peaceful here. You know Ron and the Weasleys. Always loud, shouting, screaming, and making noise. It gets a bit much after a while and I never had a place to escape from it all. I miss my children, but for the first time in a long while I can just sit and read. Draco teaches me a lot about the Wizarding world and the etiquette, so does Narcissa and sometimes even Astoria joins in. Narcissa is such a lovely woman. Sometimes she reminds me of my own mother," she sighed; she could never get over not being able to reverse her own Obliviate.
"It's not like I'm faithful."
He wrote a quick missive to Arthur and then saw the kids off to their respective schools. As he was heading home, he received a reply from his father-in-law that they could meet that evening. He was glad that he had a bit of time until then as he found a secluded spot behind a tree in the remote area where the boys' school was and put on his invisibility cloak. Taking care to not lose it he Apparated.
"Finally, this is Scorpius Malfoy. He is looking forward to playing with you all," he said finally, as he reached the end of the line.
Albus blushed, but nodded.
"I can assure you, that it was not the case. Ginny just wanted to see the world as she couldn't before and since my job kept me here, I volunteered to take care of the children while she was away."
"That I can see," the blond was seething. He moved from Malfoy Manor to a shack.
"Thanks for having the children over."
"Talk to me. It can't be just the Weasleys that's keeping you up at night."
Draco turned his head around and gave him a soft kiss.
Harry moaned, and closing his eyes, let him enjoy the moment. It didn't take much, and his cum joined the pool that was gathering between them from their activities.
"Oh, yes, the inbreeding!" Hermione injected, before Malfoy sniped at Harry again.
"Fine. Help me?"
marriage." Draco evaded the answer.
Everyone had a good time chatting, enjoying the food and drinks. Harry and Draco bid them goodnight after ringing in the New Year. They started it as they intended to go on, between the sheets.
“Potter, I know the laws as well as any solicitor. I’ve been studying them since I could read. The law was written to prevent women who are divorcing their husbands from getting their children. The little lenience it gives is only there to prevent a bastard from inheriting or a child from being harmed. Magical children are highly valued and there are many laws in place to prevent abuse. But if the Weasel does not abuse his children in any way, shape, or form, then he can keep them,” Malfoy explained to the frustrated duo before him.
"Potter, are you still here?" the blond man asked.
They both grinned.
"Well, at least you tried, mate." Ron put a supporting hand on his shoulder with such force that Harry had to keep himself from wincing.
"Oh, I just wanted to see what you were made of, young man, without Mr. Weasley. You want to enter politics and that is a big step. I know you are a very reliable man." He fixed his gaze on Harry. "However, politics is a lot more complicated than the wand-waving you've been doing."
"Harry, you liked it. Fine. It was just a kiss."
Harry could feel his heart racing, his palms getting slick with nervous sweat. When Draco sat down next to him, he swallowed and put his glasses down. Draco placed his right hand behind his head, and gently pushed their lips together. The soft pink pillows that were the blond's lips moved gently over Harry's, and then they opened to let his tongue out to play. Harry also parted his lips and when their tongues met, neither could resist a moan. Harry's right hand found its way into blond hair in an effort to keep their lips locked as the kiss became more passionate. Their tongues moved more rapidly and Harry moaned again as he felt himself getting impossibly aroused. Just as his left hand tried to find an opening under Draco's robes and shirt to touch the pale skin underneath, Draco broke the kiss.
Draco choked on his drink as he was just taking a sip at that moment.
"That's so fascinating, Harry. I can't believe I never looked this up!" She was clearly miffed about Harry being more knowledgeable than her on a subject.
"Yes, well, the lighter trousers make you look taller and leaner. The blue complements your hair well. You should wear more colours, Harry."
She nodded, reluctantly. She did not like taking his money, but there was no other way.
He collapsed onto his previous spot next to his lover, and panted for what must have been several minutes. His body felt exhausted, his muscles straining, but the euphoria from his orgasm was still there. He only looked at Draco once he had calmed down somewhat, to see the other man already recovered, and looking at him grinning.
Harry shook his head at the blunt letter. Malfoy had apparently not changed one bit, but he needed him and the prat knew it. He glanced at his watch and noted that it was only 11am, but he knew how long women needed to get ready, so he went to rouse Hermione all the same. She wasn't hard to wake up, so once her eyes focused on him, he showed her the letter. Her eyes widened and she rushed to the bathroom after grabbing her beaded old beaded purse. Harry could hear clothes falling onto the floor.
"No buts," he said, trying to be more determined with his wife just as he promised the night before. "Now, how about some lunch? I know the kids are away with your mum, but we should still eat."
"Oh. Could you change this to a bigger size?" she asked, turning to one of the shopkeepers.
"Thank you, Draco."
"I have put away a couple of things for your young prodigy. I know how much he loves potions. We have a new book by Nocer Picard. I remember your son saying how much he enjoyed his last book." He pulled out a rather large volume.
"What is it?"
Harry blushed a bit as what he was going to say wasn't so important as to warrant a visit, but he had no one else to visit on his free day. Besides, he found that he enjoyed Draco's company.
They made it to the bed and Draco was quickly taking charge of the situation. Harry was glad for it, because at least one of them knew what to do. Or at least, he assumed he did, since they haven’t actually discussed it. The green-eyed teen was an eager participant in everything that the blond wanted. As Draco slowly divested the other teen of his clothes, he was very glad that he had picked the eve of July 31st to run away.
"I'm sure." Draco grinned, and kissed his boyfriend deeply.
It was the end of November and on that day, they were scheduled to go Christmas shopping. The previous years they had not gone together. His wife was always at some remote location and only arrived home for Christmas Eve, laden with foreign gifts, so Harry bought his own. He was determined that the kids would not get any less though.
"You wanted to have lunch with me for a reason," Harry started after he gave up waiting for her to do so.
"Harry..."
The dark-haired man thought about it for all of two seconds, until he stuck his hand out. Malfoy eyed it warily, but then took the offered limb all the same. Once they shook on it, they knew that nothing would ever be the same. Now that Harry knew what it was really like to be a Light Wizard, he had no doubt that he would rather be a Dark Wizard.
"Harry, this is a dump!" Draco complained upon seeing the house they managed to rent.
"How do you stand the presence of a Muggle yourself, Astoria?" asked another, equally high voice.
Now, time to thank my lovely beta. Faye did this chapter alone. She was very sweet about it, and didn't make a lot of corrections. She always encourages me when I have my bouts of self-doubt.
"Me too. Let's shower together, Harry. Meanwhile, the house-elves can change the sheets."
"Much."
He had to catch some sleep, it was already 2am.
Harry groaned.
Ginny was waiting for him in the sitting room and jumped up when she spotted him.
In Gringotts, Harry couldn't do anything, but get the 50 Galleons he was allowed and exchange it for Muggle money. It was probably why Dumbledore had put the cap on his withdrawals in the first place. He was about to walk out the large doors of the bank, when from behind him he heard a familiar voice screaming at the goblins.
“Where is she now then? She’s always away travelling and you don’t seem to mind.”
Adrian looked down Draco's body and smiled at what he saw.
"Now that we have a general plan of action, we have to work out the details of the first step." Malfoy sat back with a serious look on his face. "What Wizarding venue should we select for your big row?"
Harry showed him the ads and Draco admitted that he could see some promising positions right away. True, they didn’t pay much, in some cases only on a gig-by-gig basis, but it was a start. The black-haired teen sat down on the couch next to his love and found his lap full in a second.
“No, that’s different. But I’m glad that you like Draco.”
He walked to the bar, trying to find Ginny. A skinny Thai boy slinked next to him. His slim but muscular body gleamed gold from all the glitter. He wasn't wearing much, just some shorts and a smile. He leaned against the bar and got Harry's attention.
He was followed by Albus, who found his chair with only a glance away from his book. Harry let out a sigh at the title
"Then get a house-elf to get some lunch! I'm hungry!" Harry said, chuckling.
He waited for his wife in the sitting room near the Floo. They had already had breakfast, or at least everyone else did and he just munched on plain toast and drank a bit of tea. He wished everything was over already. He just couldn't think about what was going to happen after the Vote anymore. When Ginny finally arrived in one of her more expensive robes, he leapt out of his seat and tossed powder into the fire before she could say a word.
"Can't it wait ‘til tea?" He tried to stall as he was really not in the mood to try to deal with more problems.
"What was that, Potter?" Malfoy spat.
"No." Harry reeled back at the idea. To him, sex was never casual. He just couldn't view it like that. "However, there was a very persistent boy that I met. I kept telling him that I wasn't gay, but he insisted that I was." Harry frowned.
"No."
"I overheard him talking with Draco during the party," he revealed. "They seemed very ...
"That's only because it's old. I got it when I was playing for the Harpies. Harry, I promise I won't take the kids up." She was trying to be persuasive but failing.
"Then what do you want to do?"
Maybe they were found and Death Eaters were currently beating him up in the middle of the living room? Or the Order found them and quickly tore the Boy-Who-Lived from the arms of a presumed enemy? No, Draco would have woken up for either occasion.
After the song ended, the manager of the restaurant approached them.
"So, Harry, when can we catch our guy?" he asked, eagerly anticipating the chance to fight.
"Nice to meet you. I'm a friend of your father's. He said that you were studying."
"I've been such a fool. All along, I thought my wife loved me. So she wanted to see the world. Sure! Why not!" He laughed mockingly at himself. "When all along she was going away to hop into the bed of other men. Maybe women too. I found her in the middle of an orgy in some club, so I'm not sure." He looked up at Draco, noting that the man wasn't surprised.
"Like that?"
Hermione noticed his expression and smirked.
Harry stopped, and taking his pale god's hand, he pulled him down on the bed. Soon all clothes were off Harry as well, and they both got a bit dirty. Draco complained a little about his skin drying out if they took so many baths a day, but he still joined Harry in getting clean. By the time they got a taxi to Trastevere, it was very dark and they were very hungry.
A few weeks later, Harry had just arrived home from work, when he was suddenly assaulted by his blond love on the front lawn.
"Okay, but this is the last one." Draco complied. He didn't want Harry to pour anyway. He was afraid he'd break the crystal.
"Oh, okay."
"It's not going to be easy to start all over again."
"Yeah, he would have," Draco smiled, and Harry was relieved.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry stared at his lover dumbfounded.
“You know what that was, Hermione. He was up to something and I wanted to find out what.”
"The Nile, the Danube, the Ganges and the Río de la Plata. They are the major rivers on four continents that they knew about at the time. Each side of the fountain represents one of them."
He looked up, having realised that his mind had wondered far away. The others were staring at him and he desperately tried to think of something else to talk about. He wasn't comfortable about discussing his marriage with them. Hermione's marriage had failed and Draco's was never really supposed to work.
"You want honesty? I want that too. What was last night to you? Just an experiment?" Draco's smile vanished, and the steel of his eyes bore into Harry.
Harry was glad to hear it, though. That meant that they had time. As long as the divorce wasn't finalised, the children could still go to Hermione at the end of it all. In the Wizarding world rulings were rarely overturned and it was rare that someone even attempted it. Harry was sure that enough time had passed to move onto the next phase of the plan and he couldn't wait for it. Of course, the past weeks were rather pleasant most of the time, but once he started to move forward with his life again, he was loath to go back to being idle.
The two men looked up at the sound and Harry recognised the man occupying  his seat. He was Jimmy Peaks, who had taken over one of the
He also heard a lot about Hermione. Ron would often visit in the evenings, sometimes with his kids. It was nice to see all five little heads playing together, even when the occasional fight took place. Still, Harry was not happy that Ron never seemed to remember that the kids were around and he would often use language that was inappropriate. Therefore, Harry took to taking everyone upstairs first and cast a good one-way silencing charm on the playroom.
"Well, it's quite simple. Now we are all allies in reinstating the Dark Families as the leaders of the Wizengamot. You have your agenda, and I have mine, but we all want the same thing eventually. Since Potter can't be seen helping you, it has to be me. No one would believe that the three of us are working on this together. Also, it would help me promote the integration of Muggle-borns into Wizarding society. I could even make an example of you by teaching you how to be a proper witch, not just a magic-user," Malfoy finished, grinning by the end at all the benefits the situation would bring to him.
Harry knew that he was just playing with him at that point. He laughed and got up with the intent of finding the bathroom. Draco also got up and pulled the nearest curtains apart. Light flooded the room and Harry could see that they were in an enormous bedroom. He walked up to the first door and found a walk-in closet behind it. It was filled with robes and shoes. Draco's bedroom then.
Harry had to still himself in order not to fall. He patted her head, encouraging her to let go. He was glad for her reaction. Girls usually favoured their mother, but Ginny really hadn’t taken a lot of care of Lily.
Their food was as beautiful as advertised. Harry decided to make a toast, since he had discovered that he was actually really good at making toasts.
"Yes. Lucius Septimius Severus Augustus, to be exact. Kind of funny. But he was really known as just Severus. He was a really strong emperor. He fought many wars and won. He even tried to go against Scotland, but he died in what is now York. Naturally, Father wasn't named after him, but I do seem to recall Severus mentioning something like his mother named him after an emperor thinking that it would give him strength in his struggles."
“The same as Aunt Hermione,” he tried to explain.
"It's a Muggle holiday. We have Yule."
"Want to come to my sitting room?" Draco invited.
Before he knew it, they were standing in front of the house. In their bedroom they could finally do as they wanted, and fell into bed together.
Now, time to thank my lovely beta. Faye, you’re always such a big help. I’d lack some serious amount of commas and capital letters without her. Also, for the life of me I can’t learn that it’s Floo, not Flo.
As they waited for their main course, Harry looked around the place. Ginny was chattering about some restaurant she had been to during her travels, but he wasn't paying much attention to her. His eyes wondered to the very centre of the establishment, where a table was situated in the most prominent position. He assumed it was for people who actually wanted to be seen at the Alchemist. When he recognised who was actually sitting there, he stared for a moment, then blinked, then realised that he actually stepped in the middle of a scheme. For there she was, Hermione dressed in a most strikingly elegant dress, her hair tumbling down her shoulders in carefully sculptured waves, and as she laughed and flipped her hair, a diamond twinkled in her ear.
"Oh, Draco! Good morning," Harry greeted the other teen and bounded over to give him a quick peck on the lips. "I made breakfast."
Throughout the week, Harry found himself returning to the Piazza many times, and the ambiance of it quickly made it his favourite as well. It helped that the loud cars couldn't enter with all their honking. The city seemed to be filled by Bernini's works, which Draco never failed to point out. The men in his sculptures were really very life-like, but also mostly of the strong muscular type, which Harry realised didn't really appeal to him all that much. The one that he did find beautiful, was in the Galleria Borghese. The title of the work was
Second, Harry searched for Narcissa and there she was, sitting on a chair and chatting with some friends. She didn't seem bothered at all by what her husband was doing. Ironically, she was another Chocolate Frog card character, Morgana. She had a very elegant crown on her head, indicating that she was the Queen of Avalon.
"All right, I'm sure you all have enough to write your articles with. We only have an hour for lunch and I'm sure Harry is starving, so please be on your way," Draco instructed them, apparently appointing himself as Harry's media liaison.
Read and review guys! Love reviews. Who doesn't?
"Your skin tastes so good. I bet you taste better down south," Draco said with a wicked grin.
* * *
"Faster," Draco breathed out.
"What am I going to do, Harry, I have nothing to wear!" she shouted from the bathroom.
"You don't have to. Let's just leave the past behind us. We both wronged each other and then helped each other. I think it has all evened out in the end. Now, we will work together and make sure that our children will never have to know what it's like to live in a war."
6am saw Harry out of his bed already. He had tossed and turned through most of the night. The changes to his life were weighing heavily on him and he suspected he couldn't go on too much longer like that. He tried to read, but his mind couldn't be occupied by the struggle of Katniss. The book was supposed to be a big hit in the Muggle world, but he just couldn't pay attention to it.
"That's because you hardly use any magic as it is. There are rules like no Apparition, no Legilimency, no appearance altering magics.  Also, Rome is so ancient, the site has natural magic dampeners. Though some say it may be a curse. Anyway, spells seem to falter or just not work in most areas of the city.  House-elves are forbidden, but they refuse to stay long anyway. They are hurt by the dampeners."
"Hermione told me that you know about Adrian and me." He didn't beat about the bush that was for sure.
"Good day, Mr. Potter!" he said in a jovial tone and it took all of Harry's willpower not to gape at the man. He had never heard two pleasant words from him.
After that, they moved onto the woman Harry hadn't seen much of during his visits. He supposed he should have sought her out as she had been the woman to save his life.
The dark-haired man followed and soon found himself in a great library. As far as the eye could see, there were books standing on gleaming walnut shelves. To the right, he saw some winding stairs leading up to what he assumed to be the second floor. In the middle, was the study area with a few matching desks and further back, there were some very soft looking leather sofas. On one of the sofas, the man he had been seeking was lounging. A mug of something steaming was in his right hand and an open book resided in his left hand. He looked very relaxed as his trouser-clad legs were lying on the sofa exposed by the open robe he was wearing. Harry doubted that he had ever seen Malfoy look so incredibly at ease. He approached him, his footsteps were swallowed up by the thick carpeting.
"This is Draco Malfoy. We were in the same year at Hogwarts. For the longest time, I thought we would always be enemies, but now here we are." Harry smiled at that and the blond smiled back. He also greeted them as his father had.
“Ron, she’s my friend. The same as you are. If she asks for my help, I’ll give it to her,” Harry said. He was not going to take Ron’s side in the situation as he was now certain that Hermione had good reasons for divorcing her husband. That night he learned of a side of his friend that probably only she had seen and he did not like it.
"Hard is clearly the right word," he remarked and leaned in towards the blond.
Once they had a plan and Harry was full with tea and sandwiches, he stood to find his children. The house-elf they called informed them that Hermione was with the children in the indoor pool. Harry was led there and when he stepped in, the architect of Malfoy Manor didn't disappoint once more.
Draco's head popped into view above him, and Harry was glad that he could only see the faint outline in the darkness and without his glasses.
Harry tried not to cringe and just smiled back.
Once the tree was done, they turned on the lights and marvelled at what they had done together. They sang a little Christmas song and then opened a few presents. Draco hadn’t completely forgotten the holiday and had some packages for Harry as well. Though he was the happiest with a beautiful red rose he got from Harry. After that Harry playfully pulled out a mistletoe, and Draco laughed at how corny it was.
They went back to Gringotts to exchange Draco’s money, and then left the Wizarding World together.
"I’ve never heard of this," noted Hermione.
Once he was vertical again, he extended a hand towards his welcoming committee and introduced himself. The man took his hand and gave his name as Suchart Samarn.
"About last night..." Harry began.
The engines blared, and the plane suddenly seemed to put on full speed. Harry was pushed against his seat. Unable to swallow, he couldn't force his rapidly beating heart still. Then he felt the plane leave the ground, and his stomach seemed to be pulled back down by gravity. His ears clogged. Harry couldn't understand why anyone would put their body through the sensations voluntarily. He also briefly wondered, if besides flying on a broom, there was a mode of transport that he actually liked, and he came up with nothing. They were still rising, and he tore his gaze away from the fact that everything before them was higher up on the plane. He looked outside.
The neighbouring women watched from behind their curtains in glee.
"Is that
"I know. I'll never forget the time when I found you crying in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. I ... I'm sorry about that curse. I actually didn't know what it did. It was stupid of me to use it, but that's the first thing that came to my mind and you were going to cast the Cruciatus Curse on me," he explained.
"Yes, but it has more details and actual science in it. The stories are in fact detective stories where his main character, Eileen Prince, a brilliant private detective uses innovative methods in Potions to solve cases."
"Ah, people come to have sex. She come to have sex but not with you. You come have sex with me."
"What changed?" Harry asked. He didn't remember Hermione ever talking to him about apprenticeships.
He just held his friend, knowing that she had to have a good cry about it,  then she would square her shoulders and be ready to fight. He knew that it  would probably be easier for her to just give up and return to Ron, but she  didn't even mention it. From that he knew that everything would be all  right. If she was not happy with her husband, no one should force her to  remain with him. She would eventually win, she always did.
"Old enough. Besides, you were making moon eyes at Diggory's girl. What was her name?"
Always looking for likes to Zelda of Arel and Drarry Shippers on Facebook. Adults only!
"It's a mushroom in your intestines," she said that word like any other, but Harry had to force himself not to be put off of his food. "So, it's there normally, but sometimes it spreads and you have too much of it. So then you need to kill it. They gave me some pills and prescribed this really strict diet. I had to give up sugar of all kinds and flour of all kinds. Plus mushrooms, but I don't like that much anyway. Oh, and no sweet fruits or juices."
"Yes, I'm sure nothing bad will happen," Lucius joined his wife. "We'll all have a great time."
“Malfoy, honestly, this is the first time I've heard about this. I know that the Light Families have been in power for a while, but I didn’t know how that came about,” Harry pleaded. He wanted to hear everything.
“I know.” Ron grinned wickedly. “That is why I’m keeping them. If she loves them so much, she will submit to me, like a wife should. Look at my mother. She gave my father seven children and only once we were all grown up did she venture out on her own. Of course, even now she takes care of the house same as ever.”
"It's what I began to tell you, Draco. I really liked it. I ..." He blushed at what he was about to say. "I want to try it again."
"I realised that too. Did you talk to your solicitor?"
"Well, we first read the manual of the camera. Then there's this great quarter in Rome called Trastevere. We can have a nice dinner there. I'm assuming your stomach will need a bit of rest after the flying."
"You're right. I guess we only have to get to know each other better to realise the other one isn't so bad after all." Draco smiled and started walking down the corridor again. "I'm glad we're clearing things up between us now. We need to stand as a united front in the future and we can't let old grudges get in the way. We are fathers now and that changes things."
"No problem." Draco smirked. "We can make a whole album if you want." He started to pose, and Harry took a few more shots of him.
"You think?" Harry managed to get out.
"True, but it's dangerous and I would hate to leave you all behind. I was wondering if there was perhaps a way that I could help the Wizarding world without endangering my life."
"But sir," Harry tried to interrupt.
Ron signed it. It was a bit of a let-down, that after so many hours with the solicitors, the changing of laws, and all the effort they have put in so that the courts would decide in their favour, it all ended in a dingy little interrogation room.
Thus ended Harry and Draco's first day of being a couple and living in the Muggle World. Harry had never had a better birthday, and as Draco entered him for the first time, he was infinitely glad that the blond decided to run away on July 31st.
"I want to try more. I'm sure, Draco. It's like I've found what I've been missing," he confessed.
"I still don't understand what this whole thing has to do with you divorcing Ron." Harry was starting to get annoyed with how she drew out her story.
The food was wonderful as well. A light winter salad from greenhouse vegetables for starters. Draco revealed that they actually had several greenhouses further out on their land for producing food all around the year. The Manor was almost completely self-sustaining with gardens and livestock. The wine they were drinking was from the Malfoy wineries, but those were in Bordeaux, France. They were even sold under the label ‘Malfoy Apothecaries' as red wine had very good healing properties.
"That's okay, we have swimming costumes in all sizes for guests. For girls too," Scorpius revealed, much to the delight of the threesome standing before him.
"Adrian, you have a one track mind," Draco said with a little laugh.
"Oh, why not?" Harry was puzzled by this. Who didn't celebrate Christmas?
“Hermione told me over lunch today,” he admitted.
"Oh, don't worry about them. They are fully supporting me in my legislative endeavours. Even Father admitted, while we were in school, how smart you are. You would not believe the grief I got over you beating me for top student every year." He shook his head at the memory.
"We will stand together, Harry. Frankly, I can't wait to see their eyes when you take your place next to me in the Wizengamot. I'll save you a seat." He smirked.
Ron’s face betrayed his surprise, but he tried to quickly hide it. He was no Slytherin though.
When the arms of the chair opened, he fell forwards, his head still swimming from the combination of the trip and temperature change. He sprawled out on a light-green tiled floor and lost all of his remaining breakfast. At that moment, he sincerely wished he hadn't eaten those eggs. Just as he was done, someone Vanished his puddle with an amused chuckle. He looked up from his position on the floor to find a short, middle-aged, and dark-skinned Thai wizard standing near him with a big grin. Harry frowned and slowly gathered himself up. He supposed it was a regular occurrence that guests arrived in such a state.
Harry took the papers, and walked over to the desk in the room that he had never used before. He turned to the last page. It occurred to him to read the whole thing, but he trusted Draco. He trusted him with a lot of things. He took a quill, and signed at the bottom, marking the end of a chapter in his life. He stared at it for a while, put the quill down, and looked up at his future with a grin. Draco quickly stood, and rushed over to Harry, kissing him with all his passion.
“So wives are discouraged from going against the head of the family by laws, which could be put in place because Light Wizards have dominated the
"Right." The head was gone for a second, but quickly returned and had the outline of a potion bottle next to it. "You'll have a hard time drinking the hangover relief in that position though."
know?" She looked at him puzzled.
Harry was also having fun. He used the groceries he got to whip up a quick meal of meatballs. He got lots of compliments on the food, and the surprise was clearly evident on Draco’s face. Harry was proud that he could please the blond. Over dinner, he talked to Katrina, who reminded him a lot of Ginny with her red hair and demeanour. They were quickly becoming friends.
Harry's musing was interrupted by the Floo activating and Ginny stepped out with her father and brother. Harry hoped that he could talk to Arthur alone and later, but apparently it was not to be so. He plastered a smile on his face that he thought looked genuine and stood to greet the newcomers. Once everyone was seated in the living room Dinky brought tea for all of them.
Harry scratched his head. This was the second time in twenty-four hours that  he had heard the term 'Light Wizard'. Before, he had thought that it  referred to wizards who only did good magic, but both Ron and Malfoy had  spoken as if it was something else. He made a mental note to pick up some  books on that as well on his way home. He was obviously missing something  and he had learned in the past that not having enough information could cost  him. He tried not to flinch at the pang he felt in his heart as he saw  Sirius fall through the veil in his mind's eye.
They stood kissing for some time, just enjoying each other. Draco took first turn in the bathroom, since he took longer anyway. While he was there, Harry tried to figure the camera out. He was getting nowhere with it, until one of the maids looked in on him. She was more familiar with the gadget, and could show him how to use it much more easily than the manual did. She promised to also help with the computer the following day. Draco was surprised when he entered in the nude, and Harry snapped a picture of him.
I suppose you must be very busy now, being a big politician and everything, since you haven't written to me. Or maybe you're afraid of what I think? I get The Prophet
"Harry, look at me," Draco softly whispered.
"You like me that way."
"I didn't love her," Harry broke the silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, I may be just a simple woman, so I need to be enlightened by a smart man like you!"
"Hello, Harry," Ron said as he sat down at his desk next to him. Thirty minutes late, as usual.
"Morning, Harry."
"What will your parents think?" she wondered out loud.
Harry was excited that Draco was planning family vacations together as well. Perhaps it was a bit fast-paced, but once he opened himself up to the blond, he just wanted to be with him every moment of the day. As if it was what he had been waiting for all this time, and the feeling appeared to be returned. He locked eyes with the man before him, and all he saw was happiness.
"I'm learning. These past months I have had the opportunity to see the world through
Harry still felt uncomfortable, but he knew that the blond was right. He took a deep breath, and captured the other man's hand in his, and they walked on like that.
He looked down at Draco. His hair was a tangled mess, his skin was a rosy hue all over, and his breathing was still uneven. Still, he wore a happy and satisfied smile. When his eyes opened, he grinned wider at Harry, and held his arms out for him. Harry laid on top of him, kissing sloppily.
"Mr. Potter, how can I be of service?" the pretty young witch asked him.
"You still called me 'Mudblood' in your letter, Malfoy."
He was almost done when the Floo flared to life and she stepped out in dark blue robes that were embroidered with a white leaf pattern along the edges. Harry assumed the cut must have been in style, because he had seen the more well-dressed witches wear similar robes on Diagon Alley, but he didn't really know what was different about it. Clothes would always be just clothes for him. Hermone was beaming in them though and that was what really mattered. Apparently the shopping had done her good emotionally. She sat down at the table in front of him after her chipper greeting and once the elf served her meal, she began to eat. It was obvious that she was taking care not to get something on her new robes, she was eating so slowly.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione cried, obviously distressed about his lack of knowledge. “The Wizengamot makes the laws. Seriously, didn’t you learn it as a part of the Auror training?”
A witch was yawning behind a desk as far away from the fire as the small room allowed.
"All right, Malfoy. I promise. Or perhaps I should start calling you Draco now?" she inquired.
"What happened when you brought it up again?"
Harry was startled at her remark. He would have expected her to say something along the lines of how the house-elves could take a break.
"What are you doing on the floor?"
"We both have children, Hermione. If this gets out, how will they react? On the one hand the press will tear everything apart. On the other hand, maybe they'll think we never wanted them..." Harry was surprised by what he said, but as soon as it came out, he realised that it's what was underneath the surface of his thoughts.
"Dinky, please, gather my things and the children's, then bring everything here. You can also stay here with the other house-elves. I won't be returning to the house," Harry instructed quietly and the elf popped away.
"Draco, what about Hermione and your parents?"
Harry nodded. He allowed his eyes to close since Draco playing with his hair felt really good.
"Are we going to call the solicitor now?" Hermione began.
After breakfast he sent the boys up to get dressed and taking the four-year-old Lily himself, got her ready for the day as well. Once everyone was ready, he used the Floo in the living-room to take James and Albus to the magical primary school that their grandmother, Molly Weasley ran and then dropped Lily off at the day-care. In no time at all, he was sitting behind his desk in the Ministry, looking at his Auror files. Just like every day.
"I think it's a great idea, Harry!" Ron patted his shoulder as he sat down on his right. "You're just not tough enough to be an Auror. I know you can take down the bad guys and all, but sometimes you're just too nice." He erupted into a roaring laughter at that.
"I just...don't know."
For some reason, in spite of not having been with his wife for months, Harry rather wished she hadn't made the effort.
For what seemed like hours, the grey orbs stared into green, as if searching for something.
Harry blushed at the memory and only nodded.
"Let's hope so. She suspects nothing then?"
Wizarding world for centuries. So once Herm declares her intention to divorce me, I am no longer responsible for her. She will not be entitled to anything that is mine. Not my house, money, or my children.”
"Sorry, Jimmy, but you are sitting at my desk," he grunted out, not in the  mood to be civil at all.
"Yeah, well, what you don't know is that he intends to put a body slave tattoo on me and then use my little white arse for his own pleasure," he cringed at the thought in disgust.
She really did sound worried. "What if he asks for something devious or illegal?"
Harry was not ready to try to sort himself out from his awkward position half on the floor and half on the stupidly high bed, so he just stayed quiet.
His three children came down soon after, but they did not make the racket that you would expect in a house full of children with Weasley blood. Instead, their feet made soft sounds on the carpeted stairs. James was still in his pyjamas, hair sticking up all over, obviously having just rolled out of bed. He was not a morning person and usually groaned at everything and everyone until he changed and was off to school.
Harry just nodded and cast about for something to say. Hermione laughed again, though rather loudly and the redhead glared daggers in her direction. Harry was saved from further conversation by the arrival of their main course. It was a large piece of salmon under a glass dome sitting on top of something that looked like rice. The colours were strange again, as the fish was magenta and what was under it was bright lemon. As they took the domes off, the air around them filled with the scent of saffron. As he took a bite out of the food before him, Harry was transported to a warm and cosy place. The garnish turned out to be some sort of pastry, but had a nutty flavour. As they put down their forks, finished with the meal, both seemed to be in a better mood.
Harry's jaw dropped, and he stared in alarm.
"We know why." Harry felt it was his place to tell her about what had really happened. "You were being dosed with a potion."
When they did finally reach the entrance, they had to stand in a line. It didn't look very long, and was actually going rather fast. Harry stepped out to take some more pictures. He was enjoying photography a lot. At least from behind the camera he wasn't the subject.
"Ah, yes, I ..."
Draco was a master conversationalist. He managed to steer away from the topics that were too Muggle for him, and the women were soon promising to come over for tea at any time.
“Everyone, I’m getting divorced,” he announced.
In a matter of minutes, they reached the Manor and Harry grudgingly dismounted. He was surprised to find that he rather liked riding and considered that it may be something he would get into in the future.
As she was walking them to a table, Harry observed the room. It was a rather quiet place with an intimate atmosphere. The area was dominated by the colours green and purple. Harry actually liked it and he was curious about the food. On the tables he saw there was nothing that he recognised as edible. People seemed to be spooning bubbling electric blue soups into their mouths and carving up vibrant yellow twigs with crimson spots inside. He just hoped they tasted good.
,' was Harry's first thought, and then he told his mind to shut up and just feel.
"He and my dad were great friends. Although it must have been weird for them, since Severus was a spy and all." Draco explained as he walked on. "Somehow, I think my father knew. He hinted a couple of times when Voldemort returned that I could go to Severus if something happened. I was such a fool that I didn't." His voice was so full of regret that Harry felt sorry for him.
"I did, before the war. I was deeply disappointed in him when he left us in the tent though. Sure, he came back, but I was still bitter about it. I actually didn't want to get together with him after that. But then the war ended, I moved in with the Weasleys and it just seemed so natural..." her voice carried off. "Harry, I think you may have the same problem!"
"Draco, kiss me more," Harry pleaded.
Apparently, this was another problem. Harry realised that he was being tested and probably not just the man before him was asking the questions, but the whole fraction as well. He felt the butterflies take off in his stomach, but forced them on the ground again to be able to concentrate on giving the best answer possible. He couldn't think properly if he let his nerves take over.
"Why?" Hermione narrowed her eyes at him.
"I'm finished with my studies, Dad. I wondered if we could go flying." He was rather shy about his inquiry, probably due to seeing that his father had guests.
"Yes, a complacency potion. It made you want to go along with what you're told. It was in the fruit juice, same as with me," Harry revealed.
The witch just smiled at him and took another sip from her flute. Harry drained his and exchanged the empty glass for a full one.
"Rest, Harry. You have dark circles under your eyes. Not sleeping well?" he inquired.
Harry's face fell a bit.
"How do you celebrate Yule?"
"I suppose, you are young. I do recommend keeping her on a tighter leash in the future though. Give her another child and then she'll have to stay home. You do want to emulate Mr. Weasley in that, don't you?"
When he arrived, instead of taking up his customary position beside Hermione, he sat down next to Draco.
“Hello, Potter, long time no see,” Malfoy greeted, smirking at the two.
"Please, don't make me throw up, Potter. You’re seriously trying to put disgusting images into my head tonight. Besides, why would my sexuality interest you?" he looked at him puzzled.
"Autograph?"
"Don't I know it." Harry smirked, remembering his guide.
"You know what I mean. Two days ago I didn't even know I liked men. Now I want nothing but to tear your clothes off."
"She has children too. Do you have children?"
"A mother who hardly even looked at them. A mother who would only take them away from you to hurt you. Harry, please, for their sake, don't protect her," he pleaded.
At that remark, Draco turned his face a bit towards his companion and grinned, his pearly white teeth showing.
"When can we do it again?"
"We have talked about this over breakfast. I'd just like to have a nice, peaceful lunch now," she said and then took a sip of her water, pretending to hide her nerves behind the glass.
Harry frowned at them, but shook his head. He was probably just seeing things.
Harry kept looking out. The plane was still above water. He could see the rays of the sun glisten on the waves below. He hoped they wouldn't end up as shark food. Then they were above the beach, and houses. Still no airport in sight. He was starting to get worried. At almost what seemed as the last minute, a runway appeared under them, and they touched down flawlessly, with just a slight bump. The plane slowed down rapidly, nearly coming to a full halt. Another sigh. At least Draco's hand remained untouched this time.
"It's huge!"
know?" He was curious, and the alcohol gave him the courage to ask.
"Oh, that Muggle holiday from our second year!"
"If you're sure, then yes."
"Yes, Mr Potter. This way." He turned with a grin at the promised play date and started to walk away in a measured pace.
"You're right," Hermione acceded.
“So you expect nothing and get nothing. Doesn’t sound like a happy marriage,” Hermione pointed out.
"Thank you, Harry," Draco said, kissing the other teen, the red couch forgotten. Soon, they both lost themselves in the kiss.
'Hmmm. Draco... who ... took off my clothes?' he asked, blushing.
"Why not?"
“What does that mean?”
“Oh? Is that so?” He seemed puzzled. “In school everyone knew you two would get married. Though I didn’t understand it myself. A smart witch like you marrying a big stupid oaf like him … such pairings never work.”
Ron was already there in his Auror robes as he just popped down from work. They had been scheduled to arrive just at the time when the vote was taking place. The chamber was closed for the event, but Harry wouldn't have seen much anyway, since they cast their votes on such occasions on secret ballots. He was desperately trying not to pace. Then, the doors were opening, and people were walking out presumably to have a break, and there was Arthur, smiling. He stood before Harry, patted his back and said, "Congratulations, Harry. You are now officially a member of the Wizengamot and the holder of two votes."
"Harry," Draco began and ran a hand through Harry's thick hair. "I know that the loss of the Weasleys is hard on you. However, now you have me and you will always have me. I suspect we'll have our differences, but I will never abandon you. Remember, on the train, when I asked you to be my friend?"
Thank you my lovely Faye, for everything. Also, thank you Icicle, for working through all my comma mistakes. I confess, I'm terrible at commas. Then again, I'm terrible at them in my native language, so why should it be any different in my second language? I should progress with my Japanese. No commas.
"Thought what?"
She beamed at him but was trying to sneak a peak over Harry's shoulder, as if asking where her gift was. Harry took his wand and Summoned the package from the attic. It was also rather small but bigger than hers had been. She opened the obvious jewellery box with barely contained glee and gasped when she saw the content.
The discussion took up the whole morning and afterwards they all had lunch together in a great dining room. The atmosphere was relaxed and the children talked excitedly about all the fun they had. The plan for the afternoon was a small nap for the children in Scorpius' room, while the adults would also retire for a bit. Harry was glad to see that Albus and Scorpius were becoming great friends. James was sometimes a bit miffed as the two other boys would rather talk potions and their favourite author, Nocer Picard. Lucius noticed this and started a conversation about the history of Quidditch with the older boy. Harry was also fascinated by some of the stories about the world of Quidditch in the past 50 years that the eldest Malfoy could tell.
"Thank you!" Hermione's eyes lit up at the thought of research.
"It's far, mister. My room is near." The boy suggested.
"Tea?"
The other man stepped next to him and allowed Harry to see both of them.
"You loved him," Harry stated, remembering the way she cried over him dating Lavender their sixth year.
"But Hermione, you wanted what Ron did when you got married," Harry pointed out. "He said you guys would have a big family and you agreed."
"Alright, Harry. Like before, if you don't like it, then you can still push me away." Draco broke him out of his thoughts, got up from the sofa opposite Harry, and walked over, just like the night before.
"Harry, back so soon?" Narcissa inquired.
Harry sighed. He really didn't want to fight. He was tired of it. He just wanted to be happy. He took up her place next to the fireplace, gazing into the flames deep in thought.
"I know that. I wasn’t going to whip out my violin either. Mind you, what I want to take out is long and lean," Draco chuckled at his own bad pun, as things boiled between them.
"Ginny, I don't like you calling Hermione a 'whore'," he began. "However, it  would do the kids some good to be with you for a while. So I will let you  take them until this thing between Hermione and Ron is over."
"I suppose electricity doesn't work at Malfoy Manor either," he wondered out loud.
“If you’re going to use such crude language, Potter, we’d better get out of here.” he grabbed the arm of the younger man, and dragged him to a nearby alley. Incidentally the same one Harry had apparated into when he arrived.
"No, I meant it as a surprise."
There is a one-shot companion piece to this fic,
A few days later Harry found himself in Malfoy Manor once more. Hermione, Draco, and him were sitting in Draco's study. Harry looked around, observing the many pictures of Scorpius. He had pictures of his children all over the house as well, along with Ginny. Though the more recent pictures were just of the kids.
On Christmas morning the tree arrived too, and Harry got it into their bedroom. He woke up Draco, who was surprised by the new decoration.
"It was a great idea, no?" Ginny grinned next to Harry and was clearly very proud of herself.
"No, I'm fine." Harry shook his head.
Harry cringed at remembering that Lucius was in Azkaban at the time.
"My name is Harry Potter. What's yours?" he asked, crouching down to the child's level and stuck out a hand for him to take.
"Ginny, Hermione is staying."
"No, get away from me!" he screamed.
"That's from an ancient temple. There are many around the city, often made a part of monuments like this."
She shared his blush a little and watched as the two took their places in front of her. They both picked up a cup and sipped, though Harry had a bit of a tough time handling the delicate china.
"Well, I'd say we were rather done here." He looked at the others in the room to see if they had any objections and when neither was forthcoming, he knew it was all right. "Go and change, get your broom, I'll be along shortly."
Wizarding world still, even though he had been living in it for so long. He had had no idea that there were such laws. Perhaps he should read something other than novels once in a while.
Harry let go, and his palm ached from holding on too tightly. Draco flexed his even whiter than usual fingers, and they rapidly filled with blood again. Harry winced.
Walking down the narrow streets in the quaint quarter, they had a hard time choosing a restaurant. The menus were put out, but in some of the places only in Italian. Draco picked a smaller place in the end, but it was packed with people. They got the last table in the house, that was just vacated by an American couple. They were complaining loudly about the staff not speaking English.
“Yes,” he nodded.
They walked along the Alley arm-in-arm. A chilly wind swept through the street and Ginny cuddled closer. Harry looked down at her face and could see that she was still a bit cross with him. She wasn't paying attention to him, as instead, she was eyeing the package in Harry's hand.
"Of course they were!" she cried in indignation. "Everyone at school talked about it all the time. They had the perfect partnership. I just can't understand why they never got married."
"But why? And does he know about it?" he asked, remembering how unchanged Ron was that morning.
"Harry, we came down together, you sat next to me all the time, and she couldn't have missed the way you were ogling me in the pool."
He frowned. “This is unimportant now though. With the Light Families in charge of the Wizengamot, you’ll never change the divorce laws.”
"Three, actually. One of them, Albus, is about your age," Harry revealed.
Harry headed to the flower greenhouse after turning down the suggestion that he lie down in one of the guest bedrooms. He loved the smell of flowers there and hoped that they would help him in resting his eyes on a bench. They looked hard, but all had cushioning charms on them to make them more comfortable. Harry lay down on a long one where he could stretch his legs out and there was some more room left over his head even. However, he could still not rest. His mind was as on edge as it had been all night.
"We always used Muggle transportation to go abroad. Father never liked having his movements monitored."
"Not far, Mr Potter, not far. Go down on street right one corner, go down street on left, walk and there hotel," Mr Samarn explained in heavily accented but somewhat understandable English.
"Thank Merlin! Not that... I mean..."
"Just kidding. Nothing happened. You passed out on the couch."
"Not really. However, they had the ability to kill intruders and I guess that sort of qualified them as dark."
"Well, perhaps not in the Wizarding World, but in the Muggle World they do. I saw some ads for musicians in small bands," Harry informed him. "Why don't you have a look?"
“Well, you know, I’m brilliant,” Draco said and Harry was so glad to see his old self-confidence at full force.
"You look surprised, Harry. Did you forget your birthday?" Draco suggested.
Hermione looked at Harry with alarm at hearing this. They both knew that the Light Families were ignorant in their knowledge of the Muggle world and just like Mr. Weasley - they only saw the good side of it. They didn't know anything about how Muggles dealt with anything new or beyond their understanding. Still, they opted not to comment as Malfoy was explaining further and they needed to hear more.
"Aren't you having a bit too much?"
He quickly dressed and frowned at the fact that all he had were a few items of clothing. He crept down to the first floor. He may have been crap at Potions, but his eggs were even favoured by his uncle, who complained every year that he could only have them in the summer. Well, he would have to wait a lot longer now, until eternity. He only hoped the blond teen liked his breakfast as much as he liked the dinner last night.
Hermione stood up and poured a glass of Firewhisky. She handed it to the blond and he drank it without even glancing at the glass. He put it down onto the coffee table empty, but the fury was gone from his countenance.
As they waited for their food, it was hard to keep their hands off of each other. Harry did send an air kiss towards the blond, and they settled for playing footsie under the table.
Throughout the initial planning phase Harry had arrived to the realisation that this wasn't just about Hermione. In fact, it wasn't just about her divorce for Hermione either. It was about every woman. As much as he didn't like to think about it, some day it was going to be about his daughter, Lily as well. She may end up in a marriage one day that she would not like to stay in and have to make the kind of decision Hermione was faced with. It was like what happened in the Muggle world and what was still needed to happen in some countries. They were doing something really important. They were giving women what they were entitled to, and that was equal rights under the eyes of the law.
He tried to spring out of bed, but it proved to be another foolish action for two reasons. One was that the covers were thicker and heavier to what he was used to and when he attempted to fling them aside and jump out of the bed in one motion, he miscalculated. His legs got entangled in the covers. The second reason was that the bed happened to be a lot higher than what he was used to; therefore, what he estimated to being a small step down, turned out to be much steeper. The end result was that he fell out of the bed, legs entangled in the covers on top of the bed, hit his head with a bang into the floor rug, and was hanging upside down in a very uncomfortable position. In his dizzy state of mind, he called himself many kinds of fool, but his morning trial was not over.
"Yes, I suggested to Ginny that I leave the Aurors and take up politics. She was delighted at the idea and suggested taking back my seats herself, just like you predicted, Draco. I'm going to discuss it with Arthur tonight, so it shouldn't be long."
"Of course not, you git. Glad you no longer hold that illusion. You have to win them. True, you are the Boy Who Lived, but your recent actions had not endeared you to the Light Families' hearts."
"What?" Draco was startled by the sudden words.
"Wouldn't he be... you know... jealous? I mean, you and him were..."
"Great. I'll leave you two alone to chat. I'll be in the library checking up on my son if you need anything," the blond man said as he put down his empty cup and stood from his seat.
is doing," Ginny said, clearly annoyed.
"Harry!" he shouted and jumped into the waiting arms of the other teen.
Ginny was not at the table. Like most mornings, she was away somewhere. Harry tried to remember where she had gone off to, then recalled her mentioning some tropical island in the Pacific. He couldn't think of the name though. In the last two years she had proclaimed that she had had enough of sitting at home and expressed a desire to travel. Harry would have gone with her, but she didn’t want the presence of the children, and Harry’s career was important, so she went off on her own. Ever since then, she would only stay a week at home at a time, until she wanted to be somewhere else. Harry understood her desire to see the world and as she was his wife, he supported her fully. The children occasionally missed her, but Harry always had a more active role in their lives, even when she was present. Harry always understood everything she did.
"Well then, I have to thank my boyfriend for arranging it," Draco said, as he approached Harry to give him a long and passionate kiss.
"Come, sit down Harry!" the other man motioned for him to join him and Harry took him up on his offer. "Had a bit too much? Me too," Draco said as Harry nodded.
"No."
"Can I get my hand back now, please? My ear is still clogged, and I want to get a mint from the stewardess."
"Yes. You know how much I love large parties," Harry said sarcastically.
"What are we going to do today?" Harry asked, looking to Draco for guidance.
Harry got ten dollars out of his small bag and he gave it to the boy. They said goodbye and he entered the Floo office. He was glad to see that it was still open.
"Thank you," Harry said. "Yes, it was a nasty shock."
"I'm protecting them, not her. The wrongs she had done could be a stigma on them, too."
"Poor Lavinia! I'm so glad she moved to Switzerland and can't see the destruction of her home!" she cried, her voice rather high and sounding very snotty. "It's obvious that Hildegard was brought up as a Muggle. No taste whatsoever."
"There is no Wizengamot meeting this week, remember? That was why you picked last Saturday to go to Thailand. No courts either. Do you want to get the divorce on the way? There may be no courts, but we can still get the ball rolling."
"It's for 3-4."
Ginny, however, just stood there.
“Anyone else have any questions?”
"I'm afraid they'll doubt the beginning of their existence. It may also put some of their family in jail. I know they deserve that, but Ginny is still their mother and Ron their uncle. I keep remembering the boy I met on the train. All the things we've gone through. I don't want to destroy them. I don't want revenge," he said, taking comfort from the presence behind him.
"No." Harry shook his head.
"Harry, please!" Draco begged, and Harry knew he was ready.
"No. Hermione is divorcing him and I took her side. So now everyone is mad  at me!" Harry shouted, his frustration finally surfacing.
"Why does Al have to go to school?" Scorpius moaned. "He could study at home with me. He's bored there anyway."
"It's okay."
Read and review guys! Love reviews. Who doesn't?
“No.”
"Dad!" his children exclaimed and were about to run to him.
Even in Hermione's absence, their day progressed the way it usually did. After some playtime, which for Al was reading time, they all got dressed to visit their grandparents. All the Weasley children and grandchildren gathered for a Christmas lunch at the Burrow. After eating, the women helped clear away the remnants of the meal, and the children went out to play in the snow. That year they actually had a white Christmas. In some years the adults had to conjure snow. Harry joined in on the vigorous snowball fight and took special delight in dousing Ron with as much cold as possible. He felt he really needed to make him feel the chill. Once exhausted, he went inside to warm up with a cup of tea he found in the kitchen.
"How horrible!" Narcissa exclaimed, and motioned for the boys to sit down. She poured them both cups of tea and handed them the saucers.
Draco frowned, but the other was clearly enjoying the food. So he sat down as well. He took his knife and fork, and tentatively tried them. The dish was indeed as good, or probably better than the meatballs the night before. Apparently, Harry could cook.
"Confucius said, 'Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves'. I understand what you're saying, Harry. Though my instinct is to eradicate her from the face of the Earth for everything she's done to you. However, now my job is to release the tension in you now. You know, my mother and Hermione offered to deal with bedtime for the children." He smiled and turned Harry around. "I just know how to get you to relax."
