“Any sort of… sign… that he may still be affiliated with Death Eaters, or their kind.”
“Is this… your bedroom?” Potter asked, and Draco nodded, having almost forgotten that Potter was there too.
Harry sat up in bed, shaking, in a cold sweat. He was breathing fast, and it took him a few seconds to realise that it had been a dream.
“It’s a huge help, Pansy,” Hermione said, “really. This means that when we do get him out, we’ll have a much easier time dealing with the Ministry.”
“We did it!” Potter said, punching the air. That got them a few strange looks from other people passing through the foyer.
She pouted. “You know I can’t. If I try and do it, our apartment will burn down.”
“Uh, I dunno. Isn’t it good to do it earlier?” Pansy said, sitting on the chair next to Draco and taking a bite of her toast.
It doesn’t have to be today. Not if you aren’t ready.”
"Don't tell anyone! You promised!" Draco giggled, and almost fell over.
“Rare to have a house elf, these days,” Theodore noted, looking a little jealous.
“Thanks.”
in my bedroom, there’ll be trouble. And I’m not paying for his food or anything, either.”
“Wait,” Draco croaked, surprising himself. “Please… stay.”
Draco looked at him. “You’ve been there once, Potter. I lived there for the best part of 17 years. I think it’s safer if you just take my arm.”
“Yeah. Okay. I’ll, uh, see you at work, then.” He turned to leave.
"It's okay. I know it's hard for you right now." She paused. "You know… the rest of us aren't exactly sailing through either… It's different, but I've been talking to Blaise, and, well, we've had similar experiences. People still tiptoe around us, or sneer at us… You should come back to the old gang, Draco."
“What are we looking for?” Harry asked.
Yeah, no.
“Come on, dance with me?”
Harry and Draco did so, not making eye contact. Harry glanced over at Malfoy, seeing his Nimbus 2001. It seemed like a lifetime ago that Malfoy's dad had bought Nimbus 2001s for the entire Slytherin team, before losing to Gryffindor anyway. Harry smiled, letting out a quiet chuckle.
After a few seconds of discomfort, they opened their eyes inside the clinically clean entrance hall of St Mungos.
"Come on, we'll go back to my house. I can only take two at a time with apparition, so you come first with Teddy, and then I'll come back for Harry and Hermione."
Amyra gestured to her couch, and Harry sat as she waved her wand in the general direction of the kettle, which started to boil.
“Potter!” Draco called over the chaos of their spells, “hold them off, we need to secure the safe!”
Ginny walked through the kitchen door, and Harry quickly closed the folder. "Don't worry, I'm not coming to have a look at your top secret work. Just want to say goodbye before you go off."
Hair still untameable, round glasses, soft face, skinny and tall, and of course, the jagged red scar on his forehead.
“I’m sorry, Ivan.”
“I was weak.”
“Down the hallway, last door on your left.”
“I still don’t understand why we’re at a Muggle bar,” Draco said, just loud enough that Pansy could hear him over the music.
“Er-”
“That is a shame. Ukraine is beautiful. Especially the countryside. I come from a small town, Berehove, right near the border to Hungary. I love it there.”
The elevator door dinged, and Harry stepped out. He needed to get some files from his desk before heading home.
“I don’t know her current whereabouts…”
Sorry this update took so long, I had writer's block :/ hopefully the update speed will pick up soon!
Harry paused. He opened his mouth to speak, closed it when nothing came out, took a deep breath, and managed to speak. “I’m sorry for… you know. Shouting at you. I know you were genuinely trying to help, and I shouldn’t have said what I said.”
for Merlin’s sake.”
What does that have to do with my mother’s escape!?”
physical abuse
“Draco. So
“Do I really need to spell it out for you?” Robards sighed. “Obviously I don’t have all the details, seeing as I am not the one who committed the crime-”
“You’re not serious-”
By the time Andromeda announced that supper was ready, Draco found that he was actually enjoying spending time with Teddy, despite the fact that (in Pansy’s words) he was as clueless with children as a Muggle with a wand.
She shrugged. “You’ve never killed anyone.”
Harry took out his phone.
“Hi, Blaise.”
Draco pushed open the doors at the top of the staircase, and switched on the light that illuminated the passageway behind them. The passage went both left, and right, and each side had three doors, and another at the end of them.
She had come home with them that day, so she could see Ginny and spend the weekend.
“Um, Blaise, where’s your bathroom?”
Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.
Her eyes widened. “Fuck, I’m so sorry - I’ve just been getting takeout, I haven’t cooked since Ron left-”
Hermione huffed, and rolled her eyes. “Ron, just because we didn’t meet one of Sirius’ old friends or anything doesn’t mean our work wasn’t valuable-”
“I’m impressed,” Lucius said, his face once again broken into a terrible smile. “You’ve learned more than I thought you had.”
She pulled him into a hug, and he held her tight.
“So… what? They framed him?”
It wasn’t long before Harry reached his apartment - he hadn’t realised before how close he and Draco lived - and called out to Hermione as he opened the door. “I’m home!”
“What?” He said, in an accusatory tone.
“Reckon you’re going to find anything?”
“No trouble, don’t worry.” Ivan smiled, and Draco did too.
“Harry,” Hermione began tentatively, “how many times did you think Malfoy was behind all those schemes at Hogwarts? And how many times was he actually not involved at all?”
Avoiding as much of the blood as possible, Draco stepped around the bodies and moved to the next room.
"That's good," Draco said, his brow furrowed slightly.
okay i promise i won't keep you waiting for the next chapter so long i know this was a terrible place to end but !! i am going to try updating weekly from now on. so we shall see how that goes for me. anyway. draco is babey and id die for him wbu
There was a knock at the door. He heard Hermione’s voice calling his name. “Harry!”
“Is it weird that my parents already drew up a will?” Draco said, absent-mindedly chewing his nail.
Harry looked at Hermione, and they both shrugged. Robards gave them a look, as if to say,
Why did McGonagall have to teach them this spell? Just because it was Valentine's day? He would have been quite happy pretending he had no fated mate at all rather than knowing his fated mate hated him.
"Fuck, Harry… you're doing so well. You feel so good," Draco whispers, thumbs tracing circles on my hip bones soothingly.
"A day. The transfiguration took longer than expected. The damage to your heart ran deeper than we knew… but Avery is confident they healed all the damage. Your heart should be completely normal. You came out of the procedure three hours ago."
"Anthony is punishing you, too. He's punishing you for being bi, for having friends... and for having a life outside of him."
Hermione rolls her eyes at me, looking over his chart. "What were you expecting, Harry?"
Narcissa, Luna, and Parkinson all stand when I step inside. Ginny is curled up in an armchair in the corner. They're all still in their dress robes.
"We'll be back with the pensieve. This is going to be so much fun. Help yourselves to curry." Ginny winks.
"You two are such saps," Ginny announces as Draco takes the goblet from Luna's hands.
Harry's lips move against mine, kissing me sweetly. I feel all the tension drain from my body.
I consider not answering, but I know from experience just how persistent this man is. He'll keep asking until I tell him... and I trust him.
There is a loud crack and the old house elf is suddenly standing before me.
"Well? Are you just going to stare or-"
My heart is hammering. I'm worried sick about Molly... and that's on top of hearing about this curse.
I let myself into the manor, too irritated to be scared of what I'm walking into. The torches light themselves. It's dusty... and the chill in the air is sapping all the heat from my body.
Malfoy cupped Harry's face in his hands. Harry forgot how to breathe. He forgot about everything he came here to do. Malfoy's breath smelled like tea and mint. He leaned toward him, wanting to kiss him again.
"What are y-" Harry cut himself off as Draco's tongue flick over his hole. Instead of words, a loud moan escaped his mouth.
"Anthony Goldstein." Anthony schools his face into one of polite interest and sits down.
Looking up at Malfoy Manor makes my blood run cold. I have so many bad memories of this place. Memories of being tortured and threatened.
Harry's mouth falls open. He closes it and stops examining the potion. "Is that all she said?"
"It's not like that. Well it kind of is. Um." Harry hastily shoves the box into his pocket. "Luna gave it to me."
"I guess that's to be expected."
Bill smiles and slips his wand out of his sleeve. "Alright."
"A bit, but it's manageable. I just want to get you off a different way. Pull out?"
Draco blinks at me slowly before grabbing my wand off the bedside table. A moment later, the room is bright with the
Once we are deep enough, we slip under the surface. We swim deeper until there are a few meters of water between us and the surface. We let ourselves sink to the sand and start stretching.
"I'll do all the work. All you have to do is lie there," Goldstein coaxes.
"But why would he leave? Why wouldn't he tell us?" Arthur asks, still sounding worried.
That was what I thought. Today changed that. I can't remember the last time I saw Harry looking so relaxed and happy.
More recently, he's gotten louder. He'll yell and interrupt me often. Once he punched the wall next to my head when I came home late. Then, he apologized and told me it was my fault for making him wait.
I can't blame her for worrying. I was hospitalized the last time I had a panic attack. Her fingers find my pulse before I can answer.
Faye grips the vial in her shaking hands, but after a moment, she pours it into her mouth.
If she turns up. It's not unlike her to go missing for weeks. Her profession involves a lot of sneaking around and finding information and blackmail. So I'm not really worried… but I wish she had chosen a better time for this job she's on.
"Did she tell you anything about who might have cursed her?"
Yes. But before we even began dating, Hermione Granger took over. Ever since, all medical responsibility for me lies in her hands.
"Hermione is officially your healer now. Elliot is worried that I'm too close to you to treat you properly." Harry shifts his weight. "I'm sorry, Draco. I told you I would heal you."
I shake my head once, looking down at my plate. I must not be keeping my disappointment hidden because a gentle hand touches my shoulder.
"Leave us."
He pulls me to the window seat. Heat rises in my cheeks as he settles against me, pulling the blanket over us.
"What happened in there? Is the curse broken?" Ginny demands, kneeling beside me.
I open my mouth to protest, but then I remember Malfoy laughing at my comment earlier. I've never seen him laughing like that because of me before. He hadn't seemed like such a git then. His grey eyes had twinkled with mirth and his white-blond hair had fallen in tangled knots around his face. That had actually been quite nice. I liked seeing him so open and ruffled.
Draco nodded.
Harry tried to open the second draw down, but it was locked.
“Wh-what?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “He’s not that hard to deal with.”
“My mother gave it to me before I went to Hogwarts,” Draco said, the silver chain draped over his fingers. “She said it was good luck, for getting into Slytherin. But my father saw me wearing it, and he- he threw it away. Said it was too ‘girly’, and that he didn’t want people thinking I was a- a faggot.” Draco breathed in, shakily. “I fished it out of the trash, and hid it.”
“What do you mean,
“She’s going home. In case you forgot, your aunt tortured her at this place, Malfoy.”
However, none of them had done their N.E.W.Ts. Even the students who had (almost) completed their seventh year hadn’t written exams.
“That doesn’t look very secure,” Potter muttered.
“I have to go to the Manor,” Draco said, surprising himself and Potter with the determination in his voice.
“Of course. You’re my best friend, Harry. I love you.”
“There’s no time, Hermione! If there’s a mole in the Ministry, we need to find out who it is right away.”
“Anyway, how are you holding up?”
“Wow, I can’t believe you’re actually agreeing with me.”
It was, in fact, seventeen minutes, by Draco’s watch, before Andromeda finished cooking.
“We have to do
“You’re welcome, Harry.” She broke away from the hug, and looked directly into his eyes. “I’ll always be here for you. You know that, right?”
He felt a hand on his shoulder, and turned to see Andromeda.
"Hey, Earth to Harry."
They slipped inside.
“What for?”
Granger didn’t say anything.
“We’d have to prove that the Ministry framed him,” Hermione said softly, “if we can somehow get a recording of Robards admitting to it all being a scheme, or-”
“We have been there before, you know,” Harry muttered.
“Well, yeah, but also that he genuinely regrets it. I’m not trying to excuse what we did. It was awful. But we didn’t have a choice, really. It was either following in our parents’ footsteps or being ostracised from the family, and hardly any of us were brave enough to choose the latter.”
“Just do it!”
Ginny touched Harry’s arm, and he turned to face her.
“My mother is dead,” Draco said, his voice croaking.
“When you say The Unspoken One, do you mean… Voldemort?”
Draco didn’t move for a few seconds. Harry moved forwards, about to try and say something,
my computer is currently broken, and i  d e s p i s e  writing on my phone so i did this on my mom's laptop, just means updates are gonna be even slower than usual :/ also exams are soon so. i am supposedly studying
“Oh, er, hi, Pansy. Is- Is Malfoy here?”
Hoping that for Merlin’s sake, Potter would listen to him
Kingsley wrapped up the lesson soon after that, and they headed home. Hermione was still living with her parents in London, but Ron and Harry apparated back to the Burrow with Mr Weasley.
“I- I- God, Harry, how do you do it?” She sobbed, burying her face in her hands, “How do you stay so strong all the time? Doesn’t- doesn’t it still hurt?”
His hands were trembling again.
“You didn’t drag me into it. And it didn’t get in the way of the mission. We still got the information we needed, even if we did get a little bit… sidetracked.” Potter smiled, almost mischievously. “And besides, it’s over now. We can tell Robards what we learned, he can send some people to go get the records from the Manor, and then we go find these Purists.”
“Er, I’m… I’m alright,” Draco said, attempting a weak smile.
“You too, Harry. Sit down, I’ll bring some snacks.” Dean bustled off to the kitchen, leaving Harry to catch up with Seamus and Neville.
The two dementors outside Lucius’s cell drifted to the side as Harry and his patronus walked towards the door. He put the key in, and turned it.
“Oh. Yeah. I mean, that makes sense.”
Harry felt something in his stomach. He couldn’t quite place a finger on the emotion.
“Don’t worry about it. I made eggs for breakfast, left yours in the frying pan.”
“Er, hi,” Harry said.
want to move.
Potter's hair was swept back, and he had the same blissful expression Draco remembered from school. It was the same way Draco had wanted to feel.
“Anyway, I’ve gotta go. Robards actually, uh, specifically told me not to come and see you. I kind of ignored that part of his owl.”
“Yeah.”
“He didn’t do anything. Why did they… he didn’t do anything.” Tears started to stream down her face.
“Well, it’s almost 2. We should get to training.”
“Well, it is very nice, but it’s important to look at other options too-”
Harry strode over to the desk. “What ward is Amyra Collins in?”
“Thanks for the support,” Harry said coldly, once they were out of Robards’ office.
should have changed.
“It’s Potter,” she hissed.
Granger held on to Robards’ arm, and Goldstein onto Langsley’s, and they disapparated. Draco looked over at Potter. “Well, good luck,” Potter said, and vanished. Draco closed his eyes, pictured the farm in his mind, and turned on the spot.
Rex shook his head. “Sorry, but as I said, I’ve been living as a muggle. Haven’t spoken to another wizard in years.”
“It’s Amyra,” he said, his voice shaking, “she’s been hurt.”
"Yeah, well, stop trying," he snarled, and Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but was cut off by the loud pop of apparition.
“Er, Ron Weasley isn’t here yet, sir,” Harry said.
Ron finally looked at him.
Dean came back, wielding a bowl of chips. “So, Harry, to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?” He asked, sitting down next to Seamus.
Malfoy looked back at Harry. There was something strange in his expression that Harry couldn’t quite pinpoint.
Andromeda deposited Teddy on the floor with the dragons. “I’m nearly with the cooking - won’t you keep Teddy entertained while I finish up?”
She made a face. “Lame without all of you guys there. I’ve still got Luna, though.”
“Remind me again how this is going to work without us getting fired?”
“Okay.”
Draco nodded. “We will,” he said, and he meant it.
Amyra nodded.
Draco nodded.
Blaise looked at him, wide eyed. "Uh, what?"
“Hi everyone! Just took the lasagne out the oven…”
“You’ll only learn by practise, Ronald.”
“I saw you. I was running past, and I saw you fighting a Death Eater.”
“What are you doing?”
He broke away. “Uh, there’s no food.”
“Fred,” Harry said, his voice cracking. Hermione moved to stand next to him, and squeezed his hand. “You?”
“Him being an animagus? Yeah.”
“Listen, you might not believe me - most people didn’t - but I really had nothing to do with my parents. I despised them. I never met any of their friends, or talked to anyone they tried to introduce me to. I was in Slytherin, but I stayed away from the Death Eater wannabes. I had nothing to do with these attacks, I promise you. But,” she said, and paused, her eyes landing on Draco, “my parents kept journals. I got everything after they died; I’m their only child. I haven’t read all of the journals. The parts I did read made me sick. But you’re welcome to have a look at them. Maybe it’ll help you. I don’t know.”
“Then we definitely need you here. This will be our safehouse - if Andromeda is alright with it - and we need someone who can reliably heal. We don’t know how much fighting we’ll be doing.”
Draco’s heart jumped to his mouth.
“She’s okay,” Harry said, “well, I don’t know. She’s managing.”
Looking a little bit more determined, Pansy nodded again.
He stared at her. “I was kind of, you know, a Death Eater. And before that, I bullied people for like, six years.”
“Why are you so insistent on being a bad person?”
Draco pulled a large, ornate, golden key from his pocket. “Just a lock, Potter. I suppose you’ve heard of one of those before?”
Lucius smiled, thin and menacing. “Or what?”
“Er, I was invited,” Harry said, feeling increasingly awkward, “Draco and I are…” he paused, trying to find the right word, “...colleagues.”
Draco turned away, feeling his cheeks turn red. He looked down at his hands, fidgeting in his lap. “It’s cold, I think I’m going to go back…” Draco trailed off, not finishing the sentence he didn’t want to say.
Harry looked at her as they walked down the corridor. “What?”
Pansy had recently cut her hair. She had a long bob, with a shaved part at the bottom. Her hair was currently loose, hiding the undercut. She had several ear piercings, and wore a black crop top with ripped jeans.
Draco glanced around. Most of the senior aurors had put on a facade of confidence, but the trainees all had the same expression of terror.
The boat stopped against the small jetty that was tacked onto the rock, and they made their way up the winding path to the prison. Harry's stag followed them closely, dancing around them in circles.
She nodded.
“Bill? What are you doing here?” Potter said, standing up.
Why were they using Veritaserum? They’d framed him, so they knew it wouldn’t work.
“Morning.” She yawned again, stretching her arms above her head. “How do you look less tired than me when I went to bed earlier?”
Luke smiled. “My place or yours?”
Harry grinned. “And I thought your rebellious streak had vanished.”
Most of it was what you would expect - paperwork, case files, etcetera. Harry opened the top draw of the desk, and looked around. More of the same - spare quills and ink, parchment paper.
“Come on,” Pansy said, grabbing his arm. They began the walk up to the mansion, along the winding path.
“You alright?”
The doors swung open, and Blaise stood there in magnificent blue dress robes lined with silver thread.
* [from the Harry Potter wiki page]: "Crouch and his parents hatched a plot under which Crouch's mother would take his place in Azkaban, using the Polyjuice Potion to disguise herself. She died and was buried in Azkaban, with the result that the wizarding world believed that Crouch himself was dead."
"Change of plans," Harry interjected, and the woman glared at him. "We need to see both of them."
“Malfoy?” Neville said, “Wasn’t he just arrested?”
“I’m fine. I just… I’m
“Hermione, to quote you, ‘It’s good to know what the enemy is thinking.’”
“Well, neither Rex nor Max had any relatives, so… I suppose we’ll have to send him to a shelter,” Robards said.
“My dad said that there were some records there that we need for work.”
It felt like Ron had just dropped a ton of bricks.
"I know, Harry. It's okay."
“Alohamora,” he whispered, and the lock clicked.
The lift door closed.
“Good, good, come into my office.” Robards gestured at a door, and Harry opened it, Robards following behind him. “Go on, have a seat! You’re not in trouble, don’t worry.” The old man smiled, an endearing expression on his face, which seemed to be more lined with worry than usual.
Draco’s body moved of its own accord, opening the door, and walking inside.
Ginny's words echoed in his mind.
"Yeah."
“Harry, I… are you sure you’re alright?” Hermione put a hand on his shoulder.
Pansy sighed. “I suppose he’s not all bad.”
“The enemy? The war’s over, Theodore. In case you forgot, Voldemort’s dead.”
How could he have been so stupid?
This - Malfoy Manor - was where Hermione had been
Hermione sighed. “I don’t know, Harry. It just sounds like that’s his private stuff.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, the words coming out as barely a whisper.
Harry almost jumped at the use of his first name. He looked around, and Draco was looking at him almost pleadingly.
Draco didn't meet his eyes. "I was really drunk."
“That’s an understatement,” said Seamus.
“Ah, thank you - our house elf has always been fantastic.”
“Ron? It’s Harry. Can I come in?”
Harry nodded, and left Robards’ room, heading back to his desk to fetch some of his paperwork.
It was opened almost immediately by an elderly house elf, who squinted up at them from orange eyes.
“You will now be debriefed by your senior aurors. Get into your groups.”
They exited Draco’s old bedroom, walking back into the passageway.
Harry shook his head. “No idea.”
They fought so much now, and they hardly got any time to spend just the two of them with Harry working every day. Even weekends were filled with writing report after report that they hadn’t finished during the week, and when Harry and Ron were finally finished it was all they could do not to pass out on their way up the stairs.
Draco felt as though he was dreaming. He almost felt as though he was floating, observing the scene, but not corporeal.
"Alright, mate?" Ron said, frowning.
“It’s really nice,” Hermione said, beaming.
The door swung open to reveal a dishevelled woman with curly black hair, holding black a big, shaggy black dog that was barking excitedly.
Draco grimaced. "Sorry. I didn't have time."
“We’ll get the confession - our word is much stronger than his - and then the Purists can stop, and all that’s left is to cover up our tracks. It’s-”
“Hermione,” Harry said, and she jumped.
Posters on the walls of his Quidditch team - the Falmouth Falcons - the biggest one with seven signatures on it from when they’d gone to see the Falcons at their final match against the Chudley Cannons in 1993; another poster, this one of his favourite band at the time, the Wyrd Sisters; a Slytherin house banner.
Potter started walking again.
“For what?”
"Thanks. Me, too."
“Well, I think it’s a wonderful idea,” Percy said, nodding solemnly, inciting a murmur of agreement.
“He looks more pissed about it than us,” Ron muttered under his breath. Harry nodded. Despite his usually cheerful demeanor, Robards looked tired. He had dark bags under his eyes, and he seemed skinnier.
“We faked her death, and exchanged her body with a different dead body disguised as hers, while she escaped…”
"It's alright, Potter will fill you in."
Hermione looked at him, frowning in concentration. “If they found out about the safe at the same time that we did, then…”
Pansy shook her head, standing up to get the door.
"Oh," Draco said, and Harry looked back at him. "I'm sorry."
a Death Eater, for fuck's sake. If I refuse to go and visit my father, they'll think something's going on."
Harry laughed awkwardly. “Er, sorry. We’re here about something more serious.” He glanced around, and everyone was looking at him expectantly. “It’s about… it’s about Malfoy.”
“That’s all I can ask from you. And I’ll say it again - I’m here for you. Whatever you need.”
“Well, we could try and find out who the spy is ourselves.”
“NO! STOP!” He yelled, but they were already gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, well, I was just trying to find the cafeteria to get some coffee,” he said.
He felt the familiar feeling of his air being pushed out of his lungs, and his whole body being compressed, before the feeling stopped, and he opened his eyes.
“What do you mean?”
"Don't both of you have work to be doing?" Hermione had walked over to them. Her hair had been trimmed to shoulder length, and was tied back in a neat bun. She looked very professional, unlike Ron and Harry.
“...I don’t know, maybe I’m just over analysing. What do you think?”
"Yes, yes, we'll just look- Harry, I'm so glad you came round- come on!"
if he was going to have that attitude.
As it turned out, he needn’t have worried - he and Andromeda were the only other guests apart from Draco himself, and Pansy Parkinson.
Draco stared at her. “What did he want?”
"I love you too, dumbass."
"So, this is the first time you've done any field work. This kind of investigative stuff is usually fairly simple - they don't want to talk, and we don't have a warrant, so we're not allowed to force them to. However, it can go south very quickly, especially when we're dealing with offenders like the Parkinsons. Just follow my lead, and don't do anything stupid, and you'll be fine."
They began to approach the rock that Azkaban was perched on. It was surrounded by a thin mist, and the air seemed to be getting colder.
Draco took a step forwards. “Tell us what you know about the Purists.”
Ron nodded. “Right then. I’m in.”
“Yeah.”
Draco shrugged. “I’m sure there’s a bunch of spells, too. And probably a nasty hex if you put in the wrong code.”
Harry stood up. “I must’ve just had a bad apparition. Passed out.”
“Draco? What’s wrong?”
“Malfoy,
“Avada Kedavra!”
"Yeah, yeah, of course we will." Her phone buzzed. "Speaking of which... it's this girl I met the other night, Lana." She picked up the phone. "Hey! Yeah, I'm free... that sounds good... I'll be over in half an hour... bye!" She grinned at Draco. "Duty calls. There's a very pretty girl who
“Don’t hurt Draco any more than you already have.”
Andromeda had made a delicious looking pasta, as well as a large butternut salad. Teddy had his own bowl of pasta with what looked to be ketchup and cheddar cheese on it.
He turned his head to look at Harry, and Harry saw a tear fall down his cheek.
Draco snorted. “Says the girl who almost failed her OWLs because she fell asleep in the Charms exam.”
"What?" Harry frowned, "I mean, he was awful when he was my teacher, but he… Dumbledore trusted him…" Harry trailed off.
A singular carrot lay on the bottom shelf, along with some cheese that was definitely off, and butter.
Draco smiled. He wasn’t sure why it was still so hard to come out, even to a stranger.
Blaise laughed, "Whaaat, Draco?"
“Harry, I’m so sorry,” Hermione breathed.
“Oh. Sorry, now probably isn’t the ideal time for a ramble of analysis about high-school relationships and trauma.”
“Oh, still training to be a Healer. It’s a long course. Working odd jobs in my spare time to cover rent.”
Draco stood, the letter grasped firmly in his hands. He had to read over the words three more times before it finally sunk into his head what it meant, and a feeling of numbness began to spread all over his body.
“Do you think she actually knows what’s going on, or is she just as confused as the rest of us?” Ron asked.
“Now, now, let’s keep it civil,” Blaise said.
“It doesn’t exactly help us break Draco out of prison,” she said bitterly.
“Thank you.” He paused. “Still sure you can’t come?”
“They look fine, Draco,” Pansy sighed, applying lipstick, “better than fine. Great. Fantastic. Fabulous.”
Once he was out of the main office area, he cast a non-verbal disillusionment charm, and walked quickly to catch up with Robards, Potter and Granger.
“Yeah, but we just do it badly anyway.”
He turned around to see Pansy. She jerked her head towards the door. “Let’s go outside.”
Harry looked over at Hermione as the lift lurched to the left, and noticed that she was absent-mindedly chewing her nails, her brows furrowed in worry.
They followed Rex inside to his living room, where they seated themselves on his sofa.
They looked at each other, not needing to speak to convey their shared thought.
“Yeah.” Hermione tucked her hair behind her ear. “Sorry, Harry, I came and asked how you were and just started talking about me. How are you doing? With Ginny, and everything?”
"I'm sorry," he said, breaking away from the hug. Padfoot barked happily, and started licking Harry's hand.
“Yes, don’t worry. I’ll be out soon.”
doing here?”
Pansy snorted. “Definitely.”
Potter sat down on the porch, and Draco sat next to him. There were a few moments of silence before Potter spoke.
But, once he started going to Hogwarts, he had been constantly outclassed by Potter and the Gryffindors, even when his father had bought the most expensive brooms on the market for their whole team.
“Uh,” Harry said, gesturing at her trunk, “I suppose I’d better take this.”
Harry showed them all to the table, where Hermione was standing, her hair frizzier than usual, the salad and lasagne next to her.
Draco opened his mouth and then closed it again, frozen. An uncomfortable silence filled the small room, which was now overcrowded. Potter was the one who finally broke it.
They all turned on the spot, and had the air sucked out of their lungs as they were crushed and squeezed through space.
“Listen, I’m gonna go, I’ve got class early tomorrow. Can you make your own way home?”
“Well, not completely. At least we’ve ruled out a suspect,” Malfoy said, quietly.
Potter lifted his head up. “We have to find these people. The Purists. We’ve got to stop them.”
Harry froze. “Er,” he mumbled feebly, “she’s… she’s probably still recovering. From surgery, you know.”
Draco paused, his eyes wandering over the room. He was trying to ignore the dead bodies of Rex and Max, which proved to be quite difficult when their blood was strewn all over the room.
“I’ll take the couch,” Malfoy said, walking over to it and dumping his suitcase.
“I think… I thought that I could just ignore everything, and then it would go away. But it actually just made everything worse. And now I can’t think about anything except her.”
Harry avoided her searching gaze. “I don’t know. Yes. We- we have to be okay.”
Once back at Andromeda’s house, they resumed their places in the living room to think.
“Draco, are you gonna eat anytime soon? It’s almost midnight.”
“I don’t know, Potter. For dragging you into my messy family life, for letting it get in the way of the mission.”
“So- you’re saying-”
"It's a secret. You can't tell anyone, kay?"
They got to work just before 8, as planned, and the building was pretty much empty - most people arrived from 8.30 to 9. It was strange, without the usual bustle and noise.
Draco felt like he was going to throw up. He took a couple of steps forwards. “Potter, don’t, it’s alright-”
"It's quite alright, Potter, just remember we're doing serious work from now on." Robards chuckled fondly at Potter's almost childish innocence. It was something that had been almost completely lost since the battle.
He opened the door, revealing a safe.
“So you knew I wouldn’t approve of this? Tried to do it sneakily?”
They walked down a quaint, cobbled road for a few more minutes before arriving at a small cottage house. It looked like the opposite kind of place that one would expect to find dark magic and Muggle killings.
“Yeah, I heard,” Draco hissed back, “what does he want?”
“Hey.”
Hermione shrugged.
Amyra sighed, and ran a hand through her hair. "I'm sorry, these probably aren't the anecdotes you want to be hearing about your father."
“Oh, yeah. I’m an Auror,” Draco said, feeling relief wash over him.
Harry walked in alone.
“Uh, yeah. Alright,” Ron said, and for the first time since Harry had arrived, he smiled.
Harry and Draco both nodded, and followed Robards towards the farm house.
“Hey, I’ve grown since then. And besides, you don’t need to be good at Charms to be a Healer.”
“It’s okay.”
Harry yelled, a bit louder than he had intended.
Harry scoffed. “Okay, daddy’s boy.”
A short and vaguely awkward cab ride later, they arrived at Luke’s apartment. It was small, and modest, but tidy. Luke lead Draco to the bedroom, and kissed him. Draco melted into the kiss. Both of them had alcohol-stained breath. Then, suddenly, Luke shoved Draco against the wall, pinning him there as he kissed him.
“You… you knew about…”
“Quiet down, quiet down, training is about to begin.”
also, i just wanted to say: THANK YOU! this fanfiction has picked up way more traction that i thought it would, and i am terrible at replying to comments, but please know that i read every single one and i'm so glad that people are enjoying this! thank you to every single one of you who is reading this, i appreciate you all so much :))
She smiled. “Thanks, Harry.”
“Right then,” Blaise said, “I presume you don’t want to stay for supper.”
“Thanks,” Draco said, smiling.
“Is your whole house booby trapped?”
Ginny laughed, and blew her nose.
Hermione nodded.
be thinking about Ginny.
“I’m more of a morning person than you.”
Robards accuses Draco and his mother of doing something similar to what Barty Crouch Jr did to escape Azkaban. Barty Crouch Jr. in the movies was played by David Tennant, and David Tennant also played Hamlet, so the chapter title is part of a quote from Hamlet: "Thou know'st 'tis common; all lives must die, / Passing through nature to eternity."
Harry stared at her, confused. "What? Why?"
However, it wasn't covered by health-care.
Draco immediately felt the sensation of an egg being cracked on his head, and the cold washing over his entire body. When he looked down, he could only see the floor, with a shimmering, glassy texture over the area where he knew his body was.
"Oh, they're here- Ron, please go and let them in."
It was from Azkaban.
Draco pressed his hands against his face for a few moments. “No, it’s fine, I’ll talk to him.”
She paused. “Okay.”
Harry turned the key in the apartment door, and stepped inside. “Hey, I’m back,” he called out. No response. Ron and Hermione must not have been dismissed for the day yet.
“I’m sorry, Sir,” Harry said, as Robards ran a hand through his thinning hair. “I had to know what was happening. But I can promise you, Malfoy had nothing to do with it - I didn’t tell him what the letter said.”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Last time we went out, you tried to hook up with a guy that looks
“They just- I just- I got a letter from Azkaban, and-” Draco choked on his words, his eyes burning. “It’s my mother. She’s- she’s dead.”
He materialised in the auror office, where Kingsley stood, along with most of the other aurors. He joined the group.
“Before we get down to business, I just wanted to say good work for the past ten days, Potter. I know everything’s rather rushed at the moment, but you are handling it very well.”
He looked down at his unwashed shirt and sweatpants, immediately regretting his decision, but deciding it was too late to back out.
They followed Blaise’s house elf out of the mansion, and stood outside the front door.
“Harry!” Neville said, almost knocking him over with a hug that rivaled Hagrid’s.
“Looks like it’s going well for you,” Pansy grinned.
They deserved it.
“Nah, I’m good. Hi, Hermione!” She put her trunk down at the door and gave Hermione a long hug. “It’s good to see you.”
Hermione nodded, following Mrs Weasley inside.
"Hey, no touching," the guard woman began, but Harry put his hand out to stop her moving forwards.
Draco sighed. “His hometown was destroyed by Death Eaters. And I’m pretty sure my father was one of them.”
“Uh, Robards is here,” Draco said, poking his head inside.
Potter blushed, and muttered, “Knox.”
Potter nodded, pointing to the safe that Draco was still awkwardly holding under his arm.
“I used to be,” Draco said, and he pulled up his sleeve, revealing the Dark Mark tattooed onto his skin.
As if she hadn't noticed him before, Narcissa's eyes roamed over him. "Harry Potter," she said, her voice still weak, "you're the last person I would have expected to come and visit me."
“Did you sleep with him?”
Everyone went quiet.
Feeling slightly shaky, Harry followed Draco out into the passage.
“Thanks, Harry.”
“Ivan?” He said, and put down the safe. Potter and Robards hardly noticed, so deep in their conversation, as he walked, and then ran over to where Ivan was standing, looking at him.
Draco shook his head. “Yes, I do.”
"I'll be there for your surgery."
The sun was just beginning to rise, sending golden light over the farm, which was interrupted by the red and blue flashing of the police vehicles. “Police are already there,” Robards muttered. He began to run towards the farmhouse, and the rest of them followed.
“No, I… I’m sorry, I have to…” Draco stood up, almost fell over, and made his way to the door.
Harry nodded slowly. He was about to respond, but there was a sudden bang as the door to the room flew open behind them.
“There are records of all the meetings, as well as the address of the place of our meetings, back at Malfoy Manor. They’re in a safe in the master bedroom.”
Harry swore under his breath, but nodded. “I’ll be out in a second.”
Draco undid and redid the top button on his shirt three times before finally deciding on undone, and ringing the doorbell.
Hermione nodded slowly. “You’re right. Of course you’re right.” She paused. “Should we… should we ask Ginny?” She asked timidly.
Draco nodded, and followed Ivan to the dance floor.
“I can take you home.”
Soon after they got to the bar, Draco had already downed three shots of tequila.
“This was a terrible decision, Pansy,” Draco groaned, twisting around to try and see the back of his dress robes. “I haven’t worn these things since Slughorn’s parties in sixth year.”
How had time gone so quickly?
"Bye," he said, half-heartedly.
Harry paused, wondering why he suddenly felt the need to help him. “Malfoy, I-”
Draco opened the safe door, and turned back to Harry. It looked as if he was about to say something, but he stopped, his eyes wide, and yelled, “DUCK!”
Harry left the apartment building, feeling strange.
Amyra smiled. “I was, yeah. Back at Hogwarts, we were in the same year. After I heard about his death, I found this little guy running around the neighbourhood.” She patted Padfoot’s head. “I figured it was a sign, y’know? It looks just like him.”
The man nodded, his eyes still fixated on Harry.
“Thanks, Harry.”
“Pansy, I promise you we’ll figure out a way to fix this. Okay? No matter what it takes.”
The other three exchanged glances.
Hermione nodded, unsure as always what to say about Luna. “Well, your N.E.W.Ts are coming up soon, and then you’ll be out of school with us.”
thank you for bearing with me and my very irregular updates :,)) i love you <33
“So, Ms Collins, I’m afraid we don’t come under the best terms,” Robards said.
“Fine,” he said, with a long-suffering sigh, and followed Pansy to the dance floor.
‘What did you say?”
Then again, Malfoy had been a Death Eater.
"Oh. Hey."
Draco waved his wand lazily, and some onions began to chop themselves up. He opened his bag, took out one of the journals from Amyra’s house, and began to read.
They hadn’t seen each other in years - Andromeda had been estranged from the family since he was a child.
Draco jerked upright from where he had been bent over the journals. “Uh, yeah,” he called back to Pansy.
Harry tried the door, and it opened.
The fire in Potter’s eyes seemed almost nostalgic, like an old friend he hadn’t seen in years.
Draco blushed. “Uh, yeah.”
Draco felt his face grow hot, shame crawling over his skin.
"Yeah. I taught them. Professor Lupin taught me in third year, when all the Dementors were at Hogwarts and I kept being affected by them."
As he passed Malfoy’s desk, something made him stop.
“Yeah. She’s got class tomorrow morning.”
"Ginny, please…" he said, not sure where he was going with this.
They paused for a moment, both surprised by the mutual understanding they had reached. Then Harry caught himself, and continued to attach his bag to his broomstick.
“I love you too, dumbass.” She pulled him in for a hug. Leo jumped up on the couch, barking happily and trying to lick their faces.
Harry thought,
"I know, kid. I know."
Harry looked over at Malfoy.
To his surprise, Malfoy let out a snort of laughter. Harry turned around in surprise.
Hermione gave a weak smile. “Thinking about Ginny?”
She shook her head. “No. I asked Dean, and apparently he’s just stayed in his room since it happened.”
She was lying on the bed, eyes closed. Her body was wrapped up in bandages around her torso and right arm, and there was some kind of drip going into her arm.
, but Draco pulled out his wand and pointed it at Lucius.
“I love you too, Hermione.”
Neville sat next to him, and Seamus on the other sofa.
“I’ve got to go to work,” he said, jumping up and grabbing his clothes. “Thanks for letting me crash here, Blaise, I’ll see you sometime soon.” Draco pulled on his clothes from the previous night, cursing himself for not having anything more work-appropriate.
"No, it's okay. I mean… yeah." Harry shrugged. "I know about how much of an asshole he and Sirius were to Snape."
He broke.
“Are you rested?” Robards asked, and then without waiting for a response, “Good. Now, we’ve prepared the Veritaserum, so the trial is nearly over. Come on.”
“Yes, yes, I’m, fine - don’t worry about me,” she said, the smile forcing its way even further up her cheeks.
She rolled her eyes. She was holding black lipstick in one hand and eyeliner in the other.
Amyra sighed, and stirred her tea. "Like I said when you first visited, I was in Slytherin."
“Who- Draco?”
Harry nodded.
“No, it’s not!” Potter shouted, making Draco jump. “We’re in the middle of a
Robards nodded curtly. “Alright, thank you, Rex. I’m sorry to have bothered you with all this. I just have one more question - can you think of anyone who could have been involved in this?”
Pansy laughed. “Yeah, thought so.”
Draco stared at Robards. “This is bullshit. I don’t even know how I’m supposed to have helped her escape. You can use Veritaserum on me, my answer won't change.” He felt his heartbeat speeding up. This was insane, there was no way they could prosecute him for this-
His first instinct was to be cold and distant towards Potter, but that was probably a bad idea - if he closed himself off, it would only make Robards more suspicious. Besides, he had nothing to hide, anyway. The smart thing to do would be to become even closer to Potter, and make sure he knew that Draco wasn’t hiding anything.
He had been paired with Potter.
"Potter?" Harry turned around, and saw Draco walking towards him.
Harry nodded, and got up, following her back to her bedroom.
Malfoy shook his head. “Why? Why would you tell him that?”
She sighed. "Yeah, that's what I thought. Bye, Harry. I'll see you."
“Sorry! I- I was just thinking, I zoned out.” She smiled, but it felt forced.
“Wait here, I’ll be right back,” Potter said, and he ran inside. A few moments later, he sat back down, holding a small jar. “This is Hermione’s signature move,” he grinned, and pulled out his wand, muttering something and tapping the jar. A bright blue flame erupted inside it, and he quickly put the lid on. Draco immediately felt warmth spread throughout his body.
"Where are you even going to stay? It's not like Azkaban's got lodgings outside."
“But the house-”
“Well,” Harry said, “now we have to do the hard part.”
“I don’t know, embarrass yourself in front of one of the richest families in Britain by having your buttons done wrong, I suppose.” She finished redoing his buttons, and stepped away. “There. Perfect.”
“What?”
she said, shoving Draco in his direction.
“Well- I don’t- I didn’t think that far.” Harry looked away from Andromeda and Hermione.
Hermione was not so easy to fool.
Merlin, he didn’t even know if Potter was queer, he’d only dated girls as far as Draco knew - but Potter had just been a childhood crush-
“Oh, hi Hermione,” he said, making her jump.
A large, shaggy dog bounded into the room and collided with Draco. He yelped, and was pushed onto the floor by the dog, which proceeded to lick his face.
Draco walked over and took it from him. “This looks promising.” He walked over to a smaller cabinet in the corner of the room. “This is locked.”
Malfoy jumped at Harry’s voice, looked at him, and then looked away. He looked pale. After a few seconds, he said, “Why do you think they let me be an auror, Potter?”
“Yeah. First one we found.”
Harry turned suddenly and let his knuckle hit the wall, almost surprising himself with it. A nurse who had been walking past jumped and turned to look at him before hurriedly continuing on her way.
"I love you too. Goodbye."
"I have to go. I have to…" Harry disapparated, and suddenly he was outside the Burrow again, in the garden, but his head was splitting open in agony, his scar, his scar-
attacks on muggles recently. We can’t disclose too much information, but it seems to the Ministry that there is a possibility that these attacks are being performed by some ex-Death Eaters, or copycats. We’re going round to all known offenders to try and figure out who might be behind them.”
“Potter, you have to understand - it’s not that I don’t trust your judgement, it’s that I have to be careful. For example, if there’s nothing suspicious going on, would you care to explain why the caretaker of Azkaban informed me that there were spells cast in Lucius Malfoy’s cell?”
Pansy nodded. “Right. I’ll just… stay here and wait, and contact Blaise.”
Pansy especially seemed to be regretting her suggestion, but gulped, and knocked on the door.
"What you said wasn't true though, was it?"
“Also, you need to get better luck with guys.”
“Oh, he didn’t… he didn’t tell you…”
“Still waiting for Hannah Abbott,” someone said.
“And hey, it’s not all bad. Hermione’s been begging me and Ron to move out for ages, because it’s important to be independent or something. At least she’ll get off our backs.”
The whole room was framed around the huge, ornate chandelier hanging from the middle of the ceiling. Directly underneath it on the floor was a large circular rug, with runes woven into the patterns.
Robards sighed, and shook his head. “Well, there’s no time. As you heard from the patronus message, there’s been a murder. One of us, and one muggle. It’s one of the people we were investigating about the Muggle killings.” Draco felt something cold wash over him. “Rexell and Max Parkinson.”
I start to relax. The cloak isn't kept in plain sight. It's usually kept in the closet of the room. Draco would know where it was, but not someone like Crabbe. I don't even think Crabbe would recognize the cloak for what it is. That means Draco took it. That means if Crabbe did take him, he has a way to hide. Or it means Draco and Lucius chose to take a walk.
Harry cursed under his breath. Somehow, Draco speaking French was making him
Happy birthday Lydia! I love you so much and I'm sad this story is over, but I have loved this journey.
"Mm?"
"Aoife, can you call Julianna in to cover my shift?"
"She didn't hate it," Ginny says firmly. "She hated the people saying awful things about you."
"Surely, there's some way out of this? We're still in school! Harry's too young to be married!" Ron said desperately.
"The Dark Lord would never hurt our family! We are loyal!"
"Yeah, it's more likely he caught wind of Anthony coming here. Harry said Elliot was getting tired of that." Ron claps a hand to my shoulder.
"How bad is my heart?"
To my surprise, Potter tugs on my hand. He pulls me forward, straight into his arms. I end up in his lap. I'm too stunned that Harry Potter is embracing me to struggle. His fingers are in my hair, pressing my face into his neck.
"Never mind that," Harry said impatiently. "Read it. Hermione found it."
With a start, he shook his head and stood up, holding his note.
"Is it him? Is it Harry Potter?" Lucius demanded.
"Anthony sneaked in here with Harry's cloak. He started shouting about Harry cheating on him with Draco. Anthony raised his fist and Draco tackled him and broke his nose," Ron hurriedly explains.
Waving her wand, Narcissa lights up the room. She cups Draco's face in her hands and looks him over worriedly, but I'm only half paying attention to them. That smog I thought was covering the moon is here too. In the light, it almost looks like a sepia photograph.
With a muffled sob, the girl lets him take off her robes and blouse. Really, the damage isn't as bad as when I used that curse against Draco. There is only one cut. It's deep and long, starting just under her training bra and going to her left hip, but it's not enough to kill her if she gets treatment.
Harry raises his eyebrow at me and I suddenly remember why he showed me his memories. My mouth falls open a little.
"Luna..."
"That would be me, actually," Hermione says curtly, coming into the room. "Harry and I trained together. He's very efficient at his job."
"How do I stop it? How can I make it go away so I can be brave enough to do this?"
"Harry..."
"It's okay to let the veela part of you take control," Harry said suddenly.
"No, I'm not doing that ever."
After tying my hair back, Luna drapes her arms over my shoulders. I let myself breathe, considering her words. Logically, I know she's right.
I almost stop in the middle of the hall, but Luna is pulling me forward. "That works?"
"Episkey! Use... epis-" Malfoy hissed through clenched teeth, but he couldn't finish the sentence. It looked like it was all he could do to stay conscious.
"Oh?"
Harry's fingers run through my hair. I think he's growing obsessed with it. He's always petting me. I quite like it. It's soothing.
"I think… I'm ready." Draco stands. If it wasn't for the slight tremor in his jaw, I wouldn't be able to tell we're about to face his worst memories. The petrified wood Narcissa gave him is clutched in his hand.
"What do you mean?"
"Are you sure it was really Malfoy?"
"Try to eat something, little dragon," I say, trying to keep a straight face, and kiss his forehead.
"If you mean Narcissa, she is here. She's with Harry and Lucius in the study. They both arrived a few minutes ago," Hermione says as she finishes a spell.
He threw on his cloak and walked quickly, guessing he could cut him off on the stairs to the seventh floor. He took a shortcut, but Malfoy must have quickened his pace because Harry just managed to catch his arm before he disappeared into the room of requirement.
Harry had found Ron in their dorm and had quickly filled him in on the situation. Ron, of course, was more concerned with the blood and water soaking Harry through. He made Harry stay still so he could heal his hand while Harry told him everything.
Molly's staring at me too. I can't tell if it's  apprehension or amusement I see on her face. In any case, she's biting her lip and fidgeting.
All that mattered was Malfoy kissing him. Harry's brain short-circuited as Malfoy nipped his lower lip. Harry pressed into the kiss and was rewarded by Malfoy's mouth opening. His tongue slid into his mouth, brushing against Harry's.
I cut him off with a kiss, pushing him back to lay beneath me. Draco's fingers find my pants and pull them down my hips. He wrenches his lips from mine to look down.
Draco twists just enough to kiss me as much as he can in this position, our tongues tangling together messily until he tenses in my arms and cries my name hoarsely. Ribbons of white paint his desk. I have to wrap an arm around his chest to support him as he goes limp.
We break apart and look at the door. Lucius is standing there. He looks stunned. Draco tenses in my arms. For a long moment, no one says anything.
"Mother and I are living in France. Mother lives in a chateau. I have a cottage. We are quite happy with the arrangement."
I glance down and see Draco has been clutching at Blaise's hand. As I watch, he loosens his grip, taking steadying breaths. He murmurs an apology that Blaise waves off.
"That is obvious." Hermione rolled her eyes. "If Snape or any other death eater finds out that you're his mate, it will put him at risk. You-know-Who would think he's not trustworthy because of his feelings for you. He could be killed."
"Exhausted, but better. I don't feel like a constant panic is threatening to grip me." Draco pulls me closer to his chest. "Did it work?"
Two Hufflepuffs, two Gryffindors, a Ravenclaw, and a Slytherin. The Slytherin is only a first year. All of them look young, but obedient. The head girl steps forward, her hazel eyes narrowed.
"Ron, everyone is pairing up. You guys are all getting married. All of my friends are. I... I don't want to be alone." My voice cracks.
"How can you be so calm about it? I almost got you killed!"
Potter would probably kill me if I tried kissing him.
"I can't meditate right now. I can't think of anything besides Potter. Luna... I need to see him. I have to know if he really was trying to kiss me." I run my fingers through my hair irritably.
"Hermione explained DAISIES. That's an impressive piece of magic... and I'm grateful Anthony can't harm you again or stalk you."
His fingers tangle in my hair as his body starts shaking under me. I recognize the signs and redouble my efforts. I want to feel him spill into my mouth. I want to taste the salty bitterness of his come.
"Bella. I can't imagine why you would be happy to see me." Snape's voice is cold. "What do you want?"
"Does it feel that good?" he teased, wrapping his arms around Draco's shoulders.
"Shut up, scar face!" I shout, tangling my fingers into my hair.
Harry was going to go mad with need.
The voices are coming from the hallway. I'm still fighting off drowsiness. I'm pretty sure I didn't hear that correctly. My father isn't supposed to come home for a few more weeks. Still, his voice rings out.
Harry tells me that all of this happened slowly. Harry didn't notice the changes at first... and then Harry started blaming himself for Goldstein's actions. He tells me how Goldstein kept him down. How he would tell Harry no one would put up with Harry besides him.
"Draco, she is okay. She's at the chateau in Bourbonnais. No one is going to hurt her after she saved Potter's life." She must see me frown, because she adds quickly, "Draco, we're supposed to go to Luna's wedding. You are her best man."
The door creaks open and I reluctantly tear my lips away from his to look at the intruder. It's Luna. She doesn't look surprised to see me on top of Draco.
Also, I'm terrible at smut, but I did my best for you, Lydia! I hope you enjoy it! ♡♡♡
Ginny's mouth falls open. That should be funny because it’s rare that I stun Ginny into silence. Instead, I'm getting angry too.
My mind is still on the article and I almost miss Blaise howling with laughter while Draco splutters.
"I need to go. I have to make sure my mother is alright." I start to stand up, but Pansy grabs my arm.
He presses his lips to mine, but I break the kiss immediately. I glance at the mirror nervously. "I know this is just a memory, but it feels weird to kiss in front of your parents."
Draco brushed Harry's hair back. He pressed his lips to his forehead. Harry could feel the love pouring out of Draco into him. He hadn't thought it was possible for someone to love him that much. The majority of his life, Harry had been surrounded by people who hated him. He had never been loved in the Dursley's home. At Hogwarts, he had Ron and Hermione… he had the Weasleys… but they didn't love him like
A hand flies up to the back of my neck, holding me in place as Draco's tongue presses into my mouth. I brush against it with mine eagerly. I could kiss this man for hours and still not be satisfied. Hell, I want to kiss him for the rest of my life.
Every objection and question died in Harry's throat as Malfoy's lips touched his.
Ginny tilts her head curiously. "Yes…"
I sit down in front of him. I actually feel a little sorry for him. Draco looks devastated. I suppose I can tell him a bit about Anthony. Harry will have to do most of it later.
My body moved before I could think. I let the bee climb onto my finger. Malfoy's skin was soft under my touch. I wanted to touch him again. Being with him in that clearing, surrounded by wildflowers, trees, and bees, felt like we were the only two people in the world.
Luna smiles against my palm and nods complacently. Ginny frowns and sets the tray on one of the desks.
She summons three vials. Draco's complexion improves with every potion. Hermione casts one last spell before checking his vitals.
"I learned about veela from my grandmother, Harry. She was very adamant that I know what to expect if I came into my veela heritage."
So deep in his thoughts and still absentmindedly scenting the note, Harry was pulled back to the present by Hermione’s groan.
The snake emerges from beneath the duvet, popping up right next to the sleeping Draco's face. He blinks awake as Nagini opens her mouth and hisses. Flailing backwards, Draco screams, an absolutely terrified sound.
I kiss the top of his head tenderly, running my hands up and down his back. After a long moment, he hugs me.
"No! You can go sleep somewhere else tonight, because you
"I can't believe Harry didn't tell me he was seeing someone," I whisper, feeling my eyes burn.
Harry kisses the top of my head. "Don't worry. We'll keep you and your parents safe."
Immediately, I carefully school my features into something resembling indifference. At least, I hope I do. Rage is pulsing through my veins at the thought of Harry's family treating him like this.
Harry automatically leaned toward Draco, feeling like he was drawing him in. Draco pressed Harry's shoulders into the wall.
Draco harrumphs. I stroke his hair. He relaxes. I think he likes his hair played with. I start humming absentmindedly.
I stop and stare at him coolly. "Someone just tried to kill your son."
Harry couldn't quite believe it when he looked up into grey eyes. It wasn't ideal. He was kneeling in Malfoy Manor with death eaters surrounding him… but Draco was there.
I summon fresh clothes for him, ignoring the devious smile on Pansy's lips.
"Why...?"
Draco frowned, but started reading. When he was finished, he met Harry's gaze.
"I didn't mean to worry you," Draco said, his voice unsure. "I just need to be on perfect behavior. One little slip will be enough to send me to Azkaban, even with the testimony of the Boy Who Lived Twice. I'm trying to keep a low profile and be a model student. Before today… before McGonagall’s
"Relax, mate, it's not like you slept with him," Ron jokes.
Potter looks at me like he's never seen me before. I break eye contact and stand up. I need to gather my things. I hear Minty offering Potter tea as I walk out the back door. There's a workshop almost the size of the cottage back here.
Well, not all of it. We really
"Are you really okay?" Harry asks, searching my face.
"I'm reconsidering. I don't know what I'll do, but I'm trying."
But he asked me to hurry up. I quickly unbutton his trousers and spin him around. Draco immediately shoves his trousers and pants down to his knees and bends forward, bracing himself on the desk.
Draco stares at his arm for a long while, quiet, silent tears still running down his cheeks now and then. Just as I’m about to say something, he seems to come back to the moment. Taking a deep breath, he climbs off my lap and stands up, wiping his eyes. "I'm going to go clean up. I need a moment alone."
"Narcissa sent me," she announces, setting the tray filled with soft cheeses, grapes, and bread on the desk.
I blink. Harry never told Draco about Anthony?
Blood rushes in my ears.
I force myself to breathe and take my time answering myself. If I were alone, no. I wouldn't be able to do it. I'm a coward… but I won't be alone.
"Seriously? No one would send
I listen to Harry eat as I watch the vial. It's hard to believe he's trusting me to see him vulnerable in his memories. I'm almost scared to see the things that hurt him. The Dark Lord is certain to play a part in it.
"Yeah… and you were a snot when we were kids." Harry gives me a smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes.
I'm only half paying attention to her now. I understand what she is saying, but my eyes are fixed on Harry until he enters the building.
"Draco, what are you doing," my father asks in alarm.
Draco carefully helps her put on her blouse again. She immediately buries herself in his chest, clearly needing comfort. He manages to free his arm and conjures a parchment and quill. After scribbling a letter, he folds the parchment as flat as possible.
It's also fair that Draco wants to hear all of this from Harry. Really, this Harry's personal life. He should be here to explain the situation himself.
Harry wrapped his legs around his mate’s waist and rolled his hips, pushing Draco further in. Draco inhaled sharply, burying his face in Harry's neck.
"What?" I stare at him, feeling my stomach drop.
I slowly get up from the floor and move to the sink. I wash my face and brush my teeth methodically. When I'm finished, I walk back to my armchair and curl up under my blanket. I can't really process this right now.
I would tell her to go now, but Minty hates the chateau. It reminds her of Malfoy Manor. That's why I brought her here with me.
. There are two pictures side by side. One is of Harry in his lime green healer robes, entering the hospital. The other is of me at my trial years ago. I'm sitting chained to a chair, looking scared and pathetic. The dark mark, before Luna's flower tattoos, is on full display.
I curl up under my blanket, ignoring him. We stay in a weird awkward silence for a few moments, but then he speaks again.
"So why would seeing your memories make me love you any less?"
"Yes. They're both determined to find out who attacked you." Molly runs her fingers through her hair. "Eat. You need nutrition."
"It's fine," I say hoarsely. My throat feels raw.
"Harry, tap your wand on the parchment."
Harry's eyes soften after a moment. "I understand, I think."
"Thank you for the flowers, Dudders," she coos.
I'm tempted to snap at him, but I crush the impulse. "I'm a wandmaker."
I force myself to focus on my breathing. Four seconds inhaling. Four seconds holding. Four seconds exhaling. Four seconds holding. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
I take Draco's face in my hands, brushing off the blood with my thumb. I'm shaking, but I hide it. I'm so angry.
She turns to me, smiling faintly. It doesn't match the worry in her eyes. Sitting next to me, she rests her head on my shoulder. "Are you really planning on dying rather than being healed?"
The smile was instantly wiped off of his face and Harry stared at Malfoy in sudden outrage, but didn't have time to formulate a response.
"It's a tricky procedure. It's also a last resort. Any kind of magic that involves transfiguration and organs is risky."
"Nothing. I'll be completely fine." While I know he's lying, Draco's voice sounds confident enough that Faye reluctantly lets Ginny pick her up.
"If you want me there, I'll stay by your side and help you heal those hurts," I tell him after a moment of silence.
I don't have any clean clothes, so I charm my dirty clothes clean and pull them back on. For a moment, I wonder why I'm bothering with clothes at all, but I'm already wearing them. Taking one glance in the mirror, I leave the bathroom.
"You're using my first name..." he mumbles after a moment.
"Go on, get back in your hive. Time to sleep," I say, carefully brushing them off one by one.
Harry completely forgot what he had said to Ron about not coming here to profess his undying love. Forgot they were still teens. Forgot he should be at least trying to take this slow.
I watch my face blanch even as I raise my wand unsteadily.
A moan escapes his throat as I drag my teeth lightly over his tongue. He breaks the kiss, panting hard against my lips.
"Yes."
The door opens gently and a figure steps in. I assume it's my healer. I hear him cast the wand lighting charm.
I walk out of the bedroom, dressed in my pajama bottoms and one of Anthony's shirts. My hair is a mess like usual, but at least I'm clean. I have eleven hours until my next shift.
"You were a little shit, yeah… but you regret it now and I know you've tried to make amends for it. You're not the same person you were when you were a kid."
So can it be said that – even after this short a time – this relationship is already heading into a very serious direction?
The bite on Draco's neck was healed. The mark was still there, but it looked like an old scar. It looked like how Hermione had described the mark on his neck.
"Tell me the rest." I put my mug down and grab Harry's other hand.
"I didn't say-"
Yes, exactly.
I open my arms to him, a silent invitation for comfort. It takes him a long moment to unfurl his long limbs and crawl back to me.
"Alright…"
The scent of his fated mate.
I am safe. The Dark Lord is dead. He can't hurt me anymore.
"What's so wrong with that? It sounds like you like him." Hermione tugs me down to sit next to her.
"My shift is starting in a few minutes. I have to go, but I'll be back to check on you in an hour or so." Hermione squeezes Ron's shoulder and leaves.
The door finally opens and Draco steps out, wearing sweatpants and a loose shirt. Fresh from the shower, he looks better than I've seen him in years. His long hair is still wet, but he has his wand out and is drying it.
Draco nearly stumbled and tore his lips from Harry's to curse. Harry grinned. Draco was glowing again. His skin was pearlescent, inhuman, but so beautiful.
"What are you doing?" I ask, approaching the mirror.
"Crabbe," Draco choked, his eyes watering.
Draco lifts his head. He seems mildly exasperated. "And how are you planning on doing that?"
you are!"
"Draco, I love you. I'm not going to force you to do this, but I want you to know that nothing in your past is going to make me love you any less."
Harry tells me that not long after the howlers, Goldstein grew possessive. He guilted Harry into not seeing his friends and family. He called Harry selfish for being bi and believed Harry liking girls was just a phase. Then, he would turn around and say that Harry was going to cheat on him because he would start missing vaginas.
"Wormtail, you're certain of what you heard, correct?"
I stare at the spot where the mark was, resisting the urge to touch it. It's impossible for it to be gone - no one has ever managed to remove it before. But there is no trace of anything ever being tattooed on his skin.
"Ah... you mean when we almost kissed and I got stung?" Harry asks, his face flushing.
It's small. I have to crouch to fit. Harry is cowering in a corner on a cot. Horrified, I realize this is where Harry sleeps. A five-year-old boy is sleeping in a fucking cupboard.  A hand grasps mine and gently tugs.
Needing to breathe so he could sigh forlornly, Harry turned his face to the side. Right then, the door opened. Harry steadfastly ignored it, pretending to be asleep. He didn't want to talk to anyone right now. Footsteps approached his bed and when they reached him, the person sat down. Curtains rustled as they closed around them.
"Four in the morning.... Was it another nightmare about...
"If they hadn't, they should've," I mumble.
Credit to noxsoulmate for writing the article! She is a godsend I swear.
I glare at her. It's going to be impossible to clear my mind now. Still, I sink into position as well. There's a basking shark not far from us. I look away from it.
"Draco," my father finally says, interrupting my internal struggle, "we need to talk. Potter, leave us."
His mate looked terrified. He was too far for Harry to touch, but Harry's hand reached toward Draco without thinking. A silent gesture.
"I promise."
"Yes. Right after that whole mess with Umbridge."
Draco, apparently, did not have the same fears I did. I still can't believe he broke Anthony's nose. Thank magic Ron's spell went over Draco's head. It hit a vase of daffodils and shattered it.
I curl up in the chair I'm sitting in, tugging my blanket tighter around me.
While they shared bathrooms, the dorms between alphas, betas, and omegas were still divided. Since Pan, Harry, and Michael were the only omega boys, they had a pretty nice space all to themselves - but on the downside, it meant no getting close to any alphas. Especially not one who was actively avoiding him.
My eyes fall to his hands. One is on the bed next to me, as if he had been holding my hand. The other… is holding a small green velvet box. It's open, but facing Harry. I tilt my head enough to peek inside. It's a ring with an emerald surrounded by diamonds.
"Are you doing alright?" Draco asked, his voice strained.
"No roughhousing," Potter says, walking back in the room with my father trailing behind him.
Something feels wrong. I can't put my finger on what, but George and Arthur are already on their feet.
"Let's do it that way next time," he breathed.
Anthony grabs my arm. "This isn't over."
"You probably can't keep me safe anyways..." he grumbled under his breath. "But you are still a death eater."
"Mm, so do I." Draco's eyes twinkle with mischief. "You know… we have about forty minutes left before the girls wake up."
Yoga on land was frustrating for me. I couldn't bend my body the way Luna could. Eventually, Luna suggested we try yoga underwater, where I was already calm and wouldn't have gravity working against me.
After I take the second potion, I eat an early breakfast with my mother. She's still worried, I can tell, but she doesn't say anything. She goes out into the garden when breakfast is over and starts cutting flowers. I don't know the names of all of the flowers. They're all gold and mother of pearl. She makes two bouquets, the irises at the center of them.
Every time he was about to burst, the spell forced his orgasm back and it took less time to build the orgasm back up. He was certain when Draco lifted the spell, the orgasm would kill him - or, at least, knock him out.
We break the surface of the water and the bubbles around our mouths pop. I take a deep breath of the salty air as we wade the rest of the way to shore.
"No, but my actions at school were my responsibility. I wanted Hermione to be killed. I taunted other kids who might have been targeted." Draco's lips tighten to a hard line.
A grimace crosses over his face. "Let's evaluate that at a later date. I can't even think of what the least horrible memory is right now."
Kingsley looks flabbergasted. I've never seen Kingsley at a loss. I didn't think it was possible even.
I don't answer. Nothing I could say would appease him. I had simply loved Luna already by then. She was the one good thing in my life at that time. I wasn't able to force myself to hurt her.
I'm not a fool. I know Potter will never have feelings for me. Still... he called me fit and winked at me. I wonder how much of that was him 'rolling with Weasley's joke'.
"Uh... well, I'm not sure. I think he just needs love and support. Hermione usually says that." I rub the back of my neck.
Harry lifted the parchment to his nose and inhaled deeply. A scent like apple pie and broom polish filled his senses. It was a scent that he was familiar with - but only since eighth year, which meant it couldn’t be any Gryffindor. More precisely, he knew he smelled it every morning in the bathroom. No matter how early Harry woke up, someone had always been in there before him, leaving steam and that peculiar aroma behind.
"I don't know yet. Minty, if you see anyone suspicious, I want you to go to my mother's immediately. Don't worry about anything else. That's an order."
I hold back a sigh and start pulling on my clothes and shoes. "I promise I won't go anywhere a Death Eater might find me."
Draco pulled his foreskin down and swirled his tongue around his head. Harry cursed, tugging on his blond hair.
Draco's eyes darken as he pushes me back on the bed, pinning my hands next to my head again. Looks like he is impatient to continue our earlier plans…
The snake stops, turning its head toward me. Ginny is hot on my heels and pulls her wand out of her gold and white dress robes. She vanishes the snake and looks murderously around the room. I don't have time to try to figure out who conjured the snake.
Then I'll go to the chateau and talk to Malfoy.
"Thanks." Ginny grins.
Luna is staring at me expectantly. I roll my eyes, but try to meditate. Unfortunately, the only thing my mind wants to focus on is Potter. It's so annoying. I wish I could hate him, but it's impossible. I've tried.
"I actually have a theory about that, but you're not going to like it."
"This has to violate so many ethical rules at the hospital," she continues, "but it's honestly about damn time."
"You heard me. I don't want to be treated by someone who is incompetent." I fold my arms.
I know from experience the easiest and fastest way to get George to stop teasing is to roll with it. He delights in people reacting to him. Which is fine, but Malfoy is my patient. I don't think he needs to be teased right now.
"Did you try the manor?" Her voice is dripping with sarcasm.
I'm not expecting it when he moves suddenly. His face fills my vision as his lips press against mine awkwardly. The shock only lasts a moment. I cup his jaw in my hand and move my lips tenderly against his.
"There you have it. If my family was being threatened... I actually think I would have done the same thing you did. I don't think I would have been able to live with myself if my parents were killed because of a choice I made."
"Harry is going to show me his memories… he's hoping it will show me that it won't change his feelings when he sees mine." I exhale slowly. "I'm scared, Luna."
Malfoy's jaw works. I can see a blush rising on his face. "Will you shut up?"
I hold back a sigh. "I will. Don't worry about him."
"Yes. It really does take a village to raise a baby." She doesn't look too put out by it. Honestly, I think Hermoine is a super human or something. She works, helps with Victoire, and manages to be in a healthy relationship with Ron all at once. "Narcissa is insisting someone go with him. Parkinson has disappeared and everyone else is busy."
"You will lift it?" Harry groaned as Draco took one of his balls in his mouth and sucked gently.
"Yes, of course. That is a great idea." Hermione beams. "I'm glad you're taking that step."
"No. I'm just going to rest with Draco until Bill gets here," I answer, poking my head over the railing that lines the loft.
I spring out of the chair and rush to the loo. I haven't eaten much today. It's all stomach acid. It burns my throat and nose.
"Bold of you to assume that it's not there already," I say huskily.
"I'm serious. If you're going to be intimate with Harry, at least ask Hermione how to do so safely."
"I recognize that look on your face. I'm not trying to attack Harry or anything of the kind. I'm not calling him a liar. I... really care about him, but Goldstein just burst into my room. I need to know that we're both safe. I wouldn't put it passed Goldstein to curse Harry or me right now... and I need to hear what you just told me from Harry himself." He looks down again.
"I'm going to kill him," I growl. I am ready to break up with Anthony right now, loneliness be damned.
Pressing a second finger inside, I gasp quietly. It's been awhile since I've had sex, but I know my body well enough to know how to ease the slight sting of the stretch. I wrap my free hand around my cock, focusing on that until the burn fades.
"It is. You're free of him."
I wonder why Draco isn't unlocking the door and bringing the kids somewhere else, but then I realize that he's only one person. If he tries to help all these kids by himself, he is likely to get caught.
"Anything else?"
"I did not have a panic attack," I hiss indignantly. This is humiliating. Of course it had to be perfect Potter coming to my rescue.
"What is it?"
Ron rubs the back of his neck and sits on the floor in front of me. "Harry... I don't think Anthony is the right person for you."
"I don't know. I'm hoping Luna and Narcissa can tell me. Or Zabini and Parkinson."
I understand his hesitation. This whole week has been a huge change for us. It's normal to be conflicted and confused in situations like this. I know that I certainly feel a little weird. I just broke up with Anthony yesterday. I don't really want to rush into this.
"This curse sounds poetic," my aunt's voice says, sounding a little dreamy. "It will kill him by preying on his heart. And we get to torture him like the little traitor deserves."
"You're being a selfish prick! Have you considered how you
She throws the lily in the bin and grabs Harry's arm, dragging him through the hall roughly.
"After, but it was the day after I left him." Harry looks uncomfortable.
"Hey, Minty. We can't stay long. We just wanted to know if you've seen Draco." Ginny kneels in front of Minty.
"How bad is it?" I ask, turning to glare at the paper in Ginny's hands.
"Yes. It seems a bit soon to say it... but yes. I meant it. I do love you," he says gently.
Harry didn't have time to enjoy the kiss for long. Malfoy lips moved from his to kiss a trail down to his neck. Harry felt dizzy with how badly he wanted Malfoy.
"You could have just said you liked me." Harry rolled his eyes. "Why did you get me in trouble with Snape?"
She doesn't give me a chance to respond. She grabs my robes and starts shaking me so hard my glasses nearly fall off. Ginny grabs her arm seconds later and forces her to let go of me.
I have to use a spell to administer it so I don't wake him. Everyone is being too noisy and there's not enough space in this room for them. Malfoy is stirring.
Releasing my hand, Draco takes a few steps towards Nagini. The snake swings her head around, almost like she is actually here. That isn't possible. She can't really be here. This is a memory. A cursed memory.
"Don't worry." I grin. "I thoroughly enjoyed that."
Draco's eyes are glued to the snake. Nagini isn't moving to strike him. She's just watching him.
I let him take the offending garment off, hiding my grin. It's just so cute to see him this eager and I am happy to be here with him.
"What... what are you doing?" Potter asks, gaping at me.
Harry dragged Hermione into an unused classroom and locked the door behind them. He cast
It's my best guess. The curse takes hold of Draco's heart when he panics and I have seen firsthand how he reacts to snakes. I think it has to do with specific things - like a snake, or more precisely, like Nagini. This memory seems to focus on her. If Draco can break the power she has over him, he might free himself from the dark hold this memory has over him.

Kreacher blinks up at me. He looks at a loss for words. I have a feeling he's wondering if he should voice approval or not. Malfoy is part Black after all.
"I remember when Aunt Bella gave me the potion. She told me it was whiskey. It made me sick, but I didn't think anything of it at the time. I just thought I couldn't handle my alcohol." I hold the petrified wood against my chest. "I slept the rest of the day. When I woke up… I think I know what the next memory is."
I raise an eyebrow and gesture for him to go on. He seems to be struggling to speak. Instead of words, a small frustrated noise comes out of his mouth.
"I need you to do me a big favor, Kreacher. I need all the books on curses you can find. Ones that can cause issues like heart problems. Do you think there's a book like that at home?"
"Anthony, I'm exhausted. I don't want to have sex right now," Harry mutters from the bed.
He reluctantly taps the paper with his wand. The shimmering turns orange. Kingsley waves his wand over it and it returns to looking like a normal piece of parchment.
"Hey, Dray." Pansy grins almost evilly.
"The Dark Lord spent a lot of time torturing me," I force out. "Every small mistake was met with Cruciatus curse. He kept threatening to kill my parents and make me watch."
"Of course." Voldemort inclines his head. "Maybe you want to share with Nagini instead?"
"Granger or Pomfrey would have been more competent." Malfoy pulled out his wand and traced it over the red scar.
Someone's hand wraps around my wrist. They guide me back to my room. I follow numbly. They make me sit in one of the chairs gently. I look up into worried dark eyes.
"Yes."
I catch his meaning. He doesn't want me to go to Anthony's. I can handle that. I don't want to see him anyways. I might hex him.
"Your scars... It was my fault. I'm sorry," I mumble. I might throw up.
I look at my hand. It's covered in blood. I split the skin on my knuckles. Ron casts
"Before you start talking about using Harry to clear our name, I'm going to stop you now. I'm not with him to use him. At all. No one will use him," I say firmly, folding my arms.
"You don't understand. My whole childhood I was alone. I never had affection. I never had anyone. Making friends and finding a family at Hogwarts was brilliant, but then I lost people. I lost Sirius. I lost Remus. I lost Dumbledore." I swallow. "Anthony isn't great, but isn't he better than lonely nights at my house?"
"I am so sorry! I didn't know what that spell did!"
"Goldstein, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. You can either willingly place your magical signature on the parchment or I can call another auror in here to babysit you until you do."
"But… that woman?"
"Yes. I raise bees and make wands there."
He knelt beside Draco. Harry looked down.
I don't know why he does that. I am as lost as he is. The way Hermione phrased it, it sounds like an acronym, but I can't even begin to guess what it is.
With a wave of his wand, we're in a new memory. I half expect Harry to show me memories of us, but none of them are. Instead it's memories of Hagrid, Lupin, Black, and his friends mostly. There's a couple of Dumbledore as well.
Draco's hands grip my hips firmly as I sink down slowly. There's a soft wet noise as the head of his cock breaches me. I shiver, taking a moment to breathe.
"Yes, we ta-"
"You're right. I should be working instead of squabbling." Potter looks like his prayer for patience wasn't answered.
It would have been nice to shower, but Harry needed to talk this through and understand what had happened. Instead, he used a cleaning spell and changed into clean clothes as he talked.
"I'll be fine in the library… and Harry was my healer before we started dating… so I think I'll be okay."
"Harry, I don't have time to talk right now," Anthony snaps, polishing the handle of his Silver Arrow.
(See the end of the chapter for
I really love being underwater like this. It feels secluded. There's no one here to judge me. The marine life is interesting to watch as well.
Draco continues to stare at his lap for a long time without speaking. When he finally does open his mouth, I'm surprised at the question.
I carefully do as I'm told and Draco turns to face me. He gives me a wink and drops to his knees. Taking my cock into his mouth, his eyes flutter closed.
Harry felt like his heart had stopped beating. He couldn't imagine Draco dying.
Draco bites and sucks on my shoulder as his hand slips from my back to my cock, stroking me in time with each thrust. He feels so hot and thick inside of me. Jolts of fire lick up my skin, tightening a spring in my gut.
Harry is so adorably flustered, I decide to let up. "Why did my sister give you an engagement ring?"
When she asked me to be her best man at her wedding, I tried to refuse. I didn't want to cast any shadows on her special day. I was certain that people would be unnerved at seeing a former Death Eater in the wedding party. Luna was persistent though. She completely ignored my protests, carrying on as if I had said yes. Finally, I had to accept my fate. I love her and I won't ruin her wedding. I trust her judgement on this.
A hand touches my shoulder briefly. It's getting hard to breathe under the blanket. It's too hot. I don't reemerge until I hear the door open and close.
"I won't."
"Lucius was coming to visit you earlier, but Crabbe assaulted him. He locked him in a room and stole his hair... then he put the Imperius curse on Ron. Molly was at home and she's perfectly fine."
That had been... weird. It was stranger even than when I had first stopped by his room. He had been crying for his mother while Molly held him. It's really hard for me to associate crying with Malfoy... and then he was polite to Molly when he declined her offer of food? Like... really polite.
I move to the shelf nearest to the windows. Its filled with dusty books. They're all ancient and have been passed down in my family for generations.
"She is getting married to Luna! I haven't had feelings for Ginny since the war and vice versa!"
"I don't want anyone to see them," Draco mutters. "There has to be another way."
"Harry, it wouldn't matter to us if you did sleep with him or anything." Hermione is still glaring at Ron.
"Excuse me, but did you just call them-"
"You didn't have to do that, but thank you. Have there been any suspicious people lurking around?"
My father looks ready to protest, but I'm already pulling on the cloak. "Don't bother arguing. Just come with me."
Amycus stops him with a wave of his wand, looking annoyed by Draco's reluctance. The girl is still screaming, pleading for someone to help her.
Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, thank you for this interview.
Kreacher bows and leaves the kitchen. I watch him go. I miss living at my home. Sure, the portraits are annoying and I'm still finding traps and curses everywhere, but it's my home. Sirius left it to me.
There's silence between us for a moment. Ron is being quiet and I just don't know what to say. I still need to talk to Harry about Goldstein. I need to understand what is happening.
Deep cuts appeared on Malfoy's chest. He stumbled backwards, blood pouring freely from the wounds. He collapsed onto the waterlogged floor.
Care to elaborate?
It’s official then?
"He is so different to how I remember him..." I murmur, slumping in my chair.
"I'll… be fine… don't stop," Draco breathes in between kisses.
"Maybe it's because there are too many bad memories."
"Calm down, princess!" Weasley snaps. "We are guarding you from whoever the hell conjured that snake!"
The memory fades. I think I might be sick again. Harry strokes my hair. I think he's saying something, but I can't make it out. A warmth spreads through my chest as he casts a spell. My heart slows down and becomes steadier.
At least she helped me pull my leg behind my shoulder. I have doubts about my ability to get into this pose. It seems needlessly complex. Still, I give it my best shot.
It certainly is.
"Godsfuck." Ginny runs her hands over her face. "Just go. I'll tell George how to get through the wards and he'll join you… if he's not busy."
"It's been a while since I checked you over. Do you mind?" she asks, leaning against the desk.
"What?" I ask her, narrowing my eyes.
I broke his nose in sixth year. I pretended to be a dementor to scare him. I tormented him and his friends.
Harry has seen me weak. He's seen me as I was actively dying. He's seen my teenage years when I was a blood purist and a complete arsehole. He's seen me in humiliating situations. He's seen me as a Death Eater.
"That's fair." Luna laughs. "I can't cook at all. When we're home, all we eat is curry and toast."
So, Harry did. He told her about finding Malfoy crying in the bathroom. He told her about the fight and how he used
"Why not?"
"Tell us what happened," she deflects.
I glance up at him. His eyes are sparkling and his hand is covering his mouth. I wish it wasn't. I like his smile. He's never smiled at me before and I can't even enjoy it properly because his hand is in the way.
"That's another thing," Harry says as the memory falls away, his voice muffled in my shoulder. "Anthony always made me be the bottom. He said I was more feminine because I did the cooking and cleaning, so it was only right for him to top."
Hermione stands up. She pulls Ron into the room and gives him a meaningful look. "I'll finish the cooking. Ron. You promised."
"What does that mean exactly?" I ask, glancing out the window again.
Bill finally moves away enough to conjure a glass and water. He hands it to me. I nod my thanks and sip it gingerly.
"Your mother is safe. We used the fidelius charm on her place in France. Luna is the secret keeper. She's also staying with your mother to protect her." Granger glances at Weasley. "We don't have much proof. Just theories. The only thing we can think of is someone used the imperius curse on Fleur Weasley."
"I don't know if that's wise." Arthur glances at my father.
don't want to die.
Snape left with Malfoy as Harry stared after them in stunned anger. It was so unfair. Malfoy knew full well that he hadn't given him a lust potion... and he hadn't started that fight.
The broom felt like it was going to break into pieces with how hard it was shaking, but still Harry pushed it faster. He leaned down, flattening his body along the length of it.
I look down at Draco's sleeping face. Part of me wants to insist Narcissa go instead, but I can't bear to leave his side right now.
Harry smiled weakly.  "I thought..."
We're in the cellar this time. It's darker than it should be as if covered in a brown film. I recognize it as a cursed memory. Moreover, I know exactly what the trigger will be this time.
Truth be told, I really like her. She is a bit mad, but she was the first person to speak for me at my trial. I was still sent to Azkaban, but Luna protested the decision for hours. I strongly suspect she continued to badger the ministry until they let me go a few months later. I also just like her as a person. She is fun to be around.

He prayed to all the gods that Draco was still alive.
"We should move him to his cottage," Ginny says softly, breaking the silence. "He'll feel safer there and will be able to recover from the horrors he faced in the pensieve. Can we use the floo or apparate?"
"Not now, Molly," Potter murmurs, "I'm working."
"Thank you," I choke out.
I feel a rush of gratitude towards Kingsley for silencing him. Now, I'll be able to tell him my side without interruptions. I'm also a little grateful that Anthony needed to be charmed quiet. It strengthens my case against him.
I feel sick at the thought.
“It’s alright. It was good to talk. And dance.” She smiled.
She laughed. “Don’t worry, I don’t expect you to have a solution. It just helps to have someone to talk to.”
The lynx approached them, and stopped before revealing its message.
“And at the Battle of Hogwarts, at the final battle, I saw you helping our side.”
She was definitely a cat person.
Draco stared at Robards. He had been handcuffed to a chair in one of the smaller trial rooms in the Ministry, and left there alone for what felt like hours before Robards and Elarena finally came to speak to him.
“Oh, I don’t know…” Hermione bit her lip. Ron kept his arms folded, staring at her. “You know what? Fine. Let’s just go with this one.” She moved her eyes away from Ron.
“Not all of us have photographic fucking memory, Hermione.”
“Yeah. Thanks, Dean,” Harry said, smiling. He walked inside, into a living area. Two other people he recognised were sitting on the sofas - Seamus and Neville, both intently focused on a video game. “I got them into Mario Kart,” Dean said to Harry, still grinning, “haven’t been able to get them away since. Hey guys, look who it is!”
Now he had Hermione’s full attention.
Draco turned around, and walked out the cell.
Potter dived out the way, catching himself and spinning round.
“I’m not blaming you, don’t worry. It’s okay. Just an observation. You wanna order pizza?”
He sat down on his bed, the box on his lap. Potter was watching him from the doorway.
“The one with the hair that looks like he’s been struck by lightning. The way you looked at him when you were talking-”
“I haven’t forgotten, Pansy, but it seems our friend Draco has forgotten who exactly got all of our family members killed - or worse, put in Azkaban.”
"A cottage on the coast. Then we'll fly into Azkaban. You can't apparate, obviously."
“I swear she still has that time turner,” Ron muttered to Harry as Kingsley walked into the room.
Everyone stared at him.
They walked up a winding set of dilapidated stone stairs, and into a long passageway lined with cell doors.
Draco shook his head. "No. He's just going to…" he trailed off.
“Boys, what-”
“He seems to be fine with it.”
Ron looked at Harry. “I’ve got one question, mate,” he said, “earlier, you were so sure he was up to something. What makes you so sure he’s innocent?”
Draco jumped awake, holding back a scream. He was on Blaise’s couch, and a silvery blue lynx was hovering before him.
Draco couldn’t help smiling at Pansy. “Don’t be so dramatic, I was only gone ten days.”
“Oh.” He felt sheepish. “Sorry. I’m… I’ll be okay.”
He sighed, tapping his fingers impatiently. It was only 10:17, and he was already going insane. How was he supposed to do nothing for two whole days?
“Well, I’ve been watching him for weeks now, and there’s been nothing out of the ordinary.”
Harry stood up suddenly, and took out his phone, putting it on the counter.
Draco didn’t speak for the car ride, except for giving Ivan directions. Ivan seemed to pick up that Draco wasn’t up for a conversation, and didn’t try to start one.
They spent most of the train ride in amicable silence, until Harry looked over at Malfoy to see him clenching his fists and chewing his lip.
“Mate, that’s what I’m confused about,” Ron said, scratching his head, “you spent ages convincing us that Malfoy’s turned over a new leaf or whatever, and now you think he’s involved in the shit that’s going on now?”
“When is she going to wake up?” He asked, his voice barely coming out as a whisper.
“Can’t someone else go and get them?”
Draco stared at the letter, rereading it to make sure he had understood correctly.
“Listen, I know you weren’t too keen on moving out, but-”
Potter was staring out into the open sea, his face silhouetted against the grey morning sky. His curly hair was swept back by the wind. Draco watched as he bit his lip and adjusted his glasses.
They were only a minute late, but Robards still looked extraordinarily stressed, pacing up and down in front of their desks as they walked in.
“...No.”
He seemed to be having a lot of that, recently, and he wasn’t sure he was a huge fan of it.
“Great! Fantastic. Let’s go talk to the agent, and uh… why don’t we have a sort of house-warming thing?”
“Mate, I dunno what happened, but you don’t look ‘fine’ to me,” Ron said.
Hermione. And besides, Neville broke into the Ministry with us before. This time they wouldn’t even be breaking in - just helping us get to the right place.”
Harry suddenly felt as though he was invading a very private moment.
Granger sighed. “Yes, I suppose they do. Just be careful, alright?”
Harry looked over at Draco, whose fists were clenched again. He looked apprehensive.
A week or so passed with similar results. They would find the house, ask the person some questions, and find out absolutely nothing. Many of them, like Rex, had tried to hide their connection to the wizarding world. Others were simply trying to move past their past, and some seemed to have disappeared completely, their houses now owned by different people.
friends - he wasn’t sure if they even counted as friends at all - in fact, the exact nature of his relationship to Draco was very confusing, and it made Harry’s head hurt.
Robards paused, considering his words carefully and throwing Draco a cautionary glance before speaking. “We, er, received word from Azkaban that, shortly after you finished your interviews, Lucius Malfoy attempted to escape again.”
"Yes. You drink that and then extract your memories of Voldemort and the war." Luna gently pushes by me to hug him. "Remember, we are all here for you and love you."
I sit up. The sun is shining through the window. I must have fallen asleep reading. It would explain the crick in my neck. The window seat isn't the most comfortable furniture here.
I stop myself from saying she was right.
"I don't know if you can. If you weren't afraid, you wouldn't need to be brave. I do think that the best way forward is to acknowledge it and keep yourself in the present. You don't have to fight the fear. It's enough to be scared and face it anyways. I think that's what being brave means."
Draco took the page, looking faintly scandalized. "Did you tear this out of a book?"
I stare at the scene, horror-struck, not quite understanding what is happening. I let go of Harry's hand as I approach the screaming woman. Ducking, I walk into the cupboard.
"Oh," he breathes shakily, "you're really thick."
"Is something wrong? It's nearly two," she says, ushering me inside.
"Can I go now?" Anthony snaps, looking like a kid about to have a tantrum.
"Okay, that didn't work," he grunts.
And even his bed! For it has been brought to our attention that the two are now “dating” - a most worrisome revelation. Mostly, because we have no confirmation if Mr Potter is with the Malfoy heir out of his own free will.
Draco presses his face into my throat. I think he's crying again. I wouldn't blame him if he is. I think he only told me the bare minimum of what he experienced.
Draco zoned out. If Robards was going to ignore him, then Draco would show him the same courtesy. He looked around the foyer, bored, when his eyes found someone he recognised, and it was one of the last people he would have expected to see at the Ministry.
Draco turned and walked towards the podium, and Harry stood frozen for a moment before taking the remaining seat next to Pansy.
“Um, how was the journey?”
“So he’s not doing great, then?”
“Hermione,” Harry said, softly, lightly touching her shoulder. She made a noise of indignation, rolling over in bed. “Hermione, we have to leave soon.”
Harry walked around the kitchen counter, and pulled Hermione into a hug. She sniffed a bit, and held him tightly.
Ginny gave him a look. He wasn’t really sure what it meant.
Pansy frowned. “Really?”
“Sounds like he had some serious daddy issues.”
“We’ll tell Kingsley. We’ve got proof.”
TRIGGER WARNING: use of f-slur
“Someone’s been killed, Harry. We’re all needed at work.”
“Hey. Hey, it’s okay, Ginny.”
Harry stopped in front of the apartment block.
(See the end of the chapter for
Yeah. No way.
After a couple of stomach churning minutes in the lift, they stepped out into the corridor leading to the Auror offices, and Harry practically sprinted to the end of it, bursting into Robards’ office, breathing heavily.
"I know I just said I wanted to spend a lot of time with you, but this is going to get in the way of that," Harry said, sighing. "I wish I could change it or explain why, but this job is really important."
She took him outside.
(also, the title of this chapter is a line from funeral blues by w.h. auden. it's a really beautiful poem, i think a lot of people have heard it since it was used in the movie four weddings and a funeral but i would recommend listening to it. fun fact: w.h. auden was gay, but this poem wasn't written for a lover - funeral blues was actually originally written for one of his plays, spoken by the brother of a politician who died, and was meant to be satirical. after that, it was published in a separate anthology and most people interpreted it as a genuine poem about grief and love.)
“Yes. He also knows that I was- that I was a Death Eater.”
“Yikes.”
“We have to tell Robards.”
He had walked into the kitchen, where a frying pan stood with half cooked scrambled eggs.
He didn’t even try and say anything. What could he say?
“This looks great, Andromeda, thanks,” Draco said, before serving himself a generous portion of both salad and pasta.
(there's a bit in this chapter that might not make sense if you don't remember exactly what happens in the books, so i've marked it with an asterisk, and there'll be an explanation at the bottom of the chapter)
“It’s okay. Thank you.”
Draco swallowed, feeling as though something unpleasant was lodged at the back of his throat. He started walking towards the gates.
“As if Ginny will even notice whether we’ve got bloody gnomes or not,” Ron said, reaching deep into a bush to pull out one of the little creatures.
They had also travelled to Hungary, in maybe fifth or sixth year, also for his father’s work. And - if Draco remembered correctly - they had been near the border, and Draco’s father had disappeared for a few days for work, leaving him and his mother to sightsee-
“May I have this dance?”
“Nothing,” Harry said, unconvincingly. Hermione gave him a look, and he sighed. “It’s just, Malfoy hasn’t confirmed that he’ll meet us here. I’m worried he didn’t get it, and Robards is going to use it as another excuse to gaslight him.”
Hermione shook her head. “It’s not enough, Harry. That letter doesn’t explicitly say that they framed him. And I doubt people are going to trust Malfoy rather than two of our best Aurors - most people don’t think he should have even been exonerated, let alone allowed to be an Auror.”
“But, she also helped a lot of people. I can’t speak on behalf of others, but she helped me, at least. I don’t know where I would be without her. I can’t imagine the person I would have become if I was only raised by my father. She saved me both from him and his influence.”
Draco rushed into the Ministry, sleep deprived and functioning only because of coffee, which seemed to be a common occurrence. He ended up standing just apart from Potter, Granger and Weasley, next to Longbottom.
“Will you two just shut up?” Harry snapped, slamming his fist down on the desk. “We hardly ever see each other anymore. And when we do, all you do is fight. I know it’s hard right now, but can’t we just… go back to old times?”
“So what’s happening with the manor and stuff?”
“Right. We have 12 official aurors, and 23 trainees. Two trainees will be assigned to each senior member, based on your performance in training sessions so far. I’m going to be completely transparent - you all know roughly how well you’re doing - and start reading out lists of names from the pair with the worst performance so far. Susan Bones and Hannah Abbot, you’re with Reginald Illings.” Kingsley continued to rattle off names from his list.
“Yes, quite - Nollit’s been in our family for decades, though. They can only forcibly free house elves if they want to go, and we’ve always treated her well enough that she wants to stay.”
“That’s not what- I don’t want to- nevermind. I’m just going to…” he looked around, his face flushed red. “I’m not hungry.” He walked into his bedroom.
“Yeah, sure.” They laughed for a few moments, before Draco spoke again. “Listen, I’m… I’m not okay right now. You know that. And I’m not going to be okay for a while. But I’m not going to bottle everything up.”
Harry felt something warm spread outwards from his heart.
“I’ve got to uh, go. To the bathroom,” Draco said, and followed them.
touched
“Harry, have you forgotten what he was like in school?”
There was a noise behind him. Draco pulled out his wand and spun around-
He couldn’t tell them. They’d think he was crazy.
"This is going to be a disaster," Ron muttered.
“Yeah.” Draco sighed again. It was that kind of day. “What have you been up to, apart from narrowly escaping eviction?”
“Yeah, yeah. How was your little vacation with Potter?”
Robards reached into his robe and pulled out a card. “Well, if you think of anything, don’t hesitate to send an owl. Er, not that you use owls… well, I’m sure you can make a plan.”
Harry zoned them out. Their bickering was almost constant in the workplace, as it had been in school. There had been the brief grace period just after they had got together, when it seemed their fighting had only been because neither wanted to admit their feelings for the other, but now it was back to the usual.
Amyra.
“Should I tell him to leave?”
for us, Harry.”
Just- just tell us what the Purists are, and what happened to them.”
“Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Let’s just do it tomorrow and get it over with.”
“Are you doing alright?”
“If the Purists knew about the safe, why would they wait so long to collect it? They could have gone and got it from the Manor at any time, but they didn’t.”
“Alright,” he said, “let’s give it a shot.”
“Oh. Uh, thanks.”
Ron sighed. “I know it’s selfish. But I didn’t want to move out because… well, I don’t think Hermione and I are going to be together much longer.”
“Okay, we need to get there as quickly as possible, so we’re going to need to apparate, even though it’s risky - it’s a long distance. Granger and Goldstein, since you haven’t been before, you can hold on to me and Langsley, we’ll take you. Potter and Malfoy, I trust you’ll be able to apparate there on your own.” He paused, and looked at them all. “This is serious. The only time murders like this have happened have been when You Know Who or Grindelwald were at large. We don’t want another dark wizard rising up.” They all nodded. “All right. Let’s go.”
"So when do you leave?" She said, quickly retracting her hand.
Draco walked up the stairs of the apartment buildings, and stopped outside Blaise’s door.
Lucius paused.
“Potter.”
“She was hexed with some pretty nasty spells, but it’s nothing we can’t handle. Luckily her dog was loud enough that neighbours called the local police, and then our people intercepted the situation.”
It reminded him of school again, constantly obsessing over Draco, trying to prove that he was behind every single bad thing.
“Welcome. It ain’t much. Here’s the keys, and the key to the boat.” He handed them to Harry. “A’ight. Give me a ring when your stay is finished.” He gave Harry a piece of paper with a phone number scribbled onto it.
She nodded. “And you…?”
"You can hardly call it work," he sighed, "It's just extended school with a bit of job experience."
“You’re a coward.”
Draco quickly moved away from the door as it opened, and Potter and Granger walked out. They closed the door behind them, and Draco followed as they walked down the hall, talking in low whispers.
The lynx repeated itself, then dissipated.
“So, er, you like dragons, Teddy?”
"Me, too."
you can’t just show up and demand to examine her body!”
The only concrete thing he remembered feeling that night was hatred. Hatred of Ginny, of everything she had. Maybe it was better described as envy. He had stumbled over to Blaise. "Blaise, Blaise, Blaise, guesswhat. Guess whaaaaat."
They reached the next floor, where the guard was waiting for them. She handed Harry a key, and jerked her head towards the nearest cell. She then left them, walking down the staircase.
“Well, that’ll be all then, I’ll leave you to walking your dog. Come on, Potter, if we hurry, you’ll be home before midnight.”
“You could just make that a small thing,” Pansy said, “you know, just really close family members.”
“Er-”
After ten minutes or so, a sigh came from the desk, and he heard Hermione’s voice saying, “Alright, we’d better go before she comes back from her meeting. I don’t think there’s anything-”
Harry felt tears burning behind his eyes. “I… it’s okay, it was… I get why she did it. I was a pretty shit boyfriend.”
“Will you check up on Blaise? We should stay in touch so we know how it’s going on his end,” Harry said.
The lift jolted to a stop, and the doors slid open. They walked down the corridor, to their offices, and to Harry’s surprise, sitting in his desk chair, was Draco.
Harry stood up, anger coursing through his blood. "What would you know about Dumbledore!? He wasn't- he didn't- he was a
“Yes, that’s right.”
Harry opened his mouth to say something, thought better of it, and opted for a nod instead.
Draco blushed, looking away. “No, I just… despite everything that just happened, and my- my mother, I don’t actually feel too bad-”
"Just remembering Quidditch," Harry said, nodding at Malfoy's broom.
It all looked the same. Exactly as he’d left it, after the war.
Harry nodded, letting the tears roll down his cheeks.
“No,” Draco said, starting to put in numbers, “but I know my father.”
“Well, I’m not sure I’m the best one to give you advice on that, Hermione.”
“Harry-”
“Not for a Death Eater, though. I’m pretty sure that every other Death Eater has killed before. And besides, it’s not like you really chose to be a Death Eater, right?”
"Hey, kid. Wasn't sure I'd see you again," Amyra said. She was sitting propped up on a mountain of pillows, her slight smile still groggy.
"And you didn't think telling me in advance would be a good idea?"
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly. "Well, I'm afraid we're here on Ministry business. Otherwise we wouldn't have been allowed to come."
"Oh," Harry said, feeling awkward. "I was going to come say goodbye at the Burrow on my way."
Potter turned and muttered a spell that Draco couldn’t hear, pointing out the window. Nothing seemed to happen.
They nodded.
Draco nodded. “He looks like he’s doing well. Teddy, I mean.”
“No. Of Sirius. You have that same fierce look of wanting to prove yourself. James was much more arrogant- he seemed to think he was already the best at everything, whereas Sirius felt like he was still fighting for it.”
“I mean, in the hospital.”
“We have very different ideas of fun, Pansy.”
He heard the door creak open behind him, and turned to see Hermione, in a purple dressing gown.
They were wearing long, black robes, with red embroidery on the seams. A hood threw most of their face into darkness, but Draco could just make out a silver mask underneath.
This was where Blaise lived.
He’d thought they were closer after Azkaban, at least, but then this morning, Draco had seemed so cold - although, that could be attributed to the fact that his mother had
“I’ll tell you, Draco, because I’m proud of you. And because I hate those people, anyway. They made me a failure in the Dark Lord’s eyes.”
“I won’t, don’t worry. I’ll just say I think Hermione’s right about moving out or something, and we’ll start looking for places.”
it's been so long since i last updated wow... school started again so i have been really busy, but here!
They all stood for a moment, frozen in the horror of the scene, until Robards broke the silence.
He couldn’t go back home. Pansy was… busy, and he didn’t want to embarrass himself. His lungs burned as he came to a halt outside another block of flats, and realised what area of town he was in.
Harry knocked on the door of the apartment. It was a nice enough place, although it looked smaller than their apartment, and this one was supposed to house four people.
“Harry, leave it.” Hermione’s voice was still as exasperated as it had always been whenever Draco got a rise out of Potter.
"I was just avoiding you yelling at me for putting the oven on the wrong temperature or something," Ron shrugged.
“...So, we can’t easily get into those parts of the Ministry without Robards being suspicious. That’s where you come in. If you want to help, I mean.”
Harry scowled, and looked out the window. It was a bright, sunny day, and they were all holed up in Harry’s room. He had called them there to tell them about everything that had happened on his trip.
“I really don’t know what I was thinking of doing, honestly. We had a lot of fights where I was about to do it, and then I just… couldn’t. And I would hope that he would do it, and then he wouldn’t either, and we’d both apologise and just act like nothing had happened.” She sighed, and wiped her eyes. “I think I thought that if he did it, I’d feel better. But now he’s broken up with me, and I still feel awful. And guilty.”
Draco took a deep breath. "I'm sorry to just barge in here after months of completely ignoring you."
got together. Only took about nine years.”
Harry pushed himself as close to the wall as he possibly could as Elarena stormed over to her desk.
Ginny sat down next to him. "My surgery date has been moved forwards," she said quietly, smiling.
He took a deep breath. "Sorry for getting angry."
She nodded. “Yeah. Thanks, Harry.”
Harry looked around, to make sure there was no one else there, and began looking at Malfoy’s desk.
“I suppose. She wasn’t even fifty, though.”
“So, Pansy, what are you up to these days?”
“To apologise. To you, actually. He didn’t know you were away.”
Harry was relieved to see that by the time he'd finished, Draco and Narcissa had broken apart.
“I overheard them talking about it last night. They didn’t explicitly say it, but I’m pretty sure it’s for my surgery. They were saying… well, I’m the only kid still at school, so once you guys move out, they don’t need such a big house anymore. They’ll get a small cottage somewhere in this area instead, and…” Ginny sat down on the bed, and put her head in her hands. Harry sat next to her.
Ron nodded. “Okay.”
In the back of his mind, something was telling him to look. He tried to fight the urge, knowing that it was wrong, but after what he had just been asked to do…
Shivering, Draco curled up in the corner of the cell, unable to stop his mind from drifting.
“I don’t wanna make you choose between me and Hermione,” Ron said bluntly.
Draco grinned. “Thank you. Love you, Pansy.”
“Yeah.”
At this point, to Harry’s great relief, Pansy intervened.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’ve talked about it a lot, and since the three of you have moved out, we don’t need the space anymore. We’re selling the house.”
Hermione nodded. “I suspected the same thing when both the people we interviewed were attacked. No one could have known that we talked to both of them unless they were told by someone who already knew, and while it is possible that the Purists are getting rid of people that could incriminate them, it’s highly unlikely for them to start in the same order that we have been interviewing people.”
“Pansy, Draco - so glad you could make it!” He said, arms spread wide. He pulled them each into embraces. “Draco, you look just like when we used to go to Sluggy’s parties back in the day.”
Inside the cells, Harry thought he recognised some of the faces, but it was difficult to tell. They were all cowered in the corners of their cells, or pacing up and down, their faces thin and withered.
“Not much, really,” Seamus said.
Draco bit his lip. “I suppose, but… I don’t know. I don’t want to run away anymore.”
Harry nodded slowly. "I'm glad your surgery went well," he said.
Just then, a blur of blond hair pushed through the crowd, and Malfoy stopped next to Harry, panting. “Sorry. Got- got caught up… came as soon as I could…”
Ivan moved away.
Harry tuned out their bickering once again, and found his eyes came to rest on Malfoy. His beanbag, like Harry’s, had disintegrated first try. Malfoy was impressively good at magic - at a higher level than most of Dumbledore’s Army.
Being trans in the wizarding world was actually fairly simple. Wizard healers had taken all the aspects of Muggle surgeries that worked, and applied them to a magical situation. That meant no scars, better results, better functionality. And hormones worked a lot faster.
Blaise nodded stiffly. “Alright. I’ll contact them, but I can’t make any promises.”
Hermione smiled. “It’s okay. I know you didn’t mean it. And, besides,” her smile faltered, “you did say some things that were true.”
Hermione looked up from the dining room table, her hair pulled back out of her face in some semblance of a messy bun. “Oh, hi Harry,” she said absently, “how did it go?”
Harry smiled, and finally made eye contact with her. "I still don't understand why Sirius never mentioned you to me."
Unable to stop the tears, Draco wiped his face on his sleeve. “Thank you.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He wasn’t sure saying anything would help. Instead, he took the necklace from Draco’s hands, feeling his heart jump as his fingers brushed against Draco’s.
Harry thought for a moment. He couldn’t believe Malfoy would be involved in anything - he had been a Death Eater, but he had been forced into it…
“What? Why?”
He grabbed a roll of parchment from his desk, and quickly scribbled:
"I still love you. Really, I do. But we can both tell it's not working. I don't know if it's the long distance, or your work, or maybe it's just us, but we only ever fight anymore."
Ron raised an eyebrow. "Don't tell me Hermione's wrangled you into moving out, too?"
ashamed-
“That makes two of us.”
Harry walked a step behind Draco, letting him lead the way into Lucius Malfoy’s study.
Five seconds. Ten seconds. Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen-
"Oh," Potter said. "Well, it's a difficult spell. I guess I forgot most people weren't in Dumbledore's Army."
“Oh. I mean he’s… kind of. I know he’s changed, if that’s what you mean?” Harry frowned.
“I know it’s holiday season, but we really can’t afford to have anyone take time off. It’s all hands on deck,” Robards sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair, “of course, Christmas Day is a public holiday, but apart from that…”
"I guess I thought… Well, I didn't really think. I woke up, and I figured that if I got here soon enough, I could save you. Even though I know that my dreams are just… just dreams."
“And…?”
“You’re still working with the Malfoy kid?”
She nodded.
Draco nodded thanks, and began walking to the bathroom.
stop now.”
Potter frowned at him. “But-”
It caught Harry off guard, and he stood frozen for a second before reciprocating the hug.
“Oh. Uh, Ginny, uh, broke up with me. Back at the hospital.”
"Uh, tomorrow. I need to pack."
"It's a really difficult spell, though. Lupin said most adults can't cast corporeal ones."
Potter was staring at the dog.
“It’s going to be fun, I promise.”
Robards nodded. "Alright. We're travelling by broom, because apparition at this distance and without properly knowing the destination is risky. Charm up your belongings and get on your brooms."
“I think we’d all just feel a bit more comfortable if someone was to be, erm, keeping an eye on him, so to speak.”
“It’ll be okay. It’s okay.”
He was vaguely aware of other people entering the room and seating themselves on the rows of seats around the room, and of someone speaking, and then Robards’ voice slipped into his mind again.
“He definitely was. At least, at first. He’s mentioned less as time goes on, but from what I can gather, I think the Dark Lord sent him to check up on them. He was kind of a correspondent.”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Hermione said, “I didn’t get here in time, I tried to warn you-”
"You didn't come back with Ron and Hermione?" Ginny asked. "They were here when I woke up, but they had to leave pretty quickly for something work-related. I thought you were going to be with them."
“We break into the Ministry. We did it before, and we were teenagers then.”
“What are we even looking for?” Harry asked.
“Back in the high security cell, with even more Dementors and enchantments on him than before,” Robards said, sighing. “We aren’t on very good terms with… anyway. As I said, the situation has been resolved. Lucius Malfoy has been restrained.” Robards sighed again. “Anyway, I need you two back at the Ministry, now. Granger and Weasley are already there, along with a few others. More Muggles have been killed, too.”
They were all thinking the same thing - what if You Know Who was back?”
“Bellatrix.”
“Like what?”
Did Robards really think he was that thick? He could have figured out there was something going on, even if he hadn’t overheard them talking before.
“Draco? That’s an interesting name.”
“I have one condition, though.”
Draco sighed and flopped down on the couch. “I’d hardly call it a vacation. But the short version is: my dad’s still an asshole, someone nearly died, Potter’s girlfriend broke up with him, and my boss has set Potter and Granger to spy on me because he thinks I’m still a Death Eater.”
She smelled like rosey perfume, and freshly baked cookies.
A large desk, made out of dark wood, stood in the middle of the room, with piles of papers and books all over it. Behind it stood a tall bookshelf with even more books and files.
“It’s alright, Mother. Thank you.” He bent down to kiss his mother on the forehead. “We’re going to go speak to Father now.”
"I came as soon as I heard," Harry said, "but you hadn't woken up yet. I was scared, I thought-" He paused, looking away. "I thought I was going to lose you."
As he picked up the last loose piece of paper from the draw, Harry saw a glint of silver. He picked up a small, silver key. “Hey, Malfoy,” he called out, holding up the key.
"Whatever gave you that impression?" He said, with a bit more menace in his sarcasm than Hermione deserved.
Draco smiled.
“Understood, Sir,” Granger said.
Harry stared at her. How had Sirius never talked about her, not even once? They must have been incredibly close if she knew about his animagus form. “He never mentioned you to me.”
Harry picked up today’s Daily Prophet, looking to peruse an article on garden gnomes, but unfortunately the front page caught his eye.
Hermione looked at Harry, terror in her eyes.
“Yes. Draco Malfoy,” the man said, nodding. Draco stared at him, confused.
“No! I mean, Potter isn’t- I’m not-” Draco’s splutters trailed off, his mind racing.
“It’s hard being so smart sometimes, but I manage.”
“Oh. Right.” Harry felt something twist in his stomach.
Why them?
A smile split across her face. "I'm great. A bit tired, but they have me something to drink and the anaesthetic has pretty much worn off. I can't feel any pain, either."
“So, as I said, all hands on deck. You all know your assignments. We’re not in the field unless we get some more, er, bad news. Malfoy, Potter, with me. Dismissed.”
Elarena took a deep breath, and pushed her hands through her hair. “You should have told me about it sooner. You should have told me before you even started it.”
I frown, suddenly remembering that Luna and Ginny should be getting ready for their honeymoon. They should be searching for Atlantis soon. For some reason, they both wanted to go hunting for winged hippocamps. Not exactly what I would think is romantic, but I guess searching for a lost city and mythical animals does sound fun.
Luna is sitting on the floor, grimy and exhausted. Despite her circumstances, she doesn't look afraid. Her eyes are focused on the red slits of the Dark Lord's, ignoring everyone else in the room.
Harry couldn't stand this anymore. Just as Draco was moving to stand up, he caught his arm. A flicker of surprise flashed over Draco’s sharp features. That little display of
"You are?" Pansy pipes up, startled.
Luna grabs Ginny's arm and turns her to face her. Murmuring softly, she gently cups Ginny's face. I can't hear what she's saying, but gradually the tension eases out of Ginny.
"It's alright now. It's not like you could have known." Harry presses a kiss to my cheek. "Are you ready to continue? We're going to skip most of the bad shit that happened at Hogwarts. There's a lot of things in those memories that I'm worried will trigger the curse."
him?" Narcissa murmured, her lips next to his ear.
"Fine. Just a little tired."
"Good morning, Mother," I say, as she walks up to me and cups my face in her hands.
Luna has told me before that Malfoy has changed. Even Ginny has. Tonight... I finally saw it for myself. I finally had the opportunity to meet this new Draco Malfoy... and I like him. I like him a lot.
The sensation of falling into the pensieve makes me nauseous. I close my eyes and try to breathe through it. It suddenly stops and Harry's hand slips into mine.
"I'll try to find them."
"Blaise!" Draco snaps, horrified.
"Why are you going through so much trouble for me? I'm not worth it." I pull the blanket over my head.
Kissing Draco doesn't make me see fireworks. It's not like a movie or a book. It's not even like how some songs describe kissing.
Malfoy had looked so beautiful in the light of the setting sun. Then, that bee had landed on his cheek.
To my surprise, she kisses Harry's forehead before doing the same to me.
I swallow back my anger and run my fingers through Harry's messy hair. "He's a sexist scumbag. Cleaning and cooking aren't even feminine. They're fucking chores that everyone should do. And since when does bottoming equate to femininity? He had no right to treat you like that."
"I think you need to acknowledge your feelings about her, but also understand that she is gone. She can't hurt you anymore."
I use my magic to lift the bedclothes. Carefully settling Draco in bed, I kiss his forehead. His lashes flutter, but he doesn't wake. Taking off his shoes and socks, I keep watching him, wondering when he will wake up.
"I see," Harry says, his voice sounding weak. "Well, we can do that… if you want to, of course. I don't want to rush you."
“I don’t believe that for a second,” Mr Goldstein - a Ravenclaw - says. “There has to be another reason. Maybe Malfoy is doing it out of revenge, maybe out of spite. Or maybe just to improve his public image, I honestly don’t know. But I wouldn’t put it past him to have done something of the above to my Harry.”
When I look up, Lucius Malfoy is in the doorway. I've never seen Lucius look so... unkempt. His hair is all over the place and his robes look... wrong... like they're too big for him.
"She'll be here soon," Luna says softly, guessing what is on my mind.
All of that... and now he's hurt Kreacher and thrown a bowl of soup at me.
"Fair enough... I still wanted to be the one kissing you though."
Harry felt himself blanch. He nodded shortly, his gaze falling to the book. He felt dizzy.
"I…" He bites his lip, his arms winding around my waist. "Are you upset?"
In her hands is a copy of the
Father releases me and moves towards the door.
All the eighth year students were sharing a tower, regardless of their house. Unfortunately, Harry hadn't gotten close enough to any alphas to scent them. All students were ordered to use suppressants once they had presented, so close proximity was needed to pick up their flavour. Which was certainly a reason why the bathroom was the only place where he had ever scented this delicious mix.
"Torture her," he orders me.
He pressed against Draco as he kissed his throat. He flicked his tongue against his pulse and moaned. Draco tasted like ambrosia and sin.
for having us. We really would like to get all this cleared up as soon as possible.
My thighs shake as pleasure builds up impossibly fast when Draco brushes against my prostate. Concentrating his fingers on that spot, he hollows his cheeks and sucks on my head.
Blinking, Harry looks at the mirror as well. His cheeks turn a lovely shade of red. "Right. Uh, next memory?"
"Should we get her?"
I expect to see more people rushing to the Welcome Witch. I expect to see a crowd. The only people in the lobby are a few patients, standing in line to talk to her. No one is panicking. No one is crowding around a still body.
Malfoy's magic felt different from his. It was like sitting in front of a fireplace on a cold winter day... it was like coming home.
Draco is silent for a long time, staring at me. Every muscle in his body seems to be tense with the urge to flee, but he stays. More tears fall from his eyes. I carefully wipe them away.
"Aren't you straight?" he asks, looking puzzled.
"Go back home," I order.
I see the man's fist raise. Red clouds my vision. The next thing I know, Goldstein is on the ground underneath me. His nose and mouth are bleeding. My hand is throbbing.
"Either way, it was stressful. I can fight my own battles," he insists.
Harry rubs the back of his neck. "Yes?"
When he finally reached his dorm, Harry put the note and his glasses on his night stand. Stretching out on his bed, he tried to think of the last time he had even seen Draco outside of class or meals. The alpha was probably avoiding him.
"Are you ready to talk?" Luna raises an eyebrow at me as we start taking off our clothes.
Next time, I promise myself, I will worship every inch of his body. I'll study every freckle, kiss every dip in his abs, touch every curve, taste everything he is. Right now though, the only light is from a flickering candle next to the bed… and Draco is impatiently grabbing my shirt.
By the time we get back to the chateau, Luna has already woken Narcissa and explained the situation.
Hermione's hand flies to her mouth as she gasps. Then, she straightens her back. "Harry, he is bloody awful! Why do you insist on staying with him?! He's the absolute worst!"
A crowd was gathered on the steps, but he couldn't make out their faces. Harry didn't dare risk opening his eyes further.
I'm about to try reassuring her, but I see someone in the distance. My blood runs cold. I pull Luna behind me as the voice speaks.
I wait until Draco and I are alone before placing my wand tip to my temple. I focus on the horrible things that have happened to me as I pull out the memories one by one. They swirl in the pensieve like smoky tendrils of my past. It takes me a long time to finish. When I do, I add the memories of Anthony in as well.
Minty's eyes widen. "Sir, why-?"
"Harry... these aren't... well, human teeth marks." Hermione backed away, chewing on her lower lip.
"Um... you're going to feel an urge to finish the bond Harry... then, uh, you will need to... consummate the bond. You will be... well, married for all intents and purposes." Hermione winced. "Like I said though, it won't become unbearable until you are of age."
The book isn't as old as I had been expecting. I check the publishing information out of curiosity and the urge to stall. I'm scared to read about the curse. I'm scared that it won't tell us anything.
"Ah… well, apparently, I had a piece of his soul inside me. When he tried to kill me when I was a baby, he accidentally turned me into a horcrux. When Voldemort announced that I was dead during the final battle, he did actually kill me." Harry takes a breath, his eyes on my face as I wince. "I went to the forest alone. I let him kill me. I went into a weird place in my head. Dumbledore was there. He explained a lot to me."
"Malfoy, what do you remember about the wedding reception?"
Harry rolled his eyes heavenward and quickly kissed his mate. Draco didn't have time to respond because Ron was yanking Harry away.
"Yeah. I owe you an explanation, but first, I need to tell you a few things."
I hesitate. I still don't know if Harry was going to kiss me when we were at my cottage.
I can't help wincing at the sound of his name. Harry doesn't comment on it. He just waves his wand and we're suddenly standing in the headmaster's office.
I take off the glasses Hermione charmed for us. They translate written words. They're very useful, but they give me a headache if I use them for too long. I rub my eyes.
Every sound Harry made was swallowed by Draco's mouth. Harry sucked on his tongue and Draco started making his own stifled moans.
"Is that
Potter looks hesitant, but he slowly inches forward. The bees don't touch him. My spell is acting as a barrier between them. He stares incredulously at the bees in my hand.
I can't even check his pulse with his hands holding me down… which is probably why he pinned me in the first place.
"Alright," I murmur, a little disappointed. "She really was that happy we might have found a way to break the curse?"
I stare at her. I'm not sure what to make of that. Luna unfolds her body and moves to me. She starts guiding my limbs into new positions.
I swallow again, forcing myself to stay in bed and not rush to France.  My mother is a powerful witch. She can take care of herself. I take deep breaths. I need to stay calm. She would kill me if I left the hospital without being discharged... and drag me back here. Which would put her out in the open.
"Did... I just get Harry fired?"
"Draco and Ha-"
"This might be the only way to break the curse," I say gently. "I won't hurt you."
"I thought you were dead. I felt the bond sever." Draco whispered in a choked voice against Harry's chest, sobbing. "You were gone."
"Actually, no, I'm not befriending him for that," I say icily.
I blink. Ice seems to be inching through my veins.  My lips feel tingly. It's getting harder to breathe. My stomach hurts. I try lifting my hand. I try reaching for my wand. I can't. My arm refuses to move.
There's a muffled sob from Narcissa. When I look up at her, she has her face buried in her hands. Her shoulders shake as Lucius wraps his arms around her.
"I know, Potter." I roll my eyes.
His mate didn't pull away to tease him this time. Draco's tongue kept moving in short flicks and long swipes. Harry bit the pillow as Draco's tongue press inside of him.
"We both know you'll only cheat on me with her! She still wants you!"
I blink my eyes open to see Luna leaning over me. "Yeah. I'll send a fire message."
"That's the end of that. It was a week before Ginny and Luna were married." Harry sighs. "Let's get out of here."
I look back down, my laughter dying. Potter's hand appears in my line of sight. He's holding the handkerchief. I take it in confusion, blinking up at Potter.
Every step made him rock against him. Harry moved his hands to Draco's shoulders, using them to stabilize himself. He started moving his hips, grinding against Draco.
with that curse in sixth year. I forgive your past. I forgive you for everything you did while you were a kid."
"I know."
It takes me longer than it usually does to get all of him in, but it's worth it when I lift my eyes and see Draco's stunned face. Keeping our eyes locked, I bob my head. The feeling of his cock sliding in my throat is turning me on even more. I want to feel him in my arse too.
Draco's relief washed over Harry. He laid back again, propping himself up on pillows so he could watch Draco easily.
"Harry, I doubt Malfoy is even aware of how many times you have saved him. Besides, it's your job to take care of him for as long as he's here. I'm sure he isn't that bad still."
I know I'm probably making him think I'm thick, but I have had feelings for this man since we were kids. If I'm misreading the situation, I don't want to embarrass myself with presumptions.
"Fair point... then, I'll just ask you out when you're healed." I raise my eyebrows.
"Well... you are his mate. That means on a deep level, you are extremely compatible. He can't hate you. If he did, the bond mark wouldn't have healed cleanly."
It's actually nice to know that Harry developed a fighting spirit against these awful people. Growing up, I had a family who loved me and was never neglected or abused. Thinking about it, I can't even imagine not having friends as a child. Something occurs to me then.
I hesitate. I suppose I can see where Draco is coming from. His heart is in a fragile state. Anthony could have caused him to go into cardiac arrest or something.
She demonstrates the position. Her chest is parallel with the sand. She almost looks like she's doing a push up, but her hips are twisted to the right. Her right leg is behind her shoulders. Her left leg is suspended in the water below her right thigh. I have no idea how any muggle could fight gravity on land in that position. Luna is holding herself up with only her hands.
Potter blinks, pausing mid-step to stare at me. "What?"
"They're still covering too much of you," I say, leaning forward and kissing his shoulder.
"I'm fine," I mumble, trying to stand. I'm pleasantly surprised when I succeed.
"Harry?"
he casts. A shuddering breath leaves him as he stares at the unblemished skin on his arm.
"You can't keep me here," Anthony says defiantly. "You can't force me to sign it."
"I will do better, I swear. I'll do whatever you need." My knuckles are white on my knees. "Whatever it takes to prove myself."
"I… I don't know if it's broken. I think it might be? Draco confronted three memories that were cursed and it seemed like he beat them all. But the last one took a lot out of him. He was screaming a lot. Wouldn't let me near him either." I run my fingers over his cheek. "He punched Voldemort in the face."
I was shocked, honestly. I knew Anthony was possessive and that he didn’t accept our breakup. But I thought I had taken care of that.
"What accusation?! He just wants some flowers!"
"What was that?" I ask.
"It's what fate gave us." I dip my head and kiss him sweetly. "I'm just glad we're only having one this time."
"If you ever die again, I'm bringing you back to kill you myself."
Harry walks over, setting a tray of cheese toasties and bowls of chicken noodle soup down in front of us. He kisses the top of my head as he sits down on my other side.
I have overheard loads of things about Draco Malfoy over the years. Ginny and Luna talk about him often enough. I know he keeps bees. I know he donates money to the orphanage Neville set up for kids who lost their families in the war. I know he does yoga with Luna. I even know he has something wrong with his mind that causes panic attacks.
"Draco. Your heart. Why didn't you tell me?"
We've been reading an absolutely ancient book together. It's about Prussian curses. I'm not hopeful that we'll find anything.
