Malfoy rolls his eyes, flipping a dismissive hand at Harry. “Are you so stupid you forgot my families immense wealth? We have a massive library and, trust me,” Malfoy leveled a dark glance at Harry, “it has plenty of information about Horcruxes.”
There’s multiple guest bedrooms, what looks like an unused office, and what seems to be a small city library in the other doors he opens. As he snaps that particular door shut, he realizes the next door is the one directly opposite Malfoy’s room.
Pansy’s face flashed into Draco’s view, catching his eye from the dance floor. She grinned cheekily at him, and blew him a kiss as she was twirled back into the crowd by a Durmstrang student.
He saw no sign of the Slytherin, who stood out easily with his sharp features and luxurious clothing. Harry shook his head, pushing through the large double doors of the ballroom. He didn’t spare a glance back at the bustling party, too focused on his mission to care about what he was missing- not that it was much.
Hermione’s voice trailed off as her eyes moved from Harry’s face to the boy in his arms. Shock flashed across her face, and one of her hands came to her mouth. “Harry…”
It stepped lightly around Malfoy’s body, and he looked at it gratefully. “I need you to send a message to Hermione, please. Tell her someone is in grave danger and she needs to bring Madame Pomfrey here immediately. Hurry, please!” The stag reared its head, galloping through the wall of the room, presumably towards the hall where the ball was being held.
He glances at Malfoy, whose face is at peace for the first time in the days they’ve been together, and resolves not to wake him. It can’t be all that difficult to find a shower in this house, can it?
Harry nods, gathering the towels and robe into his arms as he stands. “Thanks, Malfoy,” he says, avoiding his eyes as he walks out of the bedroom. He enters the bathroom to the scent of mint and rain- not just rain, a thunderstorm. He’s not sure how that particular smell could be even bottled, but he doesn’t question it too much, deigning to shrug off his clothes instead.
He shook his head, turning away. What Pansy did was of no interest to him. Though he loved her, he was glad to have her chattering at someone who wasn’t him. There were plenty of thoughts clouding his mind already. He needed a clear head.
“I’ve picked. Go ahead and go in, get undressed and settled, and I’ll come in once that’s all done.”
Harry tilts his head as he stares at Malfoy- he’d blushed more in the past twenty minutes than Harry had ever seen him blush before. But he lets it go, crossing his legs on the bed and opening his own book.
Malfoy looks at him dubiously. “You just feel better?” he repeats, his voice mild. Harry can hear the undercurrent of stress there, though. He almost regrets waking his resident healer up.
He needed to get him help, that was for certain. The blood hadn’t soaked through the torn sleeve yet, but it would if that wound wasn’t closed up.
Malfoy throws a wry smile over his shoulder at Harry, turning back to the books as he responds. “Green is a lovely color, but blue is my favorite. There’s plenty of Slytherin pride at Hogwarts. When I’m home, I like to be comfortable.” He waves a slender hand in the air, gesturing at the homey atmosphere as he pulls out books and inspects their covers.
They stumble out together, connected by Harry’s hand, which is still holding tightly to Malfoy’s arm. As soon as he regains his wits, he lets go, sending a guilty glance over at Malfoy. To his relief, Malfoy isn’t looking anywhere in his direction. Instead, he seems completely overwhelmed by their present situation. His eyes are dark and stormy, bony fists tight at his sides. A scowl pulls at his delicate features as his eyes dart around the cavernous room.
Hary grimaced, pacing in the hallway as he stared down at the map in his hands. I need to find Malfoy! Where could he have disappeared to? I need to find him. He stared at the map accusingly, as if it were to blame for Malfoy’s disappearance, and stopped once more in the exact spot Malfoy had been.
Harry lets a tiny smile touch his lips. Not to comfort Malfoy, not at all. Just to… lighten the mood.
Malfoy’s face is focused in a way Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen before. His silver eyes are rapt, slightly narrowed at whatever he sees. His lips curve around the incantations in a way that’s almost beautiful, along with the way his long fingers grip his wand.
“Harry!” she exclaimed. She grabbed a handful of her silky periwinkle robes, holding them out of the way as she ran towards him. Harry’s stag peeked out slightly from behind the wall, dissolving into silver mist as its purpose had been fulfilled.
Ron and Hermione were likely mourning, as he should be. Harry knows that many people would be dead when it was all said and done. Dead because of him, because of what Voldemort had done to get him.
if you have any thoughts, please feel free to leave them or a kudo!! <3 thank you so much for reading!!
A cool hand cups his head, fingers gently sliding in between his messy curls. Harry melts into the touch, and the resulting relief. Malfoy crouches down next to him, his thumb rubbing small circles onto his forehead as he looks at him worriedly. “Harry?”
Malfoy pauses his incantation, his wand hovering in midair as his eyes dart to Harry’s. “They reveal things to me. Your magical core, your auras, your energy. Any issues with them.” His hand falls to his side. “They aren’t showing anything.”
Cold hands are touching him, pressing against his forehead, and cheek, while one steadily rests on his chest. Harry feels the familiar stirring of Malfoy’s magic under his skin, calming his stomach and his irregular heartbeat.
He adjusted the cuff of his white shirt, his silver-grey eyes scanning the room for a drink tray. Alcohol focused his mind, it always had. He spotted one, bobbing its way through the room, and began to thread his way through the crowds of people to reach it.
Harry rolls his eyes. "Fuck off, Malfoy." He hesitates one more second. but finds he isn’t all too opposed to the idea of Malfoy seeing if he was fit or not. And maybe telling him so, too. "Let's get this over with."
Malfoy clutched onto Harry’s shirt, his eyebrows drawing together slightly. He didn’t make any other moves, simply settled further into Harry’s arms.
Harry cursed quietly, hoisting Malfoy to a full sitting position. He glanced over his body, trying to gauge where the best place to pick him up would be, and determined that a bridal carry would be the least intrusive to his arm.
“I don’t want to talk about it.” Malfoy cuts him off, his voice harsh. He gingerly touches the scrape on his cheek, glancing at his bloody fingers before wiping them on his dark robe. “I’m fine. Do what you need to do.”
After what seems like hours, Harry and the unknown person were inside the castle. They are in a room- it smells like fire and ash.
Harry’s discovered Draco’s plan...by walking straight into it. It’s on him to help, and though he hates the git, he can’t let him fade away.
Harry smiles bemusedly. “Of course- nothing’s ever easy when it involves Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.”
Malfoy's eyes dart away and color rises in his pale cheeks. Harry shakes his head, taking a few seconds to compose himself. Was he really finding Draco Malfoy attractive? Sweet?? The two boys sit in awkward silence for a beat more until Malfoy returns to normal, making an attempt to be business-like.
He glanced quickly up at the wall again, doing a double take. There was...a door there. A door that had definitely not been there before. What the bloody fuck.
Harry stands up and takes a few steps away from Malfoy. "Close your eyes," he says, brusquely. Malfoy does, turning away from him, and Harry unbuttons his pants and slips them off. He leaves his briefs on and messily folds the pants, setting them with his shirt.
Bubbles cover the surface of the water. Its heat permeates Harry’s skin, almost painful. But somehow it’s relaxing, and Harry sinks in, taking a deep breath of the sweetly scented steam before he calls for Malfoy to enter.
He could swear he sees a glimpse of white blonde hair in the crowd of bodies, and he pushes his way towards it. He stops a few feet behind Malfoy, who had just bent down over a small witch, probably a third year. She’s lying on her back, tears rolling down her cheeks as she clutches at her side.
His blood had been pounding in his ears so loudly he could hear nothing else, but Malfoy’s voice slowly became clear as Harry’s body calms. He can hear the same soft incanting that Malfoy had done for him on the battlefield, and the quiet, almost frenzied, muttering, fills his mind as he blacks out.
Harry gaped, staring wide-eyed at the map. He’d disappeared right before his eyes! He wasn’t going to let Malfoy off that easy, though. This was just proving that he was up to no good, and Harry would catch him in the act. He put out the Lumos on his fingers, making up his mind.
Malfoy’s eyes darken slightly, and he tilts his head to the side. He presses his lips together in a way that makes it look like he’s stifling a smile, and his teasing tone confirms that. “Sure, Potter. But I need to be in there, too.”
He pushes the door in, taking a careful step inside. A sad smile pulls at his lips as he takes in Sirius’ room. Malfoy moves with him, and ends up crowding Harry slightly in the doorway.
Harry watches him, head tilted. His hair is messier than Harry's ever seen it. Malfoy looks up at him and Harry smiles without even thinking. Malfoy looked young. Sweet, almost.
Harry’s wand dropped to the floor, clattering on the stone as he rushed to Malfoy’s body. He fell to his knees, his eyes wide and breath coming in panicked bursts. He barely noticed the sharp pain in his knees from how hard he’d fallen- he was too focused on Malfoy. The boy’s body was barely illuminated by Harry’s wand, lying on the ground behind them, but Harry didn’t need much light to see the dark red blood oozing from the blond’s arm.
Harry opens his eyes, the smile he hadn’t known was on his face only widening as he stares at Malfoy. “The bath is great, Malfoy. You picked good scents- are they from the oils?” He attempted to divert the vain man’s attention by talking about his expensive bath products- he seemed to take them very seriously.
"How innocent." Malfoy's voice holds no mocking, just teasing, and what seems like curiosity. Harry turns to him, confused, and blinks at the strange look in Malfoy's eyes. Had he put him off? He hadn't meant to.
“Yes, well,” Malfoy says airly, “if you’d like to stay alive, you might want to stay on the good side of this pervert.” He smirks sharply at Harry before turning and making his way out of the bedroom.
Harry grimaces at the too-loud voice, squeezing his eyes shut before he reluctantly tries blinking them open. They feel heavy, like lead, but he manages to get a half-lidded look at Malfoy, a red-faced and blotchy Malfoy who hovers by his side, before they flutter shut again.
Harry startles, turning back to the stairs and proceeding up them as Malfoy begins to walk again. They reach the second floor, where Malfoy turns down another hallway, finally stopping in front of one of the many nondescript doors.
“Why, Potter, how very astute of you,” Malfoy said with a smirk. “Yes, they are the oils. Sharp Spearmint and Bottled Storm, they’re called; I can show you if you like…” He rambles on, talking about the differences between Muggle and Magical oils, how the scents are collected, and what benefits they have for the skin. “The mint makes your skin cooler, so it’s good for a fever, but it’s actually mainly used for sex,” Malfoy concludes. His cheeks pinken quickly as he realizes what he’d said, and his eyes dart to Harry’s, which are locked on him.
No matter. All he can think of at this particular moment is the blinding pain in his body. He stifles a grunt, pressing back against his hero. Even looking around had hurt. He squeezes his eyes shut, trying not to think about the pain.
He groans softly, bracing a hand on Malfoy’s chest to push himself up. Unfortunately, another dizzy spell hits him, and his fingers flinch closed, tightly clenching the soft fabric of Malfoy’s shirt as he struggles to stay standing.
Harry almost moves away from the cold hands, feeling the blond's magic under his skin, making its way down to the deepest part of the gash and slowly healing it. He winces, his body rejecting the foreign magic. This doesn’t feel good.
He looks up, and their gazes connect. Malfoy’s eyes are wide, and his cheeks, pink. He looks away, staring at the book in his hand like it was the most interesting thing in the world. “I just think blue is nice,” he says gruffly.
The tall blonde rolled his eyes. “Yes. You will be getting clothes more suited for the Manor when we get there.” His face spreads in a cheeky smirk. “You have to be on my level.”
A whispered word. Harry can feel the sticky blood on his wounds disappearing, and he blinks, eyes feeling less weighed down. He sits back a little bit, head spinning.
He slipped out his wand, whispering an incantation over the drink before drinking it in one gulp. It burned satisfyingly as it went down.
An almost mocking laugh spouts from the tall, lean boy as he approaches the bed. "Another war will happen. The wizarding world depends on their savior to get them through it. I'm the best Healer in training at Hogwarts. I've been helping everyone, and you need it more than most."
Harry, who had instinctively readied his wand and dropped into a dueling stance, let his hand fall limp to his side. He shifts out of his lowered position, his eyes locked on the shaken looking blond.
I decided I didn’t want to wait to publish another chapter hahaha! There won’t be much focus on Pomfrey and the hospital stay, but that will be next chapter. If you have thoughts, please leave a comment!!
Harry couldn’t look at Fred’s body, or any of their faces. This was his fault. Fred had died because of him.
“There are wards, so we’ll need to go together,” Malfoy says lightly, turning to face Harry. His eyes trace over Harry’s face, and Harry’s blush deepens. Malfoy’s lips curve into a slight smile, but he turns to face the fireplace again to let Harry recover some of his pride.
A groan sounded from farther into the room, and he stepped towards it. His wand illuminated a body on the ground. Malfoy’s body.
Harry walks the cold, empty halls of Hogwarts with no mind to where his feet are leading him. The smell of blood, of death, is heavy in the air.
The image of Malfoy stays in Harry’s mind. His hair had been a wreck, his shirt sleeves shoved haphazardly up his arms. He looked bad. Harry huffs out a short laugh at the thought, knowing he probably looked loads worse. The laugh quickly turns into a fit of aggressive, shuddering coughs, and Harry curls in on himself, his hands shaking as he clutches them to his heaving chest. Everything hurts.
Harry blinked, tearing his eyes from Malfoy’s retreating form. He stared blankly at the girl next to him, her face screwed up in a scowl.
Harry stares at it, confused. He blinks and his gaze flickers up to meet Malfoy's. The smile on Malfoy's face quickly fades, the dimple disappearing.
The light sounds of a party carried through the ballroom- laughter, murmured conversation, pleasant music, the clinking of glasses. Draco was focused on none of it. Pansy had finally unattached herself from his arm, and was flitting around the room, socializing. She lingered by Granger’s side, and Draco caught a glimpse of her hand ghosting over the girl’s bare back.
Malfoy lets out a long suffering sigh, and Harry sends one more smile in his direction as he picks up his bag.
Green eyes lit up, and a smile stretched across Harry’s face as an idea occurred to him. He reached into his robes, feeling around in the inner chest pocket. His grin widened when his fingers closed around rough parchment- he drew the Marauder’s Map out into the low light, murmuring “Lumos'' as he did so. Soft light emanating from his fingertips, illuminating the paper.
Harry begins to unbutton his shirt, almost shy. He clumsily pushes it off his shoulders when he's done. He lets Malfoy pluck it off the bed, folding it neatly before setting it aside.
The scrape of a chair dragging against the floor has Harry raising his eyes. Malfoy settles down in the chair, facing the other boy. He opens his own book, mulling through the pages as he says, “Soul injury information, Horcrux information.” His striking silver eyes glance up to Harry’s. “There’s not going to be a straight answer for this, I think we both knew that coming in. It’s never happened before, after all.”
He let out a tiny, choked sound, and Ron looked up at him. He put a large hand on Harry’s knee, making Harry look up at him. Ron’s mouth was set, his cheeks streaked with tear tracks. But still, his lips lifted crookedly in a broken smile. His other hand was clasped with Hermione’s, and she was looking at Harry too. Both their eyes were red, and they were holding onto each other for dear life.
He flinched away from the hand. Clenching his teeth together, he shoved himself up to his knees, whipping around to face the other boy. "What did you say to me, Malfoy?" he growled. His palms were sweating, and he felt a little bit dizzy. "This better not be some sick fucking joke!"
Harry is gently set down on a bed, where he finally opens his eyes. Seconds pass as he blinks hard, trying to make the pounding in his head stop. "Who are you?" he utters, voice sounding like sandpaper. The man is standing, back facing Harry, and looking at something, from what Harry could see.
Harry let go of Malfoy’s arm, pushing himself to stand. He stepped over the boy’s body, so he was on the side of the wounded arm, tearing his tie off. He knelt back down and pressed his tie to the wound, gently lifting Malfoy’s arm over his thighs as he did so.
Harry inclines his head slightly, his gaze staying on Malfoy for a few more seconds before he turns to the door of the living room and strides out. If Malfoy didn’t want him to worry, fine. They weren’t friendly anyway. He heads straight for the staircase, lost in thought, but turns back when he realizes he doesn’t hear steps behind him.
Hermione cleared her throat, and Harry’s eyes snapped back up to hers. He hadn’t realized they’d been locked on Malfoy. His cheeks heated slightly, and he glanced away from her penetrating gaze.
He smacked his lips, glancing regretfully down at the now empty and unhelpful glass, which blurred slightly as his eyes unfocused. He blinked, hard, before looking up- right into bright green eyes. His hand dropped to his side as he stared, wide eyed, right back.
They go through the floo in the headmaster’s office. Harry steps in first, with a call of “Number 12 Grimmauld Place!” The bright green flames engulf him, and as they die down, he glances around at his dead godfather’s living room.
Malfoy hums quietly in response, his finger tapping on the handle of his wand where it rests in his lap. “Muggle orchestral music is my personal favorite,” he says, smiling slightly. “My mother used to play it for me, and we would dance.” His voice is slightly wistful, and he looks up at the mural.
Malfoy sets a few jars next to Harry's head, and opens one, spreading the gel from inside of it generously over Harry's back. It smells distinctly of mint and cools his skin so quickly it feels almost sharp.
He reached the tray, which held amicably still as he plucked one of the delicate glasses from its surface. He nodded slightly at it before glancing down at the liquid he held. It was deep orange, and he could smell that it was pumpkin juice, and unspiked pumpkin juice, at that. Unfortunate. Alcohol was what he needed.
He’s exhausted by the time a small paper bird flits up to him. He lifts his hand, and it lands on his finger, chirping at him before it folds open.
“Yep!” Harry grins at Malfoy, reaching under the bed to grab one of Sirius’ bags. He begins to shove the clothes into it, ignoring Malfoy’s gaze on him.
Her scowl widened, and she shook her head. “Never mind. I never expected you to be such a… a git! I’m going to go dance with someone who WANTS to dance with me!” With a huff, she stormed away, towards a small group of tall Beauxbatons boys.
Harry can feel the heat of Malfoy’s chest against his back, and has to suppress the urge to lean back against his chest like he had when Malfoy had carried him off the battlefield. The blond was muscled, but gentle. And fuck, did he smell good.
He reached back to the door, his blunt fingers settling slowly onto the shiny silver knob. He turned it gingerly, pushing the door open to reveal… a dark room. Cold, too. He shivered as a gust of cold wind hit him in the face.
He pulls his pants back on, picking up his shirt and turning to face Malfoy, whose face was cold as he stared at Harry with those stupid impassive silver eyes, his stupid mouth pressed tight. He had stood up, his arms crossed protectively over himself.
“So, Malfoy,” Harry says, slightly more comfortable, “Why no green? I would’ve assumed your room would be chock full of Slytherin pride.”
Harry rolls his eyes, turning quickly on his heel as a blush rises in his cheeks. “Let’s just go. Pompous man.”
Malfoy gently presses his finger against the bruise and Harry flinches. "Shh," he murmurs to the younger boy. "Hold on." He cups Harry's jaw as he presses against the bruise, lifting his chin and murmuring a few soft words. He waves his hand over the bruise before placing his fingers against it again, letting his magic flow into Harry and heal him. When he feels the skin fully mend, his eyes open and he gives that ghost smile to Harry again.
He thinks the ground was shaking but...It seems to be him who is. His body is shuddering every few seconds, teeth clenched together and eyes squeezed shut.
The blond rolls his eyes. “Let’s go to Grimmauld Place. You can’t get into the manor without me, so I should just come with you. It makes the most sense.”
if you enjoyed this chapter, or have thoughts, suggestions, comments... please leave a comment or a kudo!! i would LOVE to know!!
He eased his hand under Malfoy’s knees, and slid the hand holding his head up, to his back. He steadied himself before standing up, lifting the boy easily. He glanced confusedly at Malfoy’s haggard form- why is he so light? -but made his way to the door anyway. Malfoy’s bony elbow poked into his ribs, his head slumped heavily against Harry’s shoulder.
Malfoy lets out a hard laugh. “I’m your only hope then, Potter. The roles are reversed after all this time.” He rubs a hand across his bruised face, sighing. “We’ll go to the Manor.”
There was a pool of it surrounding Malfoy, and Harry could feel the dampness on his pants where he knelt in it. He ignored the lurch in his stomach, grabbing Malfoy’s forearm with both hands. “Malfoy!” he gritted out, staring down at the pallid face beneath him.
Harry nods and flips over, and Malfoy traces his muscles with long fingers, eyes closed, checking Harry's magic. He stills as he gets to the center of Harry's chest, his brow furrowing- he presses down hard, sending a sharp wave of magic into Harry, who winces. Malfoy whispers a soft spell that Harry couldn't hear, and his fingers trace a shape over Harry's chest. He gently pokes and prods at the same spot, whispering quiet incantations, before stopping completely.
He forces a slight smile for Ron, patting his shoulder once before turning back to Molly. She had returned to staring forlornly at her lost son, half of a pair, tears slowing trekking down her face. Harry put a gentle hand on her shoulder, pressing a kiss to her cheek and standing up. She glances at him, seeming to understand. He turns to Hermione, whose face was upturned to look at him. He brushed a tear from her cheek before turning and striding back towards the door.
Moderately graphic depictions of suicide attempt! No actual description of the attempt, but the method (slicing open arm) is described in order to show Harry helping. I don’t personally think it’s super gory, but it may be for you!! Please don’t continue if this will be triggering or harmful to your mental health. Enjoy the chapter!
Finally he halts, doing a slow scan of all the bookshelves before he turns to Harry. “I think I have everything for now, Potter.”

(can you tell i've been into sickfics lately)
Malfoy swallowed, hard, managing to open his eyes the smallest sliver. He stared at Harry blankly for a long second, before his eyes fluttered closed again.
His head swings left and right, sizing up the two directions he can go. He decides to venture to the right, first. The hallway had 3 doors, besides Malfoy’s, and ended in a large picture window. He starts with the door immediately next to Malfoy’s room, but all that reveals is a linen closet. One touch of the fabrics shows their quality. Harry draws his hand back from the sheets, shutting the door quite quickly and moving on.
“Here,” Harry says. He stops in front of a closed door, shooting a glance over his shoulder at Malfoy. He grimaces at what he sees.
He shifted gingerly under Malfoy’s arm, gently lifting it off of his thigh and onto his still chest. He slid a hand under Malfoy’s neck, cupping the base of his head in his careful hand. He cautiously began to lift the boy to a sitting position, but was interrupted by a pained groan.
He looked up at Harry, his bright silver eyes holding the green eyed gaze, nearly magnetic. “You're missing a part of your soul." His voice was harsh as he practically spat the words at Harry.
The blond steps out of the living room, glancing at him. “Did you need me to come with you? Are you not a big boy who can go on his own?”
Harry pushes through it all, whispering apologies as he presses past all the people he knew. His beacon is the bright red hair he can see bowed over a body in the middle of the room.
Hermione’s eyes turned concerned, and she looked at Malfoy. “Don’t worry, Harry,” she offered. Her voice was soft, and she placed a hand on Harry’s arm, careful to not touch Malfoy. “Pomfrey should be here any second. It’ll be okay.”
The two boys have finally begun their research when an unexpected wrench is thrown into their plans.
“Potter?” Malfoy says, his voice scratchy and low. “Do you need something? Food? Why are you…” He squints at the man crouched at his feet, his eyes slowly becoming more focused. “Why are you out of the bloody bed?”
Bright light pierces Harry’s eyelids as he slowly comes to consciousness. He groans, a sharp pain shooting through his head as he rolls gingerly to the side, away from the migraine-inducing glare. His throat, dry and raw, aches as he opens his mouth slightly. He tries to call out to Malfoy, but all that he can produce is a pitiful moan.
“ Malfoy places his hand on top of hers for a moment, and she stills. Her eyes are locked on him, wide and glassy. She sniffs once more, quietly, then squeezes her eyes shut, curling a hand into Malfoy’s shirt.”
Harry adjusts himself, pillowing his cheek on his folded arms, which rest on the lip of the tub. He watches Malfoy’s face, his expressions. The way he twirls his wand in his fingers mindlessly.
He fully enters the old bedroom, which he’d always wanted to make his home. He starts with heading towards the wardrobe, opening it to a plume of dust right in his face. He begins to cough, waving a hand in front of his face to disperse the allergens. Malfoy, on the other side of the room, lets out a chuckle, which he covers with a cough when Harry turns to look at him incredulously.
Harry presses his mouth together, the cold reality of who he’s talking with washing over him once again. He knows Malfoy can feel it too. He lets out a breath, trying to let go of that. The anger, the hatred. Malfoy can help him, and he’d changed. Harry had to change too. He resolves to have an open mind- he was the one at stake here.
Harry’s breath sticks in his throat as the fire engulfs him. Malfoy had dropped his hand. The familiar feeling of his stomach twisting as he went through the Floo is stronger than usual, and he instinctively reaches out, stiff fingers closing around Malfoy’s forearm. He doesn’t get a look at Malfoy’s expression before the two drop into the large, ornate fireplace of the hall of Malfoy Manor.
He stepped inside, closing the door behind him. He lit his wand with a wordless Lumos, glancing around.
Malfoy's eyes open and his pupils dilate as he stares at Harry. "You need to relax, Potter," he bites out, voice tense. "I can't do this if you don't. Relax." He stares at Harry for a beat longer than necessary, eyes closing as he focuses back on his magic. His eyebrows pull together faintly as he starts muttering faster, the incantation seemingly getting much more complicated.
Harry glared at Malfoy. “I’d rather not leave you alone in my godfather’s house. You can come with me.”
The voice is just as smooth and cool as everything about the person holding him, words murmured softly, the voice sounding preoccupied. Their breath smells of mint and iron; blood and ice.
Harry reached behind him with one hand, trying to find his wand on the floor while still holding the open wound shut. His hand was covered in blood, making it slippery, and he wouldn’t be able to get a grasp on his wand even if he could find it.
Malfoy looks up, eyes flashing light grey. His eyebrows raise a fraction, lips parted. He seems...surprised Harry would allow him to help. A shadow of a smile passes over Malfoy's face, but it's gone before Harry can catch more than a glance.
As his shirt drops to the floor, he hears the door creak. He instinctively curls in, covering his bare chest with his arms, but Malfoy’s eyes are covered. “Sorry, Potter- Just wanted to bring in your bag, so you have clothes to change into.”
Malfoy’s hand is like a balm on a burn. It subdues the pain, just slightly, and Harry pushes closer to it, his eyes closing. He lets out a deep sigh, his senses dulling as Malfoy’s magic slowly pulses into him from where his long fingered hand rests. Harry knows that pulse matches with Mafoy’s heartbeat- is one with it.
Harry narrows his eyes, wanting to defend himself, but he was in the wrong this time. This man in front of him wasn’t the mean-spirited bully he’d known. He had no idea who Malfoy had become.
Malfoy's eyes flash up to meet Harry's, both intense gazes caught. Harry's eyes flicker down to Malfoy's lips, as he had started to spell another, smaller, gash shut. He was almost done now, Harry thinks. He can feel the twinge of Malfoy's magic making itself known inside his body, almost at his skin.
Malfoy looks somber, molten silver eyes boring into Harry's with an intensity Harry didn't understand. He blinks and shakes his head, trying to clear the fog.
Malfoy does, gently closing the door behind him as he comes inside. He settles on a bench Harry hadn’t noticed when he came in- it’s by the door, a few feet back from where Harry was slumped against the wall of the tub.
Harry watches those hands as they rifle through the worn pages of books. Some Malfoy sets on the desk, and others go back on the shelf.
Now that things were less desperate, he scrabbled on the floor, grasping for his wand. Barely there light was still coming from its tip, which he brightened with a murmured word as he grasped his wand. “Scourgify,” he said softly, pointing the glowing wand at Malfoy’s cheek. The blood was wiped off his face, leaving him clean, if still a bit sweaty.
hey guys! :D this chapter’s been awhile coming, huh? i’m very excited about it, and i hope you are too! please, enjoy!! <3
Harry smiles slightly. “I feel better now, Malfoy. I was wanting to take a shower, but I found your bathroom- could I use that?”
Harry just looked at her, shifting Malfoy slightly in his arms. The boy’s breaths were steadier, though still shallow, and his uninjured hand was resting against Harry’s chest. His fingers twitched against Harry, and the boy looked down, eyes wide.
Harry grimaces, looking away as he yanks his shirt down fully. “A piece of Voldemort’s soul attached itself to me when his killing curse rebounded. I had to die to kill it. I did.” He runs a hand through his tangled curls, turning slightly away from Malfoy. He could still feel his eyes. It was unnerving.
Malfoy’s face relaxes slightly, and Harry can see tension leaving him. A returning smile flashes across his face, quickly settling back into a neutral expression. But his eyes… they were soft. Grateful.
Harry shifts on his feet, considering the question. Finally, he speaks. “I should stop by Grimmauld Place.”
Harry glances around the room again, noting the lack of any doors other than the main one. No ensuite for the Slytherin prince? Seems unlikely… But still, he steps quietly past Malfoy, to the door to the hallway. He turns the knob gingerly, squeezing out of the room while making as little noise as possible.
His thoughts are interrupted promptly with Malfoy’s rearrival. He holds a stack of fluffy towels, and a plush looking emerald green robe is slung over his arm. He drops the items onto Harry’s lap.
"No. Potter!" The word is sharp as they pull Harry back against them. "Stay there. Keep against me. We're going to go somewhere. You need to stay still."
The warm water soothes his aching muscles, and the soft music that begins to play soothes his mind. Malfoy hums along to it quietly, and the situation feels… intimate. Maybe even uncomfortably so. But, Harry supposes, that’s how it goes when you have a mysterious magical ailment that you’re trying to solve with your childhood nemesis, who apparently became a good person and Healer-in-training in the year you were out of school.
His sweat has, by now, dried in a distinctly uncomfortable layer all over his skin, and he cringes at the feeling.
He grabs his pants, knowing he's being too rough, knowing he's being illogical, but not knowing how to fix it and not really caring anyway.

He shook himself. Hermoine had been tortured here. Voldemort had held meetings in this room. Was Draco Malfoy pretending he couldn’t recognize him the most important thing? Why did his mind go to that? Harry let out a sigh, then turned back to Malfoy. They should start setting up.
Harry’s eyes flutter open and he sits up, pressing a hand to his forehead. He’s clammy, his skin cool but covered in a thin sheen of sweat. Other than the discomfort from that, and the many blankets piled on him, he feels fine.
Malfoy looked at him, scandalized. “You don’t even use a certain bubble bath? Or an oil?” He gasps dramatically. “No Gryffindor red bath water?”
His voice is stilted as he responds. “My mother loves me. She’ll do most anything for me.” His eyes flash to Harry’s as if daring him to say anything about what she wouldn’t do. “My father is going to Azkaban. We both know it. It’s just a matter of a time until he’s captured and brought into custody- they will have fled to one of our other estates.”
Malfoy sighs, his eyebrows drawing together. “Let me check you, then. You seemed fine before,” he hesitates, “the incident of last night, so we need to be safe.”
The hands on his arms move slightly, cupping underneath them so as to support him. They were only needed for a moment, though, as Harry forced himself away from the other boy, staggering slightly to slump down on the bed again. A quiet moan makes its way out of his mouth, and a bout of nausea has him violently retching.
Malfoy finishes a few seconds later, his words speeding up as he looks back at the wound. His last word is a soft whisper, a puff of air escaping him as he leans back, a single drop of sweat tracing down his cheek.
“If a Horcrux, a piece of a soul, attached itself to you, it could bond with your soul, especially over 17 years… And then when that Horcrux dies, is ripped away, what would happen to that piece of your soul?” Malfoy’s voice was near frenzied, one hand buried in his white hair, the other waving in the air. He resembled Hermione when she got passionate about something.
Malfoy drops his bag onto the desk with a thump, and Harry realizes his mouth had been hanging open slightly as he stared. It snaps shut, and his gaze locks on Malfoy who, again, is completely ignoring him.
The silence stretches between them, and Harry drops his head back onto the floor of the bathroom, staring at the ceiling. There’s an intricate mural painted on it- or maybe it’s a spell. Either way, it’s beautiful. The depiction of soft clouds and sparkling stars in a dark night sky almost make him dizzy.
He smiles slightly as he reads the message written in elegant cursive- “I’ve done what I can. Mediwizards have taken over. Meet me at the Astronomy Tower. D” He sets off for the tower, the piece of paper tucked in his pocket. As he reaches the top of the stairs, he glances around.
Malfoy places his hand on top of hers for a moment, and she stills. Her eyes are locked on him, wide and glassy. She sniffs once more, quietly, then squeezes her eyes shut, curling a hand into Malfoy’s shirt. He pulls out his wand, beginning his incantations. Harry shakes himself out of his reverie, turning around to walk out of the Great Hall. He spares a glance back at Malfoy and the little girl, a sense of pride gently warming him.
Harry took a breath. His wish had been granted, so he needed to take advantage of it. He took a few steps forward, just a breath away from whatever Malfoy was plotting this time around. He reached out, his hand shaking just slightly, but stopped before he touched the door. The Marauders Map, which had been clenched in his slightly sweaty hand, needed to go away. He tucked it back into his robe, pulling out his wand as a second thought.
Harry starts up the stairs again, hearing Malfoy’s slow steps behind him. Each wooden step creaks under his weight as he stiffly makes his way up. He can feel Malfoy just behind him.
Harry turns, watching the fireplace intently. Is he going to try and attack me? He backs up slightly, his heel knocking against one of the pieces of covered furniture. He grunts, pulling out his wand and holding it loosely at his side as he shuffles around the furniture.
Once his eyes are on him, he can’t look away. Malfoy is staring at him. The grey eyes dart away from Harry’s, and Malfoy’s eyebrows draw in slightly. His cheeks and ears pinken slightly, and he lets out a huff of a sigh, and speaks.
this chapter is very much filler, but i wanted to give harry and draco some time to get comfortable around each other as they work on this project of theirs. i hope you enjoy!!
Periodically, he glanced at Malfoy’s face and chest, trying to see if he was still bleeding. He kept applying pressure as he shrugged his robes off his shoulders.
He opens his eyes slowly, his vision blurry. His head lolls back against the solid surface below him: a shoulder. An uninvited tear trickles down his cheek and he can feel himself shaking again, cool hands soothing down his back, feeling around for something.
Malfoy laughs, a tired sound Harry had never heard before in his life. His green eyes flash to Malfoy's grey, and Malfoy looks away, pressing his lips together.
His steps echoed on the marble floor as he walked briskly down the hallway. Malfoy had only been gone for a few minutes, he couldn’t have gone far.
“I solemnly swear I’m up to no good,” he said softly, holding the map close to his chest. Letters and shapes began to appear on the paper, spreading like fresh ink. He scanned the map hastily, his eyes finally falling on the name he was looking for. “Draco Malfoy” was pacing, tiny black footprints going back and forth a few times- then the name disappeared.
He steps gingerly into the room, setting his bag down on the floor, near the wall. Out of the way. He does the same to himself, folding his arms in and standing near the door, silent. His eyes continue to take in the room, picking up small details as Malfoy goes through his silent coping. He notices the blanket- it’s tucked in at the bottom of the bed, but left slightly messy near the pillows. He also sees that the bookshelf closest to him has what looks like only poetry books, including those by Shakespeare and Poe. This surprises Harry, and his eyebrows raise, his eyes darting to Malfoy.
Harry's eyes flew open and he tensed, his gaze locked onto the floor of the room. Malfoy's words were echoing around in his head.
“Do you want to listen to music or something, Potter?” Malfoy breaks the silence of the room to ask. Harry glances lazily over at him, his straight back and crossed legs, and smiles.
About half an hour later, Malfoy sits back. Harry can feel drops of sweat from him on his back. "The magic inside you was much harder to clear than I thought. You had a few bad spells caught before they really reached you, but that weakened your wand core while you were using it. It should be back to normal now. Now, please flip over."
Harry could feel the brokenness. They had to grieve, as a family. He wouldn’t worry them with his issues.
Malfoy pries her small hands away, murmuring softly to her, words Harry can’t hear. There’s blood there, a dark stain on her crumpled white shirt. Harry’s eyes widen as he watches her tearfully sniffle and grasp desperately at Malfoy.
His mouth drops open, and he spins, marching quickly into Malfoy’s room. He nudges the other boy, crouching down next to him, a twinge of regret hitting him as he does so. He doesn’t really want to wake him, but he also doesn’t want to use his bathroom without permission.
Malfoy turns fully this time, a wide smile on his face. “I never would have guessed,” he teases, setting another book down on the desk.
Malfoy’s nose wrinkles as his eyes blink down to the clothes before coming back up to Harry’s. “Are those what you’re choosing?” he asks. His voice is wry.
Malfoy’s shoulders are slumped, and his eyes look exhausted as he stares at the grains of the floor. The scrape on his cheek is inflamed, slightly swollen and red. Harry rips his eyes away, taking a deep breath. Pitying Malfoy will do nothing.
He jogged through the halls, watching his own name approach the spot Malfoy had disappeared. He finally reached it- just an ordinary section of hallway. His eyebrows drew in, a frown pulling at his lips. He turned around a few times, scanning the walls. There was a tapestry of a horrific looking troll on one side of the wall, and a stretch of plain cobblestone wall opposite it.
She attempted a weak smile, reaching one arm out to him, the other gripping tightly to the other twins’ arm- George. Harry stumbled over, barely aware of his surroundings, and sunk down to his knees next to her. Hermione, Ron, George, Arthur, and Ginny were all there too, no words passing between them.
He opened his eyes, lifting his hands. They dripped with the fresh blood, and the wound still gaped wide, blood seeping from it. White fat was visible underneath the red liquid, and Harry felt bile rising in his throat as he looked at it. He grimaced, staring down at Malfoy’s chest instead- still rising and falling, though barely. If magic couldn’t help, he could at least use the first aid he’d learned.
Malfoy’s cool breath ghosts over Harry’s cheek. His presence is comforting, warm and solid and steady, and the tension leaches out of Harry’s body.
Harry collapses, wand dropping from his bloody hand: he is exhausted. Sweat-dampened, messy black curls stick to his neck and forehead, pink lips bloodied and bitten, eyes hardly able to open, weighed down like bricks.
He stopped by a large stone pillar on the edge of the room, falling against it as his head swam. He squeezed his eyes shut, gritting his teeth. He NEEDED to go through with it. So he would. And he would do it right away, before anything else could distract him.
He began making his way to the other side of the room, searching for a head of white-blonde hair, or a flash of rich looking, black robes. Bodies pressed in on him, chattering loudly and attempting to get his attention. He muttered acknowledgments, mostly ignoring them as he pushed past.
Harry’s lips quirked up slightly at the thought, imaging how Malfoy would react if he said that out loud. The blond had stopped talking, but he was clearly still thinking. His eyebrows were still drawn together.
He begins to cast, his voice still rough with sleep. His wand moves in a twirl, he says a spell, and then he pauses as he interprets whatever the results are. They aren’t visible to Harry, though he’s sure he wouldn’t understand them, even if they were.
Harry makes his way over to the bed, settling down on the edge as Malfoy peruses the bookshelf closest to him. The blush had faded. How unfortunate.
He sits down on the bed. "Sit up, please," he murmurs. Harry does and closes his eyes as he waits for the dizziness to subside. "Vulnera Sanentur."
Harry laughs, a loud laugh that seems to surprise Malfoy, whose eyes snap up to Harry’s before a smile pulls at his lips as well.
The magic snakes down into Harry's cut, trying to heal it with threads of intent Malfoy had sent, but it isn’t working. It does hurt though. Harry grimaces, flinching away from the sharp, needle-like pain. Malfoy sends him a lethal look before frowning and pulling the magic back. "Stay still, Potter," he instructs. His magic prods back at Harry's cut, Harry forcing himself to stay in place, and Malfoy nods. "There it is." He sets to work.
Harry blinks, looking blankly at Malfoy’s face. Shouldn’t they keep working? His thoughts are interrupted as his stomach lets out a low rumble, and he glances guiltily at it before looking back at Malfoy. The blonde smirks.
Hours pass, each moment slowly dripping by like honey. The two boys sit in comfortable silence, occasionally piping up if they find something of interest. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen very often.
Once he's done with the gel, he begins with his magic. His fingers gently press and prod at the expanse of skin that is Harry's back, sending tiny sparks to tell him what injuries there were. There was some bruising, a few superficial cuts, and some residual magic inside him, but that could be fixed moderately easily. The magic would take the longest. Malfoy tells Harry as such before he begins the next stage.
Harry sighs, shoving away the stupid thoughts once again. He didn’t have to be mean to Malfoy, but pitying him was no help either. They were here to do a job.
Harry rolls his eyes, letting a small smile grace his face as he turns back to the large wardrobe. He glances over the clothes inside, grabbing a few sweaters, as well as simple shirts. He turns to the bed, dropping his selections on it. He glances up at Malfoy, doing a double take as he sees the absolutely affronted expression on his face as he stares at the pile of tops.
hello again everyone!! :D i hope you enjoyed the first two chapters, we’re getting closer to the real plot!
He tore a sleeve off his robes, using it to bind the wound together, the tie still pressed against it. Gryffindor red and gold had become solely red. Once that was done, he pressed a hand to Malfoy’s cheek.
Harry stared down at Malfoy’s face, watching shallow breaths escape him. I should move him out in the hall. Nobody will be able to find us here.
Harry blinks, his arms loosening from their tightly crossed position. He hadn’t realized he’d drawn in so much. He huffs out a small laugh. “Shut up. I didn’t want to disturb your things.”
The fast clicking of heels against the stone corridor got louder as Harry shut the door behind him. He turned, glancing down the hallway in the direction of the voice- Hermione’s. She appeared, her eyes locking onto him.
“Yeah.” Harry is lost in thought for a moment, but feels compelled to speak again. Something in Malfoy is drawing the words out of him. “I think the first time I realized I loved red was when I was really little. I got a bright red scarf my cousin Dudley grew out of, and it was the warmest one I’d had. And I would tend to the fires for my family when I was a kid. I loved to stare into the flames. Wasn’t allowed to very often, but I savored it when I could. It was warm.” He hesitates, his jaw clenching slightly as he remembers his cupboard. “Hogwarts was warm too. Comfortable, and loving, and warm. So, yeah, I love red.” Harry smiles ruefully at nothing, feeling Malfoy’s gaze on him. “Not just for house pride.”
Harry steps up next to Malfoy, glancing sideways at him. He was still smiling, a small dimple in his right cheek making itself known.
His skin was sallow and clammy to Harry’s touch, his parted lips tinging purple, his eyes shut. His light brown eyelashes fanned over his cheeks, and his eyebrows were relaxed. He almost looked calm, though he was nearly on his deathbed.
Harry took a breath, about to say something, though he didn’t know what, when Malfoy’s eyes flashed up to his, filled with revelation.
He nudged the door open with his foot, grunting as he hoisted Malfoy higher in his arms. Blond hair tickled his neck as the boy’s head slid closer to it, and he could feel Malfoy’s uneven breaths against it as well. He shivered slightly.
Malfoy lets out another laugh. "I won't judge you, Potter. I'm sure you're very fit. The girls have been drooling over you since you were eleven, after all"
A cool hand suddenly touches his face- it feels like water after a hot day in the sun, refreshing and cool and soothing. The thumb touches his lip, gently, almost fearfully. Another hand is at the small of his back, pressing softly and pulling him up into a lap, comforting.
The boy’s silver eyes were barely visible. His eyelids fluttered, the normally bright pupils a blanched grey.
Harry rolled his eyes, letting out a huff of a laugh as he pulled his shirt’s sleeves onto his arms."The fuck do you think Saint Mungo's is gonna do?” He starts to pull the neck hole over his head. “I had a fucking Horcrux inside me, though of course they would never have known that!” He grunts, shirt half on, and realizes, a bit late, that Malfoy didn’t actually know that before. He looked up at him, gauging the look on the blond’s face.
There’s a desk, covered with papers and books, all coated in a thick layer of dust. A window sits directly behind the desk, casting the room in soft light.
Malfoy lets out a loud sigh, closing his book with a snap. Harry glances up, his chin resting in his hand. He smiles bemusedly at the sight of Malfoy, slumped down in his chair, his head lolling back. Those grey eyes were half lidded, and focused right on him.
Malfoy shakes his head slightly, closing his eyes. When he reopens them, the strange expression is gone, replaced with a determined look.
Nothing much had changed. Pieces of furniture are covered in white sheets, casting a ghostly air in the room. Paintings hang along the walls, extravagant gold frames holding them. The house was once worthy of a wealthy socialite family, but it had become a shell of its former glory.
“Harry, I called for Madame Pomfrey, she’s on her way. I didn’t know how severe the… the situation…”
Harry peeks over his shoulder, wondering what was in the room. Even though he’d been expecting a bedroom, what he saw still surprises him.
He gently sets the bag on the floor just inside the door, closing it again, and Harry lets out a breath. He shucks his pants off as quickly as possible, along with his underwear, and slides into the tub, which is almost filled. Magical speed, he thinks with a smile.
Though his mind is fuzzy, Harry knows something is deeply wrong. He feels wrong. His chest aches slightly, as does his head. Through the fog of Malfoy’s sedating magic, Harry can feel their heartbeats thrumming together.
Malfoy’s blond eyelashes flutter, and he blinks a few times. He looks well rested, at least. When he sits up, his face pressed with the folds of his sleeves, and wipes at his eyes, that’s all Harry was thinking about. That he looks well rested. Not that his hair is slightly mussed, and he looks softer when in large sweaters like the one he had donned at some point in Harry’s episode. Not that at all.
"Good. Two more bruises." He repeats the process with a bruise on Harry's jaw, and one just under his eye. Harry sits through the whole process, fidgeting with pent up energy, eyes going to different spots on Malfoy's body as he waits. When Malfoy tells him it's over, he sighs.
"Good. The bruises will be easiest, so I'll start with those." Malfoy leans forward to inspect Harry's forehead, the scent of his sweat and soap enveloping Harry, who sits stock still, staring at the neck of Malfoy's shirt, which is cut low enough to reveal a pale chest, littered with scars. Malfoy's voice breaks the silence of the room. "Lean forward a bit, please," he instructs, his voice professional, but not cold.
He stretches again, linking his fingers together and pressing them towards the ceiling, groaning quietly at the twinge of discomfort in his upper body as he does so. He pulls each arm across his chest, and does a few various other stretches, testing each limb and muscle until he’s satisfied.
Harry's intensely green eyes turn to Malfoy. His cool fingers are hovering over Harry's deepest wound, on his side. He doesn’t seem to be holding a wand.
He tossed the Floo powder in, and grabbed Harry’s hand to tug him forward into the flash of flames. “Malfoy Manor!” he calls, his voice slightly unstable.
Harry studies Malfoy as he looks to the side, rummaging through a bag. His skin is pallid, his lower lip bloody. He has a small cut under his eye, bruises on his high cheekbones, dark marks around his throat. He looks terrible. Harry tilts his head, regarding the bully he'd known most of his life. It felt like he didn't know him at all anymore. His gaze travels farther down Malfoy, examining his lithe frame. He'd gotten rather fit.
A soft chuckle comes from the blond as he returns to his task once again. Moments pass in comfortable silence, and Harry watches Malfoy’s graceful movement around the room as he amasses a pile of around six books, stacking up on his desk.
"There we go. You're okay. You're gonna be okay." The voice mutters quiet missives, almost too quiet for Harry to hear, and Harry realizes he can't hear anything but that voice. He pulls away, just the smallest bit, looking around them. A man holds him, and around them is an almost clear bubble, silver veins of magic running through it.
He’s hit with dizziness, and stumbles forward, the force of standing up and gravity getting the better of him. He’s stopped roughly by long-fingered hands grabbing his arms, digging into them slightly, and his head thumps, hard, into Malfoy’s chin, forcing a pained breath out of the taller boy and fully stopping Harry.
Harry smiles to himself at the thought, but it fades quickly. Keeping his pulse because it could have faded away is not such a pretty thought.
Harry’s eyebrows drew together and he yanked his hand away from Malfoy’s face, forcing the thoughts from his mind. He glanced back down at the boy, at the sticky red handprint on his face, and blanched.
Harry’s nose scrunches at the nickname, and he reluctantly closes his book, gently setting it on the bedspread. Malfoy stands from his chair, reaching up and stretching deeply. His shirt lifts slightly, revealing a strip of pale skin and a dark pink marr on it. Harry blinks, his eyes flashing up to Malfoy’s. The boy cracks his neck and drops his arms, covering the scar Harry thinks he saw.
"Lie down, please," Malfoy says, voice slightly softer than before. When Harry does, he can almost feel Malfoy relaxing behind him. He peeks over his shoulder, watching Malfoy pushing his hair back again. He takes a deep breath, hands tangled in his silvery hair, steadying himself. Harry turns back to the pillows in front of him, a smile pulling at his lips.
Harry rubs at the back of his neck, staring hard at the ground. He didn’t want Malfoy in Sirius’ house. His people had killed Sirius. But… Malfoy wasn’t part of that group.
Harry trails behind Malfoy as he strides confidently through the elaborate mansion. They leave the dining room behind, walking through twisting hallways lined with doors. All are closed, except one. It lies adjacent to the bottom of a staircase, with double doors cracked slightly open. Harry peers into the room as Malfoy begins to ascend the stairs.
Malfoy murmurs a few quiet words, his hand still buried in Harry’s hair, and Harry can feel his consciousness fading.
Long, tense minutes pass. Harry gets more and more on edge, pacing the room.After what feels like a lifetime, the fireplace roars with green flames. They lick up the brick before fading away to reveal Malfoy, whose face is shadowed. There’s a new scrape on his cheek, red and aggravated, and what looks like the beginnings of a bruise.
He broke eye contact with Potter, shaking his head slightly and glaring at the ground. He was so stupid. That whiskey may have been too strong. He stumbled slightly as he turned to walk away, and his eyes darted back up to Potter’s. He could feel his ears and cheeks warming as their gazes connected once again, and he tore himself away to weave through the crowd. The drink had hit him far faster than he anticipated. Finding Potter attractive? He was surely drunk. Would he still be able to go through with it?
