The smallest blonde simply grinned in response. Narcissa sighed, though her features were fond. "Such a wonderful influence you are Lucius. Anyway, you'd best get going now little Dragon. Cabins look to be filling up quickly."
After a bit of time looking, Draco eventually stumbled upon Vincent and Gregory in one of the forward cabins in the train, sitting quietly with a smaller boy staring blankly out the window in the seat across. Tousled brown hair, the slight smattering of freckles on his still fairly rounded cheeks and though he couldn't currently see them, bored, disinterested looking eyes of solid black. It had been a while since Draco had last seen Theodore Nott, and judging from the awkward and slightly pleading looks both Vinny and Greg were giving him through the glass, the smaller boy was likely still as frigid and biting as he always was. A natural-borne arse if you will.
"Now, hold on a minute. Take your time, I'm not chasing you away." Draco spoke, feeling a smile come to his own lips. "I was just curious is all."
The woman merely gave him a dismissive wave of her hand, drinking her tea now right out of the pot. "Simple, shuffle the papers around a bit. Choose one of every four or five, pass it and fail the rest. Think of it as mental training for when you eventually have to choose between who lives and who dies."
But no matter what she did, for all her gifts, none of the other kids ever liked her. Said she was bossy, mean, insensitive. Said that she made everyone else look stupid and silly in comparison, even she was trying so very hard to make it better. To raise them up so that they could stand at her side. So they could be friends. But they never recognized her efforts.
Then, movement in the corner of Draco's eye, a copy of the daily prophet landing right in front of Flint and Pucey, a girl standing above them, younger with straw blonde hair and a soft white pallor. Her lips pressed into a line, and her shoulder tense as she turned towards another similar looking girl standing at her side before locking gazes with Flint.
One day, you might envision muggles stepping onto a space rock for the first time in history. On another, you watch a man get mauled to death by a Wyrm or a child perish of smallpox."
And the blonde outright giggled at that. “Sure. I guess that could technically happen.”
----------
Lucius let out a scoff. “More than understandable. I recall barely even being able to tie my own laces my first day at Hogwarts. The boy’s clearly just excited darling, there’s nothing to be concerned about. I think the new look is just fine. Regardless,” and it was at this point Lucius reached into his robes and pulled forth a pocket watch. Clicking it open, he continued. “It is already 8:30, and if we want to grab the best cabin on the train for Draco, we’re going to have to leave now. The Crabbes and Goyles are probably already there as we speak.”
And truly, Draco could only blink in response, watching as the other boy held his gaze with a truly stubborn sort of glare. And well, he guessed the fact that he was getting chummy with a couple Gryffindors was certainly out of the ordinary, even more so when one considered the fact that one was a blood traitor and the other, the slayer of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Not that he could be blamed for any of it, Potter sought him out on his own and the other Slytherins had essentially abandoned him to Longbottom in potions, so Draco was discounting any and all responsibility in himself that gave way to the given circumstances.
They had named the owl Cetus, because apparently she was even bigger than was normal and because of her utterly beastly personality. Draco had had Cetus for nearly two months before heading off to Hogwarts, and he never once managed to even properly pet the bloody bird, because it would always try to nip him. To be honest, he would have preferred a much calmer owl in hindsight, but his parents had been so impressed with Cetus’s sheer size and majesty that Draco had been essentially forced into taking her, under the assurance that she’d start to mellow out over time.
Off to his side, and seemingly completely unaware of Draco's sudden internal screaming match, Madam Pomfrey also gave a hum of thought.
And with that, Narcissa took Draco by the hand towards his stack of luggage. Then, grabbing a single leather bag from amongst them, she pushed it softly into his hands, a quirk upon her lips. “Your new school robes from Madame Malkins. Be sure to treat them well, we even had them spelled to grow alongside you as you get older. You’ll also need to change into them while you’re on the train, so keep that in mind as well.”
And please look out for my new Voltron Fic that'll be coming out soon. Take care all and please, let me know what you guys think!
The blond could practically feel the heat radiating off of the other boy now, the sensation of a smile slowly forming across Draco's lips. Turning his head up to meet the ginger's gaze, Weasley's cheeks had indeed slowly started to take one very apparent shade of crimson.
The purpose of having a partner across the way was to ensure each student had a frame of reference to compare themselves to, as well as a flying buddy once in the air. Though the idea of pairing students in an inter house fashion was frankly just asking for an accident to occur, particularly considering, in this instance, it was Gryffindor and Slytherin.
Seemingly unaware or more likely utterly indifferent to the glare Draco was now currently giving her, the Witch pressed on.
"My Gods Lucius, that's what you have to say. No skill whatsoever." Narcissa spoke, rolling her eyes towards her husband before turning towards Draco. "Now things may see scary and intimidating at the moment sweetie, but soon you're going to be having so much fun, learning new things and meeting so many new friends -."
And besides, it wasn't Draco's fault he was now technically ahead of the the majority of his classmates. It was all Drake's doing really, thanks to his arrival and the merging of their collective memories, Draco found that all the basic practical skills Drake used to possess in his original timeline, were now quite plainly also ingrained in him. Meaning that even though he may be in the same knowledge level as a normal first year at Hogwarts, in practice, he was actually likely at least a couple skill levels ahead, at least in terms of muscle memory and the management of his magic. And Draco, to be perfectly honest, was far from complaining.
Drake was silent for a moment.
"Potter!" The Professor called out then. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
Leaning back into the chair, Draco heaved a small sigh and rolled his eyes. "Relax Weasley. You look about as red as your house and hair. I'm just messing with you. What do you want?"
Draco was silent for a moment. "I'm not even going to try and understand what you just said just now. And instead I'm just going to correctly assume it was something dumb."
And with a start, Draco threw himself from his bed, a scream caught in the back of his throat, the image of crazed golden eyes still fresh within his mind. With a resounding crash, he tumbled off the edge of his mattress, hands reaching out frantically for purchase only to grasp at the covers which then fell alongside him. The pain of the impact sending a wave of shock and clarity through his mind, as he slowly and with great effort, sat himself up.
And not just about one single thing. But about anything and everything. A whole world full of novelty, curiosity and countless amazing secrets practically begging to be unearthed. It was like she was in a wonderful dream, where all was good and she had the chance to start over, except in this case it was all real. Then classes had begun, and the dreamlike haze gave way to reality.
There was only a single sconce that illuminated the area, and the shell of the light was twisted at an odd angle so that the light only shone directly onto the table itself and in the outward direction of the main section of the library. That in turn, resulted in the entirety of the area beneath the sconce to be left in relative darkness, which was also exactly where Draco liked to sit. It was quite frankly, the perfect spot to brood, preferably menacingly, but also served as a convenient location for studying in relative peace.
Using his one free hand, to brush one owl and then the other, Draco awkwardly began the process of pulling forth the letter Drake had had him write, a set of strings already pre-tied to allow for ease of attachment. Bringing up the letter then, Draco began to ever so gingerly loop the string around Cetus’ leg before a voice spoke up directly at his back. He would never admit it, but with a yelp, Draco spun on his heels to face the speaker, the owls at his back immediately taking flight at his sudden move before renestling in another coop further up and across the way.
“Ah, my sincerest thanks.” Dumbledore replied, giving the room one final smile before slipping out the door, only to pop back in a moment later. “Oh and speaking of thanks, do try and give one to Mr. Potter, Draco my boy. He was the one that happened to find you and alert the prefects of what happened.”
What are horrid nightmare, he thought to himself, rubbing at his face then to clear the sleep from his eyes and sweat from his features. It had been a while since he had had a nightmare as bad that one. Next time, no more reading Hogwarts a History right before bed, though fantastic, some of those stories were downright terrifying. Thinking of those eyes again, he felt a shiver go down spine. Creepy.
Draco felt his eyes grow wide.
“Well that’s certainly a new look. Trying to change things up on your first day hmmm?” His mother smiled, watching him then as he bounded down the steps of the manor’s grand staircase, his luggage piled neatly at her side. Reaching the bottom, he rushed forward, his mother catching him in a hug just as he came to a stop. He laughed in her arms, before pulling away, smiling up at her as his father joined them in the main hall, the last of Draco’s luggage floating alongside him.
Silence. "Merlin, what kind of teacher are you!?"
------------
“M-M-Mr. Malfoy, a-ar-are you al-al-alright?”
Mostly looking at the initial section with Ron at this time. Please let me know of any thoughts or criticisms!
(See the end of the chapter for
The woman merely hummed in acknowledgement. “But anyway, as I was saying before. I do certainly hope you weren’t planning on using your own owl for this little plan of yours. They’ll be far too easy to trace back, especially with the amount you plan on sending in the future.”
"So we just, leave him alone?" The idea was almost unthinkable.
The school was beautiful, colour everywhere and oozing character in every crack, painting and facet of design in the structure itself. The tapered ceilings added a depth and scale of height to the structure that made Draco feel even smaller than he already did, suits of armor, gleaming and on guard at every main corner and painting that moved and spoke to you, when asked or prompted, or even sometimes without prompting at all. Everything just seemed so new and exciting.
Lunch together then? No. Everyone always eats at their respective house tables, and she didn’t want to break any rules, so that wouldn’t work. So then what could?
Malfoy shrugged noncommittally. “Because I don’t want to.”
Clapping Draco on the shoulder, Lucius smirked. "Only matters if he ends up getting caught. Isn't that right Draco."
THIS CHAPTER HAS BEEN REWRITTEN CUZ I DIDN'T LIKE THE FIRST ONE VERSION ENOUGH. Okay that's it.
“Oh, sorry Mother. Got distracted for a moment.”
"He saved him!"
A couple weeks after the start of classes, Draco felt that he was finally starting to get properly settled into schooling here at Hogwarts. The classes were a breeze and the experiences thus far with the rest of his new housemates has been for the most part rather pleasant. He had most of his classes with Vinny and Greg, and a few with Pansy so he wasn’t wanting for company in any capacity..
Sorry for the late reply folks! Life hit me real hard and I fell Ill, but I am recovering now and am back to updating!
"Did you hear about what happened to the Boretails?" Greg spoke up during lunch a couple of days later, Vinny at his side looking equally conspiratorial as they both leaned in close towards Draco from their opposition across the table.
Glancing idly at her nails Trelawney made a face of displeasure. "
------------
And Draco jerked back so hard from the reaching limb that he stumbled onto his rear, shuffling across the ground in sudden dawning terror. Immediately, Quirrel moved to follow, calling out towards Draco, though the sound of his voice was suddenly too soft, too muddled to hear through the roaring in Draco’s ears. Without relent, the professor pushed onward, advancing towards the blond just as Draco finally got to his feet and without hesitation, threw his body into a run.
Then movement, a shape leaping from the cart, wand cutting through the air intermingled with streaks of purple. The light revealing a face, cold and hard and young and pale hidden beneath a hood, as the doors were were blown from their hinges and the man rushed forward.
Know-it-all. Teacher’s Pet. Egghead. All words and statements she had heard countless times, in countless situations. Her greatest gift, her greatest curse. She just wanted to help. She just wanted everyone to do things the way they were meant to be done. The right way. The proper way as the rules and instructions had said and explained. Was that really so bad? She was just trying to help. And helping was good, wasn’t it?
She found herself doing what she always did. Her nature to excel, rapidly earning her her teacher’s praise, and her classmates’ scorn. And it was like nothing had changed between this world and her former, until she started hearing talk of someone else.
Thankfully, Draco had been struck with a bolt of inspiration in the middle of their conversation. And instead of simply outright rejecting her, which was what he had tragically resigned himself to do, Granger herself had provided him an even better solution. A challenge. Now he just had to play his cards right, and -
Off to the side, he could see his parents upon a conjured set of chairs near one of the alcoves one the right side of the Hall. Still within clear sight of the front of the chamber where the sorting was to take place, but far enough out of the way, to keep too many prying eyes from focusing too much upon them.
Turning towards him, his mother crouched down to meet his height. “Alright now Little Dragon, one more hop and we’ll be right by the entrance. Do you think you’ll need a bit before we go?” She asked, absently patting his robes. Currently, they were standing within one of the smaller desolate side streets along the path to Kings Cross, with the Station itself already within sight. “I know you’re not exactly fond of apparating.”
Decidedly dejected and just distinctly peeved after Drake’s conversation with Trelawney, Draco set himself down in huff on one of the benches in his first class of the day: Potions. Arguably the class he had been looking forward to the most before event starting at Hogwarts given his personal fondness for making things and the fact that it was taught by his Godfather, it truly was rather tragic that he all of a sudden found himself in simply too bad of a mood to even try to look forward to it.
"The kind that's aware that teaching Divination is a sham but isn't about to let free pay and lodgings go unclaimed." She said with a small clap. "Now hop to it, those papers aren't going to mark themselves."
And with a roll of his eyes and an aggravated sort of huff, Draco took off, the sounds of his fellows and Madame Hooch calling out to him in an outrage as he split from the rest of the class and towards the indicated tower as fast as he could. Stopping easily, he pulled forth his wand from his sleeve just as Longbottom appeared overhead, broom rushing onwards past the top of the tower, and the statue at its edge, as the other boy's cloak snagged itself against the spear of the figure. Now dangling perilously several meters up, Draco watched the cloak tear almost in slow motion as Longbottom hung there for a moment, dropped a bit and then fell.
And Harry took his hand, and they shook on it.
Standing himself up, he made his way over towards the loo, being careful not to trip over any of the scattered covers he had brought along with him on his tumble down. Getting to the sink, he stepped up on the small step ladder his parents had graced his bathroom with, and moved to examine himself in the mirror. Grey eyes. Chubby cheeks. Blond hair. Breathing a sigh of relief, he acknowledged that everything at least seemed fine. He couldn’t afford to be sick today of all days after all.
Draco replied, brows furrowing in now steadily growing concern.
Hermione’s ears were on fire, as she took in the blonde’s words, her mouth gaping in shock and sheer indignation. Oh the nerve of this arsehole. Was he actually insinuating that he was better than she was? Hadn’t he heard anything at all about her from any of their other classes yet? “I-I only need a little more time! You saw me in class, I nearly had it at least four times before McGonagall dismissed us all.”
Idly dipping a cookie into her tea, Trelawney spoke without turning towards Draco. "Because that too is part of the gift of Sight."
Glaring absolute murder towards the other first year, Hermione gritted out. “And what makes you so sure of that? You never know, I could score even higher than you in this upcoming assignment and then who’ll be the one laughing.” She scowled.
Registering Draco’s words, the boy mumbled a quick reply. “W-Wha-What makes you so sure?”
-------------
---------
"..... Hooch put me here.... You'll be fine.... Why do I have to move?"
Running up to the wall after her, Draco immediately ran up towards the stone. With an excited energy, he pushed his hand up against the cool surface of the wall and watched in amazement as his arm simple went into it. Seeing this, Draco let out a giggle and pushed himself forward, face meeting the stone with no impact whatsoever.
Locking gazes with Longbottom as the bigger taller pureblood touched the ground, Draco lowered his wand and spoke.
"Only to the short-sighted and un-informed." The witch responded, finishing one cookie and realizing that the tea in her cup had run dry, moved to outright drop another directly into the teapot itself.
"Hullo. Impressive flying for someone who's never been on a broom before."
“Draco. And yeah, we have. Thank you for that again by the way. Now pay attention, or Snape’ll yell at you again.”
Mouthing a thank you to the elder Witch, Draco gladly reached out to down the potion. Drinking the entire solution in one fluid gulp before handing the vial back to the matron of the ward. Instantly, he felt the potion start to take effect, and his dizziness began to subside along with the sensation of warmth steadily growing from within his belly. Beyond the taste, the sensation was quite pleasant, and helped him put on a bit of a sheepish smile as all the other relevant adults in the room moved to gather around his bed. As they did so, a voice spoke then, loud and clear, deep within his mind and very much not his own.
"We plan to be prepared. And we suggest, as Slytherins and fellow purebloods, you all do too."
But Draco figured he had time and even a living cheat sheet so to speak so he wasn't too overly worried. His friendship with Harry was progressing fairly well and he had even managed to keep any incidents with Nott to a fairly healthy minimum as of late, which was always nice to reflect about.
Slowly, Draco nodded in response, feelings torn about his entire experience and all the information suddenly thrust upon his shoulders. He knew that the right thing to do here was tell the people he trusted that a strange man has somehow established residence inside his head. That he had been making him see and hear and know things, he had never heard of or was ever supposed to have heard of before. And that he insisted that he was in some way shape or form, supposedly Draco’s future self come back to the past, with totally no intention of potentially overwriting the fabric of Draco’s being. Hah.
"A little!? How am I even supposed to mark these?"
“The correct name Mr. Potter, would be the Draught of Living Death.” The Potions Master drawled then. “But your answer is acceptable. And a point to Slytherin, for helping your fellow classmates. Don’t think I didn’t see you give the answer to Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy.”
From there, the rest of the sorting was a blur of movement, with the revelation of the Sorting Hat and the calling of First Years one after another. Until inevitably, Draco himself was walking down the path, seeing Neville sitting awkward but happy amongst the red and gold lions off to his left and his parents waving towards him on his right. He watched as Severus gave him a nod and Dumbledore a smile as he set himself down upon the stool at the front and the hat was dropped upon his head.
“Alright mother.”
"-every other week." Draco blinked, the very tail end of a comment made by his mother just barely registering to his senses. "Or at the very least one letter a month. Sound reasonable?"
And Potter's features pinched at the very mention of the title, nose scrunching and brows furrowing before promptly smoothing themselves out. "Eh. They're going good! I'm enjoying all of them so far, but potions is definitely my favourite. It's just like Chemistry."
"Nope. Legitimately outed by a paper with supposedly no contact with them whatsoever." Another older student spoke up from beside the Slytherin captain, -
Alright, have a good one folks and thanks for reading. Stay safe out there y'all!
“It is what you get Mr. Malfoy, when you mix too much nerves, excitement and no sleep the night before.” Madam Pomfrey added, a single brow raised and a quirk to her lips, as she walked back to rejoin the group after having left to put away the empty potion container. Draco felt himself go a little pink, he had gone to bed fairly late last night.
Hopping down from the step ladder, he moved to draw himself a bath. As he did so, a soft pop, sounded off near his side, and he turned to take in the sight of one of the family's house elves standing confused by the vanity - Dober, Dodson, Dodo?
“Okay. Uh, thanks. I-I’m Harry, I think we’ve met already I think?” Potter replied awkwardly, his lips turning upwards slow and hesitant, but there nonetheless. And as the strangely nice Slythering moved to turn away, he paused for a moment to let out a groan.
Well. Draco legitimately did not have a response for that. Of all the ways he had been expecting this particular conversation potentially progressing, being called out and absently disparaged by a Weasley was definitely not one of them. And just for being a Slytherin too likely, and a Malfoy, when they technically barely even knew each other. Okay, he was starting to feel a little insulted now actually.
Alright, have a good one folks and thanks for reading. Stay safe out there y'all! And Happy Hols!
But Drake had pointed out rather quickly though, that doing so would only make it harder for the both of them in the long run, at least for now. He was a Slytherin, she was a Gryfinndor. He was pureblood and she was a muggleborn. He didn’t know how aware Granger happened to be in regards to blood and house politics, but it was clearly not enough to inform her that establishing any sort of relationship with Draco would only put the two of them into a totally unnecessary state of danger. Especially considering just how prolific the Malfoys happened to be in darker circles.
Though, that was not at all to say that everything was going absolutely perfectly of course, given the fact that he had ended up assigned to a room with Nott of all people, and the fact that Drake and Trelawney had him writing letters legitimately everyday. It was like homework, but even more tedious and quite honestly rather concerning, considering some of the subject matter listed within each of the parcels.
"In fact. We can start right now."
Quickly moving to catch his bearings from the unexpected answer, Weasley returned his scowl back to the fore and leaned bodily the front Draco's table, looking down upon the other.
“That’s the spirit.” Came the prompt reply, his mother once again offering her hand for him to take. Without hesitation Draco took hold, glancing towards the Station proper just a few streets away. Turning back to his mother he asked.
The first thing Draco opened his eyes to, as he gradually came to consciousness was the fact that there were several people in the same room he happened to be in, followed shortly by the acknowledgement that he was in the Hogwarts hospital wing, a location that he knew logically that he himself had never been to, and yet was so innately familiar he knew immediately where he happened to be, given the ever present scent of herbs and medicinal draughts that permeated the area.
"Yeah! What kind of silly name is The Golden Dragon anyway."
Feeling a nudge at his side, Draco turned to look and take in the sight of a taller rounder boy fidgeting quite awkwardly in place. Eyes turned towards the front and seemingly unaware of bumping into him just now. Medium length brown hair, brown eyes with chubby sort of cheeks and two large front teeth he was using to very effectively brutalize his lower lips. A name came to mind quickly and without preamble, as well as a series of emotions and thoughts surrounding the larger child.
There. She had asked and given solid logic and support behind why it would benefit them both to work on the assignment together. Now once, he said yes, all that they would have to do then, would be to find a proper time and a day on the weekend that both happened to be free and -.
“D-Deep br-breaths now, M-m-mr. Malf-f-foy. In an-and out. In a-an-and out. Take your ti-tim-time.”
She was starting to see red at this point. She never knew it could just bleed into her vision like rain down a windshield. “So you’re saying I’m not worth your time then? I’ll have you know I’m already at the top of the class in almost all of my subjects and have always been top of the class ever since I was little.”
And the sound of retreating footsteps began echoing down the hall, the clicking of heels against stone initially clear before growing faint and soft and disappearing entirely. Without preamble, Trelawney spun on her heels and carried Draco back into her classroom at the end of the hall, taking one, two, three steps in before without any warning, dropping Draco right onto his arse in the middle of the room, the blond landing with a crash.
"Don't worry son. Everything's going to be alright." Lucius smiled, placing both hands atop Draco's shoulders. Warm and stabilizing. "You are a Malfoy remember, and Malfoys can handle anything. You're  going to crush this year little Dragon."
Next Chapter: Ron!
His mind supplied. But how? How could that possibly be the case here? Guilty, he was feeling guilty? For what?
Drake had essentially just sold his soul to Trelawney and logically Draco had been less than appreciative of that fact.
And Longbottom still wouldn’t sit down, so after a brief moment of anguish Draco bit out a, “Sit down Longbottom.” Finally convincing the taller boy to settle into the seat. This was awful. This was terrible. This was supposed to be his favourite class, and now he had to spend the entire time, getting ribbed by his own housemates while being surrounded by Gryffindors. This was by far the worst first day he had ever had.
“I prefer the term proactive in this particular instance. Considering the danger we are inevitably likely to face and the chaos our little games should bring. It is to my understanding, that I am to help you with these missives and when the time comes aid young Draco here in mastering his own skills in being a seer alongside yourself. Am I correct?”
What?
The adults in her life called her gifted. But she knew now that that was just a softer word for 'other'. But maybe, she thought, setting down her quill, eyes darting to her side, just maybe, not so other anymore.
“Of course.” Lucius smiled. “I wouldn’t dare miss it.”
A shake of the head, and the briefest hint of a frown.
"Uh. N-nice weather we're having eh?" Potter suddenly spoke, and Draco couldn't help but let out a laugh at the sheer awkwardness of the attempt.
Scowling and indignant, Draco wiped his face clean with his sleeve and moved to cross his arm across his chest with a petulant grumble. For a moment, he entertained the idea of just not telling her, of walking out right now and leaving her hanging, but inevitably thought better of it, knowing it would probably be more trouble than it was worth. And besides, he did kind of legitimately need her information.
Ever so slowly, Granger’s eyes raked up the page, scanning the sheet for any form of error till inevitably she tore her gaze away, her furious glare cooling and cooling until eventually a look of defeat crested across her features. Her fire sputtering out, and complexion paling ever so slightly. “One hundred.” She repeated then, acknowledging the number for what it was before taking in a deep breath and spinning on her heels to return to her own assigned seating. However, just as she was about to leave range of earshot, Draco leaned back in his seat, and spoke, hoping quite sincerely that this gamble would work.
Stopping for a moment, Narcissa bent down to crouch at Draco’s height, hand coming to rest on his shoulder. “Alright darling, mother will go first, and you just do exactly what I do alright. It may look a little strange, especially with so many muggles around, but I assure you none of them will notice and nothing will hurt you. Right, now watch closely dear, I’ll be waiting on the other side.” She spoke, lips quirking upwards as Draco gave a nod.
"Perfect timing darling." Draco heard his Mother chuckle, releasing him from her hold just as his Father arrived. Immediately, a firm and comforting hand came to sit atop Draco's shoulder, Lucius smiling softly.
Draco could only blink in response, mind now suddenly racing a kilometer a minute.
"With love, supposedly." Trelawney drawled, voice oozing a distinct fake sweetness. "Though I figure it's probably the distinct blood magics his mother died to establish. But love just so happens to have a nicer much ring to it.
“And this Mr. Malfoy, is precisely why I told you not to drink the tea!” She spoke aloud, locking eyes with Draco then for just the briefest of seconds to take in the blond’s state, before turning her attention back towards her fellow staff member.
"Usually yeah."
“Oh little Dragon, barely an hour into your departure and you’ve already scared myself and your father halfway to death.” He mother spoke, shaking him in her arms, and tightening fast before releasing.
With a quick motion, Draco pushed his magic into the medium of his wand, muscles moving of their own accord in sure confident strokes as Drake spoke in mind and urged him to repeat.
And as the Headmaster slipped away, Draco’s eyes grew wide at the implications of that statement. Harry Potter had been the one to find his body? Merlin, this was mortifying. One of his childhood hero’s first encounters with him was finding him sprawled across the floor of a train cabin, dead to the world. Somebody end him right now. How was he even supposed to speak to the other at this point? More than that, what would all of his other classmates think?
and answered all the listed questions at the end of the chapter, on a corresponding parchment. This will be the first assignment for marks, do note. Dismissed.”
“R-Right!” Hermione spoke, rapidly picking up her items and bracing them against her chest. “Sorry Professor, have a wonderful weekend!”
“Sybill Trelawney? Why yes, indeed I am. And both of you are Draco Malfoy. Truly the world of magic is a wondrous and mysterious thing.” She spoke with a chuckle. “I’d never even imagined that at some point in my life I'd be dealing with time travel of all things. I really should thank you, the next couple years are all of a sudden looking so much more exciting because of the two of you.”
From where he sat atop the single wooden stool, in a vast expanse of white Draco observed as the other boy, paced back and forth entirely immersed in his own train of thought, words spilling from his mouth every so often as he mumbled and murmured on about things Draco himself had no idea how to even begin considering. Statements pertaining to his current manifestation, his apparent age, the effects of magic that could somehow cause a mutual possession.
"What? Oh thanks haha." The Gryffindor replied, raising a hand to scratch at his cheek. "I don't know, just feels natural I guess. You seemed pretty good yourself."
------------
Nodding at the statement, and gingerly pulling forth the note Drake had him write, Draco slipped by a few older student’s meandering down the halls before making his way towards the aforementioned room. Almost immediately his hand was rushing towards his nose at the sight and smell that greeted him upon entry.
“Of course.” The matron nodded, just as Dumbledore spoke up again, a smile on his features and small laugh on his lips.
Rubbing at his eyes Draco shook his head, silently focusing on his exasperation with his mind-neighbour to get his nerves down to manageable levels. Then with an explosive sigh, he let himself fall back and onto the pillows of his bed again, gaze trained on the ceiling of his bunk and surrounding curtains, eyes already long since adjusted to the dim lighting of the room. Then after a moment Drake spoke up again.
"The poor bastards got outed. Had their brooms ripped right out from under their tiny nads." Flinch -
"Only because I had practice. Not all of us are talented enough to just pick up a broom and fly perfect."
Blood draining from his face at the sound of her words, Draco backed himself against one of the nearby tables. "No way.... So then- the Dark Lord he's, so then he's -."
He thinks maybe he'd even heard his Mother and Father talking about it too at some point, how some families could go about and turn in on themselves when they find themselves struggling. His Mother in particular had been quite upset at the whole topic of discussion, and his Father uncharacteristically quiet and sensitive in comparison to his normally blunt and honest self. Sensing his reluctance to speak at the moment, Drake piped up after a moment.
And to be perfectly honest. If someone had asked Draco the same thing a month and a half ago, he would probably have said yes in a heartbeat. Because it wouldn't have been any of his business to intervene and could potentially have been hilarious.
And from his prone position still lying atop the grass, Longbottom merely gave a nod before promptly passing out, Hooch rushing over the second the boys eyes had closed to look him over for harm. After a quick scan and deeming no damage to have been done, the witch rounded on Draco.
He had been rather shocked, when she had approached him so suddenly a couple days ago, asking if he wanted to study together. He didn’t exactly what prompted her to undertake such an action, but he had been quite flattered when she had asked, and quite honestly had considered saying yes, if the exceedingly warm gut feelings he was having about her had been anything to go by.
Seeing this happen, Flint frowned towards his friend, brows furrowing in concern, but before he could speak the Carrows spoke again. "That's your Uncle-In-Law isn't it? Gibbon right? He's currently been sentenced to The Kiss in early December."
"And what makes you think that Weasley? What makes you so sure?" Draco replied slowly. "You don't know me. This is the first time we've even spoken to each other."
Draco mentally suggested.
Surprisingly, there actually weren’t as many nasty rumours he managed to pick up regarding his less than pleasant experience on the train, but there were a few and Nott quite specifically chose to exaggeratedly re-enact the event the moment his eyes had made contact with Draco’s across the room, arms flailing and waving daintily at himself. But that was Nott, and that was just what he did. Draco didn’t like it, but he had had to put up with worse before from the other boy when they were younger and their parents were still close.
"Quite a lot really." Draco spoke back, feeling colder now as the words the other spoke steadily began to settle in. Without a word, he slowly rose form his seat began to pack his things, steady and with measure, Trelawney's papers now long forgotten, a roaring thrum in his ears. "But considering your own family has turned their backs on tradition, I doubt a blood traitor like you could even begin to understand. Or maybe, that's simply because you were too poor growing up, you couldn't afford the luxury of learning how to read."
“I-.”
Dear gods, the smell inside the room was beyond rancid, and the blonde could barely even see the stone beneath his feet given the sheer amount of owl droppings and pellets scattered across the ground. A frigid breeze blew through the room then, through the glassless windows that the owls slipped and flew through, cutting right past the fabric of Draco’s clothes and causing the blonde to wrap his arms tight around his middle. Well there went his good mood.
Quiet! Draco mentally growled, he was insulted now and frigidly offended. And Weasley - Weasley started it first. Besides, Draco was leaving. He refused to suffer this self-righteous sanctimonious rat for even a moment longer.

"What the hell are you two on about -."
When she first arrived here at Hogwarts, she had been enthralled by the wonder and whimsy presented by an entire hidden world. Of the intricacies of magic, of how spells worked and how enchantments were made to function along with the countless potential practical applications of such mystifying arts. She had been abuzz from her head to her toes with excitement, to do what she loved most in the entire world - Learn.
"And therein lies our current issue, at least in some capacity."
Stopping in his tracks, the blonde whirled to face her, eyes wide and hands flying to his back in a clear attempt at hiding his letter. “What? Oh. It’s you Granger.” He responded, easing the tension in his form, before slipping the letter once again into the layers of his robes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Please, I'm sitting right here. I ask that you please don't talk about me as if i'm not in the same room as you Drake. It is rather rude you know. And yes, I can hear you. I do not know exactly why, but I believe it might have something to do with the fact that my future self was part of the botched ritual to send you back, as I've been aware of you for quite some time now."
------------
(See the end of the chapter for
"Wha-?" Immediately, the ginger looked taken aback, the scowl slipping from his lips at the flippant tone in Draco's voice. Obviously, then redhead had clearly expected some other sort of response. Probably a fairly biting one, given the apparent ongoing feud that the Weasleys and Malfoys have had for at least a few generations now. And Draco did think about it, it certainly would have been quite the convenient outlet for all the frustration he'd suddenly found himself dealing with so far.
The other boy sitting across from Draco looked to be around the age of one of his Father’s interns. He had sharp angular features, with the faintest traces of baby fat upon his cheeks, sharp almost silver grey eyes and messy platinum blonde hair that fell haphazardly around his face and across his brows. He was clad in a plain white dress shirt and a pair of strange blue pants, jeans, if he could recall correctly and muggle sneakers. He looked like one of those pompous pretty boy sort of blokes he’d seen before in some of the Daily Prophet tabloids, all dark and mysterious like and completely obsessed with how other people saw them.
A voice in front of him rapidly hissed, quiet as can be, and Harry’s eyes snapped up to take in the sight of the same blonde haired boy he had helped on the train the day before. Shaggy blonde, almost silver hair, framing round boyish features, and two deep stormcloud eyes.
Smiling back, and looking decently smug, the blonde replied. “Why thank you Professor.”
------------
"Ahh. Must have been the initial location of the Stone then. I knew it was somewhere in Gringotts." Trelawney replied, bringing a pastry to her lips.
Smiling at her words, Draco couldn’t help the laugh that bubbled past his lips. “Really? I look forward to it.”
All feedback is more than appreciated. Anything done well, anything that could be improved upon, please lay it on me haha. It feeds my motivation to work and better my story and storytelling.
“My, my look at the manners on this one.” Narcissa smirked, giving the boy a couple playful pokes to the ribs, causing Draco to descend into a fit of giggles. “Hasn't even been a day from home and already so mature. Alright, now let us away.” And they vanished with a pop, reappearing inside the curve of a small alcove along the old brick walls of Kings Cross. From there they made their way around the building towards the entrance, and slipped inside.
"Ugly blokes got caught Draughting last game and have now been officially disqualified for the rest of Winter cup and might even end up getting sacked from the entire League!"
Unsure of what exactly to do, buth hearing no counter from Drake, Draco gingerly placed the letter into the waiting woman’s grasp. “Fantastic.” She smiled, slipping the note in her mass of coloured shawls. “Now, while I have you both, and while I do happen to have the general idea of the plan you’ve happened to come up with, I do believe it prudent for us to discuss our distinct roles in this soon to be partnership.”
"But, shouldn't I be heading back to the dorms now?" Draco spoke, slowly rising to his feet and not at all liking the sight of a smile on the older caster features. "I'm really tired, and we have our first Flying lesson tomorrow morn. Can't be late for that."
Glancing towards one another, Lucuis and Narcissa  seemed to consider the option for a moment, before eventually coming to share a smile. “Very well. Considering this little devil here,” Narcissa spoke, gesturing towards Draco. “Had us inadvertently cancel all of our plans for the day, I do believe we could fit some time to watch the sorting into our schedules.”
“Hello there Mr. Malfoy. I’ve been expecting you.” The woman smirked, conjuring a small stool for herself to sit on as Draco continued to gawk, sliding one leg right up above the other and bringing her hands forward to rest her chin upon.
Stepping closer just ever so slowly Draco reached out a hand, fingers trembling just ever so slightly, due to the cold of course. And moved to slowly brush his fingers against the side of Cetus’s wings, features lighting up as he did so. She was so soft! Merlin, this was phenomenal.
Chuckling softly behind her hand, Narcissa moved to stand by her husband, observing the new style in amusement and with a critical eye. Gone was any trace of gel or mold, and instead a more laissez-faire sort of approach was used, with the long blond locks left to sweep along and frame her son’s face as they curled and coiled near the top of his head. “That makes the two of us dear. Though I am rather curious as to what exactly brought about this particular change.”
All feedback is more than appreciated. Anything done well, anything that could be improved upon, please lay it on me haha. It feeds my motivation to work and better my story and storytelling.
Then as heat blossomed across his cheek Draco leapt from his bed, eyes wide and ears ringing with the resounding echoes of a deafening crack. Breathing heavily, the blond grasped at his covers in an attempt to ground himself, head still spinning from the immediate ordeal, his cheek still stinging despite being aware that no mark would or could be found.
Across the room and now gravitating towards his bed, he watched as the figures of his very concerned looking parents, godfather and Albus Dumbledore moved in unison to the realization of his reawakening. Off to his side, and still very much holding the potion up to his face for him to take was Madame Pomfrey, a single brow arched expectedly as she swished the very clear Pepper-up potion she was wordlessly insisting he take.
Case in point: Longbottom shooting off without warning like a Cornish Pixie the moment Madame Hooch signaled their start.
the other stated, raising their hands up then in a calming gesture in response to the sudden expression of immense fear that blossomed across Draco’s features.
"Trying to bring himself back, yes. I personally don't know how, as I'm not exactly privy to how the stone itself works tragically but I'm sure he has some sort of plan." she finished with a shrug.
(See the end of the chapter for
And with a roll of his eyes, Draco continued. “And also because I know you are braver than you think, Longbottom. You’re going to make an excellent Gryffindor.”
"Oh? Not particularly fond of your popularity Potter?" Draco smirked.
"Well.... I don't know. They all still seem to see me as this great big somebody. Even Ron still kind of does, and he's the first friend I've ever made here. I just thought, well, you seemed like a nice bloke, helping me out in our first class with Snape and now saving Neville. I-I don't know." Potter stuttered for a bit, cheeks steadily reddening. "S-sorry, I should go."
“Y-Yes! M-m-master Draco!” the creature stuttered, head bowed low. “I i-is Dobby. Ummm, w-would Master Draco be wanting Dobby to draw his bath for him now, instead of himself?”
"That was so cool!"
Continuing to walk on, she made her way to the nearest junction relative to their class, a fork in the halls with a staircase to the left and branching paths to the right and onwards. Immediately she caught sight of a streak of silver at the edge of her vision and she was pushing her way forward towards the stairs. Climbing quickly in an endeavour to catch up, she spotted Malfoy dip out of the stairway into the floor above pulling what appeared to be a small parcel of sorts from his cloak. He must be making his way into the owlery, she noted, suddenly recalling that the coops were located in that general direction and on the fourth floor which Malfoy had just ascended to. Immediately, she was changing pace and moving towards a direction. If he was going to the Owlery then she could intercept him at the cloakroom stairwell.
------------
"That he is dear." Narcissa laughed. "Though let's both just hope he doesn't get into anywhere near as much trouble as we did when we were in school."
Another voice then, joined the first, low and gravelly, words trailing like a hiss with each spoken sentence.
"Yeah actually." The other first year smiled. "He seemed super scary at first like you said, but, I actually kind of like him. He's little mean yeah. And stern and nasty sometimes. But he's that way to everyone it seems and treats me like he does everyone else."
"I will! Talk to you both soon!" Draco waved, excitement bubbling up from inside him as he slipped into the train. Almost immediately, his eyes took in the sight of countless jittery first years just like himself, dragging their luggage along the path of the train. All of the slowly but steadily peeking into cabins before disappearing inside.
“But why? We would be able to finish the work faster, share ideas and get a far better mark than either one of us working on our own with how advanced the both of us are.”
“I shall see it done, Headmaster.”
Things had mostly been fairly uneventfully over the past little while. It had been a solid two weeks since his conversation with Weasley, and though he could almost physically feel the undying loathing and contempt the other boy was leveling at him with his eyes and face and general being, they hadn't yet had another confrontation like before which Draco was grateful for.
There was a pause for a moment, and Draco momentarily had the chance to wonder whether or not this was actually a good idea or not, given all the responsibilities he had in just a few short months suddenly found himself bearing. But then Potter had looked up, small shy smile on his lips and green eyes sparkling, and he said. "Uh, Harry. Just Harry."
And immediately Harry turned his gaze towards the front, "I- I think it’s D-Drug of Living Debt, sir." Harry said hesitantly, trying his best to recall the words exactly that the blonde had spoken. The room grew silent as all within absorbed the given answer, and once again Harry could feel the fire on his features. .
Practically feeling himself freeze up on the spot, Harry could do nothing really but gape at the shock of being called upon so suddenly out of the blue. As the second passed by, the snickers and whispers soon began to rise up across the room, and Harry could feel the heat building up in his cheeks as the Professor bore down upon him with his pitch black gaze. He almost didn’t want to speak out of fear of saying the wrong thing, but seeing as how literally everyone else in the room was staring at him now, Harry practically needed to get their attention off of him.
And Draco watched then, silent and intent as the girl slowed in her departure. Then she scoffed, back straightening with a renewed sort of vigour, still not turning back. “Please. Exams? Don’t think too highly of yourself Malfoy. All I’ll need is a couple weeks, just you wait and see.”
Then the doors to the foyer swung open, a resounding crash echoing throughout the silent atmosphere as a child, just barely younger than Draco himself, rushed into the space with a flurry of movement, their features a blur in contrast to the sharpness of the rest of the vision. But Draco himself did not have a chance to truly ponder this anomaly, as he very quickly found himself falling through the very ground beneath his feet, the whole around him quickly crumbling away as the child bolted up the stairs with a shuddered cry in their throat.
"They will be variable for the most part. Starting out fairly rare and mostly innocuous and then steadily increase in clarity and occurence over time, unless something drastic happens. We'll likely need to start teaching him how to handle them without spontaneously collapsing every time they come about, otherwise people will start to take note." She thought for a moment, gesturing with her fingers to float her cookie from its tea based bath into her mouth.
Sheepishly, Draco sat up properly in the bed, and raised a hand to rub at the side of his neck. “Hello, Mother, Father. Fancy seeing the both of you soon.” he said with a wry and clearly embarrassed sort of chuckle. He watched as his parents then gave others a look, glancing between themselves, Severus and Draco before Narcissa leaned forward and wrapped her around Draco’s form, tight and ever so shaky.
"No. No. That's fine. It's just, I thought you were really cool and I guess.... I guess I kind of wanted to be friends?" The other finished with a whisper, voice rising into a lilt before turning their face away, broom drifting off their parallel path ever so slowly. "It's, it's okay if you don't want to though. Boy-Who-Lived sort of hassle and all-."
A snap at the forefront of his vision broke Draco out of his reverie.
"Hey." Potter smiled, coming to a near perfect stop, causing Draco to raise a brow. Huh.
And at this point Drake grew quiet, the briefest flicker of something shooting through Draco’s mind as the silence awkwardly stretched on. Finally, Drake mumbled something unintelligible in response, which was impressive, because he was voice inside Draco’s head, and Draco’s didn’t even know that was possible.
“What do you want?”
She was currently sitting in one of the further nooks away from the entryway of the Owlery, her giant yellow eyes never leaving Draco’s form as tiptoed across the feces and remains to make it over to her position. Sitting in her little nook, she stood tall and eye level with Draco, the two staring each other down for a moment of two before Cetus all of a sudden cocked her head forward towards the blonde.
None of those sounded very charming to Draco, the blond thought with a grimace. He really hoped he didn't have to watch anyone die or go through something terrible, both because his conscience was all of a sudden so much louder than it had ever been and because it seemed like that sort of stuff had the tendency to really fuck people up if the way both Drake and Trelawney were taking things was anything to go by. And Draco really would rather not be ruined thank you very much.
It was at this point, that Malfoy began to smirk ever so slightly, and Hermione could suddenly feel a rushing in her ears. “Eh, I wouldn’t exactly go so far as to say both of us.” He drawled, lips curling into a smug sort of smile. “After all, last I checked I was the only one who managed to complete the practice spell in only a single class today.”
Draco also realized at this moment, that he also had had no idea what Harry Potter even looked like, save for the scar and that in some bizarre form of precognition, he immediately known that this tiny timid little thing was the Savior of the Wizarding World. But how? How did he know that? Why did he know that?
But just as quickly as the thought came, it was just as swiftly dashed, not out of any particular niceties or calls to politeness of course, but rather just due to the fact that Draco already had enough on his plate thank you very much. And making a rather bull headed, ignorant and narrowminded enemy, for the second time no less if Drake's memories held true, would just be utterly exhausting to deal with. He had Nott for that particular role already.

----------------
“Lucky git....”
“-But he didn’t! Therefore he should be right as rain in a wee bit of time. I will handle him. Please Quirinus, don’t tell Minerva or Severus, they’ll never let me live it down.”
There was silence for a moment, Draco tightening his grip ever so slightly, before Quirrel seemed to heave a sigh, and the sound of shuffling robes struck his ears as the DADA professor rose from their crouched position.
The room was lit by several hung chandeliers that dangled from the room’s vaulted ceiling, along with a pair of two wall mounted sconces that framed each and every window. It was currently evening from what he could see, given the dark cover of night that hung just beyond the light of the ward, and the presence of stars in the skies in the distance. Slowly, he braced himself on one of his elbows, feeling a wave of dizziness hit him for a moment before he suddenly found a potion stuck up to his face.
Narrowing his eyes the redhead responded. "I know enough Malfoy. You rich Slytherin purebloods are all the same. Sleazy greedy old families that toil with the Dark arts, wanting for nothing while at the same time stepping all over us smaller folk. Up in arms and raving about muggleborns for who knows what, despite all the horrible things your people have done to them. What's there not to know?" The other boy shrugged, looking almost smug as he moved to cross his arms atop his chest.
“It's Dobby, right?” He said, absently dipping a hand in the bath to test the temperature of the water. Watching him, with its large eyes, the elf jumped as it was addressed. Surprise clear upon its features.
"I saw Quirrel breaking into Gringotts Vault and attempting to steal something from Vault 713."
“Y-You as well, Syb-b-bill.”
Narcissa huffed. “Indeed. Are you sure you’re alright to go on with tonight dear? I’m sure we can make alternative arrangements should you wish, for the sorting and whatnot. It wouldn’t be the first time I've seen it happen.”
It was then at this point that Draco noted a shape hovering just ever so slightly at the edge of his periphery, shifting back and forth with a distinct nervous energy. Turning to see one Neville Longbottom, the taller boy gave the blonde the tiniest of waves before hesitantly pointing at the last open seat beside Draco’s form. Turning around to take stock of the situation, Draco was quick to realize that in has lack of awareness, he had inadvertently failed to notice that the majority of the other Slytherins had chosen to congregate near the back of the room rather than near the front when Drace had sat himself, and that he was now effectively surrounded by Gryffindors. Joy.
"Wh-what to do you mean? Isn't divination the school of magic meant to predict the future?"
------------
Though there hadn’t been any distinct recollections from Drake’s past, the innate knowledge Draco now held within him informed him that such a result was only to be expected of one Hermione Granger. And that even as a young fledgling witch, it was already clear that the potential she held would truly be quite the sight to see as the years went on.
It was interesting then, that beyond Madame Hooch herself, almost none of his other yearmates seemed to have any sort of apparent concern for the other boy. The Slytherins sniggered amongst themselves while the Gryffindors seemed to be watching the entire event unfold with expressions of awe, excitement and even envy. It kind of made Draco feel just a little bit bad for the other pureblood.
He loved the attention, he would very honestly admit. Seeing the professors' shocked faces as he easily managed to complete most of the first year practice charms and enchantments in record time, and the looks of sheer envy and admiration slowly but surely coming to be directed his way from his fellow student. The Gryffindors especially. Weasley's reactions were always quite distinctly amusing. It was as if every success that Draco had was a personal challenge and insult to the redhead, who would always either sweep out of the class complaining of the unfairness of the world into the Potter's ears, or be excused to the bathroom, hall or Hospital wing, after furiously attempt to match Draco himself, to often spectacularly outrageous results. But, Weasley right now was beside the point.
“Yes, but also no need to rush Draco. Take some time to get your bearings, your mother and I, and Severus are all right here.”
And Narcissa let out a laugh in response.
Such as the one he was currently writing as of this moment. It was a piece Trelawney had provided him details to, about some man currently fighting with his former friend for ownership of their shared company, warning him of how his dear old pal had apparently snapped and was now soon to make an attempt at something clearly rather drastic. Dear Merlin, what in the world could have happened to this man?
"No. Hagrid, the groundskeeper just can't keep a secret for the life of him."
And with a crack of motion, the figure was gone, the image of their face burned into the memory of Draco's mind, crazed, angry and terrifyingly familiar. And as Draco came to, with hands slowly sitting him up from his prone position against one of the walls of the hall, there it was again. That face.
And though Draco would never admit it, the sound of Drake's disembodied voice was exactly what he needed right now. The rushing in his ears and the pounding in his chest ever so slowly starting to calm as he promptly pulled his legs up beneath him and moved to bury his face between his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tall and pale and with an ever so slight shake in his smile, brows furrowed in apparent concern, clad in a plain brown suit and simple purple turban.
It took Draco less than a second to decide on what to do, and with a smirk gave both his fellow purebloods a wink and promptly walked on by. He did feel a little bad for leaving Vinny and Greg there to deal with Nott by themselves, but he would be back. Maybe, possibly. If he didn't end up finding Pansy or Blaise or Millicent or Daphne. Yeah, he really just didn't want to deal with Nott right now. Or ever.
"... Please Harry...... paired with Draco..... I'm ..... of the other Slytherins."
And a brief stint of silence overtook them, the two just idly, but also pleasantly drifting through the air as they circled around the field.
And with a flourish, Draco watched as his Godfather swept into the room, door slamming his wake and all sound and chatter quickly dying down as the Potions Professor stalked towards the front of the class, robes billowing menacingly in his wake. He really needed to get Severus to teach him how to do that. It looked so cool.
And as the other blonde gave an ever so casual sort of wave with their fingers, Draco felt pull at the center of his stomach, dull and soft before rapidly growing stronger and stronger before his vision when hazy and felt himself fall from his stool, mind still very much trying to comprehend just what in the name of Merlin’s blue balls he just went through and how in the world he was ever going to be able to make sense of it all.
A dusting of red on the other boys cheeks. Huh. Must be colder up here than Draco thought.
"The philsopho's what? Also when were you planning on telling me our Defense Against the Dark Arts professor was legitimately working with a being of the Dark Arts?"
Across the way, with two whole tables between them, Draco stopped and mouthed a distinct thanks to one Harry Potter as the sortings continued, giving the other boy a smile and a laugh before he continued on his way, mind and thoughts filled with excitement for this whole new section of his life. Because despite all the happenings of the day, and the sudden whatever-is-happening time nonsense thrust upon his shoulders, he had done it. He had gotten through his sorting, and he was here. His time at Hogwarts had finally begun.
"- Just so long as they're the right sort of -."
Pausing at the elf’s statement, Draco took a moment to reflect. Huh. “Yes. What of it?” He said with shrug, not entirely sure where the elf’s bewilderment was coming from. True, he hadn’t really ever been particularly kind to the family elves at any point when he was younger, but he was sure he’d at least said please and thank you at some point in the past. It was after all, the polite thing to do.
Slamming her hand against his assigned desk, right before the start of their latest Transfiguration class, Draco watched as Granger crossed her arms across her chest, and leveled him the coolest glare that she clearly could muster. It was almost intimidating. How quaint. Leaning down to examine the parchment, Granger cut him off with a sharp and succinct “Ninety four percent.” just as he shifted the sheet to glance at the numbers.
"Just read the column Adrian. We thought you knew already but clearly not." The other girl cut in, the force of both their gazes clearly forcing the other boy to rein himself in and pick up the paper. Within moments, the red on his cheeks and and the scowl on his features faded and paled to a ghostly white.
Merlin, this person.
And all Draco could see was dark, his stomach turning as continued his free fall. He tried to scream, but only the sound of silent weeping and scattered voices could be heard plummeting alongside him in the blackened ether. An overwhelming sense of loss and fear and anger seeping into his being.
Feeling an impact at the side of his face, Draco let out a startle. Face growing hot as he came to the realization that Trelawney had just thrown a ruddy cookie at him and that crumbs were now adorning both his face and his clothes.
Folding the now finished parchment up atop the surface of his desk, Draco reached into one of the shelves of his desk for his Malfoy seal. Then stamping it, he rose from his seat to slip out of his dorm with less than twenty minutes till the arrival of curfew. Giving a couple of the older Slytherins a wave or a nod depending on their family backgrounds as Draco had long since been taught, before making his way out through the door and into the eerily silent halls of the castle at night.
"Ah yes, your mother is right Draco, better move soon else all the good spots end up taken and you have to room with some of the less dignified folks currently about." Lucius drawled, his previous warmth smoothly cooling over as he shot a glance at a family just entering the platform. Bright red hair, old worn clothes and the numbers matching their rodent like name. Weasleys, his brain immediately supplied, his lips slowly curling. Blood-traitors, ugh how disgust-.
"The Dragon outed him to the Aurors. Didn't even give the man a chance to get out of bed before they raided the manor."
As she did so, he took in the sight of what appeared to be a bit of an argument going on across the way on the Gryffindor side of their practice exercise. With Granger, Longbottom and Potter seemingly whispering amongst themselves as Weasley stood awkwardly at the side, clearly unsure of whether or not to intervene or even if he wanted to.
Still very much staring at him, Cetus cocked her head left and right as she almost seemed to scan Draco’s form, her feathers ruffling ever so slightly, before she gingerly stepped forward and Draco took in the sight of a gorgeous Snowy owl sharing in the space of the Cetus’ coop. Pristine white feathers with almost gem like eyes; they were smaller than Cetus definitely, but given the close proximity Draco found the two in, he couldn’t help but smile.
Immediately, the other boy frowned and made a face.
At the mention of the term, visions, Draco cut in, brows furrowed in thought. "I thought Seers were only supposed to see into the future. Why did I happen to see something that's supposedly happened already nearly a month back?"
Slowly, just barely managing to register the instruction he was being given, Draco attempted to settle himself down, still very on edge, but knowing full well that if he was to get away, he needed to keep himself from losing control. He didn’t know what it was that just happened, what it was that he had just seen, heard, experienced. But what he did know was that Quirrel was without a doubt far more than the stuttering professor presented himself to be. He knew what he had seen, Quirrel had broken into Gringotts bank, he had blown open the huge metal doors of vault 713 and he could very well do the same to Draco if the blonde didn’t get out of here right this second.
But Hermione could only barely hear the older woman as she bolted from the class, joining the countless other students scattered across the halls, eyes hunting fervently for the ever distinct sight of silver blonde hair. She couldn’t believe she had gotten so stuck in her own thoughts that she had actually bloody lost him. This was horrendous. Hopefully he was still somewhere nearby.
In response to Draco’s reaction, Quirrel took another step closer, crouching down then to be at eye level with the blond, apparent concern written across his features. Tentatively, he raised his hands up, in a gesture of calming surrender, attempting to show Draco that he clearly meant the other no harm.
------------
Shaking his head slowly, Draco nodded at the other boy.
But now, since he was all of as sudden trying to be a good person, eww, he knew that he let Longbottom fall and the silly git died, the guilt of it all would eat him alive. So really, Draco was doing this more for himself really.
Raising an expectant brow towards him, she stared him straight down the length of her nose, a single brow rising upwards, her eyes brimming with challenge. He almost felt bad for what he was about to respond with, sliding his own parchment forward for her to see. For a mud-
even." Trelawney smirked behind the rim of her cup.
"The true extent of being able to See goes far beyond simple clairvoyance and precognition. For truly well experienced and legitimate Diviners, Oracles, Fortune tellers and what have you, to See means to peer not only into the future, but also to witness events occurring in the present and those buried in the past. In essence, it's like a very limited form of Omniscience, except entirely random and beyond one's sentient control.
Immediately, there was a round of minor gasps as several other interested gazes moved to turn in their direction. Both Greg and Vinny looked floored by the news as both their eyes had grown at the new information.
“Awful! Who in their bloody daft minds would want to study with someone like you? But you know what, I’m going to beat you anyway, just you watch you pompous git.” And whirling on her heels, Hermione stomped away, fire in her veins and pride in her throat.
without end in defence of students in his year and the year above and the years below, in defence of Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott and Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle and Stan Shunpike, where he spoken about his own use of the Unforgiveables and laws he broke and the people he hurt and the lives he ruined or ended or saved.  When it was all over, he went to Malfoy Manor for tea with Narcissa Malfoy and to return the wand he took from Draco Malfoy and to mention Andromeda and Teddy and where Draco Malfoy asked him how much it would cost for Harry to turn his Dark Mark into something else,
Harry finished undressing and followed him.
He regrets ever having forgotten that hard-learnt lesson.
“Fucking Hermione,” Draco said with Harry, matching his tone.  “Too smart for her own good, that one,” Draco continued.  “And you couldn’t function half as well without her.”
And then Harry is left with two weeks until their vacation starts.
“Malfoy,” Potter returned, matching his inflection. They nodded at each other as Potter took the empty seat.
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
were all things that fascinated Draco Malfoy. He had spent the two mandatory trips to the Muggle world in his Hogwarts uniform of slacks and a button-down shirt, with one of his cashmere jumpers to help protect him from the cold of mid-autumn when Potter had vetoed cloaks.
They were the most pathetic people ever.
“How do you feel about a shag before dinner?” Harry asked, closing the door behind himself.
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
They also bought some more gelato, even though dinner was only a short time away.
The next morning, Draco was a little worse for wear, especially considering that they had another hours-long coach journey to make, but Harry knew they were both satisfied. They hadn’t been able to spend an entire night having sex in months, if not years. They both have hectic jobs that require their attention, and they care too much about their abilities to go in on low sleep over something preventable. But today they have a morning travelling through the Irish countryside; they can doze if they need to.
“Actually no, I’m afraid I wasn’t paying any attention to you. But don’t feel bad about it though, I don’t pay attention to anyone much really, most just aren’t worth my time y’know.”
“Because I happen to have insider knowledge.” Draco smirked, just as Drake chimed in, jumping into his thoughts.
Oh she was so going to beat this prat.
To be perfectly honest Harry would have to say his experience so far in this new world of magic he had suddenly found himself in was astounding, with massives highs such as meeting Hagrid and Ron, getting Hedwig and finally managing to escape the dreadful home and school life he previously had to endure while living with the Dursleys. And that wasn’t even considering the sheer beauty and, cliche as it was, magic of everything around him.
"But of course. I wouldn't have dared missed this. Our little Drake is finally starting to grow up."
And Draco hated to admit it, but that was the most dastardly Slytherin thing he had ever heard. Damn, he was actually starting to respect the hag.
Inhaling deeply, Draco took in one breath and then another, desperately willing his heart out of his ears and his nerves to calm, as Quirrel chose at that point to crack a small smile and edge himself closer. A single hand reaching out towards Draco’s form, a clear act of comfort, of support, an anchor meant to aid him in grounding his sudden fear and anxiety.
Snickering at the aggravated. "Ugh, of course." Granger sent his way and the image of Weasley's own broom slapping him in the nose, Draco watched as Potter across from him set himself up as well, their eyes meeting for the briefest of moments as the other gave a wave. Returning it, albeit awkwardly, they all turned to Madame Hooch as she went out providing the student their relevant instructions for this exercise. Ideally, it seemed they were meant to practice hovering for a brief period of time and establish some semblance of how to maneuver their brooms for when they actually took to the air.
Right into the waiting arms of one Sybill Trelawney, the witch catching Draco right around the waist, and hoisting the terrified eleven year old right up against her chest. Had Draco been more lucid, the blond would have felt beyond embarrassed at being subjected to such a humiliatingly childlike position, but as the situation stood, all Draco himself could feel was an overwhelming sense of relief.
“You as well Ms. Granger.”
"Yeah well Harry's new. He still doesn't know what sort of folk are good or not so good to hang around and make friends with."
"Minus 20 points from Slytherin Mr. Malfoy for adding to an already tense and potentially life threatening situation. You acted without warning, told no one of your plan and could have quite possibly ended hurting yourself alongside Mr. Longbottom." She glared, yellow eyes boring into Draco's form as he slowly dismounted from his broom, features impassive. The blond could feel the indignation beginning to rise from his belly, the barest hints of colour starting to spread across his cheeks.
Taking the bag, Draco nodded. “Yes mother, I will. I’d really rather not get measured again. Madame Malkins was nice, but it was soooo boring. I was sure I was going to go bonkers if I was in there any longer.”
Today was day one!
“Oh! R-Right away Master Draco!” Dobby spoke then, popping away from the loo to his room the moment the words had left its mouth, the sounds of shuffling and latches clicking open and closed wafting back towards him through the open door.
And as all the other students moved to put away their things, Hermione could her lips turning upwards. That was it! That was how she could do it. She could ask him to study together with her. It was so obvious, why hadn’t she thought of it sooner. It was a perfect solution to her conundrum. A chance to spend time together, get to know each other and be productive? What more could she ask for?
"Nonsense. This is for your own wellbeing after all, and besides, you owe me for saving you from Quirrel. Don't worry. It shouldn't take you too long." She drawled. "Just a little marking for me is all, to really strengthen that mental grit."
The other merely shrugged in response. “Snape’s got a soft spot for me.” He smirked, looking only slightly smug.. “And he’s always his nastiest at the start of term I hear. Just study hard and you should be fine. And do your homework.”
“Alright class, that will be all for today, and congratulations on successfully completing your first week here at Hogwarts. I’m glad to see you are all settling in well.” Professor McGonagall announced. “Which also means, I no longer have to refrain from assigning you all homework as you are all now well and used to being here at the castle. As such, for next class I expect you all to have read to page thirty six of your
----------
Then the blond extended a hand. "Well then Harry, you can call me Draco."
"Some weekly gossip rag in the Daily prophet apparently that's been making heads spin for a couple weeks now. Written by that slimy hag Skeeter no less."
"If you don't want to fly Longbottom, next time please do the smart thing and either tell someone or don't show up to class." The blond drawled, stowing away his wand. "I really don't want to have to do this again, and I'm fairly sure you don't either."
"What do you mean a ruddy paper outed them? Did someone on their team snitch? Was it Guthry? It had to be Guthry right? Guy's a right tosser." Greg replied.
Drake spoke wistfully, a distinct tone of fondness in his words and the slightest hints of sadness, which Draco promptly chose to ignore. Scaling up one of the towers then, with the sight of the vast scottish countryside pouring in from the windows in the early morning shine, Draco smiled at the sensation of warmth upon his features just as he noticed the sound of many soft, yet innumerable wingbeats emanating from a room just a little further down the hall.
Because he was raised with manners, Draco opted to simply shake his head in response to the question, still mid chew and in dire need of a drink to chase down his food. Taking the response for what it was, Vinny continued on in Greg's place, a gleeful smile on both their features.
Not entirely what Chemistry was, Draco replied. "Really? Even after Snape went after you during the very first day."
The other blonde smiled wryly.
A gleaming silver shield, inlaid with soft white flowers, growing and blooming from vines of emerald ivy that coiled and knotted around the plain metal body. From all angles of the crest, the ivy grew outwards in mirrored spiraling shapes, looping again and again around other respective vines before finally coalescing at the very top of the intricate delicate heraldry with a knot of stark blue hydrangeas. It was quite pretty, Draco readily acknowledged, though it did not exactly provide any additional clues as to where he happened to find himself.
HOW!?
That was his future self? Why in the world had he tampered with time of all things? How all this was going to affect his first year at Hogwarts and what in the world was going to happen to Draco?
"R-Really?" Potter responded.
And what the bloody hell just happened to me!?”
Faster than he could even realize, Draco's whole world began to spin. The churning roiling sort of nausea in his stomach spreading throughout his entire body, just as his mind was suddenly aflame. Images, faces, voices and sensations all not his own slamming into him, a torrent of emotions and fragments of knowledge forcing themselves into his brain in a stream of just unending colour, sounds and tragedy. Draco didn't even feel his back hit the ground, body curling into a ball, his vision having gone blank already long before. The very last cognizant thing that he can recall hearing above the raging storm inside his head, a voice, old and young at once, strange and yet so very very familiar.
And considering Trelawney was Trelawney and the one with the direct contact with Skeeter, she didn't exactly bother with sending her half of the letters out for review from Drake and Draco before mailing them, so the two of them had mostly been keeping ahead of the papers themselves by nagging the woman incessantly about what she had sent in. Which clearly was all according to her nefarious plan of making Draco do all of her blasted marking for her.
Granger was, as Draco had long suspected, the brains of the operation, and provided the names and locations of several suitable museums to consider, as well as the option of the British Library in London, which apparently played host to both locals and tourists and would provide ample Muggle-watching opportunities.
Draco’s suspicions were aroused when they left for Cardiff after the end of their Friday shifts.
Harry never really figures out where the idea comes from. Maybe it was stored somewhere deep in his memories of growing up in middle-class, suburban Surrey, with the more-middle-class-than-most Dursleys, but it strikes him suddenly.
“We saw you two sneak out of the show early last night… Did you have better plans?” Elin leered as Maude laughed.
At some point during these trips, Potter became Harry. And Harry became Draco’s best friend.
Harry was not looking forward to Draco getting bitchy with him when he began to feel the claustrophobia of being surrounded by so many people. Harry would offer him the window seat for the next leg of the journey. To save his boyfriend’s sanity, of course, not for any other motives.
DMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
The Muggles, their habits, their society, their history, their culture, and their
After a quick pop into a shop for some lunch—sausage rolls and coffee—Draco began hunting for their next adventure. There was a big church in the distance, but—
With information in hand, and purpose in his stride, Draco led the way.
Of course, Harry had to be the biggest berk to ever exist and interrupt Draco’s comfort dinner to say, “Okay, so we
And the woman smiled, turning for a moment towards the entryway, before extending a hand and a shimmer of light flew from the tips of her fingertips to surround the area just beyond the doorway. Absently, Draco figured that it was likely a notice-me-not spell despite not actually being aware of what a notice-me-not spell even was; though that particular thought was drowned out by the acknowledgement that this woman had just cast a spell both wandlessly and non-verbally. The blonde immediately felt his jaw start to drop.
The voice, a new one, whispered at his side, soft, teasing and wonderfully sweet.
Then there was a flash of something in the eyes of the other.
However, lacking in sleep and awareness, he could only really pick out certain tidbits of their conversation, let alone properly fathom the words or intent behind their exchange.
“Urgh, why is this so hard...It’s so not fair.”
Quietly, the words came, "I know what you're doing Malfoy. Stay away from my friends. You have other snakes to pal around with, I won't let you steal away Harry and Neville."
And Draco took a small sense of satisfaction in seeing how the redhead immediately gaped at him like a fish and how his features steadily grew to match the shade of his hair, hands balling into fists at his side. Blue eyes burned into Draco's form, an ugly snarl quickly forming upon the other boys lips, but the blond was done with this conversation and without another look back pushed passed the Weasley into the rest of the library.
She turned towards Draco’s parents then. “All the lad needed was some rest, he should be more than fine now. If you want a written set of result of the diagnostics Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy, I would be more than willing to provide.”
It was almost like being a freak again back with the Dursleys except turned on its head. Sure, it had been kind of nice, at the start, with everyone, even strangers being so kind and nice to him, but after a while it was just overwhelming. Thankfully, here at the castle though, things had seemingly begun to simmer down, what with classes beginning, and Harry couldn’t be happier.
The man cried out, all shock and rage and the slightest hint of fear.
Draco couldn’t help but pause at that last acknowledgement. It was very clear that these were Drake’s past associations with his old Longbottom, but a Malfoy friends with blood traitor? Now, that was absurd. The Longbottoms were next to bottom rung in terms of power and prestige amongst Pureblood society, whatever could have happened to his supposed older self to lower themselves to such base standards in terms of connections?
"Of course I am." Came the resolute response, giving Draco pause. "And you're not. That's just facts Malfoy."
“Oh, I understand now mother, thank you.” Draco smiled.
The poor lad in the vision must be having a real awful time right now. Draco couldn't even begin to imagine just how rough things must be for them, given the small glimpse the blond had the displeasure of experiencing. He had heard about things like that before, along the grapevine and amidst the gossip of his fellow pureblood children, but he hadn't really ever paid the idea of it any mind as he was mostly focused on his own goings on and fairly comfortable family situation.
Scoffing smugly at the sight of the others, Draco stride confidently further into the train entirely unhampered by cases and bags thanks to his parents sending his items ahead. It was so fascinating, walking up and down the aisles, taking in the sight of his soon to be yearmates and sizing them up in terms of potential connections and obvious talents. Network early and as often as possible, his father had always said, because the more people you know, the more popular one seems and the more resources you have at your disposal. And popularity, recognition was power. And though still young, Draco knew he was destined for power. He was a Malfoy after all. It might as well be in his blood.
Trewalney nodded then. “Very well. But please just Poppy, I assure you, Mr. Malfoy will be fine. I’ll escort him back into his dorms once the worst of it has passed. Thank you Quirinus.”
That last part really put Draco on edge if he was to be perfectly honest with himself, but also given his current situation, and the fact that he had no bloody clue what was going on and what he was doing here, he thought it was probably best not to antagonize the only other company he happened to have in this particular limbo. As that would potentially mean, the stranger would either A: Off him, or B: leave him here by himself, and really Draco didn’t know which one was worse.
He had still been excited though. He was sharing the class with Ron and he always had a bit of an interest in science when he was younger, and potions seemed like the closest thing he was going to get to legitimate chemistry. The teacher was rather terrifying though, given the way he had come stalking into the room, dark and stern, and with a speech had the faintest hints of goosebumps rising along Harry’s skin. That was, until -
Suddenly feeling ill and decently confused, all Draco could do was give his mother a nod and try to stop the unexplainable discomfort churning in his gut. What in the world was this sensation. Like a weight in his stomach and a foul taste in his mouth, all pertaining to those filthy blood traitors.
And so, reluctantly, he opened his mouth, eyes turning downwards at the embarrassment that he felt, and began to speak.”
“Uh, h-hello.” Draco stuttered out. “Are you?”
"- Lucius." Narcissa cut in, shaking her head fondly. "But yes. You're going to have a wonderful, fun and amazing year little Dragon. And if you ever need anything, remember both your Father and I are only an Owl away. I love you my little one."
"Drake's memories from his future past are currently our greatest advantage in terms of reaching our intended goals." Trelawney added. "They give us the necessary information we need to effectively predict and potentially even control the relevant factors and players around us. If we start making changes too early or make changes that affect the timeline in a significant way."
“Perfect, and I myself have no particular qualms about either for these conditions. Though, I’m personally much more interested in the topic of payment, or exchange of services. Because as much I would love to save the world with you all out of the goodness of my heart, there isn’t really much goodness left really. Mostly it’s just spite and laziness and indifference. Mostly indifference.”
“As much as I have enjoyed you as a student so far Ms. Granger, I’m afraid i’m going to have to ask you to make your exit in short order. My last class of the day will be here in a couple moments and I must prepare the room for their practical applications.”
Well. Most of the time. "And to answer your question. I am currently trying very hard not to set these papers on fire at the moment." Gods damned, blasted bug eyed Trelawney. Sticking him with all this stupid divination work that she herself should be bloody doing instead.
She’d never let him touch her like this before. Normally all animals hated him with a burning passion, but right now she was actually letting him pet her! Marveling at how peaceful she seemed to be, Draco couldn’t help but wonder what in the world could have changed to bring about such a difference in behaviour. Glancing then towards the other bird in the coop, quietly observing their exchange, Draco smiled.
"..... Thank you. I will."
And without warning Draco suddenly found his arms filled to the brim with stacked sheets, rising as high as his chin and sending him nearly toppling into the ground. Dropping the stack onto the table behind, the blond couldn't help but gawk at the size of it. It was nearly half his height and written on material far and above both Draco's current first year knowledge and standing.
Draco blinked, not at all sure how to even begin responding to the information he was suddenly being given.
"... It makes logical sense... best students.... contend with eachother..."
A pause, Draco refusing to back down and break eye contact with the witch that towered before. Then her gaze softened, and she let out huff.
Draco shook his head. “It’s alright Mother. I think i’m good.” He smiled.
A thumbs up was given to Draco at this point alongside a crooked sort of smirk.
And he'll call his Death Eaters back to him, meaning his Father would have to answer, and then Draco would find himself and his family enslaved by a noseless, amoral megalomaniac all over again, if Drake's tragic intrusive memories were anything to go by.
The high walls all around him stretched far towards the vaulted ceilings, paint peeling along the corners with web like cracks trailing across whole sections of wall. The staircase at the center of the foyer, worn with clear indications of traffic along the rims of the steps, and yet the banisters lined with dust alongside all the other primly scattered across the room, covered in cloths of white and gold. It was a foyer, Draco acknowledged blearily, his mind already spinning with the sudden shift and change in location, the sudden lucidity in his thoughts leaving him even further shaken as the entrance before him yawned wide and empty as it lead further into the rest of the home.
"And if you think I'm bad, then you're not any better Weasley. I've seen and met dozens of people just like you all my life. You just want Harry for yourself, because he has something your family will never have. Money and bloody respect. And if you think I'm wrong, then you're even worse than us sleazy pureblood Slytherins, because at the very least, we don't lie to ourselves."
And scorn and rejection.
WHY!?
"Well, go on? Clearly it had to have something to do with Quirrel, given your reaction to seeing him right after. Quite coincidental really, almost as if it were
“Thank you, have  good night now professor.”
“E-Excuse me! Excuse me, Malfoy!”
"Well as blind as two Seers could possibly be. Congratulations on your first vision by the way." The Divinations Professor smiled, suddenly with a cup of tea in hand and cookies on a plate at the table at her side. "What did you see?"
-------------
Chapter 4, as promised. Hopefully, things will start to get more exciting from here on out!
“My sincerest apologies Quirinus. Mr. Malfoy here stumbled upon me having a bit of a time moving some items into my class and was lending me a hand, before he took a sip of the wrong drink, so to speak.”
Then without much preamble, the Slytherin Head began to speak. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through the human veins, bewitching the minds, ensnaring the senses...”
That was true. At the very least this particular experience didn't leave Draco hyperventilating horrifically and fearing for his own life. Though instead it had ended up leaving him feeling rather put out and legitimately sad over someone else's. It wasn't exactly a feeling Draco experienced very often, and everytime he did end up feeling overly empathetic it always ended up with him feeling exceedingly exhausted for not being able to make it go away as soon as he could.
Tailbone and arse practically on fire at the suddenness of the drop Draco pulled himself to his feet, just barely catching the tail end of Trelawney finishing a spell around the doorway of the room. Turning back to look at him then, she gave him a gesture of sorts, and spoke dispassionately.
“The sorting uses a hat.” Draco whispered, drawing upon the faint recollections he could make out from Drake’s memories. “Calm down. You’ll be fine. They won’t be siccing any trolls on first-years.”
"Potter? Beat the Dark Lord? How?" Draco spoke. "He's just a kid!"
Turning back then towards her own match, Hermione closed her eyes and moved to focus. Her thoughts twofold. First, on the completion of the magecraft before her, because if Malfoy could do it, then so would she. And Second, plans for her inevitable encounter with the other prodigy, inevitable because Hermione would make it happen one way or another. She had finally found someone who had the potential to understand her and she was not going to just stand idly by and let him be swept up into the claws of someone else. She was taking no chances. He would be her friend.
“Haha! Marvelous, I shall go and make arrangements and let everyone know.” Dumbledore hummed happily, starting forwards on his way towards the doors. “I shall see you all during the sorting then. Severus, if you could please help young Mr. Malfoy rejoin his fellow students when the time comes, that would be lovely.”
Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived, was on the exact same train Draco was on right now and it left the blonde almost giddy with excitement of getting to meet an actual living legend, even despite how much Lucius disapproved of him. For Draco, like with most other Wizarding youth born in recent times had grown up with tales upon tales of the great Harry Potter, and the fact that, right here right now, if Draco played his cards right, he could potentially become friends with him was both legitimately mind-boggling and practically meant to be. After all, they did have quite a lot in common, fame, money, power and though Draco was certainly behind in glory, he was certainly determined to catch up in that regard as well.
Draco Malfoy, The-Boy-Who-Fainted-On-The-First-Day-Of-School. He was never going to be able to live any of this down. Never. He should just give up on school and leave right now. How in the world was he ever supposed to make his family proud, when the first thing that came to the other kids’ minds the moment they would meet him was that he was some sort of invalid?
Shaking his head and thoughts out of the mental bickering he had been partaking in. Draco gave his mother a soft sort of smile and heaved a sigh of his own. “No. I uh, I think I’m good now mother. Sorry for scaring you again. But I do feel so much better now.”
"Mr. Longbottom. Mr. Longbottom!" The professor cried as the other pureblood boy zoomed across the open terrain, looping through archways and buttresses almost as if he was meant to fly, if one were able to ignore the near constant screaming and holding on for dear life.
Perturbed, confused and just the slightest bit afraid, Draco returns the quill back to the parchment. Well apparently his future was rather insane. Wonderful news. Fantastic even.
There were so many people! Everywhere that Draco looked was bustling with activity, the sound of incoming and outgoing trains echoing throughout the entirety of the building. With swift steps, and the slightest of frowns upon her features as she gazed upon all the muggles amongst them, Narcissa lead Draco further into the station, passing platform after platform until they reached a small section of wall between 9 and 10.
Hearing the voice, Draco spun himself around, eyes glancing about in an attempt to find its source. Finding nothing, he turned back towards the elf, a pensive frown upon his features. Soft, distinctly male, and distinctly older than himself. It certainly couldn't have been his father, particularly considering it just referred to a house elf as it's friend, as if such a thing was even possible. Frown deepening and stepping forward, he spoke then, eyes focusing upon the other being.
It took a couple of days of classes for the news to get to her, and for her to truly verify the claims that were being made. But as she observed the blonde, gingerly and without any real effort, transfigure their assigned matches into a needle and back again, something even she had yet to achieve, and on the first couple tries no less, she knew then that the rumours were true.
Narcissa pursed her lips at his response, still looking decently skeptical before eventually giving a nod. “Very well then. It seems you’ve already made up your mind about this decision. And I guess as a consolation we do get to see your sorting. Have you any idea what House you’ll likely be in?”
Vinny laughed. "Yeah. It does sound pretty dumb, right Greg?"
But while there were plenty of highs there were also a couple less than pleasant things too he had come to discover. First and foremost, the fact that he was famous. Harry had never been a big fan of attention, mostly he just wanted to be like everybody else. And to find out he was some sort of savior for something he didn’t even know he had done, was more than a little jarring. Because that meant, even here, in this new fantastic and whimsical place, he was still seen as different from everyone else.
"Skeeter? That slug is behind all this?" Yet another voice responded, and really at this point Draco wasn't even going to try recognizing anyone. It seemed like all of a sudden their letterwork was quite the hot topic, which left Draco feeling strangely internally smug for being in the full know of what was actually going on. Of course he didn't exactly know the full contents of every letter as more than half of them thus far have mostly come from Trelawney's own visions with the odd smattering of notes coming from Drake's future knowledge and personal memories.
"And plus 50 to Slytherin for saving a fellow student, and acting when no one else did. You're actions were admirable, rash and stupid as they were. However, NEVER do that again." And as the witch strode past, Draco felt himself surrounded by his fellow Slytherin, cheering loud for a massive gain of 30 house points.
It was almost spooky, with the dark of the outside contrasting so starkly with the brilliant glow of the candles and sconces of the halls within, making the castle itself seem impossibly bigger and even more imposing than it already was. All Draco could hear as he made his way towards Trelawney’s office were the clicking of his own shoes against the stone of the walkways, and the fluttering of his robes billowing in the wind.
He felt strangely on edge. A heavy sort of sensation slowly but surely becoming indefinitely more pronounced as he continued on his way, a looming pressure on his back that never seemed to leave. He felt like something was coming. And impending sort of dread coiling in his gut, and then, Draco was gasping for air, hands flying to his mouth as he fell back against the nearest wall, his vision blurring, his head pounding loudly against his skull. Blearily, he could hear Drake shouting at him from the recesses of his mind, telling him to pull himself together, as Draco slumped down the wall and onto the cold stone of the floor beneath him.
“Wha-What? Why ever not?”
From the recesses of his mind, he could almost envision the lofty dismissive wave that coincided Drake’s equally dismissive statement.
Watching as the older woman made her exit through the other doors of the ward, Severus moved to join Draco and his parents at his bedside. “Well that’s certainly one way to start one’s first year at Hogwarts.” The darker haired man said idly.
But who's home? Draco thought absently, before reaching out and partially bracing himself against one of the cloth covered chairs for support. There wasn't anything he found immediately recognizable save for the clearly apparent former opulence of the place. Dull silver banisters trailing up along the sides of the stairs, inlays of gold sewn into the thick shut curtains, beautiful yet faded portraits and paintings all depicting cool and elegantly dressed women. And across the whole view, a crest emblazoned across the ends of each of the low hanging curtains and emblazoned across the chests of each regal dame.
“W-wh-What!?”
But all Draco could see was a face behind that touch, vague in shape, not Quirrel’s, but another. A memory surfacing to the forefront of his mind; flat with no nose, lips pulled back in a twisted grin, skin a pale sickly white and covered in weblike veins.
“Ah. No thank you. Thanks for asking me though.” The blonde cut in then, instantaneously shutting down her entire train of thought.
"What are you up to Malfoy?" The words were spoken with heavy suspicion. Narrowed sea blue eyes and furrowed red brows stepping into Draco's line of sight, similar scarlet locks falling across a soft freckled face, tilted downwards to cast the speaker's features into dark. Draco imagined they must have thought the gesture made them look intimidating. Really, it was just rather silly.
------------
Seeing his discomfort, both Narcissa and Lucius sent a glance towards each other before looking about around themselves for the briefest of moments. Then in the next, having acknowledged that there no prying eyes, both moved forward to comfort the younger blonde.
“And seeing as you are perfectly fine now, and all diagnostic spells have come back clean and without issue, I’m fairly confident you should be good for Hospital discharge at this point in time.”
“There he goes again....”
"When would it ever not be relevant!?"
He was also rather silently impressed at the fact that he hadn’t broken into hysterics yet, after being suddenly shunted into such a strange situation. Literally three days ago he had rather embarrassingly taken nipping from one of the Manor’s Peacocks and wailed for half an hour. Neat. He guessed this would have been the moment his father congratulated him for finally growing a bit more of a backbo-
“I’ve warded and silenced the room from the outside. You may begin screaming as you will.”
“I should also probably start getting myself ready for the feast as well. All Hogwarts staff must be present at the first great feast after all, and I will provide you both your papers when I return Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy,” She said, walking off back towards the other end of the Hospital wing. “Till then.”
"Then - then what are we going to do!?" Draco cried, a cold gnawing ice pooling at the base of his spine and crawling across his form. "We can't let him get a hold of the stone!"
Looking legitimately dumbfounded, the elf merely stared at him, eyes growing impossibly large. “D-D-did Master Draco, just tell Dobby p-please and th-thank you?”
That was thankfully still a couple hours away though, giving him some much needed time to calm himself down as he sought to try and find his way to the Hogwarts owlery. He’d made a good amount of headway thus far, but was finding navigating the corridors of the massive castle to be a greater challenge than initially expected. There were just so many things to see!
"Oh come off it Malfoy. Don't try your tricks with me. I know you're up to something. Your kind always is."
Pucey shook his head. "Nope. Only acting as town cryer for the real writer it seems. Some seer apparently that goes by the moniker, 'The Golden Dragon'. Stupid name if you ask me."
Breathing heavily, his eyes growing wide at the figure before him, Draco could feel his body tensing up, autonomously moving to flatten itself as far back against the wall as he could in an attempt to put as much distance as possible between himself and the professor. He could still see the hard cold edges of the figure in the mine shaft, in the bank at Gringotts. A sudden, near overwhelming sense of fear and dread slowly coming to sit in the pit of his stomach, speaking of danger, and death and suffering.
“One hundred.” He spoke, looking up towards Granger, feeling smug, but measuring his presentation so as to not look too overly boastful.
-----------
Rising from her seat, Hermione nodded to herself. Alright. Now all she had to do was ask, and Malfoy seemed nice enough. Given how well he’s managed to work with Neville of all people in their potions class. Surely, he’d at the very least consider it, and he needed just a little extra push, well Hermione was more than confident she had more than enough logic at her back to convince him.
Hermione Granger was a prodigy. A fact she had always been aware of, since she had been young. Picking up skills faster than any other her age, learning new concepts, ideas and putting them into practice with clear understanding. Her mind was her greatest asset and coupled with her love of learning allowed her to acquire results leaps and bounds beyond even those thought to be her betters, earning her praise and recognition all throughout her life.
He almost missed the barely whispered, “Thank you.” that came from the other boy’s direction, but couldn’t help but indulge in the strange sensation of satisfying warmth that came from hearing said words.
“What!? No, oh please, no need to go to such lengths Quirinus. I know the tea Mr. Malfoy had, exotic, very strong herbal qualities, he should be fine in an hour or so. Thankfully, he only had a minor drink, or he could have died-.”
From his position, clutching onto Trelawney’s form, Draco heard the other professor gasp. “What? Oh n-no! I-I shall alert M-Mad-d-dame Pomfrey at once!”
“Draco? Draco, dear is something the matter?” Narcissa spoke then, her delicate features shifting into the smallest of frowns. Immediately realizing that he had momentarily zoned out in the presence of his parents, Draco shook his head.
He had actually almost forgotten that there would be consequences for his sudden change in attitude and conscience, Slytherins were a suspicious lot, especially surrounding issues like Blood or the war. And as such, he would have expected a conversation like this to occur more likely with Nott or amongst his fellow housemates rather than a Weasley of all things.
Draco Malfoy was just like her.
"Awww, it would have been funnier if he fell."
All feedback is more than appreciated. Anything done well, anything that could be improved upon, please lay it on me haha. It feeds my motivation to work and better my story and storytelling.
A pause. "The column knew how to open your Uncle's secret room. Where it was hidden. Told the law how to find it. We all need to watch this supposed Seer closely. Because while it could have been a one off, a horrifically lucky guess, they haven't been wrong once since the papers started printing it."
Lucius gave a soft sigh of relief. “If you would please Madam Pomfrey. It would certainly help in alleviating some of our concerns regarding today.”
“Better luck next time, Granger. Maybe during exams.”
Trelawney merely shrugged in response. “It’s what happens when you’ve been a seer as long as I have. It’s either Nihilism or Madness as you get older, one or the other. But that’s beside the point.”
At the very least however, as the lesson eventually began, he had himself a bit of a giggle watching all his other yearmates struggle to summon their brooms. Even without Drake's help, Draco had already been flying for years now around the manor, so it was without much effort that he brought the broom to his hand and readied himself for take off.
“Anyway, my luggage Dobby?” He repeated, gesturing an arm back out towards his room. “Both Mother and Father want everything to be perfect on my first day, and the last thing any of us wants is to find out we forgot something.”
"And you think you're one of the good ones?" Draco replied, almost incredulously.
He could have commented on the clearly oversized robes and their fraying edges. The minor ink stains on the other boys fingertips denoting old and worn quills. Or just the simple fact that the other was indeed a Weasley, and that his family name was synonymous in most pureblood circles with poverty and blood traitorism.
“Also, why did we have to apparate out here mother? Couldn’t we just pop inside the station?”
It was in sixth year, after the Department of Mysteries, after the broken nose and potions book, when Harry began to use coloured inks.  The blacks were darker this year, the greys lighter, but the colours vibrant.  Flashes of greens like the killing curse, the morsmordre, his mother’s eyes; reds the colours of blood—fresh, watery, drying, old—and flecks of silver like the patronous, like a set of weary eyes in a gaunt face, like the ghosts of the castle.  Harry began to draw people: the professors, the ghosts, the students in the Gryffindor common room or the library or the Great Hall.  Piles upon piles upon piles of portraits of Draco Malfoy growing progressively gaunter and more frightened and more harried as he exits the Room of Requirement.  Piles upon piles upon piles upon
bus right before a coach tour, I’m sure.”
The professor carried on, introducing the rest of the syllabus and outlining some key outcomes of the course—“This is just like what you’d get in a Muggle University,” Draco heard Granger murmur when everyone received a packet of papers, rather than a ream of parchment, detailing everything the professor had discussed, including the due dates of all assignments and their weighing. She was one of the few who looked prepared to cry tears of joy. Draco thought he understood how she felt. It would be a lot easier to build a study schedule when he already knew when all of the assignments for one class needed to be done. Hell, he might even be able to work ahead.
He calls Hermione.
He explains his dilemma, what he wants from the trip, the fact that they can’t leave the UK and that he wants to go full Muggle, when she interrupts.
They found that the back bench was not a bad spot to be during a scenic tour of mountains and foliage and fog, as they were able to open the curtains of the rear window and look up and behind them whenever they wanted.
So, Potter being Potter, and therefore inherently predictable, went to Granger for guidance dragging Draco along with him.
to Wales for a weekend, but he also didn’t want to have to cross the Severn bridge at any hour of the evening. So, he made the hop to one of the approved Cardiff apparition points, waited for Harry to arrive, and they headed to a hotel in the heart of the city.
Draco was worried that after they graduated from Hogwarts, he would never see Harry again, except for maybe at Teddy’s birthday parties.
Draco felt that Potter, being Muggle-raised, if not Muggle-born, should choose the first location for their Muggle Studies assignment.
Then there is fire, heat all around him, stalking him, hunting him—but it is the warmth he feels, the warmth of Draco Malfoy, alive, attempting to save him again, that he focuses on.  That he would draw, if he had the time: the look of wonder in Malfoy’s eyes as Harry had reached down to pull him onto the broom; that he would paint on his skin, save in oil and ink over his heart.
The coach trip was relatively short this time as well. They were taken to Ross Castle, in the Killarney National Park.
Harry just chuckled, shaking his head. Draco wasn’t even actually pissed off—he must be enjoying the trip so far, despite the hiccups caused by Harry’s last-minute booking.
“Potter! What the ever-loving
“I managed to get us the last two seats available on this trip,” Harry sounded somewhere between excited and wary. Draco couldn’t see his face, so he couldn’t be sure. Not only was Harry in front of him, but Draco was distracted by the number of…

Draco learned a lot after the loathsome and unforgettable York-London escapade.
Draco considered the proposition—he wasn’t tired, he was a bit pent up, and as nice as a snog before bed was, he wanted the connection and intimacy of having Harry buried inside him. And they had time to kill before dinner, anyway.
“I am hurt that you would think I'm calling just to ask you for something,” he informs her tartly. He might be making his Malfoy face. “Maybe I just wanted to call and chat with my best friend on this lovely afternoon. Did you consider that?”
DMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
After dropping off their bags in their room (with a single king bed), Harry and Draco headed back down to the lobby to meet with the rest of their group—the driver was to give them an update on their itinerary for the rest of the week as well as when they needed to be at dinner. Draco grumbled at the early departure time for the next morning, even if it was for a boat ride to the ruins of another ancient castle, but he perked up upon being reminded that the hotel bar has a 2-for-1 drinks special for most of the week. Harry grinned, pleased that Draco seemed to be enjoying himself.
Technically, Draco thought, if it were going to be a Muggle vacation, they shouldn’t be
Potter had, and he'd decided to go through with it.  What a weirdo.  Draco sighed to himself.
“Draco,” Harry moaned, joining the queue at the bar. “I like talking to people, I like learning about them, but I didn’t need to learn everything there is to know about Deirdre, John, their possibly gay son, their maybe-not-related-to-them granddaughter, and, horrifically, their
Draco takes a truly Slytherin joy in changing the day of their anniversary for the next five years.
What surprised him the most was that Harry rejoined him almost ten minutes before they were due to return to the coach. He was flushed from having run back to where the coach was parked, but he seemed pleased to have arrived before time. Draco gave him a kiss on his temple while Harry beamed at him—and quickly dodged as Harry tried to kiss his face.
They discovered that their hotel hosted different performances in their auditorium every evening.

“Well, you’ve picked the right trip, boys,” Elin grinned, “Ireland is always beautiful. Although, I’m not sure about your luck being on a full coach for your first go around. Might just put you off, honestly. But there will be lots of free walking time once we get to Erin.” And with another smile, Elin leaned back and began chatting quietly with Maude, leaving Draco and Harry to get settled as the bus trundled forward.
“Known each other long, then, have you?” Maude asked, eyes glinting.  She knew the answer, Harry had already told her they grew up together.  Harry thought she was probably just a mischievous fossil, and he respected that.
At first he imitated, or tried to imitate, the styles of his favourite comic books, drawing and redrawing superheroes on any scrap of paper he could find, until his pencils were numbs and his pens were out of ink.  Then, he found the collections of art books, full-coloured replicas of the great works of classical and renaissance and modern artists, and learned that comic book superheroes were only one small portion of what could be done with ink on paper.
Hopefully, Harry was right about there being a stop early on, because Draco was going to need more tea if he was forced to be

And Harry had
Really hectic.
“West Glamorgan really does have some beautiful scenery, even in Swansea. Have you ever been, dear?”
Draco laughed and winked back as Harry strode through the entrance with their bags.
Harry just shrugged and grinned, charming and unrepentant. Draco pulled him in for a quick kiss, even if he was still a little cross about the lack of coffee.
“What? No? How can we? We don’t have passports or even proper government-issued ID. Even if it is just the EU, there’s still crossing back into Britain, with Muggles. We can’t go around
“Malfoy? Is this your room?” Harry looked around the twin dorm, noticing the pristinely made bed, the hints of Slytherin greens and silvers in the motif of the duvet, the bookcase already overloaded with course books, the meticulously highlighted daily planner (and wasn’t it a treat to it gift to Draco the previous Christmas, only to have to take him to every Muggle stationary from Edinburgh to Cardiff to ensure that he was able to find one to call ‘his local,’ as if a
“No faeries, thank Merlin,” Draco muttered to himself. “Those little fuckers are after my hair, I swear, Potter. Never ask me to attend a midsummer’s event near a faerie circle.”
“Exactly, babe,” Harry patted Draco’s arm. “There’s something in the air—”
The cruise lasted a good few hours as they circled most of the lake, and the islands dotted throughout, almost in their entirety.
Everything goes well at the border.
And Harry was back into research, around appointments and applications for spots, and he had to figure out if he could ink over the Mark or if he had to work around, and how the charms and the needles and the inks and images would react with the latent magic left from Voldemort, despite his death.  And he had to imagine what he would paint on Malfoy’s body, what he would cover him with, what traces of his own he would leave besides bruises and bloodstains and scars.  But with his snitch and with his stars and with Malfoy’s silver eyes and pale skin and scars and bruises and pale, shining hair, Harry knew he could find something perfect.
But Harry wasn’t certain they were actually dating until Draco came home from class one night, saw that Harry had ordered in his favourite curry because he knows late afternoon classes are impossibly draining for Draco, and whispered, “Thanks love, you really are the best boyfriend,” before placing a peck on his temple and collapsing with his rice and curry on the sofa.
DMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
Everyone around them laughs, some commenting on the fact that they're a sweet couple or that Draco is well within his rights to move the anniversary (mostly wives) or that being able to change the date must spice things up in the bedroom (Maude, the vixen).
“Wonderful, thank you,” Draco responded on instinct, all manners and politeness, as was proper for a Malfoy. “How are you lovely young ladies today?” He smiled at them as he was finally able to take his seat in the centre of the bench, Harry having shuffled into the window seat.
DMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
Then, eventually, shocking and wonderful, came that faithful birthday—eleven years old, and a WIZARD!  Once at Hogwarts, Harry had no need to escape, no reason to wish himself away from the real world.  Well, he had some reasons, but he never felt the same urge, the same need to draw this world, to capture it and change it—the magic, he felt, wouldn’t translate into lines and shadows the same way as the Muggle world, and so he never tried.  He would doodle during class, but they would be quick and sketchy and childish and imprecise—quills and ink and parchment were not his mediums and it showed.
“Thank Merlin you didn’t,” Draco agrees. “Imagine having to tell my mother that story to her face.”  Draco laughs at Harry’s sudden flush.  “I love you, you sappy git.”
Between sessions of sketching and discussions and kissing and drinking, Harry managed to convince Draco that he could change the shape of the Mark, use charms and ink, and turn if from the snake and skull into a flower and forever.  The snake filled in, wrapping into infinity; the skull replaced with a Zinnia in full bloom—the remembrance of absent friends, forever.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was, all in all, a very leisurely morning.
“Oh dear, that’s quite the journey. By rail, I expect? You wouldn’t have wanted to take
Luckily, Draco found him endearing, laughing at his expense as he said, “Don’t worry your pretty little scarhead about it, I’ve only started counting since you turned down that girl at the Muggle club on your birthday to come home and have ice cream with me while watching Baking Show.”

“Unhand me, Potter, you oaf. People will think you’re a drunk with the way you’re rushing to the bar like that.”
“I really need your help!” He’s pleading before he even registers it. It’s practically a conditioned response at this point.
Harry looked at Draco, who met his eyes with a mirror of the same horror.
“No, but they’d definitely make fun of us for the rest of the trip for it. Let’s just spell some lube and I’ll buy you a gelato after we eat.”
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
“Yeah,” Draco nodded, overly enthusiastic in his tipsiness. “I just love it here,” he gushed, “it’s so beautiful, and the weather is blessedly cool without being cold, and nature is everywhere even when it isn’t, you know?”

thought Draco was beautiful, even if they also wanted to punch him in the nose.  ‘No’, my then-girlfriend told me, ‘most people just want to punch him.’
—but he wanted to help Sara, and she really was a beautiful young thing. So, they were married right out of secondary school, and moved into Sara’s grandmother’s cottage, and raised a beautiful daughter, our Lorraine.
“We do because if you want, it can be today." Harry holds out a ring box. "Draco, will you marry me?”
“Our trip leaves from Cardiff on Sunday morning, Draco,” Harry had told him proudly at the start of the week, and Draco had tried not to worry too much that he was only hearing this
Draco’s current discomfort was all Potter’s fault.  Who, when provided with literal
They made their way to the back of the coach, muttering ‘pardons’ and ‘excuse me’s’ the whole way, to find that they were sharing the back-bench seating with a pair of lovely-looking older women.
The information on the reconstruction was informative, though Harry spent more time admiring the views of the lake around them, the islands in the near-distance. Unlike Blarney, there was no gift shop or row of boutiques—just an old stone fort surrounded by water.
“Something like that,” Draco hummed. “We went to the same secondary school, then roomed together in Uni, too.” And Harry was so proud of Draco for sounding so Muggle, that he would be sure to let him know that tonight.
As the Death Eater trials begin, Harry begins studying tattoos, both the magical and Muggle, the powerful and mundane.  He learns about Dark Marks from Death Eaters and historians, theorists and survivors.  He learns about magical tattoos that shift beneath the skin, as little or as much as they want.  He learns about Muggle methodology, of needles and ink; he learns about charms and spells that do just as well.  He learns how to combine his quill and parchment and pen and paper and needles and charms to make something unique and his own.
Draco would admit to himself, that he held some small, minuscule, portion of the blame, if only because he was the one who trusted Potter to not be the complete pillock Draco knew him to be. But Draco would never, ever, say anything of the sort out loud.
DMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
were they taking a trip that departed from Cardiff? Unless they were exploring Northern Wales…
a lot of places Muggles frequented, he had been to very few, and could only remember a childhood trip to the zoo because of a python that may or may not have become Nagini and a disaster with some accidental magic.
He and Harry were able to explore the ship, the duty-free shop, the café, the cafeteria, and the different decks with external platforms with large viewing windows and comfy chairs. They had more tea, this time with scones and jam and cream, sitting outside and watching the endless blues of the sea and the sky.
In any case, Draco tried to set aside his worry and enjoy the short stay in Cardiff. There was a lot of nightlife to explore, and many clubs and pubs to pop in and out of for a drink and a dance, neither of which Draco had been able to enjoy in quite some time.
,” Draco began, and it was Harry’s turn to make an affronted sound that was promptly ignored, “my question still stands. What the actual fuck are you doing here, Harry? And don’t say visiting me.”
This is officially my longest fic to date :D
“Harry, you only start phone calls with compliments when you need something. So, again, what do you need?” And dammit if she isn’t right. He should really start praising her all the time so that these kinds of things don’t happen—and that’s enough Slytherin for now. Serious business.
“We aren’t going to do a big thing this year,” he decided. “You still have classes and I’ll be starting a new rotation next month. We can do a big thing in two years, once you’re done school and rotations. And in the meantime, we can pick a new date. I don’t want to celebrate us on the same day everyone is celebrating me.” But mostly, he wanted the day he celebrated Draco and him being together to be on a day that nothing else fell on, so it could really be just about them.
After breakfast, they headed off to Killarney, but much like the day before, they stopped before too long. They didn’t pull into a carpark at a café, though, they pulled into a carpark outside a castle.
One was dressed in a white linen ensemble, with wide-legged trousers and a long t-shirt in the exact same shade and texture, wearing a brightly-coloured patterned scarf around her neck. The other was in denim capris and a blouse. They both smiled in welcome when Harry and Draco made it to their seats, shuffling their carry-ons around to make room.
So, something local. But not too local—they’ve done enough in London for now, and they want to have more options for the future, too.
that they were buying seats on a coach that would be sold to capacity?

Harry had been thinking about asking if Draco wanted to extend their holiday until Sunday, maybe head to Swansea or Mumbles, stop in at Worm’s Head. But now, he just wants to get home. And he can tell Draco feels the same.
. I… I… I need a drink, babe. I cannot function right now without one.”

Wednesday morning is their own—the excursion to the Ring of Kerry not scheduled until noon.
“Yeah, okay, that sounds good.” Draco pulled down the hotel duvet before stripping and laying down on his back. “Did you bring any condoms?”
Draco forced Potter to write his proposal right there on the floor beside Granger while Draco did the same. The sooner they could complete their two visits of the term, the sooner Draco could write his papers on them and worry about other classes.
And Draco could do nothing in the face of that sincere apology but laugh and make Potter promise to take him shopping for a Muggle cloak or whatever if he ended up getting cold. “I can’t believe I just received an apology where calling me a frosty bitch and pointy are somehow part of the apology and not what needs to be apologised
While Draco went to fetch them both a tea, Harry stopped in at the Tesco Express for sandwiches and crisps. They still had sweet pastries from their Costa breakfast run, but Harry just couldn’t pass up a good crisp combo for lunch. Also, Harry was enjoying the opportunity to stretch his legs.

and Draco Malfoy beneath him, scared, and Draco Malfoy not telling his father, his aunt, and there are knives and chandeliers and the sea and Dobby—Harry spends the days waiting for the goblin to recover, planning and working and preparing.  But the nights are spent drawing.
“I’m Harry, and this is Draco. I’ve never been to Ireland before, and I don’t think Draco has, either—” Draco shook his head, “—and this is actually our first ever coach trip. I’m really looking forward to it!” Harry beamed at the women, leaning forward to see past Draco.
And, as long as everything goes well crossing back into England, they'll be home before tea.
“Why the ever-loving fuck not? Those raunchy old bags wouldn’t care.”
In their first class of the term, the Muggle Studies professor had all of the Eighth-Year students partner with a student from another house, and, somehow, Draco had ended up with the great git himself. Potter, for his part, had not seemed overly hostile towards Draco and had even been part (or all) of the reason that Draco was able to return to Hogwarts at all. Only three days into their classes, plus the platform, train ride, and carriage journey, they had yet to speak to each other, although they had exchanged cordial nods when they passed in the halls or locked eyes in the Great Hall.
“Dammit, Potter, were you waiting for me to tell the story to propose?  You complete sap,” Draco is choking up a little, “of course I’ll marry you.  Ugh, I can’t believe you waited until I told that stupid story to propose.  I’m telling everyone we know how gross and mushy you are.”  Even as he complains, Draco is smiling sweetly at Harry, giving him his hand for the ring.
They sat at a table for four with two other members of their tour—an elderly couple by the names of John and Deirdre. John was a retired physician who started his training as a boy during the Second World War, while Deirdre taught primary until she'd retired ten years ago; but it was her first year without being on a list of possible substitutes in her county and they were taking this particular trip to inaugurate a new tradition.
But come summer, Harry would return to Privet Drive and Dudley and chores and no food and drawing.  He would spend the first few weeks of every summer holiday drawing—refreshing his skills, re-familiarizing himself with the textures of papers and pens and pencils, drawing and re-drawing the world around him in the smallest bedroom or in the library or the fields and parks, until he was back to the level he was at before he left for school.  Then he would hunt for new books in the library or reread his favourites, and learn new tricks and techniques and skills and styles, which he would practice and practice and practice until summer ended.  At least, that was his plan for each summer.  But usually, it didn’t work out that way.
Draco forgets that Harry should not be left in charge of planning trips when he declares that, finally for this year’s anniversary, they should do something “big” and Harry claims that it’s his treat, all of it.
“You can still go to Ireland,” is said in a tone of someone correcting a basic mistake.
He is suitably proud of himself.
It all started during Eighth Year, during their Muggle Studies class, which had been made mandatory for all returning students. Draco was actually somewhat interested in the material—he knew that the Pureblood ideologies he was raised with were, to put it gently,
Draco was practically dragged to the bar after they finished eating. While he had been planning on heading there anyway, he thought that Harry was being quite rude by dragging there with such haste.
The few members of their tour that were still gathering their bags snickered at Draco, and Harry flushed crimson when he realised how many people had heard at least part of Draco's rant.
are you doing here?”
“—I’m glad you have enough of a brain to recognise that—”
of portraits of Draco Malfoy as he bleeds out on the bathroom floor, blood pooling around him, tears drying on his cheeks, fire bright in his silver eyes.  These sketches, studies of Draco Malfoy in ink on parchment, never move—Harry avoids charming them; he draws them and quickly hides them, burying them in a box under his bed where his dorm-mates think he hides his porn.
Harry looked ridiculous by the time they needed to return to the coach. His already messy hair was ever more hopeless, some parts standing almost straight up from a few hours’ worth of strong, damp winds; cheeks ruddy for the same reason. Draco knew that he’d gone red-cheeked, and that his hair was tangled at the ends, but at least it still hung straight.
Hermione is, as always, the best. The brightest witch of their generation. And he tells her as much.
Harry sat in the middle again, chatting with Maude and Elin, as they began their journey into Ireland.  Even though he had only met them a few hours ago, he was already very comfortable with them—they were both sassy old things, and Elin could out-swear a sailor.  Harry, Draco noticed, didn’t retain his ‘these are old people and I should be polite around them’ sensibilities long.  They had all but disappeared by the time Maude finished her story about the time she accidentally accompanied her late husband and his mates to a gentleman’s club.  Her husband had been mortified, having no idea that his friends were taking him somewhere like that, nor any idea why they hadn’t changed the plan when Maude had decided to join them for the evening.  Maude, for her part, had been both embarrassed and aroused.
“You’ll let me snog you immediately after I’ve had my tongue up your arse, but one little peck on a public stone and now I need to be decontaminated like I’m hazardous. You really are a ponce, you know?”
And most importantly, he learned not to trust Harry Potter with the planning and preparation of any trip.
Thank you for reading!
“Swot,” Potter muttered, and Draco probably imagined that the exasperation was tinged with fondness.
Draco just shrugged and began boarding the coach. “I contain multitudes. It’s part of why you love me.”
Draco could tell that he had been insulted somehow, even if he didn’t understand it, but his good breeding and the teasing light in Potter’s eyes stopped him from making more than a token protest.
The beauty of the Ring of Kerry allowed them both to forget about their feelings of inferiority (who would have known that octogenarians were so rowdy??). The trees surrounding the narrow road were vibrant, and the mountains around them were damp with precipitation from the constant fog.
, not to mention antiquated and utterly unfounded, and he no longer had to pretend that he felt the way his father and his mad aunt wanted him to.
The show was good, but Harry was stifling yawns by nine and he could tell that Draco was no better. They finished their drinks and headed back to their room. They did little more than kiss for a bit before passing out, alarm set for 6:15 the next morning.
But then Ron comes back and there is no reason to draw anymore, no time to draw anymore—there is planning to do, and Horcruxes to find and destroy.  And things get better once the locket is gone, and the nightmares are less and it seems like they have a real chance at succeeding.  Until, suddenly, they don’t.  There are snatchers, and Malfoy Manor, and torture and
“Draco,” he wheedled, “your brain needs rest, too. You're a social person. You need to be around people.” He never managed to get Draco to agree to any big to-dos on campus, but he usually could pull him away for a day of shopping in Muggle London, or a trip to the cinema, and sometimes a quick run to a chippie. Harry always considered it a success.
Draco took one look around the room and smirked. “Look on the bright side, Potter. You get a bed tonight, rather than a couch or the floor.”
“So to see these women—it was enlightening.  Also, it turns out, I was maybe a little gay.  Who knew?” And as she laughed, she smiled at Elin, and Harry, and Draco.  “So, how’d you realise you prefer dick, so to speak?”

Especially when Harry proposes.
“You are not coming anywhere near me with those lips of yours until I know they’ve been cleaned and well sanitized,” Draco informed him.
As seemed to always be the case now, their lives fit together seamlessly.
He could understand what Elin had meant about the full coach being a bit of a determent. So far, the noise level and the crowding hadn’t really bothered him, but he could see it becoming an issue as the afternoon—and the trip—wore on and people started getting louder and chattier.
“Don’t worry, dear. You don’t need to be spry for everything,” one old lady, whose name Draco didn’t know, leered with a wink.
It was awful.
much luggage in the under-coach storage, so he was feeling pretty optimistic until he followed Harry onto the bus.
Both women giggled, but it was the blouse lady, seated at her own window seat, that responded. “We’re both very excited. This is our third trip to Killarney, you know. I think our driver is different this year, though. And they seem to have switched one of our hotel stays—but I just love Ireland, especially this time of year. Have you ever been before?” And, before they could respond, “Oh, goodness me, we forgot to introduce ourselves. I’m Maude, and this is Elin.”
They still hadn't had a “big thing” as Harry called it, but they had spent weekends away, gone to the cinema or the theatre, and even spent a weekend being Muggle London tourists.
Draco huffed. “I’m not using
, Potter. You know it’s too sticky to be practical. Let’s just fool around in the shower—but I’m holding you to the gelato.” Draco pulled himself off the bed and headed, naked, to the bathroom. “I can’t believe we forgot to fucking pack condoms… it’s a fucking anniversary holiday and we didn’t pack anything for sex…” Draco muttered the entire way to the shower.
“You boys seemed to enjoy the cruise this morning,” Joyce smiled at them, accent a stronger Welsh than any Harry had heard so far.
,” Potter muttered, “I can’t believe I didn’t realise how much of a swot you are.”
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
Harry laughed and darted off to the long queue winding its way down a path marked ‘This Way to the Blarney Stone.’
After the small M&S side-trip, and the spending spree that ensued, Draco began to take regular outings to the Muggle world with Potter, even though they weren’t mandatory again until after the Christmas hols.
Harry suspects that they were likely dating before the move, because they only discussed the second bedroom in terms of “should we use it as a guest room or convert it into a study?” and they had been sharing a bed for the better part of a year and a half at that point.
It turned out that Draco really enjoyed his two trips to the Muggle world with Potter.
, I don’t know what you think I meant, but I was just joking about you being a frosty bitch, I swear. And I'm sorry. Just, I didn’t even think. I was just all ‘oh Malfoy’s all pointy, he’s probably cold too; cold people need to use more warming charms.’ I promise I didn’t mean anything by it.”
They opted not to tour the factory, choosing instead to explore the beautiful town. It was right on a river, and the views were absolutely scenic. There was a museum not far from the crystal shop that they walked through, and they explored some interesting heritage sights nearby.

Draco had thought that they were likely to be an earlier pick-up, but if there were only three more stops left, most of the group should be aboard the bus. It hadn’t looked like there was
Draco led the way in the direction he suspected Killarney was, following the path of hotels, signage, and the church spires in the distance. They passed a local brewery on the way into the town and agreed to stop in on their way back to the hotel for dinner.
“That’s not true,” Harry interjects. “You don’t get to change the date whenever you want.  We have an official anniversary date.”
“Where is the stone circle located?” Draco asked at the tourist information centre. Harry gaped at Draco, which was somewhat uncouth, but also, somehow, endearing. Draco ignored him, to the best of his abilities, while he listened to the Muggle giving him walking directions. There was a path, and they could get cycles to get there faster if they wanted, but it wasn’t an outrageous journey to make on foot.
There were too many people, and he was stuck sitting beside a lovely older lady that he had never met before, his thigh mere inches from her own.  He wasn’t really used to being surrounded by this many people, not anymore, and he found it slightly disconcerting.
Harry, on the other hand, tried to get Draco to set aside his schedule from time to time.
“So, you’ll be rooming here… with me…” Draco trailed off, but then the situation seemed to sink in and he threw Harry a blinding smile. Harry told his heart to knock off that pounding thing it was doing. “I told you that you shouldn’t join the Aurors!” Draco crowed in delight, “I’m glad you’ve decided to try something different.” And he gave Harry a quick hug.
Maude and Elin raved about the previous evening’s show, while Pete, the man in the seat in front of them (who Draco almost beaned on the first morning), talked about how he and his wife, Gwyn, didn’t get back to their room until nearly two that morning, having spent their time after dinner wandering the town before doing some sort of pub crawl that ended at the hotel just minutes before the doors were locked for the evening.
dating. Excellent. Good to know. Um, not to be…whatever…but, um, how long, exactly have we been dating for? So I can be sure to do something for our anniversary.”
Despite the fact that Draco was very much a swot, he never tried to push Harry into his schedule—unless they were working on an assignment as a pair, which they tried to do in any class they shared whenever the instructor even mentioned partnering students up. When they were working together, Harry respected Draco’s schedule for the project and worked to meet his deadlines.
Thank you for reading :)
“And I love you too, you posh wanker.”
“Well, Draco, according to this memo provided to me, this is my dorm room for the year. So, I guess I need to ask: what are you doing here, in my room?” Harry leaned against the doorframe, ankles crossed, as he waited for Draco to react.
“I don’t want to choose somewhere that you and your BBC RP find inherently working class,” Potter had explained with a smirk as he tugged Draco across the Eighth Year common room to where Granger was seated by the hearth.
It is another night on their anniversary trip where they fall asleep before ten and without getting further along than a lazy snog in bed.
Harry would have captured Neville’s face as he swung the Sword, the fierce determination in his eyes, in a heartbeat.  That image should be copied and framed, turned into stamps and stationary, hung above the fireplace in his Nan’s sitting room, or framed on the bedside table in his parents’ room in St Mungo’s.
“Maybe if we were going to Camden Market you could get away with the cloak,” Potter had told him, “but with the museum crowds, you’d be better off looking like a public school pillock and being a bit cold. I’m sure you know wandless warming charms by now,” he’d added, smirking.
Harry honestly has the best of intentions. He has grand plans.
“That is absurd and blatantly untrue,” Draco cried, “as I have told you thousands of times before, Malfoys don’t snore. The inbreeding ensured that.” Somehow Draco kept a straight face as he stated that fact as though it was something high class and to be admired. Harry really loved the dork.
