Draco turned around to see Harry lying on the floor, laughing loudly. His eyes were twinkling again and he immediately recognized his ward again. This boy was the one he had raised. Draco felt his heart lighten again. Without thinking too hard about it, he had managed to get Harry back into his happy positive mind state. His ward ran out of the cupboard and fell around his neck.
He didn’t even have to use magic as the box opened with a small sound. Inside, Harry saw a few hundred pieces of parchment. Malfoy took out one and held it into the light where Harry could read it as well.
He looked at Harry as if he expected him to say no, to know his place in this world and it wasn’t in Hogwarts’ hospital wing. Harry smiled and tilted his head a little. “Why do you look so scared, darling?”
Draco waved a hand and shook his head. “Nevertheless, I’ve always seen these two together. The twins will most likely comment on how well made you two are for each other, Quidditch stuff and so on.” He walked closer and put an arm around Harry’s shoulder, walking him out of the office. “Ron will be freaking out, thinking that every interaction at Hogwarts between you and Oliver was somehow an indicator that you two liked each other and the rest... They’ll be happy for you two.”
He chuckled, once Draco put it down again. “You’ve gotten soft, Draco. A few months ago, you would have definitely emptied it over me!”
They turned another page to find little baby Potter playing with a black dog. Potter pointed at him in the picture and looked up at Draco again. “Hally!”
Shaking his head one more time, Draco denied any more answers. “I won’t answer that. It’s too specific. For now, you can still tell the Aurors honestly that I wasn’t there, but if I were to tell you the spell...”
There was rustling on the other end, when Peter finally started to talk. “I think I messed up.” Great.
He had just left the library, when he heard familiar sounding steps and turned around to see his boyfriend walking closer.
“Any way I can help you?” Harry asked and closed the door behind Severus, taking a few purchases away from him.
His rather impolite question didn’t seem to have any effect on her, as she chuckled and kept the forced cheeriness up. “Well, since you’re not coming by so often, I have decided to come and look for you instead.”
Draco’s ward turned to him and had a somewhat hopeful look in his eyes. “Sorry, bear” Draco smiled and motioned towards Pansy. “What she said.”
Pansy didn’t seem to think about this, since she nodded and continued talking. “Well, we wanted to know if you know of any other things that happened to him when he was with his relatives. We need to be prepared, you know.”
Currently, they were on their way to get out of England. However, with the amount of magic Alamar and Aurora had found in Harry’s home, Eric wasn’t going to take the boy out of the country without having him looked at by some friends. Luckily, he knew exactly where to find them.
From what I could read between the lines of your letter, Harry seems to have a little problem with his sleep. I have a book that could help you with all the problems you might… you know what? I’ll just send it to you as well. Please take care of it, as it is my only copy and Nymphadora actually gave it to me. I trust you know how to handle presents.
It made the little Gryffindor grin a little and hid his face in Draco’s chest. “She’s right, bear. Now, eat what’s on your plate.” Draco gave Pansy the silent order to give Harry half of what was on his plate as well, so he had a full plate and could actually eat everything. Pansy followed order and once Harry was showing his face again, she held his plate out towards him with a fork.
The air sizzled and out of his wand shot a few silvery blue strings quickly forming a huge stag and he galloped around the air made a circle and charged at Harry, coming to a halt right before him.
Harry grinned and shrugged his shoulders. He wasn’t even hiding the pleasure he got from all these confused and slightly angry looks. This moment right here was amazing. And he was certainly going to show it to Draco when they were back home. Waking him up right now wasn’t entirely productive, especially since he also needed to go to their pizzeria. Maybe he could first bring Draco home, though perhaps he wouldn’t want that.
Draco had stared at the letter an official owl from Gringott’s had delivered just now for quite a while. Something told him that this wasn’t just a normal letter. It was the same kind of feeling he’d had when Potter was being tormented by the nightmare.
I love you Pansy and we’ll talk as soon as I’m able to stand there and feel like I’ve accomplished something. Having no job and being homeless doesn’t really seem as if I can achieve things, so I might need a few more days.
His best friend pointed at his shirt and looked closer.“Because your shirt is red!” He leaned so close Harry wasn’t sure what to do next.
Thank you so much for this uplifting notice, Ginny. Really helped me in not thinking about my death… Anyway. Let’s hope it stays like this for a few more days or maybe weeks…!
It was his happiest memory: the world had been okay at this point. His parents were still rather... strict, but they were nice and loving. He had gotten the smoothest, fluffiest jumper he had ever had. And he had treasured it as long as he could.
They had of course asked Harry to be Dominique’s godfather, but he had thought it was a little too much, since he already had Teddy and Rose. However, he had promised them to be the godfather of the next child they were having, if there was a third one. So now, he was in fact Louis’ godfather, which couldn’t have been better as he himself had an almost familiar problem…
“No, we just realized we wanted to live together. What do you plan on doing after Hogwarts?” Pansy asked and took a sip of her cup of what seemed to be strong black coffee.
Potter chuckled. “Yes. I had to come up with another name, since I realized rather quickly that people just wanted to meet me, not really find a partner. So it’s Milos King.”
question my interest and love in your son. But my relationship with him is none of your concern. When and if we get married is just our decision, nobody else’s.” He stepped forward and Draco saw his expressions going blank. With all of a sudden, he realized how much Harry could have been a pureblood wizard, if he chose to. It seemed, as if he had practice with doing this. Though, Draco had to be honest: He didn’t like this. He liked his emotional Gryffindor much more. Meanwhile, Harry continued: “It’s not like I’m invading your relationship with your wife now, am I?”
“He sounds like he was a great man” Harry commented. Sometimes he wished he had such stories to tell about his family.
“Good morning!” Neville said, grabbing their Kneazel and placing him on his lap, as he sat down by the table. Merlin looked curiously onto what was present to him so closely, though Neville expertly kept him away from getting anything.
Draco chortled and quickly turned away, sitting down at a table. He felt Potter’s eyes on him, before Connor answered defensively. “Come on, Sirius! I take my job very seriously! Not a pun, by the way! And I would never ever read letters.”
As luck would have it, her boyfriend just so happened to walk closer and he widened his eyes at her actions. “Oh for Merlin’s saggy tits, no, Hermione!”
Neville next to them snickered and shook his head. “I would have been scarred for my entire life.” Harry grinned and clapped his back. In all fairness, had he been in his first year, having just heard about the magical world a few days ago and then… seeing live dragons flying in… yes, that would have probably scarred him as well.
Nodding, Draco walked closer to his ward. “And are you feeling better or do you need a little more time alone?”
Ron snorted. “You did. When we met in the Common Room you told us, you’d be going down to the Great Hall for some early morning breakfast and we decided to come with you. Then a few feet away from the door, you told us to go ahead, you forgot your phone and walked back in. And after that you needed over an hour to come back down?”
Looking at him, slightly confused, Draco stopped at the door, closing it quickly again, in case someone was there and would’ve then been able to listen in on their conversation. “What, love?”
have been undercover for more than two weeks. Why would I need to come back? I’m sure he’s around here and that I can find him.”
Eric chuckled and ruffled through his hair. He was about to say something, when another voice interrupted their little discussion.
Severus got up and walked through the gate, while Potter actually pouted over the loss of his playing friend. He sat down on his arse and stared daggers into the back of Severus’ head, until he turned around and somehow created an old-looking teddy bear which made baby Potter clearly incredibly happy. The teddy bear was yellow and looked incredibly soft, with a fire red bow tie and a green knitted jacket firmly locked in place. Potter was now actually laughing over the bear.
Chuckling, Harry winked at him and shrugged his shoulders. “You’ve seen me train all throughout Hogwarts, Olly, there’s nothing new!”
There were five cauldrons neatly stacked on each other, a wooden rack which was full of magically preserved ingredients stood in the middle of the room under a what Draco presumed was a magical plant lamp. It was stronger than the other three lamps in this rather big room and the plants that were alive on the very top of the rack seemed to enjoy it.
Slowly, Harry walked up to the door and looked through the glass. He saw the same room, though from a different angle. He could see through the hallway right to the front door, where magic seemed to come through, though it was still locked. A grand piano, with as must dust on it as the table, stood to his right and under the window, he had looked through earlier was a small pillow, placed there as if the people living there had an animal and wanted give it a little bit of comfort. On the shelves in the living room were old pictures of places around the world, books in all sizes and a rose incased in glass – as if Belle and the Beast had lived here after their adventure in the king’s castle. At the wall to his left, the two wizards on the boat were once again waving at him. They seemed to tell him to come inside.
Harry smiled and pointed at the cage. “Should we still do that or do you just want to hide away from everyone?”
“What did ye mean then?” Harry jerked by the sudden voice next to him and he turned to see Seamus next to him walking. Dean was also pretty much behind them and Harry hoped that they hadn’t heard everything.
“Oh, I’m sorry about that” she said in a not really apologetically voice. “You’re Joseph Cambell, right?” The Hufflepuff nodded half-heartedly. “Thank you, Cambell, that’ll be fifty points from Hufflepuff.”
Harry put his finger up to his mouth, reminding Draco to stay quiet. The dog looked at him funnily and Harry was sure that the Slytherin didn’t understand a thing of what was going on. In reality, he also didn’t know why he was rescuing Draco, though his only thought was that maybe… maybe that man could save him.
Surprisingly, he was actually able to fall asleep. Well, this sleep was then interrupted. A few hours later, Draco woke up from someone shaking his shoulder. He growled and was just about to snarl at his best friend who once again was waking him up way too early, when he caught sight of someone else.
Bursting out laughing, Draco walked over and jumped out of reach from Harry swimming closer, until he was caught in a hug by a dripping wet, but incredibly happy adult Harry Potter.
Draco opened the door quickly, checked the room and found it empty, except for Millicent reading some book in their secret hide-out spot.
Draco wet his lips and stared at the stag, before shaking his head. “It is. I totally forgot my Patronus was a stag.” Should he tell Harry that he had originally had a swallow? Well, a stag was much more intimidating than a bird, so maybe not. His ward also seemed clearly excited over the animal and as the stag walked closer, he held out his hand.
Harry soon didn’t pay any more attention to the people inside the Common Room and started learning by himself. He could ask Malfoy out another time, maybe after their crazy weeks in Hogwarts. It couldn’t be all that bad, right?
Before he could fall into a somewhat deep depression, the couch seemed to get heavier and he turned his head, to face Harry.
They were out of the Hospital Wing in no time and Draco grinned at his ward. He had been so brave and he really needed to get a reward for being such an amazing young man!
Daphne chuckled. “Frankly, Draco, I always hated Harry, until he came storming in that time and declared his undying love for you in front of all of us” Her expression became dreamy, while Harry blushed violently. Draco chuckled as well, with such a fondness in his eyes that Harry had almost threw all caution into the wind and kissed him right here, right now. However, he remained where he was and gave his husband a soft smile. “Seeing you two together… There’s no question, really. You love him, he loves you. I love you two!”
Getting up, he looked around the room and grinned when he saw Potter hiding behind Theodore, who was trying his hardest to pretend that he didn’t care. Draco could see how something had warmed his heart and it seemed almost impossible to return Theodore to his former self. Potter had caught him with his cuteness as well.
Neville was fighting hard to keep his grin hidden and he couldn’t bite it down for too long, before he snorted. “Harry, there really isn’t any berry inside.”
Draco seemed to want to convince him that there was in fact nothing wrong with him. Harry knew better. He leaned closer and pressed a soft kiss on his lips. Making sure that Draco was aware that he loved him. There was nothing he wouldn’t do for him. Absolutely nothing.
Harry was speechless. They had found the people writing the love letters! That was incredible! “So, what happened to them?”
Harry widened his eyes, just about to ask him how he ‘figured that out’, when Daphne caught on and started laughing.
Eric smirked. “She’s a Krimnee.” He placed a bowl of what seemed like small chunks of meat on the floor and the owl-cat meowed and jumped towards the food. “They’re very rare and we saved one of the last living creatures with her. Krimnees have the body of a cat and the wings and head of an owl.” He pointed at the features he explained and finally sat down between Harry and Alamar.
He leaned in and put his hands around him quickly. Whatever Draco was feeling for him, he was apparently also feeling for him. The overpowering scent of coffee took over all of his senses. Harry’s warm skin seemed like his own personal sanctuary. Draco lost the time in the sensations of what was Harry Potter.
Draco knew the instant the worker told them about the owl’s traumatic past that there was no way Harry was going to look at another owl. He probably saw himself in the owl and actually, from the looks of it, the owl wasn’t scared.
Chuckling, Neville accepted the form again and made a copy of that as well. “Hey, since we’re already talking about happiness” he blushed slightly and Harry frowned a little. Before he had any chance to ask what was going on, his friend continued, “Are you interested in going out with me?”
Draco hesitated, before he looked up at him, still incredibly worried. Harry ran his hand through his hair and smiled softly, nudging him wordlessly to say whatever he wanted to address. Finally, Draco sighed and placed his head back onto the pillow.
Pansy brought him back to his sad reality and placed a hand on his knee. “Well, it’s a little late for that, don’t you think, Draco? We both are on the dark side, me having wanted to give him to the Dark Lord and you, actually having the Dark Mark on your arm…”
Now it was Pansy’s turn to frown. “So whom does this ring belong to?” She motioned to the wedding band and Harry could see Draco realizing what she was talking about.
The Headmistress nodded, knowingly and chuckled. “No rush. I’m just glad we have cleared the question of who would want to be the next Headmaster.”
Draco scoffed and shook his head. He wasn’t his father and the color was matching Harry’s color quite nicely. Actually, Weasley had given him a few more jumpers when they had their last play date (he had been a lot nicer and Draco somehow suspected Granger to have something to do with it, but he didn’t say a word). Well, all the jumpers were growing with Potter, though not all the way. It was still something nice to have.
And well, it all ended with Harry yawning for the fifth time in one minute and Draco picking up his almost asleep ward and bringing him back to their room, where he placed him in his bed. He then climbed into his own and yawned before falling asleep himself. He hadn’t slept this well for a long time and he was sure it had something to do with good music before bed.
He took a breath, it all just smelled like amber and musk, all he could see where the half opened grey eyes and the miniscule smile on Draco’s lips. Harry leaned closer, when all emotions broke over him like a wave breaking at the rocks and tears started running down his face.
There was a warm scent of cake in the air and Molly’s special Christmas Tea. Luna sat at the table with a few friends from Dubledore’s Army. He greeted them and after a little small talk, Ginny grabbed two slices of cake and they walked into Luna’s office.
In fact, these two Slytherins hadn’t moved or apparently breathed while Harry was on the phone, as if pretending not to exist was going to make them the best spies possible. Harry grinned again as he started walking to Padfoot and ruffled his fur.
Kevin laughed. “Yes! Do you want to call her back and ask? I mean, I couldn’t believe it when I first heard it myself, but…”
“Um.” Harry chuckled. “Hello love?” He tried to hide the smirk that was forming on his lips. Draco seemed so annoyed for no apparent reason and it made Harry almost laugh out loud.
Shaking these thoughts, Harry entered the room, lighting his way by his own wand. Malfoy followed carefully, as if he still wanted to see that Harry was okay, and they looked at the mess that was left behind. Something seemed to grab Harry’s attention and he crouched down to grab a piece of parchment that didn’t look finished.
Frowning, Draco remembered the letter Remus had written him about the Magical Guardian’s Test. “No, Remus told me about the Guardian test! It just looks at the people in close radius and takes them into account. I think the Gryffindor Tower was just too high to be included in...”
Raising his head, Draco smirked at the Gryffindor and shrugged his shoulders. “People say all kinds of things to the ‘mysterious stranger’, but Mrs Williams had been talking to me yesterday.”
“Because I see how happy you are, with so many happy childhood memories. I’m jealous of you!” Draco glared at his hands, more tears running over his face. “I want to have happy memories of my childhood as well, yet I’m here, thinking about my stupid parents. My mother who took my fucking name and my father who only cared enough when he got out of Azkaban.”
She smirked. “We’re cousins. Our mothers were sisters and while his family stayed in the UK to fight on
She gently rubbed over her stomach and smiled. “Not according to my mother, who is in such a distress right now about how everyone will realize I’m pregnant when I’m getting married.” She rolled her eyes and looked at Blaise, who shrugged his shoulders.
Before this could get any more out of hand, Harry interrupted these two angry idiots. “Look, the door is locked; maybe we can find something on the outside. I know a lot of Aurors might have already tried this, but we’re new ones, with new eyes on the subject. Maybe we’ll find something they haven’t seen.”
He didn’t have to defend himself more, as Weaslette jumped in, followed by Granger and even Lovegood. All of this - actually this whole situation - was so new to Draco that he had no idea what he should do.
Draco chuckled. “Correct. However, unlike some of us” he looked accusingly towards Harry, “I can actually hold my alcohol. And a glass of wine never hurts during a meal.”
Smirking, Harry sat at the edge of a huge bathtub – it was more a small swimming pool. His legs were in the water and he played with it, happily splashing it around. Suddenly another loud splash made both men look over to the corner, where a small dog pool was situated, where Padfoot enjoyed his water. The room really did know what Harry wanted to have here.
“I have a feeling you’ve changed your name again” Madam Pomfrey continued, already having caught onto what Draco was insinuating.
“Actually” Draco interrupted these two idiots, “I was wondering whether I could come by sometime soon and get an owl myself. I’ve been disowned by my family and I need a way of communicating in the Wizarding World.”
that the snake wouldn’t enter. His father had hurt him badly once when he had closed the door out of fear of this damned snake. The Dark Lord didn’t like closed doors – people could be talking bad things about him, theoretically. So all doors had to be open at all times.
Madam Pomfrey was back and handed Longbottom a vial with some yellow glowing substance, which he downed without even questioning it. He had definitely spent enough time in the Hospital Wing that he wasn’t even going to ask something anymore. She quickly dried his clothes and nodded.
Their professor looked around and beamed. “This is also very well done!” he praised, though he was clearly unable to see who cast it.
“That’s… possible?” Harry asked and tried to wrap his head around the fact that something like that existed in the wizarding world. A male pregnancy? That was crazy!
After a few silent moments, Harry looked up and beamed at him. It seemed as if he had forgotten about the drama before. Or as if he was just coming to terms with it. Well, what his ward wanted was a complete surprise to Draco.
Harry snorted, knowing that his husband was correct. “With a jealous man like you as my husband, I do have to keep the flirters in check, unless I want to have an army of dead men and women left behind.”
“Well no, this time he complained that the women we give him are all not suitable for what he needs.”
Draco chuckled and nodded. He suddenly heard the door of the office open without a doorbell and while Kevin wrote a few things down, he heard Maria talking outside.
“Nothing!” Harry shook his head. Suddenly, the pain in his temple seemed too much and he wanted to touch it, when Malfoy pushed his hand away.
Harry rubbed his forehead. “Maybe he thought Hogwarts would help him somehow contain his powers. Or maybe even give him a purpose? Did you know he was conceived by his mother using a love potion on his father? His mother was a Gaunt.”
“Harry! Where have you been?” Ron greeted him and grinned. “When I woke up, you were gone and you weren’t at breakfast neither!”
Draco glared at the poor book as if it was the reason the author chose to use words and sentences that didn’t make sense and also… he had been studying for a few hours and probably couldn’t form one decent sentence.
Eric smiled down at the boy. “We’re going to Russia, Slugger. No one’s going to look there for us and we can live happily ever after.”
Even though Harry had used the Muggle term, Draco still knew what he meant. “I think it was good. I can’t really tell right now.”
“Yes” Eric chuckled. “However a few thousand years ago, before the wizards even realised they could harvest magic, the Ljósálfar were one colony with the Dökkálfar, the dark elves. When the wizards found magic, they went underground, claiming the night and the Ljósálfar believed that wizards could be responsible and stayed. Somewhere in Harry’s family tree, there must still be a Dökkálfar who must have passed down the night vision.”
Harry snorted, knowing that he would throw that hex he was expecting the second he thought he was safe. Just because he had a Protego up right now, didn’t mean that he was going to be protected all the time.
Draco was quiet for a few moments, until he frowned and shook his head. “It’s far too early for something like that, Harry. What is that even supposed to mean?”
Nodding, Draco shook his hand and sat down across from him. “I hope you weren’t waiting for too long.”
“You can say it, Draco” Pansy smirked. “She’s crazy!” she said to Harry and sighed. “She is Bella’s sister for a reason.”
Draco’s mother chuckled, as if Draco had asked the funniest question. “Oh, he comes by approximately three times in two months. And we’ve had these lovely meetings for the past five years, I believe.”
Harry turned and looked down at Padfoot, pretending that the dog was the most important thing on this planet. At the same time, he hid a smirk as he saw Ron’s incredibly angry facial expression from the corner of his eyes.
“So, now what?” Ron asked and frowned. “We could try and get out through the hole in the wall, right?”
That was amazing news! Harry could get all his memories back and he wouldn’t have to be tortured by whatever age he was going to be! However... how bad could it be to get everything at once...? Maybe there were some things that could go wrong...
Shrugging, Harry grinned back at him. “Since you can’t catch me, I don’t see how you can teach me a lesson.”
So once again, he groaned and got up, grabbed his favorite sweater and wandered to his godfather. The door to his office was closed, but after a soft knock, it opened and Severus stood there. Was he ever sleeping? He wasn’t even wearing clothes that could be considered for bed…
It seemed as if this had taken all the skills Pansy had to talk away from her. She sat there, staring at the ring as if she was deep in thoughts or as if she was trying to figure out if there was a name supposed to be inside. Blaise pointed at it and asked: “May I?”
So, once everyone had eaten enough (even though all of them had eaten less than usual), they got up and started looking for Harry again.
The fact that Harry was having visions was also something that confused Draco. From all his knowledge, there should have been no curse handing out visions just for the reason of having visions. Usually, it was something like what the Dementors were doing: showing the worst memories as visions, having people from your past telling you off and all that other shit.
“I wouldn’t be so sure” Harry mused and grabbed the potion he had in his pockets. He moved it over the table, where his husband rolled his eyes, though still downed it without questioning anything.
Draco nodded cautiously. “He is.” Both were looking at each other, expecting something else. Draco waiting for another question, Molly probably wanting him to elaborate a little. Well, Draco complied after a few quiet seconds, in which only the twin’s counting could be heard. “He has a few setbacks… We need to visit the healer weekly, other than that, he’s very happy. He laughs a lot.”
The doorbell sounded and Draco jumped up from the couch almost at the same time as Pansy. However, neither had been fast enough to open the door, as Severus had for some reason already stood there. Had he been waiting as well?
about you!  Which is the highest honour, by the way, Terrance. It means he likes you a lot” she winked at Terrance, while Harry rolled his eyes. She then quickly turned back to him. “How could you, Harry, I always asked about you dating someone!”
Luckily, the Ministry had upgraded to phones for their undercover Aurors. It would have been weird for someone to take out their wand and call someone else.
“And you said ‘fuck no’, because you already knew you wanted a divorce!” He looked as if he had just now realized that this had ‘happened’ because of that reason.
“I know, but… I mean, I have memories now and they’re all so weird and bad.” He stopped, taking a sip from his cup and looked up at Draco as if he was assessing him. “Did you make fun of me because I didn’t have parents?”
Harry was shocked to see her, but he quickly caught himself again. “It’s nice to see you too, professor. Would you like something to drink? Or to eat? It would be my treat.”
“Aren’t service dogs for blind people?” Draco asked, before he sniggered. “Never mind, works for you as well.”
He couldn’t continue, as Draco moved forward and crashed his lips on his, kissing him deeply. He pulled his hips closer and pushed him to lie down. Harry chuckled, once he was able to breath again and he looked at his husband straddling his lower body to the bed.
Before he could say anything however, another knock could be heard. Harry frowned “What is going on today? It's like everyone wants a piece of us today!”
“Thank you, Dray.” Draco heard when he had almost closed the door to his ward’s room. It was so soft and sleepy, that Draco couldn’t just let it go. He opened the door slightly again and glanced inside. Harry rolled onto his side, a content expression on his face and he sighed. Yes, this was where he belonged.
“No, first breakfast” he insisted and looked at Eric as if he couldn’t believe what his husband was saying. Harry grinned and watched as these two seemed to have a stare-off going on. It wasn’t surprising that Alamar won, since Eric sighed and turned to Harry, shaking his head.
Harry groaned. He couldn’t figure out if he was already incredibly turned on or if that groan was out of pure frustration. “Don’t take so fucking long!” His body was pulsating at every touch of his husband, needing him more than anything. “I can’t hold back any longer.”
“You can see the stars! And you can open this in the summer for fresh air or close it when it gets too hot in here! I’ve fallen in love with this apartment ever since I saw this!” Harry beamed when he looked up again.
“It’s a good way to start over. People need to drink, I can meet new people – normal people – and I keep hiding in plain sight.” Potter said very impartial, apparently not wanting to argue over something he seemed to enjoy.
“Wow, hold on” Harry held up his hands. “What is that supposed to mean?” He laughed and pulled Draco into a hug once he had greeted his father.
Frowning slightly, Draco turned it into a smirk and shrugged his shoulders. “I’ll take that as a compliment. Thanks, Weasley.”
“I heard you’re not doing good, but this is another level. Are you dying?” Draco asked upfront and sat down on another chair.
“Ginny threatened you to come?” Ron asked and Harry laughed and nodded. He showed Ron his phone and the text message of where Ginny basically stopped all his questions and reasons why he couldn’t do it.
Harry shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly and smirked. “I just told it that today I wouldn’t be telling it what to do. If the Hat thinks Gryffindor or Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff was better, okay. If it thinks I should be Slytherin... That’s fine as well.”
“This is your room for now.” He opened the door and Draco finally saw his rather small room. Even though it was this small, it was extremely cosy and beautifully decorated.
Once again... now or never. “Well, I was wondering if you had an idea of how to... ask someone out?”
Potter started talking, though he was slurring the words. Draco listened and could figure out most of what the Saviour was talking about. The winery was one of a few that had a vineyard right next to it. It was small so they didn’t have that much wine on hand. However, people loved it.
They stayed quiet, just enjoying the other’s company. Harry kissed Draco’s forehead from time to time, just reminding his husband that he loved him deeply. And every time Harry did so, Draco hummed happily and relaxed even further into his hug.
Harry stopped breathing for a few seconds. Fertility? As in… children? What did that mean?! He searched his husband’s expression for something, but he couldn’t find whatever it was he was looking for. Not even he knew what that was.
“I have no idea” Draco answered, placing his satchel on his bed and holding his hand out for the swan. He did catch Pansy craning her neck to see what was written there.
Aaaand my painful existence continues. Why was I ever under the impression that I could get better just like that?! Symptoms today include more visions, a high fever, slight headache and a stomach pain I haven’t felt in years. My ears are hurting and I can’t really open my eyes. Every light is too much for them.
For the first time in forever, Draco was whistling again, when he crossed the road to once again another unknown location. Harry was leading him to all kinds of different places with this adventure. He was on his way to the office of this Gryffindor and the address led him to a little outskirt of Muggle London into Creature London. Out here, you could meet literally anything.
Draco smirked and turned to the newer handwriting, not willing to think about anything else. It wasn’t as messy as he remembered Harry’s handwriting to be. That was a clear sign that Pansy and Blaise had done a good job in teaching him reading and writing.
Draco and Pansy froze both, unable to come to an explanation. Draco especially didn’t know what to think of that. It couldn’t be true, right? All of that was a joke. Maybe even a test to see if he actually felt something for him…?
“Eric” Alamar had a hard time hiding his smirk, yet he still decided to repeat his question. “Love, what are you doing?”
“Hey!” Hermione looked at him accusatory, to which Draco just held up his hands in mocked surrender.
Right now, Draco had a little bit of quiet, since Pansy and Millicent had offered to take Harry to the owlery to take care of Dag. The owl had gotten so much better under Harry’s care and he even let Draco pet him for a bit without being scared. It seemed as if what Draco had done for Harry, his ward now gave to his owl. Well, he was just happy that Harry had someone to help, since this trait did belong to him.
The Slytherin stepped into the room with wide eyes, as if he had just realized what he had spoken about before. “Well, it looks so… lived in! But a few moments ago, when I was here, it looked dirty and decrepit. Did you use some magic to see what it looked like a few centuries ago?”
Everything he had stowed away ever since he had seen Sirius dying in front of him came back. All the people that died for him, all the pain he had to endure, everything. He cried into Draco’s shoulder, holding him so tightly, that he was afraid he was going to break him.
“Darling, you can’t always be the one to solve my problems. Sometimes, we need to accept help from others too.” Harry caught Draco’s hand which he wanted to pull back and kissed the palm of his hand. “Besides, my handsome Snake: every second of every day around you is making me feel better. My life is better if you’re in it.”
Nobody in this room seemed to understand what Harry needed them to understand. Hermione and Ron would clearly not be happy if he wanted to talk to them about liking Draco Malfoy... He hadn’t really talked to Neville in their eighth year and Zabini... why would Harry go and talk to a Slytherin?! What kind of suicide was he doing there!?
Even though Harry wanted to talk about something else, he started talking about the other topic. “She made me win! And Ze swapped two pieces.” Draco’s ward placed his head on Draco’s chest and snuggled closer.
Luckily it seemed, as if that sentence alone was completing the chaos, as their classmates started screaming, commenting, discussing and arguing with each other whether or not Harry had the right to say something like that. While some discussions were about their broken relationship and whether or not one could prioritize money over happiness and a relationship, most were talking about if Toby worked for this pizzeria, which was why Harry was always leaving when that pizzeria was calling.
“You” Pansy answered and winked at him. Harry huffed and shook his head, looking over to Blaise, though he didn’t tell her to stop flirting with him. Maybe he knew that she wasn’t going to actually go out with him.
Harry smirked. “Come on, Draco. I am the Boy Who Lived; of course all things terrible will happen to me! I’m still waiting for my friends to tell me that they’ve had enough with all my sickness and everything and walk out of my life so that I end up alone.”
With only a little chuckle, Harry finally turned on his back and wiped the tears out of his face. “That was good!”
“Eric?! I cannot believe it!” A blond woman walked up to the table. She was wearing all black and a name tag from the restaurant on which stood ‘Kira’. Her dark blue eyes were full of life and very interested. “How did we both run away and find each other in Russia of all places?!”
“I don’t care anymore!” Harry growled and pressed his forehead against Draco’s. “I am too much in love with you and quite frankly too turned on for anything else to matter.”
Hermione smirked. “I don’t think that’s true.” She accepted the tea Harry placed on the kitchen table and smiled at him. “Are you interested in coming over on Christmas? Or do you want to – again – spend it with this secret boyfriend of yours?”
“I think you’re losing touch with reality, Draco” Harry said and he was clearly trying his hardest to bite back his laughter, though he was close to breaking. And that was Draco’s goal right now.
Smiling, Harry nodded and crossed his legs. “Draco, there’s something I don’t understand: I have a lot of memories and they... they’re not good. About you. But you’re so different! How can you be so... evil and now you’re the best person I know?”
Luna chuckled. “Didn’t you say, sometimes there are House Elves looking in and messing with things? Maybe it’s just them.”
Ginny nodded and smiled at the two of them. “You know what? I had intended on making Blaise as uncomfortable as possible, just to see what you would go through and if you really liked Harry...”
Harry nodded and lay his head against Draco’s shoulder, knees bent and the blanket over his knees (and Draco’s as well) as he started the movie again. There was no better day than the one where he could watch his favourite movie twice in a row.
This time it was Harry who interrupted Draco, while he laughed. “Dray, stop it! I promise! I don’t break promises!”
“Here are the rules” Draco started and sat down at the table again, Potter on his lap. “If you want something from Potter, come and talk to me. Should he get uncomfortable with anyone here, I’ll stop this play date even if you think you’re having fun. If you’re taking him out of the Room of Requirement, I will regardless of what the headmistress says, never again invite you to another play date. I’m doing this because McGonagall and Severus told me to do so, not because I wanted to. If it goes well, I might consider doing another play date. It all depends on whether or not Potter likes being here.”
“How much of that did you hear?” Potter asked suddenly and Draco realised that he was standing right in front him.
Draco stumbled into the Common Room, almost walking into Millicent, who had been about to leave the room. She stopped and helped him to their secret space, where all his friends were sitting. Once they saw him, every discussion seized.
Nodding, she took her wand, closed her eyes and started the spell. “Et recordabor omnia!” Her voice had changed to be quite dark and almost a whisper, while she kept repeating it. The room transformed into almost a storm cloud and with a huge bang, Charlie opened her eyes and blinked a few times, shaking her head, as if something bad had just happened. The storm cloud had disappeared and she coughed quickly.
Harry saw Draco widen his eyes and look for an escape route, so his attention drew him to another Malfoy member – Lucius to be exact – who seemed to be cutting the room. Harry looked back at his former classmate and found Draco trying and failing to find a way to get away from his fast approaching father.
Harry rolled his eyes, but laughed nevertheless. “Thanks for this explanation. Can we now enjoy Christmas?”
“You haven’t been following my rules, have you, Sirius?” he asked and placed the bag he had brought with him on the table. “Have you been sleeping?”
Harry shook his head. “I should have known. Fred was just here and left to go to his brother’s wedding. I don’t think he’s getting married; he already is.”
And then there was Blaise Zabini. Why on Earth would he ask a Slytherin for help? Ever?! No, he needed to do this on his own.
Rolling his eyes, Harry leaned back and shook his head. “Nothing’s going on, I swear! I’m more interested in you, ‘Mione, anyways. What did the Healers say?”
“Well” Harry grabbed another pancake and leaned back in his chair. “I got you out of Azkaban, yet no Auror has been here to check if I had something to do with your disappearance and you’re not really looking like you’re dealing with nightmares or something.” He narrowed his eyes. “When Sirius escaped, he was extremely messed up and here you are… behaving as if you’ve just come by for some afternoon tea after we’ve been friends for the last ten years.”
about everything. He didn’t stop once until they reached McGonagall’s office, where they floo’d over to the Weasley’s.
Toby laughed at the other side of the call. “Once you’re done with that, I’ll text Draco to tell him what you’re up to. I hope you’re prepared for this kind of destruction of whoever is listening in.”
“No, we won’t!” Malfoy said sternly. “Stop panicking and start thinking like an Auror, Weasley.  If there’s a problem, there’s also a solution. All magical objects that have either gained or magically gotten empathy have a place where they store things they don’t want people to see. We need to find that thing and figure out why it let us inside, but won’t let us leave.”
Draco snorted and choked on his coffee, coughing and not knowing how to play this off. Harry could only barely keep his laughter silent and rubbed a tear out of his face. “Then again, maybe Peeves is bleeding and you got all of that into your hair.”
Only once he was far away enough from his former classmates and once he made a magical check that no human soul was around did he start laughing. He laughed and hugged his huge dog, burying his face into his fur.
Severus raised his eyebrows as Draco turned to the door and grinned over his godfather’s answer. “Peach? That’s highly unlikely to achieve. Well, to achieve a nice taste with peach. Anything easier? Strawberry? Coffee?”
The redheaded man, apparently George, turned to look at a thirteen year old Harry standing in his shop, frowning at him.
“Since we’re already talking about seeing people” Weasley started and turned to Kingsley. “I saw Neville, Parkinson and Greengrass walking in the rain when I went to look for Hermione around half past ten. I’m pretty sure Neville created this rain.”
Harry was just about to nod, when he turned around again and saw that there was a door they hadn’t seen yet. It was on the opposite side of the kitchen entrance, open. And it was the darkest black Harry had ever seen. “I think this thing leads to the cellar” Harry commented and motioned towards it.
“Come on” Harry smirked and put his arms around Draco, walking into the extremely empty Common Room and through the tunnel into their party room.
Harry chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “Most of them don’t exist anymore. So she might know more, now!”
Aurora meowed painfully and jumped on top of the mattress, when Harry ripped his eyes open and sat up, shook. Alamar smiled weakly and illuminated the tip of his wand softly, just so that Harry could see him. Aurora purred loudly and rubbed her head on his face, while Alamar sat down carefully.
“I…” Harry licked his lips, knowing full well that there was one topic where they couldn’t see eye to eye. “In my future, I see children.”
That was the wrong way to go down. Pansy narrowed her eyes and then raised her eyebrows. “Don’t bring her into this, Dray, I happen to know quite a few stories about yours too and I know a lot of stories about you. If you talk about my mother again, I’ll tell Harry a really embarrassing one about you...”
With that, she turned back to her essay and Draco chuckled. He looked over to Pansy who smiled at him. She turned back to Potter who yawned and snuggled closer to her, before falling asleep, while Pansy kept humming for a few more moments.
Harry sat straight and widened his eyes. “How did you find out? I only told Ginny, Ron and Hermione…”
While Draco walked along the dungeon’s corridor to the Common Room with a new found swing in his steps, he wondered if he would ever call Severus ‘dad’ or ‘father’. Would he even appreciate that? Or maybe he wanted it?
Over in Mrs. Figg’s old house, Boy was sure he had seen a window open and he could hear some faint laughter. It seemed as if there was finally some life in there. Mrs. Figg to him had always looked half dead, so he wasn’t surprised when she had died.
Harry rolled his eyes and let go of Draco, climbing over the sofa. In the meantime, Draco cleared a spot for him on the couch.
“Of course I am!” Harry grinned and again motioned him to walk closer, as he hadn’t done so until now. “So, come here, my gorgeous snake.”
Without missing a beat, Kingsley nodded. “The spell used is one the Ministry currently thinks about blacklisting... And after what we’ve seen, it definitely has the potential of being very harmful. Anyway, we’re done here.” He motioned them to leave the room, though turned to Draco and the professors. “A word, Mr. Malfoy? You may stay as well, Minerva and Severus.”
Draco nodded. He smiled at his boyfriend and the two of them fell into the memory. The Manor appeared out of nowhere, Harry outside. He locked the wards with a complicated spell that Draco had never seen before. The magical wall was pulsating red for a few seconds, before everything seemed back to normal. Apparently, his boyfriend had more tricks up his sleeve than he had thought.
So, he was actually doing it? Without a wand and without saying the words? That was astonishing. Harry bit back a smirk, when Malfoy turned to him as if he was looking for an approval.
And as Draco had thought, it didn’t take much longer until his was looked up and frowned. “Did you hear about what happened in first year? Like what we did?”
“I believe since the first time we saw each other” Malfoy answered and winked at Harry. It was giving him butterflies and even though he hated the way he thought about Draco, he couldn’t deny it any longer.
Harry smirked weakly at that thought and pulled the little door open. Behind the door was a small room, where five people could have fit in – if they were standing and had their arms firmly close to their bodies. That wasn’t what made Harry inhale surprised.
Potter yawned and turned to look on his alarm clock. While doing so, he placed his chin on top of Draco’s head and he couldn’t stop himself from smiling happily. However, at the same time, he hated himself for it. He had just wanted to stay away from Potter, so he could leave once his job had been finished. Now... it seemed impossible.
Well, that thing could wait. The important thing was that Eric and Alamar knew what was happening in Hogwarts and that they were prepared to deal with whatever was coming their way.
Harry frowned and turned to Alamar who was chuckling and shook his head. “Who is she? And why did she call you lovely?”
McGonagall chuckled and nodded, before she turned to Draco. “I’ve talked to the other professors, Malfoy. Professor Babbling would prefer for you to be part of her Studies of Ancient Runes classes and Professor Sinistra believes as well that you would learn more in her classes than learning Astronomy by yourself.”
Harry chocked on the beer, coughed and placed the bottle on the table, to get some air again. Ginny looked at him as if she wanted to say ‘I did warn you’, though he was much more occupied with what she had just actually said.
“No.” Draco shook his head and rubbed his forehead, slightly frustrated. “No, I’m not engaged. And I’ve lost my name.”
As the soft snores of the men in Harry’s Dormitory and Ron’s mumbling in his sleep intensified, Harry had more and more trouble with even falling asleep. He missed the warm body next to his, which was always, always moving and so annoying, until Harry would pull him into a tight hug. The vanilla scent around him was also dearly missed and he really just wanted to hear Draco’s deep breaths. Whenever he had woken up at night and he had just had a few normal flashbacks, he had listened to his husband, breathing, sleeping and sometimes even talking. It had calmed him down instantly. Yet, sometimes, he still woke Draco up just to tell him that he’d had a nightmare.
Reaching the security of his Common Room, Draco entered it, only to find almost everyone standing around with packed things. Christmas hadn't really arrived in their Common Room. It looked just like always, but it felt different: even the air in here was buzzing. Rolling his eyes, Draco zigzagged between all the people and walked through the bookcase up a few steps into the secret garden.
Finally, after a few silent moments, Harry had apparently mastered the courage to ask what had been on his mind. “Why are all the stories about boys with very bad stories?”
“You can’t just kiss a stranger, you haven’t known for even two weeks!” the Saviour said, though he was grinning, when he finally looked up at Draco again. He was quiet for a second, before looked away again. “The weird thing is I want to kiss you again.”
Since Draco had been silent for quite some time, Pansy stepped in front of his view and grinned at Harry. “It would be his pleasure, Harry. The only problem is that all Time Turners have been destroyed. Nothing’s left.”
He was wearing a soft pink t-shirt with a grey overall and a rainbow scarf, which Draco thought was a little on the nose. However, he couldn’t stop looking away and after a few moments, he realised that he actually liked his outfit very much.
“Yes, well… yes” Kevin was visibly confused and pulled his red pullover down. “But that’s not news.” He rolled his eyes while Harry could hear Maria laughing outside. Kevin rolled his eyes. “Vanessa got us a new customer and it’s her girlfriend’s best friend, aka Draco Malfoy.”
“Why does Aurora sleep in my room? I thought she belonged with you?” Harry asked and Alamar could make out a soft purring noise. He was sure that Harry was petting Aurora and that their Krimnee was probably already half asleep.
“Mate, if I ever find a girl, can I get all of you and Neville as dinner guests when I tell my story?” Blaise asked and sighed, while still trying to be at least somewhat funny.
He was slightly afraid that Harry would lose his head and just… freak out, even though he had known the former Gryffindor quite well. It was still a little scary.
In the following silence, Draco wondered whether or not there was someone. Judging from the saddened look on his godfather’s eyes, there must have been someone who either didn’t make it or something else happened.
At dinner, Draco got a parchment delivered from Madam Pomfrey stating she wanted to get Harry into the Infirmary right after the feast to check him once again. There was also a hint of intent behind the writing that she seemed to want to keep Harry there over night. It was the night where he did turn back to his usual age. Alongside every Slytherin, Madam Pomfrey surely wanted to make sure he was doing fine.
These two words made Harry feel so warm and he grabbed his husband’s hand and they left the Common Room. Once they were in the hallway, Harry remembered that he had wanted to talk to Draco about McGonagall’s offer.
Draco had apparated a few miles away from where he suspected Potter was hiding. He had changed his appearance with some effort. Nothing should help Potter realise it was him. First, he just wanted to find him without having to chase him through the whole village.
“So, did you never offer Ian the wine?” Draco asked, though he had no idea why he suddenly wanted to know about the relationship between the critic and the Saviour.
Harry smiled into his chest and placed his arms around his husband’s neck. “You know, we still haven’t talked about what McGonagall told me about our living arrangements when I’d take over as headmaster.”
Pansy ran up to them, a finger in the air and fire in her eyes, while Harry had his expression back under control and was happy with the annoyed eye roll when the Slytherin almost screamed. “You absolute monster!”
The other Gryffindor groaned, clearly not happy that Ron either didn’t read everything or just wasn’t getting it. “They wanted to make the people stop the testing, Ron. Read the second part again,
It was clear to Draco that he was talking to the young Harry who grew up with his relatives, not the one who was laughing at him, accidentally accio’ing his teddy and asking Pansy to create magical snow balls. Proudly presenting Theo his teddy when he had gotten it out of thin air again and asking Blaise to read him a magical goodnigth story. This boy did know nothing about the magical world.
“Well, then just let me get some ice cream from the kitchen and I’ll be gone again and you can continue whatever secret topic you’ve been talking about.”
Harry was still writing in another book, so that Draco could take the leather-bound book with him to the library or to his room and research there. He had also started to use the huge office on the second floor, which must have belonged to the head of the Black family. It was incredibly beautiful, much warmer than the white marble room in the Manor.
The orb illuminated two rooms, one was the room with a hole in its side and the other room seemed to be a museum. There were very old magical artifacts incased in glass and a very old looking wand which seemed about to break apart lay on a table.
Smirking, Malfoy motioned him to sit down on the table where Blaise Zabini was sitting. “Fair point, I’ll teach both of you at the same time, then Blaise can at least help with your idiocy.”
Harry smiled innocently. “Thanks. I didn’t know if I should buy them, they were expensive. But I think sometimes you just need to buy nice things.”
While the students kept looking around, Millicent walked up to them and grinned broadly. “You know what? I think we can clean this up and treat this as another room for our Common Room. We could throw some amazing parties in here!”
“That is a good question, Harry” Neville frowned and looked at the book. “I mean, the only thing you can really do is to just... ask them something. Maybe you can ask them for help in a specific area where they are the experts? Ask for homework help? That would however only work if this person was on a higher level than you. If we’re talking about a younger student, maybe offer them help?”
Well, even if Draco had wanted to help Harry be creative, what he just said had definitely destroyed his creativity. Harry looked as if he had beaten him and he was very depressed. “See, you can write better than me!”
… Harry saying his full name was so much better than he had ever thought. Draco tried to clear his throat, though was unable to do so. It was much too hot in here to get any productive thoughts running.
“Oh my God, Toby. Why would you say that? Why would you bring that up instead of taking that to your grave?!”
Nodding, Harry closed his eyes again. For quite a while when Draco was about to ask him whether he had fallen asleep, standing in the Party Room, he opened his eyes again with a rather huge determination in his eyes. He pointed his wand into the air and called out “Expecto Patronum!”
Sighing, Minerva shook her head. “Well, I am happy that you take Harry out of here, but I did like coming here and talking to people I trust. So I am sad, that you’re leaving. Maybe I can come visit you three in Russia sometime?”
Madam Pomfrey smiled. “It’s very likely, Mr. Malfoy. We’re all humans; everyone develops at a different paste. Are you worried about something?”
Draco couldn’t stop smiling. Potter was giving away so much, he was sure that with every new detail, he could find him easier. However, the discussion between Potter and his best friends seemed to end very abrupt, because Potter just shook his head and disappeared.
Dwarfbart chuckled, as if that was an old question, which Eric believed it was. He had asked himself the same questions, though there were much more pressing matters to discuss before. The goblin started to explain: “The powers have been passed down from generation to generation, adapting to what was needed to survive. The ability will be specifically for whatever creature Harry Potter might turn into. If he isn’t a creature, he will receive no abilities, but since his mother was an elf, he still has whatever the Ljósálfar considered important for their survival.”
He got dressed in a green jumper and jeans and climbed down the stairs, smelling the coffee from the top step. In the big, empty room, Potter was dancing around, a broom in his hand, cleaning the floor, while singing. Terribly.
to do is check his actual stats. You have given him all the nutrition potions I ordered. This surely had changed his history. Maybe they’re no longer needed, maybe we need to adjust them… This would all be written in the other parchment.” She looked at the Injury Parchment, which was getting longer and longer, before she turned back to Draco and smiled apologetically. “And don’t worry, this spell would only tell us what’s going on with him right now.”
Hannah grinned and looked up at him again. “In all honesty, though, Harry” she smiled softly. “What have you been doing? I have tried to find some news about you a few days ago and I could not even find one single publication in the last two years.”
If you’re not happy with reading about this, stay around for the next chapter, where I will not talk about it anymore (that much).
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Are we staking out the movement of the stars? Will they change formation if we don’t keep tabs on them?”
Draco held up his hands and interrupted his ward. “Harry, stop it. If you don’t believe me, you should ask Pansy or Blaise, or Theodore. I’m sure they’ll all say you
Harry placed an arm around his shoulders and pressed a kiss on his cheek. “Love, stop thinking about school for at least an evening.”
Once Harry had gotten his official room, Draco had gone to his now-father and asked whether or not things were okay. Apparently, Harry had finally gotten to hear all the rules there were in Slytherin. For some unforeseen reason, however, the former Gryffindor had joked that it didn’t really matter to him, since he would be gone in about two or three months anyway.
“And then, we need to go to Madam Pomfrey and have her take a good look at you, maybe you don’t need any more nutrition potion” Pansy winked at Harry who suddenly got really excited.
A ping in his phone made Draco frown and he looked at the screen, where Harry had sent a picture of himself sleeping. “You took a picture?!”
Harry chuckled. “Listen, I am dramatic, but not like that! I just decided to take a name which is close to that. Milos, and I decided to keep the ‘King’, but to have it work as my last name.”
Widening his eyes, Harry shook his head. “As Draco Malfoy? Who’s being hunted by the Aurors? You’re playing with fire, my friend.”
“Draco” Harry almost moaned as his husband attacked his neck, kissing every inch hungrily. He closed his eyes, feeling the welcomed butterflies in his stomach again, the warm breath on his neck and he stumbled with closed eyes, almost losing balance. He placed one hand on his husband and clawed his fingers into the bricks on the wall behind him. It took him all the strength he had left to force out a question between his breath. “What… are… you doing?”
“Fine” Harry held up his hands as if to show that he was giving up. “You win. Test whatever you want to, but just know that the potions here are running out in twenty-two… well twenty-one days. If I don’t have anything by then, it might be a little… disgusting.”
“Harry, no” Draco breathed, his hands on his face, while Harry imprisoned him between his arms and the wall. “Anyone could see this!” He sounded so unconvinced as if all he wanted was for people to see them and for Harry to kiss him. Which Harry had nothing against.
“Pansy” Draco chuckled and sat down on the seat next to hers, pulling her into a hug. He smiled at her as he pushed some strains of hair out of her face. “You are already in too deep! Do you want me to go and talk to him? Harry has to go to his therapy session in fifteen minutes; I could go and try to find your potential boyfriend...”
“Draco… You know I didn’t mean it like that!” Pansy sighed as she took back her hand, not really sure what to do with it. “People will always see us as a part of the bad side. In my opinion, we should just enjoy having an unknowing child here, who sees us as what we are not what we were.”
“Hello, Draco, how are you doing?” Pansy opened the door when Draco walked up to their home. She was a little confused, since Draco had only once walked to her home and that was when they had been under construction and Jason was trying to have their fire place connected to the Ministry’s network.
Just then the door opened again to reveal two Slytherins entering: Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini entered. They looked very much at ease with each other, arm in arm, as they slowly made their way into the Common Room. If Harry had to be honest, he had to say, that Pansy’s stomach looked a little bigger than ususal.
Harry sighed and shook his head. “I am so sorry.” He had seemingly gotten his emotions back and looked rather guilty.
“Sure. Why?” Theodore answered. Blaise widened his eyes and shook his head, though Theodore punched him in the arm.
“Hey! Don’t put this on me, Dray!” Harry called out and put his hands on his hips with sparkling eyes, about to say something else, when Neville once again interrupted him.
Draco nodded. Bridger had such a thick Scottish accent, sometimes it was even hard for him to understand it. Well, Draco also wondered why he spent his years in Diagon Alley and it had done absolutely nothing to his accent. However, he thought that it was part of his charm. “Well, I have a friend here who might be interested in one of your special jumpers.”
“Maybe you need to look at it from a different angle, Draco: Harry’s now off age.” Severus then even had the audacity to wink at him.
Satisfied with the finished look, he entered the Manor, and found loud ball music blaring through the house. The nearest room to the entrance hall was open and it had clearly been magically enlarged. There were people dancing, eating and chatting away. White glowing icicles hung from the ceiling and a majestic Christmas tree with all kinds of different decoration stood in the corner far back. It all looked very impressive.
“Oh thank you very much” Harry answered sarcastically and chuckled, while Mason got up and pulled him in a strong hug as well. He looked as happy as Jennifer, even though he had never really liked to show his true feelings – much like the pureblood he was.
That was when Draco leaned in and quietly whispered: “If you’re not careful, you might end up getting detention from Professor McGonagall.”
.” He looked at Harry expectantly and to this, he could only nod. Well, and he laughed as well, thinking of how Malfoy would probably rant about his father.
The rest if the day went actually rather quiet. The potion wasn’t even that hard (for Draco at least), Finnigan almost blew up his potion again and he had apparently had a few flashbacks to the point where Severus had to tell him to leave and go to visit Madam Pomfrey for some Calming Draught and whatever else he would need.
Inside the Common Room again, Draco put Potter down and walked over to his friends, sitting behind the book case. Millicent was very focused, quill between her lips as she searched for something in a book, while Blaise spread almost every Transfiguration’s book he had found in the library (and that was allowed to be taken out of it) on the couch, sitting in the middle of this mess. Pansy sat cross legged on the other couch, reading a Muggle Romance novel, which she had actually gotten from Granger. Harry was following quickly, once he realized that Draco moved along and when he sat down on the couch, his ward climbed up, sitting between Pansy and him.
“Good morning, Mr. Malfoy. Would you like to send a letter?” The young boy asked and looked up to the ceiling in fear where a few owls just fell asleep.
“I don’t know, my darling” he said softly, kissing his temples. He looked down at the love of his life who stared back with a love-struck smile. His silver eyes were so full of love and care.
“Why?” Pansy glared at him. She clearly had wanted to get more information; however, Draco didn’t really want to know more… It was already way too much.
It took Draco a few seconds until he became aware of what Harry had just told him. Harry was alive there was no real way he could have died… right? “What do you mean, Harry?”
“It’s to show people that even though you look fine on the outside, you can still be broken und hurt on the inside, Mrs Williams. I told you this about ten thousand times already.” Potter was apparently successful in getting away from Conner and smirked at the old woman. “But then again, it must be your brain that’s forgetting all the information.”
Harry shook his head and they stayed quiet for a few moments, until he finally seemed able to let go and he sat with his back at the wall. Draco followed his example and looked at him worriedly.
There were only four people in the Common Room this evening. Next to his best friends, Neville sat in the corner, silently reading a book on Healing Potions and the only Slytherin in the room sat furthest away from them; Blaise Zabini was engrossed in another book.
Harry almost told the truth, that Toby was a bald, middle-aged, happily married man with three children, one sixteen year old step-daughter who was having her first serious boyfriend, which made Toby incredibly nervous. He couldn’t say that – obviously.
Harry looked at him in silent awe. That was until he found his voice again. “How do you know so much about stars? I mean, we do have Astronomy, but I never heard about it with so much history.”
Kneeling down, Boy started working through the garden again. Usually, he was much faster, but hearing that he could be alone during the evening made him extremely happy and he didn’t want to work in the area where he could be seen by his aunt or cousin. That had to wait. So for now, Boy was going to work slowly, but carefully.
Zabini beckoned him to sit down on his table. “It’s sometimes funny trying to understand how these two could ever be together. I assume there will be quite a few arguments and fights.”
Truth was, Draco couldn’t eat. He was neither hungry nor did he have any interest in eating anything. Still, he didn’t want to worry his friends, so he grabbed a fork full of bacon and little bit of sausage and eggs. It wasn’t even half of what he usually ate for breakfast, but he wasn’t even sure he could eat this.
Kevin nodded and walked into his own office, while Harry turned back to the dark brown haired wizard at the front desk. He caught Maria glancing at the man in front of her slightly interested. Well, in his fairly elegant dark blue Muggle suit and the nicely kept hair, he did look rather handsome. That was also how Harry had fallen for him.
So when Harry asked you to teach him the Patronus, that’s the first time for a long time where you let your Patronus free. And it showed you that you in fact had a soul bonding with Harry. The book I had Harry give you talks more about the changing of a Patronus and what it entails for the person.
However, Pansy simply shrugged her shoulders and leaned forward to the little table in front of her. It seemed as if she was looking for something. Draco frowned, while Jason walked back in, with a nice white woolen jumper.
Pansy nodded. “I assume you also already know about the parchment? The injury parchment which almost all of Hogwarts knows by now?”
Draco heard the door opening again and a female voice was talking to Harry. The background sounded as if a party was going on.  Draco could even make out the words the woman was saying. “Harry, Thomas is here to talk to you. He’s just filled out a form saying he found the person he was looking for.”
It didn’t seem as if it had, but even if he now had a stag… Harry seemed to be happy about everything. And also, his stag was bigger than Draco’s, so they weren’t even the same.
“Hey, bear, there’s something very important you need to understand” Draco said and sat down at a desk. Harry frowned and sat down next to him, looking at him with wide eyes. “You can’t just go around and do what you want with your magic.”
Her response got Draco to smile and there was even a hint of laughter in the air, though no one had laughed loudly. It was funny to hear Pansy talking about being a mother to a fellow student (who just so happened to be turned back into a baby by accident). However... Draco agreed. He also thought that they were good parents.
“So what does that mean if the Hat places him in Gryffindor?” Theodore asked and raised his eyebrows. This time even more.
everyone who’s wrongfully being called a Death Eater and other stuff. I think I should write my first story on Scott Davis. Have an interview with him...”
Draco moved closer and found Harry with a surprised look on his face. “What”, Draco said amused. “You think you can kiss my hand but not me?” he asked grinningly and pulled the Gryffindor into a kiss. He seemed to have nothing against that.
Daphne laughed silently, her body moving so much, she slid from the couch and sat on the floor laughing. Hermione grinned and Harry winked at her. “No problem, Hannah. It’s all good.”
Laughing, Blaise went towards the dormitories. “I know, mate, I know. And you know… you should head to bed.”
As steps were heard, the animals quickly went into hiding – for the very first time ever since nature had given them their territory back. The leaves burst into dust as soon as the shoe hit them and all it crunched as the two figures walked closer.
Chuckling quietly, Draco left for a second, to grab his satchel and hurried back to his room, not wanting to disturb Millicent and Pansy with whatever they were doing, and Blaise had started to attack as well. He really didn’t want to be in the middle of this…
“Stop over-thinking, Dray!” Harry grinned and “The movie is from 1937. I’m pretty sure that thing was an outrage.”
“Don’t.” Draco closed his eyes, seeing Nagini in front of him. Slytherin through the halls of the Manor. How he wished he could forget these nights, where he was sitting in the middle of his bed, staring at the slightly open door, praying to
Harry nodded. “Yes, but it was really hard to do so while keeping our sanity. On top of that we had so little to eat all the time! Until we figured out how to destroy the Horcruxes, we basically kept them on our bodies, so they wouldn’t get lost. We went mad with them. Ron lashed out at us, I was mad at him, Hermione freaked out in the middle of us. It was so hard. And then he left. It took a toll on all of us.”
The Slytherin looked at him and frowned, before shrugging his shoulders. “Sure, but why aren’t you asking Granger? You know I will make fun of your lack of knowledge. She probably won’t.”
Well, and then there was Draco sitting there, talking to none other than Hermione Granger. Never would he have believed that one day, he would be talking to her civilized and without trying to outdo her – what was he even trying to prove, honestly?! Actually, he had just thought that Harry might have needed a little more space than their secret garden could give him, though apparently that wasn't the case. And while he had sat there, the Gryfindor had walked up from Hogsmeade and simply sat down next to him as if nothing bad had ever happened  between them
His ward nodded weakly. “It is rather obvious now. But most stories have things like that, something their protagonist has to overcome. This story is apparently a forced marriage and her family. I’m sure there are movies with similar… stories.”
He snorted quietly and sighed. Leaning at the doorframe, he watched the scene in front of him, remembering what Draco and he had talked about. He was still a little unsure of how to pretend to get a divorce from the love of his life. He couldn’t just suddenly pretend to hate him! And if he was truly honest with himself, there was also a little fear in himself that maybe something would come to light that would actually made him want to divorce Draco. Even though he knew in his heart that there was nothing they couldn’t fix. They had gone through so many harsh times and always ended up on top and probably even more in love with each other.
“Oh, but I know you’d like to do this again!” his voice was so sweet like it was meant for Harry to walk right into the trap and close around him. “You know, what we’ve talked about before!”
Draco shook his head. He licked his lips and averted eye contact, as if he was ashamed of something. Before Harry could say something, he blurted out: “I’m afraid of… having sex with you, Harry.”
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry motioned towards the door. “Sure. Try to open the door. It should work.”
Harry turned his head lazily to look at her. “Yeah, I can’t remember what happened. I just know that I sat next to Draco and then I woke up here with Madam Pomfrey doing all kinds of spells on me to keep me stable. I think she was worried I’d bite the dust.”
Snorting, Harry nodded and carefully ran one of his fingers over the shirt on the right side. It was rather prominent even if the color was more at the bottom and shouldn’t be seen easily. However, the slightly green shirt let the red color stick out extremely.
A sudden noise made Draco jerk up. Potter was whimpering and he was frowning quite severely. Draco was by his crib in a matter of seconds, carefully lifted him out of it and sat down on the couch again.
Frowning, Harry stared at it, hearing the loud discussions from Ron and Nott in the distance. Something was weird with this thing. Ron had just come from here. If he had found a door that hadn’t any boards up, he would have called them immediately, right?
He moved even closer, effectively pushing Harry into the walls – not that he cared about that. After another kiss, Draco carefully pushed a strain of hair out of his face, tucking it behind his ear. “And what do you think?”
Hermione motioned Ron to go and Neville bid goodbye as well, grabbing Pansy and pulling her out as well. She probably had no problem with it, though Draco knew she still wanted to ask Harry about whether or not he was gay.
Harry chuckled and finally poured the boiling hot water over the herbal tea. He then grabbed three cups and placed them on the table. “Well, it is nice to have you here.”
“Love” Ginny finished his sentence and repeated it again, when Harry frowned at her. “It wasn’t love, Harry. You needed someone, he was there. And when you felt better, you realized that you grew and he didn’t grow with you.” She leaned back and smirked. “Are you sure you can handle what I’m about to tell you?”
He didn’t get far, as Dean seemed to be waiting for him in the Common Room. He jumped up when Harry opened the door and rushed towards him. Padfoot seemed to see this as an attack, as he quickly stepped between them and Harry moved his hand on top of Padfoot’s head, calming him for now.
The young ginger man told his wife to back to bed. When Granger turned around, Draco could see that she actually was really pregnant. That made a lot of sense since she wouldn’t just like that abandon her post at the Ministry.
So why was he so reluctant to open up to someone else? If anything, he should be happy not to talk to Harry again, right?
“These aren’t really the questions I’ve got here.” The therapist looked at her parchment, seemingly deciding to just ask the question and let them have their fun. “How do you see the future?”
Neville, Blaise and Draco stood by the entrance. Before Harry had any time to think about hiding, he heard Padfoot bark and he ran towards him.
McGonagall had called him either way, so he could also make a huge scene in front of a few people, before heading to her office. In fact, the way all of them looked mortified and shocked had been a huge bonus. By the beginning of the next activities, Harry was sure that each and every one of his former classmates would know what happened.
Draco awoke from someone shaking his shoulders and he opened his eyes to find Harry sitting on the floor, back at his bed, looking rather disheveled. Rubbing his eyes, Draco turned to his side and looked at his ward. It was another Sunday, making him… another year older. Damn, sixteen.
As they floo’d over, one by one, Draco saw Lovegood floo over with little Potter and was left behind. For a second, he thought about going back to the Slytherin Common Room, but Weaslette grabbed his arm and pulled him into the fire with her. She had clearly read his mind.
His good days were getting so rare that Draco was suddenly surprised an entry with a beautiful handwriting.
He cleared his throat and Harry caught his eyes flicker over Hermione and for a quick moment, he thought that Blaise was going to tell everyone what she did. “Draco came to me, complaining about something Harry did, so I wanted to confront him. I got really angry and I think that made him change his mind and he told me about the game two days ago, or maybe yesterday, I don’t remember.”
As his group headed out of the Great Hall, Harry stayed in the back. He watched Draco discuss the first few clues – which apparently Minerva had once mentioned, while he had been too busy concentrating on anything else than his husband – with Neville and Pansy. He looked very much interested in the game, most likely a perfect coping mechanism so he didn’t have to think about the fact that their future had changed.
Draco had nodded tiredly. Harry just stood there watching these grey eyes that seemed to be looking for some safety and a way to get away from all the hungry staring eyes. Reacting out of instinct, he grabbed the Slytherin by the wrist and pulled him up the stairs.
Draco wordlessly shook his head. He was glad that he had gotten the Gryffindor to laugh. Harry wasn’t laughing enough, he thought. When he examined him, he thought that the ill man seemed to have a good day, so he was maybe even able to walk down a few stairs.
When he made it to the pathway to the lake, he turned around to see the cat changing back into Minerva. She saw him looking and rolled her eyes, as if she wanted to tell him that she didn’t think she was too intense for a cat. Harry smirked and walked to the lake with Padfoot, who seemed overly eager to get into the water.
I’m slurring my speech, even though I can think well. My writing is getting less and less controlled. I hope I can finish this journal before I’m just a shell of myself. I’m so weak, I get bruises only from people touching me.
As Pansy realized that Draco was awake, she cancelled the spell and grinned at him. “Good morning, Draco. Do you want to know how long you’ve slept?”
“Good plan, love” Draco commented, ran a hand through his hair and ruffled Padfoot’s fur. “You are very patient with us, Paddy! You’re being such a good dog!”
“Well, I’m not really talking about Draco. I’m talking about ‘Lucius’.” Severus chuckled and shrugged his shoulders.
“Harry! How wonderful of you to come by so early! I haven’t seen you in such a long time!” she hurried towards him and quickly greeted him with a hug.
Draco glared at Pansy, while Harry snorted. “Don’t worry, Draco. I know you’re always here if I need or want to talk to you. Right?” he asked and leaned at the back of the chair smiling.
“What’s going on here?!” A voice interrupted them and Draco, jumped and turned around to see Blaise standing there with six cups of hot chocolate on a plate, Millicent having her face in her hands and Pansy about to freak out. Probably over how Blaise had destroyed their moment.
Kingsley held up his hands to quiet them all again. “Thank you, Ronald. Mr. Nott, where have you been on Friday night?”
In fact, the post man tried to get a free beer or vodka, just something with alcohol. Potter denied and closed the door practically in front of his nose. Rolling his eyes, Potter sat down on the same table Draco was sitting. He looked at his mail and noticed another letter that had been opened. Draco smirked.
Harry snuggled into Draco’s side and he placed an arm around the Gryffindor. “Does that mean that you can die too? When it’s your time?”
Neville laughed. “Tell on you? Never! I was well aware that you two had something going on, so I usually told the others not to think too much about it.”
“Now, now, Paddy” Draco sad softly and scratched him behind his ear. “I’ll put him back together, like I always do, yeah?”
Harry smiled weakly as he let the meat and sauce float over to the table. “Then you would have been stunned by my magic use before I got sick. I could do all kinds of things.”
“Follow me, then” Alamar presented her with a smile and turned around. He once again had a bad feeling that whatever this Animagus was going to tell him, he was not going to like. And well, Eric might not like anything he had seen tonight. He still needed to know.
“Did anything happen to Harry?” Longbottom looked slightly shocked. Well, until Draco shook his head.
Finally, Harry took off the towel and grinned at Draco whose hair looked entirely normal if you didn’t look too close. He leaned in for a soft kiss and his husband pulled him onto his lap. Harry was just about to say ‘perfect’, when someone spoke up.
As he opened the door towards the Room of Requirement, he heard Potter laugh and when Draco looked inside, the Gryffindor was running around with something in his arms that Weaslette was trying to get back, though she clearly was pretending not to be able to get it.
Let alone that there seemed to be some chores that a three year old boy should definitely not be doing. Do the dusting? And weed the garden? He wasn’t even four years old!
“Not really” Harry shrugged his shoulders, moving his body to sit in his husband’s lap and he leaned against his strong chest. “I just want to cuddle right now.”
Kira sighed, but her eyes sparkled, as she started talk. “I did. Mother was ruthless. She’s really not in the mood to fight for a few more hundred years. This had been our land first. What did these idiots think they could just take it over?!” She pulled her shirt away from her neck and showed a deep red scar running from her neck down to her shoulder, where it disappeared under the clothes. “Got this nasty scar from a stupidly used magical trick by the wizards. It’ll be gone in a few decades, but I cannot believe I didn’t see it coming!”
“I told you about that new hire at the Pizzeria?” Draco asked and smiled weakly. “He looked like my dream guy from when I was a teenager, so when I saw him, for a second I thought about hooking up with him.”
Draco’s father got white as a ghost and narrowed his eyes, while Harry kept his emotionless mask up, as if he were a pure pureblood. “So, please don’t try to be a part of my relationship with Draco. I promise to tell you as soon as – and if – we decide to get married. Thank you.”
“Pounds” Harry corrected and Draco saw him trying to hold back a grin, though he only barely managed. “Go on.” He walked closer and sat down between Pansy and Draco, when the latter put his arm around his boyfriend and smiled at him.
This made the Slytherin laugh, when the door was opened again and Draco Malfoy walked in with his friend Pansy Parkinson in tow.
Getting up himself, Harry cleared his throat. “Need I remind you, that you never even wanted to have a pizzeria? Why did you want that?!”
Looking at his ward now as well, Draco found him chewing on his lower lip, watching the Hat which was placed on the chair a little to the side of the Headmistress. He didn’t seem scared; in fact he seemed to be deep in thought. Whatever was going through his head apparently wasn’t bad at all.
Harry grinned down on him and lay back as well, staring up at the cold castle ceiling. They were quiet for a while until Harry turned his head, almost examining him closely. “I know it’s none of my business, but I’m curious: Why didn’t you accept your mother’s chosen wife?”
tell anybody about Draco’s and his marriage and fake divorce. The latter was only the mistake their class mates had started and it was absolutely too much fun to stop.
Even though he didn’t really want to, Draco started to laugh and he shook his head. “Love, I went to the toilet, would you rather have me pee in bed?”
I've realised that I started this story exactly one year ago, so as a matter of celebration, I'll post 2 chapters today :)
The sweet silence of pages being turned, the occasional sigh of their shared future quiz in Potions and people moving on furniture to find a comfortable sitting place was giving Harry a little time to think. All along, Harry stared at the book in his hands, lost in thought. Clues for forgotten Potions. What kind of a book was that supposed to be?!
Not that it mattered to Harry. Being around Eric and Alamar was always a good time. “So, do I now live with you?” Harry asked and tilted his head.
So, he continued: “I like you, Harry Potter. I like you a lot actually. And by that I mean all of you: your unbelievable kindness, your softness, your…” He frowned, before he chuckled quietly. “I think I might be in love with you.”
Harry looked at her and after another silent ten seconds, he nodded. “Of course. It surely means a lot to get the Wonder Boy telling the Ministry to let you go.”
“Hey!” Harry called out and jumped up after Draco, placing an arm around his shoulders. “Pansy, there is some revenge coming your way when you’re with Neville now!”
Suddenly, a loud bang behind Harry made him jump and he raced to a corner, pushing his back into it, so he could have a clear view of what was going on. Malfoy almost followed his lead, though he had his wand out and pointed it at the door, one hand laying on the piano as if he was stabilizing himself.
Chuckling to himself, Harry walked to the door and turned around, one last time. He saw Draco pointing something out on the map and quickly looking up and shooting him a smile. Harry grinned and closed the door behind him. Oh what he would give right now to end this day in Draco’s arms, enjoying whatever wine his husband had chosen for the night, listening to some jazz. That would have been the perfect ending to such a day.
Even though it was very well past midnight, Draco entered the dark entrance room of the SoF. There was always someone around – especially at night, since a lot of wizards seemed to think that night was the best time of day to talk with shady people. On the wall, there were hundreds of people sticking their heads out of the fire and talking. You couldn’t hear anything, but it was still a little creepy.
Daphne on the other hand raised her eyebrows, knowing full well that this was somewhat how they behaved at home. However, she seemed to be unsure since Harry reacted so annoyed, which he never really did when they were alone.
The delicate silence between them was broken when Draco heard more footsteps and whispers along with very loud ‘sh’s and laughter. From where they were hiding, he caught Weasley and Granger walking by, not even looking at them, too deep in their own discussions about something. Draco followed their figures until they had entered the Common Room. Turning back to Potter, he saw him playing with the curtain not looking up.
Since Theo seemed to be the expert in this whole thing, all eyes turned to him and he narrowed his eyes in thought. It was quiet for quite some time and only after a few tense moments did he speak up.
“Harry” Weaslette sighed. “You do see how he wanted to get exactly that reaction out of you, right? And you taking out your wand and attacking him actually worked in his favor. Stupid people just exist.”
The first thing Draco saw when he entered his room was a floating Pensieve in the middle and Harry sitting on the floor with a book, quietly reading. Draco smirked and closed the door with a thud, which made his boyfriend looking up.
“Don’t do anything we wouldn’t do!” Harry called over his shoulders, when he was pulled away by Draco.
That seemed to surprise Draco and he nodded quickly. “Yes, every day he shows me again and again that he accepts me with all my faults and my history. He makes me feel loved and safe.” This time, his smile was warmer and there was so much love in these grey soul mirrors.
Draco sat in the dark Common Room. It was close to two a.m., the fire in the fire place was almost out and the wind had finally stopped shaking the windows towards their secret garden. The only sounds one could hear were the waves of the lake reaching the walls of the castle and once in a while a small crack from the wood in the dying embers.
The Gryffindor chuckled. “Well, despite the fact that we have been continuously taught by the worst possible teachers... we did survive a war, so there’s that.”
While Millicent walked closer with the intent to open it, Draco got hold of his wand. “Get your wands ready, there might be some weird monster behind there as well.” He grabbed Harry and pulled him behind him. Just in case.
Draco had just wanted to comment on how beautiful it was when Harry sat up and opened his own satchel, taking out a parchment. He seemed to look for something else and finally took out a thin book, which he did not show the title just yet. Slightly intrigued by the secrecy, Draco sat up properly as well and frowned at his boyfriend.
“Thank you, Magical Guardian!” Harry grinned, before heading back to his own room and left Draco by his own.
Draco threw his arms into the air and shook his head. “What are you doing, Pans?! Why are you so… nurturing to him? He hates us!”
Harry couldn’t really believe that, even though he wanted to. He also hoped that Draco didn’t hear their discussion right now, wherever he might have been. “But if I had just stayed quiet, nodded and continued with my day as usual, he would have been free!”
Ginny is holding another party. Are we ever going to meet your boyfriend? Please bring him along! Anyways, Neville said he saw you in a bakery with Malfoy!? And you too looked close to each other, I’m just wondering what’s going on there. Please tell me!
Draco almost spit out the water, when he quickly swallowed it started to laugh. He looked up at Harry and shook his head. “As sad as it is, Harry, you never were my hero. Well, one time in the Room of Requirement, but that was all. I don’t need a hero in my life.”
“Look, bear” Draco pointed at James Potter. “This is your dad and this” he moved to the woman, “this is your mum.”
In all honesty, Harry wasn’t worried. He had dabbled with death long enough to know that maybe it was just a relief to finally die. He was, however, slightly worried that Draco might take it too personally if his testing wouldn’t work. Hopefully, whatever Draco was testing was also giving good answers.
“Well” Molly then said and smiled at him warmly. “I do believe this answers all the questions we had lined up for the whole evening.” She clapped her hands and shooed them all into the living room, where the candles were burning at the tree. “Let’s celebrate with a few presents, shall we?”
Carefully, Draco let the piece of paper slip out and opened it. It was dated only a few days prior to today.
Harry was apparently too tired to fight him since he followed without complaining and even let himself be pushed into a chair. Draco grabbed a wine bottle and two glasses and poured them both a glass. Sliding it over the table, he marveled at the sight in front of him. Harry gingerly grabbed the wine glass, did his best impression of what a wine lover should do and took a sip, before putting it down, trying his hardest not to look disgusted. It was always the same and Draco loved it. Harry did so too, he was sure, why else would he do the same thing over and over again?
McGonagall seemed surprised, but caught herself rather quickly. “Yes, Malfoy, I know the High Executor. She’ll be happy to have the Potters’ will and she’s proven to be the best. If you could bring me the will, I’ll make sure to send it to her.”
“So, you’re the critic they’d send? You must feel very lucky.” Potter’s voice was dripping with sarcasm, and Draco frowned, turning back at them.
Kingsley looked at Draco and raised his eyebrows. It took everything Draco had to not freak out and tell him what an idiot he was for doing this investigation. “Well, I am his Magical Guardian and I have a list of everything that his relatives did to him. They broke a lot of his bones and he had to go without food for quite a few days.”
Draco shook his head lovingly. “You need every second of peaceful sleep, love. I just couldn’t wake you. Besides, I enjoyed having a few quiet hours for myself to read.”
Harry shuddered and looked at the ground, where he looked at his own black boots, almost totally covered in snow. He would have only moved his head slightly to kiss the Slytherin. His mind was already showing him so many pictures that he wasn’t sure he even wanted to see. He felt movement in front of him and as he turned to look back at Malfoy, he had snow in his hands.
As the Quidditch game crept closer and closer, Harry found Neville, Hermione, Ron and Theodore walking towards him and sitting down on the grass as well. Harry smiled at them innocently, pretending he didn’t know what was going on, though he found it hard to hide his emotions from Neville. This man had an incredibly trained eye, even more than Ron and Harry was slightly afraid that Draco’s and his plan would be spoiled due to that.
Draco grinned and frowned. “It has to be a name without any prejudice or feeling related to it. But I want a longer one that I can shorten, just because I can” he grinned.
Harry smirked and kissed his husband. He performed a quick tempus spell and sighed. It was nearly four o’clock. He needed to go to Fleur’s and get her ferret. And first, he desperately needed a shower. So, he moved away from Draco, grabbed his clothes and put them on.
Draco still didn’t know if that was supposed to be an insult or not, since Pansy and Jason laughed at that when they came by to say hello to their new guest.
The werewolf stopped and looked at him, rather suspiciously. That was until Potter had a little more courage and turned to the new person in the room as well. Lupin frowned, before seemingly recognizing the small man.
Harry sighed with relief and smirked. “We’re not. But I need to go to Ginny’s anyway and get Padfoot. She told me he’s acting weird. So, I’ll come by with him?”
Finally, Harry was sure that he had gotten it everywhere – there was even a red streak on the towel, as the color seemed to be visible on clothing faster than on hair. He looked down at his hands and was just about to spell it clean, when Draco held him back.
Smirking, Harry leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest. “Hermione.” He echoed her inflexion, which seemed to trip her up, as she opened her mouth, speechless a few times, before she shook her head.
And just like he had done at Christmas with the Weasley’s, Draco wanted to add more memories so that his bad childhood was nothing more than a shadow at the back of his mind.
Ron laughed and rolled his eyes. He turned to Harry and Malfoy. “You guys try to figure out what’s going on with this” he motioned to the wall. “And we’ll try to find a way out.”
He was no longer a nobody! He was a Snape! Draco widened his eyes and glanced over at Severus who looked at the parchment with wide eyes and a soft smile on his lips.
Harry frowned at it and looked at his husband slightly confused. “And? You make a lot of potions, Draco. Why is this one special?”
Minerva seemed to be genuinely too agitated, as she apparently didn’t hear him. “We need to tell the people! Together we could go and look for him. A child all alone! He could be dead right now... And maybe with The Prophet we could...”
In there, he spotted his husband fairly quickly. Alamar sat on a couch, facing the infirmary and rubbed the back of the werewolf who was still there. Eric stopped and smiled softly. Of course Alamar was there to help out.
“You keep looking at him, Potter. We all know you want to ask him out. The problem is; he will never accept you.”
Smiling, the Malfoy matriarch shook her head. “Oh dragon, you know he doesn’t like it in here. Don’t you want to show a little respect and go outside to talk to him?”
Blaise looked at his hand and turned around to face Draco. “Hey, Dray, can you please get your ward under control again? Something weird is going on today…”
Draco raised one eyebrow. Help? Potter didn’t have any owls. So whatever owl he’ll order to help this stupid Weasel owl could be the key to him finding the wizard in hiding. Who knew it was that easy finding Potter?!
His husband grinned broadly as he finally walked towards him, leaning into a kiss. Harry pulled him closer. This was where he belonged. He really couldn’t think he would have been happy with anybody else. Draco was all he needed – his strong, masculine smell, his loving eyes, the smirk on his lips. Everything seemed to just belong to him, because Draco was his.
Pansy nodded. “Maybe he’s playing with Dag. I’ll check the owlery!” She followed him quickly, while Millicent walked after them as well.
Well before Harry could say anything, the door to the Common Room opened and blond hair could be seen. Harry widened his eyes, when Luna entered the room. She stopped and smiled at them. “Sorry, the Nargles led me here. Wrong Common Room. Enjoy your evening.”
“Well done, Harry! I cannot believe that I fought the person I trained in Hogwarts!” Oliver congratulated him and they shook hands. “You winning certainly is a win in my book.”
Looking to the table, Harry saw that this only left a romance novel, a camera and a water purifier. Draco sighed and brushed his hand through Harry’s hair. “I guess the camera would be it then?” he mused.
“I’m not writing you a letter, Gin, just because you refuse to use a mobile phone. I even got Draco to use it! Why won’t you?!”
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know what it is, Ron. He just annoys me.” He saw Neville chuckle next to him and smirked into the Auror’s direction, unsure whether or not he already knew that Draco and he had been together.
“Granger, let him pass!” Severus raised his eyebrows, clearly catching onto the panic in Draco’s eyes, and added then: “Twenty points from Gryffindor for preventing my student from accomplishing his task.”
Well, if this letter finds you, then my hopes of being safe weren’t correct. If this letter finds you, both I and my husband will not have made it out alive. And if this letter finds you, then you have been chosen as Harry’s Magical Guardian.
Stepping aside from the door, Harry pointed at the opposite side of the living room on floor one. Since it was an open floor, they basically stood on a balcony, looking down into the living room. There were three doors and another stair leading up to the second level. “And if you’re wondering about the bathroom, there are two. One is next to kitchen and one is up here” he pointed to the other side of the stairs towards the patio and there was indeed another door.
Just like the cameras, Harry made the recorders break, though stopped before destroying the spell. He checked the area for a last time and found the only thing remaining being the already discovered listening spell.
Draco chuckled. “Guess who’s the reason of that.” He smirked as Pansy shrugged her shoulders pretending not to realize that she was the person waking him up.
Ron laughed out loud and clapped the newcomer on his shoulders. “I like you! Don’t take Harry’s shit too seriously, always being sceptical. That’s my kind of guy.”
“It’s just too much, ‘Mione! How am I supposed to remember that in 1653, a wizard decided to ban whatever potion because of what his wife told him?!” Ron complained and rolled his eyes.
“What are you trying to do here?” Malfoy asked and pointed at the boarded up window. Harry frowned. A second ago, he could have sworn that there was a gap between the boards so he could see inside.
Unsurprisingly, everything his friends had looked into had turned out to be a dead end. Gringotts had refused to give him any of his former inheritance, since Narcissa had taken his name in front of two witnesses. And well, they claimed that she was capable of thinking clearly – for which they probably received money. Since the last witch or wizard who had lost their name had happened over three centuries ago, none of Blaise’s contacts could help even a little. And well, while Pansy and Theodore had used all their free time – Theodore even some of his study time – to find a way in giving Draco his name back (that wouldn’t require marriage) they had found nothing.
Magic rushed through the air and suddenly, the green glue stopped and they seemed to be back to their normal self. Pansy chuckled, along with Theodore.
Harry rolled his eyes and chuckled. “Okay, since we’re already nitpicking everything, it’s no longer morning and I came to abduct you to the kitchen. How does that sound?”
And well, Pansy had two days ago, gotten a letter from the Ministry itself, stating how they wanted to reform the place and that with her help and a Muggleborn witch, they should figure out how to accomplish a functioning Ministry for all wizards and witches. Nobody had questioned who the Muggleborn witch was… Hermione had come to visit them about two hours later, telling them that she had in fact asked them to get Pansy for the job.
Before Draco could even think of an answer, Blaise was already talking: “Of course! But it has to come from both sides, Harry. A one sided friendship just isn’t good.”
Draco took a long look at his ward and decided to tell him. At least something. Maybe it was better that he knew of something. Maybe then he would be able to think it over again. “You saw someone being killed in front of your eyes, Harry. A friend. And I don’t know what horrors you must have gone through when you were running from the... Voldemort. What if it’s too much? The human brain is really fragile, I’ve heard. I don’t want you to get hurt.”
“I want to do what you do!” Harry grinned and climbed over Millicent who was trying to play as fast as possible, without having to stress, so that her cards wouldn’t explode.
That made Neville look slightly concerned. “Is there something you want to tell me?” he asked and grinned shortly after.
He stood there with crossed arms, looking at the leg Paco held towards him. There was a letter attached, which he finally freed from the owl. Paco looked at him as if he was expecting something in return. “I’ll use the school owls should I decide to answer the letter” Draco explained and shooed the owl outside again. He stuffed the piece of parchment into his pocket.
“Agreed” Eric nodded and smiled at Alamar who carefully picked up Harry along with Aurora who only sleepily opener her eyes for a few seconds. And with that, they walked out of the office and into the hospital.
Draco had waited until the next day to send the letter. If Remus’ son was able to sleep through the night and he would wake the man up with an owl, that wouldn’t be very considered of him. So, right after breakfast, he had grabbed baby Potter and they made their way up to the owlery, where Draco had sent the letter.
“Yes, something about reverse psychology and all that. Is it working?” Jason grinned, while Harry shrugged his shoulders.
“That’s the spirit!” Blaise smirked and got up, quite clearly going to the kitchen to get hot chocolate.
He grabbed the hot chocolate left over from Alamar and took a sip. “I’m a fairy, you know. Actually, I’m a Haltija, but we’re just a sub-species of fairies.”
When he stayed quiet, Draco was almost about to ask what it was about Sirius, even though he remembered the newspapers where it stated that he had died. However, Harry beat him to it and continued talking.
Remus chuckled, quite obviously at how much… affection Harry seemed to portray in this small sentence. Draco simply rolled his eyes, but didn’t say anything.
“He did” she answered. “However, since Sirius Orion Black passed away, all his possessions have been given to Harry James Potter. Once he reaches adulthood, he will receive a letter with all his possessions and vaults.” The last part she said towards Draco.
Rolling his eyes, Draco huffed. Harry’s smirk betrayed his otherwise rather innocent expression. He knew exactly that Draco didn’t like pet names. And it was even rhyming which was even worse.
Jennifer smiled at him in a real love struck kind of way, before she turned to him. “Actually, I was wondering whether or not you’d do a wedding as well. I know you did one for Vanessa and she said it was perfect, so maybe…”
“I was in your office, today. Why weren’t you there?” Draco asked and accepted the tea while Harry sat down as well.
Bickering with the oh so holy hero of the Wizarding world had always made his days just a little brighter. It seemed as if Potter really was important to him. This realization came so quickly that Draco widened his eyes a little and stared at the red spot on the floor created by the moon through the colored window.
“Malfoy” McGonagall said as she looked over her glassed at him. “And Potter. Welcome, take a seat.” She pointed at the chairs in the corner next to a small table.
“Yes, I know.” Draco rolled his eyes. “You’d rather have me marry a pureblood witch, so I can have a few little Malfoy heirs and our name would continue. But I think we should stop this line of fuck ups. I choose not to follow your order and live my life like I want it. And my choice is Harry Potter. So you can either deal with that it get the hell out of my life. I don’t need someone who doesn’t accept me the way I am.”
“Oh this is just perfect!” He narrowed his eyes and seemed actually really frustrated. “We just spent all day
“Maybe he also remembers you, because I’ve shown him a few pictures about his parents. There were pictures of you guys in there” Draco explained, walking down the stairs and waiting after two steps, looking back at Potter who carefully held onto the banister, before he took one step at the time.
“Well, then I hope you believe an old hag like me: one of the Healers, Healer Nox, at St. Mungo’s has tried to contact you for five years and he’s not giving up even though his letters never reach you, because he wants you to join his high-profile healer team” Madam Pomfrey said, incredibly proud of what Draco had apparently achieved.
While Eric mixed the ingredients for pancakes, he smirked at his husband. “So then, come outside and play with us in the snow, because you love both of us.”
He once again turned to everyone else. “You would be okay with me working here with you?” He wanted to ask what they were studying, when he saw a lot of different books lying around the table with all kinds of different topics. It just seemed as if they all were studying whatever they needed or wanted.
“With Fred and George as your brothers, I don’t think that’s a good idea. I’d rather have Hermione as Head of House. At least then I know that the people actually learn something and aren’t just given free prank material.”
Draco had still wide eyes, when Pansy rolled hers and grabbed his arm, dragging him with her. Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw his father walk out of the office and looking after them with a slight grin on his face.
Little Harry lay in a mattress, barely fitting in the cupboard and not suiting his size at all, rolled into a ball and eyes closed hard. On the wall behind him stood with child’s scribbling ‘Boy’s room’, though ‘boy’ was crossed out and he had written ‘Harry’ on top of it.
He could have brought Harry when he was still awake, but chose not to, since Madam Pomfrey needed to do a lot more spells and his ward was never calm (well, almost never) and this was just easier.
“So, the Patronus? It’s quite a skill to have, bear.” He smirked when he saw Harry rolling his eyes.
It was glorious. Watching Potter and his gang trying to move on and somehow accomplish something in their normal daily lives as Hogwarts students after they had somehow successfully beaten the Dark Lord and his army was glorious. Draco had for the fifth time only in this hour shared an amused glance with Pansy and Blaise when Potter had flinched because of even the smallest noise.
Draco smiled at him lovingly. “To be honest, I’m already thinking about going back to tell them that I quit and coming back here.” And once again, this answer wasn’t Benjamin, but Draco. However, he had stopped caring about their personalities overlapping.
The two Slytherins made their way up the stairs while Daphne and Draco helped them – mostly Pansy with everything she needed. And that only left the Gryffindors, Hannah and Susan at the table full of food.
With that Hermione looked up and nodded, silently telling Harry to ask what he wanted to know. Harry caught Ron stopping to really read his book and listening as well. It only bothered him slightly.
Remus frowned. “You could be right… But I need Teddy to be safe. And sleeping. I’d rather not have him witness the chaos that comes with Boggarts.”
Harry nodded and grinned. She seemed to remember their discussion a few nights ago and also eager to go there soon. It would be funny if she’d ever find Raphaél working there… Harry cleared his throat, telling himself he really needed to tell all their former classmates who Dracos supposed fling was, just in case they would go to his book store.
Harry smiled weakly. “I don’t have much else left. Growing up sucks. Ginny and Luna travelled to Australia, where they’re currently living. Hermione doesn’t want to see me after her messy break-up with Ron, the Weasley’s in general are nice, but a little too protective over me and apparently Ron turns into a jerk to please his new boyfriend. So… forgiveness is all I have left.” He stared back at his shoes. That was the first time he had ever said all of these things aloud. Did he really think that he had nothing left?
Draco widened his eyes, punched her in the face and tried to get away from her. “No! I love Harry, I don’t want to…”
. “Malfoy! Unless you don’t want anything here? I’m sure the house elves would be happy to put together a platter of whatever high end food you’re used to.”
Kingsley chuckled and shook his head. “No worries, Hermione; Minerva knows we’re coming. We’re just checking the students here.”
“Oh, big words, bear!” Draco was impressed, when Millicent chuckled. Raising a questioning eyebrow at her, she explained quickly.
With that, he bowed shortly, held out his hand to Draco and after he accepted, they walked out of Malfoy Manor. The further they got away from the house, the more Draco started grinning and after a few hundred feet, he started to laugh loudly and stopped.
She chuckled. “Sure, no one ever comes here because they want to. Most people just get lost and find us. And the next thing you know, they’ll stay.”
Sighing softly, Draco remembered how he had talked bad about everyone who liked to stay beside the Golden Boy. He was a monster, if he thought back. Knowing all of what had happened in Harry’s life, Draco was unsure of how he was still alive.
“It is absolutely stunning.” Daphne nodded and turned to Hermione. She sat back up onto the couch and grinned. “I’ll show you where it is after our reunion.”
Theodore nodded, apparently willing to go this route. “I don’t like noise. In the library, there’s just too many people coming and going. We have a hide-out spot in the Slytherin Common Room where I can sit and study without being really caught up by who leaves and who comes. But I wasn’t completely alone. Millicent was there as well.”
Draco caught Potter looking at it with wide eyes, before he waved at the animal and grinned. “Hullo.”
Making a tiny, almost desperate sound, Harry pulled him closer and buried his face in the crook of his neck, inhaling the safest scent he knew. This was what he needed right now. Being in the arms of his loving husband, who knew him better than anybody else on this planet.
Harry looked at Oliver for quite some time, before he turned to Draco. In a begging voice, he started to talk: “Please, Dray, my I have him?”
“Good afternoon!” Harry tried to sound happy, strong. His voice came out as if he hadn’t used it in at least one hundred years. Great. “I’m trying to talk to one of your prisoners.”
Potter nodded and rolled his eyes. “Why don’t you go, sit over by the couch? I’ll be with you in a second, Lucas.”
Draco got his attention back, when he pressed his body onto Harry’s leg. Looking up, he found the room empty and only the old guard standing in front of him. Harry got up with some difficulties.
Jumping from surprise, Draco faced to where the voice had come from. Harry stood there, frowning slightly at him. He was still wearing his pyjamas and his favourite teddy was in his arms.
Staring into the almost dark fire, Draco pulled his knees up and narrowed his eyes. He couldn’t go into his room. He just couldn’t.
“Thank you, love” Draco smiled at him, kissing his forehead. “I don’t know what I would do without you.”
Harry stared at her for at least five seconds, trying to figure out if this was actually reality or just a fever dream. He laughed shortly, more out of discomfort than anything else and shook his head.
Harry chuckled, laying back next to Draco and kissed him softly. “I love you too, Draco. I love you so much, I sometimes don’t know what to do with myself.” His eyes were so soft and glowing.
Rolling his eyes, Draco was just about to pack up his things, when Harry sat down next to him. “You’re usually studying in the Common Room” he stated as a greeting.
“I’m okay” Harry continued, pressing another kiss on his husband’s temple. He still had his shirt in his hand, but Harry wasn’t concerned about that. He just wanted the love of his life to get better. “I’m okay” he repeated and smiled softly. “And you’re here in my arms. Also, perfectly okay and safe.”
Draco sat down next to her, grabbing his Astronomy essay and a book about Jupiter, when he turned back to his best friend since childhood. “So, it’s official? You and Neville?”
Neville huffed, before he grinned. “Okay, why then did you decide to do something like that if you can’t help yourself?”
That second, Severus came in and had so many bags in his arms that it looked as if he had been demoted to carrier owl. The children took one look at him and raced up to the second living room, laughing violently.
As Draco entered the Common Room, he stopped immediately. All eyes were on him and there were far too many people awake for something normal to have happened. His mind travelled to some dark places to when it meant that if a lot of Slytherins were awake that the Dark Lord had done something.
Draco growled, pulled Harry suddenly towards him and effectively silenced him with a kiss. “Shut up, you complete and utter idiot.”
She said all of that so nonchalantly, before she left both Draco and Harry speechless by the door, that it seemed as if this whole interaction was a dream. Harry was the first to start reacting and he snorted, before bursting out laughing.
“Oh” Harry said, thinking deeply for a few seconds, and grinned then. “Makes sense. I thought I could talk to you about Dumbledore dying, but I think you might be having other things on your mind. So, I’ll go and try to scare Theo.”
“I’d rather not.” Harry smiled, even though he could see how Neville was a little hurt that he apparently didn’t trust him with that information. “You know, I don’t want to make his life more difficult than it already is.”
This made her smile. “Let’s look at a few other questions and come back to that one later.” She turned the parchment and seemed to scan the questions there, until she seemed to have found one she liked. “Have either of you ever considered an affair or a one-night-stand with a different person?”
Draco sighed in relief and seemingly relaxed. “Thank you” he whispered, as he brushed an annoyed tear out of his eye. “You just know me too well, love.”
Before Draco had the time to tell Oliver that he really was going to pay for his owl, Harry pulled him with away and they joined their friends again for a lazy study session.
“Well done, bear!” Draco congratulated, when he leaned towards his ward, who beamed through his wet curls.
“In a huge castle? Surrounded by interested children? There is no privacy! But tell me! He didn’t say who you’ve met. I won’t say a word, you know me!” Hermione begged and Harry chuckled. He couldn’t say no. Not when Hermione seemed to be genuinely interested.
As the mediwitch nodded and went to her desk to write a letter to Severus, Harry turned to Draco and frowned. “Hey, Draco, what is love?”
“Draco, stop pressuring yourself into this... role you’ve been playing for the past seven years” Ginny said while rolling her eyes. “The war’s over, Hogwarts wants to be open for everyone and every house. So, we absolutely do not care that you’re in Slytherin
“No, you may not!” he glared at the former Auror, who pretended to be seriously insulted, though Harry could see how much fun he was having. “This is between me and him!” he pointed at Draco.
Nodding, Harry followed the elegant hand writing. Even though the black ink was greyer than the original color and sometimes even looked half gone, it was still rather easy to read it. Well, except for the different language. And even the writing was much more formal than Harry had ever known; the love seemed to ooze out of this piece of parchment. Love and desperation were almost equal in there.
Harry rolled his eyes and looked at his husband, who grinned at all that chaos. “I think we did a good job, my darling. Wouldn’t you say so?”
Hermione leaned over Harry and Draco stepped back a few steps so Harry’s best friend could be closer to him. Was it just him or… had there been something of sadness in Harry’s eyes when he stepped away?
Bridger wrote down everything and turned back to Draco. “I’ve got somethin' ready 'at Ah simply need tae change slightly. It won’t tak' lang. Bide haur.”
Harry beckoned them into the apartment and walked straight towards a door on the opposite side of the entrance door. “Here’s the kitchen” he said as they entered. It reminded Draco a little of Remus’ kitchen, since it was just big. And the huge windows as well as another door to the patio gave quite a lot of natural light.
Minerva shrugged her shoulders. “Maybe magic thought you could do it better with four and the other group needs six people to do the same tasks?”
Ron cleared his throat and turned to him. “Can we go back to the original topic at hand?” he asked and raised his eyebrows.
“Mr. Potter” the fake lawyer said and made a card fly towards him. Harry caught it aggressively out of the air. “There’s the divorce court date. Make sure to bring your own lawyer and be punctual. I’ve got everything now.” He smirked and turned to Draco. “That shouldn’t be a problem, Mr. – Malfoy.” He nodded and turned. Neville hesitated, before he walked him to the apparition spot.
He stormed after Pansy and found her by Severus’ office just around the corner. She definitely had been running as well. “Pansy, you can’t do that! What if he says no!?”
Eric smirked, when a car drove into the driveway in Harry’s home and when his uncle got out of the car, he called over the street. “Evening Mr. Dursley!” His wave was way bigger than usual and with a snap of his fingers he made the garden hose roll back into place. And almost everything he had used so much time cleaning up before was done in almost two seconds. Alamar couldn’t help himself, but laugh at Eric’s clear intention of making Harry’s uncle uncomfortable. It wasn’t nice, not even close, but the tension he had felt, made him laugh loudly.
Dwarfbart led them through a corridor to his own office. Ever since Eric had first stepped into Gringott’s, Dwarfbart had been his personal accountant. And that was not going to change. Even though he was now aging a little faster than the goblin, they were still going to life longer than any wizard or witch, so their friendship had a few hundred years more to blossom even brighter.
“Yes, it’s yours, bear. But you can do with it whatever you want. You can just tell the Goblins that you don’t want to have that vault and they’ll clear it.”
Harry grabbed the sweet apple tea and poured the boiling water over it. “It’s too personal. With any other client, I can just be myself, but with him, I… I don’t know. I don’t think I could stay neutral. I don’t want to judge him based on what I think of him.”
Draco smirked and winked at him. “Well done! Hey, didn’t I teach you not to wake me up, little bear?” he asked and grabbed his ward, tickling him.
Shit, did Draco know to hide himself in the upper levels? What if he was to walk down and Ginny and Luna would find him? Ginny would probably call the Aurors right this second, even if Luna would ask her not to. He was a fugitive!
The other wizard actually seemed pissed that he couldn’t get him, though Draco wondered whether or not that was actually professional – actually he knew that it wasn’t professional. Kingsley gave him a warning glance and continued. However, he was interrupted before he could even get two words out.
Draco was taken aback by the sincere honesty of his ward and after a short moment, he smiled back at him. “You don’t understand how much it means to me to hear you say this, Harry. You’re much more mature than I thought you were.”
“She has been brewing some Polyjuice Potion as her project in Potions.” Theodore explained. “We’re transforming Draco, so nobody thinks it’s him. Or can prove it for that matter.”
Harry stayed in the Hospital for almost a week. Draco had been over every day, always for another reason and on Saturday he had finally run out of good ones. He was sure neither Madam Pomfrey, nor any of his friends and Harry had believed him to be there, because he wanted to learn more about DADA. He hadn’t even taken the class anymore…
Or maybe… maybe he was just a vision, like all the other people inside this house. Maybe Luna and Ginny were visions too and his friends had actually stopped caring about him. But that couldn’t be true, right? At least Harry hoped so.
“I felt like that for quite a long time actually” Malfoy continued. “If you want to know the exact time I figured out I was kind of into you, it was the Ministry’s first annual Quidditch game.” He smirked and seemed to develop a soft red color in his face as well.
“'Mione! Ron! Come in, come in!” Harry called from the sofa and grinned broadly, when they entered. Draco smiled at them as well, even though he was still shocked to see them. They were gone from Harry's life for almost the past two years. Not even on Christmasses had they seen each other, even though Draco had made sure to invite them even though Harry seemed to have lost hope.
“You gave me another woman who was too modern. How could I know that insisting on paying for the first date isn’t what you’re supposed to do nowadays?!”
next to him even though it was a three-seater and there was another free space at the other end of the sofa. His whole body tensed and he could feel nausea rising in his chest. While she started talking about something irrelevant, Harry stared at the floor, realizing a whole lot about the person next to him.
The Gryffindor was standing behind the bar, checking different CDs, before a knock stopped him from reading through some letters, accompanying the music. He jumped over the bar elegantly and opened the door.
When Madam Pomfrey came back and gave Harry some potions to take, Pansy sat down on the chair next to Harry again. Something had changed with Harry’s demeanor. Only when the mediwitch went back to write a few sentences on a parchment, he looked at Draco and it actually seemed sad.
“I got you a present, Draco” he said with a smirk, sitting down on the floor cross-legged. “Why don’t you open it?” He pushed it carefully over the floor, while the discussions around them stopped. Harry carefully chose not to look at Hermione. Whatever expression she was making wasn’t what he wanted to see, that much was clear.
In Harry’s mind this explanation was a little too complicated, but Pansy seemed to buy it. “I understand. Blaise’s mother keeps telling me how much power I could have being ‘Lady Zabini’, but I detest it.”
Harry knocked at the door to the Burrow, after having straightened his clothes from the long-distance Portkey travel. He had always hated it, but that was the only way of getting back to UK in a rather decent amount of time.
Potter giggled loudly and hid behind the couch again. Draco grinned. “Hello?” He crawled on all four next to Potter, looked into the other direction and asked once again: “Hello?!” On his right, he could hear someone laugh loudly, followed by a few inelegantly footsteps, before he looked and just about caught his ward going around the corner.
Ernest giggled fully unaware of the heavy sexual tension in the air – or maybe he thought it was too embarrassing to comment on it. Harry saw Hannah looking over at Neville, most likely silently asking what was going on. To his credit, Neville didn’t rat them out, simply rolled his eyes and shook his head.
Oh, he was so wrong. Basically nobody paid attention, as small Harry was apparently everything people would talk about. And yes, he did look precious and adorable with his wand watching Flitwick with big eyes and then reading in the books what he should be able to do. If Pansy hadn’t been used to this scene (minus the wand), he was sure she’d be on the floor, squealing and rocking back and forth over the purity of his ward.
Draco pulled the satchel over his head and left the room as well, motioning his ward to follow him, which he did. The three men slowly made their way back to the official elevators in the Ministry. They weren't slow because they deliberately walked slow; it was because Potter wanted to see everything that was to see on their way.
“I’m pretty sure the solution’s down here. Everything important has its base from here” Malfoy said and looked at the door which led towards the scarlet spiral staircase.
“Well, I found it yesterday” the Gryffindor explained and accepted the coffee Pauline handed him. “I completely lost my way and was just about to just apparate out of here, when I saw this bakery and decided to stay and eat something.”
Alamar laughed and shrugged his shoulders. “As many as I want. This is not some school assignment, but basically a love letter in a different way. I have to break something to tell him how much he means to me.”
Padfoot barked what was probably a thank you, grabbed the toy and headed back to Harry. Draco looked up and found Harry’s quick smirk, which he replied with a satisfied sneer as if to tell him that Padfoot knew best to choose him over Harry. That almost made Harry chuckle, though he managed to roll his eyes in mock annoyance and ruffled Padfoot’s fur once he was back by his feet.
“Still awake, I see?” a sudden voice made Draco jerk up and he looked at the shadowy figure, which turned out to be Blaise.
Harry leaned back and frowned. That was actually true. So, maybe he should indeed help him? Groaning, Harry closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead. “I hate it when you’re right.”
“And I’m meaning it” Draco added shrugging his shoulders. He heard the fabric rustling against the other wizard and his stomach was suddenly the source of a very weird feeling. He had never felt something like this before. It was like his stomach was turning, but he didn’t feel sick. It tingled the way it had when he was on a roller coaster that one happy birthday before everything went downhill and he had to go to school and be a cold-hearted Slytherin. Maybe he was getting a cold?
The form of a Patronus may change during the course of a witch or wizard’s life. Instances have been known of the form of the Patronus transforming due to bereavement, falling in love or profound shifts in a person’s character. Some witches and wizards may be unable to produce a Patronus at all until they have undergone some kind of psychic shock.
Utterly surprised, Potter turned back to the picture and a huge smile was on his face. He then turned the page himself, while Draco watched carefully, so he wouldn’t accidentally destroy something. The next page was full of Potter himself. He was sleeping in his mother’s arms, in his father’s arm and a lot of different people.
A few moments, both enjoyed the silence of the waves crashing in the distance, the earth rotating and the stars wandering through the night sky. Draco nestled closer to Harry again, feeling the heat from his body all around him and a soft happy sigh escaped him, when he closed his eyes.
“It is much more fun to play together though” Draco said and grinned. “And how many lessons have you had?”
“So, what have you been talking about?” Seamus asked and sat down next to Hannah, who moved closer to her husband.
When Draco walked towards his favorite little bakery in one of the back alleys, he stopped suddenly. A very familiar looking head of hair had taken his attention. Harry Potter was in this store?! Before he turned on his heels and walked back to his own office, Draco stopped in the middle of this action. His eyes darted over the Gryffindor again and he wet his lips.
The young woman placed the coke in front of him and smiled. She was just about to say something, when a man entered the restaurant. Draco watched interested, while she went over and hugged him. And then she kissed him on the lips. That was probably not Milos King, unless he was having an affair with a married woman… Which could be true, but would look really bad for his business, especially if he was doing it with a potential customer in sight. Maybe it was just her husband – which seemed more likely.
Before Harry could even say a word about Zabini’s situation, the door to the Common Room opened and Luna entered the room. She stopped and smiled at them. “Sorry, the Nargles led me here. Wrong Common Room. Enjoy your evening.”
Draco blushed slightly, looking at Harry with soft eyes and nodded. “Yes. I may have already been Draco Potter by that time.”
Looking over to Pansy, she looked a little flustered. “Pans, are you okay?” Draco asked, walking over to them as well.
They had been staying in Sviyazhsk for almost two months and it was soon time to move on. Harry had finally gotten his creature travel visa and they were able to move further into Russia. Eric had been travelling there on his own looking for a place to stay for the four of them and where Harry could go to school. Apparently, he had found something and they were going to move in two days.
He had wanted to kiss his husband, hug him, do whatever he wanted that moment – which was almost certainly a good shag – when Theodore burst through the door as the session was over. Luckily, Draco had stood there with Mirjam, exchanging contact information, and they hadn’t been snuggled up like they had for the rest of the session.
Harry nodded somewhat careful and silently and placed some food on his plate. Not as much as Draco had, but he was able to eat more now. At least that was what he had told Draco.
Harry had shrugged his shoulders and brushed even more snow off of him while he threw a few snowflakes into his direction. “I just love snow, you old woolen sock.”
“I wasn’t even supposed to be there, that day.” Harry played with the pasta on his plate, when he said it. He felt Draco staring at him and looked up.
He didn’t look up, too many times had he spent in this court room, not only trying his hardest to make the judges see that he had been innocent, but also looking over the cases he had brought to court. Suddenly, there was a whisper going through the people and Draco heard some people whispering the name ‘Harry Potter’. He stared at his desk. He wasn’t going to look up.
“Yes, the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures took them. I believe they have been sold about a year ago” Neville stated, while he made a copy of the parchment.
Chuckling softly, Draco rolled his eyes, while Potter smirked and answered the unasked question. “Yes, Olivia might have told everyone. And people had their wildest theories about why you were hiding.”
Draco wanted to get up and leave, but the damn Veritaserum kept him there – talking. Talking about things he would have never said out loud. “But I’m the worst person possible! I’ve scared Harry into thinking that he’s getting punished for nothing! I want to kill his relatives every time I read that fucked up parchment and I can’t even... I’m so dead inside, Severus! Caring for him makes me realize how much of an idiot I’ve been! I hate it all!”
