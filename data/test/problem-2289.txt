Draco- Dway
"She will also be helping with the garden and everything else that we need, if we go out she will have the charm placed on her so she doesn't leave our side like a child, she has acted like" finished Arthur making Fudge nod at their decision.
"Mister Weasley, Miss Granger and Mister Malfoy I would like all three of you to come to my quarters after dinner tomorrow so then I can explain everything to your about Hadrian here. Now if you all don't mind classes are about to start so off you go" and Severus left after he managed to get Harry from behind him.
"You are too"
As he came further into the office and he could hear crying.
Sirius changed back into his human form and hugged Remus just as tightly as Remus did.
They all tried and only Harry and Draco managed to get one, they came in a set of four and each one was different, Harry's one was holding a fake pearl necklace while Draco's was holding a gallon. The other two had a crown on it head and the other was holding four different coloured rings which represented the houses of Hogwarts.
Harry interpreted him saying "Hadrian...." but he didn't come out of his hiding place within his father's robes, Otiz was growling now.
I was crying writing this 😭😭😭
"Welcome Harry, once again to a new year" smiled Albus with his grandfather like expression with that blasted twinkle in his eyes yet again.
Hagrid had giant elephant ears
"Hi dad um... someone found Draco" said Harry making both men look at him and the sleeping winged snake in Draco's shoulder.
"Hardian my boy, my son don't listen to what that old coot says, you will never be going back to them, you are my son from the moment I rescued you from them ok" and he hugged him tightly.
"Ok Mr. Lupin I would like to know more about them, that is if my father is ok with that" looking towards Severus for confirmation.
Hadrian- Hads
"No Hadwin upsetted, no woom on bed for me so made human!" stated Otiz matter of factly, he then returned to play with the wolf and the snake.
Once a pissed Otiz showed there was no claiming him down.
"Yes but after something earlier in the summer he can change into a human. Otiz say hi to Draco".
"Hadrian we need to talk about Draco" said Severus as he came into the room smiling, he did that more often than before which made him look more human, more of a person then he knew Severus cared so acting like this also in turn made him smile as well. "Ok dad what is it" asked Harry putting his art work away.
An hour later the two were back in the office they had left, everyone was talking quietly and only stopped when the door opened again.
Poppy nodded to him and went over to collected Claiming Draught and to inform Severus what happened.
"Headmaster please I am the boys father and as his father I am allowed to join said meeting, he is underage to attend a meeting he or his parent feel that it is something bad. I would also like to say that his name is Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, he is no longer Harry James Potter how many times do I have to tell you" snapped Severus at the end of his speech.
"It has come to my attention that two......" he stopped when he notice his voice had changed to something that was very high, squeaky and very girly.
Harry and Draco left the classroom and headed to the stairwell to the office and once they got their Severus was waiting, having let his class go to the library for the rest of the period.
This enraged Albus how dare the brat ignore him! He was Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, he is not to be ignored!!
That child was never cared for until he was taken in by Professor Snape last summer, I thought your father and I brought you lot up to be respectful and not harm others! You young lady are grounded and I think most likely Professor Snape will go to the Ministry about you planning to murder the poor boy as he is his father now.
"I want dad" mumbled Harry to him.
Ginny tried to leave but every time she as stopped! Why in Merlin's name couldn't she get out of her room, she just screamed trying to get her mother's attention but it seemed that wasn't going to work either.
"Now I must tell you about him, he is a cross between a Japanese cat demon called a Bakeneko and a Kitsune which is a fox demon. His eyes will change shape depending on the day and the emotions of our young man that's he has bonded to, his fur will spark when touched but will not hurt those that he trusts, he will lick blood, he will walk without making a sound to others but those who he trusts will hear him, he will keep his wildness but again to will be gentle with those he trusts. He has sharp teeth and claws, has nocturnal habits and they have abnormal speed and agility and that is his Bakeneko side, from his Kitsune side he can shapeshift. Please feed him raw meat when you eat and he will stay with you always" said the teller.
We all know that your grades are now a P so if you want to waste our time by keep saying you are the smartest witch it begs to differ.
Dumbledore wasn't much better, or Dum-Dum as he had taken to call him when he was in his room or with his father, he hated how he had tried to get him away from his father and back into his "loving" family as Dumbledore kept saying.
We also know that Ginvera Molly Weasley has now become a slave to the Weasley family as her magic is also been bound, she in other words is a Muggle slave, I don't condone slaves in no way shape of form it's only for the story ok!!
Ok peeps I need some ideas on how Fred and George are going to play some pranks for their younger siblings.
Harry said nothing and continued to eat some toast and butter as he had filled up on bacon and eggs before his whole resorting.
By dinner that night she was complete and couldn't wait for her teachers to give her full marks as she had made sure to add extra points and information onto each essay that she had wrote, they were perfect in her book.
"Yes Luna he is but he's still in trouble for breaking my last quill and stealing the others including dad's favourite one, so we are on a mission to get him a new one and a few more for me and hopefully he doesn't eat them again and end up at Madam Pomfrey again.
They had decided that from this day forward Harry would be known as Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, Severus didn't want to take away Harry's connection to his father so let him keep his name but he thought that adding his own would help as now he had two father's.
Soon the adults had come out Tom was holding Severus' hand which made poor Severus blush at it all, they had now been dating for a good few months but only ever showed it to their friends and family and never at school, they didn't want the students to have a heart attack that Severus Tobias Snape had a heart even though they knew how protective he was of Harry.
((hey I turned him into a rag doll))
~You love me really Tommy~
"Hey what was that for?" moaned Harry slowly getting up.
"Otiz. Get. Here. Now"
"I am his father now as you know I have given you copies of all the documents from both Gringotts as well as the Ministry there should be no reason why my son should go back there!"
Arthur stood in the office but once Minvera gestered to the chair that his daughter had just vacated he sat down, Severus sat in the other and bridged his hands on his lap, in thinking but the others to knew he was annoyed.
As they walked round the corner to head towards the hippos he stopped making his father look at him and then without question on why he did that Harry his behind him, shaking.
"Hi...." Harry hid right away from the man dragging Otiz with him now that he was back to his animal form, growling at the man.
Once he had paid for everything, Otiz just smiled at them; this smile meant mischief.
It was a start of a new day just before Halloween, Harry's most hated day if you asked him that is but on a different hand it meant that he could spend some time with his father and study in quiet.
Severus knew he was listening but wanted everyone now to know that he wasn't.
He never noticed pale arms wrap around him until he heard the voice that whispered in his ear.
A Metamorphmagus
"You're an idiot but your my idiot" said Severus once Tom finally let him go, they continued to watch the film and many more as well eat the chocolates late into the night.
"Oh it's away from her, upstairs now" said Molly once she noticed her daughter had finished her food, "up early we have to go out and when we get back the garden" Ginny moved upstairs moaning and groaning as she went but her parents ignored her.
His nose picked up on something which he didn't like... he sniffed again and then growled making everyone look towards him, his emerald green eyes flashing to a red colour and then his ears popped out of nowhere making everyone jump.
Albus smiled at himself, he knew what the Dursley's did to the boy but he couldn't care he needed his weapon to defeat Voldemort and by Merlin he was going to have him.
"Our Haddy-kins is growing up so fast" the finished together, only to be tackled to the floor by Otiz in fox form.
"Molly and Artie as well? Billy and Charlie too?" yet again this was answered by a smile.
After breakfast Harry was tag teamed by Ron and Hermione asking what on earth had happened, but Harry didn't want to say anything and so stepped back slightly only to bump into his father.
"This is Otiz my familiar, as you saw he is very protective of me and that if anyone tried to hurt me he WILL retaliate as you saw" said Harry to them scratching Otiz behind the ears.
The banging of the door brought Harry to look at his father who was now by the liquor cabinet and pouring himself a glass of fire whisky, finally sitting down he took a sip and sighed slightly.
Pansy picked him up only to have him squirm within her arms but didn't try to get out of them.
..........
"I was shocked to say the least of what my best friend's son has been though and how unlike his father he is due to it" mumbled Remus but everyone heard him.
His new name being Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape.
"So Snape...." shape was cut off but Harry.
"You know his parents are dead Professor you know that right, he saved the Wizarding world when he was a baby and then treated well by the way of his family and then came here" said Yasmin to him only to shrink back when he looked at her.
Albus wasn't happy, he the great Albus Dumbledore was being ignored! How dare he!
"Gross!!" she yelled making everyone in the hall to look at her, they couldn't see what was on her and why she screamed, only what they heard was quiet snickering and then running feet.
Once he was finished and without being noticed Otiz headed towards the Head Table and pulled slightly on Lucius' robes making the man look at him and smile.
Date of Birth:
"I know you are you idiot, and I think I can forgive you" as he ate the last of his favourite chocolate cake.
"Very nice now go sit with Hadrian and then we can start the lesson, ok" and she rubbed behind his ears getting a mew from him.
"Well when you fell asleep I told both Narcissa and Lucius about what had happened and I told Draco to let by gones be by gones and I don't think he will without you saying anything."
This is a three POV's in one as how I have written it on a different sight it went passed the limit
"Miss Granger I will have to give you detention about trying to steal Mr Malfoy's familiar during your detention I will explain what is right and wrong with how you have acted just today alone, first class of the day and you are already in trouble.
They had finally finished with all the magical toys and so Severus thought it would be a good idea to go into Muggle London to finish getting something's for Otiz while spending time with his two boys, yes he was now counting Otiz as a son instead of a familiar to Harry.
"...with this" the twins finished as they piled on some more eggs to their plate, making her huff in annoyance at them, they got away with way to much as it was.
His hair lay completely tidy on his head thankful that it was no longer looking like a bird's nest on top of his head like it normally was, it was now smart and neat, it really was a combination of James and his own hair.
"Hadrian son, I know you never had much growing up with those muggles but I thought it would be a great chance for you to experience something wonderful and oh so magical, not in the sense of magic but you will see what I mean when we get there honest.
"Yes" was all he said.
He also wanted to be with the Malfoy family he loved baking cookies with Narcissa or Cissa as she wanted him to be called and because of that it also meant that he got to know Draco's cousin Dora more as well as her mother Andromeda and her husband Edward Tonks, it looked like he now had a huge family that all loved him unlike the Dursley's which he had a feeling that Tom was up to something with them.. that or he had his snake Nagini do something.
The Clarks-
"Otiz don't go eating the quill again or I won't get you more meat from me" said Luna making everyone laugh.
Age 11:
"Your sorry your damn brat just admitted to over five hundred people, teachers and students alike that she was going to kill my son...MY SON! She should be the one to say something like that not that I would accept it to be honest.
Otiz listen to the whole thing, he was in his child form drinking his blood, Harry and Severus had yet again managed to get him to wear something different than his normal colours, today he was wearing a purple top with a silver dragon on and black trousers.
The three smiled at the two animals but stopped when Eriol came flying in and crash landed in Ron's dinner if all things who was quickly followed by Tyki who landed on Severus with a letter attached to his leg from one Molly Weasely.
Percy- Pert
He clamped his hands over his mouth trying to stop himself but he couldn't they are now coming thick and fast.
The reason why your scar didn't hurt through the trial was because I was able to create a spell that wouldn't hurt either of us if we were in close proximity of each other all I have to to is cast it where I know you would be close and we would be fine.
"Can you sort out that thing of yours" said Ron but this made Otiz go on the attack but stopped when he felt Harry grab hold of him.
I will be informing your parents as your father works at the Ministry I think he would like to know what you have been doing.
Once standing in front of everyone Harry whimpered again and tried to hide again but with Severus' hands on his shoulders, he mumbled his name but no one hears him and so Severus bent down slightly and said "Hadrian can you say that a bit louder for everyone to hear you please?"
"I can't believe our Saviour has turned into a slimy snake of all things, what is the Wizarding world coming to? What do we do when He Who Shall Not Be Named can come and get us and kill us all!"
"Otiz calm the hell down you almost attacked poor Theo!" said Harry when he walked into the dorm room seeing the pacing familiar.
"Dad what's going on?" Otiz just growled, he wasn't happy and he now had bright first Red hair and his emerald green eyes where now glowing.
"Dad gave us some money but I don't want you to go over the top and spend it all here" this made Otiz nod to him, transform into his teenage form and left them to have a look around.
"He's been like this since I got up today he said and I quote "I'm bored so lets annoy as many people as possible" and since I've decided to pack or at least try too in case at hand and each item I put in, he throws out" sighed Harry as he again placed his uniform into his trunk only for Otiz to grab one and tried to throw it out but Tom caught him.
We know that Hadrian is somewhat of a shy young man after what has happened to him but he is getting more and more confident as the story went on.
Prince- Adopted Father (Heir)
Otiz curled round the chair making sure they both were safe and nothing could harm them, while everyone said a quick hello to each other.
Once inside Albus looked a bit shocked at seeing Severus with Harry of all things.
"Miss Granger we are here as your head of house and as Headmaster to talk about what has landed you here in the first place" said Tom as he came in followed by Minerva waving his wand to fix the upturned table.
"Well as far as I can work out he hasn't.... what is that Muggle saying... I can't believe I just asked that".
A little date with our two loveable Slytherin's Severus and Tom
Petunia K. Dursley nee Evans (Aunt) Vernon P. Dursley (Uncle), Dudley V. Dursley (Cousin)
Draco: chess set from Severus and from Harry a broom cleaning kit, his parents got him new sets of robes and some sweets
I didn't have any friends at school that is if I was allowed to go but once the officers came stating that I was meant to go at the beginning of the year, which by that time was now after Christmas they started sending me.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, this is the best present ever!!" said Harry getting up and hugging not just Severus but Tom as well.
"I'm sorry sir, I'll be more quiet. Please sir I won't disobey you again. Just don't hit me"
"I would like to know why that is, that Harry....."
Harry and his friends left as well but before the could get a good several feet away from the classroom Harry was swept into an iron grip from Otiz as he waited outside for them.
He bit her shoulder hard making her scream out more, Otiz went to protect Harry but Draco had started to pull him away and hide behind a  tree away from everything that had happened, he was in tears being hugged by Draco he was safe.
Narcissa- they both agreed that the necklace was from them both
"It is not my story to tell it is Hadrian's if he should choose to divulge to, I am his father and as you stated when he got resorted at the beginning of the year" sighed Severus calling another house elf for another fire whiskey as he knew it was going to be a long night as well as a long weekend.
Mark my words you slimy, disgusting death eater worshipper! You being that slimy gits son makes no difference you will be going down!
In parseltongue Harry his a thank you as well but he added papa onto it making said man blush but didn't say anything to the pre teen.
Severus paid for the cleansing and blood adoption and with that they all left to do their own thing, Severus took Harry home to Spinners End so then he could rest in bed.
"Love was it the same again, him not knowing you?" asked the man making the two girls giggle.
The main course was of course Lucius favorite meal which was a beef Wellington with onion chive mash, green beans, wine gravy and for drinks the adults had a glass of either rosé or white wine the boys had non-alcoholic wine and Otiz was happy with his blood.
"Please state attorney's"
'Thats strange he never cries, at least not in front of anyone that is' thought the owner of the voice as he walked further in.
Once everyone had read and re-read over Harry's results they knew that they had to inform the Ministry right away, they had to inform Cornelius Fudge about what Albus Dumbledore had done to the Saviour, what he had done to the poor boy but it could wait until tomorrow as they didn't want to wake the poor boy up, he was out cold on his father's shoulder snoring quietly.
Bang!
Favourite subject: Potions because of Severus and Transfiguration because of Minerva
"My homework professor and I hope that it exceeds all my others I spent almost all night on it!" she sung happily to him only for him to look at her in shock.
Happy with what he was given Otiz got about drawing but his ears and tail had popped out when Ron tried again to get Harry's attention.
"We have..."
By Merlin it hurt more than anything he could imagine, it hurt more than facing Voldemort the first ever time when looking for the Philosopher Stone and having to put up with Vernon's abuse and torture! It hurt so, so much more that he began to cry.
Draco looked and sure he notice her blue colouring and her wings hitting Hermione's face, "it is, I think I can get her into trouble, Granger I mean".
"Yeah he shouldn't be here he should be back where he belongs!" sneered Ginny to the Slytherin perfect only to make him think about who it could be.
Many wanted to leave her there but it would look so bad if another teacher would come in and see her and so with great reluctance Madam Pinch called for a house elf to bring her to the Hospital Wing.
"Oh Harry" said Severus as he continued to comfort the boy in his arms and after fifteen full minutes Severus finally let go as Harry was now calm enough to talk to him.
"Me Kitsune!" was all he got as a response.
They spent the day preparing dinner as well as Harry baking a cake and some cookies which he wouldn't stop talking about, they had the full Christmas dinner but it was way to much to just eat on their own but as they were going over to the Malfoy's tomorrow they thought that bringing some left overs would be ok, the following day they would be going over to the Weasley's which Harry wasn't too happy about but he would go none the less.
"Lord Prince if you would likely sit in the chair in front of the desk with young Heir Prince that would be grateful" said Griphook.
As they were eating their snacks Otiz changed form and stole Blaise's coffee and his biscuits.
"Yes Professor, they belong to me. I have to be honest to you I only wanted to be the best witch around, I didn't want to be out done because I'm Muggleborn! I just wanted to prove myself! I didn't care if I had to cheat to do it!" said Hermione getting more and more worked up.
"These dunderheads don't know how to even gold a spoon. T for Troll, it's bad" there was red marks all over the work he wasn't even reading the work to grade ithe was so annoyed, tears streaming down his face.
~Sorted it yet Tom?~
His father had finally someone to love other than him but they were father and son nothing more, they had spent a whole night talking and it turned out that Severus had known his mother and they were best friends until he had called her something that he had promised never to repeat to another living soul as it was a very dirty and derogative word to any living soul that he came across if they were born to non magical parents which happened to be..........
Albus sat down at his desk and screamed again, he waved his hand and brought his lemon drops back onto the table and took one out of the bowl and put in his mouth.
This also would make it very hard to get any sort of job within the Wizarding World meaning that he would have to go to work outside, in the Muggle World which wasn't good within the Sacred families.
Once back in their apartment he finally collasped into a chair and sighing, he took of his shoes and sunglasses, he was going to take his har out of its pony tail but stopped when he saw a flash of light.... a camera and one sorry teenager was looking at him.
"We goes now, now, now!" said Otiz as he wriggled out of his grip taking some clothes with him and into the room.
The following day Harry didn't want to get out of bed, today they were going back to dingy Scotland, so then he could finish his school work and then go back to classes..... Nope not going to happen in his book......
I would never wish this to happen to to anybody old or young to go through what he has been through, it's just wrong I wouldn't wish my twins to go through this they have lost their mother already, again I am sorry for what my client has put young Mister Snape through" by the end of this he was crying and Albus was red with fury!
Harry was just placing his cap on his head when a knock on the door came, this made him flinch but Severus went to answer it.
"Rude much Harry Potter"
Filius got off his stack of books and cast a Patronus and sent a message to Severus asking for him to meet the boys at the entrance to the Headmasters office.
He just nodded to him and then Harry appeared again holding some shorts and a t-shirt.
"I'm not sure Hadrian" as he took his hand and lead him over to Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop as someone hybrid Kitsune had decided to eat Harry's last quill and stole the others as he was bored in animal and six year old form.
~You know Tom he won't like to be called that~
"My name is Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape! I'm not Harry Potter!" and he glared again.
"She's meant to be there, where was she? How is Hadrian?" she asked.
Tom in this has a Hungarian accent ok as he's trying to portray someone from Hungry, just image it if you don't know what it sounds like.
"Don't even think about it, you attacked Hardian verbally while you Weasely attacked him, even if it was grabbing him and pulling him".
Memory of the rescue:
"Harry come on, come back to us your real friends" said Hermione
"I think we would just stick with the cotton type of robes but they need to be completely stain proof as his diet is nothing but blood mainly.
"Professor McGonagall how nice to see you please do come in" said Harry to her but she just shook her head and motioned for him to follow her.
"WHAT??!! they hate me, me and Draco fight all the time we cant stand being in the same room as each other!" yelled Harry after taking a drink washing down the lodged food.
"We just wanted to know what was going on, why Har... I mean Hadrian isn't in Gryffindor anymore, why he changed his name that's all!"
"I did wonder where She Weasel was as well as Weasel, now I know" said Blaise.
~fine I'll let you have your fun if you leave us out of your fun and games~
Draco gulped but gained his resolve after a few tense minutes.
He gasped in pain and shock making everyone come to him as he panicked due to his past, Otiz came out of nowhere and picked her up by the neck.
They arrived back at Hogwarts by eleven am and so it was back to the mundane life of a student and teacher......
.........
"What was that for?!" snarled Otiz transforming into his human form but he was ignored which didn't help his anger, after helping Harry back up he went over to her, his green eyes glowing.
As they were having their dinner a burst of green flames appeared and then disappeared to reveal one Albus Dumbledore, he nodded to the pair and when he noticed Otiz, he couldnt make out what it was but the darn thing was hissing and growling at him.
They had finally finished their meal and headed to the lounge where Draco's presents were but they noticed that the wrapping paper everywhere and Harry and a teenage Otiz was now playing chess with Draco's brand new chess set.
Tom walked in with Fawkes on his shoulder, he had taken a liking to Tom even though he knew he had Nagini as well, he was perfectly happy on his new spot, Dumbledore never took him out like Tom was doing.
"Severus I need to know as his former Head of House I would like to know why one of my favourite lions has turned into a snake and your son at that" she retaliated to her ex student and work colleague.
Once inside the office Severus saw Albus in mid tantrum screaming at the students in the room.
"Hadrian son you can't sleep just yet we have to go to the Ministry first..."
Ten minutes into just sitting there relaxing with some coffee and a potions books, Otiz was in the land of nod and wasn't going to be waking anytime soon.
"...to do....."
He opened the door only to be hit with the smell of blood, he looked around the room but it was way too dark so he whispered"Lumos" and gasped at the sight before him.
"You're disgusting and if you come anywhere near the Puffs you will be dealt with" amd he returned to his seat, Professor Sprout, Pomona looked towards the Gryffindor table and then looked at Minerva.
"Harry I will make sure he won't be removed and I think Severus will almost make sure that doesn't happen. Now I know you have the spell down can you show me?" she asked and right away Harry smiled back.
Favourite food: any raw meat, he does like plain cooked pasta!
"Miss Granger I am now the Headmaster of the school Albus....."
What do you think so far, I know its only from what we have read so far but after this it will be Gringotts and I think....................................................... wait and find out, hope you enjoyed it so far and I'm hoping you like where I will take this story in the future.
Severus glared at the two Gryffindor students telling them silently to 'shut the fuck up' and he let Draco continue but this time it was Blaise that continued.
If he wants to he can get the Ministry to take action as using self writing quills in Hogwarts is against the rules, what you have done about bullying and raping students you WILL make a formal writing apology to each and everyone one of them through letter and a full public display.
"Did Sir's have a good look around the resort? Is there anything we as the staff help you with?" asked Nairi to them but Harry only shook his head and smiled towards her.
Magical Syphoning Spell keyed to Albus Dumbledore
"They know I'm the smartest witch around!" she stopped and thought for a moment, yes that must be it! She must be here because she was doing so well they thought that she would be better off to study without any distractions in place i.e. the other students.
Werewolf Remus noticed the change in the air, his mate was trying to protect his now extended pack but the stupid thing was there being protected by the fox that now looked human, he snarled only for Otiz to snarl back at him, him being more dominate at the moment as he was protecting their cub, always protect the cub more than anything the cub was the most important.
Otiz on his plate he had a small amount of raw meat as well as a bit of cooked meat, the adults were happy eating the seared salmon with roasted potatoes in a chive and butter dressing along with a freshly picked summer Caesar salad and that was just the starter.
"Hello and welcome, what can I do for you fine gentlemen today?" asked the jeweller he seemed nice enough which put Harry at ease, "I would like the necklace with the three tear drops on please" he said just loud enough to be heard.
"Otiz as you know both me and Hadrian went to the zoo today as it was only the second time he has been there but as we were in the reptile house, Hadrian and I ran into some people we both never wanted to see" explained Severus to the hybrid who nodded.
"Professor me and Blaise were walking to Potions with Hadrian..." Draco was cut off by both Ron and Hermione saying his name was Harry.
"I missed you so much Paddy, after James and Lilly died I had no one else. Harry went to his aunt's, you in Azkaban, Wormy high tailed it out of there, I was so alone" and he started crying.
"What's wrong" he asked quietly to the boy but said boy just carried on crying not making any sense of what was happening to him.
"Welcome students, I know the term is coming to an end in the next couple of weeks but I would like to welcome you all to a new year, I do hope I can live up to your expectations of a acceptable Headmaster in the next coming weeks.
"I'm sorry professor I've been asked by the Headmaster to bring Snape to the Headmaster as well, I'm sorry that I won't be able to attend class" said Draco only to have Filius sigh and turned to Harry.
She humped and headed back into the castle only to feel something cold and wet slipping down her hair and the back of her neck.
"So Poppy hasn't told you then? Well I was informed just recently that Mister Potter's household currently at the residence of 4 Privet Drive is unsafe for the child. Albus he is a young boy soon to be a second year at that! He has been abused since he was three years old".
Harry sighed into Severus and was almost asleep but Otiz had other plans and for the first ever time he disappeared out of the room in search for something.
I'm sorry that I scared Theodore I truly am but I heard Lady Hogwarts complain about that girl and how she and the rest of them bullying you and now she is taking action.
"Forge I have ideas on how we could make them feel how our little brother has made Hadikins feel right now" said Fred looking at his brother.
"Hads please it's what..." casts a tempus charm to check the time, ".....it's 5.30 am go back to sleep please" said Draco trying to draw the covers over his head but was stopped by said boy.
"Otiz it's ok they are my god parents, uncle Luc and aunt Cissa, they aren't going to hurt me, promise" said Harry to his familiar who in turn sniffed them both and then licked them which didn't please Lucius at all but once it was explained to them that Otiz was Harry's familiar they left it alone.
Grandmothers:
Otiz came up to her and licked her hand like he did over Christmas and the nuzzled her as if to say thank you for stepping in, he then turned to the younger Weasely's and hissed and made snapping noises making them both jump sky high.
At the end of lunch Fred and George walked up to Harry and his friends and they put their arms around him smiling.
Not really wanting to help the man up due to what has been happening helped him up with disgust. Albus once on his feet pushed Lucius away grumbling about 'stupid blonde haired pure bloods' and walked back to his bed and stared up at the ceiling having nothing else better to do.
Wanting to get away from the professor as quickly as possible Draco he left the room and headed down to Charms class, he knocked and waited for Filius to let him in.
Albus threw himself at Lucius in angry and tried to assault him with all his might but being much younger than the old man Lucius moved out of the way making Albus fall helplessly on to the floor.
"Headmaster if I have to remind you again that my son is called Hadrian he is no longer Harry James Potter! Can't you get that into your head!" Severus had raised his voice which woke up from his sleep.
Health:
Harry just nodded to him and slowly got up only for both Otiz and Severus to notice that his stuffed animals were alive somehow.
Harry took his hand to help him up and because his glasses where broken he had to have help anyway.
Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape (Harry James Potter)
Ron and Hermione were pissed, now they are sporting weasel ears and cat ears on their heads but what was making everyone laugh more was that Hermione had whiskers growing, the same with Ron.
The trio knew nothing of what was going on, they were still trying to figure out what was going on with Hermione's school work to notice now that they were left alone in the tower.
Wasn't much of a surprise that Harry got resorted into that house right??
Soon they were at one of the smaller coasters which was a hanging glider coaster called the Glider, simple enough and something to ease the boy into.
"Quite now if you would let me continue. Yes this has never happened before but due to what has happened over the past few months, this person has been adopted and their parents would like them to be resorted so I would ask one Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape to come up" and so Harry stood up and walked to where the sorting hat now lay.
Hermione went to her dorm room to start on her homework for the night, she had Charms, DADA as well as Potions to complete.
I was locked in the cupboard under the stairs for ten years it was only before I started that I got that sorry excuse of a cousin's second bedroom, which they did so many things to me!
Dumbledore stood up once everyone had sat down and had said "we all love to have a joke now and then and I'm wondering when..." he stopped and looked at the Weasely twins who were playing the innocent game as they knew that everyone knew that they wouldn't prank themselves.
Harry cried and cried, his magic lashing out of him! His magic took on a purple hue but we going black around the edges.
"I no wike you mister" said Otiz pointing at Lupin, eyes glowing in displeasure.
~parseltongue~
Severus slowly got up with the help from Remus, Otiz was again glued to his robes holding tightly too it while Severus went to the dorm Harry shared with Blaise and Draco.
Otiz snuggled into her embrace and was snoring softly, this made everyone coo at the small boy who was completely out cold, the nap should do him some good as he hated the Floo more than anything animal or not.
Soon they had ordered their food and were waiting for them, only Otiz something sitting on Draco's head.
When he got to the door, he notice Otiz pacing back and forth and that his once sky blue fur was now blood red, his emerald green eyes were also red! He was angry!
"Hadrian can you choose something for me please this nice man has offered to buy you something due to what he happened.
How in Merlin's name did they stop him!
"Miss Lovegood" bowed Draco to her making Harry roll her eyes at him.
By lunch time Ron still hadn't come back but the rest of the Weasely's had turned up to have enjoy the atmosphere that came with Christmas even though it was just left overs from the day before no one complained about it.
Peverell- Father (Lord)
Minerva was not happy, she had made it completely clear what would happen to him if he carried on but would the boy listen to her or even his own parents from last year's Howler, nope.
A door slowly formed out of the stone wall and opened to reveal Severus' private quarters, Severus allowed Harry to walk in first. Harry looked around in amazement, there were books everywhere, the walls were a dark green, there was a black leather sofa covered with papers, Severus then started towards a room with a closed door, Harry stayed put, Severus then turned around to look at Harry.
~who?~
"As I was saying die to evidence that was giving to the court as well as Mister Harrington, Mister Potter has been adopted by Severus Snape on the 6th August last year" everyone looked to Harry who looked to be shaking in his seat making Severus hug him as well as Otiz.
"So you think that you can work your way out of our fight just because your stupid little runt of an animal showed it to McGonagall of all things, I'll just make sure that you come at another time.
Werewolf Remus looked at them, stroking them but turned away when he heard a howl, this made Otiz change form as well wondering where the noise was coming from, he wanted to follow but Harry's hand was in his fur tightly so he stayed.
"Just wait until I tell the headmaster about this you two will be sorry, if not I'll tell your mother" she said as she got up and walked out of the hall.
He was going to continue when someone tapped him on the shoulder, looking up he saw the teenage Otiz glaring down at him.
Yes he kept everything in his vault that was given to him by his birth parents and ancestors in the Potter name but as he was adopted everything had changed name, it was now under the name Snape.
Blaise and pansy had managed to get away with no hair change and animal appendages which he was happy about.
"Harry I'm..." he was cut off by Harry
And off they go back to Hogwarts
"Ok as you know I adopted you, as well as I am a godparent...." he waited for it to click with Harry to see where this was going, to his nod Severus continued.
He bored as Hadrian wanted to spend sometime alone to do his homework with his friends and it fell down to me to look after him.."
Percy- Perce
"Mister Weasley, you are the first person of this school year that has detention with me 7pm if you will, straight after dinner, if you please".
The female Nymphadora was strange her hair kept changing every colour of the rainbow while Charlie kept hold of her.
"...think..."
"They called me a traitor and my friends slimy snakes" mumbled Harry into his father's chest, as he moved he hissed in pain drawing everyone's attention to him.
"Yes little one we are, but I don't know about your hair? Can you change the colour of it by any chance?" asked Severus.
He looked towards Harry asking if it was ok when he was told who it was, Harry to be honest loved the women she was nice but strict, just like Severus really mind you.
Automatically Severus began to scratch him behind his ears making him to a pile of furry jelly ((a/n couldn't resist)) when Remus tried Otiz eyes opened up and then he wanted to growl but his Bakeneko and Kitsune was telling him he was something more.
"Everyone get into the Great Hall for dinner please and once I know I will inform you all of what has happened now off you go" she said and then once all the students left the hallway she walked over to Severus and Harry.
Madam Pinch was looking annoyed as she had orange hair
That felt nice and he wanted to have that done to him again and so let Narcissa help him with the memories.
"...night" they said going back and forth.
🌸Animal ears and tails
Here are the names he gives his three transformations
Minerva had Slytherin green hair
Draco looked down and sure enough Harry was out cold on his shoulder snoring lightly as he slept, Otiz had made himself small enough to fit on his lap who was also asleep, Draco brought Harry to him so that he was stretched out on the sofa with his head in his lap as he talked to Blaise about their visit to Hogsmeade tomorrow morning.
"Oh look Looney Lovegood and someone else" said Pansy "do you guys remember her name? I don't".
"That bloody prat once I get a hold of him....." Ron didn't finish as his sister came up to them.
"Tomas I'm sorry, I know what you have done for me means the world, I can't thank you enough for what you have done for me over the past few months but Harry is with Snivellus!"
"Who in Merlin's name has done this to my Hadrian, I will kill them once I know who it is!" and he snarled at the three in the room.
"...to do..."
It had been weeks so far and none of the pranks had stopped, everyone still had animal ears and tails as well has their hair was still a different colour, even if they had changed colour over and over again, it was almost Easter and nothing was being done to stop them.
"Miss Granger is that true? you have been trying to steal someone's familiar? that is unheard of, you could kill the familiar as well as the person they are bonded to
"Harry it's ok, can you look at me please? It's me Professor Snape, can you please look at me?" asked Severus to the scared boy, who slowly but sure made eye contact with the man in black. ((sorry people had to say it like that, I am watching men in black at the same time as writing this))
Tom still hadn't worked out how to grovel to Severus it had been three weeks and he still hadn't a clue.
"Hadrian is having a panic attack after he was verbally abused by Weasley, asking why he was in Slytherin and not in Gryffindor like last year" explained Draco to her while leading Harry over to a bed.
Minerva got there just before Severus started to tell everyone about what had happened to Harry only to stop in her tracks when she heard Harry crying into Severus.
They need to be rip due to his teeth and claws, in other words they need to be highly durable for all occasions" explained Severus.
Hermione noticed right away that her book had bits and pieces missing and so she would have to look it up if Madam Pince would let her that is or she would get another failing grade which she couldn't afford to get.. she was getting worse than Crabbe or Goyle and they don't even do their homework.
"Harry we will tell them that I have become your guardian, that is all. Your name has been changed on the school registers now you are Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, my son as of three weeks ago.
"...her..."
"Welcome everyone to a new day.." he smiled to them, a genuine smile "...I assume that you have all noticed that Headmaster Dumbledore is not here.." everyone nodded at his comment but said nothing.
"I will sort this all out Harry I promise but first and foremost the adoption if you would Griphook" this made him nod and again pulled out the necessary documents which was mostly filled in by the Goblins already as the ink was still wet and handed over to Severus to sign.
"You girl come anywhere near Hadrian or his friends and I won't hesitate to rip that pretty little throat of yours"
His name will be for evermore be:
"Misters Malfoy and Zabini good evening to you as well as Mister Potter or should I now say Snape?"
It was becoming to the end of the year when out of the blue along with Draco, Blaise and Theo, Harry was attacked by the dog, snarling at the Slytherin's not noticing that Harry was also wearing Slytherin colours.
"...that?" the twins asked only to have Harry come up to them with Severus and Draco behind them, after the whole panic attack was over, he was still shaking but otherwise fine if he had is father with him.
"So little Potter is alone eating" said Ron to him, making him stop.
Harry was beside himself, he just couldn't wait to go to the theme park, when Draco's birthday was upon them Harry just couldn't sit still as it was soon going to be the day that they would spend at the theme park with his family and he just couldn't wait for it to come.
Severus had bright Hufflepuff yellow hair
Other Professor's have also come to voicing their complaint that have been brought to them about you, each one having evidence in hand.
"Ok Otiz I'm done here for now lets see what we can  do until tomorrow while Hadrian packs his things, have you seen Tom?"
"What's going on?"
Theo- Two
............
Then Otiz noticed Tom who smiled at the boy only to have said boy look at him making his eyes flicker red like Tom's had done.
"Today we will be practicing the Cheering Charm, this charms make the person the spell is used on feel elated but if it's over used they will have fits of hysterical laughter, this could also be used as a counter charm to the hiccoughs" explained Filius to everyone and then he demonstrated the wand movement making sure that it was slow enough for them to follow.
This year we will be learning about the Lapifors spell that turns the person into a rabbit, the hardening charm as well as the Animagus spell that will help you turn into an animal of your choice..." and she transformed into her cat form.
Yes he was James and Lilly's son, yes he looked like a spitting image of his father James but he was Lilly more than anything he could see it in all the little things he did and Severus was proud to have his hated bully's son as his own. His own flesh and blood so to speak... he was after all blood adopted so he was his own son, if only Harry's parents could see him now after what he had gone through he bet that they would be happy with his decision.
They went and had a quick breakfast of tropical pancakes with coconut syrup, by Merlin it was the best with a glass of milk each and some coffee before the decided to leave.
Harry took the toy off him which made him almost cry but when he turned the child to the other toy's, on the shelves he saw children Quidditch toys, brooms, snitches, quaffles, ect...
Arthur returned home that night to Molly making dinner for just them and a small sandwich for her disgusting daughter.
"Severus please be reasonable on this, Harry..."
"Quit fussing over me Poppy, I am fine" he said to her but he knew he had a concussion from the impact of Albus' out of control magic a.k.a. his tantrum.
"What brings everyone here? Just before dinner I might add?" she asked them, the dorm mate of Hermione stepped forward and told her everything that had happened over the last school year and how Hermione was using a self writing quill and selling answers to everyone within the school. Other students told her of the bullying that the younger Weasely's and Granger had been dong to poor Harry, getting a cheap way out of homework by getting answers of Hermione.
God siblings:
Within half an hour most of the class had it, sadly not Hermione which she wasn't happy about, Otiz just smiled and pointed his wand at her without any movement of it the spell was fired and she started laughing.
"Miss Granger what we all saw was that firstly you accused young Mister Weasely about placing a spell on you which has been confirmed by the rest of the Gryffindor house to be in true, the you accuse me as well as threaten me for unknown reasons and the you attack your fellow student..
"Calm down" said Tom trying to help but he was just flung back and into Severus' waiting arms, "ouch".
"Oh ok...." he wasn't sure about this so Poppy stepped in this time along with Minerva and Narcissa.
They all headed out to the park, they had made a progress of going from the slow and careful rides as not to over whelm Harry as he had never done anything like this before and to gain more experience on them, today would be the ultimate test for the boy which he couldn't wait for he was practically jumping up and down even at almost 14 years old.
Age 3:
My uncle would beat me so many times with so many different items his favourite would be the belt or even the bat, I would come out bloody and bruised but I thought that was how a family acted I knew no different it only got worse when my letter came...."
She knocked on the door and waited for Hagrid to answer but when he did and saw who it was he wasn't happy about it.
Otiz was having a ball day with is fur changing and was up at the staff table showing everyone he could, when he got to Dumbledore he hissed at him and carried on to Poppy and Pomona who both smiled at him.
Molly- Molls
"Welcome to another new year at Hogwarts! I would like to welcome all the new students that have come this year to start their education but I would also like to welcome a new teacher to our staff this year..." he trailed off when Remus looked at him and stood up, he still had a bar of chocolate in his mouth as he completely forgot about it.
"Yay"
Yahtzee brought a plate of raw meat to the staff table and placed in front of Remus making Otiz happily tuck into his food.
".... Hadrian" said Severus cutting off the Headmaster.
”I’m alright,” he managed.
“A war,” he said. “Something like a war, it was all in his memories. And the dementors are feeding on him. He’s the source.”
The snake gave no indication that it understood, but he felt certain that it did.
"You're going out now?"
Draco kept quiet and listened as they worked out the alternative routes and who should take which ones at what intervals. He had never liked Potter’s friends much, but it was hard not to be impressed by them. They hadn’t been exactly friendly this time, but they were not hostile either. As soon as the planning had begun, they all became business-like and practical.
“Yeah,” Harry says.
Harry frowned.
He shrugged.
“We flew on thestrals when we went to the Ministry in fifth.”
Pansy shrugged.
“Of course. I am sorry I couldn’t bring him earlier, but thank you for accepting him back so late. It was very unfortunate that he fell ill just when school began.”
He felt like he might fall asleep while walking. He was slightly drunk too, and his mouth carried the corpse-like aftertaste of shitty beer.
“Right. Of course you do.”
forgiveness and he definitely doesn’t deserve yours.”
“Will she be okay while you’re away?”
friends are just
Malfoy's voice was acidic. Familiarly so. Harry watched the way Malfoy's bony shoulders rose, the way he kept fiddling with the tea rather than turn around.
“Really? I mean, considering the parts we played in the war, I think some of us could have some political influence if we tried?”
“I don’t know, are you? Doesn’t look like you’ve changed much to me.”
By that time, he had started leaving his room again for meals. He would eat with his mother in the dining hall. Sometimes she would talk, and he wouldn’t say anything. Sometimes they just ate in silence. When it had been four days she started asking him when he was planning on going back to school. She was gentle at first, but then she got tired of his indifferent shrugs and started reminding him that he was all this family had left and if he didn’t make an effort he wouldn’t amount to anything, and he had survived the first half year, so he would survive the last one too.
“Then why can’t he stay at one of those?” says Ron. “Why does he have to come
. Harry was slightly out of breath. His legs were heavy and each step took effort – this was the lowest floor of Azkaban and somehow it felt like all the rest of the tower’s weight was pressing down on them, as if they were deep under water. It was like running in a fever dream, limbs weighed down by lead. They had no way to watch the time, but they were supposed to
Draco was well past tipsy and on his way towards solid drunkenness when Tracey asked when they were planning on heading to the pub. Draco looked surprised from her to Pansy.
"Sure," said Malfoy carefully. "Anyway, I don't think I would be very welcome… you know, considering the role I played. I doubt anyone would be very happy to see me there."
“Muggles, honestly-“
The polite tone had gone from her voice.
“There are snatchers and possibly some of Voldemort’s own people too,” he continues. “Besides there aren’t a lot of purebloods left in Britain, he’s not going to want to kill them even if they’re against him. He seems to… care about Hogwarts. It might be the safest place for them.”
“The parseltongue might have been hard to get around, but a good interview could have framed it better… And seriously, even when I was 10 I could handle public attention better than you did during the triwizard tournament.”
As if to underline his words, the wind hammered another loud round of raindrops against the windows. Harry was trying to think of something to say that wasn’t a string of curses, but having a civil conversation with Malfoy was quite possibly the most frustrating thing he had ever done. He had agreed to meet him only because the invitation had seemed like a big concession on Malfoy’s part and he thought he ought to be cooperative in return, at least to some extent. And then, Malfoy had been an arsehole when they talked in the owlery, but he had also seemed honest. Something about that talk, or fight or whatever it was, had felt like – not a solution, but it felt like
“I’d found a boggart in this old Defence against the dark arts-classroom down in the dungeons,” he said.
He turned to Hermione.
“You didn’t do anything wrong last night.”
, or like a really big radius. And then you wrote down somewhere that Azkaban wasn’t built by anyone, or we don’t know who built it, it was just found a really long time ago. And
“You’ll be fine.”
“Can’t, I have to study. We have a test coming up in Charms.”
“I’m with Seamus,” said Dean.
“So, what, we’re risking life and limb to save the Malfoy’s kid? Out of all the kids we could be helping? His parents made a choice,
Malfoy cleared his throat.
“So you’re sure you’re okay?”
The rest of the students filed out of the classroom as Draco walked to McGonagall’s desk. There were only a few curious glances.
He closed his eyes for a second. Alright. He had been here before. He could do this. Slowly, he pushed himself upright and swung his feet onto the floor. He swallowed hard, waited for the pounding in his head to subside. Then he pulled the drawer in his bedside table open. He should really clean it out, it was full of all sorts of detritus he had no idea where had even come from - there were a couple of official-looking letters, broken quills and dried out ink-wells, a pair of socks for some reason, and in between all the mess, a handful of phials, each about the size of his finger. All of them unsealed and empty with only a hint of purple residue left clinging to the inside of the glass. Harry swore under his breath. He fumbled around in there for a second before he gave up and pulled the whole drawer out, dumping its contents on the floor. There was a heavy clonk as the ceremonial silver pocket watch from the Ministry hit the floor. The empty phials clattered out as well, and a single, still-full one rolled over the floor. Harry snatched it up before it could disappear under the bed. He peeled off the seal and emptied the potion into his mouth, swallowed and then leaned forward on his knees and waited. There was a pleasant, burning sensation in his throat. It tingled along the back of his neck, over his scalp. Slowly, the fog over his mind lifted. His headache settled down. His nausea melted away. His stomach growled. He hadn't even noticed how hungry he was. And thirsty too. Hangover potions didn't fix the dehydration. His neck still ached from how he'd been sleeping on it funny, but there wasn't much he could do about that. He got up, pulled some fairly clean-looking clothes from the pile on the floor and headed for the bathroom.
Sometimes he wondered if she was actually this weird or if she just enjoyed making people uncomfortable.
Then he noticed the light ahead of them. It spilled down the top of the stairs, not the flickering, orange light from the torches, but the silver glow of patronuses. None of them said anything, but they sped up.
“Something like that,” Harry choked out.
“Hermione is hurt. She got burned by fiendfyre, I think it might have gotten in her throat, or she was too close when it exploded, she can’t breathe properly, I don’t have time to explain how-“
“Do you know where?”
“It’s a difficult spell. It takes time…”
“Look, you don’t have to worry, this is the most discreet table in here. Unless people actually come over they won’t hear us and we can’t be seen either,” said Malfoy.
Hermione shook her head.
"See," he said, "you're pathetic all the time, no one is going to notice the difference!"
“Ginny? She was a bit weirded out, I think. “
Potter opened his eyes again, looking up at Draco with his head turned so his cheek was pressed to the backrest and his glasses were pushed askew. The T-shirt had slid down a bit and Draco could see the shape of his collar-bones.
“I thought – I was hoping maybe it hadn’t been made by wizards,” said Granger quietly.
Otiz sensing this came out from under the table and turned into his human form, making Minerva change back.
"I know brother"
"I think it's time we went to Professor McGonagall about all of this and let her decide what to do with all of this evidence" and she gathered up all of the material and headed back out only to be met by over half of the Gryffindor's all wanting to go along.
But Madam Pomfrey didn’t ask any questions. She pushed Harry aside, and was already rolling up her sleeves and pulling out her wand as she hurried towards Ron and Hermione. She flicked her wand and the lights in the hospital came on. At the other end of the room, a locked cabinet sprang open, and an army of bottles, jars and vials zoomed to the table by the bed where Hermione lay. The tiny, old witch had cast three spells before she even reached the bed, and already the wheezing of Hermione’s breathing had eased. Ron jumped out of her way and Pomfrey grabbed a vial from the table.
”. And this person is calling it “
“Yeah, maybe…” Harry said.
“What are you doing?” asked Harry.
. I don't know what I was thinking, it looked alright from the outside, but the beer was terrible and the place was filthy, I don't know what he must be thinking of me…"
Until they tell him he’s being moved again. To the Weasley family home. Where Potter is currently staying.
“Don’t be an arsehole, Potter.”
“Fine, she takes it back, whatever. Piss off,” said a skinny boy, who seemed to have finally found his voice.
There was definitely a blush. Malfoy's ears were getting pink too – what the hell had he done to get that number?
“I know, I can’t believe it either.”
When he was finally done, he felt completely drained. His feet were sore from standing up that long and it felt like he hadn't slept in a year just from keeping himself together. He dragged himself to the underground, wishing for the thousandth time that there were fewer restrictions on apparition in London. It was ridiculous how deep his gratitude was when he was lucky enough to get a seat on the train. He sank back, stared emptily ahead of him as the train shot through the tunnels hollowing the ground beneath London.
“He’s on the next floor.”
Harry cringed. For a second he had almost forgotten why he was there in the first place. It suddenly didn't seem like such a smart decision to go hang out with Malfoy because he hadn't wanted to deal with Ron and Hermione's concern about his pathetic drunken self when Malfoy was the one who had witnessed said patheticness.
Harry had dealt with the memories of the previous year by pretending that none of it had really happened, and since nobody else knew anything about it and he hadn’t talked about it at all, he had reached a point where most of the time he could almost believe it. Or at least he could believe that they were entirely past it, that it didn’t matter anymore. And then Malfoy kisses him, and it’s like a dam in his mind being knocked over, pent up sensory memories flooding him. He had forgotten what Malfoy smelled like. He had forgotten how soft his hair felt. He had forgotten how
They all nodded in agreement and then Pansy and Draco walked away from the others as the groups spread out. He pulled his wand out and they took up position. He had had practice duels with Pansy before, and a few real ones when their fights had gotten out of hand. Draco almost always won; Pansy was smart, but her magic wasn’t very powerful and she struggled with many spells that came easily to him. She smirked at him, glancing at the others like she thought it was all a bit silly.
There was the soft press of a hand on his shoulder and he flinched.
“You don’t know anything, Malfoy.”
Over a deserted stretch of the East coast of Great Britain, seagulls circled like flecks of ash against the white and colourless December sky. A small house was cowering on top of the dunes, balancing precariously on the edge of a hill that was slowly being eaten away by the sea below. Draco and his mother were making their way towards it. Their black cloaks whipped around them as if the wind was trying to hold on to them and drag them away from the shore.
Harry looked up at him.
He didn't mean to sound petulant - they had had a good time, if the others wanted to go to a pub, of course they should. Pansy rolled her at eyes at him.
Draco did not return to Hogwarts when school started. His mother wrote the headmistress, telling her that Draco was sick and would stay at home until he felt better. He had packed and unpacked several times. He would be seized by a strong urge to leave the house as soon as possible and throw all of his stuff into a suitcase, ready to apparate by himself immediately, but then he reached the door of his room and he changed his mind. Unpacked everything again.
Harry tried not to look shocked.
"We're going out?" he asked.
Draco slumped into the soft couch and eyed the stacks of books on the table. They had been through all of them by now. Nothing but disappointment. He sighed and leaned forward to pick one of them up. That was when he noticed the note. It was a piece of parchment on top of one of the stacks and under it, he saw now, was a thin, black book he had not seen before. His heartbeat picked up as he took the note and the book. The note was addressed to him in what he had come to recognize as Granger’s orderly handwriting. It had his name at the top and then
“I think he’s a little better this year,” said Harry.
The otter patronus lay nestled against her side, fuzzy at the edges, mostly see-through, but it was still there, so she had to be conscious. She had to be alive.
Granger looked at her watch. Then she frowned.
Malfoy raised his glass and Harry mimicked him half-heartedly. He figured it was safe to drink when he had seen Aberforth pour it, but it smelled stronger than any alcohol he had tried before so he only dared a small sip. It was awful, sharp and bitter and burning, it was like having his taste buds wrenched apart and he swallowed so quickly he had to suppress a cough, though when he was done choking on it, the whisky did leave a pleasant burning sensation spreading down his throat.
“Yeah well, things change,” he said.
“Yes.”
He had known from the start that this was a suicide mission, but only vaguely, as an abstract concept, scenarios he could imagine, but didn’t believe in.
“Oh yeah? You didn’t fight back either, did you? I’ll call you whatever I want.”
"What were you going to say?"
“Do you know how his family is handling the new… political situation?”
Harry glances around the room. They’re standing by the door, which Draco is still holding open, but now more like he has forgotten about it than as if he expects Harry to leave.
Harry pulled his chair out and sat back down.
She nodded.
They walked across the grounds towards the gate; down the gravel path the same way they had four days earlier. Neville looked back towards the castle.
As soon as they left, Maya covered her face with her hands and her shoulders were shaking with laughter.
"What?"
She yawned.
Draco was about to tell him that yes, of course he did, they had been taught in school, but of course
for talking to him.
“I don’t know. I’m not sure.”
“We’re going to die,” said Draco weakly.
The engine awoke and they felt the train shuddering to life.
“Why? You should.”
“The thing about rushing in head first, that really goes for Ron and Ginny too…”
“That would kill the prisoners.”
Harry stepped closer, because there was something flighty about Malfoy’s manner now, like he might turn and run any second. And it wasn’t like he would try to hold him back if he did, he just wanted to… be within reach. He opened his mouth to speak, but lost the words before he could say them. He breathed out heavily, felt his pulse hammer out another second.
Lovegood took it and went to sit down on the couch. Draco followed her example and claimed one of the chairs. Only Granger remained standing and watched as Lovegood flicked the book open and looked at the title page.
He swallowed again.
“Don’t you think you could at least keep it to when you’re by yourself?” Ron continued.
Ginny rolled her eyes.
They tumbled onto the pavement in a poorly lit residential neighbourhood, and Draco barely remained standing as Potter crashed into him with his full weight.
“I wasn’t trying to kill you,” Harry says. “Back in sixth year. I told you. I didn’t know what the spell did.”
“Why do you keep checking your watch?” asked Hermione. “Are you going somewhere?”
"I don't know. How long has it been?"
“No, I just bought it for you. You said it yourself that you didn’t know me and that lots of things have changed. Well, I can’t say I know you very well either.”
The hard part of legilimency was getting into someone’s head and staying there long enough to find what you were looking for before their mind pushed you out. This mind wasn’t trying to push him out, and so instead of a slow crawl dragging through memories that clung like spider webs, the images rushed by like streaming water, too fast and too chaotically for him to make out anything but glimpses in the rush, too fast for him to tell them from each other, and he strained to hold on to that sensation of his own body far away, trying to stay tethered even as he felt himself slipping away between glimpses of someone else’s past.
Potter lurched forward and grabbed his arm. Draco stopped and turned around to look at him. Potter didn’t let go.
Ginny pointed angrily at Parkinson.
Hermione ran a hand over her face.
“I wouldn’t do that,” he said.
“See you Monday, Potter,” he said.
“But you’re not congratulating me.”
“We thought it might be nice.”
"Merlin, no. Did you actually think we were?"
Intellectually, he knows this is better. At least he won’t be asked to kill anyone any time soon, and he won’t have to watch people being killed for sport, but most of the time it doesn’t feel better. And maybe there is just a tiny hint of bitterness, just a sliver of disappointment. Maybe he has also allowed himself to hope that some of the self-hatred will go away when he’s made the right choice. And of course, it isn’t like that when you make that choice too late.
“Oh, is that what this is?” said Hermione. “You two are fighting again?”
There was a breathy sound from Malfoy's end, either a laugh or a sigh.
“I don’t know.”
Move on. That was what he wanted to say. That was what he was trying to do. And he supposed it was nice that Malfoy wanted to apologize, it was just that Harry had no desire to be there for it. It wasn’t like it was Harry’s job to absolve him of anything. And if Malfoy wanted to apologize, Harry was pretty sure that
Instead, he goes down there every meal, gets a plate of food and returns to his room. He doesn’t skip meals, because when he does, some Weasley kid inevitably appears sooner or later with a hateful look and a plate for him, and that’s actually worse.
“You can apparate to a place you haven’t been.”
Draco didn’t say anything. He unfolded his hands, stretched his fingers.
They had all expected it to be big news. They had expected these tense days of pretending they knew as little about the events as everyone else. Draco had expected the sideways glances from everyone who looked at him and thought
“Yeah,” Potter said. “I know. I mean, I thought you recognized me, I wasn’t sure.”
“No, I know that! It’s not about him, it’s about – can’t you see what it is you’re doing?”
“Can you get a message to Potter?” he asked it.
“He wouldn’t tell me. He said he had a fight with the other Slytherins.”
Draco watched her wand slide out of her sleeve and into her hand. That was bad, if she wore a forearm holster she probably knew how to duel – she might even have been in Potter’s secret fan club last year.
He left and slammed the door behind him.
They stopped when they were close enough to peer through the windows. There was hardly anyone inside.
“I was thinking about something.”
“What?” he said. “That’s a muggle swear, right?”
“Yes.”
“What?”
“It’s not like anyone’s expecting you to have stuff like that sorted out already. Charlie didn’t figure it out until he was in his seventh year either, and he had a lot less going on than we’ve-“
Maya started laughing again, and the corners of Irie's mouth twitched, which kind of undermined the menacing stare she had been giving him.
“Sure,” he said. “But I’m glad we talked.”
“I should probably… I should head back downstairs.”
Malfoy shrugged.
Harry started and turned around, ready to explain away his presence at the pub, and saw Malfoy sitting by a table in a corner of the room where he hadn’t been visible from the door. Harry hesitated for a second by the counter before he walked over and pulled out a chair. Malfoy smirked at him. Both his hair and his clothes were dry and he looked as pristine as ever.
"Yeah."
“Yes. During the war. I know we never really got along when we were at Hogwarts, and my family was-
He wanted to ask him about politics too. He still wasn’t sure he understood all the implications of what Malfoy had said, at the pub and in the Owlery, and he thought that if he did he might find out why things still weren’t right. But he didn’t really trust his tongue to form an intelligent question, nor his mind to comprehend the answer.
Potter looked annoyed.
Draco felt like he was falling.
He wanted to ask Malfoy about being a Death Eater. And about Hogwarts last year. He wanted to ask if he felt bad about having used the cruciatus curse in class, and if he had used it outside of class too. He wanted to ask why he didn’t care when Bellatrix tortured Hermione – or if he had cared. Mostly he wanted to hear him say that he was sorry for all of it and that he regretted everything, which was why he didn’t ask:  he knew that wasn’t the answer he would get. Hermione had to be right. If Malfoy had still had a conscience, how would he even be able to stand? How could he look at anyone without crumbling from shame? How could he have made himself come back to Hogwarts?
By the time he sat down next to Draco, every student in the hall had noticed him. When Harry reached for the toast, everyone who hadn’t seen it for themselves had been told by their neighbour that the golden trio were sitting with Slytherin.
“Don’t Potter and Weasley help you?”
“What do you want to do?”
“He called last night. On the phone. I don’t know, it was weird.”
“I did. I wouldn’t be able to stay back here not knowing what was happening to all of you, or if something did happen I don’t think I could live with knowing that perhaps I could have prevented it if I had been there.”
“I’ve had good reason to.”
“It does feel a bit like blackmail.”
Seven cracks sounded on the halfway point of the path that led from Hogsmeade station to Hogwarts. The castle ahead of them was still mostly dark, but here and there a square of light was visible.
“So you’ve got a muggle job, and you live in a muggle neighbourhood and go to muggle pubs-“
“Who are you? How did you get this number?” Harry snapped, too sharply, but his nerves didn't know what to do with the information, whether that made the situation better or worse, whether he would still need to run upstairs to wake up Ron and Hermione the second he hung up.
He could have told them, Hermione said. What exactly was it she expected him to tell? He had no idea what was going on with him and Draco. It wasn’t like he had to explain it to anyone.
“I’m sorry about the Slytherins,” he said finally. “I should have told you.”
"Half a year, give or take."
“What are you on about?”
Harry nodded.
for Christmas (and had also bought one for herself, which Harry thought was a bit excessive, considering the three of them lived together). It had later turned out almost all of their friends had been given the same book, and when confronted with this Hermione had shrugged and explained how she had realized that one of the fundamental reasons for the enslavement of house elves was that adult witches and wizards were completely helpless when it came to taking care of themselves and that this was really at the root of the problem, and also “the kind of thing you can't get at through legislation”. Ron had pretended to be horrified and asked her if she seriously thought they had been conspiring to acquire a house elf behind her back. But the book had turned out to be quite useful, and having several copies wasn’t entirely pointless either, as the books lived rough lives and didn’t survive long. Harry’s copy had long ago succumbed to a botched dishwashing spell and Ron’s, though still readable, had been burned quite badly.
“You know, we probably shouldn’t tell people about this,” he said. “If you don’t mind.”
He turned his gaze to the floor when they passed them, but he thought he could feel McGonagall’s eyes boring into him.
"Oh. Wow, okay then." He grimaced. "That's more than I ever wanted to know about your relationship."
He passed Harry the bottle. They were a good way through it. Harry didn’t know how much was necessary to get drunk. Probably less than this.
Draco nodded.
“Help me,” she said, so quietly he might have been imagining it.
Draco continued as if he hadn’t heard him.
“I do. Now get up.”
"I'm buying drinks," he said coolly.
He rubbed the sore spot on his leg.
His speech was getting more and more stilted, going from regular posh to something that sounded actually prewritten and rehearsed.
“You’re what? Snogging?” Ron suggested with a grin.
Malfoy groaned.
“Sirius was in Azkaban for twelve years,” he said.
“Pansy, I'm kind of tired," he interrupted. "Did you want something, or did you call me just to complain about calling me?”
He pulled out his wand and then glanced at Harry.
He lingered behind while Granger went up to Madam Pince, but when he came out of the library, she was waiting for him in the corridor.
“I was in love with you, you moron!” Draco snarls and everything inside Harry goes still.
"Where are we going?" Malfoy asked.
difficult than it’s supposed to be.”
possibly even
She turned to Ronald, who was sitting on the couch next to Lovegood and hadn’t said much during the meeting.
“So don’t try to tell me about all the choices I had,” Draco continued. “When I realized I might want to get out, it wasn’t an option anymore.”
, and despite having seen him in his muggle clothes and his muggle flat, Harry still hadn't really believed that he actually lived like this. It was so far removed from everything he knew about him, and he couldn't understand
“Are you pals with him too now?”
“I just thought I should tell you that this doesn’t change anything,” she said as soon as he stepped out.
Draco smirked.
He kept his eyes fixed on the wall. He was so aware of Potter’s presence it was like a physical touch against his side.
“What did you say?” asked Ginny icily.
Malfoy shrugged.
They both nodded.
“What, they time when they have their kids?”
The demonic fire still burned nothing but her magic, but its eyes were on the three of them, not on the slumped and shrivelled figure ahead, and Draco could sense the single minded sentience behind them, the desire to consume him and everything else in this dungeon that would burn. Granger flicked her wand again, like a whip, and slowly the creature turned away and walked – surged – ruptured – towards the undead wizard.
She smiled at him and left. Harry looked down at his atomized shepherd’s pie. Luna was probably right about how talking to people helped, but he wasn’t sure talking to her had really cleared anything up. In fact, he decided, he still had absolutely no clue what was going on. And he wasn’t very keen on talking to Malfoy about it.
Harry took a deep breath before he pushed the door open and went in. He dropped into the empty seat next to Ron.
he could just have asked his friend to step down, but Blaise didn’t listen to him anymore and definitely wouldn’t take orders. So Draco kept his mouth shut and watched.
it is, then. Mystery solved.”
“I can’t. I mean… He got angry about the handholding. At first he didn’t seem to mind, but then suddenly he was all in a twist and was about to leave, so I grabbed him, because I wanted to know what he was angry about, right? And then-”
She nodded. There was a quiet scrape and clink of metal.
“What?” he said.
“Anyone know what time it is?” asked Pansy.
“Bad news,” he said.
“You heard what he said about his father; he practically considers him dead. He didn’t even want to go in the first place, he told me that
“Now?”
Luna fiddled with the turquoise glass pendant dangling from her left earring.
Draco woke when the first daylight filtered through the window. The sharp contours of the room came into focus in the cold, hard colours of winter mornings. Every joint in his body ached. His legs were stiff. His right shoulder felt numb. Potter’s arm lay limply across him. Draco pushed it off and sat up slowly, moving like a hundred-year-old man with brittle bones. He groaned. Potter made some muffled noise. Draco looked down at him.
“Yes,” said Draco firmly.
“You mean… you want me to come meet you now?"
Draco scoffed.
“I’m so sorry.”
There was another long moment of no words from Malfoy. The line crackled. He could still hear him breathing.
“I know.”
"Whisky?" said Daphne.
Harry had braced himself for some level of surprise on Malfoy's part when he showed up here unannounced. He had lined up arguments in his head, or excuses, though to be fair they had vanished the second Malfoy's voice came out the entryphone. Anyway, they wouldn't have helped him. He hadn't exactly expected his method of transportation to be the thing Malfoy would have issues with.
! We were surviving. You said that, remember? And we had to be there for each other because no one else would. Our parents wouldn’t, the teachers wouldn’t, the Dark Lord wouldn’t and neither would Potter’s people. And I know we didn’t think it was going to be like this, but wasn’t that the whole fucking point, that even if the others couldn’t, the rest of Slytherin, you and I would still have each other’s backs?”
,” he said.
“Yes, very unfortunate indeed. But he’s a bright boy, I’m sure he’ll catch up in no time.”
Draco’s heart was still hammering away, for some reason his confusion felt like disappointment.
Potter didn’t sound close to sleep at all.
Ron’s face was a grimace of anger and confusion, he opened his mouth to speak, but then someone coughed. Harry turned around and saw Hermione coming up the stairs. A moment later, Ron pushed past him, running down the gallery and pulling her into a hug as soon as he reached her. She winced from the touch and he immediately released her.
Eventually, he would have to go back in there. He had two hours left before he could go home. He swallowed hard, straightened up and pulled the pack of cigarettes from his pocket. His fingers were shaking.
They had not anticipated the outrage.
said I was overreacting.”
She stepped back out the door and closed it behind her. There was a fraction of a second where he thought of rushing after her, but if he left now, Harry might…
“It’s kind of nice to have the DA going again, though,” said Ron.
"I really like your muggle clothes better," he said.
“Come on Malfoy, take out your wand,” called Macmillan. “Maybe you can demonstrate some of the things your auntie Bella taught you? Get yourself sent back to Azkaban where you belong?”
When he finally returned to the common room the house-elves had been there and it was as tidy and proper as the rooms at Malfoy Manor. He found the books he had left earlier in a neat stack on the polished wood of the table by the fire. There were still glowing embers in the fireplace, they were the only source of light in the room, so it took a moment before he noticed that Pansy was half asleep in one of the soft armchairs with an open book in her lap.
“Goodnight, Harry.”
Draco’s gut twists uncomfortably.
“So can I.”
“Did something happen?” asked Ginny.
Draco pushed open the door to his dormitory and found that in his absence, his bedroom had been invaded by half of Slytherin house. Matthew, Nott, Blaise and Daphne were gathered by Blaise’s bed; Pansy, Millicent and Tracey were spread out on Draco’s fourposter, lounging on it as if they owned it.
Malfoy snatched the leaflet out of Harry's hands.
Narcissa stood up. She put one hand on his shoulder, the other one against his cheek, turning his face towards hers. Her rings were cold against his skin.
!” sounded professor Slughorn’s voice, and Potter’s wand was snatched away.
“You all seemed to be getting along pretty well earlier today.”
if I had been in your house.”
Potter shrugged.
Potter looked at him with a puzzled expression, like he wasn’t sure what to make of him.
“I can’t,” he whispered.
Harry turned to him.
," she cut him off with that heavily condescending tone of voice she reserved only for discussions about Draco's current life situation, specifically designed to convey in every syllable how exasperated she was with him. "About half the time we actually talk to each other, it’s because you want to hear my opinion about whether or not some new rumour is true or not. Don't try to lie to me - I mean, you’re free to stay in your state of denial if that's what you want, but please don’t try to convince me you are not still absolutely obsessed with him.”
“And then he turned you down flat,” said Daphne.
“Alright,” she said.
“Detention, Mr. Malfoy. In my office at 9 this evening.”
“Great,” Harry said. “Thanks.”
“No, we don’t.”
“So why-“
While one side gathers at Hogwarts to mourn, the other flocks to Malfoy Manor to celebrate. Draco doesn’t participate and no one notices – he’s not important anymore; it is suddenly painfully clear to him he never was. He roams the empty parts of his house, he feels anxiousness gnawing in his chest as he wonders what he should do next. Technically, he did betray the Dark Lord, and he tries not to think about what would happen to him if all the monsters and murderers in his house were to find out.
He picked up his Firebolt.
She shook her head.
“Did you want something?”
“So was I,” said Harry.
He was already in his dress robes. They would go to claim the body as soon as he came home and then have the funeral immediately after. There would be a memorial service later on where everyone who ought to be invited would be. Today, it was only himself and his mother.
“I mean, it wasn’t
Granger nodded.
“Anything interesting?” asked Pansy, leaning forward to read from across the table.
His palms were sweating. He could feel panic edging in on him. It was a nice offer, a chance to back out before he could fail. But it was too late now. Potter nodded and turned to the wardrobe again.
“It is.”
He blinked at her.
“It’s a good broom.”
Draco found Tracey and Millicent in the common room.
“It is for me,” she repeated quietly. “It won’t go away. It’s just there, all the time. Everything I do and think and worry about. I’m still scared. I’m still going over all the details in my head. I keep making up ways we could have saved people if we‘d done something different, and I hate that. I wish I could stop doing that.”
“It might be,” he said.
They passed Lucius Malfoy’s cell quickly and without notice.
His pulse was hammering. He had been feeling dazed and half sleep ever since he came back, but he didn’t anymore. His thoughts were crystal clear.
Sound didn’t travel far in Azkaban. It wasn’t long before they couldn’t hear him anymore.
“Well we can’t all live in a state of heightened moral understanding, and I know I would be a lot happier with being back at school if I didn’t have to see his face in the hallways.”
“I missed you,” he said against Draco’s lips.
“And George said I can work with him and Lee in the jokeshop, so I already have a job,” said Ron. “But we’ll probably have to stay in a shitty place no matter what.”
Draco picked them up before Potter could hurt himself by attempting such a risky manoeuvre on his own.
“Or that’s what we thought we were doing, I’m not sure. Maybe we were just doing what was the easiest. It seemed to work, though, the little Slytherins became invisible and we became the prime examples of good students to the Carrows. It just sucks now when being a Slytherin is apparently the same as being a Death Eater. Doesn’t make much of a difference for me of course, but for the others…”
“Nah, she doesn’t want us to. I think she finds it distracting when I try to help. I noticed you and Gin have been talking a bit more since this whole thing started.”
“That’s a nice thought, but coming from someone who lived his whole life according to a prophecy and some silly, old man pulling the strings, it sounds a bit hollow, doesn’t it? You waltz around with all your morals and heroic deeds and you might have saved everyone, but you were pushed in that direction. When we were 14, you didn’t make the decision to defy the Dark Lord, even if you think you did. You were Dumbledore’s puppet, and you had all those order members pointing you in that direction, telling you that was the right thing to do, and you believed them, because that’s what kids do: They believe the things adults tell them.”
Malfoy doesn’t die. Harry doesn’t go see him. It’s not the sort of thing you can apologize for. He dreams about it quite a lot, though.
had he gotten a dementor in there? Why hadn’t he warned him? He couldn’t recall the words of the incantation – he couldn’t even yell at Potter; his voice was stuck in his throat. His fingers trembled. The classroom was disappearing before him, he felt the darkness spreading behind his eyes, the clammy grip on his mind. He saw the cells, the corpses, the pit-
And it was true, some of them had. Such as Draco Malfoy. Harry could see him sitting among the other seventh years. He had known for a while that he hadn’t been imprisoned, but he still hadn’t expected him to be back at Hogwarts, and definitely hadn’t been prepared to run into him on the train.
"Try telling Hermione that."
The Ministry had only sent one employee to deal with the transgression, and it didn't take long to get rid of him.
“And I want them to forget about that as well.”
“I don’t know how the hell you figured it out,” Draco said. “But I’m ignoring it until it goes away and I suggest you do the same. Azkaban is what’s important, I’m not letting this interfere with it, okay?”
"I've… got some wine back at my place?" Malfoy said.
“Right,” said Potter. “But I’m not bloody Pansy Parkinson. What is wrong with you? You’re a
“Of course not, Harry never realizes when he’s being an idiot,” she said, and Draco breathed a secret sigh of relief.
“Why did you leave, mate?”
He transfigured a cushion in one of the armchairs into a cup and back again. Into a mirror and back again. He had, for a moment, forgotten about his patronus messenger, and so he started violently when he heard the click of the door being opened. Potter slipped through and closed it quietly behind him, and for a second Draco was lost as to why he was there. Potter looked rumpled and tired, so maybe Draco had woken him up after all. He wasn’t wearing robes or any of his school uniform, just a T-shirt and a pair of very muggle-looking pants. His hair was even more of a mess than usual. Draco’s heart convulsed happily.
Hermione shook her head.
“What?”
“Before we leave without him.”
“Sorry. I didn’t know what to say to you. And I messed up badly when I tried talking to him.”
Ron was still looking at her warily, as if her skin might start bubbling again any moment. She took a deep breath and swung her legs out of the bed.
“Alright, everyone brought chocolate?”
Daphne shot a confused look at Blaise.
He could still just leave. No one had noticed him yet, no one would stop him from simply slipping back out the portal-
"Fuck," Harry breathed.
Even if the git had actually gotten it into his head to start a fight, it didn't look like he would pose much of a problem in that condition. Potter steadied himself with a hand against the wall.
of mind-numbingly tedious Potter speculations from you, and now that something interesting has actually happened, you don't want to share it? I
Potter finally turned his head, squinting at Draco through his smudgy glasses.
“Potter,” he said, holding out his hand.
“First off,” continued Granger. “I think we should discuss the option of a political solution to this. If there is any possibility at all of getting legislation passed to remove the dementors, then that’s definitely better than turning this into some dangerous, illegal mission. We have to at least consider the option that we don’t have to do this all by ourselves.”
"You're wearing robes."
“Sorry, sorry! Calm down, I was just-“
Nott shrugged.
He interrupted himself and groaned, hiding his face in his hands. Luna was still watching him curiously when he looked up.
“We’re too slow,” she said.
Madam Pomfrey’s face grew vacant. For a moment, she stood very still. Then she blinked slowly and looked around, as if she had just woken up in an unfamiliar place.
Draco hesitated by the phone for a moment. He considered calling her back and telling her he wasn't coming. He didn't care about Blaise's fragile ego, she could tell them he was sick and they could choose to believe that or not. But despite Pansy's flair for drama, there was a chance she was actually genuinely upset with him for not being there. It had been nearly a month since he last saw her, which was bad even by their current standards. He left the phone where it was and went to change into robes.
"Could have done that half a year ago too."
He moved. Granger passed them, eyes glued to her watch.
Longbottom had managed to cast a disarming spell from where he had fallen and now he was getting up to hand the wand back to Lovegood. Draco could see them stopping to talk before they split up again to start over. Pansy nudged him and he looked over at her, then followed her gaze to where Granger and Ginny were duelling – and that was a fearsome thing to watch. Granger seemed able to cast non-verbal spells just as easily as verbal ones, and even though it was hard to make out the details of her movement in the dark, the intricate wandwork was enough to tell them that she wasn’t using simple spells. There were only seconds between the sharp flashes of light, glimmers of shielding charms going up and cascades of sparks when the attacks were deflected. However, despite her advanced spells, it was clear that Granger was loosing. Ginny was ferocious, her spells fast and powerful, and there was a certainty to her movements that made it obvious who was the better duellist of the two. Draco and Pansy had only been watching them for a couple of seconds when Granger reacted too slowly to a close succession of spells from Weasley – she deflected the first one, but the second one caught her, and it must have been an
“I don’t see why not.”
"Talking to you, apparently."
it, but I can't imagine you enjoy it. You didn't manage to go through one year of school without
“I hate you.”
"Why couldn't you do that over the phone?"
Potter turned around to look at him.
," he snapped, looking horrified at Potter. "What were you- did you honestly think- bloody hell, Potter, Pansy and I aren't together!"
Over the next couple of days, it turned out that significant looks were going to be a continuing thing. Draco supposed it was the uncertainty as to how they were supposed to act towards each other that caused this tense awareness of the other person. He was even beginning to feel that they ought to say hi to each other in the corridors, that the long eye contact or self-conscious avoidance of eye contact was getting awkward.
Draco felt flinch in his own mind.
From the way Blaise and Nott were looking at him, he thought it probably didn’t.
"You don't have to stay hovering in my kitchen, you know," he said, glancing back at Harry. "You can sit down, I won't hex you."
Hermione leaned heavily on Harry, he felt her trying to shift her weight away from him, but her legs and feet were unsteady and he had to catch her from falling. He could hear Draco right behind him, breathing over his shoulder. They were moving ever so slowly back through the dementors. They kept close to his patronus, but where before the spell had meant that the dementors shied away from them as they made their way through, the stag now had to jostle them out of the way with it’s antlers, and from all sides they pressed towards them, desperate, starved mouths open, the ones in the front pushed closer by the hundreds behind them. They crowded against the shield, sucking in the white light. This deep in Azkaban, even two corporeal patronuses wasn’t enough to keep them out entirely and Harry could feel their effect seeping into him. He thought he could make out the light from Hermione’s tracking spell on a distant wall and he kept his eyes on that when he could, and when it disappeared from view, he just hoped the patronus was leading them in the right direction.
Malfoy huffed.
trying to off you, I imagine peace and quiet has left you bored half to death. What have you even been doing since you left the aurors?"
“I wanted to give you the opportunity to start seeing a
He reached for the Shepherd’s pie even though he wasn’t hungry.
She nodded slowly.
“I should have told you what?”
Draco had claimed the armchair by the fireplace in the elegant Slytherin common room and was flipping through the
“I wouldn’t want to ruin your birthday party.”
“Yes, I’m sorry about that too. And I’ve stopped using that word anyway.”
She raised an eyebrow, looking unimpressed.
Weasley nodded. Something about the exchange felt familiar to Draco, though at first he couldn’t figure out why. Then he realized that they reminded him of the aurors at Azkaban. The way Longbottom reflexively cast the protection spells, the way Ginevra checked with him, not because she doubted his judgement, but because that was their routine. They had all aged so much in the last year.
“Some part of him did, Draco. He hadn’t been given the dementor's kiss, he was still in there, he was just… very far away.”
There was a beat of silence. Draco stiffened.
“I suppose,” he said, then added: “If you don’t think Granger is right, you should tell her.”
“I know, but it’s a pretty recent decision.”
Draco doesn’t kiss him this time. Harry leans his head back and closes his eyes when Draco reaches for his belt. His hand stings. After a while he tells Draco to stop and they both leave.
Malfoy stepped away from Harry, out of reach, and a jolt of panic shot through him. He didn’t want to leave. Leaving felt very final all of a sudden, as if what had happened might be something that was confined to this room and would vanish as soon as they closed the door behind them.
Irie shrugged.
“Do you think it would work? You think blowing it up would make whatever it is, the evil, go away too?”
Hermione nodded.
“Actually, I’m meeting with Malfoy,” he said.
“I just don’t want her to wait for me,” he says. “I don’t know when I’ll come back, I don’t even know
He said it very matter-of-factly.
“He wasn’t talking about your father.”
Draco looked up at Potter, who still stood by the wardrobe, watching him.
“Sorry,” she said quietly. “I just need the garden scissors from that table behind you.”
Draco’s voice disappeared in his mouth. There was another too long silence before Potter said:
“Yeah, actually, speaking of that,” Harry said, straightening in his chair. “What was that all about?”
"Of course it did."
He cast a look around the group.
She raised herself up on one elbow to look at him.
“Damn right he’s a git, was there ever any doubt about that?” asked Ron.
terms of what a truce would entail – what I have in mind could be something entirely different.”
“And I take back what I said earlier, this is so much worse than sixth year. At least murdering Albus Dumbledore was almost within the range of something that might have been possible under drastically different circumstances. This is just dumb.”
“Went to put the brooms back,” said Neville.
Harry looked from one to the other. He suddenly had to fight very hard not to turn around in his seat to get another look at Mark.
"I don't know. I guess… Do you think I should give it back to him?"
And then Potter turned from the stairs and reached for him again, touching Draco's shoulder lightly.
“But that’s not good enough! It can’t exist, it shouldn’t even exist one more day, and what you’re talking about would take years, and by then someone who isn’t Shacklebolt will be Minister for Magic and it’ll never happen!”
Harry strode briskly across the front yard of Grimmauld Place and into the street. He had forgotten to grab his scarf and the air was cold around his neck. He was being stupid, he knew that. He just didn't care very much right then. In the time since he had quit the aurors, memories of Sirius popped into Harry's mind more and more often. How everyone had been telling him to stay inside, stay hidden, not to be stupid. Grimmauld Place wasn't the same oppressive, musty monument to old pureblood traditions that it had been back when the Order used it, and besides, Harry was free to leave the house whenever he wanted, but there were days he spent pacing the old hallways, feeling like he was going crazy with doing nothing, where he couldn't help but think that this must have been how Sirius had felt in the last months he was alive. The house was huge, but it still made him feel trapped. And sometimes, like today, that feeling only got worse because Ron and Hermione were in there with him, with their concern and all the subjects they carefully avoided right until they didn't.
Longbottom handed it to him and he left.
Weasley squirmed.
They ended up in Ginny’s room, where Luna claimed the record player and refused to give it up for the rest of the night. They passed bottles of ginger and strawberry mead around. There wasn’t a lot of room for dancing, but that only meant the party felt bigger than it actually was. Hermione had brought some of her parent’s old records with her and Luna quickly abandoned all wizards’ music for muggle music from the 70’s and 80’s. She traced the lightning bolt over David Bowie’s face with her fingers and grinned at Harry. It was hard to tell if she was drunk or not, but she had claimed one of the bottles for herself and was gingerly sipping it while she watched them, bobbing her head to the music. The rest of them were slowly but steadily getting pissed. At one point Ginny and Hermione collapsed on the bed laughing hysterically, and no one could figure out what the joke was, since they didn’t have the breath to explain. Ron pulled Hermione back to her feet and they were dancing again. Ginny grabbed Harry’s hand, still grinning. He was vaguely aware that he was probably a terrible dancer, but Neville was too and it couldn’t have mattered less.
“Are you sure you want to do this?” he asked.
“Do you think he fancies you?”
“Can I come in?” Harry asks.
Harry felt a hand on his arm.
She observed him calmly. He knew he was being rude, but nothing in the professor’s face revealed that she was bothered by it or had even noticed.
“We should probably go find a compartment before they all get too crowded,” he said.
“Sorry about the Malfoy thing.”
Harry took another step into the opening. His patronus was quite a way ahead of him. Then, without even a flicker of warning, it winked out and an icy fist smashed through Draco’s mind, he felt himself falling as the hallway and the prison was swallowed by a vision of the polished floor of the Manor, of his father screaming and writhing with limbs twisting in odd directions, the sound of high pitched laughter ringing in Draco’s ears and his mother’s frantic voice: “
The voice was so quiet it almost wasn’t there. Draco opened his eyes. He had already been mostly asleep.
He glanced at Granger, but she looked just as confused as he was.
She was frowning, but nodded to herself when he finished.
”Be serious for a moment,” she said.
Potter started and straightened up when he saw him.
“So we managed to survive that too,” she said.
"Already tried that, actually. It isn't very fun."
“Alright,” he breathed.
Harry gaped at him.
“I don’t know!”
"I'm fine. It wasn't… It wasn't exactly what I hoped for, but I got to say what I wanted. It's over."
“We have to burn him. Fiendfyre,” he said tensely.
Malfoy screamed.
. There had been some unpleasant encounters during his first days in the muggle world with store assistants who had kept repeating to him that his stupid, tight and uncomfortable trousers were
"Yeah, well…"
It took a second before she remembered to ask him.
"You're still alive, then?" he said.
They started down the stairs.
Blaise laughed.
"What are you doing here, Malfoy?" Potter asked - accusatory, as always, and Draco's jaw tightened.
to write about that he didn’t have to worry too much about gossip about him, but he would still prefer to avoid even the risk of a Skeeter-like article with a headline involving “the snake and the lion” or some other ridiculous thing like that.
They continued their ascend in near darkness. Harry kept turning his head, listening for rattling breath, braced for another assault on his mind, but he didn’t see anything and all he could hear was the scuffling of Draco’s uncertain feet and Hermione’s laboured breathing.
“They’re cheap, I can go get another one if you want?“
“I’ll talk to her.”
“Please,” she said. “Tell them it was an accident. It won’t happen again.”
Draco was one of the first students to come down for breakfast. He sat down at the empty Slytherin table and poured himself a cup of coffee. While he drank it, he watched the seats around him and at the other tables fill up. He kept an eye on the doors and watched who showed up. Sometimes he would check the seats at the Gryffindor table, just in case he had missed them.
“Fifth years don’t sleep, apparently.”
“What’s this about, Draco? Do you want me to come?”
was doing it?” he asks, voice thick with disbelief, but the truth is, it didn’t.
He paused, waiting for Draco to protest, but Draco didn’t say anything.
Granger looked from Harry to Draco, then shrugged.
“They didn’t tell me anything they just…”
Harry watched as the old man filled two more glasses at the counter and then headed over to his and Malfoy’s corner with them.
“Right,” said Harry and cast another glance around the inn.
“Look, shouldn’t we at least talk about the possibility that he might be lying to us?,” said Ron. “How do we even know that he went to Azkaban?”
“Did you win?”
“Potter hates you,” Matthew added.
Of course, Draco doesn’t know that, he wasn’t there. It’s just a coincidence. A deeply fucked up coincidence that makes Harry want to scream or put his fist through a wall or just get the fuck out of there and never look back.
"Oh, right," he said, stiffening visibly. "Of course."
"Just told them you were coming," Malfoy said.
As soon as he was outside, he turned down the street outside and started walking. He wasn't sure where he was going.
“Spare me. I’ve heard your whole little spiel before.”
“I…” Malfoy cleared his throat. “Well, I was wondering if… perhaps you might meet with me. Maybe over a drink.”
“And then, in case we do end up having to go there ourselves, Harry should probably start teaching Malfoy and Parkinson how to cast the patronus charm.”
Draco Malfoy stood just to the right of the iron archway over the entrance from King’s Cross. He was watching the scene with an uncomfortable sense of having stepped into an old memory. Being back at the station for the beginning of a new school year felt more like sinking into a Pensieve than a real experience. It was like watching the past unfold before him in real time; he was a visitor displaced from a different point in history. Except, of course, that he didn’t feel invisible or anything even close to it. Draco was acutely aware of his own spine, of his hands and how he had nothing useful to do with them. His robes were impeccable, he had spent thirty minutes spelling them creaseless that morning, but he still had to stop himself from running his hands over the fabric to straighten it out. He knew he was only imagining the itch on his left arm, but that didn’t make it any easier to keep himself from scratching it. He hadn’t been around this many people since the end of term and now it felt like his senses and his brain were being assaulted by too many impressions to take in. He had been holed up by himself in his room in the manor between and after the trials, trying to pull himself back together, trying not to think about what he would do with himself now that it was all over. Then he had received the letter that called them all back to retake their seventh year. His first reaction had been relief over getting one more year before he had to make any real decisions. Then he had realized what it meant – that it wasn’t just him; the rest of his year would be returning with him. He didn’t look forward to seeing any of them again.
"You are! Look at yourself right now and tell me you aren't!"
"Harry, Harry it's time to get up" said Severus as he tried to wake the boy but said boy just hugged harder and nuzzled into his side more. Severus just smiled at him and slowly tried to get out of the tight hold on his waist.
"His name is Harry James Potter, not this Hadrian" interrupted Sirius.
She hung her head and sighed, she knew she wouldn't get away with it now, everything was there in front of her.
She sighed and took a calming breath and sighed a little, a house elf brought in some tea for Severus and Minerva while they brought pumpkin juice for the boys and a bowl of blood for Otiz.
.........
"Thank you Mink, could I also get some raw meat please" asked Otiz to the elf and he nodded and disappeared and reappeared quickly.
"I warned you stay away from him" and he growled throwing her.
If it wasn't for his father young Mister Snape would have been killed but his ex relatives it had taken Madam Pomfrey weeks to get the boy healed throughout his life if young my client Mister Snape was at at the receiving end of the abuse he was given by said ex relatives.
These only stopped when they finally were able to leave on the 28th of June and they would be back on the 11th July, two whole weeks away.
"Have a drink little one and you'll feel better. You missed out on dinner last night, you slept right through it" and he handed over the cup to the little boy, who was still snifflering.
"He needed to hear the truth and as the saying goes...... the truth hurts.... and it does and I hope in due time both of them will come to an understanding of each other".
"Sir who do you mean? Otiz or me?" asked Harry to the teacher as now Otiz was doing the spell without his wand.
"Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape!!!" yelled Severus to his son who was laughing loudly while laying down on the bed holding his stomach while also holding onto Otiz.
Albus was fuming but didn't let it show, how could a thing like that be allowed in this Honourable School!! He would have to get rid of it and fast.
"Oh oh can I tell, pretty please?" said otiz only to get look of Harry to say 'whats going on'
Severus then let another five drops of blood onto the middle parchment and again it flowed and writing started to appear and that gave all his vaults which was another twelve mind you two of them belonged to Severus but still... twelve vaults!
Afterwards it as time for presents, Harry was apprehensive about the whole thing but was happy enough, Otiz was almost calm but not calm enough for Severus' liking but it would do for now.
Arthur was waiting outside for them as they came in, he brought them into the office that was being used for this whole thing, Cornelius was waiting for them.
"I forgot that you can also understand that language" said Severus as he ruffled his son's hair making it look like the birds nest it used to be.
"...now!" they both said going back and forth.
"Mr. and Mrs. Weasely I'm sorry if I have upset anyone, I've just had enough of him having a go at me for me gaining something I never had" said Harry but everyone knew that there was something more to it.
Within no less than five minutes the Dursley's were yet again upon them, Harry tried to hide in his father's side while Severus straightened his back, even though he was sitting down he was still rather intimidating to say the least.
"Fine..." said Albus twinkle in the eyes gone, but only for the time being. Otiz stood next to Hadrian not moving, breathing deep fur starting so change to a blood red colour.
Harry didn't care, he never wanted to let other people to know what had happened to him.
"Really Otiz?!" said Harry getting up from his seat at hitting his familiar on the back of the head making his ears and tail appear.
"Yes there is sir, these people have accussed me stealing my son from them. I haven't got a clue what they are on about, we want to leave but they won't let us" and he sighed towards them.
"Reviewing everything she is in major trouble not only has she rapped many students who were under a charm but has threatened to kill Hadrian Snape..."
In the Griffindor common room Hermione was trying to convince everyone that Tom was a bad Headmaster and that only Dumbledore could be Headmaster and not Tom!
......
"Severus could we perhaps have a talk about Harry tonight perhaps?" asked Lupin to the dower man who now had a small child in his arms.
"...right..."
Oh no Tommy's in trouble
"Tuney really do you have to make a scene like this?" he asked her, yes he didn't like her but this was her nephew of all things. He might of been adopted and then blood adopted but he was still her nephew either way.
"Well that was well and truly strange even for him" said Draco making Harry nod to him, while he scratched Otiz behind the ear who purred slightly in his slight doze.
"Come any closer and I'll bite you, he's mine" said the voice not opening her eyes to Tom.
He picks him up and right away he curled into the broad shoulder and was almost asleep before they hit the living room, thanking Merlin that the child was sleepy he took up place on the sofa and conjured a warm blanket and draped it over the child who was now almost asleep on his shoulder, his legs bracketing his own.
"So all I have to do is drink that and we are done?" said Harry making Severus smile and then nod.
"I'm sorry sir but I remember at the beginning of the year he got resorted as his name has changed as his father wanted it" he said confidently to the enraged Professor.
She was now a slave to the Weasely family.
"I agree" said the adults
Harry has changed back and forth from phoenix to basilisk again and again, it seemed that his magic was starting to settle by the end of the day near curfew he transformed once again this time he was a combination of the two which made Otiz growl at being frighten away making the other three in the room jumps as well at the sound.
Ginny was taken away for the day so then she could 'earn her keep' which everyone was happy about as she in Draco's terms which were a waste of space, out of sight out of mind in everyone else's view and Harry was happy about it the same with Otiz, he had decided to be in teenager form as he wanted to go on some of the faster more exciting rides that the park had to offer.
🌸Supreme Mugwamp of the International Confederation of Wizards
Everyone was shocked he was meant to be his friend for Merlin's sake but here he was slating his friend off, for what, nothing!
"Oh hurry up" whined Otiz which sounded like his child form which made harry laugh non stop making everyone smile, since Severus had decided to adopt the boy back in his second year they had seen more and more smiles and laughs coming from him then any of them knew what to do with him. he was really coming into his own person.
"Dad...." he was just loud enough to draw the attention of the Dursley's to him, right away Vernon's beady little eyes where drawn to him.
He looked down and saw that they were still stuffed animals but they were moving. His toy snake he had called Salazar was now wrapped around his arm hissing happily and his wolf he had called Mooney, he didn't know why but he called it that but it seemed to fit it, like a memory of some sort, was laying on his lap and it sounded like he was growling contently.
Blaise- Wise
"Hadrian can you try and make Otiz go back to his human form, it would be easier to walk around and not have a blue fox hybrid around".
BULLYING POOR HADRIAN, YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT I CALLED HIM HADRIAN JAMESON SEVERUS SNAPE AND NOT HARRY JAMES POTTER, FOR JUST BEING ADOPTED BY PROFESSOR SNAPE.
"Who knew a hybrid animal like Otiz who drinks blood and changes into a child and teenage form likes coffee" said Theo to them hoping said hybrid didn't take his drink as well.
"We were asked by the Headmaster to join him in his office where he asked why Hadrian never went to his relatives or to the Weasely's for the summer. Let's say he wasn't happy with that answer" and he sighed and rubbed both boys hair.
STS- Severus Tobias Snape
Twenty minutes later Severus was met by a clean, dressed Harry who still had damp hair and his glasses were still slight steamed up. With a flick of his wand he had Harry's hair dry and his glasses clear.
Once they were finished they headed out, down to the bus stop and into town, which by Severus' surprise was huge he hadn't spent much time here as he would always stay in the castle over the smaller holidays and then during the summer he would go off and look for potion ingredients around the world, he never really went into town.
"My office now all of you, Mr. Malfoy go and get Madam Pomfrey, tell her that someone has been injured and that they are in my office" Draco ran off right away.
Tom Mavolo Riddle....
"School funs! Mowwy come and had go at wed hair boy and girl and fuzzy head girl, I no like them. Wed head boy mean to Hadwin! Me tack him but stop when Mowwy come, she nice" said Otiz, after that he started to play with the toys again as he had finished eating and his drink was now dry.
"Oh Merlin! Sev I'm so sorry I don't think it would be that bad! Honest I didn't" said Tom trying to get Severus to understand him somewhat.
He stood up making everyone look at him he just said "Granger what are you doing with my familiar I've been looking everywhere for her, you stole her off me! Who knew you would stoop so low to steal someone else's familiar's, just because you can't get one!" he went over to her and Coco went right into his hand and up his shoulder to wrap around his neck.
"Harry I need you to hold onto me we are going to apparate" and with his they left and returned to Hogwarts only to leave again to Spinners End.
Gryffindor- Father (Lord)
Many of the student came from the Sacred families even if they were also branches from said families. They would make sure that the shunning would last inside and outside of Hogwarts!
"Is it something like Disney World?" asked Harry only for Tom and Severus nod as they knew what it was..... after much research that is.
The women had tears in their eyes while the men showed restrain not to cry but he knew that they wanted to but they were a big brave gusto to their wives and friends.
"Dway, Hadwin sads" and he curled into the blond before dropping off completely.
Mentions of abuse sadly
"You two are stupid" said Ginny making Ron agree with her with a mouth full of cereal, but he was staring across the hall to one green eyed, spectacled young boy who was sat between Draco and Blaise.
Harry was happy enough but something in a window caught his attention more than anything and went over to have a look at it, it was beautiful, the gems in it could be replaced to but anyone's birthstone it in, it was perfect for Narcissa and he smiled and called over Severus.
"Dad he didn't mean to, I think he's just bored as I'm doing my homework and he just wants to play, plus if I remember correctly a Kitsune is a Japanese fox demon that loves to play jokes" said Harry to him as he sat down.
"Yea, I'm good just shocked that Otiz is now human... but what else is strange, magic is real why not this!"
That child was never cared for until he was taken in by Professor Snape last summer, I thought your father and I brought you lot up to be respectful and not harm others! You young lady are grounded and I think most likely Professor Snape will go to the Ministry about you planning to murder the poor boy as he is his father now.
What do you want me to say Thomas! I forgive you! Like heck I will! You pathetic, insignificant arse! I should never of confessed my feelings to you, you idiot!" he was back to crying.
He glared at him, hoping and praying that the boy didn't stare back but he also didn't want his older brothers to find out what he was doing but it caught the eye of Percy of all things.
"Sorry Theo he's upset about Granger, that's all. He doesn't mean to do that honest to Merlin he doesn't, this just means I have to sort it out as he's very stubborn" said Harry leaving the group to talk to his familar.
You are not allowed out of your room unless called for, you are not alowed out of this house unless I am with you, you will not be allowed to talk to any of your friends if they send an owl I will be the one to reply to them.
"Fine spoil sport" and she walked off leaving the guys alone.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is now in prison after being brought to court I wonder what is going to happen to him now, will he stay there or not??, I have plans don't worry
Tom laughed at it all and hid his wand from Severus and winked up at Harry who laughed at his father's sigh.
Soon their food had arrived something light which had been a salad for the both of them, Harry a tuna niçoise hold the olives while Draco had a chicken ceaser salad, they had asked for some raw meat for Otiz which they were happy to supply for them.
Hermione looked at her and knew that if she kept putting it off she would most likely be expelled from Hogwarts and she didn't want that to happen, Hogwarts was the best thing that ever happened to her, she didn't want to go back to her boring muggle life, back to being normal.
"Ok let's get dad's new quill and me some for me as well and hopefully someone doesn't eat them again" said Harry while he glared at Otiz when he said the last part who just smiled at him the best he could in animal form.
..........
Severus had tied his hair at the nap of his neck and wore sunglasses, while Harry had a cap on his head and a pair of sunglasses as well.
"Minvera, Filius can you send my students to be library while I take one Mister's Snape, Zabini, Malfoy and Weasely and one Miss Granger to my office to discuss what has happened" said Severus making both teachers nod.
"So your shoes are up there again?" he said as he looked up to them and sighed before he could help her get them back down he was pushed landing on the floor making Otiz growl at who ever it was when he looked he was it was the stupid know it all or at least she thought she was smart enough to be classed as that but even Crabbe and Goyle were beating her at exams.
"Thank you Hadrian for this and either way I'll get you some sugar quills ok" and they both left the room and headed towards the living room only for Harry to stop and stare at the blonde headed boy in the room.
"He doesn't have to do nothing he doesn't want" said Draco to them coming over to help Harry up off the floor then noticing his bleeding nose and broken glasses.
"Harry is this all true?" asked Albus but he didn't move he knew his name now and wouldn't go by any other name, he was no longer a Potter he was a Snape!
"Professor I'm sorry about that" said Harry to him but yet again he was looking at the floor scared, he only stopped when he felt fingers underneath his chin and onyx met forest eyes. "Harry don't be, if you want anything I will give it to you within reason, that is something that I will promise from today onwards ok" said Severus as he let Harry's chin go.
"He's never acted like this before" said Theo and Blaise together, after they had man handled Otiz away from Harry who by now was shaking in place and it wasn't even lunch time and they had to go back before he had a full meltdown in the middle of the street.
Harry managed to get everyone to his room and then went out to give his father his shopping but when he got close enough he noticed the bottle of what he could make out was Fire Whiskey.
Severus returned to the Malfoy family who were trying to calm Harry down once again but it wasn't working, Otiz was nuzzling him and licking his face but it still wasn't enough.
"Dad that really hurt!" moaned Harry as he tried to sit but was was pushed back into the bed.
Evans- Mother
No one noticed that two red heads were watching the whole thing play out and tried not to laugh at their siblings and their friend, it was way too funny, so in the end they headed up to their dorm and once they entered the fell on the floor laughing so hard that they had trouble breathing.
Next they entered Scrivenshafts and picked up four red ink bottles as well as some brand new quills that all of them needed.
"...up to" said the twins and then they turned to look in the direction that their brother was looking at, ultimately frowning when they saw who it was.
"Miss Granger please understand, your grades have slipped to that of a P, if you don't pick them up you could be expelled" said Minerva to her.
"Otiz what in blue blazes was that all about" said Harry once he was finally put down onto the ground, but Otiz just growled his eyes flashing from their normal emerald green to a blood red, he was pissed to say the least of it all.
On the other side sat Dumbledore in a grotesque robes of snot yellow green with bright purple Patten's that changed every so often and his lawyer, who was a Squib who no one really cared for their name and if it was said they completely forgot it.
"Voldemort.. I didn't think it was you but now that I look it is you.." and he glared as best he could, truth it would be no where near as effective as Severus' or Otiz' but it would do for the time being.
"Otiz Hadrian Severus calm down or I will bind you to the wall for a week!" said Harry getting up from between Blaise and Theo, walking to Severus' private rooms, locking it.
Soon they were on the Smiler which made Sirius full on ill as he was going through loops and that strange smiling face wasn't helping him at all they others loved it and found it funny, they were soon off the ride, Remus had to help him off with the help of Arthur.
Hadrian- Hadwin
Their first Hogsmeade visit
"...ball" they said switching back and forth.
"Well we can go to Hogsmeade as we are third years and we have all got consent for it including Hadrian there... mind you he's fast asleep on you Draco" he laughed slightly pointing to the boy sleeping on Draco's shoulder.
If I was lucky enough to get something to eat it would most likely be a mouldy piece of bread, a couple of crackers if I was really lucky and a glass of water, that was it.
My chores would be to clean the whole house, do the washing, washing up, hoover, mop, dust, garden, sort out the loft as well as the garage, cook their food, wash the car and paint the fence and that was just my typical week really.
"Just admit it you stole that freak from us!" yelled Vernon to him while his son Dudley tried to yank the poor boy off his father.
She took a bite of her food and after swollowing she started to blurt out......
Their friends had decided on this even before they had planned to go with the two, as a new couple just starting out they needed time and space to grow, even though Otiz would be following them around he was their for protection more than anything.
Sophia-Ivy Scarlett Anderson, 63 years old, blond hair and blue eyes, a retired Police Officer as well and was Elijah's ex force mate. Loves to see and make things. AKA Soph.
"Potter just get up from there right now!" Ron's voice getting louder making Harry shrink he hated loud noises.
Soon he was wolking back to his office to stew on what he had learnt from Harry and Otiz, chocolate and a romantic evening just the two of them.
She was now completely alone.
Sorry to all the seven year olds out there, I really am
With that she dismissed class but Harry stayed behind, he wanted to talk to her about what was being said and what would happen.
As they were looking around everywhere enjoying themselves and everything when Otiz noticed some bushy hair in the distance, he straight away transformed into his animal form and growled.
Remus looked over and saw who Tom was talking too and when he saw the familiar black fur of one Padfoot a.k.a. Sirius Orion Black he knew something was up.
Pansy- Pans
With a crack and a pop it was back in place Poppy accoid a pain reliever potion and had him drink it before she let him go back to class.
"Ah Mrs Weasely and young Miss Weasley, welcome, welcome sit down sit down. I would say it's very nice to have you here but from what I have heard and read it isn't" sighing.
The other grabbed a few sweets and paid for them and left, Otiz happily eating a blood lolly as the group all headed to the Three Broomsticks for some lunch as they sat down and got some Butterbeer, twin fingers sat down as well.
Favourite season: summer so then he can so swimming in the lake! He loves water
"Well it appears that you were outcasted and shunned not just by the students and teachers of Hogwarts alike but by the Wizarding World as well. This is the reason why your apparence has changed to fit the Muggle World.
As this Covid-19 is going around and that I have to self isolate due to my health and a very bad mould allergy thanks to the harsh winter weather we had, which has made my chest weak, I can update more often than not..... I hope everyone is healthy and safe..... stay safe people and dont go out unless necessary ok....... Sumire 🌸🌸
"Sev, Minerva what a pleasant surprise to have you here, what can I do to help you?" he asked finally decided to have a break from the mountain of paperwork that never seems to be ending.
Harry leaned over to Draco and whispered "isn't that Coco on Granger?"
Coco started to move on her head freaking her out completely.
"Young Heir Prince if I could ask you to discard your robes in that room over there and change into the robes waiting there, once done come out and then follow me up to the table" said Griphook only to have Harry nod to him and headed off to the little room.
With a sigh Otiz got up from the floor from where he was sitting after he had changed back and headed back into the common room.
When they all read the potions, charms and blocks on the boy everyone was shocked yet again, who knew the boy had much so many on him, how in Merlin did he manage to live with his core practically blocked as well as all of this abuse, it was a miracle that he was alive at all.
Outside Minerva ushered them up and into her office, where there was tea waiting for them.
Lives: Spinners End
And so Bancroft looked towards Albus, Amelia, Harry and Severus as well as the rest of the court and sighed.
"I've managed to get them to do all my homework while I just sit there doing nothing and taking all the credit!" and she laughed evilly, something that would even make He Who Shan't Be Named be happy with.
"Oh for crying out loud I didn't mean to drop you Hads really I didn't" said Otiz to the phoenix in his hands which looked to be pouting if a phoenix could pout that is.
Remus and Severus entered the Slytherin common room and was assaulted by a black blob only to be followed by a small blue haired boy.
"Not going to take it from you Theodore honest I don't like tea, plain black coffee is lovely" and he smiled at him.
At the end of the day after having his lessons in that small classroom as well as his lunch he was brought to the car park where his sister's were waiting for him.
"Everything was fine today I found out a number of people were using... Oh what were they called... Oh never mind but it was going great until I got a Floo call regarding her" said Arthur pointing to his daughter.
"Be Tev!!" was all he said and then he finally came over and held his arms up to Harry and said "sweepy now Hadwin" this made both of them laugh and then went to pay for everything that Otiz had picked up.
"It's what you heard Sir...." he raised an eyebrow but she didnt see it as she was trying not to look at her two Professor's but instead lookd at her shoes.
.............
"Dray it's 'a leg to stand on'" laughed Harry to the boy.
"Draco I have no idea why you both are at each other's throats all the time but this will stop, right away. This is not how a Malfoy should act" again his father sneered at him, making the boy nod.
"What's going on? I'm so confused by all of this" said Harry looking at his friends and family, Otiz was beside himself really to explode if he could that is, Harry wouldn't put it passed him to some how combust.
.....
"Severus can you bring young Mister Potter to my office please. Remus I would like you there as well" and so he left the two, without listening to Severus about Harry know being known as Hadrian.
"Now Lord Prince I ask you to cut your wrist deep enough to full the goblet halfway, don't worry the wound will heal right away. Once done please do the same for young Heir Prince".
"Just leave the traitor Ron and come on we have Potions to get to" said Hermione closing her book and getting up.
In the end they walked out with four children's robes all of white and blue to match his fur colour with a hint of silver throughout.
"Well I think Otiz should have some new clothes, I don't think we will be able to keep getting the blood out of Dudley's old clothes, thank Merlin I kept some" smiled Harry as he began to take of the item in question off the small boy.
Time for some shopping and see what my SMOL bean is up to and who is he going to meet this time?
He chucked the Floo powder into the Floo network system and called out for the Ministry, once all the tugging finished Harry practically fell out of the Floo.
Everyone looked at Otiz and then Pamona then at Harry and then back at Otiz.
"My uncle would make me sleep in the cupboard under the stairs since I started to live with them, I didn't even know my name is Harry until I was at least six, when I was finally let to go to school that is, I always thought that is was Freak.
Harry rubbed his head in pain and looked at Tom...
"Pup listen I don't think these rides are good for me" said Sirius only to make watery green eyes look at him, "that will be the death of me Hadrian and you know it, fine I'll go on them".
It was the last lesson of the day, Ron still hadn't returned to lessons as Otiz' spell made sure of that, perhaps tomorrow he would come too, who knew when it came to Otiz.
"Hi goof did you make more friends?" only to have him nuzzle Harry, slowly dropping off.
"Ok what is it?" asked Draco and now the thing was sleeping on his shoulder.
Albus Dumbledore.
"Finally I've been trying to get up to the Headmasters office for what an hour now and the stupid thing won't budge! I've said all the sweets I know but it won't let me up" she said matter of factly.

"Ron, Ron, Ron we have no idea what has happened, all we know is that we walked into the Great Hall something fell on us and now we both have green hair and animal ears to match, we don't have a clue how it happened" said George.
"All he needs is a name and a drop of your blood and he is all yours and he will only follow you and will trust those you trust no one else" and she smiled to them.
Great someone wanting to talk to me as my freakin floo, should of put a spell on it, has just gone off, so I leave the safety of my personal potions lab to find out who it was. Standing there in my living room is none other than Poppy Pomfrey looking rather worried, this can't be good I have never seen her like this before.
Again he clamped his hands over his mouth!! He didn't want everyone to learn of this at all!! He was going to be in so much trouble!!
"You Mr. Snape are lucky that your Animagus forms didn't hurt you, you have a clean bill of health, before you can leave which will be tomorrow so I can observe you, you need something to eat and drink".
Severus contacted me a few years back when you first entered the school wondering what we were going to do but when he found you at the end of your first year everything changed.
Severus was downstairs in the kitchen drinking some coffee with a small fry up in front of him while reading the paper which was floating when Harry came in.
Albus looked over at them red in the face and screamed again at them, this made them all look at him and all decide that it was time of leave the tantrum throwing Albus.
Severus had finally gotten Harry to uncurl himself and looked Ron in the eyes and before he said anything he ever so slightly whistled making Otiz come over to him but didn't calm down.
Once they got a seat and had ordered their drinks, Lupin finally started talking.
................
"What......a...are..... we....we going..... to tell.......eve....ever....everyone" mumbled Harry quietly but didn't get an answer until Severus sat down placing some plain pancakes in front of Harry while he handed him the fruit as well.
"There's something in my hair and it's moving get it out get it out!" and she screamed again as Coco wrapped around her neck.
Everyone was at dinner for the night after a week of getting back into the whole 'school is important and make sure you study' crap that was now the norm after two luxurious weeks of pure bliss, most of his dorm mates hadn't even completed their Christmas homework and were now rushing to finish it as it was all due in this week.
"EW~" said Harry as he came into the room, this made both of them smile at him.
"Sit eat, then back to your room, Ginerva" said her father  after Molly placed her sandwich in front of her while she placed hers and Arthur's in their places which was a small roast.
"Nah it's more fun to take it from you when you don't expect it, plus in this form I am older than you lot" he sat down drinking the coffee and eating the biscuits.
"I can smell that you have questions for me".
"So I lost the only thing that is or was James, the only I cared about for ten years was to get close to my godson, my little Bambi".
All she had to get was some nice steak meat and then they would be done but then a thought came to her, some nice pudding for afterwards... Cherry pie with custard for the two of them.
Harry took a deep breath and nodded towards the Goblin who passed the dagger to Severus so then he could help Harry.
Once he was sat down Otiz ran over to the tree and picked up two presents one for each of them, he handed them over and dived back under the tree to find one for him.
Hermione on the other hand was very, very quiet about the whole like she just wanted to disappear from everything that was going on. She kept herself to herself most of the time and when she had to interact with her fellow students she wasn't the know it all brat that she always was, she let people answer the questions asked. ((Shocker))
"I had asked Minerva to come and get you just in case I was held up but...." he couldn't finish what he was saying and turned to his colleague.
They had a whole floor to themselves which had six rooms, the last one they decided that if the boys wanted a sleep over that would be the room for them to do that.
While everyone was eating Fred and George came up behind Harry making him squeak as they grabbed a hold of his arms and taking him out of the Great Hall.
"Hadrian what are you doing?" this made Harry jumped at first but when he turned round he saw it was his father.
"D...d...dad" was all he said making his Gryffindor friends look at him, "Hadrian is something the matter here?"
"Aren't you coming? This is your room" Harry then scrambled to my side, Harry then looked up and asked "M-mu room? My own room? at home I never really had a room, I always slept in the cupboard" Harry slowly looked around the room that he could call his, it had a four poster bed, a dresser and a desk. Harry was still so shocked that me the greasy git was being so nice. I can be when I want thank you very much!! "Thank you sir" Harry mumbled "you're quite welcome, well off to bed with you, if you need anything at all my bedroom is just to the left of yours. The bath room is to the right of your room" I watch as Harry set his things down and climb into the huge bed.
They sat there for a while and even though the rest of their dorm mates were by this time asleep their minds were racing, they tried to sleep but nothing worked and so they got up and started plotting for the rest of the night.
Everyone knew that the twins were behind this but due to practically everyone had been pranked even themselves they couldn't prove it as all.
"Don't even think about finishing that sentence Weasley, I'm different from them and as you can see I'm not a runt or a stupid thing as you so put me!
Tom was in the doghouse, big time that was for sure, Severus hadn't even spoken a word to him yet looked at him since he had come to his office demanding to know why Hermione was out of isolation.
They have the ability to change their eye shape depending on the time of day, their fur sparks when petted, lick blood and walk without sound.
Yes he knew but he wasn't going to tell on them after what he had learnt from Severus and Minerva as well as Ron saying what he said last night, it disgusted him.
"We never knew what the poor boy was going through during his time with those people who was meant to be his family, us the Malfoy's a pure blood family would never in our wildest dreams do that to any child. No wizarding family would" sneered Lucius indicating his hatred of the family.
"Hi Tev!" smiled the boy and then hugged him tightly.
Ashkenaz or Naz meaning A Fire that Spreads- rainbow phoenix
"Well it appears that you Mister Weasely are in a whole heap of trouble! Since we left not even ten minutes I've had nothing but information about you and your acts... shall we call them?" she looked him right in the eye.
"You did this!" shouted Draco pouting and pointing to his head which only earned him a smile from the two devils.
"Mooney I missed you so badly as well, I was going crazy in that cell if it hadn't been for Tomas I would still be there, he got me a trial and everything, I'm now free and Tomas said I could come to Hogwarts with him. Oh Mooney if I hadn't gone after that rat Harry wouldn't have been in that household and grew up like that! We need to get him out!"
Otiz growled but only Harry and Severus heard but stopped when Amelia Bones entered and sighed she had no reason why this was taking place as everything that she had seen was in fall working order.
Harry soon came round the corner and saw Otiz and Tom talking and he laughed at the meanie pants comment making Tom look at him.
What do you think, can you think of anymore, credit will go to you
"... tell you.."
"He, that freak is still our property that old man of yours said so and I would like compensation for what we normal people had to put up with since he came to us" yelled Vernon making more people turn to look at them.
"Otiz!! Get off you goof!" said Harry to the hyper fox that he loved so much... He was brought out of his musings by a knock on the door which was met by Otiz bounding over to it dragging Severus with him, clothes in his mouth.
The conniving, nefarious, disgusting old coot how could he do this to a poor boy of only twelve years old, he hadn't even begun his life and here he was trying to kill him before his life even began.
It was one that helped me get this far by getting magic off Harry the same with Ron but now I can't find it!"
As he sat back down he finished what Harry was saying.
Fawkes has fallen asleep on the back of his chair only to wake up when the person in front of the desk coughed slightly, making Tom drop his quill ruining the work he had been doing for the past hour.
"Ru'et" squealed Otiz as he was given them who smiled a thank you and the started playing with them on Harry's lap, he was so not moving for the time being.
"Professor we were halfway down to your class when Granger and Weasely stopped us, saying that Hadrian there shouldn't be in Slytherin and that Professor Dumbledore would happily sort him back, Weasely then grabbed his elbow and started to pull him".
"Quiet! Mr. Weasley continue"
"Hadrian, son take this potion and try to get some rest while the rest of us discuss everything ok" said Severus as he handed Harry a Calming Draught which he took right away, relaxing into a light sleep on his father's lap.
They were met with a blurr of blue as it hit Lucius in his chest making him fall over.
"Remmy, Remus did you remember to take you potion?" but he was flung aside and ran off into the woods.
Out raged wasn't the word for what he felt at the moment, he looked like a blue haired Severus!
Mother- Hallie Harper Anderson neé Clarks, 37 years old, light brown hair and warm honey coloured eyes. She is a receptionist at a nursery that her children went to when they were babies. AKA Hails
"Sev?... you in here?" said the voice that was calm but you could hear the worry in his voice.
"What the bloody hell happened to you too?" asked Ron as they both at down leaning on each other to try and stay awake.
Severus knew this morning was going to be a problem and so with a flick of his wrist the bed covers were taken off leaving Harry still wearing his pyjamas
The barrier also had a silencing charm weaved into it so no one could hear her but she could hear them and it also had a spell weaves into it that once called by anyone of her family she would be forced to go to them.
I would kindly like everyone to welcome one Mister Tomas Marvolo Sötétség, he was once a very well known attorney back in Hungry and has complete recommendations and qualifications for this job, so has moved back to England after twenty years away".
"Sev I'm sorry I really am"
"What in Merlin's beard has gotten into that man of late!" she almost screamed but stopped as she had patients resting.
"Minister if e could get onto this, I have left poor Minerva and Severus to deal with the school and the still mountains of paper work that needs to be completed. They don't mind really but they still have their own work to complete and I sadly don't want to waste anymore time" said Tom making Fudge nod.
..............................
Everything was ruined! How did they do this! How did they come up with these potions or spells and place it on them!
Otiz turned round and took hold of Harry's robes and dragged him out of the room, opening the door with magic.
"You all lost me and uncle Lucy won!"
"Would it be alright if I become your legal guardian" Harry launched himself into his arms again "I take that as a yes then? Bring whatever you made need or want with you and I will shrink it down" Harry nodded and grabbed only three things.
It was hot outside, so they were both dressed in thin Muggle clothes, Harry in tan khaki shorts and a red and blue stripe t-shirt while Severus as in a pair of black trousers and a dark green top. Harry hadn't let him out of the house if he was wearing all black.
Narcissa saw what she was going and pointed it out to Molly and Arthur as they wanted to know what she would do.
He just sighed and said "Padfoot I know it's you come on out and greet me properly"
"Before we do the adoption papers I would like to see a full medical history of Harry and then we can see what we can do afterwards" this made Griphook smile again and out of nowhere pulled out Harry's self updating medical report, he passed to over to Severus so then he could read it.
Changing back Otiz glared at him, "pray tell me Hadrian why you did that, you know my nose is sensitive and it hurts!" Harry just laughed at his familiar.
"Before you go Har.... I mean Hadrian would it be ok if we talked for a moment I would love to know how a familiar can change their age" and he smiled to the raven haired boy.
"Miss Granger what can I do for you besides give you detention for being out of class for no reason, you don't have a free lesson so... I would like to know why you were outside my office and not in class" said Tom.
The pranks have been named as:
"She said if anyone comes near dray she'll bite you" said Draco to them.
Once it stopped glowing fully Severus began to read through what his son had been though, as he read it Harry clung tighter and tighter to him, he didn't want anyone to know this, he was hating every minute of it.
Tom just sighed at this but at least he had a somewhat plan he could use to help him get back to Severus, the only thing he needed to do was find out his favourite chocolate and plan the food which was easy enough, a nice three course meal and some wine and Severus' favourite film and he hoped everything would go as planned.
Severus watched as Harry only grabbed three things: a picture of Lily, his wand and his robe. Severus looked strangely at Harry "is that all you're bringing?" Severus asked unsure. "This is all I own sir" Harry mumbled, this only angered Severus, how cold these stupid muggles do this to Lily's son? He didn't let his anger show, he didn't want to scare Harry. "Harry I need you to hold onto me, we are going to apparate". Once this was said, Harry came over to Severus and took a hold of his arm and they apparated to Hogwarts.
Draco's eyes lit up he had a feeling he knew where they were going he hadn't been to that place since he was a little child, he must of been about six the last time be was there Lucius had started to get busy with work so they could go much anymore so if he was right he would love to go again and this time to share it with Harry!
Harry had a hard time choosing between the Rook or the Wedge Tailed Eagle feather quills and so he got a couple of each and a lot of dark blue ink bottles.
"Well they look happy" said Pansy as she had finally hooked her arm around Harry's as he was busy looking in a store window, not really caring as he had seen those two talk quite often.
They both had decided that they would also booby trap some of the doors so then people would also get attacked by their pranks... This was going to be so much fun!!!
At Malfoy Manor Lucius was sitting down in the lounge waiting for Draco to appear so then they could talk about the arrival of Harry and Severus, he kept his face calm but his heart was beating a mile a minute.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hadrian calm down, Weasley won't be able to hurt you no one is Slytherin will let him trust me on this" said Draco hugging the boy slightly only to let go when Poppy reappeared handing Draco the Draught.
"Dad I think he would also need some toy's as well to keep him occupied for a while so then I can do my summer homework, you can do you lesson plans and potions and hopefully not trash the house again" and he laughed.
"That is Hadrian's familiar Otiz, he can take one of three forms, his animal form that looks like a light blue fox but he is in fact a hybrid animal, next is the small boy you see who is about six and then lastly a teenager of fourteen.
All I want to do is hug him better and delete this chapter but it sadly had to be written 😭😭😭
In came bounding Otiz who had licked his face that now it was dripping but Harry only laughed at his antics, Severus was in the doorway smiling slightly.
It had been only a week since the court case against Dumbledore was brought to order and he was infuriated and I mean infuriated!!
"Stop it!" said Harry making them both stop and stare at him wondering who he was talking to.
Fred and George were having so much fun, they couldn't work out why they hadn't got into trouble yet as they knew that everyone knew it was them but nothing was being done and so they were delighted to just carry on with what they were doing.
"Oh stop Severus we both know you have a concussion, I want you to take this pain potion and rest for the remainder of the day in your quarters, so then it's quiet. I will explain everything to Minerva" and she handed over the potion to him.
......................
"Come on then I see a nice café just up the road from here" said Lupin and so the three followed the werewolf into the café.
"Dad I don't really want to go home now" moaned Harry as he packed his bag as they were leaving the following day.
Tom ignored her until he sat down behind his desk in an overly comfortable chair, pushing aside some parchement an ink that he had been using before he went for a walk to clear his head, once he was done he turned to her.
"Who is it?"
"His name is Harry Potter and I'm going to marry him, or kill him when I get my hands on him! He should stay away from that slimy snake he's calling his father, both of his parents are dead, he should stay with his loving relatives" interrupted Ginny.
Ron came over to him and started asking Merlin knows how many questions.
Everyone had arrived and were finally sorted, Severus sat in his normal seat and next to him was Remus Lupin that Harry had breifly met over the summer holidays when they went shopping in Muggle London.
Severus took his wand and put it to his head and pulled out a whisper from his head and placed it in the Pensieve, then everyone dipped their fingers in only to be pulled into the memory, Harry was left behind in the office with another Ministry officer.
"Quiet Miss...."
Otiz then nuzzled his way onto the bench next to Theo who he licked on his face making Harry laugh at what Otiz was doing.
"....you told them!!!" screamed Harry into Severus' face, this made Otiz' hackles rise slightly at the outburst, fur staticing everywhere, Severus sighed he knew he had made a big mistake by it, he knew would turn out much better then he would expect in the future.
Your wand will be with me or your father at all times, you will not be allowed to use magic you will act as if you are a Squib. Do I make myself clear if I do hand over your wand and head upstairs to your room.
"Well we went out for the day and we met some people that I never wanted to see again.... even if my life depended on it".
God complex
"No I don't remember you and I would say that my name is now Hadrian Severus Jameson Snape, as of August before my second year, my god parents are Narcissa and  Lucius Malfoy as well as Molly and Arthur Weasley I don't even know you!"
"Oh I got him in the pet shop that deals with familiars, we were looking for the last Christmas present for Bill Weasely when I ended up in there, the teller said he was two Japanese demons. A Bakeneko a Japanese cat demon and a Kitsune a Japanese fox demon, he's very rare and the teller said that no one beside me has been allowed near him" finished Harry only to sigh when Draco put him in checkmate again.
Hermione hung her head low and started reading her book on Care of Magical Creatures for an essay that was due in on Monday.
Draco put his hand on Harry's shoulder "Hadrian it's ok look up at the Head Table I can see a small blue haired boy sitting on my father's lap" this made Harry turn towards said table.
Malnutrition, dehydrated, lacerations to back and anus, whips to back, rash to bottom
"Ok everyone it's time for lights out... Mr. Malfoy if you would escort Hadrian here to your dorm that would be good" and so he left the room.
The charms potions and blocks to tie the magic so then they would not exceed a certain level and to make them easier to bend to your will it is stated that Gringotts that you have permission from the family to do so and when we checked with their parents or guardians that nothing of the sort happened.
"Ronald, Ginevra I think you have both forgotten what mum had told you in the Howler she had sent a few weeks back. I will write to her about everything that I personally have witnessed and about other things that have been brought to my attention by other students.
"Look Jessie, whittle Maxie hit his port whittle nose" said one of them to her sister, making her laugh.
If you are worried about Otiz there, he won't be allowed to be removed as he is your familiar and the Ministry of Magic can't do anything about it as forcefully removing him will most likely kill you both, sadly" she sighed but then smiled at him.
He snarled at them, she was by his mate no one was allowed by his mate unless they were in his pack which was only him, Sirius, Lilly, James, Harry or should we say now Hadrian and now it also included Severus Tomas and Draco all by fault of them being in Harry's life now.
I WANT YOU BOTH TO THINK ABOUT WHAT COULD OF HAPPENED IF WE HAD FOUND THIS OUT SOONER RATHER THAN OVER CHRISTMAS OF ALL THINGS! CHRISTMAS YOU HEAR ME!!
.......
As they were sitting in Charms which was better than History of Magic and Care of Magical Creatures, he swears that Hagrid was trying to piss him off, listing things about his creatures which in fact was completely and utterly wrong! Where did he get his information again? History which in his book was a high snore fest and many of them had fallen asleep including Harry and Draco.
BULLYING IS SOMETHING ONLY COWARDS DO AND I HAVE NEVER BROUGHT UP MY CHILDREN TO BE COWARDS OR FOR THEM TO BE BULLIES! NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS!
"Um.... I have an appointment....." and he turned down the hall towards the dungeons he didn't want to go to classes he wanted to be anywhere but near them.
He will always shorten your name if he likes you but will completely ignore you otherwise, he sees the Weasely family minus Ron and Ginny as his cousins, Molly and Arthur as aunt and uncle, Harry's Slytherin friends as his cousins as well. Lucius and Narcissa are his aunt and uncle be default.
Tom just sighed at this and looked towards a quite shocked Remus Lupin.
"Harry listen to us for Merlin's sake you need to get out of that slimy god for nothing house and the demon bat from hell and come back to where you belong!" shouted Ron for the final time.
"Headmaster, we need to discuss some things right now!" I snapped. "My dear boy, what can I do for you?" Dumbledore asked as he stared at the Daily Prophet before him, really? I just glared before continuing "are you aware of what is happening in Potter's home?" even though I'm so trying to be civil with this idiot even though he's my boss. "Severus, what is wrong? is Harry alright?" Dumbledore finally looked up with concern lacing his every word, wow that got his attention usually we have to say something sweet related to get that reaction. I could only close my eyes and remember how my git of a father used to beat me. I quickly snapped out of it only to stare into blue depths of Albus Dumbledore's eyes.
I will set up this meeting with yourselves, his new godparents as well as any others you have interacted with, but I do think a blood adoption will work more in your favour than anything else. Hadrian would you be ok with that?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Ginny tried to go over and look at the clothes around the shop but found that she had couldn't!
"Close you mouths before flies get trapped!" said now a very bored Otiz to them as he again played with his wand like a cheerleader with a baton.
Hermione wanted to say something but she knew if she did she would be in more trouble, she had made sure that she had kept her head down and she wanted to keep it that way.
Harry nodded at this, "I don't want Dumbledore and my ex friends to interfer anymore, I want them to leave me alone!" said Harry to the Goblin who again smiled towards the shy boy, not as shy as he had been but still shy.
“Not really. I don’t know. We just had a fight. I don’t know what’s happening now.”
“It’s not like it’s a complicated idea, Draco.”
He was hoarse. He vaguely remembered the screaming.
“Detention with Umbridge.”
Draco shook his head.
Harry shrugged.
“Let’s see if there’s room further down,” said the boy over his shoulder.
“Are you going after Parkinson?” he asked him.
“Could be anyone,” she said. “I’ve no idea how this contraption works. Your voice doesn’t sound like you at all. How does it know those numbers are you?”
“I know, Malfoy. I just… I thought I was done with this, alright? I thought that I would never have to do this again. Or at least that it would be a very long time.”
“It’s not like you’re famous for controlling your temper either.”
“Well if you start acting like Mad-Eye Moody, the
"No."
Draco exhaled a sigh of relief. He sat down on the edge of a table and forced himself to relax his shoulders. He tried to think of the next thing to say – to seal the exchange before Potter took back his words, or just something to move them on, so they could put this whole embarrassing mess behind them. He could feel his heart pounding. He was glad they didn’t have an audience. Usually, that was what he wanted when he conversed with Potter, but this felt important in its own right. Potter still had his bag slung over his shoulder, but he looked like he had forgotten that he had been about to leave.
