“No, well- I did, but that’s beside the point.” He waved her off. “My father actually apologized for how he treated me growing up.”
“What haven’t you missed?” Pansy snorted.
The wedding. The Death Eaters at the cafe. The dust-figure of Dumbledore. The vision of Draco being forced to torture someone.  One of the Death Eaters they had escaped from.
“Mind? Why would I mind?” Harry finally tore his eyes away from the page and looked up at him. “Just the fact that you took the time to painstakingly draw me over and over again...filling all of these sketchbooks took a level of dedication I can’t even begin to fathom- it actually means a lot.”
It happened so suddenly she almost passed out from the shock. The carefully controlled calm was disintegrating. It felt like someone had poured acid directly onto her brain and it took all of her willpower to stay silent as the damned bubble that kept her a slave to the Dark Lord’s will burst. All of the pain and anger and fear she had been denied to feel came rushing back to her now and she couldn’t stop the gasp that escaped her lips.
“Indeed.” Narcissa fixed her son with a fond glare. “I hear you have a big day planned so I won’t keep you too much longer. Do you want to join us for dinner, Harry? I would be delighted to have you over.”
The alcohol brought a wave of irrational anger to the surface, the likes of which Harry had never felt before.
“They call it a long island iced tea. It originated over in the states, and believe you and me, Americans like to drink.” She gushed, clearly pleased.
“Sorry?” He looked at her blankly.
“Pansy Parkinson is no more a Death Eater than I am.” Harry smirked as if enjoying some private joke.
“What do you want first?” Harry asked excitedly, spreading the sweets across his lap like it was precious treasure.
“I make you happy?” He asked softly.
“I was a little surprised he wanted to hire me, I know nothing about art.”
“You moved out of my house and threw yourself at the first abominable thing you could find, did you? Well, I’m not having it!” Vernon threw the paper on the ground and stepped on it, grinding it against the pavement for good measure. “No family of mine is going to flaunt their repulsive behaviors and bring shame upon MY house!”
“Casual?” Harry furrowed his brow in confusion.
“Do you like it?”
“You said you had originally thought you were under the curse for eight years. That implies you believe differently now. What changed?”
"Gee thanks for pointing that out."
"Deal," Harry laughed and they left to go to the Three Broomsticks.
"Alright, gather 'round! We've got games to play and alcohol to drink," Hermione heard Pansy's voice travel over to her from across the room and she went to sit down next to Ron.
"There you are!" Hermione said, standing up from her seat at the table in the great hall, 'I was worried when Madam Pomfrey came and took you out in the middle of class."
“Yeah, I mean it,” Harry breathed, “I wanted to ask you to the Yule Ball too, that is if you aren’t still planning on not going?”
"All, good. Good to see you, Ginny, by the way. Hope your Christmas was good."
When Harry reached his room he paused and took a deep breath. He let it out and gripped the door handle and opened it to find a dark room.
Harry stared down at the potion that was slightly murky. It was clear when they'd left it to mature just 28 days ago, Harry thought, he figured it had to be fine though. After all, Draco had helped brew it, and him and Hermione were top of the class. With a shrug Harry dipped the stirring stick into the potion, spinning it clockwise. The stick was halfway around the cauldron when the potion bubbled up and promptly exploded in Harry's face, soaking their entire work-area with the potion. The last thing he remembered was seeing Draco's shocked face before he blacked out.
"I think Harry likes Malfoy, even if he hasn't actually admitted it to himself yet," Neville sat the watering can down, "Anyway, that should help your plant. Make sure to water it at least once a week, and it should be fine, I don't think you've really done anything else wrong."
"Of course, love," Harry said with a smile, rolling off Draco and laying on his side to look at him.
"Good match," Harry agreed, accepting the handshake, "you guys were a good match, that's for sure."
It was different though.
“Why? And on that note, how did you even know about this far enough ahead to buy me clothes?”
"Hufflepuff vs. Ravenclaw is the 21st right?" Ron asked, picking up his chess pieces and putting them away into his bag.
"I know where the kitchens are. The house elves down there like to give food."
"I'm just excited to not have any school work for a bit," Harry said.
"Harry!" Draco said, dragging the end of his name out as he got up and walked over to Harry's bed.
"I'm not pretending, I don't fancy him."
Harry’s other hand quickly found its way to Draco’s hip as Draco’s wound their way behind Harry’s neck.
"Yeah, let's all go to bed. Come on Harry," Hermione said, helping Harry up and giving him over to Ron to help him to bed.
"I think it might be time to get some fresh air," Draco said, taking the drink from Harry's hands and replacing it with water, "Come on, follow me."
"Well me telling you to stop fighting won't change anything," Hermione sighed. "While you were in McGonagall's office we were discussing starting a weekly party of sorts."
"You're staring again."
"Your face says it all," Pansy said, finally moving out of the doorway and walking up next to Draco, "here, let me help." Pansy picked up the small container of hair-styling potion. "You need to style it, but don't slick it back. You're not your dad. You need your own style."
"I love you too," Draco said as he watched Harry turn in place and disappear.
While he was watching her circle high above, she suddenly went into a steep dive, heading down towards the field.
When Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville made it back up to the common room they were met with a group of people around the bulletin board.
Deciding to not respond to Ron she turned back to Harry. "So who gave you a hangover potion?"
"I'll be right back. I want to get a book."
----------------------
Pansy.
Love you,
"It's alright, we know that this potion is going to take longer than one moon cycle at least. You can add that to the short list of things we know," Harry said with a sigh and Hermione gave him a knowing look.
The rest of the week flew by faster than Harry expected and pretty soon he was greeting Hermione, with Ron, at the door on New Years.
"No idea, For a moment I thought I had an idea, but it didn't really fit."
"Yeah... but never one that was glowing like this..." Harry trailed off as he continued to stare at the letter, it felt like it might blow up in his face, he could practically feel the magic radiating off it. He slowly picked it up and opened it as everyone watched with fascination.
"Huh? What?" Harry snapped back to the conversation, his brain slowly processing the question, "Oh, yeah I'm alright. My head hurts and," he paused for a moment wondering if he should tell her about the glowing - after all, the potion could've just gotten in his eyes - but decided it couldn't hurt, "and you're both glowing."
"We're okay," Ginny looked down at the seat across from Ron. He was sitting in a booth in the back of the restaurant. "Can we sit for a moment?" Ginny gestured to the seat.
"Well Quidditch of course, but I also really like cooking and drawing."
"Isn't saving the wizarding world interesting enough?" Draco laughed.
"What can I get you?" she said.
"Well obviously Harry is seeker, and I'm keeper," Ron said after reading the list over.
"Too bad you didn't room with me," Neville said with a grin and Blaise's face promptly turned red.
Draco shifted to glare up at him, "The difference is, it's still breakfast time. You were still asleep at noon."
"I don't-" Draco started.
"Grateful for the conversation Ron replied enthusiastically back, "Oh yeah! It'll be weird watching from the sidelines instead of playing, though."
"Well if he didn't always start-" Harry began and McGonagall sent him a look that made him snap his mouth shut.
"Well I was hoping not, but I wasn't sure. I wouldn't put it past you."
"It looks like it, doesn't it," Harry said, a smile crossing his features.
Harry had woken up an hour before and was trying to focus on his homework over his headache. He looked over at Draco now, and he tried to open his eyes and his nose scrunched up from the light. He thought it was oddly cute, the way his forehead scrunched up, but he knew he was in pain so he moved to get up and walk over.
Harry went to tilt his glass back when he caught sight of Draco taking a shot as well and he almost choked. Had he slept naked in the dorms this year? Did I just not notice? His mind was suddenly a whirlwind of questions that were less than appropriate and he almost missed the next question.
"Draco-"
That finally got a reaction out of him though and he let go of the letter with one hand to reach out for Harry’s, “Really? Like for real?” he asked, trying to get Harry to meet his eyes.
Blaise flopped down in his chair, "Weasley."
"Why don't you just use a heating charm?" Draco asked, watching Harry fidget with his scarf.
"You knew?!" Harry asked, shocked.
"You need someone better than me."
---------------------------
"You two sure took your time," Hermione said as Ron slid in next to her and Harry sat down across from them- in perfect view of the Slytherin table no less, but Harry would never admit that.
"Some example questions would be, 'What are the odds you'll kiss Neville' or 'What are the odds you'll chug a bottle of firewhiskey.'
"You what?!" Pansy shrieked.
"Oh!" Hermione said, looking down at the book, "Yeah, my parents sent it to me."
"Draco."
Draco's stomach dropped as the door to his bedroom opened.
"Oh whatever, Draco."
Draco surveyed her for a moment, then, "So you're the one who messed with our potion."
"Yeah, here," Harry said, handing him a blank piece of parchment that he'd dug out of his robe's pocket.
"What's going on?" Ron asked Seamus who had just turned away from the board.
"Don't worry, we have our own game next Saturday against Ravenclaw," Harry said, following Hermione and Draco's lead in standing up to follow the crowd of students back inside.
"That's not fair!" Draco immediately shouts, stricken by horror of the prospect of spending any time with Potter, let alone an hour.
"Yeah, you're probably right." Ginny got up to give the letter to Pigwidgeon and watched as he flew out the window with the letter to her parents.
Harry knew that it would not be a good idea to pick dare and quickly chose truth.
"Really?" Draco turned to look at him.
Harry pulled Draco's face back up to kiss him as Draco finally pulled Harry's pants off his hips. Draco pulled back to drop down to his knees.
December 21, 1998
"Oh shi- I forgot about that!" Harry said quickly, jumping away from the door and tugging it open.
Ginny asked Luna next who then asked Seamus. Seamus turned to Dean next, "Who do you think is going to be the next to get into a relationship?"
"Wicked," Ron said and Harry laughed.
Draco turned then to stare over at Harry's side of the room and raked his eyes over the red Gryffindor banner and Quidditch posters. Draco never really had decorated his walls before, even at home. Staring at the posters made him want to now.
"Well, I'm thinking it has to do with emotions," Hermione started. Ron wouldn't meet his eyes, his face flushed. "As in each color represents a different emotion, but not necessarily each emotion you're feeling at each time of the day. I think Red means love, Pink means crush, and blue means you don't currently like anyone like that."
"That's amazing!" Ginny whisper-yelled back and slapped Harry on the back.
"How is that great?" Ron cut in, "It's Malfoy, Hermione."
“Ah, here it is,” Pansy held out a nice suit that she’d pulled out from her closet. It was a dark blue and Draco could tell it had cost quite a bit.
"Yeah, that's true, though I have no ideas what they may mean," Harry said.
"I'm just so stupid," Draco said, his words slurring as he took another gulp of firewhisky, "I should'ta said anythin'."
“Yeah, I am definitely excited to not have to deal with them anymore, I’m sick of the headaches,” Harry said, shifting his food around his plate with his fork, trying to take his mind off Draco. At that moment, though, owls flooded the Great Hall and he couldn’t help the way his head snapped to watch as an owl dropped the blue letter to Draco.
"He went to visit a friend," Ron supplied and Hermione turned towards Harry, eyes questioning.
"Eight! Seven! Six!" Ron grabbed Hermione's hand and prepared to take a sip of the glass of champagne he had in his hand.
"I have no idea what I'd ask to do with him!"
Harry walked over to a few pots of what looked like mandrakes, Draco following along behind. "Mandrakes right?"
"Um, I was just wondering... if um, well if you'd like to do something together sometime? Like study or-or something else too, if you don't want to," the girl was red up to her ears now and Harry didn't really want to turn her down in front of all the Gryffindors in their area, but he really didn't know what else to do, not to mention he was totally off guard.
"Well it's not like it's extremely hard to get your hands on a more diluted version of it."
When morning came, Harry awoke to a head of blond hair in his face and arms wrapped tightly around him. He didn't remember anything from the night before and froze a bit in shock.
Draco’s shoulders slumped in relief. If it ever got back to his father that he was still drawing in his spare time….
“Not Ron.” Harry shuddered at the thought. He could definitely do without the relentless teasing. “Draco is more than capable. He’s clever and powerful. If you really want someone else, I can try and get Hermione to skive off work for the day.”
“Very well. The Wizengamot may proceed with questions regarding the crimes of Narcissa Malfoy.”
“That sounds like a great idea.” Harry smiled.
The silence that settled over them was deafening as Draco raised his wand. His hand was shaking and he couldn’t seem to draw in a steadying breath.
“What about the others? Aren’t they Potter’s friends? They probably know where he is if ugly over there isn’t him.” Aunt Bella hissed excitedly.
“You have some serious talent. Have you ever tried to sell your paintings?” Harry asked as he grabbed a ginger biscuit and dunked it in his tea like a neanderthal. It was oddly endearing.
Draco squared his shoulders and held his head high as he approached the entrance. He crouched down, spine still erect. If he was marching to his death, he would not let the last time his parents saw him be marred by cowering in fear. He crawled into the tunnel with as much dignity as he could. He was grateful when it turned into a steep slope, obscuring him from the other’s view. He heard his godfather move the crate back in front of the entrance and he gulped.
“You wish.” Harry replied without thinking. On a whim, he added “Care to dance?”
"I don't even know." He admitted in a dull tone. "Harry is angry with me for standing up for him, I guess?" He paused and then sighed. "That, or he's mad I almost attacked his Uncle."
In lieu of a ‘thank you’ Harry grabbed George and kissed him hard on the mouth. George’s hands immediately sought out his face, holding him there to make the kiss last longer. Harry didn’t mind. It made him feel desired.
"The stairs were pretty narrow." Harry nodded towards the still open door across the lobby. "If we can force them to chase us up the stairs we will gain the higher ground and be able to take them on two at a time."
“Oh?” Draco seemed dissatisfied by his single word answer.
"Right you are, Potter. Right you are."
“I should probably go. I’m sorry.” Harry grabbed the first shirt off the floor he found and put it on, fastening the buttons at an impressive rate.
Harry eyed the still rather large pile of paperwork yet to be finished disdainfully. If he had known being an Auror would require so much writing he might have chosen a different career.
“I do?” Draco arched an eyebrow at him, but he kept the smile on his face- for which Harry was strangely thankful.
He ran out to meet them.
“Ok.” He frowned. “I think I have it down. Muggle money for tokens, tokens for balls, balls for tickets, and tickets for prizes?”
“Hello, Dobby. How are you?” He tried to smile, but Harry had a feeling he didn’t quite manage it.
“Sorry, mate. We thought you’d be in there a bit longer.” Ron tugged on his earlobe in embarrassment.
“Because…” In his desperation to start looking for the missing horcrux, or at least to discuss with Ron and Hermione privately what their next move should be, Harry found it difficult to focus. His emotions were like a raging hurricane. “Dumbledore left the three of us a job to do, and he didn’t want us to tell-” he paused, trying to be diplomatic as possible “we’ve got to do it on our own, just the three of us.”
“This should be fun.” Draco took his place as Player 2 excitedly as the game started counting down to start the song.
“It is.” He hummed in agreement.
When the drinks were gone and everyone was pleasantly buggered they all walked out together into the welcoming breeze of a midsummers night.
Draco gave her a grateful grin before walking off the stage.
“Right, so why don’t I try one last time on my own. If I don’t get it in class today, I can take a mouthful of Felix and try again this evening.” He finally nodded, placing the potion vial in his front pocket.
“Can’t have our boyfriend going around being miserable all the time.” Fred agreed.
As always, huge shoutout to my amazing beta readers Precious Baby Puff Ari, my Queen of Angst, and SandZhark, my Accuracy Diety! They helped make this fic possible!
Absolutely nothing she just said made sense, and apparently Harry thought so too.
“Good morning, darling.” Harry murmured, sighing happily when Draco adjusted his position so that he could kiss him properly.
“Potter, Harry?” a pretty witch in violent green robes called with uncertainty. She squinted at the paper as if her file must be a mistake.
“What is it? What’s happened?” Harry glanced around as the room sealed itself.
At long last Draco sat up straight and cleared his throat.
A thoughtful look crossed his expression and Pansy tried to fix that in her memory. It wasn’t every day Ron Weasley looked thoughtful.
“She’s so meticulous. Even if you don’t even want something anymore she still has to do a thorough inspection and research.” Draco was relieved Harry had latched onto the safer topic.
“I can’t- I need out.” Draco shuddered in his arms. “You have to help me, please.”
“Oh, sorry.” Harry offered an awkward apology to the stranger before approaching the front counter.
He gently unpacked the set from the box and was surprised to see that the black pieces were covered in silver stars. It was beautiful. He looked in the box for a note but there was nothing except a strange white packing material that had been protecting the glass. It hurt his teeth when he accidentally rubbed it together and he shoved the box away in disgust. Why would anyone use that bizarre stuff when they could just use cushioning charms?
“Regardless of what he says, you will feel better after clearing the air.” She pressed.
She was running behind for her next friend-date.
“No, baby. It’s ok, just lay down. You’re pretty bad off.” Theo sounded like he was about to cry and Draco focused on him.
“Yet!” Ron called. “You have to account for your father’s corrupting influence!”
“Of course I do.” Potter snorted.
Harry shuffled down the stairs of the Burrow, rubbing the sands of sleep from his eye. It was much too early to be awake, but today was the wedding. Mrs. Weasley would skin him alive if he wasn't up to help with the preparations and Harry was loath to disappoint her. When he reached the kitchen he went straight for the kettle. It was still hot so he poured himself a steaming cup of his favorite tea, leaning against the counter as he let it steep. He was more than a little surprised to have the kitchen to himself. The house was currently packed to its breaking point with the wedding party all staying over.
“I didn’t question it.” He admitted reluctantly.
“I don’t-”
“That will take too long. I want you now. Release my hands.” Draco huffed, reaching over to his bedside table as soon as his hands were free and pulling out a small canister. He untwisted the cap with deft fingers and scooped out a generous amount of what Harry assumed was lube. He watched in fascination as Draco reached down to prepare himself. “Kiss me.” he demanded.
“Our food will be out in a few minutes. Do you want to find a place to sit?” Harry checked the long strip of paper in his hand.
“I don’t, actually.” Harry flushed.
"I- you, wait... what?" Harry sputtered, feeling his face turn bright red.
“I saw him forced to torture Death Eaters.” Harry corrected her, stressing the words ‘Death Eaters’ as if that made a difference.
“We are talking, Potter. That’s what it’s called when we make words with our mouths like this.” He scoffed.
“Bill Weasley? Your mead is exquisite.” Draco offered his hand.
"I guess I should let you go then?" Harry said sadly.
“Pans, I’m fine.” Draco whined as she force-fed him water.
“We could go see a movie or something.” Harry said thoughtfully, watching for Draco’s reaction.
“Then congratulations, you just had your first proper dance.”
Everything shattered all over again when Harry realized he wouldn’t.
“Those two are committing the greatest sin in broad daylight! I want them out of here!” She shrieked when the security officer reached her.
“Course not.” Theo snorted. “And I’m going to do you another favor and pretend you didn’t just insult me twice in a row.”
“Harry’s face.” Ron sniggered, turning to find Dean with a tray of six tall glasses filled with clear liquid and garnished with lime wheels and sprigs of mint.
“That works for me!” Pansy beamed, downing the rest of her drink.
“Where have you been? How come you’re not in your robes?” Ron looked him over with a scowl before grabbing for more potatoes.
"Good." She smiled at him.
“Do you think they can see through my glamor?”
“A few. They don’t sell nearly as well as the other pieces though.” Draco brushed the notion off.
Draco stared at him for a heart-stopping moment, then nodded curtly, motioning for Harry to lead the way. He glanced around and spied the balcony. A handful of people were just coming in which meant it would be relatively empty. Harry walked confidently towards it, hoping Draco would follow. There was a single couple snogging in one corner and Harry was pleased with the relative privacy. He paused for a moment, awestruck by the beauty of the grounds beneath them. He could see the glittering fairy pond and a vast expanse of forest stretching as far as the eye could see.
"Oh, Harry." She wrapped her arms around his middle and leaned her head against his in solidarity. "I've got you, you're safe."
“I got it from Peeves. You know, that song he made up in second year? ‘Oh Potter, you rotter’?”
“Alright, you asked for it!” Harry took a deep breath and started moving to the music, feeling awkward and out of sync. Draco stood back and watched with a devious stare.
"Out." Malfoy pointed at the fireplace behind them without breaking eye contact. "Both of you get out now. You can come back in twenty minutes."
“It looks amazing, Pans. Thank you.” He shot her a quick smile.
The trip to Bristol seemed to take much longer without Harry next to him. It was pathetic how everything seemed empty without his presence. He even had to turn off the stereo because he couldn't stand to listen to his Ed Sheeran CD when every song reminded him of Harry. This left Draco speeding down the motorway in silence with only his own thoughts for company. By the time he reached West Littleton the scalding burn of his wounded pride had cooled and he started to consider Harry's words from yesterday, turning them over in his head. He tried to abandon his bias and see things from Harry's perspective- how would he have reacted if he had been in Harry’s position?
“See ya, Harry.” She waved sadly before turning to walk back to Hogsmead, leaving him alone with Snape.
"I can't really picture you with piercings." Draco looked at him with polite consideration.
Draco just gazed at him helplessly for a moment before flinging himself into his lap and kissing him. Harry responded enthusiastically, smiling into the kiss.
Hey all! I am so sorry that this update is MASSIVELY late. My sister tried to commit suicide and I've been dealing with the shockwave of that. She is living with me now, she's safe and I am here to support her. Hopefully, chapters will start going back to their usual bi-weekly updates now that she is safe and being taken care of!
“Does he look angry?” Draco grimaced.
Pansy wasn’t sure when she became Hermione instead of Granger but did it really matter?
Do you know any good curse breakers?
“Yes, darling?’ Draco sauntered over to the hightop, one eyebrow cocked in unvoiced curiosity.
“Well, thanks then I suppose.”
“No, I think it’s cute.” Harry laughed.
“Maybe we should…” Harry shifted, trying to put a little distance between them.
The conversation fell back into a seamless balance of harmless teasing and plan making. By the time dessert came around (something called sopapillas), they had living arrangements all sorted. His parents would return to the manor, but Draco couldn’t bear it. Those walls only held memories of pain and misery for him now. Granger had offered to help him house hunt so that he could get his own place, which was rather unexpected but not altogether unwelcomed. For the next few nights, they would all be staying with her and Pansy until they could go shopping and get some fresh clothes and necessities.
"Now I'm curious. How many people have wined and dined The Chosen One?" Draco smirked, a little relieved that Harry seemed just as embarrassed as he felt.
Draco's posture was rigid, shoulders curled forward defensively, legs crossed and eyes downcast. Harry's Auror training from so many years ago suggested that Draco was avoiding something.
“I love you, be good.” His mother rose to give him a quick embrace.
“How was your weekend?” They grinned.
“How do you know about that?” Harry snapped, taking a defensive stance.
“You look...incredible.” Harry gave him a lopsided smile.
“Merlin, you gave me a heart attack.” Draco sighed, grabbing Harry’s cone and pushing his cup of cookie dough ice cream across the table. “Here, mine is most definitely almond-free.”
“Warning: There has been a breach. For your safety please remain calm and stay where you are until further notice. This is not a drill. Warning: There has been a breach. For your safety please remain calm and stay where you are until further notice. Thank you.”
It looked like she had invited all of the Quidditch teams from when he played at Hogwarts and a couple of Hufflepuffs they used to be friendly with as well. Luna Lovegood and Millicent Bulstrode arrived together and Draco immediately hugged both women. He was surprisingly pleased to see them. Most people had brought a bottle or two of alcohol as a housewarming gift and Draco happily added them to the mix of drinks on the table. If he had any leftover at the end of the night he would be shocked. After Cassius Warrington arrived and handed him a large bottle of top-shelf fire whiskey he searched for Pansy. How fortuitous that she was over by the drink table.
“You’re incorrigible.” Draco smiled, green eyes holding silver- only this time he was the one staring into fathomless pools of jade.
They tried out what Harry called a racing game next. These controls were much harder to use than the shooting game, but he gave it his best go anyway. Draco had a difficult time staying on course and kept crashing into the sides. At one point he even ran into Harry and knocked him off the track with him, but Harry still beat him on both games. He found that he didn’t mind losing to Harry, he was just happy to be playing and sharing something so trivial and simplistic with him. Harry showed him how to play foosball, at which he managed a narrow victory, and Harry helped him play single-player video games like Pac-man, Galaga, and Frogger. When their interest in the video games waned Harry suggested a couple of rounds of pinball. Draco quickly discovered that he did not enjoy the noisy contraption and decided to just watch Harry play.
“Everythings fine, thanks. Are we ready to start?” He looked at her expectantly.
This was the kind of challenge he enjoyed. His expression turned dark as his thoughts strayed to his biggest challenge. It was proving impossible to fix that bloody vanishing cabinet. The pressure of keeping his parents alive was overwhelming. He had to get the cabinet fixed and he had to kill Dumbledore. He didn’t want to think of the unspeakable horrors the Dark Lord would unleash if he didn’t succeed.
Despite their best efforts, time marched mercilessly on, and all too soon their session was over.
“What about you, Potter? Where has your date run off to?” Parkinson blushed, playfully pushing Nott away.
He didn’t see Harry again until double potions at the end of the day. Pansy shot him a knowing smile when they heard the Gryffindors descending the stairs, pulling out her damned magazine with a flourish.
Harry was sitting alone right where the waves kissed the sand, staring out at the sunset with his arms wrapped around his knees. He didn’t make any form of acknowledgment when Draco approached, appearing to be lost in thought.
Hello lovely readers! This chapter is where this fic kind of picks up the pace. We've got the third task to go and then everything changes. If anyone wants more information about things that happen, feel free to leave them in the comments. I have a separate series of one-shots and outtakes for this verse and I have no issues writing more to satisfy your curiosity!! As always a huge shout-out to my darling beta readers AlexClio and SandZhark! They bully me into writing, even when I don't feel like it.
He had to. There was no way he could be that good of an actor, right?
“How does it look?” Hermione sounded impatient.
"Really, the day we met?" Draco gave him a bemused smile.
“Why are you defending them? Didn’t you and Malfoy hate each other in school?” Seamus retorted.
“You know what? I’m glad you’re not my healer anymore.” Harry rallied his Gryffindor courage and prayed to Godric himself that he hadn’t misread the signs.
Damn those wide hazel eyes.
“Yes, well it was the only solution we could think of at the time.” Harry sniffed a little defensively.
Draco’s full lips pursed in a slight pout and Harry’s eyes were drawn to them. They looked soft and pliable and he wondered idly if they would feel as soft as they looked.
Harry
“Yeah, Pansy drug us out as well.” Nott laughed, wrapping his arm around her waist possessively.
“King Henry IV was the only king ever buried in this cathedral. He was so well respected that he and his second wife were immortalized in alabaster, forever on display for all of England to see.” Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist from behind and rested his chin on his shoulder.
“You feel pretty real.” Harry ran his thumb across Draco’s sharp cheekbones. Draco winced when he traced over a dark bruise that was still forming. “What happened to you?”
Harry couldn’t hide his smirk at how uncomfortable Ron looked. He was being pushed around the middle of the floor like a dust mop by McGonagall. George and Fred were shaking with silent laughter, leaning into one another for support.
Now was not the time for everyone to find out his best-kept secret.
“Good. Let the music flow through you. Just let go.” Draco’s voice sounded in his ear before he released his hips.
“Oh, I don’t know. Stuck with you isn't so bad.” Harry flashed him a hopeful smile.
Harry took care of the bill before anyone else could blink, taking his leave shortly after. The rest of them apparated together to a handsome villa in the countryside. He shot Pansy a quizzical look. It wasn’t really her style, but she just smiled and nodded for him to go inside.
"Er, it might be easiest to say we're dating." Harry felt his ears and the back of his neck burn.
“Out.”
“Why did you tell Rita Skeeter that I was, then?” Granger challenged and Pansy sighed.
“Harry, wait-” Draco implored, reaching out towards him. "Please stay?"
"Only until the Ministry stops benefitting him with their inane denial of his return." He scoffed, wrapping him in a warm hug as they sat there together.
“Yes?” He poked his head back in.
“Shite, are you alright?” He sounded worried.
“That is exactly what happened.” Draco gave her a tentative grin.
“Alright, fine.” He huffed, glaring at the magical window behind him. There was a beautiful view of the sea and Harry focused on the rolling waves instead of Malfoy’s carefully neutral expression. “I’m having a hard time getting some of my younger students to focus. I’m using the same curriculum I wrote when I first started and it seemed to work well the past few years. I don’t know what’s changed and it’s really frustrating.”
Harry let out an embarrassing moan at the feeling of Malfoy's lips on his. They were warm and soft and moved against his own so perfectly that the rest of reality seemed to melt away. It felt as if his world was on fire and the only people in existence were him and the abrasive blond that was currently snogging him senseless. When Malfoy deepened the kiss, tilting Harry’s chin for him with a gentle finger, Harry fully surrendered to the absurd situation. If he was going to only get one chance to kiss Draco Malfoy he was going to make it count. He slipped his fingers into Malfoy's silkly hair and tugged at it, pushing himself up onto his tiptoes when Malfoy tried to pull away. When he realized what Harry wanted he tangled his fingers in Harry’s hair and gave it a rough yank, eliciting a deep groan of satisfaction. Harry carded his fingers across Malfoy's scalp before allowing his hands to explore almost of their own accord. From his hair they moved down Malfoy's back, coming to rest over his arse. Malfoy groaned loudly when he gave it a firm squeeze and forcibly slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth. Harry leaned into the hot, open mouthed kiss, giving as good as he got until they were both disheveled and panting. When Malfoy pressed more firmly against him Harry realized he wasn't the only one with a ridiculously hard erection.
“Something like what?” He asked a little defensively.
“That’s brilliant!”  Ron grinned. “Why the bloody hell didn’t we think of that?”
“You think my life is perfect? You know NOTHING! You weren’t there when I was getting locked in a cupboard under my uncle’s stairs because something unexplainable happened. You weren’t there when I had to sneak food in the middle of the night because I had asked too many questions and got sent to the cupboard without dinner. You weren’t there when my cousin used me as his bloody punching bag and bullied any of the kids in school who dared to be nice to me. You don’t know what it's like to be despised by everyone in your family and not even know why. You’ve never had to feed your owl what little food you were given and live off the cheap broth for weeks just because you’re magical or be suddenly forced into a world you know nothing about where everyone already knows your name and expects great things from you because of something that you don’t even remember. You don’t understand what it feels like to be attacked by Voldemort twice before you’re even fully aware of who he is or what it feels like to be ostracised by the whole school because you can talk to snakes or fight a basilisk with your eyes closed while your friend’s life hangs in the balance. You’ve never had to fight off a hundred dementors at once before they got the chance to kiss you and the closest thing you have ever had to a parent or be forced to watch a classmate die just because he was there! You weren’t tortured in a graveyard and forced to duel Voldemort on a broken leg or attacked by the daily prophet for telling the truth or forced to use a sodding blood quill! You haven't had to watch all of your friends face death eaters knowing that you’re the one who put their lives in danger! You never had to watch your godfather be murdered right in front of you or be possessed by Voldemort or watch Dumbledore die or be responsible for Mad Eye’s death! You weren’t the reason Draco was forced to torture people or the reason your friends got captured and tortured for information about you! You didn’t have to carry out an impossible mission given to you by someone who only ever saw you as an expendable pawn or face your death wandless because you were the last Horcrux. You didn’t have to watch your first love die in battle or lose the only other person you love because being with him too fucking painful, or - or-” Harry couldn’t go on any longer.
When Malfoy  replaced his hands with his mouth Harry fell back onto his forearms with a visceral gasp.
"What, and pretend we're in a relationship whenever they're around?" Malfoy looked at him incredulously. "Oh no, I've read enough romance fiction to know how that ends."
The new position had brought their faces closer together and Draco took the opportunity to study Harry with no reservations. He looked impossibly peaceful. Draco managed to free one of his hands and he traced the rough lines of Harry's face. There was stubble decorating his jaw and his lips were drawn into a pout. Draco planted a soft kiss on them. He couldn't help himself. Harry sighed happily in response and snuggled closer, almost suffocating him.
They fell into easy conversation as they slowly unpacked the box. Harry had a million questions and for once Draco found that he didn’t mind answering them. When Harry removed his old dress robes something red flashed in his peripheral vision and his jaw dropped, leaving the sentence he had been in the middle of hanging in the air.
“You’re too late, you missed your chance. I overpowered Draco months ago. I took his wand from him before escaping the Manor,” Harry only had eyes for the Dark Lord once again, raising Draco’s wand in evidence.
They hadn't found a chance to catch up without his father around in almost two weeks. So much had happened Draco hardly knew where to start.
“I’m glad you came over.” Draco felt inexplicably shy all of the sudden and picked up the first thing his hands landed on out of the box.
“We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.” The single Slytherin that had joined the throng piped up. Harry thought her last name was Clio, but he couldn’t be sure.
“Mmm.” Harry hummed as he took another sip. “You take yours with one sugar and just a splash of milk.” He said knowingly.
“I saw what happened. Malfoy and Nott ran into you, not Pansy. So leave her alone, yeah?” Harry sounded like the Hufflepuff was trying his patience and Draco stared openly at him.
“Are you trying to be funny? Because if so, you’re not very good at it.” He snapped waspishly.
Hello Lovely Readers!
“Everyone was hoping to get Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes. “It's so strange that I don’t remember you.”
“You wish.” Draco smiled despite himself, leaning against Harry by unspoken compromise.
“Sorry, guess I was a bit distracted.” Harry blinked when they landed and gave him a sheepish grin.
“I came by to thank you for your wonderful housewarming gifts and I get assaulted.” He sighed dramatically. “Remind me to send a thank-you note instead next time.”
It was the strangest thing, but Harry was starting to not mind.
The drive back was spent in silent contemplation. If he ever wanted to settle down with someone- he desperately tried not to think about Harry, just someone- then he would need to tell his father eventually. What was he waiting for? The world to end? He was being a coward by continuing to lie and hide who he really is.
“Thank you.” He shot him a cheeky grin and Harry’s heart skipped a beat. “You look pretty fantastic yourself.”
“I did. I was actually surprised because I didn’t even audition for the role.” Draco smiled, reflecting back on when the cast list had been posted. It caused a bit of a stir when Madame Juliette had given two male dancers the lead roles, but she made the point that it was about damn time that the LGBTQ community had some representation on stage in the ballet.
“So what part of it isn’t living up to your expectations?” He demanded. Anger was coming to his defense now. “Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?”
“No, it’s alright. I’ll be fine.” He gave her his best smile.
“Was that alright?” Harry bit his lower lip anxiously.
Pansy sighed as she slipped yet another useless book back onto the shelf. How was a girl supposed to learn the secrets of nonverbal magic if none of the books in this damned school did more than mention it in passing? She was the only sixth year Slytherin to not have mastered it yet.
‘I will, but not here.” She glanced around suspiciously, speeding up.
"It's going to end with us actually dating. You know that, right?" Malfoy eyed him warily.
“We need to move!” Draco screamed but his voice was drowned out by an explosion nearby.
“Look,” Harry started, but he didn’t know what he could say to make them understand.
“I follow instructions, Potter.” Draco scoffed. “Something you seem to have immense difficulty with.”
“In the most basic sense, I suppose I am.”
Draco watched on in interest as Harry traded their tickets for a strange little thing Harry called a slinky and marveled at the odd plastic contraption as they stepped out into the blinding midday sun. Draco decided he quite liked arcades.
“I overreacted.” Harry grimaced.
“Incarcerous!” Zach cried, binding him before he could so much as blink.
"Oh, Draco." Daphne hummed in sympathy. "Did you two talk it out?"
Harry stared blankly at his reflection. With his teeth brushed there wasn’t much else to do. He looked haggard. There were dark circles beneath his eyes from all of the sleepless nights and his skin was starting to look pale from never going outside.
The Zoo was a lot more fun than Draco had originally expected. Teddy's excitement was infectious as he drug them from exhibit to exhibit. It was interesting to see all of the muggle animals. Draco was pleasantly surprised they could recreate arctic conditions for the penguins and polar bears. He was probably the most fascinated by them because he had never seen an arctic creature in person before.
“We can’t fully come back, sweetheart.” His mother said gently. “We aren’t meant for this plane anymore. We’re only an echo.”
Draco didn’t try to fight back at first. It was easier to let them have their petty revenge. He felt they were quite entitled to find their closure over the war. When familiar muggle trainers running towards the commotion caught his attention, however, he sighed.
“I’m a muggleborn. I don’t think Slytherin was ever an option for me.”
“Good luck then, both of you.” Harry said bracingly as they all stood together and headed towards the portrait hole.
“I know, Harry.” Kingsley pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. “I don’t like it any more than you do, but what else can we do? We took a lot of them at their word the last time this happened and a ludicrous number of loyal death eaters walked free. It’s become the standard procedure for any death eaters who try to plead innocent by imperious”
Lucius sobbed as his hands moved without his consent, ravaging his wife indiscriminately.
“You have the right to remain silent.” Harry moved toward the man. “Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to a fair trial in front of Wizengamot should you contest the charges placed against you. You have the right to appoint an arbiter to represent you. If you cannot afford an arbiter but still wish to be represented, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you?”
“Are you convinced you’re awake now?” Harry cocked a mischievous smirk and Draco had to look away to keep from laughing again.
Harry and a tall redhead Draco didn’t recognize had appeared ten feet away. Harry was wearing faded tattered jeans with holes in the knees and a dark red tee with the words ‘Pearl Jam’ plastered across the front in big letters. His hair was even messier than usual, but he looked excited and determined as they started to close the distance between them. The redhead was similarly dressed in faded jeans and a plain black tee that stretched across his considerable muscles. His long red hair was tied back in a loose ponytail and he had a dragon fang earring hanging from one ear. Three long scars cut across the middle of his left eye and reached all the way down to his lips, giving the impression of a permanent scowl. Far from being alarming, the scars made him look rugged and strong. Draco tried not to stare, but the curse breaker was hot.
-----------------------------
----------------------
Harry looked out over the field to where Ginny currently had the Quaffle, he was glad she was the new captain of the Quidditch team. She seemed to be a good pick for the spot as she was clearly very good at leading a team.
When he took his chances of turning back, Draco seemed to be glowing brighter, if that was even possible and it honestly hurt his eyes a bit. He decided he should probably try and focus back on his school work for the sake of both his grades and sanity.
"I got caught up with McGonagall. She caught Malfoy and I arguing in the hall."
"Woah, come check this out," Harry breathed.
"Hmm..."
"You're drooling," Harry said and then proceeded to laugh as he watched Draco turn bright red and rush to wipe his face, then finding nothing and proceeding to glare at Harry. "Only kidding. Hurry up and take off your clothes too."
"Oh, about that, I'm sorry. You know I only like you right?"
“Sorry!”
Draco's hands traveled down to the bottom of Harry's shirt and pulled it up slightly, his cool hands sliding under the fabric. A shiver went down Harry's spine and he moved his own hands to Draco's hips.
"Yeah, but it'd all be a lie," Dean put in. "It's not like they'd actually be getting along, and it's not like they can pretend to either. As you've noticed, they're not too good at that." Dean sent Harry a smirk and he turned slightly red.
October 9, 1998
Harry shifted his head to the side so he was looking at Draco with a lop-sided grin. Draco found himself grinning back before he could stop it. "You don't talk to your bed? Who here is really the crazy one?"
"I'm not! I'm just..."
"He never lets anyone have any fun, he took some of Ron's things he got from his brother's shop and now he has detention. I want to get them back," Harry said with a smirk.
He had taken one of the Patil twins in fourth year, but the whole thing was kind of a mess and he didn't want to put either of them through that again. All his friends had boyfriends and girlfriends now as well, so it wasn't like he could go with someone just as friends.
"Shit!" Harry cried out as Draco thrust into him at a different angle, "Right there," he said as Draco hit his prostate and his fingers curled into fists against the wall. Harry's back arched into Draco as he brought his hand down from the wall to grasp Harry's neglected erection, stroking him to each thrust.
"He has to know or it won't make any sense-" Hermione was saying when he sat down, interrupting her, "oh, hey Harry."
"Well, I don't like Luna now do I?" Harry laughed, "I'm more worried about telling him who I like, I guess. I mean, even if I just told him I was gay, he's bound to ask questions. I can't exactly tell him hey, you know Draco? The one who you hate so much? Yeah, he's the reason I'm gay."
"Truth or Dare?"
"I feel bad for whoever caught his fancy, he's a nightmare. I can only imagine what Harry has to put up with."
Narcissa took a deep breath, then hastened to do as she was told. She could feel her rage and fear simmering around the edges of the curse, trying to break through and free her. The Dark Lord, however, was too strong. His will dominated hers and she had no choice but to obey.
Then Harry’s words sank in and Draco’s breath hitched. Sure, they had been on a few dates and they fancied each other, but they hadn’t explicitly stated that they were dating yet. He didn’t know if it was too soon to put labels on it and he hadn’t wanted to make Harry uncomfortable by pressing the issue.
"Have to uphold the family honor." He rolled his eyes at Theo.
"We were the embodiment of Pureblood ideals, and for that reason, we maintained our distance from you. I'm sure you've heard about my father's unfortunate circumstances after the first war…" Draco grimaced as he thought back to that time. He much preferred his parents as they are now.
“No idea.” Malfoy seemed oddly amused.
“The arrows will scroll up the screen and when it reaches the top you step on the corresponding arrow on the platform.” Harry fiddled with the controls.
“Hating you for it would have been pointless.” He said simply.
“No, sir.” Harry shook his head. “We’ve been doing our best to ignore her.”
“You hurt him, Draco! Of course he was upset!” She snarled.
“Like what?”
He almost felt happy.
“You’re not scared of heights, are you?” Harry ducked under the rope to join him.
“Mr. Potter! We weren’t expecting you.” The Head of Magical Law Enforcement greeted him genially.
“Ep-episky!” He cried, patching up the raw skin as best he could. He fell back against the wall, tears blurring his vision. “Vincent…”
“Draco means a lot to me, and I know he has a history and a bit of a reputation, but he is one of the most genuine people I have ever met and I want to make sure you aren’t stringing him along or toying with his emotions. He deserves better than that.” Ari held his gaze.
Draco turned and followed the tail end of the crowd through the castle doors and into the Great hall. Small duels had broken out here and there, but the most ferocious battles took center stage in the middle of the hall.
“I was actually about to head out.” Harry said dully. Not like it mattered. It never did to these people.
"Episkey." She swished her wand.
He couldn’t shake this overwhelming anxiety. The first sign of movement caught Draco’s eye. Both Karkarof and Snape had flinched involuntarily. Karkaroff got up without a word and left the arena at a very brisk pace. Snape looked like he was about to be sick.
“So we brought you some Tai takeaway-” Fred started unpacking the food while George continued to pull more items out.
“The bloody idiot used gilly weed! There is never a guarantee of how long it will last! What was he thinking?” He hissed to her out of the side of his mouth.
“Oh I love it, it really makes the whole outfit better.” Hermione smirked.
No one could cure his depression. Deep down he knew that, but nights like this came pretty damn close.
"That sounds like torture." Harry looked up at him with a grave expression.
“That girl usually is.” His mother laughed.
Harry took over as Player 1 and started scrolling through the song selections while he tried to explain the rules.
Here went nothing.
The crowd seemed to take offense to that, but Harry had finally arrived in all of his glory.
“You was not home last night. Is everything good?” The elf looked up adoringly from beneath Harry’s hand which was still scratching his ear.
“What is it, Potter? Where does it hurt?” She rushed over to him, tartan dressing gown trailing behind her
"Fuck, Potter I'm going to cum." Malfoy was breathless.
“You stay right there and you think about Theo, alone and scared and suffering from a broken heart. I’ll come to release you at my discretion.” She said cooly before strolling out of the room as if she didn’t have a care in the world.
“Well? Do you like it?” Pansy huffed impatiently.
“You’re joking, right?” Harry snorted as he set Draco’s presents on his kitchen table and tied the balloons to the back of one of the chairs. “I’m pretty sure I’ve known when your birthday was since first year.”
“You know about my sketchbook?” His voice jumped about six octaves. Art was not something a good pureblood wasted time on. His father had drilled that into him from a very young age. His mother, however, had kept slipping him contraband art supplies while his father was otherwise occupied. She had always been supportive of anything that made Draco happy.
“I know, I’m sorry. Ron wouldn’t shut up.” Harry flushed as he settled in.
“Then I’ll get something you do like and we can switch.” Draco poured himself more coffee.
“Do you want me to escort this scum off the premises?” Blaise cracked his knuckles ominously.
He was awed by how much effort they went through to pull this little date together.
“I’ll drink to that.” Draco smirked before taking a tentative sip. “It’s rather good. Bill and George made this?”
“He willingly gave you his wand?” An old, wizened wizard squeaked in surprise.
“Who was it?” She frowned, pulling out her wand. She waved it quickly and a massive silvery four-legged creature erupted from the tip before cantering off towards Hogwarts.
“Yes.” Potter’s reply was equally quiet and her fingers spasmed, driving her nails into his chest before she drew them back. She pushed herself up and away from the boy.
The penguins, however, were simply magnificent. There was just something incredibly soothing about watching them swim around and play with each other.
“I can do this.” He breathed.
"You're going to have to try a little harder than that." Draco arched an elegant eyebrow at him sardonically.
“What are your symptoms?” Hermione frowned, pulling out her wand.
“Started liking you? I think so.” Harry didn’t have any trouble understanding his half-formed sentence. “The more I think about it though…”
“Really?”
Harry shot him a scathing look as he herded Harry towards the great hall.
“Did you have somewhere in mind, or am I allowed to pick the breakfast spot?”
“Yes.”
"I could go for just about anything." Draco shrugged.
“I was sending word to the castle that I’ve got you so they don’t worry." Her demeanor was still aloof and distracted.
He frantically looked around at his blurry surroundings, searching for Draco until he realized he was laying on Sirius’s old bed. He had taken over Sirius’s room while they stayed at Grimmauld Place. Even though he had hated this house, the room still had a trace of Sirius’s rebellious spirit and it made Harry feel closer to him.
“Unfortunately, in the media world, it is. I don’t buy into any of that anymore, though. It was very wrong to have lied about you….and Potter to Skeeter and I truly am sorry. I wasn’t trying to- I just….” Pansy took a deep breath. She hadn’t intended on making amends with Granger, but now that it was happening she wanted to do it right. “There is no excuse for the way I treated you. All I can do is apologize.”
The way Malfoy moved was almost fluid. It was strangely attractive.
Panic trickled slowly into his awareness, making him feel numb. Harry couldn’t dance. The Dursleys would never pay for lessons and of course Aunt Petunia had never bothered to teach him. Dancing was not the kind of activity they approved of. Now Professor McGonagall was telling him he had to open the Yule Ball and dance in front of the whole school?
Harry just looked at them mutely. He couldn't find the words to speak. Pain burned behind his eyes and his brain felt like it had just stuck a metal fork in a plug. Ron was too busy shoving food into his mouth, as usual, but he made prolonged eye contact with Hermione. He saw the intuition flash in her eyes when she understood what he was trying to say without words.
Draco shuddered at the thought and things started clicking into place.
“Cheers.” Harry grinned, taking the bottle from him and drinking an impressive amount without making a face.
“That would be fantastic.” Ari grinned.
They did have fun, he supposed. There were numerous bonding opportunities as they traveled across the continent together. There were quiet moments shared on a pier, a few night time excursions to famous pubs, and a convenient carnival that they were able to visit. Draco had never been to one before. It was a fantastic experience. They even shared stories from their pasts; tragic backstories Hermione called them. By the time he settled on a modest bi-level beach house on the coast of Rye, he felt he could honestly call Hermione Granger a good friend, if not one of his best friends.
“You just want to mop the floor with the lot of us again.” Neville accused, somewhat ruining the effect with his wide, innocent eyes.
There. Work was safe and impersonal. Let him make of that what he will.
“Really? You started liking me at my housewarming party?” Draco’s expression was unreadable.
“Yes, Victor and I are.” She sighed.
Before Draco could think of an appropriate response a loud voice crackled over the PA system, issuing instructions on how to safely mount and dismount from the moving pods. They turned just in time to see a pod coming into the bay and people hopping on as it glided down the track. Taking a leap of faith was nothing new to the ex-Hogwarts students, they had had plenty of practice running onto platform 9 ¾, and they jumped gracefully from the loading platform into the elongated glass dome. Not everyone was as swift or agile, and Draco was delighted when the doors closed, sending their pod sailing into the open air at only half capacity. It allowed everyone on board to spread out and the extra breathing room was wonderful.
“I know he doesn’t like electronics, which is too bad because this would be perfect. You should have seen the work we put in to make his house electricity-free.” She was rambling and Harry guiltily tried to catch up.
“I’m sorry.” Harry whispered.
"My hero." He teased.
Harry took a deep breath, shifting the large box in his arms till he was able to knock on the non-descript grey door.
“I did?” Draco smirked.
“I don’t need to defend my career choices to you!” Harry bit angrily.
"I need your help." He fidgeted with the envelope in his hands.
Harry raised his wand and cast the torture curse, causing Draco to bounce his head off the polished wood. He ended the spell a moment later.
“My mother is the editor in chief of Witch Weekly and she told me to cooperate with Skeeter and give her whatever juicy story Skeeter thought would sell. It wasn’t personal, it was just good business.”
“You have the right to remain silent,” Harry repeated, grabbing the ropes and jerking the perp to his feet. “I suggest you exercise it.”
“That you like me.” Harry's emerald eyes were still alight with wild desire.
“It’s the elephant in the room.” Harry explained. “Our shared past is like a constant elephant in the room that we never really mention. We pretend like it isn’t there- like it doesn’t matter, but it does. We still went through it. Yet here we are, a year later. I’m really glad we’re friends now, so the elephant is a reminder of everything we’ve overcome to get to this point.”
“I noticed Harry hasn’t been by to help you in the gardens lately. Did you two have a disagreement?” Lucius tactfully changed the subject.
“Enough of these childish distractions!” The Dark Lord shrieked. “Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to us. We both no longer have our connected cores. Tonight we duel on skill alone. Once I kill you, I will kill Draco Malfoy.” he sneered.
Draco turned at the sound of his name and was somewhat relieved to see Madame Juliette walking towards him.
“What info-”
“That Potter is your mystery man? Yes, I figured that out.” Ari chuckled. “Go on, you crazy kids. I can manage closing up on my own.” When Draco hesitated with a torn expression he shoved him towards Potter playfully. “Go have fun, you have my blessing.”
A large, comfortable-looking couch appeared directly behind Draco and Harry pulled him over to it, sinking onto the squashy cushions with Draco on his lap. He played with his hair and rubbed his back as Draco continued to cry, murmuring empty words of comfort as Draco soaked his shirt with tears. Eventually, Draco quieted and shifted his position so that they were properly cuddling instead of having Harry just hold him.
“No one told me you were funny.” He managed to gasp out.
Maybe he simply didn’t have a home. It wouldn’t be the first time he has lacked something everyone else already had.
It didn't work.
“Freshen yourselves up.” The Dark Lord hissed gleefully. “I think it is finally time for this silly little game to come to an end. Potter dies tonight and I want you all to look your best.”
“OUT!” Pansy growled, slamming the door in their snickering faces. She could feel the blood boiling beneath her cheeks. Of course they would out her in front of Hermione. She did just threaten their precious hair, after all. She took a calming breath before turning back to Hermione who looked amused rather than angry. “Sorry about them. They don’t know when to shut up.”
“I’m not, really. I just got lucky.” Harry mumbled.
He briefly considered just putting his t-shirt and jeans back on and telling her to stuff it, but thought better of it. She would probably murder him and make it look like an accident. He did as instructed, letting her dictate what shirts to put on with good grace until she was satisfied. They ended up buying the shorts, a sand-colored graphic tank with a depiction of the Kraken taking down a pirate ship on it, and a different colored teal button-down that was more greenish-blue than blueish-green. She had tried to talk him into buying a shark tooth necklace to ‘tie the whole outfit together’, but he had put his foot down on jewelry. There was only so much a man could be expected to take.
“You and Krum are still doing long-distance, right?”
Today was not one of those days.
“Pansy. Call me Pansy. At least for tonight… Harry.” She cut him off, making an odd face when she said his name.
“It’s horrid, isn’t it? I’ve never used paint before. I don’t even know what a painting is supposed to look like if it’s not a portrait or landscape.” he scratched his nose nervously as she gazed quietly at the canvas.
Smut will become an increasingly regular occurrence from this point in the story on. It won't be porn with a plot, as much as I appreciate those fics. This will be more plot with porn. You have been warned.
“We noticed, mate.” Bill reached over and put a reassuring hand on Harry’s knee. “It’s alright to need some time to yourself. We missed you, is all.”
"That was good, though. Everyone falls." Harry ignored him.
“Do you believe you should be pardoned?” Irys cut the wizard off, much to Narcissa’s relief.
“Are you trying to tell me you’re royalty?” Harry wasn’t sure if he should be in awe or be amused, so he went for both.
Ron had been splinched and was in a perpetually foul mood, Hermione’s temper was shorter than usual, and Harry wasn’t feeling very optimistic about their situation. They had reclaimed the locket, but still had no way to destroy the damn thing.
Longbottom grabbed at the sword and swung around, brandishing it at the Dark Lord. He laughed as he deflected the blow, sending the sword flying. It landed roughly ten feet away from where Draco stood and he looked over at Harry. He was still laying as still as a stone at the Dark Lord’s feet. He had said the snake was the last Horcrux. If he killed the snake, the Dark Lord would be mortal once more.
“Quick, in here.” Harry pulled him into the small space, shutting the door as quietly as possible.
“Harry running late?” Seamus asked as he slid into the booth next to Dean.
Harry jerked awake drenched in sweat. It wasn't a dream. His scar felt as if a thousand torches were burning beneath it and Harry thrashed in pain. His covers were all twisted around him and he shivered from the cold sweat coating his body.  He could hear voices in the distance.
His thoughts strayed to the snitch Dumbledore had left him and he was filled with resentment.
His thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of Kingsley’s Patronus.
“Ow. You made the room spin.” He griped, managing to pull himself halfway up before collapsing back onto the shower floor.
“Hold on, Master Regulus, as in Regulus Black? The Death Eater that disappeared without a trace?”
“That’s not the same thing.” Draco said icily, completely shutting down at the mention of his father.
“You don’t have to” Harry protested but a glare from Draco cut him off.
He had gone from Undesirable Number One to Hero of the Wizarding world, and quite frankly he wasn’t sure which was worse. At least there were no dementors present this time.
“Are you sure?” Harry read the info printed on the tickets, noting that the show time was seven o’clock. That didn’t leave him a lot of time to clean up and get ready.
He had successfully managed to escape attending the first half of trials, but he had asked Kingsley to alert him when the Malfoys were next on the docket. Why did it have to be today of all days? More importantly, why had it taken the Ministry almost a year to try the Malfoy family?
“Working hard, unfortunately.” Harry rolled his eyes.
“Parkinson-”
“How did you manage to put this all together?” Draco immediately set to work unwrapping the dishes of snacks.
The guard gave him a gentle prod and Lucius nodded curtly at him. They were fortunate that Gerald had been the one to escort them today. He was the most sympathetic of all their guards and Lucius greatly appreciated the man. He approached the high table cautiously. He had been on the receiving end of the ex-auror’s wand one too many times.
Fred caught his gaze and Harry was trapped in a kaleidoscope of gold and brown.
Harry faded into the realm of unconsciousness and he found himself suddenly sitting at a long table in a dimly lit dining room. Firelight flickered from torches set in golden brackets on the walls, casting an eerie glow. He glanced around and was mildly alarmed to see Death Eaters all around him until a pale face caught his eye.
“I don’t think I will ever come to fully understand Harry James Potter. Every time I think I have him figured out he does something to throw me off.”
“Er, sure?” Harry let go of Pansy’s waist gratefully, stepping back to allow Nott to take over.
This wasn’t like any of their previous kisses, sweet and full of promise. This kiss burned with passion and a desire he had never felt from Harry before. Draco’s body reacted before his mind even had a chance to catch up and he found himself kissing Harry back. For one shining moment nothing else existed but them.
“Not if I can help it!” Draco’s faint voice managed to escape before the heavy stockroom door closed behind him.
"Oi, I resent that!" Harry cried in mock outrage. "I'm not that much of a klutz!"
“That was a difficult shot, you did fine.” He smiled warmly at him. Neville rolled his eyes but grinned back.
"You've dated before though." Harry seemed uncertain. "Haven't you?"
“Come on, we better get going before the rest of them show up.” Ron’s voice faltered only for a moment.
“Bloody idiot saved Delacour’s treasure too.” He groaned. Half giddy with relief and half furious at the fool of a Gryffindor.

“Somewhere near here…” Harry’s voice rang out a few feet ahead and Draco almost felt hopeful. If he were the one to capture Harry, he could help him escape.
“What on earth is a chili relleno?” his mother asked, drawing the attention away from him. He shot her a grateful look and she smiled back.
Harry's nose and cheekbones were throbbing, and his body felt as if it were made of lead. The fall from the luggage rack to the floor probably left a couple of good bruises. He winced at the pain but was still able to be amused that Tonks had just accomplished jumping out of a moving train gracefully.
“I honestly can’t thank you boys enough for doing this. I put in a request with the Ministry ages ago, but they keep telling me my application is pending approval.” His father scoffed.
“Yes! It will help you save your Wheezy!” Dobby’s ears wiggled in delight as Harry grabbed the gilly weed from him.
“What, already?” Draco looked towards the kitchen in surprise.
Move your wand in a figure-eight motion across the infected area while repeating the incantation until the wound is fully healed.
“I don’t know.” Draco whispered, staring resolutely at the table.
“They slaughtered us.” Seamus gaped at the six striped balls that were still on the table.
They ended up playing two more games before moving on. Draco had won both times and was feeling a little smug. When Harry brought him over to a strange box with moving pictures and funny music he lost some of his confidence. Harry explained very patiently what video games were and how they worked before pulling a bright red wand-like object out of its slot and handing it to Draco. He informed him that the plastic thing was called a gun and that to use it he needed to click the small movable piece called the trigger. When Draco felt comfortable working the gun Harry put the required tokens into the machine and told him to shoot any animal that came across the screen. During the first half of the game, Draco failed miserably. Once he got the hang of it, however, his score improved drastically. When the game was over Draco immediately demanded they play again and Harry was more than happy to comply. After three more games, they decided to call it quits because they were too evenly matched to declare a true victor. A strange sense of contentment settled over him as Harry towed him eagerly across the arcade and Draco was mildly surprised to discover that he was genuinely having fun- not just because Harry was having fun, but actually enjoying himself for the first time in years.
Draco leaned into his touch, closing his eyes as Harry cupped his face.
Harry felt something latch onto his cloak.
“Excellent idea, Narcissa.” Pansy simpered, offering Hermione her arm as an escort while Draco offered his own arm to his mother.
“Thanks, mate.” Harry reached out and patted his shoulder.
“I love it.” Draco assured him.
The group of people around them that had seen what happened burst into polite applause, causing Harry to look over. He made eye contact with Draco’s father and gave him a curt nod before turning back to the Dark Lord.
"Something like that, yeah." Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair, relishing in the feel of it.
“Don’t call me that!” Harry hissed. “I’m Barny Weasley right now. No one can know I’m here.”
“My life isn’t perfect.” He spat dangerously. Hermione took a step back and he felt slightly vindicated.
“Grab my hand!” Harry yelled, stretching his arm out towards him- but he was too far away.
“What?”
He couldn’t think of anything to say at first. He was too mesmerized by how much brighter his eyes looked against the black eyeliner.
“It looks like I accidentally knocked one of yours in, so I suppose it’s your turn.” Draco looked up with a much too innocent expression.
“Do I have to go?” He asked wearily.
An agonizing scream pierced the night and Harry’s blood turned to ice in his veins.
“For the most part. There are multiple copies of a lot of albums so that more than one person can buy it.” Harry led him down the closest aisle and started thumbing through the bin of records. “Look, they’re alphabetized by band.”
Draco let out a tiny sigh before snuggling closer, pressing his face to the base of Harry's throat. Draco was practically draped across him, half covered by the sheet. Their legs were impossibly tangled together and Draco’s arm was flung possessively across Harry’s waist. He had somehow ended up with most of his torso on Harry’s chest, pinning him to the mattress but Harry didn't mind. He ducked his head to kiss Draco’s soft hair ever so gently.
Draco looked exhausted.
Somehow he felt that if he tried to say something to her he would break down right then and there. He did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks’s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them.
“Right under your nose.” He confirmed as nonchalantly as he could.
"You alright, mate?" He bent his head towards Harry's in an effort to not draw attention to them.
Harry snorted at that.
Harry was dead.
Draco had his back turned as he ordered a drink at the bar, however, and Theo slipped into the darkest booth he could find. He wouldn’t be run out of a warm place to sit by the likes of Draco Malfoy.
A small shiver ran up his spine. This was neither the time, nor place, but the way Harry had said his name sent a small thrill through him. He clenched his fist around the wand he had won from one of the Death Eaters that had been staying at the Manor.
It felt like it wanted to explode. Every second that passed felt like an eternity. Eventually, Harry recognized it as one of the signs of a panic attack. Sirius had warned him about them after the hearing. He closed his eyes and tried to focus on something he could physically feel. His hair was beneath his fingers and he took a moment to focus on how it felt. He could hear his own ragged breathing and he listened to it, focusing on calming it down. He managed to get a tentative hold on himself before Neville returned with a clearly recently woken McGonagall on his heels.
Harry pulled away with a sigh, settling next to Draco on the couch. He rubbed his face with his hands as he tried to find the words.
“When you weren’t here on time I figured you must be having a rough day, so I ordered for you.”
They both had unknowingly been masters of the Elder wand. They both had handed it over freely to Harry.
“You might like today’s featured story.” He looked like a cat that had caught the canary.
"But what if you think bad thoughts or you hurt someone? Surely you can't still be a good person…." Harry trailed off. He had bad thoughts all too often lately.
“Thank you, I try.” She grinned. “I’ll get that right in for you.”
“It’s good to see you too.” She patted his cheek affectionately before turning to face the girls and rubbing her hands together excitedly. “Alright! Why don’t we all go out to the beach and get this party started?”
“Yeah, alright.” Draco gave in, his heart feeling like it was trying to twist itself into a pretzel at the prospect of facing Harry’s old dorm mates.
“It’s never-ending.” Harry sighed.
"Oh, Harry." Sirius gave him an understanding smile. "The concept of 'good and evil' is not a broad enough spectrum for morality. The world is a complex place filled with complex people. No one is completely 'good' just as no one is completely 'evil.' Everyone has the capacity to do good or bad deeds, or even morally grey ones. Sometimes you’re going to have to be the villain in someone else's story, just don’t forget to be the hero in yours.” Sirius was pacing, the background of the mirror was constantly shifting.
“Ok, I think the coast is clear.” He slowly opened the door, peering cautiously into the hall.
His heart began pounding an erratic rhythm in his chest, pumping faster the more he thought about his death. It was ironic. His heart seemed to be trying to get a lifetime's worth of beating out before he sacrificed himself.
“You won’t get anything from me! You bastards are wasting your time!” Thranduil continued, struggling against his restraints.
“This is a quaint little place, isn’t it?” His father marveled as the hostess showed them to a large booth and took their drink orders.
Harry heard rather than saw when the last six came crashing in after them. When he reached the first landing Harry turned and fired off a barrage of spells and added a classic expelliarmus for good measure. He saw Zach cast a few solid body binds and stunners themself and let out an involuntary cheer when three more men went down.
He led Harry into his kitchen, throwing his suit jacket over the nearest chair while Harry sat down. He was staring at the floor with unseeing eyes and Draco’s worry increased. He put the kettle on first before taking out all the makings for a sandwich.
“You wanted me to find them.” It wasn’t a question.
“Then what happened?” the witch pressed.
Godric, how did anyone do this? How did normal people deal with uncertainty?
“The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Weasley. I have a quick breakfast prepared for you inside if you would like to follow me.” His mother gave them one last gracious smile before heading back down the drive, not bothering to check if they were following.
Both of them whimpered in pleasure when their bare cocks were pressed together between their bodies. Harry ground his hips against Draco’s in a desperate search for the friction his body was clamoring for. Draco groaned, reclaiming dominance and throwing him into the wall a little farther down the hall. Harry didn’t mind, letting out a lecherous moan as Draco rutted against him.
They simply poured from his mouth without any consideration on his part. How in the blazes had Draco managed to be so evasive when talking about Potter? He couldn’t help but feel it was a futile effort. Anyone with half a brain could plainly see how those two boys felt about each other. Did they think everyone went around pining after their enemies? It was laughable. They were taking turns avoiding the other’s gaze at the moment and it was all Lucius could do to not roll his eyes.
She marched purposefully towards his closet and rummaged through his things. Harry didn’t bother to try and stop her. She was under the impression that he couldn’t dress himself properly and always insisted on picking out his outfits for these Ministry functions. She tossed a pristine silver button-up that she had given him for Christmas and some comfortable looking dark denim jeans at him, merely pointing at his ensuite bathroom. Harry hung his head in defeat as he shuffled his way past them.
“Sod the world?” Draco smiled weakly.
“Yes. You really pulled out all the stops in third year. Mock performances of me passing out whenever I entered the Great Hall, dressing up as dementors with your friends and storming the quidditch pitch while I was playing, hamming up the cut you got from Buckbeak and getting him sentenced to death just because he liked me more than he liked you- you really outdid yourself.” Harry tried to keep his tone light and teasing so Draco didn’t get offended.
“Right. Thank you, Hermione.” He smiled, sinking gratefully onto the queen mattress.
“Well, I have to be by my mirror to answer your call, but I’ll always be able to hear you when you call it. And yours works the same way, it’s like an instant message system.”
“You’re the only one who can kill him.” Draco choked. “The others- he has the others out looking for you- you need to hide! They have orders to leave you alive, but I-”
“What?” Harry looked alarmed.
“I never imagined this was possible.” Harry all but whispered, gazing up at him with a faint smirk.
As the coffee and tea were brewing she quickly cleared up their litter from last night and collapsed the empty box, setting it by the rubbish bin to take out later. It was just bizarre for Draco to leave any type of mess. It made her weirdly uncomfortable. After she reset the tea tray with all of the makings for morning tea and coffee she carried it quietly into the living room and placed it in the center of the coffee table.
Godric, what was happening? The way Draco’s eyes glinted with amusement and his lips curved made his heart stutter.
An explosion shook the entire building and Harry couldn’t help but grin appreciatively at Zach’s all-or-nothing approach. He quickly dismantled the ward on the door and burst into the lobby, shooting off stunners at the henchmen running around trying to defend their leader. He took three down by the time Zach appeared through the smoke of the explosion, easily finishing off another two.
Shell Cottage was much as he remembered it; quaint, cozy, and filled with love. He had come over to ask a favor, but Bill and Fleur both insisted on feeding him and catching up before he was allowed to talk business. Dinner was a simple affair of roast and potatoes, and Fleur made a cherry pie from scratch with the cherries that grew in their garden. Apparently being pregnant made her want to bake. After Harry was stuffed and couldn’t eat another bite they all retired to the living room with drinks. Harry and Bill enjoyed the fruits of Bill’s latest batch of mead and Fleur had poured grape juice into a wine glass so she didn’t feel left out.
“That concludes the witness questioning. The Wizengamot will adjourn for deliberations.”
Harry gently closed his eyes with his fingers, just as Luna had done for Dobby, and grabbed him underneath the armpits.  Ron and Percy each grabbed a leg and together they carried him into an abandoned classroom. They set him behind the professor’s desk, where he would be the safest, and Harry had to physically force himself not to stare. He could almost be sleeping.
“Go home then!” Harry gestured towards the tent entrance.
“Yeah, alright. Thanks.” Potter sounded uncomfortable all a sudden and Pansy frowned.
“I know you didn’t. It’s alright, I’ve got you. Everything is going to be okay.” She kissed his hair when he bent his head so that he could rest it on her shoulder.
“He gets his stubborn streak from his mother.” Andromeda said wistfully.
Snape kept droning on but Harry was done listening. He didn't really care about what Snape thought. His heart ached from thinking about Sirius too long so he turned his thoughts back to Malfoy and what he had heard before he was discovered and petrified. Based on Malfoy's bragging it almost sounded as if…
“Right. ‘Hey Potter, I know we hate each other but do you want to go to the ball with me?’ Yeah, that would go over well.” He rolled his eyes, trying not to think about what it would be like to actually go to the ball with Harry.
“I’m glad.” Harry whispered, pressing a quick kiss to the side of his head before letting him go.
“I am not shallow!” Harry whined indignantly.
“Does it matter?” He focused his gaze on the lake, purposefully avoiding both Theo and Pansy’s eyes.
“Did he? How charming.” His father sounded amused.
“It is not.” Harry laughed. When Draco looked at him like he might be crazy Harry realized he meant it. “Come on, you have to know that’s not true. You were the master of the Elder wand at one point.”
“What are those?” Draco couldn’t quell his curiosity.
Harry’s heart sank. If Snape was pleased that meant he was in for a bad night.
He knew Blaise wasn’t trying to be malicious. He just enjoyed being the center of attention, but it irked Draco regardless. He shoved Blaise's ankle off his shoulder and used him to steady himself while he stretched his hamstrings.
“Ah, I see. You are afraid to act until they join you?” Dumbledore’s voice gave no sign of weakness, confusing Draco even further.
“Thank you, Master Draco. Master Harry.”
A commotion behind them broke Draco out of his daydream and they both turned to see what was going on.
“It’s a tea set. It’s not like I’m buying him a Ferrari or anything. I can spend a little extra, he doesn’t need to  know how much it cost.” Harry looked at the fragile box in his hands with a strange emotion stirring in his chest.
"Brilliant. I've always wanted to go there." Draco gave his hand an affectionate squeeze as they searched for a quiet place to apparate.
“Ah, yes. I can understand that.” Draco toyed with the fire whiskey bottle awkwardly. “That must be the last thing you ever want to talk about.”
“I- that’s not the same! You’re my best mate, I’d be more likely to laugh at you.” He said stubbornly.
He didn’t want to do this.
“Sleep well.” She beamed back at him.
Draco braced for the upcoming duets, counting out his steps instead of focusing on Harry. The enforced eye contact and delicate intimacy was brutal, but at least Harry seemed to be trying too. They still danced flawlessly together despite the awkwardness between them. Draco was almost impressed that Harry seemed to be equally determined to put their personal issues aside and perform his role to the best of his abilities. It took every shred of effort he had to pretend like playing Harry’s love interest didn’t cut like a knife, but by the time the final notes hung in the air Draco was fairly certain there would be no complaints about lack of passion today. When Madame Juliette broke into applause he let Harry go so quickly he almost fell.
He was alone.
“I came with the head of magical transportation. He’s a regular down at the shop! Turns out he wasn’t really there for the jokes.” George beamed happily.
“You don’t think I’m pathetic?” Harry was starting to sound more confident and less anxious.
Pansy opened her mouth to say something but movement from the lake cut her off. Fleur Delacour had broken the surface, ending her bubblehead charm as she swam to shore. Draco couldn’t help but notice a distinct lack of a missing object.
"I needed space to think so I drove to Bristol. I'm sorry I didn't contact you, I wasn't thinking." He held her tightly.
The girl told him his total and took his money while Draco watched a muggle walk up to the strange wall machine and placed a cup under it. When the muggle pressed the cup into one of the hanging sticks it dispensed some form of liquid with a mechanical hiss. Draco stared in fascination as they put the lid back on their cup and immediately took a drink, wandering back over to their table.
Parkinson was glancing from Draco to him and back before dawning comprehension ignited in her eyes.
Theo sat down next to him and pulled him in for a hug.
“The Dark Lord cast the curse himself.”
Pansy looked up to try and gauge her reaction. Her face gave nothing away, which was infuriating. They sat in silence for a long moment, facing each other with their legs tucked neatly underneath them before Pansy sighed.
“I’m not scared.” He snapped, raising his wand once more.”You should be though.”
“I’m sorry?” Potter looked taken aback, his green eyes wide with surprise.
Hello my lovely readers! Chapter three is a bit of calm before the storm, so take a deep breath and dive in! I want to give a massive shout-out to AlexClio and SandZhark for being fantastic beta readers. They push me to keep writing and to keep getting better. This fic would not be the same without them!
“What? That I’m a bitch? Absolutely.” Pansy huffed, staring at her hands.
“I dunno.” Harry shrugged. “Just...not into it today, I guess.”
“It sliced me from shoulder to navel and the next thing I knew I was laying in a pool of my own blood with Professor Snape hovering over me, casting a complicated counter curse.” Draco pulled the collar of his robes down to show the beginnings of a diagonal scar that stretched across his entire torso.
Once she had the information she was after she stunned the lot of them and rounded on the Malfoys that were gathered around her.
It had begun.
Everything seemed sharper, more vibrant. It was as if all of his senses were determined to work to the fullest extent of their abilities before they ceased forever. He could see everything in sharp relief as if he had just gotten a new pair of glasses. He could see the individual leaves on the trees. Everything looked ominous and foreboding in the pale moonlight. He could feel the crunch of wet grass and twigs beneath his feet. He could hear the wind and the distant shouts as people found more survivors back by the castle. He passed Hagrid’s hut and all of the memories he had made there threatened to overwhelm him. He could smell the damp earth and death in the air and the overwhelming scent of trees as he drew nearer to the forest. Voldemort was waiting for him in that forest. His death loomed ever closer. The game was over, there were no moves left to make. The snitch had been caught.
“I’ll let Flint know.” Theo nodded curtly, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts.
“Draco?” she slammed the doors shut and pulled him into a comforting embrace. “It’s alright sweetheart, I’m here. You’re safe, I promise.”
“You’ve no idea.” He moaned.
“It’s been over an hour. There is no guarantee of how long the effects of gilly weed will last. He could have drowned and we wouldn’t even know.” Draco absolutely did not whimper.
“We can’t. Or, at least I can’t." Draco paused, uncomfortably aware that everyone was looking at him. "I only helped you because I wanted to try and balance the scales, make up for all the bad I had done. No amount of good deeds will ever counterbalance my part in the war. Or taking the dark mark. When you killed him you freed me from a life of pain and servitude. Then you go and revoke what I felt was deserved penance. I am eternally indebted to you and there is nothing I can do to ever even the score.” Draco played with his straw as an excuse to avoid eye contact.
“I was particularly interested to see your new Patronus. I think you were better off with the old one,” Snape smirked vindictively, the malice in his voice unmistakable. “The new one looks weak.”
“I’m not finished,” Harry said testily. When the wizard who had interrupted him motioned for him to proceed he instantly picked back up where he had left off. “During the war, my friends and I got captured by snatchers and were brought to Malfoy Manor. Draco refused to identify us. When faced with the threat of physical harm he knowingly lied and told Bellatrix Lestrange that it was not us. When ordered to lock us up in their cellar he cut our bindings and told us he would try to help. I confirmed with the prisoners we rescued from that cellar that he consistently snuck food and water down to them and did his best to keep them alive and healthy.”
For almost two months straight the residents of Malfoy Manor were tortured on a daily basis. After the break-in at Gringotts, even his aunt was subject to the Dark Lord’s displeasure. The worst was when he forced them to torture each other; through the imperius curse or through coercion via death threats. Of course Aunt Bella was always more than happy to dole out punishment, no coercion needed for her.
“I tried to stun my Aunt, but I was too late. She had a dagger pressed to Granger’s throat and told them to drop their wands. When they complied she told me to pick them up, so I did. Then our old house elf returned and started unscrewing the chandelier. I took advantage of my Aunt’s distraction and threw Harry the wands. There were three of them and only two wands, so I gave Harry my own so they could escape. My Aunt had summoned the Dark Lord and if they stayed it would have been their death. I couldn’t let that happen.”
“You mean you didn’t know? And you just decided I was your boyfriend anyway?” Harry was incredulous.
One of the drawings caught his attention. It was blackened around the edges and somewhat smaller than all the others, suggesting fire damage. When he flipped it over his heart stuttered in his chest.
Standing above him was a familiar pink haired witch and Harry exhaled his relief as she cast the counter jinx and he could finally move again.
“I will be. I’m fine, I promise. Nothing to worry about.” Harry wondered vaguely if his voice sounded as flat to her as it did to his own ears.
“What does one do on a double date?” Draco looked bemused.
“Draco, please-” he reached out and touched him on the arm.
“You don’t have to thank me.” She smirked, finishing her coffee and standing up. “I’m sorry, but I really must dash. Places to go, people to see...parties to plan. Come over for dinner later?”
“You, of course.” Draco snorted. “Who else?”
“Why?”
“Don't kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!!” He roared.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, d-” he started to say Death Eater but the words were stuck in his throat. His mouth wouldn’t form them. “Unemployed.” He said instead.
Pansy and Ron hatch a plan, Draco explores a new medium and Harry gets drunk.
Talking to Malfoy became surprisingly easy after that. It was both shocking and oddly nice. Harry found that when they weren’t hexing or insulting each other they actually got on rather well.  By the time the session was over, there was no hesitation in scheduling their next appointment for the following week. He couldn't be sure if this newfound camaraderie was genuine or strickly professional, but Harry still left feeling rather accomplished.
At long last, the blast of the gun sounded and all of the champions moved forward, leaving Harry standing alone on the beach still trying to chew the gilly weed. There was nothing for it. He would have to swallow it whole. He gulped the plant down and then gasped as pain seared in his neck. He gingerly felt behind his ears and was pleasantly surprised to find he had grown gills. He sent Dobby a quick prayer of thanks before diving into the icy water, confident and enlivened.
“Wodin?” He called uncertainly.
At least the outside was beginning to match the inside.
A single tear escaped as Remus fought for control, staring up at the gossamer black veil. He looked like he could not quite believe what he was seeing. Or he didn’t want to.
"Harry,"
“Who else is up here? I heard voices.” He demanded after disarming him.
“I don’t know, you have a bit of your old spark back.” George frowned thoughtfully. “You almost look happy”
“You’re early for once.” Draco hoped Harry couldn’t hear just how pleased he was by this.
“You’re so bossy.” He made a face at her.
Harry bloody Potter was cowering behind the bathroom door, spying on his mental breakdown. The second to last person he ever wanted to see him wallowing in weakness.
“We collected enough evidence from your underground lab to earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban.” Harry almost laughed when the perp backed himself against the far wall, stuttering out indignant protests as Zach and Harry moved in. “It’s over. You’re finished.”
“Get over here and look properly!” Aunt Bella barked and he immediately obeyed. She was just as sadistic and twisted as the Dark Lord. Draco was terrified of being on the receiving end of one of her unforgivable curses again. “Is it him?”
Draco had to physically restrain himself from staring open-mouthed at his father. He had never defended him before. In fact, he was usually the one doling out the blows. Aunt Bella looked like she was about to murder them both when something one of the snatchers was carrying caught her eye.
There was no reason to freak out. So why did it feel like he had spasmodic butterflies in his stomach that were trying to break free?
“These are just the previews, little clips of movies that are coming out soon. Our movie will start after.” Harry whispered.
“Welcome to the cinema.” Harry grinned. “We have some time to kill before our movie starts, do you want to check out the arcade or the bar first?”
“No no, this is perfect. Now you can color coordinate with your outfits.” George laughed, grabbing the green stick to examine it. “You’re wearing green today, so I say we start with this one.”
No one had given them so much as a second glance with their New You amulets and Harry decided he owed George a huge thank you.
“Not to worry, Miss Granger. We didn’t expect to be honored with his presence today. We are gratified enough to be in yours.” his father said charmingly, wrapping his arm around his mother’s waist.
“You have a date with Potter?” He was trembling with barely controlled laughter.
“Yes, Weasley. I even made those little miniature sausages you loved so much at the last party. Help yourself.” The witch chuckled.
“Well, now you have two.” Granger said matter of factly. “I mean, I basically picked you up from prison. That definitely falls under the best friend category.”
“You wish!” Dean laughed.
“Will that be for here or to go?” She asked blandly as if she really didn’t care about the answer.
“Of course you can, darling. Come here,” Draco reached out and pulled Harry practically into his lap. “I’m going to murder the Dursleys. Harry, you aren’t a burden, and you deserve to be hugged and loved, and looked after. Alright?”
“Come on, you can do better than that!” Sirius laughed, dodging a jet of red light.
There were multiple voices shouting and screaming, there was a loud roar coming from outside and the castle shook violently. Draco peaked out from behind the tapestry and spied a giant passing by the window. Three Order members ran off, leaving Harry and his friends alone. Harry started pacing and Draco held his breath. This was it.
Happy reading!!!
“Spit it out Perce, you’ll give yourself an aneurysm.” George snorted.
Harry’s pulse quickened, the realization that he had feelings for the pretentious prick causing blood to redden his cheeks.
“We missed you too.” George winked.
Harry took it with an impish grin and Draco apparated them about a mile down the beach. They could still see the bonfire in the distance and hear shouts of laughter and the occasional strain of music.
“Oi, I- that’s not- sod off.” He stammered, tossing the used napkins in the conveniently placed trash bin and crossing his arms.
“Harry and Seamus are the best out of the four of us, so I figure you pair with Harry and I’ll pair with Seamus. Hopefully, together we can manage to beat him.” Ron grabbed the longest cue, testing it against his height and making sure it was relatively straight.
“Erm, actually it was to find out if….” Harry glanced over at him guiltily and grabbed the whiskey, taking a swig before putting it back in the sand.
It was raining outside. The pitter-patter of water droplets gracing the roof of their tent served as white noise in the background. The atmosphere in the tent was at a boiling point.
Draco was cunning and witty, and he appeared to genuinely care about what Harry had to say. He had a wicked sense of humor and a unique way of thinking about things. It made for riveting conversations. He also seemed to lack normal social filters once his outer armor was discarded. The more comfortable Harry became, the more open and less hostile Draco became.
“I saw the git miming something to do with a nose earlier.” Ron hissed, shooting a glare across the hall to the Slytherin table. Malfoy was surrounded by his friends who were all laughing as he talked animatedly.
“It’s a beach party, why do I have to wear a collared shirt?” He asked as she forced them into his hands and pushed him towards the changing rooms.
He turned the full force of his eyes on him and Draco heaved a dramatic sigh of defeat. He couldn’t say no to that pleading, innocent look.
Damn.
“I couldn’t decide.” He shrugged.
How was he supposed to survive a whole evening with the entire Weasley clan?
“Don’t let me keep you.” His mother reached out to give his arm an affectionate squeeze before standing up. “Go spend time with your boyfriend, I have errands to run.”
He cast a neat bombarda curse, blasting the entire door out of the way before disappearing through it.
He swore softly when he noticed he was crying. Then he laughed at himself for being embarrassed. He was only about to die. Crying wasn’t an overreaction. He took several deep breaths, then pulled out his invisibility cloak. He draped it around his shoulders quickly, pulling the hood snugly over his head.
“It’s not your job to protect me! I never asked you to!” Harry snarled.
"I don't know..." Draco felt his shoulders sag at that confession.
"He won't find me." Harry promised, reaching out to gently brush the tears from his cheek.
Harry’s voice was all wrong and it threw Draco off for a moment. His normally velvet-like bass had become an irritating baritone when he drank the Polyjuice potion to turn into ‘Cousin Barny’ and Draco didn’t like it.
“Alright, enough affection.” Pansy groused. “You. Bathroom. Now.”
"Everything. This has been such a perfect day." Draco didn't want to shatter the innocence of Harry calling him 'love' by drawing attention to it and making him self-conscious.
“Will do. Have fun reigning Ron in.” He touched her elbow in farewell before retreating in the direction of the back of the house as swiftly as possible.
Draco wasn’t sure what time they fell asleep. Once the box was completely unpacked and everything put in its proper place they had turned out all the lights and watched the stars. The last thing he was aware of was Harry curling into his side and resting his head on his chest, mumbling something about eternal beauty.
Draco turned around and his face was crumpled in pain. Harry recoiled, snatching his hand back in surprise.
Draco stared after him in shock. When he looked back at Harry he flashed Draco a small smile before wrapping himself in a silvery fabric and disappearing from view. Draco let out a crazed laugh, hardly daring to believe his eyes.
He finished his tea with a heavy feeling in his heart. Draco’s crumpled face haunted him. Harry would give just about anything to erase the pain from his eyes.
“Ah, I see.” Draco smiled, then gave his mother an accusatory glower. “Wait, are you telling me you and father knew Harry liked me too?”
"So, the leaves are starting to turn brown and fall off. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression they should be green and attached to the plant," Blaise said, putting his hand on hips and tilting them to the side, all the while glowering down at the plant. Neville had to tear his eyes away.
Draco held his breath as he reached for Harry's hand, waiting for his reaction. Harry simply smiled at him though, grabbing Draco's hand back and not letting go until they got back to the castle and Harry let go to open the door for Draco.
Draco looked skeptically at Ginny.
This chapter has smut, but it's clearly marked where it begins, so you can skip it if you wish.
Moving over to the end of his bed he reached under and pulled out the Marauder's map. It had been a while since he'd really looked at it.
"Yeah, I- I want to try, but in secret. I don't want my dad to find out."
Panting, he came down from his high, opening his eyes to see Draco smirking down at him. "I didn't even touch you."
"Nah, not many people know this passageway anyway," Draco replied, kissing him again.
"Alright, well we better get going for class," Dean said, standing up and helping Seamus up as well.
"Make it messy."
Some Interesting things about this story:
Draco had a feeling it was much worse than he was letting on, and he suddenly felt very angry, "Not that bad? That's child abuse!" Draco suddenly shouted and then caught himself when Harry seemed to startle at his sudden outburst. He knew Harry didn't need his rage right now, it wouldn't help him, so instead he took a breath and scooted a bit closer. "Sorry, but I mean, you shouldn't need to compare what your childhood was like to others'. Just because some people have gone through worse, doesn't make your pain any less valid."
Pansy leaned in almost immediately and Hermione met her halfway, their lips meeting as Seamus let out a "whoop!"
The utter absurdity of Ron being the one to say it broke the tension and both Harry and Hermione doubled over laughing.
Pansy Parkinson — beater, Keeper
"But only when it'd help others."
Draco turned the parchment over and opened it with a curious look, "A blank piece of parchment? I hate to tell you this, but I have seen a lot of parchment before," he said jokingly.
"Harry?" Hermione asked from behind him.
"Yeah, you both kinda have a haze around you. You're light blue and Draco's red."
"Turn around," Draco directed him to lean against the wall and he obliged without a word.
"What are you getting at Pansy?" Draco said, shooting her a warning look. He really hoped she wouldn't start talking about her weird proclamation of him liking Harry in front of him.
"Okay," Draco mumbled, his attention on how they were positioned now.
"How Draco is a git."
Draco sat next to him for the match but not as close as he normally did, a foot of space between them, and when the match ended he quickly left muttering excuses. Harry supposed he deserved that.
"I noticed," Draco said, walking over to Harry's bed and sitting down next to him. Draco leaned his head against Harry's shoulder, "So what are we doing tonight? You promised a date."
“Don’t fall back asleep, you have lunch plans with Pansy remember?”
Harry didn't know what to say so Draco plowed on.
"The potions essay, for Slughorn. I'm completely lost and it doesn't make any sense," Harry groaned, throwing his head back and tossing his arm over his face.
"You're kidding."
“No, you seem incapable of it.”
His long legs make his strides towards the table quick, and he makes it there quicker than he thought he would, but he doesn't stop there. Taking the front of Harry's robes into his fists, he pulls him forward into what can only be described as the best kiss in his entire life.
Harry woke up to Ron hovering over him.
"I thought the day would never come," Pansy said, sitting down next to Draco on the bed. He looked at her, completely confused now. "Oh come on, you can't possibly believe that I would willingly follow that mad man?"
"The food can wait," Draco said, fingers undoing the buttons of Harry's pants and hands making their way past his waistband. Harry was immediately grateful Draco was the one he'd fallen in love with.
"You don't really care right?"
"It was painfully obvious how much you liked him, Draco," Narcissa said and Draco blushed, "All you did was talk about him non stop."
Harry was not stalking Draco. He wasn't.
Pansy had never let him live it down, and they stopped kissing in halls after that.
"I wanted to say sorry," Harry said as he finally found the words, "I wanted to apologize for how I acted towards you, I ignored you after the war, and I'm sorry about that. It was selfish."
"Mmhm," Harry said, opening his eyes and giving a nod.
4. I started this story while I was living in Ecuador. I went on a volunteer trip there for 6 weeks last summer and lived with a host family and my partner in country. It was a lot of fun, but I also had a ton of down time so one day I decided to start writing. Since then I’ve gone back and edited it, so it’s not at all like it originally was. If you want to check it out, it's on the last chapter of "Draw The Line" on Wattpad. My username is katt_alexx on there. If enough people ask for it, I'll post it here too.
"That's the glory of masks though, isn't it? No one can tell it's us, we could be anyone right now,"
"Alright, I'll be down for lunch as soon as I get dressed," Harry said, quickly recovering himself, "Thanks for reminding me."
"Well it really isn't exclusive to muggles. It could be played by anyone really, you don't really even need to call is 20 questions if you didn't want to," Harry stopped when he saw Draco's unamused look and realized he was rambling. He sighed before continuing, "It's just a game where you get to ask each other 20 questions."
"Ha. ha," Harry said, "place your wand tip on the paper and say 'I solemnly swear I'm up to no good'."
"Andddd Gryffindor wins again," Harry laughed. "You really need to get better at picking who will win, Draco."
Draco,
"Well, I gotta say: I'm jealous, Weasley," Pansy said, shooting Ron a smirk as she went back to her seat. Ron was sputtering beside Hermione and was trying to wrap his head around the whole thing.
"I could, you don't know."
"Alright," Blaise responded and they got to work in mostly silence.
"Alright, mate! See you later then!" Ron said as he pulled Hermione out the door.
Just then, the door opened and Draco walked in, looking around them awkwardly. Then he looked at Harry and his eyes dropped to where Harry's hand had fallen away slightly from where he was prodding the bruise on his neck. He knew what it was immediately and flushed redder than he ever had before, all the way down to his neck. Coughing, he quickly turned from them and hurried off to the bathrooms.
"No way. Just use a cleaning charm; I'm starving and want to finish setting this up," Draco said, suddenly sitting up to get back to the fort, "we can shower later."
“You were going to ask him to the Yule Ball?!” Ron burst in, earning exasperated looks from both Harry and Hermione. “What? Don’t look at me like that! You like him back then?”
"Don't ask me, how would I know?" Harry tried to cast the same charm and one of the vines grabbed a hold of Harry's wrist, "Ah! Get it off!"
It was finally Friday and it didn't seem like there was any new news until he got called out of his last class: Divination.
"What's the dumbest thing you've ever done to get attention from someone?"
"I think that Draco is trying to be a better person," Hermione said, "He can't help how he was brought up and I think that if he learns from the mistakes he made and apologizes, I can forgive him. I don't think Harry is being too forgiving; we were all just kids."
"I'm going to get McGonagall," Hermione said to Ron as she rushed out of the common room.
"Who knows, I was reading on room expansion spells over the summer though and to expand all the house's dormitories like that would be pretty difficult," Hermione said.
Neville looked between Harry and Draco as Blaise and Draco talked.
When Draco didn't respond to him though the kid seemed to get angrier, "Did you hear me? Why would they let a Death Eater like you in the school," the kid spat out at Draco. Draco tried not to respond and simply gripped the book tighter. "Knew it was only a matter of time until you decided to attack someone. Stay away from us." By the way he said 'us' Draco knew he meant the Gryffindor house, specifically Harry.
"Potter," Draco ground out and then prayed that the coin would land on tails. He let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding when the coin did land on tails. He'd never been so thankful of something in his whole life.
"Then who do you think? It's either Malfoy or Lavender mate, and Lavender couldn't focus long enough to actually play."
Harry almost immediately noticed how Malfoy's hair was swept off to the side messily instead of slicked back as it usually was and he couldn't help immediately thinking that it definitely looked much better.
"Five," They both said in unison and Ron let out a groan as he realized what would be happening next.
Harry took in Draco's thin frame, shivering slightly from the cold, nose red. He jammed his bag of candy into his coat pocket, stopping Draco in his tracks to pull off his scarf and wrap it snugly around Draco's neck. Harry decided he looked kind of cute all wrapped up in both scarfs.
It had been four days since the kiss and things were still awkward between Harry and Draco. Harry hates how Draco ignored him constantly, and how awkward each one of their punishments were. Every time he thought about how far he'd gotten in terms of becoming friends with Draco and compared it to how messed up it all was now, he felt a sinking feeling in his stomach.
Harry simply shrugged and Draco ran the towel over his forehead. Harry let out a breath of relief and closed his eyes at the feeling of the cool towel on his head. Draco moved the towel to Harry's neck where he let it stay to cool him off. Harry opened his eyes again and looked up at Draco. Their eyes met and Harry felt a spark pass between them, but Draco quickly looked away.
I love you always,
"What are your three most favorite things to do?" Harry was sort of shocked at the simple question, half expecting him to ask him something that would in some way embarrass him.
"Well then don't do things that prompt me to worry!"
"I meant to apologize for how I acted in the Great Hall, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. I was just surprised."
"There is no such thing as privacy between us," Blaise laughed and leaned back, "Anyway, about this plan."
Draco looked at him skeptically, "It's freezing out there, it's October."
"Hermione!" Mrs. Weasley said, coming around the hall to greet her in a hug.
The party was loud loud, and Harry's eyes were hurting from all the lights quicker than he'd like to admit.
"You will when your father catches wind of this."
"I love you too."
"Hey Winky."
When the bottle was finally handed back to Pansy from Blaise it was placed in the centre and Pansy volunteered to spin first. The bottle spun around a few times before slowing to a stop before Neville and Neville audibly gulped when he saw the look she was giving him.
"I've been meaning to talk to you about-" Harry stopped as he mulled over what he was about to say next in his head, he wasn't exactly sure where to begin. Ginny seemed to get it though, thank god, Harry thought.
Harry, meanwhile, was trying to find a way to hide his embarrassment as he was called out.
"Are you okay Harry?"
"Here," Draco said, offering his scarf to Harry with a light blush. "I'm not very cold. Use a heating charm too, it'll help."
Draco had gone over to his bed with a wide yawn and was fussing with his dresser. Harry watched him a moment before crossing over and sitting down on Draco's bed.
When they arrived back at Hogwarts it was almost sunset and the ground was covered in a light layer of snow, just as Harry had predicted.
Harry was staring at the board intently and Ron studied him. If Hermione was right, and Harry did like Draco, what would that mean? Ron thought. He figured it wouldn't change much between Harry and himself, but would it mean he'd have to hang out with Draco more? He figured he would. He didn't want to hang out with Draco, but he supposed he would, if only for Harry.
The Three Broomsticks was warm and crowded with Hogwarts students when they arrived and they barely managed to snag a small table tucked into a corner.
Draco sat at a table in the corner of the common room on a Saturday, watching as people left to go to Hogsmeade. Almost two weeks had passed and Harry still hadn't talked to him. I really fucked up, Draco thought to himself as he slumped down on his textbook.
"What about our food?" Harry managed, voice rough and breathless. Draco was slowly driving him crazy with his mouth and fingers and he'd honestly sooner starve than stop to eat now, but he felt he should probably mention it. He knew Draco was still slightly nervous about getting intimate and hoped that mentioning the food would let him have an out if he wanted it.
"Malfoy!" Harry shouted as he stormed after him up the stairs, barely pausing to round up his things on the table. Everyone in the common room shared a look and watched as Harry's back disappeared around the corner. Hermione felt a little worried.
“They’re quite cute and I get a bit bored here alone all the time. Odette has to leave so often, it leaves me little company,” Pansy said, filling up two cups of water for them. Odette was Pansy’s girlfriend of three years. She was a year older than Pansy and was currently interning under Ron’s brother, Charlie, and often has to leave for a few weeks at a time. Pansy was hoping to possibly move with her to Romania when school starts up for the year and Draco and Harry head off to Hogwarts to teach.
He definitely didn't mind. Divination was the worst class in his opinion, but he did feel slightly bad as he left Draco sitting at their shared table.
"My parents have been oddly more attentive too," Draco said, looking down at his food as he pushed it around. It was odd now that he was thinking about it. They'd written him more this year than they had all the others combined. It was nice, but it was still a bit odd.
Ron grabbed it off his head and shook himself out of his stupor, "Yeah, I know... I just - you're really pretty."
"Harry! Where have you been?"
For some reason Harry felt suddenly very defensive and angry, he hated the way Draco could always get a rise out of him. "I have not been stalking you! I was only trying to make sure that you and your band of Death Eaters didn't burn the whole school down!" Harry knew he went too far as Draco recoiled.
"So what is it?" Draco's eyes roamed over the paper, but as far as he could see it was just blank. He supposed there might be something on the inside, but when Harry opened it he was met with more blank paper.
"So, still want to say the room didn't smell like me, Harry?" Draco said, smirking at him. Harry laughed, turning around to wrap his arms around Draco.
"Yeah, of course. It's no problem," Draco said.
They walked in a comfortable silence for a bit before Draco decided to risk grabbing Harry's hand. They'd held hands, sure, but usually only when comforting one another.
"Hey," Harry said awkwardly, avoiding Draco's eyes.
"I thought you said being gay was pretty accepted."
Harry decided to break up the small argument, “Yeah, he um… well he kissed me, like a month ago.”
Harry absentmindedly kept his fingers threading through Draco's hair as he looked out over the grounds. Draco was glowing brightly beside him and it was kind of beautiful. Harry could see the red out of the corner of his eye and he closed his eyes letting himself savor the moment.
"You still have some work for the break," Hermione reminded him and Harry groaned.
"Well the muggle world is pretty different Hermione, I mean, you know that of course. You're family is really open minded," Ron said, then turned to look at Harry, "the only people who care about that stuff here are the crazy purebloods trying to carry on their bloodline."
"Truth or dare, Malfoy?"
The gargoyle moved to give room for them to pass onto the stairs and head up to the headmaster's office.
Draco shut his book with a thud and glared at Pansy who smirked when she noticed the growing redness of his cheeks.
That's when he realized just how bad he messed up and his eyes prickled. He tried to hold it back, it's my own fault, he told himself.
"First it's a truce, now it's friends, what's next?" Draco said and Harry turned suddenly very red. They stared at each other for a moment too long and Draco quickly let go of Harry's hand. "I'm - I'm going to shower," Draco stuttered a bit, hurring over to his trunk to get his nightclothes out and rush to the bathroom. Harry watched him rush about with a small smile on his face.
Draco turned pink then as he realized Harry meant he wanted to take a bath together. "You're sure that's a good idea?"
"Probably if Draco comes," Harry said.
Harry watched the way Draco's eyes lit up as he talked about it, the corner of Draco's mouth twitching up into a small smile as he laughed. Harry really liked his smile and wished he would do it more often.
Dinner time came too soon and Harry realized he had spent more time staring at Draco than working and he still hadn't done much. Well, he could always work later he supposed.
"No, not yet. They came in before I could really start," Draco said, motioning to Dean and Seamus.
"Well," Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck, "it'd be a good way to complete our punishment?"
"Oh come on Draco," Pansy said.
"You do though," Dean said as the door opened, admitting Harry.
--------------------------------------
"I will, just take a moment to relax before we go down there okay?"
The kiss finally ended when Hermione pulled back slightly with a small smile, the kiss had been nice, but she still very much liked Ron.
Pansy plucked up the bottle next, "Alright, my turn! Let's see some real action!" With a flourish she spun the bottle until it landed on Hermione.
"Yeah, it's Luna," she said with a bit of a laugh, "I suppose I should at least finish my announcement though, and say I'm bi."
He didn't have anything to argue back but he still felt stupid. What if Draco had just gotten caught up in the moment like they usually did during dares. The fact that Draco kissed him back made Harry think Draco liked him, but why would he run away if he did. Harry was silently freaking out as he rounded the corner. He hoped he wouldn't run into anyone as it was late and he'd forgotten his invisibility cloak in the dorm and the Marauders Map.
"Uh, hey 'Mione," Harry said awkwardly, "were we being too loud? Sorry about that."
"Is that so?" Draco and Harry had gotten in line to pay for the candies and people were starting to take notice of them together. Draco tried to ignore the stares and whispers.
"We're done?" Harry asked, looking mildly put out.
"That's easy stuff Draco," Pansy smirked as she reached to lift her shirt off, "Or did you want to help."
Draco slowly pulled away after a moment, “As much as I’d love to just sit out here and make out with you, we’re both going to catch a cold and I’d really like to eat lunch.”
Harry went completely red, “Well, uh- no - I, um, pushed him away actually.”
"You should really listen to Granger, you know, chew your food before you talk," Blaise said, and Ron sent him a scowl.
"You don't like him do you?" Ron asked, a look of concern flashing over his face.
"Here, stay here, I'll be right back," Draco said with a tone that was surprisingly gentle. Harry watched as Draco went to the bathroom and he heard the faucet turn on. Draco came back a moment with a damp towel. "May I?" Draco held the towel out towards him.
"Yeah," Draco said quietly, looking down again.
"Well we had to know if you were the heir!" Harry said scooting down a bit so Draco could get more comfortable on his shoulder. Draco scooted over a bit more and relaxed.
Harry turned red realizing he had been so obvious about it, "It's just- You're really good looking," Harry said, turning his head from Draco.
"About 45 more minutes," Harry replied, picking up his sheets from the floor and putting them on his bed.
"Did something happen with the colors?" she quickly asked, sweeping over to him.
Draco looked up when he heard the creak of his bed.
"It doesn't need to be some grand thing and we don't have to tell anyone, but I'd like to go on an actual date with you."
"Either. Does it matter? Both are crazy."
Groaning, Draco curled into Harry's chest, "Don't wanna, it's too early."
"Hey guys, fancy seeing you here," Draco said, when Neville and Blaise arrived at their table.
"It's alright, we figured you'd want to sleep with all the alcohol. We figured you'd be hungover though..." Hermione took him in.
"Yeah, sure. Long as you give it back," she joked.
"Slept with me?" Harry laughed and Draco got redder if at all possible. "Relax, I'm not angry." Harry rolled out of bed to get his clothes and head to the bathroom, "that was probably the best I've slept in a while."
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's abdomen and curled up into him. Just for tonight, he told himself, it means nothing, I'm just comforting him. Draco felt Harry's light breaths ghosting over his hair and watched the rise and fall of Harry's chest as he breathed. Draco wondered what his father would think if he could see him now and let out a long sigh as he fell asleep.
"Not too many people out of bed after curfew, huh?"
Draco stood there a moment after the door closed before turning to the steaming bath. It was the perfect temperature.
"Your hair really can get worse, it's a mess right now," Draco said.
"We should probably get up then, and go eat," Harry said with a light laugh.
"Come on Malfoy, let's just get the dare done with," Harry said, getting up and walking over to Draco who started to back up. Part of Harry's brain was telling him that he should be reacting like Ron was to the dare and be refusing to do it as Draco was, but a much larger part of his brain wanted to do it so so bad. He was dying to know what it felt like to kiss Draco and he had no idea when he was going to get another chance like this; he felt a bit embarrassed over how bad he suddenly wanted to kiss him but told himself that he could always blame it on alcohol the next morning.
"Yeah, I'd like that," Harry said, watching as Draco's head flew up to meet his eyes.
"No, of course not," Pomfrey said and Harry felt better. He hated the hospital wing, he's stayed more than his fair share of time in the hospital wing, and didn't plan to spend more this year too. "I just mean that I want you to let me know if you notice any changes and Snape and I will look into the effects of the potion combination in the meantime."
Pansy was smirking at him though, even after he finished his next turn, and he knew there was no way she'd let this go for a long while. As the game dragged on though, and Draco let himself relax a bit he couldn't help but feel a little disappointed that they weren't playing truth or dare this Friday. Though, he knew that if they played truth or dare that he'd most likely have to kiss Harry again, he still wanted to play. He hated to admit to himself though that the reason may be that he did want to kiss Harry again.
Seamus eagerly accepted and gave the bottle a hard spin, watching as it circled the group multiple times.
Harry followed Draco as he made his way out of the common room and to the astronomy tower. Draco thought it was a bit of a miracle Filch didn't run into them, but they made it to the top of the tower safely.
"Well that changes things a bit I guess," Hermione said, running her hand over her face, "though, maybe we can talk to them and see if they did anything new in the past few days, if so we could try to look for a pattern between people of the same color."
"We won of course, so we have to throw a party," Ron said, handing Harry a piece of red cake. Harry figured he'd gotten before they even played the match, assuming they were going to win. Typical Ron, Harry thought, laughing a bit. Ron seemed to notice the green jumper around Harry's shoulders then and the two bags hanging off Draco's shoulders, and his eyebrow drew together in confusion, "Why are you wearing a Slytherin jumper?"
"What's that?" Draco said, pointing to the blank paper when Hermione had left and Harry had closed the door. "It sounded dangerous."
1. The whole reason I wrote this entire thing was because I wanted to write a story in which Lucius already knows about Draco liking Harry and when Draco finally tells him his father is all like “Yeah no duh, you’ve been talking about him non-stop since first year.”
"I do not fancy Potter!" Draco shouted at her. Pansy stopped and stared at him for a second as several people turned to look at them as well. Draco immediately colored.
"Mmhm," Harry responded, putting his books away.
“I know that, I’m worried about my feet. At this rate I’m going to need shoes with steel at the toes.”
"Pretty much," Harry rounded his stuff up on the bench and then turned to the rest of the team, "Great job today, guys. We won't have practice next Tuesday as we normally would as a bit of a break, but I expect to see you all on Thursday. Have fun with the rest of your day and make sure to get sleep."
"Well I doubt anyone would actually turn you down," Ron laughed. "I've heard a lot of girls whispering about you recently," he continued before Hermione smacked him in the head.
"Oh don't worry about it, I understand that you'd want to get out of there.
"Looks like we got an audience. Come on, let's go say hi." They both left the money for their drinks on the table and headed across the room to where Draco and Harry were sitting, looking guilty.
The End
"Ah!"  Harry groaned when Draco nipped at it. Draco leaned up to look at his face which was contorted in pleasure. Draco smiled as he leaned back to his stomach, kissing his way down Harry's abdomen until he reached his waistband.
"Hmm," Harry said, looking around the room till he saw a bit of red hair peeking out from under a hood of a cloak, picking up a glass of fire whiskey. That was either Ron or his brothers came to Hogwarts for the party, while he didn't doubt the latter, the former is more likely, "Over there."
"Not very long," Harry said looking back across the room to where Pansy was gulping down some sort of clear liquid, "I've been entertained by that anyway."
"I'm going to take this to Professor Snape and see what he has to say. I believe that you are right though, thank you for bringing this to me," she said with a small smile, "I'll let you know what he says."
Draco felt himself start to crumble as he saw the look on Harry's face. He really loved him and that look was beyond cute. If his father didn't know, why shouldn't he enjoy himself a little bit...
"I'm just hoping we can beat Hufflepuff next Saturday. Most of our team is pretty young."
"Fine, then what are you planning to do for your date, Blaise?" Pansy asked, turning to Blaise.
Draco helplessly watched as the door opened to his bedroom, revealing his mother.
"It's Draco's turn now," Blaise turned and evil smirk to Draco.
As soon as Draco was settled back on the bed, Harry was in his lap, grinding his hips down as Draco breathed shakily out his nose. Draco's hands rose up to grip onto Harry's hips as he ground down on him, their clothes the only thing between them.
"It's okay to not be," Harry mumbled, wrapping his arms around him. "What do you want to do? I can leave or stay, it's completely up to you okay?"
It was Draco's turn to blush and turn away, "I'm not-"
On Wednesday Harry came rushing through the doors of Draco and his shared dorm. Draco watched in mild amusement as he took in Harry's slightly disheveled form. Before Draco could even get a word out though, Harry said, "Okay, I've got the plan."
"Relax Ron, you're not the one dating Draco," Hermione replied, cutting him off.
"You two are unbelievable," Hermione sighed then turned back to the list and circled their names. "Okay, well since we have the keeper and seeker we still need the rest of the team. Pansy, Goyle, Ernie Macmillan, and Bulstrode all tried out for beater, who do you guys want?"
“Ha. Ha. Nothing’s wrong, so just enjoy the meal,” Harry laughed. Draco shot him a skeptical look but ate the food anyway.
"Ugh, they're all terrible options," Ron complained.
"Ouch, that stings. Especially as I don't like them either," Blaise grabbed at his chest and pansy whacked him in the back of the head, "Hey!"
"McGonagall. She caught Malfoy and I arguing in the hall and got angry, we have to hang out now. I'll explain more at breakfast when Hermione is there."
"Sure," Draco said, "that sounds fun."
"You two seem to be getting along quite well recently," Ron said, and Hermione sent him a look. Harry wasn't really paying attention to them though, he was busy looking at the way the light hit Draco's hair and made it almost glow.
"I'm not a git," Draco tried to defend himself.
"What on earth would you be studying? The quarter ends soon."
"New hair color. Are you blind as well as stupid now?" Draco said, setting his stuff down, "You know, you don't want to do the same thing all the time."
"Yup," Harry said, pointing to their names at the top of the tower, side by side. It made him blush a bit, seeing their names all alone together at the top of the tower. "It shows where everyone is and it moves with them."
"Be back by two," Draco said, and with that he swept out of the room carefully, avoiding Harry's eyes.
Draco panted as he slowly rolled off Harry. He felt limp as he laid next to Harry for a moment before curling up to his side and pressing light kisses to Harry's cheek.
"At six in the morning?" Blaise said.
"Alright," Draco said, using his wand to cast the spell for lube. One of the most useful spells out there, Draco mused.
“Date?” Ginny, Luna, and Neville questioned all at once, eyes wide as they turned to take in Draco and Harry.
Hermione looked at him confused, "Am I wrong? You did say they're both red now right?"
"Slytherin will win," Draco said simply.
"It was him who started it this time-!"
"You could, but you wouldn't."
"Great for you, but I am not, so figure it out while I read," Draco said back as he turned back to his book. Harry groaned, rolling over and spotting his pillow, getting an idea. Before he could second guess himself, Harry picked up the pillow launching the pillow at Draco's head.
Draco,
When the teacher finally got everyone's attention, again, with a pointed glare in their direction, Hermione leaned towards Harry and lowered her voice, "I know what the colors mean."
"This time, but you both have had countless other pointless fights that have started with you too." Harry realized arguing with Hermione was futile and decided to give up, sighing.
"Who do you think is most likely to date an ex's friend?" Harry asked Ginny.
The game lasted a little longer, but soon everyone was fighting against sleep and alcohol to fall asleep. People started gathering up the alcohol and heading to bed, Ginny and Luna heading out as well.
He usually sat with Draco for this class - ancient runes - but they were supposed to be working in groups of three today so they'd separated to work with their own friend groups. Harry wasn't really working today though, but Hermione didn't seem to mind. She probably thought he had a headache again, Harry figured. She wouldn't be far off, though, his head was starting to ache again. He figured it was because he wasn't used to seeing so many colors.
Harry couldn't help but agree, but before he could say so, he caught sight of Draco coming down the stairs. He was dressed in dark clothes that hugged his figure and Harry willed his heart rate to calm down.
"You are!" Harry said, suddenly seeming to get defensive and made Draco jump. "You are, you really are, don't tell yourself otherwise."
"I haven't really seen any different shades, it's mostly just the brightness of the color that changes, like someone dimming or brightening a light. And even then, pink and red are the only colors that ever glow brighter."
He really missed their hang-outs and their study sessions (which usually ended up being them sitting talking to each other with their homework out). Draco was lonely if he was being honest. He had made up with Pansy and decided to not rat her out, even if she totally deserved it. Even though he had Blaise and Pansy, he still felt unbelievably lonely and wondered how he ever dealt with not being Harry's friend before.
Ron's head hurt. Was everyone here gay? Ron thought wildly.
Blaise felt giddy and nervous as he stood up to walk over to Neville. Neville looked up at Blaise as he sat down on his knees in front of him.
Draco sighed, and looked down at his hands, "I don't think we should..."
"Well of course more help would be great, but it's a lot to ask people, and not many are very dedicated to herbology."
Harry woke to sunlight streaming in through the windows. He slowly opened his eyes to find blond hair and a warm body wrapped around him. Draco suddenly shifted closer to him and tightened his grasp around Harry's waist and he couldn't help the smile that crossed over his face. Harry shifted down a bit, as he was still slightly leaning on the headboard, to wrap his arms around Draco. Who cares if I'm not supposed to like him, Harry thought as Draco let out a contented sigh in his sleep, I can continue to dislike him in the morning.
"You do too, what are you up to now?"
"Thanks."
"Of course I do, I think it's a quite wonderful idea don't you think?"
"Yeah, of course, what's the problem?"

"Well, aren't you going to open it?" Hermione prompted.

Harry had been aware of how close they pressed into each other as they talked about the match, of how close their faces got when it got particularly heated, of how their arms had practically been glued to each other since the moment they woke up.
"So what are we going to do today for our punishment?" Harry asked.
"Thanks," Neville said with a smile as they left the shop and Blaise handed over his chocolate frogs.
"Relax, I've got this," Harry said, pulling out the Marauder's map he had stuffed in his pocket before he'd gone to dinner.
Draco's kissing me.
"Yeah?"
"Regular sense of style. Regular friends. Regular interests. Regular eyes. Regular face," Draco was ticking off his fingers.
"Thanks for waiting for me," Draco grumbled as he entered their dorm room.
"You have too and it's starting to grate on my nerves! Just ask him out already and get it over with, I can't take this anymore!" Pansy said, dramatically flopping forward onto the table to prove her point. "You're whipped and I'm sick of it!"
"Nope, I care about myself. I don't want to hear you complaining about your shoulder later and I don't want to catch a cold from you either," Draco replied, heading out the door.
"Not really," Harry said evasively, avoiding Ron's eyes and moving his chess piece. It was a bad move and Ron won.
When they were all seated around the table eating Harry finally wondered if he should tell them where he had been and why. Draco's parents had reacted well, so their reaction couldn't be too bad right?
Love,
"You're the one who wanted me to go faster," Draco sniggered, watching Harry try and walk, but when he tried to get up himself he couldn't help but notice just how sore he felt all over. "Oh no, this isn't gonna be very good for the quidditch match."
"Hey," someone said behind Harry and he was surprised when he turned around to see Draco.
When they reached the kitchen Harry had to take a second to take in the sheer amount of food. Molly was really out-doing herself this year, he thought as he took a seat between Ron and George.
Okay, he didn’t like him just a little. He liked him a whole lot.
They both found themselves five hours later leaning against the headboard and each other laughing about something and sleepy.
Harry's first class was History of Magic with Ron and Hermione and the latter seemed to be the only person taking it seriously. It was an eighth year class which meant that they had it with every eighth year who took the class, which also meant that Draco was seated one row up and to the left of Harry. This also meant that he was having a hard time focusing even though Draco seemed to be pointedly ignoring him. Draco had been pretending he didn't exist for the last couple days except for when they had their punishments, which were always in complete silence.
“Do you think he was about to ask you though?” Pansy said, gaining a contemplative look.
"I agree with Dean and Smith, but I'm pretty sure Seamus just came to have something to do. I mean, pretty much every eighth year was out there," Harry said, leaning forward to circle Dean and Zacharias' names.
Seeing as Pansy was too drunk and currently complaining on the floor, Dean took up the bottle and gave it a spin. The bottle rolled to a stop in front of Harry and Dean walked over to Harry.
Harry reached up a hand to run his fingers through Draco's hair, he let out a contented sigh, leaning into the touch. It was nice to relax like this.
"Eventually, but you have not let me sleep since you got up!" Harry groaned and pulled his covers up over his head.
“I don’t think he’ll tear it up.”
"You can't force me to too!" Draco looked over to Harry, his eyes silently pleading for him to take a drink instead, but Harry didn't seem to be about to give a complaint. Harry hadn't drunk anything to skip out a dare or truth the whole game and instead had just started drinking anyway. Draco cursed his gryffindorness.
When the dormitory door closed, Harry took no time in pulling Draco into a kiss. They both stumbled their way to the bed as the back of Draco's knees hit Harry's mattress they both tumbled onto the bed, never breaking their kiss.
"Thanks," Draco murmured when they got to the bathroom.
"Your head hurt?" Harry asked as he reached out a hand to feel Draco's forehead. Draco didn't open his eyes.
As the final class of the day ended though both Harry and Draco had reached peak levels of nervousness.

Hermione had always thought girls were pretty since she was young, but she'd never really had a chance to kiss one before. She knew she was bi, had known for a while, but she'd never really talked to anyone about it before. She had liked Ron too much to try to date a girl and when she by now it had just seemed pointless to tell anyone as she was planning to be with Ron for the rest of her life. She wasn't exactly sure how he'd react too and didn't really want to deal with it.
Harry loved the sight of Draco in his red jumper, but loved wearing one of Draco's even more. He pulled on his hair then, smelling it and couldn't help the wide smile that spread across his face as he realized how much he smelled like Draco.
Love,
“Hey! What’s that supposed to mean?” Ron complained as Hermione and Harry slowly calmed down.
"What's so interesting about that book? There's so many better things to do on a Saturday that reading," Pansy looked over at the book that lay in Draco's lap, Mastering Potions: Uses for Common Ingredients, "Like figuring out how you're going to get to shag Potter."
"Quite possibly," George grinned.
"My lips are sealed," Harry said, miming zipping his lips shut.
"Oh," Draco visibly deflated, but Harry had turned back to his food to take another bite and didn't seem to notice.
Harry smiled that bright smile, that made Draco's heart flutter, at him. "Alright, it's a deal! Now get your jumper!"
"Not helping."
Draco sat up quickly, and then groaned as blood rushed to his head. "What time is it?"
"Death Eater," Draco heard someone mutter as he walked past Draco's table. He didn't recognize the kid, but his tie told him that the kid was from Gryffindor. Draco guessed the kid was probably a sixth year.
"How would a stupid dare change how the punishment went?" Draco was trying to find his place in the textbook.
“Next time there’s a school snowball fight, I’m making sure you participate,” Harry said, pulling them along the path again. Draco just let out a grumble, muttering something about wet socks.
“Thanks,” Harry replied, face red from all the looks.
"One," Harry whispered.
"There you are!" Hermione said aghast when Harry plopped down across the table from Ron and Hermione. "You were gone all day!"
"Um, well we could play a game... like 20 questions."
Harry happily returned the hug, "Sorry, had to wait for everyone to go to sleep." Draco pulled back to take in Harry's clothes.
Draco smiled, shifting to turn and look at Harry. Draco met Harry's lips as he settled back into Harry, his arms snaking around Harry, pulling him closer. Harry slowly pulled away, pressing another soft kiss to Draco's forehead.
"No one cares enough to listen in," Pansy waved his retort off, "It's only awkward right now because he's realizing his feelings for you."
"You ready?" Blaise asked Neville when he arrived. They were going to go to Hogsmeade together for their first date and Blaise was drowning in nerves.
"I'll explain in the morning, alright?"
"No!" Pansy responded with a skeptical look. "Look, if you can't be quiet and let me read, I'm going to the library."
"Why not? We room together, are stuck together everyday-"

"But it's Malfoy!"
"Yeah, everything's good. Don't stop for me. I'm just heading to bed," Harry mumbled a bit too quick and Hermione raked her eyes over Harry's form.
---------------------------------------
"What do you mean?" Blaise said, finally perking up and following the other boy
"Why not?" Draco asked, trying to capture Harry's lips but he moved his head out of the way.
"I get nightmares too," Draco mumbled after a minute of silence, "Sometimes- sometimes it helps me to write them down or talk about them. I'm here if you need to talk."
