Draco huffs in mock frustration before leading Harry by the hand back through the door. The remnants of the puddle splash under their footsteps, coating the hems of their robes in gold.
“Hey, you. Are you sleeping on me?” Draco teases. He reaches for Harry’s foot, trailing his fingers up the sensitive arch.
He recalls watching with bated breath as Harry led the Hungarian Horntail on its path of destruction around the school, narrowly avoiding disaster as he snatched the golden egg from the arena. His thoughts shift quickly to Harry, face bruised and distorted, on the floor of the Manor. The words echo in his mind as Draco, sallow and waning, stutters that he can’t be sure, though there was never a doubt in his mind who sat in front of him. Harry’s figure ripples, then emerges with a new crispness. It’s late summer when Harry stands at the door of Draco’s grungy, asbestos-filled flat, returning a wand, offering a hand, paying no mind to the Mark on Draco’s arm.
“I wouldn’t bet on that just yet, Harry. Every day, I’ve brought memories with me. We’ve reviewed them in hopes that it may trigger a release of the curse that has a hold on your mind,” Draco explains.
“I know, love. I’m trying, I promise.” Draco pulls him closer, counting each of Harry’s breaths and focusing on the beat of his heart under Draco’s palm.
Healer Perkins clears her throat before continuing, words clipped and contrite. “Might I remind all present of Mr. Potter’s outbursts during his first week of treatment. Accidental magic, uncontrolled delusions. It took three Healers to subdue him on his first night with visitation. Should Mr. Potter have one of these outbursts in public, who knows what kind of harm he might cause?”
“It had to be you stranded on the side of the road, didn’t it?” he asks, though it doesn’t sound like a question.
“Draco?” He opens the shower door, eyes following the stream of water that falls from the tip of my nose. “What’s wrong?”
relegates the shadows towards the corners. The light reveals the piece of treacle tart that rests on the countertop, molding and stinking despite the stasis charm. Harry’s trainers sit in a pile by the back door, still muddy from their last seeker’s game back when autumn had taken its first breath.
“It won’t work, I’m not ready yet. You’re definitely not ready yet. We have to make our mistakes first. The people we are right now, we aren’t ready.”
and the overhead light as he pulls the car back onto the road. The yellow headlights are a hazy tunnel against the black of the bayou, highlighting swarms of mosquitoes and an occasional set of glossy eyes in the surrounding swamp.
Harry is silent for a moment and pulls his knees to his chest. His oversized pants pool around his ankles, and his cuticles are peeling from his nervous habits. He chews on a bit of dry skin on his lip until Draco sees a spot of blood. It’s fascinating, the tiniest of mannerisms that still remain, the traces of Harry that live in the liminal space where nature meets nurture.
"You really were watching me," he drawls, eyes narrowing as he keeps his gaze fixed on the road. He raises his brows, jutting out his lower lip in a gesture of mild surprise before his lips twist in a wicked grin. "Did you like what you saw?"
Pansy’s heels tap on the tile as she strides towards Draco, leaning down to drop a kiss on his cheek and snatch an orange slice from his hand. She takes a bite, careful not to smudge the crisp line of her black lipstick.
“Barely,” Draco huffs, moving to sit and lean back on his hands. The breeze cools the layer of sweat on Draco’s skin, sending a shiver up his spine. He kicks off his shoes and sinks his toes into the sand with an exhausted sigh. A loud
“What the fuck are you doing?” Harry bursts through the door and yells over the blare of the alarm. “How long have you been in here?” He clambers onto the countertop to reach the horrid device, fumbling with the buttons before finally ripping it from its base on the ceiling. It falls to the floor; a smattering of dusty plastic shards decorates the floor on impact.
Another car passes, headlights foggy with the dense humidity of a Louisiana summer. The engine gurgles and sputters as the driver flips you the bird, rejecting your crooked thumb, pointed skyward in question. You release a frustrated sigh as that fifth or sixth or eleventh car disappears down the shadowed, two-lane highway, its red tail lights flickering like a warning against the inky black sky.
I’m not sure how long we huddle on the bathroom floor, cramped between the toilet and the shower. Long enough for the feathers to recede beneath my skin, for my wings to fold in on themselves and lie soft against my back. The sun has long set, shrouding the bathroom in darkness, as Harry still runs his hands through my hair, untangling the knots as he whispers lovely reassurances into my ear and presses kisses over my jaw.
“Come here, Draco,” he whispers, gesturing for me to step out of the shower. “Come on, babe; I’ve got you.”
A wash of magic ripples through the room as the protective enchantment renders them unnoticeable to any passersby.
Healer Perkins lowers her wire-rimmed glasses to the tip of her nose. Her smile is disconcerting as she stares pointedly at Draco and Hermione, both vulnerable at the front of the room.
He indulges the momentum too much, leaning far enough to rest his head on Malfoy’s shoulder. “Mmmm… What’re you doing, Malfoy?” he asks, settling into his newfound support.
You lean into the car for a better look, feeling your throat tighten as though the air’s been sucked straight out of your lungs. Malfoy still wears that signature grin, arrogant and too smooth as he flicks his wrist, dismissing the splotches of blood like spilled milk.
By the time they reach the common room, Harry’s legs feel like jelly and the gentle rocking in his skull has transformed to a near-drunken spinning. He leans on a table as the room turns about him and tries not to empty his stomach.
the dirty shoes and whisks them off to the hall closet, along with Harry’s rain jacket on the hook. Draco’s heart beats forcefully behind his ribs as he clenches his hands in quick succession around his wand. Determined, he removes every trace of the ghost he’s lived with for weeks.
“Happy birthday, Harry,” Draco whispers into Harry’s ear, catching the tender lobe between his teeth and soothing it with his tongue. Harry melts against him, settling his arms over Draco’s shoulders. With a cheeky grin, he walks Draco backwards, pressing him against the wall.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
“Gee. Thanks, Hermione,” he mumbles into his arm. His own voice is nearly unrecognizable, distorted.
After too much chocolate, Rose collapses in Ron’s lap, fully immersed in a sugar coma. Pansy rests her head on Ginny’s shoulder as she prods at the fire with a stick, eliciting a gasp of sparks as it takes another breath. As the sun dips below the darkening sea, Harry takes a seat next to Draco in the sand, brushing his bare foot over Draco’s shin before stretching his legs toward the fire. Draco shifts closer in the sand, lining their legs up, hip to ankle. The fire heats the bottoms of Draco’s feet and fills his lungs with a pleasant burn.
“The muggle donepezil is garbage,” Draco hisses, watching from between his fingers as an ant crawls across the cracked stone porch. “We even started mixing it with gingko. Nothing. He’s not getting better, and we’re just running in circles. It’s a waste of time.”
over her portrait (though he looks confident, I can see his chest heave, and there’s a slight tremble to his outstretched hand). My heart is in my throat when I turn to him, but the room stays quiet (always quiet). I don’t think my expression is enough to convey the way my gut curdles.
Hermione shakes her head before interjecting. “If he’s anything like Rose, it won’t matter when he goes to sleep. We kept her up until nearly midnight last year and she still tossed a present into our bed four hours later.”
Eventually, the Unspeakables arrived. It hadn’t taken long for them to find evidence of the curse lingering between the synapses of Harry’s brain, strangling Harry’s hippocampus like vines around a dying tree. But the curse’s roots were untraceable.
There are two stray kittens that meow under the yellow porch light, scratching expectantly at the back door. Every evening, Harry feeds them a tin of cat food and scratches under their chins while Draco pretends to roll his eyes and ignores the fact that he bought the extra tins to begin with.
“Patience, Potter. I’ve got a Pepper Up in my trunk; you can have it if you’d like. I’d offer a Dreamless Sleep, but I don’t think you’ll need it,” Malfoy whispers as he awkwardly tugs on Harry’s robes to keep him sitting straight.
“You’re right. And I sure as hell can’t lie to you now. What kind of person would that make me?” Draco huffs a laugh, but it’s unconvincing, even to his own ears. “I’m working on it. The medical board denied my first appeal, but we get to try again. Next week.”
Anxious anger burns a trail starting at the tips of my fingers, drawing claws to break through the skin beneath my nails and a black, tarry flush to creep towards my elbows like my arms have been dipped in soot. I roll my neck at the feeling of hundreds of feathery needles piercing through the skin of my collarbone, my neck, my shoulders. A flash of pain, lightning hot, grips my spine as a set of wings punctures the surface between my shoulder blades, hanging low in the tight space of the shower.
Harry’s eyes follow a flutter of movement at the opposite end of the stage to find Draco confidently climbing up to the platform, his gold-soaked dress robes flitting behind him. He takes his position as if he were a dancer, carefully planting his feet and smoothly raising his left hand to point his wand at Harry. The glimmer of string around Draco’s wrist catches Harry’s eye as he stares, transfixed by his opponent.
Hermione sighs and rests a hand over Draco’s shoulders, patting the sore and tired muscle. After a long stretch of silence, she finally says, “Well, let’s bring him home then.”
Draco leans forward to capture Harry’s lips in his, weaving his fingers into his own jumper and lining up the warmth of his body with Harry’s. Harry pulls back, gasping, and tucks a stray hair behind Draco’s ear, trailing his fingers across the sensitive skin of Draco’s neck.
“I’ll get them back, every single one of them, Harry,” Draco says, pressing their foreheads together and holding his gaze. “I’ll get you back.”
Down the hall, Walburga awakens with a frenetic urgency in her eyes after months of isolated slumber. Without hesitation, Harry casts a
Harry puzzles. As though conjured by the thought, he notices the thin, gossamer string that once again hangs from his wrist. He lifts the thread in his hands and traces its path with his eyes. It coils at his feet before taking an abrupt turn behind him, and out the door.
Harry huffs a laugh and says, “I didn’t know it either until, well, until I disabled them… I sort of remember a forest and a camp, but I don’t know why we even set the wards up. It’s all pretty fuzzy, still.”
he’d pondered over a cup of coffee the morning he found it in the mirror. He was hardly even thirty, but the silver hair stood out like a sore thumb in his otherwise dark mane.
Harry nods and wipes the wet from his own cheeks before swiping another tear from the delicate skin under Draco’s eye. He brings his hands to Draco’s chest, sinking his fingers into wrinkled robes and pulling him into a slow and savoring kiss.
Draco smiles and reaches for my hand. He brushes his lips over my knuckles and plants a kiss in the middle of my palm before pulling me onto his lap. Grains of sand cling to our hair, and sweat coats our skin. But the pleased hum that resounds in Draco’s throat is worth the discomfort and then some.
not the passing glance that you toss at the empty glass that’s sat on your end table for three days, not the glassy gaze of a Seeker fading into auto-pilot above the pitch. No, I’m talking about the undivided attention afforded to a tragic train derailment with dozens of fatalities, the careful pondering over a loaf of bread that may have gone off, the terrifying and wondrous stare of finding your enemy naked in your bed.
In violent opposition to Harry’s request, his body wrenches through a sob. And Harry is there, soothing his shaking shoulders, whispering lovely lies into Draco’s ear, planting kisses across every inch of Draco’s exposed skin.
Though this is definitely a low point since you’ve been on the run, it’s not the lowest. Not by far. No, the lowest is still Versailles. 2006. Fucking werewolves.
with his ankles crossed properly in front of him; others, he tucks into a muggle novel, his long legs criss-crossed and contorted beneath him. Occasionally, and more often in recent years, he dozes off with his arm tucked under his head, not yet ready to face the day.
“I don’t want to lose this again.” Tremors possess his bottom lip, coloring each word with a stutter, and a sheen paints his eyes. Harry pauses a moment as his brow furrows, and the next words that leave his lips emerge in a panic. “Is this what happens every day? I start to remember and then—”
“Oh,” he croons, shifting his hips to sink lower in his seat. “I can think of a lot of things we could do. In the car. Next to the car. On top of the car. If you're so inclined.”
Harry mindlessly waves his bare foot back and forth, the pads of his feet darkened from dirt. Arms crossed behind his head, he lounges in the sun with his eyes closed. Draco fights with the breeze as it ruffles the pages of his book before giving up to squint at Harry, shielding his eyes with his palm.
“What in Salazar’s name is a care home?” Draco asks. I ignore the question, because I know it’ll irritate him. Instead, I watch as Draco tosses the ice from his glass into the overgrown flower bed. He sets it aside and lays back, crossing his arms behind his head to look at the light-polluted sky. “Don’t tell me, I know it’s where old people disappear when no one wants them anymore. I found a gray hair the other day; did I tell you? Look, it’s here somewhere,” he says, pointing above his left ear.
“Come on through. She’s out on the back porch,” he says, bewildered, before prying Rose’s fingers from his beard.
For a brief moment, Draco allows himself to stare at the door and gather his composure. His Mind Healer’s droning voice echoes in his ears, instructing him to count his breaths, to lengthen his inhales to match his exhales. By the time Draco reaches ten, he’s closed his eyes, but an undercurrent of trepidation still thrums beneath his skin.
Draco thinks. He promised Harry blueberry waffles today, and, while Harry won’t remember, Draco keeps his promises.
“No need to apologize.” Draco takes a seat in the empty chair at the foot of the bed and berates himself for his oversensitivity. “So, Harry, how are you today?”
“I would’ve preferred no pulp, but needs must, I suppose,” Draco shrugs, ducking when Ginny tosses another orange his way.
“And what did you get me for my birthday?” Harry asks, ducking his head and trailing open-mouthed kisses across Draco’s jaw, the line of his neck.
“Did you know that you need two ingredients for a mimosa? Otherwise, you’re just a drunkard,” Draco says, teasing.
You twist your lip, pulling the tender flesh between your teeth and biting, hard, until a spot of blood blooms against your tongue. Malfoy's attention follows the uneasy fidget of your mouth. He licks his cherry-stained lips as he watches you climb into the Cadillac.
“Bloody hell, have you lost your marbles, Draco? They’ll send you straight back to Azkaban if you get caught, and I’ve got a feeling it’ll be a one-way ticket this time.”
Draco; get with the times. And are you going to pretend she’s wrong? All the pining, and moping, and sighing, lately? If I had a galleon for every time I heard a pet name fall from your mouth, I wouldn’t be wearing fake Louboutins right now.”
“Lunch on Sunday?” she asks, eyes fixed on Harry, sitting across from the smoldering logs in the fire pit.
You're too late. The raccoon didn't stand a chance against the front tire. Let alone the back one. You flinch, feeling the rattle of the wheel bearings in your bones.
Draco leans forward to rest his face in his hands and exhales sharply, feeling the weight of frustration across his shoulders.
Malfoy scoffs as he pushes off the car, waving a careless hand at the MACUSA Aurors on the ground. “Burn the bodies; let’s get out of here.”
“Sharp as a goddamn Snitch, you are.” He laughs, cruel but amused. “Yes, Potter. Been sucking necks almost as long as I've been sucking cock,” he says proudly, tilting his head so the light of the moon glistens off of his exposed teeth.
When the word leaves Harry’s lips, his magic immediately cocoons around Draco’s thoughts. The caress of familiar magic is warm, comforting, and almost overwhelming. For a moment, Draco works to regain his focus, resisting the lull of Harry’s gentle presence and directing Harry towards his carefully selected memories.
“Shh, Draco. Stop, please. It’s okay. I’m home now,” Harry whispers into Draco’s ear. “I’m home, and you didn’t give up. I’m home
“But I can teach you,” Harry slurs and moves to rest his foot on the rung of Draco’s stool, right between Draco’s legs. Luckily for Draco, Harry is too drunk to notice the vibrant flush that creeps up his neck. “Draco, come to mine, and I’ll let you listen to all the muggle music you want. It’ll be fun.” He rests his chin in his spare hand and smiles goofily while Draco stares back, unable to suppress the grin that spreads across his face.
you hiss. Though it’s hot as fuck outside, you shiver, perhaps from the idea of his teeth on your neck or the rush of pleasure at his hand on your cock, the humid night air raising goosebumps over the bare skin of your thighs.
A series of sharp knocks pulls Harry’s attention from his wardrobe choices. Golden sparks shower from the door with each tap, forming a glittering, reflective pool at the foot of Harry’s bed. The puddle ripples as the door swings open, revealing Draco Malfoy, leaning casually against the doorframe in his own scarlet red dress robes. A delicate, nearly translucent coppery thread hangs from his wrist.
“We won’t be needing this today, Odette.” Draco plants his hands on the counter and meets her gaze. He hopes his expression wordlessly conveys his thoughts, his plans, his gratitude.
“Er… Draco? Earth to Draco,” I say, tugging the hem of his shirt. “You in there, babe? It’s not a life-changing question.”
in a loopy script, fell from the air when Draco caught sight of Harry shrinking the armchair for the trash. “What in Salazar’s name are you doing?” he’d asked, eyes wide in disbelief. “It’s an antique; you can’t just toss it in the bin like a crumpled napkin.”
Draco nods, and his mouth goes dry. “It was a Ministry gala. They were serving berry tarts for dessert, and you said you wanted to—”
Ginny and Ron are already waiting on the beach when Draco lands on his knees in the cool, moist sand. His belly contracts as he dry heaves, resting on his elbows and holding his sweaty hair from his face. A gentle hand rubs his shoulders, and he catches familiar, fiery waves out of the corner of his eye.
Draco stands to offer his hand, and Harry reaches to interlace their fingers immediately. Some mornings are still better than others when it comes to Harry’s memory. Since coming to the cottage, however, there is a noticeable improvement in how quickly he’s able to ease the curse, as though lulling a serpent into a harmless stupor. Though his day-to-day memory is still shoddy at best, there are some days that Draco’s sure he notices a spark of familiarity in Harry’s eyes.
“‘M fine,” you mumble, raising your brows at the somewhat-comprehensible words that leap from your lips without thought. “Truck overheated.” You cock your head towards the sizzling S-10 that took a shit three hours ago. “Where ya going?”
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
Harry gazes at Draco, eyes wide in disbelief, before grasping at Draco’s hand. He holds their palms together, comparing the rings. Through it all, Draco relishes in the curious tilt to Harry’s lips, the determined set of his brow, and the warmth of his skin against Draco’s palm.
“I remember riding a dragon with… Hermione? Yeah, Hermione and Ron. We robbed a bank and rode a dragon. Isn’t that crazy?” he chuckles. “Its scales weren’t as hard as I expected them to be, or didn’t feel like they were anyway. That was one of the scariest things I think I’ve ever done, but if we hadn’t tried to steal from that vault, that poor dragon would still be there,” he says wistfully and laughs again. “That thing was huge.”
It doesn’t take long for everyone to recognize Harry and Draco’s need for privacy. Eventually, Hermione fakes a yawn, despite the spill of excess energy into the tap of her sandaled foot. With a nudge to Ron’s ribs, they both say their goodbyes and head towards the guest room in the cottage. Soon after, Pansy casts Draco a knowing smirk and drags Ginny by the hand in a dramatic and impossible search for shells in the dark.
“Well, if it isn’t the Boy Who Lived Too Many Fucking Times, stranded amongst the hungry alligators and rabid possums.” The arrogant quirk of Malfoy’s brow elicits a vibrant heat in your gut. “Why, perhaps, is the Exiled Savior hitchhiking in the middle of B.F.E.?”
Draco chuckles. “I was scared out of my mind when you walked over that night. I thought I played it off so well, but I wasn’t as successful as I thought. Clearly.”
“Cheesy,” Harry whispers into Draco’s ear, sending a shiver down his spine. “You’re getting soft, old man.”
The grin that spreads across Harry’s face is wicked and teasing as he stands and offers his hand. “Do we have time for a swim?” he asks as Draco lays his hand in his, accepting the help.
“Is the old man awake yet?” Ginny asks before tossing her enormous, patchwork bag on the countertop. She reaches her arm into a pocket, up to her shoulder, and ruffles around before raising her eyebrows, apparently finding her target. “We brought stuff for mimosas!” she giggles, displaying a bottle of champagne.
Draco summons a smile and leans in for a quick brush of lips between labored breaths. “Your favorite place in the world.”
“I know if you did, we wouldn’t be here. You’re a terrible liar, always were.” Harry pulls back to look at Draco, sinking his fingers into Draco’s shirt.
Draco pulls back to run his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip. “No. I don’t know how I’d live with myself if you didn’t completely understand what’s going on… Do you understand?” Harry nods, and Draco continues, “Last question: when did you know you were in love with me?”
Purposeful swaying soon evolves to a lazy circling of the kitchen, both men unwilling to abandon the moment entirely. Harry nestles his face into the hollow of Draco’s neck, inhaling the smoky-citrus of his cologne.
Harry shrugs. “It’s only scary until I forget again. Then I guess I don’t remember enough for it to matter.”
“Did your wife just call me soft?” Draco asks Pansy as she steals another slice of orange from his palm.
The next words that leave Draco’s lips are Harry’s own words, in Harry’s own voice. The curse that bursts from Draco’s wand crashes over Harry in overwhelming waves, rapidly slicing through the upper layers of his skin.
“Sometimes. If I look out the window and see brick instead of the sky, or if I think about air quality too much,” I answer with a chuckle. Draco plucks another strawberry from the cutting board, and I snag it from his fingers. He narrows his eyes in irritation, but a tell-tale curve of his mouth betrays his dramatic display of annoyance.
Time wears thin, wavering against each exhaled breath. Harry laughs about retiring and taking up bathtub-distilling as a new career, and then the laughter stops. There’s an odd twitch to his eye before he focuses his gaze back on Draco.
“Molting, I think,” I murmur around my toothbrush, scraping the frayed bristles violently against my gums.
“It was a very productive session… Stimulating, even,” Harry quips before dropping a kiss to the top of Ginny’s head and stealing an orange wedge from Pansy’s plate. “Now, I heard it’s my birthday.”
“I can’t believe how transparent they are. You’d think they would have the dignity to entertain the appeal,” Hermione hisses. “I knew it would come down to money; it always does.”
On Harry’s hundred-and-twenty-first night in St. Mungo’s, medical research papers and textbooks, both muggle and wizarding, litter Draco’s kitchen table. There’s a half-empty coffee cup sitting precariously close to the edge.
Malfoy proceeds to direct Harry to sit on the edge of his bed and bends down to unlace his shoes. Harry has lost all sense of control and sanity as he succumbs to a bizarre urge to tangle his fingers in the fine white blond strands of hair in front of him.
“Isla, stay with me,” Draco cautions, placing steadying hands on her shoulders. Her head ticks upright as she refocuses on the present. “Good girl. As for Healer Clemmons’ cheekbones, I’m afraid I’m not the one to ask. No matter, I’ll find her. Thank you, Isla.”
Harry glances up at Draco’s entry and says, “Oh, yes, come in. Sorry, I wasn’t expecting any more visitors today.” He reaches behind him and fumbles for the bracelet, slipping the oversized ring onto his wrist.
Draco clears his throat, watching as Harry wraps a stray thread around his finger, the skin blooming an angry purple at the lost circulation. “That’s correct, Harry. Your memory seems to improve throughout the day, but, overnight, all the progress seems to disappear, as if it never happened. It’s quite inconsistent from day-to-day. This must be frightening for you.”
“How many bodies do you think they have hidden in the walls?” I grin and try not to think about the answer too much.
Thoughts blurred, I gasp as he ruts against my arse, as I thicken in his hand and a heady rush soothes the irritable magic that bristles beneath my skin. I groan against the pressure of his palm over my throat, feeling the vibration in my chest.
“I know exactly where my marbles are, Ronald. They’re locked on that goddamn ward with the love of my life and your best fucking friend. I’m simply taking back what’s mine. Now, are you going to help me or not?”
“I could stay,” you say. Your guts shift pleasantly in your belly as he releases your finger with a loud
“We have time for a quick dip,” he answers as he reaches for the buttons of Harry’s shirt. “That is, as long as you don’t want to do anything else.”
Draco makes his way towards the Healers’ workstation that straddles the two sides of the ward. Healers that work Janus Thickey regularly call it
“Harry, darling, this had to happen. We wouldn’t be who we are without our scars, the hurt we’ve caused. But, you and I, we’re not done. It won’t always be this way. We won’t always be this way. It’s going to be alright, darling. It’s just not time yet.”
“I’d argue you’re even sexier, now,” Draco smiles, always with the right answer. He pats Harry on the bum in affirmation, but Harry recognizes the unspoken request for his coffee to be returned. Harry hands the mug over without protest and peers at the open book in Draco’s lap.
“We’ll get a dozen cats if it makes you happy. And no more bullshit. I think you’ve had enough for a lifetime.”
Draco makes his way towards them, snaking his arm around Harry’s waist. “Happy Christmas, by the way, Hermione. When are you due to pop this one out?”
In the tarry black, you only hear Malfoy as he leans in, ghosting his breath over your ear as he purrs, “Turn on a light.”
Instead of raising his wand, Harry feels his feet drag him towards Draco, as though drawn forward by something mystical, magnetic. The stage seems to lengthen as he walks, the distance between him and Draco stretching further and further. He can feel the prickling gazes of his classmates, dissecting and judging each footstep towards the Slytherin.
“It’s quiet,” Draco repeats. “Stay with me?” he asks, letting his chair legs settle on the floor with a
“We’re in a bit of a hurry today.” Draco takes a step back and focuses on lowering his defenses, on peeling apart the walls that tower around his mind. “Are you ready?”
Harry chokes a laugh between his rapid breaths. “I don’t know if I’d call the three days between shifts a honeymoon but… We went to Paris.”
Ron turns, eyes wide and smile bright as he stretches his arms wide for Harry. “Get over here, you.”
“Harry, I know I told you that we usually use the Pensieve for your memories, but today is going to be a little different,” Draco says, releasing a breath and placing his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “Do you trust me?”
“You look so pretty, Potter. So pretty with your eyes all fuzzy and your stupid mouth hanging open, just for me,” he murmurs, rutting against your thigh as you reach for his flies. “I want to taste you bleed.”
He’d been naïve to think his nightmares were gone for good. Apparently, Harry had been the light warding off the shadows all these years.
“My name is Harry James Potter. My birthday is the thirty-first of July, 1980,” he sighs, already anticipating the next question.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
“What do you mean?” Draco asks, holding the door open for Hermione to leave the darkened boardroom. She pushes the door closed and lowers her voice to a hushed whisper.
Ron stutters a laugh and runs his hand through the beard he’s had for nearly a decade. He pats Harry on the shoulder, evading the question that he clearly doesn’t know how to answer.
“A trip to the zoo. I made a donation so they’d name a ferret after you, and I wanted the two Dracos to meet.” Harry smudges a toothy grin over Draco’s skin as he tongues at the ticklish hollow at the base of Draco’s neck. “Best money I’ve ever spent.”
“So, why you? Why doesn’t Healer Clemmons do this with the rest of my—" he waves his hand in a vague gesture “—whatever the hell it is we do every day?”
Draco buries his nose in Harry’s neck, breathing him in and stuttering an exhale. He already smells like home, as though he discarded the hospital soap and chamomile like an extra layer of skin. A sob escapes Draco’s lips despite his efforts to contain it, and Harry runs his fingers in soothing circles over Draco’s back. Threads of guilt twist and tangle through Draco’s sense of relief, strangling it.
He finds Hermione cross-legged on the creaky wooden bench, chewing on a pen and bobbing her knee. Her normally pristine curls are thrown in a haphazard knot at the top of her head as she flips through last Sunday’s issue of
Harry’s comforting and familiar scent fills his lungs as Draco walks to Tesco’s in search of another piece of treacle tart.
Harry feels his eyelids grow heavy as he settles into the plump cushions of the loveseat, intoxicated by the dense smell of pine and citrus suffusing the sitting room. Outside, a gentle snow falls steadily, the large flakes illuminated by the porch light. The evening, in its ease and simplicity, gently lulls Harry into a wistful reverie of snowy mornings at Hogwarts, chunky knit sweaters and endless supplies of treacle tart.
Harry lays a firm hand at my lower back, tugging me ever-so-gently from my reverie. I notice the deepening darkness beneath his eyes as he rests his gaze on me, and I wonder if he notices my sunken cheeks. The ache in my chest grows as I run the pad of my thumb over the delicate and weary purple beneath his eyes. Harry smiles, and it’s quiet (always quiet), but he’s smiling, and I think it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in a year. He raises a forefinger to his lips and lifts an eyebrow in silent question. I mirror his grin and answer with a nod before leaning in and capturing his lips with my own.
Hermione laughs. “I guess so. As a public official, I would never endorse tax evasion, of course—” she wiggles her eyebrows to diminish her point “—but it’s a good thing your mum never disclosed this property.”
The sound that Harry releases can only be described as a growl, and Draco can’t help but chuckle at the brazen display of impatience.
The sun wasn’t even out when Draco woke me up this morning with the heat of his mouth and the weight of a suitcase at the foot of the bed. “I’ve got to get out of here,” he’d said between the kisses he smudged across my belly. “Come with me.”
“Malfoy.” Harry flashes a toothy grin at Draco and melts across the sticky bar top. “There are two of you,” he says and hiccups through a careless laugh.
Later, Draco unconsciously glances towards the clock on the wall as they emerge from a memory of a seeker’s game they had at the Burrow about a year ago. He could smell the wildflowers as the snitch flitted about the field, feeling neglected as they chased each other more than they worried about the game. The snitch had buzzed above their heads, glinting with the light of the setting sun, when they’d finally settled on their backs in the tall grasses, talking aimlessly and stealing kisses between breaths. They’d struggled to contain their laughter when Ron couldn’t find them for dinner but didn’t hesitate to hop up when Ginny hollered with a threat of a Bat-Bogey jinx from the back porch.
“Easy,” Harry scoffs and pulls at the collar of Draco’s shirt to expose his prominent collarbones. Draco tilts his head back to rest against the wall and tugs on Harry’s hips to increase the friction. “That first night in Paris, with the chocolate…” He lifts his head to meet Draco’s gaze. “We should do that again.”
“All mine, I’m afraid. I was feeling selfish this morning.” Draco grimaces in apology, but Harry grins, amused, forgiving.
In the dusty corner of Draco’s cell at Azkaban, he’d found a phrase, etched into the crumbling stone and barely visible through the erosion from the elements. When he couldn’t sleep, he’d trace his finger over the shallow scratches in the wall. After all of these years, he can still see the words if he closes his eyes:
“Hello, Healer Malfoy.” A petite witch with honey-blond hair and piercing green eyes skips towards Draco. Though she has energy in her steps and a quaint smile on her face, the cheer doesn’t reach her voice. Prior to her downgrade to Janus Thickey, Isla occupied a room on Draco’s unit, oscillating wildly between an agitated delirium and near-comatose unconsciousness.
“One more,” Draco sighs, rolling his aching shoulders and coaxing a crack from his neck. “I’ll try again.”
“I remember sneaking off with you onto a balcony at some party. You were so fucking posh in your embroidered robes, and you tasted like… like strawberries?” he whispers, breath ghosting over Draco’s lips.
“Well, hello, beautiful. Nice of you to join the world,” Draco murmurs and presses a chaste kiss to Harry’s lips. “Is this how you want to spend your last day on holiday?”
Draco shrugs. “Long. Started with an Amortentia overdose and ended with a very bizarre situation with a Draught of Living Death. My head hurts just thinking about it. You?” He plops into a chair across from her and steals a handful of Every-Flavor Beans from the plastic bowl on the table.
Harry nods before closing the gap between them and bringing his hands to Draco’s waist. “I’m all right,” he pants. “Draco, I’m all right.”
Hermione’s gaze is soft as she considers Draco’s confession. She twists her lips once before explaining, “I think it would’ve been strange if you didn’t have those moments. I’m actually impressed it only happened once. The point is that you stayed.”
“Let it go, Harry,” Malfoy croons, smudging his lips at the base of your neck as he stills the movement of his hips.
Draco sags with relief when Harry clings to his shoulders, just as a swallow seeks its familiar nest each spring. The relief is short-lived, however. Over Harry’s shoulder, Draco spies Isla, lingering in the hallway and meeting Draco’s stare, despite the protective charms. She tilts her head with a feline-like grace and flutters her fingers in a wave, apparently unphased by the rumbles emitted from the wards. Draco's heart thrums in his ears as he hesitantly waves back and proceeds to hold an upright forefinger against his mouth. His lips stretch into a grin against his finger when Isla smiles and brings her own finger to her lips. Though he can’t hear her
“Yes, Harry. May I?” Draco offers his hand, and Harry, always trusting, accepts it without hesitation. He lines up their palms to show off the matching bands that each of them wears on their ring fingers. Harry’s is looser than usual, but it’s undeniable that the shiny silver rings are a matching set.
Harry laughs. “Me? What about you? You’ve got the whole sexy, dark, and broody thing going for you.”
So, he did what anyone would have done really, and sat on the opposite end of the couch, stretching his legs alongside Malfoy’s. He pulled out the snitch he’d nicked from the broomshed the previous week and began to mindlessly fiddle with its wings. The evening proceeded uneventfully, allowing Harry to indulge in his favorite pastime of watching Malfoy: the way he chewed his lip and tapped his quill when he was stuck, the way he started to lazily drag his left hand across the parchment at the end of the night, smudging the ink on his palm.
“Where are we going?” I shout my question over the roar of the wind that pours through the car windows. The air is too heavy for the breeze to make much difference, but Draco always drives with the windows down, no matter how hot it is. I coast my hand on the current of humid air and watch the British coastline pass by in a smear of muted blues and grays.
Harry probably doesn’t need to be on the intensive side of the ward, but the potential public backlash over moving the Boy Who Lived to the lower acuity section, after no improvement, keeps him here. So, his days are filled with shifting lab results and ugly hospital gowns, thanks to an overly cautious St. Mungo’s and publicity-driven DMLE.
“Potter, you realize I don’t know a thing about muggle music, right?” he whispers into Harry’s ear, though his voice carries through the narrow focus of the memory.
Draco says. An urgency coats his voice, and fear burns his throat. His heart thrums in time with the irritated pulse of the wards as another layer shatters, emitting a brief glimmer as it falls, like the flash of a shooting star in the night sky.
“I never could tell if Mother was serious about the Veela blood.” I frown as Harry still stands, unmoving but for the tremble in his fingers. “Harry, why are you shaking?”
Draco’s fingers turn numb and cold, but his face is hot as his heart pounds behind his ribs. He lets his disbelieving stare smooth over each member of the Ethics Committee, lost for words as they all evade his gaze.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
The buttons slip easily from the gaps in the fabric, and Draco carefully slides the shirt from Harry’s shoulders.
A sense of emptiness unfolds when Harry releases the last thread of memory and recedes from Draco’s mind. They’re both breathless and sweating when they pull apart, and the smile Harry wears coaxes the last puff of air from Draco’s lungs.
Harry leans forward again, resting his elbows on his knees. He’s never been able to sit still, but the nervous habits have gotten worse with the memory loss. Some days, it’s like keeping track of a snitch.
Seeing Harry outside of St. Mungo’s feels like gazing at a cruel mirage, desperately longing for it to be true but knowing it’s impossible. Draco walks towards him slowly, his mind not yet ready to believe what his eyes are seeing. Mid-laughter, Harry glances towards Draco, eyes bright and trusting. Harry slips from under Ron’s arm and strides across the beach, meeting Draco with an embrace that lures the air from Draco’s lungs.
Over the years, Draco was careful to tend to this memory, to maintain its fidelity. He smiles weakly as the familiar sun-soaked beach comes into view, littered with shells and pebbles. Their cottage sits in the distance, tucked into a cove of trees whose leaves ruffle in the light summer breeze. Harry is sprawled, barefoot and bare-chested, over the hot sand while Draco sits cross-legged next to him on a towel, hunched over a book.
“Don’t look at me like that, Harry, I’d take you with me,” Draco promises and seals it between our lips with a chaste kiss. “You’re the only reason I’m still here to begin with.”
“There’s nothing you can do right now, darling. I’ve made my choices and so have you. We have to live with them. We have to make these mistakes,” Draco says softly, a sharp contrast to the wand digging painfully into Harry’s bare sternum.
Draco’s thoughts stray to Harry, as they are wont to do, as he plucks an orange from the table and picks at the peel, letting the pith cling beneath his fingernails. Memories blossom of an expanse of freckled skin, deepening laughter lines around plump lips, and purple and crimson bruises blooming beneath Draco’s teeth.
“Apparently, I was working. Something called an Auror? Healer Clemmons said I was on a job when I got hit with some kind of... curse? It made me lose my memory. Or some of my memories, anyway. No one seems to know what kind of curse it was, or if they do, they aren’t telling me,” he scoffs. “I guess my memory kind of… fades every night?” He looks to Draco with his head tilted in question.
he thinks to himself as his wand appears in his hand. He turns up his wrist and stares quizzically. The string is still there, swaying in a phantom breeze.
Wide-eyed and unconvinced he isn’t still lost in his wild dream, Harry reaches out to brush his fingers against Draco’s outstretched hand. He anchors himself in the coolness of Draco’s skin, in tracing the fine lines of his palm.Harry smiles to himself as he remembers Draco’s words as he stood, waiting patiently under the willow.
Harry’s left the cap off the toothpaste again, leaving it to ooze onto the bathroom countertop. I could easily dismiss the caked-on paste from the porcelain. All it would take is a snap of my fingers, a muttered jumble of pseudo-Latin under my breath to make it disappear. However, a crescendo of unfortunate events through the week culminated in a Ministry-issued number that replaced my name, a reminder of the creature that replaces my identity. The thought numbs my limbs, rattles my nerves, and prickles at the remnants of my fleeting patience.
Harry feels like Harry today, the real and full Harry. To Draco, he’s a lure on a line that continually gets ripped from his grasp. On days like this, he can’t decide whether he wants to smile or scream.
The heat of the shower burns my skin, painting my limbs and the tops of my feet in a pink, watercolor flush. I let the water strip away the remnants of the evening, the cigarette smoke that clings to my hair and the grease and salt lodged beneath my fingernails. It doesn’t wash away the memories of the Weasel’s grimace, or the distasteful curl of Granger’s lip. Instead, they linger, trapped in the clouds of steam like a bird’s wings, wet with oil.
Draco takes a tentative step towards Harry. He hesitates before gently laying his palms on Harry’s chest.
Harry glances deliriously at Hermione, unconvinced that she will allow Malfoy to take responsibility for his well-being. But she looks at Harry unsympathetically and shrugs her shoulders, a silent message of
“So needy...” Draco chuckles and watches as the vibrant blues of the sea begin to fade into the golden sand of the beach. The memory evaporates, and then they’re standing in the dim room, the glow from the Pensieve highlighting the curves of Harry’s face. “We’re so happy, Harry,” Draco says, stifling a hitch in his breath. “So happy, and we’re going to be happy again. I promise.”
“Is that so?” Odette asks, standing to meet Draco’s gaze from the other side of the counter. “What’s the plan, Draco?”
As Draco’s tears begin to dry, salty and sticky against his cheeks, he knows they’re on borrowed time.
With an uneven breath, Draco manages to say, “Harry, I have something for you, and I need you to trust me. Do you think you can do that for me?”
Without hesitation, Odette leans forward to capture them both in a warm hug, encapsulating them in a bubble of chamomile and lavender. “What am I going to do without my boys here? Talk to Este?” she laughs, and it’s wet and congested.
“Allow me, Granger,” Malfoy interrupts. “Alright, Potter, up we go. Come on, get up. Don’t give me that look... Your fragile pride is irrelevant under these circumstances. If you won’t go to the hospital wing, then it’s off to bed with you, before you infect the whole school with your intolerable stubbornness.”
“Never,” Draco whispers and watches Harry swallow the bitter potion. He thinks he can almost taste it, too.
Draco smiles at Harry as he twists the string around his wrist and gives it a stronger tug, pulling Harry forward.
“Slytherin cunningness comes in handy sometimes, doesn’t it?” Draco preens. “I’m just glad we had somewhere to go. He loves it here.”
Draco watches Harry climb into bed before settling in next to him, wrapping his arms over Harry’s shoulders and pulling him close. He knows precisely how long they lay with their limbs tangled, content to rest their heads on the same flat, crinkled pillow. Though he savors each rise and fall of Harry’s chest against his own, the leering sense of time is a constant and demanding presence. As he wills the minutes to slow, begs them to stretch, time shakes its head and lurches forward. It refuses to release Draco’s sense of security as the curse lures Harry’s mind away from him.
“Hmm, eternity in an hour…” Draco hums. “That cottage is your favorite place in the world, and nine times out of ten, I could find you on
I tuck a lock behind Draco’s ear before I pull away, letting his hair slip from my grip. It feels like a significant loss, but Draco always makes me feel more than I want to. My hand feels out of place resting in my lap, as though I’ve grown an extra appendage.
So Draco tells Harry about fixing up Grimmauld Place all those years ago. About the doxies that had reclaimed their home in the drawing room, and how Harry nearly set the house on fire while he chased the last one down the stairs. He laughs when he tells Harry about their first time out at a muggle club, both wide-eyed and mystified as they discovered a new world devoid of prying eyes. Harry snorts when he remembers Theo Nott finding them in the bathroom, with Draco looking properly debauched against the corner stall and Harry still on his knees.
Isla is forgetful because she unintentionally consumed an ill-advised concoction of chemicals, both muggle and wizarding. Draco could only do so much.
He lays his palms on either side of Harry’s face, gentle, trembling, before stuttering, “I thought you deserved better than this. We were emotional, tipsy, and I didn’t want to wake up to you thinking it was a horrible mistake.”
Draco turns away from the wards and carefully shrinks the bits of Harry’s life they’ve collected over the weeks, placing them in the bag on Draco’s hip that already contains the rest.
“No liquor necessary, my love. I find your very presence intoxicating enough, most days,” Draco confesses, voice syrupy-sweet as he pulls Harry close and wraps his arms loosely around Harry’s waist. “
The morning proceeds as though the last year never happened, with a few exceptions. They drink one too many mimosas before Ginny remembers she left pastries in the bottom of her bag. So they all drink one more and pick at the squished lumps of flaky dough and mashed fruit. Occasionally, Ginny or Pansy will talk about
“Hush, you. Pay attention,” Draco hisses, but it holds no venom. He nods towards their younger selves, arguing about Merlin-knows-what, and his heart flutters as he realizes that, even then, he only had eyes for Harry.
“He looked great, Draco. Don’t worry. He’s still got that Auror constitution. Just because he doesn’t remember, doesn’t mean his body won’t. But I’m sure you’ll figure that out soon enough.” Ginny winks before turning her steady gaze toward the dark, briny waves of the bay.
into the thick air. The bird squawks, an unnatural caw that burrows into your nerves like nails on a chalkboard. You wave carelessly at the crow, not bothering to remove your wand to summon that halo of green light. Bored, you watch its lifeless body fall to the ground, wings spasmodic with the last tiny bursts of electricity that course through the volucrine corpse.
“Among other things,” Draco confirms just as Harry appears in the doorway. His salt-and-pepper hair is ruffled from sleep, falling from the loose bun he’s tied at the top of his head. He’d told Draco a couple months back that he wanted to grow it out. Draco had chuckled, remembering how many times he’s heard Harry say those words over the years, only for the idea to lose its sense of appeal weeks later. Much to Draco’s surprise, this time it actually stuck.
Draco traces his fingers along the back of Harry’s neck before moving southward, etching circles with his nails into Harry’s lower back, where he knows a strange patch of freckles lives and dimples rest above his bum. “I’m surviving, Harry. But I won’t be living again until you’re home.”
The memory smears in a wash of color before Draco and Harry emerge from the Pensieve. Harry swipes his hair from his forehead before looking at Draco with a confused furrow to his brow.
“Not much better. Merle isn’t looking so good,” she explains, her gaze shifting again to the corner room with crimson displays flashing outside the door. “Never seen an
“What’s your favorite color?” Harry asks on day one hundred and forty-two, precisely two weeks following St. Mungo’s Ethics Committee’s denial of his release. Ignorant of his mandated captivity, he sits at the head of his hospital bed with his legs draped over Draco’s lap. Janus Thickey’s anti-apparition wards hum in Draco’s ear as he leans against the wall. An encouraging spark glimmers in Harry’s eyes as the curse takes a breath and loosens its grip.
As Draco leads Harry back to his room, he’s sure to walk along the edge of the fishbowl so he can pocket the vial of Dreamless Sleep that Odette leaves on the countertop for him each night.
“Harry, look at me, please, love.” Draco’s pulse bounds in his fingertips as he caresses Harry’s cheek. “We’re going to figure this out.”
“Oh, I love this one,” Draco says, minutes, perhaps hours, later as the sounds of a piano pleasantly fill the kitchen. He starts to tunelessly sing along, “
Harry doesn’t answer as I lean across the sink, poking at the delicate spine with my fingertip. He just stares dumbly at my reflection, mouth agape and eyes wide as saucers. I huff a laugh through my nose, feeling the universe’s sick sense of humor settle heavily over my bloodied chest.
“Granger, would you mind using the floo in the bedroom? Let a sleeping giant lie, no rest for the wicked and all that.” Draco casually waves a hand in the direction of the sleeping toddler.
They’ve established a routine these last few months. Odette never offers information until Draco asks, and Draco only asks when he’s ready. Some days, they chat for a while about their patients, or books, or the most recent batch of clueless residents. Other days, Draco can’t stand the small talk.
“You’re awfully wordy when you’re drunk, you know?” I laugh, and Draco scowls. The lingering whispers of firewhiskey burn my throat. “And, Jesus, you’re thirty, Draco. Stop acting like they’re going to carry you off to a care home any minute.”
“Er…” Harry ponders as he waltzes into the bathroom, running an aimless hand through his hair. In the reflection, I watch him smooth over my naked back and bum with heavy-lidded eyes, lips tugged upward in an appreciative grin and glasses crooked on the sunburnt bridge of his nose. I think he might be perfect, and it terrifies me.
Close to midnight, Hermione appears in the floo, eyes teary and swollen. Draco nods towards the coffee, still hot in the corner, and clears a stack of books from a chair. When Hermione sits, she shrugs and runs her slender fingers over the rim of the chipped coffee cup.
Draco leans back in his chair and laces his hands together in his lap, granting silent permission for Odette to continue.
“You asked me to marry you later that night,” Draco says. “We were drunk on awful gin that you brewed in your scummy bathtub, and you nearly fell over when you went to get the rings from your dresser. You’d had them for months. You said you knew you were going to use them one day, that you wouldn’t give up hope.”
“Imagine the fly that takes its last breath and keels over in Rita Skeeter’s office. It lies in agony, never to find eternal peace amidst the incessant ranting about whatever’s caught her attention that minute. Now imagine she steps on the fly, to make sure it’s really miserable.” Draco tries for a smile but knows he’s failing.
“Draco, we’re going to get through this,” Harry whispers, although he has no additional information to offer. Just hope and trust. Draco glances down at their hands and catches the shiny glint of Harry’s scar:
They sit comfortably in each other’s company, sipping on milky tea and chatting easily as Scorpius dozes blissfully in the next room. Hermione cheerfully explains how she was booted from her own home so Ron and Rose could wrap her gifts, even though Rose spilled secrets all week. Harry accidentally reveals the trainer broom he’s bought for Scorpius and, despite the merely performative criticism from Draco, wholeheartedly defends his decision (“He’ll be five next month… Don’t pretend you weren’t thinking of buying one for his birthday!”). Empty mugs are refilled. Biscuits appear and quickly disappear. Scorpius sleeps on.
, glowing golden over the sand, and makes the same decision he’s made half a dozen times before. One day, he and Harry may need to have that conversation again, but it’s not today.
Draco sighs. “We weren’t on the best of terms back then. I was in denial about a lot of things, your apparently inescapable gravity being one of them.” Draco flourishes his hand towards Harry as though he’s stating the obvious. “We had a lot to learn. About the world. About each other. And, honestly, look at you!” Draco smiles and nudges Harry with his elbow. “Who wouldn’t be nervous with you looking at them like that?”
Younger Draco lifts his head, eyes puffy and red-rimmed. The defeated look he gives Harry makes Draco feel vicariously vulnerable, delicate, unfolding.
Odette sniffles but mirrors Draco’s grin. “All right, gentlemen. How long does Este need my help for?”
“Just glad you remembered, is all. I was looking forward to those waffles, today,” Harry says with a wink. “Also, it’s hot when you wear my pants.”
Harry nods, because of course he does, and Draco removes his wand. He places the wand in Harry’s hand before he continues. “There’s a spell, Harry, that I want you to use. You’ve used it before, but it’s not one they’ve been practicing with you since you were hurt. It’s going to allow me to share my memories with you without the Pensieve. How does that sound?”
Harry pauses his ministrations at the curve of Draco’s neck and groans, frustrated. The noise rattles through Draco’s chest. “How are you living like this?”
He doesn’t mention the failed Legilimency trials or the experimental muggle pharmaceuticals. It’s selfish, he thinks, but, some days, he can’t bring himself to talk about anything but Harry as he relates to himself.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
There are eighteen stepping stones from the paint-stripped front door to the beach. Every afternoon, Draco counts them as he and Harry take their walk along the shoreline.
echoes between the stone walls of the garden followed by easy laughter and the click of heels over cobblestone. Ginny and Pansy appear in the doorway, their hair windswept from apparition and cheeks glowing.
“Harry! Will you come here for a minute?” A rustle of irritation blooms beneath my skin, scaly skin and ivory feathers shifting restlessly, eager to surface. With a forced sigh, I snap my eyelids shut, concentrating on pulling the musty bathroom air in and out of my lungs.
Draco nods in affirmation. “Yes, dear heart,” Draco answers, and Ginny snorts. He rolls his eyes before continuing, “You saw the photos? And the notes?” Harry nods but his expression lacks surety. “Come now, let’s go collect your marbles. Then we’ll have breakfast.”
In his well-inebriated state, Harry slips forward on his bar stool and catches himself on Draco’s knee. Ron and Hermione’s images sharpen in a nearby booth as the younger Draco catches them out of the corner of his eye. They whisper to each other, eyes darting from Draco, to his knee, to Harry’s face, and back to Harry’s thumb, rubbing circles into Draco’s thigh.
Draco pinpoints the moment Harry understands his meaning in the way his eyebrows shift, in the puzzled twist of his lip.
Harry spots the fading tattoo on Draco’s collarbone, peeking out from his open collar. The inky dragon’s tail flits lazily across his thin, pale skin, occasionally flicking up towards Draco’s neck. Laced with charms, the magical ink is opalescent in the morning light.
“'M not sick. Jus’ need sleep,” Harry protests as he rests his chin on his hands. Through his eyelashes, he watches Malfoy pick at the skin of his nail bed, the short and chewed nail of his thumb.
Draco sheds the sheet from his shoulders, revealing the pale and marred expanse of his chest. The shiny scars catch the hazy morning light in the way a wind chime is made more beautiful by a gentle breeze. I reach out to run a finger over the curved line above his hip, but he catches my hand in his before I can feel the smooth flesh against my skin. With a mischievous grin, Draco twines my fingers in his and presses my hand into the floor above my head.
Draco nods and leans precariously on the back legs of his plastic lawn chair. “It’s quiet—” his stare glazes for a fraction of a second before he continues “—and we can see the stars.”
Bad whiskey and peppermint. Draco’s cheeks taste like salt, but in a good way. The pale skin of his neck smells like sunscreen and buzzes under my lips when he hums.
“Fuck, you taste delicious,” he murmurs, rubbing soothing circles over your shoulders as his cum drips between your thighs, already sticky with the bloody river that's overflowed from the slices in your neck. “I can heal you, if you want.”
Draco lunges through the hearth, absently dropping a peck on the top of Rose’s head before striding through the quaint and modest Weasley home. Toys litter every spare inch of floor space, and books with broken bindings and crinkled parchment occupy most of the tables and shelves. What used to make Draco wrinkle his nose in distaste now makes him yearn for the normality of it all. For the filled spaces and occupied rooms.
“What’s wrong?” I ask, eyes wide and incredulous as an unhinged laugh crawls out my lips. “Are you seriously asking me that question?”
“It’s too dark out here,” Draco huffs. “I’m sure there's gray hiding somewhere in that untameable mop.”
Ginny sticks out her tongue and removes a jug of orange juice from her bag, waving it dramatically at Draco in demonstration. “Happy?”
“I'm sure it wasn't.” Malfoy swallows, his Adam's apple bobbing along the slender, porcelain column of his throat. “So… what's the plan, Potter?”
The kitchen flares in a bright green light as the floo roars to life. Past-Harry spills from the hearth in blood-stained Auror robes. He frowns when he lays his eyes on Draco, but his gaze isn’t malicious.
Draco sags under the weight of Harry’s question. “Nearly three months, Harry. I’ve visited you five days a week, every week, with one exception. Your best friends visit on the other two days. They’re called Ron and Hermione.”
He sticks the note just above the photo and smiles. A wrinkle-free Draco waves at the camera while Harry sneaks a hand behind his back to pinch his bum. Harry cackles while Draco poorly feigns a scowl, and the photo starts over on its loop.
When Harry opens his eyes, the ceiling begins to rain, the droplets sparkling and silver. They smell of old books and oranges and cling to Draco’s loose, saltwater waves, the tip of his nose, the pout of his lips.
“What are you still doing in bed? We’re going to be late,” Draco hisses as he treads through the puddle to stand at Harry’s bedside, leaving glowing footprints on the wooden floor behind him.
For a moment, however brief, you're back at the Ministry, surrounded by heads and bodies. You can control it, the wild magic that lurks beneath your skin. You told them so, but they didn't listen. Didn't believe you.
Odette’s eyebrows disappear behind her tightly wound curls, and her stare abandons the potion to alternate between Draco and Harry. Draco simply huffs a laugh, shrugs, and says, “Odette, thank you. For everything. I don’t know how I would’ve gotten through these months without you.”
“Do you think this is as good as it’ll get?” she asks, tugging her leg upwards to rest her chin on her knee.
“What if I don’t sleep?” Harry breathes into Draco’s mouth before moving to his neck, delicate bruises blooming across pale skin under his teeth. “Will I keep my memories if I don’t sleep?”
While Hermione takes her night with Harry, Draco spends the evening hunched over the table in the low light, poring over every journal and book he could get his hands on at the library that morning. As the night goes on, his intuition is affirmed. The greatest minds in memory medicine and healing all call for the same thing: familiarity, routine, a firm sense of grounding in the known.
Clad only in his hospital gown, Harry meanders across the kitchen, and Draco can’t decide if he looks horribly out of place or strangely suited to the grungy and eclectic feel of Grimmauld. Maybe both.
“How do you think it went, Odette?” Draco says, sagging into his seat and laying his head in his hands. The unsturdy chair rocks between two legs as he shifts his weight back and forth.
“Because it doesn’t fucking exist,” Draco spits, stepping forward. “The magical world has treated memory disorders the same way for decades: by leaving patients to rot on Janus Thickey’s low acuity ward with no real action towards improvement. The last research study The Ministry funded for memory curses was nearly fifty years ago, and they cut their trial short—”
“Thank you, Harry. As I said, my name is Healer Malfoy, but please call me Draco. Is it all right if I ask you a few questions?” Draco stands in the doorway, shoving his hands in the pockets of his robes and finding comfort in the vial between his fingers.
Harry sits on the floor next to him and gently pulls Draco onto his lap. Draco doesn’t fight it, but buries his head in Harry’s neck and wraps his trembling arms over Harry’s shoulders. The memory blurs as Harry rubs circles into Draco’s back, and Draco crumbles like shattered glass under solid footsteps.
“No. No worse, no better. Only difference is, today, when I shoved another vial of Dreamless Sleep down my husband’s throat before he had the chance to forget my name, he asked me to come home. He wants to come home, Hermione, and all I could do was weep, and nod, and give him more empty fucking promises.”
Draco closes his eyes, listening as Hermione taps her foot impatiently. “I didn’t say that. I’ve read about muggle practices for these situations, and I think we have a chance to institute an
“Quite personal to you both,” Healer Perkins corrects, clicking her tongue against her teeth in disapproval. “Which is likely why your judgment is clouded. It is simply unacceptable for Mr. Potter to be relinquished from the care of Healers in the middle of his long-term commitment with no visible signs of improvement. Not only is it potentially dangerous for Mr. Potter, but to others, as well.”
Hermione pats Draco’s shoulder before standing from the bench. “I don’t think it would’ve mattered where you went, as long as he had you. Not everyone would’ve stayed, Draco.”
“Probably,” you say, wiping a tear from your eye. You lay a hand over his wrist at the steering wheel, feeling nothing but stillness beneath the smooth skin under your thumb. “And you’re a fucking vampire.”
Harry didn’t sleep the first night they used the Pensieve. He fought his heavy eyelids and rejected the call for slumber with a familiar stubborn ferocity. Draco sat at his bedside, helpless, as Harry refused to sleep. By morning, Harry was manic, tugged between reality and the curse that twisted and vined around his memories. His magic was mercurial, wild, bursting windows and luring Healers into a sense of delirium with a wordless
“Don't have one. Haven’t had one since 2004,” you mutter, crossing your arms over your chest. Your vision blurs as you stare at the road, a concrete haze as it slips beneath the vehicle, and then—
“Are we doing this or not, Malfoy?” you snarl, letting a subtle glow leak from the tips of your fingers. It feels good, letting it out. You watch as the soft light veils Malfoy’s face, revealing the slim ring of silver that lines his blown pupils.
There are thirty-two freckles on Harry’s left shoulder blade. Every night, Draco kisses them, one by one, and traces the twenty-four bumps of Harry’s spine with his fingertips.
Harry’s eyelids flutter shut, as his body falls into a rhythm that is simultaneously familiar and unrecognizable. The kiss feels easy, instinctual, like it’s one of many. They linger a moment as Draco traces his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip before he parts with a gentle nip at the sensitive flesh.
She pulls back, wiping her tears on her sleeve before waving her wand over a drawer beneath her. The drawer unlocks with a click, and Odette hunches as she rummages around. After a moment, she rises and rolls Harry’s familiar wand across the counter. Harry is quick to pocket the contraband, and Draco smiles.
“What’s the verdict on your birthday?” he asks, jaw shifting uncomfortably against Harry’s bony shoulder.
I shake my head and lay my hand over his, watching the pale blue waves crash over the rocky coast. With even my simplest questions unanswered, I don’t ask why we left, and I find I don’t really care.
“Sure. Of course,” Draco sighs, tilting his forehead against the door to look at Hermione. “Hermione, I know it’s Ron’s night, but do you think he’ll mind—”
When the ink was fresh, Draco complained relentlessly about the near-constant tickling sensation as the restless Antipodean Opaleye came to life across his skin. Now, Harry probably notices the little movements more than Draco does, still enraptured by the dragon’s shimmering scales when the sun hits them just right.
I tumble into his arms, catching a blood-stained, ivory wing on the shower door and jostling Harry’s glasses. As the fog of the mirror clears, I watch as my face appears, nose elongated and eyes pitch-black, the skin of my neck and arms cracked where the feathers have broken through the layers like an iceberg piercing the sea. With a stuttered sob, I grip Harry’s shoulders and tuck my face into his neck, unable to contain myself anymore.
Harry is sure he’s hallucinating at this point because Draco Malfoy just called him by his first name. Draco Malfoy is stroking his thumb across Harry’s ribs in a gesture of comfort and reassurance. Draco Malfoy is looking at him with worry and concern and something else that Harry can’t identify in his delusional state of mind. Maybe he should have listened to Hermione and gone to Madam Pomfrey...
Harry emerges in the Great Hall. He’s lost Draco, but finds himself shuffling along an elevated dueling stage. Gilderoy Lockhart, aged and senial, waves his arms flamboyantly as he argues with Peeves in the corner. Harry looks down from the stage to watch his eighth-year classmates filling the audience.
“I could kill you, you know?” he says, as if you don’t already know that, as if you care. “Won’t be able to use your magic to save you.”
Our dinner plates are just as we left them, except not quite. The pasta is molded and emits a foul stench. My fork is tilted precariously on its edge, as though the ghost of my former self may settle at the table any moment to nibble at a decaying piece of courgette.
Draco tucks himself into Harry’s side, laying his head over Harry’s chest. The sound of Harry’s heartbeat is steady in his ear.
After trudging through the front door, Draco shucks his robes and tosses them over a vacant chair. He flicks his wand at their grungy coffee pot, relaxing ever-so at the familiar sputter of the heating water. It’s not enough to still his tapping foot while he waits for the pot to fill. Mug in hand, he catches himself in the mirror and realizes Harry’s not the only one who’s lost weight over these months.
“Harry, you don’t look so well. Are you alright?” Concern colors Hermione’s voice as it joins the sounds of the Great Hall echoing thunderously in Harry’s ears. The feeling of being trapped in an echochamber is made worse by the painful pressure behind his eyes, his cheeks, his forehead.
Harry peels Draco’s hands from his face, cradling them in his own, and they sit for a while, steeping in Draco’s confession.
Draco smiles before capturing Harry’s lips again, allowing his tongue to leisurely explore Harry’s mouth, morning breath and all.
A slick finger, a murmured satisfaction blended with a subtle hint of praise, a sharp pain followed by a flood of bliss as he shoves his cock in your arse without warning. You release a groan as he starts to pound into you, relentless as he grazes the point of his teeth over your neck.
My mind provides me with an alphabetized list of the horrors that may have followed us through that broken window. The creatures summoned from wives’ tales and children’s stories, no longer contained to the pages of a book.
When Harry wants to groan, he claws his fingers into my hips, and when I want to gasp, I kiss him harder, smothering the sound between us.
Draco spent a few days reading up on furniture restoration spells, and before long, the chair was good as new, no longer splitting at the seams and its deep cerulean velvet, smooth and unstained. A couple of decades later, that chair is still a staple of Draco’s morning routine. Occasionally, when he’s feeling a bit prickly, he likes to remind Harry that he almost threw it away.
A bead of sweat trickles down the back of Harry’s neck, tickling his spine as it makes its descent down his back. Exhausted, he collapses with his head in his arms at the eighth year table, fighting the nauseating feeling of drifting off to sea. He tightly wraps his clammy fingers around the cool edge of the table, in effort to anchor his mind as it sloshes about in his skull.
Harry pauses for a moment, rubbing the sheets between his fingers as he leans further into his hands and stretches his lanky legs out across the mattress. “Er… 2012?”
“Says there’s a vacancy,” I mutter skeptically as we survey the crumbling Illinois motel in front of us. We took a portkey to the States a few weeks back with no goal in mind, and we rented a convertible, bright green, per Draco’s request. There’s an outdated map in the glovebox, but we’ve made do, stopping when we’ve felt like it and driving onward when we haven’t.
When he stands, Harry admires the array of crumpled wrappers, half-eaten Cauldron Cakes, and Every-Flavor beans that litter the floor. Pillows and quilts are haphazardly strewn about as well, a necessary precaution when introducing a four-year-old to Fizzing Whizbees. He can’t help but smile at memories of Draco’s horrified expression when Scorpius nearly tore down the curtains.
part of you has wondered what it’d be like to feel Malfoy’s tongue on your throat. Your magic rumbles under your skin, restless as anticipation surfaces from between your overwrought muscles, lying in wait beneath the layer of sweat that covers your chest.
“We danced, quite terribly. You ordered another firewhiskey, but I drank it for you. You tried to argue with the owner’s portrait on the wall, and we both got kicked out.”
Draco leans awkwardly against the window with a jacket balled up as a makeshift pillow. Before he lets himself close his eyes, he mutters, “Wake me in two hours, Harry. You don’t need to drive all night.”
As exits pass on the motorway and the smell of salt air fills my lungs, I think to ask the questions that I should’ve asked this morning. I was too lost in Draco’s hands, pulled too far under his current, to care.
Grief washes over Draco in waves as they seek solace in each other’s arms. Grief for time lost, for time that continues to be stolen. Draco lets his tears flow freely, unable and unwilling to restrain them. Harry smears kisses over his cheeks, and the salt clings to his lips when he brings them back to Draco’s. It feels like the relief of ice water on a sunbaked afternoon mixed with the desperation of a calamitous love, hurtling from a cliffside towards the treacherous waters below.
Before Harry and I got married. After the War. Before the Ministry so graciously allowed me a wand again. After Harry lost the vision in his left eye as the cursed scar tissue tightened its grip.
Satisfied, Draco snicks the bathroom door shut behind him and methodically moves through his new morning routine. He brushes his teeth, runs water through his hair, and proceeds to check the notes labeling Harry’s toothbrush and soap. There’s a photo from their wedding taped to the bathroom mirror, and Draco is careful to straighten the fading sticking charm. With an outstretched hand, he summons the pen and sticky note from atop the bathroom cabinet and writes his morning note for Harry.
Tears still stream like rivers down both of their faces when Harry swallows the vial of Dreamless Sleep an hour later, but a tiny, delicate flame of hope burns in Draco’s chest. He pulls a new lumpy and misshapen blanket from his bag, courtesy of Pansy’s latest attempt at knitting, and drapes it over Harry’s shoulders. As Harry drifts off to sleep, he leans down to place a kiss on his forehead before casting a
On that first night, if someone had told him that he’d still be doing this after three months, he wouldn’t have believed them. As the days went on, his hope dwindled like fragile petals in a late evening storm. Then, after weeks with no progress, he instead told himself this would get easier, that he would get used to it.
Autumn air lingers in the living room, dewy and smelling of the earth as it slips in through the open windows and patio door. Draco hovers over me with a crooked smile and slides my glasses onto the bridge of my nose, bringing his face and the room around us into focus. We’re surrounded by a mound of blankets and pillows strewn in front of the hearth. The clock on the mantel says it’s half nine.
“The skin on the back of the hand is very sensitive to minute temperature differences. You should have learned this in first-year potions, honestly. Anyway, you’re hot.” Malfoy coughs and Harry watches a faint blush paint the paleness of his neck. Irritated, Malfoy deliberately clasps his hands together, laying them on the table before hurriedly clarifying, “I mean, you feel hot. Your temperature. You have a fever.”
Draco has seen Hermione angry, truly angry, a handful of times over the years, and has rarely been on the receiving end of that anger. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t wish that wrath on anyone. However, today—
“This road’s not safe for a pretty face like yours.” It’s a crisp voice that sounds like home, melded with the honey-sweet drawl of the South and accompanied by a pale, slender hand, beckoning you as it appears over the roof of the Eldorado. “Need a ride?”
With a flick of his wrist, Draco starts the coffee pot and plops into a chair at the kitchen table, resting his bare feet on the wicker stool across from him. Another meow from Patches prompts the continuation of his morning routine as he directs his wand at a tin of cat food, cracking open the lid and emptying it into the little bowl on the countertop. Draco snorts at the glare he gets in thanks. He watches with amusement as Patches hops gracelessly onto the counter and settles in for breakfast like she hasn’t eaten in years.
The passenger seat of the slick, ruby red Cadillac is splattered in bloody rorschach tests that match its exterior. A rusty scent floods your nostrils, burns as it prickles the delicate skin and hits your brain, heady with the rush. You fling open the door, unhesitating as you hit the overhead light to lift the veil of darkness from your anonymous philanthropist.
“It’s not important, Harry,” Draco says, cupping Harry’s cheek and pulling him in for a kiss as soft as the gentle waves beside them. Draco slips his tongue between Harry’s lips, tasting the lingering marshmallow and chocolate. “It’s not important,” he repeats, as though he can make it true if he just makes Harry swallow the words one more time. A sense of urgency overtakes his movements as deft fingers work at Harry’s pants, and then his own, until they both stand, naked and vulnerable, under the moonlight.
“It’s okay that you’re here. You can always come here,” Harry affirms and watches as Draco slides down the wall, sinking to the grimy kitchen floor and burying his face in his hands.
“Harry worked for the Ministry when he got hurt. It’s a major liability if he doesn’t get better, and letting him out without improvement looks like they’re admitting defeat. The possible press coverage alone gets the Minister’s knickers in a twist. The Savior of the wizarding world was injured on his watch.” She raises her eyebrows to emphasize her point. “Not to mention the liability if he were to get hurt when he leaves, or hurt someone else, if they approved your appeal.”
Draco feels his fragile cage of rib bones collapse on his burning lungs. His fingertips turn numb, and his lip quivers as he fights to maintain his composure.
Around noon, Hermione and Ron tumble through the floo with Rose in tow. They find Pansy and Gin asleep on the beach under an opaque umbrella charm while Draco and Harry amble along the shoreline, barefoot in the cool tide and in search of shells. Rose squeals as she toddles towards them, reaching sticky hands skyward and begging for Harry to pick her up and spin her around. And he does, even though the look he casts Draco says he’s not quite sure whose child she is.
“Oops,” Malfoy says, tapping his fingers against the steering wheel to the beat of a song you can't hear. When you look at him, it feels as though you're seeing yourself from just outside the car, clinging to the window frame as you watch yourself watch Malfoy with that same, stupid, open-mouthed stare you wore all those years ago. You can’t pull your eyes away as the thick, midnight air ruffles the open collar of his shirt, as he runs his tongue over his plump lower lip, as the muscle of his thigh flexes with each shift of the gear.
. The day the mugs released, Draco had strolled down Diagon, howling and carelessly swinging his shopping bag at his side. “I couldn’t help myself… I’ve bought two of each,” he’d snorted, pulling one of the ridiculous mugs from the bag and admiring the looped photo of Harry trying to look graceful on a broom. “These are so awful, they’re brilliant,” he’d cackled. “Don’t you dare tell the Weasel I said that.”
Draco opens his eyes and focuses on funneling the pulse of magic to his fingertips, initially directing his wand toward the door.
Harry gazes open-mouthed at Draco’s chest, running a hand over his pale skin and the soft flesh of his belly.
“If I’d known you remembered how to disable those wards, I would’ve volunteered to pack your things,” Draco gasps, resting against the silent wall.
The kitchen table sits in the corner, covered in a layer of dust and grime. My chair is still here, shoved against the wall, and Harry’s lies on the floor (though they aren’t really
“It took you forever to convince me to go camping, but I’m so glad we did, Harry. It was so good; you were so good,” Draco’s words trample over each other to leap from his tongue.
Draco grimaces. “Close, Harry. Very close.” There is no easy way to correct these answers, Draco’s discovered. “It’s 2017. Good try though.”
He moves to stand behind me, wrapping his hands over my ribs and dotting honeyed kisses along my neck and shoulders like he can’t see the rustle of feathered plumes tucked deep in the sinewy fibers. Though guilt twists in my gut, strangling my lungs and wringing my heart, I ignore it, instead melting beneath Harry’s touch.
They walk back to room 332 hand-in-hand, and Draco urges his steps to slow, despite his racing heart. When they reach the fishbowl, Draco leans forward to push the vial of Dreamless Sleep across the table, leaving it to rest in front of Odette. Her brow arches impressively as she glances back and forth between Draco and the abandoned vial.
“Depends,” Draco breathes, sinking his fingers into the muscle of Harry’s arms. “What did you get me for our fourth wedding anniversary?”
“Please, Harry,” Draco starts, careful, placating. “I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t think it was best for you. Please, Harry. I need you to drink this.” Draco brushes a curl from Harry’s forehead and threads his fingers through his hair. “There will be a day when we don’t have to do this. Soon. I promise. But right now, I need you to take this for me.”
When Draco enters Harry’s room, he almost smiles at the sight of its decorated walls and cluttered surfaces. After their first denial, Hermione suggested that if they can’t bring Harry home, they should bring home to Harry: mementos and photos, familiar clothing, and random trinkets to supplement the otherwise sterile environment. At first, the Healers weren’t happy about it, but Odette fought ferociously to let the little pieces of home remain in Harry’s room. So now, photos in varying stages of aging hang above Harry’s bed, near the door, on the bathroom mirror. A stack of worn flannel shirts sits on the table along with his favorite Canons’ pajama bottoms, and a snitch flits about the room, frustrated by the enclosed space.
Doused with shame, Draco shakes his head and runs his clammy hand through his disheveled hair. Ripping the thought out by its fragile roots, Draco takes one last deep breath and makes his final leap home.
Draco’s bright hair nearly glows in the moonlight, mussed from sleep. His left arm extends uncomfortably from underneath him, his long, bony fingers curling gently, as though groping for Harry, even as he sleeps.
“It was actually kind of cute,” Draco murmurs, burying his nose in Harry’s curls and inhaling his vanilla shampoo. “Next question: What memory do I use for a patronus?”
at the fire pit, igniting the pile of twigs, rotting logs, and brush that Draco gathered over the last week. Ginny does a silly dance when she successfully digs the marshmallows, graham crackers, and Cadbury chocolate from her bottomless bag. They all take turns trying to catch a marshmallow in their mouths, and Ginny scowls when Draco says her chaser’s aim is rusty after so many years in retirement.
Harry takes a sip of coffee and swishes the sweet, milky liquid in his mouth before swallowing. “I looked pretty sexy back then, don’t you think?” Harry asks, rotating the cup so Draco can see his image grimace at a camera flash. They both know Harry’s fishing for a compliment. Neither cares.
Ginny nudges Draco with a bare, freckled foot and smirks. “What are you waiting for? Go get your man.”
Draco stifles a yawn as he proceeds through the familiar routine of checking notes, straightening photos, and scrawling out his morning introduction to his husband. Though some days it’s still disheartening, he’s found a certain charm in getting to meet Harry all over again every day, in curating what photos and what memories Harry gets to witness first. He adjusts the sticking charm on the photo of them visiting Charlie at the dragon reservation and thinks that he could live with this. That if this is the best they get, it’s worth the battles that the last year has brought them.
Your blood is a violent river in your veins, agitated by the thundering constriction of your heart. Malfoy flashes you another toothy grin, showing off the harsh point of his incisors. It makes you dizzy, the thought of Malfoy’s hands traversing your body like an unexplored land. Those teeth grazing the flicker of your pulse, his tongue lapping at the salt of your skin.
The sun is long gone when Draco stands to dust the sand from his shorts, cognizant of time’s tug on Harry’s mind. Ron carries Rose in his arms, and Ginny supports Pansy with an arm around her waist as they all trudge towards the house, movements slow after the day spent baking in the sun. Hermione lingers behind, waiting as Draco waves everyone off and turns back towards the beach.
“No, you wanker,” Draco scowls playfully and nips at Harry’s bottom lip. “I was going to say, before you took that disgusting detour, that I knew it then, too,” Draco whispers against Harry’s cheek. “I loved you then, too.”
“It’s quite okay, Isla,” Draco says, forgiving her use of his proper title again. “Have you seen Healer Clemmons?”
As a youthful and tipsy Harry approaches Draco’s younger self, the details of the surrounding dive bar fade into a fuzzy smear of color. Vague, static-filled music hums in the background, but Harry, in his ripped blue jeans and muddy trainers, is crystal-clear. Draco, defensive and still too proud, half-heartedly fakes a sneer as Harry plops onto the barstool next to him. Harry’s laughter lines are missing, his hair isn’t yet speckled with gray, and his eyes are still painted with the darkness of those first years after the war.
The spine of a single feather, sleek and wet with blood, erupts from the thin skin draped over my collarbone. It mocks me in the bathroom mirror, unsightly and pale quills stained pink. My shoulders droop, and my spine rounds, a weary folding beneath the weight of an unsurprising development, as a crimson droplet runs smooth down my ribs.
With a hand cupped at the base of Draco’s skull, Harry pulls him in for one more kiss before letting him turn back to the wards.
Behind Draco, Harry sees himself in the mirror and watches the web that forms across his own chest and neck. He watches his skin unravel at the edges, the steady stream of shimmering gold pouring from the painful cracks in his flesh.
“Good to hear,” Draco says, eager to move on. “Well, Harry, I’m going to start with a few simple questions, if that’s okay? Can you tell me your name, please?” Draco crosses his leg, bouncing his foot to an inaudible beat.
“They’re not empty promises. He’s going to get better, and he’s going to come home. How has he done this week with the—”
Harry lies back onto his pillow and focuses on the rise and fall of Draco’s chest as he is gently lulled into a dreamless sleep.
“Only temporary, love. Don’t worry. We’ve gotten this far; we don’t want anyone following us,” Draco reassures him. “Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are going to pass you around like a baton before you make the final leap to La Trinité-sur-Mer with Pansy.”
The floorboards are icy when Draco sets his bare feet on the ground, careful not to rock the mattress, as he is every morning. There’s an autumn chill in the air, summoning an army of gooseflesh across his forearms as he tiptoes to the window, closing the latch. Harry snores from his spot on the bed, bare torso exposed and unbothered by the cold.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
“Hush you,” Pansy calls to Ginny before turning back to Draco. “It’s not a bad thing. I think it suits you, Draco.” She taps Draco’s knee with the toe of her heel. “The salty air has done you some good.”
charm rings, and a warm breeze ruffles the curtains at the open window. Draco looks at Harry, who lays in their bed beside him. Out of habit rather than necessity, he counts the steady rise and fall of Harry’s chest as Harry remains submerged in his dreams. Though Draco imagines reaching out to trace the bumps of Harry’s spine, the curve of his bony hip, he refrains. Harry would only turn over to find a stranger in his bed.
You feel a laugh bubble in your chest until you can't contain it anymore. You can't remember the last time you laughed, and really, the current situation doesn’t call for it. But you laugh. You laugh at the bloodstains that still cling to the crevices on the dashboard, you laugh at the raccoon, left for the maggots on the side of the road, and you laugh at how hot you feel when Malfoy runs his spit-slick tongue over a pointed, bloody tooth.
over the doorway. Draco watches in awe as Harry whispers the proper charms, disabling the last ward as though he’s unwrapping a piece of candy. Distracted, Draco lets his
“Woah, it’s okay that you’re here,” Harry says, reaching out to catch him and pressing him back against the wall.
A kiss. A grasp. A niffler after a watch. No—me after Harry’s touch (suffocated groan). Harry, tugging my hips. Heated skin. A curved back. Harry, pushing me backwards. A bony hip knocked against the table’s edge. No.
Draco lays down his knife and looks at the bowl of berries and batter, though he’s not really looking at the bowl at all. He tugs his lip between his teeth and furrows his brow in that way that means his mind is somewhere else, leaving his body and me behind in the kitchen.
“When I was young,” Draco says, gesturing wildly with the drink in his hand, “if you had told me that you and I would have not only one civil conversation, but would speak routinely and willingly, I would’ve hexed you.”
Harry laughs and raises his hands to proclaim his innocence. “I did nothing wrong! He’s just worn out, is all. Wouldn’t be surprised if he sleeps till morning.”
Draco rolls the vial between his fingers again, the warmth of its contents reassuring against his skin. “If I told you, I’d have to kill you.” His poor attempt at a joke falls flat, and Odette’s posture deflates like a crumpled soufflé.
“I’m happy,” he whispers into Draco’s skin, feeling the heat of his own breath warm his face. He feels a bit childish, like he doesn’t have the vocabulary to describe the strength of the tug at his chest, the way he can’t help but look at Draco and think of home.
Pulse galloping at the base of his neck, Draco clears his throat and removes his wand. “Harry, can you gather your things while I take care of the wards?”
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world.” Draco uses his wand to remove a single strand from the vial and drops it into the rippling pool. “Are you ready, dear heart?”
Odette stands to plant her feet in front of Draco, leaning over to place her hands firmly on his shoulders. “We’re going to figure this out. We’ll get him back. It’s just going to take some more time.”
of Apparition rings, then another. Neither of you break your rhythm as you summon a flash of muddied green, the relentless pounding of Malfoy’s cock in your arse, unhindered by the smell of burnt skin. Two dead Aurors lie on the side of the road as a scream rips through your throat and your cock pulses against the heated metal of the car. Malfoy’s fingers tighten in your hair, stinging your scalp and stilling your neck as he twitches deep inside you.
“Trick question, you bastard. You were a right git back then. Much more tolerable these days. Now can I touch you?”
Draco can’t help but giggle as he watches his own eyebrows disappear behind his overgrown fringe, shocked that Harry is touching him at all, let alone
Harry doesn’t relinquish his grip at Draco’s waist when he mimics Draco’s tone. “Sorry about what, babe?”
“Mother is dead,” Draco sighs from his spot against the wall, eyes fixed on the cluttered kitchen table.
“Doesn’t, I suppose.” Malfoy snorts. The center console creaks as he leans in, dropping your arm in your lap as he trails gentle fingers over the semi pressing painfully against the zipper of your jeans. “Hitchhiking in the middle of fucking nowhere, and you won’t do magic? You really are in trouble, aren’t you?”
Harry gasps before leaning his forehead on Draco’s shoulder and whispering, “When we went to see that awful band in Dublin, and I got food poisoning at the bar. You spent the whole next day rubbing my back, making me potions, holding the hair out of my face when I puked into the toilet. So romantic…” Harry chuckles. “I knew it then, months before I told you. But I knew it then.”
Harry seems to be the only corporeal occupant of the Great Hall. Whatever the cause, the other invitees float about the room, uninhibited by physical weight, chatting and laughing and dancing elegantly to an unclear source of music. The conglomeration of spirits casts an eerie radiance across the Hall, doubled by its reflection in the glass ceiling above. As Harry thinks of the glittering rain earlier in his bedroom, the droplets begin to fall once again. They spear straight through the pellucid party-goers, but coat the tables, chairs and floor in a glossy silver film.
Harry sighs, taking a slow and careful step forward to shut off the water, leaving a slow trickle to caress the smooth surface of my wings.
“It’s cold, Potter. Don’t leave your clothes lying around if you care so much about who wears them,” he’d snarked defensively. Harry could only chuckle, a bit bewildered by the curl of warmth in his stomach.
“Harry, you have to sleep.” He imprints the words into Harry’s cheeks. “We’ve been there, darling. We’ve tried... and it isn’t pretty. I need you to trust me and take this, please. Take it for me.”
A mixture of Valerian root and chamomile perfumes the air of the Janus Thickey Ward as Draco emerges from the stairwell after a draining shift on the potions poisoning unit. He wrinkles his nose at the herbal stench unique to the more cerebral potions used on this ward. The low-acuity side of the unit is largely unchanged from roughly twenty-four hours prior: Leon stares dully at a muggle chess board in the corner, Este and Beth sit cross-legged on the rug, gesturing wildly at their stories of grandeur, an aid vanishes untouched supper trays back to the kitchens.
over the room as Draco lets the charm slip from his lips. He waits in anticipation for a wave of pressure from a fallen ward that never comes.
As a result, they’re the only two left on the beach when Harry yawns from his spot at Draco’s side. Though his mind is tired, Harry’s fingers still fidget with a broken shell, rolling it between his knuckles. Draco gently removes the shell and interlaces their fingers, pulling Harry’s hand to his chest.
“You’re so gorgeous, Draco,” he murmurs behind my ear. “Look at you,” he whispers, softly gripping my neck beneath my jaw, forcing me to stare myself down in the mirror as his other hand dips beneath my waistband, palming my cock. “So fucking gorgeous.”
“My bright orange socks would do wonders for your complexion,” Harry teases. “Want a pair? I keep forgetting I have them, and apparently no one has the guts to tell me ‘no’ when I ask for another pair. The drawer’s full over there.”
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s. Every evening after work, Draco counts them. He notes the piece of gum that sticks to step seventeen and the chipped paint on steps three and twelve. Seeking an anchor, he runs his clammy palm over the cool metal railing. His footsteps echo in the narrow tower of concrete, and as he nears his destination, the sound slows like a thready pulse.
Draco observes his younger self, eyes drawn to bleeding fingernails, his prominent collarbones at the gap in his shirt, the dark smudge of purple under his eyes. Earlier that day, he’d been told his mother died, alone, in her cold and crumbling cell in Azkaban. That afternoon, his third residency application was rejected, and becoming a Healer was beginning to feel like an insurmountable task for someone with a Dark Mark. He and Harry had been on a break for a few months at this point, and Draco can still remember the relief he felt when Grimmauld’s wards permitted his entry. A single solace in a turbulent sea.
Draco flips on the wireless and starts in on the batter, pulling ingredients from the refrigerator while summoning others from the pantry. He flicks his wand at the coffee pot and dumps ingredients in a large bowl while the warm and comforting scent of the coffee fills the room.
Harry stands, still transfixed on the tangled mess of limbs and the growing pile of clothing on the floor. He reaches absently for Draco’s hand, interlacing their fingers before mumbling, “I had to ask you twice… You said ‘no’ the first time.” He turns, wide-eyed, to look at Draco. “Why did you say ‘no’ the first time?”
Healer Perkins vanishes Draco’s parchment with a flourish of her wrist as the members of the Ethics Committee rise to exit the board room. Draco meets each of their eyes with a look of pure distaste as they trail into the hallway, leaving Hermione and Draco alone.
Draco squeezes his eyes tight and feels a familiar stinging wetness threaten his lash line. As he fights the shudder that trails across his shoulders, he says, “I really don’t want to talk about it right now.”
“Ah, did you get a little extra something in your cup?” Harry laughs as he accepts Draco’s hand, joining him to clumsily spin about the kitchen. Hermione giggles, taking a sniff of Draco’s mug and waving a hand over her nose in jest.
Today, he wrinkles his brow at a muggle book about the microbiome, his reasons lost to Harry, and the early summer sun dusts a pale yellow light over Draco’s fine, gray hair. His thin wire glasses are perched on the bony bridge of his nose as he hunches over the book in his lap. Harry leans over the stair railing, admiring the way the light highlights Draco’s softened cheekbones, and thinks about the other ways Draco has softened over the years.
Harry is assaulted by images from a few days beforehand, when he and Malfoy sat in those exact seats. Harry had wandered down the hall to find Malfoy lounging along the couch, working on his Arithmancy and wearing one of Harry’s worn sweatshirts. He didn’t know how long he stood frozen still, gawking at the way his own sweatshirt pooled around Malfoy’s waist, the Slytherin’s exposed ankles above his woolen socks, the stray curls that fell from the knot of hair at the base of his neck.
The committee members skim through Draco’s petition far too quickly before they let the parchment rest in front of them. One member, a lanky and pointy gentleman with a bald spot on the side of his head, doesn’t bother to read past the title page. Draco throws a nervous glance to Hermione who stands to his right, spine stiff and hands linked behind her back. She’s an intimidating presence in her black Wizengamot robes and the sash worn only by senior members.
Draco hums, smiling as Rose smashes part of the castle with her plastic shovel. “I don’t know. I hope not, but…”
“I know you are. I know,” Harry says, shifting to press a kiss to Draco’s temple, trailing wet lips across his jaw until he covers Draco’s lips with his own. The taste of treacle tart lingers on his tongue.
Draco pats the hand on his left shoulder, dismissing the casual touch, and watches Odette sink back into her chair.
Harry scowls, the crease on his forehead darkening as it deepens. Draco resists the urge to reach out, to smooth it over with the pad of his thumb. Instead, he laces his fingers together, squeezing until his knuckles turn white.
“I thought we could multitask,” Harry says, teasing a finger at Draco’s waistband. He lifts the hem of Draco’s shirt, popping it over his head to reveal the patchwork of scars over Draco’s chest. They glint in the moonlight, the skin still shiny and smooth where it’s been made new. Though the scars used to make him cringe, now, they remind him of a pottery shop he and Harry found on a trip to Osaka. The shelves were lined with broken plates and bowls and vases, their imperfections made beautiful by sealing the cracks with gold.
Harry smiles at the memory of Draco gripping his hand in the tattoo parlor, knuckles white and jaw stiff, as the artist etched the pearly ink across one of his iridescent scars. “Making lemonade,” he’d gritted out, eyes determined but misty. “It’ll make the scales even shinier.” Harry had rubbed his thumb over the gallop of Draco’s pulse and watched a piece of their ugly past transform into something beautiful, something new.
memories of you and important moments in your life. Everyone is working so hard to help make this better for you.”
A curl falls in his eyes, damp from the humid air. His gaze is soft, aching, like he wants to wipe away the malicious glances, the tainted blood in the rotten chambers of my heart, the ink on my arm.
“Not at all, Draco. I’ll tell Ron; he’ll understand. Tell Harry we love him,” Hermione says with an encouraging smile.
Draco frowns at his nonchalance and releases a frustrated sigh. “Fair enough. So, knowing this, you won’t be too surprised to hear that I’ve been visiting you every day since you’ve been hospitalized.” Draco places his feet on the floor and shifts in his seat, tapping his heel against the leg of the chair.
“We’re going to bring him home,” she says firmly. “They can’t keep the Boy Who Lived locked away forever.”
By the time he reaches Draco, Harry is breathless and his heart races in anticipation of something his mind is yet unaware. He stands tall, the tip of Draco’s wand pressed harshly into his chest, and looks up to find fear in gray silicon eyes.
Countless stars fill the sky above the isolated countryside, as though it’s been speckled with paint. Under the endless sky, Draco shudders with the realization that he can’t go back, can’t turn around and undo what’s been done. An unwelcome seed of anger takes root for a fleeting moment. Whether Harry improves or, Merlin forbid, the curse tightens its grip, Draco is all Harry has left.
and for good reason. The rounded alcove, enclosed entirely in glass, sits between the lower and higher acuity rooms, providing easy visibility to the ambulatory patients on one side and the glowing vital signs and lab values on the other. Draco spots Odette, leaning back in a chair and eating a sandwich, while her eyes remain fixed on a high acuity room across the hall.
“Draco, you’re crying,” Harry says, reaching to wipe the tears from Draco’s cheeks. “Please, don’t cry. You don’t have to cry.”
Draco shoves his hands in the pockets of his Healers’ robes as he watches his younger self assess Harry with a wide-eyed expression of stunned horror. He takes a moment to observe the older Harry standing beside him, who stares at their former selves with a similar visage of disbelief.
The sleeve of Harry’s gown falls to expose his shoulder as he leans in to look at the younger version of Draco more closely, much like one watches a violent collision of quidditch players. Cringing at the sight, yet unable to look away.
“A while,” Draco mouths, but I can’t hear the words. The wind caresses his hair, the sun reflects off his iridescent sunglasses, and I think I can see the wilderness that stirs under his skin. He smiles and squeezes my thigh with his spare hand. “Does it matter?” he asks louder.
When their feet meet the firm and rocky ground near the cliffs of Dover, a salty and violent wind whips through Draco’s hair and ruffles his robes. Ron is just across the way, ambling down the road with his hands in his pockets and kicking a rock with the toe of his shoe.
“Don’t say sorry. We went back to my flat, and you drank a sobering potion, much needed by the way. What we did after was better than anything we could’ve done at the bar,” Draco drawls and wiggles his eyebrows in a way that he’s sure makes him look ridiculous. But Harry laughs, and Draco would do almost anything to hear that sound.
Harry allows himself to be led around the kitchen, muscles pliant and light. Draco nuzzles the curls of his hair, warm breath tickling the sensitive skin behind Harry’s ear. Harry hums contentedly and rests his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
When Draco shifts to settle over my chest, the wooden floor meets my shoulder blades with a painful pressure. The waistband of my pants digs into my hips, and my mouth tastes stale from sleep. But he looks at me like he might love me, and I think I love him, too. I tell him so, mutter it into his collarbone, and whisper it into the crook of his neck. Draco only hums into my hair and groans into my ear while he rocks against me, lazy and slow. I think I might have imagined the meaning behind his stare.
The yellow light in Grimmauld’s kitchen casts long shadows over Draco’s late-twenties features as he leans against the peeling wallpaper, chest heaving and hands clenched into fists. His uneven breaths sound like a stampede in the quiet of the otherwise empty house. A half-empty tumbler of firewhiskey sits on the cluttered kitchen table.
“It is,” Draco confirms, grazing the arch of Harry’s foot. “You also love my good sense of humor, my unmatched wit, and my devastatingly good looks.”
“Harry just needs some rest. Right, Harry?” Malfoy teases, pulling Harry from his reverie. Harry sways on his feet as he blinks away a bout of double vision. Malfoy reacts quickly, replacing his grip on Harry’s waist.
On Harry’s hundred-and-twentieth evening at St. Mungo’s, Draco’s routine is largely unchanged from any of the previous hundred-and-nineteen, with one single, glaring exception. Harry again manages to uncover some of his memories of his own volition, as though scraping dirt and moss from an old and crumbling headstone. Though he thought by now his eyes would’ve run dry, Draco still cries when he watches Harry fight the lure of a dreamless slumber until his eyelids are too heavy to lift. But, as Harry’s mind hangs in suspension between wakefulness and sleep, a whisper escapes his lips, hot against Draco’s ear: “I want to go home, Draco.”
“Can’t,” you mutter, letting your eyes flutter shut as Malfoy nuzzles his nose behind your ear. A pleasant tingle spreads over your neck, down your back, settling in your groin at the brush of his lips beneath where your sweat-soaked hair clings to your neck.
“Tempting offer…” Draco drawls, pinching Harry’s little toe through the thick knit. “Unfortunately, we can’t all pull off those tones… In practicality, I am a stereotypical Slytherin and still lean towards green. Although, I’d prefer if my uniforms were a bit less… putrid,” he laughs.
Draco reaches trembling fingers to cup Harry’s cheek, smoothing his thumb over Harry’s cheekbone before pulling him into a kiss. He clings to Harry like he needs him to breathe, like Harry, alone, sparks the electricity in each one of Draco’s heartbeats.
Blood thrashes in Draco’s ears, and his pulse gallops at the base of his neck, at his wrist. “What did you say?”
square of beach. We went every summer, and then some, when we needed to get away. We spent hours here, doing nothing but staring at the sea, watching the clouds float by. I’m surprised moss didn’t grow over your feet. It’s the most I’ve ever seen you sit still, the entire time I’ve known you.”
” Rising from his spot at the table, Draco resumes his languid swaying side to side, padding barefoot across the cool tile under the yellow glow of the kitchen light. The threadbare pajama bottoms he nicked from Harry’s drawer hang awkwardly above his bony ankles and his baggy shirt is unbuttoned to reveal the sharp angles of his collarbones.
“I think Este could use a little extra help getting ready for bed this evening. She looked a bit out of sorts at dinner, and I’m worried about her. It may take a while.”
“Let’s take that swim, yes?” Draco says, planting a kiss over the birthmark on Harry’s neck and returning to Harry’s lips. He takes careful steps backward, leading Harry into the ocean and not once parting to catch his breath.
Draco’s dreamt of this moment since the day Harry landed in St. Mungo’s, bleeding and unconscious. He dreamt of laughter and celebrations and a lightness in his chest that he hasn’t felt in months. In all of his dreams, he never came close to realizing the sense of relief this moment would bring, and he never imagined how quickly tears would overwhelm him.
I could blame my inability to pull away on the old, bitter liquor we’ve sipped on all night. I could say my mind is fuzzy from the heat. I could say a lot of things, but I’d mostly be lying.
Harry turns the mug in his hands and huffs at the moving picture of his younger self, plastered on the cup, smiling awkwardly and hair wild as ever. It’s one of four in a collection George and Ron released,
Draco levitates a bottle of Tullamore from the shelf, uncapping the lid and tipping the whiskey into Hermione’s steaming mug. She nods in thanks before reaching for a book and skimming the table of contents.
Draco sighs, and his shoulders cave in as he leans his forehead against the cool surface of the door. “They’re never going to let him out, are they?”
A metallic taste still lingers on your tongue as you fly down the parish road, windows open wide as Malfoy hums over the static. You didn’t bother with cleaning charms, both of you letting the sticky night air cake your spilled blood over sweaty skin. It glistens when the moonlight hits Malfoy’s face, its crimson brightness renewed with a wet swipe of his tongue over his lips, a sanguine promise that he wasn’t lying when he whispered about how good you taste.
“Sort of,” Harry mumbles, laying his hand over Draco’s and sinking his weight into Draco’s chest. “It’s beautiful.”
A step creaks under his feet as Harry lazes down the rest of the stairs, muffling a yawn and scratching an itch between his shoulder blades. Draco glances up at the sound and unashamedly smooths his gaze over Harry’s body beneath his barely-there pajamas. The cheeky glint in Draco’s eye fades to reluctant amusement when Harry sticks his tongue out for no reason at all.
“Want to stick around a while?” he asks, gently guiding you to rest your back against the car as he pulls your jeans up from around your thighs. You watch his deft hands graze your sensitive cock as he zips your flies, slips a finger into your waistband to fit the button into its slot. “I’ve got room.”
Though he usually walks to Grimmauld each night, Draco chooses to save time by apparating from St. Mungo’s front lobby. Without pausing to remove his robes, Draco drops to his knees in front of the floo, wincing at the crack his bones emit against the soot-covered brick. The smell of ash and dust fills his lungs as he croaks, “The Weasleys,” with more desperation than he ever thought he could muster.
“Almost perfect,” Harry says as he picks at a stray string on Draco’s shorts. The brush of his calloused fingers sends a shiver up Draco’s spine.
“You needed a break; we both did. It was a tough year…” Draco trails off, mind gently tugged towards Harry in St. Mungo’s, injured from a particularly nasty raid. Isolated in Harry’s hospital room, they spent more time together than they had in months. Consequences of their career choices reared their ugly heads while Harry worked long days and Draco started his specialty training on nights. Harry stepped down as Lead Field Auror that April, and Draco abandoned his pursuit of emergency medicine for more regular hours. They were both exhausted and discouraged, but ultimately decided time with people they loved was more important than any badge or title.
this morning. Nearly knocked Persephone off her feet. I let the residents cut his hair this afternoon. I’m sorry… I know you like to do it, Draco, but it doesn’t look that bad. Or at least, for him, it doesn’t look that bad.”
“Honey, you’d follow me to the ends of the earth if I asked you to.” Draco’s smile is confident, but not arrogant. I can’t help the roll of my eyes as he finds a way to recover from his uncharacteristic confession. “But you know what, Harry?” he asks, crowding me further against the counter.
Draco is uncertain how long he lays like this. Long enough to count the lines in the floorboards and the wrinkles in the duvet. His back aches, and his hip twinges when he finally peels himself from the floor. Though his hands tremble, he extends his wand, summoning Harry’s pillow and favorite quilt from the shelves. His steps are heavy as he retraces his path: replacing Harry’s toothbrush in the cup at the sink, laying his placemat at the table, and setting his trainers at the back door. Eyes stinging and tender from swelling, Draco grabs Harry’s rain jacket from the closet and slips it over his shoulders.
Every morning, Harry finds Draco in the tattered velvet chair at the front window of Grimmauld Place. On the day Draco moved in, he strode through the front door, boxes and bags levitating neatly behind him. One box, denoted as
“Gentlemen, I don’t want to interrupt, but we are in a bit of a hurry.” Draco strides towards the reunited friends and pats Ron on his shoulder. “Ready for the next jump?”
He’s not gentle when he pushes you against the door, meeting your lips in a violent crash. It makes your thoughts blur, not enough blood to spare for your brain as your cock thickens against his palm. He tastes like someone else when he plunges his tongue into your mouth, hot and insistent as he tears at your pants and splays an icy hand over your belly. Your soft belly, your soft arms, and your soft neck, flesh so easily torn by a swift, sharp bite.
The string weaves towards the lake, leading Harry to the base of the Whomping Willow. However, the tree is not so much a whomping willow, as a literal weeping willow, whose leaves cry tears of blue and green into the murky depths of the Black Lake.
“Healer Perkins, with all due respect, I wouldn’t have to speak on medical matters if your medical professionals utilized evidence-based practice,” Hermione seethes. “I cannot sit idly by while mounds of research go ignored and Harry suffers for it. I will be happy to consult on strictly legal matters when I feel the Ethics Committee is in full understanding of the body of evidence presented today.” Hermione raises her chin, but her hands tremble slightly behind her back, betraying her confidence.
The old dining chair creaks when Draco sits to lean over a thick stack of parchment. He removes his glasses from his breast pocket, and pulls a crisp, blank sheet from under a pile of books. With a deep breath, he looks at the top of the empty page and starts on his first draft:
Before the magic leaps from my fingertips, I catch Harry’s eye, and he shakes his head (just once, but his movement is soft; not the curt dismissal of a child but a tender denial, a loving warning, if such a thing exists. If it doesn’t, leave it to Harry to make it so.).
“I actually remembered our wedding day this afternoon. Best cake I’ve ever had... Hey, I didn’t mean it like that! Stop pinching me! You were beautiful, Draco; you always are.”
Satisfied, Draco hooks his chin over Harry’s shoulder and breathes him in, feels the heartbeat under his palm.
He asks like he doesn’t already know the answer, like I even have the ability to leave. The truth is, trying to leave would be like fighting a hurricane.
The memory fades in a wash of color like oil paint melting down a canvas, and they are temporarily pulled apart to emerge from the Pensieve. Harry is quick to close the gap, but pauses to hover his lips over Draco’s.
For all of his hurry to get here, Draco finds he’s run out of steam when he plops on the bench beside her.
The vacant house sighs in answer, creaking against the force of a strong gust of wind. Draco’s fingers grip for purchase against the closet door as he sinks to the floor, curling his legs to his chest and resting his head on the rug. A demanding pressure settles over his ribs, and a brushfire ignites every time he heaves a breath.
Malfoy ignores the gentle touch as he finishes up with Harry’s left shoe. He allows Harry’s hand to fall as he stands to tenderly help him out of his robes, his tie. Harry lets Malfoy wipe a drop of Pepper Up potion from the corner of his mouth and settles comfortably in bed, caressed by his warming charm.
The burn starts behind Draco’s eyes before the tears roll down his cheeks. His lower lip wavers as he leans forward to press a kiss to Harry’s forehead, to each eyelid, to Harry’s own wavering lips.
“As you can see on page two,” Draco starts, waving his wand to distribute copies of his revised petition to the members of the St. Mungo’s Ethics Committee, “it is a general consensus of muggle medical practitioners that familiar environments are beneficial for patients suffering from memory disorders like dementia and memory loss caused by traumatic brain injuries.”
Odette snorts and stops her spinning to look at Draco. “Sounds about right. Good luck, Draco; Pensieve’s all yours.”
into the air and feel the prickle of a cooling charm over your skin, but you resist, railing against the temptation as a crow lands on the busted side-view mirror, glossy black eyes looking a little too intelligent for comfort. With a stuttered exhale, you run your hand over the length of the wand, stiff beneath your bloodied jeans and pulsing with the anxious energy of magic that isn’t meant to be tethered. A defeated grin wins over your face as you finally toss a
“Got my first cucumber from the garden today. I was thinking of making tzatziki sauce and wraps for dinner?”
“Are you going to kiss me, or are you just going to stare at me like a frightened kneazle?” There’s an arrogant curl to his lip. I want to know what it tastes like.
son.” Draco grins proudly. Recognizing the futility in asserting otherwise, Harry simply pinches Draco’s ribs before pulling him by the hand to join Hermione at the table.
When they finally return to Harry’s room, Draco still crawls after him in bed and pulls him close, smelling his hair and rubbing his fingers across his back. The clock ticks behind him, and the room is quiet beneath the hum of the wards.
“Any day now. Can’t come soon enough, if you ask me,” she huffs as she plops into a seat at the kitchen table, interlacing her fingers atop her belly. “I’m actually jealous of Scorp’s sugar-induced coma. I haven’t slept like that in months, maybe even years. May just have to try it myself.”
though it’s not quite accurate, and it’s not a pack of wolves the Unspeakables awakened from the depths of the Ministry that day.
Nausea rips through Draco’s body, making him shudder as he makes his third leap from Mayenne to Hémonstoir. He plants his palms on his knees to empty his stomach into the field beneath his feet before straightening to wipe his mouth with the back of his hand.
the board recognizes the evidence presented today and finds Healer Malfoy has failed to provide any additional evidence from that provided at his last appeal. All citations presented today are in relation to muggle dementia and other memory disorders, none of which afflict Mr. Potter. You’ve provided nothing pertaining to memory disorders in relation to magical curses—”
Harry rolls his eyes, already irritated at the line of questions. There’s a cruel irony in the fact that he’s been asked them hundreds more times than he even realizes. Draco can’t help his grin when he spots the tell-tale crease between Harry’s eyebrows.
Every night, Draco answers the same questions, albeit they vary slightly from day to day. Every night, Draco prepares himself for what to expect, for how to answer, for how to approach each subject without scaring Harry or making him uncomfortable. And every night, Draco is thrown off his feet by the courage and the pure, unadulterated trust that Harry gives so freely. After learning that his memories have been stolen from him for months with little progress towards recovery, Harry’s first act, without fail, is to ask how Draco is holding up.
I lean forward and pick apart the fine, white-blond hairs above his ear like he’s a child and I’m looking for nits. “Oh, yeah, there it is,” I say, though I’m too focused on the feel of his hair between my fingers to really look. “Actually, there’s quite a few here. It was nice knowing you, I guess. Hope you like applesauce and mushy potatoes.”
it wasn’t. This much I know is true as I climb through one of Grimmauld’s busted windows and turn around, helping Harry do the same.
“Anything you want, dear heart,” Draco whispers into his ear and hopes it’s true as he directs Harry’s attention to the memory.
in the vase perched on the fence. They stumble when they land, but Harry straightens immediately. He offers an arm to Pansy, who, unsurprisingly, scoffs. Ron and Hermione abandon their spots along the fence and plod through the sand towards them with smiles and welcoming arms.
“Why do you keep making me do this?” The words slice through the air like a blade. “Why are you letting them do this to me?”
That’s all it takes to cast a blaze of fire through the swamp, sweet relief and irritated magic burning hot under your palms. Malfoy growls, digging harsh fingers into your hips as his teeth sink into your neck, releasing a slick spill of blood to drip down your chest, tickling the inside of your thigh. There’s a desperate groan amidst the filthy sound of sweaty flesh on flesh, but you’re too far gone to know whether the moan came from your own throat. In the dark, a
Outside, the summer air is thick with humidity, but the darkening sky lessens its weight. A chorus of crickets chirps from the field behind the house, lulling Draco into a strange sense of nostalgia. It’s disconcerting as it mixes with the panic he carried with him through the floo.
On easier days, I ignore that dizzy feeling that makes me sweat and rattles my thoughts whenever Draco’s around. But tonight, Draco’s in full form: unrestrained, unapologetic, and with an intensity that’s almost addictive. My heart knocks insistently against the inside of my ribs as I hover over him, unable to lean further in, but unable to pull away.
Salty air lazes on a gentle current through the window, and the gulls chatter on the rocks in the distance. Though it’s early morning, the mid-summer sun already hovers above the horizon, casting a golden shimmer over the gentle waves from the bay. Patches, their three-legged tabby cat, lazes in the warm rays on the windowsill and meows when she looks towards Draco. A not-so-subtle request for breakfast. Draco absently scratches behind her ears and leans against the window frame, letting the morning air fill his lungs and seep into his pores.
Draco catches his reflection in the glass behind her and watches himself pop a bright red bean into his mouth. His lips pucker at the spicy cinnamon flavor, but quickly fall into a frown. Even from this distance, his crow’s feet mock him in the glass. He swears the unsightly lines etched themselves into his skin over just the last couple of weeks.
“You looked so hot in that Slytherin quidditch kit. Those pants are so good for your arse. We should play quidditch when you bring me home.”
As we approach the kitchen, I instinctively hover my hand over a dusty and mildew-ridden vase, eager to fill the clouded glass with the light of a
After a week of restricted visitation, the Healers finally had a plan they believed was safe for Harry but still allowed Draco to continue their sessions with the Pensieve.
Harry lets out a frustrated groan and slips his thigh between Draco’s legs. The pressure is exquisite, but Draco keeps his composure as he waits for an answer.
“Draco, are you bleeding?” He moves to grip my shoulders but stops when he gets a closer look, hands held mid-air as though his puppeteer got bored, hung his strings on the hook, and took a smoke break. “Is that a—”
“Then it’s both,” Harry admits, leaning forward to capture Draco’s lips with his own. He tastes like the piece of apple pie that Draco brought from Molly that evening. Draco lets his tongue slip between Harry’s lips, chasing that syrupy-sweet taste but relishing more in the groan he draws from Harry’s throat.
“Oh, don’t look so sure of yourself. You’re coming with me. Come over here, I bet you’ve got some gray hairs, too,” Draco says. As though he heard my earlier thoughts, Draco reaches for my hair and tugs me back towards him. He chews on his lip and hums an unrecognizable tune under his breath as he conducts his assessment. I try to stay still while I focus on the careful movement of his fingers over each curl. After a minute, Draco scoffs. He wraps a lock of hair around his fingers, giving it a not-so-gentle tug before letting his hand fall to the ground.
They’d argued that morning, before Harry forgot who he was. It was a little too honest, maybe a bit cruel. They’d aimed their words at tender spots, hidden gaps in their armor that they’ve only revealed to each other. But if the day hadn’t ended with Harry bleeding in St. Mungo’s, Draco probably wouldn’t even remember sneering about Harry’s inability to stop and think before he makes a decision. He wouldn’t remember Harry refusing to indulge Draco’s self-deprecation. He wouldn’t remember wishing he could take it all back the second Harry left with a muttered, “I’m going to be late.” But he
Draco nods. “I’ll take every scrap I can get.” He sighs. “Any rumblings in the papers that I should be concerned about?”
Draco picked his favorite memories today, not just because he could. Because he needed to. And when he shuffled through that overstuffed cabinet of vials, he didn’t reach for the gestures of grandeur or the momentous occasions. Most days, really, he reaches for quiet moments, happenings of no consequence made precious, simply for the fact that he shared in the mundanity with Harry.
Out of habit, Draco checks the crumpled note Ron wrote all those weeks ago. Draco diligently sticks it to Harry’s glasses case every night:
“Sleep in the same bed, watch old movies on the telly, let the salty air cure our woes and heal our pain,” Draco sighs.
Draco lets Harry explore his mind freely, no longer worrying over what to show and what may be too sensitive to display. He follows Harry’s lead as he traipses through sneers at Hogwarts and pools of diluted blood clouded by the splash of running taps. They move almost chronologically as Harry pauses over Draco on the cold and dirty floor of his cell in Azkaban, the violent waves spraying cold droplets between the cracks in the walls. And then they’re dancing at Ron and Hermione’s wedding, and then their own, and then Pansy and Ginny’s ‘celebration of commitment,’ as they called it. He almost always finds warm summer days on the beach and sticky summer nights in bed. Attention captured, Harry lingers on limbs tangled in bedsheets, soft sounds, and bare skin, letting the memory proceed unhindered.
“Bring anything good tonight, Draco?” Odette asks, spinning in her swivel chair and knocking her clog-clad foot against the desk with each pass.
An irritating buzz sounds from the captured light above Draco’s head as he moves to stare at the rotting tart. He clenches his hands around the counter’s edge and inhales, letting the foul stench of decay fill his lungs. With a disgusted curl of his lip, Draco sends the plate hurtling towards the wall, flinching at the sound the porcelain makes as it shatters. His strides match the rapid pace of his breaths as he crosses the room to assess the damage.
“Never mind the war. But yes, love, we were odd birds back then. If you hadn’t called me by my name after you staggered over with that ridiculous hair and those gorgeous eyes… I just don’t know where we’d be. I’ll never forget that night.”
Confused, Harry scans the room for a clue and finds nothing. He is about to say so, but is hindered when Sir Nicholas says excitedly, “Oh, Charlotte! How are you, my dear?”
Draco attempts a smile, but is sure it’s more solemn than intended based on the look Hermione gives in response. In an instant, she wraps her arms over Draco’s shoulders, standing on her tiptoes to pat the space between his shoulder blades.
Harry leans into the pull and captures Draco’s lips in a slow and easy morning kiss, perfect despite their chapped lips and morning breath. Perfect, perhaps, because of them.
Though his sense of smell is lost, Harry imagines that Malfoy smells of his citrus shampoo, his strange cologne that says it smells like a library. Harry is certain it smells nothing like a library.
Draco stifles his frustration from the denied appeal as he and Harry proceed through their introductions as usual. Harry still turns Draco’s hand over in his own, examining their wedding bands and tracing the lines in his palm before looking to Draco with a wicked grin. Draco’s eyes still turn misty when Harry asks how he’s holding up, and Harry’s voice still carries the utmost conviction when he says things will get better.
“Oh, shit, Draco. Is it five-thirty, already?” Odette leans forward in her chair to peer at a clock around the corner, and her braids cascade over her shoulders with the motion. “Merlin, didn’t realize. How was your day?” she asks before taking another bite of her sandwich and crossing her legs.
Hospital gown fluttering in the wind, Harry ambles towards their former selves as they lounge beneath the mid-day sun. Draco moves to stand behind him and wrap his arms around Harry’s waist. He peels the gown from Harry’s right shoulder, pressing his lips over the odd birthmark dotting the crook of his neck.
“What’s wrong with you?” Older Harry asks, grimacing as the younger Draco begins to pick at a torn piece of wallpaper behind him. The shreds of faded florals pile at his feet.
Draco laughs and pulls back, grateful that Hermione understands when to leave a subject be. “How could I forget? You might not believe me, but I brought that memory once or twice for Harry.”
from me, Draco,” he growls, wiping angry tears from his cheeks. “Fuck, what if I never get my memories back?”
Despite the protective enchantments, Draco glances worriedly toward the door. The flicker of his gaze doesn’t go unnoticed. Silently, Harry removes his wand from his pocket and eases Draco aside, relegating him to maintain the
Unsteady and exhausted, Draco calls on the nauseating pull of apparition. It’s Harry’s grip on his waist that keeps him grounded when Isla and room 332 vanish in a smear of color around them.
Draco sinks his hands into the sand, focusing on molding the grains to fit his palms as he waits for the last of them to arrive. He counts the waves as they crash over his feet and listens to Ginny hum pleasantly beside him. Further down the beach, Ron and Hermione lean against the rotting fence and talk in hushed whispers.
“Merlin help you if I am disturbed at four in the morning,” Draco laments, dramatically resting the back of his spare hand on his forehead. “Ah, what was it from the movie we watched the other day? Oh, before sunrise, he’s
“I’d like to go back to that beach. Start a garden, get a cat, maybe? I don’t want all the bullshit when I get back home. I just want to… exist.”
“Harry,” Draco says, taking Harry’s hands in his. “This one isn’t as pretty. But it means so much to me. To us. I couldn’t bear not to bring this one today.”
A rush of air pouring through the floo jars Harry from his daydream. He adjusts his glasses just in time to see Hermione gracefully spill out of the fireplace. She straightens her coat and brushes a stray hair from her forehead before meeting Harry’s eyes with a gentle smile.
Malfoy wraps his arm around Harry’s waist, supporting him as the unlikely pair silently treks up to the common room. About halfway through their climb, the staircase shifts, overwhelming Harry’s already blurred sense of balance. He briefly considers letting himself tumble down the stairs, but clings pathetically to Malfoy’s bony shoulders instead.
