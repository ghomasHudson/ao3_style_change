“Potter unfortunately had one drink too many,” Malfoy said, genuinely sounding regretful. “And of course, being the caring individual that I am, I had to help him.”
Harry nodded and captured Draco’s lips in a hungry kiss.
True to his word, Malfoy knocked on Harry’s door at 9:55.
“Pretty weird question,” Harry mumbled to himself.
“Sorry,” he said again.
But then Potter became defensive. “Why? I’m sure you Slytherins don’t cozy up and spill all your feelings to each other, so why should we?”
Harry melted instantly, feeling light-headed as he watched Draco suck his finger, his eyes glued to Harry’s own. He could barely bite down a moan as he continued his exploration of Draco’s bare torso and sure enough, he found his way back to Draco’s left forearm. It was mesmerizing,
She frowned at him. “Well, if you change your mind, I’ll be here.”
His hands itched for it.
“My apologies, Potter,” Draco said as he shut the door closed, “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
He couldn’t let Harry see it, any of it. He’d turn and run the other way. Draco was certain of it.
This habit of sitting out by the lake before sunrise began his first month back. He had always been a light sleeper, but over the past few months, he found himself waking over the smallest noises. Usually, though, it was the nightmares that woke him.
“Before we begin, I’d like to ask how you’re feeling.”
“I’ll get used to it. I’ll be seeing more of you, I’m sure.”
Harry’s eyes snapped to him. Draco wondered if Harry had understood him.
Harry nodded and smiled. He was.
And here he was, returned at last. Draco never thought it’d be like this.
Draco opened his eyes and glared at Potter, who was crouched in front of him.
Malfoy nodded.
He didn’t think Harry was telling him the whole truth, but Harry went on before Draco could ask him to elaborate.
He quickly skimmed over what was written. It was essentially what Leonel had told him earlier – Healer Selina Lloyd had been walking home when she came across a figure sprawled on the sidewalk. She had then called Leonel over from St. Mungo’s. Together, they had brought him in. Not much was known about Potter’s condition just yet – just that he’d been unconscious when found.
“Over eight years ago. I haven’t seen him in person since my trial,” Draco frowned, lowering his voice as he spoke.
“You and I both, Healer Estrada,” Granger smiled.
; hands could only do so much.
They fell into a comfortable silence, but then Draco said, "On your back…"
"Mr. Potter? Are you alright?" he asked, closing the door and coming to stand by the bed. "I was alerted that your heart rate had increased to 112 beats per minute."
"I'm sorry," Harry said after a few moments of silence. "I just - I don't know how it got this far. None of this feels real. I've almost...forgotten..."
He was trying to think of a half-decent excuse to leave when there was a sharp knock at the door. Harry froze where he stood, envisioning Malfoy and Estrada traipsing in while Harry was mid-panic attack.
“Yeah, well,” Harry said, taking a sip. “Couldn’t sleep.”
“What are you thinking about?” Harry whispered.
Harry studied him with soft eyes, his green eyes looking darker in the dim lighting.
“I really like you too,” Draco replied when he got his breath back.
It was the end of the school week, and Draco was restless.
“We’ll stay, then.”
Draco’s mouth twitched. He moved closer, uncrossing his arms.
“Both types typically last about a week or so. You’re on…” Malfoy paused to check his notes, “day four.”
“It might’ve been, in the past,” Draco said, “But with our family outed as the slimy, Dark house that we are, I’ve had to find other means. Not to say we’re bankrupt, but I certainly can’t depend on lying on my arse anymore.”
“Great,” Harry said, crestfallen. He was sure he’d been in here longer than just four days.
“That’s good, Abigail,” Kathy said, nodding. “How has your sleep schedule been? I know it can be irregular at times.”
Harry caught up to them, his school robes billowing behind him. He was grinning too, and was alone.
“That’s not true,” Malfoy said sharply. “You’ve still made a lot of progress, and one relapse doesn’t erase all that.”
Draco tried to focus on Leonel, who was carefully copying each item onto his notepad.
“Yes.”
He grinned up at Draco, who gave a little smile and studied his plate.
Hermione began chastising Ron for treating Harry so roughly, and Harry took the opportunity to slip away, giving the feeble excuse of needing to use the loo. When he’d gotten to the hallway leading to the bathroom and his bedroom, he saw that Draco had followed him.
Harry grinned in victory. Draco smiled back at him and belatedly realized that he was already feeling the drink. Perks of not eating, he supposed.
“Have you two finally shagged, then?”
“No, I – couldn’t sleep,” said Draco, hoping his cheeks weren’t turning pink.
Potter’s gruff voice interrupted Draco’s swirling thoughts, making his neck heat up slightly.
It was afternoon when Draco saw Harry again.
Draco wrote Potter's answer down, his hand gripping his quill so tightly he wondered if he might break it in half.
,” Draco said slowly. He avoided Potter’s gaze as he spoke. “I just…had nightmares. Like you said, He lived in my house and it was far from the greatest year of my life.  Thus, the average war trauma.”
it?” Harry raised his eyebrows.
“I’m glad you had a good time, Draco. I’m also glad you didn’t just sulk in the corner the entire time,” her smile turned into a smirk, and Draco rolled his eyes. “Where were you, anyway? I lost track of you once I started talking to Patil.”
“You’re still a nosy bint is what happened,” Draco said, not even caring that he didn’t make sense.
ard to find any information.”
“But did he do something to upset you before you arrived?”
, he scoffed to himself. It was fine.
“I – of
“Good,” Cait said, apparently getting the answer she wanted. At their faces, she rolled her eyes and said, “God it’s obvious, the way you two are
“Only when I’m hungover,” answered Potter.
“It’s fine, Malfoy,” Potter said, though it didn’t seem to be fine at all by the way he was glaring at a spot over Draco’s shoulder.
“Yes, Healer,” she said, already starting to leave as she said it.
Malfoy cut her off by raising his shot glass, cheers-ing her own, and throwing it back. She followed suit easily.
"Hot date?"
His answer was so honest and ridiculous that she let out a laugh, "You're serious?"
She wasn't sure what possessed her to share it with Malfoy.
This year, instead of just standing there and staring at the spot where she'd dumped Riddle's body, she kicked off her heels and sat back against the stone wall instead. Impulsively, she impatiently pulled the bobby-pins that kept her hair in place and shook that much-too-tight-hairspray feeling out of her scalp with a long-deserved sigh of relief. Next year she would make sure she was on a long-term assignment out of the country.
"Oh, ones like who, then?" Harry smiled, her eyes twinkling, her lips raised in a tiny smirk.
Malfoy stared at her like she had three heads, "I would imagine for the same reason you are, Potter."
"I'm sorry, Hermione, I just had to...see it again. I didn't mean to worry you."
"You feel sorry for me? Like
“You know what they say—“
As she opened her mouth to thank her in return, Mrs. Malfoy gave the slightest shake of her head. One that Harriet understood to mean she shouldn't mention it. It was the least she could have done. Her eyes fell on Lucius, who gave a nod of his chin. He looked nothing like the haughty, regal man she remembered from Flourish and Blotts when he'd slipped Ginny the diary and started a chain of events none of them could have imagined.
"I didn't mean--I just meant here. Here here, like--" she gestured to the space around them and opened her mouth to speak again but found that she didn't have a follow-up.
He turned and opened his door, taking a few steps inside before swiveling to look at Potter, who was standing hesitantly just outside.
Hermione served them all cups of tea and sat down; Harry prepared himself, holding his breath.
Harry gawked; Draco looked indifferent.
“But are you?” Draco asked skeptically.
“That Gryffindor mindset of ‘if someone I trust trusts someone, then I automatically trust them too’ isn’t sound, Potter. I congratulate Granger and Weasley for not having it,” Draco paused. “Even if it means they’re not happy about this.”
Kreacher treated them to a large lunch around 2 pm, his little eyes observing them with something between fascination and revulsion. Harry watched him watch them from the corner of his eye for a minute before pointedly saying, “Thank you, Kreacher.”
Harry was starting to get a headache.
“I know, Hermione,” he said quietly.
Harry grinned and went in for a kiss. Draco kissed back gently, his palm smooth on Harry's cheek.
"Er, yeah," he said. "I guess I have."
Somehow, the group had gotten onto the topic of family. Harry would have liked to skip his turn but he imagined what Hermione would think if she knew he was being counterproductive.
Harry pulled on the hospital gown again with a scowl, feeling ridiculous. Madam Pomphrey never made him wear such foolish clothing, and he hadn’t made a trip to St. Mungo’s since his Auror days.
“You don’t have to defend yourself,” Draco said uncomfortably. He wished he didn’t bring it up.
“I can’t believe I almost called them Muggles. I wonder what they think I was going to say,” Harry said, turning again to stare at the door. “Fuck.”
“Couldn’t sleep,” he said.
He couldn't watch anymore.
“Are you ok getting home?” Malfoy asked, surprising Harry with his thoughtfulness (or maybe Harry was just thoughtless).
“I’m sorry.”
Harry and Malfoy exchanged glances. Cait was obviously thinking about the row they had in the middle of group.
“Oh,” Potter said, blinking at him.
“And you’re drinking coffee right now?”
“Huh. I guess they are,” said Potter, his breath wafting into Draco’s face and smelling very strongly of the Muggle drink that burned just as much as firewhiskey did.
“What happened?” Draco asked, trying his very best to keep his voice even. He was working – this was his job; he fixed the people who came in regardless of who they were.
Harry blushed and grinned. “You’ve made me very happy as well. Thinking about the conspiring quartet; how much longer do you want to drag out their suspense? I was thinking we time you bringing in whatever they get you so at least one of them sees the two of us talking, maybe even one of them hears you asking me back here after I finish work. I don’t want to keep us a secret from everyone for more than another year or so.”
“Yes, that’s what I said. Coins or vault, Mr Malfoy?”
And then
How much I cried
“Well, you take it back, then, and just give it to me unwrapped if you must.”
“You should act like you’re surprised to see me there. We don’t want to make them suspicious, after all.”
“What’s in it for me Malfoy?”
“You know, what would really get them panicked is if you kept the tie. I mean, as far as they know, you never returned the Troll’s leg. And Teddy would love that tie. I’m sure you would become one of his favourite people if you wore it around him. Andy talks to Molly enough that I’m sure it would get back to Ron eventually, and then he’s sure to tell the rest of that quartet about it.”
Eventually, the door opened and the pair returned to the room. They walked in and Draco could hear them talking about the difference between two words when said in parseltongue and how some words didn't have a direct translation, touching on how this could affect casting spells using parseltongue. He was surprised, he knew it took a lot of effort to get his father interested in Magical Theory. It wasn't that he didn't know about many obscure parts of it, he was just more interested in other things and didn't often talk about it.
Unrolling the parchment he saw what caused his parents so much shock. The first line on the scroll said, in larger writing than he might have expected, 'Writ of Pardon for one Lucius Abraxus Malfoy'. He almost dropped the scroll himself but he kept reading. Draco saw it was an official ministry document releasing his father from the conditions placed upon him concerning the terms of his house arrest. From the first minute of the new year his father would be a free man. Lucius could then leave the manor and it's grounds, but more importantly, his wand would be returned without any restrictions on it. Though there was a warning at the end of the document that due to his history he would be judged harshly if caught breaking the law again.
We almost broke
Draco rolled his eyes and smiled at his lover. “Sorry! Now let’s open the ‘gift’ I received from Blaise, and then we can plan how I’m going to return this tomorrow.”
“Yes! Of course, I’ll marry you, Harry.” Draco felt tears in his eyes as he pulled his fiance into his arms. “Do you think you could get the Twins help to include something in their wedding invitations?”
“Four years?” Draco almost shouted.
Remember how we used to fight through school
The quiet was interrupted by Mrs Weasley who was up to make breakfast for everyone before most returned to their own homes. Harry immediately stood and offered to help her with the cooking. He watched the pair work together almost seamlessly in the kitchen dancing around each other in the space to make enough food to feed all fourteen people. He enjoyed watching his partner move about the room and cook with skill and confidence, though it made him sad to think of how and why Harry knew how to do these things.
“I still had some left from last year and your’s was the first gift I wrapped.” Blaise gave him a smirk..
It had a silver rim and base, and appeared to be a dish of some sort. Looking back at the box, he saw two pieces of parchment sat in the bottom. One was the customary receipt he was coming to expect from Blaise’s gifts and the other was written in the standard Wheezes font. ‘The Always Ready Floating Ashtray’ the leaflet proudly proclaimed. Draco removed the receipt and carefully coaxed the tray back into its box before promptly putting the lid back on and tying a ribbon aboud it to keep it closed.
The next morning the pair were up early getting ready to Floo to Malfoy Manor, and spend Christmas morning with Draco’s parents. He was worried by how unworried Harry seemed. Once they had gathered the gifts they were taking with them, both for his parents and for the Weasleys, they quickly went through the Floo and arrived in the reception parlour of the manor. They were met by a house-elf and directed to the family dining room. At one end of the dining table there was a small pile of parcels, as they passed Harry and Draco added their presents for the elder Malfoy’s to the pile. He joined his mother at the table and Harry sat opposite him.
Draco gave what he hoped was a charming smile, “Well then, Mr Potter, I shall see you at six.”
“Well, after last night, I’m happy to let you rub all over me.”
We were so young back then
How excited we were
“Good morning my Dragon, our Yule was promising. Your father is well he had just gone out to check on the Abraxans when you arrived, he should be coming back to the house in a few minutes.” she turned towards Harry, “I hope you are well, Mr Potter.”
He kept hold of the tie and wore it each time he visited his cousin Teddy. The three year old enjoyed attempting to match the colour of his hair to the colour of the tie.
“I happened to take some particularly excellent wine from the family cellars last time I was at the mansion. I’m sure you would welcome it after having to spend so much time in this mess of a store. We can catch up and maybe you will discover you enjoy my company after all.”
“I was the one to inherit the majority of the Black Vaults. Sirius had ritually adopted me, which meant I was the next in the main line. One of the smaller vaults has actually passed to my godson through his mother. When I was trying to figure out what to give you I started to sort through the main family vaults, the set wasn’t labelled as yours or as being meant for you at all, which is quite possibly how it failed to become part of your dowry. When I saw what was in the box, I immediately thought of you, and I felt that they should be in the hands of someone who truly cared about them. Honestly, there are enough other pieces of jewellery in the Black Vaults and the Potter Vaults that I would not miss one set, especially one that looked personalised if I ever had a daughter.” he paused, “Mr Malfoy, I should possibly warn you that your gift is not entirely from myself, and in some ways is similar to your own gift to Draco. If you want, I can explain how I can give you what I am now or at another time if it would suit you better. I feel I should say it did not take as much work as I expected it to, and it is on record that I am giving this to you today.”
Draco made his way over to the longue and greeted Betty and Leonel, who were chatting and snacking. They looked up as they entered, Betty subconsciously straightening her back.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes at the touch.
Draco looked at Harry, who was chewing his bottom lip just a touch too aggressively. But he was quiet and thinking over Draco’s words instead of immediately refuting them, which was progress.
What should he do? It definitely
“Fine.”
That was all Draco could think about as he made his way to the Slytherin table, and Pansy and Blaise knew it. The way they looked at him - Pansy knowingly and Blaise approvingly – as he walked up let him know immediately that they knew he had spent the night at Harry’s. He sat down, trying not to show how uncomfortable he was, and began putting food on his plate.
? Just being inside Harry was enough to start satisfying his cock.
“Yeah, I suppose he is.”
“Fine,” Potter echoed back at him. He dug his hands further in his pockets. “Right. Well, see you later, Malfoy.”
“Where was I?”
As the two continued their drunken argument, Ira leaned over to speak lowly in Draco’s ear.
Harry almost spit out his drink.
Draco woke up from a deep sleep in Leo's bed. He smiled sleepily as he remembered the events of last night. They’d shagged on the couch before moving over to Leo’s bedroom lest his flatmate come back early. There, Draco rode Leo until they’d both finished again and fell into a deep sleep.
Harry nodded, worrying his bottom lip.
. This is how he knew he’d actually and unequivocally gone mental.
Granger’s eyebrows were raised, but she said nothing of it.
Perhaps it did sound worse when spoken aloud, but Harry still thought it was extreme to say he had an addiction.
“Let me fuck you.”
"This is...the Black house."
food in the house?” asked Ginny warily, already knowing the answer.
“Alright, I won’t,” Draco said. “It’ll be up to you, then. I know Estrada well, and I know he’d be receptive to the idea.”
“Yeah I know,” said Potter, unbothered. “We’re not going there.”
And then they were both smiling at each other, and Harry was so overtaken by the urge to lean over the table and kiss Draco that he had to grip the edges of his seat.
“I'm, er...well. I've got to tell you something.”
"Cocaine?" Hermione echoed, slightly horrified.
“I reckon I’m going to head back now,” Harry said. “I need to…process.”
“I fell yesterday,” Harry said. “I wasn’t watching where I was going and I tripped up the stairs to my house. It felt like – like the pathetic end to a pathetic day. I dunno. But, er, anyway, I got inside and I checked to see the damage to my knee, to see if I got cut or anything. I didn’t, and…I was actually disappointed.” He tried to laugh, but what came out of his mouth sounded forced and wrong. “I was disappointed to see that I wasn’t bleeding.”
“So, how’d you two meet?” she asked innocently.
When Draco arrived at his office, he left immediately for Ira’s.
about to cry. He clenched his jaw, angry at himself.
The smile Harry shot him was more effective than any warming charm Draco had ever cast.
At one point, he got the nerve to look back up at Potter and wasn’t too surprised that they’d locked eyes almost immediately.
Draco felt even guiltier at the thought – conspiring to get his boyfriend drunk just so he could talk to him? That couldn’t be the sign of a healthy relationship, could it?
“So what did you want to tell me?” Draco asked after the two stared at each other for a moment.
"Draco."
"'S not a mess."
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Really?”
They sat down to eat fifteen minutes later, the fresh omelets steaming and smelling lovely.
“Thanks, Harry,” she said, ignoring his discomfort. “What about you, Sam? Have you had a good week?”
"She misses you, you know. Mum," Ron said quietly. He wasn't meeting Harry's eyes. "They all do, back home."
Draco raised his eyebrows at Weasley, who gave a slight shrug.
Afterwards, Draco and Harry decided to go to Hogsmeade. With it being Christmas holiday, there really wasn’t much to do and they figured they might as well venture out there with their unlimited time.
"It makes sense that you've formed an attachment to him."
On Wednesday, Harry apologized to Samuel for not being able to say goodbye properly.
“Yes. He Owled me on Tuesday and we made plans to have dinner together in,” Draco checked his watch, “Twenty-four minutes.”
“I – nothing? I, er, guess I thought she was your girlfriend if Parkinson wasn’t. Look, I’m just – “
After Draco and Harry had opened their respective presents (and given each other apologies for not getting anything for the other), they went down to breakfast in the Great Hall. It seemed like they weren’t the only ones who rose early today; they were nearly the last ones there.
Concentrating all his willpower, he pointed his wand to the especially bad patch of redness and murmured the one incantation he knew. His skin shimmered and blurred, obscuring the burst blood vessels until they weren't so shockingly visible. He repeated these steps until he looked halfway like a person again. He still looked dreadful, though, thought Draco as he ran a hand down his own cheek experimentally.
On Saturday morning, Harry was woken by Ron’s owl pecking his head.
“What do you think? And
Draco's breath caught in his throat. He felt himself flush and swallowed thickly, bringing his hand up to take hold of Leo’s own.
“Oh no, Draco,” said Astoria, aghast. “Not him. He’s got a few screws loose, that one.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Some of the mess is Ron’s too.”
"Malfoy?"
“Healer Malfoy,” Betty began in a high voice, “Did you just say you fancy Harry?”
Harry’s face heated at the memory of that night.
"Literally when have I ever-"
She hadn't cried yet, but her voice sounded unusually thick. She blinked and looked away.
"After all that oversharing yesterday, all you have to say to me is hey?" he asked lowly.
Harry looked a bit stung by this, and Draco immediately regretted his words. “If I overstepped –“
He became lightheaded suddenly, his body protesting against, well, everything. Draco swayed where he stood, and Potter’s tough façade fell immediately.
“It’s alright, Potter. Really. Just forget it.”
“I’m – I,” he gasped. “I’m sorry. Please…”
God, but it was weird thinking about the four of them drinking amicably and being on first-name basis with each other. Was it really that easy moving on?
Harry had opened his eyes and was watching Draco, something like amusement on his face.
Harry studied her long, dark hair, her pale skin, and her cheekbones. He could see it now.
? He was meant to marry Ginevra and have a whole clan of little red-headed monsters, not…”
to Malfoy,” Harry said, carefully emphasizing the most important word, glancing over at Ginny to see if she was convinced.
Draco dropped the paper into the toilet and flushed, watching the partly digested food swirl out of sight.
Draco immediately saw that Pansy was waiting for him at their usual table. She was finally detached from Daphne, thank Salazar, and Blaise was still most likely with the Weaslette. He noticed Weasley and Granger sitting at the opposite side of the room, worried expressions on their faces. He tore his gaze away from them.
The bartender served up his five pints; Harry took three and Draco got the other two. Together they walked over to the back table Samuel, Damien, and Cait had gotten for them. Draco and Harry sat down next to each other, the others scooching to make room around the table.
“I reckon I have been…”
Harry took Draco's face in his hands, making him look him in the eyes, feeling Draco’s sticky tears trickle through his own fingers. Draco looked like he'd seen a ghost and Harry wanted to undo it.
The water was boiling. Ron and Harry got four cups from the cabinet and set them down on the table. They automatically got their favorite teas and Harry turned to Draco, whose face was serious.
He lifted his shirt and examined his body at all angles. He ran his free hand down his stomach, cursing himself for eating too much at dinner. He felt like there was still more food that he could get out, but it was pointless now. He’d waited much too long, and he didn’t fancy going down to Myrtle’s loo all over again anyway.
“And you, me,” Draco murmured, his eyes positively lingering on Harry’s lips.
"Ruminating on it," Draco responded, looking him square in the eye, his face bland. "Using unhealthy coping methods as a pretense for moving on when you haven't gotten to the source."
Harry blinked, remembered where he was, and groaned. He was fucking dreaming about drugs now, and if that wasn't a sign of how pathetic he'd become, he didn't know what was. It had seemed so real and the want was overwhelming for Harry, manifesting in his chest and teasing him with something he couldn't have, something he so desperately wanted.
and countless other news sources from writing about him, of course. Articles were still being published – filled with speculation more than anything else – wondering where he was, what he was doing, and would he be returning to the Wizarding world anytime soon?
“Do you want it to happen again?”
Harry could hardly believe this arrogant prat was telling him all of this so matter-of-factly, telling him that he had an addiction. The absurdity of it all caught up with Harry’s irritation and the words he’d been holding back burst out.
Harry was dizzy with ecstasy, his eyes fluttering closed as Draco continued to suck his cock like it was what he was made to do. He made little noises as he did it too, as if he couldn’t get enough of it, which was unlikely but it made Harry go wild all the same.
“I see,” said Wolff. “You still hold this opinion?”
“Healer Estrada will be back in the evening to check on you once more.”
“There’s never been a shouting match here. Sure, some disagreements, some uncomfortable debates, but nothing like
“Er, yeah.” Harry seemed to welcome it as he pulled out some books and a quill. He fiddled with it, a slight frown on his face. “I didn’t know how welcome I’d be…I’d just make it awkward, I think.”
"Oh? What else was there?"
“What is it? Were they being rude to you? Merlin, I thought we’d all grown up.” Her voice was harder than it had been in a while.
“So it’s true?” Harry blurted out.
“Oh, good, I’m glad to hear it,” said Harry.
“Shove off,” Draco grumbled with no real menace in his tone. “I was fourteen.”
Harry quickly downed his pint and set it down with a
“There is much more Muggle data on withdrawal and addiction, so it may be shorter than a week,” Malfoy said, though he didn’t sound entirely confident. “The most important thing is that your symptoms are managed. I’ve said before that they may be life-threatening, and that’s certainly true, especially considering how long you’ve been dependent on these drugs. But with magic, they’re contained and reduced in ways that Muggle science cannot achieve. In fact, –”
Draco silently rejoiced despite the betrayed look on Harry’s face and said, “So you decide, Potter. If you’d really risk our friendship by doing something foolish.”
Harry wobbled a bit in his chair; Malfoy raised his eyebrows.
He knew the answer before Malfoy even asked – he grimaced apologetically at them and hoped they would understand.
He then did something Harry wasn’t expecting; he stood up, his chair screeching against the floor as he did so, and walked away.
“As you said,” Draco said, but Harry spotted a smile on his face.
The guilt was short-lived and lessened as time went on; they sat and ate in silence as they watched two more hours of reruns. It
Draco scoffed. “Most people would disagree.”
“Come,” Draco told him hoarsely.
There was a pink glow high on Draco’s cheekbones, and Harry felt his own face burn with embarrassment and pleasure.
“It’s fucked,” Draco said again.
“You love it,” Harry said, undeterred by Draco’s bored drawl. “Admit it.”
“Leave me alone, Potter,” Draco muttered.
“Good,” Draco said, actually relieved. “We’d have to stop being friends if you could.”
“Oh, come on, what were you gonna say?”
Malfoy kept going as if Harry hadn’t spoken.
Harry let out a small laugh. “Yes, I’m sure. It’s cos I trust you…and you understand. On some level, you understand.”
Draco shook his head, fear gripping his chest. “I – bits and pieces. I was drunk.”
“I’m sorry, what?”
Merlin, he was infuriating.
“I just hope you know that I’m going to be decorating the place,” Draco started to say as he drew closer to Harry.
Harry was staring at him again, which made Draco think that he definitely didn’t look alright.
“Why not?”
"I'm not doing it to make fun of her, you dolt," Draco said, his voice now back to his own. "I'm doing it so you'll open up or whatever."
“Sorry,” Potter frowned, knowing he had been both.
“Blaise has thought Ginevra was fit ever since Hogwarts,” Draco revealed to Potter, who remained unphased. “Give them a chance. Next time Blaise is in town, you should try to spend time with the two of them.”
How did he get here? Was it when he was sixteen and fearfully accepted the Dark Mark? When he failed to kill Dumbledore? When he was seventeen and refused to identify Harry in the Manor? When he pleaded with another Death Eater, telling them that he was on their side? Or did it go back further than that, when he was six and starting to absorb his family’s twisted ideals? When he was eleven and cementing his reputation as a Muggle-hater? Or was he just destined for all this as soon as he was born?
Draco looked at Betty critically, and she blushed.
“You,” she growled. “Of course they’re yours. But then why did Ron find–“ Understanding dawned on her face immediately; she wasn’t top of their class for nothing. She gasped and turned back to Harry. “Did you and Malfoy - Harry?”
to be friends, Potter,” he said, attempting to keep the ice out of his tone.
In fact, it almost seemed like Pansy was drawing away from him. She still forced Draco into the Great Hall whenever she could, having him sit down next to her and put
“And why is that?”
? What was
he shrugged. She made a
“I’m fine,” Potter said a touch impatiently. “I don’t want to talk about that right now. I need – I need a distraction.”
And then Harry and Malfoy were left alone once again. Luckily, this time, they were pissed. Well, Harry was, anyway. But Malfoy had to be too, right? He looked happy for once (sorry, that was a shite thing to say). Harry soon realized that he was thinking too much, and Malfoy’s gaze was wandering to the other side of the bar.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s head swam. He needed more whisky. That would help him make sense of this.
can’t help you anymore, remember? He’s rotting in Azkaban, just like he deserves.”
“And just how drunk are you?” asked Draco as he straightened out his black jumper.
Ginevra faltered. Not so confident in him staying now, was she? Draco said nothing and waited.
She, too, looked at the clock and sighed.
“What are you doing here, Leo?” Draco sighed, finally looking him in the eye.
Potter had leaned back against the booth again, regarding Draco with cautious eyes. His arms were crossed and his mouth was set in a frown, but his voice had no real vehemence in it. Draco pushed forward.
The dimly lit hallways made it difficult for Draco to see the other man, and he briefly wondered if it was just his sleep-deprived brain playing a cruel trick on him. He stowed the wand away in his robes, utterly dumbfounded. He then took a hesitant step forward.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but his brain wasn’t cooperating with him and he clamped it shut. He hated the way Potter was looking at him; he felt so vulnerable it terrified him, feeling like his every secret was at risk of being divulged. Draco glanced away and was met with the sight of the toilet he’d just finished puking into. He grimaced and looked down at his lap, but that didn’t help either. At some point, he must’ve rolled up his sleeves, and now the Dark Mark was staring up at him, faded and red but still very much there.
Draco woke up hugely disoriented the next morning. He vaguely remembered doing paperwork, going to lounge,
already – there was no need for divination. But did he actually like Leonel enough to start a relationship again? Or would they just shag and go back to normal? Was he using Leonel to forget about Potter? Because Draco
Harry’s expression darkened instantly. “Nothing will. I’m doing good, and I have been for a while now. You wouldn’t know, of course, but it’s true. Now stop being melodramatic and just fucking say yes, Draco. I know you want to.”
God, he needed something, anything to help him not feel this way. So utterly useless, hopeless, pathetic, and fucking miserable.
Draco laughed lightly, picking his glass up to take a sip.
“Astoria? What’s she have to do with this?”
“Oi, Malfoy.”
“You think I wouldn’t if I could?” Draco grumbled.
"Ok."
He waited.
“I’m sure it’s fine.”
, supplied an unhelpful voice in Harry’s head.
Draco made a low noise. “I’m sure you’ll help me, tough.”
Draco flushed all over again. “That’s very…kind of you, Potter.”
Harry shook his head with a laugh.
“I – what?” Draco stammered, completely caught off guard. “Why?”
Draco blinked down at him. Potter’s childhood was still shrouded in speculation and myth – he never talked about the Muggles he lived with. But everyone knew about Potter and co.’s great camping trip. It was hard for Draco to picture, even if he
“Not at all, go ahead, Potter.”
"Yeah," Potter said confidently. "Even if you did want to kill me, I don’t think you could."
Potter raised his cup. He looked tired.
“Please. Just let me go.”
His blue eyes were wide as he watched for Harry’s reaction which was: shocked happiness.
There was a slight pause. “Why are you telling me all this?”
Harry nodded.
“Wait, er, Malfoy.”
"That's something you'll never convince me of.”
Harry gave a little laugh at the memory, feeling a twinge of pain at the thought of Fred.
“They’re just scars. Old wounds, marks…we both have our fair share of those, wouldn’t you say?”
“Oh, no, that’s fine,” Harry assured uncomfortably. “I don’t plan on being here for much longer anyway so I wouldn’t want to cause trouble. Thanks, Healer Mitchell.”
“What is with you lot and chopping off body parts? It was Malfoy, by the way,” Harry added uncertainly.
“Shush it, you,” Cait said, thwacking Damien’s arm lightly, though she didn’t seem upset about it – the opposite, in fact. She turned back to Harry. “S’all right. No judgement here. I wanna kill myself too sometimes. Have too much coke sometimes. Mentally unstable at all times.”
“Oh,” Harry said. He hadn’t even thought of that. “Yeah, I s’pose that would work. Do you know where it is?”
“Just expect the mean one when I’m fucking you then,” Draco said, apparently amused by Harry’s predicament.
He stood up shakily, grabbed his wand, and thought about the address of a residence he hadn’t been to in a good while. Harry spun into darkness and reemerged on a Muggle street, which was thankfully empty. He stowed his wand, distractedly chastising himself for being so careless, and hurried over to a small, familiar house.
“Time isn’t real, nothing matters, etcetera,” Ira waved their hands. “Come on, Leonel, Draco. Live a little. It’s been ages since we’ve gone out together, and Betty’s never been.”
“You don’t mind me barging in here every day, do you? I can stop.”
“Of course,” he said. “My office is just down the corridor. Follow me.”
Even Pansy hadn’t gotten him to say this much. He took a ragged breath and wondered why he was even telling Potter all this. Maybe it was because all Pansy did was yell at him and demand that he stop. But Potter’s voice was calm and non-judgmental, everything Pansy’s wasn’t.
“It was Potter’s idea. He wants us to get along.”
“Are you leaving already?” Draco asked as he sat down in his chair.
“Explain then.” Draco brought the cigarette to his lips and waited.
As if on cue, Betty walked into the room, followed by a slightly frantic Granger and Weasley. Betty stepped aside as the couple approached Potter’s bedside. The worry was obvious in their faces, and Draco felt another twist in his stomach. He’d seen them quite a bit in recent times, especially since Blaise and Ginevra had started dating.
Blaise began to deny it, but Draco stopped him short, placing a hand on Blaise’s arm.
Draco didn’t remember the last time he had allowed himself to cry so openly – it must’ve been ages ago considering just how strongly he was currently weeping. He screwed his eyes shut and burrowed his face in Potter’s shoulder, too overcome by sadness to think too carefully about what he was doing.
stop staring, and that was something. Potter began eating again, and Draco sighed down at his soup. It wasn’t that bad, he supposed, and now that he’d
“I wasn’t-“
and bent over the bowl. He exhaled shakily and brought his hand up to his mouth for what felt like the thousandth time.
“Blimey!” he said, then peered over Harry’s shoulder. “I just came out here cos I heard a car backfiring or something, but – wow! Come in, come in. It’s been ages.”
“Well, I don’t deserve it,” Harry said, slipping down a bit in his seat.
“I’m glad to see you’re awake, Potter.”
They actually turned out to be rather interesting; he spent an entire day going through them and finding even more on his own. Still, even as he scrolled through countless lists and taken several questionnaires, he wasn’t convinced he was mentally ill. He might’ve just been overreacting or reflecting what he read or something.
Draco took one last pull before throwing it away. He was breathing hard; he had never voiced these particular thoughts to this extent before.
“Cos I didn’t, right?”
“Right,” Potter said, glancing nervously into the Room. “Er, thanks, Malfoy. For talking with me about this.”
“So…he’s more upset that we can’t have children instead of us both being blokes?”
He was telling Astoria of Pansy’s withdrawal from him as they walked the frosted lawn, gloved hands in pockets and scarves whirling in the wind. He’d just cast a warming charm on the both of them a few minutes ago, but he was already freezing again.
Harry shook his head.
Ten minutes later, there was a sharp knock at the door. Draco had barely said ‘come in’ before it flung open and Granger and Weasley rushed in.
“Malfoy.”
“Now I know you’re making this up.”
“I guess I don’t have much of a choice, then,” Draco said.
“How are his vitals?” Draco asked, his professionalism finally taking over.
Of course, once the adrenaline wore off, Draco was just left with shaky knees, an acidic taste and smell in his mouth and nose, and a stinging, angry throat. His head pounded as he sat on the floor of his bedroom, thinking of what he’d done.
“I don’t know who was worse, really, between him and my uncle and my aunt. They all hated me, they all wanted me gone. They just had different ways of showing it.” Harry rubbed absently at his neck. “I don’t live with them anymore, thank Merlin, but I can’t let it go. I mean, I know what they did was wrong, but sometimes…I just keep remembering everything they said and did and I…I believe it. I believe that I’m a waste of space or I’m useless or a burden or whatever else they told me I was.”
“So, er, what else has the
Draco felt exponentially better after he had showered and brushed his teeth. If there was anything good to come of this morning, it was that Draco was barely hungover. That was the one plus of sicking up everything you’d eaten and drunk in a day.
Draco suppressed a laugh. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. Potter, looking like a child, asking the person he’d fought with for six years if he thought he cared about him.
Before Malfoy could respond, two Healers burst in the room with shocked expressions on their faces.
Harry scoffed. “We’d be here all day if I listed all the reasons.”
Draco squeezed his hand under the table. When Harry glanced over at him, he mouthed, “You all right?”
“Alright, alright,” Draco said, removing his hand, a smirk playing at his lips. “I’m just trying to help those less fortunate than I.”
“Right,” Harry nodded, biting his lip. “And
“Oh.” Draco blinked. “Without Blaise?”
Draco sighed.
Harry stood up and grinned. “Let’s go.”
“Like rubbish,” he answered truthfully.
“The Muggles have a term for it, did you know? The Florence Nightingale Effect. It’s when patients think they’ve developed romantic feelings for their caretaker, given their vulnerable state and gratitude towards the caretaker. But it’s not real, Harry.”
It was fascinating seeing them together. Malfoy’s curt, quiet mannerisms and refined dress; his pointy face and grey eyes looking down at the young woman who walked beside him. Cait’s trendy outfit, her discreetly colored hair, loud voice, and that sly smile.
Weasley nodded. “Right.”
It wasn’t their fault. Harry had been the one who shut himself in and pushed everyone away. Ron and Hermione had invited him out countless times, he’d just been too fucked up to actually go – either mentally or physically. Or both.
,” Pansy whined, dropping down onto his bed. “Come outside, you’re missing everything.”
Harry kissed it.
It was more complicated than that, but he didn’t feel like elaborating, even if he could sort through the muddled layers of self-loathing and guilt and all those other things that ripped at him.
uninterested, almost aggressively so. Biting his lip, he looked away.
he thought sternly to himself.
"What happened?" she asked immediately. After all these years, after all they've been through together, after all Harry had put her through, Ginny knew him all too well.
“Morning, Potter,” Malfoy greeted as he came in.
Draco couldn’t stay still; Harry’s praises went straight to his cock, and all he wanted was for Harry to touch him some more.
“I mean –“
Potter ignored this and stepped closer. Draco turned back around and met his gaze - the real one. He was slowly coming back to earth, and he wasn't happy.
His irritation bubbled and grew as Draco made his way out of the castle. He hardly noticed his surroundings as he stalked through the nearly deserted halls; dinner was already over.
Betty smiled, and amazingly enough, Harry did too.
It was the strangest thing. Even stranger than switching sides during a battle, even stranger than being saved by an invisible someone and being punched by them afterward, even stranger to think that this old, towering castle was being destroyed as he survived.
“Morning,” Draco greeted softly.
But Leonel said nothing; he moved to kiss him. Draco returned it, but the kiss felt strangely hollow. Perplexed, he pulled back and his heart stuttered violently in his chest.
Pain suddenly shot down his spine, forcing him back on his bed. He groaned through gritted teeth and gripped the bed sheets tight as he rode it out.
“That’s wonderful!” Kathy beamed. “Is there any particular reason as to why you’ve had such a good week?”
He swore he was still bloated as he ran his hand up and down his stomach.
“Why not?”
He tore his eyes away from Harry and glared at Astoria, whose eyes were bright and playful.
He glanced up, chewing his bottom lip in nervousness. Malfoy had a peculiar expression on his face, and when he met Harry’s eyes, there was a flicker of a smile. It changed his face completely for a split second.
“What are you experiencing now, if it’s worse than usual?”
“What?” Pansy’s voice carried through the library; they both winced, expecting Madam Pince to swoop down on them at any moment. When they figured it was safe, Pansy continued in a hushed voice. “Draco! How could you not tell me? A week?”
"Very well,” she frowned slightly. “Who is this client, and how did he come into your care?"
“I’m assuming you’ve finished all your rounds?”
Affronted and slightly hurt, Harry sputtered, “Obsession? What – “
“Why did I take Arithmancy?”
Harry knew when to give up and conceded, sitting down and gritting his teeth, blood rushing to his head and making him dizzy once more.
Draco looked down and realized that he did indeed have his wand out. He had no memory of taking it out, but there it was, clenched tightly in his hand. He glanced up at Harry’s stony face, and as shame replaced anger, he stowed it away. Harry released his hold on him.
Harry’s sweaty face went from frustrated to surprised understanding.
“Give it here,” Draco stretched his hand out and Harry passed the bottle to him.
“Yeah, brilliant,” said Harry. “That’d be great.”
Harry didn’t say anything; he crossed his arms and looked at the clock, away from Malfoy’s stupid face.
, she had said, her bony hands clasping his own.
It really wouldn’t be that hard to escape, Harry reasoned. Even without his wand, he could chance sneaking out. Yeah, he’d look mental with only the hospital gown and no shoes, but it was possible.
“Ginny,” Harry gritted out, swatting at her foot with no real force. “It’s not just that, you know it. He – Malfoy’s been like…almost a completely different person, and I think I actually like that person. There’s bits and pieces that are still the same, but the important stuff, that’s different. He’s really…
She nodded and walked to the door. Her hand on the knob, she stopped and turned to look back at him.
being sober, Ginny, but I reckon I have to be. I can’t keep doing this.”
Draco found that he quite liked Astoria. She was clever and honest, often bluntly so. She was smarter than most others her age and preferred actual conversations over useless gossip. She actually talked to him instead of ignoring or taunting him like others in their House (or rather, others in Hogwarts), and seemed interested in what he had to say.
Harriet realized before Malfoy did that he'd just divulged something very personal. Something he hadn't been meaning to share...certainly not something he ever wanted her to know about, "I--I understand. I did the same thing," she didn't know why, but she felt she owed him a courtesy. Something so that he would know she wasn't making fun of him, nor judging him, "I kicked him," Harry blurted, something she'd never told anyone she'd done, not even Ron or Hermione when they'd asked what had taken her so long. She'd told them what she'd said, screamed at him, rather. But she'd been ashamed of the kick.
"I don't mean now. I mean back then. That night. Why did you go looking for me?" Harriet blurted quickly, before she lost her nerve. She'd always wondered, but seeing as their interactions were, well, almost never, she hadn't gotten the chance.
Harriet nodded gratefully, Gawain Robards had taken over the Auror department. He was one of the few aurors who had been able to stay with the department after she and Ron had joined and made a movement to weed out corruption by yanking at the roots. Robards was great at his job--but he was a bit of a blunt arse, if Harry was being honest. As blunt as he could be, however, he and Harry had a decent relationship. He respected what she'd done and had been impressed by her skillset. Her ability to adapt, to learn, and fight for what was right.
He was smiling then too, and, as their shots delivered, they drank them together without breaking eye contact.
She swept from the Great Hall quickly after that before her chest caved in on itself. The only place she could think of was the dungeons, a pit as dark and lonely as the dead man she was bringing there. Just outside what she knew to be the Slytherin Common Room, Harriet dropped to her knees and let Riddle's body hit the floor without a care.
"Well. They say to assume is to make an ass out of you and me. Ass-u-me," Harriet told him with an embarrassed laugh, as her response had been much cheekier when she'd sent it, and rather droll when she had to explain it.
Potter,
Harry laughed gently again and dropped her hand from his arm a beat later.
"Mr. Malfoy, please report," Kingsley instructed upon entering the room, ignoring Weasley's open mouth and clear indignation. Kingsley's eyes flicked over Harriet who lay impossibly still on the makeshift cot Malfoy had transfigured for her while they'd waited. He cast a cooling charm before delivering. They were the only thing that could dull the pain so early on in the curse.
“Right, then,” Ron muttered, inspecting it.
“You’re buying that tie? Really Neville? For the love of Merlin, who are you planning on giving it to? And are you ready for what they’ll do to you when they realise that it’s not actually black?” Harry looked at the plain packaging that ‘The Worst Tie You Could Possibly Imagine’ came with and wondered who Neville even knew that wore ties.
“There was a better gift, you just have to figure out how to get it.” He had a particularly smug look on his face and his grin only got wider as Draco glared at him.
“I’ll take one pink and rainbow and three Christmas ones. Here. I’ll see you this weekend. ‘Mione’s been complaining that we’ve barely seen you recently.”
“No, no, I refuse. That’s disgusting!” Draco started walking away from his friend. “And tell Theo that I won’t accept his gift either if it is also wrapped in a frog.”
Together until the end
“How did you get Aunt Andy to not mention that you visit with me most of the time?” Draco quietly asked him.
The next time the four were together they discovered what the smoke had done. They could only speak together if there was a fifth person with them. Anytime the four were alone together no words would come out of their mouths. This effect was only lifted at the joint Malfoy-Potter bachelor’s party on Christmas Day, right before the wedding.
“Apart from my excellent company, you mean?”
“Shouldn’t you be off somewhere playing hero?”
This chapter is also very short
But you chased me
“No mother, I refuse to step foot into that Shop. I will just have to find something to do with this, I’m sure I can find something.”
“Our Yule was successful, and I’m well. One of the Abraxans, sadly, is unwell. A mare is due to foal soon but the pregnancy does not seem to be advancing successfully I’m worried that we will lose both when the birth comes.” his father turned towards his mother, “I’m going to call Marks at the Creature Hospital when it opens on Monday it’s not something to bother him with over Christmas.” he sat down at the table next to his mother. “Draco, I hope you are well.”
“I’m also a little tired, while I do enjoy working on night shifts they are more tiring than an equivalent day shift. Once I’ve finished the next run of nights I think I need to take some time off before I push myself too hard. Shall we eat, or should we start with exchanging gifts?” Draco felt nervous about what gifts Harry had bought for his parents, almost as nervous as he was about his own gifts for later in the day.
“Anyway, I propose a toast.” the four men grabbed their glasses. “To successful matchmaking, and no more gag gifts!”
“Well, that was surprising. I didn’t expect your parents to warm up to me that quickly.”
“Yeah, she wants them immediately. She’s too young to understand why we’re waiting, but she knows that the presents are for her. The paper should discourage it fairly quickly, I hope.”
Once everyone was finished the group moved back into the sitting-room he ended up back on the sofa they had sat on earlier, with Harry sat on a cushion at his feet. Once everyone was sat down he watched Victoire carefully make her way to the pile of presents under a tree in the corner of the room and start to pass them out. After she had returned to her parents Harry passed out their gifts. He watched the reactions to his gifts hoping that there weren’t any bad reactions.
“Draco, Love, I was hoping they would try for at least one more year. I was going to swap their gift out for this when I wrapped it for them.” The brunet pulled a box out of his pocket and got down on one knee next to the table. Green eyes met grey. “Will you do me the honour of marrying me, my Love?”
Old wounds not quite scarred
“What’s wrong? What’s wrong, he asks! When we were meant to spend the day together relaxing and enjoying our day to ourselves before the visits we have planned for the next two days.” Draco went back to pacing across the room.
I'm not entirely sure what will post the week after
“Weasley, I almost thought your bizarre plan was going to fail.”
“What are you doing here, Potter?”
“Can I get three for Christmas and two for Rosie’s birthday as a set of five?”
“Do you want a receipt?”
“You know what I do, Love, and you know that I can't always control when I’m needed,” Harry said soothingly. His tone was calm and caring which only made Draco angrier.
“I love you too, you idiot. I’ve just spent the day stressing about all the things that could possibly go wrong at my parents and at the Weasleys. All I could think about was that I wanted you here. I’m sorry I hurt you by taking the extra run of nights, I hadn't thought about how it would affect you. I only took it as it gives me the opportunity to be running the emergency room for the night, I’ve not done that without supervision before and as soon as I was offered the chance, I took it without thinking.”
"Draco," his mother called to him after he had passed in front of her for the tenth time, "if you are so nervous that you cannot focus on anything else why don't you change into your Animagus and go to sleep in my lap until they return. I am sure your father will not do anything to hurt Harry, especially after his gift yesterday. He is most likely just doing his duty as your father and affirming Harry's intentions towards you."
As each person unwrapped their gifts there were shouts, and people jumping up to hug him. He started to get overwhelmed by all the redheads crowding him. He barely noticed when Harry stood up in front of him causing the group of exuberant thankers to step back. Harry led him up to the room they were sharing for the night and got him settled in bed.
You watched me run
Eventually, the rest of the extended Weasley clan came down into the kitchen, probably drawn down by the smell of the cooking breakfast. The morning meal was much quieter than the evening before, as most were tired from the previous few days. After the meal was finished, he and Harry saying slow goodbyes to all the Weasleys before Flooing back to Malfoy Manor.
“Fine then, on your own head be it. Want me to wrap it for you?  With the charmed paper?”
Posted later than planned due to having had a migraine that lasted across Sunday and Monday
“What the fuck, Blaise?” Draco stared down at the parcel he had just been given. It was wrapped in the gaudiest wrapping paper you could imagine, which was less surprising when you noticed the three golden W’s floating in and out of the pattern.
Every day another spat
“Food first, darling,” his mother told him, and then signalled to their house elf for the food. It was a fairly simple breakfast, and they all finished in little time. Once they had all finished he stood and brought the pile of gifts along the table. He passed his gifts to his parents. He had found a necklace he was sure his mother would love, and a rare book on breeding the various magical horse breeds for his father. He picked up the parcel for Harry and passed it to him before opening his own. As he unwrapped it he was overwhelmed by what his parents had given him, while he had his trust vault he had not expected to be given a key to the main family vault until he was married at the earliest.
He sighed.“It was a gift from Blaise. In the box, it appeared to be a plain black tie. I do not know why he insists on giving me these ridiculous gifts, considering he has included the receipts with I’m assuming he knows I will hate them.” he unknotted the tie and the colours faded back to the black he had seen in the box. “I do have to admit some of the spell work is impressive, especially for Weasleys.”
“It was the only wrapping paper I could find. I needed more than I had originally bought and everywhere else was sold out. It won’t let you open it until the 25th, all their wrapping paper is spelled to prevent peeking and considering where it’s from I wouldn’t want to try and get around it, who knows what it might do.”
“How did you know? I thought you said Weasley hadn’t bought anything that wasn’t obviously for his spawn this year.”
“Definitely. Bye.”
“We want you to take over running the investments using the family vault, Draco. All the suggestions you have made so far have been more successful than we ever expected, and we feel that you will be able to keep this going even with your commitments. We are proud of how well you have been managing to balance your training and your commitment to our family.”
.” The confidence he could see on Harry’s face settled his own nerves.
A couple of minutes later he heard the backdoor open again. He watched Harry make his way to the tree he was hidden in and then settle on the ground beneath him.
“I think I know what’s going on with our friends.” Harry felt a shiver go down his spine at the grin on Malfoy’s face. “Why don’t you process this refund, and then close up the shop early and we can discuss it, and how we can get back at them.”
“None of them smoke, and unless one of the many Weasleys smokes, then none of them have use for it, so they will have to get rid of it somehow, assuming they de-frog it.”
“Malfoy, I thought you had sworn never to step foot in this store.”
“Well then Harry, feel free to call me Narcissa. I don’t think I ever thanked you for saving Draco’s life, and for speaking for us at the trials. I don’t know what would have happened to us if you hadn’t.”
“I just told her what was going on. She was a Slytherin you know.”
Thanks to
The next morning, he marched into the gaudy building that housed the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes store and, ignoring all the ostentatious displays, made his way directly to the counter at the back of the store. There were a few customers around and Draco thought he could see the distinctive Weasley red hair out of the corner of his eye. Without looking at the person behind the counter he put the box on the table, with the receipt on top.
The next morning he was awake earlier than he had expected. He woke Harry and once they were ready the pair went down to the kitchen. They quietly made themselves some tea and toast, and just sat in the kitchen enjoying spending the calm early morning together.
Draco pulled Harry into a hug. “Friends grow apart, Darling. It happens to everyone. You spent almost every day with them for nine years, maybe those connections needed all that time to keep them strong. You haven’t stopped being friends now, it just takes a bit more effort than it did though school and when you were partnered with the Weasel as Aurors.” Harry felt Dreaco gently press his lips against Harry’s.
“That’s a little complicated. But, essentially, the Twins were the first to realise that working as an Auror was slowly killing me. After I quit, they told me they were happy to let me help them out with research and development, as long as I didn’t mind helping out in the shop when needed; summer, the run up to Christmas and today. Though I’m still not sure why they want to be open today. You’ve been my only customer so far.” Harry cast a quick tempus charm. “And considering the shop closes in about half an hour you are likely to be the only customer at all.”
“Mr Potter, welcome to our home, I hope you are well.”
After the shock of Harry's gift, the four wixen moved into the family sitting room and spent the remainder of the morning quietly talking, though his father said little. Eventually, it was time to floo to the Burrow. As they stood to leave his mother pulled Harry into a hug before giving Draco one.
“I’m sure I can, let’s go home, Love.”
(See the end of the chapter for
As they walked through the manor to the floo parlour he turned to Harry, "even if you don't give an explanation for your gift to my father, I would like to know how you secured the pardon and why you were allowed to be the one to give it to him."
“You have to kiss it to get your gift, it’s another Weasley product. Theo insisted we use it, he said it was appropriate since you were always the Prince of Slytherin so it is only right you should kiss a few frogs to get your prince.”
He took his mother's advice and turned and let the soothing motion of her hand running through his fur settle his nerves. He listened as she told him about the plans she and his father had made for the coming year, knowing that they could travel more freely. She also told him of their plans to give back to the wizarding world by donating to various causes that they felt needed it, including St Mungos and the orphanage that Harry had helped found. She also told Draco how she hoped to be able to volunteer at the orphanage, though she didn't want to be seen as trying to buy the family's reputation back. Draco’s father was going to offer to run an equestrian course at Hogwarts as an extracurricular, as well as offer to be a guest lecturer in the care of magical creatures class on the differences between the various Magical and Muggle horse and horse adjacent breeds, how to care for them and train them.
“Would you like to come visit my flat after you have finished working, Potter? I think it would be fun to catch up.”
“Love, that’s brilliant!” he beamed at Draco, “I wish you had said how important an opportunity it was. I’m impressed! You said it usually takes much longer before you are allowed to run an emergency room. Once I’m back at the department I think I should go and tell my boss that I can't be working all these extra hours. I hate not seeing you for days, and if I am persuasive enough I might be able to get more flexible hours, so I can see you more.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, did you even touch it?” Harry asked as he gently ran his hand along Draco’s exposed back.
“What’s wrong with what I’m wearing? I thought it was rather understated.”
“I heard from Andy that he wears it each time he visits little Teddy. It was just a matter of finding something he could find no excuse for keeping and had no-one to pass onto.”
“I want to take you to the cinema and the theatre. You’d probably enjoy opera, and I’d sit through exactly one for you.  Any more than that, and you’d have to be very convincing about it.”
"I can wait, though I am going to be dying of curiosity the entire time." They entered the green flames and stepped out into the busyness that was the Weasleys kitchen. It was even more crowded than it normally was due to the large amount of food that was being prepared.
“Yeah. They can.” Harry dropped the fake voice, “as long as they bring it back within a month and it’s undamaged they’ll get a refund. Who is your new partner, anyway?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Malfoy.”
“She’ll get over you soon, mate. I think ‘Mione mentioned she was interested in one of her teammates after the last time they chatted over the Floo. I’ll see you at Christmas, thanks again.” The redhead turned and almost ran out of the shop before apparating away.
Draco had worked himself up into a bundle of nerves over the afternoon, and as the day wore on he had gone from irritated at Harry for working on his day off, to mad that he hadn’t been there to keep him from working himself into the panicked frenzy he was now in. He turned towards the small hallway as he heard the door open.
“Lunchtime Saturday. Good with you?”
“Well, it’s not like I know your company is excellent, it’s not like I have many examples of it.”
The first time we spoke
“I did. It’s based on a muggle kids story where a princess kisses a talking frog who turns into a prince. It doesn’t have a time lock, so don’t let it get kissed early.  And don’t let it get damaged, either, or the gift will be damaged, too.  Oh, and it’ll be a permanent transfiguration if you let it sit for more than six months.”
"You're here, everyone is in the living room." Mrs Wealsy greeted them with warm, strong hugs. She then hurried them into the next room where they were greeted by a chorus of hellos as the various groups of people in the room noticed their arrival. They were the last to arrive and not long after they had sat down beside George, the entire group was called into the kitchen for the large Christmas dinner that Mrs Weasley had prepared. He found himself sat between George and Bill with Harry opposite him. He was glad to be sat with the quieter of the Weasley siblings, and those who he had less history with. He tried to keep his contributions to the conversation fairly simple and respectful as much for his own nerves as any worry about causing a fight. If he was honest with himself, which he tried to be, it was mostly out of nerves. He found the meal overly rowdy, with everyone grabbing food off various plates and serving dishes being passed up and down the table, he found it very different to the meal they had with his parents earlier that day.
“What did you do to upset the Twins?” she asked him.
Remember how those fights changed
He felt harry gently shake his shoulder bringing him out of his dozing. They arranged for his parents to visit them in the next few weeks so they could finally see their house, as neither had been allowed to visit when they moved in. Once they had finished with the goodbyes they returned to the Floo parlour and went through the fireplace to their home. Harry helped him get settled in bed for the second night in a row but he felt much more settled in himself and their relationship, as he drifted off to sleep, than he had even a day before.
Draco had decided to wait until he was back home after visiting the manor to unwrap Blaise’s gift that year, after the incident with the tie, he did not want to risk something else that would only reveal its true nature once he was with others. He carefully opened the wrapping paper and saw a box, with the golden triple W insignia of the shop and the letters ARFA. Completely stumped by the labelling, Draco slowly removed the lid of the box, as soon as there was a gap between the two parts of the box a bright green thing quickly flew out and hovered at his elbow. It continued to stay by his elbow as he moved around his flat. Once he realised it would not move out of arm's reach, Draco carefully examined the object.
“Thanks mate, see you at the Burrow again this year?”
Draco found it fascinating; the difference between Mrs Weasley’s mostly magical style of cooking and Harry’s use of many more muggle methods. He wondered whether his partner would have opened a restaurant or a bakery if he had not been recruited by the Unspeakables right after they took their NEWTs.
“It’s for Theo again. He didn’t like last year’s gift anywhere near as much as the Troll’s leg, so I thought I’d go for something similar to what worked before.” Harry mentally raised an eyebrow. He knew exactly who had been given the Troll’s leg, and it hadn’t been Theo Nott.
“It makes it easier to persuade you to close up early, so I can take you home to have my wicked way with you, Mr Potter.” Harry blushed at the boldness of Draco’s words.
And shared new dreams
“You’re not wrong. I definitely want my own children someday. I want an actual family of my own, especially since I don’t want my only family to be the relatives that hate me. I know I have my friends but they’re all starting their own families now. We’re not as close as we were. Hell, I’m closer to the Twins and Bill now than I am to Ron. Sometimes, I feel like I wouldn’t have been friends with Ron and Hermione if it wasn’t for all the mad stuff that happened at Hogwarts.”
Remember his first letter
“I still don’t see why you had to put the blame for that on me Blaise, Draco is still giving me funny looks.”
As the world went to hell
How empty the house felt
“I have to admit that the way the Twins applied the house colours was almost tasteful with this line of products” Harry looked at the box for the floating ashtray in Slytherin green and silver. “Who’s this for, then? I didn’t think any of your family smoked.”
“I am well, Sir. I hope you are well and had a good Yule. I also hope your Abraxans are well.”
“A Miniature Troll’s Leg Quill Holder, and look he’s included the receipt. That is quite a departure from his normal standards. Are you going to take it back to the shop, Darling?”
Remember when he left for school
“Darling, where did you get your tie; it’s clashing horrendously with everything.”
Just you and me
Another insult
“Yeah, that would be great!”
There will be an epilogue posted next Sunday
And everything changed
His father gave Harry a sharp look and unwrapped the box that was in front of him. He removed the lid and picked up the parent scroll that was inside. Draco was sure he had only read the first few words on the parchment before he dropped it and stared at Harry in a very unMalfoy-like way. His mother reached over and took the scroll but she didn't seem to get any further than his father had before she also dropped the parchment. He decided he needed to see what was written in the scroll which was so shocking it could cause both his parents to lose their composure and why it was something his, sometimes idiotic, partner thought would be appropriate as a Christmas gift.
I'm posting this as now as I've had a good week at Uni
Harry carefully pulled away from Draco and picked the parcel up from where they had left it on the living room table. “This is definitely the paper I sold to Ron. I added a second W to each of the Christmas papers I gave him. It wasn’t obvious if you don’t look at it everyday, but it was enough that I would be able to tell if they used it to wrap your ‘gift’.” he looked back at his boyfriend, “Did I tell you I accidentally found the pub the four of them meet at? It was a coincidence, I was walking past the Leaky when I heard Ron and Theo mentioning meeting Blaise at a muggle pub nearby for lunch. So, I went there just after I finished work and talked to the bartender. He told me they tend to meet up there at about five thirty in the afternoon on Boxing Day, and he thought that they seemed to be trying to drown their sorrows while most people are still celebrating the holiday. I’m really tempted to go there once they know we’ve seen each other and hide in a booth and see how they react to the end of their scheming.”
They were staring at her.
"--are in a village outside Surrey. Find Weasley, Coote, and Chambers. You're going to investigate. If you see anything, call it in and we'll send backup," Kingsley handed her a piece of paper without missing a beat, on it were written coordinates, "I told Robards to take the day off--he was a bit high strung when he came in yesterday."
the Dark Lord had fallen.
She looked up at the sound of footsteps approaching from just around the corner and her jaw dropped at the sight of him.
"Embracing the muggle world was something I wasn't ever able to do before. I took my newfound freedom these past three years to appreciate it," he pursed his lips, "Not to mention living on probation is easier if you go it the Muggle way," she didn't have a chance to ask him what he meant by that, nor how he was, how he found the muggle-way to be--nor any of the other things that suddenly threatened to burst from her lips.
"That's not what I meant. This is...quaint but chic. Very muggle. Rustic," Harriet raised her hand to the barmaid as she surveyed the scene, "I'm going for a shot and a pint--you in?" Malfoy nodded and she order for both of them, pleased to see that Malfoy had no qualms about her choice of drink. There was nothing normal about this. Harriet had to remind herself that she hadn't been normal a day in her life.
Her heart wasn't in it anymore. She was tired of trying to track down the last of the Death Eaters that hadn't answered for their crimes. Tired of following-up on reports of Death Eater copy-cats. Tired of confiscating Dark Magic items. Harriet had done her part for the world in this respect and, frankly, she just didn't want to do it anymore. When she had mentioned it to Ron and Hermione they'd smiled at her softly and wondered if maybe all she needed was a break. Hermione went so far as to say she was working herself too-hard again, and maybe she should try and set up an appointment with the Mind-Healer that had helped her and Ron after the war.
All she could think about was how she still desperately missed Remus and the way Tonks seemed to make him smile brighter than she'd ever seen before. How George seemed to be overcompensating for the loss of his other half, but the light in his eyes seemed entirely extinguished.
"Forgetting someone?"
Emerald met silver instantaneously and, before either of them could stop themselves, laughter bubbled from their lips. And kept bubbling from their lips, so much so that Harriet doubled over with an arm wrapped around her waist, her free hand outstretched to balance herself against Malfoy's sturdy form.
“The curse that was used on you was a curse created for Voldemort. A torture method used in the first and second war,” Hermione informed her. If she knew how much it would hurt to scoff bitterly, Harriet might’ve tried a bit harder to restrain herself.
"Lucky for us, you were on time," Malfoy said finally, sipping regally from his glass.
Ron and Hermione moved into her line of vision then, and it only took a look before Ron began to fill her in about the mysterious curse that had been used. He made sure to tell her it would wear off...eventually.
It was Narcissa who spoke quietly, breaking the silence that had fallen over them all, "Thank you for what you have done for my family, Harriet."
“You should go home—“
Malfoy pursed his lips and looked away from her, his eyes focused on the crash and the flashing lights as help arrived on scene, "I have it, too. Post-Traumatic Stress disorder. One of the Mind-healers who had to evaluate me before my trial diagnosed me."
She lifted her second glass of champagne to her lips and finished the last bit. As a server passed by her with a tray she grabbed two and slipped out a side exit before her photographs and the pinched smile she wore like armor got her in any trouble with her publicists (which the Ministry had forced upon her if she wanted to work for the Auror department). She'd asked the Patil twins two years ago if either of them would be interested, as she knew they were trying to make make a name for their company in the "celebrity" Wizarding World--and running damage control on a loose canon like Harriet Potter was a feat that many respected them for.
"Newsflash, Potter, we don't all need
"You'll have to ask her, Malfoy."
And then she remembered. Voldemort was dead. Her entire life's purpose had been fulfilled. She didn't have it in her to wonder what was next. To wonder what would happen now that she didn't have to be the Chosen One anymore. Those worries would come later.
don't need you offering friendship because you pity me--"
"Don't say things like that."
Of course, Harriet had told herself that she was doubting herself. She'd floored the auror examinations, passed each one with flying colors (no doubt thanks to the extensive training she'd put herself through sixth year with the senior members of the Order, including Snape). She'd learnt magic and skills that she never would have learned at Hogwarts. She'd been able to show off her wandless magic, even.
Harry could hear Hermione rolling her eyes through the phone, "Yes, Lavender too--but really, she's been getting on my nerves, did you hear what she said about House Elves the last time we met?"
She flinched sharply at this and her eyes flickered to the lump on the floor before her. Someone had thrown a sheet over him. Eyes were on her as she stepped forward until Riddle was at her feet. There was a flash of light.
"Hey Harry--have you got plans for tonight? I was hoping we could go get dinner--You, me, Ginny, Luna, Padma, Parvati?"
That was, if she even made it as an auror for another year.
