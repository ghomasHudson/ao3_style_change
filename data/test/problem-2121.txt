“Draco, don’t you dare…”
He glanced in Potter’s direction thoughtfully. The man hadn’t shifted from his seat, yet he hadn’t proposed any conversation. He was content to sit in Draco’s company, waiting for him to finish the soup that he had presumably prepared. Draco shook his head. Perhaps Potter believed it was just soup, but it wasn’t.
It was a bullshit argument — Draco knew that, Harry knew that, hell, even Teddy probably knew that — so there wasn’t much weight to Potter’s words. But when Harry cupped Draco’s chin in his hand, leaning in for a kiss, Draco couldn’t help melting.
Draco flopped onto his back, sitting up just enough to glare at Harry. “I
Potter set the bowl down on the wobbly bedside table, and settled into the chair beside it without waiting for so much as an invitation. Draco was tempted to be petty and force him out, but his stomach grumbled, chasing whatever scathing insults he was going to use out of his head.
“That was
“One too many times, you ought to get your Auror license revoked –”
It was Draco’s damn feelings that had gotten him into this mess.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Your friends’ invention is working exceedingly well,” he scoffed. “I can’t feel a thing.”
Merlin, he hoped his mother was being careful.
“Yeah,” Potter drawled, looking at Draco like he was slightly more insane than Potter assumed. “Just soup.”
“No-no,” Teddy repeated, wagging his finger in Draco’s face with deep concentration. The bed dipped in his direction as Harry sat down behind him.
“... have to stop fighting the real war, because the adults decided they wanted their jobs back, and now I’m stuck with
Damn his sleep-deprivation – Draco didn’t need sleep.
Draco lifted the bowl to his face, draining the last dregs of the soup. It was terrible manners; his mother would be ashamed of him, but it was surprisingly good soup, and Draco was hungry. Potter was a wonderful cook.
Potter stopped, his feet planted to the floor. “What?”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut as tightly as he could, fruitlessly praying that his gambit would work and the toddler would leave…
Harry gasped. “Oh, no, Teddy! Did
Potter rolled his eyes, holding out a spoon. It wasn’t a soup spoon, Draco noted, but he took it all the same. “I wouldn’t do that,” Potter reassured him. “Not after we’ve gone to all this trouble to keep you alive.”
“What,” Draco sneered. His elbow hurt, and his muscles were beginning to cramp from staying in the same position for so long. Not that he could move; the box, in addition to cutting off all feeling from his limb, was impossible to move without a wand – which Draco didn’t have.
Draco’s lips flattened. He was loath to agree with Potter on anything, but he suspected they were equally upset at the idea of him leaving Draco alone again. Draco had been alone practically from the moment they’d dropped him in this safe house, in this safe room. All those weeks ago, spending this much time alone would have been a blessing; ‘alone’ would have meant he was safe from the myriad Azkaban escapees and lunatics populating the halls of Malfoy Manor. But now that he truly was out of harm’s way, he found that ‘alone’ meant he was trapped in this room with his thoughts.
“Merlin, I hate you,” Draco scoffed affectionately, shaking his head at his ridiculous boyfriend. Swinging his legs off the side of the bed, he grabbed Teddy and deposited him on the floor. “Let’s go get breakfast, menace. Maybe Uncle Harry will spring for some croissants if we burn the bacon well enough.”
Teddy’s hair was a stream of unending colors out of the corner of Draco’s injured eye, changing rapidly as Teddy avidly watched them banter. He clapped when Draco landed a particularly witty barb, but Draco was conscious enough of his cousin’s age to know it probably had more to do with how Harry fell backwards like he’d been shot, rather than Draco’s skilled repartee.
, I don’t understand why McGonagall and Remus keep fabricating excuses to keep me out of the action…”
“Yeah.” Draco eyed the metal contraption around his left forearm with barely concealed distaste. “Thanks, I guess.”
“You little menace,” he groaned, rolling over. “Can’t you see I’m sleeping?”
“He missed his Uncle Draco.”
“What?” Draco snapped bitterly. He hated everything about this, except for the lack of Crucios and blind panic and fear… fine, he hated
He barely stopped himself from grabbing his wand from under his pillow and brandishing it at the intruder – some reflexes from the war took longer to fade than others – but he did, letting the adrenaline bleed out of him through his clenched fist.
Draco never regretted his mother’s post-war reconciliation with her sister more than mornings like this, when his sleep was abruptly interrupted by a tiny body landing on his bed.
“Draco,” he said, with a solemnity that never failed to make Draco want to laugh, “you were right.”
The walls at the safe house weren’t as thick as Draco would like. They definitely weren’t as thick as Harry Potter, the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, thought they were. Most of the time, Potter was tolerable; he and Draco stayed out of each other’s way as best they could in this miniscule house. But Draco dreaded Granger and Weasley’s biweekly visits, because they rarely ended with anything less than a shouting match that reverberated through the walls.
Draco was drawn into a sitting position, his arm floating weightlessly by his side. He closed his eyes, exhaling as his aching muscles were relieved. When he opened them, Potter was staring at him. “Is there… you know, has the Dark Lord summoned you?”
“No,” Draco grouched. “He’s my cousin, and I refuse to be called Unc – shite! Bloody hell, Teddy –” Teddy had flung his hand out – why, who knew? Draco’s cousin was always flailing – and his finger had jabbed straight into Draco’s cornea.
He got up on his knees, towering over Draco.
A crooked grin quirked the edge of Potter’s mouth, and he took the empty bowl of soup from Draco, setting it on the rickety table beside him. “I suppose I’ll stay, then,” he said. “For your entertainment.”
If Draco hadn’t encouraged his mum to talk to Aunt Andromeda, he might not have met Teddy. If he hadn’t ever met Teddy, he never would have had a chance to re-meet Harry.
things about this. Not everything.
Halfway through, Draco paused. “It’s just soup,” he realized suddenly.
“No. You know what
much, because if she hadn’t, Draco might not have met Teddy. He might not have discovered that Potter was planning on taking on some of the parenting duties, and he might not have insisted to be included. In which case, he would still be sleeping right now, after the wild night Blaise and Theo had insisted on the night before.
The bowl was warm to the touch, and heat emanated off the soup in a pleasant manner. Draco eyed it warily. It looked edible enough, even enjoyable, but… “Is it poisoned?”
“Well, I should go, I suppose.” Potter looked grim, faced with the prospect of leaving the room Draco nominally considered his cage. “Back to… read the books Hermione gave me, I guess.”
Interesting, yet somehow, Draco didn’t believe it for a moment.
The interruption never came. Potter was content to sit there, keeping Draco company while he ate.
Draco groaned, his head falling face first into his pillow. “I hate you.”
“It’s soup,” Potter said gruffly.
“Draco!” the toddler who had thoroughly conquered his life whined. “Up!” The poking had turned into pinching, and Draco knew that his blankets would be stolen next.
More pertinently to his current quandary, Draco couldn’t easily move. Even sitting up was an ordeal that he couldn’t muster the energy for. He let his head flop to the side, hoping that covering one ear would deafen him enough to tune the tumultuous argument out, and his gaze landed on the metal contraption at his side. The metal box was firmly fixed around his left forearm, making it impossible for Draco to move.
Draco was almost on Potter’s side, at this point. Just let him out, so he can fulfill his prophecy and kill the Dark Lord. So that Draco can feel both his arms for the first time in ages.
“Well.” Potter settled back down in his chair, looking at Draco. Draco forced himself to meet his gaze, forced his face into an implacable mask against the shiver that Potter’s vivid green eyes sent down his spine.
“Bullshit, that’s
Draco say a no-no word?” He pushed off of the doorjamb, crossing the room to their bed.
“Loooooove,” Harry drawled, smirking - a smirk Draco was certain he hadn’t known how to do before.
“God Save the Queen” plays as we take to the sky, circling the stadium while a giant lion with a mane of fire roars in the center of the pitch before twisting and morphing into a whinnying unicorn, then finally transforming into a dragon. The dragon breathes out a plume of fire, heating the entire stadium several degrees warmer before flying out into the sky. My eyes can’t help but follow its twisting path until it’s just a speck in the distance.
line.) As a result, Blaise suggested a wizarding plane. Unlike their Muggle equivalents, the trips were smoother and took half the time. Unfortunately for Draco’s vaults, they were still a novelty and only existed as chartered aircraft.
Harry’s last letter makes a lot more sense when my mother tells me she’ll be visiting with my aunt and my cousin, Teddy. And Harry fucking Potter. Can’t forget that somehow
have an itchy suit, I’ll never know.
This is it.
Horrified, I tear the page away from her.  I don’t want to know how well she can read or how many of those words they understand.  They’re too young to internalize how and why Draco is so scared.
He opened it to find tickets to the Premier League: Chelsea vs Arsenal. They had started watching the games together on the telly after seeing the beachgoers play in Rio. They yelled at the screen at terrible calls and went to a local Muggle pub when their team won. Draco considered it
Harry’s lips were clamped shut as though he didn’t want to emit a sound. Draco hadn’t anticipated just how tightly Harry kept control of his body, even when it came to sex. He felt emboldened by every sign that he was wearing Harry down with his seduction.
Finally, they reached the entrance to the Sacristy and found it empty. It took some time to locate the chalice; it was one of many gold and silver treasures in the protective plexiglass cases lining the walls.
“Is this what happened in that book? The one my basket recommended to you?” I ask, fully knowing the answer is no. I’ve read that book cover to cover repeatedly ever since he told me about it. I’ve memorized every scene and there’s no flirting on a stairway, nor in a museum/library.
“I’ve got it. Let’s go now,” Draco whispered harshly, trying not to bring more attention to the room while he clutched the golden cup to his chest and reached into his trench coat to grab the tranquiliser gun.
I drop him off at school and feel the slight pang I always do when he scampers off to be with his friends.  We both cried on his first day of school because he didn’t want to go, but now he looks so happy.  It’s bittersweet.
“It’s not an impulse, I know what I want — I’ll be here next week at this time then,” Harry responds defensively, unwilling to admit that Malfoy is right.
Someday maybe I’ll tell him I’ve listened to old wireless streams of his matches. I put them on when I’m cleaning or folding my laundry and cheer as though I were there in the stands when he inevitably catches the Snitch. Because of course he does. I only listen to his victories, waiting to hear the stupid grin in his voice as he gives a post-match press conference. (Then, obviously, I picture him in that glorious bespoke suit. And out of it.)
“How about a bottle of your best wine? Something tells me I might be here a while.”
“You think or you’re sure?”
As soon as the server cleared their dishes, Harry spoke, “Thank you for inviting me tonight. I know you needed a person to get the full experience for your review, so I’m glad I could help out.”
He also loves Paris.  Which arrondissement did we stay in the last time we went?  The fourth?  I write it down.
I don’t know how much time passes as I sit there, my fingers running over the words, my connection to Draco.  I’ve always been impulsive and been able to jump into action, a trait that has made me good at my job, but this time... I can’t do anything but sit and read.  Again.
“I wasn’t kidding about training near Salem, Draco. We can make it work. I
Bugger it all.
But with Potter — Harry — I’d relied on liquid courage. And boy, had it been worth it.
But more noticeable than any of the stores are the throngs of people crowding the sidewalks, arms weighed down by bags of various sizes and colors holding the day’s purchases and extravagances.
“He’s good to you?”
After nixing six outfits, Draco had gone to Madame Malkin’s to commission a new set of robes. He couldn’t rewrite the first impression he gave in that same shop years earlier, but he wanted to look his best on their first date. He had seen enough Muggle romantic comedies with Pansy to know that he wanted the Cinderella moment.
“What does ‘partying like everyone else’ entail?”
I feel a gentle tug on my sleeve, and those beautiful grey eyes are staring back at me innocently.  Our son’s the perfect mixture of the two of us.
“My arse is too precious to risk, but I chose an American wine for solidarity. Cheers!” Blaise drawled. Channelling that unconcerned attitude was comforting for Draco as he readied himself for the heist.
As Harry’s mouth worked to take Draco in further, cheeks hollowing, he held out a hand. Draco was amazed as a drawer on the bedside table opened, and a bottle of lube flew into the outstretched hand.
I wonder how the loving father, the man that has surpassed my dreams, can see himself as nothing when he is my
I can’t think.
He finally had a date with Harry.
“If we put our resources into studying the returned artefact, then we might miss an even bigger heist,” Moreau admitted.
“If you didn’t think of today as a date, that’s okay. I’m sorry I made you uncomfortable. I just thought... a film and dinner is one of the most traditional Muggle dates, and so I assumed you meant it as... yeah.” Harry’s voice trailed off as he spoke. He looked down and tried to pull his hand back, but Draco wouldn’t let go.
“Oh.”
.  That’s red and that’s green.  It’s not Christmas!”
“Just think of it as skinny dipping, with the potential for extra fun,” Draco murmurs hotly against Harry’s ear, before playfully pushing him into the water.
Running was his time to let go of stress, meditate on life, and, of course, maintain his trim physique.
“You daft git, we can’t be a family without you!  You’re our rock, Draco.  It doesn’t matter what anyone else says, you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to us.  And honestly, I can’t deal with another night of
“You know Potter, you say ‘fuck’ an awful lot. To put it similarly, he’s fucking Blaise. His boyfriend.” Draco smirked as he knew he had the upper hand for the first time since the interrogation started.
As he got up to shower, he tried to tamp down his optimism that Harry would be at the dinner and had promised to sit next to him.
I curl up under the covers and pretend to sleep.  Harry comes in and molds his body around mine, the warmth of his chest against my back like a furnace.
“And that means bothering me at work? Why can’t you just party like everybody else?”
“When you put it that way...”
“He’ll be sworn to secrecy, and we can trust him. Actually, we need him more than anyone else in the Order because of his position,” Harry interjected.
“How are you and Regulus doing?” Hermione asks after pulling me into a warm hug.
“I can talk to the hotel staff and get it changed,” Draco offered, hoping Harry did not hear his disappointment.
In just a few minutes, I’ll leave to run to the T to meet my family at Copley. And somehow Harry is taking up these last moments, just as I know he’ll take over my thoughts on the Green Line. As though he hasn’t taken over my life enough.
He had initially chosen to be a Seeker because of his rivalry with Harry and the prestige that often came with the position. He soon found he loved the freedom of exploring the whole pitch, dodging obstacles, and just... flying. There was a singular aim; he didn’t have to worry about scoring as much as possible. The match could narrow to him, Harry, and the Snitch.
“Potter, I honestly didn’t expect you to actually come back.” There’s that clipped posh tone. The one Harry finds sexy, even as it insults him.
He confided a lot in her. She was the first person to know when he started dating his first boyfriend, and she had immediately taken it in stride. Ron, on the other hand, had not taken the news as well. Not that Ron hadn’t tried to be supportive, but it took a while for him to process. He was (as Hermione would put it) his usual tactless self, with the emotional range of a teaspoon.
“Mr Malfoy,” a man with a predatory grin said, “we need to talk with you.”
Draco was happy they could apparate near the cinema instead of taking the Tube. He had made
advanced charms. I don’t even read the description, I just trust the magic.
The men grabbed onto Draco’s arms, and then the trio apparated directly to the Ministry. To an interrogation room, to be precise. The chair and table were metallic and cool to the touch, chosen to make the people who were brought here feel uncomfortable.
Then I see it. The headline. The fucking headline.
He was too close — after all the anticipation and the fantasies, he’d be damned if he let their first night end with quick blow jobs. A part of Draco still worried that even though they had confessed their mutual feelings, this could be their last night together if it didn’t go perfectly.
Draco looked at the bed that could easily fit four adults. The two could comfortably share with plenty of space in between them, but it would be torture to sleep so close and yet so far from Harry.
I vaguely remember asking last night, “So are you really that into the national team that not only did you come all the way out here, but you ordered champagne?”
“He seems okay, but meal times have been rough.  All I can make is cereal and toasties so that’s what we ate. I cut the bread vertically, and he was upset that it wasn’t cut in diagonals because he says it tastes better that way.  I knew I missed a lot in his life, but I hadn’t realized just how much Draco knew that I didn’t,” I whisper, so the kids don’t overhear, but also because I’m realizing how useless I am without my other half.
I take a nap.
My pulse had skyrocketed and my stomach flipped as I wondered just how much practice Harry had with those very spells… not that I could or would judge him for having an active sex life. But I didn’t want to just be a quick fuck to a wizard who’d exerted such an outsize influence on my life. Even though that’s exactly what we had done: a one-night stand.
Thrown on the floor next to the suitcase was a red fedora with a black trim, an odd juxtaposition to the neutrals of the room.
He heard a rough voice calling him. Who?
“Of all the questions you could ask and that’s what you start with? It’s Ministry mandated rehabilitation. Why did you…?”
“Excuse me sirs, if you must be noisy, please go to the courtyard to speak. You’re causing a ruckus.” The curly haired docent smiles politely as she points towards the window, where I can see the tips of the green trees in the courtyard below.
“I could ask you the same question about Pansy, based on the ring on
“You should let Gra–Hermione know you’re safe. My Portkey back to England leaves in the morning. Afterwards, can we meet with Blaise and Neville?”
Through the murky water, he can see that Draco’s legs are equally ravaged. They’ll have a physical reminder under their robes for
As far as they could tell, no one suspected them, so the Order was still a step ahead of VILE. To be safe, Draco and Harry started setting up explanations for their world travelling: conferences, foundation check-ins, diplomatic missions, etc.
He had planned on taking after his father post-Hogwarts: marrying an appropriate and family-approved girl and having a son to carry on the family name. It was his duty; his family had reminded him since he was born—an entire life dictated by tradition.
They both sat in silence, sipping their drinks before Neville launched into updates from his Hogwarts colleagues. It was a comforting topic and reminded Harry of their school years.
“Wow,” I hear as he holds up one of the finished panels for my latest book.  It’s based loosely on my trip to Spain as a child, some of my fondest memories.  I’ve never been back, but I hope to bring Reg someday.
When? For how long? Was I his gay awakening, just as he was mine?
Our son is ashamed of me.  I don’t even know how he heard about my past, but it’s a reminder that people will never forget.  Our children will forever be marked by my name.
The motorcycle slowed to a stop and Draco realized they’d gone back to the school. They both clambered off the machine and James leaned against it, crossing his arms. “So what do you think?”
“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Harry whispered, hand trembling as he placed it in Draco’s soft, warm one. Their relationship had improved, but he didn’t want his former rival to witness his lack of talent.
Draco reviewed the words on the letter from the Magpies’ Chaser as he waited for Harry to arrive at the pitch.
One foot in front of the other.  A few steps more.  My body knows the way home.
He put the fedora on and vanished, grateful that at least no one else would see it.
But last night, when an exasperated Narcissa chided her son for never visiting his father, Harry’s world had shifted. Gone was his tidy explanation, and he drowned in a sea of what-ifs.
Harry would have traded a mound of paperwork for the mess of a day he had had. It was
“Weasley? I hope he also told you that a tattoo like his takes multiple sessions. It’s not an impulse ink.”
Harry Fucking Potter.
“What are
“Something light... maybe on the dry side?”
Draco no longer played often. He missed the rush of adrenaline, the rousing cheers, and the anticipation of glimpsing gold fluttering in the distance.
“Daddy’s not here though.”
Everything goes white.
This pregnancy is worse than the last.  I can’t breathe properly.  I can’t sleep.  I haven’t had sex in days.  It isn’t because I’m huge (although I am).  It isn’t because I can’t even see anything anymore below my belly (although I can’t), nor is it because Harry isn’t up for it (he always is).  I’m often too exhausted, or we get interrupted.
Malfoy advances slowly, as though approaching a wild animal, picking up a menu along the way and sliding it to me.
It was impossible. “
Somehow in the past couple of months of working with Harry, he became accustomed to how his now-boyfriend would throw his things everywhere and then claim it made Draco’s orderly London flat look “lived in.”
I nearly trip and drop a glass. My lack of grace would horrify my mother, but I can
How repressed was he that with one brush of the hand, which was most likely accidental, he was already aroused? He would have to buy Hermione a box of her favourite truffles as a gift for taking the hint to leave him alone with Malfoy.
He saw a flash in the corner of his eye. He dove.
“I’ve got you,” he vowed, his voice thin and breathy.
“Thank you, but I don’t need your money,” Malfoy stated and tried to return it to her.
At least with magic, I don’t have to worry about luggage, too.
“Two votes for that’s flirting from over here,” came a distant laughing voice: Neville, this time. Draco was glad they couldn’t see the slight flush on his face at their words.
“‘M not picky.”
If he was going to be fighting an invisible enemy, at least he was doing it with Draco and with the support of their friends. If VILE could operate in the shadows, so could they.
I gather what little energy I have to put together a few belongings in a small bag with an extension charm.  Hermione had given one to each of us to use on our honeymoon.  They are a matching set with our names embroidered on them:  Mr. Draco Potter-Malfoy and Mr. Harry Potter-Malfoy.  I run my fingers over the words.
I would do anything for our son.  I would die for him.  He’s my pride and joy.  It’s why this is the last time.  For him.
story.
“I love you, darling.  Forever and always, no matter what.  I love you,” I whisper and kiss his little forehead.
Breathe in. Breathe out.  I pull up the memory I usually use to cast a Patronus: our wedding.  I try to infuse that happiness in my smile.
A short, stocky wizard met the pair on the headquarters’ front steps.
“Well, at least I don’t have to eat broccoli.”
The sun was going to set shortly, so they stopped by another stand to buy plastic cups of açaí. This time Harry bought two so he could focus on eating his own instead of how Draco’s tongue swirled around a cheap plastic spoon as he ate the cold, sweet treat.
“Er... any chance you speak Spanish?” Harry asked. Draco shook his head.
He felt even more clueless as Pansy’s entire body shook, and a few giggles escaped from where her first pressed against her mouth. His ego prevented him from asking what he was missing.
When the pounding in my head worsens, and I’m out of tears, I notice Harry’s shoulder is wet and covered in streaks of bogies.
My mind is blank. I’m not sure if I’ll ever process that statement. I run through those words, individually and in pairs. I know what they mean, but
“I’m still not fully used to holidays with the Weasleys,” Harry admitted in his ear at one point when Ginny loudly threatened Ron with a Bat Bogey Hex for talking about her dating life with their mother.
“Asmo?”
His eyes wide, he looked back at Draco. No… at Malfoy.
Harry brushed off his attempted apology and ripped open the paper to see the rows of perfectly formed truffles. He wasted no time in taking off the lid noisily and popping one in his mouth.
“Love, are you there?” I ask the seemingly empty room as I turn on the lights.
Harry looked around at their bedroom: at the oil lamp with a Tiffany glass shade, the intricately carved bureau, and the mirror with an ornate silver-wrought frame. It had never occurred to him where they’d come from.
How did that magic work that it picked a book so similar to our situation even before I’d seen Draco?
An hour later, James perked up suddenly and said “Want to go for a ride with me?”
Draco wasn’t sure what he expected, but clubbing with the man you’re in love with? Horrible idea. Terrible. Awful.
his pathetic crush would be a topic of discussion for the couple later.
“I see them on my map, Little Dragon. Not too complex. You might be able to do it now instead of risking a second trip.”
“Even though I barely use magic and have cut off almost all contact with the Wizarding world?”
, I correct. Between work, family, and friends, it feels like our lives are over-scheduled. I should go to sleep, cosy up beside Harry, and make the most of the few hours left. But I fancy a cuppa, so I head to the kitchen.
“Harry doesn’t hate you. He’s loyal to his job, but might help if he knew that you’re doing the right thing.”
He looks at me but doesn’t move, and I give him a hug.
He pictured the room that housed the special exhibit: the haunting paintings depicting women in dark, colonial dresses being sentenced in Muggle courtrooms, the display cases of court documents, and the carefully planned lighting. The ring was in the centre of it all, accompanied by a magnified 3-D rotating display to allow visitors to study its features and imperfections.
On their first day, Blaise suggested a walk in the historic city. As they walked, they heard tourists chattering with shopkeepers in broken Italian and smelled freshly brewed coffee. As they ambled along the Ponte Santa Trinita towards the famous Duomo, they stopped to admire the Arno while Blaise gave the river’s history of overflowing its banks and devastating the city. He pointed to the next bridge over, the Ponte Vecchio, famous for its gold shops.
The last thing I ever expected was to see Harry Potter in the flesh again. I’d accepted that. Forgotten my schoolboy crush. Built a new life for myself.
In Harry’s mind, it confirmed that the main thief was not connected with the other thieves. Despite what Lewis had said, he thought the loss of invisibility was a mistake and not a taunt. It didn’t explain the hat, but would explain why it only appeared at the one crime scene.
“Neville. How the fuck does Neville, of all people, play into this?”
Finally, we settle in for storytime.  I start with Babbitty Rabbity because it’s a classic, and it was my favorite as a child.  I try my best to do the same voices I always do, but my voice cracks a few times and ruins the effect.
Today we woke up together at the ungodly hour of sunrise because that’s when Harry likes to go for a run.  I usually sleep through it, but today I was up.
“But if people thought long and hard about getting married and no longer needed divorces, your papa wouldn’t have a job anymore, would he?” Harry quietly refrained from pointing out that Draco was a huge hypocrite if he was advising people not to get married to the wrong person. He didn’t think antagonizing a five-year old about his parents’ horrible divorce was a great idea, especially when Harry desperately needed said five-year-old’s father’s help with his own divorce.
Harry continued to listen as Malfoy talked about people not brewing their own potions anymore. It was interesting to think about—Harry himself relied heavily on apothecaries for his potions since he’d never learned anything about them. He’d never considered that if he’d had a better education on the subject, he might have been able to brew his own cure for boils or Pepper-Up.
“You found a wing, Papa!” he exclaimed, clapping his hands together. “I think we have enough pieces now!”
Draco groaned.
Harry felt his heart pound as Draco looked up at him. His grey eyes looked as terrified as the last time Harry had seen them, and it was bringing back some unpleasant memories. Memories that reminded him of another key fact—Draco had been arrested last time Harry had seen him.
"Mal-dues," Harry tried. Hassan shrugged and nodded, which Harry took to mean good enough.
Trying to push thoughts of Laura out of his head, he offered Camilla his arm, and they walked through the village to the restaurant together, Camilla telling him an adorable story of two children who had come to her stall during the day. They had just reached the restaurant, where the host was waiting to greet them at the door, when two pops of apparation sounded next to them.
“And I resent ever agreeing to play on a team where you were keeper,” Teddy retaliated.
“Oh, Harry. I was just teasing. We’ve only been on a few dates, there’s no rush to tell anyone.”
She smiled at that, and he gestured to the ground next to him. She sat down and started rummaging through her bag, before pulling out a small box of pastries.
“Healer Malfoy!”
At the thought of Teddy and Scorpius having to go through what Harry and Draco had lived through in their childhoods, Harry lost control, and a window shattered. Teddy jumped, his explanation of the ideal angle of the moon coming to an abrupt halt as Harry stood up again.
"Beautiful," she repeated. "Like, err, preetee?"
“Yeah, you should get going. Thanks for being there for me. Coming to the pub to meet my friends, and then sitting with me while I started panicking about my job. You really are a great guy.”
Ron snorted. “You can easily contact anyone we went to school with and ask them out on a date if you’re interested. So why haven’t you?”
He was not expecting his boyfriend to spit his wine out at that. Honestly, it sounded like a great idea to Draco.
treat.”
“Er, Scorpius asked me to come… um, to heat up a casserole.” Merlin, he sounded stupid even to his own ears.
“I’m surprised you’re asking that. You’re a Healer, not an Auror.”
He shot a gentle smile at the receptionist, who smiled back shyly. “I’ll take it from here, Carly, thank you.” He gestured for Potter to follow him off to the side.
"Thanks," Harry said, returning his handshake. "For everything."
“Oh, it’s you,” Draco sighed, barely glancing up at Harry. “Have a seat, we’ll go over the final documents in a moment.”
“Madame Pomfrey wants me there as soon as possible. I’ll stay in touch with whoever replaces me for a while, just to help transfer all my responsibilities, but the change is going to be pretty much immediate.”
"It... yeah. It got to all of us. Um, how about we try to find some breakfast? I doubt we'll have any hangover potion here."
“Yes, and just as my second case was coming in too. It’s honestly becoming a nuisance.”
“You—what? But you love healing! As much as you’ve always talked in circles about your job, it’s still been clear how passionate you are about being a Healer.”
“I brought you lunch, since you gave yours to Teddy. I didn’t want you to be hungry.”
"You should be getting to sleep soon. Tomorrow will be a big day."
“Gross!” Scorpius laughed, swatting his cousin. Teddy replaced his mouth and started laughing too.
“He’s never seen a play. Not a full one anyways. He talks too much, it disturbs everyone else.”
“That’s not what he meant,” Ginny groaned, but Hermione interrupted.
menu sticking out from behind the second page. He’d been perusing it yesterday, hoping to decide in advance what to order on his date with Malfoy. The less he had to focus on the date, the more attention he could put into questioning Malfoy.
Draco had returned to brewing illicit potions. Brewing
“Did you just call me Grandpa?” Harry demanded playfully.
“Yeah. The magic involved was a little different from the first patient I treated since this is an adult, but overall things have been going smoothly.”
Scorpius hesitated. He’d been trying not to get his hopes up, but if they could bring the case to the Wizengamot and get his sentence reduced…
To that end, I'll attend the Gala with you next weekend. I'm almost scared to ask though - what do you mean we'll have to prepare? It's just going to be another boring event, the only preparation we need to do is to iron the most stuffy dress robes we have and find a way to hide that bottle of Ogden's of yours inside them. Right?
“I’m drawing a picture of what my wedding is going to look like!” he said excitedly.
Everyone nodded in agreement. They stood around for another moment, before Harry’s stomach rumbled again.
Draco shrugged. "I don't question people's motives. Now, Camilla said she understands your situation, and luckily their church community believes in the dissolution of marriages. It's not a very traditional church community, I was hard put to find some of the necessary information. The point though, is that she's agreed to a 'divorce'. Of course, since you weren't legally married, it's not a legal divorce, but this will stop her from trying to come after you and claim that you used her or some such nonsense."
“It’s not quite that far back. I don’t know how to describe it.” Harry was hoping that a confusing description would make it harder for Malfoy to see right through his lie, but he was starting to get the feeling that he hadn’t quite thought this through. It was just starting to occur to him that he would probably have to show Malfoy his arse if he didn’t want to admit that this was all a farce. Merlin, he was an idiot. Why couldn’t he have listened to Hermione?
“You sound like you have a really sad story about your parents. Did you fall out with them or something?”
“We’re heading out,” he announced, pulling Draco up with him. The Weasley girl wolf-whistled, and Draco was sure he and Harry had identical blushes.
“And the hair?”
"It's a thing here, you can get married at pretty much any chapel on the street. People come here to elope all the time," Bryan explained. "It's one of the things Vegas is famous for. I just don't know what we're gonna do now."
Draco nodded, seemingly reassured by Teddy’s words. He stood shakily, leaning on Adella’s arm. When he was finally upright, she counted them down and apparated away, leaving Scorpius and Teddy alone in the courtroom.
issue?” Malfoy prompted.
"Thank you," he said, not paying her anymore attention as he made his way over to the desk. He was just opening the drawer when something else occurred to him.
already reported on what happened. Anyone who thinks about it long enough would come up with the same conclusions.”
Harry shook his head sheepishly.
“And miss a chance to see you?” Draco protested, hoping he sounded seductive. He’d never thought of himself as a very flirty person, but something about talking to Harry made him want to constantly flatter him. It seemed to be having the desired effect though—every time he said something flirty, Harry developed a lovely little blush.
As it turned out, he hadn’t. In fact, Draco had asked him over lunch, exactly what had Scorpius so out of sorts.
“And you will find it Harry. I know you’re feeling down on yourself because none of your marriages worked out. I know it seems a little hopeless, like no one will ever love you. But that’s not true.”
“You know I could technically refuse you both entry,” Agent Delta mumbled, unlocking the office door and letting them both in. Agent Phi snorted as the pair settled on the couch, while Agent Delta took a seat at their desk.
The sound of the floo drew him out of his thoughts. Scorpius stepped out of the hearth and mumbled a distracted “hi Papa”. He walked past the couch and was halfway to the bedroom when he did a double take, finally noticing that Harry was there.
“Merlin, who would have guessed back then,” Neville said jovially. “That Harry’s obsession with Malfoy was actually because he fancied him?”
It wasn’t long before he found that he was really enjoying himself. The camels moved fast enough, and were tall enough as well, that if he closed his eyes (which he quickly found out was not a smart thing to do) it almost felt like he was taking a leisurely fly on a broom. He found himself wondering when exactly the last time was that he’d been on a broom. It felt like it had been ages. As they returned to the main camp, he was still thinking about what had now become a resolution to start flying again when he returned home. He’d had the brilliant idea of inviting Draco and Scorpius, and was still imagining teaching the young boy to fly, when the sound of a commotion reached his ears. He looked around and was surprised to see Daneri arguing with one of the tribe’s elders. He had just taken in the scene, when he felt a hand on his shoulders.
Finally, Draco decided to return home, scared that he would never see his friend again. But when he got there, there was a wonderful surprise waiting for him. Harry had come home too, and was waiting for him!”
As he led Scorpius inside, Mr. Taber continued rambling on about the annoyance of having Aurors show up at his door every other night insisting that he was being assaulted or robbed.
Harry burst out laughing at that, and Draco soon joined in.
“Oh, are you guys heading out too?”
The next week was incredibly busy, but also a lot of fun. Harry woke up early with the rest of the family every day and had breakfast with them. He and Camilla would then go into her father's workshop and load up the toys he'd made the previous day, before carrying them over to the shop and opening for the day. He spent most of the day with her in the shop, helping her clean and playing with the children who visited.
“You do not. The only
Draco stared at him for a full ten seconds before he burst out laughing.
Harry glanced into the hall to find Scorpius stepping out of the floo.
“Or maybe you’re just a Muggle snob,” Potter accused.
“I may as well try Scorpius’ cooking, since I’m here,” he said casually. He turned to take the casserole out of the oven, and soon he was sitting across from Draco, eating the most bland casserole he’d ever had the misfortune of tasting in his life. He tried to glance around covertly, wondering where he might find salt and pepper, or some type of sauce to liven up what was clearly boiled broccoli baked in a flavourless bechamel sauce.
“Clearly I wasn’t thinking fast enough,” his Papa sighed. “If I hadn’t been such an idiot, I might have… we might not have lost the past fifteen years.” Scorpius was alarmed to see another tear rolling down his cheek, and rushed to comfort him.
“Dad doesn’t know you were released,” he admitted. “In fact, he doesn’t even know that your case was reopened. He’s still pretty angry.”
Ginny and Harry glanced at each other and rolled their eyes. Head Auror Ronald Weasley wouldn’t have taken someone to St Mungo’s if they were a victim of a Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes prank—it was an open secret that he did development for them in his spare time, and was quite familiar with all of their products.
As they sat down at the table, Harry held out Camilla's chair for her, which earned her father a glare from her mother. Harry glanced around and was relieved to see that the restaurant was as nice from the inside as it was from the outside. He took a moment to wonder why he was so worried about impressing this girl and her family when they'd only met a couple of days ago, but pushed it out of his mind. She seemed sweet, and he enjoyed doing nice things with friends.
Shit. He hadn’t meant to tell anyone that he had already been married
Aside from his second date with Harry, he hadn’t flown in ages. Truth be told, it was a little boring on one’s own. He had been riveted by the thrill of chasing a Snitch and racing Harry around the countryside that day, and was longing to do it again.
“Just long,” Ron sighed. “I technically shouldn’t tell you guys, but it’s gonna be all over the
Harry rolled his eyes. “I can’t imagine where he gets it from,” he groused. Draco smiled at that, and the sight made Harry’s heart ache for the years they could have had. Not wanting to dwell on the what-ifs, he turned back to the main room. He made his way over to the fridge, and was surprised to find that it was now covered in photographs. Pictures of Scorpius and Teddy racing on their brooms, opening presents on Christmas morning, each of their graduations, Scorpius’ first day as an Auror—all the special memories of the last 15 years had found their way onto the fridge. Harry couldn’t help smiling at the collection of memories, the sight of Teddy and Scorpius waving happily at the camera in every one.
“It’s pretty lame,” Harry admitted. “I hadn’t really been exposed to arithmetic growing up, but when Hermione taught it to me after the war, I really started to enjoy it, which is why I handle a lot of our office’s financial auditing.”
“Why don’t you just ask the staff?”
“It’s a long story.”
The pregnant wizard smirked.  "I assume that will be in a second book?"
“I feel awful for leaving you,” Draco said after a few minutes of silence. “But I really do need to get to the hospital.”
Draco was both surprised and not to step out into an entirely unfamiliar house. In the first few days after his release, Scorpius had told him that Harry had changed a lot in what had once been
“How old are you guys then?” Harry demanded. “I know you three graduated recently, so you can’t be more than 20, but the rest?”
"My goodness Harry, you got a boardroom and catering just for our meeting?" Draco asked, finally realising where they were.
“I did. I consulted with her on the Transfiguration attacks, and she happened to mention that Madame Pomfrey is retiring. It seems Hogwarts is looking for a new Healer to manage the Hospital Wing.”
He had to get to the hospital and check on Goldhorn, but he was also itching to figure this case out. Worrying Harry with his suspicions probably wasn’t the right way to go right now. He had to calm him down.
Scorpius nodded, glancing over his shoulder. Harry could hear a lot of background noise.
“Well, I had two ideas. Maybe you can help me pick?” When Scorpius nodded eagerly, Harry continued. “My first idea was that we could go for a ride on a cable car. It’s like a small train that muggles built to take them around the city.”
“That’s… Merlin, I don’t know what that is but… oh my. I guess I’m glad for him.”
"It actually makes a fair amount of sense. She wants you to pay for her to go to University for two years. She said that once news gets out that you two aren't married anymore, her community will gossip a lot about it, and she said she wouldn't be able to handle it. She wants to go away until it dies down, and for her, that means going to university."
“None of that cafeteria shit, we’re going across the street for pad thai.”
Harry was silent for a moment, before nodding.
I’d say I’m worried about going too far, but I don’t think I have. This feels right to me. I hope you feel the same.
I finally manage to get him out of a wrongful conviction only to find that his health is awful! I spent years begging for closure, or reassurance, and I got
Scorpius nodded. He hoped he wouldn’t end up this lonely. He frowned as his thoughts strayed to his dad, who had been single for so long. Of course, he’d been raising Scorpius to keep himself busy (and even Scorpius could admit he hadn’t made that easy), but now that he was an adult, Scorpius didn’t need Harry tending to him at all hours of the day. He was starting to realise that he didn’t even know what his dad did all day.
“So did they finally figure out how to help her?” Hermione asked. “Luna’s right that it’s an incredibly difficult piece of magic to cast an attack like that. Transfiguring her back into a human must have been just as challenging.”
“Because she thought you were going to marry her?” Draco asked uncertainly. Harry shook his head, feeling glum.
his regular-wear cloak wasn’t nearly as warm.
"Just a little.. ah, sore," he mumbled. Bryan also blushed at that, and Draco's confused expression twisted into one of horror.
After reassuring his dad he’d be home in time for dinner and seeing him out to the elevator, Scorpius turned back to the folders on his desk. His first order of priority was to read the transcripts from the trials and the various interrogations with Silverthorn. Contrary to his father, Silverthorn had had an army of lawyers defending him, and the trial had dragged on forever. There had been multiple Aurors and prosecutors involved, and he’d also had many more charges brought up against him. Thankfully that bit helped him filter what to read. His father hadn’t been involved in the potions smuggling, fraud or corruption, which eliminated 2 of the folders. Unfortunately for Scorpius, the crime of murdering the Minister for Magic was complex, especially since the prosecutors had pushed for a charge of terrorism, which usually involved the input of the International Confederation of Wizards.
Bryan was silent for just long enough that Harry felt guilty for putting a damper on what was supposed to be a fun afternoon. Then, the arm on his shoulder tightened, and pulled him into a sideways hug.
Draco had suspected as much but it helped to know McGonagall agreed.
Draco prayed to Merlin, Morgana, Circe and Salazar that he wasn’t blushing too hard. It was fairly obvious on his pale skin. It didn’t seem to matter, though, because Potter went beet red.
"Hello Harry," Draco greeted as he stepped into the room behind his son. "And you are?"
“Can I help you?” he asked, peering suspiciously at Scorpius.
After a week in the city, Harry had visited most of the destinations on his itinerary and could quite proudly say that he now knew his way around Oslo very well. He was slated to spend another week here and then head back to England, but the travel agent had said that he could easily extend his trip if he wanted to. He sent out a couple of international owls, one to the travel agent to ask him to rebook the hotel up north for another two weeks, and another to Hermione and Ron, to let them know where he was and how he was doing. Satisfied that he had seen as much of the city as he wanted (and anyways, he would have to come back here for his international portkey home whenever he decided to leave), he packed his bags and hopped on a train headed right back up north.
Scropius smiled, but Harry could see exhaustion written all over his face.
Scorpius did not expect the resigned acceptance that took over his father’s face. He remembered a papa who always used to push his dad’s buttons, who used to argue and debate everything they talked about. Simply accepting that the man he loved was angry with him did not seem like the kind of thing he would do.
“Draco, what…”
His dad nodded, contemplating his food. They continued to eat in silence for a bit, until his dad brought up the topic of Quidditch. The evening progressed pretty normally from there, but Scorpius couldn’t help thinking about the fact that his dad had been more receptive to talking about Draco. In fact, he’d seemed almost curious. He wondered as he made his way home that night if maybe he should bring up the topic more often. It was still an awkward subject, but maybe with time, it wouldn’t be.
“That sounds like a good idea,” Harry agreed. “Draco and I were actually talking about your work today.”
They kept up this awkward dance for just over a week. Finally, it was Harry who broached the subject.
Harry nearly spilled coffee all over himself when Scorpius’ head popped into the floo. Now that he no longer had Scorpius bustling around in the mornings while getting ready for work, Harry had been getting used to his mornings being slow and quiet.
Over the past few months, Harry and Scorpius had spent many days together, shopping for and decorating the empty apartment. Harry had originally invited him as a way to take him off of Draco’s hands for a while, but as the weeks turned into months, his relationship with both Malfoys had bloomed. Harry now had a very cheerful and well thought out apartment that he was sure Scorpius considered to be a second home by now. Draco had already mentioned that he was looking for a place in London, since the Manor was inconveniently far from both Scorpius’ charms school and his office. Harry had finally gone out last night and made a second copy of the key to the apartment, and had wrapped it carefully in golden paper, along with three other gifts: a poker chip he’d nicked from a casino in Vegas, a string of beads he’d brought back from Chad, and the extra love spoon he’d bought in Norway all those months ago. Since their return from San Francisco, Draco had been helping him understand that all these symbols for love didn’t have to end in marriage. They were just more ways that humans had come up with for expressing their love, and they were all beautiful in their own way. While Harry wasn’t sure if he ever wanted to get married again, he was planning to ask Draco to move in with him after Scorpius went to bed tonight.
“And Warren!” Harry blustered on. “I interviewed him for my review. He loves his job—he’s the head of CRUP, Creature Response in Urban Populations. He and his team respond to wild creatures when they wander into wizarding settlements. But since urban planning in the magical community has become more sustainable recently, there are fewer creatures wandering into shops and Quidditch pitches. He’s usually the one the Aurors call when there’s a dangerous creature in Diagon Alley, or in someone’s backyard. I wanted them to reassign him to the Veterinary Care team—he has a glowing recommendation from McGonagall on his Transfiguration NEWT—but he never did well enough in Potions, so they had to demote him instead.”
"Yay, we can be friends too!"
“Man, you are old,” Jackie chuckled, causing everyone else to laugh. “Why did we all think you were 23?”
"Can we go swimming?" Scorpius asked. "It's really hot here, and when it's hot, you're supposed to go swimming."
“Wait, that’s why I saw you going into the Department of Mysteries!”
“That makes a lot of sense,” Draco muttered, turning to wave at Scorpius.
“Yeah. You’ve been quite busy lately, haven’t you? Draco told me you’ve been stressed out, and you always look exhausted.”
“Oh that’s okay,” Harry said, waving away Draco’s concerns and standing up. “How long do you have? We should eat, so that you don’t go back to work hungry.”
The ribbing and teasing continued throughout the night, but it was just good natured fun. At one point Ron started a trend of calling a toast for Harry and Draco every time a new round was bought (his favourite was “To Draco finally catching the Snitch for once in his life!”, which had caused Draco to pretend to pout for a few minutes), and it wasn’t long before the toasts started becoming increasingly ridiculous. Harry was used to such an atmosphere, however, and Draco seemed to be enjoying himself. Harry felt a sense of calm wash over him as he realised that everything was going his way. It felt
"Can I help?" Scorpius asked excitedly. "I can come over and see it and then draw a plan for you!"
For the first time in ages, Draco fell asleep smiling.
“Fish, Scorpius, not fishes. Where do you see fish?” Draco asked, cocking his head at the wall. It appeared to be a mural of enormous flowers in a field, but after a moment of looking, Harry saw it. Getting closer to the wall, he could see that each flower was made of a bunch of smaller images, and the one right in front of them was made of small little fish.
“Oh, don’t worry,” Harry said, standing up as well. “Go ahead and take care of your patient.”
Harry nodded, still chuckling. Meeting at dinner would give him time to go back to the hostel and grab his stuff, too. He watched Draco and Scorpius disappear down the hall, before making his way up to his own room. He changed quickly and disapparated back to the hostel. Thankfully, all his stuff was mostly packed, so he was able to just grab his rucksack and go. He was just checking out at the front desk when he heard a familiar voice behind him.
“I don’t think so. I think he knows that this arrangement can’t continue forever. It’ll probably reassure him to know that you’re not sitting here all alone every day.” Harry didn’t tell Draco the other reason he was sure Scorpius would agree—taking care of Draco would be Harry’s way of making up for all those years when he didn’t fight for him. He was sure that would be symbolic to Scorpius in some way, and even if it wasn’t, it was important to Harry.
The other room in the back of the house was clearly Hassan's, but with the door closed, Harry couldn't tell what it looked like. Once Harry had deposited his things in the room and freshened up, he met his host in the front of the house.
“We got to talk about you a bit,” Draco explained gently. “I couldn’t help telling him about a bit of your past, and it became a rather emotional experience. I’m sorry, I know it wasn’t my place, but—”
He wandered back into the living room, wondering if his suspicions about Draco these days were just a leftover product of their childhood rivalry. Was he just so used to being wary of Draco’s actions that he couldn’t believe the man was innocent anymore? Harry didn’t like the idea that he was becoming a suspicious old fart—he wasn’t even 30, for Merlin’s sake. Hermione was probably right that he had a perfectly reasonable reason for visiting the Department of Mysteries that day. He really should learn to just give Draco the benefit of the doubt.
“Go away!” he moaned. He had thought he’d been responsible last night and not drunk too much, but the pounding in his head said otherwise. Unfortunately, the knocking continued.
Draco considered him for a moment.
Harrison approached the evidence bench and handed the duty Auror a plastic sleeve containing the two pictures found in the journal. Scorpius watched anxiously as the Auror projected an image of each side of the sleeve, so that the entire Wizengamot could see it at once. Scorpius normally felt proud whenever he saw evidence he’d collected being displayed like this, knowing that he was contributing to justice. But all he could feel in the moment was the worry clawing at his heart.
Putting on a sad expression, Harry flapped his way to the side of the stage, leaving a sad looking Draco standing behind.
“I know Scorpius is busy, and he doesn’t really have time to find other recipes that won’t make you sick,” Harry said, suddenly feeling the need to justify himself. “But if you keep eating the same thing day after day, there’s no way you’re going to regain your strength.”
"Harry!" came Scorpius' greeting as Harry stepped into Draco's outer office once more. "You're back! Did you bring me a present?"
“What’s all that?” Draco asked, making his way over to the kitchen island. Their lunches were still a little awkward at times, but they had gotten better at navigating conversations with each other, talking mostly about Scorpius and Teddy. Draco never seemed to tire of hearing about the boys, and Harry was only too happy to indulge in trips down memory lane.
“I still want to know how you guys went from hexing each other over Quidditch rivalries to this,” Ron said, with a general wave in their direction.
Scorpius nodded, knowing there was no point arguing with her. He stood up, stretching a bit, before deciding to head downstairs and see if Teddy was busy.
“So lunch is on you then?” Millie smirked. Draco laughed outright at that.
Teddy’s eyes widened. “So they threatened Draco?”
“Hey Harry, sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could check on Draco at lunch again today? I just got another request for a potion that has to be watched all day, and Scorp is on emergency duty again.”
“I want to tell him the truth. I don’t want to be lying to him anymore. Unspeakables… we don’t usually have relationships. And if we do, it’s usually with other Unspeakables. I’ve thought about trying to recruit Harry to the department, but he wouldn’t want that. But if I tell him, doesn’t that create a precedent, that all Unspeakables can tell their significant other about their work?”
This set up the family for another little bout of rapid conversation, in which it seemed like Camilla was once again at odds with her father.
of Harry as his ex), he gestured to the room around them.
“Yup. And I think I’m going to have to read them all,” Scorpius sighed.
Scorpius’ jaw dropped. “He—really? What…?”
, and I
“Well, yeah. I need someone who won’t go running straight to the
After giving Draco the details of the hotel, which he'd found on a flyer on the coffee table, Harry ended the call and turned back to Bryan, who was still sitting on the bed, staring at the paper.
“Of course not. Honestly, it seems like an exhausting career.”
“I appreciate the offer, Millie, and I do wish I could have worked with you. But potions isn’t my calling. It never has been.”
The next few days were repeated in a similar way, though now that the Yaake was over, Harry found himself being invited to participate in various games and competitions, clearly designed to showcase the men’s intelligence and strength. Harry had been pleased to find that he could generally keep up with many of the puzzles that were offered, since he’d often wondered is everything he’d accomplished in life was the result of luck.
“What is going on here?” Malfoy asked, lifting an eyebrow and glancing curiously at Harry before turning his attention to the receptionist.
Harry shook his head. He'd only had a few drinks all day.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, leading him off the dance floor. “I didn’t mean to startle you, I just wanted to reply to the couple who wished us a goodnight as they passed us.”
There was a series of gasps and shocked muttering at that. Scorpius had read in his history books that many of the Death Eaters tried immediately after the great war had not received legal advice, either because they’d had difficulty in finding someone willing to represent them, or because of the negligence of the Aurors processing them. These days, however, anyone coming to trial without a legal advocate, no matter how heinous the crime, was unheard of.
“I know. That’s why I wanted to see you all today. Once we’re done here, I’m going to end the lease on my apartment, and I’m meeting Teddy and Andromeda for dinner. Then I’m on the first Portkey out tomorrow morning. I’ll do all my shopping tomorrow when I get to France, since no one knows me there and therefore won’t kick me out of the shops, but at least I won’t have to sell your beautiful outfits.”
“What’s the stitch, doc?” Teddy teased. Adella rolled her eyes at him and wrapped up her diagnostic spells.
“Why are you requesting an appointment with me, Potter? I’m sure you already have an assigned General Healer.”
do all day? What does a day in the life of Draco Malfoy look like?”
What was really interesting to him, however, was the personal notes or comments Draco had left about his daily life. Every so often Scorpius found a little grocery list, or a reminder on the corners of the pages, such as “Ministry Gala tonight” or “mow lawn this weekend”.
“Wait, are you both leaving? Are you going together?” Carol asked, clearly excited at the love story she imagined must be unfolding between them.
“I’m so glad you were both able to join me,” Harry said, leaning back against the pillows. “All my travels so far have been great, but San Francisco has been the best trip so far.”
"I don't understand your language," he replied, trying to remain calm. He knew from experience that yelling was not going to help. "You didn't say it in English. I'm sorry, I didn't know!"
"Come on," he said, giving Harry a look that... oh. Blushing furiously, now that he understood what Bryan wanted, Harry took his hand and allowed himself to be led out onto the dance floor. He was being oddly bold, but that was probably because of the alcohol and his loosened inhibitions. They found a small gap in the crowd and squeezed into it, pressed up close to each other. Harry could feel every single one of Bryan's movements as their chests and their hips moved together. The music continued to pound around them, but Harry found himself getting lost in the feeling of the hand on his hip, or the other one on his back. He looked up into Bryan's eyes and was stunned to see a heat that he felt reflected in his own heart.
“I… yes, I’d be honoured! What do you need from me? A resume? Statement of intent? References? We can schedule a formal interview at your convenience as well.”
“I never thought I was,” Draco admitted. “But I haven’t been able to find any other jobs, so I thought I’d give it a try.” He ignored Harry’s frown at the mention of the blatant discrimination he still faced every day as an ex-death eater.
Making a quick stop at Magorian’s Toy Emporium to buy Teddy a gift simply because he could, and a bottle of wine for his Aunt, he made his way down to the Leaky Cauldron and flooed to Andromeda’s place. He’d offered to take them to Teddy’s burger place, but she’d written back saying she didn’t want him to get into the habit of eating out so often, especially since he was going to stay with Harry next week and would probably be eating take-out every night.
“Well, Teddy identified it for me. He’s also the one who figured out what the modifications were. That was quick thinking on your part,” he added. Scorpius knew from his career how tricky it could be to improvise under pressure. Modifying such a complicated potion would have taken a lot of concentration.
“Potter,” Draco said, stepping out from around the corner. “We’ve made it clear that I don’t take general appointments. Why do you insist on pestering the poor reception staff?”
“Very well. The court hearby rescinds the charge of attempted terrorism. As Chief Warlock, my recommendation is that the accused’s sentence be commuted to 15 years.”
"Hey, you okay?" Harry asked. He seemed to have calmed down a bit, but Harry didn't want to make assumptions.
“Scorpius…” Head Auror Clearwater seemed hesitant about what she was going to say, but Scorpius watched her patiently, waiting eagerly for her next suggestion. A sense of relief was flooding through him—he’d been right! His father wasn’t a criminal!
Night of summer stars
Harry was touched that his friends cared enough about his boyfriend to get him a gift. It struck Harry that he should probably get Draco a congratulations gift as well. Curious as to what that could look like, he leaned over as Draco opened the box.
“Common sense is uncommon in common people,” Agent Eta pointed out. “How did you suddenly get all the information you gave us? Selpie wasn’t listed in the records I gave you.”
“This dragon walks on two legs, like a human. The extra leg is just there for balance, like when he lands from flying.”
“Watch carefully, Scorp. You have to do it the way I do it so that you don’t get hurt. I’ll go first, and wait to catch you at the bottom.”
Draco nodded. "Looks about right. Open it up and we can go over the last few changes together."
Draco was hard put to keep from laughing. As if anyone in this blasted hospital would make him a supervisor. Though when he really thought about it, he was
“I’m sorry, Harry,” he said immediately. “We didn’t mean to bot—”
Draco sighed. “I just… they’re not labelled. That yellow soup looks like it could be butternut squash, but it also looks like it could be broccoli-cheddar. I don’t like drinking the sharp taste of cheddar, but the sweetness of squash would be very welcome right now.”
Draco was greeted by sheer noise as he stepped into the Bronze Head Tavern. He would have preferred a more quiet place for their discussion, but he was quite sure he was no longer welcome in either The Three Broomsticks or The Hog’s Head. Trying not to dwell on that, he made his way over to a booth in the back where McGonagall was already sipping on a Gurdyroot infusion.
Harry sighed, reaching out to take her hand in his.
“Here!” Scorpius called out, jumping up from his chair and point at Harry and Draco on either side of him. Draco hissed at him to sit down, but it was too late -- the wizard in purple robes had spotted them.
“Unfortunately no. The victim is always alone when it happens, and neither of them remember anything. It’s definitely someone who knows a lot about creatures though.”
“Watching Harry grow up taught me to never discount luck, both good and bad,” McGonagall mused. “I suggest you do the same, since you’re now dating him.”
Not only were things going well at home, Scorpius also felt confident about the journal he’d found. He was sure it would contain some kind of clue, and so he sat down to read through it first thing in the morning.
“Do you think you can free Draco?”
“Paperwork sucks,” Scorpius agreed. “I’d offer to help, but I’d definitely be more of a hindrance than a help.”
“On the contrary, I think it’s part of why I like you so much.”
Satisfied with his own plan, Harry shed his coat, marched into the kitchen, and got to work.
Right on cue, a curious face poked around the side of the sofa, and Scorpius’ face split into a wide grin.
It was fascinating, to say the least. The entire journal seemed to be centered around one batch of polyjuice potion. Scorpius recognised the generally approved steps taught in NEWT classes, but surrounding them were a bunch of additions, corrections and changes that he’d never before heard of. There were also a bunch of numbers in the margins, and while Scorpius prided himself on his arithmetic skills, he could not find any pattern or meaning in them.
They finished eating and cleaned up the kitchen, before heading into the bedroom to pack Draco’s things. It turned out that he only had a few sets of clothes, his toiletries, and a small collection of books—everything else that he used belonged to Scorpius.
“He looked ill,” his dad finally said. It sounded like a statement, but Scorpius heard the concerned question underneath.
“I’m going to America,” Harry said happily. “Where the national language is English, and there can’t be any miscommunications.”
“Yeah, no thanks to Linda,” he groused, though the smile he offered her conveyed that he wasn’t actually mad.
They’re dripping wet (and not from sex),
Scorpius barely even heard the gavel bang, or the chatter of the Wizengamot members filing out of the courtroom. He turned to look at his father, who was still staring up at the Chief Warlock as if he couldn’t believe what was happening. Harrison looked like she was about to say something to him, but she suddenly straightened up and waved Scorpius over. Not needing to be told twice, he raced down to where they were seated, Teddy close behind him.
“We will,” Harry assured her, before gesturing toward a nearby sofa. He watched as Bryan marched over and slumped gracelessly onto the sofa.
Right down Ferret’s trousers on this lovely
He hesitated, wondering if his dad would be upset at the extent of Teddy’s role in keeping this from him. He knew, however, that his dad would be much more upset if he found out that Scorpius was still keeping the truth from him.
"Can we papa! Can we find dragon bones?"
“How may I help you?” the receptionist asked. Harry handed him the letter.
"Um, my parents left me enough when they died." He didn't want to reveal that he was rather wealthy quite yet—he found people always treated him differently for it. Her eyes went wide at his statement however, and he realised with a start that while he may have made peace with the fact that his parents were gone many years ago, it was still jarring for strangers when he told them about it.
Mr. Taber looked up at Scorpius, confused at first, but then it dawned on him. They stared at each other for a moment before they both burst out laughing.
“It only needs one wing, Harry,” Scorpius sighed, as if this was common knowledge. “Two wings just makes it faster, but sometimes it’s okay not to be the fastest.”
"I'm really sorry, we don't have any spare pieces that aren't buried. I do have some papers and markers if you would like to draw some dragons?"
Draco sighed. “I agree that spells and potions don’t work. True love is a power that’s a little too difficult to be duped by simple magic. But it’s there. The dragons can feel it, and I’m sure to a certain extent, so can we.”
manner?”
Norway was beautiful. Many people had told him as much, but as Harry sat on the edge of the lake, waiting to watch the midnight sunset for the third time in as many days, he realised that hearing about it and seeing it were two entirely different things. In the week he'd been here, he'd already finished an entire roll of film for his camera, taking pictures of the lake, the wildlife, various plants, his kayaking expedition yesterday, and his adventures through the market this morning.
Olivia somehow managed to look alarmed and curious at the same time. Putting her folder down, she took his, flipping it open to read the header. She bit her lip, and glanced back at her own robbery case, before snapping the goat folder closed and spinning on her heel.
“And how does your dragon fly with only one wing?” Harry asked, holding said wing in place while Scorpius fastened it to the spine.
?” Malfoy didn’t sound like he believed a word of what Harry was saying.
“I didn’t know you were… interested.”
"You didn't," he said slowly. Harry looked up at him guiltily, and could tell from the look on his face that Draco knew exactly what he'd done.
“Oh, have you finally registered with a General Healer?” Hermione asked curiously. “I’ve been reminding you to do that for years.”
"Are there post owls here that I could borrow?"
She nodded. "If sir is needing to send a letter, sir can give it to Pippy or to the reception desk. Pippy will be bringing mail whenever it arrives."
dating, after all. It was probably in his best interest to keep this whole thing a secret. Harry was rather famous, and if it became public knowledge that they were dating, it would become very difficult for Draco to end things.
“Apparently you did. Though considering how many shots Linda convinced you to do last night, I’m not surprised.”
Not only had Draco given in, he’d changed something to foil the criminals. Harry didn’t quite understand that, but it had to do with potions, and no one knew potions better than Teddy. Except, perhaps, Draco…
“Human to animal Transfigurations are a complicated subject. Even most NEWT students don’t learn more than the basic theory. I can only think of one Healer who graduated in the last three decades to whom I’ve taught such advanced Transfiguration.” She gave him a meaningful look.
I apologize. I was a bit drunk and I suppose my alcohol-addled mind really wanted to stick it to the press and conveniently forgot that there were no reporters outside your front door.
Now it was Harry’s turn to blush, confirming what Draco already knew—the house had been redecorated in anger. Not wanting to upset Harry on their first day of living together again, he quickly changed the topic.
After a sleepless night, Harry was nursing a cup of coffee in front of the floo, hoping that Scorpius would call. He startled when the flames flashed green, and for the first time in his life, he was disappointed to see Teddy’s face.
He could see the cogs working in Potter’s brain. Clearly Potter was trying to find information about Draco. Dating him would be the perfect way to not only divert him from the hospital, but also to keep an eye on him and whatever he was investigating. Draco was about to congratulate himself on his brilliant plan when he noticed four Aurors step out of the Floo herding a large animal that he couldn’t see clearly from this angle. This wasn’t going to be good.
“Who?”
“Yeah, it wasn’t a violent attack. Or maybe it was, I don’t know. But no one was
“He did,” Scorpius said slowly. “He ate it for dinner, and for lunch again today.”
Almost as if she could hear his thoughts, Harrison stood up and started asking Teddy questions, in an effort to direct his spiel towards the case, and away from the regional source of Knotgrass. Under Harrison’s guidance, Teddy’s testimony became more concise, and Scorpius was relieved to see many of the members listening attentively, now that the average person could actually understand what he was saying. Within a few concise sentences, Teddy confirmed that the potion in the vial matched Draco’s notes and that the notes had designed a potion that wore off faster.
“Don’t worry,” he told his cousin confidently. “I’ll find something.”
"You gave me love spoon!" she cried, looking hurt. "We prepare all week, how you don't know?"
“Did you really?” Draco asked, sounding both amused and awed. Harry bit his lip, feeling guilty for that. Not only had he witnessed what was probably a very emotional moment for Draco, he’d abandoned Luna in the process. She acted carefree enough that she must have still enjoyed the party, but he knew it had probably still felt awful to be left behind like that.
“As fascinating as this lesson in old Latin words for healing is—”
But this was still his papa. It was still the same platinum blonde hair, the same silver eyes, the same pointed chin. Scorpius found a little thrill in noticing all the ways in which they looked alike. As Adella deposited Draco into the seat next to Harrison, and the court proceeded to interrogate him, Scorpius continued to watch his father. Draco didn’t seem aware that Scorpius was in the room yet. He stared up at the Wizengamot, answering their questions with a scratchy voice that clearly hadn’t been used in years. He wondered how ill his father must be for Adella to be hovering the way she was. While it was standard practice to release someone from Azkaban directly into the care of St. Mungo’s, Healers usually weren’t called in until the release was official.
Hassan beamed with pride at that. He invited Harry to have a seat on the sofa, and they got to talking about local attractions, and what things Harry wanted to do.
Scorpius shrugged. “I guess I had a really good teacher,” he said, giving his dad a playful wink.
“Thank you again, Draco, I really don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“Excellent choice,
Harry smiled at that. His mind suddenly conjured a hilarious image of Draco threatening a five year old girl in much the same way Camilla's father had just threatened him.
Oh. Harry had been worried that his friends were making fun of Draco, but it turned out they were making fun of both of them. That felt more acceptable, and Harry allowed himself to relax.
After the church let out, they made their way to a nearby restaurant, where a good chunk of the community that had been at the church followed them. Lunch (had they really been in the church that long?) was a rowdy affair, with people singing and dancing and toasting all over the place. Camilla, for her part, never left his side, though there always seemed to be someone wanting her attention, and preventing Harry from asking what all the celebration was for. Soon enough, she pulled him into the ruckus to dance as well. Harry rather enjoyed himself, though he was incredibly surprised when she kissed him, right there on the dance floor.  He glanced around nervously, but no one seemed at all bothered by the sight, despite the fact that barely two weeks ago, Camilla's parents had given them pointed coughs when they so much as hugged each other.
Draco wanted to insist that he was fine, but he couldn’t shake the feeling of the attacker’s magical signature. He was anxious to get home and review the guest list for the night, and letting Harry Apparate him would get him there faster.
"Really?" she blurted, finally smiling when Harry nodded.
Draco was still thinking of Scorpius’ favourite salt and vinegar crisps as his whole life went up in flames.
Scorpius nodded, and extricating himself from Harry’s arms, he went and sat down on the sofa. Harry watched as Draco counted while Scorpius took deep breaths in and out. After a few breaths, Scorpius seemed to visibly calm down, and after a few more, he stood up and walked over to Harry again.
“If all else fails, you can try a chafing ointment from any licensed apothecary. You won’t need a prescription for it. Good day, Potter.”
"Ah yes, I hear about it. With flying. You're not scared of flying?"
“Say, now that I think about it, you look familiar,” Smith said suspiciously. “What’s your name? Have we met before?”
Harry barely heard the response—Draco’s voice sounded weak, and scared.
“He what?” she shrieked.
"Will you be okay here?" Harry asked Bryan, who nodded shakily. Harry stared at him a moment longer, but decided to let it go. Bryan was an adult who could use his voice if something was bothering him. Putting it out of his mind, Harry took Scorpius’ hand and led him out to the hotel’s gift shop. They spent a little while picking out colourful trunks and flip flops, before making their way down to the enormous pool.
," he moaned, watching all the other children running around in a giant sandpit, most of them barefoot with the cuffs of their trousers rolled up.
“Yes, I’m pretty sure. And I think he modified the potion to foil their plan too!”
“You would too,” Teddy mumbled after he’d swallowed most of them, “if you’d been up all night working on potions theory.”
“After all the shit I see, all the ridiculous reasons people get married—and yes, I do count myself among the idiots for having married Astoria in the first place—I feel like I need to believe in true love. I need to hold on to that hope that there is someone out there, and that we’re not destined to be lonely and bitter forever. It helps to remind myself that for every ugly marriage I see, there are at least a hundred out there that don’t need my services, and that’s a wonderful thought.”
“Sorry, I’m sure I’m not much fun tonight. I don’t mean to keep losing focus like that.”
"What's wrong, are you okay?"
Draco groaned, throwing his hands up in defeat, but Harry didn't mind Scorpius' questions.
“Good idea! Maybe we should rent an actual pitch, and see how it compares to playing in the orchard at the Burrow.”
“Sounds like you guys are jealous,” Harry teased.
Silverthorn’s files didn’t interest Scorpius nearly as much as his father’s had. Maybe it was because Silverthorn was just another faceless criminal, but by the time the other Aurors started trickling out for their lunch breaks, Scorpius was fed up with the reading in front of him. He turned gratefully to the floo as it chimed, but the incoming case wasn’t difficult to deal with, and within five minutes it had been handed off to MacMillian. Twiddling his thumbs, Scorpius glanced around for something to keep him occupied, before deciding to pick up his father’s journal once again.
I know you’ve had your fair share of headlines written about you—as have I—and I don’t mean to presume to know how you feel; but if we feel the same about it then you are just as tired as I am with it all. The fact that I can’t have tea with a friend or meet for lunch to discuss a new project without being romantically linked to the individual I’m with is utterly exhausting. Lately it feels as though if I breathe too near someone the press thinks we’re shagging. If I’m being really honest, the worst thing is how utterly and completely wrong they have it. It's been such a long time since my last attempt at dating, and I’m extremely reluctant to drag someone else into this circus
“Nah, you have your own work to do. I’m just whinging, but it’ll get done. Speaking of your work, though, did you find anything new today?”
“Well I obviously wouldn’t put too much spice in it. They can taste great with just a little salt and chicken broth mixed in, or a few fresh herbs. Those should be light enough for him.”
"Scorpius, we didn't bring your trunks," Draco sighed. Harry, however, stood up.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted, his tone gentle. “Why are you so intent on becoming a children’s author?”
Berating himself internally for being so awkward, Harry watched Draco walk out of the cafeteria, and counted to ten for good measure, before Vanishing the awful sandwich. He spared a moment to lament the loss of his lunch, before deciding he’d be better off picking something up from literally anywhere else. He’d saved the world—surely he at least deserved a decent sandwich.
“I’d better get back then,” Scorpius said softly, standing up and straightening his trousers. He glanced back at his dad, who was watching him carefully.
Camilla stared at him for a moment before she started laughing. He wasn't sure what was so funny, but waited patiently for her to apparently regain her sanity.
“Yeah, that would be great,” Scorpius agreed. Forgetting who he was talking to for a moment, he added “I’m sure Papa would love to see them too.”
“You don’t.” Agent Phi was nothing if not direct. “You’ve become attached, and frankly, so has he. I know it’s going to hurt, but waiting is only going to make it worse. You need to break up with him.”
“Wait!” Harry called as he watched Draco walking away. He got up and ran over just as Draco turned to look at him in confusion.
Figuring it would take a little longer for a new flat to look lived in, Harry decided to take a look at the bedroom while he was here. He’d imagined his son giving him a tour of his first flat, rather than having to show himself around, but it was interesting to see what Scorpius had chosen for his own home. He’d taken very little from Harry’s house, so Harry had no clue what to expect when he pushed open the bedroom door. Whatever he might have imagined, however, it did not involve Draco sitting on the bed, wrapped in a dark blue throw blanket and reading a book.
"But I don't wanna go to school, Papa!" Scorpius whined. "If I go to school, then I won't see Harry when he comes to visit anymore!"
“Well, Merle just called in sick, and she was supposed to be on emergency duty tomorrow. You want it?”
“We both know I’m neither,” Draco sighed. “I couldn’t get hired as a normal Healer.”
Love,
"It was supposed to be orange and pink," Scorpius said matter-of-factly. "Orange is my favourite colour, and pink is Priscillia's. But my pink crayon broke, so I picked green instead, because it's Papa's favourite colour."
"Oh, no reason," he said quickly, sitting up straight and diverting his eyes. Unfortunately, his gaze landed right on her father, who scowled at him before grumbling something to no one in general.
“I’m guessing from your appearance that things did not go well?” Harry asked tentatively.
"Sorry. American law is very different from British law, it's going to take me a little while to figure out what you guys did and how to reverse it."
supervising.
“Is that why you haven’t dated anyone else since then?” he asked quietly. It hadn’t seemed weird to him until now, but if he was done with Draco, Harry should have started dating other people. His heart felt heavy when Harry nodded.
“This is from Hermione and me,” Ron explained. “Just a little congratulations on your new position.”
“That sounds like a lonely existence,” Scorpius sympathised. Mr. Taber nodded.
That did make sense, but Harry couldn’t help feeling a little guilty about it all the same. They spent a few more minutes discussing details and catching up on the less shocking parts of Harry’s trip. All too soon, the two men were standing and Draco was holding the door open for him.
Draco dragged himself away from the direction his thoughts were taking and tried to focus on what Harry was saying. Clearly he’d been asked a question that he had no answer to.
"Bryan Anderson. Thank you for coming to help us."
Member Pertinger nodded as his wife slumped against him. Clearly they’d been sitting here worrying all night. Instructing them to find a strong cup of tea and get some sleep, Draco headed off to do the same.
who increased the temperature? ‘Mione, I was sweating buckets!”
Scorpius gave him a kind smile. “I’m sorry, I really must be getting back to the office. However, I recommend that you introduce your new crup to your neighbours, so that they’re not worrying about you every time you call him.”
Chuckling to himself about the odd case, Scorpius apparated back to the office. He was eager to get started on the report for this case, sure that he was going to be laughing his head off as he wrote, but he realised that the other case might be important too, and decided to read that folder first.
“I believe my work here is also done,” Harrison said brusquely. “I will take care of the paperwork surrounding Mr. Malfoy’s release, and have the necessary documents owled over to you as soon as I can.”
Teddy frowned at him. “Am I cleared to take this home with me? If so I could probably have it ready first thing in the morning.”
“I don’t know. I thought you would have that info.”
“Thanks for your help, again. I’ll let you know when I get back from America?”
Agent Eta grinned as they handed Agent Delta a pack of Muggle chewing gum. It wasn’t long before the packet had been ripped open and each agent had stuffed two pieces into their mouth. Even secret agents had their vices.
“Oh man, I heard about that. Our history professor mentioned it at school one day, and there was a bit about it in the papers too. Apparently it was a teenager who finally ended everything?”
McGonagall seemed saddened at the mention of her former Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, but her resolve didn’t waver. “I wish she could have stayed. She was an excellent teacher. Just as I’m sure you’re an excellent Healer. Which is why I’m curious about what you might need my help with.”
“So how did you find out that the Hippogriff was actually the girl?”
“Hence why they called the Aurors, Luna,” Dean sighed. “So did you guys catch the culprit?”
Harry’s eyes widened at this information. “Was it really? It was my review that recommended removing a couple of units from Magical Creatures. Oh Merlin, are these attacks my fault?”
Scorpius glanced at the front of each picture again, the pieces suddenly clicking into place.
“You seem distracted,” Harry said thoughtfully. “What were you thinking about?”
"What?" Harry demanded, scooting forward on the bed even though his stomach was turning. He pushed up against Bryan, leaning on his back to read over his shoulder.
Teddy was silently rubbing Harry’s back, but it wasn’t comforting. He shrugged his godson’s hand off and stood up once more.
Feeling much better, Draco tucked into his breakfast, dreaming about all the improvements he was going to make to his life now that he had a bit of money and a steady income to rely on. Unable to hold off, he pulled the transfer form out of the envelope. He was sure Harry would be fair to him, but he wanted to see with his own eyes that he was owed 300 Galleons. He flipped the sheet open as he put a forkful of strawberries into his mouth and promptly started choking.
Thankfully Bryan smiled at that.
The cafeteria didn’t have a very wide variety of foods, but Harry wasn’t picky—he decided on a sandwich and a bag of crisps almost immediately. Draco, however, was a different matter. He hemmed and hawed over the soup selection, before turning his attention to the self-serve salad bar. It wasn’t long before he was back in front of the soup case, however. Harry was surprised at his behaviour—Draco had decided what to eat on their previous dates much more easily.
“He would have been an amazing mentor to Teddy. They should have spent every night for the past fifteen years discussing potions theory. He should have been there for him, and for you.”
“Thanks Dad,” Scorpius said, giving him a quick one armed hug.
!~~~~WIP CRACK~~~~!
“Attention please!” The chatter in the courtroom quieted down as the Chief Warlock stood for opening remarks.
“That’s good then,” Harry said lamely.
," Corner scoffed. "It's all bullshit of course. I doubt it's a real thing. It's supposed to mean that he doesn't want sex, or some similar bullshit. But what 25 year old man doesn't want sex? I think he's just saying it for more attention."
Ignoring the food for the time being, he started to read.
That’s GROSS! EEEEWWW!!”
"Wait Harree! Mama and Pappa say you stay here."
“Yes, you made that clear when you fired Drover.”
“I actually stumbled upon the file by accident,” he admitted. “But once I started reading it, it became clear that something had been very wrong. It took a while to piece the clues together, but I finally managed it.”
"I think you are used to driving on the wrong side of the road?" he said as Harry got out of the car. "We are not driving on the same side as wizards in England."
Draco nodded. “Sorry, I told him not to bother you, but… you know how stubborn he is.”
necessary for his work, however. He couldn’t have Harry snooping around the hospital and finding out that Draco wasn’t really a Healer.
“Let me treat you to dinner, Harry. Next time you can do the asking and it can be
“Oh, sorry ‘Mione. I’ll redo it right away.” He flipped the file open to find a copy of the
Scorpius nodded.
Harry paused his munching at the mention of Malfoy.
“At the beginning, you were dating me because you were looking for information.” Harry paled at that, but Draco pressed on. “I’m not mad, Harry. I just… I want to know. When did you stop spying on me, and when did you start actually liking me? I mean…
Malfoy’s smile turned nostalgic.
He opened it and read the header “Goat under citizen’s arrest, suspected unregistered Animagus and attempted robbery plot,” and closed it with a groan. Verifying whether or not the goat actually was an Animagus was a routine spell, albeit a little difficult since they so rarely got to use it, but the people who had “apprehended” the goat were likely to be full of conspiracy theories and paranoid about every blade of grass they walked on. From his experience, those people often liked to talk a lot, especially to authority figures like an Auror. In fact, it might be easier if this actually was an unregistered Animagus, because then he could arrest the person and bring them back to the Ministry for questioning. But if it turned out to be a regular old goat, he could potentially spend hours convincing these people to let it go.
“They did,” Eta pointed out. “But they couldn’t match it to any records, so the only thing it’ll tell you is that you’re looking at the same assailant in both cases.”
Harry spent the following week wandering around his empty new apartment, trying to figure out how to fill it up. He had never really developped his own personal style. After the war, he’d been living between the Burrow and Grimmauld place, until he’d married Laura and they’d bought their London townhouse. He’d entrusted all the decorating to her then, and as a result, he’d never had the chance to figure out exactly what
Draco nodded, and followed Harry up the stairs. He smiled when Harry didn’t try to take his bag, allowing him to levitate it behind him instead. He didn’t blame Scorpius for not understanding his need for independence—he’d only been a child the last time he’d lived with Draco. Harry, who’d already known about Draco’s stubborn desire to do things for himself, seemed to have an easier time adjusting to it. Draco knew it was a bit of a stupid quirk, but after all the times he’d been left powerless in his life, that little bit of control was reassuring.
“Confused and overwhelmed,” he confirmed. “There’s a lot of reading here, and it’s not all adding up.”
"No one seemed to speak English!" Harry said defensively. "I thought it was some kind of prayer ceremony, they were being so nice!"
Scorpius sighed. “It’s technically not urgent, but…”
Harry was sure that once his anger wore off, he’d agree with Teddy that it had been quick thinking on Draco’s part. But as Teddy babbled on about Salamander blood and lacewing flies, Harry felt his anger surging again as he was reminded that the Minster had died thinking it was Harry who had killed him. They’d used
experimenting with them, based on what was in his journal. For what must have been the millionth time today, Scorpius wondered what use Silverthorn would have had for a modified polyjuice that didn’t last as long as usual.
"Are those meeting rooms available?" he asked, pointing at the glass panelled rooms just off the lobby.
“What if I still have my suspicions that he’s investigating me?”
“How did you know I was assigned those cases?” Malfoy asked, frowning at Harry. “It wasn’t in either of the articles.”
Harry hadn't given him 300 Galleons. He'd given him 300
“They… no, they don’t, really. Usually when someone gets involved in a relationship, they retire from the Department of Mysteries. If their significant other is worth resigning their position for, they can usually be trusted with a broad idea of what the department is doing.”
“Can I interest either of you in dessert?”
“Sorry, I must be tired from work. What were you saying?”
He wandered all the home decoration stores in his area (mostly muggle, since he was still being hounded by the press in wizarding establishments) looking for ideas. He walked through multiple display areas, all of which looked comfortable and inviting, but none of which really
“No, Scorp, it’s fine. I wanted to. I have some sick days banked anyway, I figured I’d take one today. Maybe I’ll go crash at your place, see if Harry’s free. I can pretend to be really sick and get him to cook for me.”
Harry had been expecting this; Ron and Hermione had also thought he was pulling their legs at first. With a sigh, he powered on.
“Good night, Draco.”
“I tried to tell him to stop being so overprotective,” Harry admitted. “But he got angry at that. He’s scared that I’m going to poison you with lentil soup.”
though, and Harry soon found himself out partying every night. He hoped it was just because they were in Las Vegas, a city known for its partying, and that moving on to San Francisco, and eventually across the country to New York city, he’d be able to take advantage of more touristy options that wouldn’t cost him dozens of galleons in hangover potions.
"Krumkake," she said, offering the box to him.
“Well, your papa and I were planning to go out and have some fun. Would you rather get ready and come with us, or would you rather stay here and watch more Telly?”
to Cissy. When I heard she’d moved into the manor, my heart went out to you both.”
went a step too far, I’ve already had my solicitor send them an owl addressing it. You shouldn’t be harangued for attending an event with friends with assumptions and claims such as those.
“Exactly! I was wondering if I should go with house colours, but in a way that feels so childish. I saw a farmhouse theme in a magazine that looked nice, but it seemed a bit weird for a flat in the middle of the city.”
“Scorp, don’t you think you’re being a little overbearing? The poor guy’s probably getting tired of eating unseasoned food every day.”
And among all the pictures Harry had taken over the years was one more, older and more faded than the others. It was the picture he and Scorpius had fought over all those weeks ago, the one of Harry, Draco and Scorpius smiling in the garden together. Harry felt a twinge of guilt as he remembered how rude he’d been to Scorpius about it. It was no wonder Scorpius had been so secretive about Draco’s release—Harry had never really given him any reason to believe he’d be supportive about it.
“He didn’t?” Harry asked, surprised. Teddy nodded.
“They’ll know it was me. They’ll send me to Azkaban.”
"Um, very tasty. Yummy?" he tried, but nothing seemed to ring a bell with her. He rubbed his stomach and made another appreciative noise, and suddenly, she seemed to understand.
Harry smiled as he remembered the wizarding community's morning market. He'd walked past a woman who was selling toys in the morning, when a dancing toy reindeer had caught his eye. Remembering his promise to bring a souvenir back for Scorpius, Harry had decided to purchase it. They had struck up a conversation, and Harry had been surprised to find that it was rather freeing to talk to someone who didn't know his whole history, even if the woman's English was a little broken. She had tried to explain that her family mostly spoke Sami and Norwegian, and eventually she had convinced Harry to join her for lunch, where they'd eaten the most delicious stew. Harry hadn't a hope in the world of being able to pronounce it, but she'd managed to convey that it contained mutton and vegetables, and had even taught Harry a couple of words while they chatted.
They’re groaning and they’re moaning,
“Honestly, me either. I don’t think Smith knew about these though—they should have been catalogued as separate pieces of evidence.”
“Thank you.”
“Did you figure out why the potion was modified the way it was?” Teddy asked. Scorpius shook his head.
“I was thinking I could do a children’s story book,” Draco mused. “Maybe revamp the old
The explanation made sense, but it was another dead end for Harry’s investigation. Not that he’d had any idea how he would have read the contents of the folder anyway.
"Well, congratulations on your freedom, Harry, and have a safe trip."
“A call just came in for a robbery. It's a pretty routine case, but the name on the file… well, it’s my ex. Things ended really awkwardly between us, and I really don’t want to have to go to his place and lift magical signatures. Could you
“Yeah! I wanna go on the train!”
“It’s not that you’re doing a bad job, Scorp. You’ve taken such good care of Draco, and you should know he really appreciates it. But having him come stay with me just makes sense. Your flat isn’t designed for two people, and you have to work all day anyway. If he comes to live with me, Draco won’t have to be alone all day anymore, and you can always come visit whenever you want.”
When visiting hours ended, and Adella kicked them out, Scorpius and Teddy left together. They had just reached the floos, when Teddy spoke up.
He waved his wand at the door to let Bryan in, before stumbling out of bed and looking for his clothes. Bryan sauntered in, already dressed and looking alert, and plopped himself down on the edge of Harry’s bed.
Draco shrugged. “I wasn’t sure. Your friends seem like the type to set you up with the first available person they see.”
Scorpius nodded happily. “It went higher than the Manor! Grandma had to magic more string for it to keep going up!”
Scorpius considered his options for a moment, before Draco cut in.
Harry thought for a moment, then nodded. Draco handed him a sheet of parchment and a quill, and he started to write. Twenty minutes later, and with a fair amount of help from Draco, he had written what seemed to be a suitable apology letter to Camilla. He handed it over, along with the now signed contract, and Draco sealed it in an envelope labelled "Express Portkey Mail".
Harry stood on unsteady feet and made his way over to the small porta-floo the hotel provided. Eternally grateful they'd ended up in a wizarding hotel, and moodily ignoring the warning message of additional charges for international calls, he flooed Draco's office.
Malfoy gave him a small smile. “Exciting isn’t necessarily better,” he pointed out. “Surely you of all people know that.”
Scorpius nodded. "That's a good idea."
At that moment a loud crash sounded from behind Scorpius, who trailed off, looking exhausted. Clearly whatever was going on with the Aurors today was a serious issue.
“Staffing changes? Has someone resigned?”
"Sot gutt," she said, and even though Harry had no idea what it meant, it sounded good, so he smiled back.
“When did it become real for you?” Draco blurted.
“That would be lovely, thank you,” he said, accepting a steaming cup of strong tea as it floated over to him a moment later.
“The Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee had an unusually high post budget this quarter. They probably have staff who are sending and receiving personal mail at the office, but their mail records are such rubbish that we’d never know for sure. That’s my job for this afternoon, to create a usable set of records for their post.”
“I’d like to present an excerpt from an interview with the assassin who took the Minister’s life, as well as another excerpt from an interview with the Minister’s secretary,” Harrison was saying. Scorpius nodded, recognising the interview with the secretary, but his curiosity crept in at the mention of an interview with Silverthorn. He hadn’t gotten that far in the case when it had been handed over to the Head Auror.
“Is everyone okay?” Ginny asked.
After all, why else would he care so much?
“Good idea,” Scorpius said approvingly. Harry turned to shake Draco’s hand.
He was relieved when Harry placed a familiar mug of tea in front of him. The set that these mugs came from had been a wedding gift from Molly Weasley. Clearly Harry hadn’t had the heart to replace a gift from his surrogate mother. Draco’s mood dropped as he thought about the fact that they weren’t married anymore. Scorpius’ lawyer had explained to him that Harry had filed for a divorce all those years ago, and since Draco was incarcerated, the court had approved it on his behalf. He couldn’t help wondering if Harry might be open to the idea of getting married again, now that they would be living together.
“I’m going to go check on the pie,” Harry said suddenly. Scorpius didn’t think much of it until Teddy snorted.
“You can call me Minerva, Draco. You’re an adult now. Have been for a while.”
Draco checked his watch, and realised he did have about half an hour before he needed to make his way to the hospital. He was about to accept Harry’s invitation, when he realised that he shouldn’t be encouraging things. Harry had made it clear tonight how much he cared about Draco. Going over to his place could only make it worse.
“But of course that rat bastard wasn’t present enough in our relationship to understand that. He clearly didn’t give a shit about me.”
“That’s what she said,” Jackie sang, and everyone else snickered. It took Harry a moment to realise how his comment could have sounded dirty, and he couldn’t help joining into the laughter. As everyone else trooped off to help themselves to dessert, he took a moment to wonder if he and his friends had ever been so immature. He figured they would have been, if there hadn’t been a war to fight.
"You joking," she said. Harry shook his head.
“I don’t think
Harry nodded, glancing at Draco as if the answer would be written on his face.
Scorpius wasn't sure if he wanted to know.
Scorpius shook his head. “That’s what’s confusing me. These instructions result in a potion that wears off
“No one asked you,” Bryan mumbled, turning to the counter and slamming his key down. Harry frowned at that.
“I wish I could show him that I’m okay. I really do appreciate everything he’s doing for me, but it’s really stressing him out.”
“I think I’m the oldest, aside from you, and I’m 22,” Jackie said apologetically. “But we’re all just teasing, you do know that, right? It doesn’t really matter how old you are.”
“You thought the first victim might have been a case of revenge, right? Since she was the daughter of a Wizengamot member?”
“How is your patient? I read in the paper that the victim of the second Transfiguration attack is still here.”
Harry nodded. “Instead of a pantry shelf with a cooling charm, they have this box that keeps food cold.”
“How is she?” Mrs Pertinger asked frantically. “Is she going to be okay?”
"Language!" Harry shouted, coming out from around a stack of boxed books with his hands held out.
Before he knew it, dinner was over, the kitchen was clean, Teddy was in bed, and he found himself sitting in the living room with his aunt, sipping on the wine he’d bought.
A soft gasp sounded from the Flourish and Blotts front desk.  The crowd of people waiting in line stared at Draco, open-mouthed and frozen in shock.  A baby on a wizard's hip grinned and clapped chubby hands together, oblivious to its pacifier falling to the bookstore floor.
The movie Harry and Draco went to see is The Devil Wears Prada (David Frankel, 2006).
Draco considered her for a moment. “Well my other thought was a new take on those books that teach about body parts.” Encouraged by Harry’s nodding, he continued. “Except instead of body parts, I could teach different facets of BDSM.”
“I’ve always loved a challenge. Figuring out puzzles was my favourite pastime. As I got older, the challenge of understanding the complexities of the human body really started to draw me in. I spent hours during my seventh year researching how potions interact with human organs, how spells can alter genes, how easily a person’s magical core can repair torn limbs.”
“I’d better get going,” he said, putting his glass down and standing up. “I have a very early Portkey. But thank you for dinner, it was really nice getting to spend some time with you.”
Draco handed him the paper. Once he read the headline, Harry would never forgive him.
“About us. Our relationship.”
Draco stretched his neck as he let go of the Portkey and handed it to the station attendant. Hitching his bag back up onto his shoulder, he made his way out into the waiting area, looking around for a hint of the jet black bird's nest that had taken over his dreams the past few days. He was expecting Harry to be standing around reading something or the other for work, maybe a hoodie over his head to avoid the press, as he usually was when he came to pick Draco up. What he wasn't expecting was to see Harry in a beautifully cut suit, holding a giant bouquet of red roses and a Muggle helium balloon that said “Congratulations” on it. He broke into a wide smile as he noticed Draco and waved him over. It was then that it finally hit Draco that he'd never have to know the feeling of missing Harry again. This wonderful man was his, and the thought sent his heart soaring. Unable to contain the laughter that bubbled out of his throat or the tears in his eyes, Draco ran over to Harry's waiting arms.
“So as I was saying, I live alone. I have one daughter, but she moved out to America years back with her own daughter and husband. Landed a great contract for inventing charms and is doing very well for herself, bless her. Her mother, my wife, passed on a few years ago, and neither of us had any other family here, so now it’s just me.”
“Did you end it?”
“Nonsense! If I’m being honest, I’m a little worried you’ll splinch yourself getting back with how distracted you are.”
“Why didn’t you have a normal life?” Bryan asked curiously. Harry hesitated, not sure how much he wanted his new friend to know.
Teddy nodded, already seated at his desk and pouring over the pages. Scorpius recognised that expression—Teddy was now focused on his work and probably wouldn’t reemerge until his timer startled him out of it. Deciding to leave him be, Scorpius turned and rushed off to the cafeteria, hoping he had time to grab a sandwich before getting back to work.
works beautifully. Though I can’t help thinking, surely a man as accomplished as you must already know that. It made me wonder if maybe all those crossed out phrases weren’t meant to be hidden after all. So to answer your question, yes. That’s what a relationship is supposed to feel like. Like you’re breathless with laughter, dancing safe in someone’s arms. Like there is no one you want to be with more in the world. Two people in a relationship should get lost in each others’ eyes, melt into each others’ lips, and feel so alive when they touch that they could never imagine living without each other again.
"No," he croaked, sliding off the bed and fetching the dress she had dropped on the floor. He handed it to her and she snatched it away, holding it against herself as she tried to cover her modesty, curled in a heap on the bed. He averted his eyes, instead moving to his rucksack, where thankfully the majority of his belongings were still packed. He grabbed the few clothes that were strewn about and shoved them in, turning back to find that Camilla had redressed, and was crying softly on the bed.
Their server popped up almost immediately, asking for their drink orders. Harry turned to Camilla and asked if she or her parents liked anything specific. After a bit of discussion with the waiter, she suggested a certain wine, of which Harry ordered two bottles.
“The dragons had other friends too, but they liked to hang out with each other the most. One day, Harry had to go away on a migration with his family, and had to leave Draco behind.”
“I love you too,” Draco replied. As they lay there in each others’ arms, drifting slowly to sleep, Draco had no doubt that Harry was right. They just had to keep moving forward together, and everything would be alright.
Dear readers,
Scorpius jumped up excitedly, running around the table to stand next to Harry.
“The second idea,” Harry continued, “is that there are a bunch of shops inside an old chocolate factory that we could go see.”
It had been lucky for the Aurors that Silverthorn seemed to have miscalculated how long it would take him to kill the Minister. If he hadn’t started changing back before leaving the Minister’s office, he would have walked out as Harry Potter, and no one would have known the Minister was dead until Silverthorn had gotten far away from the Ministry.
"I love it!" he cried. "What is it?"
“That’s what I thought too. Until I spoke to Headmistress McGonagall this morning.”
“Thank you,” Scorpius repeated. “You did an amazing job.”
Harry and Draco were surprised to find a rich history at the square when they arrived, and promptly decided that a tour would be a good idea. Scorpius didn’t seem to agree at first, dragging his feet as they went, but his mood instantly lifted at the sight of all the chocolate in the store where the tour ended. The little trio were soon seated at a table in the sun with large chocolate sundaes in front of them, chattering happily about the things they’d seen, the car ride, and the shows on the Telly.
“I’m glad to hear that. I really like you too, even if you don’t speak like a… what was the term you used again? Posh git?”
Harry nodded. "More than anything. I meant it when I said I really enjoyed spending the afternoon with Scorpius. And with you," he added, satisfied that his comment made Draco blush.
“It’s good to see you too,” he replied, giving her a hug. They sat back down on the sofa, chatting about his trip to Oslo. It wasn’t long before her mother reappeared, this time with a tray of spiced coffee and her father in tow. As they all settled down in the cozy room, Harry suddenly remembered his gift for Camilla.
Draco couldn't help beaming at that. When was the last time anyone had been proud of him? As they left the station, hand in hand, Draco realised that it didn't matter. The past was the past; he just had to keep moving forward. It was a bit of a scary thought, but with Harry by his side, it was going to be wonderful. With Harry by his side, everything was going to be okay.
There was a little murmuring among the Wizengamot members as she said this. It was the same type of worried discussion that broke out among older witches and wizards anytime Death Eaters were mentioned.
“The court calls to order the appeal hearing for the sentencing of Draco Lucius Malfoy, arrested 15 years prior for unlicensed brewing of controlled potions, attempted terrorist plots, and accessory to the assasination of the one hundred and seventy-fourth Minister for Magic. This case was reopened by Head Auror Penelope Elizabeth Clearwater, justified by the discovery of new evidence. The Wizengamot will hear the new evidence from the accused’s council, and then review the charges as necessary. Council, your opening remarks please.”
