A large gash opens across the skin of Draco’s cheek. It looks like a scabbed over wound, torn open by his consistent movements. It’s bleeding little droplets of red down the left side of his face.
Draco looked pained. “Don’t patronise me,” he said, the look he shot Harry full of venom. “I’d like to see my friends, and honestly at this point, I’m not sure why I’m asking for permission.”
“You’re all dressed up,” Harry says instead. His eyes rake over Draco’s frame, but he tears them away quickly in fear of being noticed.
“I should’ve,” Harry muttered under his breath without really meaning it. If Draco had heard, he didn’t bother to reply.
He probably shouldn’t drink but fuck it. If he is going to see Draco tonight, one drink can't hurt. He nods back at Seamus who gives a toothy grin.
Draco followed his line of sight but neglected to comment. “You said you couldn’t control yourself just moments ago.” He breathed in, hoping honesty was the correct path to choose. “Sometimes, I can’t either.”
Lavender nods, like she already knows. “I work at the Ministry, too, you know. Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.”
Harry feels his breath catch in his throat and makes a choking noise. Hearing Malfoy’s name hurts more than he could have expected. Harry doesn’t even want Azkaban; he just wants to die. He thinks Dumbledore can probably sense that.
“I’ll come with you,” Draco said hurriedly at the voice’s mercy, floating dishes to the sink and setting them to clean. He was surprised when Harry neglected to protest.
In a quick movement, Harry reached for the coat rack and drew his wand from the pocket of his robes; holly wood pressed against Draco’s bare chest, and he didn’t dare move.
Ordinarily, he could keep his cool during arguments. Still, with the impending and catastrophic horror of his subconscious looming over his shoulder, it was harder to hold himself together enough to give a good fight back.
” he shouted stupidly, knowing well enough that a counter charm to a stunner wasn’t going to do anything useful.
He knew he was out of luck when the sounds of scuffling and a soft noise echoed from somewhere further in the house.
She was never a malicious girl; she was bright and full of warmth. Pansy loved her because they were equally as brilliant, though in entirely different ways. She would do what it took to keep the people she loved safe, and honestly, Harry admired her for that, even if it might eventually factor into his downfall.
Harry takes a tentative sip of tea, and then dips the edge of a custard cream into the liquid. He chews slowly and deliberately before forcing himself to swallow.
They’d been spending more time with each other recently without even purposefully meaning to do so. Sometimes, Harry would just show up at Draco’s with takeout and a film recommendation, and he’d simply let him in like it was a normal thing to be doing. Draco would dutifully try to sober up before Harry could take any notice, but it never really worked. Sometimes Draco met him outside work, and they went for long meandering walks in the freezing weather. Somehow, Harry liked that better. When they were both in their right state of mind.
Theo and Pansy burst into laughter, and Harry finds himself a bit horrified by the fact that their strong reactions relieve him.
“You know you can talk to me about anything, Harry,” she said gently, reaching her hand out to place it on his. “I’m Draco’s best friend, but I was yours first.”
“How do you know?” Harry asked gruffly, hoping his steely tone wouldn’t betray pure and absolute terror. Locke had more power over him than anyone else in the wizarding world at this very moment, and Harry wanted to rip it from his filthy grasp.
“You know how ‘Mione is.” Ron shrugged, thumbing uninterestedly through a page of what could only be yet another unhelpful document. “Now that she’s got her mind on this, she won’t be able to let it go until we’ve come up with something useful.”
“You know, they say I have Seeker reflexes,” Harry joked, feeling a subtle undercurrent of happiness in his chest.
Harry mulled his words over, almost a little infuriated at how logical Draco sounded. Harry had expected pity but was undeniably relieved at its absence. He let a tight breath out of his chest.
Robards relaxed a bit as Hermione left the room. Sometimes her presence could be more intimidating than the Minister himself. “Potter and Weasley, check out the crime scene. This could either be a random attack or a deliberate killing, and both options are equally alarming. A few witnesses and family members are there awaiting interviews.”
By pure luck, Luna accidentally mentioned it around Neville, who could never keep a secret from Harry. He was too fond of him for that. They’d been weeding out an incredibly overgrown area around the sunflower patch together when he’d confronted Harry with the information.
When they had first moved in, Draco had set up a Muggle wireless radio, and Harry had been more than surprised. They’d danced to music in their kitchen while making breakfast each morning, and Draco would casually flip pancakes with just a flick of his wand. Harry had still not mastered such precise movement.
Malfoy’s face contorted. “I don’t know why Muggles worship ordinary people like this. It hardly seems sane.”
Harry wets his lips with his tongue and leans in, pressing a kiss gently to Draco’s nose. It’s cold, despite their recent activities.
He launched himself at Harry with a driving force, tackling him into the overgrown grass of their front lawn. They lay still for a moment before Draco nuzzled gently into Harry’s neck.
“How was work? Can I make you something? Are you tired?” The words that flung themselves out of Draco’s mouth were obviously forced. It was clear from the fear in his eyes that the potion was busy at work, peppering Harry with precisely what he needed.
To the unknown listener, it might have seemed like Malfoy was actually giving civility a go. Harry knew better than that.
“Sometimes, I just...” Harry paused, debating how to word his thoughts without sounding like an idiot. “I just wonder if you wish I had done more for your family than I did.”
“You don’t like this?” Carrow chuckled, gripping harder. His eyes glittered with an insatiable appetite. “I love making boys like you hurt.”
“Don’t do that with me,” Harry says, but it comes out as more of a question. “We’re equals in this relationship.”
He walked up unabashedly to a group of boys their age kicking around a football as if it were the middle of springtime and not crisp Autumn. They were wearing athletic shorts, and Harry grew colder just looking at them.
Purple hollow cheeks and black eyes plagued his snow white skin. Any colour in his face was replaced by a sickly grey hue that made him look much older and frailer than he was.
After a pause, Draco gets up with a soft groan, as though supporting weight on his legs is too taxing of a job.
He guides Draco’s hands away to look at the product of his own making. Harry has gone silent, and still.
“No,” Harry said, his tone resolute and unfeeling. “This is lunacy, all of this is. Why were you even following me tonight? Something is wrong, Draco, but it’s got to do with you —”
Draco saw a Mind Healer sometimes, because Harry knew that if he didn’t, he would spiral. But Harry took great care to poke around Draco’s memory with careful Legilimency, rearranging events and happenings so as to not incriminate himself in any illegal activity. Really, it was for the best for both of them. It would crush Draco if he were to find out what had been happening to him, and Harry wouldn't risk losing him over something so trivial.
He was in a bed, maybe located at the center of the room, and linen white curtains had been drawn around the bedside. Harry and a Healer, maybe, were speaking from just beyond the barrier, clearly unaware that Draco had woken at the noise.
Harry slides down to the ground, leaning his back heavily against the sink cabinet. He hugs his sweatshirt tighter over his body as he sits down on the tiled floor. The first few weeks of January are always especially cold.
Draco’s cheeks were red and flushed, his gasps stuttered by cries of pain and pleasure. It wasn’t long before he was telling Harry to fuck him harder and faster, with blond hair plastered to his sweaty forehead.
Harry knew that. He really did. But sometimes it didn’t matter who had something first. Preference always took precedence over that, and Harry knew that oftentimes Ginny preferred Draco over him. Their flying wit, inside jokes, and cunning personalities were things Harry knew he could never share with either of the two.
So Draco had gone home that evening and combed through Harry’s gardening manuals while he was fast asleep in bed. Finding out that Silybum Marianum was colloquially named “milk thistle” was only the first step in a long and laborious road.
“Yeah, the light woke me.” Draco grimaced, taking a seat at the table and folding open the Sunday morning paper that Lyra had brought inside. She was a small tawny owl, and there was nothing astoundingly special about her. But Draco had always cared for her, and stroked at her feathers affectionately as she perched on the chair next to him.
Draco walks over to the bed, standing by the edge. He strokes a hand through Claude’s fur, who mewls happily in response.
“What do you mean?” Neville asks from the side, offering him a swig of the strange-looking drink that Luna had been holding too.
Draco made for the door, and Harry put the roast in the oven. The chicken would be done in thirty minutes, and there would be a perfect char on the fruits. One thing Harry could rely on himself for was excellent cooking.
Draco bent over and took a bite. He chewed for much longer than he really needed to, before swallowing.
His mind oscillated between both panic and relief. On the one hand, he was glad that the man had turned himself in, and Harry wouldn’t need to compromise himself to give the Ministry such important information. On the other, the shopkeeper had information that could ruin his life.
Their conversations were so clinical, and Harry wished he could just reach out and knock some emotion back into Draco. When had apathy become a painful constant?
He strode back to the castle, as a light rain began to speckle down upon him, dampening his trainers. The sky was a little cloudy and dark as the day transitioned to night time. He cast a
“Are you taking back your confession?” Harry asked, his strained voice betraying his cool demeanour.
The last thing Draco needed was another person breathing down his throat about something and demanding updates. He had resolved to deal with it by himself for his own peace of mind.
“I understand,” Harry cut him off, taking their unfinished plates to the sink as Draco gaped at him. “Just make yourself available tonight. Ginny and I planned a celebration, and if you let her down, she’ll be disappointed.”
“Slowly, love,” she said, wrangling the glass away from his prying, insistent fingers. “You’ll have to pace yourself or you’ll be sick.”
As soon as the words were out, Draco let his hand cover his mouth gently. His eyes widened almost comically, and Harry would have laughed if Draco didn’t look so guilty for voicing his thought. He wanted to reach out and push away a strand of Draco’s hair that had fallen loosely in front of his face. Before Harry knew it, his hand was moving in front of him as if it were being controlled by someone else. His fingers brushed gently against Draco’s sharp cheekbone, and the boy flinched at the touch but leaned into it afterward. Harry’s heart was in this throat, threatening to empty out onto the table. He wet his lips just slightly, and knew exactly what he wanted to do next. A familiar little tug made its presence known in his lower belly. Draco wasn’t moving him away either, his sharp eyes staring so intensely into Harry’s own that he was surprised they weren’t watering.
“Pauline Marchand’s killer confessed. He’s being held in the cells now before interrogation. We have him for a couple of hours before the Minister wants him sent to Azkaban. The
“Why don’t you put on some clothes and help me get dinner ready,” Harry suggested, as though Draco had any other choice. He removed his uniform robes and draped them over an unused armchair.
“You’re right. I’m sorry,” Harry said, pressing at his temples as though it would steady the information building uncomfortably in his head. “I really can’t talk about it, though. Ministry business and all. Tell me a little about your day instead?”
Draco crossed the empty street in a few easy steps and pushed in. The bell announced his arrival from behind him. A portly man behind the counter was scribbling something into a notepad, the pen dwarfed by his large fingers.
Harry does, and Seamus guides him expertly through the crowd as though he’s navigated it several times before. No one seems surprised to see Harry there, though many still wave and smile.
He walked down the hall silently, folding his fingers into milky white fists. Pain reverberated out from where his fingernails dug into soft skin. Reminding himself to take deep breaths, he pushed open the doors to the lavatory down the hall, exchanging a polite nod with an older man making his exit.
He was good at his job. He enjoyed the frenetic and fast-paced world of finance that he’d drowned himself in after the war. It gave him purpose. Numbers were much easier to understand than people, and Gringotts had provided such a relief for so many years. It had been a constant when everything was different and changing. Draco couldn’t imagine quitting a job he’d devoted much of his heart and life to.
The mattress makes a squeaking noise as Harry pulls himself from it, rummaging through his closet for a set of sweatpants and a shirt. He doesn’t think much about it as he strips in front of Draco, and when he’s dressed, he turns to find him looking very purposefully at a poster in the opposite direction.
Ginny, though, nodded understandingly. Wouldn’t she, of all people, know when Draco wasn’t telling the truth? Was what he had said even the truth? Confusion bubbled inside of him like a tetchy cauldron.
“But even if you weren’t their child, they should’ve at least respected you.” Draco reasoned, taking another cautious sip of wine. “They were required to take care of you.”
Draco’s room is minimal, similar to the rest of the house. What catches Harry’s eye is not the obnoxiously green bedspread or the sheer amount of books in the room that could easily rival Hermione’s collection. It is a portrait of medium size that hangs on the wall across from his bed. A blonde boy of maybe ten or eleven plays with a small dog in the frame.
He decided that a half-truth would have to suffice. “We did argue that night. It was probably one of the worst fights we’ve ever had.” Harry swallowed dryly, feeling his throat close at the honesty of his statement. “And we knew that things couldn’t go on the way they were, and decided to make a change.” Harry held his breath, hoping that would satisfy.
“I’m not twelve, Potter,” Draco replies, bundling his clothes up tighter in his arms and walking out the door.
He’s more irritated than he’d like to be, knowing that Draco had only owled him under the influence, and not necessarily because he’d really wanted to spend time with him.
Draco surges forward with a quiet intensity, pressing his lips to Harry’s. He can’t comprehend what it feels like when the crowd goes wild at midnight, and Draco’s still in his arms kissing him back, exploring his mouth like their lives depend on it. Everyone’s screaming and shouting and crying, and Harry’s unapologetically happy for just one single moment, until it disappears.
“I’m sorry for what I said,” Harry says sincerely. “I never meant to imply that you’re a more honest version of yourself when you’re high. Because, really, that’s not who you are. And I like
“She’s not really mine,” Draco says, using two fingers to stroke between her eyes and down to her tailfeathers. She nuzzles happily into Draco’s chest, and Harry finds himself sitting with the horrific realisation that he wishes that were him.
“You two were destined to be mortal enemies, Harry. But there was always a fire inside of both of you for one another.” She took a breath, breathing back tears that Harry could see were already threatening to displace her makeup, “I’m just – I’m glad you held him in the end. That’s all.”
“Harry, is something wrong?” Luna asked, but when he turned to look at her, she was drawing lazy circles on the ground with her wand. Small lavender-colored sparks ignited from its tip and disappeared as they touched the floor.
Before Harry knows it, he’s twirling through the air, landing roughly on the doorstep of Draco’s funny little home. Though the sight of it is familiar, Harry still finds himself unable to look away from the looming structure.
Harry clears his throat, straightening up in his chair as though posturing will somehow make him feel better. “Well, I was going to tell him—”
“Mrs Weasley, thank you so much for having me.” Draco bows his head, politely, playing with his fingers. “I don’t usually spend Christmas with my...family anymore, and I really appreciate it.”
Before she can respond, Ginny emerges from the kitchen in a food-stained apron patterned with small forest animals. Her hair is tied back into a messy bun, and she looks as though Molly has somehow put her through hell and back—something Harry very much does not doubt.
Draco considered it for a moment and supposed she must be right. But, he reminded himself, the damned voice had, in fact, done harm. It had held him at the brink of terror, and then Harry had pulled him back from it. What if Harry hadn’t realised in time? What if he didn’t care and kept going? Nothing quite so terrifying had happened since, and Draco hadn’t wanted to push the bounds of their nighttime activities anyway, but he knew he never wanted
Dinner goes too quickly, and it’s barely two hours before the dishes are washing themselves in the sink, and Blaise is picking out something to match his dress shirt. Ginny selects for him a nicely fitting dinner jacket. Only he would somehow be able to pull off something so formal with the rest of his casual outfit. Harry feels severely under equipped in his stained jeans and Puddlemere United tee, though he’s never been one to learn how to dress for an occasion.
Harry figured he’d never use it, but still tucked the vial safely into his bag. The shopkeeper was starting to squint at him funny again, so it would be best to make a quick exit.
“I had a lovely time today,” Draco says as they step into the warmth of Harry’s home. “Thank you for inviting me.”
Draco nodded, swiping his tongue over his lips once, twice, and then three times, before realising it was making his mouth feel even more dry than before.
“No, no, no, no, Malfoy, you stay awake, you idiot!” Harry yells, hitting at his red cheeks and shaking his arms. Please God or Merlin, or anyone out there just let him live he deserves to live, Harry thinks.
He picks up a book from Draco’s bedside table. It looks to be thoroughly loved, and as Harry pages through it, he sees notes scribbled in the margins. He flips back to the cover, running his fingers over the raised lettering of
“Don’t start with me, Harry,” Ginny warns. “You know what being soulmates means. You don’t get to just fuck off from each other for a week, your core will not let you. Don’t be stubborn, because this time around it’ll kill you.”
“And you discounted it quickly, I presume.” She blinked, long ethereal lashes reaching out delicately over the blue of her eyes.
“Harry, you’ve never done something like that to me before,” Draco said, his voice quivering and small. “During sex, I mean.”
to her. And well, he was probably attracted to her. If he wanted Pansy, he could probably have her, because she shared a similar interest in both sexes. But Draco had shaken himself out of the intrusive thought as Neville, cheeky grin plastered upon his features, replaced the empty champagne flute in his hand.
“No, you don’t. You were busy,” the woman said, but there was no bitterness to it, just pragmatism. She hesitantly held her hand out for Harry. “I’m Capucine. This is my father, Alfred.”
“I know,” Draco said, shaking his head, avoiding eye contact. “After all of this, something has to change. But I can’t just leave Harry.”
“Please, I can’t take it,” Draco said, and he knew how hot and ready he was. His legs trembled from around Harry’s middle, but he wouldn’t ease them up until he was being fucked into properly.
“So why’s he here then?” Harry muttered, and Ron gave pause for a moment in response. He’d blatantly disregarded Auror protocol and interrogation training, but that was the last thing on his mind.
He frowns, touching his cheek gently, pulling his hand away to reveal a fresh layer of crimson on his fingertips.
Harry strung up twinkling fairy lights that cozied up the space and cleared away stray leaves and fallen fruit to make room for round tables with wicker chairs. He arranged a food and refreshments table on one side and an area for music on the other. The whole space seemed quaint, like a perfect summer party. Harry knew Draco would somehow manage to detest it all anyway.
“Dorian Locke,” Ron read aloud, as though the subject wasn’t already in the room. “Charged with the murder of Pauline Marchand and already confessed.”
Harry finds himself clinging to her every word as she speaks; she seems to be the kind of person that draws a crowd, for no reason in particular but a kind, positive aura.
The head-demon hadn’t been causing much trouble since the bedroom incident, but it had been acting up frequently enough that Draco had taken himself to a Healer. He had worried he had a brain tumour or something of the sort but was sent home with clear scans and a damn pat on the back.
“When you were saying earlier that you wanted to make this work, what did you mean by that?” Harry poked at his food, feeling little desire to eat despite protests from a rumbling stomach.
Harry sat up, with Draco still firmly around his cock, and pushed a tender kiss to Draco’s lips. The blonde was still sitting softly in his lap, lifting up and slamming back down on Harry with a force. Harry sucked and nipped at Draco’s neck, allowing himself to be lost in the sensation and the movements of his partner’s body. He felt a familiar build of unreleased pressure from deep inside of himself.
Draco sat up in his bed, his back ramrod straight, mind dizzying at the sudden action. “Healer, you must have mistaken me with another patient. I have never in my life abused any potions, nor have I ever intended to. This is all I mistake. Please, can I speak with Harry, he’ll know —”
The team of Healers tasked with his case had worked tirelessly to try and convince him that he was, indeed, an addict. But they’d failed on numerous occasions, and Draco’s resolve was rock hard. Anything new they wanted to try on him wouldn’t work.
Lyra squawked from beside him, and he turned his attention away from the paper. They sometimes reported nonsense, and Draco didn’t have the time or energy to bother much with it anymore. Among their articles, it was hard to discern what was of real danger or merely political fodder. He trusted other news sources over one that’s viewpoint could be warped so easily.
It was barely six in the evening when he heard the lock slide open, and shivered at the adjusting wards. Draco usually worked late.
Draco would usually complain about that, but Harry knew he was physically incapable of doing so. Instead, he’d changed into a silk button-down pyjama shirt that clashed with his trousers from work. Still, Harry found the sight adorable, before an inevitable part of his mind snapped at him to relinquish such thoughts.
“What brings you here today, Draco?” she asked gently, indicating for him to sit. He complied. She flicked her wand, and a tray of tea and biscuits emerged from the hallway almost as if it had been pre-prepared.
Harry stands too, feeling small next to her although he matches her in height. He feels unmistakably as though he's overstayed his welcome.
The Minister had called them in on an assignment, and while Harry and Ron were not partners, they were to work together on this particular case for unspecified purposes.
.” There was the sound of something paper-thin hitting the floor. “And I am his family. I don’t have the time for this right now. I —”
He surges up to kiss Draco, pressing their foreheads together, then their bodies, desperate to touch as much of him as he can.
“You’ve won this battle, Potter. But I’ll win the war.” Malfoy resigned, but he clamped his mouth shut quickly at the statement. Familiar discomfiture and uncertainty settled around their table before Harry dared to speak again.
“We should have Ginny and Pansy over for dinner. It might be fun, like the old days. I miss our friends.”
A surprised expression crosses Draco’s face, and he seems to unwind a bit, too. He frowns, looking down at his shoes, and inhaling for a moment. “Good,” Draco says.
“I don’t want to make this harder than it already is.” Harry sat back down at the table, and Malfoy followed suit.
He had returned to his job at Gringotts, and they had welcomed him back with open arms. He had been one of their best.
Harry was on the verge of something big. He’d snap, Draco would startle, and something terrible would happen. He wasn’t quite sure why or how he knew, but he just did.
Still, as much as he loves to admire Draco’s appearance, he can’t help but notice his hollow eyes. Sharp silver irises are dimmed to a muted grey. Circles so dark they stain Draco’s porcelain skin sit deep into his face, giving him a gaunt look that Harry just wants to
“Yes, everything’s just fine,” Draco said all too swifty. He detached one hand from the other and gritted his teeth.
“I’m a nice person,” Harry winds up responding. It’s a statement that he, at least, knows to be true.
“There was a time I would’ve done anything for you, Harry. I would’ve flown to the end of the world on a fucking hippogriff if it meant I could see your smile.” Draco pressed a hand to his temples but focused his gaze on the ground, “I don’t feel those things anymore. I don’t know why, but that’s just how it is.”
“Can I ask you something?” Draco began, surprised at his own initiative. They rounded the corner and entered a hallway, cluttered with recovering patients and their overseers.
“I love you both, but that is too much information for my liking,” she snickers. The look on her face is wiped away immediately as she spots something that makes her face grow cold and surprised. Harry is almost a little afraid to turn around.
Memory charms took their toll, though, and the potion had, too. They had worn Draco down to a chip of his former self. He was nothing in comparison to what he used to be; vibrant and driven and breathtaking.
“Things like that can get dangerous, you know,” she says, flicking her wand in the direction of her wardrobe. A collection of jumpers emerge from inside and line themselves up dutifully against the wall. “Yellow or pink?”
They kiss for a while, feverishly, and undress each other without much of a second thought. Until Harry notices.
“It usually isn’t,” Ethel says. “Soulmates tend to find their way to each other no matter what. It’s very rare that paired cores are complete strangers. In a fascinating way, magic will bring people together without them even realising it.”
The rest of the day is spent in a flurry, Harry and Draco joking around as they bounce from shop to shop picking out personal presents for each member of the Weasley family and enjoying the cheer in the air. Draco’s mood is looking up, and he can’t stop thumbing through the pages of his new novel. Harry feels his heart swell at the sight.
She’s softer with Draco, but she shamelessly wraps her arms around him anyway, and Harry smiles at the look of genuine surprise on his face.
Harry resists the urge to put it on the nightstand, feeling distinctly like it’s going to tip over and spill over them all. Theo begins to eat like he’s been starved for centuries, but Draco refuses to look at the bowl.
He gives Draco’s hand a light, comforting squeeze and pulls away as Hermione opens the door with a beaming smile.
“Blimey Harry,” Ron remarked, uncapping a hangover potion from his drawer and passing it across the stretch of beds. “You look ghastly.”
For some reason, Harry notices, she seems to be reading words on a page that he can’t see. The entire length of the book that is visible to him is one long and suspicious blank page.
He accepted the cake with one hand, fishing out a handful of Galleons with the other. He paid Madam Odessa, but she didn’t move away from him, only gazed through his eyes like she was trying to find something else within the green.
Draco puts a hand on his hip, seeming to consider the offer for a moment. “Your office?” he asks, his voice unsure.
“Well, you’ve fucked us now,” Draco says, not turning away from the mirror where he’s readjusting his jacket. “This is such bad luck.”
“Surprise us, why don’t you,” Pansy said, before kissing the phone with a loud smacking noise and hanging up.
“I will not claim to know what you and Draco have going on between yourselves,” Zabini said coolly, though hostility punctuated his tone. “What I do know is what whatever you did last night hurt him. And you know how Slytherin’s handle people who hurt them? They hurt them back and then push them away. Is that what you want, Potter?”
It’s a rainy Christmas morning, not quite cold enough to snow, and the Burrow is glowing a warm orange from the inside out. Harry’s always loved Christmas here; it feels nice to be surrounded by family. It’s strange because he relishes the small arguments, the bickering, the debating that comes with the Weasleys and their Christmas Days. Everyone is just happy to be here, despite all the sibling rivalry.
A moment passed, and no answer came. Anxiety hadn’t really set in until Harry Accio-ed his wand and it flew around the corner, forcefully into his hand.
He doesn’t think anyone’s really heard him, and the music playing from downstairs is still far too loud. Harry closes the door gently behind him and approaches the bed. When he pulls back the gauze, he finds himself less surprised than he should be by the scene in front of him.
Ron continued their descent, and Harry followed close behind to not stray too far on his own. He never liked being alone in this part of the Ministry and made a point to avoid it actively. Something about the cloying and claustrophobic environment of his office was still far more welcome than this.
Draco was hollow, empty. Too many thoughts swam through his mind before he could count out his numbers and calm down the part of his brain that thrived on overthinking.
“Harry, I just wanted to say I’m really sorry.” Ron looked sheepish, and Harry could now see Hermione standing in the entranceway to the boy’s tower. There was no doubt in his mind that she had pressured Ron to settle things with Harry, even if the argument wasn’t going to last forever. “I really am sorry. Hermione talked to me, and she’s right; it’s really not my place to judge whatever you do.”
Harry strode up to him eagerly, smiling, with his hands still in his pockets. Draco neglected to return the expression so readily, but he was still pleased. Harry’s head hurt once more.
Initial discomfort dissipated like smoke through clean morning air. The window was open, and Lyra was fanning her feathers dry in the wind. It must have rained last night, even though the morning was peaceful and bright. The plants were marshy, swamp-like in their appearance.
Harry located Ron and Hermione waiting for him in the common room, and after explaining his dilemma, he was met with profound incredulity. Hermione’s reaction was to be expected.
“Good evening to you too, Parkinson.” Draco laughed, hiking his coat up over his shoulders in the chilly winter air.
Harry steps closer, aware of how his body is positioned between Draco’s legs. He dabs another layer of liquid from the vial on, letting it settle into the skin.
Draco grimaced instead, but couldn’t find it in his will to snap at the woman. She’d been a friend, even closer than one, for far too long. “Odessa, nothing is wrong. I simply woke on the wrong side of the bed this morning. I do have to run, but thank you very much for breakfast.”
“And for tea and biscuits!” Ron joked, but his half-hearted smile slid from his face when it wasn’t returned. “We’re just worried about you.”
“Alright.” Ethel takes a final sip of her tea before setting the cup down onto the desk. It clatters roughly against the wood and, for a moment, Harry wonders if the liquid will spill over. “Best to get to it quickly. Just sit still for me, please.”
They ate their meal like that most days, with Harry punctuating the silence to command another bite. That was usually how he cajoled Draco into finishing at least half of his plate, and it was probably what kept him from being severely malnourished despite his already thinning frame.
“No, but I assumed you would eventually,” she said mildly, returning her attention to Opal, who mewled blithely against the cotton jumper.
cover to remind any and everyone that he was still the Saviour of the wizarding world. Other people should receive the credit, but he already knew they wouldn’t.
It was easy to forget the things he’d done to Draco now that he’d been doing them for months. He found it became more natural to deal with the guilt, the pain, if only in the short term.
Draco preps largely in silence as the evening ticks by. Harry, if only to fill the room, puts on the Muggle wireless and The Smiths croon through the radio. Usually, Harry would sit back and pour himself a glass of Merlot but finds himself a bit repulsed by the idea all of a sudden. He doesn’t really care to drink around Draco.
Harry knew he wouldn't be able to live with himself if things, their relationship, continued this way, but at this point, there wasn't another option.
Harry knew things had been better, and the majority of their friends had noticed that. He’d only seen Ginny in passing, but she’d neglected to ask him about the state of his relationship — which was pleasantly surprising.
“We’ve decided to give our relationship one more go. We’re meant for each other, and it would be unfair to give up at the slightest inconvenience,” he spoke. The line seemed mechanical, almost rehearsed. But Draco couldn’t remember practicing such a statement.
“What are we doing?” Draco asked softly, but the question wasn’t tinged with sadness or fear. He just put it out there, as if he were asking what the weather was like.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry says, following the scar lines with a finger. “I never meant for this to happen.”
His Draco would never sit in the dirt; he’d never want to muddy up his nice clothing. Harry would tease him about being too uptight and insist he sit down anyway. And then Draco would comply but would sigh the entire time dramatically.
“I’m not going to accompany you back to your room, Harry. I’m not your caretaker. This is becoming a bit of a habit.” Draco narrowed his eyes, but his hands never pulled away.
“Yes,” he said stiffly, hoping the lie wouldn’t wreak havoc on his head. When it didn’t, he resisted a cry of relief.
Harry doesn’t really want to leave the quiet haven of the kitchen for the loud party, but he’s reluctant to voice those concerns to Luna at all. He offers her a small smile before venturing back out the way that Seamus came in. If it were possible, the sitting room has gotten darker, and is more packed than when he’d walked in. There are more unfamiliar faces now.
Harry brings his hand up to knock, slowing as it gets closer to the wood. The door is gothic-shaped, with a point at the top that, for some reason, makes him anxious to look at. There’s a small arched window at the centre, but Harry can only see blackness inside. It almost seems like no one is home.
He had known he was acting incredibly juvenile but couldn’t help it. Malfoy always managed to bring that side out of him.
Draco’s eyes softened, and he reached across the table as though he were going to take Harry’s hand. He pulled it back hastily instead. “Seems as though I’m already lost, though, don’t you think?”
“It’s Christmas Eve,” Draco pointed out more weakly than he would’ve liked. “I just wanted to spend time together.” It was a vulnerable, unfounded response, and he knew it. But maybe playing the role of lonely husband would garner him a bit of sympathy.
.” His cock strained harder at the thought — that Draco was all his and no one else’s. That, really, Harry held complete control over the man underneath him. And what he wanted, he could have.
“What the fuck,” he said aloud, wonder and terror clouding the thoughts in his head. “What do I do?”
Snape shakes his head, and Harry continues, “He said, I’m scared. I hated him my whole life until he went and said that.”
“Draco, shit, is it that bad?” Harry gasped, kneeling on the ground next to his chair. “Talk to me. What’s going on? Do we need to go to the hospital?”
“Harry, I brought—” Ron begins, but stops in the entrance to the kitchen, his mouth hanging open and low into an o-shape. He holds a stack of files in his hand.
“People change,” Narcissa says softly, after a moment. “Even my own son. I don’t blame him for refusing to come home. This was never really a home to him, after all.”
The voice was angry now, insistent and unrelenting in its desire to force Draco’s hand. He fought it wordlessly with pleas of desperation, but the walls he’d slammed up in his mind were beginning to crumble to dust. They were never strong enough to hold it off entirely, but Draco was playing to buy time — not to win.
Still, Harry approached the tent. As he entered, reality widened and stretched, and a large room came into focus. It was cosy and warm, but bare enough to be appropriate for the situation at hand. Witnesses were gathered to one side as a few Aurors jotted down notes with their quills. Harry stood at the entranceway awkwardly, unsure where to begin.
Sometimes, Harry knew he committed too much time to futile projects, and he often wondered if Draco was one of them.
Ron nodded knowingly at that statement; they had heard it far too many times in their line of work. He led Harry to the scene where the brick pavement was stained an unpleasant crimson. He supposed they should probably clean it soon; flashes of light from passersby indicated that many were taking photos.
“Draco,” Harry whispered, the words barely able to move past his lips. His crimson robes suddenly seemed like the only colour in the room.
“I can’t.” Harry shakes his head. “He won’t react well, I can’t just drop a bomb like this on him. He'll be angry that I've been keeping it from him this whole time.”
Harry blinks. “Keep your voice down,” he says, but Draco seems to be distracted by something George is talking about next to him. “I can’t just yet.”
The man tapped away at a few buttons on the register before returning a total in the glowing green light of the front screen. Draco fished a few Muggle bills out of his pocket. A hand on his shoulder startled him.
They had free time on Thursday mornings, and usually, Harry spent it outside when the weather was nice, but he didn’t want to risk a chance encounter with Malfoy just yet.
“It’s been bugging me for a while. What does the password to your common room mean? Sometimes I can parse out the Latin, but I had no idea on this one. Usually, Gryffindor doesn’t choose such odd-sounding words.”
Harry finds himself inexplicably and terrifyingly worried as to why her first instinct about Draco would be that he is dead.
He’s heard of them before through various cases he’s worked at the department. “Sounds like that could be something that is really useful for you,” Harry says carefully, testing the waters. It’s still challenging to know what might make Draco snap.
“Pity,” Draco says, removing his own wand from his boot. It isn’t the same one that Harry had given him back after the trials. Draco seems to notice the surprise. “Ten-inch vine wood, thestral tail hair.”
“Mr Malfoy is your partner, I presume,” she noted, adjusting her cat-eyed frames so they sat lower on the bridge of her nose.
He had always been unable to hide his emotions from Pansy, so he didn’t bother much with it anymore. If he had said he was fine, Pansy would’ve smacked him decidedly across the head until he revealed the truth. She could always see through him like he was as transparent as a pane of glass. Harry felt bare and uncomfortable in her presence, but he also welcomed her company. It was nice to know that she knew the real him and not the million other versions that existed to the rest of the world.
Harry had expected a response, and he didn’t mean to be rude, but he was so used to winding Draco up that it had become second nature. Something flashed in Draco’s eyes, though, and it was not pain or anger. He seemed almost forlorn.
Draco nodded eagerly, lust clouding his eyes with a fog, and he beheld Harry with a desire that neither of them had experienced since before their wedding days.
“That’s excellent, Luna. I didn’t know that.” He rested his head back against the stone, breathing in the crisp air that had found its way in from outside.
learn quite a bit, and I am confident in this. The class you will have refashioned will run as scheduled during our second and third terms.” McGonagall paused, as both Harry and Draco looked as they were about to interrupt, “You wouldn’t doubt my decisions, am I correct?”
“Next week, I’ll have lunch with you at the office,” she agreed, wrapping an arm possessively around Harry’s waist. He felt comforted by the press of her long fingers into his side.
And Draco did think about it. He knew a part of his husband had probably died the day he discovered Draco’s body in their bed.
“Ginevra, get a grip. He’s not forcing me to stay. Nothing could make me do that,” Draco said, pacing the room before realising that something likely had.
“Now that we have some privacy, can I ask you the question you’ve been avoiding?” Ginny said, but there was only comfort and affection in her tone. “I know you don’t want to talk about it, but it’s good for you to let these things out. If it’s not with me, I know it won’t be with anyone else.”
When Harry left for work that morning, he was waved off with a kiss to the forehead and a feeling of unconditional warmth. Butterflies fluttered in his stomach, almost like he was falling in love with Draco all over again.
Bookshelves climb high like ivy across the walls, a rosewood desk placed in the middle of the room sits atop a faded, ornate rug. There’s a delicate, wilted rose, floating inside of a bell jar just on the surface.
“You don’t care about yourself enough to get better,” Harry repeats the words back to make sure he’s heard them correctly.
“Well, do you know where he is?” Harry asks again, this time more demanding. He can’t believe Narcissa would remain so apathetic about her own son’s disappearance. Let alone her former Death Eater son. Harry finds himself a little furious that the Ministry wouldn’t keep better tabs. “I would think that you would go find him if you didn’t.”
The room smelled like oak trees and sweat, which was so distinctly Harry that Draco smiled where he usually would have frowned.
Clove sighed, affectionately patting his leg. “Give him time. He’ll come eventually. In the meantime, you have a few other people waiting outside for you, but I don’t want to overwhelm you so early.”
“I can do this,” he said to the mirror once more. “This is normal. All couples have rough sex. I look fine.”
“I’d rather do it myself, Draco. I’ve told you, God only knows how many times.” Harry leaned his weight against the sink and hung his head heavily between his shoulders. He couldn't find the will to turn around.
Draco joined him on the stairs. Their knees knocked together, once, twice, before he moved away, finding solace in a space away from the heat of their bodies. Draco waited expectantly, knowing if he was silent for long enough, Harry would have to fill the emptiness.
“Leave me alone,” Draco said, finding his voice steady and strong at Harry’s mere presence. He could do this.
He opened the French doors, sunshine soaking into his skin for a moment, before plucking the post from between the owl’s beak.
“I’ve been having trouble with some voices in my head,” he said a little quickly, before catching his tongue between his teeth to stop the words.
“I don’t know if this is the best idea for me, ‘Mione, I should probably just go home and think it over a bit. I’m not sure I’m ready—”
“Maybe you should give him some space,” Zabini suggested, gazing disinterestedly at Harry. “Sometimes he just needs a little time to mope.”
“Breakfast first, please.” Ron groaned; his eyes still hooded from sleep. He gave Hermione a gentle kiss anyway, and Harry looked away. He felt like he was intruding, but only for an instant.
“I spent years trying to forget who I used to be. It was like the second I discovered how drugs made me feel, I knew that was the best way I could get past everything that had happened,” Draco says, his gaze focused on the ground. “I wasted much of my time feeling sorry for myself and taking all kinds of things to forget that I existed, that a version of myself like that ever did exist.
“I’m sure he’s not,” Ron says reassuringly. “And you wouldn’t have gone anyways if he asked you there, you know that.”
Hermione has neglected to speak, seemingly stunned into silence, and Harry looks to her for direction.
Harry and the woman finally broke apart, putting space between themselves and facing the bar inconspicuously. Draco sat up in his chair unconsciously, holding back the urge to ask the waitress for something far stronger.
Draco hadn’t considered a relationship with anyone since Harry — he would probably never be ready to — but he enjoyed seeing the friendly faces around him fall in love. His neighbours were all kinds of families that he would’ve hated during the war for no real reason at all. Now they were some of his most interesting and intelligent acquaintances.
Something pained flashed across Draco’s features, and Harry could practically see his internal battle. He was trying to say he couldn’t, but the potion wouldn’t let him. Because, even if Harry treated him like this, there was a small part of Draco that would always want him. They were meant to belong to one another.
“Luna’s,” Draco replied honestly. There wasn’t any significant use in hiding it; it would be easier to maintain a lie if it was a technical truth. Had Severus told him that? Maybe it was his mother. He couldn’t be bothered to remember.
Draco’s gaze snapped up, eyes searching Ginny’s for more information as to how she even knew. Had Harry really told everyone?
Draco frowns, his jaw tightening. He turns back to the tea, beginning to pour the hot water into their mugs. “And why’s that?” he says, tone clipped.
Harry chewed at the inside of his cheek, feeling relief at the release of blood from the soft interior of his mouth. Pent up pressure seeped from the open wound. Ron knocked his boot against Harry’s leg, and only then did he look down and realise he’d been unconsciously shredding the corner of a paper with his fingertips. His nerves were sensitive and raw.
He settled into the fourth seat at the table. Draco reached for Harry’s hand, and he took it. The interaction was surprisingly cold.
Draco pauses for a moment, and Harry wishes he could take the words back. Because while they’re not untrue, the subject is still too sensitive and raw to be prodded at. A blank look crosses Draco’s features, one Harry has come to recognise as something akin to the numbness and disassociation that comes with the drugs. Harry had thought it was strictly limited to when Draco was using, but he seems to let down a mask whenever conversations grow too emotionally taxing, too unsafe.
Harry picked him up and eased him gently onto the bed as though he were as light as a feather. Draco’s eyes met Harry’s, and he couldn’t deny the intensity, the passion that remained between them. It was why they had sex despite all the fighting. Sometimes it was the only way Draco felt like their relationship was still alive and kicking.
“This is a highly potent potion, sir. It is important that you do not share the details of where this was purchased or how you came into possession of it if ever questioned on the subject.” The man regarded Harry with a stern look. “Are we clear?”
Hermione sighed. “Harry, we really thought something terrible had happened, you can’t just scare us like that over a kiss. How was it? Do you like this Oli character?”
Tendrils of Pansy’s magic reached out, inconspicuously toward his mind, and he shoved them back with a vengeful force.
“Let’s apparate to Edinburgh on our own. I’m going to go to a clothing store and investigate the latest trends and styles. Merlin only knows you would be hopeless at that.” Draco said, and his business-like attitude had returned. Harry was discouraged to see the more emotional and open side of his friend already gone. “You should go to a grocery shop and take notes about the Muggles there and what they shop for. Unless you have any better ideas.”
“Harry Potter,” Lavender smiles brightly, reaching out a hand for Harry to take. With her other hand, she casts a charm that removes much of the noise in the room. Harry’s ears ring out in the silence.
He reached for some spare parchment on the table, and after locating a self-inking quill, scrawled out a quick note to Luna. He sent the owl off with a pat and a slice of plum as an incentive to deliver the message extra fast. As much as Lyra loved him, Draco figured she’d take her own sweet time as usual.
After the ceremony, Harry entered the house in preparation to leave but found himself wandering aimlessly through some of the halls. It was easy to imagine why Draco had grown up in the way that he did. Especially when much of his childhood had been tied to a house like this. It wasn’t warm or comforting in the way that The Burrow was. It was intimidating and shockingly bare. He would have imagined garish light fixtures and ornate decorations to adorn the inside of the Manor but found that there was just an immense amount of blank space.
He watched Draco go, admiring the lean lines and sharp angles of his body. Pale skin flushed and red against the sticky summer heat.
, he just needs to sleep. This will make headlines if we call Healers, and what, with Potter here, too? It’s too messy.”
Draco cried out beneath him, and Harry lifted him to sit on the edge of the table. His legs shook as Harry entered him once more, but his eyes rolled back into his head with a pleasure that vibrated throughout his slender body.
“Hi everyone,” she says, sitting up taller in her seat. “I’m Ollie, and I’ve been sober for two weeks.”
“Table?” Harry asked, eyeing the bare hardwood and dreaming about laying Draco down on it and fucking him until neither of them could still see.
They perused the menu in silence for a bit, and Harry was unsure whether to speak and cut through the tension. Draco did anyway, once they had both ordered – Harry asked for Shepherd's pie, and Draco requested a type of fish that Harry had never heard of. Before he could object, Draco had already asked for a bottle of expensive red wine.
“When you first arrived, there was little hope that you were going to make it. Against all odds you pulled through, and we placed you in a magically-induced coma to stabilise your cognitive function and allow your body to heal — to wake up on its own. During this time, we ran some standard tests.” The Healer paused, his eyes imperious.
“Tell me something I don’t know about you,” Harry said unexpectedly, nursing yet another glass of sweet liquor. His eyes were misty, and he enjoyed the warmth of the room edging upon him.
It’s not that Harry had necessarily been privy to every time Draco had used. But he seemed to be in better spirits, spending more endless hours with Harry than back at his home, where he is more likely to take something. And now that Harry thinks of it, he’s never explicitly stated that he wants to quit, and Harry had honestly just assumed he might do it since he has someone to care about him. Which is, by all means, a very selfish assumption.
“Theo, we need to get him to St Mungo’s or call a Healer,” someone says from inside, their voice strained.
The burn hadn’t entirely removed its clutches from the soft tissue of Draco’s brain, but it had certainly eased up. He was surprised that it had allowed him such a respite in the first place. This thistle was a miracle.
Harry feels it come on quickly. The build of pressure in his groin, the pooling of desire just below his stomach. The low pull of his release. He bends over Draco, slowing slightly, fucking him open gently, littering kisses down the length of his chest. With his free hand, Harry wraps his fingers around Draco’s cock, tugging in rhythm as Draco whimpers, undone underneath him.
“You’re probably right. I’m sorry I got all worked up about it. I’ve been feeling very different these past few days and wasn’t sure who to go to,” he said, holding a hand out for Luna. She took it eagerly and squeezed it like a mother would to console an agitated child.
Maybe the voice was doing something good for him. In his previous life, he would have never indulged Harry in weekend exercise or played around with him like they were doing now. They’d done those things in the beginning, of course, but they wore off and disappeared alongside the honeymoon phase. It was nice to feel like they were just children again, but they had each other this time.
Somehow, Harry had convinced him to go on a morning run, followed by a quick ab workout. Draco was not spending his Saturday curled up on the couch with a book and his owl, so he figured the day was already ruined.
He was sure that he would be more nervous in this situation, one that was inevitable from the beginning of his relationship with Draco. But he isn’t. In fact, he’s a bit relieved that they know, and now he doesn’t have to have an actual conversation about it.
“I don’t know,” Draco said, pressing himself tighter into a foetal position, arms folded protectively into his chest. Harry angled gently into Draco’s back with the length of his body. “I can’t tell whether I’m just really good at staying afloat or I’ve already accepted my fate and drowned under the weight of everything.”
what happened,” Draco said suddenly, and there was a small wonder on his face. Surprise, maybe, at the fact that he hadn’t realised how they’d gotten over their argument at all.
Draco is clad in a navy-blue tuxedo that clings to every sharp edge of his body like it is made for him. He usually has his hair gelled into place, especially on workdays, but he’s let it loose a little, and it falls longer around his eyes just like Harry likes it. He’s radiant and beautiful, and Harry wants this image of him burned into the backs of his eyelids.
“Yeah, well, we’ve already established you’re mad,” Draco says, but there’s a faint pink blush appearing on his cheeks. “I just don’t want to put that kind of pressure on someone. Imagine finding out your soulmate used to be a Death Eater: what a disappointment.”
“Yes indeed, and it could kill you,” Ethel says sternly. “It wants to protect you, but it would undoubtedly protect itself first. Please do not take this lightly, Mr Potter. I know how challenging it can be for those raised in the Muggle world to come to terms with something like this. I’ve been working here and matching people since the Ministry opened the program back up, and I've studied soulmate magic for several years. Things can either go very right or very wrong.”
The walls were a grey cobblestone that smelled disturbingly marshy. Moss grew tangled and stretched along each brick’s jagged surfaces as though it inhabited space in the rainy outdoors. The ground itself was the type of spongy wet that Harry hated to step on even in his garden at home. Death lived in the skeleton walls of the cellars.
Draco made a noise of acknowledgment, clearly unsettled by Harry’s truthfulness. His brows furrowed, and he stared intently down at a rough spot on the wooden table.
Luna nodded. “I suppose you’re right. When you think about it, your subconscious is just an expression of your deepest and darkest desires. Your conscious mind decides to either reward the subconscious and give it what it wants or ignore it and keep it at bay.”
“Feels good doesn’t it,” Draco slurs, flexing his fingers in Harry’s hand. “How something so simple, so human, as touch could feel so euphoric is beyond me.”
Instead, this year, Harry had planned a surprise birthday that no one really wanted to attend. Of course, none of his friends would ever say that to his face. But it was clear something was going horribly wrong in their household, and not even Ron or Hermione wanted to get caught in the middle of it.
“Library?” she asked, a little too excitedly. “I wanted to get ahead on some of my assignments for the week.”
It was an unsettling thought that the substance required him to comply with. But it didn’t push him in the way that Draco probably felt. It just sat there, a constant reminder of how terrible a person Harry had become. Ruthless and reckless in his resolve.
“He’s high out of his mind,” Theo says. He leans back on the countertop, and Harry would expect he’s entirely unconcerned if he wasn’t biting at his fingernails like a nervous child. “This isn’t anything new.”
Harry had the decency to look up, surprised at Draco’s concession. He opened his mouth as if to speak, and then closed it again. Draco knew better than to argue with the words inside of his head now.
Summer season for the Aurors was never as busy as expected. Criminals never really stopped being criminals, but things certainly slowed down as the humidity made everyone just the slightest bit lazier. Harry took more days off than he could count, but no one cared too much because who wanted to work in the summer anyway? Draco did, of course. He had left for work early, as usual, after drinking his tea and agreeing to stay with Harry.
When Draco was nice and compliant, it validated Harry even more to continue his terribly unethical actions. Of course, he knew that what he was doing was wrong, but he was in too deep to stop. There was no telling how Draco would react without the potion, and the department had yet to see any users who had been dosed long term. So really, it was a better idea to keep him on it for his own sake.
Harry can barely hear him above the noise, but he watches his lips move. Seamus is saying something about Dean, about his life. He seems happier than the last time they met. Less empty. He watches Seamus mouth something unintelligible before wandering back off the way that he came.
Once the Mediwitch moved away, the stony-faced Healer turned back to face him. “Do you remember why you’re here, Mr Malfoy?”
“Just a headache, yeah?” Ginny eyed him suspiciously, but she seemed dangerously close to dropping the subject, and Draco settled at the reprieve already.
“I did,” Draco said, and his face tightened. Clearly this was a question he had been waiting to ask. “I don’t want to start a fight.”
Draco looks up at him, eyes clear and full. Harry notices then, that their legs are pressed up next to each other on the mattress, fingers intertwined with one another, faces almost too close. His heart thumps away painfully in his chest, as though it might give it out right there. And then Draco pulls back.
“It’s more likely that he’d kill me, you know?” Harry calls after Pansy. She has already hoisted Theo up into her arms and is walking him slowly from the bedroom.
Harry took a breath, grounding himself firmly into reality and extracting himself from a tangle of resentful thoughts that threatened to drown him. “I know that.” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “I know I shouldn't blame Ginny for being a good friend.”
Ron only shrugs, smoothing flat the pair of trousers with the palms of his hands. “They don’t look terrible.”
“I could look at you forever,” Harry says. He can’t resist taking Draco into his arms, planting a gentle kiss on his cheek. The lips will have to, at least, be saved for the ceremony.
The woman was unsettlingly beautiful in every right. Silky black ringlets draped over her shoulders, dry despite the storm wreaking havoc outside. She removed her robes, revealing arms the colour of soft caramel and a delicately accessorised decolletage. Her eyes, a soft mossy green, were positively vibrant despite the dim lighting of the establishment.
“I know you are.” Draco bowed his head. “I don’t want you to think I’m taking you for granted. I’m so lucky to have you to take care of me. I’m grateful that you’re putting up with me through all of this.”
He stepped out of the shower, towelling off wet hair before heading for the bedroom. In pyjamas, Draco was lying underneath the sheets with his wand clutched between his hands and his eyes searching the darkness for an escape. His freshly washed hair was creating a dark spot on the pillow.
There’s a look on his face that indicates nothing less than severe discomfort at the situation, and Harry doesn’t blame him. But his brow is all pinched in a way that makes him look a bit worried, and Harry’s not quite sure what to do next because neither of them is moving to leave.
Harry gaped at her as she glided back to the staircase and turned a corner. He must have been positively smashed if he had hallucinated Luna saying such madness.
Harry sighs, brushing a stray strand of hair away from his face. He’s due for a haircut, as Hermione will soon be pointing out.
A Muggle timer pinged from the countertop, and Harry excused himself to tend to the chicken. With his back turned to his guests at the table, he closed his eyes and forced a deep breath. His panic wasn’t necessarily laden under Draco’s sudden realisation; it was more so directed at Ginny herself, who remained unsatisfied by their answer. Her worries had been quelled temporarily, but what happened when Draco said something or did something entirely out of character? Like, sit in the dirt, for instance. An action so simple, yet so telling.
After he had packed up his things and left, Harry reopened the window, relishing the wind’s biting chill against his face. He wrapped a hand around his neck, the way he had done to Draco so forcefully just that morning, and felt for a pulse. It raced faster than a Firebolt.
Whether Draco knew about the potion and its effects, Harry was unsure. But they were close to mentioning something so unspoken out loud. That neither of them truly had control over their thoughts anymore, and to Harry, that was thrilling.
He cleared his throat instead and beckoned Ron over with one hand. He approached awkwardly as Pansy gathered her things and made a swift exit. She gave Ron an affectionate pat as she passed him but didn’t bother to say goodbye.
Carrow’s eyes darkened at the challenge. He shifted his weight, putting space between Harry and Draco effortlessly and turning to face the person who’d dared confront him. Patrons of the bar held in a collective breath, but Harry’s eyes were unblinking and hard.
“Hi there, Harry.” Luna stood in front of him, the firelight making her platinum hair glow. She looked celestial.
Draco usually stood with a practised elegance, one that had been taught and enforced for a number of his childhood years and characterised him so well.
It had been a week since he’d first encountered Draco at his home, and six days since he’d spilled a drink all over him in the Ministry. Harry’s sure their next encounter will also not go so splendidly, but third time’s a charm.
“Okay, let’s see.” Draco angled his head up towards the mirror, shutting the tap with one hand and drying his face with a quick charm. “My name is Draco Malfoy.”
“What is it, Harry? Why are you so embarrassed of me?” Draco snapped, folding his arms across his chest.
Harry takes a steadying breath before he speaks, knowing that what he wants to ask could push Draco away entirely. But he can’t deny now that he cares for Draco’s well-being. Not only as a soulmate, but as a concerned friend, as well. He wants Draco to be okay.
is scrawled in Harry’s chicken-scratch. If it wasn’t his own handwriting, he’d probably be unable to make out the words and numbers himself.
“Now, Ginny, don’t start this already!” Pansy began, flashing her eyes warningly. “We’ve only just arrived.”
As much as he tries to hide it, he can’t help how his eye is drawn to three long and red scars that tear open the otherwise spotless skin of her cheek. One runs deep and rough, just across her eye.
“You clean up nice,” Ginny says with a laugh, reaching up to ruffle at his hair. Harry doesn’t even mind because he’s barely bothered to tend to it in the first place. If it weren’t for his tuxedo, people might be hard-pressed to realise this is his wedding. “But Draco has you topped.”
Though after a week of empty silences, Harry had decidedly suffered enough. He was playing listlessly with his wand across from the table, and for once, his butterbeer remained untouched. Malfoy peacefully sipped on his own with a neutral expression plastered upon his face.
He didn’t bother to shower, or brush his teeth, or comb his hair. He realizes he hasn't done anything hygienic in the days that passed, but time was blurring together almost comfortingly. It felt consoling to know that the world went on without him.
Harry hardly needed to give him the potion anymore. It was easy enough to sneak into his morning tea once every few days, but it hardly seemed necessary. Draco probably wouldn’t have even questioned it if Harry drugged him right out in the open, as though it were as normal as honey being stirred into his tea. He rarely had the energy to question anything anymore.
“You can’t get angry with me about this, Hermione was in the room with me when I found out,” Harry argues, feeling distinctly defensive of his friends. “And for fuck’s sake, when I literally arrived on your doorstep to tell you, you were high out of your damn mind. Do you think you were really in a state to hear that?”
“I don’t blame you,” Harry says. “I would imagine it’s really hard to take care of anything when you’re in that state.”
Harsh and glaring sunlight streams cruelly through a set of open windows. Harry blearily opens one eye, and then the other, blinking multiple times to clear his vision before realising he’s not wearing any glasses. Reaching blindly for his nightstand, he feels around half-heartedly, fingers searching for his wire frames. As he puts them on, a bedroom comes to view, but one that he certainly doesn’t recognise.
“After the war, when we could finally be together, we rushed things. I know everyone says that jokingly, we moved fast and didn’t take a breath. I used to laugh at it because it was so precisely something we would do. Jump in headfirst without really considering anything else.” He paused, meeting Harry’s eyes, and then staring down at their intertwined fingers. “I was so alone after everything, as I suspect you were too. My parents lived. I’m grateful for that. I know the same can’t be said for so many others. But they were all I had, and then my mother fucked off to a faraway country to escape all this. And my father, who was supposed to be rotting in a cell for the rest of eternity, staged a breakout and disappeared. I don’t blame them, but I felt even more alone than during the war. I went from being smothered with attention and demands to absolutely nothing.”
“Harry, I’m miserable!” Draco shouted, tears leaking from his eyes and down the sides of his cheek like a small child. “I miss being around people, and you cooping me up in this house like a fucking animal isn’t helping me.”
Harry tries not to grow emotional because he doesn’t want to ruin the moment they’re sharing with one another. But it’s hard to be confronted by a harsh reality. His hands, his magic tearing Draco’s chest to shreds.
Draco’s first instinct, to shy away from her touch, was replaced by a sense of gratitude. He felt comfortable around her in the way that he was sometimes comfortable around strangers. There was nothing to answer to. No preconceived notions about his character to be disproven.
As soon as he says the words, he knows they’re the entire truth. Because even this Draco, the flawed, addicted, uncontrollable one with big silver eyes and a huge heart is his soulmate. The person that he wants, no
Even so, he wasn’t sure whether to confide in Harry at all. He would have Draco committed immediately or suggest the involvement of a Mind Healer. Draco would rather be eaten alive by a dragon than lay victim to either of the two options. Rather than deal with it himself.
Oli fixed his eyes on Harry, and his thoughts were etched across his face. Harry didn’t lean away. Oli licked his lips slowly, and there was something hungry in his expression. “So, Harry. We don’t usually have guys like you coming around here. Must be my lucky day.”
Draco kisses Pansy and Theo goodbye; they’re folded together on the couch in the sitting room, an unnamed sitcom playing on the Muggle television. When they step outside, Harry wishes he’d bundled up more. The December chill cuts sharply through his coat, and he wonders how Draco manages the cold with a body that’s only skin and bones.
It’s only then that Harry notices a large paper bag in his hands, filled with what looks like groceries.
“It’s hard work,” Ginny says. “You know how it went with Blaise. I wasn’t happy at all when I found out. I cried myself to sleep for a week because I really thought it would be you.”
He seemed enthusiastic and friendly like a Labrador. Harry let his eyes linger on the athletic man in front of him, fixating on the sharp curves of his muscled shoulders and strong lines of his tanned forearms. He spared a glance at Malfoy, who looked entirely irritated at his ogling.
“Why,” Harry coughs out, despite his healthy physique, heaving as though he’s run a marathon. “What’s wrong?”
He sent the family to the Apparition point and set out to meet Ron. The Auror from earlier gave him an eager salute as he exited, and Harry did everything in his power to hold back an imminent eye-roll.
Harry stumbled into bed that night, confused. Being with Draco had been incomparable to anything he had ever experienced before. He had never known love and lust so intertwined like that. It was as if everyone else had been practice, and this,
“Happy early New Year, Harry,” Luna says, reaching up to give him a soft, chaste peck on the cheek. “Do you have a resolution in mind?”
Ron and Hermione leave his place soon after the conversation, once Harry promises he’s not just going to sit on this new, terrible piece of information and wait for something bad to happen. He’s absolutely certain that he won’t be ready to tell Draco about the soulmates thing any time soon, but he knows something significant needs to change if he wants to keep both of them alive.
It had been the blackest of days in Harry’s life for a while, but he would remember them forever. He promises himself that he'll grow from his losses, and Draco’s death will always mean something to him and to everyone else.
Turning his gaze, Draco focused back upon Harry, who was still alone. He ran his hand through distinctly brown hair, remembering his glamour and letting his nerves buzz in the background. There was no need to be nervous. Harry would never notice, and besides, he was far too occupied to care.
“I agree,” Harry said, uncovering a steaming container of wonton soup. “This smells heavenly, Merlin. Did you make this?”
“I don’t – I don’t feel well,” Draco said, Harry’s touch suddenly smothering him. The comforting cool press of the wall and chilly breeze of the night had been replaced by heat and nausea from somewhere within Draco himself. He could keel over at any moment and empty the contents of his stomach onto Harry’s shoes.
“Don’t I?” Draco smirks, drawing his gaze back up to the sky. He lifts a hand up and points. “That’s my constellation.”
Harry found himself frightened by the thought that his marriage would continue down a loveless path. He worried even more that neither of them wanted to be unemotional, but were unsure the other was thinking the same thing. A small part of Harry hoped that was the case, because that would mean Draco still cared for him in the way he had before.
The gash on his cheek is completely gone. Clearly, he’d been taking care of it, and Harry hates that he’s pleasantly surprised by that.
“Something you don’t know about me...” Draco’s eyes fixated distractedly on the light fixture above them as he toyed Harry’s question around in his mind. “Well, I quite like spending time with you even though I probably shouldn’t. You go around kissing other people in front of me, and you call me a prat, so that’s not ideal either.”
They fall back asleep; the only sounds in the room are from the fire Harry eventually lights, crackling warmly in the hearth.
Harry wakes to fingers prodding insistently at his side. His sore eyes snap open quickly, and the room is dark. The curtains aren’t drawn, and the sun is still slung low in the grey sky. It must still be very early.
Carrow’s burly fingers brushed over the outline of Draco’s cock from underneath the table. It jumped underneath his touch, but Draco willed it to settle.
“As usual.” Harry cut his eggs into bites, hoping his thoughts weren’t painted on his face. He focused on the running yolk instead. When he gathered the nerve to look up, Draco had already moved on to the morning paper.
He stepped off from the bed, letting his bare feet meet the cold hardwood. Draco had left the window curtains open, again, and Harry felt a familiar tug of irritation pull at his stomach. A small, mean part of him hoped that the sunlight would wake him unpleasantly in the morning. It was pink outside still, but amber rays would stream through the glass eventually.
Harry had been too busy with an unexpected caseload to do much outside of stay at the office late each evening and grab takeout meals with Ron. He’d want to prioritise seeing Draco, but Robards had kept a close eye on him. There wasn’t really a moment where he could’ve made something work, even during the supposed holiday.
Draco felt his arousal pool unwillingly in the pit of his stomach. He wanted Harry alone as much as he wanted to avoid being alone with him. But he knew this wasn’t right.
A large crash wakes Harry quickly. He stretches in place and knocks into his glasses as he goes to rub his eyes. The book lays folded open, abandoned on his chest. It’s still dark outside, and the moon is higher in the sky than he expects it to be.
“I went to his house, if you could even call it that, and he just happened to be having a party. Seamus let me in and I, well, I spent the night.”
“Really?” He asked, walking up to a bust that was strikingly beautiful. He wanted to reach out and drag his finger along the delicate arch of its nose. The docent at the door glared at him, and Harry took a deliberate step back in surrender.
For a moment, he thought he’d spoken the words aloud. And, well, he had meant to. But they stuck inside of him, gluey like Honeydukes’ treacle fudge.
He startled at the fact that the potion let him say it. The thistle seemed to be working, even if it was doing the bare minimum required of it.
“I hate the word,” Harry says quietly. “I don’t just want to be the person that saves everyone else.”
crazy,” Hermione began, pulling away from Harry to press against Ron instead. “I had a meeting with Angelina yesterday, and we decided to approve all the plans for the Minister’s first official international conference and —”
He steps off from the Apparition point, realising he probably looks exactly the way he feels when he becomes victim to stares from many onlookers. He stumbles out into the main lobby, resolving to reach his office as quickly as possible and cover up his rumpled clothing with uniform robes.
leave me,” Harry said, this time his voice a little more uncertain where it had been confident just seconds earlier.
“Nice to meet you,” Harry said, holding out his hand clumsily. Oli glanced at it and then back up at Harry, and his eyes glinted just a bit. He wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder instead and walked him off. The other boys followed behind like puppies, asking Malfoy questions about his accent. They said they didn’t have British visitors around here often.
Draco is doubled over the toilet, eyes closed as shallow breaths puff from his small body. His slender arms wrap around the bowl, clutching the edges like they are a lifeline.
“I’ve only seen you a handful of times,” Harry reasons. He sits up from the headboard, facing Draco head on. “But I would argue those times are worth much more than what you're willing to give them.”
Draco’s gaze grew colder, but it was turning to exasperation rather than pure resentment. Harry could tell. They had reached Downtown Perth, and while it was still quiet, Muggles littered the streets; either heading home from the workday or ducking in and out of quaint shops for forgotten errands. Harry found the sudden crowdedness of the narrow road reminded him a little of Diagon Alley. Though it was definitely less lively, he found it comforting and quite lovely. Draco didn’t seem to mind it either, and Harry watched his eyes flick between people and buildings. There was much to look at after the empty streets they were first greeted by.
“You’re telling me you’d just go find him in the middle of the day, and you two would have a civil conversation over some tea and biscuits?” Ginny says dubiously. “Call me crazy, but I just don’t believe that’s how that would go.”
After a few hours, he exited the station at King’s Cross, only a handful of stops away from where he had started, and Apparated home.
Harry found himself growing defensive, but forced a deep breath because he wanted his best friend, of all people, to understand. “Not that you bothered to take any notice, but the war changed all of us. There’s no point in going back to the way things were before! I’m tired of pointless rivalries, all for what? If this is how you’re going to act, then it seems like
“This is hopeless,” Harry sighed, taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes. “I’m getting nothing from this at all!”
“Is Draco expecting you?” Theo says, raising an eyebrow and shivering as a gust of wind pulls the door shut.
“I love you,” Draco said. He meant it most of the time, but other times he said it to appease the voice inside of his head to which he had somehow become a slave.
Narcissa raises an eyebrow, but then beckons him inside to follow. They turn down a hallway before she’s drawing him into a sunroom, although it is far too grey outside to be considered as such.
“He forgot to take them to the tailor.” Hermione shakes her head, a certain fondness in her tone. “God alone knows why I married this man.”
Draco catches his bottom lip in his teeth, biting until crimson droplets of blood breach the surface. Harry wipes them away with his thumb.
Still, the room is just as cosy and welcoming as the foyer. Large leather couches, walls of bookshelves, and hovering candles remind him, in the strangest way, of the Gryffindor common room.
Clove levitated him quickly, placing him gently back onto the bed. Draco went still, realising he’d been thrashing before. Narcissa was at the corner of the bed, a hand furled protectively around Draco’s bare, bony ankle.
A moment of silence endures between them as Harry applies the last of the potion. The air in the room is charged with electricity, thick with unfamiliar tension.
Harry’s chest feels heavy with anguish. “D’you know what he said to me when he realized he was dying?”
“Well, really, I don’t want anything, Auror Potter. Knowing I have you wrapped around my littlest finger is just enough for me,” Locke said, eyes blinking innocently and theatrically.
A few months ago, Harry would have cringed at the sight of it. Now, he was accustomed enough not to care.
He’d grown to love his friends in the years after his separation from Harry. They’d been his support system, his foundations.
, it was just that Malfoy got all upset afterward and then he left. And back at school, he yelled at me for taking him there.”
Still, he wouldn’t qualify them as best friends. The past thirteen years had taught him that Hermione and Ron filled those slots, even if they were a little too busy with their own lives to remember sometimes.
The shopkeeper from Harry’s usual apothecary sat back in his chair, regarding him with a toothy and knowing smile.
“Carrow,” Draco warned, his voice a weak echo in his ears. He realised a second too late that his status as a Malfoy wouldn’t communicate itself across the guise of a glamour. He wasn’t safe.
Their kitchen now was bleak and a little dusty. Usually they ate dinner separately, both at work. Harry never really had to. The Aurors typically required a hard stop on the work day at six in the evening, but he found eating takeout at his desk less depressing than a home-cooked meal at an empty table.
“What do you think my mother is doing tonight?” Draco asks, leaning back against the headboard. His hands are in his lap, where he’s tracing patterns across the spine of a novel.
“You’re never sick, Draco. In the years I’ve worked with you, you have never once skipped a single day.” Ginny placed her hands on her hips, eyes ablaze with fury. “You’re going to tell me what’s going on right this instant.”
“Is something the matter, Potter?” His eyes flicked between the magazine in his hands and back to Harry.
From the front steps of Draco’s bizarre cottage, Harry, despite protests from his body, Apparates directly to the Ministry.
“Ginny, we really shouldn’t have left this all to the last minute.” Harry sighed, eyeing the crowds around them distastefully.
Draco’s shoulders tighten a bit, and he sits up straighter on the barstool. His eyes remain focused on his bowl. “Not really.”
Harry nodded his head. It was a... half-truth? He had been with Ginny sexually, but he’d never been with a man before, not like this.
yes, Merlin.” Draco littered swears into the area, slowly rising up and down on top of Harry. Of course, Draco would be a loud shag, Harry thought. Beads of sweat trickled down his torso as Harry pulled steadily at Draco’s cock in sync with Draco’s movements. He was witnessing something absolutely filthy, and he wished he could die, with the image of Draco so full like this, etched into his memory forever.
Harry takes a step forward and cringes immediately as he realises his mistake. He knows he’s been made when he shifts his weight, the floorboards letting out an agonised creak. The door swings open, and Pansy pokes her head through the threshold.
“Truthfully, I’m unsure. My owls deliver him messages, but they never return with responses. I assume he’s receiving my correspondence, but I don’t want to pester him.”
“You know,” Pansy makes her way toward them, perching herself delicately on the edge of Theo’s bed. “I honestly thought last night was an entire hallucination, and Harry Potter hadn’t strolled into our house and made himself right at home.”
“Say something to me.” Draco demanded; his tone was blasé, but his eyes were luminous with curiosity. He sat up straighter against the apple tree.
Clove came closer, resting delicate fingers atop the side of the bed. Draco knew It was the closest gesture of comfort she could offer with his mother at his side.
“I should be in Azkaban.” He says forcefully, and with cold resolve. “I deserve to be there for my entire life.”
Cooking had always been relaxing to Harry. Something about chopping vegetables and drizzling olive oil and stirring things in a pan was soothing and formulaic. Draco always liked using his wand, letting foods chop themselves. It was reminiscent of the Burrow in some ways, when Harry would return home and see Draco sprawled out at the table while sliced bread floated itself into the Muggle toaster. Harry never cared much for the magic of cooking, though it was fascinating to watch. He preferred to have control over the ingredients himself.
"Draco, I —" Harry said, intending to apologise for his behaviour. For the potion's behaviour, really. Not his.
He opens his gift from Molly last, a deep blue knitted jumper with a yellow lettered D stitched into the fabric. Harry’s mouth hangs open.
The next evening, they were lying in the garden on the wild feather grass that blanketed most of the space, enjoying the last few moments of the day before the sun went down. Early August humidity was still characterising much of the weather, but Harry had convinced Draco to come outside for a moment. To take in the fresh air, the oxygen from the plants, the beautiful sunshine. Draco had done so unwillingly, and curled up on the blanket next to Harry as though it were cold out.
He climbs them slowly, taking care to balance himself on the railing. When he reaches the landing, there’s hardly any light except for some that seeps out from under the crack of the first door he sees.
“Sir.” The man cleared his throat from behind Harry, who startled at the sound. “We have something new today.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione exhaled. “What Ron is trying to say is that we know you and Malfoy are involved.”
“Right this way, Mr. Potter,” she says brightly, leading him down a hallway just as sterile and empty as the waiting room. In a strange way, it reminds him of King’s Cross Station on the night of the battle. All white.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Draco mumbled, finding his voice coming out quieter than he had intended.
“You weren’t paying attention to me.” Harry shrugged as though it were a simple explanation and Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Harry reaches forward, plucking a small, thumb-sized plastic baggie from the surface of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s
It’s quieter in here, Harry notices, and the sound of thumping music is fading into background buzz. Luna is sitting cross-legged on the counter, organising bottles of alcohol by height and colour.
Malfoy looked down at his clothes, his gaze ridiculing his own appearance. His wand was out in a second, and he was back in uniform robes. Harry had temporarily forgotten how strange it was to see Malfoy wearing, of all Muggle clothing items, a sweatshirt.
When he thought about it, though, Harry hadn’t necessarily convinced him. He’d offered, and the annoying tic at the back of Draco’s mind had actively forced him to go unless he wanted to sit at home with a splitting headache.
Harry narrowed his eyes, but curiosity swirled around his magic, making him feel alight with energy and trepidation. He inclined his head, as if to say,
Harry forgot about such distractions soon after class began. He found Slughorn to be a thousand times more interesting than Snape, bothering to listen during lectures rather than slack off as he had used to do. In class, they focused on healing potions that were quick to brew and easy to make. Harry wished he’d had knowledge of these earlier, thinking back to his time in the Forest of Dean. Hermione would have appreciated the additional information as well.
mouse!” His trick worked easily in the summer, but in the winter, he’d have to return to the Magical Menagerie to buy mice himself.
Harry gathered his courage and set his utensils down. The potion ought to have taken effect. “I know we haven’t talked much about yesterday.”
The man’s eyes widen, and he adjusts his healer robes uncomfortably before silently exiting from the way he came. Within seconds, multiple people enter the room in quick succession casting diagnostic spells and asking him questions. One shines wand light directly into his eyes, and he struggles to keep still.
A flickering candle on his bedside temporarily illuminates a sad, torn grimace upon Draco’s mouth. And even then, Harry thinks he still might be the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
“What’s all the noise?” he asks, amused. Catching sight of his wife across the room, his eyes sparkle and Harry’s heart aches.
They ate dinner in silence, punctuated by Draco asking if he could do anything useful or get Harry something else. Harry said, “No, thank you” every time, even though something inside him wanted to let out a feral cry and just shove Draco from his chair for even trying.
“Please,” he mumbles, face pressed tired against the door, his weight leaning heavily into its smooth surface. His leg is injured somewhere, but he can only feel the pain thrumming through his bones and up to his spine. He can’t see anything.
Upon the first bite, the creamy cherry danish coated Draco’s tongue in sugar, eliciting a cheer from his taste buds. At the second one, he wasn’t quite as eager. How unusual, he thought, feeling around his stomach experimentally with a finger. He was rather full and had forgotten the fact that he’d consumed an entire breakfast that morning.
“Well, from what I know, it’s supposed to get you high.” Draco said, “and after our little debacle today with your unsightly friend, we might need just that.”
“Ron, you’re going to give me a migraine,” Hermione is saying, pressing her fingers angrily into her forehead. “You are
Ron rolls his eyes and gives him a shove as they enter their office. They’ve been partners for years, and the majority of the time, Harry is grateful for it. But he also knows that even with the maximum amount of distractions, Ron will push until he knows where Harry had been the night before. It is probably best to simply come clean.
Harry wonders on the words for a moment, curious to know if there was ever a time that Draco fantasised about his soulmate the way the Weasleys did. If he romanticised it like so many other people or shoved it to the side like Harry chose to do. The latter seemed more plausible, because if he’d bothered to find out, Draco would already know why Harry was in his life so often now.
Lyra chirped contentedly from her perch, and Harry didn’t have to turn around to know that someone else had entered the room. He hastily shoved the vial back into the spice drawer and brought the cups to the table. Lyra settled on Draco’s shoulder like a soldier, chest puffed out and eyes staring warily at Harry.
After dinner, Draco sent the dishes to clean themselves, and Harry held his tongue from complaining. He often found himself staying in the kitchen to do the washing up just to avoid interaction with Draco. Now, if they were both really committed to fixing things, that would be unnecessary and unfair. Instead, Draco suggested a film.
Ron makes a face as Harry leaves the office. He’s glad to be walking a bit because his stiff limbs feel better when they’re moving. He’s noticed since seeing Draco that he’s physically feeling better. While his mood is nowhere near where it usually is, still, there’s something about his body that feels like it has somehow bounced back. He’s hungover, but he feels healthy and strangely complete for the first time in a bit.
“Mr Marchand,” Harry amended, and Capucine looked at him with silent thanks in her expression. “I have a few questions if you don’t mind. I understand you must want to be home, but it would be really helpful if I could learn a bit more about Pauline.”
“It feels like everything in my life, the good and the bad, fall away into nothing. And every worry, hope, or fear I’ve ever had is gone, and it’s just me alone with my high.” Draco inhales and then exhales. “Basically, it feels really fucking good.”
not spend the rest of my life around the git just to satisfy some ancient wizarding practise. That hardly seems fair.”
“I’d like to make something with these,” Draco said, pulling another pepper from its stalk. “I can cook if you don’t want to.”
Locke had the decency to look startled for a moment, likely surprised by the Golden Boy’s outburst. He probably never expected Harry to put up much of a fight.
He thanked the waitress and held the drink up in greeting towards the man, who returned the gesture.
Harry felt his blood curdle at the thought. “So how has it been affecting me, then?” He managed, breaths growing ragged.
In the weeks that Draco had been in the hospital and the potion had worked itself out of his body, Harry had been met with a withdrawal of his own. Locke’s words had stuck with him for some time. He knew the potion had influenced his emotions, fixated on his temper and amplified it. Sobering up from it had been an intense shock.
“I think being good at everything is stupid,” Harry says. “It’s best to focus on something that drives you and perfect it, instead of trying to do everything all at once.”
After purchasing his Dreamless Sleep, he Apparated back to Diagon Alley, outside of the bakery. Madam Odessa mildly glanced up at his appearance. She gave him a sharp look, tinged with distrust, and he wondered if she could somehow see through his disguise. Harry pushed the worry away instead. He walked away, subtly unglamouring his features as he went. There was no time to deal with trivialities such as irritable bakers.
“Nothing makes us as lonely as our secrets,” Harry speaks quietly, his voice just above a whisper. “But no, I won't.”
“Harry, what were you doing in there?” Draco asked, his voice drowned by the sound of rain against the pavement.
Harry could take on Locke easily in the room alone — if it boiled down to a physical aspect, Harry had the smaller man beaten by ages. They’d relinquished their wands at the doors anyway to a particularly grumpy and caffeine-deprived midday guard.
It was no secret that Malfoy had left London soon after the war. He stayed for a while, as many Death Eaters had chosen to. To be close to the Ministry, to prove they weren’t planning on crossing another line. But, as Harry knew all too well, crimes against former members of the dark side were hardly regarded as crimes at all. London still is, and may always be, too dangerous.
Harry wanted to melt in the ground out of embarrassment and was ready to drag Malfoy away so they could make a quick exit when one of the men broke out into a toothy smile.
There’s a warm fire crackling away in the hearth and sounds of soft classical music stream from somewhere upstairs. Yellow light pours down from ornate sconces, casting the room alight in a soft glow.
“Draco,” Harry says, surprised, moving forward on the bed to sit closer to him. “I didn’t mean to upset you.”
For now, Harry acted oblivious and happy, and was planning to enjoy the bliss for as long as he possibly could. There was time for all the problems later.
It was so atypical that it almost nauseated him. His husband adored the poetry behind dramatic behavior and heavy sarcasm. It was almost sacrilege to see him act in any other way. The man sitting next to him could have been any nice-enough bloke from off the street corner; it would never be the person Harry wanted it to be. Was that person long gone? He didn’t know.
Their fights were usually screaming matches that ended with whoever could be the loudest. Something about the silent animosity characterising the room was more chilling.
So, with a strong resolve, he leans over to prod at the person next to him. Harry had figured he’d have to do it a couple times, but the person startles quickly.
“I kind of have to see him. The idiot is my soulmate,” Harry whispers like he is saying something illegal. In plenty of ways, the words are almost worse.
“I suggest next time you give thinking a try.” Zabini’s words were harsh, but Harry knew he needed to hear them. “You and your little Gryffindor friends may not think so, but we suffered through the war too. We are people too.”
Harry turns back inside, and his amusement at the situation disappears quickly as he sees the used syringe and first aid kit abandoned on the coffee table in the sitting room. It was easy to pretend that Draco was sleeping over as a friend might after staying too late. But when the reality of the situation is staring him right in the face, he’s unable to push the trauma of it all away.
When they were younger, Draco might have dropped his things right there and ran into Harry with the force of a wild Bludger, all for the sweet relief of an embrace. Now, he merely walked over and kissed Harry at the corner where the skin of his forehead met his eyebrow.
“So what was that all about?” Ginny asked through a mouthful of pastry. “Honestly, it’s like she wants to be your mother.”
Harry shook his head stubbornly, feeling heat rise through to his cheeks. “No, you haven’t. We need to have some tea, and we can settle everything. Please just come inside with me. Don’t you want tea?”
“No, I-well, I just would prefer something more private. I can ask McGonnagall if we could have permission to work in Hogsmeade maybe?”
“So, her state of mind was different in the most recent weeks, then?” Harry said, directing his question at Capucine.
It was over in a second, as Draco cried out and felt his release soak the bottom of his t-shirt. Moments later, Harry did the same and pulled himself gingerly out of Draco.
Harry smiled into a glass of water, and set it down on the counter to prepare plates. He slid one across the table, as he usually did for breakfast. But something about the fact that they were sharing an evening meal together felt more intimate than it had before.
His hands worked mechanically underneath him, setting the kettle to boil and preparing the rest of their breakfast. He set the eggs out on the table, but they were fresh out of their usual country loaf. Draco would be irritable that there was no toast...unless.
Ron stomped off, though Hermione lingered behind for a moment. “Harry, I’m going to support you no matter who you’re with because I love you. Just tell us next time. You don’t have to sneak around, we’re your best friends.” She followed behind Ron hastily.
Ron agrees, sniffling, his arm tightly hooked into Harry’s as though he’s reluctant to let go. “Best mates for life, yeah?”
“What’s that?” Draco asked, his mouth slack and soft against the bedsheets. Consciousness slipped from his grasp before he could hold onto it, and the welcoming arms of sleep outstretched to pull him under.
“You know that’s a good thing,” Draco points out. “To be the person that sacrifices themselves for others.”
“Do you know why you are here, Harry?” Dumbledore asks him mildly but firmly. Still maintaining intense eye contact with the boy.
Sounds from the kitchen of Harry cooking didn’t seem to bother him like they used to, and he struggled to understand why. He’d always loved that Harry was a morning person — at least one of them was. But he’d grown up with quietness, and appreciated the stillness of a slow start. Harry, on the other hand, jumped into the day like there was nothing more exciting for him to do, and Draco grew to despise it.
Harry sat on the armchair, the one that, despite years of wear, remained functional. Splayed in his lap was a copy of something by Jack Kerouac, a Muggle author that Seamus mentioned enjoying. He couldn’t be bothered to flip the book on its frontside and relearn its title. Travel fiction was, admittedly, a boring genre, but at least he was doing something productive with his evening.
The note, citing a new supplier, sat inconspicuously on the tabletop. Harry took it quickly, feeling the weight of it settle into his pocket as he shoved it in.
“I don’t believe that.” Harry shook his head, removing a porcelain plate from the stack next to the sink and scrubbing away leftover cake with a sponge. He needed something to do with his hands.
The blonde rolled his eyes, wiping the corner of his mouth gingerly with a napkin as he pushed away from the table. “I thought we could be courteous about this, instead of sniping at each other like first years. But clearly, I shouldn’t have expected so much from you.”
Blaise kisses the tip of her nose before stepping back to stand next to Harry. He offers his arm, and Harry takes it, although he’d probably prefer to Apparate alone instead of subjecting himself to a Side-Along. Harry’s stomach has never much liked this mode of transport, and it always feels worse to be Apparated by someone else.
“Great, then I have our first research outing planned for the weekend.” Malfoy announced, clearing his things from the table briskly, “Meet me after lessons at the library.”
Draco’s cock bobbed out enthusiastically, and Harry had to suppress a groan. Of course, it would be long and lean and perfect, everything about Malfoy was fucking perfect. Harry teasingly licked over the tip and tasted pre-come against his tongue. Draco was writhing beneath him. He swiped his tongue once more over the blonde, letting the salty taste sit heavy on his taste buds.
“Do you want breakfast?” Harry asks. He begins to sit up, realising that he’s still in yesterday’s clothing. Somehow, it feels wrong and makes the night even more real than it already is.
Draco’s stomach turned because the statement was true. Among the warm faces and familiar conversation at the pubs of Diagon Alley, an encounter like this would hardly have broken out in the first place. Here, they had been the ones to trespass upon Carrow’s hunting ground. And by the way other people had dutifully turned their backs on the display, it was clear that he sustained the upper hand. If Carrow took Draco now, if he did brutal things to him, he’d get away with it.
Harry leapt to his feet; the blood rushed to his head, forcing him to take a beat before moving forward. He felt trapped in a dream state, moving slower than he intended to but unable to go any faster — sluggish against the impenetrable wall of time.
he calls into the darkness, but only a hoarse scratched noise emerges from his throat, like a cat with cut vocal cords.
“It’s not,” Ron shakes his head. “But magical cores can’t survive for long without their partners. He’s being selfish, putting you both at risk like this.”
“Are we ready to start?” Molly asks, encouraging, pulling Draco in with an arm. She gives him a warm smile.
Shacklebolt cleared his throat into the silence, and if it was even possible, everyone straightened up a little more.
No one else would have made a statement like that for fear of upsetting Draco, but he appreciated that Ginny treated him quite normally. After all, they both knew Narcissa was stationed safely in Norway tending to a beautiful garden and spending her free time with a herd of purebred Granian horses. She was happy with her quiet existence, and Draco was even happier for her. She deserved it after a lifetime of misery.
Harry tries to hold himself back, but he finds himself unable to and wraps his arms around her then and there. They cry together. He wants to get on his knees and apologize to her until he has no voice left at all. But he knows the best he can do for Narcissa is to keep her promise. Harry already knows he will.
Pansy sighed, pushing her soup to the side. She looked weary and tired, as though Harry’s presence for mere moments alone had drained her of any semblance of happiness. He hated that he had that effect on her, when Pansy did quite the opposite to him.
“I thought nobody would ever forgive me for what I did,” Draco said, his tone even as if stating a fact.
Harry doesn’t necessarily disagree, but they’re not children anymore. It has been a couple of years since the war.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, breath catching in his throat. He coughed a few times before allowing Locke to continue.
Harry’s just gotten home from work after a gruelling Monday when he hears a knock on his door. He’s not expecting Ron or Hermione, or anyone for that matter, but knows most of his friends would choose to use the Floo anyway.
So, on Thursday morning, when he entered the Great Hall and sat at his table with his friends, he hadn’t expected to look up and meet familiar grey eyes.
Harry paced the length of the kitchen, extracting the blue vial from his jeans. Maybe he would give something new a try in the morning.
Draco opens his mouth and then closes it again, and apart from Percy and Oliver’s baby son babbling in the corner, the room is thick with silence.
The lock clicked open, the door still firmly shut. Harry reached out, steadying himself against the handle with a breath, before pushing in.
“Would it?” Draco said mindlessly, fixing his eyes on a place away from Harry’s. The floor perhaps, a few feet ahead.
with small fondant serpents moving about the surface. Draco would, no doubt, find it a little tacky. But if he knew it was Ginny’s doing, he wouldn’t dare complain.
“Draco is gone.” Snape amends, bowing his head a bit and allowing just the tiniest hint of sadness to crease the lines in his face. If one were not looking for it, they would never notice. “He was a good boy, a perfect one, really. He just grew up in the wrong circumstances.”
Harry finds himself blinking away tears, and Narcissa does the same. He knows what she poses is not a question. She removes a handkerchief from her coat and offers it to him.
“How long till they classify this cold?” Ron asked, changing the subject whenever it strained too heavy in the room.
Hermione’s eyes widened, but her mouth remained shut in a tight line. “Ron, I don’t think he is kidding.”
He taps out a few pink diamond-shaped pills into his palm and holds one out for Harry. He takes it without really thinking twice, examining its figure between his thumb and forefinger.
Ginny pinched the bridge of her nose. “I just wish you could see, especially after all of this, that being with him is killing you.”
“Cocaine and ketamine are some of my most valuable acquaintances,” Draco says listlessly, eyes closing as he leans further back into his high.
“Maybe you are coming down with something,” Harry mused, his brow furrowing in concern. He reached a hand up and touched it to Draco’s forehead. “You’re a bit warm.”
Harry took a wary step back, as Zabini and the unidentified boy turned to look at him too. Zabini snapped his fingers and whispered something under his breath, and the kid bolted back between the walls.  With both of their gazes pouring like heavy concrete over his body, Harry felt especially small.
They exited the DMLE, taking the lift down to the Ministry’s cellars, where criminals were temporarily housed before their court hearings or interrogations.
Harry followed Zabini out into a short hallway at the far side of the room. He took a sharp left, but Harry was still at his heels as they approached an ornate black door.
“Ron?” Harry mumbled, feeling around the nightstand for his glasses. When he managed to wrangle them onto his face, his best friend sat cautiously on the edge of his bed.
“You’re not wrong,” Draco said because she wasn’t. He appreciated that she was direct without being unkind. “But I have a feeling —” he scratched a spot on the back of his neck uncomfortably “— something isn’t right.”
“I think I loved him.” Harry says suddenly, his own words catching him off guard. He feels quickly embarrassed at the revelation.
“It’s complicated,” Harry says quietly, unsure if he’s ready to divulge any information to Narcissa just yet. If it would help him access Malfoy, then maybe, but he’s not entirely certain how she’ll react to the news.
Fear was plainly evident on Harry’s face because Malfoy’s smile grew wider and wider. As if this were all a sick joke at Harry’s expense. He knew how unbearable it was to have Malfoy in control, and he also knew that Malfoy could sense that. But it wasn’t as though he had any better ideas to counter with.
After a moment, he felt Draco’s lean arms wrap around him, smelling familiar cologne. It took many moments, but his breathing slowed as hands ran through his hair gently and habitually. This routine was far too common in the year after the war, but it had been a while since Harry needed to be calmed down like this. A small patch of Draco’s button-down was wet with tears, and he half expected him to yell for ruining a newly pressed shirt. He stiffened instinctively in Draco’s foreign grasp.
“Technically this isn’t your house,” Theo mutters, and then swats Pansy away as she tries to ruffle his hair.
“I think there’s a lot to talk about,” Draco said, approaching Harry at the counter until they were only inches apart.
In the kitchen, Harry lost himself in the chopping of various fruits they had grown in the garden that year. Summer was the ideal time for their peaches and plums, and Harry heaped the sliced stone fruits into glass bowls with cream on the side.
There are no purpled bags under his eyes anymore, no pointy cheekbones protruding sharply from the skin of his cheeks. His eyes don’t look hollow and set too deep into his face, but rather burst with a soft, quiet kind of intensity that only Draco can claim as his. He’s so beautiful, Harry thinks, no matter what he looked like before, or will in the future. But he’s so healthy and happy, and those are the only things Harry really needs in his life.
Draco’s eyes flashed something hostile, but his emotions schooled themselves quickly on his face. He seemed shocked at the abrupt change in body language.
He Summons the lube from the bedside table, and it clatters out noisily from the drawer. He drizzles a fair amount onto his fingers before slicking up Draco’s hole, encouraging him open in lazy circles. Draco hisses as Harry presses a first finger in, and then slowly a second.
“He’ll come when he’s ready, Draco. You know I can’t force him.” Clove sighed, propping herself up on the edge of the bed. “He’s here every day, though.”
Blaise and Draco were not nearly as close as they had been during their Hogwarts days, in large part because the former had managed to turn his life entirely around. Ginny, at least to Harry’s knowledge, hadn’t shared the whole soulmates debacle between him and Draco because it wasn’t her place. And they had all learned the hard way that Slytherins loved to gossip.
Harry emerged from the cottage, admiring the garden cosmos that peppered their front lawn. They were pink, insignificant little things, but Harry had a soft spot for flowers nonetheless. He had wanted to grow more after planting them, but Draco said they looked cheap and messy. Of course, Harry disagreed and planted more anyway. If everything went according to plan, they’d have sunflowers in a few weeks.
Harry glanced down at the bunch and wondered why. If anything, they reminded him entirely of Draco. They were small and white, and impossibly delicate. He breathed in the scent of warm honey and citrus, enjoying how sweet it made the air around him smell. When Harry broke his gaze from his gift to say thank you, Draco was already gone.
The coil disappears silkily into the parchment before returning just seconds later, wrapped around another. The second coil is significantly smaller, glowing much softer than Harry’s own, and more of a faded and dim yellow to his burning orange.
The week passed in a blur of classes and commotion, but Malfoy was an expert at avoidance. They only had potions together for the term, and Harry figured this was McGonagall’s doing, considering she was already forcing them to spend more of their time together working on the project. Dumbledore wouldn’t have even spared him that. During morning lessons, Harry found himself trying to catch Malfoy’s eye, but the boy always rushed from the classroom as though there were something urgent he needed to attend to. His Slytherin groupies followed close behind, and Harry refused to go near them. They still convened at the Three Broomsticks after class, but Malfoy routinely cast silencing charms around himself as they poured over previous Muggle studies textbooks. Harry could never get a word in edgewise. What started as pure annoyance on Harry’s part was turning into outright fear. He worried Malfoy would never speak to him again.
“Oh, I didn’t buy anything from the grocery store. I didn’t realize you wanted to–” Harry started, but Draco waved at him evasively to quiet down. Harry’s mouth snapped shut.
side of Draco. He knew it was there somewhere, underneath all the other bullshit that plagued their lives. But Harry could tell already that Draco would always be more like Narcissa than Lucius, and he loved him more for it every day.
Draco retrieved his phone again, this time dialling Pansy. The novelty of just speaking to someone for no reason still hadn’t worn off.
Harry coughs awkwardly and leaves the question in the air before trying to cover himself. “Yes, er, of course, I know that.”
Clove shook her head, clearly hiding amusement. “I’m saying that milk thistle could be extremely beneficial in your recovery, and I think there’s no harm in giving it a try.”
A distinct chill settled over the small valley that their cottage was settled in, and Harry went cold. Something was wrong. He looked around as though the answer to what felt off was waiting for him by the willow tree in the corner, or the chocolate cosmos in the bush to Harry’s left side. But all of his plants were still and unmoving in the wind, and somehow that felt...wrong.
“Hi,” Draco said, kissing the fabric of Harry’s shirt gently. He found himself startled by the unfamiliar intimacy of touch.
They began walking, as the decorations for the party were first on the list. Ginny held a small piece of parchment in her hands so she wouldn’t forget, but Harry had not bothered to come prepared at all.
“Oi, shoes off the desk. Proudfoot will wring me by the ears if she sees you!” Harry gave Ron a gentle shove, and he complied.
He’s gone in, and instantly Harry is alone by the water. It is only a second before heaving sobs rip through his body. He sits again, with his head between his legs, and cries indelibly at the ground. When his tears dry out, and his eyes are sore, he’s on all fours dry heaving. He can tell there is not much in his body to throw up beside the potions administered at St. Mungo’s. Those are out of his digestive system in an instant. He lays like that for endless hours, covered in his own sick staring at the burning bright sky. The grief is washed away by a perpetual numbness, that almost feels even more restricting and inescapable. At least before, he was feeling something, feeling human. Now, he perceived as though he could do absolutely anything, and it wouldn’t matter. He seriously considers letting himself just drown in the lake, savoring the feeling of water in his lungs, but staves off the idea. He cannot picture being able to stand up for a while. Eventually, the sky fades down to a gentle orange, and then to black. He manages a few hours of sleep before he is being shaken lightly.
“Draco, ah fuck, I’m gonna–” Harry thrust hard inside of Draco until he finished, coming with a drawn-out moan as a kaleidoscope of sensation exploded from inside him. He felt so unbelievably close to Draco, and something unspoken and ethereal bloomed from within his chest. This was more than just sex.
Harry sits, stunned into silence for a while, reluctant to leave the quiet haven of the bedroom. But he knows he should go after Draco and apologise. He just can’t find it within himself to do so, though. It’s hard, seeing Draco act so self-destructive without offering a concrete reason as to why.
Already half hard, Harry reached for his belt buckle, but Draco took over with steadier hands than he’d had at dinner. He dropped to his knees breathlessly. Draco’s mouth enveloped his shaft in a warm and velvety heat that felt like heaven on earth.
They’re eating lunch soon after, something they always do before presents so nobody goes hungry. Harry notices himself watching Draco’s conversations. He and Charlie seem to be getting on well. Charlie’s making him laugh, and a small pit of jealousy makes itself known in Harry’s stomach.
Harry felt his heart thudding painfully in his chest, and his hands became clammy and sticky. Neville walked with him to the castle, chatting about a particularly nasty Venomous Tentacula he had dealt with earlier in the day. Harry could barely hear him over the noise of his thoughts. Draco had given him a flower that meant devotion, and something about that tightened Harry’s stomach painfully. He hypothesized that it could have been an accident, that Draco had no idea what they really meant and this was all some unfortunate coincidence. But if Harry had learned one thing over the past seven years, it was that Draco wasn’t to be underestimated. He always knew what message he was trying to send and was deliberate about everything he did. Harry knew at least that much.
“There must have been a reason that you thought it was the right thing to do then, don’t you think?” Hermione says softly as she takes his hand in hers.
Draco nods. Harry’s getting used to the drastic highs and lows that he seems to have, but wishes, somehow, things could be different. It’s just so hard to see him like this, so numb and reserved, and not himself. He takes a tentative sip of the hot chocolate, smacking his lips gently together as though he’s trying to decide if he likes it or not.
“I’m here,” Harry breathes in softly, inhaling the scent of fresh cedarwood that clings to Draco’s body.
Harry had since visited the apothecary he frequented to see if the man who’d sold him the stuff was still working there. Instead, he was met with a younger woman. She looked to be no older than a teenager, but Harry couldn’t care less when he needed a refill.
Harry draws up the Naloxone to the first indicator on the syringe. He’s always hated needles but knows this isn’t the time to focus on that. He practically pushes Theo out of the way to reach Draco. He takes a deep breath and forces himself to keep his eyes open as he injects the needle directly into the muscle of Draco’s thigh and watches as the clear liquid drains from the cylinder.
The statement elicits laughter and profound agreement from the group, but Azalea’s expression remains impassive but proud. Harry feels tears prick incessantly at his eyes. He forces a deep breath, in through his nose, out through his mouth.
He fights his way through the crowd, pounding music drowning out any semblance of rational thought in his mind. He’s looking for blonde hair, literally anywhere in the room, but apart from Luna the only one he spots is Lavender. She’s wrapped around Parvati on the dancefloor, their bodies pressed together as they sway to the rhythm.
The stone walls broke apart once more, and Zabini entered, motioning for Harry to follow him. Harry did, his eyes darting curiously around the Slytherin common room. It was furnished the same as he had remembered it from so long ago, but it was somehow livelier. Parkinson and the yellow-haired boy played a hectic game of Wizard Chess on the ground by the fireplace, as warm yellow light crackled through the hearth. Slytherins lounged on the couches in casual robes, reading, talking, and relaxing. A pair of young girls in Muggle clothing threw their heads back in laughter at something an older housemate had said. Harry found himself noticing that the differences between the dungeons and his own common room were few and far between.
“Like you’re up to something.” He gazed at him suspiciously, as if Harry’s resolve might crumble under his eyes.
“Draco?” A tentative knock on the door startled him out of a state. “Is everything alright in there? Who are you talking to?”
They followed Robards into the hall and made their way to the boardroom when Harry glimpsed Hermione outside the door.
Someone coughed from the doorway, and Pansy and Harry pulled apart. He hadn’t realised how close their faces had been until he stood firmly back on the balls of his feet and forced himself to look at the door.
“Draco, you came to my home already flustered and upset by this, but has it done you any harm? Maybe you’re finally thinking for yourself for once and not doing what everyone expects of you. I don’t think that’s so bad.”
“Well, it was one of your bigger ones,” Harry said, forcing a tight bitterness down his throat. In the end, his words came out kind of sad.
McGonagall cut him off sharply by raising a single hand in front of her face. Malfoy’s mouth snapped shut. Harry was too busy being astonished by his outburst to comprehend what had actually been said. Certainly, Malfoy wanted out of this arrangement, and so did Harry, but it was out of character for the tosser to offer himself up for something else. To actually attempt to be helpful for once in his life. His politeness toward their Professor had not been forced, it lacked an edge that Harry recognized when Malfoy was trying too hard. The whole situation was nauseatingly disconcerting.
If he weren’t actively attempting to hold himself together, his legs would have shaken at her kindness.
One side of him was arguing that it would be unbelievably irresponsible to use the potion on Draco. But the what ifs played on Harry’s mind more than they had ever before. What if it worked? What if it didn’t work? What if this was the answer they needed? A few drops couldn’t do
There weren’t many people in the room, Harry noticed. Only one half of the table was occupied. Across from him, Seamus, and Ron sat Parvati Patil and Sybil Delaney. They weren’t partners either, from what Harry knew — how strange.
Harry aims a quick Drying Charm at his shoes because he’s embarrassed to notice how he’s tracking water and snow onto the large rococo rugs that carpet the entryway.
Harry looks up at him through his eyelashes, because there is no way he had heard that correctly. “Really?”
Hermione looked back up at him with so much love in her eyes that Harry would have cried right there out of sheer loneliness. He didn’t, though, and left their home quickly after that.
The silence breaks when they reach the Gryffindor portrait, and Hermione mumbles the password. The fat lady stares intently down at Harry, worry, and fear written across her features. When they enter the common room, it is empty.
Harry doesn’t even have time to process the fact that he might have just outed himself to Theo, or that Theo had just outed Draco to him. With a burning sense of embarrassment, Harry begins to remember the events from the night before. His mind is full of images of Draco. Sitting in his bed, flush-cheeked, looking up at the scattering of stars in the night sky blending in with gauzy curtains. He remembers taking something small, a pill, feeling every sense like electricity thrumming through his body, Draco’s body against his, their bodies pressing against each other’s. Outside, Draco taking his hand, Harry feeling sad when he had to let it go.
“Oh,” Harry says, thoughts leaving his mind as Draco breathes out, fresh, minty against his face. “The rose.”
“The what?” Harry was feeling increasingly removed, but Malfoy only continued. He chatted as if they had been familiars for years, and Harry’s discomfort only grew.
“Darling, you look dreadful.” She smoothed down an unkempt strand of hair on the side of Harry’s head.
The whole affair will be beautiful, and humble, and exactly what the two of them need. Nothing frilly and ornate. Just friends, family, and love.
Draco only shrugs. “Theo and Pansy usually invite people, and I stay upstairs when I can. I’ve never had much of a hand in planning these things, though even if I did, I can’t say I would’ve invited you. I don’t think you would, if you threw a party.”
After he had left, Draco optimistically crushed some of the thistle leaves together to create a sap-like substance, a thick milky white paste. He’d stirred it into his fourth cup of tea of the day and hoped for the best.
He led them to a table toward the front of the restaurant but nestled into the window away from other diners. Soft twinkling lights were visible from the outside, and the establishment itself was heated by a warm and roaring fire. Everything felt almost romantic, and Harry found himself beginning to panic. If Draco felt the same way about their environment too, he didn’t show it.
“Yeah,” Harry says mirthlessly. “It does.” It feels nice, at least, to know that she recognises the unfairness of it all.
Locke’s unforgettable words from the cellar came back to him immediately despite the throes of pleasure.
Ron and Hermione still had confused expressions on their faces, and Harry wondered how they could not understand what he was saying. They, of course, were aware of his sexuality. But the fact that it had happened in front of Malfoy should have been a dead giveaway at the remaining tension of last night.
Harry pulled it up an arm’s length from the bed, as though they were colleagues, maybe distant friends. Not husbands, or life partners.
The Healer’s eyes narrowed. “Mr Malfoy, we know you’ve been abusing substances for some time now. Tests indicate this has been in your system for years.”
“I must have something around here that can help.” She gave him a knowing smile, and something settled down in his stomach. Luna always had that effect on him. “In the meantime, maybe you should try meditation?”
Quickly, a hand pressed into his forehead, holding his head back down against the pillow. Another opened his mouth, tipping inside something that tasted suspiciously of nothing at all. Sleeping Draught perhaps, Draco thought, as the images around him swirled into darkness.
Harry swallowed, feeling his pulse pick up in his neck. He tapped at the floor silently with his foot, willing his leg to stop moving. But guilt flooded into him like water spilling from a collapsed dam, and he felt his hands go clammy and sticky.
Harry toyed with his ring, moving it from one finger to the next. It was a nervous habit he’d picked up from Hermione, who could never seem to keep her hands still anymore. She was always giddy with excitement. Her and Ron both were. Her tic was fueled by joy and cheer; Harry’s was cold and blue.
“I understand why you were angry. But I want to know why you said what you did.” Harry pushed, feeling the alcohol bubbling uncomfortably in his stomach. There was only so much he could say before setting Draco off. Narcissa had aptly named her son. He was explosive, but Harry didn’t think it was unpleasant. It was just Draco.
A thin smile touched Harry’s lips, but there wasn’t any warmth behind it. His eyes were tired and grey like they’d lost colour overnight. Draco settled at the table with the paper as Harry prepared their tea. It was a morning ritual they’d grown accustomed to even before their marriage had started to crumble. Harry sat across from him moments later, holding out a fragrant cup for Draco to take.
“So, you are happy?” Harry enquires, feeling foolish for needing to ask. But he’s not sure he believes Draco at all.
“I know,” Harry said, not bothering to ask her how she knew these things. He just wanted out of the shop, which seemed to be contracting in size by the second. “Thank you for the cake.”
“Malfoy!” People were beginning to stare, but Harry was feeling indignant. “You can’t just say that.”
The Carrow twins had died years ago, but it was known that Alecto bore a son. She was more sadistic than her brother. She’d tortured students gleefully in the walls of Hogwarts during her reign but had only allowed a small and cruel smile to sit upon her features in the process.
Across the street from the museum, Draco spotted a small café. Italian, probably, with a glowing neon sign that flickered on the letter E of OPEN. In the window were homemade cannoli that made his mouth water.
Harry swallows. He’s not going to tell him right now. “I don’t think that’s true,” he says instead. “Anyone would be lucky to have you.”
A gust of wind from outside knocked a window shut behind him, and the room seemed to resize and contract into something smaller. Claustrophobic and dizzy, Draco took another step back, but a loud clang informed him that he’d hit a steel fire poker with the heel of his shoe.
He sat back in the wicker chair, still in his coal-coloured trousers from earlier. He had opted for a lighter shirt, a white and cottony button-down to which he had left half unbuttoned, a distinct sliver of his chest exposed underneath. He had exchanged his banking shoes for summer loafers, though they weren’t any less formal.
Pansy looks hard-pressed to leave them in the room together, but to Harry’s surprise, she does as he requested of her without a fuss.
Draco blinked. And then he blinked again. The white from before had faded into something more yellow. Not comforting at all, but less harsh as he adjusted to the visuals around him.
A quick Patronus to Ginny confirmed his presence at dinner that evening. She and Pansy barely had any free time with the baby, and apparently, Molly had insisted her youngest grandchild stay for the evening. Nobody was going to argue with her.
“I’m fine, I just have a headache,” Draco said. “Maybe I’ll owl in sick.” He summoned Lyra with two fingers, and she followed them eagerly.
He was surprised he couldn’t see steam pumping out of Malfoy’s ears, he was more upset than Harry had seen him in a while. His pale features had turned an unpleasant green. Malfoy was outside of the pub in seconds.
Harry refills his cup with a stray bottle on the fireplace mantel and clumsily finds his way to the couch. He collapses on the other side of Lavender, as Dean has fallen asleep on her shoulder.
“Are you fucking kidding me right now?” Harry stood abruptly, and the container of wonton soup clattered to the side, spilling leftover broth over his paperwork. He applied a drying charm to it unthinkingly.
Harry leaves the words there and hopes the department won’t select him for a random drug screening any time soon. He doesn’t want to admit how wildly irresponsible he’s been, especially to Ron. Something about being around Draco seems to throw him off his axis.
“Draco, I-I can’t breathe.” He heaved as the world spun dizzyingly around him. Harry sucked in a deep breath through his lungs, but faltered. Everything was tightening and compressing and squeezing inside of him.
Capucine blinked back a few tears before sitting straighter against the couch. “We firecalled this morning. I’ve been trying to contact her, to see her, for weeks now, but something was wrong. She wouldn’t come see me, and every time I asked her to, I could tell it was like she wanted to, but couldn’t. Something was holding her back.”
“What’s going on?” Draco asked, finally, words ringing out loud in the silence of the house. He hoped his tone hid how troubled he was by Harry’s mere presence. The floorboard squeaked in protest underneath his feet as he shifted weight from one hip to the other. “Why couldn’t you control yourself back there? We both know that’s not you.”
“Alright!” Malfoy stood abruptly from the table, kicking his chair back violently. “I’m feeling tired, I’m going to head back.”
“Don’t be so stubborn,” Harry groans. “You’re going to bleed all over a Muggle grocery store, that can’t be sanitary or safe. And don’t tell me you’re alright with letting your face scar up like that.”
He really wanted to have the decency to confess. Draco deserved at least that much. But something inside of him stopped him from doing so. Because if he did, he’d never have Draco back in the way that he wanted.
As he meets Draco under the archway, the flowers somehow seem to bloom brighter. Luna stands just behind them, wrapped in cornflower blue robes, a flower crown braided down into her flowing blonde hair.
Hermione and Ron are at the door, too, Harry notices. Hermione is crying, her face blotchy and red, stained by tears. Ron is ghostly white. When he sees them, Harry drops the shield unknowingly. He’s so tired, but his body still cries while his mind wanders elsewhere. He heaves dryly and finds his chest tightening against Malfoy’s. The blonde’s eyes are open and are staring into the distant ceiling. Harry does not know how he hasn’t noticed they are the most beautiful eyes he has ever seen in his life.
A sound flooded Draco’s ears that sounded distinctly like his own heartbeat. His head swarmed with the noise of bees. The buzzing was loud, unpleasant, and painful until he said:
He’s too tired, his brain too foggy to think straight when he answers. Closing his eyes, he’s already falling back to sleep.
“Go home,” Harry says softly. “Get some rest. I have this under control for tonight. I just want to be here if something happens again.”
“Yeah, I don’t feel great,” Harry whined, letting his head lean back against the headboard as he gulped down the potion. It smelled foul and left a bitter aftertaste in the mouth. It promptly halted the waves of nausea, but Harry’s headache remained.
There was no way Harry was an addict. Draco would have seen the signs. He would’ve known. Occasionally, Draco would fumble through their bedside drawers for a tissue or pain reliever before bed, and his fingers would always knock into cold glass in their exploration. Dreamless Sleep was an easily identifiable purple, though. Not blue.
“Hello!” Young Draco gazes at him enthusiastically, as if he hasn't had a visitor in a while. Harry is surprised that his parents have not yet come by the portrait, though maybe he could understand why.
“That woman is something else.” Harry rolled his eyes, and took a few bags from Ginny. “She asked me my
“My office is just around the corner, I have dittany and healing potions there,” Harry says. "Doesn't that sound tempting?"
Once the joints were rolled, Draco handed Harry one. They put them in between their lips and spoke out
The room is small and square, with dark walnut flooring and a nice desk in one corner, a Muggle computer hooked up to the wall. Harry notices the abrasive light is coming through a bay window, with a pillow and selection of classic novels piled high next to the seating area. Next, Harry notices the sheets, which are a vivid aubergine purple that even garish Aunt Petunia would never select for her home.
“There’s nothing else I can do but give him this potion and hope he gets better?” Harry had said, worry ringing out in his tone.
Harry bristled at the touch, but allowed himself to be moved. “I can make my own decisions, thanks.”
It hit him like a cursed Bludger when he was seated comfortably at his desk with a spread of croissants and danishes at his fingertips. It was at this time that Draco’s stomach would rumble, usually at the sight of such perfectly-baked foods. He’d always had a sweet tooth, while Harry, like a heathen, preferred savoury in the morning. He never wanted eggs as the first meal of the day, but he’d be damned if he was going to ask for something custom-made. Instead, he would forego the meal at home to enjoy a better one in his office.
“It’s beautiful,” Harry agrees. He presses his side instinctively closer into Draco, their warm bodies begging for more heat.
“Good morning!” Draco frowned quickly, finding his voice much more enthusiastic than he had wanted it to be.
So, Harry takes a deep breath and then one more before deciding it’s probably the right time to stop skulking around the front garden of a house that isn’t his, in the dark, like some sort of burglar. He knocks before he can change his mind and cringes when it comes out loud and echoey through the empty neighbourhood.
Harry tucked in, starved from a day’s worth of action. Draco eyed his plate uncomfortably, placing a hand over his stomach. He sipped at his tea, pointedly avoiding eye contact with his food.
He’d avoided learning who his soulmate was for one whole year. Various adoring witches and wizards, armed with Amortentia, suggestibility potions, and sometimes the stray Felix Felicis had landed on the steps of the Ministry in hopes of convincing Harry that he was, in fact, their soulmate. He wonders, at times, if he sent them away too quickly because it isn't entirely impossible that one of them might actually be telling the truth. But it was too much work to discern honest people from all the liars, and Harry wasn’t particularly in the mood to meet his soulmate in such a fashion. A large part of him liked the idea of being able to choose who he spent the rest of his life with. It hardly seemed fair that this would be another choice snatched from him without a second thought.
Harry gazed up at the looming gothic building. He had never seen anything quite like it. Surprise and disorientation were evident on his face because he only snapped back into reality when Malfoy waved a slender hand in front of his glasses.
matter in the grand scheme of things, though Harry was embarrassed to know that his friends knew more about his husband’s life than he did. Draco shared little and listened even less.
There aren’t many lights on in Hampstead, and the midnight blue sky shines with stars, casting dancing rays of moonlight across Draco’s pale features. He looks ethereal and angelic against the backdrop of the night.
Bloomsbury, though, despite its beautiful parks and various quiet homes, was a bustling hub of familiar buildings and exciting people.
“I don’t know.” Draco sighed, tucking a strand of grown-out blond hair behind his ear. “I don’t feel like anything she’s doing is helping me.”
Before Harry can reply, the door creaks open, and Theo enters with a few bowls in his hand. He kicks the door shut with a bare foot and stumbles over to the bed, climbing onto the mattress with all the grace of a Hippogriff foal.
“But you were back so late,” Ron said, eyes widening. “You surely weren’t with Malfoy for that long, right Harry?”
“It’s okay, you’re okay,” Harry says as Draco cries. He’s terrified of what this all means, but Draco seems to need to let go, and he deserves to after everything he’s put himself and his body through.
He extracted himself from Draco almost clinically, gathering his clothes without a second glance in his direction and stalking off to the bathroom for a shower.
Draco was silent, unsure what to say, and lacking desire to offer even a shred more of comfort. First Carrow, and then his own husband. It was a believable thought that men loved owning Draco.
“It’s just strange,” Harry says, with a wrinkled nose. He’s not sure he entirely likes the place, but mostly because it doesn’t fit with Draco’s sensibilities at all. At least, what he knows of the things Draco might be partial to.
When Harry brings their items back to the table, Draco wrinkles his nose. He takes the lid off of the cup to inspect the drink.
Harry caught her arm as she stood from the couch. “Don’t bother honestly, Malfoy tried to argue with her, and it did absolutely nothing.”
“Come on now,” Harry says, tugging him onto his back. Draco complies, pliant at Harry’s touch. He’s ice-cold underneath his fingertips.
“Hello,” Draco says, breathless, as though he’s forgotten that they’re actually together. Sometimes, Harry doesn’t feel like it’s real.
Draco, Theodore Nott, and Pansy Parkinson are arranged in a circle on the large bed. Harry, finding himself drunker than he expects, sits just on the edge for some stability. Draco, with a slender and pale finger, beckons him forward. Harry complies without thought, scooting forward just enough so that he completes the missing link in their circle.
“I thought it was the right thing to do,” Harry says, his statement losing some of its fire and becoming quiet.
“I’ve never been to one,” Harry stated and continued when Draco wore a puzzled expression., “The Muggles that looked after me never took me out to a restaurant. I usually stayed at home. I did go into a few cafés with them sometimes if that counts, but I never ate anything.”
He had thought, at first, it would behave like a drinkable Imperius Curse. Within the Auror department, partners often came across illegal labs experimenting with bottling the Unforgivables, but the numerous attempts were never successful. And, well, this one didn’t seem so bad. Draco was clearly in his right state of mind. If anything, he was only more open-minded and understanding than before, as if the potion made him think a little before opening his mouth in anger. It broke past Draco’s characteristic wall of stubbornness. Harry’s guilt was vanishing, and he felt less sick and more hopeful. No real harm was done at all, right? It was just once. To get Draco to
Harry smiled, a genuine thing that lit up his face and the green in his eyes like a lantern. He nodded.
After they cleared out, Draco thumbed through the pages of a glossy magazine, before Clove demanded he get his lazy bum out of bed and go for a walk.
Harry wasn’t in danger of anything but the possibility of his own exposure. Somehow, that was a fate far worse.
It was completely uncharacteristic of Harry to want to quit even the smallest of tasks, but his hands clammed up when anyone even mentioned the case. It was bad enough that he had used such a substance, but it was much worse that he’d been unable to stop.
A soft meow from the kitchen pulls his attention, and he heads in the direction of the pantry. While he’s not quite hungry enough for a proper breakfast, something in his stomach might soothe the ache there.
“I’m barely wearing any clothing.” Draco frowned, surveying his magical non-slip socks and patient gown. “You want me to walk around like this?”
Harry let out a scoff but directed it at the table in front of him, eager to look anywhere but at Malfoy.
He dropped his pyjamas to the floor, leaving them in a pile at the foot of the bed. Draco would yell at him for that later, but Harry barely had the care to take them to the basket and avoid a fight anyway. He busied himself getting ready for the day after a quick shower, dressing in a pair of pressed dark jeans and a white t-shirt. He rarely reached for robes anymore, especially during the summer.
Clearly, in the past few weeks, Harry had been noticing how compliant Draco had been. How eager he was to do what was asked of him. And Harry, like the ever-positive Gryffindor that he was, had probably decided that Draco was just trying to be nice for once. That he was really trying. Harry probably liked him like this, Draco mused. The real Draco was much snarkier and less accommodating. Nobody liked that.
“I’m so scared, Harry,” Malfoy mumbles gently, life slipping quickly from his grasp. His head is lolling sickeningly to one side.
“Needed anything?” Pansy asked, incredulous. “Draco Malfoy, making himself useful for once! A sight to see!”
He’s not sure he’s quite ready yet to share any details of Draco’s state of mind during the night versus his demeanour in the morning. If he did, then he’d need to explain the drug use, and Ron would not take kindly to that.
Before he could register it, large hands moved him over onto his back and reached for his hips. Harry bent down with a wild look in his eyes and swallowed Draco to his base, nose pressing close to his stomach and into a small tuft of hair.
“That smells great.” Draco sniffed from the table, tearing his eyes away from pending documents. New Draco was still obsessive about his work, even when coming home early for the day. It was comforting to know that was a constant.
Locke rolled his eyes. “He’s your husband, isn’t he? No need to be so touchy, I won’t try anything.” He cleared his throat, allowing Harry a moment for his breathing to slow, before continuing. “As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, you and Draco were doing better. Everything was working well, and you were left wondering, how is this working so well? How are we so happy?”
He had his trousers down in an instant, turning Draco around so that the side of his face pressed uncomfortably rough against the wall. Draco struggled, but Harry had already pinned his wrists up above his head. He had to stop this.
Draco’s shoe slipped out against wet pavement underneath, and his body threatened to give way. He caught himself in time, steadying a hand against a slick lamppost before continuing forward. Rain bore down on his face, cutting at his cheeks violently as a biting wind drew tears from his eyes.
“Why on earth did you drag me there with you, Harry?” He seemed small when he said it and a little sad. Harry wanted to hug him. He tried to say he didn’t mean to, but he didn’t know why this was affecting Malfoy so much. Maybe it was a pureblood thing. Maybe Malfoy was upset at his sexuality, he reasoned.
Draco seems to linger on the question for a few moments, but he ultimately chooses not to answer. His lips close, pressing thin and hard into a tight line. A strand of white-blond hair falls from behind his ear, draping gently in front of his right eye. Harry has a sudden, inexplicable urge to reach out and push it away. To run the flat of his thumb down the sharp edge of Draco’s cheekbone, following the line of his nose, to part pink lips with a single, gentle push.
“How was work?” Harry asked, when Draco didn’t reply. He was fixedly gazing at Pansy and Ginny. Harry wondered if Draco resented them, like he did, for never losing their honeymoon love after so many years.
“The Weasleys are wonderful,” Draco prefaces, with a slight smile. “But they’re an exhausting group.”
Harry fumbles around the drawers for washcloth, reaching out to dab the wetness away from Draco’s head.
“There’s no need to thank me so many times,” Draco says smoothly, catching the wood in one hand as Harry struggles with its heavy weight. “I was merely returning the favour, Harry.”
Draco perches gently on the desk as Harry rummages through his cabinets for his first aid kit. Once located, he opens it quickly, spreading the contents across the wooden surface.
Still, especially after their perfect Christmas, Harry had wondered if Draco would be able to pull himself out of the cycle. If he was using drugs to make himself happy, and he appears to be happier, then what is Harry doing wrong?
A peck at his window drew his attention almost immediately, and he let himself get caught in the excitement of seeing Lyra at his window. She held in her small beak a copy of the paper from that day. Draco really did try to read it in the mornings, but he was always too distracted by Harry to bother attempting anymore. Instead, he held it open in front of his breakfast as a pretense. Usually its presence would render Harry silent throughout their awkward meals.
She thumbs through a couple more pages, clicking her tongue as she reaches what is presumably the necessary one. Scanning her index finger down the page, she stops just a hair from the bottom. Her eyes widen almost comically, and she looks up at Harry with an indiscernible expression. Quickly, she waves her wand, muttering a soft incantation, and Harry’s core shoots back into his chest with a force that leaves him feeling as though he’s been punched in the stomach. Doubling over on the desk, he forces one breath and then another.
Draco stumbles a bit on the last step, and Harry moves forward quickly on instinct. He reaches out his arms, steadying Draco against the bannister. He’s slack-jawed and unresponsive to the touch, and it makes Harry feel sick and frightened.
together. The joints lit warmly in their mouths. Harry took an experimental inhale, and found the thick smoke sat uncomfortably in his airways. The unpleasant taste in his mouth didn’t do much to help. He coughed on the exhale, but Draco only let out a breathy sigh.
When he’s finally Apparated into the foyer of Grimmauld Place and hung up his raincoat and umbrella on the rack to dry, he puts a hole through the wall in the hallway. His fist comes back brown and bloody, and Harry feels guilty just looking at it. His hand hurts as he flexes it experimentally, but he doesn’t much care to make use of a Healing Charm. The constant throbbing feels like a familiar friend, especially in his line of duty.
“Who else would I be talking about, you idiot?” she snapped, but there was no bite behind her words. Genuine concern and worry spread across her face instead. “He’s not forcing you to stay, is he? I swear —”
“For fucks sake, Harry, just let me —” Draco forced a breath, pausing for a moment in an attempt to regain his calm. “I want something different than this.”
This seemed like a very Dumbledore thing to do, after all. It wasn’t enough that Harry had been tasked with defeating the darkest wizard of all time, but as a reward for such a feat, he was assigned more work. McGonagall peered down at the two boys in front of her with, what one would call, a sort of humorous expression coloring her sharp features. It seemed a little unnatural to see her face communicate anything more than truly neutral or hopelessly agitated, Harry thought. A small part of Harry expected she would allow him, and his fellow eighth years, to continue their year in peace. But here she was defying his expectations once more.
Harry wondered what it would be like if Malfoy actually did bite him. But he banished those thoughts quickly, in fear of letting the words settle onto his features. He scolded himself for letting his mind wander like that.
“I’m not.” Draco sat taller at that, preening happily. “But this is something common among Muggles, so it’s purely for educational purposes. Blaise was dying for me to share, but I wouldn’t trust him with my secrets while I’m incapacitated and suggestible.”
Harry has never been so aroused by someone in his entire life. So mad with lust and love and care for the body, the person beneath him. Draco rocks back up against him, and Harry groans softly. He knows already that with Draco, he won’t last long. He’ll come undone, already loose and slack at the seams. Harry’s vision is blurry, obscured with longing until it’s sharp and acutely alert of sensation, every movement of Draco’s body slotted against his.
“Oh,” Harry said stupidly, unsure of what to say. Usually, he was quite good at interacting with family members of the deceased, but something about this death felt foreign and personal at the same time. “I’m sorry to hear that. I wish I could’ve gotten to know her better during those days.”
Draco’s wearing a pair of clubmaster eyeglasses, but from behind the frames, Harry can barely see any silver. His pupils are dilated to the point of almost black.
Draco takes a moment too long to do so, but he turns around eventually, meeting Harry in the middle of the rooftop.
Before Ollie can respond, the room seems to fall silent, and Azalea is walking in, clad in modest charcoal robes, her afro styled back into a puff with a yellow ribbon. She wears a serious, but wise expression on her features. Her mere presence seems to calm the group as she takes a seat in one of the chairs.
“I don’t want my subconscious controlling what I do, though. I daresay it’s not as morally developed as I am.”
“No, don’t — ah!” Draco cried out, clutching at his temples and slamming his head down on the table with a rough crack.
It stung that Draco wouldn’t tell him things like that. Of course, they were insignificant. In the larger picture of life, Draco slept in his bed every night; they made love frequently enough, like many married couples in their mid-twenties did; and they updated each other on big life events, like promotions, news, things that mattered.
“Er.” Harry considers for a moment. It might be nice to have a shoulder to lean on if it happens to be someone he does know, or doesn’t particularly like, but it’s far more likely that he’ll get a stranger. “I’ll be fine on my own," he decides. "Let me know how yours goes, yeah?” he says instead.
Sex was always something they did well. Harry turned, pressing a bruising and full kiss to Draco’s lips that was harsh and needy. Draco groaned softly into Harry’s possessive touch.
Draco huffed, but it emerged in a petulant way, like a small child arguing with a parent. Though Harry hardly had the patience of one. “I’m an adult, Harry. I can —”
“Does that make you sad?” Harry asks, the words tumbling from his lips before he can keep them in. He curses himself for getting tipsy enough to loosen an already loose filter.
Draco smiles ruefully down at the table. “It’s possible that I have one, but I know I don’t deserve one.”
Malfoy lies underneath him; his dress shirt bares no ounce of white anymore. It’s a deep and violent red that makes Harry’s face turn green. This is not happening, he firmly tells himself, but it really is. He rips the boy’s shirt open, exposing Malfoy’s naked chest. Harry delivers healing spells at the wounds and feels a glimmer of hope as they disappear. But the confidence is shattered when deeper gashes replace the one’s that Harry has taken away. Malfoy only cries harder.
Harry felt as though a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He was growing increasingly accustomed to Draco’s presence and had been a little lonely all week without him.
Draco must have taken the whole damn bottle, when Harry only needed the smallest sip to knock him out completely in the nighttime.
Before Harry can respond, Seamus is opening the door with a lazy grin plastered upon his soft features. He corrals both Harry and Blaise into a group hug.
Harry looks back at Draco, feeling so dizzy with fondness that it makes his head spin. A large part of him is proud to bring someone like Draco back to his family. At least, this person. The sweet, quiet, well-mannered and good-intentioned soul that he really is.
Harry felt himself growing increasingly defensive. It wasn’t Ron’s business who he was or wasn’t involved with, and it was Harry’s decision when to inform them as such.
He was shaking as he searched for Draco’s wrist, but his fingers closed around open air. Draco’s hands clasped together behind his back, as if he was afraid Harry would touch him at all. His face bore every sign of regret, and Harry wanted to curl into a ball and disappear.
Draco pushed his chair back in a daze, and it made a loud, raking noise against the floorboards. A few late-night drinkers’ attentions were drawn to the scuffle. Carrow moved closer still, hands pulling Draco up from his seat and holding his arms in place with little effort. Draco fought the unwelcome hold, but he was smaller and weaker than the man who claimed what he desired. No one would interfere on Draco’s behalf anyway. They knew not to mess with the scorned sons of renowned Death Eaters.
” Draco said. His skin dotted with gooseflesh. “It’s right there, on the tip of my mind, but I just can’t remember it.”
Rain peters down slowly from the sky before it flows unbridled, soaking through everyone’s robes, and dresses, and suits. Harry’s hair is drenched within a matter of seconds, his glasses wet with condensation. He doesn’t seem to care though, taking them from the bridge of his nose and letting out an excited yelp.
Harry shouldn’t drink; he knows that he shouldn’t. But the gash in his thigh is throbbing, and the burn of alcohol would be a welcome distraction. He reaches out, chest tightening ever so slightly as their fingers brush at the exchange of the glass. Harry takes a sip.
They entered the kitchens to the surprise of a smattering of house-elves. The small creatures were at the boys’ feet immediately, begging to bring them supper or tea. Malfoy allowed for both, and Harry attempted to hide the surprise on his face. He was unaware that they had plans to share a meal together. Harry felt uneasy, especially at the casualness in Malfoy’s tone when he spoke to the elves. He couldn’t help but think of how harsh Lucius was with Dobby and wonder why Malfoy himself wouldn’t reflect those same qualities. It wasn’t as if they were any different.
“Tonight, at eight. We will meet outside the kitchens.” Malfoy stated simply, turning on his heels as his friends followed eagerly behind.
“Auror Potter,” Locke called, and Harry’s head turned a fraction of an inch to accommodate him. “You forgot my little gift.”
“Oh, we all have work,” Seamus laughs. “But unlike you, Mister Auror Potter, we get to take our weekends off. We were in a war and never had a normal year of school. I would say all of us, especially you, mate, deserve to let go a bit in spare time.”
Something had changed in the time that he’d been gone. Draco couldn’t quite place it, but this Harry was different in some way.
“Thanks, love,” Ginny says, returning to folding the pink jumper and floating it back inside the closet.
“Listen,” Hermione says, pulling out the barstool next to Harry and taking a seat. “I will never be able to force you to do something you don’t want to do, but this isn’t a choice. This is a matter of life and death here. Even if you never explicitly tell him you’re soulmates, your body will still need to be around him, and you have to honour that.”
Draco could tell Harry was happier. He could even tell the people around them were more pleased that they’d finally worked things through. By some miracle of God, everything was better than it had been in a while.
Draco’s stomach turned, hands feeling clammy and slick against the sheets where he clutched them. Narcissa loomed over him, dabbing sweat away from his head. He heard her call out, maybe for Clove, but the words were jumbled in her mouth.
“You have just said it was business related,” Narcissa narrows her eyes, and takes another long sip from her cup.
Instead, he said, “I’m fine. You worry like a mother, but there’s no need. I genuinely just had a headache today.” Which was, in part, truthful.
,” Draco repeats through gritted teeth. He looks feverish, a pile of limbs on the bathroom floor. Harry very much dislikes the sight of it all.
Harry nodded in response, but his mind was filled with thick fog. Something inside was screaming at him to just stumble forward and kiss Draco sloppily against the door of the entrance hall. But he didn’t, and in seconds Draco had stalked off in the direction of the dungeons. Harry pushed his back to the cold wall and sunk down the floor, head in his hands. He was sobering up and willing his mind to let the alcoholic stupor envelop him so he could forget what feelings felt like.
“Yes, God, he likes you!” Hermione cried, flinging her hands around in the air. “Can’t you see it? And you just left him there like he meant nothing to you, Harry. If someone did that to me, I’d feel so used. You have to go and talk to him.”
The blonde turned on him, rage written across his features had turned his eyebrows all pointy. The facade dissipated within seconds. “Potter, this was supposed to be
If he wasn’t, which was more likely the case, he decided checking himself directly into the Janus Thickey Ward might be wise.
“Yeah,” Carrow replied, hand creeping up the length of Draco’s trousers, which were suddenly too tight for his taste. “Such a pretty little thing. So easy to defile something like you.”
It was one of the warmer summer nights they’d had when Harry stepped outside of the Ministry and into the unusually light streets of London. The sun hadn’t set yet, casting a faint yellow glow over everything in sight. It was beautiful to see the city so warm and inviting like this, and sometimes Harry wondered what it would be like to live away from the country. But then again, if they did, friends would visit much more often.
“You’re a bad liar for a Slytherin,” Harry said, and there was something eerie and sinister in his tone that Draco took an immediate dislike to.
But something in the far reaches of his mind egged him on towards doing it. Maybe once, just once, he would enquire, if he ever mustered the curiosity and courage to do so. It couldn’t hurt.
“I don’t know,” Draco said truthfully, feeling his eyes blur with tears. “I didn’t feel like I had any options left.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry chuckles, cracking open the first file on the stack that Parvati had brought in. “No chance I’ll be able to do anything without coffee. Your usual?”
And then it hits Harry quickly, a touch of sadness that he can’t quite seem to pinpoint the reasons for. He stands with it for a moment, feeling confused and disoriented, before neglecting to put on his trousers, pretending not to notice as Pansy and Theo snicker at his behind. He stumbles out of the room in boxers and a t-shirt, peeking in various doors of the small, dark hallway.
“Hm,” Draco hums, bringing the bowls to the island. He claims a barstool next to Harry. “You’re not wrong.”
“Did you tell him?” Ron asks, coming over to sit in the chair across from Harry’s desk. He begins to fiddle with the collection of chocolate frog cards on the surface, just to do something with his hands.
“Do you like that?” Harry asks roughly, and Draco can barely nod, closing his eyes, his mouth an open O. “You’re so pretty like this,” he says. “All mine.”
perfect,” Draco says, and Harry can feel the love, the contentment in his voice. “Hermione, trouser legs are not going to make or break this wedding. I’m confident in that fact.”
Draco shrugged, feeling tension ease out of his shoulders as he confessed a small part of his worst fear. “I don’t necessarily want to believe that’s true.”
“It’s cold out here,” he said conversationally, even though it was clear Harry was in no mood to talk.
When Harry and Draco head back into London, it’s dark out. They’d stayed for dinner, and then subsequent dessert and then tea, before deciding it would probably be best to head home before it got too late.
“Morning!” Ron said cheerily. “Excited for another day of combing through painfully outdated files?”
Draco shoved him hard. Harder than he’d intended. Harry didn’t falter much and caught himself after a few tripped steps. His gaze blackened, and Draco’s mouth went cold and dry.
“Draco,” Harry breathes, unsure if it would even be heard above the sound of pounding music that rattles through the walls of the house.
“He is,” Parvati supplies from the doorway. She enters with a stack of files, floating half the pile to each of their desks. “Saw him with my own eyes. Anyway, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it’s a paperwork kind of day. Robards is on another organising kick, and he wants these completed by the end of day.”
“This is Malfoy we’re talking about here; you do realise that, don’t you?” Harry protests. “I cannot, no, I
They both fixed their gazes on Harry, who shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. “I will not be getting involved in this.”
“Ah, for God’s sake, Harry!” Draco protested as he attempted to sit up. “Not even going to prep me then?”
Harry knew he didn’t understand, though, but wasn’t going to waste time pointing that out. He was most definitely alone.
