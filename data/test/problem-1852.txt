Harry welcomed the distractions that dinner provided, he almost always did. He was in a rather good mood actually; quidditch practice had gone well, the weather had been so nice, and he hadn’t failed the paper Professor Mcgonagall had assigned. The high energy Gryffindor table was the cherry on top.
“Lumos,” Malfoy commanded, and once again they had light. Harry saw that there was a tired look in Malfoy’s eyes, but before he could comment on it, Draco continued:
“We need to be all the more cautious still. Things have been going easily so far, and I’d like to keep it that way,” Hermione said with a sniff.
“Whenever I wake up like this, it happens more often than you’d think, I come down here and look at the fire. It has a way of soothing me back to sleep.” Suddenly Hermione snapped to attention and gazed at Harry with the look she had when trying to solve something. “What were you thinking about, that you couldn’t get to sleep?”
Before he knew what his body was doing, he crawled over to Harry, putting his hands on the other boy’s shoulders.
“Prick,” Harry grumbled to himself, turning to carry on practicing his defensive magic, as he had done before being rudely interrupted. But there was still one question that continued to linger on Harry’s mind: Why did the room even let Malfoy in in the first place?
“You never come home anymore. I miss you.” Draco felt his heart swell. He swiftly scooped her up into his arms and held her close.
Harry was hard, so very very hard. It almost ached how badly he wanted to be touched. His desire was so strong that he didn’t have room to feel any of the shame that typically came with being exposed. His libido only grew as Draco spit into his own hand, pausing to give Harry a devilish smirk before wrapping said hand around Harry’s member. He arched into the touch with a shuddering gasp, eyes closed and arms wrapped around the other boy’s neck.
“Or…” Harry thought a moment, his brain still trying to recover from the nap, “I’ll turn your teeth into a necklace..?”
“And Cho?” Harry asked, genuinely wondering what Hermione thought. His relationship with Cho was… strange. She hadn’t healed from Cedric’s death, the wound she felt was fresh. Being with her never really felt like anything but a beautiful hallucination. Or rather, a hallucination of a beautiful girl.
Realizing what Draco was about to do, Harry froze, not daring to breathe. He stared down at Draco in shock, eyes wide. At that, the blond boy chuckled.
Through passion and heat the two men managed to shed their clothing and stumble to the loveseat that rested between the two chairs the lovers had previously been occupying. Their bare bodies lying against one another, writhing in an ecstasy that could be given by nothing else. With eloquent spellcasting on both men’s parts, Harry was inside of his lover, rhythmically pumping as they both moaned as if in heat.
Potter let go of Draco’s hand, but didn’t step back. He looked at him with hard emerald green eyes, eyes that seemed to scorch the soul of the Slytherin. He huffed, blowing his bangs up as he did so, and Draco was able to catch a fleeting glimpse of the famous scar. He looked as though he wanted so badly to give Draco a piece of his mind, but was having a difficult time finding the words.
Feeling a gentle gust of wind, Harry looked up to to discover that during his thought-filled wanderings, he had somehow managed to find himself in the breezeway. He paused and leaned against the stone side, staring out over the scenery. The wind blew his dark hair back from his face, exposing his scar for all to see, but no one was there.
When Harry raised his head to look at Malfoy in the eyes, the blond continued, “You still have lots of time to know her. We both do.”
He tried not to think about what just happened. He didn’t want to confront what Blaise had said. Potter? Love? What a load of tripe. He loathed Potter, everyone knew that. He’d always loathed Potter. That’s why he could never stop thinking about him; that’s why he took every opportunity he could to mock him, to get a rise out of him. He sighed. ‘Draco, you’re smarter than this,’ he thought to himself. He got up and walked to the common room door. He needed some fresh air.
“Can you tell me?” At this the little girl thought a moment. She tilted her head from one side to the other, looking up and humming with a finger on her chin. Her nails were painted bright purple.
“Really Harry I’ve already stayed too long here, babysitting you.” Draco felt his voice shake. So preoccupied was he, that he didn’t even notice that he’d called Potter by his first name.
He thought of grey eyes. Swirling and stormy behind a cruel visage. They were clouds. They were Iris florentina. They were the moon, and they were a tombstone. They terrified him, but intrigued him all the same. Why did they have to belong to Draco Malfoy? With thoughts of the eyes of a Slytherin filling his mind, Harry found himself asleep, and within a dream.
Without warning, Draco came with a sharp intake of breath and a low, drawn out, “Shit!” It felt, incredible.
Harry jumped when Malfoy had his outburst of laughter. ‘I didn’t know that my threats were so hilarious’ he thought warmly.
Draco took this opportunity to grab Harry and flip him so that he was lying on the couch, underneath the blond. He didn’t say anything, but looked into Harry’s flourishing green eyes, lust and anticipation swirling inside. He captured the Gryffindor’s lips once again, running a hand down Harry’s side and sliding up his untucked shirt.
Ron’s eyes became heavy with understanding. He sighed also, “Yeah, I know what you mean. Nothing really makes sense, does it?” Harry shook his head.
Feeling how hard the other boy had gotten, Draco reached his hand down and palmed Harry through his pants, causing the boy to rock gently against him. This illicited a growl from Harry, and he quickly captured Draco’s mouth once again.
“What the fuck is this, Potter?” the blond hissed, seething as his wand stayed steadily pointed at Potter.
“You’re strange, and you’re an absolute prick, and I know you’re severe and insufferable; but fuck, Malfoy why do I see that less now? I’m so confused, I feel like I don’t belong in my own skin, and every movement feels alien. I’m not gay, I know I’m not, but why then do I think that you’ve never looked so good?! With your dumb hair and your stupid, stormy eyes, and…”
Draco sucked in his breath as Harry worked his mouth over Draco’s exposed skin. He leaned in close as the other boy wrapped his legs around him.
“What are you crying about?” Draco’s head snapped up at the voice of Potter, to see that all of the snow and ice was gone, but the home still looked different. Potter was standing above him, looking down at him with warm eyes.
He felt the presence of the other boy next to him then. He felt gray eyes boring into the side of his head. He felt Malfoy’s desperation for Harry to look at him. Harry decided not to give the git the satisfaction.
Draco was none of this. He rubbed the back of his neck with a hand that felt like ice. Draco was cold, he was as dark as a cave and as welcoming as one too. He was green, silver, black and bronze. He was a tool, a pawn in a game he had no control over. Not that Potter would think of it like that.
There was a deep part of him that somewhat cherished that short-lived moment of pleasant jabbing, but Harry refused to believe that that was how he truly felt. He ignored the fact that the conversation didn’t feel tense or suffocating, that the alarm bells weren’t going off in his head. Until he told them to, of course. To Harry, that moment was impossible. He didn’t want to know that his rival, this boy he’d known since first year, that he’d despised since first year, could have a pleasant side to him. It was easier just to make himself believe that Malfoy was pure evil, through and through.
“My eyes,” the little girl echoed, a smile in her voice. Without warning, she turned and fled further into the forest, giggling mirthfully. Harry let her go, his mind reeling. Who was she? He felt so warm when he held her. Why?
Harry noticed and responded in a defeated voice, “This is the quietest place I could have gone. Everyone’s so loud in the common room.” Malfoy nodded, seeming to understand.
“All it takes is a couple of sentences about me to have you grabbing me and shoving me into empty classrooms. Are you really that desperate for my attention, Potter?” The Slytherin knew he was being cunning, seeming like a wildcat winding up to pounce. He continued to walk towards Potter until he had the black-haired boy pinned against the wall. His wand was the only source of light as it rested forgotten in Draco’s hand.
“Are we though, Potter? Do you ever ‘just’ do anything?” He got close to Harry once again, but this time it felt different. This time it felt more menacing, “I’ve known you for a while now, Potter and I can say this with certainty: You will try to make something out of this. There is nothing here. Nothing.”
“But if you did that, the world would no longer be blessed with my incredible eyes. Really, you’d just be damning yourself, Malfoy.” Harry shook his head and looked cooly at Malfoy, an easy smile spreading over the Gryffindor’s mouth.
Draco sat up, glaring at him. Without thinking, he tackled Harry’s legs, sending the other boy down and evening the playing field. Until Draco managed to steal back his wand from Harry’s possession.
His heart was beating so hard he was almost sure Potter could hear it. This didn’t feel real, it felt foggy, like a dream. Draco’s breathing became shallow.
“You can never be sure though, can you?” Both boys’ voices were getting softer, the heat of anger and tension leaving them.
“Don’t… don’t do that,” Harry whispered, his breath, his voice hot against Draco’s lips. His rationality was put on the backburner of his mind as his body took control, raising his arms only to grip Draco’s back.
“When you tore me from the railing and threw me to the ground, you probably had an adrenaline rush. Sometimes that makes you able to do things you wouldn’t normally do.”
Harry knelt down so that he was eye level with her, “They’re your eyes, little doe.” And he kissed her gently on the forehead.
“Don’t think that’s something you can just decide, Pansy. You’re just bitter,” Theo chuckled, tossing Draco an understanding look. Draco simply stared back blankly.
As the daylight waned, Slytherins came and went from the common room, allowing Draco the space and quiet he needed. With each passing minute his nervous excitement grew, until the common room was empty save for him, and 10:45 was the time.
Harry forced himself out of this train of thought by downing his glass of pumpkin juice just as his friends were gathering up their bags, preparing to head to their first class. He already knew that it was going to be a rather long day.
“Who… who was she?” Harry frowned in confusion, quickly forgetting what the little girl looked like. “Why, I can’t… I don’t know who she….”
“Then why did I enjoy it?” Harry blurted without thinking. Draco’s breath hitched, catching in his throat.
Harry put up his hands, “I don’t either, but I highly doubt that he’d chop off my head in the library.” ‘He’d had the chance after all,’ Harry added wordlessly to himself.
Harry was too tired to get pissy with Malfoy. Instead, he elected the best choice of action would be to once again fall asleep using his bunched up robes as a makeshift pillow.
Harry chuckled as Malfoy draped himself against a column. Yes, this interaction was definitely different. There wasn’t any real aggression on either of their parts. Harry almost wished it could be like this more often. This thought scared him, and Harry reminded himself that Malfoy wasn’t to be trusted. ‘He could be trying to get your guard down. He could be trying to get you not to suspect him. Trying to get your trust.’ With these thoughts and others suddenly taking back control of his mind, he quickly decided to sober up.
Pansy had tried to get Draco to join in on whatever drunken maddness was taking place, but he declined, using unfinished homework as an excuse to escape to the library. It wasn’t that Draco didn’t enjoy his fair share of intoxicated endeavors every now and then, it was just that he didn’t trust his drunken tongue during this particualr time. Especially after all the feelings he could barely contain under a sober mind. And seeing everyone else have fun with whatever booze they managed to scrounge up just put him in a foul mood, so he decided the best course of action was to just vacate the entire Slytherin dorm.
Hiya. This chapter is a little bit late because I like to write a chapter ahead before I publish, and chapter six is a doozy. There is also smut in this. Steamy. Yessiree. I went to a bar/club for the first time last night. It was hot and sweaty and sexual and absolutely fantastic.
“An ass am I?” Draco’s laugh was joyless and cutting, “An ass indeed! But at least I didn’t use anyone for sexual exploration!”
On this particular night, the hour was around 2:30, and Harry still didn’t feel the least bit tired. Sighing, he got up and walked down into the common room. Hopefully the warmth of the fire would still his thoughts.
“Hm?” Malfoy hummed, turning towards Harry, “Oh please, as if I could be so easily distracted by the likes of you. I’m Draco Malfoy, Potter. I can study with you here believe it or not.”
“Wait here, Mr. Potter. I’ll be right back with a draught.” The sound of her thick heels clicked in the large, empty room.
Draco noticed this, “Getting sloppy with our hexes are we? How do you plan to defeat anyone if you can’t even land one hi…” Before Draco could finish his sentence, he was thrown onto his back by a spell Harry had cast silently. The wind was knocked out of him, and he fell on is back, groaning.
With resignation, the dark haired boy turned back to the horizon in front of him. He noticed that although the sky in the far distance was bright and beautiful, the sky above was silvery grey. He thought of Malfoy’s eyes, and how they were almost the same shade as the sky he was looking at now. Almost. Malfoy’s eyes were so versatile, meaning namely that they changed with his mood. When he was seething with bitter anger, they were pale and burning. When he closed himself off, they were cold and calculating. And then, Harry saw, just now, a shade of Malfoy’s eyes that he never had before. It was as if they were swimming and alight. Harry decided subconsciously that he liked those eyes of Malfoy’s the best.
Draco chuckled darkly, “Goodbye, Potter,” he said and turned to leave. But before he could, Potter yanked him around and slammed his lips into the Slytherin’s, their teeth clashing together.
Draco felt his heart beating in his throat. Was…was Potter actually flirting with him? He chuckled almost nervously, trying to collect himself.
“Harry, I – I don’t want you to…” Harry started unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, leaning in to pepper kisses along his jawline, “…You to suffer for th – this.” At that Harry chuckled darkly, running his hand up Draco’s now bare chest.
Draco glowered at Blaise, desperate to retort with a scathing remark, but he was having a difficult time finding one. Pansy was finally starting to collect herself.
Draco thought about how soft Potter’s lips were instead of listening to the lecture he was supposed to be attuned to. He thought about how soft they were, and how he was going to miss them. Surely that was the last time that something like that would happen.
Draco blinked at the disheveled boy. He tried not to laugh at the sight of him, glasses askew, hair messier than normal. “I wasn’t aware that I was supposed to.”
When potions was finished, Harry, Hermione and Ron walked off towards the stairs, making it a point to ignore Malfoy and his posse.
Draco clumsily pulled Harry’s trousers down to about mid-thigh, leaving the boy beneath him almost exposed. His mouth left the other’s and wandered to his neck. Time to return the favor. Draco bit and sucked along Harry’s neck, being careful as to not leave love bites. With both hands free now, he used them to easily pull the Gryffindor’s undergarments down to join his trousers.
Admittedly, he relished in being alone at times like these. Here, he didn’t have to worry about blemishing the carefully constructed image he had. He could act however he wanted to. Honestly, it was always in these moments that he felt most reliable within himself.
Harry was glaring at him, wand drawn and ready. They were the only two in room. “Why are you here, Malfoy?” The words were spoken with venom.
Silence followed as Malfoy stood above Harry, a curious stare enveloping the both of them. After several moments, Malfoy spoke:
“I like the foxes,” said a voice from behind Harry, but he didn’t jump or startle. It was like he knew this voice. He turned to see a little girl in one of the armchairs, reading what looked to be a muggle children’s book. She had dark hair, and pink bandages on a scratched up knee of hers. She was barefoot.
Draco stormed down the corridors, heading to no place in particular. He felt very strange. His chest felt tight, as if it were being constricted; his heart wasn’t right either, pulsing with bullets of pain. But at the same time, he knew this feeling was good. His body felt like it would explode, but he was undeniably excited. About what? Well, Draco had an idea, but he wasn’t extremely fond of it.
“For practically three hours? I find that quite unlikely.” Harry blinked at Hermione, not understanding why she was acting so suspicious of him.
He and Pansy had sat down on the loveseat nearest where Draco was working, looking at him with bewildered and humored expressions.
Harry, throwing his inhibition and sense out of the window, pressed himself into Draco’s kiss, into the other boy’s embrace. With this Draco couldn’t help but moan softly, melting into Harry’s touch. Surprisingly, Harry was the one who pressed further, opening his mouth and prodding Draco’s lips with his tongue. Draco more than happily obliged, opening up as the Gryffindor slipped his tongue inside.
“I got your bloody note, Malfoy!” Harry pulled out the paper crane note given to him that day during potions. “ ‘Scared, Potter?’? You think I don’t know what that means?!”
“Oh Harry…” Malfoy’s voice was laced with kindess and care. Something Harry never in a million years could have pictured.
Harry groaned, sounding pained as he gripped the sides of his head in frustration, “I don’t know!” He called out, louder than he probably should have.
Malfoy growled when Harry broke the kiss and started to work on Malfoy’s neck, nipping and kissing down to the nape. Malfoy ground his stiffening member into Harry’s front, causing the black-haired boy’s breath to hitch. Harry put a knee gently in-between Malfoy’s legs, allowing for them to be closer where it really counted. Malfoy grabbed a handful of Harry’s hair and pulled him back from his neck, almost causing the boy to cry out; he wouldn’t have had the chance anyway when Malfoy reclaimed his lips.
Harry cupped the back of the blond’s head with one of his hands, eliciting a hitch in Draco’s breath. They leaned into one another slowly and deliberately until their lips touched. It was soft and unsure at first, until Draco couldn’t stand it and grabbed the sides of Harry’s face, crushing his lips deeper against his own. This caused the two men to push against the back of Draco’s chair, but neither of them seemed to notice.
“All three I suppose,” Harry responded before he could stop himself. He really didn’t need Hermione finding out about the jolt of fun that he and the Slytherin had in the Room of Requirement.
“I don’t care,” Harry purred into the blond’s ear, “Draco.” When he said his name, Draco had to suppress a moan. Giving in, he clashed his lips against Harry’s once again, a hunger and thirst for something he couldn’t have driving his famished tongue against his lover’s.
Harry came with a cry that sounded desperate and mournful and exhausted all at once. Draco didn’t let go until he was finished, swallowing everything in heavy, rich gulps. The dark-haired boy’s body lied exhausted and spent beneath him, slowly recovering from the harsh burst of ecstasy.
Just as her name was starting to fade, he scrawled onto the parchment: Lysandra. He sighed in relief. He still had her name, he still had her, he still knew her. Even though he had already forgotten what she looked like.
The blond made a muffled noise of utter surprise, his pale eyes going wide. As soon as he registered what was happening, he shoved Potter off of him, wiping away at his mouth as he did so. Disdain filled his eyes as he glared at the other boy, whose eyes were wide with shock at what he’d just done.
Eventually Draco ended up back in the Slytherin common room, but this time he found that it was empty. Everyone was probably at dinner or something along those lines.
When Malfoy left the Room of Requirement, Harry let out a breath that he hadn’t noticed he’d been holding. What in the bloody hell just happened? Before he could feel anything else, anxiety overtook him: what if Malfoy was going to tell Umbridge anyway? What if everything was for nothing? Why had Malfoy said he wouldn’t tell in the first place? Harry scowled at the idea of doing anything for the blond brat, much less whatever the ferret chooses.
“There’s no more snow in here,” Potter said, and when Draco looked at him, he saw that he was smiling. The blond sniffed, his tears slowly dissolving.
Harry didn’t speak right away, but when he did, his voice didn’t feel like his own, “She left because they weren’t hers.”
In his mind, he was with Harry. There was no animosity between the two of them, only a desire to devour, to indulge, to burn and to break. Draco could almost feel Harry’s hands on his bare body, pulling him into a passionate, vengeful kiss. He felt one of Harry’s hands cup the back of his neck whilst the other scratched at his back. Draco whimpered, increasing the speed of his hand. He could feel Harry’s lips trail from his mouth to his jaw, nipping and licking. He could feel the warmth that accompanied the Gryffindor’s touch. Such a hot, wet sensation, the feeling of Harry’s tongue.
With lunch coming to an end, Draco decided it was best if he went ahead and left the mess hall, unaware of a shaggy-haired Gryffindor that thought it necessary to follow him. He turned in the hallway, making his way towards his next class, which happened to be herbology, when he was grabbed from behind by the wrist.
The tanned, dark haired man with the bright green eyes detached himself from Draco’s mouth and instead focused on the pale neck that was stretched out before him. His teeth gently grazed the nape of Draco’s neck before latching onto the spot, sucking fervently.
Harry stared at the spot that Malfoy had been sitting in only seconds ago. What had just happened? He had actually had an enjoyable moment with Draco Malfoy, and nothing terrible happened. Until Malfoy suddenly looked like he was going to puke, and darted off.
“Finally,” Hermione breathed, giving Harry a pointed look, “Do you think you’ll manage to sleep now?”
“And what, pray tell, is so funny, Malfoy?” Harry grumbled, drawing himself away from the Slytherin.
When Malfoy finally started to calm down enough to speak, he responded: “If you somehow manage to get all my teeth and turn them into a necklace, then I’ll just glue your eyelids shut in retaliation. It’s only fair, you know. And you won’t need your glasses anymore either!” Harry allowed himself a wry smile.
“I never said you were!” Draco retorted, balling his hands into fists. The situation was just now truly presenting itself to Draco, showing itself to him in clarity. This…this was not good.
Harry dreamt of someone faceless. He dreamt that someone faceless guided him out of a dark undergrowth into a field, where trees bearing sweet-smelling blossoms grew. He laid down under one of the trees, and the faceless person joined him, gently grasping his hand. The faceless person’s hands were pale and cool, refreshing in the warmth of the dream. The being came closer to Harry until it was leaning over him. For some reason Harry didn’t feel threatened at all, in fact, he couldn’t feel more safe. He closed his eyes and felt the chilling hands of the being brush the hair away from his forehead, gently grazing over his scar. His breath hitched, and as he opened his eyes, more details started to appear on the being’s face. Whoever it was looked so familiar, yet Harry couldn’t place it. Right when the details were becoming clear, Harry awoke with a start.
It was already 11, and Malfoy wasn’t there. Harry let out a long, harsh sigh. Before he could get up to leave, however, he heard the door open. His head snapped up. It was Malfoy.
I always update like, super late at night (or super early in the morning teehee). I know this one's a little short, but like, the next one's a doozy. So I guess hold on tight huh? And don't drink grape soda, it tastes like medicine.
“I wanted to get some fresh air,” Draco explained tiredly, rubbing the back of his neck, “I didn’t expect to see you.”
“If you really thought that there was nothing to be said, then why did you come here?” By the time Potter finished, he was practically touching Draco, his green eyes alight with determination. Draco felt as if he was choking on his own tongue. What could he say? Why did he acquiesce Potter’s demand?
The darker man sat up suddenly, causing Draco to jump. Harry looked into his steely grey eyes, tears threatening to pool over from his own, then wrapped his arms tightly around him, burying his face into the nape of Draco’s neck. Draco felt the tears as they silently fell from Harry’s eyes, the dark haired man trembling with each unknowable sob.
“And you didn’t think to tell us until now, huh?” Ron exclaimed as quietly as he could to avoid inquisitive ears.
The cold of the stone underneath him was sobering, and he savored it. Hopefully it would make his hands go numb.
The day was cool and the sky was grey. The air smelled crisp and the wind blew cold. This was Draco’s favorite time of year. It was in the brunt of Autumn, and the world was getting ready for winter. He decided to sit outside for a while, alone. Sometimes he allowed himself to be washed over by thoughts he was trying to keep out. At least, problems that didn’t involve his father, the Dark Lord or anything along those lines. Those he tried to never think about.
Draco’s head was not with him. Not in the figurative way, at least. No, Draco’s head was with a small strip of paper in the back of one of his books with a name written on it. Lysandra. Who was she? He’d already forgotten what she looked like, but he’d never be able to forget the feelings she’d caused. How could anyone or anything make him feel so hopeless and so inspired all at once?
Potter huffed, brow furrowed. It was at this that Draco’s face adopted a smug expression as he added, “And you were snoring, so I knew you weren’t comatose.” Potter actually blushed a light pink with embarrassment, avoiding looking at Draco altogether.
“Yes!” she burst out after a moment, almost causing Draco to jump. He waited for her to continue, but she didn’t. Draco sighed, feeling impatience creeping into his mind.
Draco chuckled darkly, moving ever closer to Potter, “That’s what you’d like to think isn’t it? But I’d make it so quick that you wouldn’t have time to even think.”
“Sure you ‘despise’ him, but he’s basically all you bloody well talk about. I’d even wager that this secret you’re dangling over Pansy’s head is about Potter too. You’re not sneaky, mate,” Blaise said cooly, returning to his homework.
He hated that he’d enjoyed the banter the two of them shared on the breezeway so much. He hated that he wanted more than anything to mess with Potter’s untameable hair as it was blown by the wind. He hated the way he fell into those evergreen eyes, how they electrified a part of him that he didn’t know existed. Draco had never felt like this with anyone but Potter. And probably the most horrifying part to Draco was that he couldn’t pinpoint exactly when these feelings started. He’d spent so much time shoving down this revelation, that he’d more than likely forgotten about it.
“Lumos!” he shouted, and a pool of gentle white light poured out of the tip of his wand, only to illuminate the face of Potter, who was shielding his eyes.
Draco clumsily crashed into an empty table, scattering his things. He drew his wand on instinct, fury and self-preservation fueling him. It was so dark in there, whoever grabbed him must have shut the door. His breathing was labored as adrenaline pumped through his system.
Harry grumbled something unitelligable as he looked suspiciously around the dining hall. Why was everyone so loud this morning? Why was the sun so bright? Why did he get out of bed??
And with that, Draco’s mouth descended slowly onto Harry. In response to the sudden hot, wet pressure that surrounded him, Harry tossed his head back, staring at the ceiling. Since he was without his glasses, it was quite a blurry ceiling, but that didn’t really matter since he wasn’t registering anything but the sensation of Draco’s mouth around his cock anyway.
“Pansy please, do us all a favor and shut your yapping hole,” Draco whispered harshly, grinding his teeth. The girl reeled back, an offended look on her face. Blaise and Theo could hardly contain their laughter. Snape continued to ignore them.
His eyes glazed over with thought as he remembered Potter’s lips. Their kiss had been brash and hungry, sloppy and immature. It was far from a good kiss, but Draco didn’t feel the need to score it by any means. He hadn’t had many other kisses to compare it to, after all. But the special thing about this was that is was Harry Potter’s kiss; it was Harry Potter’s lips locked against his own. After all, not many people can say that they’ve snogged Harry Potter.
“I…” he started, feeling his control over his emotions start to slip away, “I’ve got to go.” Draco quickly gathered his things as Potter blinked, a look of confusion on his face.
Their mouths parted as they deepened the kiss, Harry wrapping Draco tightly in his arms as the blond raked his hands through his lover’s hair. They shivered against one another, the anticipation and impossibility of this moment taking its toll on both parties.
Leaning against the post, Draco reminisced about how Harry had looked when he was asleep. All of his expression smoothed into one of blissful slumber. His tan skin gentle and welcoming and comfortable in appearance. He looked like fire, warm and fierce and beautiful. But if he wasn’t careful, Draco would get burned.
Feeling listless, Draco gathered his things slowly as the class was dismissed, other students swarming to get out of the classroom. He got up and mixed in with the crowd, but startled when he felt something aggravate a pocket of his robe. Immediately he shoved his hand inside, only to feel a crumpled up piece of paper. Draco looked up, and was met with a shocking pair of green eyes, glancing at him knowingly from the room’s doorway. Potter had just slipped him a bloody note. Draco didn’t know the git was capable of such stealth.
This Draco knew, but it still hurt to remind himself of it. He could hardly admit it even to himself, but he cared for Potter. And the prospect of not being able to be in the life or proximity of someone you care about would hurt anyone. Even cold, calloused Draco Malfoy. No, the best way to avoid a rebuttle of epic porportions was to simply avoid Potter in every possible way. That meant no picking fights with him or his friends, no snooping around looking for his posse, no thinking about his careful smile, or his hungry green eyes behind those ridiculous glasses, or his unruly unreasonable mane of hair that drove Draco mad. Nope. None of that.
He watched the Gryffidors dip, dive and soar, disappearing occasionally to discuss technique and whatnot. Potter was unmistakable with his wild black hair. Draco sighed gently. That night in the Room of Requirement had been over two weeks ago. He hadn’t talked to Potter since. What would he say anyway? What would Potter say?
Harry had been worrying about all of those things, they’d just so happened to be taking a back seat for the time being.
When Harry calmed down, Draco resumed threading his fingers through his lover’s hair. They stayed that way, looking into the dying embers when Harry spoke, his voice hoarse,
The boy shuddered, suddenly bothered by the cold engulfing him. He needed to get back inside. He needed to stop watching Potter and his entrancing broomwork. He needed to sleep.
Running a hand through his hair nervously, Harry’s mind began to whir like gears in a clock. Truth be told, he was just desperate for some, any, of Malfoy’s attention. Now that he knew Malfoy still knew he existed, thanks to Neville, it seemed as though Harry couldn’t keep the blond out of his thoughts. He’d been able to keep thoughts about the Room of Requirement and Malfoy to a minimum, but all of that work seemed futile now. He’d actually gotten head from Draco bleeding Malfoy. The thought made him cover his face with his hands, a steady blush forming. Oh this wasn’t like Harry at all.
“Oh fuck’s sake Harry! She’s just using you as a desperate means to hide pain. And hiding pain never amounts to anything but more pain.” Harry rarely heard Hermione curse, and when she did, it was typically when she was extremely stressed or entirely furious. Now, she was just tired and grumpy.
“Bloody impossible…” Draco dourly murmured to himself, thinking once again of those very features he told himself to despise.
“Bet you they got caught up snogging each other and lost track of time,” Pansy hissed, sniggering harshly. Draco would be lying if he said he didn’t feel like throwing up. Just the thought of being close in proximity to the Weasel was enough to make Draco sick. He didn’t want to think of Harry liplocked with the redhead.
“Of course I do. We just didn’t know that we were in love with each other. That I love you.” At the mention of love, Draco’s breath was caught in his throat. It was true, Harry loved Draco, and Draco felt the same. But neither of them had had the sense to know it when it could have counted for something. Or so Harry thought, but Draco knew better.
“Hermione, you know I haven’t been getting enough sleep these nights, and the dorms were too noisy. So naturally I went to the library, and caught up on some much needed sleep. Is that good enough for you?”
Her words just confused Draco further, and he felt his heart twist at the sight of her. Pain contorted his face as more tears escaped. The little girl didn’t pull her hands away though. Draco couldn’t decide if he was grateful for this or not.
“W-what? Don’t be absurd! I just had to make sure you weren’t up to something like spying on me for Umbridge or something….” The words tapered off as both boys looked at each other intently. Draco’s grey eyes were alight with mischief.
Before Draco could properly react to what he was seeing, his stomach did a little summersault as he saw a familiar mop of black hair resting on the table Draco was aiming for. He smirked to himself, forgetting most everything else around him.
“Because you’re taunting me! You want me to constantly be one edge! Worried about if you’ll tell Umbridge or not!”
Silence overtook them both then, as the weight of the situation started to become apparent. Yes. That really just happened. There was no use denying it. And Harry had enjoyed every second of it, but he’d die before admitting so.
His voice shaking, Harry responded, “Why were you on the ledge?!” He didn’t want to admit how terrified he had been upon seeing Draco perched on the railing, looking as if at any second he would topple off. Harry was trembling.
“Frighten you did I, Malfoy?” the Gryffindor replied coolly, soaking in Draco’s anger like a sponge.
Harry tried to concentrate on the work before him, but with all that happened with Malfoy the other day mixed with his low voice chatting non-stop with his friends, Harry felt he could feasibly submit himself to a psych ward. Hermione could tell Harry was agitated, and cast a glaring look behind her at Malfoy.
“Hopefully it’s nothing serious,” Hermione finally responded to Neville, “He wasn’t with anyone, was he?”
Draco could barely speak, but he managed to choke out, “Her. She’s gone, Harry.” Potter sat down in front of Draco, grabbing a hold of his hands.
As the dream faded away, Harry swiftly forgot it, pushing it back into the catalogue of his mind to be lost and forgotten about. In the morning, it would be nothing but a nagging sensation.
Harry, panicking slightly, whipped his head up only to be met with Malfoy barely containing his laughter. The black haired boy’s eyes narrowed, annoyance spreading across his face.
“I suppose I do,” Harry murmured, running a hand through his hair. He got his glasses and put them back on unceremoniously. Anything to avoid interacting more with Malfoy.
Potter looked dejected, almost desperate as he responded, “Oh bollocks, Malfoy!” With these words, Potter was on his feet, nearer to Draco and closing the distance.
As tongues moved together sloppily, Draco’s hand fumbled with the button and zipper of Harry’s pants. There were no coherent thoughts in either boy’s head. There was nothing but desire, nothing but impatient want. Need. A thirst that ran rampant throughout one boy and swiftly into the other. It didn’t make any real sense, but made perfect sense all at once. But they were largely unconcerned with petty matters such as what was or wasn’t nonsensical, they were too distracted with the fire burning inside of themselves.
“Come on Hermione, I may be ugly, but I’m not that ugly,” Harry sighed, absentmindedly popping a grape into his mouth.
“Speak for yourself; you’d never get to see the look on my face when I best you. I think that’s the truest tragedy you’d be facing.”
His pants were getting tighter with each twitch of his member. Draco gasped delicately, palming himself over the fabric of his trousers. The way that Potter – that Harry had looked at him earlier was almost too much for Draco. It was as if Harry was a wolf fixing to devour him. There was something deliciously predatory about the way Harry’s eyes had gazed at him.
Harry walked down the hallway, eyes to the ground and lost in thought. He didn’t know what to do about the whole Malfoy situation. He knew that he couldn’t trust the slytherin, it would be maddness to even consider it, but what other option did he have? It wasn’t like he could kidnap him and hold him hostage until the end of the term. He couldn’t murder him and feed his corpse to the giant squid in the lake. They’d know it was him. Although Harry enjoyed thinking about it, admittedly.
“…But we both know that this is going nowhere. And it’s going nowhere fast,” Draco continued as if Harry hadn’t spoken, “I think it would be wise for both of our sakes if we just nip this in the bud. If we stop this before it even begins.”
Draco moaned, but with the weight of Harry on top of him and his lips on the nape of his neck, he steadily came back to himself.
The boy huffed, flinging himself onto the couch that Pansy had been sitting on earlier. He reached up into a basket that rested on an end table and pulled out a green apple. His favorite. He took a big, crunchy bite, savoring the juices that trickled down his chin.
Cursing quietly, Draco continued forward at a faster pace, his footsteps echoing with force throughout the now empty hall. He was thinking about how ridiculous he had been for spending this much time brooding about a bloody name, when he felt a hand wrap around his wrist and yank him into a dark room. He did not succeed in suppressing a yelp.
The other boy looked into Harry’s eyes, a pleasant emotion swirling behind them. After a moment of charged eye contact, Draco breathed airily, lowly, “Then pray tell, how would you go about murdering your rival?” A hint of a smile pressed against his lips.
Harry’s lips parted willingly, almost needily for Draco, and the Slytherin obliged. They fought for dominance, and when they finally parted for air, foreheads resting together, Harry continued:
“But what if something had happened to you? What if Malfoy hexed you and you were incapacitated and…” Hermione was cut off by the chuckling coming from Harry.
Draco whipped his body around to see Potter staring at him, terror written on his face, in his eyes. He ran over to the Slytherin, dropping the homework he’d brought with him. As fast as he could, Potter wrapped his arms around Draco and yanked him off the rail, causing them to fall back onto one another. They landed thickly on the stone floor, neither boy escaping pain.
Harry huffed, knowing that they were right. He was tired of having to constantly watch his back. He was tired of the fear that was swelling around the school. The fear that had been building ever since he’d arrived to Hogwarts. He was tired of of the paranoia.
Harry turned sharply on his heels to be faced with none other than Hermione. He huffed out a short breath, blowing his bangs up briefly.
Draco took a moment to catch his breath before he bothered to reply. With the adrenaline rapidly leaving his body, he suddenly felt very tired, and so leaned himself against the table he crashed into. He really wished this wouldn’t become a regular occurrence with the Boy Who Lived. The bastard.
After a contemplative moment or two, Draco gathered his things and headed out into the common room to work on some assignments. It would be an effective means of killing time, whilst also enabling him to wait until the others had gone to bed to sneak out. He soon found that he had a good bit of difficulty focusing on his schoolwork, and instead started to daydream.
“And we’re just supposed to trust his word? Harry, are you listening to yourself?” Hermione was quick to retort, her hands tightening around the books she was holding.
She hummed as if she didn’t believe him, but shrugged and stretched, turning to talk to Silas Hydra, a Slyterin in the seventh year. Draco said a silent prayer of relief that for once the girl didn’t pry; she must’ve been preoccupied with Silas. All the better.
“Oh nothing,” Draco sighed, recovering from his burst of laughter, “It’s just that the infamous Harry Potter just received head from the son of Lucius Malfoy. That’s all.”
“What do you want, Potter?” Draco asked, exasperated. His eyes flittered around nervously, anxious that someone would see them and get suspicious.
“I did,” Draco whispered. Harry looked at him, his eyes widened. Draco knew the question on his mind. “I knew I loved you, but I assumed you didn’t feel the same way. Especially after everything that ended up happening,” with this, Draco absentmindedly brought a hand up to trace over the scars on his chest. Harry felt his stomach churn.
The Slytherin common room was, on this particular day, extremely noisy. There were younger kids shrieking about one thing or another, and some of the older ones decided it was a good idea to start a drinking game. Although, being a Friday after class was done, Draco didn’t see the real harm here.
The girl tossed her book to the ground, got up and all but jumped against Harry, wrapping her arms around him. He held her back, suddenly getting the urge to cry.
“Because you love her, you imbicile,” Harry swung around to see Malfoy sitting in the chair next to the one the little girl sat in.
Draco moved slowly until all of Harry was inside of his mouth. Sucking delicately, he pulled up until he reached the head, where he plunged down again. This continued for several turns, each time Draco descended causing harry to groan hoarsely as if in pain.
Shortly after Malfoy hurried out of the library, Harry wandered back to the Gryffindor dorms, forcing himself to think of nothing else but the meetings for the DA. Things had been going well, or as well as they could be. Malfoy still hadn’t told Umbridge and that was a relief. Come to think of it, why hadn’t Malfoy ratted Harry out to Umbridge? It wasn’t as if he owed Harry anything.
“Was it just me, or was Malfoy a lot more of a git today than usual?” Ron mumbled as they headed up the stairs.
With his glasses askew, Harry looked almost like a lost child. “I need to figure this out. I don’t like not knowing. Please, help me.”
The blond spit into his hand, using it as makeshift lubrication as he stroked up and down his shaft. Draco let his head roll back as he grazed over the head with his thumb, only to come down with vigor. He bucked into his own hand, gasping.
As they walked out of the infirmary, Ron began to ask Harry about the upcoming night’s DA meeting. “Ah, actually Ron,” Harry started, running a hand nervously through his disheveled hair, “I’m going to take a break from it tonight. And I think everyone else should too. We all need a moment to relax, don’t you think?”
Not thinking about getting the others, he ran up to the door before it could vanish again, and slipped inside the spacious room. Cool air brushed against his face. It looked to be a dueling room of some sorts, with mirrors and platforms scattered around the enormous area. It seemed far too big of a space from how it looked in the corridor. The doors quickly shut tight behind him, causing him to jump.
“I’m fine,” He repeated, his eyes flashing down to Harry’s lips before returning to his eyes. “I’m fine.” Neither boy was really thinking as they slowly started to close the gap between their faces.
Sighing with relief, Harry thanked Ron and they walked the rest of the way to Potions in content silence.
Sleep had not been a thing that came easy to Draco, especially over these past weeks. He’d started to have to brew his own sleeping draughts in order to get barely three hours. The bags under his eyes were starting to get bad. Perhaps now, during the gentle light of day, sleep would come easier to him. Yes, he needed to go and try to sleep.
More silence followed, Harry being careful not to spur her on. He didn’t fancy suffering through a Hermione rant at 3 o’clock in the morning. Finally, she huffed and turned her whole body to face him:
The dark haired girl groaned and closed her book. She stared pointedly at Draco, familiar with this game of his. “Ok Draco, you don’t have to tell me. In fact, it would probably be better if you didn’t. I’m simply dreadful at keeping secrets, as you know.” She donned an expression of mock sympathy, putting more whine than was natural into her voice. Hoping that Draco picked up on her sarcasm.
Without realizing what he was doing, he looked up and over to the Slytherin table, quickly catching sight of the bright shock of blond hair. Malfoy looked just as calm, collected and condescending as he always had. Harry knew he’d been watching him for too long when suddenly grey eyes met his. The Gryffindor quickly jerked his head away, fighting the warmth that was gathering in his cheeks.
“You’ll meet me one day,” she continued, pressing her forehead against his, “You’re so cold. So so cold.” And with those words she faded away, leaving Draco to cry out helplessly into no one. The world felt as if it was falling. The pain and emptiness Draco felt was unparallelled. She was gone. She was gone and Draco knew in his heart that he’d never see her again. But why did he care so much? Who was she? Why was her name so very important? Lysandra.
Lmao sorry it's been so long since i've updated this fic, it's still active though I promise. Enjoy.
“And you’re even stranger, Malfoy,” Potter responded sharply, following Draco’s movements with his own.
“Oh,” she said airily, coming down from the laughter high, “Oh that would be rich. And It’d make a fuck load of sense, too. The lengths you go to… brilliant.”
Harry didn’t understand what was happening, especially within his own head, his own body. And as his temperature rose, his decorum diminished. He found that with each passing second, he cared less about holding his thoughts and emotions back. So he continued:
This thought brought a wry smile to Draco’s face as he forgot himself in his own train of thought. A train of thought that was interrupted by Theo:
A short distance in front of him, he could see nice, expensive looking fireplace, and two brown leather chairs in front of it. He approached it, his heart beating fast with anticipation. There was a well-sized fire in the hearth, and as Harry grew closer, he felt the warmth more. When he was inbetween the armchairs he stopped, staring deeply into the heart of the fire. Slowly his eyes looked up at the mantle, to see that it was carved. Images of deer and foxes repeated throughout twiting celtic knots and vines.
He knew it was too dangerous to try. He knew nothing would ever come of his feelings, and that they were just a useless, painful fantasy. But still, they were Draco’s and they were real. No one could take his feelings and fantasies away from him; he wouldn’t let them.
“Umbridge again, hm? When will you get it through your thick skull, Potter? I’m not a puppet for that damn woman. But that’s beside the point, isn’t it?” It felt as though a cat was circling a mouse, dangerous. Draco continued:
“Shit!” was all he could manage to bite out before falling back onto the ground, books and papers scattering. He was just glad that there was hardly anyone around to see that. Except for Ron, who had been rambling about quidditch and whatnot. When Harry plowed into the column, the redhead couldn’t contain his mirth, and spilled over into laughter.
“Oh.” Potter gingerly pulled back. Draco felt as though he had gotten the answer wrong to a question he didn’t even know was being asked.
“Because of your eyes,” Harry heard, felt himself say, even though he had no idea the meaning or implications behind the words. He didn’t even know who the “she” that the little girl asked of was.
Content to listen to Seamus ramble on about the girl in Charms who was apparently undressing him with her eyes, Harry happily shoveled food into his mouth. So busy enjoying himself was Harry that he didn’t notice that Neville was gazing worriedly at him. Hermione, however, did.
The library was understandably not very busy. No student was going to be studying or doing homework on a Friday unless the term was coming to an end, or they were Granger. Sighing, Draco walked past shelf after shelf, heading towards his favorite study area near the back of the library, where the chance that someone would interrupt him was slim.
So caught in all the reasons why Potter was deplorable, that Draco didn’t even notice where he was. As he started to round a corner, he spotted a familiar head of black, shaggy hair. Potter. He was looking around cautiously before a door appeared and he entered it. Draco’s eyes widened. So that’s where Potter and his herd got off to.
Harry seethed, crumbling up the paper and shoving it in his robe’s pocket. He refused to turn around and look at Malfoy. He really just wanted to hit him.
Potter put up his hands in a gesture of surrender, wincing at the harshness of the light in his eyes.
“Harry!” Ron laughed, squatting next to his friend. “I had no idea your eyesight was that bad, mate!”
Draco and his friends went on to the great hall for lunch, sitting down with the rest of the Slytherins. The table was bustling with energy, everyone excited for winter break to commence. It was only a week and a half away, after all. Kids all over were chattering about what they were expecting to do for the break, but Draco deigned to tune most of them out in favor of his own thoughts. Potter would probably be staying there at the castle for Christmas, it seemed as if he always did. Not that it mattered to Draco. If he didn’t come home for the holiday, then his mother would be heartbroken. How did his thoughts always return to Potter?
Harry let out a shaky sigh of relief that turned into a nervous chuckle. “No, none of that tonight. I’m not that despicable….”
“I wasn’t going to jump, if that’s what you were thinking, Potter.” Harry was still visibly shaken. He barked out several bursts of joyless laughter as his eyes filled with detestable tears. He would not cry, especially in front of Malfoy. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he just wanted to wrap his arms tightly around Draco, to prove to himself that he was real. They both were.
“Come off it, Malfoy, I know you were watching me. Neville saw you on the bench near the Herbology classroom and he said that you never took your eyes off of me.”
“I’m…so so sorry Draco,” Harry whispered between quiet tears. Draco could only nod and hold him, having forgiven him long ago for the sectumsempra curse.
As his two friends continued on their way throughout the now nearly empty corridor, Harry absentmindedly put his hands in his robe pockets. Upon feeling the crumpled up piece of paper, he remembered the paper crane. ‘Scared, Potter?’ Harry glowered at the thought of Malfoy taunting him. Why did the prick even give a damn enough to torment him? Deciding that he didn’t care, Harry sighed and caught up with his friends.
Harry briskly walked up and snatched the blond’s wand, which had landed several feet from the slytherin himself. “What was that now?” He asked with a smug face.
Harry thought about it. Honestly, it was a solid idea. He sighed warily and nodded his head, “I’m sure it wouldn’t hurt to try at least.”
Madame Pomfrey took this moment to arrive with the healing draught for Harry’s nose, “One spoonful if you please, Mr. Potter.” Harry obliged. It was a putrid looking bronze elixir.
The problem was that Malfoy seemed to still be doing his utmost to ignore Harry’s very existence. And he was doing this very well. Not even a snide quip here or there, not even to Harry’s friends! But apparently he still had enough interest to stalk his quidditch practice.
“Oh no, you’re crying,” the little girl’s voice seemed to bring him back to himself, and the time around them started again. She reached out to his face, and rubbed at the tears with the heels of her palms.
He heard the sound of tired feet walking down the steps of the girls’ side of the dorms, and tensed automatically. Interaction with a random Gryffindor girl was something he didn’t particularly need at the moment.
“I – I – I…” Harry stammered, disgust for himself welling up, threatening to overflow. What had he… what had he just done? “I don’t know what…” he found himself unable to articulate what he wanted or needed to say.
“What?” Draco breathed, scratching his palms against the rough stone to wake himself up if this was a dream.
Draco walked briskly up to the table, and slammed his books down next to Potter, causing the boy to jump up in terror. Draco was trying unsuccessfully to hold in his laughter.
Gently, Draco leaned forward and brushed some of Potter’s fringe out of his face, catching a glimpse of the famous scar that Voldemort had left. He felt his breath catch in his throat. The Slytherin wondered if the scar ever hurt Potter. He didn’t really want to find out.
Draco took one look at Harry and sighed dejectedly, allowing his shoulders to slump ever so slightly. “Look,” He began, “I’m sure that I can understand where your paranoia is coming from. But I still think you’re being a touch ridiculous.”
Feeling Draco’s chilled hands gliding across his skin, Harry shivered, arching closer to the warmth of Draco’s body. When they broke for air this time, the boy with the messy, dark hair immediately found the other’s pale neck, latching on with hunger.
Harry was restless. He had been all day since he’d concocted this plan. His legs bounced nervously as he sat on the couch the Room of Requirement had provided him with. He hadn’t known quite what it was he’d be needing, but the room did. The room always knew.
Dinners at the Gryffindor table were always something to behold. There would be loud conversations overlapping and competing with one another, light-hearted arguments that would almost always end with food being thrown around playfully, and obnoxious snooping for who got what on what assignment. Overall, it was a pretty great time if one was in the mood for it.
Draco moaned unceremoniously, feeling his pants grow tight. Suddenly the temperature in the room was far too hot for him to handle.
“How could you not be sure? It’s bloody Malfoy we’re talking about! The git who would love nothing more than to see you in deep shit.” Ron was turning pink, his breathing becoming unsteady with anxiety.
Draco could tell that something changed in the conversation he and Potter were having. It had been dare he say, pleasant. And then Potter suddenly grew rigid, glaring at Draco. Wasn’t Potter just grinning and bantering along with him? The Slytherin sighed ruefully, understanding that the moment of civility was gone.
Thinking back to the look of shock and excitement in those steely grey eyes of Malfoys as Harry retaliated confidently caused a bloom of warmth to blossom in his chest. His stomach felt strange too. Almost like the proverbial butterflies one feels in the stomach when thinking of or seeing one’s crush.
“That just means you’ll get hurt all the more once they do lie,” Draco sighed as Potter raised a hand as if to cup the blond’s cheek. He wanted so badly to lean into the touch, his heart swelling. Why did it have to be like this? Why did everything have to hurt?
With how busy things had been getting over the last several weeks, Harry had hardly thought about the night with Malfoy in the Room of Requirement. Things were going well with the DA, he was now apparently dating Cho Chang, and he’d managed to keep Umbridge out of his hair… for the most part. It was surprisingly rare that he even thought about Malfoy, which almost surprised Harry. Well, his mind had been pretty occupied as of late.
Before he could finish, Malfoy had pulled him down onto the couch, against himself, and crashed their lips together.
Malfoy laughed delicately, “I live here, Harry!” There was something different about Malfoy. He was happy. Genuinely happy. An emotion Harry had never seen the other boy wear before. It was eerie, but addicting as well. He’d called Harry by his first name.
“Well if you’re sure,” Hermione sighed, trailing off. Harry nodded to her and they went their separate ways, getting all their affairs in order before that night’s assembly of Dumbledore’s Army.
“I promise,” Potter was slowly moving in closer, “One of us has to, after all. And I’ve already forgotten. But you? You won’t allow yourself to forget her, Draco.”
Harry remained passively silent for the rest of dinner, his mind taking up most of his attention span. He didn’t want to think about this now, not whilst he was awake. He forced all thoughts of Malfoy to the back of his mind and was able to act like his normal self until he got ready for bed.
He sighed, “I suppose I’m just worrying about everything. Between the DA, Umbridge, and Voldemort coming back, I’m just feeling overwhelmed.” It was a rather decent lie, because it wasn’t a lie at all.
“You’re… my… everything,” He growled out, hitting deep with the last word. Draco panted, desperate for release for them both. Harry must have read his mind, because one of the other man’s hands gripped Draco’s length, pumping in time with the thrusts. It didn’t take long for that to do the trick, and Draco was coming with a moan so loud that it cracked.
“I don’t give a damn about Umbridge,” Draco bit back, snarling, “I just love watching you crash and burn.”
Harry narrowed his eyes at the blond, suspicion evident in his eyes. He didn’t trust Malfoy one bit, but there wasn’t all that much he could do to stop him if he decided to tell Umbridge.
“My parents are taking the family to Paris for Christmas,” Pansy said, puffing out her chest with pride, “I can’t wait to see what it looks like covered in snow.”
Hermione huffed with indignation, “Then just tell us now! What happened Harry? Is Malfoy going to tell Umbridge about the Room? How much danger are we in?”
Draco rolled his eyes and huffed, “Yes Potter, now you know. So glad I could help you along on your journey of self discovery. Just what I’ve always dreamt of.”
Draco dragged his hand along the railing of the staircase, hurrying so it wouldn’t change with him on it. His thoughts a little bit scattered, he approached the top, his footsteps a clear sound on the stone steps. Eventually his mind settled on Potter, he thought the name with disdain. He hated him, truly utterly and deeply. Or at least that’s what he’s tried to convince himself. Yes he definitely hated Potter, with his hero complex and evergreen eyes and his outrageously unkempt black hair.
