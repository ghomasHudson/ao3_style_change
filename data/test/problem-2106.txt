“I’m sorry, Mother, Father, if you’re watching me from your Afterlife. I think I made the wrong choice after all,” Draco chuckled mirthlessly as he got up for the day. He’s taken to fingering his wedding ring these days which calmed him down whenever thoughts of death threatened to overpower him, such as now.
“They’ll be great once you wear them,” Harry didn’t look up at Draco when he said that. He was feeling the woolen sweater between his fingers and was awash with a feeling of loneliness. He really missed the Weasleys.
“Not like me. I had to live and fight with the knowledge that sometime during the war, I must let Voldemort (‘Don’t say his name!’ Draco interjected but Harry continued) kill me. I walked to my death, Draco. So don’t you stand there and tell me that we had equal responsibilities then.”
“I don’t understand you,” Draco shook his head exasperatedly. Harry’s moods and words to him were worse than an unexpected whiplash. Just a few moments ago, the man was quivering with unbidden rage, and then was jumping in joy and now; he’s acting all saint-like. Like the Savior Draco always despised.
With a last fleeting look at Rose and the others, Draco walked past the ward, cradling a tightness in his chest which was almost the weight of a hundred giants put together. The second hardest part was journeying through the crowd scattered in the ground floor towards the Floo Networks. Every look pierced him like a thousand needles. He could hear them blame him even with their mouths tightly smashed shut into a thin line. Their respect and love for Harry Potter only kept him safe from their wrath.
Harry sighed. He didn’t want to be there being treated like a person who’s broken in their head. Yet, he was the one who implored his best friends to help him. Even as he sat on a comfortable chair in his Mind Healer’s office, he could see flashes of blood and he could hear howls of pain and terror. He wanted it all gone.
“You don’t get to question me and I’d appreciate if you let the cat out of the bag now,” Draco failed at his attempt to speak calmly. The words he kept hidden were threatening to spill and if Harry didn’t answer him, he’d be utterly vicious and unforgiving.
“I must eat, huh?” he chuckled but made no move to get up. He was too upset to fill his insides with anything but smoke.
“The last time he was here, I wasn’t bothered,” Draco divulged sharply. Though he was still apprehensive about his situation with Harry, Draco wanted to communicate with his husband. The tiny bit of hope lurking around the corners of his heart wanted a chance to mend the battered tapestry that was their lives.
That was the point of time where Draco broke character for possibly the third or fourth time in his entire life. The Malfoys’ indifference was so deeply ingrained into him that no matter what happened, he always kept his cool, kept his face. He lost it while carrying out the Dark Lord’s orders to kill Dumbledore and during the Dark Lord’s stay at his home, the Manor. He wanted to be saved but couldn’t find refuge anywhere until he was completely removed of such an opportunity by being thrown into the Azkaban. Harry hadn’t come to any of their trails. His Mother assured him during the dark lonely cramped nights after that Harry Potter would speak for them at least, if not for Lucius, and then they wouldn’t be sent to Azkaban. Yet when the day finally came, when the culprits were brought in for the Wizengamot to judge, the absence of Harry Potter weighed heavily on not only his Mother’s heart but also his’. When no help came from the Golden Boy even after years, Draco made peace that there was no escape and tried to be brave in the face of all his fears that the Azkaban dangled in front of his eyes even when he was asleep.
Draco simply nodded his head. Back to Azkaban now; back to where he belonged. Right now, even it seemed a better option than staying and being judged by Harry, the one person who gave him a second chance which he wasted with impromptu decisions of his own. His life had been a mistake after all. People like him never change. They commit the same mistakes over and over again and reap what they sow until they end up dead. Death is the only respite he and people like him were ever going to get from all the drama.
“You imbecile!” Hermione screeched, much like their late Professor, Severus Snape. The reminder caused him to flinch involuntarily as he stood rooted to the ground.
Harry knew. It was all about his past and the loss the Weasleys' suffered because of him, no matter how indirectly or how small of a part he played in starting the war from the wrong side. After all these years, there still are people who condemn reformed children of Death Eaters and want them to be eliminated off the face of the Wizarding World. For a while, Harry believed that whoever followed Voldemort or even had such an intention was to be killed without a second thought. His mind then had been clouded with nothing but anger and unbridled hatred for those who hadn't been on Dumbledore's side during the war. It wasn't until much later when he saw the Weasleys helping a few innocent and orphaned children of Death Eaters in the camps the Ministry graciously yet thoughtlessly installed, Harry realized that maybe Death was too big of a punishment for being born into the family of a Death Eater. It wasn't their choice.
“No. What purpose would it serve? I already freed you,” Harry’s eyes found Draco’s at this instant, an action which seemed too intimate and overbearing at the same time for Draco. Yet, he didn’t look away. Nor did he blink as he feared the little moment of companionship formed between them like a fine thread would snap.
It was her turn to remain silent and read her patient for a while. Harry Potter certainly wasn’t the most complex patient she had but he certainly was the most confused.
“I would’ve come sooner but Molly and Ron insisted I stay. I knew you were gone once I saw that Healer Eastoft’s office was empty and I wanted to come for you, really, but I was stopped. We had to take care of Hermione’s discharge and everything,” Harry said.
"Perfect," she beamed at him like a child before plating up his breakfast using her wand and settling it down neatly in front of him. "Eat. You look like you haven't eaten in days."
Harry didn’t look nonplussed by Draco’s admission. It was as if he’d suspected it all along. And it irked Draco and pushed him to elaborate further.
Her words comforted him and strangely, he wanted the session to prolong. He didn’t want to leave her office as he felt the barrier inside his head crack a tiny bit. He wanted her to poke at it until it crumbled and broke down so that all the grief that he locked up inside him would pour out into the invisible glasses she laid out in front of him. For the first time, Harry felt that he could change and not hurt his loved ones anymore with his irrepressible fury.
"Don't," Draco said, shaking his head, his palms fisting the blanket covering him. Yet, the words he feared were spoken aloud by Harry.
“You know, I kept on telling myself that I deserved whatever happened to me. And I still believe it. After all, there is no redemption for Death Eaters like me, is there?” Draco sneered when Harry failed to answer him.
"You're pregnant?" Harry was the first to break the stupor that blanketed them upon Hermione's accidental reveal of her condition.
“Go on,” he said encouragingly and Draco walked in, taking in the house he would now live n and strive to make it into a home.
“Malfoys don’t need to work out, Potter. Besides, look at yourself first,” Draco said without bite, taking a swig from his beer bottle after gesturing at Harry's slightly round midsection, and the situation was too friendly and calm for Harry to point out that Draco wasn’t a Malfoy anymore.
“I wanted to apologize. I know we are not friends, per se, but I want to be. No matter others’ opinions, I believe from the bottom of my heart that what Harry did to you was monstrous and he doesn’t deserve your forgiveness,” Ginny’s hand moved as if to hold Draco’s but she withdrew as it would’ve been awkward.
“- so I came here to discuss us and our situation. I don’t want to lose you,” Harry, at this point, noticed that Draco was eerily quiet. “Are you listening?” he queried but Draco didn’t respond. “Draco?” Harry called out and laid his hand gently on his husband’s rather hot knee. That wasn’t normal. He then proceeded to touch Draco on his stomach and the skin there was extremely hot. So was Draco’s neck and his armpits were like touching fire in all its glory.
His hand stilled in its journey towards Ginny’s sundae at the sudden influx of information. Did she really need to bring Harry up? Then again, he supposed, it didn’t do him any harm. When it settled down in the back of his mind, Draco resumed his journey towards the sundae for another spoon but was denied as Ginny took it out of his reach.
"Sorry about that, doc. He's mean when he's angry," Ron said apologetically, trying to justify Harry's rage and the Healer nodded in understanding.
If Harry wasn't strong enough, Draco couldn't even come close as he could provide no comfort except hold Harry's hands that were around his stomach and bring them close to his chest in a gesture of accepting his weakness. Draco wanted to tell Harry that his nightmares weren't real and that they would pass over time. The Dark Lord is no more to get either of them but Draco was so lost in battling his own demons that he couldn't manage to soothe Harry's despair. He was partly ashamed and blamed himself for Harry's condition as he too played a major role on the wrong side of the war. He was the imperfection who broke everyone's lives, including Harry's. The big bad man wasn't entirely at fault or wasn't the pinnacle of blame because he was crowned the bad guy, the ultimate villain by the strength of the people that followed him and worshipped the ground he walked on. In this case, Voldemort was only the Dark Lord because his magic consumed and enjoyed the fear yet abundant respect he received from his followers, people like Draco, no matter their choice.
A half-hour passed agonizingly to the trio before the Healer finally stepped out, with a clipboard in his hands, of the ward he’d taken Draco into. Immediately, Harry pounced on him only to be held back by Ron’s strong grip on his bicep, silently demanding control from his best friend.
“I couldn’t see you destroying yourself because of me and I knew what triggered your panic attack earlier at St Mungo’s,” Harry said, placing his hand on Draco’s but Draco pulled away.
in the first place! If I didn’t let the Dark Lord Mark me, my family would’ve been cursed to death. You didn’t know how the Dark Lord was! Death in his hands was never instant. He made sure you were cursed to the periphery of insanity and then made you beg for your death. I had to bear his Mark!” Anger coupled with fear dominated his mind and body and Draco shivered.
There was literally NOTHING fresh about Fresh Market and Draco simply couldn’t understand why Potter ordered groceries from such a ghastly shop. When he heard its name, Draco thought there would be thousands of fruits, vegetables, kinds of seafood, poultry places in hundreds of stalls and people would be flocking everywhere. Yet, Fresh Market was just a small shop that took up rather large floor space. There were no stalls but fruits and vegetables were put in big baskets on one corner of the first floor. In another corner, there was a glass partition that opened into a smelly room, where all kinds of aquatic animals – common and exotic were placed on crushed ice. That room had been chillier than the rest of the shop. There was another partition too in which bottles of whiskey, wine, rum, gin, and tonic took up the shelves in an aesthetic sequence. There were many shelves from one corner of the floor to the other, on which several packed, tinned, and processed foods were placed. There were four to five refrigerators that had frozen items – frozen chicken, fish, peas, corn, tofu, and many more.
Yet, they followed him every single night. He screamed in unison with the Hermione in his dreams. He felt all the cuts rip him open and scar him just like it had happened to his friends. He could feel Death holding his soul not so gently and plucking it out of his body and he would open his eyes to a peaceful night, a silent scream gurgling in his throat, begging for all of it to stop. Then, he would sob into his pillow as images of all the dead people he held dear - Sirius, Remus, Fred, Tonks, and many more - flashed in front of his eyes like a movie.
And he left the scene but not before he heard the stranger eagerly say, “Your husband’s actually cool about us, Harry”, followed by Harry’s curt “Shut up.”
“Wait,” Draco squeaked and Ron thought he would pass out because of the extreme sighing he’d been doing all day. Harry and Draco were going to be the death of him; he was positive. Silently, he prayed to Merlin, Morgana, or whoever listening to him to provide him the strength to knock sense into the two bubbleheads he was currently stuck with.
Even now Harry couldn't understand why Draco would be unwilling to create a family with him. If he'd asked Draco to carry his child for them, he wouldn't have. He was pretty sure of it. Biologically, it wasn't a man's responsibility to carry and care for life. Yet, he wanted to have that happiness together with his husband - the joy Ron had. Harry wanted to watch Draco grow fat to accommodate the growth of their child. He wanted to carry a pregnant Draco in his arms no matter how much it hurt and show the world how beautiful they'd be. How happy they'd be. And how wrong people had been in assuming that Harry sharing his life with Draco was a terrible idea. It might've been selfish of him and he was certain that Draco would throw a raging fit once he was educated about his condition. Never once did Harry imagine that Draco would be capable of murdering an unborn child. He didn't count Draco to be such a barbarian. Yet now, considering Draco's actions, he's being forced to think otherwise.
"My parents' death anniversary is nearing and I am left alone every year to struggle with it. Maybe it's an after-effect or something from Voldemort's curse on me but my nightmares get worse. More clear. More horrific. More deathly," Harry said in a low tone, just audible enough for both of them. Draco's smile waned with every word leaving Harry's lips until his entire mind seemed to focus and visualize what it must be like in Harry's nightmares.
"So bite me, Potter, and mark me yours. Please," Draco begged, his hands fisting the pillow under his head tightly to cant his hips upwards properly and match Harry's unforgiving tempo. Harry was more than happy to give his husband a bright red love bite at the juncture where his neck and his shoulder met. Oh, it would be visible to the entire world and Harry gloated in pride at that knowledge.
“I am concerned, as I should be and I expected I would be. Your list of self animosity apparently is longer than what you love about yourself,” she noted.
Hermione's voice nudged his mind and for a fraction of a second, he wanted to throw his wand away and ask Draco what she meant. Was it only Smoking or was there something else he didn't know?
Hermione had the sense to inform Harry before rushing to Draco’s aid and helping him heave out all the food that he ate not long ago.
It’s been so damn long since Draco had sexual contact with himself, let alone others. Seven years in Azkaban didn’t give him a chance to think about sex, or relieving himself. It was all about surviving another day until the next came. Now, as Harry was touching him with that sensual look in his eyes, so soft and alluring, Draco’s sexual drive was back with full force but it left him confused. He was doubtful that if his consent in this was purely natural or forced upon externally. Draco was certain that his hatred for Harry Potter completely vanished and was now turning into something beautiful. Yet, he couldn't bring himself to accept the tingling sensation in his heart whenever Harry was near. And, somewhere in between, Harry guessed what Draco was thinking and pulled away. Tonight was not the night anymore.
"Oh my God! Ron, help me here!" Hermione's shrill voice filled the room and seconds later, Ron and Hermione were pulling Harry away from a nearly passed out Draco. Harry was possibly satisfied with the work he did on his passive husband because he didn't protest when Ronald pulled him away and into the living room.
in your face?” Draco’s voice rose gradually as he shoved his Dark Mark into Harry’s line of vision at the end of his tirade.
“You can’t subdue Harry if he… you know, gets violent. Besides, I’ll die worrying about you, love. Let me handle this,” he pacified her until she acquiesced, albeit reluctantly.
Harry wasn’t sure that he could do it. It’s been so long since he held a broom and the broomsticks he owned lay under layers of dust in his garage. He remembered the day when Draco had asked him if they could fly but he turned him down by saying that they couldn’t as Draco had no magic in him to fly one. Instead of him admitting that he hadn’t the courage to fly again after all those years of dormancy, he swerved his reasons towards Draco.
"We face that all the time, Mr. Weasley. When he calms down, talk him into attending the counseling sessions, please. I can sense that Harry Potter has anger issues which haven't been dealt with after the war. It was hard on all of us but we weren't the ones who faced the Dark Lord. Harry did. And, I strongly believe that his mind is very much unstable at the moment, despite his semblance. If left alone, he could be lost to all those who care for him," he patted Ron's shoulder and inclined his head respectfully towards Hermione before leaving them alone to mull over what he said.
"Ah, correction. You WERE the Malfoy heir. Before Lucius died, I purchased everything. Even the poorest of your estates, your elves, your estates spread in France and America, are now mine," Harry explained.
“Potter, you do that again!” Draco begged, his eyes tearing with the intensity of the moment when Harry's fingers hit something inside him that made him shudder in extreme pleasure. Harry gladly obliged as his fingers caught that pleasure spot again and again and his chest tightened with happiness whenever Draco's face contorted in fulfillment of his need.
“I won’t be beating around the bush but I think you need to stay away from Harry,” Ron said and when Draco was about to protest him indignantly, Ron raised a hand, gesturing him to stop talking and hear him out first. Draco snapped his mouth shut so as to not spill all the profanities he cooked up for Ronald in a mere span of seconds. “We failed as his friends miserably. When he needed us after the war, we weren’t there for him as we were trying to fix ourselves. We left him alone. The Harry you see right now is not the Harry I once used to know. I will be thoroughly ashamed later for saying this to you but this Harry is dangerous. He’s okay when he’s in a good mood but I can’t say the same for when he’s, you know, out of sorts. And if you stay together, I’m afraid the outcomes in my mind are too bloody. I can see that you’re trying to hold on,” Ron said eyeing the two rings on Draco’s finger and instinctively, Draco hid his left hand from Ron’s sight, “but for how long?”
“Your face is hilarious, Draco,” Harry chuckled as he shrugged out of his Auror robes and placed it on the coat stand before plopping down onto the sofa beside Draco.
His part in the Wizarding War was huge. Had he not found a way to infiltrate the Hogwarts castle, one which he felt like home, there would not have been those many deaths. Every single person that fell, they did so on his heart and Draco promised to carry their weight to his grave. He wished for death to befall him so that he’d be free of his crimes yet life was not so forgiving. He loathed himself for choosing Harry the moment he walked into his cell, yet, Draco believed that only Harry could set him free from his contrition. In the beginning, he tried to get away from the sheer unadulterated bursts of anger Harry directed at him randomly solely because he couldn’t believe the great Harry Potter had in him the will to hurt anyone. Then he had to make himself remember that the man he saw was a boy when he killed the Dark Lord; a boy who let his wrongful peers and above rightfully serve their time in Azkaban. Once he established it in his mind, Draco invited the pain. Every punch Harry landed on him was liberating in a way others would call twisted. Every drop of blood he shed sang choruses of praise which had connotations of pleading for forgiveness for the bloodshed of many men and women he voluntarily caused.
This new feeling of emptiness was liberating to him. A year after walking out, Ginny came back but by then Harry was so far off the reservation that they couldn’t stay in each other’s presence for more than a few minutes. Harry’s silence and dispassion for basically everything built a permanent wall between them and long before Harry realized, he was once again left alone in his flat which was devoid of all the things Ginny once owned. They never spoke of it and remained on good terms since.
his mind wouldn’t stop repeating that sentence nor would it stop throwing images of Draco, beaten and bloody, to his eyes.
"Say ah!" Harry sang and his mind still whirling, Draco complied and savored the burst of the soft juicy chocolate pastry. It took him a while to break out of his stupor and find two entirely befuddled faces of Ron, whose face was flaming red, and Hermione, whose face was equally red too. "Belated happy birthday, Draco darling," Harry wished before kissing him on the cheek lightly, so reminiscent of Draco's Mother who did the same for him. Only gagging sounds from Ronald brought Draco back to reality and when he realized why the ginger head blew a fuse, he smirked at him before planting a loud wet kiss on Harry's cheek and wishing him a Happy birthday once again.
"Quick, Potter," Draco urged, lifting up his legs by resting his feet on the bed and letting them fall open loosely for Harry to watch his desire in all its wet glory.
Harry's cheeks hurt with the intensity of his smile. Shaking his head in amusement, Harry kissed Draco wetly on the cheek, causing the blonde to gape in embarrassment.
“Yes, Mr. Potter. We are currently trying to dampen the connection Draco’s core has to your magic, as your husband, and to the baby’s magic as its Father. Good news is that we’ve stabilized him but the bad news is, we don’t know when his core will break free and start eating away at your baby’s magic because the protective shell created by your magic is almost gone due to his late admittance here. We will do our best in retrieving both of them,” Yeager said with a hint of sorrow in his voice.
In retrospect, he realized that Harry hadn’t used a condom or a protection spell the night before and he wondered if their nightly sessions were all planned out for this very moment. He felt used. And, emotionally battered beyond repair. All that happiness he built inside him till this incident crashed like brittle glass and those broken edges bled him inside out.
“No, Draco. Even the muggle kids drink it, you know? It does not have alcohol,” Harry clarified but Draco had been inexorable. He believed that the manufacturers only fooled their consumers by leading them to think that Coke was a non-alcoholic drink.
“No,” Draco’s voice sounded small and feeble to Ron, so contrasting to his burst of rage a few moments ago, and he couldn’t help but overcome with sympathy for the scared and emotionally scarred man sitting across him.
“She’ll be up soon so you can come with me now. After she wakes up, we’ll be registering my baby girl’s name and other details. We chose to name her Rose, by the way. You know you’re her Godfather, right, Harry?”
"Yes, Draco. A bit of Dittany to close your wounds and a vial of Skele-Gro for your broken nose," she placed a hand on Draco's nape and helped him sit up before giving him Skele-Gro. "Drink." And he drank it in one go, shuddering at the nauseating after-burn.
There he went again blaming Draco for something he had no control over. He just frigging needed a damn drink to calm his nerves! Just a blink – and Harry found Draco in his face, fisting his collar with both hands and pushing him back into the hard wall, the intensity of which was so harsh that Harry hit his head and groaned; his glasses askew and their noses almost touching. Harry could smell the nicotine and caffeine on Draco’s lips; he could practically taste it floating on his tongue.
Hours later, that was how Harry Potter found Draco upon his return. Still bound but fast asleep where he last left the man after their rather dirty fight with dried and crusty tear tracks on his pale face.
Draco got a Remembrall from Ronald as a joke, shoes that changed color according to the dress you wore from George, and a protective charm bracelet from Hermione. Ginny and Thomas gifted the couple a flower vase that always kept the flowers fresh and alive until you took them out. Harry received a musical box from Hermione that would calm him down with its therapeutic music, according to her. Without an ounce of shame, George gave him a carton of various flavored and tingling condoms, complete with a set of flavored and tingling lubes and said, "Give me a detailed review, Harry," and winked at them. Draco never thought he'd be anymore redder than he was then. Neither did Harry. Though he was quite successful in maintaining his composure, Draco couldn't say the same for Harry as he watched the man mince his words in embarrassment.
It was precisely at that moment, Draco's heart throbbed in something that wasn't pain, something that was clearly happiness and fondness as he watched Harry smile widely before saying, "Thank you, guys!" in a nasal tone. For the first time, he wanted Harry to look at him with the same intensity of affection and love he directed towards his friends and Draco reluctantly realized that he was extremely jealous of Ronald and his wife for making Harry smile like that when he couldn't. It hit him hard as he didn't want to accept his heart pounding for one Harry Potter. So, he decided to ignore the thudding inside his chest and not dwell on it anymore but to his dismay, his eyes already looked at Harry differently. They were irrevocably focused on every inch of Harry's face and his shirtless expanse of chest and slightly swelled stomach that was so unlike an Auror.
Alone yet again, Draco’s body finally realized that it was still haunted by the flu and collapsed on the sofa weakly. For the first time in a very long while, Draco slept dreamlessly.
Draco ignored Ronald and glanced at Harry. He didn't want to wake him up but didn't want to spoil Harry's day by not celebrating his birthday. Draco had celebrated his own birthday alone and Harry didn't even know. Nobody knew except him and he stood by the floor to ceiling window, staring down at the fields and up at the sky, replaying his past birthdays when his Mother would bake him a huge Belgian chocolate cake herself and his Father would give him his blessings and an expensive gift. That night, he wanted to tell Harry that it was his birthday as they ate dinner together but held himself back as it was useless anyway, according to him. Hence they had eaten in silence until they retired to their own rooms for the night.
Draco couldn’t grasp what was happening. Harry was admitting that he made mistakes. He was even acknowledging the Dark Mark tainting his skin like a blot of ink on a white sheet. He was whispering promises of their future and how better it could be. But, why? What was his purpose? After everything, could they even look at each other in the eye and not remember the filth that is their past? How could their future bloom when the seeds they sowed were already dead?
“I always wondered if anyone had a taste of this flesh during your days with Voldemort and other Death Eaters,” Harry spoke, his now free hands squeezing Draco’s arse cheeks, causing the blonde to squeal in shock.
"Kiss me?" he asked Draco and the man found Harry's lips almost instantly. This time around, it was Draco's split lip from the previous day's beating that broke once again and bled into their kiss. Harry groaned when he tasted Draco's blood in his mouth and slurped at the broken lip for more. The experience was riveting by all means. As he pictured Draco's blood entering his mouth and mixing with his own later, he couldn't help but lust for more of that coppery taste sloshing around on his tongue and Harry began sucking on Draco's broken lip in earnest and pure satisfaction.
"Ronald Weasley! Don't be a vermin. Sit and eat like a human," Hermione scolded her husband and Ronald deflated like a pinched balloon.
“Save it and get out,” Draco’s tone of disinterest mixed with unbridled anger didn’t falter in the least.
A few minutes later, both of them grunted their release into each other’s mouths, their tongues still dancing together in post haze.
“I don’t know. I’m so used to being around him that I can’t imagine my life without him. He CURES me, ‘Mione. I feel so stable around him. Is it supposed to be love?” Harry asked like a child.
And, in real life, Draco woke up to the Sun glinting harshly in his eyes, which for a moment, he mistook to be the knife dream Harry held in his hands.
Harry and Draco TALK, actually, in the next chapter and is a continuation from where we leave off here.
Harry’s palm traced Draco’s right side slowly, starting from his hip to his underarm as if he was trying to find something hidden. When Draco squirmed, Harry grinned and repeated the motion on the other side, causing the blonde to squirm harder.
“Beautiful, isn’t it? I purchased this house for the view I get from this window and from my bedroom,” Harry said, resting his chin on Draco’s right shoulder. “Our bedroom now,” he corrected.
“And, there goes the last dose,” he said to himself, pocketing the empty vial just as Draco trotted in with The Prophet in his hands.
“We’ll go home together, won’t we? Until then, I suggest you keep your crooked nose out of my business!” Without waiting for a reply, Draco let Harry go with a push and resumed his angry march towards where Ron was stationed, looking at both of them with a concerned look on his face. Once Draco caught up to Ron, Harry saw Ron asking the blonde if he was fine and with a curt nod, Draco vanished into the room and away from Harry’s perplexed gaze. There’d be no forgiveness from either of them once they get home. Ron and Hermione wouldn’t be with him to assist him with his sudden spurts of uncontrollable anger. It seemed as if Draco was asking for it; for pain but Harry was determined to not let go of sanity. He’d practice the breathing exercise Mrs. Reynolds taught him and would not let his anger get the best of him at any cost. His sessions with his Mind Healer had taught him control over his emotions and enabled him to channelize them in a right way. Though he wasn’t completely healed, Harry was sure that no taunt of Draco’s tonight would compel his somewhat tamed anger to let loose.
"They'll be fine, Harry," Hermione said but she didn't believe her own words. There was a high chance of miscarriage but she prayed for the baby and Draco to be alright. She didn't agree with Harry's methods but if Draco's carelessness murdered the child, she didn't have the heart in her to forgive him. Maybe, he didn’t know that newly conceived babies could die of alcohol ingestion. But Draco was ready to abort the child. Hermione saw it in the man’s eyes yesterday; his need to get rid of the baby. She glanced at her husband and Ron simply nodded at her.
All the pieces of the puzzle suddenly fit together and Draco looked at Harry with eyes filled to the brim with betrayal.
“Now, I won’t ask again. Say it,” Harry’s knuckles were tainted with Draco’s blood from a split lip.
“I promise you, Draco, I will try harder,” Harry repeated and pulled his husband into a hug, which Draco didn’t resist.
They were happy, weren’t they? Or was it all merely an illusion? Cooking for Harry, eating together, movie nights with him when he excitedly but unknowingly spilt popcorn and beer all over the sofa and the floor, and Merlin, the sex after - which always was incredibly suffocating and pleasurable and most of all, intimately painful… Draco couldn’t understand what it was he felt towards Harry after all. Then again, he supposed, he was trying to justify his feelings for the man by carefully picking out the good times they spent together.
It was exactly at that moment Draco’s eyes met Harry’s and it was like a cold shower doused the flames of hope in his heart to nothing but cinders. Harry realized rather painfully that he had become someone he despised utterly to the very core of his soul and it shattered his sensibilities.
“What do you need?” Draco managed to ask though all he wanted right then was to escape Harry’s hold. Draco's voice broke the wall Hermione's voice built inside his head and he chose to go with the flow he and Draco established. Harry desperately wanted Draco. By the looks of it, Draco wanted him too. Any conversation could be resumed after they had their fill of each other.
"Please don't," Draco croaked out. He wanted to curl into himself and cry but he couldn't. He was so goddamn terrified that his body stopped functioning. Tears wouldn't even come.
"Happy birthday, Harry!" those two voices were too loud for Draco to ignore but Harry slept like a log, his head resting on Draco's chest.
It was harder than he thought it would be. The Floo was open and Ginny was waiting on the other side for him. Would this trouble be worth it for either of them? Draco had nothing to prove. He could just back out and lock himself in his room, throw a Silencing spell over the door and block out the world.
“Harry… Harry!” Draco all but shouted and not a second later his eyes were almost popping out of his sockets as Harry sheathed himself inside Draco in one majestic and unforgiving stroke. Draco hooked his legs around Harry’s waist as his husband didn’t wait even for a second for him to adjust to the immense pain blanketing the pleasure he should've had felt.
Draco sighed and took the bouquet from Harry’s hands. The flowers smelled heavenly and it relaxed him to an extent.
"They're a couple now and I need input for my products so that I can sell them for profit. Two birds with one stone. Right, Harry, Draco?" he winked at them again.
"God, I'm sorry! Let's talk it out, Draco. Please wake up?" he implored like a pitiful child, all the while rubbing Draco's face clean with the hem of his robes.
Draco hadn't protested Harry's departure. Of course, he felt a bit bitter for driving out the man from his own room but a large part of him didn't want to be anywhere near the man who tried to assault him sexually. He couldn't sleep peacefully with Harry beside him; not after what had happened. That night, his dreams were filled with Harry chasing him with every intention of killing him and Draco woke up every five minutes trying to write off that image from his mind. In his dreams, on the nights after, Harry kept on chasing him with a knife in his hand but not his wand. If the dream Harry had a wand, he could've hit Draco with a Killing curse from any distance.
Immediately, Harry pulled out a vial from his pocket and emptied the transparent liquid into Draco’s Espresso.
“What happened?” he asked though he remembered every bit of his breakdown. He graciously accepted the glass of water Harry gave and gulped it down immediately. His throat was beyond parched and he wished for another glass of water.
Not just a couple of weeks ago, he had been ready to smite one Draco Malfoy for hurting his best friend but upon finding the same guy compliantly taking a beating from an enraged Harry Potter, there was no way his heart didn’t change. The slightest bit felt huge. It was brutal. And, Draco was just lying down with his eyes closed, letting Harry beat him into oblivion. In the depths of his heart, he desperately wanted to believe that Harry wasn’t a bad person even though his actions screamed otherwise yet as a human, he could no longer ignore the simple fact that his best friend was long gone and the soul inhabiting Harry’s body was beyond corrupted because of the war and years of neglect. And that soul needed a target to vent out its frustrations. It took pride and pleasure in pinning Draco, once a Death Eater, to the ground and punching him till he was on the brink of death. Such a soul needed help. It craved love. And a whole lot of restraint.
When Draco didn't get any response from his husband, he laughed mirthlessly and despite everything that happened between them, in the heat of the moment, before he slipped into unconsciousness, concluded that Harry was a way better drug than nicotine and he could get addicted to this one instead, if only he stayed after. Maybe, there was a one hundred percent chance that he'd regret ever thinking so, but at the moment, he didn't care for he was lonely and needed Harry in all his glory to satiate his heart and magic.
Shameful it was when, in an attempt to balance both of them, Harry had fallen face first onto the ground and Hermione followed suit, landing on his back heavily. Something in his spine surely cracked, he surmised, gritting his teeth and closing his eyes in pain. At least, Hermione’s fall was cushioned. Alarmed by their rather peculiar and snappy arrival, two male nurses ran towards them to help them.
“We thought you were getting better! What the hell were you thinking, Harry?” he heard Hermione’s shrill voice as soon as he opened the door.
“Evidently, I did not. Isn’t that why you belabored me to the point of death? If your friends hadn’t intervened, I’d be stewing in Hell for my crimes, isn’t that right?”
"I don't need a counseling session. Certainly, not that prick who apparently murdered my child in cold blood,” Harry spoke calmly. The air around them shifted dangerously and somewhere, a glass broke. His magic was going haywire despite his calm appearance.
"No, I'm not. Did you know that I almost pissed my pants when I faced Voldemort before killing him? I'm not strong. I never was," Draco could feel Harry's tears wetting his nape and the shirt around his shoulders.
And Draco did let go as Harry asked and fell back against his husband’s chest. Harry put an arm around the blonde’s waist before renewing his slow-paced thrusts, eliciting moans of pleasure and tears of pain yet again, after many goddamn months, from Draco’s neat mouth. Suddenly reminded of Draco’s mouth, Harry wanted to claim all those sounds for himself and he captured the man’s lips in a punishing grip, licking and biting them alternatively till the lower one could no longer take it anymore and split and bled red for Harry to consume.
Not until an hour later as he sipped on firewhiskey at the Leaky Cauldron did Harry realize that Draco didn’t put up a fight like usual.
She turned to leave and I relaxed that I wouldn't snap and I could go in and drown myself in our memories.
Harry took up Draco's suggestion and their clothes vanished with a wave of his wand. The sudden contact of their skins left them quivering. Harry's arse rested on Draco's thighs, their erections pressed together. The morning light was bright enough for them to take in all the skin and scars their bodies carried.  Draco traced a pale white gash that was right above Harry’s right nipple before licking it and kissing it. Shuddering, Harry arched his back so as to allow his husband a free reign over his chest. When Draco took his nipple into his mouth and bit it rather harshly, Harry's eyes watered and his head pounded so hard with lust that it took him all he got to stop himself from ejaculating right then and there. It would've been worth the pain but would also have been utterly pathetic. Pulling on Draco's hair so that his nipple would be free, Harry got up and pulled Draco down using his calves and the blond fell on his back on the bed. Harry then lay down atop Draco pressing their fronts together, inch by inch. The feeling of pleasure was physically excruciating as they groaned together in ecstasy, rutting against each other.
Ron calmed himself down as soon his friend woke up, not wanting to spoil the day for him by picking a fight with his unexpected husband. He clearly remembered having a mini heart attack when he read the big bold letters printed on the first page of the Daily Prophet - "The Boy Who Lived ties the knot with a Death Eater!" A huge moving picture of Harry and Malfoy, holding hands and walking away towards the nearest apparition point was printed under it. Ronald had to refrain himself from confronting Harry as Hermione told him it wasn't their place to decide who Harry chose for himself in his life. They had to accept Harry's decisions and not question them. If Harry wanted to give an explanation, he would and they had to wait until then. His wife was the only one holding him back from drowning Harry in his sea of questions and doubts. Plastering a genuine smile on his face, Ron nodded at Harry before the pair wished him - "Harry birthday, Harry!" joyously.
"I missed it, didn't I?" Harry asked mournfully. "It doesn't matter," Ron said but neither Harry nor Draco focused on his voice but each other's faces. Hermione watched the exchange with a thoughtful face before throwing a warning look at her husband, quieting him down for the umpteenth time.
If he'd chanced a glance at Potter, he would've seen Harry's eyes glued to Hermione's stomach rather darkly. Harry always wanted a child in his life. Now that he's married Draco, he didn't know if he could ever get one. He wasn't even sure if Draco would agree to raise a child with him and he supposed that he'd have to do it alone. Still, he thought, it would be nice to become a family with Draco and their child.
"I'm sorry, really, but you have no choice in this, Draco. You will only be granted release if you're not a Malfoy," Harry said ruefully and with such sincerity that Draco momentarily suffered from emotional whiplash.
“Damn it! Slow down, Harry,” tears of pain gushed out of Draco’s eyes and Harry lapped at them like a thirsty man.
"You look like shit," she observed as she handed him the mug and he took it gratefully though he wouldn't be admitting it ever.
Draco regarded his husband, trying to blink away the torpor that consumed him until a minute ago. It’d been so long since he slept so peacefully and both his body and mind craved for more.
“As much as I want to add to your words, I must say that I wouldn’t be willing to go out even if Harry had asked,” Draco countered, supporting his absent husband in a way, even though his statement was only partly true. They had gone out. Twice or thrice, Draco couldn’t exactly remember the number. How could he forget the day they went Christmas shopping? All eyes filled with downright contempt and their intent to kill followed Draco whenever he stood by Harry. He dared not stray away from his husband’s side that day for the fear of getting killed lived in his entire being. It had been a good day out though, save for the public’s black eye upon him. Every day, as he watched his owl, Sebastian, flap his broad wings and soar into the skies peacefully, Draco wondered how exquisite it would be to be able to live so free.
Harry never addressed what it is that he felt towards Draco. Was it just lust? If it was, he wouldn’t feel like dying at the loss of Draco. It must be affection. It must be the reason why he supposed living with the man till his death wouldn’t be suffocating.
But Ginny wasn’t fazed by it. No one would be raining on their parade and she would make sure Draco enjoyed their friendly date.
“Figures. I was upset, Harry. I needed a drink. I was burdened with so much that for once, I wanted to feel nothing anymore. I NEVER intended for the child to go like this. Believe me,” Draco elaborated.
“You won’t be walking away from what you were, Draco. You can’t. These people will never let you forget your identity but you must prove to them that you won’t let your past weigh you down; that you’re willing and striving to be a better person. So, let’s go upstairs, visit Hermione and her baby, then and only then we’ll be going back home. Together,” Harry stressed on the last word.
Harry scoffed. He bent close to his husband, his hands gripping tightly the cold white railing of the hospital bed, their faces not more than five inches apart before hardening his face into one filled with such rage that Voldemort would be dying in his grave once again if Harry laid his eyes on him. And, Draco knew what was coming.
Along with Ginny, he even purchased a few items for himself from Madam Malkin’s. It had been a really awkward experience as he clearly remembered the day when he and his mother walked out of the place after insulting the shop and its owner. He was too young and despondent with the then-ongoing events in his life to contradict anything his mother had said. Then again, he would not have countered even if he was in his sane and serene mind for the love he harbored for his mother was far greater than anything else in this world. Thankfully, Madam Malkin had not explicitly said a thing to him when he entered her shop after approximately ten years. Her scornful yet passive face told him that she had not forgotten what happened but she wouldn’t confront him as that was what she hated the most. They dawdled around each other and getting his new robes sized to perfection was the most excruciating experience for the both of them. Later, he purchased lots of yummy treats and a new cage for Sebastian which had a swing and a wooden perch, unlike his previous cage which only had the latter. They also visited Quality Quidditch Supplies as Ginny required a new set of Quidditch gloves and a Broomstick Servicing Kit.
All in all, Draco supposed as they bid goodbye to all and left for their home, the day went rather well. The Weasleys were tolerable. Even the foolish Ronald grew on him and he loathed himself partially for admitting the fact. That night, when they returned to their home, a white owl was waiting for them, with a paper in its beak, on the tea table in their living room and Draco looked at Harry dubiously.
Draco cleared his throat and glanced briefly at Harry, whose face contorted into a pained grimace. Guilt.
Draco's hand was sweaty when he placed it in Potter's outstretched hand and sat down on the sofa beside him. It was like only they existed in the world and nobody could enter their bubble as they cut the cake together, occasionally finding each other's eyes and Harry never stopped smiling. Draco wished for time to stop so that he could have more of Harry's smile before having his favorite cake.
“I don’t think it necessary to hit Draco. I just can’t help it, that’s all! I see him laughing and something in me snaps. Who gave him the right to smile like that when the people he killed could smile no more? Who gave him the right to live when he should be dead?!” his voice rose extremely high and Arya was pretty sure that the Weasleys heard every bit of what Harry uttered.
“Don’t worry, I never order frozen foods. No frozen chicken,” he threw in a large bottle of peanut butter and mixed fruit jam.
“I’m scared,” he heard Harry’s muffled voice as the man awkwardly half-climbed into Draco’s lap like a child for comfort.
Fortunately, he was saved answering with the arrival of the person of the day, Rose Granger-Weasley. One look at the miniature human bundled up in a fluffy white blanket just wasn’t enough to describe how monumental her presence seemed in the room. Even from the distance, Draco could see wisps of ginger hair strewn about on the baby’s head and without meaning to, he smiled. Rose kept cooing and sputtering saliva onto her chin in her attempt to smile at every person present in the room. When the Healer (Eastoft, Draco presumed) handed Rose to Granger, Harry shifted away so that Ronald could take his place beside his wife. Ronald held out his index for the baby and she curled her itsy-bitsy fingers around it and brought the finger down to her mouth. The room filled with wholesome laughter and Draco would swear anytime in the future that Ronald Weasley was the biggest baby as he sat there crying profusely while his little baby slurped happily on his finger.
Irisk - You're not the only one. Even I wanted a Dark!Harry fanfic with a happy ending no matter how absurd it would be. Still, I would love me some happy ending.
Draco found himself tumbling into a rather clean alley that had dust piled up neatly to one corner in a large rectangular green bin with a lid. Harry caught him before he could fall face-first into the ground.
"Sneer all you want, Malfoy. But decide. You haven't got long. I'd say forty seconds more before I leave for good," Harry's voice was stern and stoic.
“The scars I gave,” Harry muttered with dark lustful eyes as they roamed over Draco’s chest. Harry’s non-existent nails bit into the slightly raised skin there, a sensitive touch which caused Draco to arch off the bed. Feeling conscious of his misgivings, Draco’s hands tried to cover the scars on his chest but Harry swatted them away gently.
“Just checking on you. Is everything all right, mate?” he asked, glancing furtively at Draco, who was looking out the window, completely ignoring their existence in the room.
His statement was followed by silence. Draco only concentrated on smoking and conveniently forgot about Harry until the said man in question moved into his line of vision and sat down on his lap, facing him, his knees on either side of Draco’s hips. Harry’s eyes swelled with tears up to the brim and a tentative hand reached out and captured Draco’s half done bud between the index and thumb fingers. Unwillingly, Draco parted his lips and allowed Harry to take the bud out of his mouth.
Their fourth session was longer than their prescribed time yet Arya didn’t stop Harry. She must’ve spoken no more than five or six sentences for the entirety of two hours. Harry spoke about only death and how it affected him. His parents, Dumbledore, Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, though still edging away from the territory that marked the war and finally, Sirius Black. He spoke through tears about the life he’d imagined with his Godfather and the life he was denied cruelly. The elders had been cruel to him for he never had a childhood – one which Sirius desperately wanted to provide but couldn’t because of his untimely demise.
“Agh!” he cried when the back of his right palm stung. Slowly, brightness filled his vision until the blurred face in front of him grew clearer. Ginny’s worried face drifted in front of him and he looked around. They seemed to be in an empty alley. He looked down at his right hand which was being squished in Ginny’s hand and realized that she used a stinging hex on him to bring him back to reality from wherever he went.
"Are to trying to kill me, Harry? Is that what you’ve become now? A frigging murderer?!" he couldn't remain calm even though he wanted to as his hammered husband was back at the kitchen entryway, blocking it partially with his bulk.
He didn't hear the rustle of sheets, later clothes, and the thud of boots behind him but felt Harry's body stick to his back rather tightly and hands encircling his waist.
"This is your past. You can never erase it. But, your past DOES NOT define who you are now," she insisted in her now nasally tone.
That got Malfoy to open his eyes and stare hard into Potter's green eyes alight with nothing but dark intentions. Anything, anything at all, was better than dying but Draco couldn't fathom whether he could live with marrying Potter just to escape death. And not to mention his absolute loathing for the man. What would his Father say about this union? Imagine the horror of tainting his bloodline with Potter's filthy half-blood lineage!
“You don’t mean that,” Draco hated the way his voice shook. Harry meant what he said. Draco could see it in the man's unforgiving green eyes.
Draco was sitting at his dining chair, having his dinner. There was no use in waiting for Harry because the man never seemed to come home after Draco's miscarriage. They never really addressed the issue and Draco very well knew that a discussion was long overdue.
“I’m learning to live with my failures, Draco,” Harry spoke when he couldn’t take Draco’s silence anymore. He needed to make Draco understand that both of them needed help if they wanted things to work between them. Harry just hoped that the burning in the back of his mind was anything but the temper he knew was oncoming because of Draco’s stubbornness. “Just because I defeated the Dark Lord doesn’t make me the perfect man to walk this Earth. In fact, I’ve only gotten worse. I hurt people who love and care for me. I hurt you,” he lifted his head and a few droplets of water rolled down from his wet, now tamed hair. “I hurt you, didn’t I?” he asked.
Madcheshirefox, Irisk, kikukaku, canadianliverfailure - Ron has always been the least understanding one, especially in the case of Death Eaters and the like. But, yes, you have to wait for a while for everything to get better. Thanks!
Harry’s voice in his head was overbearing. He just wanted it gone. Unknowingly, he clapped his hands over his ears in an effort to keep Harry’s voice away from him but it was futile, he realized, as the voice was inside his head, consuming him in entirety.
Pulling out his wand with a slight bit of difficulty, given the situation, he conjured his Patronus and sent it off to Ron with a message demanding him to bring his arse to St Mungo’s.
“Yes,” she replied after a pause. “I’ll protect you if anything happens, I promise,” she expressed truthfully.
Harry whispered a Lumos spell and Draco saw that his husband – wait, should he even call him that anymore? – was frowning at him rather hard.
But when their orders were brought in by Ginny after a while, he made sure to eat not only his cone but also Ginny’s super delicious sundae. He could not believe that he had never tasted it during his Schooling. He blamed his parents for that, rest their soul in peace, who always took him to large and posh establishments when all that tasted heavenly was right here in Diagon Alley.
“Talk,” Draco said, turning around to face Harry with arms folded across his chest, mirroring Harry’s posture, after stubbing the cig on the window sill, leaving behind black soot.
Harry was swaying on his feet, blinded by unadulterated anger towards Draco and the latter found no escape. Draco's fingers clenched his wand so tight that he feared he'd break the wood into two. To quote that he was afraid would just be an understatement as he could literally feel the flames of Harry's fury licking him in entirety.
“And I need you to say that my child is okay!" Harry screamed. The bulb overhead the group broke and instead of shards, pulverized glass rained over them. Vigilantly, Ronald spelled a protective cover over them as soon as he felt a surge in Harry’s magical power, and knowing his best friend, something was bound to break because of his shooting magic. Healer Yeager looked at Ron and Hermione to convey that he couldn't do anything else and that Harry needed to be put under control. Else, he'd be thrown off the property to maintain the safety of other patients.
"I want cuddles and kisses," Harry mumbled against Draco's neck and it took all the self-control in Draco for keeping his chuckles inside his throat.
“Is the drink green in color?” Draco asked, picking it up and bringing the bottle close to his frowning and curious eyes in an attempt to examine and find out which color the liquid inside was.
Draco scoffed. “You need me to spread my legs for you so that you can impregnate me with your seed and those potions behind my back,” Draco stated coolly.
“Some couples like to hit each other and it helps them find gratification sexually. Rough play. Dominance and Submission.”
"Calm down, please? It's not good for your baby," Harry rubbed soothing circles on her back and on her swollen belly. She nodded her head and took in deep breaths trying to avoid stressing her baby.
Two minutes later, Ron and Hermione rushed towards the source of the scream, abandoning their half-eaten breakfast in their plates and barged into Harry’s room. They found him kneeling on the floor, facing the wall, as he kept on punching it. Harry could feel a few of his fingers broken yet he didn’t stop hitting the wall. He deserved this pain for dealing it out to Draco. No matter how angry or cross he had been with Draco for killing the child he dreamt of and wanted, he should not have tried to kill him. He remembered telling his husband back at the hospital that he was no better than his father, Lucius but now, Harry feared that he turned into someone who he despised from the core of his heart. After yesterday’s incident, Harry wondered if he was any better than his counterpart, Voldemort.
, who wants to go shopping, of all things, with Harry’s current partner or obsession or whatever and a Malfoy at that! He wouldn’t giggle, ever but the situation did call for him to burst out laughing, a few droplets of coffee spilling from the corners of his mouth which he wiped away immediately with the back of his hand.
"You WILL stay down," Harry intoned once and for all. Draco shut his eyes and nodded his head a fraction to let Harry know that he would comply. He would lay down and take all of Harry's wrath until he was satisfied or until he killed Draco. Death now seemed so tranquil to Draco.
That day when I, the ever-immaculate person to ever walk this Earth, begged you for forgiveness for a mistake I never committed? Even now, as I think back on it, I cannot fathom why I pleaded with you to forgive me. I'd never done anything and as far as my past crimes were concerned, I am serving my term. You made sure of that, didn't you? Our world made sure of that. Hence the exile that I'm currently living in. I now live in a world without magic. I'm not a wizard anymore. I'm banned from entering our world forever. It has been five years since I stepped into the other side hidden from this muggle world. Don't you think this is punishment enough? Yet, somehow, it didn't seem so threatening or lonely at the time. You know why? Because I had you by my side to support my fall. Maybe, I relied on you a bit more than required and look at me now. Left alone sitting by embers in the loveseat we've bought together and caringly placed close to the hearth. Why did you have to leave? What must I do with all our memories scattered like permanent dust over every inch of this place and my body?
“I’m not the only one,” he repeated as he openly broke down in front of his Healer. And she let him. He cried till there were no tears left for him to shed. He’d been alone. No one had come to his rescue and he never asked anyone to help his deal with his grief. Looking at his loved ones, he believed he should be stronger so that they could lean on him for much needed support. When they did, he took comfort in soothing their pain but never once did he stop and think about the pain stabbing at his insides. It consumed him and filled him with Darkness. Never finding time to grieve, he boxed it up well and let the pain take over. And everything crashed.
Deciding he’d go home, he shuffled out of the room and turned left, towards where the staircase was. Leaning his left hand on the wall so as to support him, he started walking and was about to pass the first open ward when he heard familiar voices of mirth. A glance into the room told him that he was passing by Granger’s ward and it was Molly Weasley who was causing a happy ruckus, cooing gibberish to her granddaughter. He was facing her back and could clearly see Harry’s face above her short form. Even from the distance he was at, he could see Harry’s hands itching to hold the baby, impatiently bobbing on his heels when Molly seemed content to keep Rose all to herself. A while ago, exactly during the last Christmas, Draco had been more than willing to mould himself so that he could fit in alongside people, even if they were Weasleys. He had been aching for a place to belong and was ecstatic when he was given a chance. Yet now, as he stood outside while the others were inside, he wondered why he’d ever thought that he would have the tiniest of places in the family that despised his lineage more than anyone else in the Wizarding world. Well, it had been good while it lasted.
Irisk - Thank you for the story recommendations! I'm on my way to read them. And, yes, I will try my best to give them a happy ending but no promises as of now.
“I think I better go home,” Draco said, wanting to be left alone. 'Your home is Azkaban, Death Eater!' he distinctly heard another stranger, a man, scream but Draco couldn't point the man's head in the crowd. He didn’t want to be talked down by these people nor did he want to be saved by Harry. This is what his life had come down to. He couldn’t go anywhere of his own accord without Harry for protection. Though he’s out of Azkaban, he’s barely independent.
Thank you Madcheshirefox, Irisk, MadamePerverell, Kikukaku, canadianliverfailure for your precious reviews.
“It doesn’t change the way you or the others treat me,” Draco clarified and for once, Harry was left dumbfounded; his thumb feeling the textures of the scratches and burn marks left behind by their owner, until his eyes caught the two wedding rings and he smiled wistfully.
“This isn’t about you, Draco. It’s about US. We can be a family now; one which neither of us had. This is our chance at happiness,” Harry tried to reason positively by Draco only shook his head in disgust.
Five days later, Healer Yeager diagnosed Draco Potter to be perfectly sound in health but he couldn't say the same for the baby. Meanwhile, reporters loitered around the hospital, somehow getting wind of Draco and Harry’s predicament, waiting for the said men’s statement. All they knew was the old news of Draco being pregnant. And to this date, even after all these years, Harry couldn’t understand how the reporters succeeded in catching him in their nets.
Loneliness. It leaves you warped in the mind and forces you to like, almost love, something that you should actually hate from the depths of your heart. It pertains not only to humans but to every living thing which is burdened by living alone. It is a force that crumples your sensibilities and reforms them into faculties you don’t ever recognize. The process seems so natural that your mind builds scenarios for you so as to come to terms with why you’re feeling a certain way when you’re not supposed to. You try and reason with the list of whys and hows in your mind and somehow, they inevitably morph into your reality. There shall then come a time when you don’t recognize your past self and are left with a vague answer to the question – ‘Who the heck was I?’ All you can ever remember is the person you unmindfully turned yourself into and the rest is merely a blur.
“What is it?” Harry rushed in hurriedly. One look at his friend and he knew that her baby was coming.
Harry learned then that Draco liked to eat rice and added an extra bag to their basket. The time where he ordered for one turned into two and he could not explain the warm fuzzy feeling engulfing his heart like a tsunami. Draco scrutinized every shelf for things he might have wanted and whatever caught his interest went into their basket. When they came face to face with condoms, Draco had flushed a light rose color. In the Wizarding world, condoms were only available in the apothecary and they weren’t even that necessary as there were always protection spells. One could say, condoms were only a ‘kink’ for the wizards and not a necessity.
“Would you please stop blubbering like an idiot and get on with whatever you came here for?” Draco said tiredly.
Thank you for all the support, guys! Here's the promised update. God, it's been so long and churning out a fresh chapter just took away so much tension from my mind.
He sounded petty but after not seeing the world and people for a long time, Draco felt apprehensive. And, he couldn't tolerate a herd of Weasleys when he couldn't even deal with one Ronald Weasley alone.
"Let's take him to the private ward for a checkup, shall we?" Yeager suggested coolly and gestured his helpers to take over. They levitated Draco carefully and all of them reached a room at the far end of the corridor.
Before he lost his senses, Harry sent his Patronus to the Ministry to inform his superiors that he wouldn't be coming to work after all and since it was only desk work, he'd be doing it after the holidays.
When exhaustion fell over them eventually, they slept tangled together. Not even in their nightmares did they let go of each other.
"Not like this, Harry! You didn't ASK me for my consent. If you had, maybe, just maybe, I would've thought about it," Draco's body started to shake and he couldn't control the onslaught of tears anymore.
Eraramech - I'm really so sorry to disappoint you but this is a dark fic and not a fluffy one. If it's any consolation, it will get better as I mentioned in the tags.
“Potter,” Draco whimpered when he felt his husband’s tip position at his ready and inviting aperture.
“Um,” Harry frowned. Was that important? Did he necessarily need to like a part of himself? The Healer’s hard gaze on him only worsened his thinking abilities. “Everyone says my eyes look lovely,” Harry mumbled quite sarcastically.
“For that choice of mine, I deserved the place I got in Azkaban. I hated you for not saving us initially. After a few months, I realized that my hatred for you was pointless. You did save me once but I chose not to take your side. I ran back gleefully to what I was, what I had become in the midst of chaos. You had no obligation anymore to save me, Harry, and I made peace with the life I drove myself to. Until that day when my parents passed away and you came for me. I wondered why, after all, you hadn’t bothered to save us, to save
“I’m not here to hurt you, Draco. Please, stop struggling and let me heal you,” Harry’s face contorted painfully, desperately willing Draco to give him a chance to prove himself. His heart was racing wildly and when Draco stopped throwing his limbs around and relaxed into a calm posture, he smiled down at the blonde who was looking at him cautiously.
It didn't matter to him. The Weasleys, Granger, Harry, no one mattered to him. They were all pricks worse than Death Eaters and he didn't want their pity or namesake apologies which brought nothing but anger and agony to him. When he needed them, at least one of them couldn't spare a few minutes for him. Now that he was getting by on his own pretty well, Draco couldn't put the past behind him and move on by accepting the shitty lies spewing out of Granger's mouth.
“Ron, please. Please,” Harry finally resorted to begging and the urgency in his tone cracked open the harsh indifferent hatred Draco built around himself rather poorly. He’d been meaning to talk to Harry anyway. Seeing that he might have to postpone his visit to the Weasley Residence as Granger and Rose were currently residing at The Burrow, this would be his chance to talk to Harry.
“Here you go, Mr. Potter. Drink this. Allow a five for it to work. Mrs. Granger-Weasley has been taken to Ward number 10 and Healer Eastoft is with her. Mr. Wesley, your presence is required,” she said the last part to Ron. She smiled at both of them and Harry returned it before gulping down the potion and handing her back the empty vial.
"Marry me, Malfoy," he announced and saw Draco's now wiry blonde eyebrows shoot upwards, his sneer momentarily forgotten by Harry's rather ridiculous, if not funny, proposal. "Or, get The Kiss. Like your parents did just last week. I suppose you know they've passed away."
"Well, you do too. Morning breath," Harry said and lay his head back down under Draco's chin and sighed contently. His palms traced Draco's back and his legs hooked around Draco's calves. "I could get used to this," Harry stated, not wanting to look at Draco and find rejection in his eyes.
“Neither of us will be going anywhere, Draco. It’s time we ended this tug of war. You need answers and I’m ready to give them to you. Honest. But let me say this first. If you think you’ve suffered, I’ve suffered heaps too. We are still suffering.”
“Yeah? I hope so," Harry winked suggestively. "Hey, I’m sorry but can you get me the Daily Prophet from the living room, please?” Harry asked after a few seconds of looking around for the said paper on the dining table and not finding it.
“I prefer relaxing at home on my off days. Besides, I don't have many of them. As the Savior, I'm supposed to be fighting
“We’ll get there eventually. Tell me why you love to fly, Mr. Potter. Paint me a picture through your words,” she encouraged him. It always worked with her patients but not everyone was Harry Potter. Of course, she knew a lot about him yet it doesn’t make him any different or special when seated in the chair across her desk. He was the same as all the others who sat in that very chair seeking freedom from the chains that bound them to their demons, as Harry had put it earlier.
His stomach growled once again for the umpteenth time reminding him that he hadn’t eaten anything since a day or two. Reluctantly, he walked towards the kitchen to cook some food only to find Ronald Weasley snoring and drooling on the dining table. If he wasn’t so out of it, he would’ve screamed. Gritting his teeth angrily, at himself for not noticing Weasley’s arrival or at Weasley for breaking and entering but not waking the sole inhabitant of the home, Draco marched towards the sleeping man and slapped his palm down onto the table, a few inches from Weasley’s face. Ron sat up with a start, mumbling “Bloody hell!”
“Smells heavenly, yum!” Harry’s voice floated into the kitchen as he sat down on one of the dining chairs watching Draco cook breakfast.
His palms turned as cold as ice and his body shook in fear. What did he do? How could he almost kill a person, his husband at that? Suddenly, he was overcome with an urge to visit Draco and apologize to him. He remembered Ron dragging him away. Did ‘Mione heal Draco before leaving him to his devices? She would’ve! But what if she didn’t because she was too focused on him and not Draco?
"Granger, do you know what you're doing?" he asked and then chuckled at his stupidity. Of course, the know-it-all knew what to do. How foolish of him!
"Hello guys!" Harry's greeting was a bit more enthusiastic than Draco's but that was to be expected as he knew the guys in the room, unlike Draco.
A plethora of emotions closed in on his heart yet again upon taking in the lifeless eyes directed at him. Never in his life did Ron imagine that there would come a day when he would be compelled to help a Malfoy live. A voice that sounded like Harry’s in the back of his mind reminded him gently that the person in front of him was not a Malfoy anymore and Ron shook his head slightly to overthrow the voice.
“He’ll kill Draco,” his wife whispered now, the anger that consumed her not a moment ago leaving her posture in one long sigh.
“After the Christmas party, Harry came back to me asking about the Artificial Pregnancy Potion, how it worked, and where it is available, and so on. I shouldn’t have told him anything. If I’d known that he would spike your drinks to get you pregnant without your consent, I would never have told him about the potion,” Hermione started crying and she partly blamed it on her hormones.
"Who would've guessed I'd live to see a Malfoy wear a Weasley sweater for Christmas?" George commented and everyone laughed. They didn't mock him. No, they were trying to be civil with him by making light fun of his predicament.
The silence that surrounded them was heavenly to Draco as they lay stuck together, one crying silent tears, the other trying to hold on to both of them.
“We brought Sebastian back. He’s in the living room,” Hermione revealed not so excitedly, nonetheless, trying to cheer Draco up.
“Ah, yes, my apologies. Mr. Potter, your husband is physically fine. But we are not sure about the baby. So, we need to monitor him for some time before we can come to a conclusion,” he replied.
“We have sex, don’t we?” Harry shrugged and the motion annoyed Draco to no end. Ron winced as if the words physically hurt him.
He understood that in Draco's dictionary, it meant that it was more than great and about that, he felt utterly relieved. Somewhere in the middle, he thought that he was forcing Draco into this as he didn't even ask for the man's consent before doing whatever they had done but hearing from Draco's mouth that what they did was great, and Draco's body that responded to him sweetly and obligingly swept away his doubts into the gutter, to where they belonged.
“Lumos,” he whispered and his bedroom was filled with a faint white light. His magic wasn't strong yet, he noted, as it didn't get its share from Harry's core. Still, his surroundings were visible to him and that was all he needed.
“Please, Draco, I’m sorry. Don’t do this to yourself; I beg you,” Harry mumbled, pressing kisses all over Draco’s face.
Malfoy was thrown into silence. Tears threatened to fall from his eyes yet somehow he held them back. Harry Potter was humiliating him in every way possible and he could do nothing about it. It wasn't enough that his freedom was in Potter's hands; it wasn't enough that he was slaving himself instead of dying; it wasn't enough that he now had to live with a man he hated the most. The loss of his estates or their money didn’t bother him more than the fact that he now had to give up the only thing his parents left for him, the only thing he prided himself about for years. He had to give up being a Malfoy and become a Potter in order to live.
“You couldn’t accept me with all my failures so I tried to wipe them away in all the possible ways. Merlin, I did try so hard but I couldn’t get past that look you gave me back in the hospital. It reminded me of who I used to be and who I still am in your eyes and I just wanted it all gone,” Draco sniffed and coughed, his eyes still scrutinizing the used towel.
“You needn’t have come,” Harry said though he was looking sternly at all those who were itching to give both of them a piece of their minds. An old lady with greyed hair who sat opposite to them was openly grumbling about Death Eaters walking free. Draco seemed to be doing fine but Harry’s hand found Draco’s, silently asking the witch to shut up. As if pricked by a glass shard, Draco shook his hand off and shifted in his seat, trying to get further away from Harry. Harry frowned at him but didn’t comment on why he did what he did.
Surprisingly, Harry waited for Draco to finish. When Draco heard Harry cough a couple of times, he sighed, stood up, and opened the window to let all the exquisite smoke out. “Thank you,” he heard Harry murmur and he grunted in acknowledgment.
"Ron's right, Harry. It'll only get worse if he's read your interview in The Prophet," Hermione interjected the silence filled by Ron.
“Hold up a second! What? Woman, let me go!” Draco tried shaking off her hand but her grip was unforgiving. All the Quidditch muscle she had was being put to good use as she dragged him around like he was merely a tiny toddler. And she did let go after they reached Draco’s bedroom. He didn’t even want to ask her how she knew the room. It would be pointless.
Draco felt attacked when Ginny proceeded to throw open the wardrobe doors in search of Merlin knew what! It was the final straw she decided to draw from the haystack and Draco pulled her away from the wardrobe to keep her from tainting anything else.
“Her vitals are good. You will need to fill out some forms, Mr. Weasley, but that can be arranged for later. Please ensure that you follow the required practice of Cleanliness and Calm around the baby,” when Ron nodded and sheepishly pulled his now wet finger out of his daughter’s mouth, Eastoft turned to Hermione. “Mrs. Granger-Weasley, it is highly essential that you feed the baby girl now. If she is fed within the first one hour of her birth, both her magical and physical growth shall be stable throughout. As long as you are with us, we will be informing you of when and how to feed your baby. For today, we’ll limit the baby with your milk. Tomorrow, you and your husband will be taught how to stabilize your baby’s magical core with your own.”
Harry inhaled deeply as if preparing himself for a battle. “I came here for you. Again. I was worried about you after your panic attack.”
I didn't want to cause a scene so I invited you in, locked the door and told you that I was sorry for whatever I had done to you, that we could work things out and be together once more. I begged you not to marry Ginerva. You never even wanted to wear a promise ring and the ones I bought for us still sit at the bottom of my wardrobe waiting for your acceptance. And you came home that day with a ring on your finger and all I could think about was – 'What about the rings I bought for us?'
Draco didn’t flinch when Harry crept into the covers beside him and started applying Healing Salve on his bruises. His fists clenched the blanket tighter on his chest and he sighed at the mild relaxing burn as his pain dulled down.
"Have you ever had something on you that you desperately wanted to erase but couldn't? Something you're ashamed of because the only person who you thought would treat you as a human chooses to acknowledge that which you could never ever erase in the worst possible way?" Draco's eyes were vacant and distant as he forced his words to penetrate the depths of Granger's understanding.
The first step in rehabilitation was to admit that there’s something wrong with you. Harry had accepted that his anger was causing issues in his life and not many patients of hers do it. Denial. It’s as strong an emotion as it’s a word. It hindered whatever progress that could be made and closed in on its target. When it had been taken care of, then would come the actual problem of finding out which space the person found himself in. Did he love himself extremely or was it the other way round? If they did either one of them, why? Everything would be built around the simplest of questions – Why? How? What? When? Until, such a time when the patient would be ready to face the hardest question of the lot – Who?
Imagine his surprise, when for the second time, he found one Hermione Granger lounging about in the Kitchen, cradling a mug of coffee - Draco's precious coffee at that! Only this time, she looked plump and extremely cute wearing her pregnancy fat. Draco was beyond horrified that he put cute and Granger in one sentence but before he could recover from it, she got up and fixed a cuppa for Draco.
“Not much these days. I used to though. There was a thrill in putting people in their rightful place; where they actually belong. I loved chasing and catching all those running amok. It used to be so much fun. Now-a-days, it is all desk work. Doing paperwork for cases solved in the previous year and everything must be filled correctly. It’s exhausting whatever brain cells I have left.”
"I'll be there with you. Always," Harry smiled encouragingly while patting Draco's palm in a gesture of comfort, which calmed him down to an extent.
“I wonder how I’d do without my Lights in Azkaban. Think you could put in a word about that?” Draco didn’t let his voice falter as he lit another cig, not caring when Harry hissed in displeasure at Draco filling his house with nicotine and caffeine. Not that Draco cared.
"Yeah, me too," Draco replied almost immediately and Harry looked up at him in half bliss and half shock as if Draco would deny his statement at any second. When he didn't, Harry found himself tearing up rather childishly and he hid his face once again, dropping it down under Draco's chin.
“You could always dissolve your marriage and send him back to Azkaban,” she suggested, looking pointedly at Harry’s empty ring finger.
“We will only need to talk to each other and I can sense very well that you are uncomfortable here. You can set the place and time and I’ll be there for you. Check?”
“Tell me, Draco. Has anyone had a taste of you, hm? Did Voldemort bite into the son of his favorite Death Eater?” Harry pushed into Draco and the blonde felt the outline of Harry’s clothed erection.
The dinner was the best one Draco had in years and he gulped down more than his stomach could take. Molly was generous in serving food and Draco didn't protest. Even when his stomach screamed at him in pain, he didn't stop stuffing food into it. God knows when he'd be able to eat the good stuff again. Not that his cooking was bad, but Molly's was way better than anything he could ever cook in his lifetime.
"Please, Potter, it would be inglorious of me. I put your gift in your wardrobe. Feel free to dig it out," Draco answered and without further ado, Harry rushed towards their bedroom for his gift like a child, followed by Draco, who nervously wished to see if Harry accepted his gift or not.
“It won’t work,” Draco said instead. “You, me, we will never work, Harry. Just send me back to Azkaban or wherever. That is where I truly belong,” he confessed.
Draco’s throat was parched and his body was so weak that he couldn’t move any further until he took a gulp of the medicine. When the Anti-Flu Potion sat snugly in his right palm, he unscrewed the cap and gulped in a mouthful of the sweet minty potion which burned the walls of his throat as it passed through it and settled down. He then placed the bottle on the tea table and lied down on the sofa hardly caring about wrinkling his perfectly pressed shirt and trousers. What use had he for his formal dress robes anyway? Staying at home meant that he needn’t bother grooming himself or pressing his robes or styling his hair. If his younger self saw him now, Draco was sure that his younger self would commit murder by killing his older self. He chuckled at the mental image and slowly, as the medicine kicked in, he slipped drowsily into a surprisingly pleasant dreamless sleep.
When the silence Harry left behind was broken by Sebastian hooting loudly, Draco opened his cage, gingerly picked him up, and let him out into the fresh air. As he watched his owl spread his wings and soar into the night sky, probably hunting for prey, Draco wished he were a bird too. He could just fly away and leave everything behind without bother. He needn’t think about Harry or what would become of them. At least, up there in the sky, he would have a life of his own choice instead of someone else doing that for him. He would be free from being a Malfoy, a Death Eater, and Harry Potter’s insane husband.
Draco only sniffed harder in anger. He couldn't understand what was happening anymore. Just yesterday, they were happy, weren't they? Harry had come home early and they went to a muggle theatre to watch some stupid movie, whose name Draco couldn't recollect because of his current turmoil. They made out in the darkness of the theatre and almost got caught by the people sitting in front of them. Then they went to a French restaurant and had a good amount of sophisticated dinner that satisfied Draco's tastes before retiring to their home. Harry had been so gentle to him yesterday while making love and for the umpteenth time, Draco thought that he might be falling hard for his husband.
When her breathing was back to normal, Ron handed her a glass of water and she drank it appreciatively.
"Is poor Draco jealous? Does he want some kisses and cuddles?" it would've sounded so cringy if the situation was anything but this. But right then, Harry only mocked whatever Draco was feeling towards him and Draco's cheeks heated up in sheer humiliation. He sneered down at his husband before turning away and laying down on the bed as far as he could from Harry. Draco focused his gaze on the night sky through the window as he tried to lull himself back into a state of deep slumber where no one, not even Harry could enter.
"It was good. Hey, I was wondering if it would be okay with you if I had my sessions here instead," Harry asked.
“She’s still at the hospital. I meant to say that we had to discuss her discharge and a few other things with her Healer,” Harry corrected.
"Doesn't it feel like deja vu to you?" Draco queried. His head was spinning at the similarities in their meetings.
Draco’s eyes shone silver even in the partially lit room and Harry got lost in their intensity. He missed this closeness with Draco. His hands found Draco’s waist and squeezed hard. Harry knew that a conversation between them was long overdue and that was the reason why he chose to drop by and set things right between them – as right as they would get, given their states of mind. But with Draco so close to him, the lust he subdued came back to the front in full force. No man or woman could replace the way Draco felt in his hands, so supple, so compliant, so fierce, yet at the same time offering his entire being for Harry to take in.
"You KNOW the Mark," he stressed, hoping that she would unsee his shame he tried to burn but failed every single time.
He imagined how exhilarating sex would be with Draco but that was a thought for another day. Just not today.
Their marriage didn't necessarily require them to sleep in the same room, or in the same bed. It was a silent choice made by both of them as they knew that if they slept alone, they would only be haunted by dreams darker than a moonless night. Harry wanted an escape from his past and Draco wanted the same. So they clung onto each other for a modicum of sanity at least while they sleep. Their arms and legs never entangled and they never slept facing each other yet Draco's clothed back remained close enough to Harry's shirtless back under the duvet; just enough to keep their insanity and nightmares away.
. Would Harry stop blaming him for the loss of their child? Could Draco forgive Harry for all the pain he went through after a major trauma? Yet these questions were loud and too imposing to not be heard even under the thick blanket of silence.
"Draco, look at me," Harry whispered as he kissed his husband gently and Draco complied. Through his tears, he could see how much Harry wanted this, wanted him. The way Harry smiled down at him was more than he ever deserved and he couldn't help but etch this memory into an unerasable part of his mind. This man gave him a chance no one ever dared to give and for the first time in his life, Draco wanted to rewrite their past. He wanted to go back and make things right. He wished for all his bad deeds to be gone so that this future him would be free of that burden and live his life as Harry's equal instead of depending on him for everything.
Draco gagged. “Whatever gave you the idea? I’m mentally choking by your fashion choice. You look horrendous by the way.”
"Just leave me alone, please," Draco begged before the first punch fell hard on his right cheekbone.
That was the last needle, the thousandth one, and Harry breathed deeply, taking into account all the inquisitive eyes of the seven reporters sat in front of him in transfigured chairs.
“And I have the right to choose for him. You will not speak to him. If I find ANY of you flocking near me or my house in an attempt to speak to MY husband,” Harry left the threat hanging. The reporters were intelligent enough to understand as they moved out of his office in a straight line. The last one to leave was Rita Skeeter.
"You wouldn't. You can't," Draco smirked as he moved down, causing Harry's tip to slip in a little and his husband groaned mutely above him.
He kept repeating that phrase continually, ignoring the other wizards and witches glaring at him. If looks could kill, he’d be buried ash. As he passed by a couple who were huddled together – the man vomiting what looked like glitter rather fervently, given his state, into a tub-sized bucket and the black haired woman who looked pregnant, vanishing the lurid contents with a swish of her wand; he heard the woman whisper into the man’s ears, ‘… so cruel to even kill a baby!’ and covered her own belly in fright when Draco looked at her unwittingly.
"Potter," Draco looked up at him with lust-filled eyes and Harry's resolve to be gentle broke upon seeing Draco's blood coated face and his subtle hip moments, asking and begging for contact.
Harry's head hurt with all the counseling he'd been receiving tonight. He was tired and hungry. Most of all, he couldn't face Draco like nothing happened. He hadn't the spine right then. He couldn't look into his husband's eyes and take in all the pain and resentment he caused. At least, not right now.
Arya knew that the wheels in Harry’s mind had turned and it was a good sign. It wasn’t just the Healer who questioned their patients but after every session, there must be something that would provoke questions inside the person’s mind. The very same ones and they always started with why? And when one began to question oneself, the broken pieces of their soul – not just their minds, would automatically fit in their right places. They only need a push, in some cases, a hard shove.
Yet, looking to his side, there still remained a cold spot where Harry once used to be. “Do I?” he questioned himself contradictorily. Then his eyes found the empty birdcage nestled in a corner beside their wardrobes. “I think not,” he continued, rubbing his sore stomach gently but that didn’t help in curbing the agony in his heart.
After a month of living with his HUSBAND, Draco came to a conclusion that he could not predict in which category the day fell for Harry and he remained constantly on edge trying to decipher Harry’s mood for the day. Somedays, he’d find Harry up and about, whistling a tune while getting ready for his day at the Ministry. And on the other days, he’d look at Draco like he were nothing consequential but a pest to be exterminated immediately.
. They decided that they would take some time apart for healing, though there wasn’t much of that on Draco’s end and he wasn’t sure how good Harry had gotten with the help of his Mind Healing sessions. Did Harry’s condition not improve at all these past few days?
“Potter,” Draco dragged as if to say no but still wanting Harry close to him and the tremble in his voice was evident.
“Harry, Harry… I…, " Draco muttered unintelligibly as he stared into Harry’s green pools, asking him to understand the silence that followed.
"Yes! I'm sorry for going against your wishes but I was worried about him! He's not well at all. He needs help, Harry; he's harming himself," she spoke so fast that Harry couldn't understand what she was saying. Yet, he got the gist of it and tried to calm her down.
"Let go of me!" Draco made a move with his free left hand to snatch his wand which lay unmoving on the cold kitchen floor.
“Ah, thanks, Draco,” Harry took the paper from his hands and feigned glancing through it as he ate his breakfast.
“Because -,” Draco tried to think of anything; something so that Ronald would leave him alone. What could he say? Why was he still staying? If he said he liked Harry, would Ronald leave him alone? But, that would be lying as Draco still wasn’t sure that he liked the man after everything that’s happened between them. If anything, he could admit that he was fond of the man as long as neither of them hurt each other either physically or mentally. Did he need Harry for the sex? But he could live and had lived without sex for so long that it wasn’t necessary for his life. Yes, he’d appreciate some pleasure but it wasn’t mandatory. Somehow, his silence seemed loud and answerable enough to both of them. He had no choice but to stay there. It was inevitable. And, Ronald knew. His stare bore deep into Draco and he wanted nothing more than to hide. It was as if the ginger-head could read his thoughts and point out his fears.
From the pocket of his Auror uniform, Harry took out a small red ring box and placed it on the ground within Malfoy's reach before assuming his former posture.
"You can't be sure of that," Draco said, trying to grab his hand back but Harry didn't loosen his grip.
“You’re welcome. Still though, a wrong doesn’t make another wrong right. If you know what I mean,” she continued softly.
"What's wrong with you?!" Draco gritted out. He didn't know why he was angry though. All he wanted was an explanation for the state Harry was in and he certainly didn't like the perfume coming off of Harry's body. It didn't smell like Harry's cologne.
The look on Ronald's face was priceless as it morphed from the utter shock that they slept together to an expression of slight disgust at their homeliness before settling down into stuttering shame. To Draco, however, Hermione's lack of expression as if she knew about them all along, hurt his childish ego and he gave the pair his best sneer.
“Don’t sweat it, Granger. I don’t need your pity or your apology. You can leave after finishing your coffee. Good day,” he wished before exiting the room, ignoring Hermione’s protests.
“I did what you asked me to do!” Harry said excitedly as soon as Arya Reynolds stepped into their usual meeting place. She hadn’t even said a hello.
“Er, yeah. That’s great, I suppose. I’ll wait outside then. Just holler if you need me,” Harry was pretty sure that the last statement was for Draco.
The next day, Draco’s body was extremely stiff as he tried to get up from the sofa, where he sat sleeping the entire night with his head resting at an awkward angle, which now gave him a very sore neck. The Sun was unnaturally bright outside despite Summer coming to an end. As soon as his eyes adjusted to the light filtering in through the window, Draco chuckled as he wasn’t the only one who had an issue with the daylight. Sebastian was fast asleep, perched on the wooden branch inside his open cage. Nowadays, Draco deemed it best to leave the cage open for he knew that Sebastian would come back to him as his magic bonded with his owl for the latter to recognize Draco as his caretaker.
“You might not believe it but I Floo called my Mum and demanded her to tell me the truth. ‘Concentrate on your tournament, Ginny! Don’t lose focus!’ That’s what I got,” she chuckled humorlessly. “I was repeated the same words from Ron and Hermione. They said they were taking care of everything to the best of their abilities and not once did I doubt them. I should’ve! What was Harry thinking when he did that to you?! Without your consent! This is the lowest I’ve ever seen him and what could I even do? A punch could hardly hurt him; or a stinging hex for that matter,” Ginny’s voice edged on pure anger now.
Snatching out a clean towel from his wardrobe, he wiped himself and threw on a nightshirt and boxer shorts randomly by the time Harry stepped out of the bathroom, a towel tied round his waist.
“I am telling you the truth! Soon after I heard that your mother passed away, something pulled me towards you and all I wanted then was to get you out of Azkaban. Marrying you was the only way I knew to break you out of that place. This was why I forced you to take my last name. As long as you are a Malfoy, Azkaban will be your first home,” Harry paused and looked around the room. He didn’t want to see the emotions swirling around in Draco’s beautiful eyes. It would be too painful to take in all the hurt and the anger directed at their situation. But he waited for Draco to say something. Anything! Yet his husband only stayed dead silent, continually pulling the alight cherry and blowing out the smoke in cloudy wisps. Harry cleared his throat to get Draco’s attention and continued, “Kingsley later might have mentioned that the pull to save you must be a repayment for the Life Debt I owe to your mother. I don’t know how true it is though.”
“Please, he’s my husband now and I will not accept anyone badmouthing him. He’s served his sentence well. He’s a free man now and I’d appreciate you treating him with the respect he deserves,” Harry’s words left the entire lobby in a deafening silence.
Your eyes begging me for forgiveness across the Ministry, pleading with me to understand why you did what you did, was one sight I could never ever erase from my mind. You tried your best to defend my actions but I knew that there was no absolution for me. Maybe, you and your friends might find me 'not guilty' but I found myself guilty. I deserved punishment but your love saved me from it. Not entirely but at least from the worst, Azkaban. I could live anywhere, even at the bottom of an Ocean if I had you. We could make our home anywhere in this world because I knew for sure that we'd be together till my life ends. I smiled at you as you left the court with your red-headed friends and that was all it took for you and me to understand that all is forgotten and forgiven. Everything would be better in the coming days. We were sure of it. When your freckled best friend, Ronald Weasley, turned around at smiled at me in acknowledgment and patted you on your back, we both knew that there are people who are willing to forgive and forget, to change for a better world. Irrevocably, we'd all joined our hands in hopes for a better future filled with love and joy.
The room burst into laughter once again except for Ronald, who fumed in embarrassment rather than in anger.
Harry’s responses were steadily shocking Draco. He wasn’t calm all the time but he sure was better than before. No snapping at irregular intervals, or hitting, or forcing Draco to admit things he didn’t want to say out loud. It was a strange feeling and Draco liked it. No, he could never forgive Harry for all the crap his husband put him through. Then again, Draco wasn’t innocent either. If Harry chose to lock away Draco deeds and forgive him for the past and the Mark on his arm, then Draco supposed he must be willing to let go of things too. The only problem was that he didn’t know if he could let go.
“Mate, what are you doing?!” Ron exclaimed in concern. Hermione stood near the door with her palms plastered over her mouth, unable to take in the horror she witnessed not only then but the day before. She hadn’t imagined that her best friend, who always smiled and always felt like home, would be reduced to an angry slobbering mess.
“Goddammit, yes, yes, yes! I like it! I love it when you do that, baby,” Harry ranted incoherently as he once again pressed into Draco’s crevice, seeking more warmth.
“If all I wanted was a child, I could’ve asked ANYONE and they wouldn’t have said no,” Harry’s temper was audible in his words. Draco stiffened angrily at the thought as flashes of Harry having sex with a stranger in their living room, on their sofa ran across his mind.
Then, he remembered finishing up some case files and a little after lunch, when his anger still didn’t vanish, he left for the day only to end up at a bar. He supposed he drank the entire store before barging into his own house and finding Draco eating his dinner at the dining table. And the anger which was quenched by liquor came back to the forefront.
“You didn’t want to before, did you?” Harry wanted to say it softly but it came out as an accusation, at which Draco visibly flinched, his eyes flitting nervously at Harry’s clenched fists.
For the third time, Draco began watching the season one of Supernatural, admiring Dean's humor and stripping Sam of his unnecessary clothes with his eyes. Being married to a bloke surely turned him gay or he probably had been inclined towards both the genders all along and he simply didn't recognize it to explore. He took a large gulp of coke before dragging on the cig he held loosely in his right hand. There was no better place than nicotine and caffeine combined into one, settling warmly down in his stomach. Strange, but oh so blissful.
“Stop!” Draco’s vocabulary was limited to a couple of words as fear gradually crept into his veins like pumping warm blood.
It was a while before he regained consciousness and he noticed that Harry still sat on the floor at his dangling feet. The irony of it brought another noiseless chuckle to his lips. His body was beyond exhausted and it took him a good four to five tries to finally sit up on the sofa, sneering disdainfully at his blood and Harry’s semen coating the blue upholstery. It needed a change now that it was tainted. He removed his legs from their position on the sofa arm and the movement spurred Harry into action. Draco watched wearily as his husband stood up and did the same as if they were in a staring contest. Blood now dripped from Harry’s wounds scantily onto the floor, Draco observed. Harry stretched his left hand out and his discarded wand flew into his palm effortlessly. He then partially healed the cuts Draco inflicted on his chest and waist until they were no longer bleeding.
In light of current situation, I urge you, my friends, to stay calm at home, to practice social distancing. Be safe and sound!
“Yes, I do know that, Mr. Potter. You said you love the way you flew. Explain that to me,” she replied smoothly, unfazed. Harry recollected himself before explaining and he didn’t even need to think about it.
Pulling in a deep one, he looked at Harry, who was now sporting a bright red bruise on his right jaw. He’d been a punching bag and a whore that miscarried to Harry because of the choice he made. But as he previously said, he wasn’t really given a choice exactly. The choices were already made for him by external forces. Despite what he wanted, Draco had to go with the choice that was crafted for him. Taking the Mark was loads better than losing his family. Taking Harry’s hand in marriage had seemed a better place than slowly losing his sanity until he was administered the Kiss.
“Yes, I was. I wanted to move on from my past. That was one of the reasons I went back to Draco. We are similar. I can’t explain it properly but he and I, we’re the same though we were on the opposite sides of the war. Maybe that’s what made our situations so similar. I felt like he’d understand me when no one else did. And to my surprise, he’s all I ever asked for. I was happy to be by his side but,” Harry trailed off.
“Until I know what happened to me, I won’t be leaving this place,” Draco announced with a slight quiver to his tone.
“Mr. Potter. There are other patients in the hospital. I need you to calm down and rein in your magic,” the Healer warned.
“Off to the living room, both of you. I will stay here and guard the knives. And if you need help, scream for me,” he directed the last bit at Draco and Harry relaxed in Ron’s arms, knowing that there was someone to protect Draco lest he should blow a fuse.
It took a while for him to realize that she was telling the nurses about the Healer she saw during her pregnancy. If he remembered correctly, just this morning (or afternoon), she’d been to see her.
“Funny you should ask that. Besides, why are you still here, Harry?” Draco’s voice broke a little at the end. The name which he had chanted in the throes of his ecstasy not moments ago seemed so hard to say with a clear conscience. It was beyond humiliating.
“Fine then,” Draco gave in because it was exactly as Harry said. There was no denying or burying the truth. He sat down on the sofa and gestured Harry to do the same. Once they were seated, Draco asked with a sneer, “What prompted you to bawl your eyes out like a baby earlier?”
Three weeks after their anniversary, on a rather warm Spring Sunday, Draco and Harry found themselves at the Weasleys for lunch. Draco felt queasy but he wouldn’t give up on Molly’s cooking for anything in the world. He thought that whatever was troubling him would pass once his stomach had its fill of Molly’s delectable food. But, his condition only worsened as his stomach started somersaulting a few minutes after lunch. Abandoning his one-sided conversation with Hermione about the Architectural development of the Wizarding World, he rushed to the nearest bathroom and emptied the contents of his stomach rather violently.
“You don’t have to tell me now if you don’t want to,” she said softly after a long while and Harry nodded.
“Draco, please, stay,” Harry took Draco’s right palm in his’ but he pulled away from Harry’s touch as if singed by fire.
“He hurt me, didn’t he? I may have hurt him physically but he scarred my heart. I am not the only one at fault, am I?” at that very moment, Harry seemed no older than a tired seventeen year old boy to Arya. He’d been calling himself names and agonizing over hurting and almost killing his husband that he failed to acknowledge the pain others put him through.
Apparently, all the Ministry employees except a few select Aurors were given holidays until Christmas. And Harry was just one of those SPECIAL Aurors that the Ministry seemed reluctant to let go of.
“I CHOSE it, yes. But the Dark Lord did it,” he couldn’t look at Harry anymore and not cry in frustration. So, his gave his visual attention to a used towel dangling over the steel rack.
“Disillusionment Charm! I can use it on myself. No, my magic isn’t strong enough to perform such a complex charm. You can do it, can’t you?” he asked excitedly but Ginny looked unfazed. He could already read her expression that screamed there would be no Disillusionment Charm involved whatsoever during their trip to town.
Thank you Madcheshirefox, Irisk, Kikukaku, Azules, papercutter, diddleymaz, AKZoey, serilla, PeoniesandIrises for taking the time and effort to share your thoughts!
Nobody would ever know who started it first, or if it was merely a whispered spell instead of manual work, but within minutes, a naked Harry was pushing an equally naked Draco into the wall, their positions now reversed, and his erection was snugly held between Draco’s butt cheeks.
"Come, let's cut my cake together and celebrate your birthday too," Harry said, extending his hand which didn't hold the knife for Draco.
Harry didn't expect Draco to reciprocate his feelings when he admitted that he liked the man. That would be a long road they needed to travel but if anything would bring them closer than they already were, Harry would choose it. So, he kept on kissing his husband, hoping that Draco would understand how much Harry needed him. Whatever Harry did in the past or would do in the future, he hoped that Draco had in it him to carry all his burdens and mistakes so that they could live a life together, no matter how deviant it would turn out to be. Neither of them was perfect, and Harry needed someone - he needed Draco, to face his imperfections as Harry couldn't do it alone.
“I’m sorry, Draco. I’m so goddamn sorry,” Harry hugged the man and Draco let him. For the first time, Harry felt Draco’s arms wound around him in a gentle but desperate embrace as the blonde cried into Harry’s chest, letting out all his held back anguish until that point in his life. It was so unbecoming of a Malfoy but then again, Harry reminded himself, Draco was no Malfoy anymore and he was allowed to cry like any other normal human being. It had always been the other way round. Draco held him but never held onto him. There would always be times when the ones pretending to be strong would break down. It was Harry's fault that he couldn't control his actions and no amount of apologies could ever make things right or could turn back the time. He could only wish for forgiveness as he said sorry over and over again until Draco found it in him to forgive and maybe, forget too.
Not wanting to look any further inferior to the two Gryffindors, Draco sat up straight. His demeanor changed in a split second as he let go of the intimidation he felt in his husband’s presence. Ron was with them and though the ginger-head hated him, he wouldn’t allow Harry to inflict any pain on him. He’s safe.
“Please, Mr. Potter, he must be removed as he is stressing the baby,” Draco heard someone say. Who was it again? He couldn’t remember; he couldn’t
Anger. That was all Harry had in him which rendered him thoughtless, basically, emotionless. Draco didn’t know what happened to the great Harry Potter after the war but something must’ve broken in him, just like Draco himself, whose broken pieces still lay scattered all over the Wizarding World. The pieces that stayed with him, despite everything, only brought his darkest nightmares to life when he slept. The pieces he held now made him nothing but a foolish coward seeking out love and friendship in places where there was nothing or no one but another coward, Harry-sodding-Potter, trying to hold on to his broken pieces without letting them go.
“Please, ‘Mione, give him more credit than that. You asked him to go and talk to Malfoy. So, he went. He’s getting better and you know it,” Ron gathered her in his arms and rubbed soothing circles between her shoulder blades in an attempt to comfort her.
"Good. Yes, you be ready and I'll be ready too," Harry nodded, with his hands on his hips, an early Christmas blush decorating his cheeks.
Harry wasn't fairing any better. The resigned and betrayed look in Draco's eyes kept following him wherever he went. With doubts like what would've happened if he hadn't come back to his senses; or what would've Draco done if Harry had carried on with his assault; Harry just went through the motions in his life. Yes, they ate together and Draco made them coffee as usual while Harry read the Daily Prophet. They spoke to each other cordially but both of them could crystal clearly see the line they drew between themselves. Harry's nights were filled with his past fears when he wanted nothing but the war to be over and to come out of hiding. The days he had spent praying precariously for the lives of his friends, Dumbledore's untimely and rather crucifying death, Snape's death, Hermione's screams at the Malfoy Manor, everything came back at once to the front of his mind like a Tsunami and he wished for his eyes to open just so he could escape from all the things he'd locked not long ago.
“What are your intentions behind releasing him from Azkaban, a place which he certainly deserves to be for the rest of his life?”
“I am deeply compelled to kick you out and ward the house and the Floo connection against you, Weasley,” Draco hissed angrily.
He watched Harry cough and the tears contained in his eyes spilled down and landed on Draco’s clothed chest. Sighing exasperatedly at Harry’s attempt, Draco took the bud back, inhaled it slowly, savoring the bitterness that filled him yet again. Before he could blow out the smoke, Harry caught his face by his chin, lifted it up an inch and pressed their lips together. The kiss they shared was sinuous at best as Draco reluctantly opened his mouth to Harry’s tongue which tried to lick the smoke off of every nook and corner of Draco’s cavern. Harry’s spectacles, which he gifted, poked him uncomfortably on the forehead but that didn’t matter. Harry’s presence, as he always knew, was better than Nicotine. He didn’t care that the saliva they shared dribbled down their chins, which was extremely dirty. Nor did it bother him that Harry’s nails were digging painfully into his chest through his shirt. All he needed was Harry to consume him like he always did. Let his heart shatter some more with every pleasantly horrifying kiss and burning touch. Let his mind go numb with agony so powerful that his every thought would scream for Harry alone. Even after the taste of smoke was washed away, they didn’t stop kissing. Only when Draco felt wetness on his cheeks which he was sure that it wasn’t saliva, he broke the kiss.
"Draco?" the annoying someone shook his body hard and as high as he was, Draco was jerked into consciousness at once, his vision clearing at a dramatic rate.
Harry raised a palm, effectively stopping Rita, who was about to ask something. They had their turn and now, it was Harry’s.
"Good," he nodded. He needed a smoke. Now. His hands impulsively came together and his right-hand fingers started twisting his wedding ring again, a secondary means of comfort if a cig wasn’t available.
“I talked about this with ‘Mione and she too thought it was better for you guys to heal separately. We will help too. Right now it’d only be me as ‘Mione has to look after Baby Rose,” Ron replied, smiling faintly.
Yet when the knife vanished from the underside of his chin and his survival instincts kicked in yet again, Draco couldn't help but fight Harry again to the best of his abilities. He prided himself for landing a rather hard kick in Harry's stomach and the man fell over backward. Now, if only Draco could get away from this mad prick... He scrambled a few inches away but once again, when Harry's hands clamped down on his foot and pulled him back to where he was a few minutes ago, Draco somehow knew that he wouldn't get out of his predicament alive. Harry Potter was going to KILL him tonight and there was no one to stop him from doing so.
Inside the room, he saw Draco fast asleep on the hospital cot; his skin deathly white. The Helpers who tagged along with Healer Yeager were moving their wands over Draco in repeating motions which irked Harry more than it should’ve; not knowing what they were doing to his comatose husband.
“We can fly, can’t we?” Draco had asked. He wanted to know what it’d be like after all those years of yearning for a chance to fly away. Flying was something he desperately missed and when his eyes found a cluster of them in the garage, Draco couldn’t help the words of interest tumbling out of his lips.
"When are we going to talk about what happened? Or what will happen?" the post-haze period mellowed Draco's stern exterior a bit and it was loud in the way he spoke.
Harry came stumbling in with Draco’s two suitcases and a large duffel bag filled with clothes and other essentials they’ve purchased for Draco now that his possessions had long been gone before coming to this place.
"Harry!" Hermione yelled, breaking the silence in the ward, as she rushed to Draco's aid after hearing what Harry uttered.
First, Shacklebolt made Draco remove the band he already placed on his finger during his encounter with Potter in Azkaban and placed it together with Harry’s wedding band on a small velvet cloth. The ring Harry bought for himself was similar to Draco’s but the gold and platinum weave it sported was in the opposite direction to that on Draco’s ring. Their rings had three medium-sized platinum rings held together by gold wires that weaved through them vertically. On Draco’s ring the weave slanted towards the right while on Harry’s ring, it was to the left. Shacklebolt whispered some magical incantation on both the rings and they were enveloped in a pale white glow once the spell was done.
“I’ve never seen ground coffee packed like this,” Draco said, sneering down at the coffee bag in his hands.
He was sat in the Mind Healer’s office – sparsely furnished, save for a wide desk and a couple of chairs around it. The desk was littered with what he supposed were case files of her patients on one side and on the other side, a quill stand, a couple of ink bottles of distinct inks, a round gold clock that winked at him every minute, and some more files in an orderly way. There were bookshelves on the walls which hadn’t a door. Basically, there were too many books to his utter dislike.
The drag hit his head at once and his shaking stopped almost instantly. Sitting on the window sill with his head lolling on the frame, he watched the clouds of smoke he exhaled with genuine interest when a sharp pain laced through his nose. The Skele-Gro was starting its work on him, he reckoned.
Shacklebolt watched them with an expression that was unfathomable and cleared his throat when their exchange was finished.
Yet, he would still go on trying to find forgiveness wherever he could. And, he wasn't alone in his quest.
"Please, you need to talk to him and sort out your issues. Draco needs help too," she repeated, silently begging Harry to save his husband before he lost him.
Sneering at his husband through tears of shame, Draco snatched his hand back and wiped the vile spit away using the blanket.
Harry didn't make any renovations and left it as is. When the winds picked up even slightly, a fair bit of light grey debris flew all around like pollen. The broken parts of his home reminded him of his childhood and all the years he'd spent running around the Manor and the garden. Leaning on the wall next to its magnificent gates, his hands shook as he opened the pack of Marlboro Lights. He put the fag in his mouth, pocketed the pack, and using the newly bought lighter, he lit the tip of the cigarette.
They did as told and his ring sat snugly once again against his ring finger. He had officially and legally chosen to become a Potter. Even his Father’s name was no longer attached to his first name after the exchange was done.
The digital clock clicking away on top of the Television box read eleven in the night and his stomach growled.
"Cut the cake, Potter. Unlike you, some people here want to eat it," Draco replied, twisting his fingers together so as to not grab the cake for himself and Harry laughed.
“I like to enjoy the fruits of my labor, darling,” Harry called out as he watched Draco’s form disappear out of the kitchen.
“Since this is our first session, let’s talk about something that you like about yourself,” she started.
"Hello, Mr. Potter. I'm Healer Yeager. What seems to be the problem here?" a tall man with cropped hazel hair inquired upon recognizing the trio.
The Daily Prophet wrote in bold the story of how he KILLED the child but forgot to mention the fact that it was Harry who betrayed him first by spiking his drinks. Frigging drinks! Which also caused his miscarriage. He was never going to have another drink. Ever. Harry did nothing to refute the lies Daily Prophet printed and Draco wasn’t in a position to do anything about it. Of course, he didn’t expect any help from St. Mungo’s as the staff there would never side with a Death Eater like him by going against the boy who saved them all. So he simply let the world believe the crap parchment and locked himself in their bedroom, which now was devoid of Harry’s scent and belongings. Neither Harry nor his friends were present when Draco was discharged from St Mungo’s. Not even Molly and he had believed that the lady had forgiven him for the past. Maybe, she didn’t and only played along for Harry’s sake and lucky for her, this incident gave her a chance to cut him off completely. Whatever, he was past caring and somehow, through all the fatigue, when he Flooed back to their home, he found it dark and empty and their guest bedroom was littered randomly with Harry’s belongings, which the man probably shifted in haste before Draco’s arrival.
Draco held Harry close to his heart and let him cry to his heart's content. Maybe that was all they needed. To accept each other as they were - battered and withered. They couldn't ever be fixed but they might not need fixing as long as they understood that they were broken. There wasn't always a need to fix a broken thing. Just couple it with something else that's broken and it might not feel as lonely or worthless anymore.
“I’ll give you ten minutes. Meet me downstairs,” she announced with an air of finality before leaving the room.
Healer Yeager had never given emotional advice to anyone. It wasn't his duty. But, he supposed he could make an exception for the man that saved them all from a gruesome fate.
“What do you feel, Mr. Potter?” her voice was supposed to be extremely soothing according to Ron and ‘Mione but Harry wanted nothing more than to un-hear whatever she was saying and would be saying.
The letter which Hermione sent crinkled annoyingly on the tea table and Draco grudgingly resolved to visit Ron and Hermione’s home that evening. He would go see the baby, give her a gift probably, and if this resolve of his didn’t melt completely by then, he would talk to Harry once again if the man looked sane enough. Just a casual talk; an exchange of common pleasantries. The thought of it seemed so foreign that his heart pounded against his ribcage in a mixture of anticipation and excitement.
“Hm, then you should’ve chosen The Dementor’s Kiss instead of me,” Harry’s fingers dug into Malfoy’s cheekbones; their faces merely inches away.
“The man of the day,” Harry agreed, settling his glass of firewhiskey on the tea table when Dean torched the Wendigo, saving everyone.
“Should never have chosen you,” he whispered as silent tears flowed out of his eyes singly, dropping down soundlessly onto the upholstery.
When he pecked her lightly on her lips, he felt her press into him for a couple of moments longer and Ronald wanted nothing more than to stay with her and hold her all night. In the back of his mind, he promised himself that tonight would be theirs and theirs alone and he relayed the same to his wife by deepening their kiss until they had to part due to lack of air.
“What do you mean?” Mrs. Reynolds queried with a raised eyebrow, finally closing the journal and handing it back to Harry.
He whirled around as tears seeped out of his eyes and exited the room. He couldn’t look at the man who put his child on the brink of death. Heck, he couldn’t even breathe the same air as him anymore!
The next morning, when he woke up, Harry was not in their room anymore but left him Draco’s old wand on the bed beside him with no note. And, Draco understood. He was alone in this and he decided stubbornly that he would live through it without Harry’s help.
“Draco, look. I wanted a family. And I wanted you to be a part of it. So I did what I did,” Harry explained.
She couldn’t be more right that she already was. He wanted to change. He wanted to be a man who forgave himself so that he could be rid of his past transgressions. Yet, he could only see that road closed on him permanently after his miscarriage. Harry
“I really am sorry about that. I should’ve, no, we should’ve talked first. I’ll get straight to it, Draco. ‘Mione told me that you were hurting and you’re smoking too -” and that was where Draco tuned out whatever Harry had to say as he discreetly pulled his left hand under his back so as to avoid Harry’s sharp eyes. Give it to Granger for babbling like an old fool. Not that he expected her to stay quiet but why couldn’t she have kept her big mouth shut for once in her goddamn life and left him alone like everyone else did? Why had she sent Harry, of all people – not that he had any at the moment, to talk?
Thank you diddleymaz (I never had Raspberry. Should try sometime!), Brambles, Madcheshirefox, The_Real_Nymphadora, Kikukaku, Yuizae for sharing your thoughts with me!
“Thank you,” she smiled sweetly and threw a pinch of Floo powder into the hearth. “Meet you on the other side, Draco. Diagon Alley!”
"The child or me," Draco left the choice for Harry now though he was pretty sure Harry would not choose him. He was never anyone's first choice; not in the past and certainly, it wouldn't be so now or in the future.
“Don’t. Just don’t,” Draco interjected. “All these months, I needed you. You knew that. You KNEW, Harry. Where were you?” Draco found Harry’s guilt-ridden eyes.
Red hair swam in his vision until it gave a clear view of Ronald Weasley in his face, still shaking him ever so eloquently.
They moved to the living room with a completely clothed Harry. One look at the chocolate cake and Draco knew Hermione baked it. Though he hated to admit it, he really wanted a piece of it as it had been years since he at least sniffed a chocolate cake much less ate a piece of it. It was one of his favorite desserts and though Hermione did not bake it with authentic chocolate, he'd love to have some and he urged Harry to cut it faster, all the while matching Ronald's glare with one of his own entirely dedicated to the ginger head.
“Yes,” Draco replied and watched as Harry brought the cigarette to his lips and sucked on it rashly, like a first-timer usually did; like Draco had done on the grounds outside his Manor all those months ago.
Harry seemed to not have heard what he uttered and Draco wasn’t bothered. He sighed in defeat. “Fine,” he grumbled before marching past Harry, towards the staircase, knowing well that Harry would soon follow and catch up with his him.
“We’re going out and that’s final,” she declared as she surprisingly pulled Draco by his wrist and led them to his bedroom.
“I’ll go and check on them now, okay? Please calm down,” Ron sat her down on the sofa while he shook her head. “No, I’ll go,” she insisted.
“Yes, I am a poof for you, Draco, and I’m quite certain that deep down, you want this too,” Harry remarked.
"Eating, Harry. Seeing that you're home now, do come and join me," Draco invited, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
“Forgive me for losing my brain in the heat of the moment and not using a condom. If it’s any consolation, it was my first time too,” Harry stated.
“I don’t… Draco, I came here to apologize and to know the reason behind your attacks and why you're hurting yourself,” Harry said, not quite meeting Draco’s eyes.
Draco nodded in greeting and made his way towards the small open window on the far side of the tiny room.
“Haven’t had the opportunity. Working at the Ministry as an Auror takes up a huge chunk of my time,” replied Harry.
Now feeling many pairs of eyes at them, Harry let go of Draco and cleared his throat. “The hospital isn’t an apt place for our discussion, Draco. I don’t know
Draco exhaled a big cloud of smoke before saying, “It reminds me of what I’ve done, the choices I made. Just like the Mark.”
Harry let Draco talk. He knew how much pain Draco needed to get off his chest and one of these days, he had been planning to introduce Draco to Healer Arya Reynolds. It would do both of them immense good if they wished to stay together; especially, if Draco wanted to be with him even after the pain Harry put him through. Given their situation, it didn’t seem highly likely that they’d remain together after everything was said and done.
He then started conversing with his owl, Sebastian, and when his owl was resting, Draco took to a cluster of DVDs that he played on repeat. Mostly, Supernatural. He could even recite the dialogues! Draco doubled over with laughter - the only time he ever laughs these days was during his Supernatural season one marathons - at the exorcism scene because of Dean’s rather comedic expressions. That man could speak volumes with expressions alone and Draco thought that it’d be nice if he could be as expressive as Dean. Then the people could see him for what he was. A weak recreant thirsting for a hand in friendship and a heart in love.
