“Master Draco must eat.”
“Why wouldn’t I be? You keep telling me that I’m safe here.”
“Hold your tongue,” Lucius snapped.
“Don’t. It’s okay, I promise.”
“Well, you’re Harry Potter, aren’t you?”
“Well.” The man stepped still closer, and Draco felt his hot breath on his face. “They’ll learn their mistake, soon enough. But some of us,” his hand came up and stroked through Draco’s hair, “know real quality when we see it.”
“Please. Let me feel them.”
He wanted to hide deep in the darkness, but the noises and lights wouldn’t let him. They battered at his skull, seared his eyes even through his closed lids, dragged at his consciousness with cruel talons until his mind ran with blood like his body. He tried speaking to them, asking them to leave him alone, but they didn’t hear. He tried pushing them away, but his arms wouldn’t move.
“Nnngh!” he grunted, low in his throat.
She answered instantly and firmly. “With all my heart.”
Harry thought bitterly.
“Now, look here, Dumbledore,” the blonde witch began.
friends, too.”
“You have to summon stronger magic than mine, then you can break my spell."
“I can’t let you take him, just like that!” he protested, real fear in his voice. “It’s against regulations!”
With that inarguable statement of fact, Bob turned for the cradle that waited by the wall to receive Wart. It was a lovely, Victorian thing that stood up tall on carved legs, rocked smoothly when touched, and had once sported a ruffled canopy that Harry had discarded with evident disgust. Now, its sides were draped with snuggly blankets and its mattress was littered with a veritable menagerie of plush toys that no Magical Victorian child of high birth would have been suffered to touch. A mobile dangled from the crosspiece, hung with detailed replicas of Magical creatures that fluttered and writhed and roared in tiny voices or emitted gouts of colorful smoke when poked with a wand (a gift from Hagrid, obviously).
Harry had nothing to say to this, so he pressed a kiss to Draco’s temple and rested a cheek on his hair.
“What about this morning in bed?” Draco murmured, his lips sliding messily on Harry’s and heating with the promise in them. “And against the wall in the library? And on the counter in the…”
“Draco,” he whispered, now petting his hair. “Draco, tell me you’re all right.”
“So, in your opinion, the only unusual magic Harry Potter has performed is the Fertility magic he used to get Draco Potter pregnant.”
“Is it that Ravenclaw ponce I saw you with before the break?”
“When, Draco?” Harry gave him a sharp shake. “When was I supposed to find you?
“Potter!” Draco protested.
” Draco fairly howled.
He opened a velvet box that lay in the drawer and pulled out a piece of jewelry—a simple bangle made of polished silver set with moonstones. Slipping it over his left hand, he let it fall around his wrist and studied the effect in the dressing table mirror. The oval stones caught the sunlight pouring through the window and sparkled blue and purple.
“Well, then, consider me the first.”
“He wasn’t a prisoner. He was in your sole charge.”
Ron emerged from under the bed with a cardboard box in his hands. Like everything else in the room, it was shabby and worn and dirty, but she could instantly tell that it didn’t belong here. There was nothing of the brightly-painted whorehouse about it. It was simply a battered, old box that might have come out of any attic in the city.
“Mm.” He stirred slightly, trying to lift his head, but it seemed to weigh a few tons, and the best he could manage was to turn it slightly toward the voice. “Pr…fess..s…”
"Maybe."
She stared at the undamaged hand for a disbelieving moment, then suddenly erupted in a blind rage. Hair and robes flying, her shrieks and howls filling the dungeon chamber, she hurled the hand at the floor, the table, the walls, leaving gouges in every stone surface it touched and sending half of the Death Eaters cringing away from her in alarm. It was Voldemort’s cold laughter that finally brought her back to herself. She stopped dead, Draco’s adamant hand clutched in both of her own, poised above her head, about to come crashing down on Wormtail’s unprotected skull.
“You just reminded me that I
“I would,” Harry growled. The glare he gave Andromeda would have shriveled a lesser woman where she stood. “I
“Hey, I’m the sodding Savior, remember? I’m
Draco threw him a wild, wide-eyed look, so clearly on the verge of hysteria that it sent a chill down Harry's spine. "Back from where? I don't understand." He held his truncated arm out to Harry and said, a frantic edge to his voice, "Why did you take it away? I was just learning to use it, and you were going to teach me to catch the snitch and… I need it, Harry. It's
“I think it’s lovely, dear.” She reached over to pat his hand. “If I’ve told him once, I’ve told him a dozen times, it’s a shame for such a handsome boy to shut himself away out there in that lonely old cottage. I thought my niece might do for him, but I see he had other ideas.”
"Are you sorry you let the other one go?"
A swift, happy smile swept over his face, as he said, “Brilliant! Madam Pomfrey says she’s perfectly healthy.”
"Yes, indeed. The hates and loves of teenage boys feel as though they could shake the foundations of the world, when they happen, but they are nothing more than tiny ripples in a very big lake."
Dead silence met his words. No one moved, until Tidsworthy called, “Go on, then! Don’t make Mr. Potter repeat his instructions!”
*** *** ***
He wanted to cry at the thought. His eyes were raw and red with the need for tears, but they remained stubbornly dry.
“You got him out alive, which is more than we could do for Crabbe.”
Harry’s face tightened. “He wouldn’t.”
Potter nodded solemnly. “Understood.”
Lissy tilted her head back to fix him with huge, tear-drenched, reproachful eyes but did not loosen her clutch on his legs. “Harry Potter is promising many things he is not doing,” she said dolefully.
“Of course I did.” He gave Harry an odd look, one corner of his mouth twitching up in disbelief. Then he reached up to wipe a thumb across Harry’s lips and spell away the blue lipstick that smeared them. “You knew that.”
“I’ll just call him…”
"Snape didn't give me time. It's about Malfoy."
The two young men strolling among them, anonymous as they were with hats pulled down to their eyebrows and scarves wrapped up to their noses, might have passed unnoticed, except that Harry insisted they hold hands as they walked. Icklesford was not exactly lost in another age, but it was still parochial enough to find this a noteworthy sight. More than one person did a double-take and watched them longer than was polite, once they realized that the slighter figure at Harry’s side was as male as he was and not a tall, square-shouldered woman.
He only smoked under pressure, but he had spent a lot of the last night under pressure (hence the chain-smoking that had consumed half the pack conjured by Auror Leaming), and that didn’t look like changing anytime soon. Not with Potter sitting next to him and Weasley fussing over him like a broody hen.
a Death Eater,” Hermione said sadly. “They confiscated the entire Malfoy estate, and most of the Black estate, too, even with you and Teddy both legally entitled to inherit. If they’re willing to take an inheritance from
"Did you ever study Muggle art?" he asked, abruptly.
him, to know he was alive and well—and it took every ounce of restraint he possessed not to go charging over to the Slytherin table and demand to know where he was. He didn’t have the attention to spare for his housemates’ ribbing.
Draco lifted it from his palm. He held it awkwardly, as if he didn’t remember how, and ran his free hand up the length of the wooden shaft. Sparks shot from the tip, gold and silver, to fizzle in the air.
She glanced down at her leg and the enormous sliver of oak driven up into it like a blade. Blood painted her skin and soaked her robe. She knew it was serious, but her brain refused to register anything beyond the danger to Harry. "I know. Ron, get Harry on his broom and go after Malfoy!"
His hand tightened on Draco’s, and he smiled when he felt the circle of warm platinum around his finger.
She sounded more like herself when she said it—mournful instead of enraged—and the eyes she turned on Harry were pleading.
“Was that a Patronus?!” Ron called. “Who…?”
"I'll be back soon, Draco."
He shrugged with elaborate unconcern, then slithered out from under the blankets to stand, stark naked, in front of Ron. The malicious twinkle in his eyes, as he sauntered to the end of the bed to flip open Harry's trunk, dared the Gryffindor to react.
“Tuck her inside your cloak… no, maybe your robe would be better. It wouldn’t do to drop her!”
Ron reached out to open the door, but a sharp, urgent cry halted his movement.
“Which you got.”
“Prince was Snape’s mother’s name,” Harry said with a shudder. “Don’t even go there.”
"A lot of them. The nice ones." Iffy didn't bother to explain what she meant by 'nice,' or how the not-so-nice ones talked about her and her parents. "I told you, I've lived there my whole life."
Harry nodded once and reached for the door latch. “Let’s do this, then.”
Draco opened his eyes again. He had to stay focused. In the present.
is he doing at the
He wasn’t asleep, however, and at the sound of the door opening, his head came up. He blinked myopically at the intruders, then sat up and fumbled on a table behind the bed for his glasses. Ron didn’t wait for him to bring them into focus, but promptly crossed to the bed, with Dumbledore behind him and Hermione lurking uncertainly in the doorway.
The vision in the mirror, all silver and gold in the lamplight, smiled back at him. “Not half as beautiful as you are.”
Those eyes that missed no detail and no chink in Draco’s armor flicked to the desk and the brightly-colored magazine lying on it. “You’re skulking in your room, looking like a derelict Muggle and leaving your mother to entertain our guests alone, so you can read sports magazines? Or are you… enjoying the pictures?”
"Yeh know, Harry," he commented, as he stirred his tea so energetically that it slopped across the tabletop, "if yeh keep hidin' yer boyfrien' from me, not bringin' him around with yeh, I migh' start ter think yeh're ashamed of him. Or of me."
Granger huffed and rolled her eyes at him, then she pulled an enormous sheaf of parchment covered with her crabbed writing toward her.
He bit into it, sending juice running down his chin, then swiped his tongue over Harry’s fingers to capture more of the sweetened cream. Harry laughed and popped the rest of the berry into his own mouth. Then he stooped to take Draco’s lips in a messy, juicy kiss.
“Not at all,” Harry replied easily. “We wouldn’t want to confuse Potters.”
“Nor have I,” Arthur agreed.
*** *** ***
Harry turned away from him without answering to fix his eyes on Robards. A tremor of pure rage went through him. Magic seethed beneath his skin, flared in his eyes and glowed golden around his hands. He unconsciously clenched his fists to hold it back, but a scroll on the Head Auror’s desk began to smoke. Neither man spared it a glance.
* * *
Harry let his head fall back and closed his eyes. “What a fucking nightmare.”
Harry’s brows flew up to his hairline. “Because if his father found out, he’d kill him. Not to mention what the rest of the Slytherins would do to him.”
Draco couldn’t answer. His mouth was too dry for speech. He couldn’t bury his hands in Potter’s hair, as he longed to do, and crush the other man’s mouth against his skin. All he could do was stand there. Waiting.
So Ron told them, as simply and honestly as he could. He told them about the freezing dungeon, the stone table, the terrible spell that stretched Draco on a rack for three days as it destroyed his body. He told them about his attempt to escape, using the severed hand, and how Narcissa had thwarted him. Then he described the hideous moment when Voldemort cut the baby from Draco’s body and put out his eyes to prevent him ever seeing her face.
Harry started toward Robards. His hands came up, fingers crooked into claws. “You
“That’s right.”
"How am I supposed to cast the counter-charm when I can't use magic?" she demanded crossly, her face flushed with annoyance.
“Really?” Harry turned around to confront him, all traces of a smile wiped from his face.
Harry’s hand petted his hair, then rested on his head. “Draco?”
“Fine, go on. You’ve always liked
"He's listening to him," Harry choked out. "He's actually
“And if she isn’t?”
"I don't think this is an appropriate conversation," Hermione said, severely.
Bob scrambled to his feet and pressed both hands against the invisible wall of magic that separated him from his father. He was crying steadily, his face already slick with tears and his nose running. Draco took one look at him and felt his heart contract in agony.
*** *** ***
Draco sighed and disentangled his hand from the quilts. “Okay.”
"Potter?" He reached blindly toward Harry, grabbing a fistful of his shirt.
The sheer number of bodies interposed between Molly and Draco would have protected him from her wrath, but in any case, she seemed to have suspended hostilities. She was tight-lipped and subdued but unfailingly polite to anyone who addressed her, and she listened with apparent interest to Audrey’s chatter about weddings and babies. Draco, on the other hand, talked quietly with Harry on one side and Bill Weasley on the other, while Hermione kept a protective eye on him from across the table. He ate far more than he wanted to—the food was excellent and more kept appearing—and drank nothing more potent than pumpkin juice. Until Arthur resumed his toasts, that is.
“Don’t move, Kreacher!” Draco called, instinctively reacting to shield the elf from the Aurors.
"He did want to find you, but he didn't know he was... welcome."
“You were out of your mind,” Harry whispered against his forehead, eyes clenched shut against sudden tears.
Draco hitched a sullen shoulder and shot another glare at him from beneath his lashes. “You blocked my magic, so you know how.”
“The day your master died?” Draco prompted, a bitter edge to his voice.
“Oaf!” she snapped.
He gave himself to Harry Potter.
She even seemed to respond to the name, skittering through the house on Bob’s heels, as he shrieked and giggled and wailed, “Oobleck,
Moody grunted wordless assent and clumped down the center aisle of the bus to a seat opposite Harry's. He had his wand in his hand and his magical eye still darting about in an unnerving way. Harry thought he seemed jumpier than usual, but it was very hard to tell with Professor Moody, since what he considered a normal state of vigilance another wizard would call raving paranoia.
“Perfect,” Draco declared.
It wasn't a question, but Draco answered anyway. "I'll stay."
Suddenly, her eyes snapped up to meet his. They were as wide as dinner plates and full of dawning understanding. “Harry, Imran Shafiq is an Unspeakable.”
on my childhood… if you could even call it that!”
“Think you can make this one stick?” Draco taunted gently.
At this small movement, pain and nausea wrenched at his innards, bringing his brain into unpleasant focus. He abruptly remembered what he’d been doing… yesterday? Was it only yesterday, or had he been asleep for a week, as his growling stomach and parched mouth seemed to suggest?
“And the rest of them?”
“I’m sure Cornelius had his suspicions,” Dumbledore said, with utmost innocence, “or else why hold this hearing?” His eyes slid over to the Minister, whose face was now deep purple. “No need to punish a dying man, after all.”
“Did I leave you in that brothel when I found out what you’d been doing all that time?”
“Fudge. Is he…?”
“Fuck… fuck, you’re beautiful…” Harry muttered between gasping breaths that shook his entire body. “I fucking love you like this…”
“What were you saying to Krum?” he asked, his eyes twinkling up at Draco. “He looked positively enthralled.”
Sodding Gryffindor. He was supposed to be the brave one. The hero. Why was he shaking?
*** *** ***
Harry dead on the grass.
She sighed. “Draco, I was cast out of my family when was barely of age because I chose to marry a Muggle-born wizard. I raised my daughter in a close, loving family, with the best of fathers, and gave her the values that carried her through her life and to her death—her brave, honorable death, fighting the Darkness. I have never regretted those choices or once wished that I had taken another path.
Harry shrugged. “He’s gone into hiding, is my guess. He panicked when he saw all those Aurors in the club and ran.”
Harry and Draco surrendered to the bizarre normalcy of the gesture, shrugging out of their heavy coats and handing them to the waiting elf. She took them with a bright smile, then trotted out of the room, leaving the two men alone with Narcissa.
“Seriously?”
“Mm,” Harry breathed against his neck.
“Good,” Snape said gruffly, as Draco downed the last of the potion. “Now tell me what in bleeding hell happened in here.”
"What?"
“Is that what you want? To keep the gift but erase the givers?”
“It wasn’t them! It
And then he felt the mouth.
“I grew up around villages just like this one. They’re not mysterious to me.”
Harry said nothing, only stared straight ahead and struggled to hold his face neutral. Draco slitted his eyes open to cast a sidelong glance at him. Neither moved for a long moment, then Draco closed his eyes again and resumed basking in the warm sunlight.
He scribbled a short note on the parchment, then tore off the excess and dropped it back in the trunk. Down the stairs and back through the common room he ran, nearly colliding with Lavender Brown, as she stepped through the portrait hole. Harry gasped a greeting and an apology in one breath, ducked through the hole, and was gone before Lavender could answer.
He pushed back his plate, his appetite abruptly gone, and said, “I don’t need to practice feeding my fingers to some carnivorous plant.”
“What’s the problem, mate?” Ron whispered from his other side, interrupting his train of thought.
“Of course. You can close your eyes, if you like. Just keep hold of my hand.”
Back in the kitchen, Harry guided Draco into a chair and stood over him, a hand on his shoulder to steady him. His angry gaze fell on Hermione, who had the good grace to look abashed.
,” he jerked his chin toward the bassinet, “into our home, just assuming that I’d smile and nod and accept it! That I’d give up without a fight!”
“Says the man who spends all day outside our wards, fighting Dark wizards and criminals…”
Malfoy turned abruptly, streaking toward Ron's end of the pitch at breathtaking speed. He looked as though he were about to crash into the goal hoops, but instead, he threaded an impossible path between them, then whipped up and around, flattened his body against his broomstick, and shot through the tallest ring.
“Shut it, Ron,” Harry ordered, his hands still clasping Draco’s head and his mouth only a finger’s breadth from the other man’s. Then, more privately, he said, “I know you didn’t mean it like that. And you know I never meant to take control of your life.”
Dumbledore sighed. “There’s a grain of truth in what you say. I do want Harry to fight, when the time comes. We all do. But he will fight Voldemort because he knows he must, not because I hold you hostage to force his hand. I also want you here for Harry. But only because I care for him very much, and I want to see him happy. He can’t be happy without you close to him. That’s a simple fact that has nothing to do with war and strategy and manipulation. It is only about love—the kind of love most people never experience, the kind of love only a fool would try to resist.”
“Phineas Boggs is on the front page.”
He found himself opening his eyes to check that Harry was still there, even when he had no strength to spare and no defense against the assault of light and vision. His head was crushed, his skull turned to pulp, agony leaking from its shattered remains to soak his pillow like blood. He couldn’t move without vomiting from the pain. He couldn’t focus his eyes on the face hovering beside him. But still he had to look, to reassure himself that his anchor was still there.
"Find out
“Is it what Greyback did to you? Did he hurt you so that you can’t… you’re afraid to…” Draco shuddered and tried to tear free of his hand, prompting Harry to pull him back into the curve of his arm. “You don’t ever have to be afraid of me. Or of telling me the truth.”
“No.”
what I've told the Headmaster, more than once…"
“…shouldn’t be allowed out in public…”
” Ernie chimed in.
Kneeling on the grass, Draco fixed earnest grey eyes on Harry's face and asked, "Have you ever wondered if maybe this whole thing is a mistake? You and me?"
"Dumbledore's looking for a blood donor."
"We found him in the Forbidden Forest. Cold as a stone, and wet through."
Neville had seen Draco at the club, so he knew why Harry had gone to ground, but what about the others? Seamus and Dean and Montague? Half the Aurors in his department? They had written off the mysterious Colin as a Malfoy lookalike, refusing to believe that he could be the real thing. Had they begun to suspect the truth? Had Neville’s Confundus charm worn off and let them remember Harry’s odd behavior? Had word got round that the supposed bridegroom had bought his way into Colin’s room, then apparated out of the club with him? And how had Nero reacted to the kidnapping of his star attraction?
“Yes. Please,” he whispered.
Kreacher got in before her, freezing Lissy with a snap of his fingers, then levitating her to a softer spot on the rug. The elf was still crouched, tensed, head angled to smash into the floor, but she could not move except to blink. Tears still ran in streams from her horror-filled eyes.
“All the boys did, even Sid, which surprised me. But you…” He touched her cheek, his eyes going misty. “You got Harry’s core.”
“We can’t keep this from Draco’s parents,” Dumbledore said. “I’ll notify them when Madam Pomfrey has finished her examination and we have more information.”
The equation vanished.
“But the new spell, with the Dark Lord’s vast power behind it, will form this child in just days—so quickly that even with the incredible drain on your body, you will survive long enough to see it born. Only the Dark Lord has the power to do it. And only you, Draco, can finish it.”
on me!”
Bob nodded, rubbing his egg-smeared cheek on Harry’s shirt. “You said he was tired.”
He bounded up the stairs, headed for the one room he knew had a working lock on the door because he’d just used it. The first floor loo. He was through the door, ready to slam it shut, when Ginny Weasley appeared at the top of the stairs.
There was no other word for the way he moved. Perfectly balanced, ankles rock-steady, elegantly muscled legs shifting inside those painted-on jeans, hips pushed forward and arse pulled in, taut and perfect. His ankles alone were enough to push Harry to the edge. He’d never known until that moment that ankles were, in fact, the most erotic part of the male body. At least, if they were Draco Malfoy’s ankles.
“Kreacher has always served his Family nobly and always will. No clothing forced upon him can make Kreacher stop.”
He only found out later, from Phineas’ servants, that bloodstains should be soaked in cold water. Too late to save the shirt.
” This last was dragged out of him when Harry wrenched the neck of his shirt wide and fastened his mouth on one nipple. His back arched, pushing him into his lover’s hot mouth, and Harry hummed his approval.
Harry felt another laugh rise in his throat at that, but he swallowed it before it could reach Draco's ears. His voice rough with threatened tears, he murmured, "I think you're a blithering idiot, and I love you for it. Oh God, Draco," his arms tightened around Draco's body, almost crushing him in his desperate relief, "I love you so much. I was so afraid I'd never get to do this again!"
"You're wearing me out."
Then it came to him in a flash – the one thing he could do, the one thing he could
His parents met this announcement with shocked silence, but Harry gave a shout of delight and swept Draco off his feet again to kiss him madly. When his mouth was free long enough for speech, Harry growled, “Let’s get home to our son!”
"I... I think you'd better go."
That had been… what? Two hours ago? Three? He could not tell for certain. It felt like an eternity, every minute another agonizing step closer to the loss of his child.
“Master Draco!” Kreacher shrieked.
Harry kept his arm firmly around Draco, in spite of the hisses and mutters he heard all around them, ignoring even Draco’s low-voiced protests, until they stepped into a lift. Then he put the other arm around him as well and pulled him against his chest.
“Okay. It’s going to be okay.”
Draco took one look and felt his innards twist with a painful combination of longing and panic.
"I thought the whole purpose of opening the school to students and their families for the summer was to keep Wizarding Britain's most valuable assets
"Like what?"
"Get back to your master, Lucius. I will send you an owl when we are ready."
When Malfoy was gone and Professor Sprout back among her Hufflepuffs, out of earshot, Harry dropped to a crouch next to Neville and bent over the book he had open on the ground. He pretended to read the instructions for determining which tendrils in a juvenile Devil’s Snare were overgrown and needed pruning. In reality, he wanted to talk to Neville without drawing the attention of his classmates.
Draco had feared the worst. But after Voldemort had tortured him in a lackadaisical sort of way, then let Nott have a go at him in front of a crowd of leering Death Eaters, Father had escorted him back to his own room with muttered instructions to stay there until called for. So here he was, staring out at the beautiful summer countryside, wondering when the other hobnailed boot would drop and on which part of his body it would land.
“Antimacassar. Honestly, Potter, were you raised in a barn?”
“Oh, yes. I miss it dreadfully sometimes.” Turning her slightly protuberant eyes on Draco, she said, “You look lovely tonight, Draco. Would you like some of my roses? They would go perfectly with your robes.”
Abandoning his last shreds of control, Harry slumped over to bury his face in Sirius shoulder and let go. It all came out of him in a flood of scalding tears - days of unending pain, fear and euphoria so intense that it shook him to the soul, sorrow for the dead children on the grass, regret for the years of hatred that seemed so hollow to him now, remorse for the terrible thing he had done to save the very person he had now lost, and a terrible grief for himself and for Draco.
He shrugged, his cheeks darkening in embarrassment. “I gave them some of my memories. Kingsley and I both did.”
be pleading his mother’s case to Draco. I came here to tell you that this insanity stops now. The next time Lucius and Narcissa come for Draco, they’ll have me to deal with, and I won’t be as kind as the Wizengamot. Azkaban will seem like a resort vacation compared to what I’ll do to them. And as for you…”
A few expert swirls of his tongue, a well-timed swallow, two fingers thrust into his slick opening at the perfect moment, and Harry was bucking up off the bed, fucking into his mouth, and keening his pleasure as he spurted down Draco’s throat. Draco swallowed the spunk easily—years of practice had its uses—and held him in his mouth until he began to soften. Then he pulled off, dropped a soft kiss on the inside of Harry’s thigh, and crawled up to cuddle against his shoulder.
He gave Harry a lopsided smile that warmed his dark, hollow eyes, and said, "Hallo, Harry."
That earned her another, more derisive snort.
“Er… How will I have time for classes, tutoring sessions and studying, if I’m in Professor Tidsworthy’s classes all day?”
“No.” His throat worked. “Nothing.”
Harry scrambled to his feet, warned by the note in Draco’s voice that his volatile husband was on the verge of losing his grip and he needed to get him away. Bending close to Felix, he murmured, “You can stay for pudding, if Ron and Hermione are willing to look after you.”
“Your pureblood prejudice is showing, Ron,” Hermione scolded.
, against him or Mr. Potter, unless or until one of them actually breaks a law. Do all of these things and there will be no open hostilities between us.
couldn’t protect him?”
She started toward the door, cradling the baby expertly in her arms and serenely untroubled by its furious wails. Motherhood seemed to have deadened her sense of hearing, because Harry found them almost unbearable. He was dancing from one foot to the other, unsure whether he wanted to grab the baby out of Hermione’s arms or make a dash for the door. Neither course of action was really feasible, so he shadowed her as she sailed down the hallway and into the kitchen. Then she turned and thrust the baby into his arms.
. I’ll provide instructions from the Wizengamot, as well.”
his sorry arse while he let that wanker destroy my husband!”
“They’re doing their Raised-by-Muggles thing again,” Draco growled. Turning a sour glare on Harry, he added, “Maybe his last name won’t
Remus clapped him on the shoulder. “You’ll see him through.”
“What were they doing at the club?” he finally asked, when he could master his voice.
“I don’t know, little man. He’s working.”
an ignorant pureblood ponce,” Harry pointed out (perfectly reasonably, he thought).
Narcissa was on her feet, eyeing his wand with a mixture of wariness and disdain. “You dare to threaten your own mother?”
“Physically, perhaps. But not magically, and as you are the eldest son, the legitimate heir, only a child of your body can inherit after you.”
Prewett drew in a tremendous breath, ready to cut loose again, but only got out, “I
His feet started moving without his conscious direction, and before he knew it, he was climbing the stairs. Again, he ached to carry Bob, but he knew he’d never make it up all those stairs with that much weight in his arms. So he climbed and climbed, Bob close on his heels and gulping down his sobs, until they reached the third floor and their bedrooms. He hesitated at the door to the master suite then, on impulse, turned for the nursery instead.
was first off the mark, with the entire front page dedicated to Harry’s trial and its many revelations. It gave short shrift to Harry’s acquittal, vouchsafing him only a few inches of copy halfway down the page, beneath a modest headline that read:
“Humm. You are here vith Potter.”
The look on Kingsley’s face told him that the Minister had been expecting that answer. “Let me ask.”
“Also, it’s the only thing I know how to make,” he added lamely.
Of course he’d fallen for the palest, snarkiest, most superior cat that ever deigned to tread the earth with its pristine paws.
Then, exactly on cue, a sleepy voice called, “Draco?” More rustling, and bare feet struck the floor. “Wait there. This room is a minefield.”
“I used to think it would be thrilling to watch Aurors take apart a witness. I never dreamed that I would be the witness, or that an interrogation would be so uncomfortable.”
Cold fury swept through Harry, making the power radiating from him spark blue. “If you ever touch Draco again, I’ll kill you.”
“Because I’m not allowed on the island, either. Not ’til I prove that Draco didn’t do the things they’re accusing him of. But I will. I
“I took a walk through the village.”
"I do trust you."
Draco had been dropping random remarks that made sense only in his lust- and fever-addled brain for some time. He didn’t seem to need a meaningful response, just a reminder that Harry was there.
“You broke his heart!” Molly railed. “And don’t tell me again how it was a mutual decision, because I’m not blind or stupid! I see how you behave, Ginevra, and I say it’s no wonder that a good, kind, honest boy like Harry wouldn’t tolerate it!”
“Did you sing that at the club?” Harry finally asked.
“I expect it does.” Harry turned back to him with a smile. “You’re safe enough here, as long as you stay inside the wards where no one can see you, and at least we know there are no Squibs hiding in the basement. But what are you doing with all this old junk?”
Probably another of his foul hearings. But I’m telling you, Ron, if I have to sit there and listen to Dolores Umbridge telling her sickly-sweet lies, I’m going to lose it and hex her!” He stomped up another few stairs and growled, his voice hard with determination and a touch of bravado, “I beat Voldemort, and now they expect me to cow-tow to Cornelius Fudge? Well, it’s not going to happen!”
"Of course I do, but not with that weasel around!"
Harry subsided into his chair, gnawing his lip in frustration. He was sick of this endless, circular conversation that never seemed to accomplish anything. They had been staring at that map for four agonizing days and had no more idea where to find his friends today than they had the night they disappeared. All the people he loved most in this world were in Voldemort’s hands, and the best he could do for them was to sit in Dumbledore’s office, staring at a map, arguing about the Dark Lord’s peculiar vanities.
He lifted a brow at her and waited. Whatever she knew that they didn’t would come out eventually. It always did. Usually in a flood of unwanted detail and insufferable superiority.
The Headmaster gazed down at it, his features etched in lines of sadness. After a long moment, he freed one hand from the wrappings to touch the piece of magical sculpture he held, sliding his fingers over the flawless surface in a kind of caress, then he curved them around the wrist and lifted it from its wrappings.
“Family name.”
"I don't serve Harry."
"Good. I know it feels as if you could keep this up forever, but the euphoria that comes with using your power will not help you to replace it when you have burned yourself out. You must rest twice as much, because you are working twice as hard."
“Just having a look.”
“What in bleeding hell is
grouchy," Harry agreed, solemnly.
“If you’re really sorry, you’ll go back to lecturing me on International Wizarding Law and stop wailing in that nauseating fashion.”
“Thank you for coming today, Draco. After the way I treated you at Christmas, I wouldn’t blame you if you never set foot in my house again.”
“And you were doing so well!” Draco mocked, tilting his head away from Harry’s lips and laughing up at him with gleaming eyes. “Can we go home now?”
“I know that I never want to be apart from you, that I feel like half a person when I am. I know I… I have belonged with you since the first moment I laid eyes on you in that robe shop in Diagon Alley. I know that the thought of living without you tears…” He broke off to take a sobbing breath. “…tears at me like claws in my flesh…”
Madam Bones raised her eyebrows at that. "You witnessed, er, 'Dumbledore's sorcery and Potter's seduction' there in your foyer?"
In answer, Harry turned on the spot and apparated them away, tearing through the Burrow’s wards like they did not exist.
“Can’t,” he choked out, gagging on another heave of his stomach at the very thought of putting anything in it.
“Don’t do that! Don’t treat me like a blithering idiot!”
So Draco told him everything.
“And how is she supposed to know that, seeing as how you haven’t spoken to her since the Christmas Eve Debacle? Even Malfoy made it over to the Burrow for tea, but not you, her favorite son.”
"How d'you know Malfoy did it? You're standing there, holding the thing, couldn't
Stan gaped at Remus, his mouth opening and closing like beached fish, then sucked in his breath and declared, "I soddin' well won't!"
He was scowling at the floor, wishing that the crowd above would just fuck off so he could leave, when he heard a familiar voice call, “Harry?”
Fingers brushed his jaw, sliding into his hair. Draco closed his eyes and muttered, "You're breaking your promise."
With a silent surge of magic, Harry slammed the door in his colleagues’ collective faces and added a Muting charm for good measure.
“We had to do
"I invited you in, didn't I? And I welcomed you as graciously as I knew how, when you boys arrived."
“I’m sure she would be, if she could,” Molly said soothingly. “Even a woman as cold as Narcissa Malfoy wouldn’t abandon her son at a time like this.”
“Yeah… maybe. Theo—Theodora Fox—fancies my mum. I think Adelaide is more curious about my dad. All of them stare at me like I’m one of Hagrid’s dangerous creatures, and I’ll explode at any minute.”
“I’ve been thinking…” Draco mused.
“Merlin. How much plum cake did he have?” Draco muttered, even as Bob burst into the room.
"Oh, Harry..."
Harry snorted as he struggled with the clasp on his cloak. “I’ll be fine. I’ll be with Dumbledore. But Draco still needs to know, and I need to be sure he’s safe.”
“Just hang in there, Mr. Potter.” Trevor clasped his shoulder for a moment, then turned back to the wide doorway. “Go sit down. Try not to worry. You got him here in time.”
have used it as a wand and killed that old bug… uh, Lucius?"
“You can’t go,” Harry suddenly declared. He made it sound so simple and so reasonable—a fact not to be disputed—but Draco knew better.
He loved her. He always would. And he would always be vulnerable to her machinations, to some extent, even though he saw through them more clearly than most. He let her twist him round her finger because he loved her and because it gave her the illusion that the beloved boy she had doted on for so many years still existed. Was still
“Who cares? We already know they’re barmy.”
,” Pomfrey breathed.
“Stay right there.”
Instead, he cleared his throat and said, in as light a tone as he could muster, “Stop playing possum, Malfoy. I know you’re awake.”
“Reporter. Photographer. Celebrity hound. General irritant. Does it matter? I hope she gets frostbite.”
It was beautiful. The most beautiful thing Harry had ever seen. Draco Potter coming undone on his cock, lost to everything but his need for everything Harry had to give.
was) when he did this, but Draco refused to let anything dampen his spirits. Even the inane observations of his prat of a fiancé. So, in defiance of Potter, he burst out in song and conjured up yet another square of filthy, smelly, sick-making fabric to scour clean.
"Oh." Draco flicked his adamant fingers over the book and the droning voice cut off in mid word. He yawned, rubbed his eyes, and leaned back in his chair.
“Fuck,” Ron breathed at the same time. “Fucking Azkaban.”
They weren't exactly healing or comforting thoughts, but they were the best Harry could do on short notice. As much as he wanted to help Malfoy, Harry found it difficult to look at his familiar face - a face he had viewed with hostility and loathing for six long years - and think of anything reassuring to say.
“Of course. Get up, love. Stand over there where I can see you properly.” he pointed to the hearthrug.
Draco had always adored Harry’s body. He never remembered a time when he didn’t want to touch it, explore it, enjoy it, pleasure it. Even as a child, when he had no idea what to do with another boy in his bed, he had seen those bony wrists poking out of Harry’s wide, black sleeves and longed to touch them. Fondle them. Press his lips to the blue veins pulsing beneath his sickly-pale skin. He had burned at the thought, flushed with shame and hot with desire.
"Make up your mind, Potter."
Pompous shut the door and leaned against it, arms crossed. Nasty approached the table with a thick folder in his hand. He slapped it down on the metal surface and assumed what he obviously thought was a casual, nonthreatening posture. It wasn’t. Draco read hostility and coiled violence in every line of his body.
A king decides that he’s bored with the weather and orders his magicians to conjure something new for him. The ‘something new’ they come up with is oobleck, a thick green glop that falls from the sky in enormous drops. It quickly brings the kingdom to a screeching halt, burying everything and everyone. The king’s page, Bartholomew, has to convince the king that he’s been foolish to tamper with the weather and find a way to save the kingdom. Which he ultimately does, of course.
Draco relaxed a bit more, hazarded a half smile. "I heard the camera."
The weedy guard put his flask to Draco’s lips, while the other wrenched his head back by the hair. Draco drank the water that poured into his mouth. It hurt to swallow, hurt to feel anything in his stomach, hurt to think that a mouthful of water would keep him alive for another day when he wanted so desperately to die, even if it meant being with his fucking father. But he drank without protest because he had no protest, no resistance, no volition left in him.
about disobeying me!"
Instead of answering him, she spoke to one of her companions. "That hand acts as wand. If he opens his mouth again, stun him."
“We’re married,” Draco went on, ignoring the interruption. He lifted his left hand to show his ring. “That gives you the right to do anything you like to me.”
"Why did you do it?" Draco asked, harshly.
"It's for the best, Harry..." His furious glare made her swallow her words and brought a defiant sparkle to her eyes. "I'm sorry if it hurts you, but that's what I think," she said, stubbornly.
Harry smirked. “You just did.”
"More like a snake under a rock," Harry retorted, thinking of his beloved boa constrictor and the many nights he had spent pirating the heat from Harry's body.
“We can’t leave, yet. Harry needs to talk to you.”
Staggering to his feet, Ron threw himself at the wall again, shouting at the top of his lungs, “
"Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?"
“They’ll thank me, once they get there. Especially Wart. He has no idea what he’s in for.”
Scrunching down still farther on the old settee, he turned his eyes on the tree. Some of the magical ornaments woke and began to move for him. The constellations in their glass balls twinkled merrily. A spangled broomstick trailing a green and silver ribbon zoomed happily around one branch. A delicate structure of golden wires and glittering mist hovered just above another branch and spun fascinatingly, like a kind of festive time-turner. It was all lovely. Mesmerizing. And it helped ease the panic fluttering in Draco’s chest.
“Yeah. Whatever.”
"You have not won this battle, Dumbledore."
Harry just laughed at that, not rising to the bait. He was still too wrung out for any demonstrations of power or battles for dominance. He couldn’t resist the lure of Draco’s taunting voice, his heady scent, or his perfect arse, but now that he was inside it, all he really wanted was to savor the feel of his husband all around him.
“I didn’t think it would be like that.”
“It’s all right, Lissy, I’m fine,” Narcissa assured her, surfacing from the folds of her handkerchief with her face largely repaired.
“Oh, Merlin
“I don’t know… he’s got a lot of sugar in him. He ate three scones and an entire pot of jam.”
“Shh.”
Felix gave Tio a nudge with his elbow. “I remember Papa threatening to murder Dad and dump his body in the Thames if he named you Amortentius.”
it to Bellatrix, he said, “Destroy it.”
Content. That was how he felt. Content and happy. Words he couldn’t remember using in… a lifetime.
Duckworth looked faintly uncomfortable at that. “We do have a few people who claim that sexual intercourse took place…”
It took him a very long time to fall asleep.
"Here we go again," Harry sighed. "Ron, I understand. Don't strain something trying to say it out loud."
“His name is Abraxas,” Harry said severely, a faint flush staining his cheeks.
“What? No!” Snatching his hands away, Draco blushed a fiery red and looked around for an avenue of escape. “Get up, you sodding idiot!”
“I put you in Fred and George’s room. It’s comfortable enough, if you watch out for the joke wands and exploding sweets. Hurry along, now, before Harry gets restless and comes looking for you.”
Harry felt a terrible urge to go to Draco, to put his arms around him and tell him it wasn't worth the effort to talk to this horrible man, because the people who
Dumbledore blinked at him in patent disbelief. "Arthur?"
“Yeah, good, toss it here.”
“We’re not, Myrtle, honestly. It’s just…” Draco could almost feel Harry weighing his options, trying to decide how best to tip the scales in their favor, “…if anyone finds out about me and Draco, he’ll be in danger. They’ll want to punish him for daring to be with me.”
Harry stood in a group of old friends, Felix perched in his arms, pretending to chat, but most of his attention was on the dance floor. Draco was out there with McGonagall, showing off his perfect sense of timing, dazzling the onlookers with his infinite grace. Or dazzling Harry, anyway, who had no sense of timing and all the grace of a three-legged Erumpent on the dance floor. Harry was grateful to have Felix as an excuse not to dance, but he hated sharing Draco. With anyone.
Draco’s only answer was a soft whimper of longing, as Harry deepened the kiss once more. He began to rock his hips, seeking friction, and this time there was only lace between him and the rough fabric of Harry’s jeans. Pleasure jolted through him. His prick thrust above the top of his pants and pumped wetness onto his belly. He moaned into the other man’s mouth and rutted shamelessly against him. Then he felt Potter’s hands slip around the curve of his arse, into his pants, to clasp his buttocks.
“Not today, but he tried to speak to me at your hearing. And he sent me a letter.”
He tactfully ignored the audience’s collective flinch at the sound of Voldemort’s name.
Draco unconsciously tugged at the sleeve hanging down over his palm. “I was cold this morning.”
Draco let go of Harry and stepped back, his scowl still firmly in place but his annoyance shading into curiosity. If Harry did not know what was in the box, then it really was a surprise, and Draco
"What?"
“Which was?”
"I sent Snape? What are you talking about?"
“About what?”
“Calm down…”
Harry enjoyed being right (well, honestly, who doesn’t?), but he enjoyed even more those moments when his stubborn git of a husband had to
*** *** ***
When he finally drifted back into the present, Draco found himself lying face-to-face with Harry, their limbs tangled together, their lips just touching, various fluids cooling uncomfortably on their skin. He sighed and closed the last distance between their mouths. Harry hummed his pleasure, angled his head, slid his tongue into Draco’s mouth.
* * *
"Tied him up very neatly, thank you, so he can't run headlong into trouble."
Harry yawned, cutting off their argument. "It's just a stupid dance, not worth all the time you spend wondering about it." Ron snorted with laughter, and Harry shot him a grin. "Remember how awful the last one was?"
“Hmm.”
Draco opened his mouth, shut it, then blurted out, "Professor Snape!"
He lifted his head to gift Harry with a provocative grin. “You’ll get no complaints from me.”
“I love you, too.”
“Did the Accused file any of the necessary reports, informing the DMLE or the Wizengamot that he’d made an arrest? Did he request a barrister for Draco?”
Harry halted in front of the hospital wing door and turned to face Dumbledore. "Then isn't it possible that she
Then, as Ron and Hermione watched in open-mouthed amazement, golden wizarding power began to dance across the planes of Harry’s face. It brightened, spread, flowed over the boy standing so close in his arms, and Draco seemed to melt into Harry’s body. At the same time, silver threads appeared among the gold, thickening the net of power that entwined them.
He answered immediately, the words coming to him without thought. “You love me.”
“Perish the thought. Now shut it and drink.”
“Yeah.” Bundling the loose robes around Draco’s naked body, Harry cradled it in his arms and cast a charm to lighten it. Then he climbed to his feet. “I need the warrant to get through the wards.”
Thankfully, she still had her wand in her hand. Pushing herself upright, she swept it around the room, calling, "
Harry oversteps his bounds and reveals something unexpected about Draco's adamant hand.
With a sweep of his hand, Voldemort summoned the Dementor that stood to his left. The creature drifted slowly toward them, its face still concealed in its hood, and Lucius drew back to give it room. It halted slightly directly in front of Draco, its robe brushing the altar.
works?”
Once again, Draco came to an abrupt halt. The entire crowd, startled by the unexpected magic, broke off their chattering and turned to stare. Harry’s hand closed on Draco’s arm, and his voice whispered in his ear,
“Thank you.”
“That depends on what your plan entails.”
"A wizard could get strange diseases that way."
“Not unless she does something stupid.”
Pushing her unceremoniously aside, he snarled, “Don’t tell me what—” only to be cut off when he walked stomach-first into a powerful Shield charm. It tossed him back a step, nearly dumping him on the floor. Andromeda’s hand on his arm steadied him, but he was in no mood to appreciate her assistance.
“You’re a lousy drunk, Pans,” he growled.
At the sound of her voice, Draco recoiled as though he'd been struck with a lash. "No!" he choked, turning to look at his father's rigid profile. "You can't!" Lucius gave no sign that he heard, continuing to stare intently at the scene by the altar.
“Bad cat!” he said sternly to Oobleck, while the kitten gazed hungrily at the duckling in his hands.
Harry had gone to ground with Malfoy, he was sure. Knowing Harry, they would be protected behind wards and spells that no Auror could possibly breach. That was reassuring because it meant Malfoy was safe, but it made finding them a challenge.
A whisper of panic stirred inside him. "How can I use my hand, if I can't feel anything with it?"
“I told you,” Draco shot at Harry. “Even Weasel knows what they are, and he was raised in a chicken coop.”
He knew this dream.
“I know, and I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have taken the mickey like that.” Harry hesitated, then added, “Only, you never seem particularly shy about your body…”
“Shh. Lucius isn’t taking anything.”
Dead silence answered him. Then Dolores Umbridge stirred and cleared her throat in her provoking way. “It sounds to me as if you are, once again, overstepping your bounds.”
He’d never been in a Muggle tea shop before. He ought to have felt uncomfortable, but oddly enough, he didn’t. With its lace-draped tables, warm lights in glass bowls and cheerful fire, it reminded him of his mother’s drawing room at the Manor. Old fashioned without being stodgy. Feminine without being fussy. Even the paintings hung around the walls made him smile. They were renderings of the Cotswolds in Summer—enthusiastic, colorful and utterly inept—that looked remarkably like the paintings he’d done as a child when he briefly fancied himself a Great Artist. Needless to say, he wasn’t.
Ron ran full tilt through the dungeons, still crying though he didn’t know why. He had not marked his path and urgency made him frantic, so he took more than one wrong turn and was sobbing in frustration by the time he reached a hallway he recognized. It was the one with the entrance to the Slytherin common room—not where he wanted to be but at least he wasn’t lost. He spun around and started back the way he’d come.
He was deeply frustrated that he’d missed the chance to be with his mother, to talk to her about the things she had seen in Phineas Boggs’ mind, to reassure her that he was moving past it. Healing. Learning to live with the pain. She had to know that he was not that broken boy anymore. That he didn’t need her suffering to make it right.
get mad, but not at you, and I won’t blow things up or set the bed on fire.”
Harry shook his head.
Finally, the healer backed away from the bed and Harry approached, a squirming Bob in his arms.
“What…” He broke off to clear his throat, then tried again. “What was he up to?”
Draco lay curled close to Harry’s side, head tucked into the hollow of his shoulder, body heavy with sleep. A lock of white-blond hair had slipped loose from its queue to fall across his cheek. Harry caught it with a fingertip and tucked it gently behind his ear. At his touch, Draco stirred, tightening his hold on the body supporting his and slotting his leg comfortably between Harry’s.
“Not remotely.” Draco smirked at her. “But you’ll have to admit that she has a way with words.”
do it again. He has all of your monumental stubbornness and fierce, if often misguided, loyalty. Now that he has made his choice and given that loyalty to our cause, he will fight Voldemort with all of the passion and brilliance that are his birthright."
Azkaban.
"Oh." Theodora's face turned thoughtful, and her cat's eyes dwelt on Iffy. "I suppose that's all right, then."
Phineas perked up visibly, even going so far as to open his eyes wide and straighten up in his frame, smoothing his green and silver robes with one spidery hand.
Harry’s frown deepened. “You’ve been off all day. You wouldn’t go to Madam Pomfrey with that burn…”
did? Are you
"Were you... were you talking about all of it?"
The nurse shook her head, her lips pursed in a way that Harry would once have interpreted as disapproval but now recognized as distress. "We mustn't interfere with Madam Fox. She's the only one who can help Malfoy, now." The trouble in her face deepened, making her look even more prunish, and she turned away to twitch Draco's blankets into a more perfect state of neatness, muttering, "To think I'd live to see this kind of thing again… spell-shocked students, Wizengamot trials, Unforgivable Curses…"
“I want my husband to take me home.”
"I know." The smirk vanished, to be replaced by one of Harry's glowing looks. "And I appreciate it."
Draco countered with, “Severus.”
“I don’t know that I can.” He lifted and turned his blackened hand, gazing at it in bemusement. “Or that I’ll have the time.”
“Please, Harry,” he croaked, a touch of desperation in his voice.
Snape nodded, reluctantly, his eyes still avoiding Dumbledore's. "What will you do about Malfoy's hand?"
Turning to Hagrid, he said, "The human lies in the clearing, just beyond this screen of branches. Take him and go. Do not linger in the clearing, and do not stop until you have left the forest."
“Home?” Her brows flew up. “To your cottage?”
“Harry is not equipped to deal with that precious pair,” he said firmly. “He’s much too direct and noble. I, on the other hand, am neither. I’m still a Malfoy under the skin, and who better to take on a pair of Malfoys than one of their own kind?”
Draco’s smile widened and softened, even as his legs tightened around Harry’s waist. “Just for fun, then?”
Draco tore away from both of them, then staggered when he found his legs too weak to hold him up. "They took her! They…
“I’m afraid this is the last straw,” the old wizard said bluntly. He drew himself up to his full, commanding height, and fury seemed to roll off of him like smoke. “You will not speak to Draco Malfoy. You will not examine him. You will not subject him to one more indignity in the name of truth or justice or whatever other lie you choose to tell yourselves. He is under my protection, as is his daughter, and will not allow you to hurt him again. Do I make myself perfectly clear?”
“Not yet,” Draco replied quietly. “First he’s in love with Rosalind.”
“Sit down, Mr. Bloodworth.”
Nothing.
“Malaise?
“Ferret?” Ron paused, looking expectant, then murmured, “Does this have something to do with what Warwick said in the interrogation room? About you and Boggs? Because, one, I’d believe you over that prick Warwick any day, and if you tell me he’s wrong, then he’s fucking wrong. And two, it’s none of my bloody business who you were shagging when you and Harry weren’t together, so as long as Harry doesn’t care, then neither do I. And three, I know for a fact you didn’t
“You really want to let them loose on Andromeda?”
“Mr. Potter and I were discussing where to look.”
He bent his head to bury his face in Draco’s neck, where his plait fell over his shoulder. The hair was soft and smooth under his cheek, perfumed by the wilting flowers still stuck in it, and the skin of his throat like silk against his lips.
“That’s just cruel!” Harry groaned.
“You’ll have to step back, now. We need to turn him over.”
Ron said, with a touch of impatience in his voice, "Thanks to you, he's alive and back at Hogwarts, instead of losing the rest of his mind in Azkaban. Are you going to start in again with that rubbish about You-Know-Who only torturing Malfoy to hurt you?"
Harry took care of him. Harry rubbed his aching feet, brought him tea and toast in bed, stood with him in the shower to soap his body clean, painted colorful streaks in his hair to sweeten his sour moods, kissed the pout from his lips, and fucked him up against the wall every chance he got. Harry poured love and magic into him without stinting, taking away the pain and filling him with enough power to make a hundred babies.
“Since the last time we set foot out the door, someone tried to kidnap Felix and put Draco in hospital, you’ll excuse me if we aren’t itching to try again!” Harry protested.
Sirius backed off and stared at him, dumbstruck, until another voice broke in on them.
The usual crowd of worried teachers were collected around the bed, with the vital addition of Madam Fox. Harry knelt on the cold marble beside it, one hand resting on Draco’s head and the other clasping his still fingers, wizarding power dancing before his eyes, obscuring his view of the pale face lying so close to his. But he didn’t need to see Draco’s face to know how close he was to death. The moment they reached the hospital wing, Professor Dumbledore had formed another Blood Link, allowing Harry to pour into Draco some part of their shared power. Now Harry was watching everything the healers did through the link, watching the empty body in the bed fade inexorably away.
*** *** ***
Dumbledore did not have to raise his voice. It easily filled the chamber, and everyone fell instantly quiet to hear him. “This morning, while we were attending his kangaroo court, he sent Dolores Umbridge to Hogwarts to kidnap an infant.”
Malfoy reached into his robe and withdrew a slim, razor-edged knife, its haft worked in different colors of gold and carved into intricate shapes, set with flashing gems. He offered it to Dumbledore across his forearm. The old wizard took the dagger, and Malfoy pulled the black, leather glove from his right hand. Then he extended his bare palm.
“He understands, don’t you, Felix? You remember how to behave with Papa?”
, and I will be happy to show you exactly what I
“Hmm,” was Draco’s noncommittal reply. Then, in obvious irritation, “Fuck. What a mess!”
“If Harry Potter is knowing where Master Draco is, why is he not bringing him home?”
A ghost of a smile flickered across Draco's face. "Not unless you want me to."
“Sorry (again, an obvious lie), there’s no smoking allowed in here.”
Philippe sat down on the bench and tugged on Draco’s hand, pulling him down to sit on his lap. They were virtually the same height, but the Ravenclaw was broader and sturdier, giving the impression of greater size. Not that it would have mattered to Draco if the other boy were six inches shorter than he was. He wanted to sit on his lap and loop an arm around his neck. He wanted to gaze down into his swimming, brown eyes. He wanted to be cradled in his arms and lean into his body.
"How about that nice sofa over there? Or the armchair? Or the table?" Draco pressed his crotch more tightly to Harry's thigh, letting him feel the full length and heat of his erection. "Or right here would be good."
“What are you doing?”
“We made Tio save you some blueberries!”
as they say.”
“She won’t like the Slytherin dungeon.”
“Someplace warm,” Draco answered promptly. Then, after a moment’s thought, “I’d like to lie on a white-sand beach—it doesn’t matter where—and let the sun cook the cold out of my bones.”
* * *
Once Snape had moved on, Ron tried to stop them, to ask Harry what was up, but Harry didn't hang around long enough to explain. He knew what Snape wanted, and he knew why both he and Hermione had been selected. The strongest and the most well-trained. He felt the knot form in his stomach again and wished he'd had time to get Hermione's take on all of this.
Harry, bless him, stayed at his side and didn’t ask for explanations, didn’t even ask him to open his eyes. He just sat and held Draco’s hand, and when Draco
“What do you… w-want me to s…”
“Does she know who you really are?”
“Goyle?” Draco frowned. “What could they learn from Goyle?”
They agreed to meet Narcissa at the church where her husband’s ashes lay, apparating from Gloucestershire to Bayonne, then to a deserted lane on the outskirts of the tiny mountain village. They held hands as they walked, silent with nerves, up the frozen lane in the grey light of a Winter afternoon. Snow crunched beneath their boots and mist plumed from their mouths with every breath. It was late December in the Pyrenees and bloody cold.
, and Harry would see him. Touch him. Kiss him. Hold him.
Back to all those old friends.
Maybe that wasn’t entirely a lie. Maybe Nott had fucked him to gain an advantage over his father and hadn’t enjoyed it at all.
"It must stay close to Mr. Malfoy, so I suggest that Mr. Potter take charge of it." As he spoke, Dumbledore smiled at Harry and held out the bag to him. Harry paled and drew away from it, eyeing it in horror. "Don't be afraid, Harry. It's quite harmless, as long as you don't touch it with your bare skin."
He started to read, but he had not made it through the first paragraph when fury rose in him in a hot, red tide, blurring his vision and almost obscuring the hateful words on the page. Lifting his fulminating glare to Draco, he demanded, “Are they serious? They’re taking the Manor?”
"Dragon eggs?" Draco echoed, confused.
Kingsley held Harry’s gaze for another beat, reading the depths of his determination, then he quirked a smile and said, in his deep, rich voice, “We are re-opening the case against Draco Malfoy.”
“He does that,” Draco mumbled, his eyes growing heavy and his chest aching with Bob’s absence. “Impressive spells.”
Pulling her dignity about her like a cloak, Molly rose to her feet and turned to look down her nose at Dumbledore – just like Narcissa in a snit, Minerva reflected. It must be the Black Blood showing. "I want to see Harry. I assume he's in the hospital wing?"
Thanks to Madam Pomfrey, he wasn’t bleeding when he arrived home at the end of his long, exhausting and frustrating day, but he was still scowling. Harry and Bob met him as he came out of the floo, grinning and laughing at some shared joke, then both wrapped him in their loving arms. Draco suffered their embraces, but even his son’s angelic little face could not reconcile him to his humiliating failure.
Draco touched his face with adamant fingertips, finding his mouth and drawing it down to meet his own. “Do it,” he breathed, as their lips met again.
The next time he awoke, it was to the soft murmur of voices. He drifted slowly up out of the darkness, untroubled by ugly dreams or pricks of fear, wrapped in warmth and contentment and a deep feeling of security.
Alarm made his pulse jump. Shutting off the water, he wiped his hands dry on the towel, wiping off a good bit of the dirt with the water. The voices were growing louder, Kreacher’s sounding upset, and Draco turned hastily for the door.
“Yes, it’s much trickier than you might think because he’s the last of the Malfoy and Black bloodlines—if you discount Teddy, which of course we must, unfortunately—but according to a Roman Warlock called Venerius, it was done quite a lot in the Old Republic. He even documents the ritual! Right here!”
Draco cast him a provocative look from beneath his lashes and smirked. “It’s my Moonstone bracelet calling to your inner goddess.”
“Oh, let’s see… maybe because my parents are desperate. And completely without morals. And absolutely determined to get what they want. And you are the only thing standing in their way?” Again, his impossible husband just blinked at him. “Think about it, Harry. They’ve tried everything they can think of to reach me directly, and they’ve failed. Why?”
Kingsley looked up from the scroll. His face looked faintly green beneath the dark brown of his skin. “That would be my pleasure.”
“I don’t want tea. I ate too much at the party.” Sliding down off the high sofa, he planted a kiss on Draco’s cheek, then said, in the faintly dreamy way that told Draco he was retreating into his own head again, “I’ll go read to Codswallop. I’m teaching him Latin so he we can make up spells together, when I’m old enough for a wand.”
“I don’t think so. You’re looking decidedly peaky, as Molly would say. And speaking of Molly, where is she?”
But it was another voice entirely that spoke to him, shattering the charged atmosphere.
“This is your last chance, Malfoy,” he snared, face contorted in rage and pain. “If you stay with that imbecile, you’ll die! If you want to live, you’ll
"You knew me when you woke up. I saw it in your face. You remembered about us, about the warming spells and sleeping together, and you asked for me. So you know me, Malfoy, and you aren't afraid of me. You just have to wake up and remember. Don't go back to that other place."
Harry moved up behind him and stroked a hand over his hair. “What are you going for?”
prints about me.”
“So this is about doing your duty? It has nothing to do with your husband, Draco Malfoy, and what you allege Warwick did to him?”
Then, to his own amazement, Harry laughed. It wasn't much of a laugh, more of a croak really, but it loosened the hold of the fist around his heart and allowed him to take a deep, painless breath. "Neither can I."
He rocked his hips, rubbing their swollen cocks together and relishing the way Draco’s face heated. “Fuck, I missed you.”
Harry stumbled as he walked, his legs suddenly too weak to hold his weight, and McGonagall caught his arm to steady him. "I thought you were going to tell me he was..."
“Nothing.” Harry sniffed and pulled slightly away. Glowing green eyes turned up to meet Draco’s concerned grey ones. “I’m just so happy it hurts.” Draco smiled and another shaft of pain went through Harry’s body. “Can I give you your present, now?”
Confused and faintly worried, though he couldn’t say why, Harry bounded down another flight of stairs and raced along the corridor to arrive, red-faced and panting, at the bathroom door. It was shut but not locked. Another glance at the map told Harry that Draco was still inside with Myrtle, so he stuffed the map into his pocket and pushed the door open.
“No. I didn’t dare perform magic with a stolen wand, so I used it to open the wall and tossed it back into the yard where someone would find it. Then I crept into my hole to die, only Nero found me first.
As the young healer disappeared back into the controlled chaos of the emergency room, Harry let his legs collapse and his body slide down to sit on the floor, huddled at the base of the wall. His eyes fixed unwaveringly on the bright room beyond the doorway. The room where Draco lay and Harry was not allowed to go.
Like this?”
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked the cat. “Not up to your standard?”
“Will you share it with me? Lie beside me, hold my hand and say idiotic things to make me laugh?”
* * *
“These things take finesse, and you just went at him like a crazed Erumpent!”
“Just a bit paranoid, aren’t you, Potter?” Draco asked, as he set down his teacup and drifted closer to the table in Harry’s wake.
Now, with the evening well advanced, Lily asleep, and the music of the Yule Ball drifting up to them from the Hall below, Draco’s mood had gone from somber to sullen, and Harry was running out of ways to distract him.
The man did not so much as twitch, but Ron accepted his silence as confirmation. To Duckworth and his companion, he said, “Go have a chat with the bartender in room three, and I’ll let you know when I’m done here.”
“The only specific example my mother could give is that the magic in this house responds to me, even though Harry legally owns it,” Draco added.
He had a sudden, agonizing vision of himself lying on the top bunk in his tent that smelled of cats, Ron snoring below him, staring up at the canvas and thinking of Draco. Dreaming of him. Aching for him. Fighting the urge to leap down from the bed, run from the tent, apparate straight to Malfoy Manor and beat down the doors to reach him. He’d not done it, of course. He’d stayed in his bunk, shut his eyes, wrapped his arms around himself and tried not to weep at the picture that formed behind his eyelids—Draco in the Prefect’s bathroom, sitting astride his lap, coming undone on his cock, his face so soft and beautiful in that moment that it tore Harry’s heart in two.
"Famous for what?" Theodora asked.
“Mr. Malfoy is hardly in a position to make demands…”
“What, you thought this was it? A drink at the Leaky Cauldron? Don’t be daft! We’re going to send you out in style, boyo!”
The headlines started appearing the next day. Not surprisingly, the
“None of that, either,” Harry chided. He held out a handkerchief. “Here. Blow your nose.”
“Yeah.” He bent his head—less than before; Draco had grown a few inches over the summer—and touched his mouth to the other boy’s. “So… are you going to hex me?”
“Better but sleepy. I think Madam Pomfrey spiked my potion.”
He answered immediately, the words coming to him without thought. “You love me.”
on them qualify as
“Blissed out of our minds and bloody useless?”
“I’m sure.” Draco headed for the door, Harry trailing after him. “You have the manners of a drunken goblin and self control of a Veela in heat, Potter.”
Harry grinned at her use of his title. Awkward as it was to question a member of his family this way, her stiffness and hostility put him on familiar ground. Allowed him to react like an Auror, instead of a chastened boy.
Fudge's eyes narrowed. "No one outside the St. Mungo's staff will be allowed to visit the prisoner."
Draco shrugged again. "We'll see."
“I know
“I know. After this bloody potion wears off.”
To Harry’s surprise, the question did not come from Ginny, but from Seamus. He sat on Dean’s other side and had kept his gaze firmly on his plate since Malfoy had crept into the conversation. His voice sounded stiff, but there was no hostility in it, and it took Harry only a split second to decide that the question was meant as a peace offering.
Wearing a look of bafflement, Harry accepted the scroll, flattened the single sheet of parchment, and read:
The caress of his husband’s voice, the remorseless pounding of his hips, the girth of his cock stretching and filling him, the unbearable pleasure it ignited in his body when it nailed that perfect spot were all too much for Draco. He couldn’t stand it any longer. He couldn’t stop it, even if it meant that he brought the house crashing down around their ears. So, with a last ragged cry of “
“You said we’d be there at four. We barely have time to get dressed.”
“Nnngh. No.”
“Not the way you read it.”
“They can wait! Oh,
Realizing that the man was going to be no help at all, Harry reached for the ledger lying on the desk in front of him. He spun it round to read it, knocking a paper tray of fish and chips to the floor in the process.
"He wouldn't say it. He'd make you guess."
Neville’s
So why this sudden change?
Draco fiddled with the wand in his pocket and gnawed his lip—free of lipstick; he was at his most subdued and colorless today—while trying to grapple with her logic. It made sense that he needed a reason to haunt the castle. It also made sense to assist one or two of the professors, as payment for their tutoring, if nothing else. But take on a formal role as assistant to the Defense Master? Get up in front of a class and
” Draco hissed, his eyes darting around the room in alarm. Thankfully, no one seemed to be paying attention to the two squabbling teenagers behind the piano, and for all her nastiness, Pansy had not raised her voice above a whine.
Gumboil answered in his usual surly tone. “He didn’t say anything about a baby. He wanted Potter. ”
Draco sat in comfortable silence, leaning back on his hands, his grey eyes distant and his face calm. Whatever he might be thinking or feeling, he betrayed nothing. He wore his hair loose around his shoulders - something Harry hand never seen him do before the siege - and the effect was startling. The mop of shining, windblown hair softened his sharp features, took their hard edges off, and made him seem far more like a human boy than a Medieval painting. He wasn't even wearing a sneer, which both unnerved and encouraged Harry.
“Dragon!” Harry laughed, catching him and staggering back against the wall under his weight.
“Completely safe,” Harry said earnestly. “We cleared out every trace of Voldemort and his followers, every spell, artifact and stick of furniture that they touched. Then we razed the Manor to the ground and filled in the dungeons, for good measure. There is nothing inside these gates that can hurt you. You have my word on it.”
was actually a skilled Chaser and a respectable Beater, but his slight stature was ideal for a Seeker and made it difficult for him to compete with older players in any other position).
Jewel looked blankly at her, so she tried again.
"That seems most likely."
"For now, but we'll find him."
“Leave them,” Harry said with a grin and a kiss pressed to his temple. “I’ll take care of them on my day off.”
As Hagrid turned, Harry felt as though a centaur had just kicked him in the chest. Recognition, horror and a relief so intense that it made him cry out in pain flooded him. Dropping the crossbow, he started for the clearing at a run, but Firenze's hand fastened on his arm, dragging him back.
When Molly opened her mouth to protest, he raised a warning eyebrow at her. She shut her mouth with a snap and subsided, glowering.
“You’re determined to make me eat.”
"They haven't attacked again," Hermione said, "but McGonagall says they're still out there. They've surrounded the school grounds, weakening the outer wards with their presence and forcing Dumbledore to use all his power to keep them out."
what Potter wanted to know? Maybe it was the Auror in him, always working the case.
I hope you enjoy it! Please let me know what you think!
Draco gave a little sob and let his head drop forward, baring his back and neck to Harry. The Gryffindor slipped his arms around his waist and drew him close, pressing his lips to the spot where Draco’s white-blond hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck. Then Harry settled him back against his own chest and bent to whisper in his ear.
is the lie?! What if I’m still back in my cell, with my father, dreaming of you?! What if he’s standing there, watching,
"Let's have a rest and wait for it to come back," Harry suggested, nudging Draco again with his knee to guide him toward the tallest seats in the stands.
Granger blinked at him in surprise. “To Teddy Lupin?”
Draco uttered a low whimper of fear that twisted Harry’s heart in his chest, but his lashes twitched up in obedience to his husband’s trusted voice. His eyes were huge and unnaturally bright, set as they were in purple bruise-shadows and glazed with tears. They fixed on Harry’s face, widening still further in disbelief. Then they squeezed shut again, sending tears streaking down his face.
The Interrogators listened to all this with rapt attention. Then Marchbanks wrapped up their testimony by asking, “Is there any basis to the Malfoys’ claim that this is Dark magic?”
“Left over from my Christmas jumper,” Ron interjected, his tone lugubrious.
“Like what? In love?”
“You won’t get any from me!” Ron assured him. Then, his head cocked thoughtfully and his eyes going soft with worry, “Do you need backup? ’Mione’s still at work, so I don’t have to go home straight away. I could maybe do a french fry run…”
"Of course you are. That's why your bad taste in boyfriends matters so much to so many people."
One cloaked figure stood at the rear of the bus, stooping over Professor Moody's still body. Harry watched, paralyzed with horror, as the Death Eater straightened and turned to face him. It took a step away from Moody, toward Harry, and his limbs abruptly thawed. Spinning away from the chilling sight of Moody lying sprawled in the grass, his face stained with blood, Harry took off up the hill after Draco again, his feet lightened by his panic 'til he practically flew.
Nearly an hour later—after Draco had hit Potter with two Stinging hexes to encourage him to keep his hands to himself—the little family was dressed and ready to go. Draco insisted that his elegant, full-sleeved, lace-trimmed shirt and leather trousers were entirely unsuited to such menial tasks as carrying babies, so Harry did the honors, which suited them both just fine. Armed with a bag of bottles and nappies, a sleeping baby, and wallet full of Muggle cash, Harry finally swept them out the door.
“Like what?”
He tossed away his scroll as he said it and lifted his face to receive Harry’s kiss. It was brief but fervent and told him (as if he needed the added assurance after the manner of Harry’s entrance) that things had gone well at the trial. Harry dropped another kiss on the baby’s head, then straightened up, beaming.
“Lying to you for so long.”
of Molly apparating into the room interrupted his rambling. He turned to smile genially at his wife and said, “Just in time, my dear. Do we have any Skele-Gro on hand?”
“Hello, Draco.” He said nothing. She swallowed her discomfort and spoke again, her voice rough with emotion she would not acknowledge. “Thank you for letting me past your guards. I wasn’t sure you would.”
“It is.”
“I think we’d better go on home,” Hermione said, her voice soft and warm with kindness, “and leave you two alone.”
“Well, I will. In the meantime, you need to get out of that hospital wing and out of this castle, before you go stir-crazy. Come to Herbology with us. Then maybe tea with Hagrid. We don’t have class this afternoon, so we were thinking we’d pay him a visit.”
“Mmh,” was all Draco managed in response, but his eyes stayed open and his gaze rested on the boy in the cage.
“Mm.” Harry tilted his head back against the bed frame and stared up at the ceiling. His eyes were dry, but they burned with the need for tears.
do is promise you that I won’t allow my marriage or anything else to get in the way of my job.”
“Blaise.”
“I’m going to kill him!” Ron hissed, lurching to his feet and sending his chair skidding back from the table. “I’m going to Crucio his bollocks off, and then I’m going to
Harry could almost feel Draco stiffen from across the room.
“No, you will
An unexpected spell struck him—cold and alien, like the man who cast it—and dragged Draco’s head up in spite of his torment. Through a glaze of tears, he saw Forbush standing over him with a wand in his hand. The Unspeakable frowned.
“How are you feeling?”
Draco stiffened with sudden, irrational worry. “St. Mungo’s? Why are you taking him to St. Mungo’s? Is there something wrong with him?”
This thought tormented Harry to point that he started haunting the seventh floor hallway outside the Room of Requirement when he knew Draco was inside. He didn’t dare go in. Draco would be furious, maybe furious enough to hex him or throw him out of his bed. Self-preservation dictated that Harry stay out of the other boy’s business, let him get on with his work, and wait patiently for him to reappear, but what if he didn’t? What if he was lying in that room, among the heaps of discarded objects, too ill or weak to drag himself out the door again?
“Have I not said that I don’t hold him responsible for that?” Dumbledore replied. “And have we not determined that I am the only one in a position to make such restrictions or to punish him for violating them? Come, now, Cornelius, enough is enough. Draco has done nothing wrong.”
"The students don't know anything, except for a small group of Slytherins who are keeping it to themselves. McGonagall has called in several members of the Order and stationed them about the castle. She's closed the floo network, except to your office, and posted a guard there in case Umbridge comes back for Malfoy. And she's authorized the guards to use whatever force is necessary to keep Ministry wizards out of Hogwarts."
His husband just smiled and said, “We’ll see,” before claiming his mouth again.
and there wasn’t a damned thing I could do about it!”
“You give me everything, Harry.”
“I know the twins got Unicorn hair.”
No, he could not.
would take.”
“It’s going to be okay, Lissy. I’ll make them give him back.”
Bodies crowded close around him, muttering, the smell of their lust almost overwhelming the stench of their unwashed flesh. Draco mouthed Harry’s name silently, knowing he didn’t dare say it aloud. Carrow saw his lips move and cackled in glee.
The office of the Minister for Magic looked exactly as Harry might have expected, knowing Fudge. It was full of dark wood, brass ornaments, heavily-carved furniture, and decorations intended to impress upon the visitor a sense of its occupant’s importance. Glancing around, he thought that this must have been what the Mayor of London’s office looked like—circa 1850. He didn’t recognize any of the portraits staring curiously down at him from the papered walls—none of them were Hogwarts Headmasters or Black ancestors—but he did recognize most of the people who rose to their feet to greet him.
"RAVENCLAW!" the Hat bellowed.
“Then what was it like, pray tell?”
“He probably knew it wouldn’t do any good. You never answer your bleeding mail.”
“So what if it was a Veela? He still agreed to have sex with her!”
“Ah!” Her tears quickened and her smile brightened. “After your Auntie Genie! So, she’s a little bit Black, as well.”
Harry lifted his head. “The charm?”
“Yes.”
Something about that voice—caring and kind and unflappable—sucked the fight out of Harry. Perhaps it was a healer’s trick to manage distraught family members. Perhaps Harry was simply too exhausted and terrified and gutted by grief to resist. Whatever the truth of it, he let Trevor guide him out of the curtained bay, across the expanse of the emergency treatment room, and through the main doorway to the corridor beyond.
, do I?! He
He nodded. “When he’s there with me, the world is right. When he’s not, I can still feel and hear and smell him, but it isn’t real. It
"Oi! Pig!" Ron bellowed, “Get out of it, you little, feathered git!"
“Hey, Ferret.”
What could go wrong, indeed?
"Are you asking me to have sex with you?"
“If Snape and Dumbledore are right, Draco is upset about his studies, so taking him out of school in the middle of term will only upset him more. We need to keep him calm. Help him recover. That means, leaving him here where he belongs and letting him complete his work.”
"You won't say that tonight," Harry laughed.
“I will.”
He was wearing leather trousers.
“He’s a fucking cunt. And he shitted on us. A real Slytherin would have settled it himself, instead of going to Dumbledore.”
“So it
"You can't. You can only gamble that your enemies will not catch you at that split second when you are completely vulnerable, and accept the risk that they might. But that is why none of us will be apparating with either you or Mr. Malfoy. We can't afford to gamble with your lives."
“’Til I’m sure you and the baby are strong enough.” He fed Draco another forkful of eggs, then added, “As long as it takes.”
” like some sort of playful ghost. Or maybe it was the string he trailed behind him for her to chase. Whatever the lure that drew her, she would not be separated from him, which suited Draco just fine. It kept them busy and left him free to enjoy his afternoon (if he could block out the racket).
"Why would it?"
"And this is all just going to go away, now that the link is cut?"
, he silently begged.
He lifted a hand to rub his eyes. It smelled of moldy book bindings and the attic at Grimmauld Place. He thought wistfully of his lunch, still sitting on a tray in the drawing room, and the poor old elf weeping over his fate. Hopefully Kreacher would obey him and wait for Harry, rather than causing a stir. Or punishing himself.
“Food it is, then.” Harry’s fingers sank into Draco’s hair, supporting his head, holding him as if he were infinitely precious. His thumb brushed Draco’s bruised lips tenderly. “I think you deserve a night out on the town. A reward for surviving yet another attempt by your family to brainwash you.”
"Don't!"
"They are not likely to give him much trouble, considering that many of letters he has retrieved come from them." Dumbledore flicked the pile of scrolls with one finger. "They want their children."
for drawing his wand on another Auror? For threatening his life?! Behavior that would have gotten anyone else thrown into a cell next to his Death Eater husband?!” A rumble of noise rose from the tiers of seats, forcing Dawlish to raise his voice as he finished triumphantly, “It sounds to me like
“And the child. Only once has a wizard given birth to a living child, that we know of, and that was more than six hundred years ago. We have no record of how he did it or what happened to mother and child after the birth.”
sodding
"Albus wouldn't let her anywhere near him, if she were," Mrs. Weasley said, with only a hint of dryness in her voice. "You don't have to worry about Genie."
Just how much refuse had hit the fan, while Harry was too busy to notice? Just how fucked were they?
“You could have stayed in your own bloody house.”
“Not particularly, but I’d like to see the old house again. My mother used to take me there sometimes, as a child, and I recall that it was very grand but rather rundown.”
Dumbledore's wand appeared in his hand, and Malfoy froze, one foot lifted to find the next stair. Under Dumbledore's stern gaze, he slowly lowered his foot and stepped backward onto the drive. Dumbledore lowered his wand but did not put it back in his belt. "That was wise."
“You can, you know. I’ll listen and I won’t get mad. Well,” he temporized, “maybe I
"I assume that you
“He’s capable, all right. Just look what he’s done to Draco…”
“You know it is.” A fingertip pushed into him, and he groaned, “
Draco shivered, half in nervousness, half in anticipation, when Harry’s hands opened his shirt and found the bare skin beneath. Strong, calloused fingers stroked his ribs, his back, then hesitated when they touched the wicked scar that slashed across his belly.
Draco caught the question in his tone and felt his innards roil still more powerfully. Did Potter actually care where Draco had gotten a piece of jewelry? Could he possibly be
“Wait just a moment, Dumbledore,” Fudge cut in, pompously. “I’m the Minister for Magic and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, so I’ll say when it’s time to call this session to order!”
Hermione’s brows shot up. “Purple?”
Harry pulled him a little closer and bent down to murmur, "See? It's the sky. We're almost there."
“He will soon. And he’ll need his best duckling, when he does.”
Harry felt a sudden, irrational flare of anger inside him, and he turned on Ron fiercely. "Just shut up about Malfoy, okay? You don't know what you're talking about!"
“It’s okay.”
“Okay, but you’re missing the point.”
“How so?”
"That is easily done, but it will not answer Madam Bones' question. To grasp the full extent of my son's illness, you must hear the entire sordid tale, going all the way back to the so-called Siege of Hogwarts."
"Is it Draco?" Harry asked. "Have they found him?"
“Do you want to tell me about it?”
“That’s it, love. Ffffelix!”
A predatory grin spread over Rita’s face. “My, my. Isn’t that lovely?” She held up the phial, shaking it slightly to make the silvery liquid it contained swirl, then her eyes snapped back to the face inside the hood. “Where’s the rest?”
“I’ll answer that,” he snapped.
“Screaming at us isn’t going to fix it.”
“Obviously, but I didn’t know that. And I didn’t want to get sucked into an investigation that had nothing to do with me, when some obsessed stalker was breaking into Malfoy’s flat—I was pretty sure it was your flat, by then,” he added in an aside to Draco, “—and fondling his lace panties. So I headed back to the flat to wait, and that’s where you came in.”
“Do you need anything else?”
She swept them all with her frigid gaze and added, “My son tried to prevent it by telling the Dark Lord that he had lain with other men and the child would not be Potter’s, but he failed. The Dark Lord read the truth—that he had been with Potter alone—and conceived the child.”
Mustering all his strength, Draco shifted one hand up to cradle the baby’s head. It felt tiny and fragile, nestled in the curve of his fingers. Harry pressed another kiss to his forehead, lingering with his lips on Draco’s skin for a long minute. Then, abruptly, he broke away and bounded to his feet.
Malfoy gave a grunt of disgust. "You know what I mean. There's nothing wrong with you, so why is Pomfrey keeping you here?"
To Ron’s surprise, Narcissa shook her head and actually smiled. “You will only weaken your position, if you insist on defending the guilty. And unlike my son, I am actually guilty.”
“Too bad. Get on the broom.”
Draco twisted on the seat cushions to face him directly. His eyes were shuttered, but his mouth looked oddly vulnerable, as if he were a breath away from gnawing on his lip like any low-bred Gryffindor.
Philippe got Draco’s robes off and his shirt open. His mouth with its hard, skilled lips moved down to caress his collarbones, then dipped to tongue a nipple. Draco leaned back, abandoning himself to the heat that coursed through his body and coalesced in his groin. He was ragingly hard, his pants already stretched tight over his jutting cock and wet with anticipation. He could feel a pulsing pleasure in his arse and his hole clenched at the thought of what was coming. If he weren’t enjoying what that mouth was doing to him so much, and the stroking of fingers over his skin as they stripped him, he would have pulled his wand, banished both their clothes, and climbed on Philippe’s cock that instant.
Of course she could. She was an intellectual before all else, with an uncanny ability to distance herself from uncomfortable facts. Harry was not being unfair—to her, or to Ron—by asking her to share with her husband the same information she had shared with her two closest friends. He was not ducking the issue or sleazing out of an awkward conversation.
“Of course I do,” Harry said firmly.
“You can’t just leave me here! She’s gonna
“That’s not what I…”
At a light touch on his knee, Draco’s eyes snapped open to find Lissy standing close beside him. Her own eyes were huge and mournful, but full of an understanding that told Draco this was not the first time his mother had broken down this way. She held a small crystal flask in one hand.
“I wouldn’t know. Taking the air, perhaps? He’s my lovely pet, not my prisoner, and I only put him on a leash when he asks for it.” Nero’s expression hardened—a very odd look on such a round face—and the sugar in his voice soured. “What I would like to know is how you got the silly idea that he’s missing and who gave you permission to search his room.”
“Yes,” he said quietly.
“Master Harry, Kreacher is relieved to see you. Kreacher has been waiting for you to return.”
"Headmaster," Snape said, wearily, "is there a purpose to this bit of Shunpike Family History?"
“What are you going to do?” he whispered.
“Papa looks beautiful,” Wart said quietly, bringing his uncle’s laughing eyes to him.
Harry shivered. He didn't like the tone of this conversation at all, remembering as he did his first encounter with the Forbidden Forest and the centaurs."
He dropped the parchment, looked up at Harry with his brows raised. “Sound like anyone we know?”
“I’ve hardly seen the git! But that gives me an idea. With you off playing hero for the Croatians, maybe Ferret and I can spend some quality time together. Brush up on our snark. Find new ways to take the piss out of the Chosen One.”
Potter pushed his shirt aside to bare his chest. His eyes stroked Draco’s skin as fiercely as his hands, drawing a shudder and a low, throaty moan from him. Draco didn’t dare take the initiative. He could only press himself back against the wall, palms flattened to the stone, head tilted back to keep Potter’s face in sight, and wait for his next move. He was breathing hard, shivering in anticipation of the other boy’s touch, wondering what he saw and praying to every god he’d ever heard of that, whatever it was, he liked it.
…” His knee pushed between Draco’s legs, parting them. “Will give
They had commandeered Hermione’s office and filled it with their pilfered files. The desk wasn’t as big as Harry’s antique monstrosity, and the room was so full of books that it was hard to move without tripping over them, but it gave them a place to work that had no shades of Draco lurking in the corners. That was all Harry needed.
"Yes, Malfoy. I'm sorry to disturb you, but…"
“Of course I trust you! I just… I don’t know…”
“I’m a raving lunatic, but I’ll see what I can do. I can’t say more than that.” Slipping the diaper bag off her shoulder, she held it out to Harry. “You get Rose fed and make me some breakfast. I’ll talk to Malfoy.”
Draco stared at his reflection in the full-length mirror, gnawing his lip in doubt. He tugged at the hem of his long lavender silk shirt where it brushed his thighs. Then he smoothed one sleeve down over the jagged scar that poked out from beneath the rolled cuff.
“But you don’t believe it?” she murmured through stiff, pale lips.
“I thought I did, but after today, I’m not so sure. And anyway, it doesn’t matter. Draco needs to feel safe, and he won’t as long as he’s afraid that you or his mother will ambush him again. So I’m making sure neither of you can.” He met her wide, tragic eyes and added, almost softly, “I told you, Andromeda, there’s no going back from this.”
His hands found the body, and he began to search upward, looking for the face of the dead child.
“Later. When you’re stronger. I’ll floo-call him after breakfast to make sure he’s okay, but I can’t look after him and you at the same time. Not when you’re too weak to sit up or get yourself to the loo.”
“Of course not, it was Weasel’s idea.”
She returned his smile with a look of benign satisfaction that surprised him. Madam Pomfrey was a kindly witch and devoted nurse, but she was not one given to satisfaction. Her world was one in which students did stupid things, teachers interfered with her best efforts, and no one listened to her. The last time he'd seen her look truly happy was when she had watched Hagrid eject the entire Slytherin Quidditch team from the hospital wing - one at a time, by the scruff of the neck. A thing of beauty, as Harry recalled, and a great balm to Madam Pomfrey's nerves. She wasn't fond of Slytherins.
Draco couldn't quite smother the jolt of pain that went through him at Potter's words. He knew he had only himself to blame for the years of rancor and deliberate hurt that they had inflicted on each other. He could have stopped it at any time - except that he couldn't. To spare Potter the constant lash of his jealousy and hatred would have meant losing all connection with him, and that was unthinkable.
It was the look of a man about to be ravished. A man
“And they, too, have forgotten those encounters?”
“No.”
“Do I? I’m not so sure.”
"Miss Granger, before you come into this room, you must promise me that you will say nothing of what you see or hear. Nothing of Mr. Malfoy's injuries, nothing of Harry's choices, nothing of spells or charms or magic of any kind. Do you understand?"
“Sorry to keep you waiting so long,” the one with the folder said (sounding not even remotely sorry), “but it’s been a busy night. My name is Duckworth.” He hooked a thumb at his partner. “That’s Leaming. Have you got a name?”
"But you have to tell me the truth about something."
As if to prove her point, the baby began to squirm and wail. Weasley came to a halt in front of the cold hearth and jiggled Rose a bit to calm her. The lack of a fire reminded Draco that they hadn’t yet fetched Kreacher from Grimmauld Place. The poor old elf was probably in hysterics, by now.
He draped his coat over one chair and sat in the other, gazing up hopefully at the woman.
"That you'll be careful!"
Colin Creevey piped up, in his penetrating voice, “Oh, that’s what they all do! Give her a few weeks and she’ll learn how to smile, then you’ll really have some fun with her!”
The elf bowed, lower than before, and croaked, “Kreacher would be honored to obey Master Harry in this!”
“That’s enough out of you, young man. As I was saying, Tio is a nickname, and we haven’t filed any paperwork that says otherwise. So we can still name him anything we want.”
Grinning now, Philippe wrenched open his belt and popped the button on his flies with one twist of his hand. His cock was so hard that it practically peeled his trousers back by itself and thrust up through the elastic of his pants. Draco didn’t wait for the other boy to do the honors. He reached for that lovely, hard thing and pulled the pants away from it.
“I didn’t come to you, because you can’t help.” He finally lifted his eyes to meet Harry’s, making the loyal Gryffindor wince at what he saw in them. “No one can. Don’t you get it, Harry? There’s no way out of this.”
“You don’t think he’ll leave the cottage, do you?”
“Fourth year at Hogwarts. The Yule Ball.”
“I think we can rely on this gentleman for any opinion we need.”
He stared at her for a beat, dumbfounded, then said in his most scathing tone, “Because I didn’t
. It had to be. No one else had a head of hair like that or walked in quite that poised, graceful, cat-like way. But what was Draco Malfoy doing in the custody of two Aurors? Being paraded like a trophy through the Atrium? Wearing Muggle clothing—
"Will you find Ron Weasley, while you're at it?"
They shook hands and Kingsley waved Harry into an empty chair at Robards’ side. “Nonsense, Harry, I always have time for you. And you’ve saved me the trouble of an owl.”
Harry knew these wards intimately, had designed and constructed them himself. It took little effort to alter them, though he had to be careful that he didn’t unravel protections he wanted while tampering with others. After a few minutes of work, he sighed in satisfaction and dropped his hand. He opened his eyes to find both Ron and Hermione standing behind him, watching him intently.
Draco was screaming something, but his voice was lost in the chaos that raged in Harry's head. Harry wiped a furious hand across his eyes and willed himself to focus. The charm could not take him, because he was not subject to it. And it could not take Draco so long as Harry was linked to him and able to shield him. Harry told himself these things, as he battled his own consuming desire to run out of the room and into Voldemort's arms and fought his way up out of the flood of madness and pain that assaulted him.
"I spent most of my time thinking about what happened in the hospital wing," Harry said, his gaze fixed unwaveringly on the other boy, "wondering why I did it, whether I really wanted it, and whether I wanted to do it again now that the link was cut."
Draco looked annoyed at that. "I don't need another nursemaid, and I didn't say anything about leaving." Sliding toward the far edge of the bed, he slapped the mattress and said, "Come on, you Gryffindor git."
“Funny sort of twins,” Ron murmured, with a smile. “Wonder what my mum’ll say when I tell her I’ve adopted another brother?”
now?!”
“Hmm. I started using heavily, selling my arse to his friend for those little lumps of sugar, then stealing money from his pockets to buy more. I was well and truly hooked. When he threw me out, he gave me just enough silver for a bus ride to London. I didn’t dare spend it on drugs. I needed to get somewhere I could hide. So I rode the Knight Bus to the Leaky Cauldron, stole a wand from a witch’s pocket to get through the wall into Diagon Alley, and hid in an empty storefront across from Borgin and Burkes. That’s where Nero found me.”
Narcissa sighed and nodded, her mouth drooping dejectedly.
“It certainly does. But remember, Harry, that prophecies are only meaningful if we make them so. Voldemort’s reliance on them is a weakness. It makes him overconfident and predictable. We already knew the only salient fact—that you love Draco Malfoy enough to start a war for him—the rest is a trap for the unwary.”
“What was all that about?”
“It can’t get any worse. Lucius has gone completely round the twist, and Narcissa’s not far behind.”
“There will be, if Draco has his way.”
Two Aurors strode in. The men who’d brought him here. Pompous and Nasty.
"Are you feeling better?"
Draco did not deign to respond to that, but as he sank back in his chair, smoke trailing from between his lips, he rasped, “Ta.”
Harry just stood there, rigid with fury, fighting to rein in his temper and his magic.
"You thought that scar was a sign of strength? Of a special purpose or destiny? It's nothing but a brand, a mark of ownership. I suppose you could say that it signifies a special purpose, but not the one you dream of, my poor, besotted boy."
“Not… not everything.” Narcissa swallowed painfully, feeling tears thicken her throat and burn her eyes. “Only that it was terrible.
The quicksilver eyes widened dramatically. “I c’n keep a secret.”
“You might have told me, Harry. You and I are practically family, and Draco is one of the few blood relatives I have left alive.”
he was her father, but really it was You-Know-Who…"
"Go on, then. I'll tell Sirius that we've arrived, then I must go out again."
“Changed my mind,” Harry mumbled, as the crowd opened to welcome him in.
Dumbledore's eyebrows rose, and he murmured, "Indeed."
She nodded eagerly. “We learned about the Unforgivables at the beginning of the year.”
It wasn’t a question, but Harry answered it anyway. “More than anything. And just think what it’ll mean for your career! You won’t be responsible for the boys’ care, so you can just get out there and… take over the world!”
Theo snorted. “Too bad Snape’s already thrown him off the team.”
Draco's expression did not change, but Harry could feel tension rising in his body. His fingers stiffened. A small tremor went through him. And the blind look in his eyes grew more pronounced. He still stared up at the Headmaster's face, but Harry could swear that he was not seeing the old wizard at all, and whatever he
Draco stiffened. "Wait, let me guess. He wants me to sleep in a padded coffin, so I won't fall out of bed and
“All right, fine,” he sighed, his eyes smiling up at Harry through his lashes, even as his mouth twisted into a discontented pout. “But I reserve the right to change my mind tomorrow.”
Enjoy!
Those words fell like a brick onto the floor between them, the thud of their landing echoing into silence. Harry took a long, shaky breath and let it out on a groan.
"I'm glad you're here, Malfoy," Bill confided loudly. "Maybe she'll spend some of her time trying to cut
"What's wrong with him?"
“Who’s going to say it first?” he murmured in his most velvet tones.
“Sex?” Draco blinked stupidly at him. “
Draco cocked an eyebrow at him and smirked. “Oobleck.”
“From what?! You’re the one who’s hurting me! You’re the one who…
"Umm, thanks. I'll wait for my tea."
Draco snorted at that but couldn’t quite repress a smile. Harry’s stubborn optimism was endearing, even if it was borderline insane. He sucked in a steadying breath and met Harry’s eyes squarely.
, and you still say you want to
skirmish in one piece?”
"Give it up, Mum," Ron advised, grinning. "You're wasting your breath, and we have to get up to the castle. You wouldn't want Harry to miss another meal, would you? Poor, starving Harry?"
Draco opened his mouth to protest, then shut it again when he realized what he was about to say.
Harry studied Draco’s reflection, reading the seriousness of the question and the depths of his uncertainty. His green eyes were grave, intent, telling Draco that he recognized just how much his answer mattered. When he spoke, his voice was thoughtful and sad.
“Merlin’s balls! Felix, what did you do?!”
Harry’s shoulders began to shake with sobs. Hot tears streamed down his cheeks. Something very like a keen rose in his throat.
ones, I presume!”
“I’m not. I’m…
He had spent four days pretending that the world outside the Burrow did not exist, ignoring Owls and floo-calls, hiding behind wards and the formidable presence of Molly Weasley, absorbed in the task of holding Draco together ’til his shattered pieces began to mend. That was his life now—a sagging sofa, a pile of patchwork quilts, a shivering body huddled against his back through the night, a silver-blond head lying in his lap through the day, a pair of shuttered grey eyes following his every move as if afraid that he would vanish if they looked away—and as painful as it was, he treasured it.
“All right, boys!” Harry said brightly. “Why don’t you all go up to the tea room with Uncle Ron and…”
Always the gracious lady, Narcissa tore her gaze from her son to fix it on Harry. “Mr. Potter. Thank you for coming.”
“Why did you take that Syrup of Poppies?” The question fell like lead on Draco’s chest, crushing the breath out of him. “Were you trying to kill yourself?”
” a boy near the back gasped.
Draco’s mouth sagged open in disbelief. “
“Harry, this is ridiculous,” Draco protested, even as he got to his feet and moved to the spot indicated by his husband’s pointing finger. “I don’t need a disguise. In fact, I don’t
"Nothing?"
“Yes, certainly.”
“Then I’m going to kiss you…” He followed through on this, ducking his head to caress Draco’s lips with his own.
“Someone who wants him in prison. Or away from
“And snake scales?” Lavender added.
“No, that should be our second move. Or maybe our third. First, I’m heading over to St. Mungo’s to interview the healers and, if possible, Boggs himself. Care to join me?”
“No.” Harry stepped up close to him and took his hand. “Don’t say that.”
Getting dressed shouldn’t be this sodding difficult!
"There's Veritaserum," Madam Bones offered, a bit reluctantly Harry thought.
Mrs. Malfoy seemed to struggle with herself, as if regretting the impulse that had brought her here. After a tense moment, she spoke, her voice harsh with strain and her words clipped short. “My son is the prisoner of the Dark Lord.”
Here it is, folks! The obligatory Wizengamot scene! I hope you enjoy it.
McGonagall cocked a cynical eyebrow at him. "Hoping for the worst are we, Weasley?" Ron flushed a shocking red, and McGonagall relented. "Malfoy will also be just fine. Now both of you, run along. Potter won't be up for a visit 'til this afternoon, at the earliest. I'll let you know when you can see him."
"I was saying hello to my friends," Ron answered, one eyebrow raised in surprise. "D'you have a problem with that?"
“And yours, Harry. Don’t ever doubt that.”
Green flames flared in the fireplaces as he passed, but he took no notice. The Ministry floos were always busy, especially at this time of day. A babble of voices rose and the bodies moving with him abruptly came to a halt. Neville plowed into the back of a wizard in Magical Maintenance robes, and he stumbled backward, once more muttering an apology.
"Father…"
The man’s eyes gleamed unpleasantly, and his lips tilted in a predatory smile. “A suck or a ride? Quickly, now, before I take it out of your hands.”
"I am truly sorry, my dear Narcissa, but that is not possible."
It was also incredibly hot and never failed to fill Harry’s cock with want. Today was no exception, but Harry had enough good sense and restraint to keep the heat in his pants to himself until he could judge Draco’s mood. At the moment, it was a toss up whether his husband would lash out with his rogue magic and turn all the draperies in the house baby-shit brown, or jump him in a frenzy of lust.
“In what respect, Cornelius?” Dumbledore asked, his voice dangerously silky.
“It’s killing him that he can’t fly.”
"Listen, Blaise, I was thinking..." Every eye in the group swiveled to stare at Crabbe in disbelief. He felt his cheeks go hot, but he held his ground and stared back at them. "I was thinking that maybe you're right."
“Because he doesn’t want to upset you. But you don’t have to worry. I’m looking out for him.” Then, with a beaming smile, “That’s why I made the Sorting Hat put me in Hufflepuff. It wanted to put me in Gryffindor, but I said no, it had to be Hufflepuff.”
"I'm sorry, Draco," he groaned, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry…"
The words went through Harry like a dull blade. Relief turned to horror, and he clutched Draco tightly to his chest, whispering, “No, shh, it’s okay.”
"Now, now, Narcissa…"
“Always.”
“Very well, if that’s how you want to play it.” He made a move to push back his chair. “I hope you find the cells down here comfortable because you’re going to be spending a lot of time in one.”
Finally, she transferred the brewing teapot to the table and sat down on the bench opposite him.
“So stacking them up just makes the counter-spell stronger,” Ron said. “I wonder what would happen if you stacked up even more of them? How big an explosion could you get?”
“You look dreadful, Harry. Do you want something to eat?”
*** *** ***
“He can help you, Draco, I’m sure. Harry is so clever.”
Harry just smiled and kissed him. It was a gentle and relatively chaste caress, but it started the golden power singing in his head and sparking before his eyes. Draco purred his approval and opened his mouth in a silent invitation, but Harry reluctantly broke off the kiss before it could get too heated. Gazing down into his lover’s upturned face through a haze of wizarding power, he saw that the mask had melted and the wounded look had faded from his winter eyes. He was still hurt, even frightened, but no longer frantic to escape. The wild creature had come tamely to his hand.
It hurt to live, period. Harry had always known this, but he'd never voiced it to himself until he had to face the possibility of suffering through it all alone. Now he had found the other half of himself, the one person who could make this ridiculous mess of a life bearable, known what it was like to have companionship for a brief time, and that person was being taken away from him. Slowly. Bit by agonizing bit. Leaving Harry to bleed and suffer and mourn, but never to die… not quite, anyway.
His hands clumsy in his urgency, Harry fumbled with buttons and zips, pausing every now and then to suck at the white skin he bared or lunge up for another taste of those purple-red lips. By the time he got Draco’s boots, trousers and pants off, he was too far gone to worry about the rest of his clothing. He simply tore open robes and shirt, grabbed the smaller man by the thighs and plowed into him, sure that he would lose his mind if he didn’t bury himself his lover’s body that very fucking instant
“Why didn’t the Ponce out us?” Draco demanded, jumping on what was by far her most interesting statement (he’d heard all of Granger’s arguments against hiding his pregnancy so often, by now, that he could recite them in his sleep). “And don’t tell me he had a fit of conscience because I won’t believe
Harry sighed. “Like I did with Ginny?”
“Thank you. I’m sorry for getting you up so late, but…”
“Yes.” Mr. Weasley’s expression turned anxious. “How are you doing, my boy? Dumbledore hustled us all off the island before we got a chance to speak with you, then wouldn’t let us into the hospital wing. Were you hurt?”
Draco reached the master bedroom and slammed the door behind him, putting a locking spell on it for good measure. Then he flung himself down on the bed and lay staring blindly up at the canopy above him. He didn’t move.
Fudge, still wearing his nasty little smile, said, "I think, in light of Dolores' concerns about the, er, authenticity of the contents of the Pensieve, that we should consider another means of examining Malfoy's memories."
“We?” Draco faltered, his scowl slipping into a troubled frown.
all?”
Another blink. Another pause. “Master Harry wishes to imprison a house-elf.”
Draco was fascinated. He didn’t want to be. He suspected that this would turn into another paean to Pureblood Privilege, and he had no patience with that shite anymore. But the look on his father’s face, the note in his voice, the openness with which he spoke all captivated his son. Draco could not remember a time when his father had treated him this way—as a trusted equal, a valued son, a Malfoy in all the best ways instead of a tribute to his sodding Family Name—and he didn’t want it to stop. Ever.
"And Slytherins are
Draco watched all this, feeling incredibly awkward and out of place, all his social graces deserting him at the worst possible moment. When McGonagall’s gimlet eye swept him from head to toe, he felt as if she were tallying all his faults—real and imagined—for future reference. Or she simply didn’t approve of the embroidered jeans. He flushed slightly and wiped his palm on his leg before holding out his hand to her.
“Let me come, Papa!” Bob chimed in, his little face almost as worried as Harry’s (though he clearly had no idea what he was supposed to be worrying about).
“You know Hagrid. He can’t hate anyone for long, even Malfoy.”
“Then consider me your last owner, because no one is ever going to buy you again.”
. He smiled against the warm skin of Harry’s throat, pressed a kiss to it, and sank gratefully into the warm darkness.
"That's not at all surprising," Dumbledore said. He sat down on the foot of the bed and turned a kindly, searching gaze on Draco. "The next few days are going to be difficult for you, Draco."
Harry crossed to the bed in a few strides and settled Draco gently onto the mattress. He looked better at once, his body relaxing into the warmth and softness, his head sinking into the fat pillow. Harry pulled the thick quilts up to his chin and brushed the hair back from his face.
“Is she all right?”
Draco Malfoy was never going to carry a baby. Not
.” He screwed his eyes shut against scalding tears and burrowed his face into Harry’s chest to hide them.
“That’s easy,” Harry whispered, his hand slipping around Draco’s head to cradle it and nudge it closer to his own.
Harry ran down the gentle slope from the castle toward the lake, enjoying the crunch and slither of fresh snow beneath his boots, his face alight with happiness. It was Christmas Eve, and the world was blanketed in the white perfection of the season's first snowfall, the lake frozen solid, Hogwarts castle frosted like a particularly gothic wedding cake. To Harry, the winter landscape was beautiful and inviting beyond description. It had called to him all through breakfast, tempting him out of the castle, away from the furtive looks and determined silences that made his hours inside so uncomfortable.
Light flared in the hallway and cut a bright swath across the floor nearly to his toes. Above him, the stars burned still brighter in competition. The muffled footsteps approached, then halted in the doorway.
Harry felt the blood drain from his cheeks and his features harden. Disgust and rage rose like magma in him. Fudge’s face blurred and ran, as his wizarding power began to spark behind his eyes, preparing to erupt out of him in a blaze of fury. Then Dumbledore’s voice reached him. It was calm. Cold. A dash of ice water down his spine that recalled him to a sense of his surroundings.
Harry waved toward the screen. "In bed. Are you okay, Professor? You're bleeding."
The man smiled sardonically. “You won’t need those clothes.”
“Apparently they can.”
"Yes, but…"
Harry answered without taking his eyes from Draco’s face. “Keep it warm for us. I have something private to discuss with Draco and I don’t want to be disturbed.”
“Blimey,” he said again, as he digested the contents of this missive.
George stepped swiftly over to Felix and bent to scoop him up in his arms. “You going to find Malfoy?”
“How long is this supposed to last, again?” Harry rasped out, forcing Draco to open his eyes and turn to look at his gorgeous, wrecked face.
"Bloody Hell! Does Fudge know about this? Are they going to arrest you, like they did Malfoy?"
“Lying sod,” Draco murmured, eyes gleaming provocatively at him from beneath his lashes. “You’re the one who said we should do it just for fun.”
Once again, snow had fallen in the night, cloaking the landscape in a blanket of pristine white. It looked soft and lovely from the perspective of the sitting room windows, with a fire warming the room and magic sealing the casements against frigid drafts. Almost tempting. Not at all like the icy, clinging, sodden mess that it really was.
, he thought bitterly,
“Don’t leave him alone,” Madam Pomfrey cautioned. “He should rest comfortably for several hours, but let me know if he has any pain. Or if the child needs anything.”
"Malfoy asked me to give you a message."
“I am not lying, Harry.”
The weedy guard put his flask to Draco’s lips, while the other wrenched his head back by the hair. Draco drank the water that poured into his mouth. It hurt to swallow, hurt to feel anything in his stomach, hurt to think that a mouthful of water would keep him alive for another day when he wanted so desperately to die, even if it meant being with his fucking father. But he drank without protest because he had no protest, no resistance, no volition left in him.
“I can’t be late, Harry. You know I’ve got the Parkinson’s hearing today. This is
Together, they fled through the clinging darkness that filled the castle.
His gaze came back into focus and shifted to Dumbledore’s lined, wise, ancient face. It was slightly creased with worry, but at the look in Harry’s eyes, he relaxed.
proud.”
Harry touched his lip gingerly. His fingers came away sticky. "Uh, nothing. An accident. Go on out, Draco. It's just Professor Moody."
Draco obeyed without hesitation, only grimacing slightly at the taste.
Crabbe listened to the grumbles with half an ear, grunting and nodding where expected. He knew better than to say anything. Blaise had already bitten his head off once for daring to have an opinion, and it didn't matter, anyway. There wasn't a blasted thing he could do to stop them, once Blaise put an idea into their heads. Let them rant and rave and foam at the mouth. He could use the noise as cover to think, and he had to think very hard about how he was going to do this, or he'd make a mess of it. He didn't even want to
“…but even then, he was following the orders. And he was sorry, afterward, when he found out how Bellatrix and Narciss-
They were halfway up to the top level and Kingsley’s office, when Harry suddenly remembered the two loyal friends waiting so anxiously for word from him. Drawing his wand without disturbing Draco’s hold on him, he cast a Patronus with ridiculous ease. He was so full of triumphant happiness that it was more of a strain to contain it than to give vent to it.
A tap on the glass beside him brought Draco’s head up with a snap. He smiled and bounded to his feet to open the casement, letting a large Barn owl land on the sill. It had a rolled magazine tied to its leg.
he begged, trying to keep the frantic edge out of his thoughts.
"Then it's a good thing we're having this chat. Let's get this straight, once and for all. You, Harry Potter, are the single most powerful weapon we have in the fight against the Dark Lord. It sounds cold and brutal to say it that way, but it's the truth. Without you, we might as well all line up to get our Dark Marks."
“So don’t. You’ve got nowhere better to be.”
“That’s my job!” Harry protested.
“We’re not going to hurt him, Jewel, I promise you. We want to find him and keep him safe. That’s all.”
Draco considered for a moment, then said, “Put it on the shelf in the nursery.”
“Yours and Malfoy’s.”
Harry obligingly tightened his hold.
"Malfoy isn't all-powerful, and he isn't my enemy. He's a miserable excuse for a human being who doesn't deserve to live. But he can go on living forever for all I care, running errands for Voldemort and leading his Death Eater rallies, as long as he stays away from Draco."
“Fine,” the source said through gritted teeth, “but if I don’t have my gold by this time tomorrow, I’ll report the memories missing and tell Potter where to find them! Then you’ll have the bloody Chosen One knocking on your door!”
“Tell me what’s going on.”
“Oi! It’s Harry!”
“We’ve got it, sir!” He held out a fat scroll of parchment. “Right here! Warwick sent me to deliver a copy to the Minister!”
“I still don’t…”
“I was feeling restless, like I needed to be doing something. Unfortunately, there’s nothing for me to do around here.” He smiled sheepishly around the rim of his raised cup. “I would’ve made you breakfast, but I only know how to make fudge and treacle tart, and we don’t have the ingredients for treacle tart.”
"Don't bother. You're just going back through it again."
"Yes, Miss Granger?"
"I know that." Draco covered his eyes with one hand and lay very still for a long moment. Then he abruptly twisted onto his right side and curled up, his hands drawn into his chest protectively. His hair spilled forward to cover his face, but Harry could see his eyes gleaming in the candlelight. "I just don't want to talk about it. I want to sleep. Okay?"
Kreacher’s voice was harsh with reproach when he croaked, “Kreacher will never desert Master Harry or his most noble husband. Kreacher will die before he fails in his duty to his Family.”
Harry opened his eyes very wide. “
“It’s a metaphor, you Philistine.”
“Innate skill.” Obedient to the pull of Harry’s hands, he stepped up close until his shins hit the mattress. He had to spread his legs to straddle Harry’s knees, but it only stretched his pants in new and interesting ways, dragging another moan from Harry.
The guards closed in around Draco, forcing Harry to fall back, and marched him out of the room between them. They walked down the musty corridor in silence until they reached the last turning. There, Dumbledore stood with his shoulders propped against the wall, his head down and his eyes hooded.
“I do. Honestly. I’m not underestimating her, but I’m also not afraid of her.”
me. Fuck me up against the wall again and again and again… Oh, Merlin
Hermione was right, as per bloody usual, and Draco looked like hell. He’d been getting better since his return to Hogwarts, eating and sleeping regularly, relaxing his state of hyper-vigilance, letting the wounds to his psyche scab over, if not actually heal. Harry was sure of it. But either Harry had been fooling himself—always a possibility—or something had happened that Harry didn’t know about—also quite possible, given his general cluelessness—because Draco looked even more miserable and worn down than he had just that morning. Or maybe it was the firelight throwing heavy, disconcerting shadows across the Slytherin’s pale face.
that the salient point was my tragic death from defenestration, if you fail to do your duty. Not the architectural deficiencies of this house.”
“Yeah, like that.” Potter turned onto his side and propped himself up on one elbow to watch Draco put the cigarette to his lips. “Only I’ve given up paying for it, now that I’ve got everything I want living in my house.”
to hate him - but why? Because he was a sneaky little rat with the soul of a Dementor? No. That wasn't Malfoy. That was the image Harry had built of him, nurtured over years, and plastered with the pale, pointed face of the child he had despised on sight.
“You’re not going to tell me that he has no part of these proceedings, surely,” Marchbanks retorted. “Not only is he Mr. Potter’s spouse, but he is also the victim of his alleged crimes.”
Harry was about to protest, when he realized how easy it would be to do just that. A Slytherin with Death Eater sympathies. A Ravenclaw with a misplaced sense of duty or morality. Even some of his fellow Gryffindors who were sick of watching their fair-haired hero consorting with the Green and Silver Menace. The list was depressingly long. His shoulders drooped another defeated inch.
Draco was savoring his tea, enjoying a bit of domestic tranquility after the wrenching, emotional scene with Molly. Oobleck was curled in her usual place on his tummy (much to Molly’s amusement). Bob was safely penned in his highchair with pumpkin juice and ginger biscuits to occupy his attention. Molly was puttering about the kitchen, fussing over her boys and chatting in a motherly way that kept Bob surprisingly quiet and Draco lulled into near catatonia. It was lovely.
“Easily,” Harry retorted. “I’ve been living with this since I was eleven. Get a grip, Draco, it’s just their usual rubbish. It doesn’t
“I think you should rest now, Draco,” Granger said from close beside him.
“You do
Forbush caught him by the elbow, frowning down at the damage he’d done to himself. “Yes, but it’s quite harmless, I assure you.”
will carry out his orders to the letter."
Harry stared up at Dumbledore, his mouth gone suddenly dry. "I guess it's time."
“Sharing our power like that,” he breathed reverently, “we could do
“Answer me,” Harry growled.
The pain in Harry's chest expanded to fill every corner of him, turning the breath in his throat ragged and forcing hot tears from his eyes. Curling himself into a tight, defensive ball, Harry scrunched up in the middle of the mattress and pulled the blankets over his head. There, in the darkness where Draco always waited for him, he cried and cried until his body was light and empty. Then he slept.
* * *
"Well, I'm not. So quit being such a prat and go see him. I'll even give you the password to the Gryffindor common room, if you'll..."
“I think that’s enough for one morning.”
Levering himself carefully to his feet, he crossed to where Harry stood and took his outstretched hand.
Harry watched her in exasperation for a moment, then he tugged the book from her hands and closed it. “Reading the chapter again is not going to help. You almost did it the last time, you just gave up too soon. Come on, try again.”
“Except he’s a Ministry drone and doesn’t have the Galleons for it.”
, Chapter 12.
“You… oh, fuck, I don’t know if I should even tell you this, now, but…”
“I don’t want to remember it, Harry, any of it… What they told me, what I said, what I s-saw… Voldemort taunting me, grinning at me, his face splitting open and falling away, his tongue… his t-tongue crawling like a snake… And my father standing in the corner, watching, waiting… He’s still there, I know it! Still waiting for me! Waiting to take me with him!”
Potter ignored them, all his attention riveted on Draco. “I want to talk to you.”
“What
Harry shifted closer to him and gently clasped his head.
Harry chuckled, and his shoulders unkinked a bit. He scrubbed his free hand through his hair, looking sheepish. “Cheers, Ron.”
Five minutes later, Harry stepped out of the fireplace in the Weasley’s sitting room, clutching a howling bundle in his hands and looking harassed. Hermione was waiting for him, tapping her foot and frowning. Then she heard the baby crying, and her mouth dropped open in disbelief.
Several of the listeners straightened up at that and started glancing around, curiously, as if looking for a clue as to how the other members of the court were leaning. Fudge smiled smugly. Dumbledore merely raised his eyebrows at Umbridge and waited for her to elaborate on her theme.
She could hear confused voices on the other side of the door and Dumbledore giving orders. Suddenly, the door flew open, and she had just enough time to leap back before Madam Pomfrey, Professor Flitwick and Professor Moody came through it. Moody shut it behind him and put a locking spell on it that Hermione had no illusions about her own ability to counter. Then he shot her a glare from his normal eye and stumped away, muttering.
Draco’s lip began to tremble. “I’m scared.”
Letting the door swing shut behind him, Draco paused to catch his balance and pull on his coat.
taking.”
“He’s going to kill me. I haven’t fulfilled the terms of the Vow, and he’s angry with me.”
“Blimey!” he breathed reverently. Then, twisting to point the hand at the locked door of his cage, he said, more firmly, “
“Not good, great. The best. Even that pillock Robards knows it.”
“I told you I wouldn’t force you into my bed, and I meant it. I won’t force you into
Harry found him by the lake a couple of hours later. He was crouched on the muddy bank, feeding earthworms to the grindylows as they swarmed just below the water’s surface, jaws snapping greedily. At Harry’s call, he looked up, broke out in a smile, and dropped the last of his wriggling treats into the water. Then he rose gracefully to his feet and
Their lips met in a furious, passionate, consuming kiss that instantly turned Draco’s brain to molten soup. Harry—taller than Draco by a few inches and broader through the shoulders—swept him off his feet in his delight and fired a wordless spell at the door behind him. It flew open. The two boys tumbled through it, onto the bed that filled the entire space, then scooted away from the door so Harry could spell it closed again.
“Jeans would work.”
Harry lying broken in Hagrid’s arms. Voldemort shrieking with laughter as the Sorting Hat burst into flame on Longbottom’s head. McGonagall crying out in horror. His father’s face, white and furious, as Draco pulled away from his grasp. The wandless burst of power that flowed out of him when Lucius tried to restrain him. Magic and screams and blood and pain and…
“Ferret asked me to. He wanted to talk to you.”
He hurt so badly that he caught himself wondering, as he lay in his hospital bed with his eyes closed against the blades of sunlight that pierced his skull, if he could summon enough magic to AK himself. Or just blast his brain to scraps so he didn’t care anymore. He doubted it. He hadn’t been able to do much magic for weeks, and deliberately harming yourself with your own magic must take a tremendous amount of determination, if not raw power. Neither of which he had.
The look on Mrs. Weasley's face made Harry feel sick. She sucked in a breath through her teeth, then said, with deadly calm, "I promised Albus I wouldn't discuss Malfoy with you."
She was family. Teddy’s grandmother. Punishing Andromeda meant punishing Teddy, and no one involved wanted that. So Andromeda had graciously apologized (without meaning a word of it, Draco was sure), Harry and Draco had graciously accepted her apology (just as mendaciously, at least on Draco’s part), and everyone had been on their best behavior ever since.
"It's okay, Mrs. Weasley," Harry muttered, shoving his wand behind him and flushing.
“I make no secret of that.”
But again, he held his tongue, reasoning that the man didn’t know how long and how hard they’d been working this case. He was only trying to be helpful.
"Harry," he breathed, soundlessly, and his lashes lifted just enough to show Harry the gleam of hunger in his eyes. "My Harry…"
“I know what you’re trying to do, and I won’t let you.”
“And they’re fighting over dirty jokes?”
A very young Slytherin, probably no older that twelve, bounded to his feet and headed for one of the back passages that led to the dormitories, while a much larger boy approached the doorway. Harry recognized Malcolm Baddock, a Fourth Year and one of the few older Slytherins who had not left the castle during the siege last winter. Baddock was not a bad sort, as Slytherins went, but he had no fondness for Harry and looked none too pleased to find him at the door.
“Right. And they didn’t use the floo to get in or out. Our boys checked every fireplace in that pile and found no sign that the floos were used in the last week.”
While Peter was putting Anne at her ease and Rowena was listening jealously to everything he said, Iffy turned to Theodora and said, artlessly, "You have the prettiest hair I've ever seen."
“What are you going to do? Stun me again? Tie me to the bed? Put me in a body-bind while you fuck me? Is
Rasgotra worked in silence for another minute, while Draco lay like a dead thing and Harry petted his hair to keep him calm. Then the healer straightened up and dropped the sheet over his patient’s body once more.
"Yeah, I think we do."
Draco shook his head without looking at Ron.
Draco could feel the hard length of Harry’s erection pressing into his loins through layers of heavy clothing and the possessive heat in Harry’s kiss. He hummed again, clinging to the other man’s taller body and wrapping himself around it in a blatant offer. He was still drained and boneless from his recent orgasm, but a sure knowledge of what was to come coursed through his body, sparking across his skin, warming his guts, making his cock stir, and sending his overloaded brain into a delicious spiral of want.
She paused, and Ron felt the urge to applaud. The Wizengamot were all staring at her, hostility, discomfort and traces of sympathy in their faces.
Goyle might well be off his nut. Merlin knew, this place bred insanity like fleas in the straw that covered its floors, and stronger men than Goyle had broken inside its walls. Fucking Lucius hadn’t lasted a year. But somehow, Harry doubted that Goyle was crazy. Frightened and wild and holding onto sanity by the bloody stumps of his fingernails, but not quite ready to let go.
“…can’t prove it was rape!” he was bellowing. A howl of mingled protest and approval met this, only growing louder as Warwick raised his voice. “So he took it up the arse a few times! He’d done it often enough before, and things happen in prison! People get up to all sorts of mischief!”
"I mean it. Did it work?"
Without a word, Draco climbed over the bench and started for the door, fighting to keep his face impassive and his eagerness in check. Every eye in the room was fixed avidly on him as he stepped through the doors into the relative privacy of the entry hall, and a babble of voices rose behind him, almost washing him from the room on the tide of noise. He turned sharply to one side, to put solid stone at his back, and broke the seal on the scroll.
“Three lumps,” Harry responded, wondering as he did so how he’d ended up in this ludicrous position.
Percy, his face flushed a painful red, tried again. “I’m not intimidated by you, Malfoy! I hold a position of trust at the Ministry, and it’s my duty to report the use of
"I'm not insulting your family. I'm making an observation. Your father is not known for telling the truth when it doesn't suit him."
“I didn’t. I
He was working himself into a froth, and some of the Wizengamot began to shift impatiently in their seats. Fudge heard the rustling and abruptly reined himself in.
His defiant anger burnt out, he now sat brooding over what his own mistakes had wrought.
“You still should have told me. I’d never have let him get away with it.”
Draco looked up and around, his mouth open to demand an explanation, but Harry just tightened his hold on his love and pulled him into yet another searing kiss. This time, he did not hold back. He locked an arm around Draco’s waist, lifting him nearly off his feet, while his other hand guided his head, tilted it, held it so he could claim his mouth. His tongue pushed between Draco’s lips and deep into his mouth to plunder it. Draco moaned softly and the sound nearly pitched Harry into an orgasm, as public and inappropriate as the moment was. Just the fact that he held a heated and willing Draco in his arms after so long—his body pliant, his knee lifting to press into Harry’s thigh, his cock already hardening beneath the flimsy fabric of his old flannel pajamas—was almost enough to push him over the edge.
this?!" Fred demanded. "Be Kind to Animals week?"
Harry edged slightly away from the stretcher. He watched, glowering with as much pain as disapproval, while the healers carefully rolled Draco onto his side, then onto his stomach. At the sight of the wounds on his back, Harry flinched and ducked his head. But the moment the inert body was settled on the stretcher once more, he crowded up close.
“Control yourself, Cornelius. Narcissa is here at my invitation and under my protection.”
Dumbledore placed a warning hand on his arm. "Be patient, Harry. And stay calm."
A delighted grin lit his face. “Then you’re going to stay?”
“Murtlap essence and a salve of Dittany with silver,” Draco answered succinctly.
It felt strange to be in here, among the bits and pieces of a life about which Harry knew so little. Almost as if he were peering into the old nurse’s dreams. He cast another look around, then made his way to the nearest armchair and dropped into it.
“Nothing.” Harry quirked a wry, disbelieving smile at him, and he flushed. “I just need to keep busy, that’s all.”
He was perched on the extreme edge of the kitchen counter, arms looped around Harry’s neck and legs hooked high over his hips. His crossed ankles dug into Harry’s bum and pinned their naked loins together. Harry stood so close that he had to reach around Draco’s shoulders to get his spoon into the ice cream carton, an awkward arrangement that bothered neither of them, though it did give Draco an excuse to abuse him for his clumsiness.
to be in there!"
"No, you don't. Not yet. But as you experiment with it you will, and I must caution you to be very, very careful what you do."
no matter what crimes he may have committed, deserved what Warwick would do to Malfoy, if he got the chance.
Theo slouched into the room, looking sullen, with a pout on his lips that would once have driven Draco mad to kiss them. Now he just lifted a brow at his old friend, silently asking what his damage was. Theo draped himself artfully against the tall bedpost, and Draco recognized the deliberate attempt at seduction in the pose.
She shook her head, eyes fixed on the boy huddled in the bed. Dumbledore scooped up Draco, pulling him free of the blankets, and held him so that Madam Pomfrey could pour the potion down his throat, but Draco fought them mindlessly. It took all Dumbledore's strength to hold him, and Madam Pomfrey could not get the cup to his lips long enough to force the potion into him. Harry watched them struggle to restrain him with his fists knotted helplessly and a bubble of panic rising in him.
“I promise.
“But Potter wasn’t there!” someone called. “He couldn’t be the father!”
“You accept his word that he’s not using Dark magic, when you can see with your own eyes what it does to my defenseless son! So what if it has not been declared illegal?! So what if it does not bear the official label of Dark magic?! It has turned my son into a… a…”
"I'll show him what I think of his
“I’m sorry, Draco. I am.” Harry placed a hand on his thigh and gave it a squeeze. “But you know it’s true. That kidnapping business was the last straw. We have to put a stop to this before someone gets killed, because if they try to take Felix again, I
“Then how did you get in?”
“Fine,” Snape huffed, slumping back in his chair.
“It’s your family, Malfoy. You’re the one who’s been groomed to step into your father’s shoes and assume control of the family legacy—financial, social and magical—since you were a zygote. Hasn’t your father ever told you what that entails?”
Draco just stared at him, frozen. His eyes were open unnaturally wide, his pupils dilated with fear, his mouth now so dry that he could not swallow. The pleas for help kept spooling through his head, unheard and unanswered, while the man who had just bought him from his father stepped nearer.
“Never mind.” Draco turned away, reaching for the shirts hanging in the wardrobe. “I have to change.”
Draco didn’t bother to answer, just peeled one lump loose and popped it in his mouth.
He wanted anger. He wanted shouting and threats and furious accusations. He wanted
“Why not? It should have been yours all along.”
"It can't be..." Hermione protested.
“She opened her foul mouth.”
cases. If it was up to her, we’d still be staring at that Magical scan, wondering what the buggering fuck it was!”
Harry pressed a kiss to his forehead, murmuring, “Easy. Try to breathe.” Then, longingly, “May I hold you?”
“You don’t have to,” Draco whispered into Harry’s neck, even as he writhed at the feel of Harry’s finger working into him. “I don’t need it.”
“How did you leave things?” Harry asked, trying very hard not to laugh (more at Draco’s storytelling style than at his son’s mishap, which was not particularly funny). “Does McGonagall believe it was an accident?”
"He can't be alive," Hermione said.
When he blinked his eyes back into focus at last, Harry found Dumbledore gazing at him thoughtfully. Power still flashed and glittered behind his eyes, blurring his vision and throwing a kind of halo of gold sparks around Dumbledore's white head, and ran smoothly through the Blood Link. Malfoy lay still, curled on his side, his long hair tumbled over his face, his breath coming slowly and evenly. Harry could not explain how, but he knew that Draco was asleep.
“You… you…
“As long as I’ve known them, my lad, and that’s most of our lives.”
*** *** ***
,” he moaned.
… yes.” The book settled in her lap, thankfully hiding Lockhart’s hex-worthy face. Meanwhile, Molly’s face had turned a bright shade of pink that clashed outrageously with her ginger hair. “I’m looking for a spell to remove grubs from Flutterby bushes, and he’s quite the expert on household pests.”
“Yes, Madam Hooch,” Hermione said respectfully.
He was tired—that much was evident at a glance—so tired that he gladly spent hours of his day just lying on the settee with his head in Harry’s lap, doing nothing but breathing in the other man’s scent. But the shadows under his eyes were not the stark, ugly, purple hollows that had marred his face for so long. They were softer, warmer, more transitory, promising that enough sleep and food and care from his doting husband would finally erase them. Because this was not the face of Colin the Prostitute.
“That’s all right. Nero won’t notice. But he particularly likes this one, and he’ll murder me if I destroy it.”
“I just…” His fingers toyed with Draco’s hair and his gaze darkened. “I don’t want you to feel like you have to, you know…
Draco blocked out their unwelcome stares, concentrating on the firm pressure of Harry’s hand and the warmth he always drew from his husband’s nearness. He wasn’t ashamed of who or what he was. Wasn’t ashamed to walk hand-in-hand with another man,
“Right. They didn’t want to do anything so crude or demeaning as to disown him. He was still a wizard in good standing, from impeccable family, after all. But they had to sever the magical connection to one family before they could form it with the other.”
“Bellatrix is dead. She was killed at Hogwarts more than three years ago.”
He looked down to find Rose and Hugo regarding him expectantly. Rose spoke with a politeness she only ever employed with her exotic and awe-inspiring uncle.
When Draco gave no answer, just looked from the wand to Potter and back again, he went on, “If the only thing you wanted from me was my protection, then take your wand and go. You don’t need me anymore. But if you want something more… something I can give you… Well, you know how I feel. If I had my way, you’d stay forever...
“Harry.” His level glare made Harry stop in mid-chew and brought a faint flush to his cheeks. “Are you telling me that Weasel is downstairs right now? In our kitchen?
Hermione scoffed at that, rolling her eyes. “Wizards don’t see elves. Or their magic.”
"I did, but only for your protection. You may have it back when we're certain that you're on the mend."
drive his husband mad with lust. In fact, it would drive him a whole different kind of mental.
“Now see what you’ve done, Potter? Couldn’t leave well enough—or
He'd tried to tell Draco twice already, but both times he'd gone to the hospital wing, he'd found Malfoy asleep and Potter still there. Snape would be easy to find - his office was right down the hall - but Crabbe wasn't entirely sure which side Snape was on, and he was afraid to show him something this important. What if Snape decided to help Mr. Malfoy? What if Draco
As he stepped into the entry hall, Minerva McGonagall and Alastor Moody appeared from their places to either side of the front doors. Both held their wands, and McGonagall looked haggard with strain. Moody's face was too heavily scarred to reflect any emotion. Dumbledore gave them a slightly weary smile and headed for the Great Hall.
“That’s quite enough out of you, Arthur,” Draco snapped (always a danger signal when Draco used his actual name). “Why are you covered in porridge?”
His face kept shifting. Blurring. The lips thinning ’til they disappeared and the nose flattening…
“Harry taught me to make it.”
"But…"
“So you started using drugs back at the Manor?”
“Draco doesn’t do well with beds. He’ll be more comfortable here.”
“Yes,” Harry replied, even as his hand petted Draco’s hair in silent apology. “I need a potion to sober us up. Clear our heads. Do we have anything like that in the house?”
“Listen very carefully, Mr. Malfoy. We have explained your isolation—both from the school at large and from Lord Voldemort’s spell—as necessary for your recovery. As far as your parents know, you’re under a stasis charm to keep you from doing permanent damage to your brain. This means that you can’t speak or move.”
“I want to go home.”
“Not unless we catch her with the stolen memories in her possession…
What could possibly keep them from… Oh.” Once again, the light dawned. “The Vow.”
When he stuck his head into the green flames, he saw the shabby, cluttered, homey sitting room where he and Harry had drunk endless toasts to their marriage on Christmas Eve. It was empty now and looking more threadbare than ever in the grey light.
“Fascinating. Let’s see how our little Potter is doing.”
Draco flushed still more furiously and tried to pull away, but her grip was like iron.
"There yeh are, Harry. I was startin' ter worry."
"What?" Ron demanded, his voice cracking with alarm.
“Don’t say it,” Harry chided, his head coming up sharply.
Fields glowed green and gold and poppy-red in the mellow sunshine. Trees rustled on a slight breeze. Birds twittered in the hedgerows. Bees zipped from flower to flower, legs fat with pollen. Rabbits nosed in the grass and voles poked sleek heads from their burrows. It was perfect. So perfect that it might have been plucked from Draco’s childhood memories and brought to life just for him.
“This is the price of fame, my boy. You are a hero to them. Well, let’s face it, you’re a hero period. And most of them went to the island today for you.”
Whew! Thank you SO MUCH for your response to the last chapter! It felt good when I was writing it, and I'm delighted that it read well, too!
to be hexed.
"That's something, anyway."
Returning to the bed, he bent over Draco and murmured, “Hallo, beautiful.”
"Can't do that. Headmaster's orders." The cold eyes glinted nastily at him. "And I am honor-bound to serve the present Headmaster, whatever my personal feelings in the matter."
“If you’d like to join me in my office,” the Headmaster was saying, his voice retreating down the ward with the sound of booted feet on marble.
As he spoke, Warwick nodded toward something beyond the bars of his cell, prompting Draco to turn and look. He saw a passage as cheerless, grim and punishing as his cell, lit by smoking torches. Identical barred openings lined it, most of which showed curious faces peering out at him. One such face was pressed to the bars of the cell directly opposite his, watching him with a hunger that made Draco’s blood run cold and his stomach clench.
“Kind of has to be, doesn’t it?”
“I think you’ve been listening to Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, which is always dangerous.”
many?” Harry demanded.
“Seriously?” Draco cocked a disbelieving eyebrow at him. “You’re not going to let this go?”
“That’s enough!” Marchbanks snapped, cutting him off. When she had reduced Lucius to seething silence, she went on coldly, “This is not about your son’s choice of partner or his mode of dress. If you cannot stick to the subject at hand…”
He had Potter to thank for the plait-cum-teething ring. Draco had started the day with his hair pulled back in a neat queue, but Potter hated it when Draco wore his hair that way, claiming it made him look too much like his father. He had taken one look at the queue, smiled sadly, drawn his wand, and transformed it into a soft, gleaming plait that lay on Draco’s shoulder and hung halfway down his chest. Knowing the birthday girl’s fondness for bright colors, he’d added threads of silver and royal purple. Then he’d pocketed his wand and slipped his arms around Draco’s waist to plant a lingering kiss to his lips, murmuring, “That’s the ticket.”
Dumbledore moved over to Harry and held out a hand to pull him up. Harry was surprised to find that Dumbledore was solid, and when he clasped the old wizard's offered hand, he could feel the texture of his skin and the brush of his velvet sleeve. Dumbledore helped him up, then drew him back a step to give them both a wide view of the tiny room.
Could it be? Would Potter really be that careless?
Harry turned abruptly at that, breakfast forgotten in hope and curiosity. “Really? How do you know?”
chat, mind you – but keep the Dark Lord out of it. We hear quite enough of him, as it is."
"Can I... can I talk to Harry about it?"
The Harry lying spread-eagled on the bed while Draco stripped him naked, was no longer gawky and graceless. Gone were the bony wrists, the awkward limbs, the starved and sun-deprived look of a child raised in a cupboard. This Harry was strong and sure and powerful. Long-limbed, square-shouldered, hard-muscled. And still so beautiful that it hurt Draco to look at him.
“Come on, Malfoy, pull yourself together. Drink this.”
The Dementor hesitated, confused by the glittering thing that blocked him from his lawful prey, and Voldemort snarled, "Finish it! At once!"
“Not completely. We have a general idea where the cunt is hiding. And he can’t stay behind the wards forever, especially not if he wants to hunt down his next victim. Sooner or later, he’ll come out. Sooner or later, he’ll use his wand and we’ll have him. We almost did last night, but he only used it to apparate back behind the wards, so we never had a chance to move on him.”
The title of this chapter comes from the David Bowie song of the same name. It’s a wonderful, dark, atmospheric song about an androgynous singer, and it was the inspiration for this entire story. There’s a sample of the lyrics at the beginning of the chapter.
“I wanted to smell and feel that gorgeous leather against my face.”
"I'm not going to see the Headmaster by myself."
Mrs. Weasley shook her head in dismay. "Dumbledore should have kept you here, where Arthur and I could look after you."
That blazing, beautiful grin that never failed to turn Draco’s bones to water lit Harry’s face. “For starters, yeah.”
Harry took the envelope, his pulse suddenly jumping with excitement.
“Working.”
“I don’t!”
"Ah, it is time," Dumbledore said, his eyes beginning to twinkle again. He balanced his box on one hand and reached for the doorknob with the other. "Remember, Harry, stay calm and leave the talking to me." Then he pushed the great door open, and they walked into the Wizengamot dungeon.
“I was trying to
He had no idea how long it took Harry to come, buried deep inside him. It may have been a minute. It may have been a day. All that mattered was that, when he came back to himself, he found Harry Potter moving between his thighs, filling him, using him. It hurt like holy hell, but he never wanted it to stop. Then he felt Harry stiffen, his body clench, his cock jump, and suddenly Draco’s body was full of a marvelous slippery heat. The pain was gone.
"We were worried about you," Hermione said, a touch of acid in her voice. "You left the tower this morning, before anyone could talk to you, and you didn't come to class." Hefting the pile of books in her arms, she added, "I thought you might want your homework, just to keep busy…"
“Why?”
So Draco was now Exhibit A in the criminal case against half the DMLE. As if being the most hated man in Wizarding Britain were not enough. Everyone from Gawain Robards to the Chief Warlock would be clamoring to interview him, and Harry would have to protect him from them.
“That’s where Aysgarth died. Apparently, he fled Britain after Voldemort’s death to avoid anti-Pureblood prejudice. The cunt. Anyway, I need to see the crime scene, talk to the Croatian authorities, and collect the body.”
Harry chuckled, though there was no humor in Draco’s rasping voice. “Either you eat for me, or I get Hermione to bully you into it. What’ll it be?”
Dumbledore found himself looking at a perfect copy of Draco Malfoy lying in his mother’s arms. His mouth sagged open in shock, and for once in his long, brilliant career, he was completely bereft of words.
Hawthorn and Unicorn Hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. The wand that had won him the allegiance of the Elder wand and defeated Lord Voldemort. Draco Malfoy’s wand… maybe.
Harry glared at him for another beat, then turned back to Draco and reached out to clasp his cold fingers. “Talk to you later?”
He fetched up between Harry’s sprawled legs, crouched on elbows and knees, head bent over his enraged cock. It was gorgeous. And so hungry. He thought of holding it on his tongue and his lips swelled in anticipation.
“Almost done,” Draco called from the other room, his voice muffled by whatever he was doing to himself.
Mustering some vestige of his old snarkiness, Draco lifted an eyebrow at him and took a sip of water.
Harry glanced over the report and, like Ron, couldn’t help laughing at what he read. “He seriously claims that
“It’s… well… I meant to tell you all about it yesterday, but we got sidetracked…”
“How about the second one? And the third and fourth and…”
"I'm missing something," Ron said. "You
“Home, Potter. Now!”
A murmur of speculation ran through the crowd, until Harry took a step forward and fixed the wizard with a quelling stare.
"He wanted me. He ordered Draco to bring me to him."
“Where did you get her?” he finally asked.
“I’m afraid not, darling,” Narcissa said, with unruffled calm and a just hint of disapproval. She reached into her sleeve, pulled out her wand, and gave it a twitch. Draco felt magic in air but couldn’t identify the spell. “Now, sit down, drink your tea, and behave yourself.”
Dumbledore turned to smile at Harry, catching him with an agonized grimace on his face. His eyes twinkled knowingly at the embarrassed boy. Then he turned back to Draco, eyebrows raised.
“I told you.” Harry pulled an envelope from his back pocket and held it out to Draco. “This was with it.”
That earned him a muffled snort of laughter.
"He didn't know Crabbe would give Professor Dumbledore the letter!" Hermione protested, drawing all eyes to her and earning her a burning glare from Snape.
Dazed faces lifted to him.
“I made him leave, because the complex magic that has protected him since his parents’ death required it. I kept him away all summer, because we had concealment spells in place that would prevent Voldemort’s spies from locating him, and I wanted to delay the moment when he came into the open, as it were, by returning to the one place where anyone can find him. Now he’s here, and he’s in as much danger as you are and under the same restrictions.”
that you love your job. I’m so proud
The Knut dropped in Harry’s brain.
He opened his mouth to speak, then he saw Dumbledore holding his finger to his lips. Fumbling in his pocket, he grabbed the charm in its little, velvet bag and held it out to the Headmaster. Dumbledore shook his head and reached out to close Harry's fingers around it again.
“Mother.” She closed her mouth and looked enquiringly at him. “What’s going on?”
“It’s not something I can just hand over. It’s more…”
“I won’t go to the Wizengamot with this, if that’s what you’re thinking. I won’t force your hand in any way. I just won’t come back to work as long as Robards is here.”
McGonagall... For crying out loud, Hermione! He's even got Madam Pomfrey going loopy over him! I saw her give him a chocolate frog and pat him on the head. I swear it. It made me so sick I almost threw up. Nice old Madam Pomfrey patting Malfoy on the head!
Draco grumbled something under his breath and sped toward the high benches, leaving Harry to pelt after him. He was moving too fast for a clean stop when he reached the stands, but at the last second, he pulled the nose of his broomstick sharply upward and executed a tricky sort of stalling technique that resulted in his broomstick flipping out from under him and his feet slamming down on the uppermost bench. Draco caught the broom easily, swung it to his shoulder, and turned to watch Harry make a more conventional landing in smirking silence.
"I do not!" Ron protested, then his words died away into frantic mumbles again.
"It is a tool used in times of critical need to channel power from one wizard to another. It can only be formed between wizards who have the same blood in their veins."
For the new and improved version, see
“And he’s imprisoned a number of our allies there, already,” McGonagall pointed out. “If we attack the prison, they become a liability to Voldemort. Either he ties up his forces guarding them, or he surrenders them to us and they fight on our side.”
Dumbledore halted his move to turn away and gazed politely down at the other wizard.
“We’ll entertain any and all theories,” Dumbledore said, bringing all eyes back to him again. “I want to hear your ideas, no matter how crackpot they may seem. And let me know if you hear anything useful about the school. Our students often know more than we suspect, and if anyone inside Hogwarts had a hand in this, someone may let it slip. In the meantime, we have families to notify.”
If Mrs. Black were still alive, what would she do to this name? Harry wondered. What curses would she heap on Draco's silver-blond head? What terrible revenge would she take for his act of betrayal? Harry felt a gnawing desire to pull out his wand and burn Draco's name from the tapestry himself, cutting that golden thread and all that it stood for, setting him free. Draco did not belong to them anymore. He did not belong among that collection of murderers and madmen.
“At least let him try.”
She fairly shuddered with delight, as the Dark Lord set the piece of sculpture in her outstretched palm.
When Harry began to fuss with the pleats over his belly, Draco gave him a sardonic smile and murmured, “Thanks, Mum. May I go?”
“I’m still not satisfied. I don’t want him in this castle.”
* * *
Draco nodded his thanks and went through the familiar motions. When the tea was ready, he turned the cup to grasp the handle. The chip was now on the outside. He smiled slightly to himself and took a sip.
There it was. The bald truth staring him in the face. He could save Draco from his parents but only by breaking his trust.
Thankfully, she didn’t ask why he’d felt the need to tear down the greenhouse. She was still focused on the Manor. “What about everything inside it? The family portraits and the furniture?”
Draco lifted a hand to touch his face and draw him down into another chaste kiss. When Harry pulled back just a little, he murmured, “You going to arrest my parents?”
Strong hands caught his shoulders and pushed him away. Green eyes blazed angrily at him. The lips that had, just moments before, reduced him to jelly with their kisses now hardened in an uncompromising frown.
“Don’t say that ’til you read the card.”
“I still say that Ferret should disinherit him,” Ron insisted.
Draco froze. His breath caught.
“But you don’t have to keep him in a cell while you’re doing it.”
"That was my Gran," Theo said, her voice full of awe.
“Actually, he’ll pitch a fit, but I don’t care.” Harry grinned at the Headmaster with unfeigned delight. “I’m Perfect Bloody Potter, and I always get what I want.”
Ron cast a longing look at the bakery, his mouth watering at the thought of all those muffins and scones. Then he heard Malfoy’s stomach rumble. He glanced over at the man and saw that he was shivering, his bare arms and midriff looking blue-white with cold in the pre-dawn light. He was also holding his left arm very stiffly, with the forearm pressed to his side.
Harry obediently dropped the ribbon that he had been running through his fingers. Draco picked up the ring and looked at it glumly, his eyes seeming more shadowed and tired than ever.
"Oh, I hated you, right enough. You spat in my face and walked away. I swore I was going to make you regret it."
“Our first victim, Phineas Boggs.” He leaned over the seated man again, his posture threatening even if his question was mild enough. “How do you know him?”
“And Auntie Audrey? And Auntie Luna? And…”
“I need you close to me.”
“Hm. Well, if that’s your position, then I need you to do something before you leave today.”
moving back down the crooked hallway toward him. In fact, he was nearly asleep, his eyes closed and his breaths slowing, when Molly’s voice broke in on him again.
At least he could assume that Cho was sincere.
“Oh, bother.”
are the forces that defeated Voldemort, not yours. Not the Ministry of Magic or her fearless leader.
Hermione’s gaze shifted over to Draco and notably softened. “What exactly did they tell you when you confronted them?”
When the students didn’t move, he produced his wand and waved it, making all the textbooks lying open on their desks slam shut. Ten bodies jumped as if shocked, then began, reluctantly, to shuffle to their feet.
He lifted his wand again, sending Draco scrambling away to the foot of the bed, babbling, “He doesn’t like your magic! He wants his father!”
“In case you haven’t noticed, we’re the only ones
“And?” Harry prompted, biting into a cucumber sandwich.
“Of course I trust you.”
Ron gave him a saucy smile. “Too bad you can’t do magic, then, innit?”
When she was gone, Harry started stripping off his clothes. He fumbled with buttons and zips, clumsy in his exhaustion, but the promise of a soft bed and Draco sleeping beside him kept him at it until he’d shed the last piece of clothing. Dropping his socks on the floor, he crawled beneath the quilts and burrowed into a down pillow.
“Yeah, but he’s a nutter, mate.”
“Mount up!” Draco froze, his finger still leveled at Harry’s nose and his mouth open in shock. “Go on, you mount first. I’ll sit in front this time.” Catching Draco by the arm, Harry guided him over to where the Firebolt hung patiently in the air, waiting for them. “Hang on, it’s a little high for you.”
“Contact Molly. She’ll relay the message.”
Croaker gazed at the photo for another handful of heartbeats, then mused, “He’s very striking. Not someone I could ignore or—I would have said—forget, and yet I have not a flicker of recognition when I look at him. Attraction, yes, it would be foolish to deny it, but no recognition.” He looked up at Ron, his eyes bright and sharp with curiosity. “And this is the man responsible for the Memory Thief crimes?”
"No." With that one word, Draco's throat unclenched and his body went limp with relief. He gasped aloud, as the air rushed back into his lungs. "I don't care what you believe, and I won't expose Draco to your anger for no better reason than to satisfy your stubborn pride."
“Fancy that.” Draco tried to detach himself from Pansy, to escape to his dormitory, but she held on like a limpet.
“You will regret this.”
She shrugged. “He won’t say it, but I assume so.”
He edged even closer and bent to murmur directly into Draco’s ear, “Let me make you feel that way again. Please. Just climb into the tub, lie back, relax and trust me.”
Guided by Harry, Draco carried the cat over to the settee and took his usual place in the corner closest to the fire. He drew his feet up onto the cushions, settled Abraxas on his lap and began to stroke the cat. Harry perched on the edge of the seat next to him.
"Yes, Professor." Neville flushed under Dumbledore's kindly gaze and ducked his head. He said goodbye to Harry hurried out of the room in Hermione's wake, leaving Harry alone with Dumbledore.
Harry stared at him for a moment, then blurted out, "Do you always pick disguises that look like the Minister of Magic?"
"Come on, Ron."
She promptly laid her wand across his palm, then, to Dumbledore’s surprise, reached into her robe again and brought out yet another black bundle. Without a word, she thrust it out to him.
“Oi! Mate!” Ron called happily. “The Christmas Gnomes have arrived!”
and a picture of Draco sitting in the hearing, stroking his belly and smiling.
After a long, quiet moment, Draco took a ragged breath and whispered, "I thought something was wrong. You just sat there, laughing, and didn't…"
Draco appeared in the doorway, looking faintly rumpled and entirely beautiful. He paused to take in his grinning husband, his wide-eyed son, and the cardboard box. A smile tilted his lips.
“I didn’t want to invite you here. I only did it to keep the peace. And I expected our little tea party to be a disaster.”
“But it’s been
Harry flushed. “I know that. And I appreciate it, honestly, but Draco isn’t up for visitors.”
"I wasn't much of a hero today."
what you mean. And I think I will have a chat with your auntie before I go. But one more thing, and this is
Every eye now fixed on Draco Malfoy, and the room fell eerily quiet.
"Come along, Harry. We have work to do."
“I further propose that we reserve the right to pass sentence on the Malfoys for violating a Wizengamot order, attempted kidnapping, filing false charges, perjury, and any other charges that may arise upon closer examination of the facts, after we have a clearer picture of their mental competence.
“Yes.”
“Shh.”
"Oh, give over, Cornelius. You're going to send Potter off in an apoplexy if you keep this up. Just tell him what we've decided and put the poor boy out of his misery."
So why did the very sight of him make Harry long to hex him into next week? Maybe it had something to do with the fact that Robards had been appointed Head Auror by Scrimgeour and had held onto the position through Voldemort’s return to power—neither of which facts imbued Harry with trust.
“He was the first one to go,” Lavender pointed out, “so he must have given it to the rest of them.”
"Your duty is to care for the child. Your grandchild, Narcissa. Her life is in your hands, and if you fail me in this,
“Or green,” he added.
Snape paused, then shook his head. "You need to get back there, Potter. Now."
Hagrid grunted. "That oughtta make Bane happy."
He found Dumbledore alone in the tower room. The Headmaster was placing something in a huge, brass-bound trunk that hovered a few inches above the surface of his desk. He favored Harry with a smile and waved him over.
“Worse than Snape!”
Both of them knew that this pleasant pattern could not go on indefinitely. If nothing else, they must find time to study or risk flunking their N.E.W.T.s, as Hermione so frequently reminded Harry. But so far, neither had been able to resist temptation and stay in his own dormitory for the night. Harry was about to change that. He could not face the cold and wet of the tower roof, even from inside a warming spell, and he could not face Professor Snape in Potions tomorrow without his essay written. That meant telling Malfoy that he couldn't meet him on the roof later. And
