"Episkey. But wouldn't be a licenced healer be better for that?"
Apparating was out of the question since, despite the house obviously having been torn apart by the explosion, the wards were still active. Blasting their way out was not feasible either since they did not know how much rumble was piled over their heads. That left, "Kreacher? Kreacher!"
Immensely relieved about how his liege had handled the situation, the former Lord offered a deep bow and confirmed, "Yes, my Lord."
"Are you alright?"
Taking in the picture, the nervous Hufflepuff who seemed so unsure if he was supposed to stand behind or in front of Ginny when facing her family, the head of the family nodded to himself. Yes, his little girl has made the right decision with her future spouse. "Ginevra, growing up as the seventh child could not have been easy. However, outside of bad external influences," Arthur could not help but glower at Lucius Malfoy for a moment, "and incredibly protective friends," he nodded towards Harry, "I was never worried about you. As soon as you were able to hold your first wand, Bill's for the most part, it was clear that you would become an incredibly strong and talented witch. You grew up in your brothers' shadows, but today you shine all the more for it. Tonight, you bring us not only a friend but your future husband, so please, join your mother and Bill in our circle, to complete it."
Quietly, Harry decided, "You are lucky."
"That's what you think? That I humiliated you in front of your family and my friends on purpose, to drive the point home that I am in charge?"
Taking a deep breath, Neville turned towards his colleague, "Auror Pince, would you give us a minute?"
"I want to thank each and every one of you, for taking their time to celebrate this Winter Solstice with us. Long have we ignored our traditions. Forgotten that our bond with the earth of Albion is what gives us power. Today marks a change, the beginning of a new life-circle that, while still lying dormant, will undoubtedly bless us with new life this upcoming year." Lowering his arms, he smiled, looking at his muggle-born daughter in law and his youngest son, who stood wrapped around her protectively. Then he let his eyes travel over family, friends and guests in attendance.
Most others took the shot, and Harry was ready to refill Draco's glass, when the blond slowly unbuttoned his shirt, revealing a scar that ran from his stomach to the middle of his chest. Slowly tracing it, he shared, "This scar I received as defence of an unwarranted attack. It was not caused by sadistic intent and the person honestly regretted it afterwards. It's basically the only mark on my body that I don't abhor."
Horrified, Harry bent back over his parchment. "Right. Finishing this. I want to be out of here before lunch!"
--O-O--
"This is Augusta Longbottom, I think our children are in trouble."
"Shut it!" His partner ordered, throwing a balled-up napkin. He was placated when Luna offered a mouth full of the delicious dish, captivated by his beautiful fiancée.
"Can't we just … I don't know … find a substitute, so my godson won't
"Har…, Har…, Har…"
Prepared for his sneaky elf, Harry had kept his back to the door. Now he pushed off and composed a small note. "Give this to Lucius please."
"Grey blobs," Ron explained drily.
When Ron returned the glare, obviously furious at the implication that he had not done his very best to try and protect his friend, Hermione's chuckle from the door cut through the tension. "Have you met Harry, professor? It is easier to have a hippogriff do household chores, than convince Harry Potter that he is not responsible for the safety of our entire world."
people. But then we were convicted and put under house arrest … it beats being locked up in Azkaban any time, but who would want to be looked after by a former Death Eater?"
"No!"
"How do you know about Remus being a werewolf?"
That was not toeing the line of legality but using it as a jumping rope. However, Harry was the last person who had the right to judge. Hence, he merely tilted his head. "Thank you. I owe you one."
"And not only your family, I imagine."
Quietly, Lucius had shaken his head. "No, I … thank you."
"I bought him a new cauldron since his was already worn down."
--O-O--
"Good morning, sunshines," Ron boomed, falling onto the bench, reaching for the tea.
"Now, think about Cho Chang."
Despite all the evidence, Lucius shook his head. "But it's a children's story. You can't expect me to believe that Harry … my liege, possesses all Deathly Hallows, making him the Master of Death."
--O-O--
Teddy nodding off over his juice, had Harry yawn, "Thank god," gently pulling his godson into his arms before the boy could slip from the chair. At the blond's inquiring gaze, he explained tiredly, "Teddy's always completely wired on the days he sleeps here. So, we get up, have a cup of tea and then take a nap before breakfast." Scrutinizing Draco for a heartbeat, he suggested, "You should join us."
Pince, however, cut him off, "Longbottom?"
Studying the Auror, Severus sneered, "Had you paid attention as one would expect from an Auror of your calibre, you would have understood that I live here. So, where I spend my time is nobody's concern but mine and Mr Potter's. Now excuse me. " And with that, he swiped out the door.
Pondering over the absurd description of his owner's activities, she followed the elf, finding Harry doing precisely as Kreacher had predicted. The young man was kneeling in a corner, hovering next to what seemed to be a heating shaft. Kreacher drew his attention by mumbling under his breath, "Graceless half−blood, kneeling in a dusty corner of his own home. Undignified wizard!"
"To return me to Azkaban, of course. I can hardly expect you to …"
“Hermione,” he interrupted her rant, making her look up at the uncharacteristic urgency in his tone. “I need your help.”
It was past midnight when Draco finally closed the door to the attic. He now had a good overview of the equipment, had sorted all available ingredients to his liking. All the while he had held on to his wand so tightly, his fingers were now aching. Rotating every little jar with magic might have taken more time than sorting them by hand, but it had been infinitely more satisfying. Once he was through, though, he had no reason to remain, so he hesitatingly left the lab, trudging down the stairs.
"On Saturday, just before midnight," Harry clarified in a dead voice.
“To the Ministry of course.”
Spitting and hissing, Jenkins called one of their office-workers to get Narcissa's wand out of evidence lock-up. Five minutes later, the young witch returned. "I'm sorry, Sir, but it's not there."
"Trying to braid my hair around the combe Harry made for me."
--O-O--
"Long story."
Grinning, because the idea of her and Draco as a couple seemed so very absurd, she replied, "Sorry to say that, but your son was a snotty, little bastard at Hogwarts. It would have never worked."
"And the 'Saviour of the Wizarding World' could not get around that requirement?"
He examined his physical and mental state before nodding, yet instead of assuring her, the next words out of his mouth were, "Interview conducted on the 6
With professionalism he never would have thought Potter capable of, the young man reached around him and pulled Severus' torso against his own. Then he exchanged the pillows, and when the patient leaned against his new backrest, he was considerably more comfortable. With a snap of her tiny fingers, the elf brought the tray Emilia had used for meals, and carefully set down his cup. Then she beamed at Harry.
−−O−O−−
The curator of the British Museum (magical section as well) and, funny enough,
"Right, sorry. Yes or No questions only. Fine, let's try this one: Are you in pain?"
"I don't expect you to," Narcissa reached out and gently touched Harry's cold hands. "But our people won't change their beliefs, just because all Death Eaters and supporters of Lord Voldemort are gone. You want acceptance for muggleborn and creatures? You have to work for it. You're in the unique position to actually change something. True, the light-families will do no harm, not compared to what you have been through. But their political power, if you can convince them of your ideas, can certainly make a difference. For that, however, you have to make yourself available, exceeding monthly columns in The Quibbler. You need to talk to people. That's what these invitations are for."
Tensing, the born Black witch gracefully sank to her knees in front of the floo. "Lady Longbottom, you have my undivided attention."
Filling a tea−pot with the steaming liquid, Draco arranged everything on a tray, while Harry produced a few cucumber sandwiches, using magic to speed up the process. Everybody could see how much Andromeda longed to return to her sister. Handing it over, the blond dared to ask, "How does Teddy know about me, let alone that I helped Harry at the Manor and that we turned our backs on the Dark Lord in the final battle?" The boy had explained in detail what he had learned about his uncle, before starting with his story about Draco's constellation.
"Twenty minutes. He just needs twenty more minutes. Then things will be better."
"Back with us again, Severus?"
Shrugging, the young man explained, “Sometimes the fire dies, though there is plenty of wood available. Oh, and in every room but Sirius’ the floorboards creak and groan when I try to sleep there.”
The blond caught up with Harry just outside the kitchen. Balancing the tray, the Auror wanted to know, "Were you able to talk some sense into her? Is she going to file a report?"
Wondering how he had let himself get caught up in such a surreal situation, the former professor leaned over until he was nose to nose with the little girl. "I am a part-time tooth-fairy. I don't need wings. During the day, I work as a Potion Master."
"Of course, you're not. His rooms are up there."
Massaging the bridge of his nose, the Head Auror explained, "Because a house-elf is literally incapable of revealing any information his Master or Mistress have ordered him to keep secret! It's not even a question of 'want', he simply can't!"
Bursting into the cellar, Ron shouted again,
However, despite his glare, Neville seemed relaxed, amused even; a far stretch from the jittery child he had been. He chuckled under his breath, apparently not feeling insulted by the insinuation. "They gave me an Order of Merlin 1
Nodding, the raven-haired gestured towards the few books he kept in his office. "If you don't want to work, feel free to help yourself to any book that strikes your fancy."
--O-O--
Ron lectured, "Blackberries are black, obviously, but I have never tried the white ones."
"Of course not," she smiled, petting the huge horse that nuzzled her shoulder affectionately. "You are the patriarch of a noble and ancient house. It would hardly be suitable for you to ride anyone but him."
"Hello, Harry," she beamed joyously, rummaging through her bag, producing a small bottle with a red liquid. "I brought you cherry−juice with a hint of cardamom and camphor. It will help your head to get better since you're leaving tomorrow."
Swallowing through a constricting throat, Draco nodded. "Alright."
“No?” The raven-haired inquired, composedly. “And why should I believe anything you say after you have so clearly violated my privacy?"
A warm chuckle drew his attention, and in a Herculean effort, Severus managed to turn his head. The witch who stood on the right side of his bed was unknown to him. Yet, she felt somewhat familiar. Especially her voice, when she berated softly, "What he needs, Poppy, is for you to give him a moment. The man was in a coma for five years. Everybody would need time after that."
"Well … first, there was Albus Dumbledore's will. While he was not overly wealthy, and most of his money went to Aberforth, several thousand gallons were given to you. I take it you haven't come here, after … after the Astronomy Tower?" Harry more felt than saw his former professor shaking his head. The man was not ready for this conversation yet, so he continued, "Then there was Lucius. They did not have much time after the final battle before the Aurors caught up to them and all Malfoy assets were frozen. However, he managed to make a substantial deposit to your, respectively Draco's account. Just shy of ten-thousand gallons, since he knew such 'minor' investments would not be scrutinised too closely. The Malfoys are worth millions after all. And finally, …"
"Lucius, put that down!" Harry ordered forcefully when he recognised the markings on the cup in his vassal's hand. Contrary to the pure−blood, he could identify the drink by the code on the side.
"To Malfoy." Was the general chorus that followed that speech and at first, the pureblood felt overwhelmed by the acknowledgement and acceptance of these people, who really ought to have only have heard the worst of him so far. That he lacked displaying the expected reaction became obvious, when the bushy−haired witch at his side nudged him and instructed, "Toast them and drink."
Schooling his expression, Kingsley looked at the young Auror, "Mr Longbottom, can you tell me where the sun will rise?"
Taking an aborted step forward, the blond wizard whispered hoarsely, "That's my wand."
"White wine, please."
Smiling, not at all uncomfortable as every snake in the vicinity turned their heads to look at him, Harry promised,
After trading a brief glance, the older wizard started, "The anchor-point of the spell should be right here, from what Longbottom and Potter have told us. But it isn't. It's several stories down."
"I hate … dat inane book. Choose someth … some …"
"Pardon," Narcissa interrupted their quiet contemplation. "But what are you talking about?"
Why wouldn't anybody help him? He reached out, screamed for help, but neither his voice, nor his body seemed to obey his commands. Thrashing helplessly, he felt like a fish out of water.
"No, I didn't," the young Auror admitted. "Snape did."
Robarts had already organised the incarceration of the surviving cultists and called upon healers for the wounded. Miracle over miracle, none of the helpers had been hurt beyond a seasoned healer's abilities, mostly thanks to the impromptu armour and the somewhat eclectic, but protective gear that had been generously distributed amongst them. When the Head Auror stepped up to Harry and Neville, he studied their group. "Things will go significantly smoother if all those without a Ministry salary leave now."
Relieved, Harry sagged back into his chair. He had not realised until now, how much he had needed his best friends' approval in this. Now he felt drained but still put up a token-protest when Hermione ordered. "Now, you go back to bed or the office and I will do some research!"
The wand flew out of Lostrife's hand and bounced off their shield. Auror Robarts was beside them in an instant, stupefying the convicted Death Eater before turning towards Malfoy with burning eyes. "When did you get a new wand?" He reached out to take the cane but was repelled by the shield.
Thinking back to their conversation, Draco shook his head. "She offered marriage and an heir, and even to move to Malfoy Manor once the baby was born."
"Why would you say that?"
--O-O--
Unsure if she was allowed to talk to the prisoners beyond her duties, but too polite to ignore her betters, the elf wrung her hands, nodding reluctantly, "Yes, Miss."
"This is how I expect to see you every morning. Once your appearance is flawless, we can work on your behavior." Rising, she ruffled his hair on the way out, commenting, "Oh, and clean up your room. This … post-apocalyptic chic is very off-putting. Have a good day, my little gem."
"It's nearly midnight," Hermione cautioned.
"Harry," his father's gentle tone made him look up. "Son, I know you hate Peter. And from what you've told us, you have every right. Just … just maybe try to see the situation from his point of view. He was so brave at Hogwarts. He became an illegal animagus just to help Remus, though he was terrified. But when the real enemy came, when Voldemort targeted him, he was all alone. I abandoned him to protect my family. And Remus and Sirius did the same."
Then she stepped over his petrified body and entered the house. A moment later, Inari emerged from … somewhere, and after sniffing Harry curiously, she climbed his petrified body and rolled up on his chest for a little nap.
Harry merely raised his cup, replying in equal.
Holding both hands over hers, Harry asked excitedly, "Did he just …?"
All too aware of Draco's faint trembling, Harry shook his head. "No, the Winter Solstice is a time for celebrating with the family, and you are now family by proxy. Molly insisted I bring you along."
"And what are you doing here?" Leewood wanted to know. "Until now, all you have done was hiding in the shadows and insulting Potter. Quite an accomplishment for a dead man, I admit, but in no way helpful. I thought the Malfoys were your friends." He glanced towards Narcissa, who sat pale but composed in one of the armchairs in front of the fireplace.
Wordlessly, Draco nodded. Then, he slowly turned towards Ron, as if anxious that Shacklebolt would chain him down any second, and advised, "Why don't you put him to bed. I'll bring the potions in a minute."
Glancing towards the garden, the young wizard shrugged. "It serves Harry right. Lying bastard! Kept me in the dark for five years and then even had the audacity to ask me for potion ingredients without explaining why. I know the Valerian Root was for you. But, anyway, the spell should wear off in a few hours. Or you can free him. He and I will have a discussion on Monday either way."
So, now Severus Snape, former dungeon bat-slash-spy-slash-Death Eater without any apparent conscience, had to allow Harry to help him, to deepen their connection. Steeling himself for the upcoming humiliation, he requested, "I would like to take a bath."
"Hey," the raven-haired whispered. "It's okay. I'm sorry. I promise I will put contingency plans in place, in case something like the Children of Hecate happen again. I will make sure nothing will happen to you or your parents. Alright?"
--O-O--
Harry painted a triangle in the air.
"Spoon!"
"Alright, what's wrong with you?" Neville sighed around one.
Reluctantly, the other wizard made an inviting gesture, yet refrained from including Lucius. It did not matter anyway. In public it would be entirely inconceivable for a vassal to claim a position equal to his liege. People in his position were meant to be seen, to increase the prestige of their masters. Hence it was expected of Lucius to stay in the background while displaying his excellent breeding and perfect manners.
"This is not a run-of-the-mill investigation! This is Hermione!"
"Ron and Hermione were with me when Tom's vision directed me to the boathouse. Hermione thought fast enough on her feet, to cast a stasis charm on him as soon as he had given me the memory. She most likely saved his life, or so Poppy said. Poppy stabilised him properly but told us, that she had no way of curing Nagini's venom. She knew, however, of an ancient ritual, that would put him in an enchanted sleep so deep, that it would put his metabolism to nearly a full stop, giving us time to find an antidote. With her stabilising him, we needed four people for the cardinal points of the ritual. McGonagall helped."
--O-O--
"Interesting," James commented, inquiring innocently, "How many does he have?"
Taking in Malfoy’s defeated posture, Harry made one of his many ill-thought-through and reckless decisions, that would - once again - change the course of his entire life. “No,” he resolved, rose from the couch, and called out. “Kreacher, show Malfoy one of the guest-rooms on the second floor. He’ll stay with us for the near future, in service to the family.”
"Okay," the raven−haired Auror steeled himself. "I could try parselmagic. It's all about intent. I will try to poke a hole through this rumble to get us some fresh air and possibly a way to contact the others."
"Well, I was going over the books and pondered about what Pot… I mean Harry said." He gestured towards the volume. "I thought maybe I could look at the index and figure out what was wrong. You know, sometimes the magic just needs a little nudge and sorts itself out."
Approaching a pair of blinds that decorated the wall facing the windows, Harry pulled them open, revealing a tall mirror that reflected the light of the dying sun. On the inside of the blinds were rows upon rows of little hooks. At least a dozen of them held pendants, similar to the one Draco was still holding. Every single one contained a crystal or a semi−precious stone, merged perfectly around the inlay. A few of them were decorated with veins of various metals. "My godson is fond of two things above all else: stars and stones. I receive one of these pendants every other visit."
"George," Ron cautioned, reaching for his brother's shoulder. "I know that I'm not Fred. But I'm here whenever you need me. I'm ready to listen."
Working diligently on the sacrifice−case, Harry nearly forgot about the hearing of Lostrife until Lucius reminded him three days prior. They had set up regular meetings with Malfoy's charge and his correspondent in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. As a defender, the former Lord never learned what part of the information he gathered was relayed to the public attorney. But according to the brief conversations during lunch Harry and Hermione shared twice a week, everything was going as expected.
"Master!" "Mistress!" They cried out in one voice, sprinting towards their owner, bowing deep.
Startling briefly, Harry had all but forgotten about Narcissa, he nodded after a few moments of contemplation, "The ring would work. Though I had you in mind when enchanting it, Draco is close enough to you - magic wise - to be covered by the spell."
"From what?" The Hufflepuff wanted to know.
So, as soon as he was finished his oatmeal and tea, Draco excused himself from the table with a quiet, "I'll be in the library, should you need me."
"Of course, Luna, stay safe!"
"Potter!" his team-leader snapped.
Now have a good time with a recovering, stubborn, mulish Harry.
Yet Harry had not been able to reply, fighting down tears, so as to not embarrass himself in front of his parents. For years, more than two decades, in fact, he had longed for someone to act just like that. Someone who got angry on his behalf, when Harry was wronged, but …
And all of a sudden, the young wizard felt about a hundred pounds lighter. Still, since his professor had never been for displays of emotion, the young man forced himself to reply evenly, "You're welcome," before closing the door.
Before he realised, what he was doing, Lucius pulled his only child into his arms, holding together his trembling body when Draco soaked his clothes with tears. "My son," he whispered against the blond head, squeezing his eyes shut against the overwhelming pain he had caused. "I am so sorry." When his boy quivered even stronger at that, he pulled him in, looking at his wife, but Narcissa just shook her head. Her satisfied smile, lit up her face, despite her eyes shining with unshed tears. It seemed that Draco did not need anything but this; a father that was once again with him. Lucius' eyes followed her when she slipped out, leaving the two of them to their reunion.
When Draco staggered into the kitchen around six the next morning, he found a bleary-eyed Harry, staring into his tea, while an energetic Teddy told about the wonders of his latest dream, seamlessly changing the topic to this day's activities when he noticed him entering. Though Harry had barely mumbled more than, "Yea!", "Hm …" or "Really?", encouraging his godson to continue, he wordlessly conjured another cup and gestured for Draco to help himself to some tea. It was clear that he was in no mood to make conversation. Actually, that suited Draco just fine since, despite going to bed with an elated feeling, nightmares had woken him every two to three hours. The anxiety of seeing his mother fall from the Astronomy tower instead of Dumbledore; the Dark Lord whispering praises into his ear; his father lying in a dark cell in Azkaban, soulless and cold had kept him from finding restful sleep.
"The poison still explodes into your face as soon as it's separated from the blood?" The raven-haired pondered.
Their host followed with gallons of ice-cream.
"Only half an hour, so they are still quite vocal."
The blond was startled out of his musings when his godfather put a hand on his shoulder.
"You don't," his partner assured. "But you see, our deities are different from the Christian god. Many stand for different aspects. Some share traits. You can make sacrifices and pray to the one you can relate to the most."
"Excuse me?"
Let's all say thank you to her for her amazing work!
Though Snape would have loved to contradict him, he had to give it to Potter that he was right. Still, not willing to give up his resistance so easily, Snape sneered, "It makes … no diff… differ…
"Exp … explain that!" Snape did not care for people who told him what to do. He actively disliked wizards and witches who told him what he could
Completely taken aback by this coherent, yet slightly awkward phrase - up until now, the little elf had but offered two-word sentences - the young wizard nearly missed, her turning around with a confused look. "Serve what … serve what?" She pondered, still clutching her master's trousers. Yet before Kreacher could offer a suggestion, her face lit up, and she beamed at Harry.
Grumbling, Harry led the way into the garden, where he stopped in front of a worn-down shack Severus had not really noticed before. Strange.
Concerned, Harry wanted to know, “Do you think there is any chance for him to go free?”
Chuckling, Lucius shook his head, remembering all the mischief he and his fiancée had gotten into in their attempt to get to know each other. "Let's just say, the day of our wedding, I shared his opinion. But when she banished me from her bed for not yielding to her will on the decoration of our baby's nursery, I fell in love with her and keep falling still."
“As have I,” a certain redhead announced, taking position beside Hermione. “Ronald Weasley, your honour.”
And boom … the whispers picked up again, only to taper off, when the last third of the 'golden trio' entered, guiding a Lady whose appearance and poise allowed no doubt about her being born into a family that had valued blood purity for generations.
"Yea, … sorry."
"Whose favourite food?" Draco inquired, entering ahead of Harry with a tray with an assortment of miss-matched cups and spoons.
The calm and collected Slytherin-façade was back in place, but the raven-haired still remembered the tender looks Draco had given the neglected and starved animal. Following him into the burrow, Harry wondered if his former rival had ever had a pet like Hedwig. At Hogwarts, Harry had believed the Slytherin to be incapable of caring about anything but himself. Now, things were … different. He and Foxglove had a mutually beneficial relationship. But Harry would hardly call the owl his 'pet'. He nested in the garden of Grimmauld Place, as per his own decision, and was occasionally agreeable to transporting letters in exchange for treats.
Studying the cover, Harry could not help but snicker. "Which one?"
Lucius paled when his son stumbled into the dining-room, at his master's call, looking angry. Draco wore unusually old and torn clothes, and his arms and face were scratched. Only at Harry's exasperated remark to at least wash his hands, he sullenly cleaned himself up in the kitchen sink. However, despite having promised Lucius that he would call Potter out if the other wizard ever went too far, no further conversation happened between the two. Draco merely joined them at the dinner table, shovelling the peasant's dish into his mouth, before the Lord of the House could even take a bite.
--O-O--
Briefly allowing himself to graze the man's face with the tips of his fingers, Harry whispered, "But I am working on it. I promise. I have not given up on you yet."
"We should bring him home," Ron decided, while Kingsley and Hermione worked on erasing their magical signatures. At the beginning, the former Auror had been surprised that the young witch was familiar with such a spell. But since it was not illegal per se, he carefully avoided asking where she had learned it. The young barista did not offer an explanation.
"That was George," Ron deadpanned, still not sure if he was asleep or awake on this surreal morning.
Pulling the young witch close, he soothingly rubbed her back. "It's okay, Hermione. I know you had no such intention. It's fine, really. I've had worse. The spell must be on the dishes and cutlery."
Harry did not possess as much self−control but hid his aversion against the addressing by checking the unclaimed drinks. "Here, take this one." Offering a different coffee, he took the one the man had sat down and handed it to Draco. Choosing between the remaining cups, he presented one to Narcissa before claiming the last one.
Terrified, Lucius blindly reached for his liege’s wrist and whispered pleadingly, “She has nothing to do with this, I swear. Please, I’m begging you, don’t involve her. I will gladly take any punishment, but please, don’t hurt my wife.”
"It will!" Ron assured her, kissing her forehead.
For a few moments, nobody said a word. Only Teddy's tense breaths could be heard, while the older wizards sorted through the given information. Draco could see Harry becoming enraged, barely holding on to his composure. As to not frighten the boy, he pulled Teddy into his arms and ordered, "Go. We will see you back at home."
Lucius Malfoy woke screaming.
Working some product into Harry's hair before taming it with a spell, the brunet raised his eyebrows at that question. "From the impression you have just gotten, do you really think that she cares?"
When the young men returned a minute later, Harry claimed his seat with an apologetic gaze, “Sorry, I forgot the time.”
Raising his hands, Teddy demanded to be lifted, and after a brief send−off to his grandmother, they were on their way up to the third floor.
(And isn't that a confusing teaser for the next chapter ;).)
"You won't …" Narcissa whispered, "I gave mine to Draco. He lost it the day of the battle."
--O-O--
"I have to carry on the Malfoy name," he reminded himself hollowly. "No matter what I want … I need too …"
"A little."
There really had been only one library of importance left, but for the life of them, the two young wizards had never expected to see it. "Bloody hell …" they mumbled, looking at 'Chris Draca', who merely smirked.
"You know, I don't even want to know." Pulling the smaller wizard into a hug, George whispered, "Thank you, Harry. I really appreciate it."
Studying the shivering boy, the older wizard assured the concerned couple. "I will take it from here. Mrs Granger-Weasley, Mr Weasley, you may go to bed now."
Nodding, Severus held out his hand to Narcissa, accepting the ring before turning back to Harry. "Where is your cloak?"
"You've got to be kidding me!" Draco hissed from his right.
"Alright," Harry parroted, bounding up the stairs to the third floor.
be true, we will never know. Father was not Voldemort's most powerful supporter. He just furthered his agenda like so many others."
"It is," the witch smirked a little. "But they injured you. That seems to make this entire investigation quite personal for your thrall. He is like a dog with a bone, unravelling the legal concerns of this organisation faster than any of us could."
“That is highly morally ambiguous,” Neville remarked, looking over Hermione’s shoulder, before grinning at his partner. “I didn't know you had it in you, Harry.”
Inhaling the fragrant tea, she smiled and finally picked up one of the cookies her daughter had baked for her. It was crumbly at the edges and a little too soft in the middle but tasted just fine. Also, it looked vaguely like a heart, something Rose had pointed out proudly at least three times during dinner. The little girl had definitely inherited her mother's brain, with little patience for picture books and an understanding far beyond her age. Regrettably, she had also inherited Hermione's talent for cooking. While everything she produced was edible, it was a far cry from the delicious treats and meals Ron could come up with. Still, Hermione smiled at the vaguely heart-shaped biscuit when Harry inquired, "Help me out here. Make me understand why the thing with Saunders drives you up the wall like this, so you would even threaten him … with an audience! You are usually more level-headed than that."
"That's a one-way trip, Severus. His room is heavily warded. We won't be able to get you out," the young Auror cautioned.
Reluctantly, Hermione and Harry followed; Draco a quiet sentinel at their backs. Nobody said a word when, one after the other, they prepared for bed. Emerging from the tiny bathroom, that was part of the tent - honestly, the pureblood could not even fathom to survive in such sub-standard living conditions, never mind having the capacity to plan the downfall of the darkest wizard of all, as these three Gryffindors had been able to - he noticed the electrical candle, that stood on a small stool between the two enlarged beds.
"Yes," the young man replied with certainty. "Without the shadow of a doubt."
Halfway through a truly delicious meal, the young wizard inquired, "Does Draco know?"
The water made Harry groan blissfully, offering a weak smile. When the hustle outside picked up again, he tried to sit up, but Hermione instantly pushed him back. "Narcissa …"
Now, enjoy this new chapter :).
Confirming that, Alexander had a brief chat with his aunt…s before the Aurors headed back upstairs.
"Cuddles!" Came a muffled shout from the garden, but before Andromeda could say something, the screamer was silenced with an anxious, "Shhhhh!"
“Harry,” The blond soothed anxiously, “Everything is okay. You are home. The war is over. Nobody is trying to hurt you.” Carefully, the young man removed the tatters of Harry’s shirt, before gently placing trembling fingers over the raven-haired’s heart. “Whatever it was, it is gone now. See?”
Another smile. This one could be called nearly tender, when the raven-haired shared, "It was Draco. Once he had access to a proper lab, he needed barely more than a week to come up with the potion. You can be very proud of your godson. He was amazing."
Having an Unspeakable around was both awkward - they had a reputation like bogarts at the Ministry - as well as terribly efficient. Anastasia Boleyn was a kind but very determined witch, that took in all information, listened to everyone's option and then started to map out an appropriate ritual. She was done in a day. No discussions, no second guessing. "You will need seven quite powerful wizards to put trackers on all the books in Manchester and Westminster, but for the British Library, you need sorcerers of their calibre." She gestured towards Harry and Neville.
“What are you saying? That no matter what I do, I can’t change a thing about this godforsaken tree?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Are you ready, mate?"
"Over here," Neville pointed at a wine-rack, but then immediately shook his head. "No, it's just wine. " Then he turned away, ignoring the wall.
In September 2018 I applied for a lower body-lift to cut off the excess skin because - let's be honest - if you're over 40 your body simply doesn't bounce back from years of overweight.
“Pardon?”
"Perfectly fine, Sir. Did Sir need anything, or did he just call on Kreacher for his personal entertainment?"
"No, the main reason, I think, is our magical core."
"Nope," Harry grinned, before he sobered. "The point is, you have your room and a bathroom for yourself. You know the majority of my wards, since you were in the Order. There is even a potions lab around, and I am sure Draco would share with you. But if you want your own, we can figure something out. Just, please, give yourself some time to get better. And when you are on your feet again, you can decide how you want to play this."
Thinking of his mother and how she would judge everything Harry had done, the young man nodded reluctantly.
"So?" She looked up at him.
"Those are circumstances. They will change."
we look forward with joy and hope into this new year."
"Yes, Narcissa," came the collective reply. The older children made an effort to help the younger ones out of their seats, guiding them towards the guest rooms or into the garden.
"A human sacrifice," she clarified.
"By asking them to keep quiet?" The young Auror replied confused, as if that was the easiest thing in the world.
Surprised, the former Lord looked up from the corner of the living-room, where he and Narcissa had claimed a love-seat. "You didn't …" he started, clearly embarrassed to be included.
The next day, Kreacher served a muscle relaxant with breakfast. Harry and Draco downed it instantly, sighing when their strained limbs started to relax. Since it was the third Sunday of the month, Harry put Teddy into another bath and then prepared him for lunch with the family. As always, the boy was excited to meet the Weasleys and especially Victoire, Bill and Fleur's daughter. The girl was a mirror image of her mother, with her hair being the only exception. No matter the light, it always looked like the red rays of a dying sun on a summer's day, vibrant and with a life of its own. Teddy had fallen for her the moment they had met, and it was agreed upon that they would marry when they were grown up; at least between the kids. As always, the boy had brought a gift for Victoire as well. The clear crystal looked incredibly delicate on its silver chain, and Teddy twisted it between his fingers anxiously, since, "Are you sure she will like it? What if she doesn't like the colour? What if she thinks it's too small. What if …?"
Covertly peeking over his shoulder, the blond admitted, ""I don't want to lose what I have right now."
"No, but it can call upon the souls of those who linger. You can see them … talk to them and … apologise …" he finished quietly, lost in the memory of his first and last encounter with his best friend in more than 30 years.
"And Draco won't be alone," Harry breathed.
Offering two choices of bath-additives, Harry chuckled while pouring one, before adding a healthy amount of bubble bath. "I think Emilia will consider the featherlight charm cheating. However, your control is excellent, Sir. Much better than can be expected so soon after waking."
Harry shuffled more than walked to his room, eyes half closed. That's why he nearly ran over Kreacher before he reached his door. Rubbing his eyes tiredly, he asked, "Nightmares again?"
Now Harry's tone took a commanding edge, as he ordered, "Sit down! I don't care if you only chose cornbread and yoghurt for dinner, but you
Pressing his lips together, the recovering patient nodded reluctantly. After accepting more water he rasped, "I tried to help. Guard his sleep. I woke from a nightmare. He told me to leave."
"Off you go."
−−O−O−−
"We agreed that …" the younger sibling began, but George cut him off, "
"Yes, Sir," George beamed.
Pushing the balls of her hands into her eye sockets, Daphne admitted after a moment of quiet contemplation, "I need help.
"Maybe I should fetch the whiskey?"
"Go on, mate!"
Closing his eyes against the overwhelming pain, the raven-haired shook his head. "No, and even if I were, Draco could never be … he wants Astoria. She can give him everything he desires."
"Teddy is fine, Cissy, I'm calling about Draco and Harry."
Mirroring Ron's gesture from before, Harry had rubbed his friend's shoulder, explaining, "This is not about the Prewetts. Ron never knew them outside of stories. It's just … he has twin-brothers and one of them … Fred didn't survive the second war."
"During our last case, where you served as a consultant, you mentioned Potion Masters with the skill level the librarians would need."
"Means binding something into the wards, entwining new magic into an established pattern or covering it."
"Teddy, please, let me finish."
"We would be tremendously grateful, Miss Weasley," Lucius remarked, not daring to look away from his liege. He had faulted this girl in so many ways, still, she seemed easily ready to forget his past transgressions in favour of caring for her friend. A part of him wondered if this easy truce was not too good to be true.
Putting his head on the blond's shoulder, Teddy thought about it for a little while. "Cause she should have told him. He's an Auror. He has to know about Dark Wizards, so he can catch them."
"We both grew up … grew up in abusive households. Once at Hogwarts we were forced to make decisions, depending on the expectations of our peers. Snape was never rich enough, his blood never pure enough to satisfy those expectations. Tom gave him a chance to be more … more than a poor half-blood without any prospects. He became a formidable Potion Master and a great man, who did the right thing despite the excruciating costs it demanded of him."
"Do you honestly believe that he will come to me when the bullying gets too bad?"
Like last time, thank you topgngoose for helping me to beta this chapter. All remaining mistakes are mine and mine alone.
"Yes." Looking around helplessly, Harry dragged his fingers through his messy hair, sinking down on the bench beside his blond friend. "Maybe this is not such a good idea."
With everybody else, Harry would have dismissed these words as an empty phrase, but this was Neville. The young man had been there, in the eye of the storm, for seventh year. Doing his best to keep himself and those around him safe. While Ron, Hermione and he had fought and hunted Horcrux, Neville had led the resistance at Hogwarts, a place he had considered his home for six years. Harry had been so proud of his fellow Gryffindor, despite his heartbreaking, when he had heard of all the horrors they had faced.  So yes, Neville got it, had fought in the war facing torture and death as much as Harry had. Therefore, it was impossible to dismiss his opinion, no matter how little the raven-haired wanted to discuss the topic.
With a soft smile, Irma looked at her nephew before she started counting turns. Before the first was complete, she faded from view. Wordlessly, the young Auror held out his hand, and surprisingly, Irma Pince handed over the time-turner that had appeared around her neck.
"I'm not hungry."
Finishing his drink, the former Death Eater rose and demanded, "Show me."
Caressing the boy's head, Luna looked around. "I think we can start now. Come along then. Their hooves and manes need to be cleaned, and afterwards, we will see if some of them want to carry you."
"Actually, it was the other way around," a composed voice, with a core of steel, interrupted the trio.
Exhaustion was eating at him, making the titles of the books swim before his eyes. These past few days, Draco had always allowed himself a short nap after lunch, since his nights seemed to become less restful as time went on. Yet, after the confrontation in the kitchen, he had no desire to be found slacking. Of course, he knew that Harry was nothing like You−Know−Who. That, no matter how much he displeased his new master, he would never use the Cruciatus on him or hurt his family. Still, the moment the raven−haired has made his displeasure with Draco's actions clear, he had felt transported back to the long table in their dining−room, barely daring to breathe, afraid of drawing attention to himself. Then Harry had touched him, and for a heartbeat, the blond had felt Voldemort's fingers dig into his flesh. But then the other wizard's words had not only been exhausted but downright gentle, conveying his emotions in a way that would have been impossible with Voldemort.
He had not at all understood the small smile that had lit up the young witch's faced when she had nodded. "As has Harry."
The hint of a smile touched Astoria's face as she tilted her head curiously. "I won't?"
--O-O--
The moment the speaker aimed to plunge his blade into Draco's heart, several things happened simultaneously:
Trying to recall what Severus had told them all those years ago, the former Death Eater intoned, "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. Born to those who have thrice defied him. Born as the seventh month dies!" Lucius shrugged, admitting. "That is all I ever learned. That night the Lord spent many hours pondering if Alice and Frank Longbottom were those in question or Lily and James Potter. I think the final decision was only made after Pettigrew was captured. The Dark Lor… Voldemort saw it as a sign that we caught the secret keeper of your parents and went to Godric's Hollow, the next night." A shaking breath from the window made him rise and approach the young wizard who had saved them all. Hesitant, he placed a hand on the man's shoulder before stating quietly, "I'm sorry."
"You have not confirmed it at the Ministry?"
However, instead of berating and punishing his former rival and current servant for the insult, their master steadied himself and recalled exhausted, "You are not allowed …"
Returning the gesture for a moment, Ron disappeared into the tent, leaving the blond to ponder. An asshole and scared … it did not make up for all the wrongs Draco had committed, but it made them a little less of a burden. When he returned to bed, slipping between the sheets, Harry's arms instantly wrapped around him. In the end, maybe his father was right. Perhaps it was time to put the past to rest and thrive to become a better man in the future.
"I …," Severus stated, but then closed his mouth, thinking hard. "I am not certain
"Fidelius Charms are cast on places, not people. They affect magical and muggle alike."
Leaving for one of the lower salons, Harry cast a Tempus and set an alarm spell, so he would not miss dinner. He had just stretched out on a plush sofas when there was a loud knocking on the door. Determined to strangle whoever took time away from his nap, he threw the door open, only to come face to face with a member of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and Daphne Greengrass, who had started her training in the Inquisition Squad about the same time, Harry had begun his Auror training.
"Sorry," Harry tousled his hair, obviously embarrassed. "Alright, what we plan on doing, is …" And off they went.
Reaching out to stabilise her, Harry gingerly opened her burnt hand. "Oh, Narcissa, why would you do that to yourself?" The young wizard whispered, inspecting the pattern the wand had scorched into her delicate skin.
is what Fred would want, no matter where he is?"
Following the unexplainable draw that pulled him into the jungle, he stumbled out of the greenery at the foot of a giant pyramid, that felt like the people living there had only abandoned it yesterday. When he set foot on the premises, he realised that it had not been abandoned at all. People with spears and nets had forced him to his knees, and though he had sensed dark magic surrounding him, he surprisingly had not felt threatened. He had gotten to know true evil and these people, though afraid of him, had not been evil. He had allowed them to go through his pockets and his bag, knowing that they wouldn’t be able to unlock the expanded compartment since they weren’t magical. He had been more than surprised for one of them to shout out when they had pulled out his wand. He had made a grab for it, and surprisingly they had relinquished it easily.
"Kreacher?"
"Because our master was insane!!!" Severus roared.
The sun was touching the horizon, illuminating the strange group of former Gryffindors and Slytherins that lay side by side on the back lawn. Halfway through the day, Millicent Bullstrode had joined them. Blaise had been admitted to St. Mungos because one of the more volatile books in the Malfoy library had bitten him. After hearing what was going on, the newly admitted healer had clocked out after a thirteen-hour shift and joined them. Everybody had been immensely grateful since she could offer immediate help when one fireplace incinerated George's shoulder, and the former Lord Malfoy had a dizzy spell halfway through the afternoon. Millicent had checked him over and proposed a rigorous potions regiment to counter the negligence he had suffered in Azkaban.
"Of course, Mrs Granger. Finite Incantatem!"
feeling was entirely mutual."
"Yes! … No! … Bloody hell!" George hissed, closing his eyes against the pain that seemed too big to suffer. "He should have dodged; thrown up a shield; blasted these cursed stones to pieces; really anything but laughing while being killed by blunt force trauma.
"To everybody who kept me alive, since I have become a part of the Wizarding World. Out in the field, I could not rely on Ron and Hermione any longer. I would have been on my own, and after all the troubles my friends and teachers went through to help me survive, I thought that the least I could do was prove that I met all qualifications for the job. You know; that I actually knew what was required and was more than just a famous name."
But the young woman had learned to see through the Slytherin masks and did not let herself be deterred. "May I ask how often?"
"Girlfriend, in fact."
scare me like that?"
"The smell is stronger down here," Pince cautioned. "If your wife has set her cell on fire, we have to find her fast."
Class. I gave a very moving speech."
Hugging her mother-in-law, kissing her daughter, Hermione finished, "But it's Harry, so how can we not? After all," she watched George and Angelina hugging Molly, then glanced at Ron, who pulled out an old galleon, "We won't be alone."
"What of it?"
Chuckling, the witch tilted her head. "Thank you, Auror Pince, but if you allow me a little correction. Inquiries would be much appreciated if they start with 'Do you want some tea?' or 'Would you care for a biscuit?'. I'm always good with these."
Snape tilted his head. "Would you allow me a few minutes alone?"
Growing pale, Narcissa sank into one of the armchairs, in front of the warded fireplace. "Scrubbing toilets, washing windows, being thrown into a dungeon … if that's what you expected, why come here in the first place?"
Rolling his eyes, Percy demanded to know, "Did Kingsley fight by the Aurors' side, yesterday?"
So, this was how it was going to be: carrot and stick from her and the enchanted mirror, dripping poison into his ear at every opportunity. Not knowing how far the spell went, if there may even be a monitoring charm woven into it, Draco had chosen not to reply. Instead, he had turned away and had closed the door firmly behind himself. Back in the bedroom, he had studied the floorboards, knocked on the walls, everything he could remember to find a potentially concealed door. He had not had a lot of hope to find any means of escape, but if this house was at least partially like Malfoy Manor, there might be hidden passages.
"We shall," Hermione decided, allowing the former Lord to guide her down the stairs, Ron mirroring her position, with Narcissa on his arm. Harry followed two steps behind, calming a tense Draco, "Don't worry, everything will be fine."
"Harry?"
"Sixteen minutes, little gem. Or do you want to challenge me? You are a clever boy; I am sure you have realised by now that I take pleasure in hurting you."
Harry Potter would not betray the trust of a person, who had protected him his entire life!
"No," the pureblood glared at the younger man. "But pray, tell me what the 'f−word' in question is."
--O-O--
Drowsy, the trio trudged over and fell onto the mattress. Within moments, they lay curled around each other, fast asleep. Draco was a little surprised when Harry interwove their fingers, as he spooned him from behind. Still, it was a good feeling to be held, so the blond pulled himself closer and allowed himself to succumb to sleep again, hoping that this would be the last disturbance of the night.
Emilia was massaging the bridge of her nose, trying to stave off the upcoming headache. "You are unreasonable," she stated with forced calm. Or at least as much calm as she could, since she and her patient had been discussing this particular topic for nearly an hour now.
"We brought you to the infirmary and performed the ritual we have already told you about. But somehow, some way, people got the impression that you have died. Especially after we have told them about Nagini's bite. McGonagall helped me to take charge and surprisingly, nobody even bothered to look at your 'corpse'. Even the Order of Merlin was awarded post humus, though I think Kingsley suspected something, since he insisted on giving it to me in your stead."
--O-O--
But once more, the raven-haired interrupted him. "Don't, please. Don't tell me what I want to hear. That won't help." Closing his eyes, against the raising fatigue, Harry staggered to his feet. "Let's return to Grimmauld Place. I'm sure Draco is running in circles already. I can take a nap, and you can review Hermione's first draft. Then we can talk."
get exactly what they asked for. Nothing more, nothing less!
--O-O--
"Not even a little bit."
"Madam Pince," the shaggy-haired blond growled, "It's your turn to prevent things like this!"
"How can you …?"
"What have I done?" A young witch with a pixie-cut and dusty grey robes emerged from between two bookshelves. "Irma, Mdm Pince, is it my turn already?" Then, she spotted the Aurors and groaned, "Not again."
The atmosphere in the room had been so thick, that you could have cut it with a knife. Nobody seemed to know where to go from there until Ron chuckled unexpectantly. "You hated cauliflower and Fred abhorred broccoli when we were kids. Every time we had one or the other, both of you smuggled the vegetable onto my plate."
Draco looked after her, utterly confused. "What just happened?"
"She's not the only one in the portrait. You and this version of dad never made up."
The stern voice of the residing Potion Master made the boy flinch at his lookout. Still, he replied honestly, "Eyedropping."
One good thing about this home-invasion was Narcissa thriving due to the unexpected challenge. She was eating more. The fires at the Manor were burning again. And when she slipped under the covers in the evening, she seemed to glow with an inner light he had missed for far too long.
At his godfather's advice, he had visited the library of Malfoy Manor, getting wrapped up in a discussion about herbs that dampened or enhanced a wizard's core. The man he had engaged with had looked a lot like Professor Slughorn, with his tweed jacket, silver-grey hair and general single-mindedness when discussing a topic. He had, however, been a lot more immersed in the subject and its implications, than in the person he was talking to. The blond would have sworn that the man would not be able to identify him, as soon as he had left the library.
"Why?" Kingsley demanded to know after he had given the order of putting Severus Snape's documents in order. "I know you were not the favourite of the masses and keeping us at arm's length might have been a necessity during the war. I understand your reasoning. But I hope you know that we would have supported you in the aftermath either way."
Clenching his fists, the other shook his head. "Yes … No … I don't know!" He snapped, then repeated in a whisper, "I don't know, okay? It's just … the idea of him leaving, of being alone again … As soon as I became part of our world, he was there. He protected me because he had promised mum. And he hated me because I looked like dad. But … Severus never turned his back on me. Because he didn't like me to begin with, no matter what the general public said or thought. He was just there … I … sometimes I had the feeling that he was the only person I knew exactly where I stood with. Then, the night of the battle, everything changed, and I finally got it. And when he survived, and I brought him here, he was just sleeping, … in a coma I mean. But I still talked to him, and I imagined what he would say in return. And now … I'm not explaining this very well, sorry."
“Do you know how it feels to be constantly hungry and assaulted by nightmares at every corner, in your own home?”
we draw near in unity and peace,
"Well, I don't plan to ask
Without complaint, Neville picked up the portrait and leaned it against the cabinet.
"Just spit it out!" Neville demanded exhausted. "I doubt that we have any other options left."
When the elf handed out the cleaning−supplies and a crate reluctantly, she took them and returned to the salon. Harry had tried to play by the rules, with an open heart that got broken with every useless spell he seemed to fire at that family−tree. It was time he learned some Slytherin cunning.
It was hard for the young Auror to suppress a smile when he realised how much their patient's speech had improved. With the help of Draco's potion, apparently, if the vial on the bedside table was anything to go by. Instead he replied easily, "Draco does."
"Stupidity hurts!" His friend replied dryly.
"Then why did I use my dying breath telling Harry that he had to die as well?"
"Great. In that case, I'll go downstairs and check on Snape. See how he is doing."
"A monthly allowance and not to be touched without permission. She was willing to trade an heir for freedom."
Surprised, Harry shook his head, "You have never had Chilli? Prepare to be amazed! After the last few days of English Cuisine, I was craving something spicy. But don't worry, I brought yoghurt. In case it's too hot for you."
When Draco woke the next morning, he could not remember what had happened. Everything seemed to be a combination of dreams and memories, with no way for him to decide what had happened and what had been in his head. And while the comforter on the other side of the bed was churned, nothing else indicated that someone had slept there. Also, he had sworn Kreacher to secrecy, when the elf had come to his aid when the first nightmare had hit. There was nothing to worry about.
For a moment the former Lord looked at his liege, before taking another sip and returning to work. Still, after a few minutes, he gazed up and studied the young man, who seemed lost in Granger's transcription of yesterday's interview. Potter had had no compunction of claiming a part of the oversized desk for himself and was taking notes diligently. It was rare for Lucius to have someone look after him. His mother had cared of course but had bent to the rules of his overly demanding father. Narcissa had taken up caring for his well−being, as was expected of a dutiful wife. But Harry Potter, though his liege, should feel no according compulsion to watch out for Lucius. Of course, he was of more use if he was healthy and fit. But not being able to stomach something was hardly a terminal illness. Yet the young man had not only shown concern for his physical but his emotional well−being as well. No matter how he thought of it, the pureblood could not determine why.
"Yes," Lucius confirmed. "Be that home-schooling, a private or a shared tutor."
"Don't you 'hello mother' me, young man. I want an explanation! How long have
Exhaling quietly, Harry shook his head. "No, Draco, I am not angry. I am relieved. But I would prefer something like this not happening again."
The young Auror was taken aback when Pendragon chuckled and sheathed his sword, "I like her. She's feisty. You can keep her if you make sure she doesn't get underfoot."
This is my future wife we are expecting. I think a little apprehension is to be expected."
Once the gangly wizard was finished reciting the last paragraph, he looked up. His scroll and jaw hit the floor about the same time. "Y…, y…, y…"
The redhead's voice was a bare whisper when he shared, "She called me Fred, and I hate her so much for that, but I can't … I just can't …" he sobbed, finally allowing Harry to pull him into his arms. Letting the younger wizard, who had become his brother in everything but blood, hug him close, caressing his head, unconcerned of the scar where his left ear should be. To Harry, it had never mattered.
The soft light that fell through the half-closed curtains illuminated Harry's slow rouse from sleep, drinking in the sight of the woman by his side. With a choked sob, he pulled himself close, and she wrapped her arms around him, calming him. "It's all right. You're safe. We all are."
"Oh, alright." Without further ado, Draco helped the raven to the fire and after handing him the floo-powder, left the room.
When Draco did not reply for an extended amount of time, Harry moved closer. He put a gentle hand on the blond's shoulder and urged, "Nobody can know about this, Draco. That is really important! Not even your parents! Do you understand?"
Awkwardness reigned between the four since neither seemed to know where to go from there. Inari, trying to climb Draco's leg, broke the tension.
"Hm …" was the monosyllabic reply. Still, Draco chose to interpret the absent−minded wave as an invitation to sit. Kreacher was by his side in an instant.
"This will put me to sleep in thirty minutes tops," the blond complained, when accepting the cup, savouring the first sip.
Gesturing for Draco to come in, Harry revealed, "Our residing Potion Master caught Lucius sneaking into my office."
Harry could not even tell, who had been more embarrassed by that speech, him or Neville. Both stood before the elderly witch with flaming cheeks, eyes glued to the floor; very much like first-years who were told off by their Head of House. A few times, Neville had tried to offer feeble protests but had been cut off with a sharp gesture.
"And that is simultaneously the best-case scenario as well," Hermione added.
Our land loves, but has yet to know the love of all.
Blindly he stumbled out of Hermione and Ron's floo. Initially, the name of the place had been a running joke between the members of their family, since Hermione had brought so many books into their new home that the walls of every room in the house were lined with shelves. It had been the most amazing moving-in present when Arthur had presented them with their new floo-address, the day of their house-warming party. Today, Harry was just grateful that he could simply fall out of the floo, nearly stumbling over the couch-table.
He seemed pleased that his client was finally learning to work their system. In the past, Harry Potter had always seemed too … Gryffindor for his own good. This Slytherin-mindset was doing his client good.
"Actually, it's a mixture of spices," Ginny revealed. "I'm quite partial to the 'Spiced Chai Latte' myself. Let me show you."
"No," she pondered, staring into the barely illuminated cave. "I can't either."
from starvation. Nowhere near enough to care for a coma patient! But of course," the young man sneered, "I forgot the Ministry. You were a government employee after all when we put you to sleep. I am sure they would have taken excellent care of you. Maybe even given you a bed beside Lockhart at St. Mungos to keep you entertained."
The moment Kreacher put eggs, toast, sausage and beans on the table, on Saturday morning, Ron entered the room with a pigeon-like homing-instinct he seemed to possess whenever food was concerned. Hermione followed at a more sedated pace, actually greeting Harry and Draco before helping herself to some of the plentiful breakfast. Apparently, Draco's cleaning had pulled Kreacher out of hiding, and the house-elf had picked up his duties again, at least when it came to mealtimes. Any other time of the day he was hardly seen.
"As your lights in a world of darkness, strengthened by your power."
"Of course," the former Lord agreed, not ready to admit that he literally had not understood a single word of what had been said.
"Of course," Molly confirmed. "Otherwise, I would never have gotten you lot under control!"
Aiming for a neutral expression but failing miserably, Harry chuckled, "Did she hex you? Please tell me she did not curse you. That would be quite hard to explain at the Ministry."
"No, I did not! You asked me carefully formulated questions, and I offered well thought-through answers."
Calling upon his pureblood mask, the man made an inviting gesture, "By all means. I am not a delicate flower that will wither at a cant remark of you."
"It worked before," Harry whispered tonelessly, while the eldest Weasley - who had been put in charge of the sleeping arrangements - explained, "Well, I know it's not much, but I enlarged the beds, even if I had to take one out, to make enough room. Rose will sleep in her own room anyway, along with Victoire and Dominique. So, two should cut it for one night. And it … I don't know, it feels like yours. It was in your attic after all."
"Good night, Emerald, and … thank you."
Obviously surprised, that the other did not jump to conclusions once again, Harry dusted the flour off his hands and claimed a seat, facing his guest. "He's brewing."
"One powerful item does not make a fairy tale true!" His father protested.
When the few drops of oil had burned down, Lucius went to pick up the watch to fasten it around Hermione's wrist again. He flinched when the watch gave him a nasty shock at first touch. She just shook her head at him. True, he could have guessed that her artefact was even better protected than his cane. Hermione Granger was one of the people closest to Harry Potter's heart. With a smile, she put it on herself. Compulsion or not, both breathed a little easier when she was protected once again. Once they had cleaned up after themselves, he prompted. "Come on, you have done everything you could. Let's get you to bed."
--O-O--
Sniffing, Teddy brushed his nose with his sleeve. "But not as much as when you're just you. I know Uncle Harry loves you because he looks at you like Uncle Ron looks at Aunt Hermione. And you look just like her when Uncle Harry is not looking. With fond essasperation."
"Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I thought it would work coming from me." She looked at the small wound, tears welling up in her eyes. "I didn't mean to hurt you, Lucius, I'm so sorry."
“What?”
"Get my sister, please."
“Forgive me, but in public only ‘Master’ or ‘my Lord’ are appropriate forms of addressing one’s liege,” Lucius explained while they wandered the corridors to reach Harry and Neville’s office.
"Well," the young wizard grinned, "since Emerald usually has a favourite and prefers to listen to it over and over, I would say, Yes."
Judging the capable, young wizard, Narcissa wondered how someone so strong could harbour so many doubts. On the other hand, Augusta Longbottom had always had the highest expectations for herself and her family. She could easily see how that might stifle a young child that was unsure of itself. "What changed?"
The raven-haired rolled his eyes.
Stepping back, the raven shook his head, “No offence, Ron, but the last time I did, I was sweating blue for two days.”
With unexpected insight, the older wizard asked, "Harry, why would you think I consider this a competition between your father and me?"
"But that's not justice," Harry interrupted once again, though more quietly. "At least that is not how our system is supposed to work."
Surprised, Justin noticed, "These are cut for males."
Undoing all charms, putting the living−room back in order, Harry watched Draco pull the child away from the fireplace before inviting, "Come through, Neville."
Wistfully, the blond shared, "I wanted to study it, you know. I wanted to excel in potions to become a healer, one day. After everything we have done, everything my father did, the thought of following in his footsteps, managing and increasing the Malfoy fortune day in and day out, held little appeal to me. Somehow, some way, I wanted to try and make amends, to really make a difference by
When he turned the image, Draco nodded. "Quite poised, father. I like it."
"Professor! Please! It's not what you think!" Then Hermione came bounding around the corner, right into Harry's waiting arms before she could trip and hurt herself. Panting, she held on to her friend, forcing out between vast gulps of breath, "Lucius is here on my command, Sir. I convinced him to get us Harry's copy of the incident report of the Children of Hecate."
Ginny and George followed instantly, as did Hermione after taking a steeling breath. Her hand clutching Ron's in a vice−grip was the only indicator of her distress. Luna hovered at the door for a moment, looking towards the roof. "The gargoyles have done a poor job as of late. I will see if we can wake them up." She then glanced at Neville and when he gave her an encouraging nod, entered the house.
Taking it gratefully, the redhead shook his head. "How are you not still at the hospital?"
Narcissa, on the other hand, turned around and pricked her pinkie with one of her hairpins. Pressing the welling blood against her name in the tree, she declared, “I am Narcissa Malfoy nee Black. From this day on, as one of the last living members of our blood-line, I take responsibility for the Black family tree.”
Checking on the sauce, Draco added a dash of red pepper before praising, "That tastes amazing Kreacher. Very good!" Then he inquired, "What did you expect?"
Tonelessly, the man replied, "Apologies, my Lord."
"I researched it, of course."
"I have not managed to add Sirius’ name for more than four years. Do not worry too much, Narcissa. Powerful Black-family-magic cast him out. I guess we are not strong enough to match that."
Offering the barest of smiles, the house−elf bowed low. "What can Kreacher do for you, Mistress?"
Carefully balancing the tray of pies, the Lady closed the bracelet and tilted her head. "In that case, we will be honoured."
A deep voice startled them, as it summed up from the doorway, "So, let me get this straight. A convict, a former prisoner of Azkaban - both under the protection of the Auror Department - and one of our best law-witches … a former war-hero, I might add … are missing. And two of them have been abducted straight out of the Ministry of Magic."
Clutching his walking stock, Lucius ground his teeth, barely holding back from clocking Dolohov. Recalling his upbringing, the pureblood managed to reply calmly, "I am afraid, I do not have any liberties in that matter."
Trading a grin, the boys straightened.
When Neville and Harry came around, they were curled around each other, both clutching their wands in a vice−grip. They could feel the drainage of the shield-spells both had cast instinctively, but since everything was pitch−black, they did not dare to let off on their protective magic. Coughing and slightly pulling back from each other, they soon realized that they were trapped in a tiny cavern, surrounded by ruins.
Closing her eyes for a moment, the pureblood recalled, "Andromeda was married, so she can't inherit the Blacks' heirlooms. Your godson Edward, … well, he might, depending if you have children on your own or not." Clearing her throat, she allowed Harry to help her to her feet. "Anyway, Kreacher should be more respectful. His behaviour would reflect badly on you in certain company."
Dumbfounded, the young wizard looked from the carpet to the now closed door. What exactly had just happened?
"Gold is not eye-catching enough, and your father would look ridiculous in red."
Uneasy, Draco looked around, "Forgive me, Professor, but what are you implying?"
"Better?" The Potion Master inquired, apparently unfazed by the mental battle.
So once five o'clock rolled around, Lucius guided a tipsy Hermione - he had watched her alcohol consumption like a hawk, offering more and more juice with her spirits - to the floo-fires in the entrance hall, and handed her over to a concerned but grateful Ron, who dutifully listened to her rant about the stupid and prejudiced and short-sighted and idiotic and stuck-up witches and wizards of the Wizengamot.
Once the Malfoys and Teddy had left the kitchen to change, Harry called out, "Kreacher?"
"Kinky," George mumbled, "Should I have brought my own handcuffs, or do you think he will supply his?"
"Not a clue." Harry beamed, holding out his arms for the curly-haired redhead, who clung to Neville's hands for dear life. "Come on, Rose," he encouraged.
"Harry can. And considering that they are most likely held behind wards, we boosted his search a little, so to speak."
"Potter!" Snape roused, pulling back, so he could fold his arms.
"What do you mean, you can't get him? The entire point was Emerald bringing you to Draco, was you getting him home!" Harry snapped, glaring at his house-elf.
"What? No!" Harry exploded out of his chair.
Relaxing into the sofa, pulling his wife close, the redhead sneered. "Even in first year, we were smart enough not to drink anything we could not identify without the shadow of a doubt."
Leewood, however, brushed away that concern, "While I appreciate the quite in-depth analysis, Mr Weasley, I prepare to do my own research." His words were heavily laden with sarcasm, something Lucius had learned many people adopted when dealing with that particular Weasley. Not unexpected, the redhead offered a deep bow and made an inviting gesture.
With a chiding sound in Draco's direction, Emilia confirmed, "I won't introduce a new treatment without talking it though with you. But in the end, all legal decisions regarding your care have been made by Mr Harry Potter for the last five years. He pays all of your bills and generally makes sure that you have everything that you could possibly need."
The pureblood, however, did not seem to have a problem with the current line of inquiry. Casting his eyes back to the past, the man shook his head. "No, not at the beginning. I was engaged to her older sister, Andromeda, as you might know. But when she abandoned her family for that muggle-born Tonks, my father considered Narcissa a suitable replacement."
“Did the office send the casework already?”
“Thank you,” the blond replied, before adding, just as Harry was about to leave, “And thank you, for saving my father. I don’t know if I have said it before, but I am really grateful.”
"Ahm … does your grandmother know that I don't carry a wand for girl's exclusively?"
With a sigh, the young Auror gestured towards the chairs, “Sir, may I sit, please?”
"I know," Harry soothed the other wizard, gently reaching out. "Draco came to me, because his love for you was worth risking everything, just to give you a chance to live. Your family is such a strong unit, despite all the trials and tribulations you all have gone through. If the three of you don't get your chance for redemption, what would have been the point of it? A thirst for power and a desire to rise above all others made an orphaned half−blood a Dark Lord. If we can't accept that love is more important than power, the next war is just around the corner."
That prompted a small smile from the former Lord. "The brightest witch of our age, marrying into one of the bloodlines of old? How could I? If at all, I am jealous."
Despite that being true, the other wizard stated, "Had there not been a wand, you would have found another way to take him out. He threatened me."
Ever the sensible one, Hermione shook her head. "You can't take a child away the moment he or she shows magic. The parents will never agree to that."
"Excuse me?" The redhead snapped, not unexpectedly. "How could you even fathom …"
has to be the one to solve it. Because … I don't know … because our lives are so much more important than his, since we have families, people who love us."
"Lady Malfoy, are you alright?"
Harry enjoyed long naps between reheated meals and finally a reduced number of potions, while Draco managed to finish his first book from the Black library. The blond even sorted through several volumes that were to his liking and managed to narrow down a selection to three suitable alternatives to present, with the help of his mother. Still, he and Narcissa decided to wait for the next day, to ask Harry's permission for Draco to start another book.
Sensing his chance, Harry picked up the other half of his sandwich. Apparently by-his-leave, he asked, "Were you friends? You and Professor Snape I mean?"
"Meaning."
−−O−O−−
Shaking his head, Pince interrupted. "How would a broom help them? Honestly, have you lost your mind?"
Having already returned to the desk, letting Ron and Draco care for the dishes, Hermione admitted. "You have ideas for some pretty drastic changes. Considering our political climate, I considered it wise to share our ideas with a friend before we enter the plotting phase."
stupid!"
When tears sprang to his son's eyes, Lucius realised that - no matter how amicable Harry Potter usually was to their plights - his son's disrespect seemed to have exceeded his tolerance. The moment Draco hissed and fanned his mouth, reaching for his wine, Harry took it away, laughing. Anxious, Lucius wanted to speak up to ease his Lord's cruelty, when Narcissa put a hand on his arm, silencing him before he got the chance. He was then forced to watch as Harry handed over his beer, before reaching for one of the soft, fluffy, yellow squares he had piled up in the middle of the table.
When Teddy interrupted their conversation, announcing he was going to jump over a boulder, Harry's mask was firmly back in place. After the successful jump and the proper congratulations, Draco turned towards his former nemesis again, tilting his head humbly. "Thank you, for starting with mine."
When Harry stumbled out of the floo at Grimmauld Place a few hours later, he nearly fell into Lucius Malfoy's arms, who steadied him with a concerned look. "My liege? I was trying to reach you at the Ministry because Mrs Granger-Weasley has requested my presence in the courtroom two days from now. But I was told that you were unavailable. Is everything alright?"
Laughing and crying at the same time, Hermione hugged Ron tightly. "It's okay. We are okay. It's just Lucius. They tortured him, and I think he has gone into shock."
Shaking his head to wake himself up, Harry snatched Draco's cup and served himself some tea from the always steaming pot. "Ah, Earl Grey. How did you manage?"
For that question, the young man offered no immediate reply. Only when Severus tilted his chin up, forcing Harry to meet his eyes, the boy offered quietly, "Because you loved your mother. I … I thought you would appreciate the choice of taking her name over that of your father. I thought … I thought with a new name; you could start a new life. For real this time. Free of the burdens of your past. Also, they asked me right after the ceremony where I stood in for you receiving your Order of Merlin. I did not want to give them the chance to change their minds."
