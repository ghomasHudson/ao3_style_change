- Yes it is! Merlin, of all people, he is the one I can’t see you with. It’s one thing to support your friend when he’s gay, but you falling for this… tosser – Potter winced at what Wesley said – is a whole other barrel of Acromantula eggs.
‘You are definitely not giving up right now! You’re many things, Draco, but I’ll bet my own life you’re not a quitter.’
How in Merlin’s name was Harry going stir crazy (and drinking!) his fault anyway? Contrary to what his best friend said, there was no logic behind this particular chain of events. The fact that Malfoy was stuck there by Shacklebolt was in no way caused by Ron. He even suggested sending the git into Azkaban! And it’s not his fault that Shacklebolt chose Harry over him – he does have a wife and a kid at home, so keeping a drug-addicted ex-Death Eater there would be entirely irresponsible. Even Hermione agreed with him when he told her the story. And she said that maybe living with Malfoy for a while would give Harry a chance to shake off whatever happened last year between the two of them. And it seemed like it worked, all right, because Harry was
They all looked like they saw things they never wanted to see – Shacklebolt’s expression seemed determined and intimidating, Ron had pure horror painted on his face, and Neville looked absolutely terrified. Draco was still wrapped in Harry’s arms, crying quietly. They all stood there, in silence, waiting for one another to break it, but nobody seemed to have found the right words. Finally, it was Draco who spoke.
It took some time for the person to be done with whatever it was he was doing, so Ron waited patiently on his scour post on the boulder. He decided that confronting whoever this was right there in the middle of the field was a bad idea and it would be much safer to just follow him home and talk then. He was wary of the possibility that there might be the rest of the snatchers there, but he was certain that he would be able to defend himself if that was the case, and accidentally attracting Muggle’s attention with a confrontation out in the open wasn’t worth the risk. So he sat there, almost until sunrise, not letting himself look away from the figure in the field. Finally, when the bottom of Ron’s robes was completely soaked through by morning dew, the person collected his herbs and turned around, seemingly heading to wherever it was he was living.
Nevertheless, he knew what he had to do. Armed with a list of potions that might prove useful in his current state copied from Malfoy’s book, he carefully returned the manual to its (hopefully) original position and decided that he had to stop by the Apothecary in Hogsmeade on Saturday. It was almost sunrise when he finally managed to get some sleep.
- What the fuck is that? – There was a mixture of fear and disgust all over his face. Draco had to act quickly.
‘Harry!’ Ron’s voice brought him back to reality. There was no time to waste – he ran through the door, shouting at Neville to watch over Draco, and began gathering as much of whatever was in there as he could. He didn’t even know what he was grabbing and where it was going, couldn’t hear anything that was going on behind him – all he could focus on was trying to get out of there and back to safety as soon as possible.
They all took out their wands and, raising them above their heads, they walked one by one through the gate. Harry, Ron and Neville were already on the other side, but when Draco tried to follow them, the gate turned into a solid wall.
to use your keys every time?’ Harry spat. ‘I gave you those for emergencies, not so you can waltz in here like you own the place!’ It was safe to assume he was still angry at the redhead, for whatever reason.
Draco was slowly regaining control of himself. He knew he needed to do something, anything, to try and keep Potter alive. He knew he wouldn’t be able to manage this on his own – he had no supplies and no time to brew anything and his own stash of potions taken from Snape’s office after the final battle (for commemoration purposes only, obviously) was way too limited to deal with this situation.
- No, no, don’t look at me like that, please. I didn’t mean to hurt you. Like I said, I don’t know what it is. If I’m being honest, I have never really been in love with anyone, so I just don’t know what it feels like. I’ve been trying to figure this out ever since we came back, I talked to Ron, but he was no help, I don’t know how to determine what it is that I’m feeling. It’s just confusing, until today I thought you loathed me, so I tried to push all that away and just hate you like I used to, but I can’t.
- Oh, you’re too kind baby. – Harry stepped into the room, closing the door behind him and wrapped his hands around Draco’s waist. – You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in a while, you know? If you’re as mesmerizing later on as you’re now, I might have just found myself my new favourite company around here…
‘Whatever it was, it looks horrible. Do any of you have any idea what the hell do we do now?’ Harry was furious.
be employed as an Auror, he will not have all the privileges and duties you have. I will not, however, inquire how you two divide the work between yourselves, as long as all the reports and paperwork are signed by you and you only, and any court cases that may arise will be prosecuted on your own – Mr. Malfoy will have no standing as a prosecutorial representative in court. Other than that, you are free to work together as you would with Mr. Weasley. And please, leave whatever it is that you have with Mr. Malfoy, at home. I do not condone office romances or public displays of affection.’ Harry was too ecstatic with the prospect of him and Draco working together to even be bothered that now, apparently, even his boss believed that there was something between them.
- Oh, that you do, no doubt. And rather expertly at that if one is to believe what was said by… - Harry didn’t hear the end of that sentence. He was out the door as fast as he could without raising suspicions.
‘Well, that much I know actually, I’m not completely oblivious, but why are they going so fast? How do they know where to go and how not to hit the others? And how on Earth are we getting to the other side?!’ It was clear she was starting to panic. Draco, on the other hand, seemed intrigued by the moving cars.
‘You will never guess who just got hired in the Office!’ Ron was visibly angry – he treated his job at the Auror Office
A narrow black door appeared in front of him. At first glance, it looked like it was just a storage closet, but Harry felt the dark energy radiating off of it. It was only when he looked at the doorknob, he saw a bloody handprint on it. He reached to turn it, but when he touched it, it burned. He pulled his hand back instinctively.
‘It doesn’t matter if it was properly used or not, my father will probably think it was illegal anyway.’ Draco smiled. ‘As long as it has been used and he knows it, he’ll believe me.’
‘Herbs. That’s all you need to know. And to answer your inquiry, I don’t know who these people are, I don’t work with them.’
Harry didn’t even register his journey back to Grimmauld Place. His head was throbbing and his thoughts were all jumbled up – Neville was dead, someone killed him in Harry’s own house, and now Harry was the main suspect of the case. And as if that wasn’t enough the case was being investigated by Malfoy. He was just reaching the conclusion that things couldn’t possibly get any worse, when he heard tapping on his living room window. He approached and saw a small barn owl sitting on a windowsill, holding a piece of parchment. With a heavy heart, Harry opened the window and took the parchment.
- No idea. He mixed some pre-made potions and I didn’t see the labels. There was a lot of it though.
‘No need. It just comes out and you’re ready to eat it. And no need to clean anything afterwards. Actually, a lot of Muggle food comes in a can – some of it you don’t spray, like soups for example, you just open the can, plop the soup into a pot and heat it up. Muggles are really big on making food quick to prepare. Take microwave dishes for example…’
Several hours later Harry was sitting in his office, trying to concentrate and get all his paperwork done before his meeting with the Chief of Aurors, but his mind was occupied by thoughts of his talk with Draco that morning.
‘Thank you.’ He managed through a strained throat. That was all he could bear right now – he stood up and walked into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him.
- Oh, come on, Harry. – Harry was surprised that Pansy addressed him by his first name. – We’re just joking. You’ll need to get used to that anyway, so why not start now? Come on, we’re heading to breakfast and then to the library since the first period is free. Come with us. – All three of them extended their arms welcomingly, so Harry followed them, feeling slightly better about their attitude towards him.
the events?’ Potter’s face lit up. Surprisingly, Draco found this image absurdly sweet. ‘Consider this: they go to a location. They select the victim and they need to find out if it’s a viable target. We already established that the potential victim’s reaction to some sort of magical incident would prove if they are a witch or wizard and if they have someone to talk to. So they provoke a reaction themselves!’
‘No, she was there collecting ingredients!’ Potter was all hyped up now, he didn’t even seem to notice how close he was to Draco. ‘I mean, what Muggle would run around in a field in the middle of the night picking up herbs? The snatchers had to have seen it and they had to make the same conclusion!’
The tarte miraculously turned out pretty decent, despite Draco’s reservations about it, so the three of them spent the rest of the day stuffing their faces with it and cleaning up the mess the boys made (not without some difficulty on their part – Draco managed to send the dishes through the window instead of into the sink and Harry somehow transfigured the rag, that was supposed to wipe the table, into a rather exquisite-looking tablecloth). Harry gave the Malfoys a brief lecture on cell phones (and for the first time Draco appeared to be impressed by Muggle inventions: ‘So it’s like when you use the Floo network to talk to people, but you can use it anywhere you like? That actually sounds useful!’) and washing machines (those, in turn, didn’t impress Narcissa much, since for some reason she was afraid her robes would just end up being sucked into the water pipe and lost forever).
what you’re focusing on now, Draco?’ He didn’t sound annoyed, more amused rather. ‘I’ve got my secrets, baby…’
- Well, it ties into that. Before you ask, Ron, I still don’t know how I feel about Draco, but there’s even more to that.
- I mean, I’m kind of worried for you because of your history with Mal- Draco. You were enemies for so long that it’s a little weird you’d end up like that. I’m just wondering if you’re completely sure it’s all behind you two, because if it isn’t this might not end well. But if you are, I’m happy for you.
The world was a whirlwind. Malfoy’s lips were on his, he was being pressed into the other man’s body, his own hands running through Malfoy’s hair. It felt like silk, Harry thought vaguely, before he felt Draco’s lips move down onto his neck, sucking at his pulse point. Harry threw back his head and moaned. It seemed to break whatever spell they’ve fallen under, because suddenly there was a cold breeze pricking Harry’s neck and Draco was sitting opposite him again.
Well, there you go. Yet another violent smut, because apparently I'm utterly unable to write a sane and safe sex scene (I'm trying though! For later, that is).
‘What? I thought he was some deputy-something in the Department, not an Auror…’ Harry didn’t understand.
- “Take care”? – Harry desperately hoped Draco meant the better one of to things that just popped into his head. The solo version.
- And now, the knight in the shining armour appears! All bow down to Sir Malfoy of The Slime-y Gitness! The damsel is no longer in distress, all is well in the kingdom! – Ron was practically radiating mockery. Draco seemed to regain some composure.
- Go where? Can any of you actually explain what on Earth are you talking about? – Draco was losing patience rapidly.
– it was all nothing compared to what he was feeling right now. It was like something was sucking his insides, all his blood and his soul out of his body.
‘So what, we’re friends with benefits?’ Harry felt bitter when Draco said they were not a couple – it sounded so definitive, like he wouldn’t even consider it. But even friends with benefits was better than nothing, Harry thought, so he’d take it.
‘If you say so. But if this turns into a disaster, it’s your fault!’ With that, Draco ran the tap and poured significantly more water into the bowl. The mixture quickly turned into sort of a mud consistency.
‘I think I can manage that particular task by myself, thank you.’ Draco was clearly annoyed, but Harry knew it was just because he was mentally kicking himself for not making the connection between the Muggle train and Hogwarts Express. When the blonde returned, he looked absolutely disgusted. ‘There is a hole in the floor! A
. He was not suicidal, he merely wanted to get rid of his own body. Who he once was, was dead the moment he stepped foot out of the Ministry of Magic after his parents’ sentencing, so it was only logical the body would follow suit.
‘As per Wizengamot Operation Decree – Amendment 23-101-A, prosecutor may be questioned as a witness in the case so long as he does not possess knowledge of any other testimonies given in front of the Wizengamot.’ The same small wizard that reminded Harry of Flitwick said. Harry was quickly growing to dislike him. ‘And so, as long as Mr. Potter is the first witness we hear, he can resume his normal role later on.’
‘The matter at hand today is the case held by the Auror Office, represented by Auror Ronald Bilius Weasley, versus Draco Lucius Malfoy.’ Kingsley started ‘Am I correct that the accused, to be questioned right now, is Draco Lucius Malfoy, son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, age 20, born June 5
- Oh my God, where do you even come from? – She was laughing. – You poor thing, have you been living under a rock?
‘Well, now we have two options. Either we get a cab, which is more expensive, or if you’re up for some more adventures, we can take the Underground.’ Harry smiled.
What Draco didn’t feel, however, was the thin strip of silk that was so carefully wrapped around his Dark Mark, snagging on one of the nails that kept the curtains in place, and coming undone, slipping down his arm. His hands were still behind his head, his Dark Mark on full display. Before he could react, Potter saw it.
He knew he was screwed the moment he opened the bathroom door and saw Potter standing there (fully clothed, thank God!) looking rather worried.
Back in the room, once he realized Potter is still very much alive (is he seriously immortal like the gossip says? No, that can’t be it, he must have been just lucky to somehow find correct, non-lethal, proportions), Draco sighed with relief and sat down at the foot of Potter’s bed. Minutes went by and what Zabini said was replaying in Draco’s head over and over again. Was it really just his insistence to avoid Azkaban at all costs that led him to where he is now, or was there something more to the story? Draco finally managed to admit to himself that he did not in fact hate Potter, but did that mean he was falling in love? No, that’s too far. He simply cared about his well-being. He didn’t want the bloody Chosen One to die because that would mean the whole war was for nothing.
, in part), keeping Draco close to him was somehow a better option than distancing himself from him completely. Sure, it hurt to know they would never be as close as Harry would like - some days it seemed like an unbearably painful burden in fact - but Harry knew that if they were to never see each other again, he would feel the same as when he thought Draco was dead, and he wasn’t willing to go through that again. So he chose this particular version of suffering, just because of those rare moments the two of them smiled at each other or joked, because it felt like he could just about pretend that they were
- Oh, you mean your outburst at Weasel? For what it’s worth, we found it exceptionally amusing. – Pansy grinned at him. – Who knew a couple of days with Draco would turn you into a Slytherin?
It all started with a sudden impression, that he smelled, very faintly, whatever it was that hugged him when he used to fall asleep in Potter’s bed. He opened the window to get some fresh air and felt a cold, winter breeze prick his skin – and that all of a sudden led to a flashback to how it felt when Potter stood from the couch after they managed to make some progress in the case. And how he felt before it. He hadn’t even registered it then, but now it was crystal clear – it was the same sensation as what Potter’s fingers closing on his wrist days prior gave him. What in Merlin’s name was going on with him? It wasn’t that he was falling in love with the git, that much he knew for sure, because no matter what people said, Draco knew how love felt. It wasn’t burning, it wasn’t leaving him unbearably cold when it went away, it was more of a sense of safety and tranquillity that spread through his veins. But if not love, than what? Hatred made no sense, because there would be relief the moment Potter’s bedroom door shut behind him and there wasn’t any of it – he would just feel cold and alone.
- Uhm… - Harry hesitated. It was clear he was embarrassed about his fantasies. – I think… Well, I know… I want to go all the way with you. – That last part came out in one breath, like Harry was scared of what he was saying.
- Oh, you beg so good… - By now he was completely cold and dominant, like he often was. He felt adrenaline rush through his veins when he pressed one finger inside his boyfriend. He vaguely registered small drops of precome on himself when he heard Harry’s breath hitch. But he knew he needed more, he needed to hear animal-like moans. Without thinking, he slipped the second finger in. Oh yes, this was the moaning he needed.
‘Don’t get angry at us, we didn’t do it!’ Neville seemed scared. ‘We can’t go back, we need to get this done tonight – besides, I’m not even sure the gate will let us pass again. I’ll try and find something that would at least help with the pain, and you two send a message to the Minister to send someone to lift all of this so we can get out.’ He was rummaging through his pockets looking for some antidote, and in the meantime Ron sent his patronus to London. Finally, after what felt like ages, Neville pulled out a small vial and poured some green potion Harry didn’t recognize onto Draco’s wrist. ‘There. I don’t know if it will heal this, but it should keep it from worsening and help with the pain. How are you feeling?’
‘You’re a masochist, Potter. This crap is more painful than the cut itself!’ The stinging didn’t go away at all. ‘Fine, have at it, try and seal this. But if I end up with even a scar, you’ll regret it!’
‘Don’t worry about Ron, I’ll handle him. And as for me being stuck here – well, we just have to make sure you give your side of the story before they do. Once we have your testimony, I’m free to leave you here.’
‘What are you doing here? Came to rub my nose in the fact that you’re a free man?’ It was evident that Lucius still hated him, possibly even more than before.
- No, I don’t know it. All I have to go off of is what he said during his trial and what you’re telling me now. And neither of you are exactly the most reliable source of information on that. I was at his house if you don’t remember, and he didn’t seem like he was willing to try to sabotage the operation there.
‘You’ll have to. I’m intent on keeping you alive.’ Potter smiled slightly. It was the first time Draco actually saw him smile at him – or even in his presence.
- Watch your language please, Mr. Potter. I am well aware of your history with Mr Malfoy and in my opinion, you’re the only one that is capable both of restraining yourself in the face of confrontation and defending yourself should the confrontation escalate nonetheless. Mr Wesley is far too hot tempered for this kind of company, Mr. Longbottom would most likely not be able to defend himself, and as for Mr. Thomas and Mr. Finnigann, well, frankly, I didn’t even consider rooming either of them with Mr. Malfoy.
‘Of course he did, he’s been messing with you! He waited a month to figure you out! Don’t you think it’s a little weird he suddenly got interested in the case? Why not from the start?’ Weasley was shaking his head in disbelief.
It took nearly a minute for it to strike him what the implications of that last thought were. If Potter dying meant that the war accomplished nothing, that would mean that – from his own perspective – the object of the war was not to defeat the Dark Lord but to keep Potter alive. But why would he care about that? Draco sighed audibly. Maybe his friends weren’t all that wrong after all? Maybe there was something there?
- Why fucked-up? What would be so bad there? Is it bad that I could potentially have feelings for him?
- I am, no problem. – Draco loosened. – Although, in the spirit of honesty, you probably need to know that Parkinson, Nott and Zabini know who I am and how I approach relationships. I’ve been down that road before you see, and they’ve witnessed that. But they know better than to go around and blab about it to everyone, so you don’t need to worry about anything getting out as long as Weasel keeps his mouth shut.
‘But…’ Neville was stuttering. ‘but how do you just not think about it? It’s… What you went through… I mean…’
For the next week each day looked the same – Draco fully awake for the whole night, going to sleep in Potter’s bed as soon as the other man entered the kitchen. Or at least that’s how Draco hoped Potter would see it. He didn’t know why exactly Potter would let him sleep in his bed every day but it didn’t even matter – it was the only way he could find some peace and serenity now, since each night was getting progressively worse than the previous one with, what Draco concluded to be withdrawal symptoms, getting stronger and stronger. Thursday Draco has spent eight hours pacing nervously around Potter’s living room shaking like a leaf and by Friday night he thought he was going to die from pain and nervousness. It was like he was trapped there, Voldemort and all his cohorts lurking outside the windows, while he was lying on the floor in a fetal position crying, because his whole skin was simultaneously being burned with a million cigarette buds and pricked with even more needles. Come morning, he thought he never felt so bad in his life. It proved to be very naïve of him though, because the next night he was just straight up being
‘I don’t know. They are looking for a night guard at St. Mungo’s so I’ll probably try there for a job and find myself some place to live.’
- Yeah, sure, brilliant idea! A suicide note will OF COURSE erase all the suspicions they… - he stopped. He reached the list Potter copied and if he was correct in deciphering the handwriting, what Potter drank was enough to knock out a full-grown troll for weeks. Or kill a smaller one. Frankly, the fact that Potter was still conscious was a miracle in itself. – Please, for the love of God, do not tell me that last one on your list is the 86…
‘Oh, I see…’ Arthur’s expression was unreadable. ‘And have you visited…’ He paused, just like Draco did.
- No, no, it’s not her. She was actually really sweet. I told them about the sub thing and she completely understood what I meant. She seemed ok with it all, me being what I am, you explaining all of this…
Draco’s heart stopped. So Potter really told everyone how Draco was getting by on his exile. His mouth became dry and his vision got blurry. He ran out of Diagon Alley. He was never coming back, the last remnants of hope he kept alive deep down died. There was truly no place for him in the wizarding world anymore.
Draco wanted to tell him that he won’t, that he could never leave him alone ever again, but a knock on the door stopped him.
- I bloody live with you, they’ll blame me! – That was only part of the reason Draco was freaking out, but Potter didn’t need to know that.
Ok, so here it is (*nervous*).  I tried to avoid it being cringy as much as possible, but I don't know how well that turned out.
It was nearly Christmas and Harry Potter was once again spending his night behind his desk at his Auror office. Ever since he and Ginny split, Christmas was his least favourite time of the year. Of course, he was invited to spend it with the Weasleys at the Burrow, but he didn’t want to be around anybody right now, especially around happy couples like Ron and Hermione, Bill and Fleur, and, worst of all, Ginny and Dean. No, he’d much rather dedicate his evenings to cracking a new, rather difficult, case of a possible discovery of a cursed object in a former Death Eater’s home. But that proved to be more challenging that he anticipated – mostly because, Harry concluded after catching himself mentally drifting away from his paperwork for the third time that evening, all he could really think about was how sick he was of his life right now. He has long abandoned the quest to find himself a girl to settle with, but it didn’t mean he was ok with being alone – it was just simply the case of being sick of being viewed as The Chosen One instead of Harry Potter. He sighed and pushed his papers away. No, he won’t be able to get any work done tonight, he might as well go out, get drunk by himself in some Muggle bar and go find himself paid company for the night.
By the time they found themselves outside the gates of Malfoy Manor the next night, it was pitch black outside. The wind was howling, whipping them with freezing bursts that were almost painful. They were all incredibly cold, but Harry suspected that the shaking of Draco’s hand he felt where their fingers were laced together wasn’t entirely caused by the dismal weather.
‘I was, but I popped over to Harry’s on the way and he’s acting weird…’ He plopped down on a chair beside his wife. ‘I’m starting to get worried.’
Draco was absolutely terrified. He didn’t even remember how on Earth he got back to Mina’s apartment and into the shower. If Potter decided to go to the Daily Prophet with his story, he wouldn’t even need any proof – he was The Chosen One, nobody dared to question what he said. And besides, the vultures at the Prophet weren’t exactly going out of their way to corroborate stories like that. And if it ever came out what Draco has become, it would be over. He might be reduced to selling himself for money, but the Malfoy name still had to be upheld, it was just how he was brought up. Even his parents walked out of the Ministry to be escorted to Azkaban with their heads held high. He couldn’t let it happen. He needed a plan however, and that he was in no shape to achieve right now.
Do let me know what you think :) And thanks for the Kudos I've gotten so far, you're really sweet! :)
- Well, where I work there is a panic button and several bodyguards, but we’re a high-end establishment. If a client is misbehaving, he’s just thrown out and banned. But in those cheaper, lower-end ones, you just need to deal with that on your own.
‘No. If it’s good you have at least half an hour of just floating there. And if it’s amazing, well, that’s like the best high you could ever have.’ He trailed off for a second before realizing he was still sitting on Potter’s couch.
Draco climbed up, wrapping Harry in his arms. Harry was shaking and panting. It was clear he hasn’t come like that ever before.
The next two days were spent packing and laughing as Draco and Harry got ready to leave the Manor and move in to Grimmauld Place on their own. On the last day of August they were all ready to go, equipped with some of Narcissa’s homecooked meals (‘Because you’ll be too busy running around like excited children to cook!’) and a couple of bottles of Coca-Cola Harry got as a surprise for Draco. They were escorted out of the gate by a very moved (and very teary-eyed) Narcissa and got ready to go start their lives as adults.
‘You love me, remember? I’m irresistible and you can’t live without me! And so far, you’re yet to poison me, so I suppose it suits you.’ Harry grinned.
- Baby, don’t be. – Draco smiled. So Harry was embarrassed about finishing so quickly. It was somehow endearing. – It’s a compliment for me.
When they reached Madame Malkin’s Draco loosened a little. The store was empty so there were no prying eyes disturbing them – at least not until the door opened and Dean Thomas entered, holding hands with none other than Ginny Wesley.
- I don’t know, I told you already! – Potter (by now Draco managed to get his head straight and go back to “Potter”) was getting agitated. – He doesn’t seem like himself lately. He just keeps to himself and stays inside most of the time. I even heard his friends being worried for him last night.
For a second everything went completely dark as Draco felt a searing pain tearing along his spine. He didn’t know where it came from or what was it, it was like nothing he could even imagine. He didn’t know if he came right then and there when he screamed just as he felt whoever was fucking him came inside of him.
‘I told you, Wesley, I know nothing about this.’ Malfoy was getting a little angry – to Harry it seemed like whatever he must have taken was slowly leaving his bloodstream.
- I don’t know, I just… I just don’t. I have no idea how to explain it, it’s weird to me too. I was so used to hating him for over seven years now that I can’t wrap my head around it.
- That? I don’t know. I didn’t do it. – He shrugged. Harry looked at Nott with a mixture of fear and disgust, but Nott didn’t meet his eyes. It was evident he regretted the whole situation.
‘Draco, let me have this one! It’s not every day your only child is about to become an independent adult and move out from under your care. Oh, that reminds me! Now that you’re about to be working citizens, you need new robes! Your school ones won’t be appropriate anymore, we need to go get you two some working-people-attire!’
‘Oh, yes, of course! Harry, I’m assuming you’re going through with the Auror thing, right? Ron’s applying too! Hermione’s thinking about some sort of ministry position, although if you ask me, I don’t see her behind a desk. What about you, Draco?’
- It makes sense. – Harry concluded. – Either way, after there were no obstacles and I didn’t find myself looking for her, I started to analyse this and I realised I was actually attracted to guys. But in all honesty, I’m not entirely sure if what I feel for you means I’m falling for you or if it’s the same thing I felt towards Ginny.
‘I think this will do! Although, I’m not sure I’m quite ready for making the knife cut by itself, I think it’s safer if I do this by hand…’ It took only a couple of seconds before he cursed loudly enough to alarm half the town. ‘Fuck, I’ve cut myself! How do Muggles even do this and still have all of their fingers?!’
‘Oh, so you’re on first-name basis now? This is getting interesting…’ Ron had way too much of a sly expression for his face now for Harry’s taste. He felt the sudden urge to punch him.
‘Slow down, Draco. We can work together like I would do with Ron normally, so you can join me in groundwork, but all the paperwork is to be signed by me only. And you can’t stand in court with me. Other than that, we’re free to figure it out for ourselves. Of course, they’ll be watching us closely, because now apparently even the Chief thinks we’re
‘I…’ Ron looked at the pair, still on the floor, and Draco still very much naked, although in some wave of post-orgasm clarity he threw his t-shirt over his hips so he wasn’t entirely exposed. ‘WHAT THE FUCK?!’
- So what Malfoy, now you’re an expert on all things Gryffindor? – Ron clearly wasn’t having any of it. – I swear to Merlin, if you badmouth one of my friends one more time…
- Well, now that there is only five Gryffindors in our year we’ll have to figure out how to play all over again… - Harry assumed they were talking about Quidditch. – And both Neville and Hermione are afraid of flying, so really there are only us three: you, me and Dean. And even then, nobody will play against us, Hufflepuffs have no team, Ravenclaws are lacking a keeper…
‘Interesting… Anyone in particular?’ Sober Harry would be mortified right now, but drunk Harry was having fun.
- So, Harry, what’s the problem? – Hermione was just now climbing down from Ron’s lap to sit next to him on her bed.
‘Whatever. If he’s guilty, his accomplices will be enough to convict him, no matter how hard he tries to get out of it. Now, will you help me or not?’
- Oh, I think you can count at least two there, Seam. – Ron and Seamus were joined by Dean. – Or at least if we’re counting more distant history than just the last two weeks.
- Leave Harry alone. You want to fight me? Go ahead, let’s see what you’ve got. But leave Harry out of this.
‘Harry found me and I thought he was going to tell everyone. I couldn’t take it, so I ran.’ Draco was just hoping that this would be enough, that Veritaserum wouldn’t make him say anything else.
run into him and he goes off the grid, then you’re moping for over a year about it, and now you’ve recruited him to work the case with you. It all seems a bit iffy in you ask me.’
‘Well, that you’re right about.’ Draco smiled hesitantly. ‘He’d never say that. I’m really trying to be my own person but it’s not easy, not after years of being raised like I was.’
‘That was actually Harry’s idea, Minister.’ To Ron’s right, Draco was looking like he was about to say something, but he was promptly silenced by Shacklebolt’s raised hand.
- I’m pretty sure it has been the same thing Draco has been lost in since Herbology on Thursday… - Pansy drew all the syllables in an annoying manner. – He has a thing for Potter and now he knows Potter has a thing for someone, so Draco is hoping there is a future there!
- I never realized you cared for him. – He was back to that bemused, slightly superior tone of voice Harry loathed. - And my relationships with other people is none of your business. On that note, I think this discussion leads nowhere. If you’d excuse me, I’m going back to my book. Be so kind as to not attack me when you come back to OUR room, I’d rather not spend any time in the Hospital Wing, as far as I know Daley is there and he snores. – With that, he turned around and walked back. Harry could hear the door to their shared bedroom shutting behind him.
It was a week since classes started. Harry wasn’t particularly happy about being forced to share a room with Malfoy of all people – not when Ron got to share with Neville and Seamus was roomed with Dean. In all fairness, he expected there to be a hex duel within the first hour, but to his surprise, Malfoy seemed different – more subdued perhaps? He didn’t know what it was, but really all that mattered was that the Slytherin kept to himself and didn’t bother him at all – in fact, Harry couldn’t recall a single word spoken to him when they were in the room. It was like living with a mute Hermione – Malfoy just laid on his bed for hours on end, reading advanced potions books. Harry was somehow grateful for it, but it didn’t stop him from asking McGonagall what was she thinking assigning them both to one room – the most secluded one at that.
year all over again and Harry didn’t trust him enough to share how he got his name into the Goblet of Fire. He felt completely stupid – it seemed like he hasn’t matured a day since then, just like all those years ago he lashed out on his best friend out of something that wasn’t even there. Because if he really focused and tried to understand what Harry was
‘We are Mrs. Wesley. In fact, we’re getting married.’ He noticed the expression on her face and quickly added: ‘We talked a lot, both with Draco and Mrs. Malfoy, and they have really come a long way since the war. I know you probably have your reservations and I understand them, but I’m happy and I’d really like for this to work out, you know?’
‘It’s… it’s normal, I guess. Just sex. You do it, you feel good for a second while you come and then you just go back to your life.’ He glanced up hesitantly. ‘I’m sure all sex works that way if you think about it.’
- Thanks Pansy. – Hermione sent her a small smile and walked out. Ron shook his head and followed her.
‘It means a lot to have your support in this, honestly.’ Harry smiled, trying to convene how grateful he was. ‘But what about you, Draco? Have you thought about your career?’
‘I always hated that thing…’ Draco muttered, following Harry’s gaze up ‘it’s preposterous, but my mother insisted it stayed.’
For the remainder of the lesson everyone was working in silence. Hermione was white as a ghost and seemed so panicked that her potion ended up looking like concrete at the bottom of her cauldron. Harry abandoned his completely – he couldn’t concentrate anyway. By the time Slughorn came back to inspect their work only Draco and Pansy have achieved a satisfying result.
- I swear, I’m not lying. Why would I be? Does this mean something? My friend brought the sketch one day and we all liked it, I don’t know where he got it from.
‘What happened now?’ Harry wondered what got Ron so riled up – he loved his job, so whatever pushed him to even consider quitting must have been something major.
happened before! It’s like an unofficial rule, the old Chief appoints a new one and there’s nobody in between!’
No, God, not the ‘instinct’ again! Why was it that any time the ‘instinct’ came up, it always had something to do with Malfoy?
let a suspect in the case get involved like that, no matter your personal relationship with them. Now, Mr. Weasley, what you presented in this courtroom today was entirely inappropriate and out of place. Not only did you try to convince us that Mr. Potter had some sort of physical relationship with Mr. Malfoy, but also you used your own personal relationships with both of them to push your narrative. Not to mention that said behaviour caused you to draw conclusions from the facts that you obtained outside your job and that had no standing in the case. And, if I were in Mr. Potter’s position right now, I would carefully reconsider the stance of my friendship with you. Frankly, the only person who behaved rationally and appropriately during this case, was the suspect himself, Mr. Malfoy.’ Ron looked white as a sheet, completely shocked. ‘And now, for the verdict itself: in the matter of Malfoy, Draco Lucius – the verdict is: innocent. You’re cleared of all charges, Mr. Malfoy.’
‘Jesus, how do you not know this?’ Harry laughed slightly. A little bit of the bitterness lifted. ‘It’s like friends who have sex without actually being together.’
‘Malfoy, don’t!’ Ron shouted, but it was too late. The second Draco uttered the first spell, a thin rope of fire shot out of the gate and wrapped itself around his wrist. It was all too quick for Harry to see – all he registered was Draco’s scream and then falling onto his back, something heavy on top of him. It took a second to realize what happened – Draco must have been pulled through the gate by the rope of fire, like a prisoner being escorted into their cell. That analogy proved to be problematic, however, because Harry had no idea if they were going to be able to get out of the Manor at all, now that is was apparently serving as a prison for its ‘invader’. Harry groaned in frustration getting up – it was like the Ministry didn’t trust Draco even after they’ve offered him a job, at least not enough to actually do anything about the enchantments they’ve set in place to keep the ex-Death Eaters out. And the fact that nobody bothered to warn them was even worse. However, when he looked at Draco, his thoughts came to a screeching halt.
‘Harry!’ Arthur greeted him. ‘It’s been too long! We’ve missed you!’ his glance went to Draco ‘And this must be Mr. Malfoy Jr.! Arthur Wesley, hello, welcome to our home!’ It was a bit stiff, but nothing Harry wouldn’t foresee – after all, Ron’s and Draco’s fathers weren’t exactly friends.
Draco felt a mixture of hope and panic bubbling up. Did Harry really want him to do that? Or was it just exhaustion and the shock of realization of his true identity talking?
And now he was back at Hogwarts. Harry really hoped his last year would be peaceful and that he would be able to just concentrate on finishing his education and getting a job. Or actually, finishing his education and figuring out what the hell to do with himself – he wanted to be an Auror ever since his 4
And so one night, after Potter refused (again) to go to bed like a normal human being and leave him be, Draco sat down on Potter’s kitchen island and asked:
‘What you did was not your fault. He made you do this, he tortured you into obeying him.’ Harry cupped Draco’s face in his hands, looking directly into those steel eyes. ‘You can’t be blamed for that.’
‘You have to be seventeen to drive if I remember correctly. Why are you asking? You want to learn?’ Harry was intrigued by his boyfriend’s sudden interest in driving.
- Draco, don’t do it. – Harry reached out and pulled the arm towards him. – I love you, I love all of you, even this. – He raised Draco’s arm to his lips and placed a kiss on the mark. – We all have a past. It’s all behind you. You never wanted this, I know it. It only shows what you’ve been through, what made you the person you are now.
- OH RON! – Hermione was crying and throwing her arms around her boyfriend’s neck. – You don’t have an emotional range of a teaspoon! – Both Harry and Draco started laughing.
Draco moaned at the request. There was no time for subtlety, they wanted each other right then and there – before Harry could even register what was going on, his jeans and underwear were on the floor and he was bracing himself against the windowsill, Draco behind his back muttering a lubrication spell. He felt those long, elegant fingers sliding along his slit with the faintest touch, but he couldn’t wait anymore. He pushed back against Draco’s hand and heard him chuckle.
‘Go ahead.’ Harry was determined not to even look at him. He was still too angry at all Ron has done.
‘You… you love me?’ Harry whispered, breaking the silence that fell on the room following Draco’s confession.
‘Interesting, Mr. Potter… I’ve been a part of this court for several years now and I have never heard an Auror say he believes his own suspect is innocent.’
- I don’t know what you’re talking about. Please, just stop this. – Draco was trying to shield his mind from Potter just like Bellatrix used to teach him to in his previous life, but it was too late. It felt like his head was being split in half and all of a sudden all the memories from Hogwarts started flowing right before his eyes.
‘We’re moving into Grimmauld Place.’ Harry smiled. It was good to have Ginny back on their side. ‘And really, we haven’t even thought about all that yet, we need to get our work situation sorted out first.’
But this time, it was Harry who was battling sleepless nights. The longer they went on ignoring each other, the less Harry was confused with his own sexuality and with the fact that he was now apparently developing a crush on Malfoy – because that was the conclusion he reached some week into their spat – and the more he felt rejected and alone. Malfoy didn’t want him, he said so himself, and even if Harry hoped, on some level, that he didn’t mean it, his insistence to not even utter a single word towards Harry proved that that hope was way too far-fetched. So Harry closed off again, surrounding himself with a thick wall of stubborn grief over something he never had (it felt almost the same as over a year ago, when he thought Draco was dead), admiring the blonde from far away, like a treasure he would never be able to even come close to, let alone actually have. He would be fine with it, really, if it wasn’t for the memory of their one and only kiss that felt like a thorn in his side, burning and digging deeper and deeper into his body and soul any time he tried to take a breath. That one kiss was all Harry’s own brain needed to have to torture him endlessly, night after night, when he laid there, on his bed, staring at the ceiling, desperately trying to block the faint scent of who was there before him, from causing him to cry. He was over it all at this point: he cried, he drank, he briefly contemplated killing himself, but decided it wasn’t wort it – not for his sake, but for Draco’s, because if he was to be found dead in an apartment the two of them shared, Draco would have no way to prove it was a suicide. No, he needed to do something, anything, to break out of this, because if he was going to go on like this, nothing good could come out of it.
- I am. Completely. I love you, you know. – He leaned in to kiss Draco and moved his hand down, below the waistband of Draco’s sweats.
Harry laughed. ‘Well, you’ll have to work on your patience then, because it’s not like you’re going to heal everyone within your magical 10-minute time limit.’
It took over a week for Harry to get strong enough to hold a conversation: in fact, for the first few days after he opened his eyes, he wasn’t even able to utter a single word without blacking out again.
It wasn’t that he regretted his decision to still help the blonde out with a job and a place to live, not by any means – he decided some time ago that even though there was no chance of the two of them ever having any sort of relationship (thanks to
- Are you BLIND?! It’s obvious! Malfoy’s a bloody pervert! He clearly messed with your head trying to get you to sleep with him! He wants to tie you up or whatever his degenerate brain came up with and fuck you!
Because really, there was no connection between Harry-Yasmine-Malfoy triangle and the case of the snatchers. There really wasn’t, Malfoy would’ve ended up being forced on him even if Yasmine never existed.
- I knew that. To me it doesn’t matter, I ended up alive because of what she did and that’s all the Wizengamot needed to know. If I told the truth, she would end up in Azkaban with your father and I knew by then that you were getting off, so I didn’t want you to end up an orphan like me.
- No I didn’t! I can’t just pick and choose who I sleep with, you know! You think if I had any choice I would be here? I have nothing, I had to run away, I’m not qualified for any Muggle job, this is the only way for me to have a roof over my head! – Draco couldn’t help it. It was the first time he was able to tell another living soul what happened to him. The tears started flowing and he didn’t even make an effort to stop them. – Do you have any idea how it is to be… THIS?! I’ve fallen further than you can even imagine! I would rather be in fucking Azkaban right now!
‘I am ashamed, yes. But I love him.’ Draco didn’t even know where it came from. But now it was out there and he was horrified – not because the other two knew, but because Harry knew, and Draco’s heart was now completely at his mercy.
‘I’ll try to order it to open in parseltongue and we’ll see what happens, right?’ He looked at Draco to find confirmation. ‘Ron, Neville, if
‘Me and who? Me and Harry?’ She was getting clearly irritated. ‘That’s ancient history. And I was against this, but I talked to Ron and he opened my eyes to some things. I don’t care who’s with whom, as long as they’re happy. Oh, anyway, guys, I believe I never properly congratulated you both! I’m really happy for you!’ She hugged Harry and after a brief moment of hesitation, flung her arms around Draco’s neck. ‘What are you doing here anyway? I heard through the grapevine you’ve fallen off of the face of the Earth!’
‘You don’t ask questions here, Potter.’ Malfoy was now towering over Harry. ‘I repeat: where have you been?’
- You need to be welcoming. Like nothing matters in the world besides their good time. You can set boundaries, refuse to do certain things if you’re not comfortable, but that limits your client scope, so you have to make the decision for yourself.
‘But you’re still hurt, you’re on a lot of potions, we don’t know if you’ll have enough blood left!’
- I couldn’t. It’s impenetrable. It won’t open, it doesn’t make any sound when you knock and if you try and yell through, everything you say bounces back and hits you in the face. It hurts, you know?
It didn’t take long for Ron to bring him the first piece of news. It was Wednesday evening when he Floo’d over to Harry’s living room.
‘I can’t tell you. Just trust me on this, I know what I’m doing.’ Draco breathed again – so Potter wasn’t going to sell him out. Somewhere in the back of his brain there was a voice reminding him it was the
- I… - Harry’s mind was swirling. He would be lying if he said the thought of Draco touching him didn’t occur to him, rising some very pleasant feelings, but he wasn’t sure what to expect. Nevertheless, he went into this relationship trusting Draco, so he decided to go for it. – I do.
‘God, Potter, what is this? I’m gay, I’m not a woman!’ Draco scowled. ‘Just so you know, I take my coffee black, with an unhealthy amount of sugar.’
- Well, ok, fine. Thank you, Draco. – “Draco”? What just happened? Harry had no idea what or why happened in his own brain that caused him to use Malfoy’s first name.
‘What does the house have to do with anything?’ Draco was starting to panic, it looked like Lucius was much more wary than he expected.
- MY room. The fact that you’re there is just very poor judgement on McGonagall’s part. You should’ve never been allowed back after all you did, after all you and your cohorts caused. You should be in Azkaban and we both know it! – that last part came out way louder than Harry intended it to.
Draco knew he couldn’t slip completely into his dominant self just yet, Harry wasn’t ready. But the thought of wrapping his lips around his boyfriend’s erection and looking at him writhing around begging for it was too much for him to fight it. He’d been starved for months now, all he had to go off of was his fantasies of Harry cumming down his throat that he only let himself let in the shower, he couldn’t resist any longer. He pulled Harry’s pants down. Good God, that cock was big. One of the biggest ones he had in his life. He briefly wondered what would feel better – having Harry inside of him or the other way around. He smiled to himself – he was quite lucky he liked being the bottom as much as the top. It let him experiment with all different kinds of partners. He ran his tongue along the Gryffindor’s erection before flicking it across the head. Harry groaned.
- You did. But whatever, what do you even want? I have no time for degenerates, so say what you have to say and go.
‘What do you have? Give me something, anything, there needs to be a link somewhere in there!’ Harry said desperately, handing Draco a mug of cappuccino.
Malfoy has been dead for over a year now and – regardless of the efforts both Ron and Hermione put into yanking Harry out of a trance-like state he’s been in ever since reading the letter from Draco – Harry was still absent-minded most days, like the mourning he’s been going through coated him with a thick, greasy layer of tar, rendering him completely separated from the outside world and irresponsive to anything around him. In fact, the biggest display of still being alive they’ve got from him came on the anniversary of Malfoy’s death (or what Ron considered as such, since they didn’t really have any sort of indication when it exactly happened), when all three of them were sitting in the kitchen of Ron and Hermione’s house on the outskirts of Oxford.
‘Mostly. They usually don’t live with the family like a house elf does, they come in let’s say once a week, or whatever you agree upon, they clean, you pay them for it and they leave.’
That same night, Draco was sitting on the floor between Nott’s and Zabini’s beds. Zabini was spending the night in the Hospital Wing having a broken arm mended after Neville’s mis-cast spell tipped over a cabinet in Charms class and it landed on Zabini.
‘As far as I’m concerned, Malfoy should be a witness, not a suspect. This whole thing was Ron’s idea, he’s the one that’s hellbent on sending him to Azkaban for whatever reason.’ Harry felt his whole blood drain from his body. He should’ve never said this, he knew it the moment he saw Ron’s expression, but it was too late.
- Oh, so you’ve looked enough to determine that? – The Slytherins were cackling, Hermione looked like she was about to burst out crying and Ron was reaching for his wand.
he muttered to himself, but it was no use. Now that this voice got there, there was no running away from it.
They were sitting in the office, filling out miles of forms on past cases (Harry at some point began wondering if it was even possible that all they’ve been doing ever since he came back to work and Draco started there, had been a coincidence and not some ploy orchestrated by Chief), when Kingsley barged into the room, Ron and Neville behind him.
- The armadillo bile. If you dump it inside right now it’ll react with the murtlap tentacles and it’ll blow the whole classroom up. I swear, you’re either somewhere else right now or you spend way to much time with Finnigan and picked up some of his love for pyrotechnics…
‘So you don’t know? Interesting indeed… Weird coincidence, don’t you think? The first night in five years you’re not here and your best friend finds Longbottom dead on your carpet…’
‘Good to know.’ Draco nodded, somehow solemnly. ‘I can’t imagine anyone else living here. It’s stupid, I would never want to live here myself, not after all that happened, but it’s been the family’s since the beginning, so it’s just, I don’t know,
Harry walked into the living room. He desperately needed a cigarette right now. Of course, Malfoy wasn’t sleeping either.
‘You know, Draco, actually it sounds like a wonderful learning opportunity!’ Narcissa exclaimed excitedly.
Draco spent the next hour sweeping and scrubbing any surface he could get his hands on. He briefly thought of just using a cleaning spell, but it seemed too risky with the Muggle baker just outside the door. He was just finishing wiping down the last shelf (weird how tormenting Filch back at Hogwarts turned out, he thought – if he didn’t spend so much time hovering over the caretaker’s head while he was working, he would’ve never figured out how to use all the supplies he’d been given) when the owner of the store appeared, accompanied by a short, thin girl, roughly around Draco’s age.
- I think so. Now, if you’ll excuse me I’m sorry, but I have to start getting ready for work. Don’t rush into things just yet, Draco, think it over before you start acting, ok?
‘Infinitely worth saving.’ Harry laughed and Draco felt some weird warmth pooling at the bottom of his stomach.
He was walking through the grounds alone, thoughts swirling in his head. His discussion with Ron and Hermione only proved one thing – he was right that Ron wouldn’t understand. Hermione seemed supportive, but it was hardly any consolation. Halfway through the grounds he realised something surprising – all his heated hatred and disgust at Ron’s comments didn’t stem from feeling betrayed, like it would make sense, but from the fact that Harry couldn’t understand how could Ron be so blindly against Draco. The accusations he so freely threw and the Slytherin were what made Harry so livid. Couldn’t Ron see that Draco was a different person now? That he had changed? That he had dropped all of his previous self-absorbance and aristocratic tendencies and  was actually revealing his true self? And that that other side of Draco was actually a good person that was forced into a bad situation he didn’t see any way out of? Harry stopped dead in his tracks. The comprehension hit him over the head like one of the branches on the Whomping Willow. He really was falling for Draco. It wasn’t just that he needed someone to be there for him and Draco was conveniently there. He somehow, subconsciously sought him out and that was why all of his bottled up feelings from the last couple of months came pouring out last night. It wasn’t because he nearly died and he needed to vent to someone. It was because it was Draco. And Harry loved him.
‘And maim my face? No thank you.’ Now that the brief moment of dread has passed, Draco could focus on trying to sound as irritated as possible.
Life was beautiful again. The wound on Draco’s back started healing and was getting better each day and every night he was falling asleep holding the love of his life. It would be an idyll if it wasn’t for one last tinge of fear inside him – he and Harry still haven’t discussed approaching sex again. Draco knew it was better to wait for Harry to start the conversation, but he was afraid if they waited months again it would end just like last time. He was becoming much better at controlling his emotions, mainly due to a couple of handy tricks Granger taught him (it was bizarre at first to all of a sudden be friends with Granger and Weasley, but it turned out to be quite fun to hang around with, even if they didn’t appreciate his Slytherin sense of humour), but so far he has only tested them on anger, especially when the rest of the ex-Gryffindors were particularly nasty towards him and Harry (apparently, the spirit of unity didn’t reach the whole house), so he didn’t know how well they would hold up against lust. He tried to push his worries out of his mind, but it was slowly starting to bother him more and more. He was almost ready to give up and broach the subject himself, when one night, during a particularly heated make out session, he felt his boyfriend’s hands tugging at his pants.
Harry stood up, ignoring Malfoy’s violent protests at the notion of being sent to Azkaban, and sent his Patronus to the Minister for Magic, requesting an immediate meeting. All three men spend the next 30 minutes in complete silence, until a knock on the door signified Minister’s arrival. Harry opened the door and led Kingsley inside. As he settled into Harry’s chair, Ron relayed the whole story of how Draco Malfoy ended up in the middle of London after a year of being presumed to be dead. When he finished, Shacklebolt stared at all three of them in silence for a while, lost in thought.
- You mean that sub thing again? – Harry looked like all the things in his head were at last starting to make sense.
- Talking to Ron. I wanted to ask him to keep this whole sub thing to himself since nobody knows about it.
Harry knew better than to argue any longer. There was no changing McGonagall’s mind, so he just nodded and left her office. On the way back to the common room he passed by a group of 3
‘Oh, yes, I heard, Ron mentioned something about you two…’ There was a brief shadow on her face. ‘So you two are really serious?’
‘Minister, distinguished judges…’ She began, and Harry had a sudden premonition that he was not going to like it. ‘On the basis of what we’ve all just been told, I move to question Mr. Potter as a witness in this case before we move on to Mr. Malfoy.’ There was complete silence. Ron looked shocked – not even he was expecting this.
‘I tried to kill myself a few months ago.’ It didn’t matter to Draco that they knew. Harry still hasn’t said anything about his love confession and that was making him afraid.
‘When I was there last time, Harry has recruited Malfoy to help him with the case. They seemed to be, I don’t know, friendly? And now he’s pissed at me for having to live with him, and from what I can tell he’s equally pissed at Malfoy…’
‘So, you take this en-something-or-other in school and you’re qualified to make a giant metal contraption and send it to the skies wit people inside? Are all Muggles suicidal?’
‘By the way, an owl came while you were in the shower.’ He heard Potter say. ‘The office sent those reports we requested.’
- I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but Normani went back home for Christmas already… - Jeanelle was sincerely sorry, it was all over her face. – But if you’d like, we have a new girl here, you haven’t met her yet. Her name is Yasmine and she just started here around two months ago. She’s very different to Normani, but I think you’ll like her. All her clients speak very highly of her.
Harry laughed. ‘It’s just like Hogwarts Express, Draco, there’s one at the back of the carriage. You’ll manage on your own or do I need to come with you?’
