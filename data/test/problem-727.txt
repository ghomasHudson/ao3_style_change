Harry couldn't help the grin which spread across his face as he looked over them. They were worried, of course. Maybe they were even a bit scared; that wouldn't be unreasonable. They were every bit as out of their depth as Harry felt, but they were sticking by him.
A few steps in front of them stood a taller figure, still all in black but with no need of a mask. At a distance it was impossible to make out his face, but there was no doubt in his mind that it was Voldemort. Despite the fact that the remnants of the shield charms erected by its defenders were drifting down all around like glowing embers, they stayed where they were. When Harry glanced up he realised it was not only embers which filled the sky, but hundreds of Dementors. He shivered.
Seamus gave Harry a suspicious look. "If you could get her to fuck off just by asking, why'd you never try that before?"
Harry tried to find some suitable response to that, but wordless horror held his tongue. There were five more of the things to hunt down? He also still didn't understand what Snape had to do with it all. Did it have something to do with the Prophecy?
"Have you seen Dad?" Harry asked him. Maybe it wasn't the most polite thing to ask, but Remus wasn't insulted.
"There is an item. A product of foul, despicable magics, which, once created, will allow a wizard to cheat death, for a time at least," Dumbledore began. "This item is called a Horcrux, and Lucius discovered some time ago that Voldemort had created at least one of the abominable things."
Seeing them both fall, Harry cast a blasting curse of his own and miraculously, this one did find its mark. Perhaps it was the fact that Voldemort and Peter were both every bit as surprised as Harry by Dumbledore's sudden, ignominious end, but neither reacted in time to stop the spell before it collided with Peter in his position on the floor.
"I don't know, okay?" Harry shouted back. He looked around, willing his memory to supply anything of use that might identify the door through which he had originally entered.
It was not the kind of clothes most people would wear for wandering Hogwarts corridors at night, but then this was Albus Dumbledore. Everyone knew he was a little bit gone in the head.
"Good luck, Harry," Ron called as Harry followed Effie out of the room. While it didn't really help the sense of impending doom, the effort was appreciated.
Crossing his arms, Harry said, "Yeah, well, I still got her good with that Buzzing Boils Hex last year."
They'd be needed if the school's protections were to have any chance of holding up, Harry realised. "Okay," he said, trying to put everything else to the back of his mind. "What do we do?"
As for the rest of his friends, well. If his mission, and he was definitely thinking of it as a mission, with Dumbledore was successful, he figured he was pretty much off the hook. If he removed the Prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, there was pretty much zero chance that Voldemort would learn about it. Harry would be scot-free.
Glaring down the stairs towards the front door, she rubbed her forehead. "It's the Dark Lord," she said with a cold certainty that chilled Harry.
Harry wanted to ask just how you could prepare yourself for stepping into a war with someone like Voldemort, but knew it was a stupid question. You couldn't prepare for something like that. Not in a million years, and certainly not in a few months. Besides, it wasn't like Dumbledore had told them either.
"Here, Harry! You done for the night at last?" Seamus called as Harry entered the Gryffindor common room. The Easter holidays still weren't over, so it was maybe a little quieter than usual, which meant that Seamus, Ron, and Neville had managed to grab all of the most comfortable seats by the fireplace.
Despite living with her for more than fifteen years, he still had very little insight into how her brain actually worked. He'd once asked his friend Ron if he had any real understanding of how his own sister's mind worked and had been gratified to learn that he didn't either.
The answer had been "girls are mental" and the truth of that statement had only become more clear over time.
There were hundreds, even thousands of them, but he couldn't stop to inspect every one. He heard a shout, and a cry of pain coming from further in, and started to run, as quickly and as quietly as he could manage, in the direction of the sound.
Soon, both their robes were hitched high upon their chests, and he cupped the swell of breasts while she raked her fingers over the bare skin of his chest. Their legs suddenly weak, they slipped slowly to the floor, and they both broke apart long enough to gasp at the feel of cold stones against their skin.
"Very well, then I shall attempt to keep this brief." The Headmaster steepled his hands in front of him. "I believe you and I will need to take a short trip in the coming days. I told you of the Prophecy, and the importance of keeping it from Voldemort, of course. What I did not tell you is that there is one place where it may yet be heard. I thought it safe, but I have recently discovered that agents interested in returning him to life have been taking more of an interest in the place where it is being kept."
Harry stood up, a little shakily, but he quickly found his balance returning. He reached down to help Iana up and if anything she was even more shaky on her feet than he. She didn't manage to stay upright more than a second before she stumbled into him as one of her legs refused to cooperate with the other.
"I should go," Iana said, though her reluctance was clear to see. She looked around at the others in the room they'd managed to gather in, away from the mad bustle of celebration. All of Harry's family was there, including Sirius and Remus. Even Effie, who had disappeared for a while after the fight, had reappeared, looking suspiciously tousled. "You should catch up with your family."
As quickly as they could manage, both Harry and Iana packed up what few things they had brought with them, and scurried towards the door.
Harry could hear the shame in his words. The same that lingered just on the edges of his sharp retorts and his vulnerable glances.
And then he lifted his hand, slowly - unnecessarily - licking the non-existent crumbs from his fingers with his eyes still on Harry’s.
that had been lighting the way, his silver stag bursting forth and chasing the dementor out of sight.
“That was an unexpected interruption,” Luna remarked - to Draco's glare - before she cleared her throat and rolled the die that was still clutched in her hand.
“Well...um...full of surprises, I suppose,” Harry eventually said, settling on vague, and he couldn’t help but lift his gaze from the parchment he was folding to where he knew Draco was standing, finding those grey eyes upon him, with that frustratingly unreadable
She slipped away, fading slowly before him until she vanished from the spot where she lay, completely, leaving nothing behind.
After almost a full week of being given the not-quite-cold shoulder, Draco was willing to try anything.
“Hm,” Malfoy said, thoughtfully. “So would the team sponsors. It’d almost make putting up with you worth it.”
“It’s what?” Draco asked, in a tone that was clearly meant to sound nonchalant but was anything but.
Harry heard a groan and felt Draco's fingers tighten in his hair, as Harry's lips moved lower and lower still, teasingly, until he finally mouthed at the fabric that stretched over the bulge in Draco’s trousers, breathing in a heady scent of arousal that went straight to his cock.
“Very convincing,” Harry remarked quietly as he mock-marvelled at Malfoy’s performance. Malfoy leaned down behind where Harry was sitting, speaking close to his ear in that way that almost made Harry shiver and catch his breath.
Regulus stopped, his back to him, lingering there a few seconds before he looked over his shoulder at him, with that wry smile that looked so much like Sirius’. “Hm.”
He doubted he was imagining that Draco was talking about more than just this game he’d bloody well tricked him into getting sucked into with him.
Harry reddened at the reminder, but raised an eyebrow all the same. “You weren’t exactly soft yourself, Malfoy.”
“Hm.” Regulus tapped his fingers against his lips in a show of thinking, where he sat opposite Harry at the table. “Embarking on a grand plan to rid the world of the Dark Lord’s horcrux without first considering how one might actually survive oneself. Sounds rather like something a Gryffindor would do, don’t you think?”
To just to touch and taste and explore one another with their mouths, breathing Draco in with each stolen breath between kisses, but his fingers had a mind of their own, hands slipping down from Draco’s cheeks to his neck and then lower, feeling skin - reminding him that Draco’s shirt was still parted - and Harry was gripped with a longing, then, that stirred need in every nerve from his fingertips to his toes.
“This way,” Regulus said after a quick look, handing the map back over before turning and heading further into the forest.
fit. The apparent shyness only amplified that, tenfold. In fact, Malfoy was exactly the sort of man that would draw Harry’s attention in the muggle clubs and bars he’d been joking about. Exactly the sort of person Harry would normally avoid the press to attempt a date, which felt a tad ironic.
“Oh. Um...they’re still a bit damp, actually,” Harry said, as he buttoned up his torn shirt. “But -”
He noticed Harry looking and mustered up a smile, giving him a nod - “Pleasure to meet you, Harry” - before he turned and made his way back in the direction they’d come.
“Maybe we ought to have taken our chances with the Hinkypunk,” Harry joked, eyeing the bridge in front of them.
Harry glanced up at Draco, who stood over him where he sat in the grass with a look of more obvious concern now that they were alone - Luna having taken cover in the bushes while their shirts and trousers and skirts were laid out in the grass to dry - and he tried as hard as he could not to stare or even notice that Draco - and he - were there together in only their boxers.
His gaze was warm and uncertain, hopeful and cautious, all at once, and Harry felt a familiar, not-unwelcome flutter at the look he gave him.
They rolled out of bed five minutes before their first classes and frequently skipped out on meal times and feasts.
Harry drew back the rolled up fabric he’d torn from the bottom of his shirt from where it had been pressed to his head, peering at it, though it was so soaked through that it was impossible to tell if the bleeding had stopped.
And, before he could make sense of what was happening, Harry felt that pull in his stomach, against his will, and he fought it but, within a second, he was twisting and lurching, almost painfully, as he was sucked from the room with a gasp.
Despite it now being April - seven months into the first school year since the war - he and Draco were actually the first and only Eighth Years to wind up in detention.
They carried on like that for what could have been minutes or could have stretched hours, Draco's fingers and lips all over him and making his heartbeat quicken until sweat glistened on their foreheads and on their chests, their panting breaths and soft, breathy sighs filling the air around them, as their hands and tongues and hips moved against one another
If he ignored the fact that they'd been unexpectedly locked in when the door had swung closed behind them, the cabin actually seemed more like a holiday home than the creepy dwelling Harry had expected when they’d seen it from their vantage point in the forest.
Luna lifted the die, ready to roll, but before she could a scratching of claws on the floorboards beneath them drew their attention to their feet.
They’d stayed at the bar, sitting more closely than Harry really remembered—the drinks must have loosened them up—and other photographs had managed to catch enough moments of the two of them smiling, laughing and leaning in close enough to one another in the couple of hours that followed that even Harry himself, would have been convinced there was something going on if he hadn’t known better.
Harry started to speak but Luna groaned, making him turn back to her, instead, growing more alarmed by the second at the way her breathing was becoming shallower, almost drifting away.
Harry immediately turned, glancing in the direction of it, past all the creatures that continued to graze and run and lounge in the meadow that they were standing in, at the large body of water in the distance.
He’d thought he wouldn’t care if it was about him and Malfoy—a nothing thing—but...well...he was definitely wrong on that. It was actually even more annoying than ever.
At Regulus, whose amusement danced in his eyes and the quirk of his lips, as he raised an expectant -
The Saviour’s Ideal Match?’—along with write-in columns—‘Write a Letter to Harry’—in papers and magazines, while photographers popped up here, there and everywhere, leading to articles such as last month’s, discussing the suitability of the woman who regularly sold fruit to him at the nearby market of being his new love.
One of relatively few students who had, Hogwarts Eighth Year boasting a grand total of seventeen students.
before a sketched pathway began forming in swirls between them, the map glowing brighter for a second before all upon it faded away, leaving the parchment blank once more.
A smile played on Draco’s lips as he reached the corridor and began making his way in the direction of the doors to the hall, but - before he could reach it - he was suddenly seized by the collar and hauled into the nearest alcove.
Then a sigh and Draco closed the tiny distance between them, Harry suddenly feeling hands in his hair and lips pressed against his, the breath he’d held stolen from him by the surprise of it.
“Of course he was,” he said, so softly Harry almost missed it, before Regulus turned to him. “You were there?”
Harry leaned in further and Draco did, too, closing any remaining distance between them, and urged Harry onto his back slowly with deep, searing kisses followed by nips of teeth against his neck, making Harry heat up, desperate for more;
Grey eyes, silvery in the moonlight, that would brighten just that little bit when Harry stepped towards him and the slight tug of his lips in that almost-smile as they passed a bottle of firewhiskey between them that Draco had snuck from the Common Room stash, the words coming easier and easier each time.
Draco grabbed him by the hair and hauled him up, kissing him roughly, before he yanked his trousers and boxers down over his hips.
A heavy silence fell between them, both lost to thoughts and memories for a while, and when Harry glanced back at the man who’d found them, Regulus’ gaze was on Draco.
ideas because now he was looking at the smooth, delicate flesh of his throat. And then the rise and swallow of his adam’s apple, before moving down to the sharpness of his collarbone.
Harry’s eyes widened, panic setting in quickly, as the water serpent rose high in the air from the lake and then crashed back down, creating a tidal wave that - thankfully - pushed the current in their favour and the three of them hurriedly swam in the direction of the shore with the creature in close pursuit.
Harry smiled, pushing himself upwards with a yawn he couldn’t help, and leaned an arm over the back of the couch to look at him. “Set off your Harry sensors, did I?”
Harry’s treacherous eyes drifted, instead, from the unicorn he could see grazing in the distance to Draco, who walked a couple of feet ahead of them.
Draco’s eyebrows lifted. “Oh. I never would have guessed. What with all that racket you were making.”
Although, really, Harry knew what he was really flustered by was what it meant, rather than what it was.
Harry lifted his eyes skywards. “Is this how you like to woo your conquests, then, Malfoy? Sailing?”
He was only just sneaking a peek like a right perv when there was a zap of light - smaller than the other two they’d experienced - which made a concentrated suck into the coffee table in front of the couches.
Past the roaring and the shaking he thought he saw something else appear in the room - a swirl of blue - but he couldn’t think much of it, because his eyes were drawn to the sight of Draco twisting and vanishing from the room with a ‘pop’, as if in apparition.
Draco tried with evident effort not to match his grin, instead lifting up the sandwich to take a bite and shrugged. “Hm. Far be it for me to disappoint you, Potter.”
Harry shot him a look, bristling, and took the die, rolling it a little harder than necessary and sending it tumbling off the desk.
Harry smiled a bit, having to tilt his chin to look up at him. “Yeah. Yeah, they all seem pretty convinced. Good show in there, by the way. You’re not a bad date.”
Draco’s amusement seemed to die away then and, for a second, Harry thought he caught a glimpse of exasperation. But it was there and then it was gone, as was Draco, who strode from the room without waiting.
They kissed and stroked and got on their knees and used their mouths on one another beneath the lukewarm water, until they both came again, and when they stumbled back out of the bathroom a while later - the shower long-since gone cold - there was another wand lying on the couch.
“I might ask you the same question,” Draco said, eyeing him. “The place is hardly filled with fond memories for you, either.”
“What can you tell me about my cousin?” Regulus said, seeming to notice Harry had come back to himself without looking at him.
and boarded the Hogwarts Express at Kings Cross Station to the stares of those on the platform, amid the frantic camera flashes of the paparazzi.
Malfoy played the role of ‘date’ exceptionally well. Despite being amongst company, there were frequent touches, warm smiles, laughter and eyes only for Harry, so that—should this be a
A criss cross of raised, silver scars across the soft flesh of chest and stomach that he’d given him. He’d been unable to see them, properly, in the moonlight when he’d pushed the robes and the shirt from his shoulders in the Astronomy Tower, trailing his lips and tongue unknowingly across them as he eagerly chased the soft gasps and sighs of his pleasure.
“Maybe we should give them something to talk about, then,” Harry said, before he had really finished thinking it through.
Harry had wondered, each time that he and Draco had come upon one another and spoken - each time getting a little bit closer to this - what he would have done. If Voldemort had taken up residence in the Burrow and threatened to do to Ron and Hermione, to the Weasleys - to anyone he loved, his family - the things he was doing to Draco's family, whether or not Harry would have done something different.
Harry’s gaze went back to Draco, where he was still standing several feet away with the map in his hands, studying it.
“As long as they think I’m involved, they’re not going to be hounding anyone I’m actually interested in.”
Harry raised his eyebrows before he tilted his half-empty pint glass in Malfoy’s direction. “Malfoy.”
“Right,” Regulus said, suddenly appearing beside them. “That’s them gone for the time being, so best get over there while we can.”
“Wha -” Harry grabbed him by the arm, so that he had to stop, and pulled him to face him. “Neither of you said it was going to throw us into some
Luna lifted the lid, turning it over in her hands and reading the inside inscription, before her eyes widened with obvious interest.
” - before being hit by Bellatrix Lestrange’s curse, and the look on his face as he’d slipped through the veil.
“You’ve survived here almost twenty years,” Harry said, not knowing if that was new information to him or not.
She seemed oblivious to the way Draco flinched at her use of his name. “And we aren’t in any rush, are we?”
He felt Draco’s hand slip between them, taking their slick cocks in his hand and working them, slowly at first as he leaned down to kiss him again, deeply, and then Draco drew back, touching his forehead to Harry’s and just looked at him, as his fist moved in swift steady strokes over the both of them.
And then they were in darkness, the only sound their panting breaths for a few moments, until Harry spoke.
“Even if I hadn’t found the game,” Regulus went on, oblivious to the meaning of the glance shared between them, “Kreacher could have gotten me out.”
They heard the door to the cabin slam shut but ignored it, lost in one another until they heard Regulus’ voice on his approach. “Alright, the map has spoken. We’re on our way -”
, making everything within the classroom shake as Harry’s hands flew to cover his ears at the racket.
“Though apparently that isn’t enough to put the guard up of Savior Harry Potter,” Draco went on. “If recent history is any indication.”
The cabin had unlocked once Draco’s wand returned, their magic along with it, but the map remained unchanged, giving them no indication of where to go next.
Draco eyed him, his fingers twitching as if itching for his wand, before he spoke in perhaps the most imperious tone Harry had ever heard from him. “What business is that of yours?”
“I suppose I should be flattered that I was Harry Potter’s ‘Chosen One’ to test out the waters of public dating,” Malfoy said, a smirk playing on his lips as he took a drink. “What do you do with the rest of them? Polyjuice? Exclusive Island Retreats? Stick them under an Invisibility Cloak?”
“It’s the truth,” Harry said, meaning every word. “I wouldn’t have been able to do any of that if it hadn’t been for the people I had around me. Not everyone knows everything, but they
all of the kissing and the touching and Harry could suddenly forget or, rather, just put aside for a minute what they’d done and remind himself that this was Malfoy - Draco - one of the very few people who he’d actually been able to just
Their conversation came to an abrupt halt—though Harry’s giggles carried on, while Malfoy pursed his lips in an obvious attempt to smother a smile—as their table began to fill with others attending the function. The majority were Malfoy’s teammates and their dates, as it happened, and Harry was quietly relieved to have escaped his usual seating arrangements, which typically consisted of Kingsley and Robbards—two he didn’t so much mind—along with other high ranking politicians and Ministry Officials, which tended to make for extremely dull dinner conversations, indeed.
And now he felt ridiculous, but the swell of jealousy came upon him more strongly, as he found himself wondering if Draco
Harry made to follow, only then noticing that Regulus was heading back in the direction they’d come.
That was a bit of a lie, Harry supposed, and Draco smirked, knowing that, as he carried on making what seemed to be a sandwich.
“It was a waste of a life, is what it was,” Draco drawled, eyeing her. “We’re going to be facing a lot worse than rodents, Lovegood.”
In short, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy became the first - and only - Eighth Years to be assigned detention because their previously innocent rendezvous in the Astronomy Tower in the middle of the night - rendezvous that had fast been becoming frequent - had turned not-so-innocent five nights previously.
Draco set off, heading in the direction of the lake, with a look on his face determined that he was somehow able to navigate this strange place they’d ended up in.
“It was very obvious, Harry,” Luna said, nodding. “Especially this week, even if you have been trying to avoid one another -” her eyes perked up at something in the distance. “Oh. Excuse me for a minute, Harry.”
Malfoy, however, didn’t seem inclined to forget it. Instead, he gazed at Harry long enough and thoughtfully enough that Harry felt a flush begin to spread up his neck under the scrutiny, and Malfoy smiled, obviously pleased with himself, when he noticed it. He cast the briefest of glances in the direction of the windows before his smile turned mischievous.
“Oh, not you—” Malfoy nodded at the door “—your posse of highly trained security personnel, of course.”
Eyes betraying him again, he saw Draco wave off Zabini’s attempt to drag him along, leaving just a handful of Eighth Years behind, and only them two at this side of the room.
Draco released a huff of laughter, but his eyes were dark with want as he gazed down at him. “Someone might come down.”
’,” Draco grumbled, sitting sideways on the other side of the couch, his knees drawn up while he looked at Harry where he was sitting, as completely at a loss as Draco was as to what they should be doing to find their own.
“I suppose I wasn’t,” Draco humoured him, a smile playing on his lips, before he went back to making his sandwich, adding as if an afterthought. “We should do it again, sometime.”
This look now, though, was something new and while Harry had no idea what, exactly, Draco meant by it, he
Draco’s eyes met his then and there was both amusement and heat in his gaze at another of Harry’s foot-in-mouth statements.
Malfoy didn’t notice Harry at first—unsurprisingly, considering he’d chosen the most secluded area of the pub, at the bar up by the wall—and ordered a drink before turning to lean back against the wooden countertop, still smirking away at his ‘public’ and Harry openly scoffed into his drink before he could help himself.
- soft lips parting immediately before a sweep of tongue against the bottom of Harry’s lip made him hum with approval, little sparks of heat and anticipation running all up and down his skin.
His patronus illuminated the cave as it swept away and he could see others - dozens of them - dementors descending and rising from above and below, so many that Harry was instantly thrown back to the war.
Footsteps on the stairs followed the words, an indication that the conversation was over and one of them had left.
Malfoy paused, and it was only then that Harry looked at him properly. He was nervous, Harry realised. But it was there and then gone. A flash before a self-assuredness seemed to come over him and Harry guessed he could see something in Harry’s look that put him at ease.
Harry thought it might have been less awkward if he had. They’d probably be kissing, now, rather than standing awkwardly on the doorstep for anyone to see. Harry thought they’d likely have ended up in bed, actually.
He put his hands on her wrists, her face, feeling her growing colder and her breaths coming shallow. A raised reddened mark, like a bite, on her hand became darker, swelling with each second, purple lines spreading in a slow, steady crawl up her arm.
“I thought so. But I’m not really surprised,” Luna said, smilingly. “I’ve actually thought there may be something going on for a while.”
“Well,” Regulus said, clapping his hands together and nodding at the darkened woodland. “This’ll be you lot, then.”
Regulus looked at him sharply, his steps slowing to a stop - the rest of them following suit - and a flurry of emotions seemed to pass over the man’s face, before he spoke.
Malfoy seemed to be pulling back, so Harry pushed off the wall, catching Malfoy’s face in his hands and kissing him properly. It heated up rather quickly after that. All he could feel was Malfoy. His warm mouth against Harry’s and his hard muscles beneath Harry’s hands as they roamed—without Harry’s permission, really—and he felt Malfoy’s hands in his hair, pulling him closer, tighter, making his toes curl in his shoes.
Sirius than the godfather that Harry had known - even if he could recognise who he was, immediately - but his eyes were cruel, menacing even, as they stared Regulus down.
Harry’s heart skipped at the sight, knowing exactly how that particular area of flesh felt against his lips, the feel of a quickening pulse and the taste of him.
Malfoy was going to kiss him. Harry’s brain registered it, just in time for him to say quietly; “Malfoy.”
Harry scoffed while Malfoy pulled out the chair at his side and plonked down, before dragging it along the floor with a screech so that they were sitting close enough that their thighs were pressed together.
“I just don’t believe that the way we acted when we were seventeen should dictate how people see us for the rest of our lives,” Harry finally said.
He’d gone to the graves. To his parents in Godric’s Hollow. To Remus and Tonks. He’d stood at the closed door of Sirius’ bedroom, unable to go in. He’d told them all how grateful he was. How
They weren’t going to outright lie, they’d decided. They’d simply treat this as if it really were a date and let the rumour mill run wild with it. That would be more than enough to keep their attention diverted elsewhere.
Harry noticed Regulus’ eyes lingering on Draco’s back as the rest of them followed, Draco several paces ahead and speeding up until he stopped, suddenly, Harry feeling the reason
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but it caught in his throat when he felt Draco’s teeth nip at his earlobe, and he suddenly just wanted this bloody game to be over and done with, already, so he could get him back to the dorms and...well...a repeat of the previous night would be more than welcome.
Eventually, they stepped into a wide open clearing within the cave, with a drop hundreds of feet down, and a less-than-sturdy looking rope bridge that connected where they’d come to a stop to an opening on the wall opposite.
Malfoy stilled but he didn’t move away, their lips a hair breadth away from one another’s. Harry didn’t know why he’d said anything. He didn’t know why he’d stopped him. Suddenly, with his silvery grey eyes looking right at him — somehow warm and bright and teasing, all at once—and his lips so close that Harry could feel each of his breaths against his own, stopping him seemed like one of the silliest things he’d ever done.
There was an immediate stir among the patrons not unlike the one there had been when Harry had entered, whispers and less-than-subtle glances sent his way as Malfoy made his way to the bar, apparently alone, with a nod and a grin at those who were openly staring or smiling at him as he passed.
“Malfoy,” Weasley said at Harry’s side, still a bit stiffly but no longer as hostile as he used to be.
grey eyes flicked down, briefly, letting Harry know that what Draco might not see he could definitely
, Potter. Good grief.” Malfoy rolled his eyes before attaching it to the lapel of Harry’s dress robes, while Harry pointedly didn’t stare at the odd muggle suit that Malfoy was wearing.
There was a brief flash of disorientation which lingered as he took in where they now stood, that gave way to curiosity at whatever he could see in Harry’s eyes and Harry knew that what Draco could see was concern and
Luna just reached out a hand, a dismissal of anything further he had to say on it, and Harry gathered and handed over her clothes so that she could get dressed.
“I think you’re very lovely together, you know,” Luna said, suddenly, reminding Harry that they were sitting side-by-side.
“About the Killing Curse,” Draco’s voice was an echo in the air, surrounding him, the real Draco before him fading away. “No one said you were dead.”
Draco smirked, raising an eyebrow, his eyes warm, now, when they’d been cautious and guarded before. “Well. That was an eventful twenty minutes.”
“You’re the Gryffindor,” Draco pointed out, and Harry rolled his eyes. “Not to mention the fact that you’ve bested dragons before, if I’ve heard it right? I seem to recall a story trickle down the rumour mill about your great escape from Gringotts.”
Draco blanched as he stared back at it and made no move to raise his wand - frozen in the face of it - and both Luna and Harry moved then.
The daze that had come over him upon entering the forest had evaporated now, leaving behind only vivid comprehension of what had just happened, heat under the collar and - most fantastically of all - an extremely uncomfortable tightness in his trousers.
“I’m sure I’ve heard of this before. Dad had letters from his readers - there was a bit of a cult following around it for a while, wasn’t there?”
A brief look at the map and Regulus knew where they were headed, leading them through the trees for a few minutes until he came up short at a point where Harry could feel the magic change, twisting and turning with something hazy, almost sinister.
to. That was all. And Malfoy knew it too, his lips curving into a smile against Harry’s, a little hum of laughter escaping him.
He lit the end of his wand with a silent 'lumos', and stepped back through the opening in the cave wall.
A shout escaped him, a strange far away sound within the water, and then he caught sight of them - grindylow - that were gaining on him, one still holding tight to his ankle.
Or, perhaps, she was just so stunned at the state she’d found them in, up there in the Astronomy Tower on Monday night, that she’d slipped back into what was comfortable -
There was a huff of a scoff that made Harry grin but his amusement was quickly snuffed out a second later at the sound of a thud, drawing his attention to where they had just come from, his eyes finding Luna lying, unconscious, in the grass.
Hannah Abbott had joked one night, during a customary game of truth or dare, that Hogwarts Eighth Year was really just a holdover for everyone that didn’t know what to do with themselves after the war.
His silver stag was joined by another - a hare, Luna’s - that chased away those that approached from below but Harry stumbled as it did, his foot catching in a loose plank and he hit the bridge on his knees, slipping precariously close to the edge of the narrow walkway - stopped from going over only by Draco’s hand grasping tightly at his arm - and then his wand was falling down into the abyss below.
“Hm,” Harry recognised Regulus’ voice. “This place is rather well-suited to the lost and lonely cowards of the world, I’ve found.”
It came back to Harry in a flash, then, his memory mocking his own thoughts - the feel of Draco quivering beneath his touch - and he grinned, in spite of himself, and glanced away.
Draco rolled his eyes and approached where Harry was kneeling at the drawers, making his stomach flip, and leaned against it, plucking up the other half of the sandwich on his plate.
“Potter,” Draco drawled, eyeing the fabric over their heads, before his gaze went to a couple of students that passed them, seeming none-the-wiser to their presence. “I always knew you liked to use this thing to stalk me.”
“Draco, is it?” the man said, addressing Draco, with a look of undisguised interest. “Are you a Black?”
“Luna -” Harry shoved the map at Draco, hurrying up and dropping to his knees in a skid at her side. “Luna!”
“And you have nothing to do with it.” Harry rolled his eyes before looking pointedly at the magazine still lying on the bar.
“Looks like it worked,” Draco said, before he accioed the die without getting up from his stool and rolled a two - for lives - which made the parchment glow once, twice and then fade.
A smile played on Draco’s lips but it lacked the teasing that he’d been throwing Harry’s way earlier. Now, he looked bemused and there was still a hauntedness in his eyes at whatever he’d seen. His bemusement fell away, his eyes dropping but Harry saw the hauntedness within them winning out, taking hold.
He didn't really want to know the answer. He didn't think anyone would want to face the person they'd become when faced with a choice like that. Would you kill or let your loved ones be killed?
He shivered, finding himself cold all of a sudden, just before he flung the door open wider when he reached it and then froze when - out of nowhere - he found himself loomed over by a
Draco, however, was totally unaffected by both what had just happened and by the look Harry was giving him, and he lifted the map, almost lazily, showing the single visible sketch and words to the two of them.
He smelled as good as he looked and Harry tucked his nose just so behind Malfoy’s ear. It’d look far more convincing to onlookers this way, Harry told himself. And then told Malfoy, just to make sure he didn’t get the wrong idea or anything.
He stood, breathing uneven and his hips twitching while the heat dwindled, slightly, chased away by a cool breeze that made him shiver.
It was intoxicating, being surrounded by the scent, the taste of him, and Harry hummed against his cock, drawing an -
He wanted Draco’s mouth back on his cock or his mouth back on Draco’s or their mouths back on one another’s so Harry reached for him, pulling Draco up and kissing him, their lips almost frenzied against one another.
Ron, along with a troop comprising of a mix of students from all four Houses, headed from the Eighth Year Common Room.
rumours had surfaced between the two of them which Harry really couldn’t care less about. It was far less bothersome, actually, having them make all these naff speculations about being in a relationship with Malfoy, than it usually was when he was actually trying to make something work with anyone else, and so—
Until they got just past the middle, when each step felt heavier, an unnatural chilliness setting up the air around them until Harry could see his breaths before him just before the mist descended.
Malfoy’s eyes were darker than Harry had ever seen them, pupils blown, even as he didn’t quite meet Harry’s gaze. He had that shy look about him that Harry realised he liked very much, so much that he very nearly pulled him back in.
Something twisted, dark and sinister within the cave, a magic much the same as it had been in the forest the day before.
It was clean and surprisingly comfortable, warm and lit up inside with an open plan area, two bedrooms, a bathroom and, most pleasingly of all,
Instead, he’d reassured Ron and Hermione that he was just fine and watched as they fell even more deeply and daftly in love. He’d forced a smile and a laugh at dinner with the Weasleys every Sunday and was left exhausted from the effort. He’d shied away from Ginny’s attempts to touch until he’d finally pulled away, completely. And he’d barely been able to meet his Godson’s eyes.
Draco glowered at him, though his lips twitched, and Harry fought a smile of his own as he stepped around behind him.
Invisibility Cloak - and left Draco there under it, his heart beating quickly, his stomach doing that odd little
A screech of a stool scraping across the stone floor made him look up, sharply, just as Draco took a seat upon it on the other side of the desk.
And then Harry felt a warm hand on his shoulder, Malfoy’s thumb making a slow, distracting stroke against the side of his neck. It was horribly unnerving, having Malfoy’s hand on him, and Harry froze, uncertain whether he ought to shrug him off, but before he could do anything Malfoy leaned in close, his lips almost brushing Harry’s ear as he spoke.
The conversation that followed between them was short and awkward. But things had been a bit, ever since they’d split, so that wasn’t much of a surprise. It was, however, just the start of it, as more and more people began asking questions that were just as rude as they had always been, crossing the same boundaries that always bothered Harry before when it had been Ginny he’d been seeing. Or that one date, David, who he had foolishly dared take to a Ministry function a couple of months after he’d come out as bisexual and quickly came to regret.
Harry started to speak, to say something, but he clammed up, knowing whatever he was about to say would be something ridiculous.
Draco didn’t look convinced, his eyes on nothing, with the same hauntedness in them that Harry had seen earlier that day before he'd kissed him. That he’d, sometimes, been able to see in the months since they’d come back to Hogwarts.
Malfoy grinned and it was only then that Harry realised he had failed and was, indeed, staring again at what Malfoy was wearing. But come on, Harry had eyes, and Malfoy was a Quidditch Player so obviously he was really fit and tailored muggle suits did
“So, a few of us are heading down to the pitch,” Ron’s voice made him jump, Harry turning sharply to find him standing behind him, with his broom. “You fancy it?”
Harry sighed at the air of indifference he gave off - tried to - that failed to hide anything now that Harry was paying attention.
Harry frowned, not quite making sense of what he’d said quickly enough, and by the time Harry realised what Malfoy meant, he was already down the path and gone.
Draco rolled his eyes, straightening up once he seemed convinced they weren’t actually going to capsize, before he eyed him where he now stood only inches from his face, quirking an eyebrow. “Unless this is what you intended?”
For a second, Harry could see it all. All of the fear and the unease and the vulnerability that he’d only ever seen a handful of times. At the Manor. At the trial. In the Tower.
His return to school had made headlines in the Prophet, none of which were untrue but none would be truer than a simple:
“Four quests - one of them magic - and two lives,” Draco said, sounding entirely exasperated, drawing Harry’s gaze back to him. “Were you even listening to the rules, Potter?”
Harry was spared from having to respond by a camera flash going off a few feet away, snapping a picture of the two of them together.
Water creatures, as many in the lake as upon the land, scattered both out of his way and into him - lobalugs and murtlaps and plimpies and shrakes - knocking him off course and slowing him down.
Something that sounded like breath and panting and a low growl and he turned, slower than he tried to do so, vaguely hearing Luna’s voice calling out -
Draco had said the first night they’d come across one another in the Astronomy Tower some months before, the words spoken in a familiar drawl, but Harry had caught it. The brief flash of vulnerability beneath the mask of indifference that kept drawing him back.
.” Malfoy laughed. “Oh. You should be so lucky. But we would make quite the handsome couple, don’t you think?”
Harry wondered, in a flash, if Draco knew how to cast a patronus charm but it all happened so quickly that, before any of them could lift their wands to even attempt another, the dementor shuddered and morphed and became a mirror image of Draco himself in torn, filthy Azkaban robes, eyes hollow and breaths coming in visible puffs from his lips. Exactly how he’d looked at the trial.
“Well. You should.” He didn’t meet Harry’s eyes when he went on, the task at hand apparently far too interesting. “Last year I might’ve stayed. I’m trying to do things differently, now.”
the way Draco looked lost in release. Harry’s own cock jerked at the sight before he thrust once, twice, feeling Draco tightened his hold once again at his movements, before Harry shuddered into the tightness of Draco’s fist, feeling himself suddenly awash with waves of pleasure, another groan torn from his throat as he came in spurts between them.
Malfoy took a swig, knocking back the newly received firewhiskey in one go. “I say. You always do cause such a stir, Potter.”
rather than make any helpful contribution to the task that had been assigned to them by Professor McGonagall.
Harry eyed the lake that stretched almost a mile wide, wondering how the hell they were supposed to get across, but before he could say anything, any and all rational thoughts were driven from his mind when Draco started shrugging out of his robes.
And then, suddenly, Sirius was standing there up ahead, shocking Harry into stillness, while Draco ran into him from behind.
Draco’s grin was slow, as his eyes left the water to meet Harry’s once more, and Harry realised he’d well and truly stuck his foot in it with that one.
His stag appeared, bursting forth, and then the dementor that held him let him go, chased off into the darkness with the others nearby, dispersed by the silvery light as Harry fell backwards, missing the bridge, and he heard Draco calling his name again as he was falling, falling, falling…
he was. And then he’d closed his eyes at night in Grimmauld Place and seen their faces and all the others - the ghosts of those who’d been left behind - and the numbness had faded away for a bit and he’d been overcome with what he wasn't sure was guilt or grief, only knowing that he could hardly breathe for it.
He was not standing here in the middle of this creepy, haunted forest, pitching a tent in his trousers over Draco -
Harry approached them, doubting that Draco had any interest in playing, now, even if he was doing a pretty good job of mustering up his usual mask of indifference.
Harry met Draco’s gaze, evenly, a silence coming over them in the wake of his words. Words that tread that little bit closer to the conversations they'd had in the Tower,
But then Harry had a thought as he glanced at the windows, where reporters and photographers could still be seen milling about, waiting to catch something gossip-worthy for their newspapers, their eyes pointedly on the two of them where they sat. Harry was struck by the realisation that, with the exception of the occasional polite passing by of one another at Quidditch Games and on the street, this was the first time he and Malfoy had actually associated publicly in...well...ever. And it just so happened to be the same week those
A shudder and a morph and it was a dementor once more before Luna’s patronus formed and chased it back into the cupboard.
Before returning to Hogwarts, he’d simply coasted by from May until September, adrift with the war behind him, suddenly purposeless while simultaneously being told it was a time to celebrate,
“There’ll be worse than that, I’m sure,” Regulus said, lightly, before he carried on as if nothing had happened.
But he carried on first, stepping onto the narrow slats of wood, the bridge wobbling, immediately, with the weight of him. Someone followed, the bridge narrow so they had to move along in single file, and he could smell the scent of citrus that told him it was Draco.
“I might have done,” Draco said, smirking. “If you didn’t bolt every time you thought we were going to be alone.”
They lay on the couch, catching their breath, in a boneless heap, for a few minutes afterwards - and Harry loved it, the weight of Draco above him - until he felt the soft press of a kiss to his shoulder that gave him flurries of warmth in his stomach before Draco rolled off him and to the side, pressing his back against the cushions of the couch to look at him again.
all along; a sparking of warmth and heat and want when their lips met, just as it had every other time, a flutter of delight in his tummy that Harry hoped would never fade.
She shoved the Prophet onto the table in front of them, and Draco could see the headline as well at the same time that Harry did.
The cabin was filled with Luna’s soft, dreamy voice, as she carried on imparting various facts about the species they’d encountered so far -
The ongoing roar that had sounded in the classroom slowly died out, as he raised his hand, shielding his eyes and squinting in the harsh sunlight, making out the trees and the grass and the breeze that stirred them.
It wasn’t the first time Harry had seen Malfoy play since he’d been recruited by the Appleby Arrows, so really, he shouldn’t still be getting that little jolt of disbelief at how sodding
“Very gracious of you, Malfoy,” Harry smirked, as one of the dragons soared up once more, becoming visible further away on the horizon.
“Oh no,” Malfoy said, waving a dismissive hand as he turned on the stool to face him. “This is far too appealing an offer to let slip. While I'm quite aware of what’s in it for me and the Arrows...what do
Harry opened his mouth. To protest, he’d thought, but found himself saying; “Firewhiskey. Double, thanks.”
why Harry had come back to Hogwarts and he’d craved to be seen as he had been before, so who was he to complain.
There was a moment where grey eyes stared into green with such intensity that Harry held his breath.
Harry frowned at the words, eyes going to Draco where he now stood some feet away, glowering at the map he had plucked up from the ground with such frostiness it was a wonder it hadn’t turned to ice in his hands.
Almost all of the Slytherins had returned to Hogwarts. Exempt, apparently, from the Ministry promises of greener pastures and gratitude for those who had fought on the right side of the war.
Harry made a noise of half-hearted agreement just as Malfoy made a slow fly past the stand they were standing in, where he noticed Harry among the crowd.
Draco’s eyes caught his in the brief flash of light and Harry saw relief and gratitude and fright and something else, something soft, and then, after the the darkness that descended with the disappearance of the hare that chased the dementors away, a silver fox joined the fray, the three patronus chasing off the remaining dementors as they hurried up the rest of the bridge and through the opening in the wall at the otherside.
There were others who deserved it more, he was sure of it. Others who deserved the choice to come back. Come back to their loved ones, to their wives and their husbands, their brothers and their sisters, their children.
Draco tugged on the hem of Harry’s shirt, pulling it up over his head, so they could press skin to skin and Harry was almost blown away by it. How smooth and hard and warm and perfect he felt against him.
Everything had changed in just a few minutes - though it had certainly felt much longer to them - spent in a boardgame that Draco may or may not have willingly tricked Harry into getting caught up in with him.
He crashed, headfirst into the bank, and hauled himself up, vaguely registering Draco climbing out just behind him and Luna up ahead -
Draco eyed him, looking off-balance at the gesture, and Harry could have laughed at the absurdity at it. At the fact they’d touched and kissed and made one another very nearly beg just a few nights ago, and yet Draco was flustered by something as simple as hand-holding.
Draco reached up, tugging at the top of his robes, loosening them and then flicked at the top button of his shirt underneath, making it spring open and exposing a stretch of milky skin at his throat that glistened with sweat from the heat.
Draco’s eyebrow lifted briefly in obvious surprise and Harry found himself fighting a matching grin just as the raft suddenly shuddered, making him lose his footing, before it overturned in a
“My mistake,” Malfoy said, smoothly. “I forget we lowly mortals are not quite up to Chosen One standards—”
“So it is,” Draco humoured him, eyes back on the lake. “People pay good money to sail around aimlessly in places like this. Who said romance is dead.”
“Hm, interesting -” Regulus said, looking at the wand with something close to longing, before he cleared his throat and tossed the book he’d been reading onto the table in front of the couch, getting to his feet. “Seems that note of yours wasn’t quite referring to within this cabin. Enjoy the soul searching, boys. I’m off to bed.”
When Harry didn’t say anything, Draco crossed his arms, and his jaw twitched in a clench before he went on, eyes guarded.
There was bewilderment in the room as she studied it, at what had happened in the meantime to have evoked the return of a wand.
Both leapt to their feet seeing it approach, wands drawn, but the dementor came to a sudden halt when it reached Draco.
The brief surprise on Draco’s face turned to alarm at the sound of leaves and undergrowth being disturbed as his eyes shot over Harry’s shoulder and Harry - immediately sensing that something was behind him - turned, and he found himself looking at a stranger; a man dressed in plain tatty clothing, with black, wavy hair and familiar grey eyes.
Harry glanced over his shoulder, at the closed door of the bathroom that told him Regulus was still basking in the glory of hot running water, and got to his feet heading in Draco’s direction.
It was so slight that, in the past, Harry might not have noticed it. He did now, though. The way Draco’s eyes softened, ever so slightly, at the statement before he lifted his chin in turn - the only acknowledgement he made otherwise to what Harry had said.
“Why on Earth would I want to leave this beautiful place and go back to a world torn apart by war, hm? Particularly considering my family have, apparently, been entirely wiped out in the aftermath.”
Harry grinned as Draco tugged him to his feet, kissing him, thoroughly, before shoving him in the direction of the bathroom, following hot on his heels.
Harry drew in a breath, eyes going to his hands in his lap, and when he didn’t go on Draco looked at him, and there was both guarded curiosity and distrust and a tiny bit of something that looked like hope when he did.
"I bloody wish," Harry muttered more to himself than Dean. Despite his frustration, he was still reluctant to bring the happy ignorance of his friends an end. Worried though they might be at the thought of Death Eaters running amok, that was nothing compared to what they'd feel if they knew it was Voldemort leading them. "Look, you just go. I'll try to make more time for you, yeah?"
They all fell towards the floor, and Harry didn't have time to do anything more than realise what had happened. He prepared himself for what would surely be a bone-rattling landing, but it never came. Instead, the floor flexed comfortably, before springing back. A cushioning charm.
"When I told him to depart, to return to my mother's coat-tails, he snapped, and he stabbed me in the heart."
"You," she repeated. "Before I came to know you, I never would have imagined giving my life for anyone. Not the way my mother did. Now, I understand— I do. You helped me understand." She fixed him with an intense look. "I'm not sure. I'm not exactly good with this kind of thing. But I think I love you. I think that's what the prophecy meant.
"Ah, the impatience of youth," he said. "No doubt you are thinking fondly of your bed after a long evening of detention."
The full ramifications struck Harry like a lightning bolt. "You mean with Malfoy dead, Voldemort basically controls the whole Ministry already?"
Once she was gone, Harry walked as slowly as he could manage towards the lounge. He paused outside the door, but his plan to delay just a little more was thwarted when Professor Dumbledore's voice rang out from within.
"Do you think you are above the petty concerns of werewolf attacks, perhaps?" she asked, leaning forward in her chair. "Strange. Your family lives in Godric's Hollow, do they not? One of those beasts had to be driven out just this summer."
He could well remember what Voldemort looked like from Halloween. Tall and almost skeletally thin, his skin was as pale as bone, and his face was more like that of a snake than a man. There wasn't even the slightest glimpse of humanity in his baleful red eyes. The thought of him
"The answer to the question I asked, is many indeed," said the ghost, seemingly opting to ignore Harry's question. "How many of those do you imagine I told?"
"I have a secret of my own," he admitted to her. He had no idea if what he was about to do was the right thing, but she'd confided in him. It was the least he could do to return the favour. "The prophecy with my name on it that you saw destroyed? I already knew what was in it." He paused. "At least, I think I did." Suddenly he wasn't so sure. How many prophecies were there? That Hall had been filled with thousands of the things.
"Is that the thing that Granger is always quoting whenever she has the chance?" Ron's expression looked dubious at best. "Why not just ask her instead?"
"Maybe," said Harry with a shrug before returning to his book. He started counting to himself, and only reached four before he was subject to an annoyed huff from the other side of the table.
"Well, I've been reading over Hogwarts: A History," said Harry eventually. That drew a groan from the others.
The Fiendfyre didn't even seem to notice, and through the fire and smoke Harry could see the Diadem blackening and charring in the face of the heat. The black smoke, which surely must have been the Horcrux itself, ate into the fire, but it was utterly single minded in its attention.
"I lied about what happened when Voldemort… killed me," said Iana eventually. Her words were hesitant, as if she was having to dredge them up individually from some deep, dark place.
It almost caused Harry to miss what Dumbledore had said. When his thoughts caught up with his ears, however, his head snapped up. "Concerning?" he said incredulously. As in more concerning than everything else going on?
"No, no!" Harry tried to reinforce his innocence by raising his hands. He realised he'd let his voice rise above a whisper and lowered it again. "I just thought that if anyone knew what was going on, it'd be you, right?"
He glared at all three of them, but when his mother could no longer restrain her laughter he couldn't help but join in.
The weariness settled heavy over Dumbledore's face again, burying a moment of something else. Had that been pain? He shifted his gloved hand down behind the desk. "I will do everything in my power to destroy the Horcruxes that remain, if we are able to deduce their form and location, but the fact remains that I may not be successful. Should I prove unable to dispatch them, it will fall to you, and whatever allies you might gather for the purpose."
As he returned to his book, Harry started to wonder just how he was going to break the news to his friends. In a way talking to Iana about it might actually have been easier, at least she'd be coming into the discussion with some inkling of what Harry would have to deal with. He tried to envisage how his friends would deal with it, but came up pretty much completely blank.
"Seriously, Seamus, you had 'Lovegood' to work with and that's all you managed?" said Harry, shaking his head in disappointment.
"Here, what's got you two creasing," asked Dean as he entered only seconds before the train began pulling from the station. He looked at Neville and Seamus. "What's gotten into them?"
"Seamus, I say this from the bottom of my heart," said Dean solemnly. "That was actual shit. Why are we friends with you again?"
"Huh?" she said, breaking away from the fleeting scenery beyond the window. She glanced at Harry for a moment, though he was unable to work out what the look was supposed to mean. "I guess I'll be revising too."
That was the signal for Harry and Effie to immediately try to follow their father, but Lily tried to block their way. "No," she told them. "It might not be safe, you should—"
"So much hostility," she said as she shook her head. "Be careful, Weasley. I might get the impression that you dislike me."
Next he found Remus Lupin, who was sitting up in his bed, despite the deep gashes which cut across the entirety of his face. The moment Harry saw him, the first time in months apart from a few Floo calls, he ran to hug him. Remus groaned a little theatrically as Harry squeezed him, but as soon as Harry released him, worried that there was some other injury he'd missed, Remus chuckled. It was a strained sound.
That drew a groan. A proud Gryffindor he might be, like his father before him, but even he knew that there were no real upsides to being the person responsible for waking Effie. He was honestly amazed that she seemed to make it in time for all her classes at Hogwarts considering that it took nothing less than a natural disaster to rouse her when she was at home.
"I'm okay Mum," he said reassuringly, even managing a smile to back his words up. "No major damage. Effie'll be fine too."
"Then let us not delay." Without needing to be called, Fawkes flew over and alighted on Dumbledore's shoulder. "Lucius is also in need of attention. Come, there will be much to discuss."
The next day, Harry checked out a copy of Hogwarts: A History. Pince had eyed him with poorly concealed suspicion, but remained otherwise quiet. As he trailed through the stacks in search of his familiar table, he was sure he could feel her attention on him.
"So, why are you breaking curfew?" said Effie as she plopped herself down on the arm of Neville's seat.
? It seemed so sudden. Did she even really know what love was? But no, that was a stupid question. She'd been willing to give up her life for him without hesitation.
"Until I overheard your conversation, I would have assumed so," said Helena. Something about her came more into focus, as if collecting herself from her recollections made her seem more tangible. "I told only one of the Diadem's location before you. A young man named Tom Riddle."
"I only know some of it," she said. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what was to come, and Harry squeezed her hand as a small offer of support. "But I'll try to explain what I do know."
about it, and just stepped aside." A cruel smile flitted across her features. "Didn't help him. As soon as he lowered his wand, the Dark Lord hit him with some spell. I don't know what it was, but the Dark Lord said it was mercy."
"But that's been lost for centuries at least." It had been the first thing Harry's own search had turned up, but the fact that it had disappeared around the time of Ravenclaw's death meant that it just seemed impossible that Voldemort might have found it.
The shuddering breath he released as he realised what he'd have to do sounded so loud that he was momentarily worried the Death Eaters might hear him. When it was clear they hadn't, he slipped his wand into his hand and took careful aim. It was harder than it might have been. The mere thought of what he was about to do had him trembling, and he couldn't keep the wand straight.
The room beyond the open doorway seemed almost endless. It was filled, beyond the limit of sight, with rank upon rank of tall shelves, every one identical. On each one, hundreds of small white orbs, like a cross between a remembrall and a muggle snow-globe, sat in rows upon dozens of shelves. Harry moved, as quietly as he could manage, over to look at one of them more closely.
"He's broken through the house's protections," he said, probably unnecessarily. He was sure both Iana and Effie had felt the same as him.
Effie didn't look convinced. "That was a pretty nasty thing to say, though. How would you like it if you'd lost both your parents and someone threw it back in your face like that?"
"Iana Malfoy." Seamus leaned back with the attitude of one who believed they had found the one true answer.
"No. We're not… 'you know'. I'm going to lift the silencing charm, but please do feel free to remain quiet. I have a headache."
Anger flared up once more. "Just where do you get off?" he asked as he whirled around. "Not enough that you got your whole family killed, is that it? Want to take a bite out of mine as well?"
"They will be wrapped up in it regardless," said the Headmaster after he returned his attention to Harry. "None of them will be left alone should Voldemort realise his ambitions, surely you understand that? Would it not be better that they be allowed to prepare themselves for what is to come?"
While Effie had been discharged from the Infirmary on the same day as Voldemort's attack, Lily, James and Sirius had all been kept in much longer. Of the three of them, Lily was the least injured, but the spell which had killed Dumbledore had still near liquidised her insides. It was only the quick intervention of Madam Pomfrey and the small team of medical orderlies and medics who were part of the Order that had saved her.
Harry and Effie caught each other's eyes. By common agreement, Iana and the Potters had decided to say nothing at all about her visit over the break. Not only would it have painted a target on the Potters' collective backs, but it was obvious that the only way Iana was going to be able to avoid Voldemort was if he didn't know where to find her.
The rare expression of confusion on Snape's face was answer enough, but he was never able to back it up through words. Before he could say anything, one of the Wizards nearest the door shouted.
Realising that he'd managed to tread on precariously thin ice, Harry retreated back to his side of the desk and behind his book once more. Just as well, too, as Madam Pince chose that moment to poke her nose around the corner of the shelves to look at them both with naked suspicion.
He didn't need to be told twice, or even once. He quickly dropped himself onto the seat, which was indeed very comfortable. It wasn't long before Iana shuffled in closer to him, and they just sat there for a while, both staring at the fire.
That took the wind out of her sails a bit. Her shoulders sagged. "He was meant to be one of Father's allies. The Dark Lord must have gotten to him with an Imperius Curse."
"Alas, it is not," Dumbledore replied as he shook his head. "It is our belief that Voldemort opted for creating six Horcruxes, and as you will no doubt appreciate, only four have so far been accounted for."
Taking his silence for tacit agreement, she shook her head. "Well it turns out it's entirely possible when half of the people my father invited round that evening were working for him."
"I'm just saying." Harry raised his hands as a kind of half-apology. "What can your father do about Voldemort? I don't think he's even talking to Dumbledore."
Chancing a look back, Harry saw that she was just about managing to keep pace. The sight of her running beneath the infrequent lamps, with her father being dragged behind like a half-deflated balloon really drove home just how utterly crazy his evening had become. Behind them, the Death Eaters had finally seen them, and were beginning to make chase.
"That's fine," said Harry as he silenced any further questions from Effie with a look. "What about a bath? You're looking pretty grubby. Maybe it'll make you feel better?"
Harry stared at her in silence as he tried to digest the words. It was so very similar to the one which Dumbledore had been so certain could apply only to him, and yet the ending of it was different. He frowned. "Did Dumbledore know about it?" he asked carefully.
"I think I'll have that bath now," she said shortly. Without saying anything else, she retreated into the bathroom, and slammed the door shut, neatly cutting Effie short.
"The matter in question concerns the late Lucius Malfoy's last efforts before Voldemort caught up with him." As the Headmaster spoke Voldemort's name, Snape flinched slightly, and rubbed at his arm.
Perhaps Iana had a death wish, but she didn't back down an inch. "We're returning to our dorms after having detention with Professor Snape," she said tightly. "You can ask him."
In the rush, Harry was only able to sit beside Ron. On his other side a Hufflepuff called Justin Finch-Fletchley had ousted Dean from his spot. They both exchanged muted greetings while they quickly pulled their books, quill and parchments out.
In the end, this was a fun experience for me. I hope it was a fun read for you too, even if the joke at the end didn't really land. Future stories will return to your regularly scheduled crossovers. My next project is an original work, which will be followed by the sequel to Toppling Heroes. Beyond that, I have plans for some Warhammer crossovers in the works which are currently slated for next year. Oh, and I'll keep plugging away at Shadow of Angmar. Follow my author's page if any of that sounds like your cup of tea.
Through the after shadows of the flash, Harry looked up to see Voldemort swaying, his red eyes spinning up into his skull. Then, like a tree with its trunk cut, he toppled over backwards.
He was cut off suddenly, and even when Harry pressed his ear up against the door, he could hear nothing.
Harry pushed himself up and started moving towards the door. For some reason he felt like he was walking to his own execution. He turned back to see his friends looking up at him, all with similar worried expressions. "I'll be back soon," he said, before adding, "Hopefully."
"I swear to Merlin, Seamus, if you keep perving on Malfoy, I can't be held responsible for what happens," said Neville. "Didn't you learn your lesson last time?"
Dean and Neville exchanged a look. "Oh, no, no, no," said Dean, shaking his head emphatically. "You're not getting away with it that easy. What
Despite the seeming stupidity of the password, the Gargoyle immediately stepped aside to allow Harry access to the stairway beyond. He started climbing.
"No!" she said instantly. "No, don't do that." She looked off to the side, and waved at someone unseen somewhere down the train. The smile she favoured the unseen person with was forced, but probably only Harry, or their parents would have been able to tell. "Look. Whatever it is that's going on— we can't just… stop. That's what you've been doing for weeks. Did it help anything? Maybe he'll never come back."
"So, what do you reckon it is this time?" asked Neville as they waited for Stump to call the class in. "Veela stealing men? Centaurs stealing women? Merpeople stealing children?"
If she was expecting some kind of acknowledgement from Snape, she was to be sorely disappointed. "Yet you are still here," he said, simply. "Curfew has already passed. Do not dilly dally."
With Harry's agreement, Dumbledore whirled around and set off in the direction of the lifts. His long robes streamed out behind him like a warrior's tabard, and Fawkes flew as a herald before him. As the lift doors closed, Harry caught a glimpse of the silvery light of some spell before he was gone. Harry shook himself, he didn't have time to waste. It took only seconds to cross the Atrium at a flat run, and soon he reached the huge fireplaces used by those who chose to Floo to the Ministry.
Neville leaned in as if to share some great secret. "Anthony said he saw her coming out of the Hospital Wing the day after."
"Buggered if I know," said Harry. "I don't think I asked, and Dumbledore hasn't said anything about it."
Iana nodded a little reluctantly, and repeated the words that had pretty much defined her life since birth.
"With all their crazy prank inventions they must have found a few safe places to hide them away too," said Neville, nodding in agreement.
"Dumbledore doesn't think Voldemort had the chance to create his sixth before he tried to kill you," Harry replied. "So that just leaves one. And he seems sure it's an item belonging to Rowena Ravenclaw."
Harry got the distinct impression that they didn't really know anything more than he did anyway. But how was that even possible?
"Wonderful!" Dumbledore clapped his hands together cheerfully. "Then I think it is time you returned to your dorms. You need not worry about Professor Rosier. It seems he has returned to his rooms for the evening." Quite how he knew Rosier's precise whereabouts, Harry did not know. Perhaps it had something to do with one of the spindly silver instruments.
"It's worth a try, I suppose," Lily agreed before turning to Iana. "I know it's a lot to ask, so soon after what happened, but do you think that's something you could do?"
"Let's start with your mother," she said predictably. Harry knew very well that Flitwick and her had never gotten on well.
"Old Dumbledore wants to talk to you," said Neville, leaning precariously over one of the stone bannisters. "Was just going to drop my stuff and find you in the library. Have you been hiding away from us again?"
"You are misguided," said Voldemort with a rueful shake of his head, "but I suppose it is only to be expected. You were lied to. Kept in the dark for far too long, so that Dumbledore could protect his precious saviour.
Harry's mouth snapped shut. He didn't need to be reminded of just what might be at stake; he was standing next to a painful example of it. He nodded.
The corridors of Hogwarts were dead quiet. With even the teachers attending the feast, probably the only things stalking the halls were Mrs Norris, the caretaker's cat, and Peeves the Poltergeist. Fortunately for Harry, he encountered neither of them.
Before those thoughts could run away with what remained of his determination, the lift doors opened, and he was greeted with a long corridor, swathed in darkness. At the far end he could see a slither of light escaping through an unclosed door.
Raised hands forestalled any rising ire, as she said, "No, no, no! I'm not taking her side, but bitch or not, it was still a bit harsh, don't you think?"
Two of the Death Eaters who had been pursuing Harry and Iana rushed out into the room, their wands aimed unerringly at them. They were both breathing heavily, and the mask of one of them was blackened and cracked down one side, but their wands didn't falter.
" he whispered desperately, hoping that the door hadn't been locked with anything too powerful to be overcome with the unlocking charm. The click of the door's lock was like music to his ears.
"It's from a Muggle Christmas story," she said. It probably didn't help much but Neville nodded at her gratefully all the same.
She subsided just a little, and leaned down to pick up the book that had fallen. "I never had friends, you know? Crabbe and Goyle are about as interesting to talk to as slabs of gristle, and the
"I see the House Elves have been hard at work," he said in no small amount of wonder. It would have taken a witch or wizard hundreds of hours to make any kind of sense of the room, and the Elves had apparently managed to do it in the middle of a magical siege.
been a happy bunny for the last month of summer. He'd stayed locked in his room nearly the entire time, venturing out only for meals and when his parents actually dragged him out.
"Um. Excuse me," Juliet interjected in the curious tone of one who was not really apologising at all. "Are you two… you know?" Her finger waggled between Harry and Iana, and in case her question wasn't clear enough, she added a little kissy noise for good measure.
"Jelly Babies," said Dumbledore, and the Gargoyle jumped to the side immediately, revealing the spiral staircase beyond.
"It was some kind of withering curse. I don't think he even really knew I was there. He grabbed my hand and told me he was sorry, that he should have stopped me." She shook her head and rubbed at her eyes angrily. "I told him it was okay, but that I didn't understand what he meant."
"So, what's the plan?" James asked as he pushed himself upright. His eyes settled on Harry. "Hey, you look almost as bad as me. You okay?"
"Doubt it," he grumbled, as he folded his book closed, his thumb keeping the page. "Mum and Dad have been snowed under at work. Probably means another Christmas with Great Uncle Algie."
Harry really didn't want to think about that as he had a creeping feeling she might be right. "Whatever."
"This is where you've been hiding away!" said Dean in the voice of one who spent very little time in the Hogwarts Library. If he wasn't careful he'd bring Madam Pince running in no time.
"I very much doubt that," Iana grumbled with obvious reluctance. She didn't protest when he sat down, though.
"If I am to die, then I will accept it," said Dumbledore calmly. "But I would like to cause you a little more inconvenience before I go."
"What's wrong?" Harry asked, but before she could respond an echoing boom which shook the entire castle.
"Might also have something to do with cosmetic charms too," said Neville Longbottom, his voice dry. He hadn't arrived until a little later and was in the unenviable situation of being a bit less drunk than everyone else.
It was also obvious that Harry wasn't about to be included in the meeting, though he still had a little hope that he might be able to wheedle something from his parents once it was all over.
With the only moment of excitement being a near miss with Peeves who was busily attempting to install a tripwire in the corridor that contained the statue hiding the Hufflepuff common room, they soon arrived at the entrance to the kitchens. Not wanting to waste any time, Harry quickly tickled the pear, and they all shuffled in.
"Do not worry, the Ministry event does not commence until later, so you will be able to attend the feast. In fact, it would be best, I think, if we are seen to enjoy the festivities," he said, allaying Harry's concerns.
Then, at the back of the crowd, Harry caught sight of Snape, looking on over the proceedings with an expression of sour satisfaction.
It only took a minute or two to bring some level of order to his hair once more, and soon he was descending back down the stairs. He heard familiar voices coming from the living room.
Harry might have nibbled his way through a few mouthfuls of food by the time the feast had ended. Everyone hung around for a while, chatting and laughing amongst themselves, while Harry hovered on the periphery, not really taking part in any of the conversations. Finally, and at long last, it was time. Harry watched as Dumbledore left the feast, and after waiting a little while he decided to follow along.
"Indeed, were it not for that, it is possible that the prophecy could have applied to either you or Mr. Longbottom. His mother is Alice, which means noble, and his birth was scant hours before your own. But he was born on the fourth day of the eighth lunar month. Had the year of your birth not been a leap year, it would be he to whom I would be talking now, instead of you."
Then, suddenly, she was crying. It wasn't the same as Christmas when it had seemed like she was barely even aware of her surroundings. Every tear that fell was brushed away with angry swipes of her hands, but the flow did not stop. Harry knew that another hug was probably a bad idea. She'd been in shock last time, and hadn't even really known who it was. That was not the case this time. Nonetheless, he moved to sit beside her. Close enough that he was nearby, but not so close that he was infringing on her personal space.
"I shall leave any necessary discipline to you, Headmaster," he said. He then turned and beat a hasty retreat around a dark corridor as sleepy-eyed paintings followed his departure.
"He became angry, then infuriated when he could not convince me with his weasel words and false promises. He always imagined himself such an intelligent man, yet he had not the wit to see the strings that governed his actions. He liked to think of himself as the true heir to Slytherin's legacy, and just as Salazar had once sought to court my mother, so too did he hope to court me.
"A very astute question indeed. I must confess that I do not know, though I have my suspicions." Dumbledore leaned back and stroked his beard, looking thoughtful. "We must assume that they have some purpose, however. That is why I believe it would be wise for you and I to take a short trip to the Ministry one day soon so that we might remove it from the board, as it were."
He pushed himself upright, and quickly pulled his clothes and robes on. A quick flick of his wand erased any evidence of their presence. Benches and tables creaked back into place, and books and scrolls flew up from the floor where they'd been cast in the throes of their clumsy lovemaking, back onto the desks. He glanced up at the clock and realised with a start that it was getting late. It was nearly sunset.
If he was being honest with himself, Harry really didn't understand why she was so fixated on the name, but then if it really had been given to her by her dead mother, maybe it wasn't so strange.
James had been the worst off out of all of them. He'd been on the receiving end of multiple curses, and Pomfrey said it was nothing short of a miracle that he was alive when he'd arrived alongside Sirius in a pillar of phoenix flame. One side of his body had almost been completely burned away, and both his left arm and leg were gone completely. The dark curse that had done so much damage also meant that there was no chance for them to be regrown.
Harry pulled out his dragon-hide gloves, a lifesaver which Sirius had suggested to him after his first detention with Snape, and started scrubbing as he did his best to ignore the periodic suspicious glare from the potions Professor.
It was obvious James and Sirius had been able to put up an impressive fight. Voldemort's robes were singed in many places, with smoke still curling around the hems. A mixture of soot and blood smeared his deathly pale face, but the malice in his eyes was as powerful as ever.
name, and said they could always have another child together." She looked up. "Even said he'd hope for a boy this time. Wanted to call him Draco."
"There was a Prophecy, you know?" Voldemort continued, addressing them all as his voice grew in volume. "Of one with the power to defeat me." He gestured to the brute who was carrying Iana, and he threw her to the floor.
When the door clicked closed, there was a short pause before Dean spoke. "So, uh, what are we doing?"
Ron and Seamus were just about nose to nose, but paused when Harry spoke. They both looked at Harry, then at each other, then back at Harry again. They both grinned a little sheepishly and relaxed.
The next moment, Harry found himself in a shadowy corner of the atrium of the Ministry of Magic. Usually, it was thronging with witches and wizards of all stripes, but this time it was almost completely silent. The only sounds to be heard were the rustling of Dumbledore's long robes and the gentle watery burble of the Fountain of the Magical Hero. Most of the atrium was dark, but a shaft of light illuminated the fountain which showed a very dramatic interpretation of Voldemort's supposed final moments.
Iana's presence made it feel like the place had become haunted by a particularly surly ghost. Most of the time she stayed locked away in the guest bedroom, and the about only times she appeared were meal times. Even then, she restrained herself to the words 'fine', 'yes', 'no', and 'okay'. As a result, Harry hadn't been able to get anything more out of her about whatever it was that had happened at Christmas.
"We believe there are two more Horcruxes remaining," said Dumbledore, leaning forward again. "The first, we believe to be a relic of Rowena Ravenclaw, though we do not know what it might be. The second, however, eludes us. It is possible that he has not yet had the chance to create his sixth."
"Fortunately," Dumbledore interjected, "that will hopefully be unnecessary. Prophecies are strange things, and governed not so much by magic, as by our own actions and choices. Had my brother found the young Death Eater just a little earlier, it is quite possible that none of the events of it would ever have come to pass. It was only by Voldemort's
The door was pushed slowly open, and Iana Malfoy was revealed in the archway. There was a slight smirk on her face which evaporated instantly when she realised Harry was there too. "Potter?" she sputtered.
"By the time we realised, the Dark Lord was already there. We tried to fight back, but he's—" she paused, considering her words "— it's like I was back to my first day holding a wand, and trying to fight an Auror or something. He didn't even need to try. He just found it funny, I think.
"There you are!" said Dean, giving Harry a slap on the back as he did so. He looked over at Neville. "Looks like you were right, mate. Musta been Effie."
When Harry had first seen Professor Stump, his first thought was that she was one of the creatures they were meant to be studying. She was squat, with a collection of warts that could have put a hag to shame. She had two lazy eyes, which made it incredibly uncomfortable when she was talking directly to him, as he felt distinctly like she was about to walk off in two different directions. Her frizzy brown hair was tied into a loose bun which became ever looser as the day wore on. Finally, she topped it off with a pointy hat which was two sizes too small, and pinned to her bun at what she probably thought was a jaunty angle.
There was little doubt in Harry's mind that Iana would have simply laughed the advice off had it come from anyone other than the Headmaster.
to tell him what to do? She'd just about made it her bloody mission to make his life at school as miserable as she could, all while her slimeball of a father had made it his mission to do the same for people like Remus, or even Harry's own mum.
He knew Effie had been left completely in the dark over it all, but what had come as a surprise was that she didn't needle and prod. She'd been quiet, and given Harry as much space as he'd needed.
"He must have sabotaged it in some way," said Lily. Then she shook her head, a chagrined look on her face. "No. Anything like that and Voldemort would have been able to work it out. Then how?"
"You always were a canny old man," said Voldemort, the seeming coolness of his voice belied by the baleful glint in his red eyes.
It might have been half an hour before one of them spoke, the minutes just seemed to evaporate, and there was really not all that much that needed said. Not urgently anyway. Harry was quite content to simply be.
He found Sirius first, but with the amount of spell damage he'd received, it did not bolster Harry's hopes. He was swathed head to toe in bandages, and his body was covered in black, malformed lumps which stunk of death and seemed to have something moving inside them. He tried to ask the orderly who was casting spells over him what was wrong, but it only resulted in him being chased away, and the curtain being pulled around the bed to forestall any further interruptions.
Unfortunately, it refused to so much as hint at opening for him. He tried every unlocking spell he could think of and it stayed steadfastly shut.
"I think we should aim to depart by around 9pm," said Dumbledore. "That way, if all goes as planned, we will have more than enough time to depart and return before curfew. It should also give you ample time to enjoy the evening."
Most of it was in gold, except for a towering figure in black marble who was standing over the tiny figure of Iana Malfoy, while her father tried to fight back valiantly. The expression on the baby Iana's face was probably meant to be defiant, but Harry had always felt she looked a bit like she needed to go to the toilet.
Iana looked like she wanted to argue, but when another explosion blasted chunks of her transfigured wall across the room, she realised how stupid that would be, and darted through the door. Harry slammed it shut and spelled it locked again.
"So what happened?" Harry asked, unable to restrain his curiosity. She'd raised the subject, anyway.
"I think, actually, you three 'ruined it' by telling the same joke every year for six years. The poor boy was eleven at the time," said Lily as her eyes flicked to her unrepentant husband and his best friend. "I wonder what you two were like at that age, hmm?"
He was even starting to regret quitting the Quidditch team. He found he actually could have used the distraction the games and training brought. That ship had most definitely sailed, though. Especially after Ginny's first game as Seeker saw her pull off an impressive acrobatic move to catch the Snitch, ensuring Gryffindor's victory over Slytherin by quite a margin.
"That sounds perfect," said Harry with a smile which only served to excite the little Elf even more. "Maybe I can come down tomorrow, and you can show me?"
He wasn't just going to stand around and be kissed, though. He pushed her back until she was against the wall, and her slim, incredible body was writhing against him. Slim fingered hands trailed through his hair and down his neck to his chest, while his own drifted ever further south, past the tortuous curve of her waist and back. Quite when those hands found their way beneath her robes, he wasn't sure, but she moaned her approval into his mouth, unwilling to break their frantic connection.
my name. It is your name for me. It is the name of the lie my father perpetrated to further his own influence. Everyone knows Iana Malfoy. No one knows me. Even I don't know me!" She pushed an errant strand of blonde hair from her face. "I've never had the chance. I was always training, or studying, or learning how to play the role of Father's perfect little Witch."
With a final departing glance, and a brief squeeze of her hand, which he'd been holding the whole time, Harry quickly departed. He didn't go far, only the short distance necessary to check up on Effie, but he could feel Iana's gaze on him every step of the way.
"I need to stop her!" Harry shouted as he tried to yank his arm free, only for his other arm to be held back by someone else. He turned to find Effie holding on too, her face a mask of fierce determination. "Let go!" Harry bellowed.
A boom like a cannon shot sounded, accompanied by a flash of light bright enough to leave Harry temporarily blinded. He was knocked flat against the ground, his head rapping painfully upon the stones. Flashes and spots, like firefly echoes of the explosion which had come before, filled his vision but in the vacuum left by the explosion a deceptively quiet noise followed. The clatter of a wand landing upon the stone of the bridge.
"What?" Iana gave Snape a look of utter incredulity, as if he was suggesting she muck out a dragon. "You can't—"
"Calm down, Harry," said Dumbledore soothingly. "There are protections on the Prophecies which ensure that only the subjects may remove them, or hear them. Only if Voldemort himself walked into the Ministry could your secret be uncovered."
"Hey, Effie," said Harry gently, brushing her hair in an attempt to comfort her. She responded by trying to pull him to her even more tightly. "Can't breathe here, Eff."
Iana shook her head. If the hiss of discomfort that followed was anything to go by, she regretted it pretty quickly. She rubbed at her forehead, no doubt trying to ease the pain.
"If others have been able to find the locations, they must have discovered some kind of connection," said Iana. Obviously she hadn't been listening to him. "My father, Dumbledore and you said some other Death Eater all found the locations of some of them?"
"What was that about?" she asked him once everyone else had gone their separate ways. They fell automatically into step as they walked the route back to the Gryffindor dorms.
Seamus groaned. "Can I just say? Merlin I'm glad we got to drop Sorcery and Society after O. . If I had to listen to him complain about how terrible it is that me mam and da' were allowed to stay together for another year, I don't know what I'd do."
That made absolutely no sense to Harry, and it was probably obvious on his face as Dumbledore chuckled. "Perhaps Miss Malfoy is correct, and my fears are unfounded. I do not believe it is anything with which you need concern yourself, however. Rest assured that I and others are keeping a close eye on Professor Rosier."
A glance over at Snape gave Harry nothing to work with. His face was not blank, but the grimace he was sporting was common enough that Harry couldn't hope to interpret it.
"Why do you want to know? Going to run straight to Dumbledore with it, are you?" Iana asked. As she was speaking, something changed in her expression. The tiredness was replaced by anger.
"And I am James Potter," said James. He pointed at Harry's mum. "That is Lily Potter, and that sorry excuse for a wizard over there is Sirius Black." Then he pointed at the headmaster. "And that is Albus Dumbledore. The only man Voldemort ever feared. We're all going to be doing every damned thing we can to ensure you and Effie, and all of your friends, don't have to experience what we did when we were growing up. Voldemort might be powerful, but right now he's weak. He still needs to regain his body, and his followers are divided. Lucius Malfoy might be a bastard and a bigot, but a lot of Voldemort's most influential followers are well and truly in his pocket. Even if he did manage to come back, without his old followers he'll find it a lot more difficult to wage his war than he did last time."
"No, no! Nothing more," said Harry quickly. "It's just— well, it all seems a lot of fuss if it's all just that, isn't it?"
"If he does come back, I'm going to have to fight," he continued. He lifted Effie's chin up and looked her in the eye. "I don't really know how, but I'm going to do it. I'll keep Mum and Dad safe." For her.
Ignoring his sister's unnecessary huffing and puffing as she stood up and darted in the direction of the stairs, Harry turned back to Iana. "How did he manage that? Isn't the Manor one of the best protected places in Britain?"
"Nothing good," said Harry, scowling at the absolute mess it had made of his otherwise happy life. "You don't really think I'm gonna tell you, do you?"
"Enough of this, Tom," said Dumbledore as he moved to place himself between Voldemort and Iana. "Whatever plan you had for this evening failed. You know there is no chance of that Prophecy surviving."
"We're not meant to," said Harry simply. "If we find it, we tell the Headmaster and let him deal with it."
Deciding he'd pushed his luck far enough, Harry relented. "Well, okay. Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted six Horcruxes. For seven soul fragments."
Harry thought about it for a second, frowning as he did so. "But why does it matter?" He shrugged. "You're called Iana."
When Dumbledore reached the desk, he looked over and let out a hiss-like breath. Unable to curb his curiosity, Harry peered over too, and met the open, glassy eyes of a young woman whom he could easily recognise. He breathed in sharply, and might even have cried out had he not already been silenced. It was Nymphadora Tonks. Sirius' favourite cousin, and someone Harry had known for years. Usually she wore her hair in vibrant hues; blue, yellow, green or pink, but in death it had returned to an unremarkable mousy brown. For some reason, that really drove it home. She was really dead. She'd always seemed so… alive. Now her eyes, usually so full of life, were empty. Just like that, she was gone. Everything she'd been was nothing more than a memory.
There was a distant look in her eyes, and Harry could tell she was thinking about the events of Halloween. "What really happened on Halloween?" he asked. "How did you end up at the Ministry?"
Suddenly, the floor disappeared beneath his feet. It became a cloud of stinging splinters, which pierced his clothes and slashed his skin as it was blasted upwards to pepper the ceiling.
Dean and Seamus, somewhat true to form, only really turned up once in a blue moon. Given their tendency to chat rather than research, Harry felt it wasn't really that much of a loss.
help Mr. Potter with his task of cleaning the class supplies. Perhaps with your help he will be able to perform the task to a tolerable level."
He clapped his hands over his ears again, and his wand clattered forgotten to the floor as the infernal sound seemed to fill up his entire world. At the same time, the air became blisteringly hot and he realised that the Fiendfyre was surely looking for a new target to consume.
"What's really going on, Iana?" Harry asked. He gripped her hand tightly, and she made no attempt to pull it free. "What's wrong? Whatever it is, I can help."
The rest of the journey to the Slytherin Common Room was conducted in silence. Perhaps it might have been awkward, but there was really nothing Harry was interested in saying to Iana, nor she, him. Dumbledore seemed to be quite happy keeping his thoughts to himself. In short order, they arrived at the corridor which Harry knew to contain the hidden entrance.
Effie had joined them too, as it turned out that most of her own friends had elected to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas. She sat next to Neville and across from Harry, and spent most of the time giving him the stink-eye.
In his compartment of the train, Dean and Seamus were attempting to one-up each other with tales of drunken excess from previous years while Neville sat quietly reading over some Herbology text. Ron was staying at Hogwarts as his parents were visiting Charlie for Christmas again. Apparently Mrs Weasley had given up on her mostly fruitless yearly attempts to lure all of her sons home.
After they'd been so close, he felt the loss of her presence all the more profoundly. He could still feel the whisper of her smooth skin under his searching fingers, the swell and curve of her body against his own. He could still feel it, like the last reluctant moments of a vivid dream, evaporating into the growing light of morning.
about the Horcruxes? Surely her father would have mentioned something to her? Second, would it be so bad if he told her what he was looking for, even if she didn't? Then again, why didn't she know? She was meant to be the Girl-Who-Lived!
"Mum," said Effie, waving her hand in an attempt to get her attention, but she was completely ignored.
Harry blinked. He wasn't sure what he'd been expecting, but that hadn't been it. "It's, um, okay, sir?"
"She said she did. She said she fought with every ounce of her being. That she died not to make me a sacrifice, but to give me the life that fate tried to take from me. She said that every lie they told, to the world, to me, was meant to give me a chance at living the life they wanted for me."
Harry tried to sit and read, but it was a lost cause. With the strange tension still not really diminished, and Juliet's endless chirpy discourse, he spent most of the time staring at a single page, reading and re-reading the same two or three paragraphs.
"Well, it's bad, obviously," said Harry, not understanding what his father was getting at. "Malfoy was supposed to be doing a lot to fight against Voldemort, right? Like getting the Ministry ready and such?"
"I prefer my women able to stand up on their own in a stiff breeze," said Neville, much to Harry's relief. "And hold a conversation on more than one topic. Hermione's pretty hot when she makes an effort."
"I guess." She trudged away up the stairs. The single glance back when she reached the top betrayed just how interested she really was.
"Just about," said Effie. Mercifully, she also seemed to understand the gravity of the situation, even if neither of them really knew what it was. "I made it nice and warm. I thought that's what I'd probably prefer."
"And no, I haven't killed anyone. A few spiders, rats, that kind of thing." The look she gave him actually seemed a little sad, as if she was disappointed that he'd even think of asking.
There was no way he was going to ruin their happiness by telling them everything he knew. He resolved to try to protect them any way he could.
And wasn't that just lovely news? They'd apparently had years to prepare, and despite all that they'd only found two thirds of them?
"You already know exactly what I mean." She'd seen that Harry had a Prophecy. Whatever else she might be, Harry knew she wasn't stupid.
her go," said James, his usually bright eyes dark with impotent anger. "She snuck out." He handed him a note on worn parchment. "She charmed this to come to us when she was far enough away."
"What the bloody hell was that?" Harry asked as he steadied himself on the shelf next to him, which wobbled precariously.
Seeing Harry's nearly empty trunk, she started bustling around the room, throwing clothes and other things into his trunk haphazardly. "Can you tell me what it's about?" she asked without looking at him. "You and Mum and Dad have all been acting really weird since Professor Dumbledore came around. What's going on?"
"And you believed him?" asked Dean. "Furley's been at the Wasps for years. He's not gonna pack it in there to join the losing team."
"We can't just go around asking everyone," said Seamus, beating Harry to the punch. "This is meant to be a secret, yeah?"
"I'm alive," he said, the realisation suddenly hitting him. He's stood up to Voldemort. He'd seen the green flash as the Killing Curse had formed on his wand.
Fawkes released an angry squawk as Harry shoved Dumbledore's limp body off his mother, but he didn't care. She was covered in blood, though he wasn't sure how much was hers and how much was Dumbledore's, but after a moment, Harry realised she was still breathing.
No reply was forthcoming, and a few seconds later Iana whispered her password to the wall part way down the corridor, and disappeared into the newly created opening.
"Don't even try to get out of that one. You—" He paused, and glanced at Seamus who was still engaged in a battle, trying to get his trunk onto the rack. "You've got a wand, you know?" He turned back to Harry, ignoring Seamus' somewhat embarrassed "Fuck off". "You have a family, you know? They talk? Wouldn't be surprised if you'd forgotten about that little fact, though."
"A fascinating creation," said Dumbledore. "Capable of creating a simulacrum of a memory. Most useful when one has rather more on one's mind than can be reasonably managed."
"I'm sorry," he said honestly, his shoulder slumping. "I'm just… I guess I'll never really understand what it's been like."
"Do you think I cannot see through these pathetic attempts?" he asked. "Perhaps they would work on school children. Have you lost your edge, fading away in that crumbling ruin you call a school?"
"Don't remind me," Iana grumbled, though there was little fire to it. That had burned itself out a few weeks ago. "So it has something to do with dear old Father?"
At her enthusiastic prompting, they all reluctantly abandoned their chairs, watching sadly as they were quickly claimed by others, and traipsed out of the portrait hole. The Fat Lady was fast asleep as usual for that time of night, and Harry was gratified that she wouldn't be making a fuss about them being out in the corridors after curfew.
Seamus had the good grace to look ashamed, but only for a moment. "Wait, wait, wait. I know!" he nearly shouted. "I bet he wants to love her good!" He toppled over laughing while everyone else shared a glance.
Voldemort obviously realised the same thing. He peered at the Headmaster with open suspicion. "What schemes do you have planned? You know that tricks will not work on me."
"You still trying to work out where the… things are?" asked Neville. Harry was grateful that he realised that talking about Horcruxes in the common room probably wasn't the best idea.
She turned on Harry, hands set on her hips in a fashion that was less intimidating than she likely imagined. "What did you say to her?"
"Alright, so, where were we?" said Dean. "Oh, yeah. Effie's definitely gotta be on the list. She's pretty good now, but if your mum is anything to go by… phew. They'll need to add some bigger numbers." He whistled appreciatively.
Despite whatever his sister might think, there was no way he was going to ruin the first day back at Hogwarts for his friends by telling them the most feared Dark Wizard was out there, hiding in the shadows and plotting his return.
Remus stared at him for a long moment, before he reached out with one arm to draw Harry in for another hug. "I'm sure you did what you had to do," he said gently. He pointed over at where Lily and Effie were being seen to by a harried Pomfrey. "You all got out of there alive, and that's what's important. Don't second guess it."
It was Iana Malfoy. Of course it was. She'd never been one to pass up an opportunity to get in everyone's faces on the ride to Hogwarts. There wasn't a single trip which Harry could remember that didn't involve a little visit from the wizarding world's most unlikable celebrity.
When she paused to gaze thoughtfully out of the window once more, Harry decided to prompt her to continue. "Where did you take it?"
"Sounds like the usual crap they always put in there to make it sound good," said Ron with all the authority of someone who'd dozed through dozens of Divination lessons. "Probably just means she has the hots for you, so you fight him to save her or something."
"Oh, hoh? So you're on our side now?" Harry asked, his voice rising an octave. "What have you done to help, then? How did that letter go? Haven't seen it in the Prophet yet. Was it too painful to write nice things about the Headmaster?"
Downstairs, James, Lily and Sirius ran to the front door from the kitchen. James immediately transfigured the door into something more durable, while Sirius peered out at whatever was in the garden.
Most of them had taken Dumbledore's death hard. If rumours were to be believed, McGonagall had spent most of her evenings for the past few days plinking away at her impressive whisky collection, while Sprout had barely even been out of her greenhouses. Flitwick, along with a few of the other teachers, had only been seen at meals.
"Hmm." The look on James' face made it clear he didn't believe a word of it. "Anyway while you know that Malfoy died, I'm not sure you really understand what it means."
"So is that why you're looking through all those books?" he asked. "You reckon your real name is something to do with one of your ancestors?"
Iana spat something dark onto the floor and glared up at the masked man. "Then he can come and get it himself."
Whatever it was that Dumbledore wanted to discuss, it was clear he didn't want to do it out in the open, even if the night time corridors of Hogwarts were almost completely empty. He led Harry up a few staircases, and down a couple of corridors until they were standing before the Gargoyle that guarded the entrance to his office.
That snapped him out of the daze he'd been in, and he spun around and sprinted for the door. It was a good thing the corridors were so quiet, if anyone had been wandering along them, Harry probably would have flattened them in his frantic charge. He took two or three steps at a time as he descended the stairs, nearly tripping on more than one occasion, but he didn't care.
Eventually, their mirth subsided, and Harry pulled himself upright. He extended a hand to Iana, who took it and rose next to him.
"This is magic at its deepest and least understood," said Lily apologetically. "I wish I could tell you more. I wish I could make all this go away, but I am not Merlin. I'm not even Dumbledore, and even he was at a loss for years."
Apart from the two residents of the room, the first thing Harry noticed was the curious marble bowl encrusted with runes. Next to it were a couple of small vials filled with a strange liquid with a mother of pearl sheen.
That shut Harry up long enough for Effie to return with a glass of water which Iana accepted wordlessly. She gulped it all down in a few seconds, and put it down on the floor next to her.
"We were going to tell you before you went back," James admitted. "We just wanted you to be able to enjoy the holidays a bit is all."
"But how does—" Harry began before another question overtook it. "How can you—" And another. "Isn't Voldemort dead already? How can I be the one in the prophecy if Malfoy has already done it?" His gaze flitted across to his parents once more, and their expressions were transparent. "He's not dead, is he?"
"Well, yeah," said Harry. He had to concede the obvious. Still didn't explain why she was so pissed at him. It had suited her just fine until recently. "What did he do to you, though?"
Neither James nor Lily seemed to be convinced by that, but in the end it didn't really matter. They were going to tell him, whether they thought he'd like it or not.
"I'm starting to think it might just be a Potter thing," said Neville with a long suffering shake of his head. "Dad always did say they were mad."
Professor Stump had never been his favourite teacher, what with her tendency to talk about every non-human creature as if it was some kind of dangerous alien from one of the muggle's horror movies. If it hadn't been for the sheer unpleasantness of Professor Snape, who resented Harry's very existence, or Professor Rosier who held firmly to the belief that
That brought Harry up short. He wasn't sure how to respond, and while he was trying to work out some kind of reply, Effie continued.
The days following Halloween passed like a whirlwind. Harry's promised conversation with Dumbledore left him only with more questions. Voldemort had returned, but just
talk about how hot Dean thinks my mum and sister are on my birthday?" Harry asked. "Unless you want me to throw up, that is."
Iana, however, was there almost as much as he was. She soon started spending more of her time researching Harry's problem than her own, and it quickly became apparent that he had to tell her a little bit more about why he was so interested in Ravenclaw's possessions.
"Elf magic is different," said Iana. Outwardly, she seemed confident, but with how well Harry had come to know her, he could tell she was rattled. She was toying with the sleeve of her robe absentmindedly. "A curse like that should have killed him before we even got here. The only thing keeping him alive must have been his Elf magic, so I sent him to the only place he might be able to get help. Pomfrey would have been useless."
Harry stopped her by grabbing her hand. "I'd rather you stayed," he said, ignoring the many watching eyes. "If you want to go, I can't stop you. Well, I could" — he caught the look of challenge in her eye — "maybe. Anyway, what I mean is we did this together. If everything we've been through doesn't make us as good as family, I don't know what does."
Iana seemed to understand what was confusing him. "That's why it was so hard to work it out. Why nothing seemed to feel
"As soon as Father felt the Dark Lord bypass the Manor's protections, we tried to run but Orontius tried to stop us. After Father killed him, we ran to the Floo and tried to escape that way but someone had already removed us from the network.
"But it's destroyed now, right?" Harry asked as he peered at the ruined journal. Surely whatever had happened to it had broken Voldemort's spells? "He can die again?"
He rushed over to her, sudden worry that something had happened to her which he hadn't noticed sending his stomach into turmoil. When he arrived, her open eyes were staring blankly at the ceiling but as soon as he reached out to grasp her hand, a flicker of life was kindled in them, and she turned to look at him.
A great crash echoed through the hall as the falling shelves smashed into the next shelf along and it, too, started to teeter over.
Maybe the best way forward was to let her think he'd given in and told her as much as he could. "We can't talk about it here," he said as he swung his hand at the busy room. "It's a task from Dumbledore."
"Just so, Miss Malfoy," said Snape curtly. Sirius had once told Harry that Snape owed his position at Hogwarts to Lucius Malfoy, much like Rosier and Stump, and the result of that patronage was clear. Iana could do no wrong, so far as he was concerned. "You will be helping Mr. Potter in his current task."
Ignoring their continued jabs at each other Lily smiled at Harry. "You'd best go and get ready," she said. "Your friends will be arriving soon. You may as well open your presents once they arrive."
Harry found himself swallowing nervously at just how quickly it was all moving. As soon as Harry was holding on firmly to Dumbledore's surprisingly strong hand, Fawkes spread his wings wide, and loosed a beautiful trilling noise which drove away the rising nervousness, if only for a moment. Then, the dark Hogwarts corridor disappeared in a pillar of fire.
"We wondered if there was some way that… love might be able to hurt the Dark Lord?" Iana added, sounding slowly less and less certain the further she got. "That sounds stupid, doesn't it?"
Remus met his eye. "If he was endangering you, or your sister, or any of us? In a second. You did good, Harry."
"Apart from raising me on a lie?" she asked with a mirthless smile. "Oh, I don't know. How about trying to sacrifice me so he could save his own pathetic skin?"
Once they'd been left outside the doors, which Pince had drawn obvious pleasure from slamming in their faces, they stared at each other in silence.
Despite the Headmaster's suggestion, Harry did not tell his friends anything. He most certainly did not tell Iana anything about the Prophecy. Dumbledore's likely reasoning was sound. If Voldemort did return, Iana probably had every reason to want to see him dead again; more so even than anyone else Harry knew. He still wasn't about to interact with her any more than was absolutely necessary though.
Lily wasted no time in sending a blindingly powerful curse across the room at Pettigrew who screamed and threw himself to the ground unnecessarily. Voldemort reacted with the speed of a striking viper, and a large section of floor lifted into the curse's path before it could reach its target. The lump of stone and timber was utterly destroyed, but Peter survived unharmed.
"But you're Iana Malfoy," Harry said, throwing his arms up. "Everyone knows your name. There's probably lessons taught on you at Uagadou. It's your name because it's always
"Nothing important," she lied, unable to meet his eyes. She glanced around again, before taking Harry's hand and dragging him into the abandoned transfiguration classroom.
"Well, I'm not going to complain about having a decent place to sit," said Iana with a shrug as she plopped herself down on the seat. She gave Harry a very pointed look.
"You have been misled. By Dumbledore. By Lucius Malfoy. I am no monster who would kill children. I would not train them for war as Lucius Malfoy did. I will not leave them floundering in the dark like Dumbledore. I am the saviour of our kind."
were also some kind of dangerous alien, Professor Stump would have easily taken the coveted prize for Harry's least favourite teacher.
Incapable of making any noises that wouldn't make him sound like one of Malfoy's rented baboons, Harry just sat back and seethed.
The hesitance in her voice was something almost completely new to Harry, but he knew it was mostly his own doing. He had
"Stay safe, you two," he said to his dad and sister. He then trotted quickly over to Iana. As he got nearer she made a little gesture with her head, and slipped around the corner.
It didn't last long. After a few seconds Harry got up to close the door, but was stopped when Dean and Neville popped up just outside.
Harry was torn between bristling with indignation, and agreement. In the end he settled for sending a scowl at Snape. It was duly ignored.
"And I can have a look around to see if I can find anything that might relate to Rowena Ravenclaw," she replied.
"Well she is the bloody Girl-Who-Lived," Neville pointed out. "You don't think she isn't getting every kind of special training her dad can afford?"
It coalesced into the shape of a face, with gleaming red eyes shining out from within the deeper shadows of its otherwise empty eye sockets. Like a great snake, it lunged towards the growing fire, and enveloped it in darkness.
I'm really heartened by the response to this. I thought it would be a much less popular concept than it seems it is. Hope I can keep it up!
"I have already reconvened some other like-minded individuals," said Dumbledore. "And whilst there is little Lucius and I see eye to eye on, he can at least be relied upon to act in his own self-interest. He will do everything in his power to ensure Voldemort is not able to return."
Dumbledore turned back to Harry and Iana, and he was once more his usual genial self. "Now, shall we make sure Miss Malfoy gets safely back to her dorms?"
"It's not over," said Harry, quietly. His fists curled tight around his wand, hard enough that his nails broke the skin. "It will never be over."
"Besides, I'm going to be spending the whole time revising too," Effie added. "Mum can be a right pain." She glanced at Harry. "Uncle Sirius said he was going to drop in with Peter though, so maybe it's not all bad."
"We did," said Harry, nodding tiredly. "When the shaking started, we figured you'd have a hard time finding anyone to help."
Still, he might have been less useless than some of the other teachers who'd graced that classroom in Harry's time at Hogwarts.
Dean frowned, clearly taken aback. "That's months away, though. They're already saying they managed to catch up with some of them. They'll all be locked away again by the time we're out of this place, so why would we need protecting?" Something dawned on him. "Wait, does this have something to do with whatever it was old Dumbledore had to say to you on your birthday? You went weird after that too. You do know he's mad, right?"
The Headmaster silenced him instantly with a simple gesture, and pulled out his wand. He didn't say anything as he stalked towards the empty desk. Gone was any hint of the absent-minded old man who presided over Hogwarts feasts with speeches composed entirely of nonsense words. In his place was a wizard Harry could readily imagine Voldemort fearing.
"Well, good night, Miss Malfoy," he said warmly. "I do hope my fears do not come to fruition, but I caution you to remember that even Slytherin himself had to work alongside those with whom he did not always agree in order to build his greatest legacy."
It said something that even after looking everywhere for wherever it was Harry was spending his free time, it had still taken three weeks to decide to look in the library. Maybe that wasn't completely fair; Harry had deliberately chosen an out-of-the-way little nook in order to avoid too many distractions.
He knew he couldn't stay still, though, and scrambled through the wreckage to hide behind another of the shelves. He was able to catch sight of Iana and her father, both hiding behind another of the shelves. Somehow, Iana had gotten hold of a wand, and was exchanging spells with one of the other Death Eaters.
"You think you can just apologise and it'll be all okay?" she asked, leaning forward. "That it just all goes away?"
"So you showed her some of Dumbledore's memories," said Harry, realising some of what must have happened. "What was in them?"
"It is being my pleasure," said Snooks as he bobbed his ready rapidly enough that Harry felt a little dizzy just watching.
"Are you truly just going to sit there with that gormless look on your face?" she whispered at him, clearly as aware as he was that Pince was just waiting for an opportunity to throw them out again.
"No," said Effie. "Most of the Order was here for a meeting or something, so they're doing everything they can to keep him at bay."
"Sorry, Professor, could you repeat the question?" he asked as he tried to get his thoughts back into some semblance of order.
Suddenly his hand contained a familiar wand of pale wood. Dumbledore's wand. He pointed it at Harry. "It was your folly to stand before me," he said. Deceptively calm though the words seemed, the rage behind his eyes was an inferno waiting to be unleashed. "Draw your wand, boy. Let us see who the true master of fate is."
"We shall come to that question a little later, if you would humour me for but a brief time," said Dumbledore. At Harry's reluctant nod, he continued, "Thank you. Prophecies are a tricky business, and I caution you not to ascribe inherent power to those words. However, the reason I believed it was necessary to tell you was that a young Death Eater also heard at least some of the Prophecy."
They both stepped aside to let the Ravenclaw house ghost past as she floated by. Harry was careful to avoid looking her in her spectral eyes. She always looked so very sad.
"You never told me," said Harry. He was unable to keep the accusation out of his tone. How long had they been going behind his back?
With some small, but mostly inaudible grumbling, Malfoy came over to where Harry was scrubbing at a cauldron which someone had coated in a thick purple goop. She managed to make it a whole twenty seconds before succumbing to the need to goad Harry in some way.
She looked up from her desk for a second as Harry and his classmates entered. "Sit," she snapped. "Hurry up. Hurry up! Merlin, save me from laggards!"
" he shouted before turning once more to run for the far end of the corridor. Maybe if they could reach the room with the doors they could lose their pursuers? He put on a turn of speed to catch up to Iana again.
The look she gave him then neatly communicated just how little she believed him. Despite that, she shrugged and returned to her own reading. It was some kind of treatise on the naming conventions in Ancient Rome.
