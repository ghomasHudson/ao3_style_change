“You don’t talk to any of my friends that way you Prick. Now get lost before you get hurt” the chill in Blakes voice sent a hot flash of excitement through Dracos body. He wanted to go over there and grab him up and slam him against the wall and the hell out of him.
“You’re an ass” he laughed. “Now go to bed and get some rest” He pulled away and walked down the hall to his and Blaises room. Draco waited until the boy disappeared behind the door before he went into his own room.
“Cheeky bastard” but it held no malice and a smile played at his lips. The two teens made their way to the great hall for lunch. And more than likely he would be in some shit with both Pansy and Blaise.
‘Figures doesn’t seem like you can do anything simple’ Draco glared at the smirking teen at that.
“Ill have to apologize for my friends rude behavior” he said, Draco growled from behind him.
The three snakes looked on in utter confusion not believing the two were really here trying to help. Draco opened his mouth a few times, but nothing came out. Blaise had a blank look to his eyes like his brain had shut down. Pansy was the one to finally get something out where the other two had lost their speaking capabilities.
“Ill be honest Dray, I worry maybe that your trying to latch on to the first new face you see to feel better” Draco opened his mouth to cut her off but she held up her hand.
Draco looked on in surprise then the swirls started again
“Pans I feel wrong” he started, staring off into a realm only he could see. She stayed quiet giving Draco his time to come out with it.
He looked up when he felt a hand on his knee and met the eyes of the two Gryffindors who were smiling at him. Blaise and pansy next to them smiling too.
“You didn’t give me much time Boy wonder. You ran off to save the world and then got yourself killed” I felt hot tears running freely down my face.
Today they were going to be working on their first partnered project. They were going to be making Amortentia, Blake looked at Draco and smiled mouthing ‘Your mine’ indicating he was claiming Draco as his partner before Blaise or Pansy could, but that little phrase sent a sense of fire through him, something almost feral. Draco quickly tried to push it down, but it was not wanting to be extinguished. Draco nodded, his face flustered. When he looked over Blakes head he about fell out of his chair in laughter. His two friends looked panicked, but what got his attention was the two Gryffindors that were looking for an exit. Maybe they felt for the two Slytherins more than they let on, they were all about to find out.
They stayed in that position for awhile before they shifted around to get more comfortable. Dracos tears had stopped but he still felt numb. Blake was sitting with his back straight up against the headboard. Draco had slouched down and had his head laying on the others shoulder. Their hands still clasped between them. He might have felt numb but at the same time he felt content, like he was where he needed to be. The sent of wood, treacle tart, and that potion he couldn’t quiet put his finger on, soothing him. He started to drift off to sleep leaning more heavily on the smaller boy.
“Harry tell her! She can’t go, it’s not right!” the red head pleaded from the floor. Harry shook his head again and stepped away from Ron.
‘No bad Draco’
“Mr. Malfoy you will stay out of that room, as I’m sure Snape has instructed everyone” was the snippy reply from McGonagall. Pomfrey was behind the head mistress with a sour look on her face.
“And you didn’t think to say anything about your friend coming to Hogwarts at all” Draco asked but really was an accusation. He was a little irritated with his friend, big news like this should be shared.
“We can’t wait I’m taking him to the hospital wing, you go get Snape” Draco snapped then picked the boy up bridal style and ran out of the room. Blaise did not have time to argue because the blond was already gone. He had to get to snape quickly before anything dyer happened.
“Its Black to you Weasley. There’s nothing to discuss now leave, you have no reason to try and force your way into a ladies room. If you wont leave then I will make you” Harry said in a deadly tone. Hermione stood back she knew when he used that voice not to interfere.
Blake frowned and grasped Dracos hand in his and looked at him with sad eyes. He then stood up and removed his black and green robe and tossed it on top of his trunk, then leaned forward and bent slightly to unbutton the buttons on Dracos and started to push it down then pulled it off tossing it to land on top of his. Blake then climbed up the bed and leaned against the headboard, he beckoned to Draco to join him. Draco was hesitant but slipped his leather dress shoes off and slid up beside Blake leaning against the headboard too. The smaller boy took Dracos hand in his and they sat silently for awhile before Blake spoke up.
------------
“What about you Harry were you a perfect gentleman” he asked a grin breaking out as Harry started to stutter.
‘Alright. Who do you live with’ Blakes face lit up when he saw Draco had agreed.
Blaise looked up to McGonagall and her back to him with the same expression of worry. Of course, anything concerning the boy currently in the isolation room was never easy. They got Draco to a bed and laid down and allowed Madam Pomfrey to tend to him, as Blaise and the head mistress waited for Snape to return.
‘Well’ the Italian mouthed to him. The blond sighed and stepped forward pulling at the cufflink of his sleeve.
“Yes it is, there was no other rooms for me to have my own, but Blaise said I could stay with him.” He didn’t know why but something bubbled in him at that, he didn’t like it.
“That’s brilliant Granger” Pansy squealed “Its romantic in a way, you’ll get to know one another better by talking then when the day finally comes you can be together”
Draco leaned more heavily against Blakes shoulder still staring at the wall. He let the words sink in and realized both his mother and Blake were right. But he was scared he was hurt and he didn’t want to be hurt again he couldn’t take his heart being ripped out again. He sighed when he felt a hand run through his hair and massage his scalp. This felt right, sitting here in the silence with Blake, it felt like home.
“That is all we will ask, and we are willing to do anything to get him back to you. That’s why we’re here if there’s one thing we’re good at its sneaking around and figuring out a crisis” Hermione finished with a laugh. Ron just grumbled an agreement behind her.
“Excuse me” the blond said with furrowed brows.
“Oh Blaise you don’t have to ask Harry ill dance with you” she said but Blaise stopped her.
“Save it Draco YOU should know better. Im going to bed good night” was his parting statement as he left following Blakes path.
It never came Blaise looked over to Draco, he jumped up and quickly round the bed and took Draco into his arms and hugged him, slightly rocking back and forth. The heart break in the boy’s eyes along with the tears sliding down his face was Blaise’s undoing with this whole situation, oath be damned! Blake thought he was protecting himself, Draco, and others by doing what he was doing but he wasn’t. He was harming himself and Draco the two people who mattered in this whole scenario. And he wouldn’t be any kind of friend if he let it continue, he was going to end this and as soon as possible. Blaise pulled back and shook Draco hard enough to get him to look up.
“That’s for making us deal with a pissy ass Draco because he didn’t know where you where” Blaise said while flopping down in the armchair but there was another look in his eyes. Like the looks you gave when someone almost told a Gryffindor the password.
“Draco it wasn’t pansy” she paused and looked at Ron for help.
“She is a Black and my sister by all means if anyone technically has any right to tell her what to do its me, and if I wont do that Ill be damned if you will” the raven said stepping closer. The two boys were now nose to nose. Hermione stood behind the two worrying her lip between her teeth. She knew this had been a long time coming but this was not the best place to have it happen.
“ Would it be possible for you two to take your flirting somewhere else?” came a smooth voice.
I’m going to be honest, its been a really long time since I’ve been able to write anything. It’s also probably been even longer since I’ve read the books. I’m writing this to get back into a hobby I use to enjoy and get my bearings about me again. Not only that writing is fun and I’m wanting to have fun with this. Please bear with me if things are off or not completely right. I do plan on this being smutty and for the mature. There is a possibility that there will be characters that are alive that actually died and so on and so forth it really depends on where my mind takes all of this. Please feel free to provide ideas if you have any or constructive criticism. Please no flaming, being rude, or mean just because your bored or for whatever reason. As I said before this is for fun, I want you all to have fun reading it and I want to have just as much fun writing it. I own nothing it belongs to J.K Rowling.
Blaise laughed and Draco just stared back then began eating his bagel. His life was already a crazy mess why not keep going with the crazy at least it’ll keep him busy. One thing the two figured out is the red head had no manners at all. They felt like they needed to put up defensive shields just to protect themselves from the food flying out of Rons mouth as he talked animatedly. But even with that Blaise hung on his every word. Draco smiled to himself happy that his friends were at least happy.
He was stupid he had a one in a million chance and threw it away. He and Blaise had hosted this party for the whole reason of him and the Italian making their moves on the two Gryffindors. Blaise obviously succeeded since he had not come back. But not Draco he had hidden in the shadows and watched the boy of his dreams all night. After Blaises attention had been drawn away from the lioness and he saw Harry had been neglected all night the teen had given him one of the iciest glares he had ever seen. Hermione had saw him as she was walking out and gave him one of her own as well.
“Then I forgive you and you have my trust again, so lets start again” He lifted his chin to rest on Dracos chest with a full blown smile, but it faltered.
All five teens squeezed onto Dracos bed and got settled in for a long night of planning.
Chapter 8
The day had passed quickly after that and soon the four were making their way to the common room after dinner. Blake still hadn’t said anything to Draco but at the same time didn’t completely ignore him. Blaise had spoken to him but not in the same manner he usually would. Guess he really meant the whole them being even when he witnessed the groveling. They made their way through the opening in the wall to the common room. Blake made his way to the couches before Blaise stopped him.
“ Shut up Parkinson! Ladies aren’t supposed to be disgusting” he scolded then looked at the brown haired boy “ No offense though Blake, you are quite fetching but I prefer the red heads”
“You have to get Snape, he’s the only one that can help him” Blaise said quickly fear in his eyes
“I promise to never leave you Draco….” Draco didn’t hear what was said after that because he was already gone, to the realm of sleep.
I hate these soooo much I really do but it was the best way I knew how to let everyone know what has been going on. Unfortunately my computer just died on me, i tried getting it fixed but ended up having to get a new one. Please know I will be continuing my stories Im working on getting my stuff back as of now. I am really sorry for it being so long. I love you all and thank you for you support. When i post the next chapter i will delete this note or add it to the notes to that chapter.
The blond lifted his hand to Blakes waist and pulled him closer to him, still gazing into the duel colored eyes. Blakes hand had stopped petting Dracos hair and now rested on the Blonds neck. They stayed like that for a while, enjoying the others presence. Then Draco brought his other hand up and placed it on Blakes cheek, running his thumb over his bottom lip. Blake closed his eyes and Draco felt the others small shiver. The blond pulled the others face towards him their lips only centimeters apart, then finally pressed forward the rest of the way.
“No there’s no room just come to my room. I have a private chamber so no one will bother you” Draco tried to say as casually as possible even though inside his heart was racing.
“Snape is well versed with Mr. Vipers condition and is the only one to see to him. Now you will calm yourself or I will take precautions”
“Everything ok” Blake asked once he walked in and shut the door.
“But we are not mad, disgusted or anything like that. I mean Harry and I told each other a long time ago about our preferences” the red head said.
“This is for his own protection Mr.Zabini I will not sabotage a students wellbeing and future because they are blinded and not thinking with their head” it was now Blaises turn to have a stare down with the potions professor.
“Blaise, I can’t, if I go near him ill hurt him” the blond choked out.
“It’ll be ok I believe him Blaise, he wont try it again I’m sure” Blake sent a reassuring smile.
“He wasn’t aware of the ‘situation’ and I told him, then he asked a basic question involving ‘partners’. I told him the other was dead” they understood the cryptic message Pansy nodded but had this look saying they would speak later. But Blaises head had whipped towards Blake and had an almost horror-struck look and Blake looked like he hated himself. Draco was getting agitated again and huffed.
“What else is there Blaise you can tell me I won’t say anything I want to help”
“Shut . up” was the smaller boys reply followed by a hard thunk and cussing.
“Well I smell a musk, sandalwood, warmth, and I don’t know but it smells good” Ron went red again as everyone laughed including Draco. He knew what that last smell was it was Blaises imported cologne.
Draco let out a silent sob and wrapped his arms around Blake and held him close as he cried. The other boy held him tighter as he felt more tears falling on his head.
Harry placed his hands on her hips and they began to sway back and forth to the beat of the music both laughing over the fact they obviously had no business being on the dance floor but alcohol made them brave. He doesn’t know how long they spent there but they were enjoying themselves. They swayed to the rhythm, and would spin each other around every so often and laugh. Neither of them noticed the set of brown eyes that stayed trained on them the whole time. Harry felt a tap on his shoulder and stopped mid spin to look over his shoulder. He was met with Blaises smirking face, Harry lifted a questioning eyebrow at him.
“Thank you, Blaise we’ll consider it” she said politely then stepped up and grabbed both boys and drug them towards the Gryffindor common room.
Blake sat for a few minutes and thought on his answer.
“Well its your bed and I’m just crashing here” he said like it was the most obvious thing ever. Draco rolled his eyes at the raven and pulled him to the bed.
“ Well I guess the most obvious question to start with is why Im here now.” All eyes were on him, he flushed and resumed staring at the feet in his lap. “ Well I lost my parents in the first war and was sent to live with family. They kept me hidden most of my life and then was decided it was best I be home schooled until it was safer. So I was locked away up until Voldemort was finally defeated” at the mention of his name all three flinched but it went un noticed by Blake.
Blake whipped his head around to the boy and placed both hands on his side and pushed him off the end of the bench glaring at the boy.
Afternoon found the four friends under a tree near the Lake, it was warm but the chilled wind coming off the lake took away any uncomfortableness. Blake and Draco had their backs to the tree, Pansy and Blaise sat in front of them. They were currently catching Blake up on Blaises obsession, I mean crush, on one Ronald Weasley.
“You didn’t even take me with you when you left” I sobbed and pulled him fully up angst me and I cried as hard as I ever have before.
“Watch it Malfoy, no need to do anything to get punched again” the raven haired boy finished with a smirk of his own.
“Harry for the love of all that is holy! It is just a house party” Hermione said angerly. She had spent the whole day listening to Harry go on and on about the house party the Slytherins were going to be hosting later tonight. This was the first one ever that would be open to the other houses by invitation only of course. Harry had automatically jumped to conclusions. At first it was hilarious listening to him make up excuse after excuse of why they should go. Ranging from ‘They could be planning to poison the drinks with some potion to manipulate the people’ to ‘ They could be trying to recruit people to the dark side’. It was now just after classes and the bushy haired girl was done hearing all of Harrys nonsense, and Ron feeding into it.
“You know instead of making fun of me you could be helping. Especially you Blake, you even promised while you were hear you would” the glare hardened when he looked at the dule eyed boy.
“ I will do better Ill talk to him in person and grovel, Who else knows?”
He had snogged Draco Malfoy last night. He.Had.Snogged.DRACO.MALFOY. last night. Harry couldn’t believe it, he had wanted this for so long, and now that it had happened, he didn’t know what to do. It had been a party and alcohol had been involved. Harry might not have saw the blond during the party but that didn’t mean he hadn’t drank too. What if he woke up and found Harry in his bed thinking Harry was someone else last night? Harrys heart sank, he could not deal with that kind of rejection.
The smaller boy looked like he was arguing with himself but after a few minuets pulled back the cover and slipped in turning on his side to face Draco. The two gazed into each others eyes for a while, Blake brought his hand back up and started petting Dracos hair again. Draco closed his eyes and smiled, yes this was right, this is where he wanted to be.
“Fuck you” was the muffled yell from the bathroom.
Summery
Draco sat back on his bed and propped himself against his headboard then he opened the journal. He had it on the very first page and he stared at it for what seemed like forever. He jumped though when he saw silver swirls start weaving all over the page. Then they stopped and words appeared.
He took a whiff of the steam and his eyes snapped open in surprise. He had to be tricking himself, it wasn’t possible. He got closer and smelled again getting the same response. He looked up at everyone in surprise.
“Fine and Pansy might as well come too. Itll make her day”
“Im getting Madam Pomfrey that’s the end of it!” Draco yelled
Once inside they sat down Pansy, Blaise, and Theo who had joined them talking about any and everything but Draco could tell they were watching what they said carefully as to not touch on anything that could send Draco over the edge. He hated that they were treating him as a child but at the same time he appreciated the gesture. The carriages begin their long trek up to the school and Draco chose to use that time to stare out the window and let images of Harry pass through his head. No matter what he did or how much he slept or how much he drank Harry would not leave his head. His heart ached so damn much anymore, but he figured it was the fates condemning him for all the wrong he had done because if they weren’t trying to torcher him they would have let him die with his mate. They finally made it up to the school and the four friends made their way inside.
“This doesn’t concern you harry its between me and her” Ron ground out through his clenched jaw.
---------
She shook her head and repeated what McGonagall had just announced. “ They are getting ready to sort a new student. Hes 18 and has been home schooled for years but now has decided to attend Hogwarts”
“Well we could always send Pansy after her give her a chance to act on her crush” Draco said. Both Blake and Pansy started choking on air and babbling.
The four continued on working on their assignments late into the evening. Then took a break long enough to go eat dinner then resumed where they left off late into the evening until it was curfew and needed to head to bed. Pansy wished them all a goodnight then veered off to go to the girls dorm side while the other three went up the opposite staircase. They came to Dracos room first and he said good night but did not go in, Blaise looked to Blake but didn’t say anything and kept walking to their room. Blake stopped and looked up to meet Dracos eyes with a small smile.
“Don’t heal them…..please. Let this play out the Weasel deserves it” Blaise asked with pleading eyes. Hermione glanced between the two then lowered her wand.
Draco sat up and ran a hand over his face, and scowled at himself. It was just a dream it meant nothing especially when he had screwed up so royally last night. But his heart sped up thinking of the promises made to him in his dream, and he remembered the one he made. He felt guilty in a way because he was already thinking about not following through, he knew Harry would always be there in his heart and would want him happy and to live his life. It was just so hard to do, especially being so lonely all the time day in and day out. But Blake was there, maybe he should do as dream Harry, and Pansy had said and give not being miserable a try. The smaller brown-haired boy could be a good distraction from the world. Someone new to talk to and didn’t know about his dark past. Didn’t know how horrible of a prat he used to be, and maybe even get a real kiss…. Draco stopped himself before he could finish that thought.
“But Mione! This is dangerous, there will be drinking and all kinds of things. The students won’t be in their right mind. They’ll be susceptible to any dark magic the Snakes could throw at them” Harry said accusingly. Ron was next to him nodding eagerly his mouth full of some snack he had acquired.
Harry looked to the Italian with raised eyebrows and smirked, but that smirk died down when the Italian took on one of his own.
“ And how many times do I have to tell you, you owe me. Should have you rubbing my damn feet” he said with a smirk. Blake glared at the Italian but didn’t say anything more when Blaise returned his feet to his lap.
Since Snape didn’t want a bunch of eighteen year olds running around stupid on love potion they were to test it on mice to see the affects and write about them. Blaise and Ron went and got their mice and brought them back, then they all gave them some of the potion. It only took a few minuets to get the information they needed then returned the mice. Now it was time to write about what they each smelled.
Everyone looked confused they did not think Draco would smell anything. Blake and Blaise were staring at each other with a worried look on their faces but turned back to Draco who was still astonished. Instead of commenting they all wrote down what they smelt and cleaned up. Snape walked over and collected their papers but frowned when he glanced at Dracos seeing what the boy smelt. The group gathered their things and headed out to go to their next classes and said they would see each other at lunch.
One of the doors to the great hall slowly opened and in walked a boy about 5’7 or 5’8. He had Medium chestnut brown hair, that was cut short almost buzzed on the sides and the top was longer and looked like the boy had tried to use his fingers to sweep it off to the side. Actually Draco knows that’s what he did because said boy just ran his fingers through his hair in that sweeping motion out of nervousness. His face was slim with prominent cheek bones and a chin, almost like his but had more of a boxyness to it. As Draco was taking in his appearance the boy looked his direction their eyes making contact and Draco felt his heart twinge. The boy had green eyes, no correction, the boy had a green eye that reminded him of those emeralds that haunted his dreams, the other eye was a dull blue. But what danced in those eyes was what scared Draco. He only ever knew one person who had that kind of passion dancing in his eyes and that person has been gone for months.
“But I also know you don’t let just anyone in, I wonder if it’s your instincts. I have a lot of questions with no answers, and Im always going to worry but I do know one thing for sure” she stopped walking and so did Draco. She looked him dead in the eyes she knew this would hurt but knew he needed to hear it, knew it might help.
Well what do you all think feel free to let me know. Ill try and reply to everyone as I can.
Draco had his fangs bared and his eyes were blown wide and black. Snape stopped and sneered at the Blond.
------------
He had finally made it to the Gryffindor common room after stumbling around with a headache and nausea for about fifteen minutes. He needed a hangover potion bad and he knew who would have one handy. He started making his way up to Hemiones room when he heard a shout coming from the top floor where her room was, he picked up his pace and as he got closer, he could make out Ron yelling. When he made it to the last step, he was met with his sister standing in front of the door red in the face and eyes glistening with unshed tears. Ron was red from his hair down to his neck and he was screaming.
Chapter 9
Hope you all are still enjoying, at this point I'm letting the story do as it pleases and continuing to have fun with it. As always feel free to let me know your ideas.
“I dont have a death wish” with that he stood up and held out his hand to Draco to help him up. The blond took it and Blake pulled him up with ease.
‘I love my mother she’s my rock, has always been there through the good and bad and did her all to protect me. My father is my father I love the him he use to be, maybe one day hell be that father again. Have you ever had a girl friend?’
“Oh Draco, none of us have even checked to see how you were holding up with this project” he jerked his head over to Hermione in surprise, then looked accusingly to Pansy.
“Well looks like our plan just fell in our lap” Blake said with a laugh. The three others just staring at him as they made their way over to a far table and started pulling there work out. Blake looked at the confused teens then laughed again.
“Comfortable Harry” he whispered making sure his breath ghosted over the others lips. He felt the boys body shutter. His smile grew as he leaned a little closer.
Wanting to explain, Harry begins to talk. “I hoped taking these past three weeks would help me get my life back on track.”
“Alright there, Charlie?” Harry asks.
“Merry Christmas, Draco.”
"Yes. Yes. They're the Canadians in the television."
(See the end of the chapter for
Rocking on his heels, Harry feels shy all of a sudden. Cecilia steps closer still, holding his face with her long fingers tipped with red polish.  “You think he hates you?”
“He did!” Teddy wheezes while Charlie nods emphatically next to him.
Cecilia shakes her head. “You misunderstand me.” She steps closer, maintaining eye contact. “You are special to Draco.”
“I don’t—”
Harry abruptly stomps his foot and growls, “Fine!”
“Stop it.”
Harry feels a nip against his neck and arches off the bed. Draco shifts to sit astride him, long pale limbs weighing Harry into the warm sheets, the space between their bodies slowly disappearing as Draco lowers himself down, down . . . down.
Harry shrugs, feeling wrong-footed all of a sudden. He transfigures his fresh glass to water and he takes a large gulp before scanning the crowd for a pink head of hair. Beside him, Cecilia puts two fingers in her mouth and whistles, loud and clear. Cameron’s elaborate, bird-fluttering hairdo comes into view at the call and he jumps and waves, spotting them in the crowd. Together, they sneak off to a secluded spot near the Campanile to watch the
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know, Draco. People come here for all kinds of reasons. Escape, adventure, curiosity—”
See y'all Monday!
Harry and Neville slump down on the floor behind the wide mahogany front desk of their shop, entirely sauced. It’s been a triumphant opening day, the celebrations having lasted long into the evening.
“How’d you meet Cecilia?”
Nico coos at Harry softly in her deep-voiced ennui as the vinyl spins, pulling him unwittingly back in time to when he was a broken little boy wanting nothing else than to be hugged by a man he barely knew, and thanks to the trappings of Fate, would never get a chance to fully know.
“Fuck!” He presses a hand against his throat, applying pressure. There’s blood. So much fucking blood. “Draco, what the fuck?” He shouts.
“You’ve seen men down there?”
Finally, Draco releases him, his cock sliding freely out of his mouth with a depraved sound that Draco savours as he catches his breath. He looks up at Harry, throat raw, eyes wet, and smiles. Harry laughs, shaking his head.
“I know that, you pillock.”
. . .
Draco’s shoulders spike, the embarrassment of his cowardice washing over him again. Yes, everyone fights, but not everyone Apparates away from such things and doesn’t come back for days on end. Draco hasn’t been back to Grimmauld Place in a week. He’d fled first to France to his mother and then, when the endless supply of macarons, the crushing weight of familial expectation and champagne got to be too overwhelming for his tastes, he ran to Fleur. She’s been an ally and friend since the days of fourth-year when speaking to the Beauxbaton students in their native French was his only reprieve from the horrors of puberty and his sexual awakening at the sight of Harry besting a dragon on the back of a broom.
Draco looks at him, holding Harry with his stern grey gaze as Harry comes to lean next to him on the railing. “I like it,” Harry repeats.
“I’m sorry, Scorpius, I’m fine. Look, I’m breathing and everything. Plus, my head is literally in a fire, so it’s not as if I’ll catch a chill.”
“Proost!” Harry retorts.
Draco quirks an eyebrow.
“Fuck,” Harry gasps, the knowledge that Draco wants him that way hits home like a gut punch for the second time in as many days. The pink-haired man the other night had been Draco, after all, and his confessions compound themselves twofold in the harsh light of day. Draco has wanted him since their youth, and the idea that he’s fantasised over having Harry like this, here, on this bridge, in Draco’s adopted city, so far from their history and their past hatred, has Harry moaning at the intensity of it all, so near the brink his entire body shivers. His hands desperately grip at the iron railing to both keep from pulling at Draco’s hair and to remain standing.
“Who?”
Shaking himself, Harry wastes no time in throwing on Sirius' old leather jacket hanging on a peg nearby and seating himself in front of Draco on the bike. He turns over the key and kicks the engine to life. The sound reverberates off the crumbling brick walls of the shed, filling their ears with the purr of the machine.
Rocking on his heels the guard gave him a mischievous wink before walking over to the painting Draco had touched earlier in the day. He took out a crisp, white handkerchief and tenderly cleaned the dust off its gilded edge. “I’m pretty sure you two have already worked out that particular puzzle on your own.”
Cecilia is waiting for him back at their private cabana, holding out a glass of sparkling wine with a look of contrition on her face.
Taken aback, Draco scoffs. “Rude.”
Hermione and Luna break apart, eyes darting all around them, frantic and panicked.
Draco slumps his shoulders in the fire, feeling wrung out and utterly deflated.
“Charlie, shit, I didn’t—”
Harry’s still quiet and contemplative by the time they reach the stream. He looks past the water, into the middle distance. “Is it wrong to have a full life yet still be unhappy?”
“He was in so much pain—”
“I’ve wanted to do this for so long, Harry,” Draco whispers against his overheated skin, fingers trailing along the elastic of Harry’s pants, inching them ever lower down his hips. “I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve pictured you beneath me on this bridge, or you holding me against this railing with your mouth at my hole, fucking me with your tongue.” He punctuates this final expression of filth with a lick to the tip of Harry’s cock through the now soaked cotton of his pants.
“Perhaps some time out of the house will be good for us, huh?”
Harry’s concern didn’t waver, but the fact that Malfoy was regaining some control of whatever had upset him was something of a consolation. Harry took a step back, his hands finding the wall behind him and slid down to the cold marble once more, his eyes never leaving the rigid cut of Malfoy’s jaw as he forced himself into stillness.
“We still felt his pain,” Luna tells her. Harry grunts in agreement, though still having no idea who they’re talking about and why he’s in pain.
Feeling a sudden tug, Harry breaks the kiss and curses as he’s swept from the stone tiles of the balcony and lifted into the air. Draco’s flying, floating them down over the railing towards the rocks of the jetty.
“I’m afraid I don’t.”
“I haven’t shunned anything!” Harry says, stepping towards the man. How dare he make assumptions. Draco shoved him, not the other way around.
“Take it,” he tells Max, and Max does.
The pastries, Draco means. Harry closes his eyes and pictures the custard bursting out the side as Draco bites into its soft dough with sharp white teeth, the sugar crystals coating his lips and the cream making a mess of his chin.
“Oh, thank Merlin.” Draco nods. “Yes.” He flicks his wrist at the door behind him, closing it wandlessly and moves with his son towards the kitchen and the small drinks cart under the window by the dining table.
“Not yet. Kiss me more.” Draco’s greedy with it, never leaving Harry’s mouth for more than the moment it takes him to breathe in some much-needed oxygen. He kisses Harry with a desperation Harry understands only too well, though the depth of it still sits uneasily on his shoulders. Has this always been simmering under the surface when it came to the two of them? This want to get under each other's skin is not new, but the variation and
“Whoa.”
“You didn’t have to watch it happen,” Hermione says, whispering into Luna’s hair.
“Erm. Draco is,” he says, and they all look at him, still hiding behind Harry.
Eyes flashing, Harry grins, placing both hands on either side of Draco’s head and pulling him up. “Come here.”
“Anyone hungry?” Luna speaks up, interrupting their silent exchange. She swirls her wand in front of her, causing multicoloured bubbles to erupt from the tip.
Neville snorts. “Too right.” He raises his champagne flute, missing Harry’s glass completely as he tries to cheers him. “Salute!” he calls, nevertheless.
“What?” Harry blinks through the haze.
Shaking his head, Max stares bewildered at his neatly cut slice of lamb. “But it’s not. It’s fucking delicious.”
Hermione takes in the abrupt stillness of the place that had been like a live wire since they’d first set foot inside the fabric of the ruins all those hours ago, then back to Harry and Draco. They’re huddled on the floor in an awkward half-embrace, Harry’s hands having stilled on Draco’s arms, their bodies arched toward each other like two half-moons on the precipice of becoming whole.
He thrusts back once, twice, and a third time, pounding the mattress with his fist as his entire body is wracked with his orgasm.
Swallowing hard, Harry stares back at Draco’s unnaturally darkened eyes, taking in the truth of that statement and the unquestioning vulnerability Draco has just laid out before him. Harry reaches for the first thought that comes to him and says, “You’ve already atoned for your sins, Draco. Many times over.”
“I think you are, Harry.” Luna adds, watching a pebble bounce violently off the ground with growing concern. “Hermione’s right.”
” she calls over her shoulder. “I think we all need a drink.”
and one severely abridged recounting of their Hogwarts years later, Cecilia is cackling on the loveseat, squeezing Cameron’s knee with uninhibited joy.
(See the end of the chapter for
She’d easily ignored the naysayers. Plenty of families with French ancestry had links to Veela blood, and plenty of families never fell into the madness that sometimes overtook the bird-like creatures. Rumours of mental instability were passed down along with rumours of the extreme power such a heritage could yield. And when her boy was born, fair and blond and just as beautiful as his father, with the same silver eyes and cornsilk hair, she cried with joy over her fortune. Two perfect men, devoted to her and to each other. A family of the highest esteem with an ancient magical ancestry boasting beauty, grace, and a fierce loyalty to round out the picture.
The silence between them grows and every time Harry turns, he catches sight of Draco, posed with a casual grace with the wild waves of Crete crashing behind him. It’s unnerving—knowing he’s here, alive and breathing, within arm’s reach. The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck haven’t settled, his mind whirling a mile a minute as he contemplates what the hell happened to Draco to land him in such a prison, especially by the hands of his own mother, a woman who Harry knows from first-hand experience loves Draco more than the world itself. He can’t bring himself to believe she’d be capable of such a thing.
Draco’s at a loss for how quickly this conversation is going. He takes a pull of his own drink, swallows and starts again. “Of course, he remembers me. You’ve all been to school—”
“And we’ll continue to search for a cure.”
“It’s not his fault.”
“What else?” Hermione says with a shrug.
Harry snorts out a laugh.
“Shit, shit, shit,” Draco continues repeating as he thrashes through the air with his wand, sending the door flying open before them as they dash inside, the footfalls of the police officers increasing their pace behind them.
Shutting his eyes tight he whispers, “never.”
More neat piles line up beside the first, along with a small collection of mosaic tile that Xenophilius explains would be lovely in the guest bath at the Manor. Luna turns to Harry with raised eyebrows, only to see a mirrored look of surprise on his own face.
The evening has descended into the decadent kind of chaos that any good wizarding marriage should aspire to once the stores of elf wine have been exhausted and the elders have bid their leave. Hogwarts and Beauxbaton graduates circle around them, along with weaving bobs of blond and ginger heads in varying states of drunk and disorderly. Broad smiling faces and roaming hands abound, clinking champagne flutes and kissing too-pink cheeks flushed from the press of bodies and the joy of celebration.
“Where’s Hermione?”
Scorpius doesn’t even blink at the sight of his father’s anger. He’s more Veela than Draco and Gabrielle ever were and he wears that knowledge like a suit of the finest elf-made armour, fiercely and with a confidence that Draco has never been able to possess.
They land hard in a dark valley. Harry looks up, thankful for the full moon as his eyes adjust to the sudden absence of light. He blinks rapidly, regretting that he wasn’t wearing shoes when Luna oh-so forcefully transported him across the island without his consent.
“Draco, I just. . . you’re too important to—”
“The fuck?” Draco spits. He is wearing Japanese silk. One does not simply manhandle Japanese silk.
“You’re lying,” he says.
Grinning up at him, Harry wraps a hand gently around Draco’s leg and squeezes. “I was close too.” Draco softens for a moment before Harry adds, “I’m surprised I didn’t shoot my load from the shock of it, actually.”
“Unexpected,” Luna finishes.
Harry echoes back. Even in his mind, he sounds helpless and needy, the little slag. Draco’s body sings at the supplication and what it means for the two of them. Everything else falls away in Draco’s lust-filled, animal-driven mind. The man who sends Harry letters, the screaming chasm of lost time that yawns wide and black before them, Hermione’s disagreeable frown: none of it matters anymore. Harry was his that night in the pub, he’s his now, he’ll be his tomorrow. Always. Draco shifts his hips, thrusting his point and Harry presses back, a heady confirmation.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry didn’t hear anything come from Draco, and yet he managed to communicate with his mother. He curses once more as he sets the repaired teapot to rights on the tray, pretending that whatever connection he and Draco share not being wholly unique doesn’t cut him to the quick.
Hidden behind the concealment of his sunglasses, Draco continues to observe Potter as his chest rises and falls with his breath, following the movement down to the flat of his abdomen, where a trail of dark, coarse hair disappears behind the waistband of his trunks. There’s a swell of a bulge there, something promising and thick hidden away from Draco’s view. He licks his lips and looks up, taking in the fall of Potter’s chaotic mane draped inelegantly over the back of his chair, his fingers itching to comb through the curls.  Draco shifts in his seat, feeling uneasy in his own skin. He pulls a flap of his robe across his pelvis, covering it from view.
“Well, then. Feel free to ignore my
“Open up,” Harry instructs, moving over him, wishing he could simply vanish Max’s clothes. He places his knees carefully on either side of Max’s ribs, allowing him to shift and make room, before settling his ass on his chest. Gently, Harry gathers up a pile of Max’s brown curls in his fist and tips his head forward, aligning the bottle with his lips. “I want you to taste lemons as you suck me.”
“Cornswallow silk tea. It has healing properties.” She runs a finger down her face, mirroring the line of Draco’s scar. “It’ll help. I’ve added plenty of honey,” she tells Draco, her voice soft, almost pleading.
“Right.” Ron plops down with the bag of chips. He pulls out one of Molly’s silver serving platters from his oversized Chesterfield coat, shines it with the edge of his sleeve, then dumps the chips out onto it with a flourish.
Biting her lip, she considers for the hundredth time if it’s her place to tell Draco such things—to meddle at all. She knows what his behaviour means. She can read him easily, as could anyone. His head is slumped between his shoulder blades, wings lax and trailing on the wet rocks behind him, tinged a steely green from the algae of the jetty. Every few minutes, the sharply defined muscles of his back contort with the movement of his wings, rising and falling, as he breathes in a deep sigh.
Their collective breathing in the ensuing silence comes like a rushing tide crashing against the cliffs to Harry’s ears and he turns away from Draco, moving to hoist himself out of the water. Draco’s there before he can even get a hand on the flat surface of the basin, forcing him back into the water. He pushes him hard against the dip of rock Harry had been using as a seat, crowding him with the press of both his body and his magic. Harry glares at the presence of it, nostrils flaring at the assault it havocs on his senses—crackling energy and wet heat, choking steam, slicked skin, and anger. They’ve always been like this, since they were children, possessing this split-second ability to go from civility to overwhelming rage, a curse the two of them have carried collectively with them throughout life. Experiencing it now, so raw and visceral and real, right in front of him for the first time in decades, Harry’s heart kicks in his chest, adrenaline pooling like bitter fire in the back of his throat.
The ruins are hidden from Muggle view, but the magic that lingers within supposedly keeps the climate at a perfect temperature year-round, ensuring that the surrounding animals and flora never fall ill or meet an untimely end. The wild theories Luna spun of the soil holding magical properties that could perhaps help heal were the only reason Hermione agreed to visit in the first place.
“Careful,” Hermione whispers, cautious as ever.
, is a regular pastime of yours?”
“And that’s what matters,” Hermione adds, leaning up on tiptoe to kiss him. Ron winks at her and pats her on the bum as she heads out of the room to get ready for bed. It doesn’t escape Harry’s notice that Ron watches her go, eyes fixed firmly on her backside with a hunger Harry prefers not to see on his best friend’s face in regards to any part of his other best friend’s person.
“Yes,” Malfoy said.
The sound of the water turning back on was not what she expected. She releases a frustrated sigh and turns to the kitchen. She deserves a glass of wine, goddammit.
Thanks, as always, for reading. Comments are <3
On the third day of waking, making tea, sipping tea, and reluctantly following Teddy out to the rocky grounds beyond the cottage, Draco finally snaps and asks about their omnipresent brooms.
“Mrs Malf—”
Minutes passed. Neither of them spoke.
“I mean you don’t owe me kindness. No one does. Quit acting as if this is normal. You don’t have to lie to me.”
“So much for Harry cooking for us.”
A moment passes, then two, three. . . they stand there, breathing each other in, suspended on a precipice.
“I was just inviting Harry and Neville to mine.”
“Draco,” Cameron says some five minutes later, sounding distracted as he stares at his camera lens.
in question turns to see Harry standing behind him.
“I’ll talk to him, Draco. We’ll make it work.”
“It’s okay, Harry. We’ll work through it.”
“I beg to differ, my boy. The scars on her arms from his talons prove the exact opposite.”
“Nice day.”
“Teach me to play pool,” she repeats, nudging his side, needing to distract him from such dark thoughts. She and Harry know better than most that you can’t bring back the dead once they’re gone, no matter how much you’re willing to sacrifice for such power.
Mouth pulling at a reluctant smile, Harry says, “Gods, you’re stubborn,” as he sits back in his chair.
“Fuck!” he says again, wiping his eyes. Luna quietly casts a Scourgify and Harry feels the dust disappear from his face. He grins at her in thanks.
Raising an eyebrow, Harry props up on one elbow. “Yes?”
So, I'll see y'all on Sunday for my next update!
Draco makes a study of him, head tilted to the side in casual repose. “We’ve plans tomorrow.”
, he hears in his mind.
Draco glares at her. “I will end you,” he hisses before sucking on the straw of her cocktail with a vengeance.
Harry stands and steps towards Draco, ignoring Hermione’s protests not to move as blood drips from his fingertips. It stains Draco’s feathers as Harry shoves aside his wing, revealing his maskless face to Harry for the first time. Draco looks up, eyes wide and filled with tears.
“He must! He must!”
“No, of course.” Draco turns back to the table and fills another cup with the Oolong Hermione had provided him with not five minutes prior before she’d made a hasty exit to one of the outbuildings that she uses as an office when in residence.
“What good is clever magic if it can’t heal him?” She tugs on her sleeve, itchy in her own skin. “I  feel useless,” Narcissa admits, bringing her arms up tight across her middle as if she could keep herself together by sheer force of will. She bows at the waist, overcome. She’s so tired.
“I’m an old man, Granger. Out with it.”
The water rippling against the basin echoes around them, licking at their exposed skin. Harry refuses to draw breath, his lungs burning until finally, his mind screaming for oxygen and his body reacting to Draco’s presence, his patience snaps and he exhales, harsh and hurting. Draco, losing a battle all his own, sinks down lower, coming to sit fully atop Harry’s thighs. Harry’s eyes prickle at the corners and he blinks away the sting, the relief of skin finally meeting skin like a gut punch to his senses.
“Brilliant! My child is brilliant.” He twirls on the spot, his buttercup yellow robes billowing in the wind. There are blue stains dotted all along his front. Luna wonders what concoction he’s been brewing.
Charlie’s full lips thin as he presses down a smile. Draco feels lightheaded.
Harry’s shaking his head, mind spinning.
Laughing, Harry offers to help but Cecilia waves him off, and instead, holds him with her brown-eyed gaze. Harry feels caught by it, and unexpectedly, uneasy.
She knew something was amiss with that bite mark. “You’re experiencing his symptoms, aren’t you?”
Harry wakes to a knocking at the front door. He rises from his tangled sheets, darkened with a telling stain that speaks to the vivid dreams he’s been plagued with since Draco’s arrival. Rubbing a hand through his over-long hair, he looks around, blurry-eyed for his glasses and Sirius’ pocket watch. It reads 8:40 AM and Harry shrugs, figuring he can’t be mad at whoever is at the door if it’s solidly past eight in the morning. That’s just the harsh reality of adulthood. He Scourgifies the sheets and climbs out of bed.
I can’t believe you were watching us!”
Before Charlie can respond, Harry turns, stalking to the bike, mounting it, shoving back the kickstand, and peeling out of the barn without a second glance, leaving Charlie and his too-keen knowledge of how Harry’s mind works in the literal dust.
Harry turns, making sure Draco is still standing nearby. The moon, freshly risen, hangs low in the sky, sending a cascading shimmer of silver light across the water. Harry can’t help but compare the glow of the water’s sheen to the colour of Draco’s hair, which so closely matches the shade of his wings. His fingers twitch at his sides, wanting to feel the shiver of Draco’s feathers under his touch once more. The thought startles him and Harry clears his throat, running his hand through his own hair instead.
“Liar,” Harry says, pressing Draco’s arm further against his back. Draco arches in response, seeking relief.
“He can’t harm himself here. He can’t harm others. He’s the safest he’ll ever be,” she tells them.
"Says the man in Muggle designer jeans."
Draco scowls at his son. “You know, I don’t like this. Come here.”
The question goes unanswered as Hermione gracefully mounts her steed. Draco doesn’t know if she didn’t hear him or simply chose to ignore him. He finds himself unsettled by both theories.
“What did you have planned?” Hermione asks, instantly more alert.
Harry tries for a shrug but Charlie steps closer, face stern. “Don’t even try to feign ignorance, mate, I know you too damn well.”
“Shut. Up,” Potter breathes, forehead pressed against Draco’s own, sweat mingling, hair tangling together. Cameron says something about it blocking their faces, but Draco is too overwhelmed to care.
“It’s for your own good, Harry!” Neville replies. “You’re moping.”
“My love,” Xenophilius says, coming to his knees before her. “You’ve been crying.” He brushes a thumb over her cheek.
“Cheers.” Draco toasts the air and finishes off his whiskey, enjoying the rich, dark notes of oak and smoke on his tongue. The momentary reprieve is short-lived, however, because he can’t shake the feeling of unease Hermione’s presence has unearthed. He adores her, of course, but an afternoon passed in her company has never left anyone feeling relaxed.
“Then take him to
“What’s happened?”
“Father,” Luna chides just as Draco’s wing’s puff out in agitated warning.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bemused, Draco accepts the cone. “
“Oh god.” Harry lets his head fall back onto the pillows, already spent from earlier in the morning yet forever hungry for the feeling of Draco hot and impossibly tight around him.
Draco’s eyes flash with amusement. He pops another button. “Did you want to be that couple on the bridge, Harry?”
“Nah, you’re not.”
“It’s easy.” Harry shrugs, but neglects to show Malfoy how; the tenuous truce they’ve managed to broker leaves Harry feeling uneasy in his own skin—like an itch pestering him that he can’t quite reach.
“Oh.” Harry looks down, figuring that Malfoy must have left England as soon as the dust had settled after the war. After the trials, his father’s alleged suicide in prison, and his mother’s flight to gods knew where, Harry can’t find it in himself to blame Malfoy for leaving everything behind. He would have done the same. Sometimes, he even wishes he still could.
Hermione looks alarmed.
“What is that?”
“Enough!”
He steps closer still, bumping Charlie with his chest. “I want him to remember it.”
“Fuck, indeed,” Hermione agrees, looking up at the mess of the temple.
“Not wanting to hinder their plans,” Xenophilius boisterously continues. “I instead threw myself into action! Lo and behold,” he holds out the bundle to Hermione, whose eyes widen at the sight.
“Harry owns this land.”
“Fleur warned me of this,” Scorpius says, but Draco is barely listening, he needs to feel the warmth of that light again. Seeks it, reaches out… but it’s not Gabrielle’s hand who clasps hold of his own.
Harry can’t argue, he’s too lost to the sensation of the cool rock at his back, the soft rain of the crashing waves, and the intense heat of Draco surrounding him, teasing him fully erect and cresting on that knife’s edge within moments of touching him.
self, if that suits you.”
I love Luna.
Harry and Hermione exchange a look over Luna’s shoulder, wondering if they heard her correctly.
His response to seeing Draco Malfoy for the first time in close to five years was not unexpected. Hermione had considered the very probable scenario in which Harry would simply walk right out the door from the shock of it all, but she hadn’t predicted this particularly violent reaction. Harry was physically hurt, seeing Draco this way. Hermione hurt too, as did Luna. To see someone they’d all thought long dead now alive and imprisoned like this was not something one could easily digest. It was barbaric, and Hermione wholeheartedly agreed that they absolutely could not leave Draco Malfoy here for one more hour, let alone a condemned lifetime. Yet, seeing Harry react so intensely to the sight of him, so much more pained, as if he too had been wronged in some way, sparked a curiosity that ignited a fire inside Hermione’s mind.
“Call me Harry,” he tells him. “And I like knowing you’ve carried a torch for me all this time. Feel free to keep the watch, by the way.”
“I try.” Harry turns his head, shouting out into the garden. “Teddy, pack it in, kiddo! Dinner time.”
To Draco’s astonishment, Hermione actually looks guilty at Charlie’s words. He raises an eyebrow at this turn of events, intrigued.
Harry jerks in his grip, furious, water sluicing between them. “Fuck you. You left!”
“I’ll make it so good,” Luna tells her, pressing between Hermione’s thighs. Hermione’s breath hitches at the contact and Luna smiles against her neck, trailing magic vibrations from her fingertips, coaxing and relentless until Hermione cries out.
“What? Oh.” Distractedly, Harry thumps down into a chair and spells his boots and the floor clean. The air around them changes as he turns his attention to Draco. It’s unsettling.
Draco looks up at him, his face the picture of remorse and suddenly, Harry knows the night will no longer go the way he’d hoped. Draco steps back, his hand moving from Harry’s hair to his face, his thumb rubbing across his cheek.
“Over here!” Luna calls, her blonde head poking out from a rocky outcropping near the cliff’s edge like a morning dove appearing from its nest.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco says, turning his head away. Reaching out, Harry tucks a strand of silver hair behind Draco’s ear, marvelling at the softness, and trails a finger down the side of his neck as a gentle experiment. Draco visibly shivers yet doesn’t shy from the touch and Harry’s heart kicks in his chest.
“Common sense.”
Harry didn’t press. He’d gleaned more about Malfoy’s life post-Hogwarts in the last five minutes than he had the last five years, and felt too full with the knowledge to take in more. Despite it all, he found Malfoy’s chosen path of study rather . . . charming. He smirked and turned back to the paintings. He was feeling better now that he was standing, his headache gone, and his mind otherwise occupied from their precarious situation. Which was precisely when his hand started to throb at his side, rudely reminding him of all that had happened within the past hour. He doubled over in pain, his left hand holding tight to his opposite wrist as if to staunch the onslaught.
“Not great. Not bad, either.”
“My touch?”
Harry explains. “I was obsessed with you, Draco.” The words feel right in his mouth as he confesses, the burden of his poorly-hidden secret coming out easily in this time and place. “Hermione was the first to say that word to me back then. I hated that she’d said it. Hated that she knew me so well.”
. . .
Draco thinks, holding Harry close to him, the scent of his adrenaline and anger tainting the air around them like an acrid smoke Draco is desperate to inhale. He breathes in deeply, wanting the toxic burn in his lungs to obscure the tantalizing smell of Xenophilius’ experimental potions wafting off his robes and drifting towards him on the sea breeze. Draco has learned to hate the smell of those potions and tonics, no matter how alluring they might be. They remind him of an uncertain time when his mind was divided between sanity and the animal that now consumes him so completely—together they exist within one flesh, bird and human.
Harry’s hands ball into fists at his sides. He feels it the moment Draco presses a hand against his own throat, the spot mirroring the bite mark he’d left on Harry so few days ago, claiming him. An unnecessary animalistic instinct on Draco’s part; Harry has always been his.
“He cares about her,” Hermione says, shocked at her own realisation.
“Yes,” Harry spits, then looks back over his shoulder, remorseful. “Sorry.”
“I always have been.”
Draco reminds himself that she promised to bring lots of wine, and settles in for the long haul. Just as they reach the open water of the lagoon, however, his patience is tested.
Luna nods against the soft curls of Hermione’s hair. “I did.”
Despite Hermione and Ron’s offers to accompany him, he heads off at half past one on Tuesday afternoon with a laugh and a wave, ignoring their generous but unneeded backup. He defeated Voldemort at seventeen, he can handle an over-eager art student with a body art fixation.
Still smiling, Harry shakes his head. “Nope.”
She turns to leave, but then Draco is there, an inky hand on her shoulder, holding her in place. Narcissa is bent in on herself like the curl of a parenthesis lingering at the end of a sentence without proper purpose, while Draco is as prickled as an exclamation point at her side, his wings adding emphasis to their visual grammar.
“No. I want to know what happened.”
Cameron tells Harry about his two “dreadful but darling” housemates, gesticulating wildly the entire time as they ascend a Turkish spiral stairwell that Harry isn’t entirely sure can hold their combined weight. He looks out the open archways to the interior courtyard beneath and feels a sense of nostalgia for a world he’s never known. The sensation leaves him uneasy as he reaches the top step.
“Hey, it won’t be that bad,” Potter chides, rocking on the balls of his feet. He looks awkward, boyish and annoyingly handsome. Draco hates him.
Draco looks to Harry then, his eyes a severe crease of anger. “Why so defensive, Potter? Is it because I’m the only one man enough to tell you what a selfish coward you’ve been all these years?”
“Of course, more Weasleys,” he mumbles as he moves forward, his Thestral steed keeping step just beside him.
Draco’s head falls back on a moan.
Tears slip down her cheeks as she holds them both in her frail hands. Once strong enough to bring grown men to their knees and delicate enough to guide Draco through his beautiful childhood into tumultuous adolescence—these hands that have seen and done so much, now tremble without warning, ache when it rains and curl in on themselves in arthritic pain. She despises how weak she’s become in the past few years, yet seeing Draco so calm and lucid before her, leaves her breathless with an unspoken joy. A hand touches her cheek, flushed with the heat of her tears. Draco’s wiping away the wetness on her skin with the soft black pad of his thumb, his sharp nails held purposefully out of the way. With her heart breaking apart in her chest, she raises her chin and leans into his hand, swallowing her emotions in favour of accepting her son’s gentle touch. In that moment, her floundering strength seems tangible once more.
That night, Harry can’t sleep. He can barely breathe from the heat of his room and the humidity hanging heavy in the air. It feels like it did the first night Draco arrived, with his fever-slicked skin and his blurry, lust-filled brain. On instinct, Harry brings a hand up to his throat and presses against the bite mark on his skin, hissing as his body arches off the bed at the sensation.
“But you’re so beautiful,” she compliments, cupping his cheek in her palm. Draco leans into the touch eagerly. “Please come, if only to let me grossly objectify you in your tiny little swim trunks. I’ll pack at least three bottles of
“I shouldn’t have shown him that letter.” Hermione drops her head into her hands, tears of exhaustion spilling from the corners of her eyes. “I tried to explain to Draco afterwards. I just don’t know if he fully listened.”
“I’m pretty sure your son didn’t send you here for
“A placebo effect,” he nods, putting a hand to her shoulder. “I am certain of it. The novelty of being amongst friends once more. It is only a balm placed upon an open wound, I’m afraid. He needs the potion. I shall send more soon.”
“I think I wanted him for myself,” Harry explains, his voice slightly slurred. “This place. This was ours. It was safe.”
“I do,” Luna says.
“Your tattoos!” The intruder says, boldly stepping over Ron’s chaise and crossing in front of Hermione to get to Harry, eyes wide and hungry. Harry immediately sits up, pulling the towel draped across the back of his chair down over his shoulders.
“Altered your bond with Bill.”
Harry frowns, his alcohol-soaked mind clouded with confusion over how this stranger knows his name; surely his mask covers his scar. He watches the man warily as the seconds pass and he doesn’t slink away into the throng of revellers around them, but instead stares down at Harry through a mask painted in creams and gold with lips stained red from wine.
Draco, but for more than he’d ever expected, and the realisation washes over him like a wave on the seashore, sharp and cooling with a bit of grit at the fringes. After stumbling over this shocking truth as one stumbles over a sudden crack in the pavement, a swell of panic threatens to choke Harry, climbing up his throat like a vine on a tree, and Harry closes his eyes for the briefest of moments, wanting to be consumed.
“You aren’t.” Luna points, and sure enough, Hermione is walking towards Draco on the rocks, having abandoned her post at the front door where she was no doubt waiting to see Harry and Luna off on their reluctant journey.
“You didn’t know he was going to practically strip you to capture his art, did you?”
“It’s already gone too far, hasn’t it?” she asks, sounding astoundingly sad while commenting on something that should bring them all joy.
“He’s alive,” he says, repeating what Luna had told him in the kitchen.
“Yeah, making tea for the missus.”
once again.
Luna shakes her head, adamant. “It’ll rain tomorrow.”
Draco leans one elbow on the bar, watching Harry with hooded eyes. He’s had his fair share of shots too, having lost his fair share of games. They’ve been ensconced inside their favourite pub for hours, celebrating the beginning of their holiday break. Outside, snow falls softly onto the pavement, set aglow by the neon light of the pub’s logo pulsing in the window.
“I felt that,” Harry says, voice low.
“Well, funny story, actually,” Teddy starts, “since the magic of this island is ancient and all, and somewhat mischievous. . . ”
Draco nods, brows furrowed. “Did you really think it’d be someone else?”
“Yes. He found his utopia.”
"Authenticity, my love."
“We can!” he says, earnest and desperate, and endlessly stubborn. Leave it to Harry Potter to weather the storm in the most difficult and perilous way possible. He never did learn to ask for help when he needed it most, damn him.
The waves crash against the rocks, the breeze whips past their faces, and Draco remains steadfast above Harry, holding tight to his hair, guiding his head where he wants him. Harry’s own erection is ignored in his desperation to make Draco
Harry raised an eyebrow, intrigued. He nodded and not a moment later, Malfoy had issued a wordless spell that sent the cool sensation of trickling water cascading over his head and down his neck, eradicating any and all traces of pain. He shivered at the feeling, not chilled but pleased. He smiled, unable to stop himself before remembering that the reason he was stuck in this room on this floor, with two singed hands (one glowing blue) was because of the very git who’d just relieved his pain. He managed a gruff
He thrashes in her grip, continuing to howl an unearthly cry that reverberates through her very bones and shakes the window panes in their sills. Behind them, a candelabra crashes to the floor and a shock of blue flame licks up the gilded frame of an oil painting. Narcissa screams at the fire as if the very timbre of her voice could halt its progress. Draco spasms in her grip at the sound, his fingers digging into her delicate arms like talons on a hawk, clawing at her as if her skin were no more than the flesh of a fish. She holds him tighter on instinct, unwilling to let go, refusing to concede to the madness overtaking her precious son—the only person she has left.
“The fuck?”
So much heat.
Church bells ring out in the distance and Harry looks down at his watch, noting that his train is due in ten minutes. He rubs his thumb over its yellowed face, the inscription of Dudley’s name set into the backing, and smiles. Draco had given the watch back to him only that morning. When Harry had woken, one last time in Draco’s bed, it was to the sight of the watch strapped around his wrist and Draco’s pale hand pressed tightly over the constellation that now resides proudly next to Sirius’ on Harry's chest.
in Draco’s hands on the seventh morning of his summer residence at The Sanctuary.
. . .
“It’s too painful. I ca—I can’t,” she stammers.
“Don’t,” he starts, cuts himself off. Tries again. “Don’t give up again, okay?” He says, petting her muzzle. Long, smooth strokes of his pale hand against her leathery skin over the jagged bone of her face. “You’re too important.”
Swallowing hard, Harry attempts to speak, fails, and swallows again. He drops his arm and turns his face to find Draco staring at him. The world is fuzzy around him but Draco’s perfectly in focus, as if Draco has willed his appearance to be seen by Harry at all times, lenses be damned. The sensation of perfect sight is so extraordinary, Harry doesn’t dare look away.
“No, I wasn’t.”
This startles a laugh out of Harry so loud a nearby pigeon goes fluttering from its perch.
“To study art?”
“I’m sorry, Draco,” he says, turning from them back to his daughter.
!” Draco curses. The elastic of Harry’s pants snaps back into place with a painful sting. Harry slumps forward, groaning. “Sorry,” Draco says, standing and quickly pulling Harry’s jeans back together.
since Cecilia owns one and keeps it conveniently docked just outside in the slim canal beside their building. Its sleek teak exterior gleams in the late-afternoon sun, and the fine Italian leather of the seats looks as inviting as ever as they all step down off the stone ledge onto the boat, sunglasses firmly in place and smiles wide.
“What about that poor beast!?” Draco points, dropping to his knees once more to pet the bundled mass of bone and leather curled into a tight ball, a self-preservation tactic to collect warmth, no doubt. He pulls the foal into his lap, cradling her.
“Hey Harry want to head back now” she asked and gave a slight smile she could tell he wasn’t really enjoying himself anymore.
“We will make you live your life even if we have to drag you through it kicking and screaming Draco Lucius Malfoy” Blake finished then gave him a smile and walked over to him and hugged him tightly. Draco could only stand there and look at his friends, his heart picking up a beat. They truly did care for him even the newest member.
“I’m not telling her anything, she’s a free woman and not in a relationship with you and even then, you wouldn’t be telling her what to do” he finished with a glare at their friend. Over the past few months Ron had become almost unbearable. He let his fame from helping defeat the dark lord get to his head and had become an unbearable ass. Not only that he thought it was ok to sleep around with as many females as possible and still try and hold on to and control Hermione. Harry had stayed out of it thus far trying to respect the girls wishes to handle it on her own, but Harry was done with it. They girl was his sister pretty much especially after Sirius had taken on her as his as well.
Chapter 6
“Oh my God she’s telling the truth, Draco! Im not a pet IM a human teenager and have stuff to do. Like take my potions. They always wear me out and I sleep afterwards” Draco stared at him in concern now along with Pansy.
It was a soft slow questioning kiss, lips lightly pressing together. Blake shuddered when Draco put both arms around his waist and pulled him onto his chest. The silk of Blakes shirt felt nice against his naked chest. Draco opened his mouth and ran his tongue along Blakes lip asking to be let inside but not forcing. Blake hesitantly opened his mouth and Draco slipped his tongue inside meeting the others tongue. The two caressed and slid together for a few moments before Blake gently pulled away and looked down at the blond his face went red, realizing what had just happened and that he was on the blonds bare chest. Draco smiled and leaned up pressing a small kiss to the others lips. He then put his hand on the back of the others head and brought it to his chest.
“Shame, that,” Draco mumbled.
Granger flushed. “Yes, well, it was Harry’s idea really…”
"Oh really?" Harry asked, hanging his arms loosely around Draco's neck. "Then how come I can see how much you love me in your eyes?"
"That's what I'm finding out," Harry grumbled. He hobbled down the hallway, still stubborn about using the cane he'd been given for his ailing knee.
“I can see how that would distress you.”
Draco blanched. For once he had no snappy comeback. "I…you…that's—" He took a deep breath to calm himself before glancing back at Harry. The other man wore a smirk that suited him all too well. "You're lying!" he accused.
He shook his head. "I have to make sure Santa gets on his sleigh okay." He leaned down and whispered loudly. "Santa's big belly sometimes gets in the way." The children laughed.
"Well, it wouldn't be worth finding if it wasn't," Draco said sensibly.
Eva frowned. “What’s wrong?” she asked, looking around the room. “And where’s Harry?” Her eyes widened as she forced Draco to sit up. “You didn’t kill him did you?”
Draco chuckled as he placed his dirty laundry in his suitcase. He stiffened as he felt eyes on his back and turned to find Potter staring at him. Despite his promise to himself minutes earlier, old defenses sprang up. “Can I help you?” he snapped.
That admission shocked Draco to the core. He studied his companion, who fidgeted with his glass. Deciding he could always blame the alcohol later, Draco drained the rest of Eva’s Tequila Sunrise and grabbed Harry’s wrist. He placed his glass on the counter, and reached to do the same with Harry’s.
Draco placed a hand over his heart and feigned surprise. “Are you cheating on me?”
Draco took in the large stone fortifications. Even in ruins they looked formidable. He craned his neck to look to the tops of the walls and felt a sudden sense of vertigo. He teetered and a sudden strong grip steadied him. He opened his eyes—when had he closed them?—to look into spectacled green eyes. Was that concern? His thoughts spun as his world finally settled.
They left the gathering room to a chorus of goodbyes. After making sure they weren't being followed, they entered the kitchen and exited out the side door. The air had chilled with the coming of evening, and Draco shivered. He looked to his companion, who seemed unaffected by the cold.
“Move it, Malfoy,” Weasley snarled, pushing him out of the way.
“Eva!” Harry called.
“You bloody dragged me here, you absolute loon!”
Draco sniffed. “It is not my preferred locale.”
At that moment Weasley chose to make his presence known. “Harry!” he exclaimed loudly. “I hafta tell you…tell you…what?” He blinked rapidly and looked to his wife. “Help me out Minee.”
"He hates me anyway."
"What's a menorah?" Draco asked.
Draco sniffed. "I'd like to say I am a respectable man who has a proper admiration of other men."
Eva grinned. “Please, Harry. Trust me, I’m excellent at these things. And besides, we’re going to a gay club so you’ll likely be wearing the least amount of make-up there.”
“Not so much,” the other man said. “You are a very attractive man.” He stopped dancing and held out his hand. “My name is Raj.”
Draco was grateful that the redhead had closed the bathroom door, but he winced as he heard the tell-tale signs of traveler’s diarrhea. He would never admit it, but he had his own experience with that. His family had done a lot of travelling when he was younger. His parents had always ensured that he ate only safe food, but he had once gone against their advice. He had hidden a treat a vendor had given him and eaten it in private. As a young child he didn’t understand that there were consequences to introducing your system to a foreign food quite suddenly. The only reason he hadn’t been punished was because of how sick the treat had made him.
Draco watched as Potter shook his head before throwing down a handful of floo powder and calling out his destination. In a flash of green, he was gone.
coffee before turning his gaze out the windows. “How long before we get to India?” he asked.
Draco shrugged, trying to appear as though he wasn't extremely embarrassed. "Eva has a really annoying habit of usually being right."
There was a moment of silence before. "That doesn't really answer the question."
Her husband came to stand beside her. “Better to keep a close eye on you,” Weasley said evenly, with a slight glare.
"Hi Papa!" Lily greeted. She threw her arms around Draco and he hugged her tightly.
Draco bristled at the bad joke. “I’m hardly a child, Potter,” he said disdainfully, crossing his arms. He could feel Eva’s glare, but that just further aggravated him. She had no right to be this grumpy. This entire journey was her fault.
Draco felt his heart sink. "Harry, that looks atrocious."
"Aw you staying Dwaco?" Delilah asked.
"That's impossible," Harry said matter-of-factly.
Draco rubbed the bridge of his nose, his nerves fraying at the ridiculous argument. “I want you to run
The woman frowned. Harry couldn't blame her; that was rather rude of the blond. Then again, she was the one who had invaded their quiet evening. How
Eva ended up saving Draco’s sensibilities as she skillfully engaged her companions in conversation. He could see even the Weasel and Potter visibly relax under Eva’s social graces. She had interested everyone in tales from their store, and traded the woes and joys of customer service with the Weasel and his older brother. He inwardly cringed when Eva included him in her stories, but knew that Granger must have told her friends that he worked at a muggle clothing store. It was only a matter of time before someone grew brave enough to ask about it.
“I’ve had plenty of practice.”
"Which part?" Harry asked cheekily.
Draco shrugged his shoulders. "Whatever. But before we go any further we must acknowledge that J.K. Rowling did, in fact,
Instead of jumping to reassure Harry of the opposite, Draco just hummed. "It's possible."
As they ate, Draco made Harry forget that the morning's murder had been linked to his case. He forgot that he had been wearing his Auror's robes since five o'clock that morning. He forgot that they were sitting in his cramped office, decorated only with disorganized files and loose parchment. He allowed himself to enjoy the time with his husband, as temporary as the moment may be.
“Don’t do that!” Eva snapped. “I hate that ‘holier-than-thou’ attitude of yours. And arch-nemesis is as good a word as any.” She paused and redirected herself. “And yes, I am very observant and read people very well. You were all tension with them. I thought you were used to dealing with people who shared a mutual dislike?”
In a rare show of wisdom, Harry simply nodded. ‘Sorry,’ Eva mouthed, but Draco just shrugged. She rolled her eyes and shook off the awkward moment with a grin. “I can’t wait to see Ron’s face when he finds out where we’re going.”
Draco took a sip of his blessedly black coffee. “This was your idea,” he reminded her.
“Hermione,” Eva started, with a much too sweet smile in Draco’s direction. A sense of foreboding settled in the blond’s stomach. “How would you like to go to India?”
"Okay," Harry replied. He ran a hand through his hair and took another deep breath. "Okay."
“Draco, dear, you’re sounding insane,” Eva said soothingly. She placed a hand on his arm.
“It’s a pensieve, Potter,” Malfoy said, sounding slightly insulted. “It’s not as if I can go digging around.”
Granger nodded. “All right. I’ll stay here with Ron. You guys have fun.”
Draco and Eva simply nodded as they took in the room. Every wall was covered with bookcases. A writing desk stood in front of one wall. There was a quill sitting in a stand which Draco enviously identified as a phoenix feather. A pile of books was stacked on one corner of the desk. On the opposite side of the room sat a cluster of couches and armchairs. The pillows and blanket on one couch suggested that Raj spent many nights in what was apparently his office.
The woman collapsed into an armchair. "Yeah, I think. I'm not really sure how far it got because the scene was written so horribly."
Robards was pleased that they were making some progress, though he was less than thrilled with the direction that progress was headed. Harry and Ron were becoming much more familiar with alchemy and Malfoy was spending an increasing amount of time at the Ministry. Harry saw the blond in some capacity on most days of the week, which was becoming both a blessing and a curse. He was constantly caught in an internal battle over reminding himself that this was
"Dwaco!" she exclaimed, throwing herself into his arms. She was a six-year-old with a bit of a lisp, and was fond of Draco because he had told the other kids to stop making fun of her. "Where's Hawwy?"
“There are certain potions that require parts of the body that have been forcibly taken. Seeing as your murderer tends to go after wizards who would seemingly not be missed, I would think he is choosing the easiest method to obtain the required ingredients.”
Harry frowned. "Of course, Draco."
Eva’s eyes lit up again. “He’s convinced that the Enchanted Stone is still in India!”
Eva nodded. “Yeah. Have you heard of it?”
With a sigh Eva reached under the couch and pulled out a notebook. The edges of the pages were worn; a sure sign the notebook had been heavily used. It was opened to a page that had scribbles, diagrams, and foreign letters strewn across it. She looked directly into Draco’s curios eyes. “Have you ever heard of the Enchanted Stone?”
The blond took a sip of his cider. "Don't worry about me. I will have my fire, my hot cocoa, and the latest release by Steven McCoy courtesy of my mother."
She pushed him toward the floo before Draco could involve him in another argument. “Safe flooing!” she said with a wink.
“I did not!”
Draco did not do morning-after conversations—he really didn't. He preferred to vanish before he had to face his conquests while sober. Granted, this hardly qualified as a "morning after", but this was Harry Potter! As much as he wished he could simply disappear, he knew he would be in Harry's presence for at least the remainder of the week and he was better off having this conversation now, while they were alone.
He wasn’t sure what prompted Malfoy’s assurance, but he decided he didn’t want to know. "So, what? We're looking for a suspect who's lost someone? Doesn't exactly narrow down the suspect pool."
That was the question Draco had been hoping would not come up. He had not bothered to RSVP, convinced that no one would lose sleep over it. The invitation had been sent for proprietary purposes. All wealthy Wizarding families would have been invited, in hopes that they would fund Muggle Awareness Measures. Now Granger had to bring it up out of some sadistic need to make idle conversation.
After a glance around the bar area she hopped down from the counter. “Let’s go back to my place.”
After the last gift was opened, "Santa" sat down and read "The Night before Christmas". At the end of the book, Draco announced that it was time for Santa to leave. The sounds of disappointment were probably heard out on the street.
Harry shook his head but decided not to continue that particular vein of conversation. "You should really be impressed that you beat him at all. No one I know has ever beaten him."
As Eva climbed out of the car, the driver handed her a calculator. She frowned at it but dug out the required fare. “Shukriyaa,” she muttered and climbed out of the car.
"I suggested the library because I knew Raj worked here," Eva explained.
Though Draco assured them he was fine after getting back some mental use, he didn’t protest too strongly to being half carried toward the road. He still felt the overwhelming urge to sleep. Eva kept pausing to make sure he took frequent sips of water. Once they approached the road she flagged down a cab.
“Remind me not to go shopping at the Weasley store,” Draco said as Eva finished the story.
Instantly two figures dropped from the ceiling and landed on the couch on either side of her.
Draco raised an eyebrow at that little tidbit of information, but otherwise made no further comment. That decision certainly had nothing to do with the steely gaze coming from his right. Eva may not have been a witch, but she could still be menacing; though one would be hard-pressed to get Draco to admit it aloud.
Draco shivered as the burn of alcohol entered his body. He noticed Granger do the same. Weasley was licking his lips and Harry was frowning. Eva, the lush, did not seem affected in the slightest. “Who wants another?” she asked.
"—Ariana. Good grief, I only got the two of you together!"
"Now don't go stealing all the hugs, Draco," Harry griped from behind.
Draco sniffed. "Of course not, I'm a Slytherin. I've been trained to lie with a straight face, and not give anything away."
“Why the hell not?”
Draco sniffed and collapsed in the chair beside her. He would love to put some distance between them, but the only other open seat was next to Potter, and he was not about to subject himself to
“Sure,” Harry answered warily. He walked toward his bed, passing Draco. “All right there, Draco? You seem a little flushed.”
A look of disgust crossed Draco's face. "Disgusting, but accurate."
A few more strokes to that magical spot and Draco came with a cry. Harry wasn’t far behind, and he milked his orgasm as he emptied into his partner. He collapsed against Draco’s back and found that they were both shaking from exertion. He watched idly as the evidence of their activities washed down the drain. They let the steam of the shower billow around them until Draco began fidgeting.
"How creative, Mal-Soyboy."
"Finally!" Hermione exclaimed, relaxing a little as she tended to her teapot just before it actually started whistling.
Maybe it was the fact Malfoy hadn't even left a note, just his invisibility cloak neatly folded with a gray scarf on top.
Harry didn't sleep that night.
They'd put Draco in a room alone. Slytherin parents had made a right ruckus at their children being in close quarters with a criminal- one had called him a sociopath. Though, 'evil junkie' was the only one that got to him. Higgs had no reason to suspect it, maybe it was just how Draco looked.
"So what? You're high."
"There you are. Are you going to come to sup- What the bloody hell did you do to my house?" Ron stood, staring at the faint green veins running along the side of his home.
He ordered vodka shots, sharing them with a guy who'd been talking to him. Harry wasn't particularly listening. The guy- Brian maybe?- was fit enough. Skinny, pale, rosy lips, but his hair was just a tad too yellow. Harry prefers platinum.
"And you're a whore."
He could kill himself. No one except his mother would mind it. Maybe the elves who would have to clean him up. It would be easy. Too easy. Fuck-
"Ask me when you're sober." Draco didn't know if Harry heard him, he was intensely focused on kicking his blankets into submission. It was cute. At least it would have been, if Draco didn't know it would fade away again. Harry would sober up and hate him again- or worse, pity him. But Harry wouldn't be sweet. He wouldn't be cute. He wouldn't think of Draco. He wouldn't.
Malfoy hadn't even gone to the bathroom. He sat perfectly pristine in every class, taking notes and answering every question professors asked. Harry didn't notice him itch his arm or sniffle once, he really didn't look like a drug addict. He looked the same as always, just a little skinnier and a little more annoyed.
Draco laughed. He'd laughed more that night than he had all year, his stomach muscles were already unnaturally sore.
"I'm serious, Malfoy. I can pay you for it, if that would help." Harry sat down on the other side of the room, the cool concrete easing his nerves. He was at Malfoy's eye level, mere meters away.
"Sorry, wasn't expecting visitors." Draco motioned to the room, it wasn't messy but it wasn't as pristine as he used to keep his dorm. He dug through the trunk a bit before finding and downing a potion. It smelled like the comedown brew Draco always used to make.
"We could have breakfast. Okay," Harry followed Draco's lead, pushing thoughts of the future out of his mind and focusing on what ingredients he had in his kitchen. They'd deal with it later.
"Against what? A bunch of stupid teenagers."
Harry grabbed Draco's shoulders, only noticing how aggressive he was being after Draco stilled, he took a second to try to choose his words after pulling his hand back. "No, Draco. I mean, you should sleep here, I can go to the living room if you don't want me around. You look- you really should sleep."
That only left giving it to him.
"He accepts anything shiny or muggle crackers."
Gentle thoughts invaded Harry's mind. A fantasy he'd put away since school; Draco finding him in a Hogwarts corridor, hands caressing him through his robes and tenderly cupping his face into a kiss. Harry would whine 'what are you doing' and Draco would only move closer, closing the gap between their lips. A cautious kiss full of pent up infatuation.
Draco was aching for a hit. Jonesing- that's what a muggle had called it once when Draco was searching for real heroin. He had gotten it, too. It only cost half a galleon. Merlin, it was heavenly. He wished he had some.
"Take me home, Potter." Malfoy demanded softly, throwing the end of his cigarette into the street.
"You would be a good option, babydoll." Potter had slumped over with his words, his lips brushed against Draco's neck as he spoke.
"Draco?"
Harry took Malfoy's mouth against his, harsh and desperate. He'd wanted this for years. He wasn't going to waste it. Malfoy made the prettiest little whimpers into him as Harry nipped at his bottom lip, wishing it was hard enough to bleed so he'd have some proof that he got Draco Malfoy under him. His hands ventured down Malfoy's arse, cursing the leather for being there as he tried to fit his hand underneath it. Reaching up to play with Malfoy's nipples with his other hand, Harry kept his tongue and teeth focused on leaving as much proof that Malfoy, at least in that moment, was his.
It was only 7 A.M. but he couldn't bring himself to even try to go back to sleep. He pulled on a shirt and moved towards the bathroom, faltering as he found the door locked.
Did Draco want him? Harry laughed at the thought, but he couldn't help the warmth it spread through his chest.
"Did you get enough for your press release, Potter, because I'd really like to enjoy my last high." Draco inwardly scrambled to collect his kit, cursing himself for letting the rest of his supply sit out in front of the Golden Boy.
"Well, that's a bit much."
Maybe he did give Potter too much. Too much heroin and he's dead. Too much mind-blowing sex and he's too sore to get out of bed.
Harry didn't know that one, maybe he should've gone to auror training. The cracks merged back together but the thin green lines stayed.
After a long fifteen minutes of silence, Harry cast another spell Draco had never seen. Lighting the room a dim green as he sat up to ask "Are you okay?"
Draco inhaled as he pulled out a large shard of glass from his shoulder, blood trickled down his pale skin. Pretty. Harry looked around for the fugs, eyes locking in on the tattered pack next to Draco's bare thigh. He'd taken off his pants, they were thrown onto the sofa, covered in holes and little spots of wet red. He had tattoos all over; a wolf ran back and forth from his knee, a hippogriff sleeping near his ankle, and a small elf with a lantern walked in spirals around his thigh, a brick tunnel following where it walked.
"I'm going to the bathroom." Harry clenched the pill bottle in his pocket, grabbing the cigarettes with his free hand. His fingers brushed against Draco's thigh as he slid the pack off the counter, gasping as he felt a stray shard of glass fall from his forearm. He was grateful Draco didn't say anything about the sounds of the pills hitting plastic as Harry walked.
"You don't get to make demands, Potter."
"Find out, Potter."
"How ironic." Harry laughed, Draco knew exactly what he meant. He missed that, being in sync with someone.
"What's the blood from?" Potter's voice was resigned, it seemed like a genuine question but Draco had learned not to trust himself in these moments. Surely, he was plotting revenge for the train. Draco had been wondering when that would come. It seemed only fitting the rage of withdrawal was countered with the shame of discovery. "Malfoy, do you need healing?"
"You're not going first?"
Draco thanked every ancient wizard he knew of he didn't have to invent a response to the abhorrent question of 'are you okay.' Pansy was kind for that.
His hand found Malfoy's wand, his magic surged through it leaving his fingers cold and numb. Merlin, he really needed to get rid of it. The remnants of Malfoy's magic in it were painful, the same air that surrounded those late nights. Harry wished he was allowed to miss it.
Harry wanted to send an owl, but he didn't know the address. His owl was a fucking moron, unable to follow vague directions. Maybe he'd use someone else's or get a new owl. He needed one. But he'd grown quite fond of little Nessa.
Before Draco could answer Harry kissed him. Gentle, like his schoolboy fantasy. He brought his hands to finger through his hair, tongue sliding against Draco's bottom lip. Harry traced shapes into pale neck fingers brushing against his earlobe.
"It was." Harry was resigned about it, quiet and solemn as he flicked his lighter absently into the air. "They went away for a while, I think."
He knew he looked aghast. More translucent than any ghost he'd seen- his skin barely clinging to his bones, his eyes vacant, his hands shaking, his hair unkempt. Everything about him was worse. He didn't need the mirror's reminder.
Draco had forgotten about the other trailing hand right up to when it reached his thigh, dangerously close to the territory of mistakes. His own whine was deeply cruel. Potter couldn't possibly know what he was doing.
"Sorry I doubted you."
"I still need to borrow a scarf."
Malfoy's body moved so fluidly, arms moving down his body like he was underwater. Harry could see his adam's apple bob, swallowing as he danced. Sweat clung to his frame, matting down his necklaces to his mostly bare chest. He danced for what seemed like eternities.
"You gonna let me fuck you tonight, Malfoy?" Harry mouthed against sweaty collarbones, tongue lapping out as he spoke.
Draco came up to where Potter was. Looking him straight in the eyes as he spoke, "It wasn't all day, it was all Transfiguration class."
"You hate me, too."
The door was locked, Harry stopped himself from breaking in, resigning to knocking. Malfoy didn't answer.
"You did so good for me, Harry. So good." Even if it was the worst idea he had ever let himself indulge in, he wasn't going to let Potter feel like he wasn't the best fuck Draco's ever had.
Draco left. Harry went home. The whole thing was dramatic and unreasonable, fitting for Malfoy.
Harry laid down, adjusting to the feeling of someone else- of Draco in his bed with him. He turned his lights out without thinking, the spell an instinct in the back of his mind when his back met mattress. Draco didn't seem affected by it, only letting out a sigh as he laid beside Harry. They didn't touch at all, the deliberate space between their bodies remained until Draco fell asleep. He really was as exhausted as he seemed, Harry hoped those weeks they'd been away from each other were kind to Draco.
"Oh."
"You're in my bed, my house-"
He refilled the water bottle and spelled it with Malfoy's wand to keep as a souvenir.
"You can call me Malfoy again."
"Merlin, lighten up. As if I'd ever fancy you. I can get far better blokes."
"Long time for a piss, Potter."
Draco was still trying to process how Potter had ended up under his needle, calling him babydoll- moaning it. He couldn't blame him, Draco nearly orgasmed on his first try. Draco stopped the needle halfway through, it would be terribly inconvenient for him to go to Azkaban this year.
"Go ahead."
"Feels better with it, natural I suppose," Harry sniffled, wiping his nose against his shirt sleeve. Malfoy definitely noticed.
"Draco-" Harry Potter's voice broke as his body sounded like it fell against solid oak, he laughed. Draco hadn't heard his laugh in a long time. It still sounded heavenly, he didn't appreciate it enough when he heard it all the time. "Draco I know you're awake. I brought you- fuck- a crunchie. A lot actually. Open up, love. Come on."
The silence only lasted a beat before Harry filled it again, "Where's Pansy this year?"
"What the fuck is wrong with you?" Malfoy shoved Harry away, almost pushing him off his chair completely.
"You're real." His voice was hoarse, like he hadn't spoken in years. It hurt Harry to hear it. Didn't he talk to anyone?
Fuck it.
He missed heroin. It wasn't as painful.
He fell asleep almost immediately after he'd stumbled his way back to the dorms. A warm dreamless sleep, only counteracted with nausea.
Draco knew he should've prepped Potter too, he would have if he was thinking clearly, but it seemed worse than Cruciatus to wait any longer. He pulled Potter into his lap, lined himself up and resigned himself to slowly pushing in. Potter threw his arms around Draco's neck, nearly breaking it as pulled their bodies close with an absurd amount of strength. He even pushed his hips down further, squirming and whimpering as his tight hole swallowed Draco's cock.
Draco needed to get away.
"Heroin's never a good idea, Potter." Draco laughed, Potter should know he'd been in the muggle world for years. Muggles hate heroin. They shout it from the castle-tops at every possible opportunity.
"Harry Potter wants to ogle French boys, Skeeter would have a fit."
"Stop being dramatic, you're fine," Harry said half-heartedly, making his way to the loo already popping the top off of the pill bottle from the inside of his pocket, making sure Malfoy doesn't see. He can already imagine the headlines 'Ministry confirms Harry Potter; Boy Who Lived is a Worthless Junkie' not that he is a junkie. An unwelcome 'yet' at the end of that sentence invaded Harry's thoughts.
"Lightweight," Malfoy laughed and pushed Harry's hand off of him.
Harry let Malfoy walk a few steps away before grabbing his hand and pulling him back, bodies flushed together. He apparated them, not caring if the muggles saw.
Maybe it was a hallucination, he'd had one before- a stag patronus that stared at him on what he thought was an overdose during the summer. It dissipated as he came back to reality, a figment of his shame for welcoming the release from it all. Potter wouldn't have had that reaction, he wouldn't just leave. Potter couldn't hate the press, he loved the spotlight. The attention. He was the Boy Who Lived. It couldn't have been real.
'Come back to Spirit Keys, Prat.'
Draco fell asleep before him, relaxing into holding Harry and it only took a few seconds of feeling Draco's sturdy chest falls against his back before Harry followed.
name. Get him expelled, ruin the Dark Lord's plans. Merlin forbid, get him sent to St Mungo's rehabilitation center. They hadn't even done as much research on muggle drugs as Draco. They'd only torture him. He'd definitely be killed there.
Draco hastily formed four lines with shaking hands on Potter's floating shelf. Barely able to stop himself from taking the fourth, he handed Potter the rolled up piece of parchment. Intently watching as Potter's eyes winced and his nose twitched around the heroin. He was quite cute.
"Potter, you have to let me in." Malfoy demanded outside his bedroom door, waking Harry up with a start. He was shaking, sweat covering his skin and his sheets, throat sore like he had been screaming. The dream had felt so real. Draco always made them feel more real.
Harry lit another cigarette, coughing as the smoke mingled with the Ritalin dripping down his sinuses.
Harry couldn't see Malfoy anywhere. He wasn't at breakfast, wasn't in Herbology, wasn't at lunch, wasn't in the library. A slytherin told him Malfoy didn't even live in the dorms.
"Of course not, have you seen me?"
"I loved those bricks," Ron whined to Harry.
'Malfoy Dorm' the map read. That couldn't be right. Why would Malfoy choose to live there? He was awful, sure, but Harry had seen him that night, Malfoy didn't consider that night a triumph. He wouldn't want to be there. It didn't make sense.
"I wouldn't have died, Malfoy. I'm incredibly strong."
"I want to kiss you."
(See the end of the chapter for
It tasted of lavender, Irish whiskey, and grape cough syrup. It was different everytime. Saccharine was the only similarity. The shrivelfig was at fault for that- Draco never got a consistent batch, they always bloomed differently.
Draco snuck into the gryffindor dormitories with ease, that god-awful portrait trusted anyone who knew the password. She was brainless.
"Hold this a minute." Malfoy gently handed Harry the saucer, careful not to spill any of it. He started rolling Harry's sleeve up but spelled his robes and his shirt off after grumbling about layers.
"You hate me, Draco."
Unimaginably cruel.
"I hate you. I really truly hate you, Harry." Draco whispered against Harry's lips after they parted. He didn't give Harry a chance to respond, pulling him back into the gentle kiss. Draco wasn't supposed to hate him.
The kiss carried until Harry felt his stomach drop. What happens next? They couldn't just be in a relationship. They couldn't just forget about it. Fuck.
Malfoy's mouth came into Harry's mind, what would his throat feel like? Warm, wet, tight. Malfoy would be a git about it, cursing Harry everytime he choked but silencing around it hungrily.  Harry knows he's a whore, he suspects it, anyway. The way he moved, tantalizing and dangerous. So agile and practiced.
"You like bees!" Harry's voice was too loud and defensive for such a ridiculous argument.
"Why do you call me that?"
Their hands moved in tandem, Malfoy pushing against Harry's cock and Harry resting his head against one of Malfoy's shoulder. It was bliss. Exciting. Fun.
He was an afterthought. A grim reminder. Unnecessary and painful.
"What's it matter to you?"
Malfoy was still inside him, Harry was still naked. It felt good. He stayed like that a while, his head resting on Malfoy's bony collarbones. Malfoy kept casting warming charms on them.
Harry could get Firewhiskey whenever he wanted, and make it himself in a dire situation. The perks of saving the wizarding world, people didn't question his bad coping skills. Half the eighth years were on some sort of bender. Ron and Hermione had discovered the wonders of boundless sex, Ginny was exercising beyond her abilities, Neville had become a blundering drunk like Harry. Most of the slytherins had taken to drugs, they had the money, the opportunity.
"Mine, too."
He really was getting to him. It was a shame Potter would hate him by the end of the year. Draco decided he wouldn't let himself get close enough to miss him when that happens. A reckless amount of heroin would salve any extra guilt, any regret. Potter could find his own salve. With that smile, those eyes, he wouldn't have any trouble with that.
"Well, you aren't dead, so there's really no need to be upset."
"Just because I took your virginity, doesn't mean we're in love, Potter." Draco was mocking him, he couldn't possibly be that stupid. He had to start regretting it soon. Draco didn't want him to feel more guilty for letting himself be tricked.
"Blame the ferret."
"How gryffindor of you."
The brick wall felt colder than the snow seeping into his boots. Harry hated everything that was touching him, he couldn't stand the way the bricks caught little strands of his hair or how it felt like it was scratching his- Siruis' jacket. Cold air blew his greasy hair back into his face, he couldn't bloody handle this. He absolutely loathed that god damn wall. The final straw was when he hit his elbow on it trying to put his lighter back in his pocket, making the cigarette he spent a whole minute trying to light into the wet snow. He punched it. Magic surrounded the force, responding to his rage and leaving green sparks in the cracks he created. Fuck. Ron's gonna kill him.
Harry did look at him though. At least he looked at him.
The potion bubbled, Draco only had to wait for it to turn red to get it in him. It usually took an hour.
"Fuck. Just let me do this one thing for you."
"Seriously, what the fuck Potter?"
He called him 'Malfoy' again. It hurt to hear it from Harry's lips. Loud and full of malice. Like sixth year didn't happen. It would be more bearable if it didn't, if it was all a big hallucination. But it was real. It had to be real.
"Find some insult, a pet name, something- Merlin, Potter, I'm already giving you some of my very limited supply, I can't do everything myself."
"You're really nice."
"Draco." It wasn't a question, just an echo.
After that week he decided he'd find something else to occupy his nights, it was mostly boredom and shitty television.
He thought heroin would last longer though, he didn't know how long they had been in that bathroom.
Fucking Malfoy against that brick wall, chasing each breath with Malfoy's as they fell against each other.  His head settled into the crook of Harry's neck, teeth latching into the skin, maybe breaking skin. Malfoy always looked like a vampire, Harry think he'd like the look of Malfoy with his blood surrounding those lips.
That only left returning it.
Draco wasn't doing well. He really looked like he'd been trampled by centaurs. He didn't eat. He didn't talk to anyone. It didn't look like he even slept.
"So?" Harry laughed, a little too long he will admit.
The terror in his eyes had relaxed into hopelessness. Harry tried to formulate a response, tried to comprehend what Draco meant but he couldn't think beyond how tired Draco looked. Like he would fall apart if Harry did anything else wrong. It tore at the lining of his stomach, Draco wasn't supposed to look so unraveled, so incomplete. "You should sleep."
Potter was an incredible bother.
"Sorry I defiled you, Potter."
"S'fine, just a little ash." Draco's eyes were fixed on Harry's thigh, a little hole in his pants where the cigarette ash had fallen. It hurt a little, when Harry noticed it, but the winter had numbed his leg already.
" Harry repeated in parseltongue, thinking Draco had said it wrong.
Draco didn't give his own veins the same careful treatment as Potter's, he knew roughly where the most viable ones were.
"Still stronger than you, Ferret-face."
"Aren't you supposed to be noble, Goldie? I recall telling you to calm down." Draco didn't dare to remove his grip on the more dangerous of Potter's hand, he couldn't stop the one leeching up his thigh. He hadn't had enough to truthfully say his judgement had been too compromised.
There wasn't any trace of Malfoy when Harry got into the corridors. He fumbled in his pockets for the map, Malfoy's footsteps were headed somewhere Harry hadn't even known about. The map seemed to materialize the area he was travelling to as he moved. Harry followed the path, too many steps behind to know the exact route of corridors and staircases.
Draco started on Harry's bed, levitating his spare pillows and blankets to a bed. Spelling them to make them comfortable like Harry liked- used to like. He stored the rest of Harry's crunchies on one of his shelves.
"I'm having a piss," Harry announced, waiting for Draco to turn away before spelling the pill bottle quickly to him. He can't take enough to cause another nose bleed, Merlin forbid he has to kiss Draco again.
Draco came out of the memory crying over a smile. Merlin, he never should have let himself give in. It all would have turned out better. Fuck.
Shit.
"Oh yeah that's- that is what I meant."
Draco kissed him again, white hot anger stoking the fire. Harry didn't try to stop it, this is what Draco wanted.
"You hate me."
"Can I sleep up there with you?" He asked, wincing as the words fell out of his mouth.
"You're a tease."
He could shove it under Malfoy's door. That was ridiculous, they probably changed the slytherin dorm password since then. Every other house had changed theirs. He'd be too drunk to do it stealthily anyways, he was always too drunk.
"You should be."
"You're not any better."
The boy spoke with an appropriate amount of hurt and awe, Harry prayed he wouldn't go to The Prophet. He always hated the gossip.
Draco's eyes lit up at the words, only for a second. The light washed out with a wave of defeat and sadness. "You don't call me that."
"Have you eaten? I didn't see you in the Great Hall."
Harry felt Malfoy's eyes trailing down his chest, and he gently remembered yesterday, "I thought you would've left."
Draco sniffled and Harry felt a wetness spread across his face from Draco's. He was crying. Crying?
Malfoy's laugh sounded nice, the real one wasn't pretentious it was surprisingly warm. Harry knew he had entirely changed from school- for the better, unlike Harry- but it didn't exactly register. He looked entirely different too, without his auror robes on. Tight trousers and tank tops looked good on him, the sleeve of his loosely draped hoodie hid his forearm. Or rather, what was on his forearm. Deathmarks couldn't be covered up, no matter how much ink and magic you put over it.
"And you had to fucking die to do it," Ron shouted from the doorway, Harry hadn't even heard him come in, "Blimey Harry, you're taking the bodyguard or I'm locking you in Azkaban."
"You didn't come here to ask about my well-being," Draco scoffed, his fingers twisted in his pyjama pants and his teeth tugged on his bottom lip.
"I don't scheme like you do, Malfoy." Harry scoffed, he wasn't that much like a slytherin, he didn't even think to get Malfoy punished. Maybe if Malfoy didn't make it look like heaven he would've done what any other gryffindor would and told someone, tried to help him.
Breakfast dragged on and on then finally he had had enough and grabbed up his bag making his way out of the Great hall to potions. He was the first there and sat up his station and notes. Snape had slipped in from his quarters, glanced around before making his way to his Godson.
Draco sighed and squeezed the boy once and pulled away. “Its complicated”
Draco sat there looking at their hands it felt right and soothing. He considered the offer, would it help? He had been thinking earlier about how it would be refreshing to have someone new to talk to. And maybe this could help bridge the gap more from the fuck up he had had with breaking Blakes trust. He took in a breath then sighed.
“I know good and damn well you weren’t the one I brought back to my room last night Blaise so why are you here” he threw his hand out next to him meaning to grab the cover and pull it over the other occupant of the bed but was met with an empty space. Draco sat up quickly and glared at the space like it had offended his family. He then noticed the note next to him and grabbed it.
Draco laughed and the others looked on astonished that he would dare laugh at the professor. Draco waved his hand dismissively and turned towards the front. Blake shook his head and did the same.
“So what do you plan to do then Potter” he whispered quickly.
Harry groaned as he started to come to his head felt like lead, and it felt like he had been eating sand with how dry his mouth was. He had definitely had to much to drink last night he was pretty sure it was the last two glasses of wine that did him in. He really should have left when Hermione had asked if he wanted to, but he wanted to give her space to explore whatever was going on with Blaise. He went to move his stiff limbs, but they were constricted, his face scrunched up at this. He then tried to roll over but was stopped when he felt something tighten around his waist.
“Harry would NOT want you to live this way, hating yourself, being miserable, crying all the time. I mean he was very vocal about how he felt everyone needed to live for themselves and their happiness, and I think if he knew you were living the way you have been it would destroy him” she laid her hand on his cheek with a sad smile and wiped away the tear that fell. Draco hugged her tight and shed a few more tears after that he pulled away with a sad smile.
They stepped through the entry way and was stopped by a big beefy teen they hadn’t seen before. He glared down a the two.
---------
“Sweetheart we’ve been over this. I prefer Red heads, which your supposed to be helping me get ideas for” Blaise said sweetly but you could hear the aggravation hidden in it.
He didn’t make it far because two strong arms wrapped around him and pulled him to a pale chest. One was wrapped around his waist and the other was holding the back of his head pressing his face into Dracos chest. Harry stiffened not knowing what to do. Draco started rubbing the others back hoping to sooth him.
“ What are you hiding, there’s no reason I cant come into your room. It has never been an issue before until now! You always come into my room!” The red head spit out.
“Nothing Professor but I need you to move so I can” the nurse snipped back
“Blake if you loved someone and lost them then another person showed up that made you happy. Would you feel like your betraying them, their memory if you let yourself be happy with the other person?”
“Blaise and Draco invited us, Hermione and Harry” she said as she tossed her hair behind her shoulder. Harry stared off acting like he was bored. The teen nodded and let them pass, when they stepped through it was a whole different world.
“Who’s we” she asked sitting down next to Blaise and he put an arm around her.
“Hermione you were next to me at the Yule ball you KNOW I cant dance and am worse than you” he laughed “But I guess well figure it out, but I draw the line at grinding” he said seriously.
“Draco you don’t have to its ok, Im sure Snape would understand” Pansy said softly. He shrugged his shoulder and stepped forward.
Draco nodded then dressed himself, all kinds of things flying through his head. Especially what Blaise had just said to him. He knew it meant something; Blaise wouldn’t say something like that just for the hell of it. He was sure the boy was under an oath at this point with the way he was choosing his words and not saying too much, and obviously that oath had to do with Blake. The two boys exited the hospital wing and made their way to the dungeons.
“As much as I want to see you grovel more Draco I do care about Blakes pride and I think its best if we leave you two to talk” he hared from behind him and he looked over to see Pansy pulling Blaise to the door to leave. Blaise threw a worried look over to Blake
Draco jerked awake and stared at his canopy above his bead chest heaving. He hadn’t had a dream about Harry that detailed before. It was usually always just vague memories that all ran together, from their quidditch games, to their fights in the hallways. But never a full-blown conversation make out session. As he thought of the dream kiss his heart dropped and ached. It had been so real to him, he truly wished he could have stayed there. Then he was brought back to the end, the part that had caused him to wake up. Blake Viper. His eyes, his hair, his lips, all felt just as real as Harrys. He was bothered, Blake was in his dream and kissing him but also, he felt, Happiness? At the promise, the boy made to him in his dream just like Harry had.
He put his letter in an envelope and sealed it shut, he called to his egal owl and sent the letter knowing she would get it first thing in the morning. He tucked himself back into bed and drifted off to sleep thinking about a brown haired boy with brown and green eyes. It didnt seem there would be any nightmares tonight either.
I know this update took longer than expected but I've been babying it. I want it to be perfect since so many asked me to write it. I have a few chapters wrote and am in the process of going over them. I do not have a beta so its all on me if there is anything you see please message me and let me know. I hope you all enjoy.
He is returning for his 8th year and wants nothing more than to go through the motions and morn the loss of his love. But there seems to be a boy that refuses to let him do that. And why does Dracos heart pull and yearn for this other boy, and those damn eyes! Will Draco make it to the end of his year, or will he finally fall off the edge, or will the fates bless him?
“How do you and Blaise know each other then if you were locked up and hidden all those years?” Blake looked to Draco and flushed a deep red and looked down again. “ Well either years ago I had to go to Diagonally with some care takers and we ran into each other. After an hour of him pestering me and stalking me” that statement got him popped in the head with a foot from said boy. “I finally sat down and talked to him. We talked for hours and after that we just kept in touch and hes actually helped me out quite a lot”
The afternoon classes went better than the start of the day. The three teens went from class to class, apparently, they all had the same schedule of classes and free periods. It actually looked like most houses eighth years all had the same schedule. Thankfully nothing more eventful happened throughout the day and nothing was said or got around about Dracos outburst in potions. After their last class they dropped their stuff off in their rooms and went for a walk, per Pansy saying the sun would do them all some good, Draco thought it was more so that she didn’t want Draco to hole up in his room for the rest of the night like she knew he would. They went out to the lake and walked around it chatting about the classes, and how they noticed some people had changed, mostly the remaining two of the golden trio, Blake of course didn’t have much to say about this. After they completed a full lap Blaise and Blake started to head to the entrance.
“Don’t go, everyone goes” he murmured sleepily and moved a little closer. Blake froze for but settled back where he was leaning before and the other as well. The last thing Draco remembered before dozing off into a dreamless sleep was Blakes whispered promise.
The doors swung open and Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Blake walked in. Dracos heart clenched when his eyes met Blakes. Blake sent a small smile then frowned when he saw the uneaten bagel on Dracos plate. He then glared at Blaise hard, said boy groaned.
Harry allowed himself to be drug over to the bad and stopped once Draco let go of him and went to his side of the bed. Harry sat down and started to take his shoes off then his over shirt and paused for a moment before he pulled his tee shirt over his head. Once done he laid back and pulled the cover over himself. He glanced up and froze when he saw Draco sliding into bed with nothing but silk pajama bottoms on. When the blond looked his way Harry quickly closed his eyes hoping not to be caught staring.
Draco smirked seeing the smaller boys face redden and he stepped back and waved for him to come in. The blond made his way back over to his bed and sat back up against the headboard where he was before Blake knocked.
Draco let his mind wonder as they climbed the stairs. He really didn’t want to be alone in his room he knew the only thing that would happen would be him crying as he had every night for ages now. But if it came down to it he could always wonder the corridors, it would give him something to do. As they were nearing the top floor where their rooms would be Draco heard a started cry and looked up in time to see Blake falling backwards towards him. On instinct the blond opened his arms and caught the boy, his back falling against Dracos front, his arm wrapped around the smaller boys waist trying to steady himself and Blake so they both didn’t tumble any further.
“I promise to try and live Harry” with that he smiled and took my cheek in his hand and leaned forward. His lips mere centimeters away from mine.
“I don’t know what your talking about Harry, but I don’t have to ask who you got all dressed up for” she finished knowingly. Harry cut his eyes at her in a warning, but the girl just laughed.
“We didn’t threaten or force them into helping. If I was honest, Pansy and I were forced into letting them help. Ron actually held a first year captive until someone let them in. Hermione was very Slytherin with her part. She told the poor child that no one would believe that they had held him captive because they were part of the group to help ‘Save the world’ and it was his word against theirs. I think Pansy actually fell even harder in love with the girl or came in her panties I’m not sure” Blaise and Draco both shuddered at that last part.
“Once I see you grovel well be even” Blaise cut his eyes to Draco and smailed as he watched Draco read the letter and grown.
“You sure about this, Harry?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Luna kisses her cheek. “Shhh, just let him sleep.”
back at Harry. “You really are a philistine, Potter.”
Harry wakes with a start, feeling the sun’s rays, hot and heavy on his skin. He puts a hand up to block the light, only to realise with a shock that his cock is out of his pants and there’s a telling stain on the fabric of his shorts.
“Wonderful.”
Hoping to stop vertigo from bearing down on him, he removes his glasses and covers his face, hiding it behind the bend of his elbow. Shrouded in darkness, he feels bold enough to say, “Draco, I’m sorry. It was wrong of me to—”
Grinning at how quickly she’d managed that, Luna springs to her knees, placing them on either side of Hermione’s hips and ducks down to place a kiss to her nose. “That’s one.”
Ron chokes on his drink. Harry is too busy shaking his head with laughter to answer, but Cameron insists, waxing poetic about the beauty of Harry’s skin and how it needs to be captured for posterity—“Such perfection should not be hidden behind clothes!” Harry waves him off, highly flattered by the compliments and takes the man's scribbled address on the back of one of the hotel’s cocktail napkins, if only to make him stop talking.
,” Draco moans, looking over his shoulder to see that shock of wild hair behind him and just a hint of his infamous lightning bolt scar standing out stark and pale against Harry’s forehead. It’s that mark, out of all the beautiful artwork on Harry’s skin—seeing that single jagged line of scarred flesh as Harry works into him that sends Draco soaring over the edge.
“Draco isn’t dangerous,” she whispers to him.
“Thank you,” he tells the priest, jaw tight. “
He scoffs. “She’s always right.”
“Oh my god, you’re impossible.” Harry shook his head, laughing into his hands. This was ridiculous.
Steeling himself, Harry takes in a deep breath and knocks, only to hear Draco call out, “For Merlin’s sake, I do not want anymore
