Harry smiled slightly, almost fondly, habitually rubbing the word across his palm in dark black letters with his thumb.
On the way to class, he recognized a flash of familiar blonde hair out of the corner of his eye. His head snapped towards it and he fought down a smile.
“I’m sorry to ask-to...dredge it all up again, but…”
Harry thinks.
They both waited for morning, slipping into sleep. Right before Harry let the darkness take his mind, he could have sworn he heard a soft, broken voice from his right.
Draco rolled his eyes.
Ron told them all about the squirrel he met while he was skipping arithmancy class, and the arithmancy professor himself who was walking by smacked him in the back of the head, then kept walking.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, and this is so awkward, because now we’re both naked and you’ve got to-well, take care
More blood spilled over the floor and down his skin and Draco bit back a scream when hot water ran into his wounds. But the guilt persisted and so did he, digging deeper, fearless, throwing caution to the wind. He was having the time of his life, and it sickened him. A loud knocking sound threw him off balance, and he slipped on the stones, landing heavily.
“That’s not yours, boy.” Vernon growled.
“I lost count.”
! He was a death eater! He killed people!"
so he proceeded.
“Had to brush my teeth. Ice cream.”
The spell should have killed him by now. Harry chalked it up to him being so weakened.
“Anything else?” He asked.
Five agonising minutes later, Draco had voided his stomach of food and managed to stop dry heaving.
Draco tried to run off to his room but the thought of the sad, miserable looking wizard scampering off to his sad, miserable room to sleep in the dark…Harry couldn’t bear it, so he let Draco run off to wash up for the night and turned back to the Gryffindors in front of him.
His hands were in his hair and he drew his legs to his chest.
Harry said, gesturing at Draco’s erection and rubbing his hands over his eyes.
“Draco, you shouldn’t be disappointed about that.”
“Too rich?”
“Let me get this straight. You saw
"Merlin Draco, what happened to you?"
Harry's big green eyes looked as if they were about to explode.
“He’s paid more than McGonagall and we bought a condo for his family. It’s his job.”
When Harry woke up, it was to the sound of someone in pain.
Icy grey eyes snap onto Harry's like a predator, but his voice is weak and his tone gentle. Tired.
“FIFTY POINTS FROM GRYFFINDOR AND SLYTHERIN!”
Draco’s face was pale and sad, and there was a sort of anger that manifested itself in his eyes and the way he furrowed his brow that absolutely terrified Harry, but made him inexplicably proud as well.
Harry just nodded.
“Nothing. Nothing at all. But apparently, he can’t get a hold of my parents-for obvious reasons-and so he wants to know what the hell’s going on.
McGonagall only smiled.
. It was slightly fainter and ran messily across his ribcage backwards, and Harry had a sneaking suspicion it was so he could read it in the mirror. The notion made him sick.
The lathering of the soap on his shoulders ceased for a moment and resumed.
"Pardon?"
"Draco put down the wand."
And yet here he was, sitting at the back of the class waiting for his partner.
"I-it's fine, I just...they're gone."
“Draco...we talked about this.”
He shrugged casually, and magicked his robe onto his shoulders, offering Harry a hand in the middle of the room. He took it and refused to let go.
No sarcastic quip, no scathing remark, no insults to hurl at the boy in front of him.
"Oh. Potter."
"Expelliarmus!" He hissed, and the sword embedded itself in a nearby painting of Salazar Slytherin. The man's hand immediately went to his pocket where his wand lay, but Harry quickly levitated it under the bed. The janitor grimaced, and was sent flying out the window and into the Whomping Willow. Harry paused for a moment, and heard an awful lot of banging about, followed by screaming, followed by the rustle of branches. He nodded in contentment, then ran to Draco's side, who sat with his back against the wall, sweating.
Harry hopped down from his perch, retrieved the spoon and dug it into the ice cream without missing a beat. Draco made a face.
Harry thought.
It was true that focusing on someone else seemed to take the wizard’s mind off things, but Harry couldn’t help feeling that he was being exploitative. The young Malfoy bid Finchley farewell and told him to say hello to his daughter for him, and Draco announced that he was going to shower. Leaving him to his own devices left Harry anxious, but he gave him space and turned on the telly, an ancient thing that looked like it’d never been used. Doctor Who reruns were on and so he watched. Draco ambled down the stairs half an hour later with blankets and pillows. They snuggled down into the sofa and watched Matt Smith, who Harry openly admitted to having a crush on. It only elicited a slight grumble from Draco, who good-naturedly agreed that the man was “a bit odd looking, but in an endearing way.” Hours rolled by like carriages and the boys fell asleep on the couch, in each other’s arms.
He tried once more, then transfigured a nearby sock into gauze.
“I killed my mother.”
Narcissa fell to her knees and rested her head in her son’s lap, crying softly.
"But now it is. I can't, in good conscience, let you go on like this."
she told him.
but he just smiled and headed off to the plane to collect their things.
“What?”
Until one night, he took his invisibility cloak and decided to go after the mysterious boy-only this time, it wasn't just him being nosy. He was genuinely concerned for him. It was time for dinner, and Harry had told Hermione and Ron that he grabbed a snack earlier. Said he wasn't feeling well, that he was just going to rest. Said he'd see them in the dorms. Harry quickly found Draco on the Marauder's Map, then apparated around the corner from him. Throwing the cloak over his shoulders, he watched as Draco glanced over his shoulder nervously and summoned the Room of Requirement.
The slytherin sucked in an almost-silent breath.
“Cheeky git. No, I meant what’s on it?”
"Hi."
“Right. Well, you can’t exactly wear your school robes in the muggle world and I simply won’t be seen in public with you wearing
"C-I can’t!"
Harry thought, but stuck to sipping it quietly, then put the glass down gently on the granite countertop.
He looked down and saw blood seeping through the waffley fabric of his shirt.
"No, I've been...rather busy."
“Nonsense. If you’d have died, well...it would have meant that the Malfoy family could never have been saved. This is the way it goes, Draco. The parents will always take the fall.”
“Listen, I will liberate your shoulder from its socket if you don’t order a sandwich.”
The glamour he'd cast faded away, revealing the bruises all over his face and shoulder, which peeked out from under his sheer sweater.
“Y’know, you could’ve at least said hello.”
"Bold of you to assume I care that much about you," he retorted.
"You didn't do anything. You were gone for three minutes, for Merlin's sake. I could have fought back," he murmurs, twirling his delicate unused wand between his fingers.
“Let’s have a chat, shall we?”
“What?”
Draco announced that he wanted to leave but Roache insisted he spend the night, to which he agreed reluctantly. Roache said he wanted Harry to stay behind, told Draco he needed to make sure he was good boyfriend material. He watched the blonde’s retreating form and felt a cool puddle of fear gathering in the pit of his stomach.
She winked, and Harry can hear her trying to protect the food from Ron.
"Draco! Draco please, you've got to end it. You've got to say it again."
chair. It was cleaner now, though still had smudges of blood here and there. Drips. Some were older and smudged, others were newer, brighter and just
"W-what is that?"
Harry gulped, and he found his mouth was dry.
The pale wizard slumped over, fiddling with his hands. Harry watched him from the line in front of the counter.
“I’m so sorry Draco, I’m so sorry, I can’t believe he did that to you, I can’t believe
Harry was led to the base of the staircase to a closet, where Draco fished out his own raincoat and deliberated over the others.
Draco was older now, lying on his bed, bleeding. There was blood on the floor and the covers were only halfway on the bed from where he’d dragged himself up. He looked like shit, his nose bent at an awkward angle and his body peppered with bruises. His cheek was so swollen, he could hardly see out of his left eye.
“And it’s none of your business what I put in my body! I never asked you to care!”
Draco unfolded his legs and kneeled in front of Harry’s chair, palms on his knees.
Harry's eyes welled up with tears, Draco standing cool and composed.
He strode calmly out, and ran down the hall and summoned the room of requirement.
“Not a full meal.”
Harry looked up at him with an endearing grin, holding aloft a dusty old cassette tape.
He stumbled to the bathroom, shedding clothing as he went until he shut the door behind him, breathing heavily and having done nothing.
"I-sorry," they both said. He arched a platinum eyebrow but said nothing.
He took his hand and pulled Draco to his feet. The wizard's eyes were frozen, still locked longingly on the ground.
“Right. Well, they’d come home around noon. I’d clean myself up. Be downstairs to put away the food and make lunch. Bruises take about a day to turn purple, so I’d use the green colour correcting makeup I’d nicked from the drugstore. Used concealer and heavy foundation until it healed. It was even written in his schedule. If I was lucky, as he put it, he’d print out copies of the photos for me and leave them on my pillow while I was sleeping so it was the first thing I saw when I woke up. I think I’ve puked in the toilet upstairs more times than I’ve pissed in it. That was our Sunday morning routine. We had a system.”
Harry's heart sank and he whispered an amplification charm.
Harry sighed, and turned the volume up.
“People seem to do a lot of strange things.”
"This is the real world, Potter. People do fucked up things."
Harry just shrugged and surveyed the ingredients.
“What?” Harry grumbled.
They both recall the incident so long ago in the bathroom.
wasn’t a virgin. But he broke.
The Slytherin frowned.
He returned as soon as possible, sitting across from the older boy and putting the warm drink on the table in front of him, where the froth was scrutinised by Draco as if it had offended him.
"That?" Harry adjusted his glasses and squinted at the bright light like an old man.
Harry fell quiet again, watching the clouds beneath them. Draco ran a finger over his upper lip as if he were considering something.
Harry shook a little. Draco’s nonchalance regarding the situation was...unsettling to say the least.
“I mean, there was that one time with the bus, but I’ve always come back.”
“I don’t think I can-oh god…”
“That’s one strike, Harry. Two more and I break your little birdy’s neck. You remember what happened last week.”
was scrawled across his chest. It was even and perfect, the handwriting sloping elegantly-unlike the slanted, angry lettering of the others. The dark mark on Draco's left arm was barely visible anymore under the dozens of burn marks and scars.
They were still walking hand-in-hand when the large oaken doors opened just wide enough to admit them, and the boys headed up to the Gryffindor common room.
He wasn't sure why, but suddenly Draco was crying again. Harry looked so sad, whispering a cleaning spell.
That’s like, the definition of not-fine.”
"No, Malfoy, this isn't bloody funny. They call it the 'Torture Curse' for a reason!"
“He was in a hidden room, and he used a curse called sectum...erm, sempra,” Harry murmured cautiously, not knowing the extent of his wandless magic. Most wizards and witches would need their wands to use something as powerful as a curse, but he didn’t want to risk hurting Roache. Or himself. .
"I was right...wasn't I? Y'followed me."
Draco smiled.
The soap was hosed gently off his skin and his vocal cords were scratchy and painful when he spoke. Which was precisely why he hadn’t planned on speaking at all.
They pounded at his door.
“More than okay.”
Harry sat down next to Draco and watched the elf cautiously snatch a biscuit from the platter on the coffee table between them and plop unceremoniously onto an overstuffed wingback with surprising nonchalance.
"Yep."
Draco groaned, knowing there was no point in arguing.
before-was that a thing people did? But it was nice, though he wasn’t sure how much of that he could attribute to being near Harry. Harry who, thankfully, didn’t bring up his little accident until they reached the doorstep. He slid in the keys and they walked in, and he was led by the hand to the bathroom.
of a porcelain mug hitting the counter, and footsteps.
Four weeks.
“It’s fine!”
he thought.
"Cru-crucio!"
“I’m not sure what the point of this is,” Draco muttered.
“I know. But what if I’m seen in public after I’ve gone? What if I’m reported?”
Draco's facade started to crumble away and he got up to open a closet in the wall, staring at his reflection. Harry had never seen such hatred in his eyes. He began to wonder if perhaps coming was a mistake.
Draco shivered a little.
Draco sat down heavily in his chair and threw his legs over the armrest.
Roache shuddered.
"Why are you going through my camera roll?"
“Well, now we head to my family’s-well...my flat back in Canary Wharf. Then I’m taking you to New York for Christmas, and we’ll head back to Hogwarts a week late because a), fuck school and b) I need to speak with someone regarding my parents’ wills, and he won’t be back until the third.”
Those nights were different. He could hear his mother’s pained laughs and squeals of false excitement and pleasure from miles away, from where he hid in his room in front of the fire with his wand in a puddle of blood because Lucius Malfoy was
Harry grinned, pecking his cheek.
He took a breath and opened the door, finding Harry sitting against the wall.
The wizard’s tone was scathing. Harry pondered.
He disappeared with a zing and a whoosh, and tiptoed up to his and Ron's door.
“Yes-but I didn’t mean to!”
"It-it's a joke. Sort of. This schoolgirl threw a soda can and screamed 'this bitch empty-yeet!' in a video and ever since then it's become a generation-wide joke...but strictly speaking, it's a verb. To throw."
"You know I'm not going to let you be alone anymore, right?"
The boy took it gratefully and the two of them left, Harry holding the large umbrella over Draco’s head while he locked the doors with muggle keys.
“Well, that’s going to change. You’re not going back, and that’s final.”
He got up and pulled his wand from his coat pocket, where it was thrown over a chair.
had removed the glamour Draco cast on himself, leaving him raw and human.
Jameson nodded, and Harry imagined he was thinking something along the lines of
"Finite," he whispered tenderly, and fixed the damage.
The brunette took him by the shoulders and sat him down on his bed, picking his wand up from the nightstand.
The gryffindor walked around the suite, disappeared into the bedroom while Draco picked up the telephone on the desk.
"Harry, you're not supposed to have that!" Hermione hissed.
His eyes cracked open slightly, still cringing away from whatever terror lay behind his eyelids.
Potter just giggled and wrapped his arms around his torso comfortably. Draco made no comment when the hinge of Harry’s glasses dug steadily into the his spine.
“That’s meant to be a side.”
"Dirty slut!"
“There are blankets in the closet by the door. Could you-?”
“Not nearly enough.”
"What?"
“It does that. We’ve nearly reached cruising altitude. Once we get there, it’ll be much smoother.”
She walked around the counter and muttered a spell, checking a little notebook that apparently sat inside one of the drawers.
Draco tossed his head, changing angles and staring into the mirror in a mixture of mischief and seduction. He just laughed at himself cynically and gave it up.
Harry nodded.
Draco steadied himself, and choked back a sob, his face breaking and his hands shaking.
"I'm watching The Office."
Harry broke down the door in an instant, wand-drawn. One of the janitors was standing over Draco, a hand to his mouth and a gladius; an ancient roman shortsword-yes, an actual sword (welcome to Hogwarts) to his neck. Tears and sweat trailed down the poor boy's face, a black eye starting to form and his shirt torn open. There was blood on the floor.
“If at any point you need me to close my eyes or leave, or explode the tapes on a remote atoll in the Tropic of Cancer, let me know.”
"Well that may be the case, but I still could have stopped you. I'm so sorry."
“Draco are you alright?”
In an instant, their lips smashed together awkwardly. It got easier, though, and soon Harry straddled the other wizard, slowly unbuttoning his shirt.
Ron hiccuped.
Since his father had bought it for him, its usefulness was the only thing keeping him from destroying it. He had already incinerated all the gifts his father had given him over the years, including the jacket he’d gotten on his sixteenth. Lucius was a man who believed in function over form; the coat was lined with protective wards. It looked plain but it was sturdy. That one took extra long to burn when it joined the desk, shoes and various pens in the bonfire in his backyard. The neat, flawless lawn still bore a huge scorch mark he didn’t dare fix. It made him smile.
“That’s erm...that’s a lot of blood.”
"Erm...Saturday?"
He just grinned, beating down that flicker of abject terror that only Draco saw. Harry gulped down the last of his milk, and, without breaking eye contact, took the carton and poured the rest of the entire thing down the drain.
The wizard groaned loudly, and stiffly swung his legs over the side of the bed.
“Well, erm...they’re both dead.”
“Roache? We’re home!”
"I-nothing, just...nothing."
Draco tossed the bottle under the bed and Harry helped put the UNO cards away.
Draco slid a pair of tinted sunglasses on and headed down the stairs, briefcase in hand. They walked out where two cars were waiting for them in front of the hangar.
"It hurts, Harry."
Harry gulped and reached his hand across the table, to the cuff of his crisp white shirt. Well, it used to be white.
He rolled his eyes.
With that, the boy stood shakily and limped to where his shirt and robes sat, shakily buttoning the former.
Draco grinned.
He crossed the room and sat at the foot of the bed, catching a square of chocolate Draco had thrown at him.
“Some creature?”
I can’t-“ he choked and Harry pressed a kiss into his hair, not giving a fuck at this point.
Draco healed the wound, unable to look at the pain in his face and magicked Harry’s hands and clothing clean, thankful for the divider between them and Finchley.
of his bones.
"Oh come on, Harry. You know they don't give a shit about us doing that anymore."
She rolled her eyes, and Draco found himself frustrated with her lack of anger. He softened.
The giant doors opened wide, and he skidded into the room.
"I thought I healed that?"
The tape was gobbled up by the old television and Harry plopped unceremoniously onto the overstuffed sofa, accepting the tea offered to him. The screen crackled to life. There was static for a moment, only voices. They were singing.
She frowned at him.
The pale wizard looked at him funny.
"So, we haven't really...we haven't really seen you around," Hermione pointed out.
“You don’t have to tell me, if you can’t.”
Harry helped him shakily to his feet, slipping an arm under his shoulder for support.
Harry snorted.
Harry tossed his head back.
did, but the next thing they saw was Draco, not more than a year ago. Just before the war.
“Potter, can I borrow your wand?”
They ended up talking through most of dinner, earning more than a few whispers.
"Let's go."
“You got a couch on this thing?”
The razorblade was on the ground and somehow, he’d managed to slash his stomach.
At that moment, Draco felt an odd mixture of guilt and overwhelming love. It fascinated him.
“I wish. But the people who own the building have cameras on the front step. My father had to obliviate the entire security staff one time when he locked me out and I’d used my wand to open the door.”
Draco rolled his eyes and dropped the carton and the lid into the rubbish bin, then grabbed Harry’s hand and practically dragged him back to bed. Harry had a weird look on his face and Draco made a mental note to tread carefully around him when it came to wasting shit. He was right, after all. The floor was literally clean enough to eat off of, and the dessert had remained in the container the whole time. But Draco didn’t trust himself not to eat more of it.
"Because it's dangerous!"
“What?”
The camera cut out again and Harry hoped this was the end, he really,
“I god, no, no I can’t do this again, I can’t please don’t do this I can’t...please sir…” he sobbed and Draco felt the odd urge to incinerate everything he could see.
They cuddled up wordlessly and it wasn’t until Harry started carding his fingers through Draco’s hair that he realised.
"Then why would y-it's an unforgivable curse!"
Draco frowned, thinking of the single trunk, owl cage and the little backpack he’d retrieved from the house.
His eyes snapped up.
“Yeah, well, your boyfriend’s picky. So I got us in for dinner, but we can go somewhere else for lunch. Unless you don’t want to go outside. I don’t want to go outside, to be frank, but-“
The great thing about the manor was that it was just big enough that three people could exist within it without having to confront each other’s presence for weeks at a time, but those nights...
Roache nodded.
Draco bit his lip in thought.
"Some things never change..." he mused.
Draco rolled his eyes and planted a kiss on his head beneath his chin.
The kind elf ambled over to him and knocked his wand to the floor, wordlessly healing the wounds and wrapping gangly arms around the boy’s torso.
The boy had returned to his previous maudlin state.
Draco gently snatched back the ice cream container and cradled it in his lap.
“Mmm.” He grunted.
Harry chuckles.
Draco didn’t know where she was now. He didn’t believe in foolish things like heaven and hell, but everyone else did and he wasn’t sure. His mother was gone. Gone where? If he were to hazard a guess, he’d draw a blank. If there was a tartarus, fields of punishment, purgatory-he knew that one day, he’d meet his father there.
He felt the odd urge to laugh.
“Do you want me to leave?”
he thought.
By the time dinner was over, Harry had forced him to eat three bites of bread and part of a drumstick. His stomach roiled.
Draco swore under his breath.
"Shhhhhh. Everybody alright with The Smiths?"
“Mm?”
He pulled out a quill and started scratching things into a book, and Harry sat next to him on his phone.
“I’m afraid, Malfoy, that you don’t have a choice in the matter.”
“Yes...my grandmother. She was quite the bookworm.”
“Yeah, it’s comfy. Not the nicest hotel in the city, mind you, but I’m trying to set a good example for Saddler. He’s the man who’s going to help me manage everything my parents left behind. ‘Thinks I’m too young and reckless to be trusted, so I’m trying not to splurge.”
“Finite,” he whispered, his wand ghosting over Harry’s warm skin. He nearly choked at what he saw.
Harry's eyes were wide, having expected the boy to continue his near catatonic state.
He'd had no classes with Harry at all.
He wished his legs would stop swaying, but soon his stomach churned and he felt like his brain was phasing in and out of reality. Dizziness clutched his head with sharp claws and Draco practically fell into the bathroom, where partially digested veal and rich chocolate cake gushed forth into the spotless toilet bowl. It splashed into the water and onto his forehead, which wrinkled in disgust. The voices in his head agreed that it was the worst park of puking one’s guts out.
“I can-I think I can.”
"I'm so sorry, about this, about the fact that I'm such a-"
The elf bowed before Draco who was reclined in the couch, and who also batted a hand at him.
The next scene showed Draco in a velvet robe, looking thin and worn, five o’clock shadow peppering his bruised jaw.
Malfoy just shivered in the cold, so Harry pulled the blanket over him.
"Jesus christ. Okay...okay, wait here."
"Professor-loo?"
The slytherin stifled a laugh and leaned forward, rested his forearms on his knees.
He grinned devilishly and sucked the dessert off the spoon in a way that made Draco’s heart do the macarena in his chest and
“Since when do you get to decide when you’ve made it up to me?”
“Yeah. Good ol’ killing curse.”
Draco just smirked and when the waitress came with their food. Harry ordered a BLT for him, which he nibbled at. Draco didn’t miss that it was the plainest sandwich on the menu, which must have been intentional. Still, he prodded it with a spindly finger.
“Where are they? The photographs?”
"Merlin Draco, why would you do that?"
“I said I’d floo over this morning.”
"Maybe?"
Harry scoffed, and the pale wizard met him with a smirk.
He lifted a hand to the cut and looked at the blood,
“Draco.”
“You are an insolent git, you know that?” Harry stated, though the look on his face still says
"No. I like-well, I care."
"Vulnera Sanentur, Vulnera Sanentur..."
The witch turned around on the couch, and wrinkled her nose.
“Are you ill? I don’t think you’ve got a fever…”
“I know.”
The last layer of gauze was peeled back to reveal the jagged blade, small and glinting.
"I don't know, just-graduate, move somewhere, get a job that has a positive impact on the world and use that to repay. Hurting yourself won't help anyone."
"Mmmhurts."
"Then whose is it?"
“God, are you alright?”
“I’m not-I’m sorry. Continue.”
a tiny spoon?”
"Probably just left it to rot."
“I figured we didn’t need too much space, so…” Draco muttered, tossing his jacket haphazardly over the back of the desk chair. Harry peeked his head inside the bathroom.
“Did you answer?”
"Yeah, who knows-maybe I'm just a masochist."
Without another word, he began healing all of the boy’s injuries. The only reaction he got was a brief
Draco looked down at his trousers.
Draco just smiled.
"Yeah, that's me," he chuckled wryly.
“Keep an eye on him, yeah?”
Yeah, Draco needed help.
“You alright, otherwise?” The slytherin asked.
"Why now?"
Draco grinned teasingly.
“What could you have done. To escape becoming a death eater.”
“Was this you?”
“Why would you think that? I mean...I wasn’t-but I’d never hurt you, that’s all…”
They cuddled up and the TV crackled to life.
“Yeah. Sometimes he’d take candids. Tried to capture the moment. Aunt Petunia and Dudley go to the grocery store on Saturday mornings, then the chemist for Vernon’s blood pressure medication and her diet pills. They didn’t usually come back until the afternoon.”
She smiled and pecked both children on the head before walking briskly away, and her footfalls could be heard faintly on the staircase.
“Love you too, Malfoy.”
“It’s so soft…”
Harry led him downstairs to the mess hall, and was glowered at by 90% of the paintings that hung on the walls. One of them even twirled knife at him.
“I’ve just received an owl from Roache.”
Harry’s hopped off the bed and is ruffling through a drawer of Ron’s chest, coming back with a long piece of parchment from his own. He lays it flat on the lapdesk that sits next to his pillow and holds a muggle ballpoint pen, waiting, hovering above the page.
Draco's hand slips from Harry's grip, and tears threaten to spill over his long lashes.
"What, don't like what you see?"
Harry almost choked on the bluntness.
"Dracoo? Are you in there?"
“Are we done yet?”
it was-and the enchanted walls reached farther than what seemed possible. It wasn’t
Draco rolled his eyes.
“To be fair, you did it to me first. And then you took all my blades. And now, you refuse to leave me alone for prolonged periods of-“
His hand was up by the side of the camera to turn it on, and he dropped it back into his lap. Harry’s heart lurched when he realised he was in the attic. In
Harry crossed the room and sat down next to him.
He handed the wizard an earbud, and levitated the phone so that they both could watch, casting a growth charm so that the screen expanded to the size of a television. It didn’t work quite the way he’d wanted it to, since it still had the same number of pixels and the result was a shitty-quality video. The blonde didn’t seem to mind, though, and much to his chagrin, Draco soon found himself laughing at the buffoons on screen.
Draco just shook his head, concluding that it would take at least thirty trunks to pack up just his wardrobe.
“Yeah, but this is more than usual.”
The Malfoy family was on-screen now, looking youthful. A cake floated onto the table and a little girl blew out the candles on a small chocolate cake. Something was odd about her, though. Her hair was as bright blonde as any Malfoy, but it was black at the roots, as if it had been bleached, or the charm keeping it blonde was wearing off. Lucius stood stiffly behind Draco, a hand on his shoulder. Narcissa helped the girl cut her cake, just the way muggles did. Lucius obviously didn’t approve but he watched as the girl and her mother’s hands both held the knife and cut it unevenly.
"Sure. Can't guarantee that I'll stop, though."
Draco’s head snapped back to where Harry was pouring coffee from a carafe.
Draco struggled to battle the Lucius inside him, his sneering and violent whispers, reminding him of what he was waiting for when he got home, when this was finally over. He thought often about what he’d do. He could run off with Harry, be flatmates, as the two had not-so-jokingly joked. For a moment, he contemplated how upset he was going to feel about being disinherited as he knew he would, but then he remembered.
He considered this, then sipped the brew placidly.
Harry's eyes were glassy, the damage in front of him overwhelming. Draco sighed, regaining his strength.
"What?"
“I don’t-I don’ t want to.”
By the time it was over, Draco was a sobbing mess and they were both covered in sweat and blood.
"Mm?"
“Oh my-he told me it happened when he took on a troll in the dark forest one night, when he and you had gone to collect bark for a potion. He said you were attacked by some...creature. Said he got it protecting you.”
He squeaked.
and tired of you doing this Draco! You’re not-you’re not only impacting yourself!”
“And I don’t want to have to drag your arse to Hogsmeade on my own so c’mon, up you go.”
"Just...okay?"
He peeled himself from the floor, grimacing at the new blood.
Draco nearly withered beneath his gaze.
Harry rubbed his eyes.
"Nope."
Draco smiled genially and held his hand out for a shake, just to be a prat.
“Sounds good.”
"I know."
The boys had assumed nobody was up yet, but they found Hermione-and
"It's alright." Harry smiled. "Remember when you used to hate me?" He mused.
“They call me a hero, and I believed them. I believed all of it, that I was meant to save the world, that I was
Hermione just smiled.
"You what?"
He grinned.
The pale wizard clutched his wand, shivering.
"Where have you been?" Ron asked loudly.
Draco held his mouth open to speak.
He stood.
She just grimaced and shook his hand as quickly as she could before storming after Harry, who she found pouring himself a glass of chocolate milk.
“Yeah, but it isn’t, is it? You’re still planning on going back, aren’t you.”
"Why do you think, Potter?"
"Yeah."
“Holy fuck.”
“Draco? You in here?”
Harry hesitated, but told him anyway. The puddle did not shrink one bit.
She cocks her head.
"I'm doing the assignment," he quipped, sliding a notebook and a recipe toward Malfoy.
"Draco, when was the last time you ate?"
"Cru-FUCK! Cruc-crnnnnnnnnNNNCRUCIO!"
"I doubt you're keen on allowing me to continue."
“You’re hyperventilating. I know it’s hard but I need you to breathe with me. In, and out. In, and out.”
“Right…”
“Good morning, Hermione.” he said.
”What about your parents?”
“Then why?”
violation of privacy!”
“Facts, Harry.”
"This is casual!"
“I wish you wouldn’t do this…”
“Stop, Roache, you’re fine. Have a seat. And a biscuit.”
"Oh please. Like that's ever gonna happen. No, I'm just getting bored of this."
“Right...well, I was thinking…”
The elf didn’t miss a beat, and had his arms around Draco’s shoulders in seconds.
“C’mon.”
His tone still bit, though.
"You'd be surprised what a galleon and a box of chocolate frogs will get you in year six."
"Sure-but you know I'll just be sleeping on your couch all the time."
He'd hardly made it to the bottom of the staircase before he heard the shouting.
“Do you want me to tell him?” Harry asked gently, and the nod he felt against his damp chest told him to proceed.
He was met with a glare from a year seven kid downstairs on the couch as he apparated back outside of Draco's bedroom door. He took a moment to notice how comparatively darker it was here, in the Slytherin tower. Dark and brooding. He snapped out of it, hearing a noise on the other side of the door.
"I can't believe they did that to you..."
Harry's cheeks went beet-red, and he regarded the passing thought of hurling himself out the stained glass window to his left with a
Draco shrugged.
Harry grinned wildly.
The broken wizard walked to the centre of the room and sighed, wand in hand. He wriggled out of his shirt and levitated it wordlessly to where his robe sat, and Harry noticed the scars on his back. They formed a large X, like someone had flogged him with a spiked whip. His chest was already littered with bruises and scars, and it looked like someone had...like someone had carved words into his skin. It was impossible to make out what they said, though, in the dimly lit room.
That was a lie. Twenty-three, that was the number of times he’d seen the inner working of his wrist and bathed the attic in blood. Twenty-three times he’d lain gasping on the dusty floorboards, lungs punctured and sight blackening as he desperately tried to fix his father’s mess, cursing him with every
"Oh, so it's like a...like a play?"
He put his wand down and sat next to the broken boy, helping him take off his shirt.
"Apparently, you do. How do I know you're not going to...curse yourself again?"
"Or, at least, someone from outside. You know how it is."
"I've got to put on my pyjamas."
He was broken out of his reverie by something heard off-camera, and quickly magicked the blood out of his clothes. He turned to the chair, but left it dirty. The camera was left rolling.
“What?”
“Harry?” He whined.
Draco adjusted himself in his seat.
“Have you seriously never run away before?”
“No.”
"You need to, Draco. For me. Please."
Once they’d gotten settled, Draco said he was going to make sure the door was locked-
“What, Petunia?”
“Would you like me to take the luggage?”
The warm water of the shower hit his chest and washed away the crusted over vomit that had settled in the dip of his collarbones. Expert hands were at his back again, now slippery and smelling faintly of chrysanthemums.
"What does yeet mean?"
“It’s alright. Means you can take off your seat belt.”
“You alright?” A faint smirk was evident across his lips.
Draco just fakes a chuckle.
“What does that mean? Why is it
"Thanks, by the way. For being so cool about me and Draco."
"Sorry, I don't know what...I'm sorry."
Casting a silencing charm under his breath, Harry ran up behind the boy and barely made it into the room before the doors swung shut behind them both. The Room was dark and bare, and he watched from the corner as Draco shrugged his robe off and sat on the floor. A platter of food floated down to him from the ceiling, but he waved it aside.
Harry watches the bubbling liquid in the cast-iron cauldron, a pinkish purple in hue.
Yet as the episode progressed, Draco found himself looking over Harry's shoulder, who sighed and rolled over on the bed to face him.
“God-no, I just don’t want you at your worst, plastered on papers across Europe and
He nodded and slid down along the dishwasher to the flagstone floor with his legs folded beneath him and the ice cream in his lap. He sent a spoon flying at Harry, but it only bounced off his chest and back onto the floor with a clatter that made him wince.
A muffled whimper and the distinct sound of Narcissa’s heels on the ceramic floor sent shivers down Harry’s spine. The children looked at each other nervously, and Hecatia put a hand over Draco’s.
"What do I do, Hedwig?"
“When you realised I wasn’t her.”
Draco was full-on sobbing now, and the gryffindor inched closer apprehensively just to have the troubled wizard practically fling himself at him. He sobbed into his chest, and Roache made eye contact with Harry over Draco’s shoulder, his face unreadable.
“Fine.”
Harry gulped and his right hand shook as he sat down again, putting his tremorring hand to use by knotting up grass.
"You know you’re hideous either way," he muttered. Harry barely heard it. But he still did, and winced.
"She died trying to-oh god..."
“Yeah.”
"You need to stop...doing this to yourself!"
His hands were replaced with Harry’s, and he realised that it was far more practical this way, given that Potter wasn’t functioning like a man whose muscles had atrophied and had developed Parkinson’s over the last eight minutes. He seriously pondered this before coming to the conclusion that neither Parkinson’s nor severe muscle atrophy occurred in that short of a time span.
Soft groans to his right, Harry saw Malfoy's crumpled form shaking, and he got up slowly.
Draco rested his forehead in his hand.
Harry was not allowed to see the check at the end. Finchley popped the trunk and helped them load up the bags, and within a matter of minutes they were at the condo’s doorstep, where they got out and Finchley started carrying the it all inside. Draco insisted on helping. He left a single bag behind,  basically his way of trying to make Harry feel less useless, but also
“I-I don’t-“
Harry continued unbuttoning to see the rest of the gauze that wrapped round his stomach.
"Ugh."
“Of course.”
“He took her. I’d sent her home to deliver a letter to Aunt Petunia and I
“I guess I would’ve died. And I’d have been okay with that.”
His head snapped up.
Draco felt something cold and heavy in his chest, as if he’d swallowed a rock.
Draco nodded.
"As are you."
"I mean-you're slowly killing yourself! How do you not get that? If you keep-"
He reached for his wand and remembered that he’d left his overcoat in the Gryffindor tower.
“Mhmm.”
"Potter, why are you here? I've got homework."
Harry gave him a funny look.
Ron chuckled.
“I love you so much, Draco.”
He clicked his tongue and Hermione giggled and slunk to the kitchenette.
Draco opened the cabinet, searching for the shaving razor his mother had bought him.
The pale boy slunk into the room silently and took his seat in the very back, looking his usual worn-out self. Harry cocked his head in concern, eyeing him across the room. Slughorn droned on about the practical use of medicated potions and the class remained only half-awake.
"What are they-Harry what?" He laughed.
Harry smiled.
“Harry it’s alright. We’re fine. This is far less dangerous than a broom.”
And Harry had never, in all his years seen a house elf raise their voice at their master. It was jarring, but a pleasant display of equality.
Harry’s watch beeped obnoxiously and he fished the strainer out of the pot.
Draco frowned.
“You’ve got me.”
“Draco?” The voice was so soft yet husky, so
“Are you serious?”
Fear fluttered about in Harry’s stomach because Draco
"What? Potter, I don't need a babysitter."
"Oh."
“It’s
"Oh."
He laughed humorlessly, tossed his wand in the air and caught it, chewing through his lip.
"He wanted me to kill you. I couldn't do it."
His voice was wet. Draco frowned and turned around, seeing how glassy his eyes were.
The contrast was jarring. The video went from family christmas to the camera being hidden again, Lucius beating Draco bloody. Roache ran forward to intercede and was sent flying against a wall. Four minutes and six broken ribs later, Harry turned off the telly, holding his stomach just as Lucius was about to hit Draco with another Cruciatus.
The brunette’s eyes widened.
“Thank god his father isn’t around for this. He’d have...it wouldn’t have been good. The man was worse than you remember. Poor Dray could never catch a break.”
"It killed her.”
"Oh. Alright."
Draco was the one to break it off.
“Well, what can you do.” He muttered and pulled himself to his feet with the ice cream in his hand. It fell to the floor once he reached about seventy-percent of his full height and he immediately thrust a hand out to meet the cold countertop, bracing his weight against it until his head no longer felt like it had up and floated away.
She continued crying and Draco maintained his stoic expression, ran a hand comfortingly through her hair.
“A great deal.”
“Damn right I am,” Draco growled, and Hedwig scuffled around in Harry’s lap.
“Hey you guys, uh...I’ve been trying to give you space so you guys can sleep in me and Ron’s room but umm...I don’t really know how to say this without sounding like a jerk-I mean, I know I’m not being a jerk, I just-“
"Oh," he whispers softly. Harry rolled up the sleeve to see the wizard's fleshing in ribbons, gaping.
The brunette hopped onto the bed and under the covers, eliciting a groan from Draco.
“Sorry…”
The second, was the word
He clamped his mouth shut and booked it down the hall, then promptly threw up in the toilet.
“About how bad you’d gotten?”
“Good morning Mister Malfoy. Can I get you anything? A cuppa, perhaps?”
Draco smirked and checked his watch.
Draco shook his head.
Draco felt a twinge of disgust in himself as he realised that he should be sad. The man who brought him into this wretched world and who cared for him up until the ripe old age of six…
Harry looked at him incredulously.
"Fifteen seconds!"
The pale boy just stared at Harry. His unruly hair, his wiry glasses. He reached up to touch the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, making him flinch in fear, then shiver pleasantly.
The wizard sighed happily in a ‘what can you do? Love him to pieces, though’ sort of way and nodded.
By the time the boys arrive, the sun has slipped downward in the heavens and little ivory flakes drift down from above. Draco shivered under his own jacket and Harry’s old Burberry scarf wrapped tightly round his neck. Draco offered to replace it on multiple occasions, but he’d refused. It had been his mother’s. He didn’t like to talk about it. Draco did, though, insist on using a reweaving spell to fix the moth holes.
“Hey, Draco? Breakfast is ready.”
the young wizard reassured himself, yet his nerves still jangled. Harry glanced over to the calendar on the wall.
There’s silence, and Draco panicked for a moment.
“it’s
, not
"I deserve this..." he croaked.
“I take pleasure in the little things,” he said.
"W-what's wrong?" Draco just shook his head.
He made a mental note to make sure it didn’t get to the point of muscle degradation, because guess which vital organ is made of muscle?
"Erm...I had a handful of almonds yesterday."
Harry smirked.
"Run along. I'll see you there," she said.
"I-I honestly-well, to be fair, you and I have very different definitions of a 'full meal'."
“As you wish, Mrs. Haversham.”
"No, you're-you're kind of right."
Harry smiled proudly.
Draco smiled, and let his head grow heavy.
The boy just smiled.
“Well...what if I hadn’t? Did you even have a plan? I mean, you could’ve died, and you put that all on a hunch that I might be in the room.”
“That isn’t the point, Potter!”
Draco asked. The woman seemed as if she were about to cry, looking down at her son.
"I love you too," it said.
"Oh, come on-you know that's not gonna happen."
Harry snuggled up to him under the comforter and rested his head on his shoulder, arms around his waist, listening to the click of the window repairing itself.
"Why?"
"I-Draco...I'm so sorry..."
He balanced it on his finger, inspecting the ornate carvings. It was an expensive one too. More importantly, it worked really well, and was excellently weighted.
His stomach churned as Draco told the driver they wouldn’t be long, and he turned his weathered key in the lock. The door opened with a foreboding creak and the boys were met with a tired-looking Aunt Petunia storming out from the kitchen. She clopped toward them an raised an eyebrow at Draco standing slender and serious behind Harry.
Fifteen minutes later, Harry was fast asleep and Draco was watching the screen saver on the TV. Generic drone shots of the desert, of a forest, of Dubai...
"Remember? I'm coming everywhere with you now."
"What?"
"I want to, I just...memories. I guess."
“Oh! Hello. I’m just packing.”
“Please. I raised that boy. It’s my business.”
“Can I get you anything?”
At that, Vernon launched himself at Harry and landed a few punches, only because Draco’s wand was caught on the lining of his pocket before he was levitated to the middle of the living room.
“It’s fine, nevermind.”
So Harry ran downstairs and pulled out his map, his heart racing when he saw the location.
“What?”
He only got a glare from the raven-haired young man across him, the young man who, Draco noted, looked absolutely ravishing in that jumper he’d picked out.
He tapped a rhythm on his kneecap and stood, far too quickly. Grabbing hold of the bedpost for balance, he made a decision.
Not seven minutes later, he slipped away mid-sentence, and Draco watched him over the frames of his sunglasses.
"What's this?"
Harry yawned in reply and squeezed his eyes shut when Draco tilted the screen toward him.
“What if the wrong people got their hands on those?”
"Slytherins."
Harry gasped in pain, and Draco was reminded that
He shook, a single tear slipping down his porcelain cheek. They were flushed now, pinkish capillaries and ashen skin. He wiped it away vigorously.
"Pardon?"
"Many people. Can't say I blame them, really."
“Nn-nn.”
The wizard squeezed his eyes shut, waiting.
The elf moved his gnarled hand over the lettering on Draco’s stomach, but it wasn’t healing.
“As long as you trust me.”
“Nothing. How bad has he gotten?”
The look in his eyes broke Harry's heart.
“Just putting the top down. Unless you don’t want to…”
stop to think that maybe I like the pain? That maybe, I'm fine on my own? That I don't need you to save me?"
"With any luck, he'll give you the punishment you deserve."
Harry had never been on a jet.
“Well, I’m going to get some biscuits. If this is what you think you need, then I’ll support you.”
Draco didn’t bother arguing.
“What would have happened, had you been a muggle? Had you not been able to heal it all? How many times would you have died by now? How many times have you reached the point of no return and come back, only because you’ve got a magic bloody wand?”
“No, I need to see this.”
he thought.
“Bloody hell, Draco. What now?”
Draco chuckled, ashamed that he was enjoying Potter’s admiration just a little bit, even if he couldn’t at all take credit for the place. He knew it was a magnificent home, but all he could think was
Hermione smirked.
"What's a Smith?"
; she thought it sounded exotic.
His voice dies in his throat, and Draco clamped back on his Malfoy Mask.
The pale wizard’s mildly betrayed scowl lessened a bit at the end, and he smirked.
His large hazel eyes met Draco’s and the emotion in them was practically heart-wrenching.
She sat up in her chair and poured herself more tea.
The small boy was lying on the ground, blood dripping from his nose and staining his teeth red. He smiled.
He nodded.
couple and then we’ll go home and I’ll deal with it. Alright?”
The fjord glittered as it greedily ate up the snow that coated everyone’s shoulders like frozen dandruff.
"I know. I'm sorry you have to deal with me."
Draco cried, and the defeat in his eyes made Harry crumple. He promptly stood up and walked around to the other side of the bed, plucked the chocolate from Draco’s grasp and wrapped him in a hug, the pale wizard sobbing into him for the second time that night.
“What, why are you looking at me like that? Is something the matter?” the blonde asked, tossing a couple of pairs of socks into a compartment.
"Draco!"
Four weeks had passed since Potter had infiltrated his life, his bed. His mind.
"Shut. Up."
His eyes adjusted to the light, and there was a picture of himself at five years old displayed on the screen.
"Misfaci"
“Draco. I fought to save my own skin. I didn’t give a rat’s ass whether Snape lived. Or you. Or anyone else in this blasted school, aside from Ron and Hermione. And I failed to protect them, too. So what I’m trying to say is...I’m not some saint you have to repent to. I know that’s terribly presumptious of me, but...you know what I mean. I’m just as bad as you, only more cowardly. Don’t forget, you offered me your hand at the beginning of all this. I turned you down.”
Harry faltered.
“You mean-his left canine?”
“Hi.”
The hours wasted away playing UNO and reminiscing. Because they were mature young people who took themselves very seriously, and UNO is in no way a children's game.
Draco rolled his eyes and continued taking his mouse-sized bites.
The young wizard woke up in his bed, his whole body sore. A horrible pain erupted in his ribs and he screeched like a wounded owl, clutching the sheets.
“I’m not at imminent risk. Let’s just have a normal dinner, like a
“I’m Harry.”
"I told him I was sorry, but it never was enough."
“But I hurt you,” he whispered.
He fiddled with the crown of his watch and waited.
stuttered.
He spat his own last name with such malice, it was almost shocking. Almost.
Draco smiled gently and kindly-something Harry had never seen-and took up the recipe.
“Why should I let labels govern my life? I say, liberate the salad from its “side dish” status. Let it be a full salad.”
Sooo I fucked up. If you read the last chapter (i deleted it) forget about it, I uploaded it too early. Please leave comments!
“A happy little accident?” He croaked.
"No it's not! Harry I get that we're supposed to be all chummy after the war but-but not
“Because I can.”
“She’s g-gone, father. And it’s my fault, it’s all my fault. It should’ve been me, should’ve been me...”
He nodded and wiped the tears that had gathered in his eyes.
"Oh," is all he could come up with.
“What for?”
"Wait no no no-"
"Mione! Sorry, I was ju-"
“There are more,” he croaked.
“Was it Vernon?” Draco asked cautiously.
Harry just groaned something about
"Right. Sorry."
The talk continued and eventually Draco deemed himself no longer too weepy to speak. His idea was to let the house rot, to buy Roache some clothes and send him off with a few thousand galleons. Roache declined politely, saying that this was his home and he’d like to die here, thank you very much. They’d eventually settled on giving him new clothes anyway and allowing him to leave and do whatever it is house elves do. Roache agreed to live there and take care of the manor.
when his nose popped back into the right position.
Harry smiled and hugged him fiercely.
“Who was it, Draco?”
“I don’t feel bad that you’ve done...that you do these things to yourself. I didn’t make you do it, I’m trying as hard as humanly possible to
Her hands shook with the slightest trepidation, as if she was unsure of her position. Had she crossed a line?
“What do you mean?”
“Harry, we need to talk about this.”
“Yeah. We’re at about...twelve-and-a-half thousand metres.”
The pale boy smiled.
“Draco?”
“Erm-yeah, I downloaded it from all the family pictures that were on a disk drive from my old house.”
"Anyhow...I'm off. Go join your friends-you must be hungry."
The boy grinned.
"Well," He sighed, and shifted himself over to face him.
“Mhmm.”
lacking in the ‘wear’ department.”
"I know."
“Hey, erm...Harry, have you seen my coat? It wasn’t on the couch downstairs…”
“Boys!”
He banged his head loudly on the doorframe of the small cupboard and held his forehead as he emerged. She cringed.
“No, I’ve just been thinking. About when I found you in the Room of Requirement.”
"Oh Merlin, not you too."
“Draco, isn’t Harrods, like-“
Draco just smiled at the menu.
him-I don't-"
“I’m not lying!”
“Okay. Well, how old were you when you became a death eater?”
The boy stopped at the door.
Harry shook his head.
The pale wizard frowned.
"H-hurts, Harry.
“You’re absolutely ridiculous.”
and promptly threw up for the second time that night in the farthest toilet from his bedroom.
Harry just shook his head.
Draco rifled through his drawers and tied a few socks together, then wrapped them tightly around his waist. He climbed into a pair of joggers and a long sleeved shirt, throwing a big wool sweater over it for good measure. Harry eyed him a little suspiciously once he emerged, but walked back to the red and gold common room without complaint. The fat lady in the painting glowered at Draco. The minute he crossed the threshold, he felt...wrong. It was hard to explain, but hairs stood up on his neck and rubbed uncomfortably against the fabric of his henley. The place smelled like food, like people, like...humanity, but not in the weird way. It smelled orange. Stepping into the Slytherin building smelled of nothing but drywall and a hint of bitter licorice. This place, though…he wasn’t sure whether he loved or hated it. It was like the difference between coming into someone’s home, and taking a tour through one of those model houses. Harry sat on his bed and started writing his potions essay on a mangled piece of parchment. It was warm in the room, and Draco slipped his heavy wool sweater onto an empty bed, his bare feet cushioned by the carpeted floor.
He stood up himself and was headed towards the staircase when Roache appeared to his right.
"Oh Draco..."
One was a Bentley-the same model as the one Finchley had driven in London, a few years old. Behind it was an Audi, and a man who looked like Dwayne Johnson if he weren’t The Rock was climbing out, the engine having roared to life. He smiled and walked out to meet them.
Dear Merlin, what
Which, apparently, wonderfully, spectacularly, had been always.
“Whose accidents?” Potter demanded. Somehow, he knew exactly what question to ask to unravel Draco’s whole story. He knew Draco
“I’m—I—but, has anyone suspicious been by the house recently
Instead, he felt a weight lift off his chest that he hadn’t known he’d been carrying. He wanted to tell Draco he loved him again and again for the rest of his life.
Yes, he agreed. Draco did know him. And, finally, Harry knew Draco, too. That was definitely what mattered most of all.
“I don't want to pressure you,” Harry said. He found himself repeating the words Draco had directed at him earlier. “You don’t have to say anything. You’re clearly overwhelmed as it is, so I won’t force it. And... I'm in no rush.”
Except, he did know the reason. When Draco drank the antidote, he would remember, and then Harry would lose this. Whatever this was. He would lose it the moment he’d finally gotten it.
Although the war was over and the Slytherins had largely abandoned their assholery, Draco Malfoy decidedly had not. Yes, he acted with relatively good manners around most people now, but he never dropped his incendiary behaviour with Harry. It was like he was incapable of ignoring Harry, or even of curbing his constant need to provoke him. Perhaps that was just Malfoy’s predestined role in Harry’s life: to get insufferably under his skin.
, for the first half of class, I would like you all to brew your own Base Potions. Then, I will add my own ingredients, and I would like you to identify what I have added based on the effect your potion takes.”
“I can’t believe I’m seeing this!”
“Well, stop believing it! And stop looking at me like that!”
The first time Potter invited Granger and Weasley to join them, Draco almost got sick. However, Potter put a hand on his and told him it would be all right, and his friends would be happy to spend an evening with them. Although Potter soon retracted his hand, the memory of its scorching touch distracted Draco into keeping up a flowing conversation with Potter’s friends, and Draco actually survived the ordeal.
However, the tests found nothing. No spells on Potter, no potions, no brain trauma.
One late night all their paperwork from the office ended up piled on the sofa Potter usually slept on, so Draco assured him it would be all right if Potter slept in his own bed. Potter beamed, certainly having missed the familiar comfort of the mattress Draco had been stealing.
“I hate you,” he informed him, two seconds away from reeling back to punch him in the jaw. “I was actually starting to think, with a cock like that, maybe I could learn to tolerate your personality. But no, you’re every bit as repulsive as you were in school. If you think I’m going to work on any cases with you ever again, you’re so monumentally stupid it’s
Harry checked the nearby doors, until he heard a familiar voice.
“Right, sorry gramps.”
Harry gasped, and Draco hated that he relished the sound.
he said, gesturing to the ratty blue jeans and hoodie he’d had changed into upstairs.
"This is our last year here. I was hoping he'd let me stay with him whilst I figure things out."
"Tergeo."
He grunted in confusion and tried again. The boy just shook his head.
"We should get going-it's nearly lunchtime."
A be-ringed hand grabbed him by the collar.
Narcissa’s slender fingers gently grazed the marks on her neck, and she dropped them immediately.
“Yeah.”
"Mhmm."
He lifted the towel and grimaced at the gash, still seeping rivulets.
“Someone’s on the walk of shame…” She teased, but seemed surprised at Draco’s perfectly groomed form in the doorway when she looked up.
"Alright, one minute!" Slughorn announced. Harry started sweating.
“Why didn’t you use magic?” Harry asked.
Harry’s stomach churned.
"Tergeo," he sighed, tossing the towels and his wand aside.
any formal wear.”
"Why do you think, Potter."
"Yeah...she's exhausted..." he said, brushing her hair behind her ear.
"Right then."
“Why?”
“Draco.”
"Alohomora!" The door swung open.
His arms dropped to his sides, then rested over Harry’s on his stomach.
He expected Harry to be disappointed and he was, but a slight smile also bloomed across his cheeks.
"Okay guys, we should really-blimey, it's two o'clock."
The blonde wizard took a miniscule dagger and snapped off the handle. Squeezing his eyes shut, he plunged it diagonally into his gut, and the pain etched itself on his forehead. Panting and sweating, Draco muttered an anti-bleeding spell and wrapped some gauze around his stomach feverishly.
Harry took this as their cue to leave.
Harry's face went bright red.
His mother,
The pale boy gently shook his head, wincing.
Silence and sniffles.
“In here,” came a soft voice and he followed it to a door behind him. Malfoy had not one but two rooms, the one he walked into being a small library/office of sorts, with two matching couches that were about half the size of a normal one and the walls lined with books.
“The fallout from that must not have been fun,” he commented.
Draco grinned.
He grinned.
Harry used magic to slide Draco over just a few inches to give them both space, the sickly boy cringing in pain.
“Yes, would you? There’s not much space, I’m afraid.”
“Are you
The young wizard shook out his cramped hand, and Draco mentally added that to the list.
and the door at the end of the cabin opened to reveal a kindly young woman. The stewardess.
“Right, I’m coming with you.”
“I’m still mad we couldn’t just take our brooms.”
“Neither do I.”
“Draco, what is it?”
With Lucius, it was rather straightforward. Draco lost him years ago, bade goodbye to “daddy” and hello to “father.”
"Yes, yes..."
he thought, not wanting to leave him alone for too long.
It was as if Harry could hear him breaking.
"It's a good thing," is all he said, and poured Draco some more jasmine tea.
"You look awful."
Hermione laid a hand on his.
The boy nods.
The boys rushed out of the door. One of them stopped, reaching out his wand to hex the poor wizard one last time. Harry snatched it and snapped the wand over his knee, tossing the broken pieces out into the hall.
“One twenty-four.”
“Yes, Harry. A couple.”
but he was absolutely terrified that someone he knew so poorly could read him with such ease.
He shook his head.
“I’m going to have a rinse.”
“Yes! That.” The slytherin grinned obliviously and threw another rock into the river, and Harry thought that maybe his stomach churned even more than the water did.
“That
"Acerbo," he muttered. The pain intensified, setting his whole body alight.
“Me too.”
The pale wizard sipped his coffee thoughtfully, letting the bitter taste engulf him. The steady scraping noise of Harry’s silverware stopped and he looked over.
“Draco, they left us chocolates!” Harry cried. Draco put the receiver to his shoulder.
Harry gulped.
Shouting could be heard.
“The...green one?”
“What’s this?”
He nodded his head in the direction of the remaining tapes in the box by the TV set and the slytherin shuddered.
Draco smiled and returned to his seat.
Draco held the passenger door for him and shut it a little too eagerly, crossing around the front to his side and pressing the button to lower the roof.
Draco’s bony hand took his own and the VCR hummed back to life.
“Yeah.”
"That's not true."
Vernon was practically boiling.
They ate in silence until Harry spoke.
She nodded.
The slytherin was wrapped in a tight hug, and Harry just sobbed.
“I think I’ll drive back. Oh, by the way, Jameson, this is Harry. Harry, Jameson.”
“Shit.”
The two remained there for a while before Draco helped Narcissa to her feet.
“Harry?”
He held the delicate wand up to the light and whispered.
There was a certain tightness in the corner of his eyes that unnerved Harry.
The bellman arrived with their luggage only two minutes later, apologising for the wait. Apparently there was some sort of a mix-up...it wasn’t important. He helped them remove their things from the cart and went on his way, and Draco put their cases in the closet. He’d unpack them later.
"What?? What is it?"
He just stared at the sheets,
Ron stretches and yawns. Harry knew he didn’t believe him-
"True."
"I-I did."
“Oh I really don’t want one now.”
"Can I stay here?"
“Or...you could summon them. And destroy them. And I wouldn’t need to see them at all. If you want.”
“Fine.”
He pulled away and looked him in the eyes.
The word
Harry slid gracefully up to his feet and held a hand to Draco’s forehead.
“You put that down, Harry. That’s Dudley’s milk.”
“That, I don’t know
“Nothing, it’s nothing...I’m nothing…” he mouthed the last part but they both knew.
He shook his head.
He'd thought nothing of it-he'd surely be at potions. Malfoy loved potions.
"I let you down, I let you all down...and then she died. And it's-it's all m-my fault..."
but...whenever we duelled, it was never for
“You seemed disappointed.”
Harry disappeared into the bathroom, and Draco poked the wound.
The usual.
Harry looked at him with these-these
Roache waited a few seconds after the man was gone before running over to help.
"Nobody you know. They're year sixes."
"Stabbing-" he winces. "Stabbing hex."
Harry thought.
Potter froze.
Potter opened a door and a bed came into view, and the sight of Potter’s bed shocked Draco into blurting out, “Potter, something is wrong. You have clearly been cursed, or poisoned, or you’re hallucinating, or…”
“Yeah. But instead, I was propositioning you against
Madam Pomfrey pushed through the crowd suddenly, followed by Professor Slughorn. “What are all of you doing here? Go on, shoo! And—good heavens, what are you two doing on the floor?”
“I—I do,” Draco said. Potter was so close. One arm rested on the pillow next to Draco’s head. The other was down between their groins, hand presumably holding Potter’s cock and lining it up. “Want you s-so bad, come on.” He felt hot all over. He had never imagined he’d be here, not outside of sex dreams and fantasies that had hurt his heart because they’d never come true. “Please.”
Harry tore up his napkin under the table restlessly.
Slughorn continued his announcement. “The materials I have had you gather comprise a standard Base Potion. As I am sure you all read for homework, this potion acts as a carrier for other ingredients. Wizarding families often store it in their homes in case of emergency, at which time they add whatever final components they wish. This way, they can have a quick and accessible potion for common household needs, and it will stay fresh for whenever they decide to use it. Can someone name a typical—oh, yes, Miss Granger?”
Neville nodded along. “The Slytherins are right panicked, too. I heard they’re all crowded in there with him, and he just keeps staring like he’s never seen ’em before in his life.”
One day Draco asked why he never saw Potter bring anyone home, and Potter outright laughed. “Who else would I bring home?”
Draco’s heart plummeted down so far he was almost surprised it didn’t make a sound as it hit the floor. “Why not?”
“I said I’m going to fuck you,” Potter replied, voice dropping about an octave. “Long and slow, gonna make you scream, and beg, and make you come so hard you pass out, and when you wake up I’ll be holding you.”
At last, he replied, “Does this have to do with the man I saw on my way here, with the blond hair and the odd face that was rubbing off in the mist? Whom I sent away?”
“What the hell, Potter?" Was he determined to make Draco relive every terrible moment of his life? "I paralysed you, broke your nose, and covered you with your invisibility cloak. And I loved every fucking moment of—”
“You wanna skip first period?”
“What?! No-!”
He chose their regular spot in the back corner, constructed from the view of those who entered. Draco slumped into the chair furthest away with a sigh. Why did his life have to be so difficult? It was times like these that he wished he had never met Blaise. A horrible thought despite what he's put him through, as he was and annoyingly still is large part of his life. A lump grew in his throat and he swallowed it down, not allowing himself to get upset over something he's already gotten over. Or so he thought.
Draco woke to sharp knocking on his front door. He lifted his head in confusion, sleep and leftover tears sealing his eyes shut. He rubbed at them, grabbing his phone and checking the time.
Draco opened his mouth, the girl's eyes narrowing as if to say "
The boy jumped in surprise, turning to look at him, but he had walked away before Draco could say anything. The two girls with him didn't seem to notice, too caught up in whatever conversation they were having. Harry smiled, fighting the urge to turn around and see Draco's reaction, walking into class.
Draco finished up in the shower, towel drying his hair and body before dressing himself in his hoodie and jeans. By the time he was ready, it was already well past six, meaning he could just head to school early. He told the girls he was leaving, earning whines and hums goodbye. He rolled his eyes, grabbing his keys off his desk and leaving the apartment.
"He was the one who asked us, you know."
He hopped out of the car and closed the door, only to be stopped by a voice, “Wait! Give me your number so we can talk.”
Pansy nodded eagerly, so fast it looked as if her head would roll off her shoulders. Hermione giggled, her eyes twinkling in amusement. Draco relayed the events in order, leaving out only the minor details. He soon arrived at the embarrassing part, his face heating at the very thought of it.
"Harry—"
“Well…” Draco trailed off, collecting his thoughts before speaking, “For one, we basically came out to the entire school this morning,”
"And I wanted to say...that I really like you. For a while now actually." Harry continued, rubbing his thumb subconsciously on the back of Draco's hand. "I was wondering..."

Harry rounded the car, hopping into his own seat and turning the key in the ignition. “Where are we going?”
"Your nose is adorable, and I love your lips.” Harry pecked them quickly, earning a small smile from Draco. “Your smile is so beautiful, and I wish I could see it more.” The blonde chewed on his bottom lip to stop himself from smiling largely. Harry reached over and ran his fingers through Draco's blonde fringe, moving it from his forehead. "Even your hair is amazing.”
“Alright. Let’s head somewhere quieter.” Harry yelled back, grabbing the ginger by the arm and dragging him towards the long hallway by the back door. The bass resonated in the walls, though it was far quieter than before. Harry let Ron go, though quickly regaining his hold when he stumbled. “You good?”
“Why, what happened?” Harry’s eyebrows furrowed, concern lacing his voice. Draco hesitated; of course, he didn’t want to lie, but did he really want to reveal so much too soon?
"Sure, why not?" Harry said, shrugging. "It's a bit of a private place, not many know about it. And you always look good to me." His cheeky smile making Draco’s heart flutter. He looked away, his face making tomatoes pale in comparison.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows, crossing his arms over his chest, feeling impossibly worse. “What? Why are you laughing?”
“Just some family problems,” Draco went with instead, “The usual. What about you?”
An idea struck him, Draco’s heart swelling at the very thought.
“And as much as you think your personality is shitty—don’t think I don’t know—I think it’s fantastic. You try to hide behind this sarcastic persona, but I
“Would you rather I wasn’t?” The corner Harry’s lips quirked up slightly into a small smile. Draco turned around and looked up at him, scoffing,
"You just what?" Draco spoke slowly and calmly. Harry stared directly into Draco's gray-blue eyes with a ferocity that chilled his very core.
“Of course.” Draco smiled, leaning up and kissing him on the cheek. “Love you.”
“Well, Draco,” A deep familiar voice remarked from the front doorway, “I’m not quite sure that’s exactly true. I
Harry agreed, of course. The blonde made a note to just talk to his friends later.
He quickly made it to his next class and sat in his usual seat, conveniently behind Harry. Speaking, more like thinking, of Harry, Draco thought about his so-called date with the boy; whether he chose to believe Pansy or not he wasn’t sure, but he would have to find out himself.
Draco reached a hand up and cupped Harry’s cheek, unable to help himself. Draco smiled sadly, though it trembled and fell, a few tears slipping down his face. Harry leaned into the touch, wanting nothing more than to grab it and hold it in his. “I love you, Draco. Please…don’t forget it.”
“You can’t just–“ Harry stopped, scoffing in disbelief. He shook his head regardless, smiling and kissing Draco one last time on the lips. “I love you too.”
An hour went by in no time, the bell due to ring in roughly thirty minutes. He closed the book as he finished, standing to but it back. Finding the correct aisle, he reached up to put it in place, but was interrupted when something, or someone, walked into him. The boy looked up from whatever it was he had in his hand in surprise, eyes wide. Harry stared, the realization that a cute boy just walked into him. A
it said in mock-niceness.
thick skull that being gay isn't a fucking choice?! When will you understand that I can't change who I am?!"
Harry smiled back, giving Draco’s hand a squeeze before getting up to change. He grabbed a button-up shirt, smirking at the stare he felt burning holes in his back. He snuck a peek behind him, finding the blonde staring unashamedly at his naked torso. Harry laughed, making Draco blush at being caught. He slipped on the shirt, buttoning it and putting on some sneakers. Draco watched his every move, seemingly contemplating something.
“Hey,” Harry replied, giving the blonde a toothy smile, “How’ve you been?”
"I don't think I can do it, Pans," The blonde mumbled after a few moments of silence, his voice muffled by the table.
"Pans, it's okay," Draco said with a nervous chuckle, "I...I'll tell you soon. I'm just...afraid. Of what you would think of me when you find out."
“Anything.”
"What are you thinking about?"
Draco’s eyes flicked down to Harry’s lips then back up to his green eyes framed by his glasses, almost begging him to do it. Without further hesitation, Draco kissed Harry’s soft lips, locking his hands behind Harry’s neck. Harry responded immediately, pulling on the blonde’s small waist. Draco pressed harder, willing the kiss to move faster, Harry’s head bumping softly against the wooden headboard. Draco tangled his fingers in the soft, curly locks, a smile playing on his lips. The kiss slowed to a stop, departing with a last peck on the lips. Harry smiled at him fondly, making Draco blush and cower into the brunet’s embrace.
He ran down the stairs, checking his texts as he went to the garage and got in his car. Harry had texted him the address, just in case things went wrong. Draco had a feeling he was right; he didn't like it one bit.
Harry opened Draco’s front door, not bothering to knock as the blonde constantly reminded him it was always unlocked for his mother when she got home. The house was silent, but for the soft mews of the kitten who greeted him with a tail curled around his leg, remembering her name as Lily. Harry bent down to stroke her back, the cat purring loudly in response. He smiled, turning away and taking the familiar stairs two at a time, stopping at Draco’s open door. He knocked lightly, making his presence known before walking in. The blonde was wrapped in his bed covers, disheveled hair splayed against his pillow. His male cat, Tiberius, lay curled above his head, blue eyes staring at him unblinkingly. Harry chuckled softly, crossing the room, sitting on Draco’s bed cross-legged and facing the sleeping boy. He reached over, brushing some loose hairs away from his forehead.
“Please, Draco, you very well know my name by now,” Hermione mused, “But anyways. I have the perfect thing for you.” Draco made a motion with his hand for her to go on.
"Ronald Billius Weasley, I swear to fucking god if you ask me again—"
and that he’ll grow out of it.
"Late
They shared a look, one Harry couldn’t define. Pansy was the one to speak, holding back whatever snarky remark that already formed on her tongue. “Uh…yeah. Did you need something?”
“Go ahead.”
“But you look better,” Draco retorted, though he didn’t know where this random boost of confidence came from.
"I'm sorry I cried-"
He looked up at the dark man in front of him, the look in his eyes giving him his answer.
disrupting other students? You of all people should know better than that, Mr. Zabini." Quirrell smirked as an embarrassed flush colored Blaise's already dark skin. The class snickered as he walked over to the last available seat, a few rows down. The entire school knew of
Even though Harry hurt him, he couldn’t help but miss him. They were together every day, hardly separated but for classes they didn’t share, and the past ten days they’ve been apart. Yes, Draco was counting.
"The one with Draco Malfoy?" harry asked, furrowing his eyebrows slightly. She nodded in confirmation, "Of course. Didn't I already tell you this?"
Pansy gasped, a smile making its way onto her face, “Oh my god, Draco, that’s huge!”
Draco shook his head, his chest suddenly aching for a new reason. He missed his boyfriend. His face flushed at how fast it hit him. His mind constantly wanders to just how little time he's truly
"Every second of every day."
“Don’t remember exactly,” Harry replied, taking a bite of his food before finishing. “I suppose I was probably angry and went for a drive, found the dirt road and thought, ‘Yes, it’s definitely a good idea to drive down this unpaved road by myself in the middle of nowhere.’” Draco giggled softly, leaning his head onto Harry’s shoulder as he talked.
“Not one. You’re supposed to be the smart one.”
Draco paused, looking up to find Harry staring angrily at the wall. Feeling the blonde’s stare, he looked over, his expression turning sheepish. Before he could apologize again, Draco picked up the small cat, moving it to the foot of the bed, despite its meows of protest. Draco moved closer to Harry, allowing the larger to wrap his arms around the pale boy’s frame. Draco sighed in contentment, before continuing.
hate that im giving you such a short chapter after the hiatus but hopefully you still enjoy it :) im hoping to get back into writing as school starts to calm down for me!

"I don't know," Draco laughed, pulling away from the embrace, wiping his eyes on his jacket sleeve of the happy tears found there. Hermione giggled at the sight; she'd never seen Draco cry in the years that she's known him, even if they were just happy tears. Draco found that he couldn't stop the large smile on his face, even when he could feel a certain curly-haired boy, smiling fondly despite the weird looks from his friends, looking his way.
“I swear to Godric above,” Potter groaned. “
The next moment, his bright grey gaze landed on Harry.
Draco seemed pleased by this reaction. Satisfied, he continued with his previous train of thought. “Look. They brought my parents in here. Okay? And I didn’t remember them. Nothing. They said they were my mother and father, and I didn’t feel anything. They were just random people.”
. “I don’t remember exactly what we say, though,” Malfoy went on. “What do we call each other? Boyfriends? Husbands?”
Slughorn went around the room, his ingredients becoming more complicated with each potion. Malfoy continued to make derisive sounds and facial expressions when he was unimpressed by Slughorn’s easy questions. It made it impossible for Harry to ignore Malfoy’s presence in the room at all times. As if he could have anyway.
Draco’s mouth, poised to speak the rest of his well-rehearsed introduction, faltered and forgot how to resume. “Er… I beg your pardon?”
Draco hadn’t even known he was whining. But, upon closer inspection, that steady stream of whimpers in the air was definitely coming from his mouth. He couldn’t even feel embarrassed. He just felt needy. And on sensory overload.
Then, maintaining the angle, Potter slowed down. The drags in and out turned slow, lingering,
beginning to pound into Draco, harder and faster.
“If I’m not mistaken,” Potter replied, lip quirking again, “I believe that was called a kiss.”
He marched to the door, grateful to be out of Potter’s presence and grateful he’d managed all his comebacks without his voice cracking. But, when he opened the door, it swung back shut and the lock clicked into place.
“Come on, now. It’s all right,” Draco assured him gently. “I’ll still love you just as much when I remember. In fact, I’ll probably love you even more. If that’s humanly possible.”
Malfoy gingerly accepted the phial and drank. Then he began to cough loudly.
When Slughorn reached Harry, it took all of Harry’s willpower not to turn and look back at Malfoy, who was watching and undoubtedly waiting for him to make a mistake.
Draco felt bad making Potter do all the work, knowing he would eventually resent Draco for freeloading—he definitely already did—so Draco voiced this. Potter lit up at Draco’s acknowledging the elephant in the room. That night, Draco cooked for them, and from then on, they alternated.
“Come on, Draco, we’ve been friends since we were two years old—”
“Because, as much as I enjoyed it, I feel
“To think, there was a point tonight when I actually thought
“It’s fuckin’ mad,” said Seamus loudly across the table. “Can you imagine, just losin’ everythin’ you ever knew?”
“…Are… are you
Merlin, what was going on? Harry filled with apprehension and his heart began to pound. He didn’t need to look around to know everyone else was in more or less the same state.
. “Draco, what are you saying? Of course I love you. I—we’ve been dating for a year. We live together. My friends adore you, and you spent Christmas with my family.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, and took a step back at once.
“Tippy is not thinking she should be talking more. Tippy is saying goodbye now, sir.”
?” Draco managed to ask, finding the tiniest of all slivers of self-control and pulling himself away from the best kiss he’d ever had. “What the hell was that?”
“Good on you!” Draco declared. And then, because the sight of Potter’s front door had lifted his spirits so, he grabbed a few Galleons from his pocket and held them out to the man. “Here, grab one on me. I’ll live vicariously through you.”
Potter kept staring at him. He blinked once.
Draco swallowed. He nodded, and reached for his pants and trousers. “So, er…” he began awkwardly as he slid them on. “What happens tomorrow?”
Draco’s eyes snapped up to Potter’s again immediately. “Excuse me?” he asked. His brain was broken. It was official. He needed to be checked into St. Mungo’s at once.
So, no. Apparently, wonders would never cease.
Absurdly, he was fairly sure he heard Potter down the hall
He looked like he regretted it the moment he said it, and Draco felt so bad he didn’t argue, just thanked him as politely as he could, to ease some of that resentment. He didn’t want Potter to kick him out into the cold or hex him in his sleep.
“Potter!” Draco yelped, heart pounding. “I—I feel like there’s something I’m not getting here.”
“Yes, on with it,” Potter said, reaching up and yanking off his t-shirt. Draco’s mouth went dry.
I was making love to you.”
Perhaps Potter deserved to squirm, to make up for the terrible things he’d just said to Draco, while he’d thought Draco was someone else.
“Not bloody likely,” Draco scoffed. “But, regardless, I had best be on my way.”
Far away, he felt Harry’s thrusts become frantic and less coordinated, then finally slow down, the glide slicker as he pumped himself deep into Draco’s body. He collapsed with a sigh onto Draco, and they both lay like that for some time, just breathing and sharing each other’s heat and contentedness.
“I appreciate how dedicated you are to keeping up your aloof persona,” Potter said in a low voice, crawling forward on his knees toward Draco. “But you and I both want it, so I think we can skip all the acting once and for all. Fuck, I’ve wanted to do this for so long…”
Has anyone—”
Granger and Weasley came by more after that, and Draco stopped minding. Obviously he couldn’t monopolise Potter’s time so much that he didn’t see his friends. That would never result in Potter continuing to pretend he tolerated Draco’s presence.
“Certainly not! I—it was a mere Draught of Peace! Moonstone, valerian, syrup of hellebore…”
“Tell me you want this,” Potter said. He withdrew his hand and crawled up Draco’s body, his chest nearly brushing against Draco’s as they breathed. “Wanna hear you say you want me.”
Or, perhaps, everyone was yelling. Harry had lost the brainpower to identify or care where the sounds came from. “Draco, do you know who he is?!” someone demanded.
Harry grabbed him by the back of his neck and hauled him into a deep kiss.
Suffice it to say, he was quite glad he’d been here tonight instead of that random bloke from the club.
“Merlin, even your voice, too,” Potter breathed. He looked Draco up and down, and Draco immediately blushed, realising that he’d been trudging down a city block in the mist, and probably appeared dreadfully unkempt. “I must say I’m impressed. You’ve really gone above and beyond.”
well. How had that happened?
Potter and he worked together again from then on. Even when they weren’t assigned on the same case, they sometimes worked in the same office space together, since they had formed the habit and because they’d discovered bouncing ideas off each other often helped.
Potter suggested the same thing again the next day, and the next, saying that there were many recipes he wanted to try.
Then, Harry sat up. He Vanished the bonds on Draco’s wrists and Draco brought his arms down, massaging them absently. He secretly relished the lingering soreness, a reminder of what Harry had done with him.
Potter’s breath stuttered out, either horrified by the words or relieved to hear them, Draco had no idea anymore. “Fuck,
“On what planet is Malfoy knowing how to talk a good thing?” cried Ron incredulously. Dean gave a loud laugh at that.
“Of course my class is being taught by an utter imbecile,” Malfoy interrupted, bracing himself shakily against the desk next to him. “When I find out who you are, my father will have you sacked.’”
Malfoy straightened, eyes brightening. “Oh, how kind of her! She sounds lovely. Where does she live?”
Harry didn’t trust himself enough to supply a response. Fortunately, Draco had no such inhibitions. “It appears he’s a bit surprised by the fact that I’m in love with him, so we’re discussing it. Also, he’s very warm and I’m comfortable.”
. It was too insane even to process.
. Harry, Harry Harry Harry…”
“Very good!”
He planted a desperate kiss against Draco’s lips. He kissed him hard, so hard, and deep, so deep. Like he was trying to force his love through Draco’s skin and warm Draco to his very core. “Every second,” he breathed against Draco’s mouth, only pulling away enough so that he could speak, but not any farther away than that. “I don’t know when it shifted from just working together to something else. It was gradual and I just went with the flow. I thought you knew we were becoming something more. That we were getting serious, falling in love. Fuck, oh my gods, do you even love me back?!”
Harry was certain he was going to drop dead of heart failure at any moment.
He seemed gratified when he finally felt Harry melt against him. He bit Harry’s lip hard, drawing one last shudder out of him, before pulling back when he felt the last of Harry’s fight seep away.
“Malfoy and Potter, husbands!”
“Wait, what’s Potter doing here?”
“Say my name,” Potter said. “My first name. I want to hear you say it when I make you come.”
“I…” Draco began.
His friends continued to call after him, but he just kept walking. He didn’t think about what made him leave, or what he wanted to get out of it. All he knew was that he was going to the Hospital Wing, and he was going to see Draco Malfoy.
Draco turned away from Pomfrey, apparently less concerned with restoring of his entire life’s memories than with Harry’s sudden anxiety.

Malfoy cut him off. “Why, that’s an interesting name for an ingredient! What does it do?”
it mean? Certainly something was amiss. There was no way Harry Potter actually wanted to have sex with him. Except, the next thing Draco knew, Potter was picking him up and tossing him onto the bed.
“Yes, sir.”
“Perfect!” Slughorn beamed. Even Malfoy couldn’t scoff now, with how quickly Harry had rattled off the correct answers.
Potter cooking for them was a strange idea, but it was a change of pace, since Potter had evidently gotten tired of going to all their usual eateries again and again. Draco consented, curious whether Potter was the type to secretly master cuisine or to burn down a house.
“It looks like you’re bloody cuddling, is what it looks like,” said Ron.
Potter took his hands back and raked one of them through his perpetually catastrophic hair. “Are you saying
“You’re not actually Draco Malfoy.” He sounded almost pleading.
Draco looked abruptly very pale and very red at the same time. “No I bloody well don’t! I was confused! Why is everyone just standing here? I—I have a massive fucking headache… and… fuck you, Potter! As if I’d ever feel anything other than complete disgust over your entire exis—I didn’t—I obviously don’t—Can’t you see I was confused—”
Draco tilted the phial to his lips and drank the potion.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Maybe he wouldn’t be so terrible if he hadn’t been raised the way he was. You know, nature versus nurture? For all we know, he could be—”
The tears burned. Of course it had been more to him. It had always been more to him. It had been
There was a pause. Slughorn blinked. “Er… come again?”
By dinnertime, the entire school buzzed with the news: Draco Malfoy was sitting in the Hospital Wing, and he had lost all of his memories.
Draco swallowed.

, and after fantasising about you for years I couldn’t handle it anymore. And then I went to a club and this bloke was hitting on me and I told him I’d fuck him if he made himself look like Draco Malfoy, and he agreed. I mean, I probably wasn't going to go through with it! I knew it was fucked up as hell. But when I opened the door tonight to say it was off, I saw you and you looked so good, and so much like the real Draco Malfoy, and I needed—” the words tumbled out of him in a rush, but he looked like he was finally able to clamp his mouth shut before he said anything else. Draco’s mind seemed to have ground to a halt, too.
occurring, though, was that Potter was pulling Draco's coat off and throwing it to the floor along with the folder. And he was smashing their lips together over and over again, moaning into it like it wasn’t murdering Draco seven ways to Sunday.
“Every day, you do sweet and kind and selfless things,” Harry said earnestly. “You like to pretend you’re as rude and snobbish as always, but that’s just because you’re scared people will reject you if you show them how much you care. But you do care. And I care so much right back.” He planted another smacking kiss on Draco’s lips. Then he concluded, “You’re beautiful, in every way, and I want to hear you say my name when you come for the rest of my life.”
As Draco marched along, he noticed the sound of another person on the street. He looked around. A man, a few years older than him and with what looked like a bad hair-bleaching job, was holding his nose and mumbling agitatedly.
“So, it’s true?” Harry demanded, cutting Draco off midsentence and jumping to his feet. Secrets were true things that people tried to hide. His heart filled with sudden and brilliantly shining hope. “You really do love me?”
“Ugh, fuck, yes,” Draco breathed, eyes falling closed. He hardly even noticed he’d said it. He was so far gone he could barely understand anything but Potter’s voice and Potter’s…
, though Harry would barely even admit it to himself, was why he didn’t drop the course.
“Shut up!” Harry burst out. He was suddenly desperate to stop everyone from thinking such things, though he had no idea why. He stared at Malfoy. “What do you mean, you know when you look at me?”
“I don’t know. Don’t you fancy any attractive witches you meet?”
Everyone gaped at him in terror. Harry’s heart was practically beating out of his chest.
“No I’m not okay!” Draco squeaked. His face was bright red. “I—you can’t—you can’t just—”
“I got it!” said Neville. “Neem oil! That’s what they put in Fergus Fungal Budge.”
As much as Draco knew they both hated each other, he agreed they should probably team up on other projects, and thus achieve similarly successful results. Potter smiled brightly when Draco said so.
Suddenly, his body seized up. He jerked upward, world exploding in lights and colour, and came so spectacularly hard he probably blacked out.
Yes, the
For some reason, Harry felt his arms tighten around Draco’s torso, where he hadn’t even realised he’d wound them.
Draco wanted to crumple from guilt and shame. He’d taken up so much of Potter’s time that Potter couldn’t get his rocks off with anyone else, and he literally had to resort to
Potter grabbed Draco on either side of the head and kissed him.
Malfoy sat up and whirled to face him. “What’s wrong? Why are your shoulders tensing up like that?”
Potter took the most difficult assignments because he loved the world and always wanted to save, save, save, of course. So now they were thrown together, pouring over notes and trying to crack the case.
He proved to know his way around a kitchen, and prepared them a nice enough meal. Draco complimented him for it, and Potter ducked away, just as Draco started to notice how the steam from the food had begun to make Potter’s cheeks go reddish.
“I…” Harry swallowed, then drew in a shaky breath. “Yeah. We’re clear.”
“If it’s not a spell, then is it a potion? I don’t know how I overlooked the possibility of Polyjuice. I assumed it would be too expensive and hard to come by. But, you know what? Polyjuice wears off. Tell me who you are now and it’ll save us both time and energy, and make me much less furious when I finally arrest you.”
people would see the Mark, would stare at it and stare at him and think things and say things…. Of course they would. And of course Potter would, especially. The very idea had filled Draco with intense dread, and here the feared moment was, manifested in real life. “And I’ll have you know,” Draco added acidly, “that I do not appreciate you leering at my Mark like that or asking such invasive questions. It recalls a very traumatic part of my life, and I have been trying to
But there was no way that the kiss was occurring either. Because.

than enough for Draco to have a fit over. Whatever.
“No! You—don’t call me—!” His eyes were frantic. He cast about for an escape through the tightly packed crowd and found none. “What? Thought you could take advantage of me while I couldn’t stop you, is that it? Thought you’d have a laugh and make me spill all my bloody secrets, like some perverted—”
Harry’s stomach dropped. No way. No bloody way.
Malfoy scoffed again, and Harry shot him a glare.
Harry gritted his teeth. “Shove off, Malfoy. It’s not like I enjoy seeing your face every time I come in here. I assure you I’d much rather host a tea party for a Blast-Ended Skrewt than take a class with you in it. But, here we are.”
They ate breakfast together and commuted to work, and as much as it was clearly an imposition, even Potter couldn’t deny how convenient it was for them to work into the night and then head to the office together in the morning. They repeated this a few times in the coming weeks, and then more often. Every time Draco saw that extra toothbrush by Potter’s sink, he felt another pang of guilt, knowing that Potter couldn’t Vanish the thing, since Draco would probably be back again soon and need it. Draco was such a bloody burden all the time. Still, it was nice to sleep in a house occupied by another human being, so Draco tried to enjoy Potter’s hospitality as long as it would last.
, Potter’s
“Mmhmm,” Potter murmured distractedly, closing the door and resealing the various wards on it.
“Well, it’s nice to meet you,” Malfoy went on when she didn’t answer. “I’m…” He paused. Then, “I don’t know. Who am I?”
“F…fine…” Draco found himself saying. This was so surreal. He was so turned on he was literally shivering. “You can unbind me now.”
A few people around them squealed. The noises made Harry jump; he had almost forgotten everyone else’s presences entirely.
“Not funny, I know,” Potter said. His eyes were quickly taking on a look that seemed concerned, and actually
“For what it’s worth,” Harry went on, “I love you, too.”
Malfoy withdrew his face from Harry’s neck only in order to snuggle back up against his chest. Once he was settled, he shrugged. “But I know how I feel.”
One night, as they were sitting on Potter’s living room floor and sharing a bottle of wine, Draco noticed Potter was fidgeting. He asked Potter why, but Potter just blushed and didn’t answer.
“I…” he began, voice cracking. “I… yes…”
“Adding rue produces a potion with similar healing properties, and it also helps in poison recovery.”
“Indeed they do! Three points to Gryffindor.”
Draco cringed, heart pounding. He was at least grateful that, despite how much she despised Draco, the Weasley girl had consented to letting Potter keep him at the Christmas party.
“You shouldn’t work at the table,” Potter said one night at their favourite restaurant. “It’s rude. Come on.”
in utter shock over it, because I am. So, please stop acting like you’re a despicable person for accidentally shagging someone who’s been desperate to shag you for as long as he can remember.”
“At least he still remembers how to walk and talk, and everything like that.” Hermione's voice sounded hopeful.
. Honestly, I knew you were dense, but this might be a new low even for you.”
“They told me my name, and I didn’t recognise it. My own name. It could’ve been any combination of letters in the dictionary, and it wouldn’t have made a difference to me. But I saw you and I knew I loved you." He brought one of Harry's hands to his lips and kissed it. Like a prince in a fairytale, or something. "You’re not my enemy, Harry. You’re my person. I don’t care if anyone says otherwise.”
That shut Potter up.
“Is something wrong?” Draco heard himself ask. He wasn’t sure how he’d managed to speak. But, he supposed the embarrassment of Potter staring at him like
Potter spoke again. “Can I Obliviate you? Please? I really don’t think I can survive another few minutes without having a stroke, and I probably—”
“What the fuck are you doing, mate?”
was the mental one,” Draco said. “Obviously I am Draco Malfoy, same as I was a minute ago, and the minute before that, and the minute before that—”
“You just told me that shagging Draco Malfoy was perverted!” Draco burst out accusatorily. “You said you felt dirty!”
This was exactly what he’d feared all these years. He deliberately wore long sleeves buttoned down to his wrists, even in the summer. He
“Is this some fucking joke?” Draco definitely screeched now. He sorely wished his own weapon weren't in the pocket of the coat Potter had hastily thrown off of him before. “Get that wand away from me at once, you insane bastard!”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, as though Harry were being purposefully dense. But still, Harry could see that the eye roll had no malicious intent. Rather, Malfoy looked incredibly fond. “I don’t remember specifics, of course. Not your name or anything. They say I have amnesia. But you’re so familiar. Like you’re the only thing that mattered enough for me to remember. And when I look at you, I know I’m in love with you.”
Harry beamed at him.
“Godric, what the
wicked way with
Harry had never seen Slughorn’s face take on that shade of white before.
“Got it,” Draco said, his voice small. Amazed.
Draco couldn't handle it; four, because—
Draco had no idea what the point of that comment was, but at least it got him back on track for what he’d been about to say before. “Well, it’s my job to go above and beyond. If I don’t have these files turned in first thing in the morning, the department will have my head. So, if you wouldn’t mind...”
“He didn’t even remember his parents—”
Had it really been that obvious? This whole time?
?” shrieked at least three people.
Draco’s heart stopped. He played his words back in his head.
“Yeah—I—sometimes it’s so bad it’s all I can do not to grab you and snog you up against the wall in the middle of the afternoon. Fuck, but that’s not to say I ever
“You’re damn right it was.”
The jug of lemonade next to them shattered.
Draco tried desperately to curb his tears. It was undignified and quite honestly pathetic. “Is it—is it the gay thing?” he managed to ask. He’d never thought of Harry as the homophobic type. Not after all the progressiveness and tolerance he was famous for advocating.
“Charm?” Draco scoffed. It was lucky for Potter that he’d tied Draco up. Otherwise, Draco would definitely have stormed out of the bed by now. “I can assure you it was a fair bit darker magic than a simple
Potter’s thumb swiped over the head and Draco’s eyes nearly rolled to the back of his skull. He may have been making sounds, but he couldn’t be sure, as everything in the world besides Potter’s hand on Draco’s cock had faded away.
“I can’t! Look, you have every right to want to kill me, and honestly I don’t think I’m even opposed to you killing me, but please let me just get my affairs in order first—”
before morning. Of all the horrible ways to pass the time…
What in Merlin's name was going
“You can add betony leaves to the potion and that will give it healing properties, especially when dealing with bites from rabid dogs,” Hermione said in one breath.
“Master Draco is not being home now, sir,” came Tippy’s high voice in return. “He said he was to be spending the evening with Harry Potter, sir.”
“Ingredient?”
“I’ve been dying to for so long,” Potter said, staring at his lips. “You’re all I see, every day, every night. I know you’re old-fashioned, and I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable, but it’s killing me.”
He let Potter have him regularly from then on. He relished Potter’s touch like freezing men relished fire, and other such disgusting clichés. He was so ashamed, but at least it served Potter’s desires well enough, which was the most important thing.
Of course I’m rambling! I have a headache and you’re staring at me like you actually
Draco was always given the most difficult assignments, because the system hated him for who he’d always been. And Draco always took the assignments, because he agreed.
Then, Malfoy abruptly threw off the bed sheets and marched over to Harry. He grabbed Harry by the back of his neck and hauled him into a deep kiss.
“Right, sure. Well, good night. And thanks.”
“Sorry, yes, I’m listening.” Potter shuffled back over and began to stare at Draco intently.
Fortunately, Potter was about as single-minded as Draco at the moment, and upon seeing Draco’s eagerness—confirmation he had adjusted to the stretch of Potter’s cock and was now ready for the actual
At one point on the way back from the toilet, he overheard a snippet of dialogue through the kitchen door. It was between Potter and Ginevra Weasley—Potter’s ex.
Malfoy… Draco… stared back at him. He seemed utterly undisturbed by Harry’s words. “Yeah, okay.”
Potter stared at him for a moment. And then he shouted, “
“No, I mean it,” Harry said, with more conviction this time. “We hate each other. We’ve been enemies since we were eleven.”
Potter ducked his head, looking apologetic. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I know that was insensitive of me.”
“Er, excuse me?” Draco asked with as much politeness as he could muster, when in reality he was adding this encounter onto his mental list of annoyances he had experienced tonight. Potter would never hear the end of it. “Is there a reason you are whining for the whole neighbourhood to hear?”
“No, sir, Master Draco is being alone always.” (She didn’t have to be quite so honest, Draco thought, face heating despite the fact that he was definitely not in the mood to care what Potter thought of him right now.) “Sir, if this is not being a business call, Tippy is not supposed to answer. Is this being a business call, or no?”
“Get out, Potter! You’ll only upset him!”
“Well, whatever you’re late for, it probably isn’t that important anyway,” Draco assured him. Draco was barely listening to the man, though; his thoughts were already on the vision of Potter’s front door, a mere hundred paces away. The porch light was even on, as though Potter had known to expect Draco. “I say you forget the whole business. Go off and reapply, and say fuck it to whoever yells at you for being late. Or just don’t go altogether; you seem stressed enough. Merlin knows
Draco couldn’t speak. He could barely think. He just nodded, making pitiful sounds and knowing he needed Potter to move so badly he might die if Potter didn’t do it soon.
Malfoy’s face reddened at Harry’s remark. He stepped forward into Harry’s space, eyes blazing furiously.
He didn’t finish. The next moment, he collapsed onto the floor like a puppet with its strings cut.
Harry felt his chest tighten at the words. Draco went on.
Harry was unable speak. His mind was too overwhelmed to think anything at all.
The class was utterly silent. Only Malfoy seemed unconcerned. He was staring around the room with the guileless eyes of a child.
“Yeah, can’t you see he’s not well?”
Draco’s skin burned. He began to feel anger rise up in him. “What can I say? In for a Knut, in for a Galleon, isn’t that right?” he snapped back. “I didn’t have much of a choice, Potter. You of all people should know that.”
Finally, Draco relented, because he’d learned after all this time that if it came down to a difference of opinion between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter was probably the one in the right.
“Let go of me!” Malfoy commanded as he struggled against the hands holding him back. “I belong to him!”
The class set to work.
Harry’s legs almost gave out.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Slughorn tried again, slowly walking closer to him. “Did you say you don’t know who…?”
Potter and Draco were forced to work on a case together.
The student looked at Slughorn helplessly, fear written all over her face.
“Well,” Hermione said, suddenly an excited glint in her eyes. “Maybe they can monitor him and see what sorts of behaviours are innate or learned! This would be an amazing opportunity for a psychological study.”
Slughorn’s eyebrows shot up in alarm. “Mr. Malfoy…?”
For half a second, Draco was confused. But then he pieced together what Potter was looking at, and his stomach turned to ice.
And now it was actually happening.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows, taken aback. “You are acting incredibly strange tonight, Potter. And while that is certainly nothing new, I think—”
,” Potter whispered reverently. Perhaps this was his pleased response to Draco’s consent; perhaps it was simply a repetition of Draco’s final word; perhaps it was in fact in reaction to the new skin he’d exposed as he removed Draco’s shirt. Draco didn’t know, nor did he care. “Fuck, I can’t wait to—”
Draco nearly choked on his tears. “I told you that’s not funn—”
The two of them startled apart at the sudden sound, and they snatched up their supplies with the rest of the stragglers.
“Well?” Draco asked, looking at him as though he were the only person in the room. “Aren't you going to say you’re in love with me, too?”
“Just a momen—er, well, yes—” Slughorn faltered, “that is, it did contain hellebore, but what are you…?”
“How about I cook tonight?” Potter suggested. Draco’s breath caught in surprise.
He landed on the floor and shakily crossed his legs. Malfoy followed him to the ground and sat beside him as though this were the most natural thing in the world.
Draco certainly felt like he could scream now. One, because Potter was a prat and was making fun of Draco and therefore deserved to be screamed at; two, because Potter was going so slowly and that was dreadfully cruel and unfair; three, because it was
Draco pulled back enough to look at him. He gazed deeply into Harry’s eyes until Harry nearly lost his train of thought. “I don’t know who you are,” he repeated. “But I know who you
So that meant…
Harry let out a cry of simultaneous relief and desperation. He hugged Draco hard again, this time shoving forward so Draco fell onto his back and Harry pressed him into the ground, tangling them together. “Then marry me. Please, let’s get married. I’ll make sure you know how much I love you every goddamn day. I want to spend the rest of my fucking life loving you with everything I have. Please.”
“Don’t you dare get emotional on me, Potter,” Draco said. His skin tingled where Potter was still stroking it. He felt vulnerable, exposed. And Potter was staring at his scars and
“Right, of course. You can insult me but I can’t insult you, is that it?”
“No,” Potter said back, sounding like he genuinely feared for his life. “Fuck, I’m sorry—it—there’s literally nothing I can say to explain this away. But at least I definitely did not mean to force you to have sex with me—I mean, how could—Godric, you told me ‘no’ about ten hundred times, and I—” He babbled, looking so distressed Draco actually felt
, Potter was fit underneath his clothes. The sight was so distracting he would have missed Potter’s next words entirely if they had been anything else. As it was, though, he heard the words perfectly. Because Potter said, “I’m going to fuck you, Draco Malfoy.”
Draco dropped his hand from his mouth and looked like he wanted to argue. Like he was so out of his depth that he wanted to start a fight, simply to bring things back to what he was used to. But he just exhaled shakily. “Yeah…” he said past choked up tears. The word had the air of a confession. “I… I guess it has.”
—and leading him out of the room. “Let’s get you onto a bed.”
Harry stared back at his wide eyes, at a loss of what to make of the situation. Draco Malfoy, his arch nemesis since they were children, had no memories. He hadn’t even remembered his parents, his
So, he would show up at Potter’s home tonight unannounced, just had Potter had shown up in Draco’s office unannounced, and see how the green-eyed git liked a taste of his own medicine.
Silence followed once more.
. You're not the bigoted prat I met in Madam Malkin's, and you haven't been for a long time. I saw how much money you anonymously gave to that orphanage.” Draco flushed at this and made to pull away, but Harry kept speaking. “And when we busted that crime ring, I saw how you held that Muggle girl’s hand and told her you'd never let anything bad happen to her again.”
“Er…” Harry began, and simultaneously learned that he was incapable of speech.
“Are you crying?” Harry asked. He sounded slightly horrified. “I, er, please don’t cry. Fuck, I’m sorry I asked for this. This whole thing was a mistake.”
. “Draco Malfoy.”
Potter shook his head, tearing his eyes off of Draco’s arm. “Right. Back to Malfoy. I forgot.”
Chains whipped out from the bedposts and wrapped themselves around Draco, yanking him onto the mattress and binding him tightly down. He couldn’t move his arms or legs. Potter really did have a thing for tying Draco up, didn't he?
“Yours,” Draco said.
“Yes, I know,” Slughorn said, not taking his horrified eyes off of Malfoy. “Without it, the valerian becomes unstable.”
“What the fuck does that mean?” Draco snapped. He realised he was half-naked, so he yanked on his shirt in a jerky rush, not even caring that his fingers fumbled ridiculously over the buttons.
After they’d had their picnic, they sat on the grass and looked out on the beautiful landscape, and Potter began talking.
Potter surged forward, capturing Draco’s mouth with his.
know, you complete imbecile. I want you. I’ve always wanted you. Now, let me go so that I can snog that terrified look off your face.”
“What the hell is wrong with you?” If he’d thought he was hallucinating before, it had nothing on his certainty now. “Let me go!”
Er, not that Harry obsessed over Malfoy or anything. But.
“Gonna give you what you need,” said Potter. “Gonna take care of you. Don’t worry.” He didn’t let go of Draco’s nipple, rolling it between his thumb and forefinger, lifting his head to watch Draco’s face with unbridled delight.
Draco was shocked. “W-why?”
Finally, the first half of the class was over, and they poured their potions into phials. One by one, Slughorn came around to each of their potions and added different ingredients.
One night, they got a late start on their dinner-work-and-talk, and then were chatting so much that they lost track of time. Draco’s eyelids began to droop of their own accord.
“You…” Potter whispered, eyes wide behind his glasses. “You have the Mark.”
Potter didn’t move.
Draco started in surprise, but then felt himself melt into the kiss. He’d told Harry he loved him, and Harry still wanted to kiss him. Would wonders never cease?
“He didn’t recognise is own name—”
Potter leaned down, balancing with his hands on either side of Draco’s head, mouth hot next to Draco’s ear. “You’re so responsive,” he whispered, sounding amazed and overjoyed.
Then there was a pause. Draco held still in anticipation. However, Potter didn’t do anything. When a few more moments passed and nothing happened, Draco apprehensively opened his eyes. He was met with Potter’s shocked expression as he gaped at Draco’s naked torso.
Self-loathing clawed up Draco’s chest and into his throat, and the next thing he knew he was crying. “Stop it,” he said, although realistically he knew he had no authority to make demands to Harry Potter. “But if this is about… well, I’ll keep letting you fuck me without you needing to put a label like that on it. I’m not
But then he began to respond. Slowly, tentatively. It was the most wonderful feeling Harry had ever experienced. Draco tasted like sunshine and dreams come true. It was so magnificent and so surreal that Harry suddenly felt himself laughing against Draco’s lips. He never knew a person could laugh into a kiss before.
!” Malfoy snapped through his coughs. “I’m allergic to hellebore!”
“Okay, listen,” Potter said, much to Draco’s frustration not blinking. “I know you’re keeping up pretences and all, but we don’t have much time, so let’s just skip all the fake protesting stuff and get on with it, please.”
Harry looked at him, eyes somehow much different from how they’d been mere minutes before. “What do you mean, what happens tomorrow?”
A few people stepped up to volunteer. Even Harry felt his own feet jump forward, confused and desperate to act, in any way he could.
“No,” Malfoy replied matter-of-factly.
He had thought the world would explode if he ever said it out loud.
Hermione raised her hand again. Slughorn looked slightly dubious, but called on her nonetheless.
Christmas rolled around, and Draco didn’t look forward to spending the holiday alone. Saint-like as always, Potter extended the hand of charity again, and allowed Draco to tag along to the Weasley home for Christmas. Draco tried to stay out of the way there, not wanting to make anyone remember that their hatred carried enough authority to kick him out. Potter kept Draco by his side, though, so he made sure Draco didn’t break anything. Draco ruined everything he touched, always had, so he was relieved that Potter’s watchful eyes could stop any disasters from occurring.
“I like this look on you,” he whispered softly, taking in Harry’s dazed and well-snogged expression with what could only be described as complete adoration. Harry couldn’t even reply. He was at a loss to do anything else but stare back at the blond boy with slightly unfocused eyes.
Draco glared. Potter’s eyes flicked up to the Mark again. “But, I just…” Potter began, still staring at it with fascination. “How on earth did you even do it? What charm did you use?”
“But,” Potter said, looking like he was grappling for the edge of a cliff before he would freefall to jagged rocks below. “We just had sex.”
Draco was glad Harry then proceeded to lean down and snog him senseless, so Draco didn’t have any obligation to respond. He was fairly certain that, if he did speak, all that would come out would be a marriage proposal. And they hadn’t even gone on one date yet.
“Er…” Slughorn began again. Everyone in the class looked around at each other, perplexed. “I suppose it’s a result of the potion.”
“Holy shit,” Potter cut him off. He was as white as a sheet. With that, he tore out of the room, throwing the door open so hard it banged against the opposite wall.
Oh Merlin. Oh Merlin oh Merlin oh Merlin.
Slughorn continued around the room. Finally, he reached Malfoy. “There you go. Drink up.”
Draco let out a squeal, and then clapped his hand over his mouth to stifle it. His eyes squinched up like he was suddenly trying to stop himself from crying. But Harry knew they were good tears. Everything would be good from now on. He was sure of it.
. “Er. You don’t suppose you’ll let me Obliviate you, do you?”
Draco nodded vigorously. Then, “For the record,” he added, wondering if oxygen had always tasted so nice or if that was all Harry’s doing, “I like-like-like you, too.”
Potter slid in, not stopping the slow and persistent drag until he was fully sheathed, hips pressed snug against Draco and his face looking like he’d just seen God.
“More like mortal enemies!“
Malfoy merely ran a hand through his hair in agitation. He cleared his throat a few more times as his coughs finally subsided.
“Oh, that’s… er… what was it…”
He tugged on Harry’s hair, the softness in his hands mirroring the softness he felt inside. “Permission granted.”
“Absolutely not. Unchain me.”
“You were what?” he asked. His voice was suddenly much quieter.
With a last spiteful glance at each other, Harry and Malfoy moved to opposite sides of the room and sat. But Harry still felt hot, his body restless.
over. Even though the fact that it was Potter was perhaps quite
He kept thrusting, hitting that spot inside Draco again, making Draco arch his back and try not to sob.
Draco nodded weakly as Madam Pomfrey forced everyone away. He didn’t react to the whines or the complaints or even to the words people called out to him as they left. He just stared at Harry, amazed.
Seamus’s voice surprised him. Harry had barely even noticed that he’d stood, let alone begun to walk away.
“No,” Harry said. He knew he was grinning like a besotted fool, and he didn’t care one bit. “Not until you admit it.”
Draco’s eyes sparkled at that. “Well, then I’m the luckiest person who ever lived.” Merlin, Draco smiled like the sun. He smiled like Harry had never gotten the chance to see before, and like he’d be damned if he didn’t get to see again. “And I don’t hate you, Harry. I know I never did, either. I could never, ever hate you.”
Draco sighed, plainly frustrated by Harry’s inability to grasp this. “Yes, I’m bloody well sure. Harry Potter, I love you. I love you
Then, Potter rushed toward the bed so fast Draco almost jumped. He reached out and grabbed Draco’s face with both hands. “You’re in love with me?”
“You can sit here for a while if you need a moment to catch your breath,” Harry said, in that way he always said things when he was being courteous and Golden Boy-y. “But, I’d like to go to sleep soon, so I’d prefer you left sooner rather than later.”
He kept up his desperate chanting, and Harry beamed,
want to force—fuck, I’m so sorry, I don’t even—
soon, I promise.” And if that innuendo hadn’t been explicit enough, he leaned in and breathed hotly in Draco’s ear, “Let me give it to you, Malfoy.”
Draco’s lips were so soft. For all his shouting before, now he didn’t push Harry away or resist at all. But he didn't kiss back, either. He just stood there and let Harry’s mouth move him, like that was the most Draco could allow himself while still keeping up pretenses that he didn’t feel the same.
“For fuck’s sake. You’re a lovely human being, okay?” Draco snapped. “You’re the sweetest person I’ve ever met, and you’re honest, and you care about people, and you work hard and give your all, even when the people asking for your help don’t deserve it. You’re funny, and even
“I didn’t want it,” Draco found himself blurting out. “I hate looking at my skin and seeing it there.
“He’s a Malfoy, sure,” the ginger said. She made a derisive sound, laughing at the very thought of him. “But of course I’ll support you no matter what. What you do is your business. And we all love you, Harry.”
Malfoy doubled over, coughing violently.
me fuck you? Draco, I—that’s all this has been to you?”
He turned to find Potter’s wand trained on him, aiming right at his chest.
Draco’s stomach clenched. Fuck, he was ruining Potter’s life.
Potter was staring at him with the most confused expression Draco had ever seen. And then, “Merlin, are you seriously throwing a fit just so you can stay in
“Fuck,” Potter hissed, voice shaking on the breathy exhale. “You feel so good.”
His heart pounded. Potter pushed in, steady and unyielding pressure. It burned, but the smell of Potter’s cologne was everywhere and repeated inhalation made Draco feel high. There was no escape as Potter slid his finger in and out, adding a second and then a third. The ropes around Draco’s wrists were tight. He twisted his hands in them, feeling how they dug into his skin and bound him to this moment, to this bed, under Potter’s body and under Potter’s gaze.
Draco kept crying. He wanted to believe it. He wanted Potter to have loved him, every day, every night, this whole time.
Draco trudged down the street, grumbling to himself.
Draco found this cause to smile. “Well, convince me then,” he said, as though this should have been obvious.
, if you insist on being difficult and refuse to release me, at least come over here and snog
“Hello,” Malfoy smiled, waving at one of the volunteers nearest to him. “What’s your name?”
. Loved you for so long… it feels like forever. I thought we were on the same page the whole time. I could’ve sworn I… oh, gods. I love you. I was never good with words so I guess I never… but I showed you. I always… Draco, I
The room was silent again. For an absurdly long time.
And that shut Draco up. Potter had wanted this? For, quote, “so long”? Why… that was an even bigger confession that the one Draco had given a minute before.
The air was thick. Draco felt dizzy. Genuinely dizzy. “Always,” he replied, speaking the first non-lie he’d told himself since Merlin-knew-when. “Always loved you. You make my life worth living.”
“Good,” Draco smiled. “Apparently, I haven’t told you I love you nearly enough. I truly apologise for that, from the bottom of my heart. I can’t even fathom why I'd try to make you think I hated you, when every day it’s my job to give you the world.” He let out a small laugh, oblivious to how his words were quickly stealing Harry’s ability to breathe. “I can’t believe I’m such a good liar that I managed to hide
“Professor, is this supposed to happen?” Parvati yelped.
“Let’s go to a pub or something fast,” Potter negotiated. “We can work at the table, and then once we eat we can come back here and finish. There’s no use in keeping at this when our blood sugars are so low, right? We’re no good to anyone if we collapse.”
Draco wanted Potter to keep going all night, wanted him to keep going
“Professor…” Hermione began. Harry did not like the grave tone of her voice.
Potter didn’t speak. Draco huffed. If Potter was going to insist on not responding, then Draco was definitely not going to say anything else.
“Here you are, Miss Patil. Swish this one in your mouth.”
“I’m not going to fucking admit anything! I mean—because—because there’s nothing to admit. So I’m not saying one more bloody word about it!”
He stood up, feeling himself go red. He couldn’t tell whether it was the absolute heartbreak that caused it, or the quickly mounting fury. “You take that back right now, you conceited fucking prick,” he spat. “How do you think Robards will like it when I tell him what you did tonight, huh?”
