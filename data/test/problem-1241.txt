was still attempting to wrap his mind around it. It was an odd concept to contemplate, him being Draco's Veela mate. He didn't know that much about Veela to start with, even though Bill was married to one, and he definitely hadn't expected to be a mate of one. But he was and it was going to take a bit of time to get used to that.
"How about you tell me what your game is with this stone and I might consider not retaliating for breaking through my wards," Harry smiled thinly. "Which, by the way, also needs an explanation. I'm waiting, Malfoy."
She smiled, definitely amused now. "But haven't you heard that story enough times by now? I'm sure you can remember everything of it. Don't you want to hear another story?"
"I'm still amazed that the Slytherins aren't giving you more trouble," Draco remarked, sipping from his wine. "Especially because you have them together with the Gryffindors, right?"
The dark haired man had to stave off the urge to turn his head and do something as ridiculous as lick or bite the finger. That might lead to things they shouldn't do.
The sun was on its way down, casting orange and red and purple rays across the forest and Hagrid's home. It wasn't raining but there was a bit of a chilly breeze and Harry was glad he had remembered to take his cloak with him. Sure, Warming spells existed, but they were somewhat of a pain because they only lasted for so long.
He should have refused; he still had a lot of assignments to grade, it was already quite late, and there was no reason for him to indulge Malfoy's weird request. Yet at the same time it also felt impossible to refuse, like him not showing up meant that Malfoy would win their argument by default.
The thirty-first of October had the annual Halloween festivities taking place in the Great Hall as tradition stated. Instead of joining them again this year, however, Harry found himself whisked away to a ball being organised by the Greengrass' of all people.
"Someone of the Gryffindor Quidditch team asked me whether I couldn't join their training tonight, to show their Seeker some moves," he started.
He had no idea how late it was, only that it was definitely evening now, and his stomach was pleasantly filled with delicious food and even more delicious sweet wine. He hadn't exactly expected a picnic as their first date, but he had enjoyed it immensely nonetheless.
It said a lot about his life, Harry figured when he hugged her, that his friend didn't say something like that in jest.
"Harry, seriously, you called me down for this? I'm sure you're just imaging things," she said, rubbing over her eyes.
She surprised Harry by turning towards him and offering him a gentle smile. "It was a pleasure talking with you, Mister Potter. I'll be seeing you at our manor next week for dinner."
Harry's stomach swooped when Draco shot up in the air, his wings creating powerful blasts of wind which sent them straight up. In just a couple of seconds they were above the tree line, hovering above the leaf roof and Harry's mouth dropped open as he looked at the dark mass of the forest stretched out in front of them. Dozens of stars shone gently above them, surrounding a nearly full moon. When he turned his head, he could spot the many illuminated windows of Hogwarts, casting their warm yellow orange light over walls and roofs and the ground.
. It was the first flower he had received, so he thought it fitting if he looked up the meaning behind that one first.
It was quiet for a while; Hermione's eyes flitting back and forth between the two men as she gnawed on her lower lip. She was the one to break the silence first.
"Well, I can fly with them," Draco said impatiently and his wings flapped a couple of times, stirring up some dead leaves behind his back. "So do you trust me enough to fly with me?"
Malfoy pursed his lips, but if he was offended by Harry's brusque tone, he didn't remark on it. Instead he asked, "Have you tried to figure out what's happening?"
"Come, come, Pomona, they're not so bad anymore!" Flitwick admonished her humming. "Why, I daresay they haven't been this easy in years!"
Saturday evening saw Harry standing in front of his mirror, wondering whether he should change his outfit after all – a question he never thought he would ask himself.
They might never be best friends, but they could be civil if Malfoy didn't decide to start acting like an arrogant prick again.
When they parted in front of the staircase in Hogwarts later on, Draco grasped his hand and kissed him on the back of it, winking when Harry gaped at him. Oh, Harry saw where this was going and frankly he couldn't wait to find out where it would end.
"Like who?" Draco shrugged. "I think she's had a suspicion for a while now. Mother has always been rather sharp. She had probably prepared herself a while ago for the fact that you might be my mate."
As Harry stood there, quite perplexed, the house elf bowed and lowered the tray on the table. "Plinky is bringing Master Harry Potter and Master Harry Potter's godson some sweets."
"Where did you get this food?" Harry asked curiously, picking two small sandwiches and some of the flaky white fish to start with. The fish was still warm, so either the charms had done their job or the food hadn't been stalled out for that long yet.
Instead of getting irritated at the rebuttal as he had expected, she smiled. "If you're not the one he's courting, why did you call him by his first name then? Why do you have the strange assortment of flowers in that vase? That aventurine stone shaped in the form of a wing does look rather out of place next to those pictures, don't you think?" She nodded at the picture frames displayed above the fireplace. The stone in question was placed in front of his parents' wedding photo.
"Need I remind you that I did figure out early on that you were planning something in our sixth year?" Harry smiled thinly and grey eyes narrowed slightly, but oddly the blond remained quiet, ignoring the slight.
"Well, I can't really help you with that," he smiled apologetically. "I wouldn't know why Draco doesn't want to tell you who it is. Maybe you should ask his friends? They might have an idea? It could be one of them; perhaps Parkinson? They were rather close during school from what I can remember."
"I take your word for it," Harry choked out, a tad overwhelmed at how close Draco suddenly stood. He could practically feel his body heat radiating through his clothes and he fought the insane desire to touch his chest and feel whether he really was that warm or whether he was just imagining things.
Their next date was a Quidditch match between the Falmouth Falcons and Appleby Arrows. Harry didn't like using his fame, but in this case it did come with benefit of having a private booth to watch the game and even a private entrance, ensuring that the press wouldn't be able to ambush him.
"Silly question, of course you've been trying to figure it out. You never could leave a mystery alone."
"It's not even midnight," Harry grumbled, but shot a guilty look at the clock. It was a quarter to midnight to be precise, but he had been feeling too restless to catch some sleep and he hadn't wanted to wait until the next morning to visit his friends.
"After a series of interviews, I have decided that Mister Malfoy is the perfect candidate to take up the position of Potions Professor," she announced, linking her hands together on top of some parchment.
That had her frowning more severely, realising what it meant. She had been there when Harry had raised those wards and knew just how strong those were. There was no easy way to just break through them and definitely not without an alarm being sounded. "You think he gave you the stone?" she guessed correctly.
The dark haired man grimaced and rubbed his neck. He hadn't been fond of those parties at all, because people had kept trying to clamp onto him, making him uncomfortable with their praises and their gratitude. Yes, he had saved the Wizarding World, but he didn't like being reminded of that every five minutes. He'd never been so happy to hear that Kingsley had put a stop to those parties as soon as he'd become Prime Minister.
Malfoy was persistent, as he had shown in their sixth year. If anyone could figure out how to kill someone with wings that only appeared for a couple of seconds, it would be Malfoy.
Grey eyes squinted slightly. "I seem to recall you basically excelling in it in our sixth year," Draco said suspiciously.
"Another match?" Grey eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Where's this coming from? A week ago you were ready to refuse my challenge."
"By all means, just barge inside like you live here," Harry muttered and closed the portrait, rubbing his forehead.
"How was he even going to try to flood the place?" Harry asked mystified. There weren't any toilets except for the dorm area, so what had been his plan?
"Are you really going to behave this difficult about using my first name?" Instead of offended, Malfoy looked almost intrigued and amused at the same time.
"You like the colour of it," she echoed and this time she did sound amused. "You have an explanation for everything, don't you, Mister Potter?"
She lifted an eyebrow. "If you can survive Voldemort, it would be quite embarrassing if you let yourself be done in by Malfoy of all people, don't you think so?"
Hanging upside down with only his legs clamped around the broomstick because there hadn't been any time to correct his course and he'd wanted to grab the Snitch before Malfoy could get to it. Using moves he hadn't performed in years, but which his body still remembered as clear as day as if he had been flying every day …
"I'm being serious, Draco," Harry insisted and frowned. "Is he going to be really difficult about this? I don't want to come between you and your father."
Well, that was completely different. He frowned, reading the passage again. Maybe the daffodil in this case was meant to represent the whole new beginning aspect? Peace seemed like an odd choice after Draco had selected a flower meaning love. But why sent two daffodils in the same colour even?
"Not so bad? Filius, just last week one of the Slytherins thought it would be funny to rip off the earmuffs of a Gryffindor whilst I was showing them how to repot Mandrake!" Sprout shot back annoyed. "I do not call that being easy!"
"Not particularly, I'm just surprised you chose for the forest and not some kind of fancy restaurant," Harry answered and shrugged. "What are we going to do in the forest? Fair warning, I don't know where the giant spiders are right now; Hagrid hasn't told me."
"Hold up, what do you mean, the Veela can sense their mate's feelings?" he asked, a tad alarmed. "You mean he's going to constantly know how I feel?" He wasn't sure whether he really liked that idea, of Draco constantly knowing how he felt, what he felt.
AN2: I swear I'm going to try to update quicker next time *winces* I hope I still have readers for this.
"Fine," Malfoy sighed. "Considering your affinity for bluntness, I'm going to take a page out of your book here."
If he wanted to avoid being dragged in the argument, however – and they would drag him into it soon, no doubt, as it had happened before – he would have to leave now. He ignored McGonagall's knowing look as he stood up, cramming the last bite of his toast in his mouth. There was no reason to look like that at him; he had a class to run in less than ten minutes after all.
As they ate, they talked about their classes and some of the more stubborn students who could benefit from a detention or two.
The nasty smile Harry gave him had him drawing up warily. "Oh, I'm sure she'll make an exception if she hears you go around, breaking through heavy wards. Especially given the implications attached to that. Have a nice day,
She ignored him. "Why would that bother you so much?" she asked, frowning. "If he cast a spell, then obviously it didn't help him in the match seeing as you caught the Snitch."
"And here I thought you'd prepared everything yourself," Harry teased, taking a bite of the first sandwich. He couldn't immediately discern what was in it, except that it was delicious and the sauce tasted amazing.
For all intents and purposes, it didn't appear as if Malfoy was planning something malicious and thus, Harry tried to forget the incident, because honestly, what would Malfoy even be able to do with wings?
"Now who is the one remembering something from thirteen years ago, hm?" Harry raised an eyebrow and only now was he aware of the cheering and whooping happening at the stands.
Not even half a minute later footsteps could be heard approaching the door and Harry straightened his back when it swung open, revealing Malfoy dressed in a simple sweater and black trousers.
"No, I just want you to myself for at least a little while before she hooks her claws into you," Draco answered dryly. "She can be a bit … overwhelming at times."
"Yeah, you would like that, wouldn't you?" Harry grinned and stood close to Draco, wrapping his arms around his neck. This close he could pick up his scent and while he couldn't figure out what kind of scent it was, it was definitely not a foul smell and he found himself inhaling deeper before he realised it.
Her head was floating in the fireplace and she watched with hawk like eyes how he pulled on his gloves before fishing out his Firebolt out of the closet.
– that's far from answering any personal questions like this one," he retorted and checked his watch one last time.
worse than outright rejecting him. If you want to try, you have to try because you want to, not because you feel forced."
She was still dressed in her official Ministry robes, meaning she had arrived home fairly recently and had probably been on her way to change into more comfortable clothes.
"You can call them by their first name, Harry," she sighed and shook her head. "I realise that, so let me specify: I do not want any fighting, be that physical or magical, between the two of you, understood? You have a problem with each other, you talk it out like the adults you are or you come to me. You're both professors and you should set an example for the students. Have I made myself clear?"
noise had Harry frowning and when he walked into the living room, he saw a house elf hovering near the table, carrying a tray with two pieces of treacle tart and some slices of chocolate cake of all things.
When he raised his hand, he blinked bemused at the golden ball fluttering furiously in his hand, trying to escape before it gave up; its wings folding up.
Draco was already eating breakfast when Harry arrived and he nodded at him in greeting. "Good morning, did you encounter Peeves?"
There was probably some sort of meaning behind it; if Draco had just wanted to send flowers, he would have gone for the traditional roses most likely. That it was a carnation instead told Harry that this had to mean something but for now he was content to just appreciate the flower.
Only years five to seven had been really a problem at the start. They remembered the war all too well, most of them having fought in it, and they had been wary of having him as their professor. Some of the more problematic students had tried to catch him off guard during the practical lessons by attacking him with advanced dark spells, but he'd quickly put a stop to that by countering those with some darkish spells of his own. That had shocked them, he knew, because they had expected him not to know those kinds of spells, having considered him too
It was only when he was making his way to his quarters that he realised Malfoy had never said why he had shown up.
"What else was I supposed to do, just leave her outside? That wouldn't have made for a good impression," Harry remarked amused. "And do I need to remind you that I can use all the good impression that I can get with your parents?"
A small shock went through his system when Draco's arms closed around him, pressing him even closer against his body and then there were lips against his ear, murmuring, "Hold on."
"Don't get your knickers twisted, Potter," Draco said annoyed. "The enchantment wasn't a real test anyways. I know you can break through the Imperius Curse, so throwing off an enchantment would be just as easy. I just tried it to cover all the bases, that's all. The real proof are the wings and the fact that your wards don't work against my gifts."
Shit, he thought he'd put that thing out of sight. "That's a gemstone, Teddy. Pretty colour, hm?" he smiled patiently and held out his hand. "Where did you find it?"
Now knowing that Draco could send presents through his wards Harry wasn't that freaked out by the presence of the carnation. Surprised, yes, but not freaked out anymore and he couldn't supress a smile when he picked up the flower and carefully touched its red petals.
"Thanks for bringing me here," Harry said softly, looking at the fountain still clattering cheerfully even with winter approaching.
"Ah, but who says you'll call me by my first name if I do answer your question? You're just as sneaky as a Slytherin,
That had Draco throwing his head back, laughing. "Oh my, the great Harry Potter casually threatening his students? Whatever would the Headmistress say about that?" he grinned.
"You were absolutely amazing, professor!" Ponder gushed; her eyes positively sparkling. She clasped her hands together, the leather gloves creaking slightly. "I still have to practice a lot to reach your level!"
"There isn't," she agreed, curling her hands around her mug. "Even so, why does it bother you so much? So Malfoy apparently had wings for a couple of seconds; that doesn't seem so dangerous to me."
Currently he was wearing a dark blue sweater and black trousers, which weren't too stiff. A soft grey cloak was laid out across the bed, ready to be put on and brave the weather outside. Cocking his head to the left, he wondered whether he was dressed too casual now.
He had Flood to his friends' place as soon as he had finished his breakfast, needing to talk it over with them. Selene had returned this morning with Fleur's reply, inviting him to a Floo meeting this afternoon at three. He wasn't certain how much she was willing to divulge, but the fact that she didn't mind talking to him about it was already good enough.
"I need to stretch my wings sometimes and a week ago I happened to spot them when flying above the forest," Draco answered; his wings not making any sound even though they were still flapping forcefully, keeping them suspended in the air. "I thought you might like having a look at them without risking scaring them off."
It was as Hermione had said: even if Malfoy had had those wings for a moment, it wasn't like it had done him any good, considering Harry had won three of the five matches. So it shouldn't matter at all. Let Malfoy cast all the weird spells he wanted, as long as he wasn't harming anyone with them.
"Yet since he started working here, he hasn't mentioned you once. One would also think that he would be overjoyed to tell us who his mate is now that he finally found them, yet he's been oddly reluctant to share more than the most basic information – and with that I mean we only know that he's courting someone."
"Not if it potentially leads to something bad happening," Harry retorted clipped. "You're deflecting now. Start talking."
Draco paused and turned to look at him with a faint smile. "Yes, it is. Unless you'd rather go somewhat else?"
"Yeah, that's what he told me as well," he muttered and looked away for a moment. While he could admit that he still thought the idea of him being Draco's mate was odd, he wasn't entering this dating part out of pity either. That would be an insult to the both of them.
Before she could say anything in response to that, a second series of rapid knocks on his portrait had him standing up with a concealed sigh.
"Well, I suppose that's something," Harry muttered. Still, he wasn't quite looking forward to the dinner, he could already imagine how utterly awkward that was going to be.
"The fact that you sent me two daffodils." Harry shrugged and tilted his head to the left. "I thought that was strange, especially considering their meaning. I figured that if you really were going for the colour meaning, you would have sent me two carnations or two chrysanthemums instead. You went for two daffodils and that's what made me look further. The birth months of my parents, Sirius and Remus – how did you know?"
"Sure," Harry said noncommittally and decided to change the subject then. "So, how are you settling in?"
"Excuse me, I have to go see who it is." If it was a student – some overeager ones seemed to think that professors never slept in during the weekends – he would tell them to come back at a later moment. The last thing he needed was for rumours to spread if someone found out that Mrs. Malfoy was here.
He'd protested about that at first, because he didn't know the Greengrass' at all and he was frankly not looking forward to being bombarded with questions of several Pureblood wizards and witches, but Draco had been quick to assuage his worries. It was a masked ball, he'd explained, showing off two masks, so nobody would have to know that the both of them were attending the party.
"I'm a bit surprised you managed to deduce that, considering we never talked about restaurants before," Harry commented and sat down, crossing his legs.
"I'm glad to hear that," Draco said; the corners of his mouth pulled up in a small smile. "You think you want to do this again?"
The Records Room, from what Harry had understood when Hermione had explained it, was near the Department of Mysteries and was so large people could get lost in it for weeks if they weren't careful. As the name stated, it contained every sort of record you could possibly think of, including extensive knowledge about every wizard and witch who'd been born so far.
When he woke up the next morning, he was greeted by a single, green aventurine stone on his pillow, cut into the shape of a wing.
"What's your sudden obsession with getting me to call you by your first name? You're getting off on it, or something?" Harry asked irritated.
"Do you want some tea?" he offered awkwardly, hovering next to the small table while she sat down on the couch.
For a moment, Malfoy appeared confused before he appeared to remember what Harry was talking about and he let out an amused huff. "Still bitter about that, Potter? It's been thirteen years since then."
"You think I'm bad?" Grey eyes glistened when Draco tilted his head to the side. "Wait until my mother unleashes her full force. You'll regret opening that portrait to her very soon."
"That's not the point and you know that," Harry said sharply. "I don't care whether it works on me or not. The second you try that crap again, Malfoy, I'm out and I will make you pay for it. Am I clear?"
AN2: Some of you were wondering whether Narcissa would show up soon, well, here she is ;) I'm particularly fond of this last scene, just saying.
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes (aside from my fucked up time management) please point them out to me.
Madam Pince barely looked up when he strode past her desk. While she might watch students like a hawk whenever they dared to touch one of her precious books, she was more lenient towards professors, most likely assuming that adults would know better than to defile a book.
AN2: Yes, this story is getting more chapters, because clearly I like to screw myself over. What else is new, what else is new.
"I didn't expect you to get one representing my father as well," the blond remarked then, almost casually but his eyes were sharp.
The wind blowing through his hair, whistling around him, trying to throw him off course. Catching glimpses of gold against a steadily darkening sky, rushing after it every time. The adrenaline coursing through his veins as he and Malfoy raced next to each other,
"You're having way too much fun with this, you git," he muttered, but couldn't really stamp down the excitement brewing in the pit of his stomach.
"That's quite the endorsement," Harry snorted. "Thanks. So all right, what's going to happen now, with us deciding to try it out?"
"Professor, can you please come join us during practice tonight?" Thomas Wright asked, his eyes glittering with excitement.
The daffodil joined the carnation and he made his way to the Great Hall, nodding in greeting at some sleepy students and stepping aside to avoid being splattered by a mud ball, courtesy of Peeves, who hissed angrily and turned upside down in the air, glaring at him balefully.
"Okay, fine," she gave in begrudgingly. "But that doesn't mean McGonagall doesn't know how to read people better."
"But what if he tries something?" Ron spluttered, his cheeks steadily becoming redder and redder. "Harry, I know he's a professor now, but that doesn't mean he's completely changed!"
"My son has never been in the habit of keeping things a secret from us. At least not from me," Mrs. Malfoy added finely. "While he and his father might have had their differences occasionally, he knew he could always come to me and confide in me without fearing judgement. That is why I cannot help but be highly curious why he would not tell us who his mate is."
"Yes, we will. I know who it is, there's no reason for you to keep hiding him like he's your dirty secret," she admonished him sternly, making him flush slightly. "I will even do you the favour of informing your father so you won't have to do it. Next week, however, I will be seeing the
Harry wasn't entirely sure whether the other man was joking or not, but answered regardless, "No, surprisingly not. I think my brief demonstration of the things I'm capable of should they step out of line was enough to convince them that trying to kill me might not be in their best interest."
"Erm, if you're looking for your son, his quarters are in the dungeons," was the only thing Harry could think of to say.
He busied himself making some tea, using that time to fully wake up. He could call for a house elf, he supposed, but making tea didn't take that long and this way he could catch his bearings again after her arrival had brought him off balance.
"I'm not immediately a fan of Malfoy, but I know we can trust Harry to know what he's doing," she said quietly and rested her hand on top of Ron's on the table. "If he wants to try this, we should support him. He's always been a good judge of character, no?"
"Again, not much that he can do about it," the blond wizard replied lightly. "On top of that I'm an adult as well, so he can hardly ground me for courting his former enemy."
Draco allowed him a moment longer to look around before he started flying straight forwards, keeping his arms securely around Harry's waist. This high up in the air the wind was definitely colder, but Harry could barely feel it, too aware as he was of Draco's body pressed against him. His body heat seemed to seep straight through their cloaks, warming up Harry more than any Warming spell would.
So honestly, Ron had had it coming. It wasn't like he would be in that much trouble, anyway, given that Hermione knew about Fields' persistence.
Grey eyes narrowed. "I don't know what your deal is, Potter, but people are starting to stare. You might want to think twice about associating with me unless you want to tarnish your precious reputation," Malfoy said sarcastically.
more like – like we're really attuned, that you don't need words to know how the other one feels," she said slowly and a hint of frustration shone through when she said, "I'm sorry, it
He wasn't sure what she was trying to look for, because his rooms didn't really contain anything interesting. Having Peeves hovering about, trying to find ways to get through his wards, had ensured that he kept all his valuables tightly locked away.
Instead of spitting at the accusations, Malfoy grew oddly pensive, sitting so motionlessly on his broom that for a moment Harry wondered whether he'd somehow become frozen. He looked around him just to be certain, but there was nobody else but them here, so that ruled out a hex being cast.
He had experienced a lot of strange things. One could even say that he had experienced nothing but strangeness the second Hagrid had set foot in the dilapidated cabin on Harry's eleventh birthday.
It had always been more than that between them, Harry reflected, even when they still had been rivals and more likely to punch each other than to have a conversation. They might have hated each other when they were kids, but at the same time they had always been aware of each other.
"I had a lot of fun tonight," Harry smiled as they halted near the dungeons. It was already nearing eleven p.m. and the only ones still awake were some ghosts wandering about, not deigning them worthy of a glance.
Leaning his arse against his desk, he crossed his arms and waited for the clock to struck nine, promising himself he would wait only five minutes before he would leave again.
"That is actually kind of amazing, not going to lie," he said impressed. Not that he still encountered a lot of enemies when he spent most of his time at Hogwarts nowadays, but it was still interesting to know that in the event that he somehow did get abducted Draco would be able to find him.
"Yes, just like a bird's wing, that's true," Harry agreed and the six year old boy grinned, dropping the stone in his godfather's hand before hurrying back to the couch where he had been drawing a picture.
He had managed to figure out that Malfoy had been up to no good during their sixth year, so how difficult could it be to discover what he was up to now?
"That's the odd thing: he asked me if I could really see them and then demanded I describe them to him," he answered, running a hand through his hair. "When I asked him what those wings meant, he refused to answer and just said that it was interesting. We went our separate way and when I woke up this morning, I found this on my pillow." He showed her the stone.
He didn't want anyone – aside from his friends, that was – to know that he and Draco had started dating each other, but most importantly: he wanted to be the one to solve the mystery. It was perhaps stupid, inane even, to insist on solving the mystery himself instead of keeping things easy, but this was something between him and Draco. The Veela was not telling the message behind these flowers on purpose, precisely because he knew how obsessed Harry could get with supposed mysteries. This was like a game between them and Harry didn't intend on losing it.
He was going to have to be more careful around the boy if he didn't want him hurting himself accidentally by summoning the wrong thing.
It wasn't signed, but it didn't take a genius to know that this note had been sent by Draco. Harry thought it was safe to assume that there wouldn't be any other flowers forthcoming – for now at least – because why else sent a note now? The Veela hadn't done so with the previous three, so him sending a note now had to mean that Harry wouldn't have to expect duplicates of the others, right?
"So, was this demonstration good enough for you?" he questioned, hovering a few feet away from the stands.
If by being close meant Parkinson hanging around Draco's arm and Draco seemingly tolerating her existence at least. Harry was pretty sure they were friends, though, even if Draco hadn't mentioned her since he'd started working here.
Harry heard him, though, and he obeyed, looking beneath him. His mouth parted in shock when he realised he was looking at a herd of unicorns meandering around a large open field. Some were already lying down on the ground, preparing to go to sleep, but there were also a couple of young unicorns running about, chasing after each other and neighing happily. Their pure white coat shone so brightly, it seemed to chase away the darkness around them.
"Yeah, he tried to throw mud on me. He tried the same thing to you?" Harry questioned curiously, reaching out to fill his mug with coffee.
"I have no idea what you're talking about, Mrs. Malfoy," he said apologetically. Shouldn't Draco be done by now with his Floo call? He had to be wondering whether his mother was, surely?
They all watched it fly out of sight before Harry's eyes met Malfoy's and the man smirked. "Best out of five?"
"Yes, it makes the Veela and their mate more …" she trailed off, floundering a bit as she tried to find the appropriate word. "Attuned to each other. Veela can sense their mate's feelings, so in return the mate can - "
"At twenty-four years old, you remain just as annoying as when you were a student, Potter," Snape groused, glowering at him.
"That's exactly what I'm saying, yes," Malfoy said dryly. "I didn't expect you to be my mate either, you know. But everything adds up. The only reason you would be able to see my wings and be able to break my enchantment is if you are my mate. It's also why I managed to send you that gift: wards don't work between mates. There's no other explanation."
"Beauty deserves to see beauty," Draco said simply and there was not even a hint of teasing in his voice.
While the match itself was quite amazing with both teams rather evenly matched, Harry found himself enjoying Draco's cutting commentary a hell of a lot more. His snarky comments had Harry in a laughing fit more than once and it was only by looking at the scoreboard that he could keep track of who was winning at which moment.
"I'm afraid we're going to have to continue this conversation another time, Harry," Malfoy said lightly.
"I know who it is," Harry said dryly. "I agreed to give this thing a try. Maybe it works out, maybe it won't; that's something we'll find out soon then. I don't see any harm in trying."
"Don't mind Ron, he's being an idiot," Hermione soothed, ignoring Ron's noise of offense. Curling up a leg underneath her on the couch, she went on concerned, "You think you're going to be fine next Saturday? With Lucius being there as well, I mean."
The other two students had been brought to Flitwick as they belonged to his House and judging by the look of his face, the usually jolly man was going to have some severe words with his students.
"Put your money where your mouth is, Potter. You and I, tonight at the Quidditch Pitch. Try not to cry too hard when you lose," Malfoy told him arrogantly before striding away.
After pulling on his cloak, he stuffed his wand into his pocket – out of habit by now, not necessity; well, he dearly hoped he wouldn't need it – and left his quarters. They had agreed to meet each other in the entrance hall, where Draco would lead him to whatever kind of restaurant he had selected for their first date. It was half an hour before dinner would officially start, so there weren't any students yet present in the hall when Harry descended the stairs.
Harry couldn't blame Hermione for sounding so sceptical. The last thing he had expected was to see his old school rival show up in Hogwarts again to teach Potions of all things.
The door to Malfoy's quarters bore a simple but elegant dragon, who stood on his hindlegs the second Harry appeared in sight. Malfoy's private rooms were deeper in the dungeons than Snape's had been, but the dark haired man assumed it was a matter of privacy. Most students would probably think twice before making the long trek to complain to their professor about something inane.
Well, he couldn't really argue with that. At one point Draco would have to introduce him officially to his parents; they couldn't really go a whole life without meeting each other in that capacity after all.
quite a surprise, I'm not going to lie," she admitted. "I didn't expect Mister Malfoy to be a Veela too."
"I can't believe you actually pulled off the Wronski Feint perfectly!" Eliot Thompson said amazed, leaning so far over the railing he was at risk of falling down. "It's even better than Krum's!"
"That's most likely putting it lightly," Harry snorted and shook his head. "But your mother probably expected someone else to be your mate."
"That never does," Draco sighed and rubbed his forehead. "Once she's got her mind made up, it's impossible to change it. I'm sorry; I didn't think she would actually seek you out."
Harry had only ever seen a unicorn once, back in his first year, and the poor thing had been dead then; his blood being sucked out by Voldemort, who had possessed Quirrell. Since then he hadn't had the chance to see even one of them, let alone the entire herd, though he knew that Hagrid kept track of them whenever they came close to the school's borders.
"What are you – Merlin!" Harry jumped, slamming his ankle into one of the legs of his desk. Pain instantly shot up through his leg, but he ignored it, his eyes fixed on the pure white wings which had suddenly appeared behind Malfoy.
"How come you decided to teach instead of becoming an Auror? I remember the newspapers were full with speculations about when you would start your training."
Harry decided this to be an opportune moment to leave; when Flitwick and Sprout started arguing they could go on for hours, a fact which had surprised him immensely at first considering the two of them were considered to be two of the most mild mannered professors at Hogwarts. He supposed even a rivalry between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff existed, though.
"No, didn't pay much attention to that because directly afterwards the Snitch slammed into my chest."
He wrinkled his nose. "Of course not. He did something strange then, though. When he looked at me sometime during our conversation, I swear his eyes turned this metallic silver and all sounds just became … muted, sort off," he fumbled to explain. "Like I was dumped into water or something, or had something covering my ears. Whatever he was doing, I managed to shake it off, but that only led to him saying that he had something confirmed now."
Author's note: Many apologies for the late update. I had wanted to finish it sooner, but I had problems with finishing a chapter of another story and I had to get in the right mindset for this one (as this is fairly light-hearted compared to the other projects I'm working on). Again, many apologies for the delay, I didn't mean to have you waiting so long *winces*
Malfoy stopped a few feet away from him and smirked. His broom was a Nimbus 3000, the latest one on the market. Opinions were divided over which broom was the fastest now: the Nimbus 3000 or the Firebolt still. Harry supposed they were going to find out soon.
"Granted, it's not like we know many male Veela," Harry said, shrugging. "And even then, why should we have immediately known that he's a Veela?"
A carnation, a daffodil and now a chrysanthemum. The third flower had him becoming even more intrigued, because there had to be some kind of pattern or meaning behind these flowers, but what was it? What was the link between all three of them?
"I'm surprised you actually showed up," Malfoy remarked almost casually; his sharp grey eyes flitting briefly to the stands, where the students were almost leaning over the railing to catch a better look at them.
His comment was so unexpected that Harry physically reared back and stared at him incredulously. "I'm sorry, what?" he demanded once he found his voice back.
"Why would the Snitch – no, never mind, doesn't matter now," she decided and shook her head, sitting down at the table again. "Let's assume what you saw, were indeed wings."
"Eh, I had some help," Harry said dismissively and waved his hand haphazardly through the air. "Either way there's a clear distinction between knowing how to make potions and knowing how to cook edible food. I know the Malfoys have house elves, so where did you learn to cook?"
Harry left with a nod at her and at Dumbledore and stepped on the staircase which would bring him back down. Footsteps marched right behind him and when he turned his head a bit, Malfoy was standing only one step behind him, his gaze still firmly fixated on Harry.
"Well, how the hell should I have known you could fly with them?" Harry protested, waving at the wings which were slowly materialising behind Draco. "It's not like I know a lot of Veela and I never saw Fleur with wings, let alone saw her flying with them!"
More than once Ron had complained to Harry that Fields wouldn't stop flirting with him, even when he'd clearly shown off his wedding ring and even after he'd kissed Hermione in front of her.
"We're colleagues and the war was finished years ago; why not call each other by our first name? We're no longer children with a silly school rivalry." He shrugged, acting more blasé than he was. "Why assume that he gave me those flowers? As you mentioned, it's a strange assortment – the kind you would more expect a kid to give you, no? I'm sure you're aware that I have a godson. As for the stone," he shrugged again, "I like the colour of it."
"How daddy and papa fell in love!" he instantly demanded, wriggling under the covers until he found a comfortable position to lie in.
They parted at the end of dinner without saying another word to each other, but Harry caught McGonagall's approving gaze right before he left the Great Hall. He offered her a quick smile in return, though he hadn't been civil to Malfoy for her sake. He and Malfoy were colleagues now, and he would prove – if only to himself – that they could be civil towards each other now that there was no longer a war or Voldemort dividing them.
He had tried to catch Malfoy unaware at random moments throughout the day, wanting to prove to himself that he hadn't gone mad and he had really seen those wings appear. Whenever he saw him, though, whether that was in the hallways, in the Great Hall, on his way to the dungeons, Malfoy appeared like a normal bloke, no mysterious addition of wings to be seen.
"It is. We're happy that he has found his mate so soon," she confirmed and a peculiar look crossed her face for a couple of seconds. "The curious thing, however, is that he refuses to tell us who his mate is. Not for a lack of trying on our part, mind you."
"Ah yes, I suppose my odd luck is good for something at least," Harry snorted. "Would be embarrassing if I could defeat Voldemort, but wouldn't be able to teach longer than a year."
Author's note: Many, many apologies for taking so long with this chapter. I had a difficult time figuring out how exactly I wanted this conversation to play out, which is why it took me so long. Also apologies for the short length. It's currently nearly two in the morning, but I wanted to give you something instead of making you wait even longer, so I hope you can forgive me *winces*
"Given that we're going to try dating now, I think that it's high time you start calling me by my first name, don't you think?" And again the eyebrow rose up. "Or did you call all your former partners by their last name?"
After losing Hedwig, it had taken a couple of years before he had felt comfortable buying another owl, having resorted to using one of the school owls until then. The ease of having a personal owl eventually overrode his apprehension and had him going to Diagon Alley to buy a new one. Selene was a jet black owl with pure golden eyes, the complete opposite of Hedwig and that was exactly why Harry had chosen her. No owl would ever be able to fully replace his first friend, but he also didn't want to be constantly reminded of what he had lost if he chose another snow white owl. So Selene had been his choice then.
The bottom nearly brushed over the floor while the tips were at least a head taller than Malfoy himself and Harry caught himself wondering whether it was possible for the blond to actually fly with them. Could they bear his weight or were they just there to look pretty and impressive?
"Well, they'll have to get over it eventually," Harry said, deciding to go for the carrots instead of the corn.
"Really? That's great for him," Harry smiled blandly, drinking from his own tea. It burnt his tongue but he didn't care about that; too busy trying to figure out just how he was supposed to react.
He would figure out what this collection of flowers meant, even if he had to channel Hermione and stay at the library for hours.
"Yeah, I guess so," Ron sighed explosively and twisted his hand around to clasp their hands together, running his other one through his hair. "And Harry did turn out to be right about Malfoy in our sixth year, so if you say you trust him enough to try out …
"Now that's a big compliment coming from you," the blond said dryly before sobering up and tilting his head slightly to the right. "As for what will happen next – that's up to you."
It was good to hear, however, that Draco really wouldn't die if Harry ended up rejecting him. The last thing he wanted, was for someone to die because of something he had said or done.
Harry told himself the stinging heat in his cheeks was because of the wind and definitely not because of the compliment. Definitely the wind, yeah.
Her eyes briefly glided over the vase with the flowers as she followed him to his living room. If she was bemused by the fact that it wasn't a full bouquet, she didn't show it.
"What the hell is the matter with you, Potter?" he snapped irritated, as the red ball they had enchanted to act like a Snitch flitted away, disappearing somewhere beneath the stands.
"I'm surprised you're still here," Malfoy commented offhandedly. At Harry's bemused look he elaborated, "You know, considering the other professors usually only lasted a year."
"Looking forward to finding out how you're going to do that." Harry winked and released his hand, walking back to the stairs. "Sweet dreams, Draco."
"So you don't know a lot about them," Malfoy surmised and nodded almost absently, as if he had been expecting that.
Knocking on his portrait sent him stumbling out of his bed two days later, on Sunday morning, and as he rubbed his eyes, still tired, he called out, "Yes, yes, I'm coming!"
He waved his hand impatiently. "That doesn't matter, focus, 'Mione. So near the end of our game, I noticed something really weird. I didn't see it for long and it was gone in a flash, but I swear to Merlin, for a second he looked like he had
They had been idiots to boot, holding the fight right in front of his classroom when they knew very well he was still in the room at that hour. At least he and Draco had tended to have their fights out of the teachers' range most of the time.
"Because there's a difference between creating potions and making edible food," Harry said lightly. "I can cook for example, but I can't make potions to save my life."
"You'll see," was Draco's mysterious answer and he pushed open one of the doors. "Let's go before the students arrive and start gossiping."
, it might be a lot harder than how it was between Bill and I. I cannot tell you what to do, but I do ask that you take this seriously, '
One moment they stood next to each other, some space between them as they let their bodies cool down. The next Harry found himself pressing Draco against the wall and their mouths connected for the first time. The touch, innocent at first before it deepened in pressure, sent shivers down his spine, made his lips tingle and his hands clutched into Draco's robes, kissing him again and again until all the air had left their lungs and they were forced to part or faint.
"I'm not the one who hasn't touched a broom in years, Potter," Malfoy smirked. "Maybe I should give you a head start of half an hour, just so you can get used to a broom again. To even out the playing field."
"Why would you assume that?" He hastily took another sip of his tea, finding his mouth uncomfortably dry all of a sudden.
"No, McGonagall might interfere then and that's the last thing anyone of them wants – if they're smart at least," he added.
"Does your mother know about us?" Harry asked curiously, realising that this was the first time they were actually discussing Draco's parents. He hadn't thought about Narcissa and Lucius in years, but with Draco courting him there would come a day when he would meet those two again. Wouldn't that be an interesting experience?
Some of the female students actually seemed to really appreciate that Malfoy had taken over the Potions position. Harry supposed he couldn't really fault them for that. For all that Malfoy could be a real arrogant bastard at times, he'd always been rather good looking and he definitely had grown into his pointy face. Now he had a jaw and cheekbones that could cut glass and more than once already Harry had heard girls sighing about how wonderfully intense Malfoy's grey eyes looked.
The butterflies in his stomach were because of the wine, Harry stubbornly told himself, and not because of the sultry tone in Draco's voice. Because that would be absolutely ridiculous, especially after just one date.
Harry narrowed his eyes. "Considering you've been deflecting my questions since I first mentioned your wings, I think I have the right to be impatient when you're still avoiding answering me."
"So you're okay with her knowing about us now?" Harry questioned and bit down on his lip. He could feel himself blush slightly when Draco pulled his lip free; grey eyes darkening a tad.
Silence descended over them after he'd finished. They stared at each other until the kettle whistled sharply, prompting his friend to get up and prepare some tea for the both of us.
"Ronald Bilius Weasley, you've got some explaining to do," Hermione said coldly. "And Harry, do go eat in the Great Hall; you don't want those girls to think they've got the power to scare you off."
Briefly he wondered whether he and Draco were obligated to inform McGonagall about this already, but well, they were only just starting to date, so was there any point to informing her about it already? For all they knew, they both would get on each other's nerves so much despite being mates, that they decided to call it quits. Best to wait until things between them were actually official before they informed the rest of the professors.
Well, as long as Draco wouldn't literally be able to sense his feelings … He supposed it would be more like couples knowing each other so well that they could guess how the other one was feeling.
"That or he's very good at hiding it," he suggested. This was after all the same bloke who had managed to sneak around the castle for nearly an entire year to fix a cabinet in order to allow Death Eaters entrance to the school.
She snorted and stood up, lifting her mug. "Sure, keep telling yourself that. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going back to bed and you need to go to sleep as well. Don't let Malfoy bother you so much; I'm sure it was nothing."
"Because in order to show you what I want, I need to fly up in the air with you," Draco smiled wryly.
"That's funny," Harry smiled thinly. "I could say the same about you. Thought you might pull your stunt from first year again, remember?"
"What are you doing here?" Harry asked, frowning slightly. The dungeons were nowhere near his classroom so it wasn't as if Malfoy had to pass his class on the way to the Great Hall. "Besides, it's hardly showing off when there's nobody to compete with me."
"Here's your tea," he announced, placing the cup in front of her on the table. He cradled his own and sat down on the armchair. "So, what kind of questions do you have? I'm not sure if I'll be able to answer them, though."
"Hush, you," he smiled before he sobered up again. "Malfoy overheard that and basically challenged me to a Quidditch match."
It was a bit presumptuous of Draco to send a flower with that kind of meaning already when they had only just started the courtship, but he assumed he shouldn't have expected anything less from the Veela. It was clear that Draco was serious about this and mates tended to stay together their whole life, so would it really be that strange if he already sent flowers with that kind of deep meaning attached to it? To other people: most likely yes. But Draco was a Veela and they couldn't be compared to non Veela people.
His eyes widened and he caught himself before he would slam the book down and call Madam Pince's ire upon him. There it was: the actual meaning behind the flowers, one he had overlooked several times when reading the passages, because it hadn't rung any bell immediately.
She ignored him and went on, "I started thinking about reasons why my son wouldn't want to confide in us yet who his mate is. After all, with how important a mate is, he's just delaying the inevitable at this point."
"Don't be such a baby." Hermione clucked her tongue, before winking at Harry. "Feel free to divulge everything you want, Harry. Especially the courting part! I'd really like to know what he is planning!" Her eyes started to glitter with excitement; her studious part taking over once more.
"Oh, that." Harry shrugged and started eating. "I've thought about becoming an Auror, that's true, but when the war ended, I found I was no longer interested in spending the rest of my life chasing dark wizards. One of them has been quite enough to last a lifetime, really. McGonagall mentioned that she was looking for someone to fill in the Defence Against the Dark Arts position and I figured I might as well give it a try. It hasn't been that bad, to be honest. At least here nobody tries to kill me on purpose," he added humorously.
"Okay, yes, but we all did horrible things during the war," Harry said and furrowed his eyebrows. "Look, I'm not saying you have to start liking him now. Hell, for all I know, this might not even work out between us anyways. But I'm still going to try and make it work and I would appreciate it if you supported me at least."
Ignoring the jab, Harry started filling his plate with mashed potatoes. "I've never done anything out of pity and I'm certainly not about to start with you now," he retorted. "Not that popular with the other professors, huh?"
The first thing he noticed upon entering the Great Hall was how far removed Malfoy sat at the professors' table. He sat all the way to the left, near the Slytherin table, while the others sat more to the right, with McGonagall and Flitwick more to the middle. He saw the wary looks some of the other professors snuck at Malfoy, as if they were expecting him to rise up any moment now and declare his undying loyalty to Voldemort.
She rolled her eyes. "Yes, well, from what we've seen after the war, he also cares a lot about his family. He might dislike Harry, but I doubt he's going to do anything that might push away his wife or his son."
And who would have thought he would one day enjoying dancing with somebody? Clearly dating Draco was opening him up to a lot of firsts in his life.
His blunt inquiry had Malfoy wincing slightly, but his voice was even and calm when he answered, "No, nothing of the sort. Well, it would hurt and especially my Veela side would feel miserable for a while, but it's not like I'll die if you reject me. It just won't be pleasant."
Yet at the same time that spot seemed to burn with his touch, imprinting him with invisible heat and Harry's eyes remained glued onto Draco's back as the Potions professor leisurely walked out of the Great Hall. Before he left, he turned his head slightly once more and the smile he offered was almost teasing, sending a bolt of electricity almost through Harry.
Harry rolled his shoulders and sighed. "Yes well, I might not like the man, but he's still your father."
Feigning a dive to throw off Malfoy of the Snitch's course, hearing him curse violently. Slapping a hand away, just to be the one to catch the Snitch first …
Harry waited until he heard the portrait click shut before he said, "I tried to distract her, but it didn't really work."
"But we don't know each other that well – or at least not in a positive way," he quickly amended, because years of rivalry had taught him a fair bit about Draco as a person. "Does that mean that he won't be able to, well, sense my feelings at the start?"
"I caught two of them trying to duel each other in the corridor two weeks ago! Are you becoming senile in your old age, Filius?"
"My dear, there will always be some daring individuals, but truthfully, in my personal experience they're getting along much better nowadays," Flitwick said cheerfully.
The entire Gryffindor Quidditch team was jumping up and down and Harry sighed softly, shaking his head slightly before flying over to them.
"He can try to make your life a living hell, mate," Ron cautioned him soberly. "He's tried that before and now you're dating his son. That's bound to piss him off."
"Oh, I don't need half an hour to wipe the floor with you, Malfoy," Harry shot back. "You, on the other hand, might need the warming up."
Harry was left hovering in the air, his breath escaping in tiny little clouds, as he wondered just what the fuck had just happened.
"I don't think Minerva would like hearing you threaten me, Harry." Grey eyes – the metallic sheen completely gone now which just confirmed that the arsehole was in complete control over whatever shit he was pulling – narrowed slightly.
Mrs. Malfoy quirked an eyebrow. "If a certain son of mine acts petulant about telling me who his mate is, it falls on me to search out the mate in question. Really, Draco, you could have avoided this if you'd been honest from the start."
"I don't know," she admitted chagrined. "I can't immediately think of anything that connects all those dots, but my speciality has never been any type of creature. I'll go take a look in the library at the Ministry tomorrow and in the Records Room. I might be able to find something."
Harry bristled, even though the comment hadn't necessary been meant as an insult. "Yeah, well, forgive me for not looking up the lore of every magical being in existence," he said sourly and crossed his arms. "If this is going to be some kind of weird Magical Creature exam, I'm going back to my quarters."
He pulled a face at his own mug of tea, drank most of it and washed it off, leaving it behind on the sink to dry before he returned to his private quarters at Hogwarts.
Right as he was about to leave his quarters, a glistening in the corner of his eye caught his attention and he uttered a noise of surprise when a bright white daffodil of all flowers appeared on the table. Mystified he picked it up and stared at it for a bit. A carnation and a daffodil? Talk about a curious combination. Now he was becoming intrigued about the meanings behind them.
"I'm going to woo you," Malfoy said and it was anyone's guess how he managed to say that with such a straight face.
"Yeah well, he can try. I can make his life a living hell as well if he thinks he can try to pull shit," Harry said dismissively. He would be civil to Lucius because he was Draco's father, but he also wouldn't be a doormat and let the older man walk all over him.
"Okay, so what's the difference then? Why can he see her wings, but I can't?" Harry asked impatiently.
"I don't like the attention that me being there brings," Harry corrected him. "But if you want to go to such a restaurant, I wouldn't mind. Your company would be a hell of a lot better than some of the politicians I had to sit with after the war."
So in the end he decided to do what he should have done from the start: recreate the setting and check if he could see them this time.
Well … He stirred finally and placed the stone on his nightstand before getting out of bed. He wouldn't get any answers if he just kept staring at the aventurine stone. Guess he had another reason to seek the other man out.
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes, please point them out to me.
"I don't think it, I know for sure," he corrected her. "I confronted him with it right before classes and while he tried to be an evasive git about it, I saw that he recognised it."
What was he supposed to say? If Draco hadn't told his parents yet that he was dating Harry, then there was probably a reason for that, no? Well, he could think of one reason already: Lucius. The older man would probably not be that excited to hear that his only son had started dating his former enemy. Even worse: that the former enemy turned out to be his son's mate.
The other man inclined his head. "Maybe you should have gone for an Auror career after all; you definitely have a knack for sniffing out mysteries."
The dragon paused, appeared to eye him carefully before he slithered out of his frame, vanishing from view.
"Huh. Well, give me a bit to change and then I'll make some tea for the both of us." She disappeared upstairs then; her heels tapping on the staircase.
"The same reason why you can see my wings and nobody else can," Malfoy answered lightly, but apprehension flitted across his face for a moment and his voice was almost flat when he continued, "Only a Veela's mate can see the wings. Only a Veela's mate notices our eyes change and only the mate can break out of the enchantment a Veela can put on someone. It's a bit ironic, all things considered. Everything meant to attract and lure people in is exactly what won't work on our own mate. The universe has a strange sense of humour, I suppose."
"I'll cook for you when you come with me to visit home," Draco retorted, grabbing the two glasses to fill them with wine.
"What else was I supposed to do?" Harry shrugged, leaning against the counter. "Clearly you hadn't told her yet and I wasn't about to out you."
"Erm, sure, no problem," Harry agreed awkwardly, because honestly, what could he say? Clearly Mrs. Malfoy wasn't about to take no for an answer now that she knew for certain who her son's mate was.
Grandmother herself followed him into the room at a more sedate pace, the corners of her mouth pulled up in a faint amused smile. Her long, pale blue gown just barely brushed across the carpet as she came to a halt next to his bed, using her wand to first close the curtains before summoning a small ball of light. It hung suspended right above the nightstand, casting a gentle glow near the bed. It didn't illuminate the entire room, but it was enough for Scorpius to see her face.
In the meantime … He glanced at the clock and sighed, standing up with a groan. Perhaps he should go to the Great Hall again before any of his colleagues would start asking questions again.
While he looked apprehensive at least at being held at wand point, he appeared satisfied as well, as if he had something confirmed for him. "That basically confirmed what I suspected for a little while now," he said, which did absolutely nothing to solve Harry's confusion.
It took a couple of seconds before Harry understood the innuendo and he blushed, smacking Draco's shoulder. "Are all Veela perverted or is it just you?"
Harry turned around, resting his hands behind him on the desk. Eyeing the light pink aster and the Lily of the Valley he'd persuaded Sprout to let him take from the greenhouses, he commented, "I see you've got my flowers."
," Harry smiled, amused when the use of his first name made the Veela still visibly. "Let's try dating each other."
What did Veela have to do with whatever was going on with Malfoy, though? Had he pissed off a Veela and now they had hexed him perhaps? That seemed unlikely, however, and where would be the sense in hexing someone to occasionally show wings? Malfoy hadn't been surprised either time when Harry had mentioned the wings or his eyes, so they couldn't be a result of a hex.
"I know they're staring at me, that's no longer a surprise," Harry replied calmly. "And I've never given a damn about my reputation, Malfoy, as you should well know by now. Can we at least pretend to be civilized people who can exchange some small talk with each other? It's been six years since the war, Malfoy; I'd like to think we can get past our rivalry of then. So, what's it going to be? Your settling in at the school or the delightful tale of my godson driving his grandmother mad? Your choice."
," she said; her voice carrying a vague apologising note. "I don't know whether you two will work out or not with the kind of '
Well, he could hardly be worse than Treeling, really. At least Malfoy had always been good at Potions, something Harry had honestly doubted of Treeling.
"Wait, wait," Harry said baffled and waved his right hand as if that would make everything start making sense again. "What are you talking about, only a mate can see the wings? Are you saying I'm your mate?" His voice went a pitch higher at the end and any other time he'd be embarrassed about that, but all he could think about now was that nothing made sense.
"See, told you, you wouldn't mind dancing if you did it with me," Draco pointed out smugly as they came to a stop at the furthest end of the patio where a stone bench had been placed.
Author's note: Many, many apologies for again leaving you all hanging for so long *winces* That wasn't my intention at all! I kicked my butt into gear finally to finish this chapter; I hope it won't disappoint *grimaces*
Yes, Harry knew that quite well. He discovered that he couldn't wait to find out what exactly that meant for
Malfoy stared at him for a little while longer, his mouth pressed into a thin line before all the tension suddenly left him and he nodded. "Fine, meet you at the Pitch in ten minutes."
He found the flower on the table just like this morning and it felt like a déjà vu because again it was a white daffodil. The sight of it left him a bit stumped, to be honest, because even though he hadn't expected a fourth flower, he thought it would have been something different again. Did this mean that he could expect a second carnation and a second chrysanthemum?
Author's note: Apologies for the delay! I had to do some research for this story and that was difficult to combine with my exams. This weekend was kind of exhausting as well, but I pushed through to finally update this story again! Once again, my apologies for the delay!
"Yeah, I know, he sounded sincere," he sighed, running his fingers through his hair. "I believe what he told me, I just wanted – to be sure, I guess. You're the only other Veela I know, so …"
"You're quite annoying," Malfoy informed him after a short pause. "But yes, I've settled in as best as I can. Had to ward my private rooms to avoid Peeves from wreaking havoc in it."
"Okay." Harry took a bit to order his thoughts, curling his fingers around the edge of the desk. "Do
"Maybe," she allowed. "But aside from somehow getting through you wards and trying to use his eyes, had he actually attempted to really attack you so far?"
