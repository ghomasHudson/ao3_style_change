So, that is how, at now 24 years old, French Draco Malfoy decided to move back to England, 6 years after the end of the war.
“No… it’z not zat…” When crying, Draco’s accent came out even stronger than usual and Harry – who was so used to it by now that he usually barely noticed it – could not help finding it cute and a bit hot if he was honest. “It’z zat… I didn’t no zat zey sot of me az a fazer figure.”
“I don’t mind one bit. I promise! They couldn’t have a better second paternal figure than you, Dray. You are awesome with them.”
“But… you don’t mind?” Draco was looking at Harry with enormous and shiny eyes, the Saviour had to hold a sudden urge to kiss the blond.
“I thought that you boys were better than that! Insulting that beetle is one thing! Saying such words in front of your kids is another!” If Draco and Harry had noticed the use of the possessive, they were too scared to say anything about it. “Do make sure I won’t ever hear any of those words come out of your mouth ever again or I’m not sure you’ll like the consequences!”
“Awesome! Do you work this weekend? I could help you move! And then…” Draco laughed at Harry acting like an overexcited puppy.
“I guess, it’s perfectly understandable you know?” Draco said, looking a bit flustered as he brought his hand to the nape of his neck in a sign of clear discomfort. Harry nodded slightly.
They chose to take it to the bedroom. Nobody was surprised when, in the morning, Molly and Ron found them naked in bed together. They had come because they were late for Sunday lunch at the Burrow and everybody had started worrying. After Ron had grumbled something about seeing more than he needed, the new couple got up and got dressed in order to leave for the Burrow as soon as possible.
Harry shrugged and sat down behind his plate. “I knew this would be waiting for me at home,” he smiled, leaning his head back when Blaise put his hands on his shoulders and leaned down for a kiss.
Harry knew it could’ve ended in a quickie on the kitchen counter but they had the risotto to tend to and they should get on with dinner if they wanted to be done when Blaise arrived.
Draco smirked as he felt Harry’s cock stir underneath him. He gave a punctuated hip thrust, his own cock already half hard again. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”
“If you knew I was going to impulse-buy, why did you send me to Tesco’s?” Harry shot back, clearing the last of the pasta from his plate.
Harry didn’t mind being alone in the house. He liked cooking if he could take his time for it, and especially if he knew it would be appreciated. Apart from cooking, he took it upon himself to decorate the house for Christmas and worked on his lesson plans. Theo wouldn’t be back for a month or two after the break as their baby would soon be born, so he also needed to look into the lesson plans for the oldest class to be able to help out the substitute when the Ministry finally deigned themselves worthy of sending one.
On Monday, Harry tried his hardest to stay busy. He cleaned the house from top to bottom, changed the sheets in the master bedroom as well as in every guest bedroom (there were three, for some reason) and when all that was done and it still wasn’t time to start on their dinner, he took the tube, got out at a random stop and walked around muggle London for two hours before going back.
Blaise didn’t waste another moment before he bent down to kiss Harry again, his hands moving down to Harry’s arse.
“Yes you are,” Draco chimed in as he walked in from the sitting room. “Which is why I will find a pint of Ben & Jerry's when I open the freezer door.”
He pressed the heel of his hand into his hard-on straining against the zipper of his jeans and felt his arse clench around thin air.
Harry couldn’t keep up his serious face as he looked at Blaise who was supposedly playing helpless boyfriend. “Well, pretty boy, your boyfriend looks a bit like a big, tall tree, doesn’t he? Have you gotten confused?”
After a few minutes, Harry stirred, wincing when Blaise slipped out of him. He smiled at Blaise, that soft smile that he always got after an orgasm and muttered something that Draco didn’t catch but made the other man laugh uninhibitedly.
"Hmm, yes." Draco nodded. He grabbed his wand to fix the wet spot on the sheets and haphazardly threw it back on the side table before he turned over to face Harry. "I think the two of you should fuck."
Harry’s thumb pressed against the mark on Draco’s collarbone, knowing the same mark was on his ankle, and on Blaise’s side. It had taken them weeks to notice, after that day that Harry finally caught on the fact that they were living together and in love, but finally they saw the changes in Harry’s and Draco’s bondmarks. It had been there for over seven years, but there were more lines now. They had simply assumed that Blaise had gotten his tattooed to match theirs and they secretly liked it a lot. It had only been when Draco had been sucking bruises into it that Blaise noticed he was aiming for one particular spot and asked what that was about. Only then had they realised their soulbond had expanded  to reflect their loves and relationship.
Harry pulled away from Draco’s mouth and Blaise caught Draco’s eyes over Harry’s shoulder, seeing him smirk. “Hey, don’t start without us, we want to play too,” he said, throwing a cheeky wink.
It didn’t take long before all of their moves became more frantic, losing their rhythm as they all neared their climax.
“Draco’s gone upstairs,” Blaise told him quietly. “Do you want to join him or get familiar down here first?”
Over Christmas break, Harry was the one who was home most often, and therefore the one doing most of the cooking. Blaise’s mum had opted to spend the holidays in her villa in Italy with her new lover, so Blaise had told his bosses at Gringotts back in the summer that he’d work through the break, apart from a couple of days when muggle banks were closed anyway so he couldn’t do much actual work. Draco officially had the ministry’s three weeks off, but he was bad at actually taking his leave, so he’d be in and out of the office over the course of Harry’s break as usual.
Draco moved back slowly so that Harry could get up again, and they all maneuvered themselves into the middle of the bed. Draco was in the middle, Harry plastered to his back and Blaise moulded to his front as he kissed Harry over Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s hips moved back and forth, apparently unable to decide if he wanted to feel Harry’s erection against his arse or the friction of his and Blaise’s cock against each other.
Blaise as his? He filed the thought away for later discussion and smiled contentedly when he found his dinner under a stasis charm on the kitchen table.
Blaise cleared his throat and looked at the carton Draco had thrusted into his hand while he went to look for spoons. “What’s this one? Everything but the…?” He quirked an eyebrow. “The only thing missing is a girl?”
Draco came first, his come slicked the slide of his hands on their cocks and Blaise wrapped his hand around Draco's to push himself closer to the precipice. He peered over Draco's shoulder and could see Harry's eyes screwed shut as he chased his orgasm. Blaise grinned slyly, quickly wet his finger and reached over both Draco and Harry to press a moist finger against Harry's rim.
After that first time, it happened more often. They would arrange for Blaise to come over for dinner or Sunday brunch, and often they ended up having sex together.
Harry looked up through his eyelashes as he pulled off with a slurp, a string of saliva connecting his lips with Blaise’s erection.
“Uhm, yes, I should be. I’d planned a meeting with Theo to go over the lesson plans one more time before term starts, but Hermione had a date planned for their anniversary.”
He’d had a perfect view of Harry’s blowjob earlier, but this part promised to be even better. Blaise laid back onto the millions of pillows Harry always insisted they kept on their bed and pulled Harry along until he straddled his hips. Draco could see how Harry’s tongue flicked out when he leaned down to kiss Blaise, and how Blaise met it with his own. Their moans filled the room and honestly Draco wasn’t so sure about his promise not to touch himself. At this rate he would explode before either of them came.
Blaise snorted and lifted an eyebrow as he walked closer. “You could have ordered some take away, you know. I’ve heard there's decent delivery coverage in London.”
When Draco had asked him about tonight, he had been eager enough to agree. Draco wasn’t wrong about Blaise eyeing Harry in that way for a while now, and while they were dating, Ginny had told him enough stories about Harry to be curious. Getting Draco on top of it was more than a nice bonus. He’d had sex with Draco before. Just once, near the end of eigth year when they were both sloshed after a rowdy common room party, and from what he remembered of it, it was good enough. Especially for a drunk romp.
It wasn’t long before Blaise was behind him. Blaise was tall and broad, and Harry felt almost dwarfed by him, as if Blaise could wrap him up completely. He was used to being the smaller one in the relationship as Draco had almost four inches on him, but Draco hardly came to Blaise’s chin.
Blaise raised an eyebrow and Draco rolled his eyes. "He does that sometimes," he shrugged. "He'll probably wake up to wash up in a little while."
It took a while before any of the others responded, but finally the notification that Draco was typing appeared.
Harry had almost forgotten about it all when Draco brought it up again. It had been two months since that conversation and honestly Harry had already mentally filed it with Draco’s other crazy plans.
Harry’s jaw dropped. Had he really been so out of it that he had missed them discussing Blaise moving in and the three of them being
It still baffled Harry that the three of them were such a perfect match. A soulmate match. It was simply serendipity.
It took another minute or so before Blaise’s first finger was completely inside, and then he quickly followed it up with a second finger. He went faster on this one, Draco also adjusting quicker now that he was more relaxed and soon enough Blaise was scissoring his fingers, stretching Draco easily.
He would never get bored of seeing Harry naked. Not after seven years together, and not after seventy either.
"Ah! Yes!" Draco moaned, gripping his knees to pull them up a tiny bit higher as Harry moved his hips again, thrusting deep into him.
“Another time,” Blaise promised, and it took him a few moments to realise that there had never been talks about a second time after today, but judging from the blissed smile on Draco’s face and Harry’s blown pupils as he looked at him, they were in the same boat.
Looking up from his lesson plans, he saw that the laundry had folded and organised itself in three neat piles. Harry’s, Draco’s and Blaise’s. He frowned as he suddenly became aware of the fact that Blaise hadn’t been back to his own flat since he’d come back from New York in October. Harry and Draco had simply both made space in their wardrobe for his stuff, and after a few times when Harry had blindly picked out a black sweater and found it three sizes too large, he’d learned to move a bit more to the left than before as he chose his clothes.
It was hot outside, as it had been all summer and even on the outskirts of London they could hear crickets chirping through the open window of their bedroom. Their skin was sticky with sweat and precome and while it had really been too warm to do anything more than a lazy hand job, a cooling charm and Draco's sultry looks had turned into a long and intense fucking.
“Too long,” Harry sighed. “But I finished my lesson plan a week early and everything is set up for tomorrow, so I’m not complaining.”
"Aaaahhhhhh," Draco keened, lifting his hips to get the exact angle that he wanted as he clenched down around Harry's cock, submitting himself to the waves of pleasure. Come painted their bellies and while he recovered, he watched Harry's face as he fucked his way to his orgasm, he'd only need a few more thrusts. Draco bit his lip as he listened to Harry’s heated “ah ah ah.” The pitch went up and Draco clenched once more, basking in the pleasure bordering on pain as Harry’s rhythm started to falter.
Draco on his account, grabbed Blaise’s cock and started pulling him off for a short while, until he huffed unsatisfied and knocked Blaise’s hand out of the way, taking both their cocks into his hand and starting to pull them off together.
For the first time since he’d entered the room, Harry looked at Draco directly and grinned as he got up off the bed. His cock was softening between his legs and he walked like he’d just gotten thoroughly fucked, something Draco could attest to.
“I can’t deny that I think he’s… interesting,” Harry mumbled. “But why are you suggesting that I fuck him?”
Harry shrugged. “Awful jokes or not, you still love me. Besides, you’ve come up with far better roleplay before. Are you losing your touch, Malfoy?”
It appeared to be the last straw, because Harry gave a strangled cry and his hips caught an irregular rhythm, pushing deep inside Draco as he came undone for the second time that evening.
Draco stirred a few minutes later, pulling a face when Harry slipped out of him and turned around, apparently having fallen asleep.
Harry frowned at the ceiling for a minute before he scrambled up right to look down at Draco. “What? Why?”
By the time autumn was slowly moving over into winter, rain going icy and the promise of snow in the air, it wasn’t uncommon for either Draco or Harry to come home to find the other cuddled up with Blaise, reading, watching telly or listening to the wireless.
Blaise reached down to grab Draco’s knee, pulling it up over his hip as he let his hand slip between his legs. Exchanging a look with Harry, he waited until the latter mumbled a lubrication spell pointed at both Blaise’s fingers and Draco’s arse. It smelled citrusy and felt fresh and tingly on his hand. He could only imagine what it would feel like for Draco. He fumbled at little at first, bumping against Harry’s balls but then his finger found Draco’s hole, the muscle clenching against his finger as he started to push inside. He went slow, inserting just the tip at first, pulling back out and not going in any further until he felt Draco relax around his finger. Then, he pushed in a little further, just up until his first knuckle and gave a few thrusts again, watching how Harry was licking and sucking at Draco’s neck. The blond man’s eyes were closed and his jaw relaxed. His breath was slightly laboured but apart from that and the tiny increments of his hips, he looked perfectly at peace.
“Hi,” Blaise said softly, his deep voice reverberating in Harry’s chest as his hands slid over Harry’s forearms, gripping his fingers in the sudsy water. Harry instinctively leaned back against Blaise’s firm chest, watching as Blaise pulled their hands out of the water. He dried them with a wandless, wordless spell and smiled gently as he heard Blaise’s breath hitch when his magic swooped over him.
“Excuse me, sir,” Draco drawled as he walked into the kitchen at Grimmauld’s, Blaise in tow. “You’re the lumberjack, aren’t you?”
“I hate you,” Harry grumbled, but his smile betrayed him. “At least get three spoons so we can share.” He got up, cleaning his plate and sending it back into the top cabinet with a flick of his hand, smirking when he saw how Blaise’s eyes darkened at his display of wandless magic.
He understood what Draco had meant with their skin tones being beautiful together. Blaise’s skin was a rich, dark chocolate and it contrasted beautifully with his own lighter skin.
He could feel Blaise’s half hard cock pressing against his lower back and his own cock stirred in his pants in reply. Untangling their arms, he turned around and reached up to put a hand to Blaise’s cheek. His beard was surprisingly soft and Harry scratched it gently before he pulled the man’s face down for a kiss. Blaise’s lips were fuller than Draco’s, and he kissed with a kind of restrained passion, nipping at Harry’s lips as if he wanted to get a good taste first. Harry let his tongue swipe over Blaise lower lip and moaned as Blaise took the invite without hesitation, his tongue exploring Harry’s mouth with a hunger and fervour that had Harry shaking on his legs already. His hands dropped to Blaise’s waist, letting his finger trail along the growing bulge in Blaise’s dark dress pants before he grabbed the hem of his shirt and started to unbutton it. Under the fabric was more dark, endless skin covering a soft stomach and a broad chest, coarse, dark hair surrounding the even darker nipples. He was beautiful.
"What was that?" Harry asked, his arm flopping over his forehead. "About Blaise," he explained as he saw Draco's confused look.
Blaise gave a single pointed upwards thrust with his hips and groaned when he came, his abs flexing underneath Harry.
Harry untangled himself from the other man and walked ahead of him down the hallway and up the stairs. His nerves had died down and were replaced by aroused anticipation.
“You’re turned on by it too,” he said, tugging the hair in front of Harry’s ear softly. “You and Blaise would look fantastic together, you know. His deep, dark skin tone against your golden brown complexion. Fuck yeah.” He rolled over further, crawling on top of Harry now. “Imagine Blaise folding you in half while he fucks you,” he breathed, biting his bottom lip. “I would sit there,” he pointed at the armchair next to their wardrobe, “and watch. I’d be so turned on, yet I’d try not to touch myself. Maybe I’d let you do that when Blaise is finished with you. Or maybe I could join afterwards.”
Harry let his hands slip under the fabric, parting it further and squeezed one of Blaise’s nipples gently, making him gasp into his mouth.
“Fuck, Harry, I’m -” croaked Blaise, his words cut off by a deep, long moan when Harry emphasised his movements.
He allowed Blaise to pull off his shirt first and then unbuckled his belt, watching how the soft fabric dropped slightly, the trail of hair leading down now flanked by the V of his hips. Harry undid his fly, pulled the trousers down over Blaise’s - absolutely delicious - arse and pushed him onto the edge of the bed. He pushed Blaise’s legs apart so he could kneel between them, allowing Blaise’s hands to tangle in his hair while he nosed at his stomach.
He’d fantasised about this. Occasionally before he’d brought it up first, and more often since he’d known Harry was on board with the idea, but he couldn’t have conjured up this image if he tried.
Blaise’s fingers tugged at his hair for a short moment, and Harry let out a soft moan, letting his mouth fall open to suck at his cock through the black fabric.
“It’s alright,” Draco said, his fingers toying with the trail of hair below his navel. “I understand, he’s quite impressive to look at. And I obviously have no problem with it, since I just proposed that you sleep with him.”
"What?" Harry managed. His face screwed up even more with confusion while his hips stuttered against Draco's arse.
Draco rolled his eyes, folded the paper and stood up, crowding Harry against the counter as he repeated. “Blaise is
Harry took a deep breath as the doorknob to the kitchen turned, squeezing his eyes shut for a second as he tried to suppress the butterflies in his stomach.
He sent the piles up to their bedroom with a quick flick of his wrist and fished his phone out of his pocket. Blaise had even managed to convince Draco of the convenience of muggle phones, which was quite an accomplishment. He pulled up their WhatsAppgroup and thought for a second before typing out a message.
“Yeah. I don’t think anyone will find it. Sometimes I wish I still had it, but then I remind myself what it does to those it calls back.”
p.s. I know it's a little short, I'll try to make them longer! and yes, I'm aware this is a bit of cliffhanger but I just needed to get it posted already
“Yes, like his mother,” Harry replied, finally retrieving the pouch. He tossed it to Malfoy, who barely caught it and gave Harry a scowl. “Take out what I owe you, I don’t have enough hands to count it out.”
Ron and Hermione were alone in the parlor, so Harry sat with them and explained the potions he’d just bought. Ron made a face. “You trust that git to make you potions?”
When he looked at Ron and Hermione, he found them looking thoughtful. Hermione spoke first. “Harry, if she’s really changed, then I understand. I don’t think I can ever see her the way you do, but I don’t have to. I just have to support you.” She looked at Ron.
After dinner and dessert (and then more dessert), everyone moved to sit by the tree and exchange presents. The usual Christmas sweaters made the rounds, including a tiny one for Teddy, who was sitting with Harry on the floor and tearing at all the paper-wrapped presents Harry set in front of him. Thanks and jokes and light-hearted teases were exchanged all around as gifts were opened until the floor was more paper than carpet and at least three people were wearing bows on their heads.
Harry stumbled his way back up the stairs and towards the Floo in a haze. Guests were beginning to leave in small clusters, and he pushed through them to throw himself into green flames and shout for Grimmauld Place.
“I understand, Harry. Come when you can. Preferably a Slytherin match, we’ve been trouncing them all season and it’s quite good for morale.” Harry smiled back and gestured behind her.
“He only cared about power. The wand promised power, the stone promised love, and the cloak promised peace. He even had the stone in his possession at one time and didn’t recognize it for what it was.”
Ron and Hermione were already there, setting the table and adding the finishing touches to the tree. “I dare you to snog at this Christmas Party,” Harry teased. They both flushed bright red, all the way to the tips of Ron’s ears. Hermione took a swipe at him and he just grinned at them. “Happy Christmas,” he said, and dragged his best friends into a hug. They returned the embrace and for a moment, they were just best friends celebrating Christmas and it was like the war had never scarred their lives. Then Ginny came running into the room to literally throw herself at Harry and climb onto his back, laughing and begging him to save her, followed shortly after by George wielding one of the joke shop’s latest inventions threateningly. Chaos ensued and the battle ended with Ron sitting on top of Harry to keep him down, George chasing Ginny in circles around the tree, and Hermione watching fondly but disapprovingly when Bill and Fleur walked in and caused another riot of activity while they all went to greet the pair. Not long after, Charlie and Percy came through the Floo, nearly on top of one another, which started a new argument that ballooned to involve every Weasley in the house.
“You missed our meeting last week,” Narcissa commented, taking a sip of her tea. She didn’t pose the question, giving him a way out if he wanted, but Harry answered anyways.
“Mate, you know I think you’re bonkers, but you always have been, so I’m not all that surprised.” Hermione swatted at him, and Harry snorted. “Either way, I know you’ll do what you want, and I trust you to make the right decision for yourself.”
“He only cared about the wand. The other two things weren’t important to him. Who would he resurrect? Who did he have need to hide from?”
“I’m being as careful as I can be. I’m just not sure what any of it means.” Harry ran his hand through his hair, and Narcissa released her grip on the table to grasp his hand.
Finished counting, Malfoy held out the pouch and Harry shuffled forward to take it. Teddy leaned farther out of his arms to look closer at Malfoy. “Godfather?” Malfoy questioned. “So whose…”
This is my first fic I've actually been dedicated to, and I really appreciate the responses I've gotten so far. Let me know what you think!
The familiar ache spread through him, a darkness that spidered through his veins. He thought longingly of the Resurrection Stone, but was also glad that it was lost to him forever so that he would never abuse it. One hand pressed against the stone, and for the first time in ages, real tears spilled down his cheeks. He was aware of Ron and Hermione behind him, but when he spoke, it was only to his parents. “I miss you so much,” he choked out. “I miss you every day, and sometimes I just think how unfair it all is and then I remember...I remember seeing you both, in the graveyard and in the forest. I don’t know where you are but I know that you were there with me those days. I know that wherever you are, you still know me. I would do anything to have you back, to have erased everything from the last eighteen years. I would do anything.”
After a few minutes of deliberation, he shrugged and pulled out a vial, uncapping it and pouring the strangely tasteless liquid down his throat. As he swallowed it down, a thought occurred to him that had him tossing aside the empty vial and moving to kneel in front of the chest at the end of his bed. Opening it, he shuffled through a few items before pulling out a length of shimmering fabric. He let the invisibility cloak slide through his hands for a moment, remembering all that it had gotten him through, before finally throwing it over his head.
“The tales say that makes me the master of death,” he said quietly. Narcissa made a slight choking sound. “I don’t know what it means exactly, but I’m able to do things now that I shouldn’t be able to. I can control my magic better than ever. I’ve barely had to practice to master wandless and wordless spells. Sometimes I just know what’s going to happen next, what magic is coming my way before the caster themselves knows.”
“Hello Harry,” she replied. He still couldn’t read her expression. “I imagine this is strange for you,” she said, and he found himself nodding.
“Yeah, so I can stay asleep through the night.” He watched as Hermione unscrewed the top to take a sniff, then put it back on and shake it lightly.
Harry felt Hermione’s hand on his shoulder, and she let it rest there while he continued to cry over his parents’ grave. When his tears finally dried, he sniffed and told his parents and his best friends about meeting with Narcissa Malfoy. “Dad, I’m sure you’re having a fit about it, especially since Sirius was your best mate. Mum, I hope you can see that when I gave her a second chance, she used it to improve herself. She’s not the same person. She doesn’t believe in all that Pureblood superiority garbage. I hope you understand why I gave her a second chance. I hope you understand it all.”
And Draco had watched Harry these past four years excel at a job he had been chasing. Watched him shove cameras and reporters out of his face. He had watched him all through school, snarking back at professors and refusing dates and insisting on breaking rules. And Draco knew Harry never did anything he didn’t want to. And Draco suddenly felt a lifetime of desire bubble up into the safe and willing hands of Harry Potter.
Draco rolled his eyes and gestured to his book. “Obviously not.” He was being nasty, he knew it, but something about Potter’s presence made him forget to be good.
So he stayed on. He’d been working at the Center for four years now, ever since the end of his trial. And he’d been trying, really trying, to be a better version of himself. The version of himself he might have been if he hadn’t been raised a Malfoy, if he hadn’t surrounded himself with the children of his father’s friends, if he hadn’t grown up with so singular a perspective. The kind of young man he might be if he’d talked to a muggleborn at any point in the eighteen years of life before his second one started.
Harry chuckled. “We had some last month when you were in New York, and Draco said it reminded him of us. You’d be the chocolate, he’s the vanilla and I’m the peanut butter,” he explained, rolling his eyes at the memory of Draco’s elaborate musings over too much whiskey and a pint of ice cream. “So no, there’s definitely not a girl missing in this one if you ask me.”
Finally, Harry was fully seated on Blaise’s cock, his jaw dropped in ecstasy and his eyes glassy from what Draco could see. Blaise moaned and his hips twitched, thrusting up the tiniest bit and Draco’s hips involuntarily did the same, thrusting up in thin air as his erection rubbed against the rough fabric of his trousers. He bit back a moan as he watched how Harry started to move. At first it was just circling his hips, but from the way Blaise’s mouth produced only gasps and moans and small encouragements, Draco was quite sure it felt good. Before long, he leaned forward on his hands, pushing his hips up and letting himself drop down again. From where Draco sat, he could see Blaise’s cock slide in and out of Harry’s arse, and he could imagine perfectly how Harry’s rim would flutter around it with every move.
Harry’s eyes widened and he could feel a flush rising to his cheeks. He had a tendency to blush, but his dark skin usually hid it pretty well. Draco always noticed, but only because he was skilled at it after 7 years together.
As Draco had predicted, Harry lost it at the feeling of Blaise coming inside him, collapsing on top of the other man.
Instead, he reached down to fist Draco’s cock, gripping it tightly as he moved back and forth. His fingers were still slippery with lube and there was enough precome gathered on Draco to make up for what had dried up.
On the night before their annual Yule fest, Harry came home late after a long evening of getting everything set up at school. He threw a quick look into the sitting room when he entered the hallway and saw his two men on the couch watching a mellow Christmas movie, Draco’s head in Blaise’s lap while he let him play with his hair. Harry paused on his way to the kitchen. When had he started thinking of Draco
His eyes were trained on Harry’s arse when he sat up on his knees and shuffled backwards, hand coming up behind him to grab Blaise’s cock. He could hear their combined gasps when he moved down, the head breaching his entrance and couldn’t help moaning along with them. Harry didn’t even notice, he seemed to be completely out of it, but Blaise threw him a quick glance, smirking at how affected he was. He didn’t get much time to think about it though, because Harry sank further down over his cock and Draco guessed all his attention was needed to prevent a premature ending of their adventure. His time to smirk. Harry moved up and down in small increments, moving down a little further every time after pulling up a tiny bit. Draco knew how that felt, knew how Harry would be clenching down on Blaise’s cock, how his hands would press into his chest as his breathing quickened. He knew it felt awesome, and right now he was discovering that it looked just as good.
Harry grinned guiltily as he turned around, hiding the evidence behind the freezer door. “Yes, but blame Draco. He texted me the shopping list while he knew I’d be working late.”
Harry quickened his moves, the thrusts got shallower with it and then finally he only managed those delicious figure 8 movements that always drove Draco mental. Blaise wasn’t any better, obviously, his hand coming up into Harry’s hair to pull him down into a messy kiss while the other squeezed his arse cheek.
“Leave that to me,” Draco winked, moving his body down the bed and putting Harry’s knees over his shoulders. “I’ll take care of you.”
A bit later, they had both come down from their high and Draco tentatively stretched his legs as Harry slumped onto the mattress next to him.
“Good, because that means you know the area around here, and me and my boyfriend here, lost our way in this big, big forest. All the trees look the same, could you help us, sir?”
Harry keened as he was pulled closer, his own hands moving up to Blaise’s shoulders to push the soft cotton of his shirt off his shoulders, letting it drop to the floor. He could hear Draco’s gasp when his hands trailed down Blaise’s chest but tried to keep his focus solely on Blaise. He’d take care of Draco after.
He snickered and winked. “Yeah, like that. It took us a while to find a day we were all free, but tomorrow worked for all of us. He’ll be here around eight. Figured it might be weird if we had dinner together first.”
Draco was home when he got there and had already started on their dinner, so Harry joined in, listening to Draco’s chatter about his job at the ministry while he quietly cut and marinated the tofu.
“Hi,” he chimed once he stood in front of Draco, biting his bottom lip as his eyes twinkled. He let his gaze drop to Draco’s crotch and Draco could see his fingers twitch. “Were you interested in joining us for round two?”
“Come here,” he said. He waited until Harry pulled off and then shuffled backwards, reaching his hand out for Harry to take and follow him onto the bed.
Unsurprisingly, Blaise didn’t resist when Harry’s hands moved to his waist, hooking his fingers behind the elastic band and tugging his pants down. He threw them aside once they were over Blaise’s feet and licked his lips at the sight in front of him. Blaise surely didn’t disappoint. The skin on his cock was slightly lighter than on the rest of his body, with a reddish tinge to it now that he was aroused. It was long and thick, the head a beautiful dark pink as it appeared from under his foreskin. Harry shuffled closer and sat back up on his knees. His fist closed around the base of Blaise’s cock and he bent his head to lick at the head, smiling mischievously up at the other man as his erection twitched, releasing a thick drop of precome that Harry greedily licked off.
“Nonsense,” Draco scoffed, falling into his familiar superiority. “You’re not kicking me out, we’ll just—”
“Oh,” Harry remarked, his eyes panicked but his voice artificially pleasant. “It turns out there are other people in the world besides us. Did you forget as well?”
“Wha- what?” Draco responded, unable to think properly with the pleasure that was racking through his body.
and Harry let out a groan because great, Hermione was here, too. He warred whether to get up and meet them at the door or let them come to him. The decision was made when he heard Draco murmur
Draco watched his mother give him a kind pat on the shoulder, and then she turned and left the room, closing the door behind her.
“I understand,” the head auror said, resting his hands on his hips. “Long flight or not, ma’am, that’s part of the job, but rest assured we’ll be back tomorrow morning.”
“It would behoove you to use a silencing charm next time,” she said quietly, turning back to the table and smiling as if she didn’t just say the most mortifying words Draco had ever heard directed his way. “Luckily my room is above yours, and I believe my own wandwork is to thank for your discretion.” Everything in Draco was a fire of embarrassment. “Lucky, too, that I’m a light sleeper. Who knows who else would have woken up.”
“Fancy that. We’ve only been together three months and already I’ve entirely undone your posh upbringing. If it weren’t for that beautiful hair no one would believe you’re a Malfoy.”
Draco stood, awkwardly, bumping into one of the arms of the chair on his way up. Potter looked back at him, this time with the thinnest trace of a smile, and Draco couldn’t help the flare of competition at the sight of Potter’s amusement on his behalf.
“Merlin, no,” Draco rushed to say, reaching a hand out. It made contact with Harry’s warm forearm, and he blushed. Fancy that – blushing
“Sure,” Harry said easily. “I’ve got to fly back with the aurors, but I can meet you at the floos on the edge of the city in an hour or so.”
“You can hang that in the closet,” Draco instructed, flat, even. He was trying not to think about how bizarre this scenario was: his childhood rival in his childhood home. Himself, disgraced and at his mercy, Potter with the inarguable upper hand.
A hand tangled in his hair, strong and firm and reassuring without pressuring. A hand that asked a question, a question Draco answered with a sharp look up. Green met gray, and then Potter started moving his hips, thrusting up into Draco’s willing mouth. Draco wrapped an arm around a thigh, thick with muscle and twitching slightly with pleasure.
“No! Don’t bother.” He opened the door slightly. “Accio jacket!” Said jacket came zooming to the room and Draco shut the door right after. It was a matter of seconds before he opened it again, this time in order to go out because he was ready.
So, while Draco had run away and done basically nothing, at 24 years old Harry Potter had gotten married and divorced, he had had a child and had cared for his godson since he was 18. He had a feeling that the Saviour’s life had not exactly turned out as he had planned or expected it to be. Just like his.
“You… God! You look absolutely stunning Dray! You didn’t overdo it at all! You’re just beautiful!” At that Draco chuckled, like actually properly chuckled, and Harry could have died just from that sound. Soon, the chuckled turned into a somewhat bitter laugh and Harry looked a bit confused.
Living with Harry had obviously allowed the two men to grow closer. They now considered each other really good friends and the kids really loved the blond. Often, Draco would help Harry put the boys to bed. He was glad to see them grow, baby James started talking and calling his dad all day long. Funnily enough, Teddy had now taken to always calling Harry ‘dad’. Draco loved seeing how the younger man still visibly melted every time. They had also started calling Draco, ‘uncle Dray’ in some sort of common agreement. It did not bother the blond at all, if anything he found it endearing, seeing how easily the young ones had taken him as part of their perfect little family. Still, Draco had never expected anything close to what happened that night.
They ate and talked for about an hour before Draco had to go back to work with the promise that, the same night, he would come by Grimmauld Place for dinner. Harry was really looking forward to knowing more about this new Draco Malfoy.
The remaining of the night passed slowly and in a comfortable atmosphere. When Draco left it was nearly 1 in the morning. They had both sworn that they would do this again soon.
“I refused Kingsley’s offer. I did not go back to Hogwarts. So, I basically don’t have qualifications and refused the only job offered to me. Instead, I moved into Sirius’ old home with Teddy because I needed time to myself and to take care of the little one.”
Draco did not say anything else, kissed the boys on the forehead and left the room before anyone could see him crying. He had barely made it to the living room sofa when he broke down in tears. He did not even hear Harry coming and joining him on the sofa next to him, his hand brushing across his back in a soothing gesture.
‘It wasn’t a critique, ‘Arry. I was just wondering why you lived here.” Draco said in a calm and soothing voice.
“Don’t apologize Draco. It suits you. I was kinda sorry you lost it while we were at Hogwarts.” Draco blushed and could have sworn Harry was a little flushed as well.
Draco speaking French and winking at the same time nearly had Harry running to the bathroom to take care of a little – quite above average in fact – problem. The following evening might turn out even better than Harry had planned. Not that he was complaining.
“So, what do you want, ‘Arry?” He was used to Fleur mispronouncing his name but coming from Draco was a whole other thing. Harry decided he actually liked it.
He caught Harry’s eye and winked, and Harry couldn’t help but lean in and kiss the corner of his mouth.
“Get up,” Draco growled, and Potter happily obliged. Then the last article of clothing between them was shed, and they were tumbling back to the bed, Potter’s head hitting the pillow with a soft sound.
“Mmmalfoy,” Potter gasped. All at once his body went rigid, and Draco felt him wake up beneath his fingers. Potter looked back at him, green eyes wide in the moonlight. “Malfoy?” he questioned, face flushed and lips parted. Draco felt that feeling back in his chest, the one he tried to ignore. The one that was clawing its way out right now.
“Yeah,” Potter said, voice breathy and faraway. This was a different Potter than any of the versions he knew. Not the brash Gryffindor or the frightened kid or the level-headed leader or even the mature young man he’d grown into. This was Potter raw: the one who had watched his parents be murdered, the one who had survived his aunt and uncle, the one who had been tortured by his professors and been left behind by his loved ones. The one who had looked him in the eye on the top of the Astronomy Tower, watching Draco try to kill the man he had once revered. The Harry Potter who was scared, and bold because of it.
“Bloody fucking fuck,” Draco huffed, pulling away from Harry’s mouth. His eyes were a deep shade of gray and they begged Harry to come closer. Instead, he said “Don’t move,” and unfolded himself from the floor.
“Shit,” he said, suddenly very awake. “Did that really happen?” he asked the ceiling, and also the boy he just remembered was in his bed.
He certainly was taking his time, running his middle finger around Draco’s rim. He was staring intently between Draco’s legs, enough that it couldn’t be passed off as anything other than a distinct avoidance of eye contact. But when he finally pressed in and Draco let out a sound breathier and higher than anything he’d heard come out of his mouth before, Potter looked up sharply, lips parting in absentminded wonder as he watched the expressions flick over Draco’s face.
He opened the bathroom door as quietly as he could, expecting to find the man in question curled up in his bed. Instead, Potter was still standing there, looking delicate and awkward in Malfoy’s borrowed clothes. Draco hung his suit jacket back up.
“So you haven’t succeeded,” she stated. Draco sank further in his chair. Now that he was more mature, trying for the first time in his life not to be a total prat, he realized how awful his family could sound at times. And he knew from experience that more often than not they weren’t trying to insult anyone. They just had been raised by parents who spoke the same way, who never considered anyone’s feelings outside their own small circle. He glanced over at Potter in his embarrassment, hoping to convey that he really wasn’t like that anymore, but Potter wasn’t looking back at him. All the better – what did he care what Potter thought of him?
“Oi, get up,” Draco commanded, marching over. He plucked Harry’s glasses from the nightstand and shoved them on his face.
to see you around more. With everyone else, I mean. With my friends. With—not my friends, but—” Potter sighed, and Draco truly could not figure out why he was trying to say. “I’m glad you’re not as isolated as some of the others,” he finally finished. And then Draco knew what it meant. He knew the other exonerated Death Eaters and their children – sons of Yaxleys and Rookwoods and Goyles – didn’t try as hard to rehabilitate themselves in magical society. Would never dream of sharing butterbeers with Jordans and Abbotts and Creeveys.
wish we hadn’t, right?” Draco asked. It almost hurt to say the words out loud. It almost hurt to think them: out of all the people in the Manor at that very moment, all of those viciously judgmental witches and wizards, somehow
Unlikely or not, Harry had never been happier. Draco was excellent in the kitchen, excellent in conversation, excellent in bed. He didn’t show genuine emotion often, but Harry could see Draco was just as committed as he was. Three months wasn’t a long time, but with Potters that was a lifetime. After all, his own parents had already been married at his age.
It had been a while since he’d seen Blaise naked, after graduation there weren’t really any opportunities to walk around naked in each other’s bedroom, but he surely wasn’t disappointed by that sight either.
Blaise gasped when he finally closed his lips around the head, pushing the foreskin back so he could suck properly on the head. He relaxed his jaw before taking more of his cock into his mouth and moaned again when Blaise’s fists tightened in his hair, earning him a groan and a twitch of his hips.
Arriving in the bedroom, he spotted Draco in the armchair, the picture of indifference as he read a potions magazine, hardly looking up when they entered. Harry could see he was aroused though, from the way his bottom lip looked bitten and he shuffled in his seat. He smirked and turned around, back to Draco, as he waited for Blaise to catch up with him.
Draco smirked up at him. “I’ve seen you two looking at each other at pub nights,” he drawled. “I noticed it a long time ago, but it’s definitely gotten worse since he and Ginny broke up.”
Eyeing the other men carefully, he chose his position next to them, one hand on Harry’s waist and his other reaching out for Draco. “You’re awfully overdressed,” he drawled, a lazy grin pulling on his lips. Harry chuckled in agreement, already reaching for Draco’s shirt collar to start unbuttoning it. Blaise slid behind him, letting his hands roam over Draco’s shoulder and down his arm while he watched Harry work on the buttons. After three buttons, Harry tilted his head up, pulling Draco into a sensual kiss that had Blaise’s cock hardening against Harry’s lower back again. He watched closely, nosing at Harry’s neck while one hand caressed Draco’s side, pushing up the shirt fabric. After a little while, Draco pulled away, his eyes hooded and his pupils blown, and reached a hand up to pull Blaise’s face closer to his, initiating a kiss. It was slightly hesitant at first, testing the waters, but as soon as Harry started nibbling on Blaise’s jaw, all hesitancy was left behind. Draco moaned loudly and demanded entrance, kissing filthily once he was granted it. His moves were sloppy and hungry, and soon enough the three of them were rutting together. Blaise heard Harry mutter something but he couldn’t focus enough on it to understand, until finally Draco pulled out of their kiss and started undoing his trousers. Blaise chuckled, realising that it was “get those off,” that Harry had been saying the entire time. Draco’s lips were swollen and he had beard burn surrounding them, adding to his already debauched look.
Harry snickered as he turned down the heat under the risotto and walked closer to Blaise, wrapping his arms around his neck and leaning his head back for a kiss. “No, you’re a big, tall man, but we still like to climb you,” he joked, throwing him a wink.
“Bed,” he demanded, tone more commanding than he looked, but neither Blaise or Harry needed much encouragement. Blaise disentangled himself first, stepping backwards until the back of his knees hit the mattress. He sat down and watched how Draco and Harry seemed to lose themselves in each other for another moment. They looked beautiful together. Draco’s milky skin against Harry’s darker one, their hands roaming over the other’s body with a familiarity Blaise could only dream of. Even if they completely forgot about him now, he was fine watching them. His right hand drifted towards his cock, already well on its way to fully erect again and he squeezed his fist around it, slowly, gently moving it up and down while he twisted his hand.
“Went shopping hungry again?” Blaise leaned against the doorjamb as he watched Harry put the pint of ice cream in the freezer.
Draco buried a hand in Harry’s curls and tugged them softly before letting it slide down to his cheek. His thumb rubbed over Harry’s stubble as he kissed him again, deeper and slower this time. “I love you.”
As they came home, they chose to enjoy their alone time a bit more and watched another movie on the TV. They ended up choosing Harry’s favourite,
He had also learnt that Teddy was the former Gryffindor’s godson – Lupin’s son and was related to him through the Blacks – and that James was his son. This had shocked Draco who asked about the mother. His bet was on the Weaslette.
was when, in the middle of a conversation, his mind blanked, unable to find the words he needed, or, at least, not in English. This fact quickly earned him the reputation of not being able to talk.
What nobody knew yet was that this article pissed off Draco not because it was the biggest lie the bitch ever wrote, but because, as far as the blond was concerned, it was too close to what he wished was the truth. During the last months, Draco had grown fond of the young man and his adorable habits to the point where he had developed feelings one should not have towards a friend and even less a housemate. But, unfortunately, he had and now he did not know what to do about it. Of course, he had wondered if his feelings were in any way returned, but all he had managed to get were bloody mixed signals. It didn’t help that Harry was the most oblivious man to have ever walked the earth.
“Right… um… Do you fancy a drink? Dinner should soon be ready, I asked Kreacher so we could eat by 8.30pm because then the boys have to go to bed. Usually their bedtime is earlier, but I thought we’d make an exception tonight.” Draco beamed at him.
“I mean… I wouldn’t be opposed to it. It is true that we are always together anyway. And it’s also true that it’d be nice to have another adult, a friend, around. Plus, your kids are the cutest, so really, I think it’d be a great idea.”
For a moment Harry thought Draco might not come. That maybe the blond had not enjoyed their lunch as much as he did and did not want to repeat the experience. But Harry found out soon enough that he had been wrong. The fireplace roared and the living room was suddenly lit by green flames.
Barely 18 when he left after the trials, he decided to go on a journey of self-discovery, far from his friends and family. That is how he chose to spend the following 6 years in France. He mostly stayed in Paris but visited Marseille, Lille and Rennes. He especially loved Brittany for it reminded him of his home country and of Wiltshire. Even after years of avoiding the language, he quickly found that he had barely forgotten how to speak French and, for this exact reason, had no problem mixing with the
“I…” Harry had been surprised by the question. “I guess you’re right. Ginny didn’t want to stay here because she found it too creepy and dark. And, well, she’s not wrong and neither are you. It’s dark and creepy and too big, but… I can’t get myself to get rid of it or even move out. Even if he did hate the place, it was Sirius’ and… well, it’s all I got left of him.”
Time went by and they kept seeing each other fairly regularly. Mostly at Draco’s workplace or Harry’s home. They did go to Draco’s, but the man felt bad because of the size of the place. It was one of these nights, they were sitting in Draco’s small room, eating while the boys were watching Muggle TV. Harry chose this moment to ask the question that had been on his mind for quite some time now that they had become friends.
“You are just like a Papa! You are always with Dad, you take care of us and kiss us goodnight, just like Ginny did. So, you are our Papa.” The tone the nearly-seven years old used made it clear that he could not discuss this argument.
Childhood at Malfoy Manor had been somewhat peculiar. Not in the sense that Draco’s parents had a weird way of raising him, but they had a precise idea of how a pureblood like a Malfoy had to speak. That meant that during the first eleven years of his life, Lucius and Narcissa had made a point of having Draco speaking French. Of course, they still taught him English for him to go to Hogwarts, but his first language had always been French. This fact had never bothered him for, as a child, he did not really have any friends. But once he arrived at Hogwarts, he quickly noticed that nobody else spoke the way he did. It was okay at first, he tried to lessen his accent and barely spoke. As it turned out, it was not enough. When it was not the teachers correcting his spells’ pronunciation, it was the rest of the students making fun of his accent. The absolute
“Because as you said so yourself, we’re not kids anymore. That is why I would very much like to use this opportunity to start over, if that’s okay with you?”
“Well, I may have been looking at them for quite some time now, and I must admit that I came to like them very much.” Harry took Draco’s hand in his.
After that they talked about the moving and the financial points like paying rent and everything. It took about an hour before they reached an agreement and found a time to move everything from Draco’s place. He was to move with Harry, James and Teddy by the end of the week.
One could only assume that when you are the Saviour of the Wizarding World before being 18, life is only made of happy events, one after the other and that you get to do whatever you want. Well, Harry Potter naively thought so. It was only after the battle of Hogwarts that he quickly realised how wrong he had been. The Death Eaters’ trials and more specifically the Malfoys’ trial had taken all summer for the very simple reason that there were way too many witnesses and proofs to go through. Harry had been obliged to attend every single one of them and turned out to be the most important witness for the Malfoys’ case. Thanks to him, Draco and his mother were free, being a minor and having never taken the dark mark respectively. As for Lucius, he had been condemned to a life-sentence in Azkaban. Barely a week later, Lucius had forced the Dementors to perform the Kiss on him. The next morning the paper’s headline announced that his death had pushed Narcissa Malfoy to take her own life and Draco to flee to France, never to be seen again – or everybody thought so. But that was not all. Harry was also forced to be present to a large number of funerals. Lupin, Tonks and Fred’s had been the hardest ones for he really knew them, they were his family and he could not bear having the whole Weasley family weeping around him or his godson, Teddy, in his arms, crying the death of the parents he would never get to know. The last funeral he had to go to was in March 1999, nearly a year after the final battle.
Harry had to run errands in Diagon Alley that morning. If he were alone, he would have just grabbed a drink and a sandwich at the Leaky but since neither Andy nor the Weasleys could take care of James and Teddy, he decided that after everything was done, they would get a quick lunch in a nearby muggle shop. At least there, nobody would bother him or the boys and there would not be any journalist ready to take photos of them. That was the main problem with having killed a dark wizard before finishing your schooling, the press tends to like you. A lot. And, if it were only for him, he would not have cared, but he did not want any picture of James and Teddy in the newspaper.
“Okay,” he said, leaning over the arm of the sofa to kiss Draco’s forehead. “How about you cook something amazing, I compliment you on it, and then we shag the night away?”
He didn’t really care about the knock or who had made it. The fire was dancing across Draco’s flushed face and the alcohol was swimming through his veins and he was deliriously happy. When he leaned in Draco’s lips were warm under his, and then a tongue was slipping in his mouth and hands were threading through his hair and his own were pushing up Draco’s jumper and—
But soon enough he was lying on his back, in his childhood bedroom — surrounded by stories hand-painted in Latin over gold molding, and carved chests bearing his ancestors’ family crests, and an honest-to-goodness marble bust of some distant relative — with his knees pulled up to his chest, presenting himself to Harry fucking Potter.
Only a handful of people were privy to Harry’s happiness. Draco had watched those people walk arm-in-arm down the Hogwarts hallways. He’d heard them laugh from across the Weasley joke shop. He had seen them share stories that made Harry’s eyes light up, and share hugs that made his eyes go soft.
It was one thing kissing the object of his lifelong obsession in the hazy hours of night, with the lights off and his mind clouded by sleep. It was another doing it by day, with every sense as sharp as the light streaming in the window.
For the first time Harry noticed they were full, a basket clutched tightly in her grip. It was overflowing: with chocolates, with plush toys, with bubbling pink potions, and more treasures Harry couldn’t see.
It was a good arrangement. It kept Draco in check, in control, pretending. Unable to act on the things he refused to even think about.
Potter’s hand came up to grab Draco’s where it was still clutching his arm. And then, he dragged it down, never breaking eye contact, until it settled over his cock.
“Of course,” he conceded. “I’ll try to stay out of your way.” He installed himself in an armchair in the corner of the room, near the window.
He walked over to his desk, where stacks of papers were reminding him of the work he should have been doing today. Could he blame himself, though, for his curiosity? It wasn’t every day a group of aurors dropped by the home of a Death Eater rotting away in Azkaban and tried to
Still, despite Draco's gradual acceptance back into the society he’d once tried to destroy, the Malfoys were subject to their fair share of vitriol. He and his mother haunted the Manor, a cold and empty place whose happiness came in fits and spurts, most often when Aunt Andromeda would visit with the grubby little Teddy. Even their presence, though, was not enough to keep the attacks at bay.
Draco couldn’t deny green so bold and insistent. “Harry, Harry, please, Harry,” he rambled, invoking the name with every thrust of Harry’s hips.
It was only when they walked into the dining room together that Draco remembered his shame. They had not been quiet the previous night, and seeing his table surrounded by aurors reminded him to feel that familiar friend
All of him was laid bare before Draco, from those green eyes so much darker than Draco had ever seen them, to that spot between his legs that Draco couldn’t look away from – the curve of his cock.
“That’s nice,” Teddy repeated. He turned to Draco. “Harry’s nice.” Green eyes turned to him next. Draco swallowed.
“Can I—” Draco stopped, uncertain. Harry was certain enough for the both of them, his Gryffindor days blazing in full glory. But in one night he had already made Draco bolder than he’d ever felt, and he mustered up some of that courage he felt when this whole thing started. “Can I turn over?” he asked.
Draco looked at him. His wild green eyes, his strong jaw. Features familiar and foreign. “This is weird,” he said, even through a smile.
“Well. All the guest rooms are full and I thought since you and Harry are closest in age, he might share your room tonight?”
Draco heard her heels click softly away, and the room went silent. He paused, then turned to Harry. “Is it just me, or did she say
“We should –” Potter stopped himself. Abruptly, he walked back to the desk, putting the photo back in a jerky movement. Just as swiftly he turned back to face Draco, and Draco recognized that steely look that preceded all of Potter’s dumbest – and bravest, he had to admit – moves. “We should do a rematch sometime. Just the two of us and a snitch.”
“That’s nice. Why are you doing that?” Teddy asked, focusing on Potter’s hair now. He didn’t seem to mind.
“Show me?” he asked. Potter sucked in a breath, his lips parting in surprise. But Draco forced himself not to panic. And if there was one thing Draco knew, it was self-control. For the first time in his life, he let himself want what he’d been wanting for years. He let himself want
Draco nodded, sharp and short. He hadn’t considered that Potter had an opinion on his new life choices. Somehow his approval made something gnaw at his chest. He ignored it.
Harry laughed and shifted closer to Draco. “Oh please,” he said. “As if you haven’t noticed me eyefucking you every time we crossed paths in Diagon Alley. Or, Merlin, how much I stared at you during Neville’s holiday party!” Draco just stared at him, and watched his face slowly fall. “Oh, Draco,” Harry whispered. “Did you not notice?”
His hand slid down Draco’s body, from neck to chest to waist to hip. It hooked under his thigh, raising his leg just a little bit higher. Draco felt Harry’s cock nudge at his entrance, and his breath hitched in the space between their mouths.
He turned to Draco, who quickly looked away when he realized he’d been staring the whole time. He grabbed a book from the stack beside the chair, but his hand paused on the cover when a voice spoke.
The fireplace crackled in tandem with their cards, and Harry couldn’t believe his luck. How cozy and warm he felt in this drafty old flat, how safe and seen. Valentine’s was going better than expected.
, he thought. Maybe then they would have developed more cuddly personalities. And perhaps also if they’d bothered to raise their kids themselves, without the help of house elves.
The rest of the day passed in agonizingly-slow hours. Round after round of protective spells were cast out. Windows were magically sealed, fireplaces were guarded, alarms were set. And still, the aurors weren’t satisfied. And still the Manor was left vulnerable.
He ignored them, intrigued by how the attacks on the Manor were getting more localized but ultimately well-enough used to odd happenings that he tried to go back to sleep.
The Malfoys had been dealt a better hand than some, after the War. Lucius had been sent to Azkaban, yes, but Narcissa and Draco were sentenced with two years community service. No prison time. Draco had spent it volunteering at the Muggle Center in Hogsmeade. For two years his unpaid labor involved filing wand applications for squibs, charting unusual magical activity in muggle households, scheduling Hogwarts scouts to confirm the abilities of young muggleborn children, and all other business related to the frayed and tense liminal space between their world and his.
But the thought of Potter staying under his roof made his stomach twist. It wasn’t even that, really. The thought of Potter walking through his
It was a little after eight, and after the two of them had finished their second round of sex, they found themselves on Harry’s living room carpet playing a game of Exploding Snap.
He was so close, green eyes too bright behind those stupid round glasses, the one thing that hadn’t changed in Draco’s life as he grew from a pompous little brat to a less-pompous man.
Then Potter was thanking the auror and turning away, walking straight toward Draco. He barely had time to adjust his posture, slouching into an uninterested bored pose, before Potter was upon him. Their eyes met briefly, and Draco raised an eyebrow, before Potter turned toward the window. He looked back down at his manual, then drew his wand and uttered a curse too low for Draco to identify. A thin stream of pink emanated from the tip of his wand, lining along the windowpane like glue. Then it vanished. Potter smiled.
Potter gave her a winning smile, the same one Draco had seen him use on professors and reporters. Undeniably appealing, undeniably fake. “Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy. You’ve been so generous tonight. And I have high hopes for tomorrow, I’m sure we finish up today’s work in a matter of short hours.”
But then, abruptly, as Harry heard the sound of the door swing open, Draco stopped talking. For a moment, it was dead silent, and fear iced its way through Harry’s veins.
“You know, places like Hogwarts are so well-protected because they’ve had centuries of spells cast and recast. Scores of different wands throwing those spells, not just a small handful. Not just a lifetime of security established in a single day,” she explained, perceptive and answering the exact question Draco hadn’t been bold enough to ask.
Draco cleared his throat, already throwing open his wardrobe and searching for a pressed shirt. “Yes, mother,” he replied.
To his credit, Potter said nothing of the strange arrangement. Yet. They had still to discuss the four-postered elephant in the room.
“Potter?” Draco heard himself say. He called him over, and didn't let himself dwell on how Potter came without question. He led them to the kitchen.
It was Andromeda’s suggestion (and likely her influence) that brought Draco to the situation currently facing him: a room full of aurors in the great hall. His mother had politely appealed to the department for assistance, and with the persuasion and pockets of a Black, she had succeeded in securing their help. Monday morning, and a small team was gathered in the Manor, prepared to protect their house from spells and intrusions. Even the Malfoy name wasn’t enough to deter them, and it was quite obvious the department had sent over some of its best witches and wizards. And a trainee. One trainee. One
his whole cohort of aurors were in his house, weren’t they? This wasn’t a quick blowjob in the dorms, miles away from the Malfoys and their reputation. Draco had just shagged Harry Potter in full earshot of his entire family and the nation’s most reputable cursebreakers.
