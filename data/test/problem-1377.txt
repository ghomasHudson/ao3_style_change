“Thanks, Ari.” Draco flashed him a brilliant smile before taking the arm Potter offered him.
“You’re going to drink it and you’re going to like it.” Ron pushed the mug back in front of him with an evil smirk. “Those are the rules. When it’s your turn to buy we have to drink whatever you pick. Fair is fair.”
; did he even have time for this self-indulgence? Craning around to look at the clock he quickly calculated whether or not he did and then decided that he could be a little late. As he looked back in the mirror he caught a flash of a double chin and felt a fluttering in his belly. That looked closer than the dizzying and decadent thought of plump breasts. A part of him wanted to cancel for the night and do a extravagant take-out order and stuff his belly up until it was stiff, rounded and hard rather than opulently soft and sinking. He could feel himself already starting to sweat just thinking about it and reached down to stroke his hardening cock. His belly bulged out to one side as he reached down and that made his heart beat faster still. He didn’t think he’d ever want to deal with the problems of being so large that he couldn’t reach and get himself off, but the fantasy of the idea did fill him with a thrilling sense of sumptuous surrender.
“Where’ve you been living? The way you talk is different,” he asked instead. Draco was almost disappointed that Potter wasn’t more curious about just how he’d gotten so fat. So fat that it was actually hard not to find himself pressing in against him, one leg going out bracing out in front of him as someone was crowding in behind him with their own impressively large belly to order a drink. They apologized, gesturing bashfully at their own thick gut and Draco assured them that there was no harm done. He tried not to focus too much on how close he was to Potter; it was one thing to talk to him, but the idea of initiating anything further seemed reckless.
Yes, this time was definitely worse, he thought as he smoothed a hand over the rounded bulge of his middle. This time it was
For his entire life he’d been thin, and at times, painfully so. He’d gotten a bit more muscular when he’d been on the Quidditch team, but once he’d quit he quickly lost the muscle and the lines of his ribs were evident, a sharp jut at each of his hipbones and delicate looking collar bones. But turning to the mirror, he blushed as he could see where the fat was starting to swell out just below his navel, a softness he’d never seen on his body before. It wasn’t enough that it’d interrupt the flow of much of his wardrobe but as he balked at his untoned middle and how quickly it’d come on, the fearful thought of very soon finding himself bursting out of every stitch of his clothing made his chest clench.
“Weren’t you dating the Weasley girl?” Draco asked. He regretted it almost immediately, watching Potter deflate even more.
It crossed his mind in planning the trip that maybe he should go to see his parents, but he decided against it. Not because he’d gotten so bloody fat, but because he doubted that they’d forgiven him for the damning testimony he’d given to the Wizengamot. Strangely, he was at peace with it. Despite now weighing more than sixty kilos more than when he’d last seen them, he felt like he could take any shock or criticism they might throw at him. There might come a time when he forced himself to extend that hand back out to them, but he doubted that it would be any time soon.
He gains the next ten kilos. And then the next. Switching that number over to the American system, it meant he was closing up onto the dreaded 300 hundred pounds that he often heard bemoaned by American tourists glutting out on the pastries, cheeses and wines of Paris.
Honestly, he felt fortunate not to be afflicted with an embarrassing nose bleed as they walked through the door. Blaise excused himself to get them drinks and left Draco to collect himself. The theme of course was large; large bellies, large muscles and generous combinations of both. Not everyone was fat, but there was as much shameless adoration of a heavy body as there was of the leaner ones.
he have a personality of his own? Playing the gay, catty bitch
And so, he disappeared again and it was almost shocking how predictable his pattern became; too many bloody pastries as he indulged what was apparently an incredibly vicious sweet tooth and rich. Carb-loaded take-outs because yes, he
“Ruination,” she finally said, repeating the word softly with a little laugh. “Is that what you think of being fat as well?”
“I thought you might like it here,” he said simply, eyeing a man of his own with bulging, thick arms and an especially potbellied look to him. No arse though, but each to their own. Blaise and his boyfriend had agreed to take a break and explore and finally, with not small measure of relief, Draco didn’t imagine a part of that vacation being with him. Not when his friend was in fact, so ludicrously tactful to take him to a leather bar instead of accusing him of being a disgusting, bloated freak. Oh, if his parents could see him now in this den of inequity, entirely obliterating the chances of producing an heir to their lands and fortune. Even if he himself did currently look pregnant with twins, at least.
it. He was glad that the gain had plateaued so that he could properly appreciate this new, engorged state of his body. He was undoubtably pear-shaped, a wise arse and thick thighs that touched nearly down to the knee. He didn’t have too many stretch marks, Adrienne having intervened one day when she saw him scratch himself bloody from the itching. She gave him a whole slew of options for caring for his skin. He sunk his hands in, two generous handfuls and was grateful for the smooth, milky feeling it gave him.
“Ah,” Potter went on before leaning in gently so that he didn’t have to shout over the throbbing noise so loudly, “Please don’t mention that you saw me. I’m not really ready to have this splashed all over the front page.”
himself. He knew that on paper, he was categorically and undeniably obese but he still didn’t quite feel that he looked
“Would you like to go somewhere quieter?”
More than thirty kilos over the course of just over a year; it was a massive amount of weight to gain. And he
“You came here for a reason, didn’t you?”
Before anyone could stop him, he gathered his things and started to make his way home. He’d had just the slightest taste of a social life that didn’t operate on the edge of life or death and completely forgotten just how valuable it was to preserve that. Walking away, he tried not to panic at the prospect of never getting a chance at it again.
But instead he leaned forward, and swore he heard the stool creak as there was a brief lull in the music.
It was liberating. He didn’t know how else to think of it; to have eaten himself out of so many sets of clothes as to become entirely unrecognizable from his former self was thrilling. He hadn’t dared to imagine returning to London nearly the whole of the time he’d been living in Paris but while he felt little impulse to do so, it was good to know that he had no reason to be fearful of it.
“I saw that back there.” She said quietly, pointedly avoiding his gaze. “You’re worried about him, aren’t you?”
“Well, for your first time having sex with a man, I’d say you did rather well.” Draco drawled, trailing his fingers across Harry’s chest. He traced his scars one by one and Harry shuddered beneath his touch.
“Why?” Draco asked quietly and Harry glanced over at him. He was staring at his hands, his eyes unreadable.
"Your ex told you to… pursue me?" Draco was flabbergasted.
“Nothing with tequila this time, yeah?” Neville gave Dean a meaningful look as he turned towards the bar.
“I used the same charm theory George uses to make dung bombs, but with water I took from the ocean. It was a little difficult, but I got it in the end. I’m glad you like it.” Hermione beamed at him from her post by the door.
“Only you could ever think of something so off the wall to say. My subconscious is definitely not that clever.” He conceded.
No sooner had the words left his mouth than he lost his balance, throwing his arms out to try and steady himself.
“Where’s Vince?” He asked weakly. Greg shook his head then screamed as a fire serpent crawled up his back. Draco cast a shield charm around them, wildly hoping it would work.
“Well, I certainly can’t fault him for that.” He chuckled. “Look at those two, still stealing glances.”
“I take that to mean that you know.” He turned to Ari with an exaggerated grimace.
“Thank you for listening, you have no idea how much it means to me.” He pulled her in for a quick hug.
“If any of you have any questions about dancing, I suggest you direct your inquiries to Mr. Malfoy here. He seems to be an expert. You are all dismissed.” He intoned before sweeping from the room, his black robes billowing behind him in a dramatic flare.
“You should be in Azkaban!” An old lady screamed shrilly.
“I can fix your nose if you stand still.” Tonks sighed, coming to a stop and pointing her wand in his face
"Not Anthony Goldstein?" Draco gasped conspiratorially.
"Take it! Merlin knows I don't want the bloody thing. " He growled,  ripping the locket from his neck and throwing it across the tent.
“Happy to be of service.” Draco carefully peeled a twenty pound note from the stack and handed it to Harry before accepting the coins.
“Sod off!” Harry flushed in embarrassment. “He had mead dribbling from his chin, it looked ridiculous!”
He set to work casting healing and scouring charms on himself in equal measure. The trickiest part was healing his own ribs. They weren’t broken, thank Salazar, but they were cracked from the multiple kicks and the eye Harry had touched was red and swollen. He thanked his lucky stars he was adept at healing, maintaining a steady stream of magic until all of the throbbing stopped. He studied his reflection critically for a moment before deciding this was as good as it was going to get. He put his wand back in its sheath and fingered the stick of eyeliner Pansy had given him after he told her Harry had complimented it. He already had on a light layer, but it couldn’t hurt to touch it up. He gave in, thickening the black lines beneath his eyes before he left to search for where Harry had gotten to.
“Alright, fine. What seems to be the problem?” Granger’s tone was long-suffering.
“Well that didn’t sound too bad, all things considered.” Harry muttered distractedly.
“Them! At the top of the stairs! Look at them! They’re forcing others to witness their abomination!” She cried and Draco sneaked a glance over his shoulder.
"Both. " Harry said matter of factly.
“Do you still incorporate your personal experiences into your lectures?”
Draco could tell that the question was meant to be rhetorical but he answered anyway.
It was Ron and Hermione and himself sitting side by side at the Gryffindor table in the great hall. Hermione’s nose was scrunched up in amusement and Ron’s mouth was wide open, obviously in mid-laugh. Harry could almost hear the bark-like guffaw through the picture. Then there he was, lips curved in a smirk as he tried not to laugh. He remembered this day. It was one of the last carefree days they had had before the war started in earnest.
“How long has this been going on?” His father arched a graceful eyebrow.
“Have some faith, Potter. I can be professional.” Malfoy rolled his eyes “I’m not the same person you knew in school. I think you'll find that I've changed quite a bit, despite my outburst earlier. Right now I’m just a healer who wants to help you overcome your inner demons. Everything that happens in this room today stays in this room. I will even withhold what you share from Healer Grey if you ask me to. I can leave our past at the door if you are willing to do the same.”
“Thank you, my Lord.” They droned in unison.
"Fuck, Malfoy." Harry cried his rapture to the empty room.
They exchanged idle chit chat while they drank their coffee and Draco marveled, not for the first time, at how absurdly easy it was to talk to Harry. He could have never imagined exchanging such easy banter back at Hogwarts. They had seemed too far apart, impossibly separated by the war.
“What’s wrong with billiards?” Draco asked after finishing his drink.
Essence of dittany should be applied as quickly as possible to stop the burn from spreading. Clean the wound of any ash or debris, then reapply the essence of dittany to aid in replacing any lost skin. Once the burn is saturated, draw your wand and use this incantation:
“No. No, absolutely not.” He crossed his arms stubbornly.
"I'll keep that in mind." Draco snorted, thinking of all the lies he's had to tell his father.
“Lucky is more like it. It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Draco smiled, fighting the urge to flex his fingers just to make sure they weren’t broken after that handshake.
“Better. I haven’t won a game against him yet. He loves to swindle his friends out of their money on their pub nights.” Dean smirked.
The rest of the night passed by in a blur with a few glaring moments that stood out.
“Yeah, I think so.” Harry nodded, eager to please.
"Not really, just to endorse them." Harry shrugged.
Vernon moved so quickly Draco barely registered it until the back of his hand made contact with Harry’s face.
Harry’s voice sounded like velvet and Draco grudgingly turned to look at him. Theo slipped a possessive arm around his waist and Draco had to resist the urge to push him away. That would not go over well.
“Tell me something I don’t know.” Pansy chuckled. “He asked where you went when you disappeared earlier.”
“How are we doing teams this time?” Neville swayed slightly on his feet as they gravitated towards the cue holster.
George avoids looking in the mirror because he doesn't want to see Fred. Harry makes a decision and is outraged that no one told him he was in love with Draco before he figured it out for himself. Draco does something very un-Malfoyish and a house-elf randomly appears in Draco's home.
“I know. It’s just...hard.” Harry said softly as George released him.
“I’m sure.” Draco scoffed and looked away.
He gave her one last look that he hoped said everything he wasn’t able to say; I’m sorry, thank you, I love you.
He had reached his limit on embarrassing innuendos and jokes made at his expense. Miraculously, all of his father’s teasing seemed to go over Harry’s head. It certainly didn’t go over Bill’s, however, and Draco was painfully aware of the knowing smirk plastered all over his face.
“What is Master Draco wanting to be knowing?”
The Great Hall was a cacophony of sounds the next morning and Draco was absolutely miserable. It felt as if every last one of his brain cells was swimming through treacle tart and his ears seemed to have become absurdly sensitive overnight. He groaned when the hall filled with hissing and muttering, rubbing his temples with his fingers. He looked up to discover the source of the angry noises and grimaced when he saw Potter walking to the Gryffindor table, eyes set straight ahead and a determined frown playing at those distracting lips.
“Yeah. Right. Of course.” He said tonelessly, shoving all of his emotions into a drawer and locking them away to deal with later. He had a job to do.
“You want to brake?” Dean offered Draco the cue ball.
“Vince!” Draco cried in shock, eyes going wide at the jet of green light that had erupted from the end of his wand. Granger dove to the side and Harry sent stunning spells in their direction. Curses were flying every which way and Draco was appalled to see more green join the throng of reds and oranges.
“Sure, sounds fun.” Dean hooked his arm around Seamus, pulling him to his side rather roughly.
He pointed his wand at Longbottom, immobilizing him so he could force the sorting hat over his head. By unspoken consent, both sides drew their wands. They stood in a stalemate against each other with the Dark Lord and Longbottom in the middle of no man’s land.
For the second time that morning, he was cut off by a loud crack.
This started a trend of studying one day and getting to know one another better the next. It turned into a long string of lunches and non-dates. They saw each other almost every day for the next few weeks, and Draco was flabbergasted to discover that he could- in fact- fall even harder for Harry sodding Potter. They met at coffee shops and libraries every bit as often as they visited arcades or went flying. On a few occasions, they even took leisurely strolls through parks or museums.
"I-" Draco paused as dim memories of Pansy saying she was happy she wouldn't be the only Slytherin there for once surfaced. He tried to hide his grimace but the knowing look in Harry’s eyes told him he hadn’t succeeded. "Are you sure they'll even want me there?"
“Oh, how boring.” Pansy stuck out her tongue in distaste, clearly tipsy.
"Your father loves you, Draco. I know he's hard on you, but he's only doing what he thinks is best." His mother seemed to read his mind.
“Any suggestions on how to improve?” Draco kept his eyes fixed on her, not meeting the curious gazes he could feel burning the back of his skull from his friends.
Perhaps
“Oh, er—ah, right; cheers, Malfoy.”
Truthfully, Draco didn’t all that often leave with anyone. He liked his body; enough so that he’d become very selective as to who he allowed to touch it. There were a few who he thought pampered him in such a way that all this pageantry signalled his desire for.
(See the end of the chapter for
He stopped going to the gym because he couldn't bear to see Blaise and didn't have the energy to find a new one. He didn’t answer the invitations that were sent to him even when, surprisingly, one came from Adrienne. Blaise’s comment had been brief but incisive and made him face an unhappy question about himself;
“I’m sure you can piece together the general idea,” Draco purred. “But maybe you’d be more satisfied inspecting for yourself?”
Assured that any new weight wasn’t the result of an all consuming depression, he stepped on with confidence. He blushed a little as he realized that he had to shift around the swell of his belly a little to get a proper look at the dial; so, when it landed he already knew to expect a higher number than he’d seen the last time.
“You work?” Harry asked. At that, Draco felt a flare of annoyance.
Everyone once in a while he marvelled in just how fat he’d gotten. He’d simply been so thin before. But even more than that, he was bewildered by how ashamed of the extra weight he’d been. He looked
He saw people that
Draco had moved to their Paris residence shortly after both his parents received guilty verdicts through the Wizengamot. He needed desperately to be away from the world most surely to shun him. His own case had been rather straightforward given that he was a minor and granted a wide berth of leniency; particularly after giving little resistance to testifying against his own parents. And then since, his guilty conscience was eating him as quickly as he was eating out every pastry shop that he passed. And there was the fact too that he simply did not know how to cook, so ate out each day for every meal. There was a freedom to it, in eating without restraint and easily relinquishing himself to gluttony. Thinness wasn’t something that’d been too vocally impressed on him as a child but it was always strictly expected of him. It confounded him as to why it hadn’t even crossed his mind that this was where he was heading off to, a little, growing mound of lard making it difficult to close his bloody trousers.
Everyone looked awe-struck, and a number looked confused or disgusted.
“Thank you, Potter.” He smirked, tilting his head ever so slightly.
“You wouldn’t!” Daphne sat up in horror.
“Come on, we better get going.” Ron grimaced. “Don’t want to miss the test because we’re late.”
“Oh, you proposed on Christmas? That’s awfully brave.” Harry shot Nott a friendly grin which he returned almost instantly.
She gave him an understanding smile before shooing him away. His father’s study wasn’t terribly far from the library and he reached it in record time. He didn’t remember to knock until it was almost too late.
"This has hands down been the best birthday I've ever had." He sighed happily.
“I don’t need you to fight my battles for me.” Harry bit angrily.
“I’m being ridiculous, aren’t I?” He couldn’t help but laugh at himself.
“Well if it isn't the Weasel and Weaselette.” Draco laughed. “Welcome to the snake den.”
Draco’s breath caught in his chest. Did Harry mean he wanted to talk in the future?
“Oh. Er, it’s the second Wednesday of the month.” Harry accepted his cup gratefully, instantly taking a sip as if trying to avoid explaining himself.
“Me either.” Vince grinned as he and Draco followed suit, leaning their brooms next to Greg’s.
“Alright, alright.” Seamus glared at Ron good-naturedly. “If you’re happy, Harry, I’m happy.”
Harry made eye contact with Zach and tilted his head slightly, indicating that he would go around and take the back. Zach nodded to show that they understood and withdrew into the shadows. Harry pulled out his invisibility cloak and slipped it over his head, moving as quickly as he dared to the back of the derelict building.
“Go! You need to escape!” Draco shoved him towards his friends.
“They do.” Harry agreed. “Now, do you want birthday pie while it’s still hot from the oven, or presents first?”
“It worked out in the end.” Fred waved his hand dismissively.
"Maybe you and Draco can kick their sorry arses." Neville snorted, sitting down in the chair Draco had just vacated.
When his friends did eventually corner him about avoiding them it was nice to see that they cared, but he could never open up to them the way he does with Sirius. He didn’t want them to think he was weak. He didn’t see the need to stop hanging out with Sirius in Buckbeak’s room, so he just made more of an effort to spend time with everyone else too. Harry was pleased to see Sirius join him in this venture. He even started singing carols as they helped everyone decorate for Christmas. It seemed their daily talks were doing both of them some good then. Harry was really going to miss them when he went back to Hogwarts.
The Goblet of Fire makes a mistake that changes the course of history. Harry is forced into a binding magical contract and forced to participate in a deadly tournament.
“Oi, I’ve heard enough from you lot! She’s here because I want her here. If any of you have a problem with it, I’ll duel you right here right now.” Pansy hissed.
“I didn’t even want to break up with him! He brought it up!” His voice shook with poorly concealed distress as she backed him against the wall, wand poking his throat. “There was no reasoning with him, he was stark raving-”
He was alive!
“I’m not.”
“Well, I’ll kick his arse for it when he gets out of Azkaban.” Theo whispered. “Come on, let's get you up to your room.”
“Oi, sod off. She was my best friend first.” Draco whined, earning a roar of laughter from Harry, Granger, and his father while his mother chided him for his language.
Harry had kissed him.
“I’m not asking him for anything.” He scowled at her “I certainly don’t need the money.”
“He deserved what he got.” Vernon hissed.
Worse!
“You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! Don’t you ever listen? The wand chooses the wizard. The Elder wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who had never even touched it. They removed it from Dumbledore against his will without even realizing what they had done, or that the most powerful wand in existence had given them it’s allegiance. The true master of the Elder wand was Draco Malfoy.” Harry gave off an air of confidence and Draco’s blood drained from his face.
“Likewise.”  Bill inclined his head respectfully.
“Order for me.” He shut his menu as she approached.
Harry finally looked up at him, eyes wide in surprise.
“Electronically? You mean like the boombox and those horrid humming contraptions that produce light?” Draco tried to mask his apprehension.
“You alright?” He frowned.
They had been playing two-a-side quidditch with Greg and Vince every chance they got. Pansy always opted to be the referee. She was more interested in her nails than a quaffle. As long as Draco and Theo split up the games were somewhat fair. Both Greg and Vince were horrible, Theo and Draco were very good. It evened out in the end, and it gave them all an excuse to get out of the manor.
Would he ever stop haunting him?
"Forget it," Harry couldn’t help the grin that was slowly spreading across his face.
“That sounds terrible.” Draco shuddered, passing the bottle back to Harry.
“It really bothers you, doesn't it?” Her pink lips settled into a pout as she eyed his forehead.
“Just cover us if anything goes wrong.” Bill rolled his eyes.
Draco trembled slightly as he felt Harry’s hands moving hungrily across his body. Was this really happening? He leaned forward until Harry’s feet were firmly back on the ground before taking complete control of the kiss.
“The court calls Narcissa Malfoy to the stand.” Kingsley Shacklebolt said in a serene manner.
“Please, continue, your highness.” Harry smirked.
"It's your birthday." Harry shrugged. "It's not every day you turn nineteen."
“Yeah, or whatever you’d prefer, on a day where we have more time?” Draco really hoped he didn’t sound as desperate as he felt.
“It was good, thank you for asking.” Draco looked slightly mollified by the small victory. “How was yours?”
“Well, then how do you suppose he got chosen?” Tracy seemed equal parts annoyed and genuinely curious.
“You’d be completely lost without me.” She laughed, wiping something wet under each eye before rubbing it in with her fingers. “Just one more thing,” she was back with the round sponge type thing and Harry had to suppress a shudder at the way her fingers hovered ever so gently on his cheekbones. “And done! That’s loads better. You look ready to take on the front page of tomorrow's Prophet.”
"Thank you. I’m pleased to see you, too." Draco turned towards Neville and shook his hand with a pleasantly surprised expression. "Having a good summer so far?"
Ever since the dementors had swarmed the black lake in third year, nearly killing him and Sirius, Harry had started withdrawing more and more into himself. Hermione was worried. A small part of her feared that Harry would never get better. He was much too young to have so much responsibility thrust upon his shoulders.
“A pint sounds lovely!” Luna said brightly, giving Blaise a welcoming kiss on the cheek.
Narcissa fell in line, still holding tightly to Lucius as they began to march out of the forest and towards Hogwarts as one. She tutted impatiently when he released her hand to pick something up off the forest floor. A wand? She only caught a glimpse of it as he slipped it into his robe pocket, but she would recognize that wand anywhere.
“You were a good father, don’t say that. You made sure I was taken care of and raised properly and-”
The ministry has fallen. Hogwarts is being run by Death Eaters. Harry realizes something profound and Draco does what he can to help. How will this first year of open war end?
“There is no need to stay, Nymphadora. Potter is- ah- quite safe in my hands.”
“I hate you.” He called as she closed the changing stall door behind him.
“Ron!” Harry and Hermione snapped at the same time. Hermione sounded angry, but Harry almost sounded amused.
Pansy and Hermione had somehow melded magic and muggle technology seamlessly into their home, and the magic seemed to negate the painful soundwaves of the electricity, he simply wanted no part of it. He had to admit that he felt strangely at ease here, but he still wanted all traces of electricity removed from his house before moving in. Although it had taken a bit longer than anticipated, they had finally finished gutting all of the wires and placing the necessary charms to compensate for it two days ago. All that was left was to furnish it and move in.
“You don’t care that I’m...gay?” He couldn’t quite believe this was happening.
The first time he had gone out in public after the war he had been all but mauled by people who wanted to touch him or thank him for killing Voldemort. As if that was something he wanted to be praised for. They were relentless and by the time Ron had managed to drag him away from the adoring crowd his robes had been torn and his glasses broken. He had not ventured out into the wizarding world without a glamor ever since.
When he tried to pull away Draco tightened his hold on him.
“That’s the dark mark!” One woman gasped grotesquely, pointing at him with open disdain.
“Bring it on, Potter.”
“That you sound like quite the catch and that she’s glad you make me happy.” Draco shot him a quick wink and Harry flushed with pleasure.
“Exactly.” Harry smiled. “I know you’re not a fan of electricity, but I think you’ll want to give the movies a chance.”
“I want you there.” Harry insisted, setting his tea down and grabbing Draco’s hands.
“She wanted to use veritaserum on him. When Professor Snape informed her that she had already used it all to uncover their illegal dueling club she started weighing the pros and cons of using an unforgivable curse on a student. I tried to talk her down and offer alternatives. She fought me every step of the way until Granger pretended to cry and made up some crackpot story about a weapon being held in the forbidden forest, playing right into Professor Umbridge’s paranoia.”
“I did. I didn’t really have any desire to go back to drawing.” He set the tray down next to the overflowing box. “I drew a bit in the Ministry holding cell, but that was the only thing I could do. Somehow I don’t feel like that counts.”
“You alright?” Harry sounded concerned.
“I don’t like being human.” Harry grumbled.
He reminded Harry so much of Hermione at that moment that he suddenly understood how they had become friends so fast.
"Maybe Dumbledore put Potter's name in to ensure a Gryffindor champion and it backfired." Theo laughed, trying to relieve the tension.
Happy reading!
“Well, you found me. What’s up?” Hermione touched her elbow, pulling her off to the side where they had a small amount of privacy.
He was filled with a mixture of relief at having succeeded and dread at what he had to do next. He swallowed back the bile that had risen in his throat and touched his dark mark, letting the Dark Lord know he had finally accomplished the first half of his task.
“I’m sorry, Ron. I can’t. My stomach’s all wobbly.” He grimaced, pushing the food away.
“What she means is that we care about you and want to help you. Please, let us help you.” Hermione stepped closer, reaching out to grab some part of him.
When Malfoy took Dumbledore's offer of protection Harry hadn’t considered the fact that *he* would be the one doing the protecting.
“I should be thanking you, actually.” Draco hummed as he set down the latte.
“Don’t you dare, Potter.” Draco dug his heels into the floor when Harry tried to pull him onto his lap.
“Yes, my Lord. We will not disappoint you again.” Lucius’s voice was strained and tears stained his cheeks.
“I heard there are going to be some hot shots from London scoping out some of the performances.” Draco said conversationally.
"I went for a drive." He smiled apologetically.
“No, I’ve always been able to. Why, is that what happened to you?” Draco asked eagerly, then blushed. “I’m sorry, that was rude. It’s none of my business.”
George pulled him in for a bear hug before planting a kiss on the top of his head and shoving him back in the direction he had been heading. Unfortunately, during the song the dancers had all shifted and he ran straight into the one person he wanted to see the least. Or was it most? He couldn’t really tell anymore.
“Married into the Gaunt family.” Harry finished the sentence, happy to know at least something. “But that line died out completely because Morfin and Voldemort both never had children.”
“What brings you to my study, then?” His father seemed perplexed.
“That will conclude the questioning for Lucius Malfoy’s case.” Kingsley cut off the arguments that were being shouted. “Harry, do you wish to testify on Narcissa Malfoy’s behalf?”
“Merlin, yes. It’s time we reclaimed our home as a place of peace and joy.” Narcissa sighed.
“Draco!” Pansy and his mother coursed this time.
He knew it was inevitable- they’d have to face each other sooner rather than later. They were the leads in this bloody ballet so total avoidance was impossible.
He was out of his seat the instant Harry’s name left her lips.
“It’s alright.” Ari sniffed. “I should have known better than to fall in love with a muggle. I knew I would never be able to be completely honest with him because of the Statute of Secrecy and I pursued him anyway.”
Happy Reading!
Harry gave him a calculating look before nodding curtly.
“That’s right, Harry.” His mother smiled. “How long has this been going on?”
“I think that’s why it took me so long to notice how much I care about you. I was so wrapped up in worrying about him and our long-distance relationship, but I haven’t been really happy with him in a while. You make me happy, though.”
Humiliation.
The villa was big, but it had an open floor plan so it was easy to find his way around. He was lounging by himself in a secuded corner at the poolside in no time. There were lanterns strung up across the entire area, giving the water a welcoming glow. There were a few people milling about and sitting with their feet in the water as they laughed and joked together. It was a miracle no one had noticed him yet. He was perfectly happy brooding in the shadows.
“Harry, would you zip me up?” Ginny interrupted, exposing her bare back to him and pulling her long auburn hair to the side.
“I consent.” Harry chimed in. Every eye in the room turned towards him and he squirmed uncomfortably.
“Why?”
"Oh yes, Harry made sure the information was well known after the trials. I can't imagine being a slave to another's will for so long. Your father must be a remarkable man." Andromeda warmed the pot before letting the tea steep.
“Honestly? Me neither.” He laughed.
“I’m quite proud of you. I've heard through the grapevine that the story was written by a talented protege. It is bound to attract a lot of media attention and there is a good chance that a number of influential professionals from London will be attending the performances.” She took a refined sip.
“Spit it out, Potter.” Draco teased.
“Then what is it?”
“And how is it that you know?” Draco snapped, suddenly defensive.
“They’re good together.” Harry said somewhat lamely after they left.
“Not even close.” Draco snorted before walking away, still chucking.
A soft woosh announced the owl’s arrival and Harry turned around. The regal-looking bird sat perched on the railing, regarding him curiously.
It was mildly disconcerting and Harry was grateful he had talked Draco into only changing their hair and eye color. He would have hated seeing Draco smile so much with someone else's face.
He had given Draco a brief tour, begging his pardon for the mess of the nearly finished renovations. Since Draco hadn’t seen Number Twelve in all of its former ignominy Harry hadn’t expected him to be overly impressed, so Draco’s level of enthusiasm was a pleasant surprise. He had complimented the addition of a magical window in the basement kitchen and the minimal modernization of the kitchen equipment. They had to step around the debris of the wall that had once held Walabarga’s portrait on their way upstairs, but Draco didn’t seem to mind.  Harry had vanished all of the carpets on the first floor, opting for a more manageable hawthorn hardwood. It brightened the place up considerably when paired with the storm grey paint he had replaced the dark and dusty wallpaper with. Where once there were horrid portraits and prickly dark artifacts Harry had put pictures of his friends and Teddy. He had replaced the old grandfather clock that shot bolts at people when they walked by with a display case that currently held the snitch Dumbeldore had left him, the two halves of his old Holly wand that were still connected by Fawks’s tailfeather, the photo album Hagrid had made for him of his parents, and the ruddy paper swan Draco had given him after their origami class a couple of weeks ago. Draco noted the place of honor given to the folded bird with a satisfied smirk that had Harry pulling him up the stairs.
“We were worse.” She leaned forward and gently kissed his lips.
“And brought up blood purity with little to no tact whatsoever.” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “No wonder you didn’t like me.”
Oh Merlin.
“Consider me intrigued.”
"It was a good game." Harry clapped Ron on the shoulder. "You and Nev did pretty well."
“Am I dreaming?” He couldn’t help but wonder out loud.
“Mind if I sit with you?”
"Thanks, that’s exactly the look I was going for.” He huffed indignantly. Draco couldn’t respond, breaking into a fresh burst of laughter every time he looked at Harry.
It was obvious Potter made him happy. As he scrutinized Potter’s posture and facial expressions he decided that Draco made Potter happy too. That was good enough for him.
"Did he kill him?" He was proud that his voice didn't even tremble as he asked after Harry's fate.
-What are you accusing me of, Smith?-Draco said. And Harry was glad to hear him standing up for himself.
-Are you dating Luna?-Harry finally asked, turning his whole body to Draco. A couple of heads turned to them too, but neither Draco nor Harry cared.
-Ginny?-Harry asked, shocked. Draco nodded,-As friends?-Draco shook his head. Harry needed a moment to process it,-How do you even know it?
Draco was slammed against the door. Not fighting back at all, he was still held by 3 pretty strong looking Ravenclaws. Their “leader”, Michael Harris was standing in front of Draco, looking at him with rage and excitement in his eyes. Draco looked back at him with a cold smirk and confident stare Harry was starting to miss.
-Yeah. Very active and very open one. I’m shocked you didn’t know. She just asked me if Granger was “available”.
-But he is a hero who would have done anything for his family. For his son. Mine wouldn’t,-it felt like Draco’s words were supposed to be drenched in sarcasm, but they weren’t. At all,-Forget it. I don’t know why I just told all of this. Thanks for the eye,-Draco started getting up, but Harry made a risky move and grabbed his hand.
None of them talked about it throughout the whole holidays. On the next day after that conversation Harry, Ron and Hermione woke up a little earlier to hop on the train and leave the Hogwarts for the holidays for the last time ever and spend them at the Burrow. Harry was glad to see Ginny and Luna waiting for them on the train. Harry was even more glad when 5 of them managed to have fun during their trip with no awkward tension ex-lovers tend to have. Ginny didn’t let go of Luna’s hand till they arrived, despite weird stares they got from time to time. Harry admired and envied their bravery. And their love.
Actually, Harry wondered if those people had changed and how. He imagined how Hogwarts would greet him just in couple hours and how people would look at him. He didn’t want any praise, he just hoped that the warm feeling of being home Harry had every time he had crossed Hogwarts doors wouldn’t disappear.
-MALFOY!-strong arms of Terry Boot and Megan Jones pulled him away from Harry before the irreversible could happen. They congratulated and praised him, so did they whole class. Ron, too, didn’t seem to be upset that Draco was the one who brought them victory.
The tone of the day changed over a second. They didn’t even notice how Draco received a letter too, and started reading it. Harry kept thinking of ways he could help Molly, the woman who was kind enough to always be there for him, to treat him like her own son, to be the mother he had lost.
-It’s…It’s a muggle expression,-Harry rushed to explain himself,-Means “Good luck”,-Harry smiled weakly, but Draco just shook his head in shock.
-And why would you need it?
-I hope so,-Draco said, but allowed Harry to hold his hands. Trusted him. It was flattering. So flattering that Harry started getting nervous and the clear picture of their destination he was supposed to imagine wouldn’t come to his head.
-Of course I like you,-Harry said, which was god’s truth. Still, he felt very uncomfortable talking about his feelings. Especially with the third party present,-But…
-That’s not beating up, Potter,-Draco scoffed and got into his bed, marking an end of this conversation. Harry stood there for another second, just trying to process what just happened, and laid down too. Sleep hadn’t come relatively soon to either of them
He fell off the broom. Fortunately, the height wasn’t big enough for him to get hurt. By the time Harry landed next Draco, Malfoy was shockingly starring at the round object in his hand.
-Knock on your head, Potter-Draco opened the door so quickly that Harry’s fist was left hanging in the air. At first Potter froze, but then put his fist down and smiled.
Seconds lasted like hours. Draco was physically shaking, yet just the presence of calm and tough Potter made him feel better. Made him feel protected. He looked at him and back at Kingsley.
-Are you done, Mr. Malfoy?-Kingsley asked. Draco was standing up, all alone against at least 50 people. He was on verge of tears.
glass. He wasn’t sure. But he definitely wasn’t feeling so much now.
-Of course no,-Harry said and another name added to the table. And another; Ernie McMillan, a Hufflepuff student joined them after a minute of thinking. Now they needed a Slytherin.
-Yes,-Draco didn’t look away, didn’t stutter. And Harry immediately felt more sober. Malfoy offered him his hand and Harry took it. Together they paced into the center of the Hall, not even looking at other staring at him, not looking at anything but each other. And a slow song started. They danced carefully, still with considerable distance between each other, but as song progressed, both of them felt a little more relaxed.
Turns out, there is nothing quite as forgettable as one victory in the school sports game. Despite Harry’s and Ron’s high expectations, it took Hogwarts less than a week to erase that legendary catch Malfoy performed from their memories. Draco wasn’t really surprised though. He didn’t allow himself to get used to all the attention he suddenly started getting; in the end, it was just a first game, there were others in the future and no one guaranteed Draco would be able to pull off a move like that again.
-Thank you, loser,-Harry smirked. By the time they realized they were still holding hands, Ron and Hermione approached them.
-Mister Malfoy!-he heard a loud voice behind himself and saw Filch running towards him. Draco sighed,-Mister Malfoy!-poor old man was out of breath and carrying around his old fat cat didn’t help much too.
-Yes and no,-Pansy said,-I just miss this place. Can you believe that? I miss the school,- Draco smiled understandingly,-We hated it here! And now I miss it!
-Not much of a choice, mate,-Ron smirked,-Malfoy or Zabini. I recommend the second one,-even despite the evil stare he received from Blaise earlier, Harry agreed. He thought and hoped it would be easier with Zabini. Until he saw him walking out of another dorm, without his bag.
Draco really was weirdly unenergetic during the first hour of the game. Harry always kept an eye on him, and sometimes he wanted to yell : “WHY THE HELL ARE YOU JUST HANGING THERE?”
-Why?-Ron was deeply surprised. Harry just shrugged.
-Me and Pansy? Merlin no!-he laughed,-Have you even seen her, she’s gay!
All 8th year students were asked to follow Headmistress McGonagall once the Sorting ceremony was over. It was nice to be led by her, personally. Took them back to their first year. Minerva brought students to the tower they hadn’t seen before and stopped in front of the tall wooden doors. She smiled warmly at everyone. It looked like she was happy to see every single student who came back. She really was.
-We are now,-Harry said for him.
-Try this one first,-Ron had to physically push Harry into the changing room – Harry kept whining and bickering,-Even if you don’t want to impress anyone,-Ron started as Harry was changing,-Where’s your competitive spirit? Malfoy’s gonna be all dressed up, you gotta beat him.
-Thank you! I owe you one!
Thank you for reading!
-Y-yes,-Harry slowly walked towards the couch. By the time he reached it he noticed that the room was almost empty, only Malfoy was quietly writing something at the table next to the fireplace. Probably the only person Ginny didn’t manage to kick out.
-You’re in love with him,-he said. Harry stared at him with shock.
-What?
-Do you promise? Draco?-she asked again. And again. Draco looked at Harry and at Madam Polkinghorne, looking for help, but what could they say? Harry felt especially helpless.
-That’s just stupid. We can’t choose who to share our dorm with?-Ron asked, not believing him.
Lucy and Draco, with their perfect harmony, tried to distract Harry when they saw how his mood suddenly went down. And when it was time to go to sleep, Lucy demanded a personal bed-time story from both of them.
-I have to say this,-he said. He was halfway done with the paste,-It’s so weird seeing you like this.
-I’m giving it to you. It doesn’t really matter though,-Draco whispered and sat down on his bed. He hid his face in his hands. Harry was scared to read what he was holding, what upset – or even shocked – Draco so much.
-I think I was nine. Maybe ten,-Draco started, trying the pizza. It wasn’t…bad. It was actually pretty okay, but Malfoy wouldn’t admit it,-We came to visit my grandparents. I don’t remember much.
-Shrong will show him around,-Madam Polkinghorne said and two elves walked away, both mumbling something.
-I’m just gonna say that we really had no idea who Malfoy actually was. Ever.
-Is that…?-Draco asked looking into the crowd. The music stopped, but over the chatter Harry still had difficulties hearing him.
-What if we skip Defense today?-Ron asked Harry, knowing he would never get a positive answer from Hermione,-I’m tired. And my Transfiguration essay isn’t even nearly done.
-Okay, Quidditch tryouts are tomorrow, who do you think will be the captain?-Ron jumped onto the seat between Harry and Hermione during the breakfast. Potter’s drink inevitably spilled right on his bacon, but Ron was too distracted by making out with his girlfriend to notice. By the time they finished, Harry already swapped their plates, waiting for Ron’s reaction as he tries pumpkin flavored bacon.
-Did you and Pansy ever date?-Harry tried to sound casual and indifferent, but let’s just say that if he paid half as much attention to the classes as he did to Draco’s answer, Hermione would have a competitor.
-Well, you will get the Seeker, that’s not even a question, mate,-Ron smirked.
-I don’t know when I’ll get another chance to talk to you properly,-she said, tone full of sarcasm.
-I’ve just been walking around with...
-Yeah, but it’s a good thing we did,-Hermione said. Ron smiled, obviously misunderstanding why Granger was so glad to be back,-We need to graduate to find proper jobs.
-Huh,-Hazel looked at them skeptically. Harry had an idea to take Draco’s hand, but at the last moment thought it would be too much,-Alright…See you around,-she left and only after her figure walked out of the library and disappeared in the halls, Harry could relax. He started laughing, unable to believe what just happened.
-It’s…I’ll explain later. I’m really tired and I have homework,-Harry got up. He imagined himself writing an essay now, after two long days and one very short night, and wanted to cry.
***************************************************
“I’ll take care of it.” She replied instantly and the triumph slipped from his face.
He had never imagined green could so perfectly mimic a raging inferno before. It stopped him in his tracks.
“Draco!” He cried and the slim figure turned at the sound of his voice.
“Nott.” She said warningly, her eyes flashing.
“I know, we’re evacuating.” Harry’s voice was like a cooling potion poured on a raw wound and Draco tried not to react. “Voldemort’s-”
On the drive home, they listened to music and Harry shared what it was like growing up in a home where he was seen as nothing more than an inconvenience and a burden. The more Harry shared the more Draco’s heart felt like it was breaking in his chest. No one deserved to be treated that way, least of all someone as kind as Harry. He placed a reassuring hand on Harry’s knee and did his best to convince him that he was incredible despite what his relatives made him believe. Each self-deprecating remark cut Draco like a knife. How could someone so caring care so little about themself? By the time they reached Harry’s complex, Draco thought he had at least managed to convince him that Draco thought he was extraordinary if nothing else. They exchanged a few parting pleasantries and Draco was relieved when he was able to make Harry smile with a lame pun. When Draco leaned in for their customary goodnight kiss Harry surprised him again by responding with an overwhelming amount of passion. Harry’s hand tangled in his hair as their lips moved desperately against each other. Harry’s kisses were unexpectedly hungry and Draco became lost in the heat of the moment. When Harry pulled back it took Draco an embarrassingly long time to recover and return to coherency. He was vaguely aware of being told to have a good night, then Harry was already halfway up the stairs leading to his apartment before Draco even realized he had left the car. He watched him disappear behind door 394 with a dazed expression and sat there for a long moment contemplating what had just happened and everything he had learned about his past.
, there were usually one or two men interested enough to bed him. But he realized, with a skip in his heart, that he’d never slept with another man quite so large as himself. As he got closer, Draco could see that this man hadn’t just propped up his heft chest with the leather straps but he’d also pierced each nipple. Draco felt his mouth go dry, imagining the cold steel on his tongue as he lapped at the thickness of the man’s chest.
After some muddling around on how to go about losing the weight that wasn’t just starving himself until he’d lost it, he did decide to go to a gym. After so much venom towards the Muggle world, coming into these horrid fluorescent lit rooms with their blaring, sharp sounding televisions and blasting music had actually become a place of calm for him. Getting lost in the oceans of electronic noise descended over him like obscuring cloak where he didn’t have to think or bother with anyone. No one knew him in these places; no chance of pointed stares or half-whispered insults getting to him and having to put the energy into a front telling the world that he
He didn’t know how much Blaise could guess at as to why he seemed positively unconcerned with losing any of the weight anymore. If he could guess that Draco had come to find the weight more than just acceptable but sexually arousing he never let on to it. Which, was good, considering he didn’t want their friendship to suffer for being a bloated pervert with an arse that threatened to demand a second chair at any moment.
Not a soul recognized him as he made his way through Knockturn Alley to Borgin and Burkes. The research library had asked him, seeing as he’d be in London anyways, to pick up some tomes they had on hold if he had the time. Borgin and Burkes themselves no longer managed the place, the new owner keeping the name for the reputation it held rather than risking changing it. So, there was no one to recognize him. He cast the appropriate spell to break the seal proving that yes indeed it was he who should be collecting the tomes and there was nothing further said.
He’s not sure how he gets pulled into it, but he’s going to London for a special, allegedly renowned leather party. Now outfitted with his own kit and settled in to a few extra kilos that edge him ever closer to the renowned three hundred club, he’s actually for the first time in a long time, quite nervous about his weight. In Paris with Blaise and Adrienne, it was an accepted thing and anyone beyond them hadn’t really ever met him when he’d been thin.
He tried not to stare, but it was hard, especially when so many of the men had cleverly designed harnesses to emphasis each of their assets. He was especially fixated on the man across the room with his chest bound in such a way to flatter his thick pectorals. There was too much muscle for them to really resemble the kind of soft breast like quality his own had developed, but for that reason it practically had him salivating. Maybe he could spend a little more time bulking up his upper half.
He looked properly fat now, that was undeniable. First he’d started replacing some of his clothes and having others let out, trying not to blush as he felt the cold measuring tape at the tailors press in against his soft flesh the first time. Worse was the second time he'd gone back and had to fight his hardest not to get hard as the tailor asked him if he should leave some room to fill out (he primly, and with as much levity as he could muster, agreed that it was a prudent suggestion).
Draco nodded.
with his life. Life in Paris was easier than in England if only because even if people knew him they had more distance and less context. And now as his whole body had ballooned out, there wasn’t anyone from his old life who would even recognize him. With the weight had come an unintentional but much appreciated disguise.
He didn’t mind them as much as he thought he would; like with getting fat itself, he acclimated to it. Plenty of men in the scene had the tell tale marks of gaining weight so quickly that their skin couldn’t keep up with it and they were quite beautiful the more time he gave himself to admire them.
Stuffed like this, he had the drawstring of his soft, linen pajama open and the hem pulled down underneath the impossibly bent out curve of his belly. He knew it only emphasized how full he was but some part of him felt like he deserved it; the tightness was excruciating. He could feel his stomach straining to the absolute maximum. The weight was starting to pad not just his growing
He held his hand over the curve, and tried to take a deep breath, but paused as he was filled with the horrifying feeling of his stomach rounding out underneath his palm, looking even larger.
There’s a part of him that wanted to answer her question with a blunt, “because it gets me off” but he needed to try and win her friendship or possibly face a listless, fat oblivion alone. Besides, while it did get him off in the moment of it, most of the time it filled him with guilt and terror and maybe,
He smirked and breathed in slow, basking in the filling sensation it gave him and imagining instead of air a heavy, indulgent meal in it’s place.
and a language he understood fluidly even in French. But it was also quick and required attention and left little room for him to think of much else. Like how consumingly alone he’d be if he couldn’t keep up with them.
“It didn’t work out. Seems like it should have been the easier thing, figuring out how to love someone without driving them mad after every thing we’ve been through, but,” he waved out a hand dismissively. He looked back at Draco, frowning. “I er—you’re parents. I’m sorry about what happened. I honestly didn’t think they’d be so harsh on your mother.”
As he pulled away his hand to let himself free of the vague terror of going pear-shaped he was grateful for perhaps the first time that really, he saw
By the time Blaise returned, he had managed to recollect himself somewhat; enough to be annoyed that his friend hadn’t told him what would be the appropriate attire for the occasion.
Despite being so painfully full, he tried to lean himself upwards to get to the dessert portion of the meal he’d ordered. It took more than one try, but he was able to rock himself up and gingerly forwards to reach across the table for the dessert container. He’d ordered extra dessert; the entrée portion of this meal was only an excuse to order two of the most rich, melt-in-your-mouth brownies he’d found in the city. He laid back, resting the little cardboard container on the crest of his burgeoning gut and slowly extracted one of the brownies. He was already salivating before it even got to his mouth, smelling rich and even buttery. As he placed it into his mouth, the way it melted was exquisite, the taste of raspberry and chocolate exploding in his mouth. At least, he supposed, his belly was the results of a well-groomed and epicurean tastes; very little wasteful flavour passed his lips. As the buttery taste of the treat melted in his mouth he imagined it melting into fat in his body and tried to imagine where the next pounds would find themselves on his formerly sleek frame. Would it be his belly? Most of it seemed to go there, but he knew that his thighs were thickening up, the seams of all his trousers leaving a streak of indentations at the end of every day when he pulled them off. Even these loose pajamas that he was wearing was starting to strain across the seat, stitches creaking in protest each time that he bent over or sat down. Yes, his arse was likely at least as big as that woman’s had been by now and if it wasn’t, he was well on his way.
After their chance meeting in the gym, things took a considerable turn for the better. He went out, for one thing. Whatever it had been that had compelled Blaise to invite him out in the first place, be it out of sympathy or genuine friendliness, quickly became an easy friendship. His friends were fun and liked to dance and their catty humour was easy to fall into. Maybe a little too easy and maybe he hadn’t realized just how often he offered more judgment than authenticate expressions of himself and his feelings. Blaise’s friends were less neutral than he was and yes, perhaps their sense of humour was more mean than clever but it was
Harry laughed nervously as though he weren’t quite sure that he should laugh at how openly Draco brought up his weight. Draco moved on, genuinely curious about how this boy he’d grown up hating his entire teenage life was now seated in front of his mostly bare, bulky and carefully stuffed belly. It didn’t seem real. Surely he was in some strange dream? Not that he’d ever fantasized about that the way he sometimes had the impression that Potter had about him. Potter’s shyness indicated to him that he hadn’t ever really let himself think of it though, uncertain as he was being in this dark, loud space filled with beefy men and proud, gargantuan domes of bloated hairy guts and thick, fat asses.
Draco waved a hand dismissively.
He stepped off the scale and watched the dial bounce back rapidly. He didn’t feel any heavier was perhaps the peculiar thing. If I hadn’t of been for his trousers getting tighter, he wouldn’t have noticed at all. But now, with the pinched feeling of his trousers confirmed by the scale as yes, very much indeed being due to an extra ten kilos, he was forced to take a closer look at the rest of his body.
Blaise didn’t apologize.
At that, Draco thought he must have blanked out for a good minute; was Potter…
“You’re a bit under...or rather, over-dressed,” the man said, voice low and gravelly in a way that was making the synapses in Draco’s head fire a little too quickly. “Wish I could get a better idea of what you’re looking like underneath all that.”
It was the strangest thing, to feel that wave of sympathy for Potter as he spoke. Draco had gone on a ridiculous and circumvent route to figuring himself out in a way that left him nearly outrageously Rubenesque beyond recognition but here was Potter, who he’d thought had won everything sounding venomous and
But he thought maybe Blaise had some idea when he took him, pointedly him and not Adrienne, to a leather bar. At some point, Draco had gotten quite used to often being the largest person in the room, but here, no, he would venture as far to say that his well-fed, well-rounded belly was actually quite modest. Granted, this was in part to how much of his weight naturally spilled out down into his lower half, but still. To be confronted with large, hard, furred bellies of men even beyond his wildest aspirations for himself left him dumbstruck. He wanted nothing more than to reach out and stroke these magnificent testimonies to indulgence and worship them as he worshipped his own doughy form.
“I didn’t do it as an apology,” Draco hissed, squirming in his seat. Adrienne had finally convinced him to come out. He thought about continuing to refuse but from the group that he’d cut himself off of so abruptly, she was the last one who kept pushing to make contact with him. So, finally in a moment of weakness nursed on the debilitating loneliness he'd carefully curated his life into, he scribbled a message back to her and practically hurled the owl out the window with it.
large. He wasn’t especially tall, but he was close enough to six feet that the weight, especially once he’d started adding some muscle to his upper body looked quite evened out. He’d never achieve the hard, beer gut look he enjoyed so much in other men, but he was undeniably soft. And yet, had no impulse to stop just yet. He had it in his head that he’d make the three hundred mark and then let himself naturally fall back from there. Maybe that wasn’t how it’d play out, but even as he thought that he didn’t look all that large, that he was beginning to
He couldn’t quite pin the moment where he’d started to feel more at ease with himself. Of course he still had moments of embarrassment like when he realized just how precariously he was perched on a stool, or how sometimes if he ate enough he started to reflexively spread his legs out to make more room for his belly to sag more comfortably in between. For Paris especially, he was quite
There was tittering of laughter, and he’d have thought nothing of it if Blaise hadn’t chosen then to look up from his book.
Curious as to if he had managed to pack on a little more weight, he pulled out the scale and realized that he hadn’t actually done that in quite a long time. His chief concerns when it came to his size was making sure he had accurate measurements to give to the tailor so that he wouldn’t be disappointed when a new outfit was finished.
Draco jerked his head towards Blaise to confirm the outrageous forwardness of what he’d just heard, but his friend had already wandered off. He knew that his cheeks must have tinged pink, but he turned back to the man and in a wild display of egotism that he hadn’t indulged in for some time, he spread open his thighs, letting his belly sink down in-between them, jutting it outwards pointedly.
Which, was maybe when going out for the night in matching crop tops that Adrienne had made as a joke it hadn’t even crossed his mind to protest. He pawed at his soft stomach as it bulged out over his trousers; they were new and quite expensive and on their own looked good as hell while being quite forgiving on flexibility. He just hadn’t expected to wear it with such a short shirt.
“Yes, strange, no?” Gaspard said. “He looks like perhaps he didn’t mean to be here.”
But then, maybe he’d let himself overshoot the three hundred. Just to see, just once. He stroked the large, sagging curve of his belly thoughtfully as he waited for his drink to come up at the bar. He recognized plenty of people who'd also come from Paris, but they’d all seemed to fall into a understanding that they could see one another any time; they were here for fresh meat.
He was at a size now that he didn’t worry about being recognized. His chin was always doubled now, even without looking down. He was so perfectly rotund that there was no way to imagine him as having ever been thin. Underneath his very sensible trousers he knew that his thighs dimpled and that even with Adrienne’s various salves and lotions that he’d gotten so big that he’d miss the striping stretchmarks sometimes simply for being unable to work his body around in such a way to really notice them. When he lifted the folding over crease of his belly, he knew that there were a few underneath that he’d been negligent of.
As his belly bounced out in front of him, he realized that he was nearly double his weight from when he’d last been here. It hadn’t been that long, not really; nearly two and a half years since he’d been to London. As no one recognized him it made him feel more and more like a stranger to this place. And it didn't bother him. There was little here for him and he wondered if perhaps he should simply sell the London property. It didn’t seem worth keeping if he was only here every few years. A hotel would do just fine; a hotel with good room service.
There was something soothing about the extra mass of his body, now that he had a chance to catch up to it instead of endlessly stuffing it before he could even understand and accommodate for the changes. With Adrienne and Blaise it was easy to let himself still eat heartily and to indulge without feeling like it would “cost” him. The more time he spent with the weight, the easier it was to settle into. Blaise, the last person on the planet that he’d have thought who’d have so little to comment on the topic of weight gain was a godsend. Draco’s hopes of romance were dashed when Blaise brought his boyfriend from the countryside into the city for the holidays but in some ways, it was almost easier to be around him once it was clear they wouldn’t be anything more than friends.
“Er—no, I did not. And to be fair I wasn’t expecting to see you. Ever, really,” Potter hedged carefully. He looked around his shoulder, perhaps checking for the Daily Prophet and whatever other rag would surely love the scoop on Harry Potter at a leather bar. Draco wondered if he’d even fit in the frame of whatever picture they managed to snap, never mind be recognized within it.
“I—” Draco choked on his reply.
Potter gave a slight shake of his head.
attractive. Taking that and looking at his own body he could shift his thinking from “it’s not that bad” to “this outfit kind of makes me look hot?”.
He swallowed. So why had he gained so much weight?
, pass over his bulging side and giving a playful squeeze.
“What? Just like that?”
at flirting? In a way and with a confidence that suggested that perhaps…he might know just what to do with him in bed?
“Let’s go,” he suggested, hand tracing tentatively along Potter’s lean side. There was really no meat on him and Draco wondered if Potter would become the
It was rare, but Draco felt the bubbling feeling of anticipation well up in him at the prospect of spending the night with someone who would potentially give his gravid form the attention and reverence that it was due. Maybe if it wouldn’t have required screaming at the top of his lungs, he would have given some flirtation back, challenged Potter to fill him up to be as big as the largest man he’d ever slept with; to encourage to gorge himself even bigger. But he couldn’t believe that this was happening and didn’t want to risk breaking the spell. Tenderly, he leaned closer, letting his wide belly press up against Potter’s flat, lean torso and fill around him.
“I quit a few months ago; I couldn’t take it. It was too much after…everything. Couldn’t keep it together. People do nasty things to one another even when there isn’t a war,” he explained, mouth close to Draco’s ear to try and speak over the noise.
“You didn’t recognize me, did you?”
His body, as it swelled with fat, of course did actually start to feel cumbersome and heavy. Stacking on another twenty kilos felt like it had put him off-balance and as much as he did like how it’d more permanently rounded out his middle, it was taking getting some used to. Usually he loved the weight, but after smacking it in frustration one day, Blaise had suggested that he start lifting weights to help with feeling like he had some modicum of control over his body again beyond constantly permitting it to stick further and further out in front of him.
“Ah, I missed the calendar. But I figured since I’m here already…” he said, finishing with a shrug. He wasn’t really looking at Draco, so of course he wouldn’t recognize him. But he didn’t recognize his voice either, despite likely hating it so much from their time at school before. Draco scoffed, giving a little hop so that he could more comfortably adjust himself on the small seat. This couldn’t be the reason for choosing this particular club for the event, he thought, annoyed as he adjusted himself. He waved down the bartender for another round for the each of them. Potter hadn’t realized what he’d done until the next drink was sat down in front him. Draco raised his.
, but begin to thicken his thighs and plump his ass up probably larger than the poor women he’d so scathingly commented on in the first place. This was his punishment, he thought, fingers lightly grazing down the front of the massive bulge as though hardly believing that it could be real. This is what he’d earned with his vapid, unkind way of being. He’d been too shallow and desperate to fit in than to develop some kind of sense of his own personhood. He didn’t think that getting fat would suddenly manifest a personality within him, but the surrender to careless decadence was at least enough to distract him from thinking of how he'd gotten here, pudgy and softening more each day. He didn't have to think so much about how he’d managed to so quickly drive off the only chance he might have to make friends.
Draco realized, another knot coming undone.
“You know I’ve had sex,” he muttered, admiring how the man’s body moved as it approached. He hadn't had a lot of sex, he’d admit, but even at
The flesh of his generous potbelly was soft and malleable in his hands. Lifting the heft of it in his hands, he let it drop down, biting his lip tightly as he watched it wobble before settling back into the wide, heavy look it had eased into. He hadn’t gained any weight in ages, but he hadn’t lost any either. Despite how much time he spent out with Blaise and Adrienne either walking or dancing it never seemed to shift. He turned to his side and smoothed both hands over the sagging swell of it. Most of the weight had sunk to the lower part of his belly, making a large, soft zone that he often found himself kneading at as a gesture of comfort.
Potter looked at a loss again. The more he faltered, the more Draco realized that for all the time he’d spent being repulsed by every detail he thought the knew about him as they were growing up, he didn’t know Potter at all. Maybe he was feeling the same thing.
Maybe it was in having to look more closely to try and figure out if there was a reason he’d know this enormous, bloated looking man in front of him made it enough so that Potter could recognize him. Draco watched with a thrill, smirking as he watched Potter’s reaction flash over his face, the blush when he’d looked while trying so hard not to look at the thick mass of belly rested on Draco’s lap.
“Not for long. After the Wizengamot sentenced my parents I needed a change of scenery.”
“You should come out with my friends and I some time. We’ll show you the city.”
Potter was thin as ever, a tall streak of long, angular limbs. Finally getting a view of his middle, Draco confirmed that it wasn’t rounded out in even the slightest of bulges that could begin to explain what he was doing here tonight. Of course, there were skinny men who came to these events, but it wasn’t the majority. And Potter was wearing formfitting white shirt with tight pants; fare you’d expect for an average night at a gay bar, but not the wardrobe one would aspire to for this event. It’d been nearly a year since Blaise took him to his first leather bar in Paris and Draco felt a fond wave of nostalgia. He made his approach.
“I can fix this,” he resolved. There wasn’t a lot to which he had control over in his life anymore, but at getting fat was something he could probably manage to avoid.
It was only about four and a half kilos bringing him up to 104.5, and he chuckled to himself thinking of a time where “only about four and half kilos” would have been an utterly mortifying reality to face. Not dwelling on it too much, he stepped off the scale and went to look in the mirror.
Draco couldn’t help but burst out laughing. The look on Potter’s face was positively dumbfounded as though he were trying to imagine how this could have happened to his former rival. Draco reached down to his heavy gut and gave it a generous shake.
His weight did plateau after another ten kilos as Adrienne came back into his life. He didn’t met up with any of the others from Blaise’s group of friends, save for Blaise himself and with the two of them, his life eased into something he actually enjoyed living.
“Look, I don’t care if you’re thin or fat, I just wanted to see if you were okay. You’re fun, Draco, and I figured there had to be a little more to you than mean jokes. Now that you’ve finally told me the truth about something…want to go shopping?”
When he got to the second brownie, he was rubbing his stomach and trying to knead out the pressure in the tighter spots. He had to pause, feeling a small belch bubble up and pass his lips before he could manage to get the next bite in. The sound sent a tingling feeling up his spine, the indiscreet thrill of overindulgence making his skin go hot and his dick hard.
When he saw Potter’s shoulders cave in, Draco really, really wished he’d bothered to keep up with the Prophet because surely it would have had some clue of what Potter’s employment status was and he’d have known better than to ask.
Adrienne shook her head and waved a hand dismissively.
With both hands he reached up and cupped his budding tits; well, that was actually a overly gracious assessment. They were nothing like tits, but he imagined what it would be like if they were, how much weight he’d have to gain to see them round out into pert little breasts given that most of his weight pooled down around his belly and hips. Experimentally, he rounded his thumbs over his nipples, watching as the skin puckered and went hard.
“Interesting.” Draco tried not to laugh.
"This was fun. You should come to Gryffindor night more often, Draco." Ron slapped Draco’s shoulder, causing him to stumble slightly.
“Keep the questions relevant to Narcissa’s case.” Kingsley interjected.
The wedding tent was set up in the quidditch field and Harry knew he would find Draco in there. He ran from the garden, suddenly desperate to see him. He couldn’t explain why, he just knew Draco needed him.
"Alright." Harry said with more confidence than he felt. "Why not?"
Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, his face full of skepticism.
“Oi, stop that!” Ron begged her “I’m sick enough as it is…”
The last thing he needed was his bloody godfather interfering. If he didn’t accomplish the task he had been assigned more than just his own life was at stake. He felt Theo wrap his arms around him protectively and Draco’s heartstrings twinged with unease.
“Oh. I used a charm for that, I didn't fold it. I can’t believe you remember that. I had completely forgotten about it.” Draco laughed.
It was bizarre. Harry had no idea the Room of Requirement could create secret tunnels. If he had known that he wouldn’t have needed to use the one with the one-eyed witch statue to sneak into Honeydukes. He supposed he really shouldn’t be shocked at this point, it was truly a miraculous room.
Harry had never seen a tea set like this before. Without any type of logic guiding him, he knew he had to get it for Draco. He couldn’t explain why, he just knew. When Hermione found him he was just pulling a box from the shelf beneath the display.
He was painfully reminded of Fred and George hugging him in a similar fashion when he was having one of his breakdowns and he couldn’t help the sob that escaped from his chest. Pansy and Hermione only held him tighter.
“Let's start with Black dying. No, scratch that, let's start with Diggory. If I know you as well as I think I do, you never properly processed his death either.” Pansy said flippantly, matching his tone.
“Oh, Draco!” Pansy rushed forward, leaving Granger to greet his parents as she enveloped him in a hug. “I’m so glad you’re back.”
“Yes, that’s why it’s called fast food.” Harry chuckled. “Go grab us a booth and I’ll bring the food over when it’s ready.”
“Fair enough, I suppose.” Dean said with a bemused expression.
"His scathing remark about my father seemed pretty final." Draco said bitterly.
“Maybe you should take the locket off.” Hermione held her hand out. “I can wear it for a while.”
“Not by choice.” Harry said bitterly.
“Not you too.” Draco pouted.
There were so few reasons to smile lately that Draco found himself becoming grateful for each and every one. Pansy’s unfaltering optimism despite all logic would always be one he was grateful for the most.
“They’re filled with a gas called helium. It makes balloons float and changes your voice if you breathe it in.” Harry smirked at the look of wonder on Draco’s face.
Alright, you awesome nerds, it's been a HOT minute since my last update so instead of one chapter, I'm giving you two. The trials were hard for me to write and I'm really glad they're over. They are a labor of love, however, and I am proud to present them! The angst and pining are going to get a whole lot worse before they get better, but it will get better. I promise.
“It’s decided then. One way or another, you’re getting that memory today.” Hermione said briskly to disguise the concern in her voice.
Ari shook his head and turned towards the till, intending to count the drawer down. It was close enough to closing time. He was in the middle of counting his sickles when the bell announced the arrival of a patron.
He’s not dead.
“Er, thanks.” Harry sounded perplexed.
“What do you mean you saw it happen?” her face darkened.
His friends may have encouraged him, but he had found himself reaching for any reason to contact Draco since he realized he was in love with him. Those silver eyes had been haunting him for weeks now.
“As touching as this display is, you need to go.” Severus drawled, yanking Draco away from his parents and shoving him towards the tunnel.
Their target was trying to circumvent the barrier spell Zach had erected on the rubble that had once been the entrance. Harry snorted in laughter. Zach's specialty was barrier spells. There was no hope of the perp deconstructing it.
“I don’t know how to describe him, really. He’s…” Draco struggled to find words. “Bold. He’s resilient and passionate and clever. He has this chivalrous streak that makes him do recklessly brave things, he stands up for people-I don’t think I’ve met anyone quite as compassionate or as kind. He’s so noble, and just so...real. He's funny and he’s honest. He’s an excellent dancer yet he’s so humble. He’s… pretty incredible.”
“You got burned by fiendfyre.” Draco panted.
“I suppose.” Draco heaved a deep sigh before pushing back from the table.
“I don’t want to cause a scene.” Harry blushed.
Harry bloody freaking Potter.
"You were taken off the family tree, but no one is ever removed from the records." Draco gave her a pained smile. "Purebloods are meticulous like that."
Draco liked him.
“That would do it.” Blaise nodded sagely as he crawled up onto his bed.
“I suppose I will just have to see it for myself then.” He hummed agreeably. Honestly, at this point, Harry could take him to watch paint dry and he would be satisfied just to be spending time with him.
He had fallen off his bunk.
"Shite, I didn't mean-"
“To support Fleur, of course.” Draco blinked. Hadn’t they gone over that this morning?
“I will never be sick of you.” He promised, cupping his jaw with one hand before planting a quick kiss on his full lips.
“I just...that’s what I wanted to say. Last week, when you asked me. I just didn’t know how to say it.” He said weakly.
“I think Ron is right, Harry! Oh, why didn’t I think of it? You should take some of your Felix Felicis. Maybe all you need really is a bit of luck!” She crowed.
Hot blood gushed down the back of Harry’s throat and trickled into his mouth as he lay frozen on the floor.
“My parents never wanted to mingle with the muggles.” Draco said quietly.
“Got it. A mouthful should be plenty, yeah? I don’t need the whole twenty-four hours.” Harry was peering at the small vial of golden potion curiously.
“That is utter bullshite.” Draco was outraged and Ari was slightly comforted by his friend’s righteous anger. “I can understand waiting till marriage to avoid vengeful exes from exposing them after a breakup. That much makes sense, but being forced to hide half of who they are from their partner unless they produce a magical child together? That is barbaric!”
“Oh, is that what it’s called?” Draco turned back to watch them again. “Yes, I would like to try playing.”
“Listen, there is mead over by the Weasley’s and Pansy has laid out an exorbitant amount of snacks over there. Help yourself!” He pointed back towards the tables. Harry had melted into the shadows and Draco frowned at that.
“No.” He said flatly.
The combination of the beer and the liquid Devil’s Snare had Harry’s head floating rather quickly. It felt like running on air, which was a rather pleasant sensation. When the others were close to finishing their beers Harry decided it was time to buy the next round. He chose a crowd favorite that was guaranteed to get them all pissed. He had to borrow a tray from the bar to bring five Irish Slammers over to their little corner, but it was worth it when Seamus and Ron cheered and Neville and Dean complained loudly when they caught sight of what Harry had picked.
“Come on, Linda. Let’s just go.” the man who was with her tugged on her hand, trying to pull her out of line.
His eyes were drawn to Draco’s and he huffed appreciatively. It ignited a prideful fire in his stomach and he couldn’t help the coy smile that played at his lips.
“I don’t have to tell you!” Harry snarled, anger bubbling over and consuming every other emotion in his body. How dare she?
“Your place or mine?” Harry smirked wickedly.
“Yeah?” He looked up into Draco’s misty eyes.
Draco has a lovely chat over tea with his mother, Harry sees his first real beach and builds his first sandcastle, and a blast from the past changes everything.
"She's not even a Death Eater. Why do we have to bow down to some ministry bitch?" Theo's bottom lip jutted out as he slipped into full sulk mode.
Draco can't seem to come to grips with being a Death Eater. Just when he thinks things might calm down now that Dumbledore is dead something happens that triggers an unhealthy response in him that will change Theo's life forever.
“Master Sirius had already abandoned him. He only had Kreacher to confide in. Kreacher helped him as best he could, but there is no magic that can heal a hurting soul. Kreacher was powerless to make him feel better.” The elf was crying again and Draco felt bad for him.
"Boyfriend?" Seamus choked on his beer.
“You had no right to interfere! I was handling it!” Harry cut him off.
It wasn’t even his arm. His entire soul ached. His very being was rubbed raw. He couldn’t feel anything that wasn’t pain. He was shaking when Theo walked in. He stopped in his tracks, took one look at Draco, and was at his side in an instant.
The family room was empty when he arrived and he looked around the vacant room with a hollow feeling in his chest. This was where he had taken the mark. Draco’s eyes fixated on the floor in front of the window and he fancied that he could see the ghost of his sixteen-year-old self crying as his flesh was carved into and burnt off. His mark flared at the remembered pain and he rubbed at it through the sleeve of his shirt almost absentmindedly.
“That’s an invasion of privacy. They can’t control how much they divulge. It’s unethical!” Harry hissed.
“Agreed.” Draco smirked.
“It went really well, actually.” He looked surprised that his day had been good. “Arimere offered me a job and wants to put my painting on display.”
"I see." He said thoughtfully, twirling them around the dancefloor effortlessly. "It's sort of the same with Pansy. She's my best mate, but if someone else had asked her before I did I have no doubt she would have said yes."
“Those again?” He tried to hide how pleased he was as he set the tray on the coffee table and sank onto the couch next to him.
“They’re my...” Draco struggled with the word but finally managed to spit it out. “friends. The Weasel isn’t all that bad and the Weaselette is actually quite funny. You should talk to them.” He patted her on the shoulder and moved towards the others that were coming in behind them.
Harry elected to ignore that last jab and pushed through to the doors with the air of someone tackling an unpleasant task. He set his sights on the Gryffindor table and walked purposefully towards it. He noticed a flash of red and looked to see Ron and Hermione waving him over. He angled in their direction, counting breaths in his head.
“There, there dear. This too shall pass.” She said softly. “Why don’t you go into the den, hmm? I know the rest of the family is dying to see you.”
“I think that sounds like a fantastic idea.” Granger mirrored her and they shared a smile.
“And,” Fred flashed him a wicked grin “your favorite album.”
“I knew I should have insisted Draco was my partner.” Neville pouted.
Draco’s silver eyes met hers for an instant before they were both running towards each other. The Dark Lord bellowed in fury at the loss of his most trusted, blasting his three opponents back into the crowd. He rounded on Draco and his mother, who were embracing.
“We didn’t mind. It was easier to listen to you than trying to figure stuff out on our own.” Vince shrugged. “We like orders.”
Draco held his breath when Harry almost touched his skin. He could feel the heat radiating off his fingers and shivered at the barely-there touch.
I'm sorry this chapter took so long to upload. The holidays are surprisingly time-consuming. If you're stuck with me this far, thank you! If you're new, welcome! As always a shout out to my darling AlexClio for beta reading the shit out of this fic, and to SandZhark who has been trying to beta this fic but ran into technical difficulties for this chapter. I hope you enjoy it!
“Please. I had much better things to do with my time than take note that you favored the steak and kidney pie or gorged yourself on treacle tart, or stopped eating when you were nervous about something.” Draco sniffed.
Harry looked anywhere but at the pair of them. He didn’t want to get dragged into the middle. His eyes landed on Malfoy dancing with another boy in their year. He wasn’t sure but Harry thought his name was Nott. Wasn’t that strange? Boys dancing with boys? None of the dancers around them seemed to think so. It looked oddly poetic.
“You mean you’re not going to fight? You’re going to leave us in this mess?” Michael Corner demanded.
Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived after it. With the unerring skill of a seeker, he caught the diadem around his wrist, saving it from the maws of a flaming chimera. Harry swerved again as the chimera lunged for them, soaring upwards and straight towards where the door should be. The Weasel and the others were already gone. A patch of light became visible through the smoke and Harry angled them towards it. Moments later clean air filled his lungs just before they crashed into the opposite wall. Draco let himself fall off the broom, coughing up soot. Ganger and the Weasel sat panting on the floor beside Greg who was still unconscious. Draco crawled over to him, rolling him over to check his wounds. He gagged at the sight.
“Thank you.” He whispered into his shoulder. “Maybe it’s time I find a nice wizard to settle down with, yeah?”
Draco blinked and then read the note again, sure he must have hallucinated the signature. He looked at the pot, then back at the note in shock. That Harry had gotten him a gift at all was surprising enough, but the fact that he had obviously put thought into it and even poured his own magic into it was incredible. He walked back over to the table and picked up one of the cups. The inside of it had the Sirius constellation with its surrounding stars in it. Draco couldn’t help the grin that curled his lips when he picked up the next cup and saw his own constellation twinkling back at him. The other two cups held the Andromeda and Regulus constellations and Draco was touched at how meaningful the entire gift was. Amongst the endless reminders that he was a Malfoy, here was a lovely reminder that he was also a Black.
He slipped from the room and ran up the stairs, desperate to escape.  When he reached the top he blinked in momentary confusion. There were strobe lights flashing and loud music was vibrating the floor and walls around him. Then he remembered that the upstairs was the designated dance floor. A flash of blonde caught his attention and he almost had a heart attack until he realized it was Luna. She was dancing with Ginny in the most outlandish way possible and Harry couldn’t help but smile.
“That’s not what I-”
Draco stiffened at his words and Ron frowned.
"Erm, technically only two." Harry flushed.
"Erm, I suppose so? Pissed the Weasley's right off, didn't it?" He tried to play it down.
“You were?” Draco’s hand left a trail of heat on his skin that made Harry crave more.
“You will listen to me, Theodore Nott, and you will listen well. Sod Potter. It doesn’t matter if he’s a damn Veela, Draco is never going to be with him. We’re on opposing sides of a war. So what if he still burns a small flame for the prat? He’s dating you." Why was everything so much more complicated this year? Theo didn't respond, choosing to stare out at the lake in silence instead.
“Since Friday night, I guess.” Draco was blushing furiously.
Sodding Slytherin.
“I suppose that’s fair.” Harry’s shoulders sagged in relief. “Let’s make it a point to not go almost an entire month without hanging out again, yeah? Seeing you in passing just isn’t the same...”
“Oh, he was innocent. He never betrayed my parents or killed those muggles. It was all Wormtail.”
“You’re my back up.” Harry said hopefully. When Bill didn’t look impressed he tried again. “Draco is our backup?”
“Positive.” Zach rolled their eyes. “Now get out of here! We’ve already stayed later than usual because of the bust. I can finish up the paperwork. You have a date to get to!”
WARNING: Sexually explicit content is included at the end of this chapter. If you wish to skip the smut, stop reading after they leave the pub.
“Oi! You can stop right there!” Ron sounded panicked. When Harry glanced over at him he looked like he might faint.
Was this it? Was this the afterlife?
“Come, Draco. We’re returning to Hogwarts.” His father said stiffly.
Desire burned through him and he shoved against Malfoy, flipping their positions before trailing messy kisses down the side of Malfoy's neck while his hands worked at Malfoy's trousers.
“Can you take a message to Draco Malfoy for me and wait for his reply?” He stroked Wodin’s feathers gently and the owl stared at him with wide, yellow eyes. After a moment he trilled and held out his leg for the letter so Harry took that as an affirmative. “Thank you. I’ll have a treat for you when you get back.”
It was impossible. It was supposed to be over.
“Here, you’re doing it wrong.” Harry muttered, batting Malfoy’s hands out of the way before taking the silky fabric into his own.
“We need to talk.”
Anger.
Rage.
Not a dream then.
“I couldn’t just stand there and watch you get tortured.” Draco sighed. “I did so little in comparison to what I should have done.”
“You dreamt this?”
"Oi, over here." A staged whisper caught his attention and he followed the sound. She was hiding in an alcove beneath the marble staircase.
Sunlight filtered through intricate stained glass windows as Harry watched his favorite Slytherin flit excitedly from the Tomb of the Black Prince to the effigy of King Henry IV and Joan of Navarre. He was like a kid in a candy shop, drinking in the rich history of the Canterbury Cathedral and hanging on Harry’s every word. They had been exploring the hallowed halls of the Cathedral all morning and Draco’s enthusiasm was still unbridled. Harry was glad that he had thought to do some research before bringing Draco here. He wouldn’t have known half of the answers to Draco’s endless questions otherwise.
“The Manor would make the most sense.” Hermione hummed as the owl hopped away from her and settled next to Draco, looking at him expectantly.
Draco saw Pansy trying to catch Theo’s eye and he looked at her quizzically. He felt rather than saw when Theo made eye contact. Pansy gave him a meaningful look and arched an eyebrow as Theo nodded curtly.
"What do you say, Ted? Are you ready to go to the zoo?" Harry bounced him on his hip and Teddy squealed in delight.
“Well, at least Dean isn’t mopping the floor with us anymore.” Harry offered as he took a sip of whatever drink Neville had bought for him. “This is good Nev, what is it?”
“He’s t-terrible at p-potions.” Draco stammered. “He becomes v-violent when you insult his dead p-parents and he has a s-soft spot for Hippogriffs.”
“Ze curse caught Mad-eye off guard and ‘ee… ‘ee fell backward off ‘is broom. Zer was no-zing we could do-” Fleur tried to be strong for her intended, but she broke down too.
“From one tower to another.” Harry smirked, shrugging nonchalantly.
"I did." He gave Draco a self-satisfied grin.
“It was Draco.” She said simply. “When I realized that there was even the smallest chance to save my son, every fiber of my being fought to do just that.”
“How many fifth years do you know that were friendly with first years?” Ari nudged him with his elbow.
“What happened to him? Even the Dark Lord never knew.”
“Oh Harry, welcome home!” Molly yanked him into a bone-crushing hug, planting a kiss on his temple.
“We thought you knew what you were doing!” Ron stood up angrily, enunciating his hurtful words with wild gestures. “We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!”
“Miss us much?” George’s deep voice sounded in his ear, causing heat to spread from where his hot breath had tickled his neck.
“He isn’t my pet, he’s my boyfriend- and I didn’t stop him for your sake. You don’t get to just show up and turn the life I’ve made here upside down! I moved out to get away from you and your toxic household. I want nothing to do with you people. I’m happy here, I found people who actually like me and who accept me for who I am. Go back to Surrey to live your perfectly normal lives in your perfectly normal house with your perfectly normal son and just stay there!” Harry released Draco’s wrist and stalked up to his Uncle furiously.
It had taken him six months to grow comfortable with Healer Grey. Now he had to start again with someone new? He was more than a little miffed about wasting an entire session, but he supposed it couldn’t be helped. McGonagall would skin him alive if he skipped out on his mandatory mind healing. The young healer knocked on a handsome mahogany door to their left.
“Alrigh’, e’ryone here?” Hagrid looked around after setting the crates down.
He couldn’t. He didn’t want to be here. He didn’t want to be hugged or comforted. He just wanted to stop existing. Hermione and Pansy needed to feel like they were helping him so he allowed them to whisper empty reassurances for their sake. They didn’t need to suffer alongside him. He let himself weep until he couldn’t anymore.
“Theo?” He croaked, then cleared his throat.
“Great?” Harry tried again. Draco didn’t seem impressed. “No, wait. You look fantastic.”
“It’s a party, sweetheart, do try to enjoy it.” His mother’s voice floated through the door, announcing her arrival.
I'm excited about our date tonight. I think you're going to love what I have planned. I'll be there to pick you up around six forty-five. Unfortunately, I got off work a little late so we won't have time for a nice dinner beforehand. I suggest eating something small to tide you over till we can get something afterward. Can't wait to see you!
“It wasn’t your fault.” Bill shrugged.
Despite his annoyance, he had to admit it was a good plan. Traditionally if someone cut in on a dance, the abandoned partners would join together for the remainder of that dance. Who could blame a pureblood for sticking with tradition?
He threw them off of him and pulled his wand, pointing it at the two who had captured him.
“Before we go anywhere I need a shower and some clean clothes.” Draco sighed, looking disdainfully at his wrinkled trousers.
Draco did his best not to watch the entrance as Blaise propped his ankle on his shoulder, using their height difference to his advantage. He was filling Pansy in on all of the drama that she had missed yesterday while they limbered up for rehearsal.
Bill was silent for a long while, staring at Harry with a calculating gaze. The silence grew rather uncomfortable until Bill sat up straight, drained the last of his mead, and gave Harry a stern look.
“I’m fine.” Harry grit his teeth. “I just need some sleep.”
“Enough, Miss Parkinson.” Severus cut her off. “How do you feel?”
"How is it that you're a Hippogriff in an Apothecary on the ground, but you can manage to keep your feet on ice?" Draco countered, arching an eyebrow at him.
Harry had never been more pleased to see her in all his life. Here was an Order member who would take him seriously.
“Not really, no.” He blushed. “They, er, didn’t want to upset the family so we just sort of kept it to ourselves and didn’t really go out in public.”
“Your three o’clock is here, sir!” She called through the closed door.
“Thank you. What is this called? I like it.”
Everything was deserted- the garden, the field, the tent. There wasn’t a soul in sight. The more he wanted to reach the wedding tent the farther away it became until he struggled to cover the miles between him and his destination. Harry was forced to slow down when the tent vanished and the tall grass grew over him, taller than the Triwizard maze. He wandered around aimlessly for a while, getting more and more frantic as time passed because he still hadn’t found Draco.
Not fifty feet away his Aunt Bella was also dueling three opponents at once. Draco was impressed by the nerve of Granger and Lovegood. They were putting up quite a fight. He was only mildly surprised to see Pansy as their third partner. She gave as good as she got, flinging hexes at an impressive speed. His aunt let out a delighted shriek and he felt an all too familiar spike of panic. That sound was usually the preamble of a gruesome murder. He shot a stunning spell at her as he ran towards them, but missed by mere centimeters. She sent off a flaming dragon to keep the girls occupied and spun on the spot, her eyes growing wide when she spied him. He stopped moving and raised his wand in a defensive stance. She wouldn’t take him down easily. He could at least buy the others some time to recover.
Draco’s apology was cut short when Andromeda threw her arms around him and pulled him into her chest, ignoring the half-full mug of coffee.
“Alright then. Wands out.” Bill smirked.
He threw Daphne and Theo an apologetic smile as he passed but didn’t stop to chat. Pansy gave him a meaningful glower before he could escape and he rolled his eyes. He would probably have to turn his phone on silent later so Pansy blowing him up didn’t disturb his parents. He slipped his polo back over his head as he walked and was out the front doors in record time. It wasn’t until the Vantage door slammed shut, however, that he could fully breathe again and he let out a shaky laugh.
“And yet you’re wearing it.” Harry laughed. “Well, sort of.” He grabbed one of the loose ends and pulled it off his neck.
“You, Draco, Theo. You all insist on suffering in silence and not letting anyone help you. It’s infuriating.”
“A truly groundbreaking discovery, I know.” Draco rolled his eyes.
“No.”
Harry raked his fingers through his hair, pulling at the roots in frustration. He had gone and fucked that up royally.
“Why wouldn’t I?” Harry pulled gently on his hands trying to get him to look back at him.
The Dark Lord's words were met with silence. No one seemed to want to be the bearer of bad news if Potter wasn’t.
"See you tomorrow, my love."
Draco’s heart fluttered as Harry opened the car door and sank into the passenger seat. Was he ever going to get used to the fact that Harry was his?
And again.
“If the Malfoys have to take that vile potion, then so do I.” He set his jaw stubbornly.
“Brilliant. Make yourself at home and I’ll go make us some tea.” Draco retreated quickly, still shell shocked that Harry was here.
“How can you say that, Ron? Harry is suffering! He needs-”
"Excuse me, terribly sorry to interrupt, but I need to speak to Harry." Luna appeared out of thin air in true Luna fashion.
“This is painful, here let me teach you.” Draco stepped forward and grabbed Harry by the waist. “You’re thinking too much. Stop focusing on your body and listen to the music.”
“I, erm, am actually not seeing anyone at the moment.” Harry did his best to not look at Draco and miserably failed. His expression was stony as he glared into the distance.
-Is everything okay?-Hermione asked, putting her hand on Ron’s shoulder.
-Wow…,-Hermione chuckled,-And you’re not mad?
-We can’t just disobey their orders, honey,-Harry could have sworn he heard Draco scoffing.
-Yeah, of course,-Harry said, still smiling ear to ear,-Why?
-Okay. Good night,-Draco nodded and after another second full of doubts, Harry turned around and went upstairs.
-For what? They’ll choose you anyway.
-What’s that?-Draco asked looking at a portrait, covered with some cloth.
(See the end of the chapter for
-So? Have you already decided on your future profession?-Draco shook his head and asked himself why he even bothered to come there,-No? Well, not a problem. Let’s take a look at your grades,-Headmistress gave Draco a small smile and started studying the material in front of her.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Since when do you even care about clothes, and looking good, and…and impressing someone?-Harry asked.
-What does that mean?
-Are you sure? Enough news for one day,-Ron joked
-She’s spectacular,-Draco answered putting so much pain, rage and childish, fake hatred to his mother into his words. Tears started shining in his eyes again,-Living her best life with her friends in France.
-That’s not true, you know?-he touched him with his shoulder.
Moly and Arthur insisted that no matter what kind of plans any of them have for the holidays, Christmas they will spend together. Just like every year. All older Weasley also promised to be there and it actually felt like a normal Christmas at the Burrow that had already become a tradition. Except it wasn’t a normal Christmas at all.
Just the fact that Harry had spent some time actually talking to Malfoy was enough to shock Ron to his core. Weasley kept asking what they were talking about and why, and how come the conversation ended with them shaking hands, cheering and smiling to each other, instead of turning the entire Three Broomsticks into a war zone. Harry just kept shrugging and making jokes. Something in him, something he wasn't yet ready to address, didn’t let him reveal their conversation to his friends, as innocent as it was. Hermione gave Potter her usual all-knowing, all-understanding glance and didn’t ask a thing. Harry didn’t even know whose reaction concerned him more.
“Yes, but I wasn’t alone”
Harry meanwhile, was very glad it was Ron wearing captain’s mantle, not him. Knowing the stress and the pressure that captaincy brought firsthand, Harry didn’t really miss it. And he did wish he could be there for Ron, comfort and support him. But as soon as Harry finally decided to act on these feelings and make amends with Weasley, he’d inevitably do something to make him change his mind. And that circle didn’t seem to have an ending yet.
platform had never been this crowded before. For the first time in his life Harry got there by himself. Not with Dursleys, in their car listening to endless complains and insults. Not with Weasleys, hoping that floo powder will be enough for everyone. Not surrounded by aurors or members of the Order. Harry woke up a little earlier than usual, grabbed his bag and apparated straight from his apartment at 12 Grimmauld Place to King’s Cross Station. By the time he got there, Ron, Hermione and a couple more familiar faces had already been waiting for him.
-I did tell you that I changed my mind. No one else knows that,-Harry said. Draco opened his mouth to say something and quickly closed it, looking at something behind Harry.
-That’s Astoria Greengrass,-she said, pointing at the girl,-Poor creature had been in love with your date for years.
-Very well. You may sit down,-Draco landed on his chair and looked at his hands. It was over. Everything was over. His life, his dreams and hopes, ambitions and plans. Nothing mattered anymore, he couldn’t control anything. Except for one thing. He won’t let them see him cry.
And they didn’t. Harry constantly caught weird stares at him, frequently was a subject of discussions, some brave students even asked him questions. How was it, looking for the horcruxes? Were you scared? How did you come back? Why did Malfoy’s mother lie for you?
-Hey,-he replied,-Where’s Pansy?
Their new common room looked like a mix of all the old ones. It didn’t have one color or a theme. Some walls were bright yellow, others red or green. The ceiling and the floor were deep blue, there were numerous paintings (one of a very nervous man guarding them outside, whose voice broke once he asked McGonagall for the password) on the walls. Overall the room looked as an attempt to please everyone at the same time, or as Ron called it, Hogwarts in a nutshell.
I wasn't sure if it was appropriate for me to post anything now, when everyone's attention should be directed towards something way more important. This update in no way disrespects POC community.
-Like what?
-What do you mean?
-Just trying to see how hopeless you are,-he said,-I guess I’ve seen enough,-Harry felt a strong desire to grab Draco’s hand and drag him away from this field. From Ron, who obviously blames him for their fight, from all the other teammates who use him as a puppet to let their anger out on. Just take him away and protect him from all this mess. Instead he just looked at him with a silent “are you okay?” in his eyes. Draco seemed to have gotten it and gave him a slight nod. One of the last trainings before the match was over.
-Draco! For heaven’s sake!- Madam Polkinghorne was holding a crying girl and ran towards Draco as soon as she saw him. Analise pushed the girl into his arms, cursing him for being late, but Harry didn’t hear anything except for girl’s cries and only after Draco wrapped his arms around her tiny body, Potter recognized angelic Lucy in her red twisted face.
The game had already been on for almost an hour. The score, that changed for the last time about 20 minutes ago, now was 50 : 20. All players were tired, Ron looked beaten down.
Ron didn’t find any other comforting words and boys waited for Hermione in silence. The clock ticked and with pounding heart Harry looked at the door every time someone walked in and every time that someone wasn’t Draco. Sadness of possibly being stood up over-weighed the relief a thousand times.
-I’ve never…
-Not the shirt, I’m not going to the funeral, am I?-Harry rolled his eyes and went back into the store. He actually did have to find something for himself too, but he’d rather be alone while doing it. Especially if Ron was going to point out “his date” every 5 minutes. Potter had already made it clear that him going to the Ball with Draco was more of a joke, and they were going as friends.
-Technically I’m not late and I had some business to attend to,-Draco replied to him,-Ready?-he asked, looking at Harry now and reaching out his hand. Harry just starred at it for a second, not sure if he was supposed to take it or just follow him.
-Oh, shut up,-Harry knocked Draco’s shoulder with his, still smiling. Draco laughed too.
-Nothing,-he put the plate on the spot next to his and sat down. For a second Draco just stood there in shock.
If this year truly was supposed to be about healing and moving on, Draco had no idea how he was supposed to do that, if people keep reminding him. He heard hateful “Death Eater” from every corner, every evil mouth. Saw people starring at him as if he personally was responsible for every horror wizarding world had to go through. Heard the whispers behind his back, that were nothing compared to loud insults right into his face. Saw people leaving the room when he walked in. Younger students, who were told by their parents to stay away from him, even some of his course-mates. Draco saw a share of sense in this. People needed someone to blame, someone to hate. A particular alive person; it made the pain from all the losses not so sharp. And there he is, an evil Death Eater, on a silver platter.
-Are you leaving?-he asked. Malfoy just froze for a second. He opened his mouth to say something and closed it again,-Are you? Letting her take you away?
-I wasn’t joking.
-What is one thing that makes you happy? One thing you would agree to do for the rest of your life?-she asked. Harry felt like a fool. What was he supposed to say? All I ever did was fighting Voldemort and playing Quidditch. "Sorry I never really had any hobbies"?
-Thank you,-Harry said and saw a short gray-skinned man walking out of the kitchen. It was one of the house-elves and when Draco said they were “old”, it was a compliment. He was…ancient. With a groan he bowed to everyone present and looked up at Madam Polkinghorne with his light gray eyes.
-Yeah, right. Open up!-Draco mumbled the password and the door opened. Slytherin common room was completely empty, not a soul except for them. Harry carefully walked in. He hardly remembered it since the last and only time he had been there, but now he really saw beauty in it. Soft light, dark colors everywhere, many and many bookshelves, a fireplace and…windows! Windows looked at the lake! Harry gasped when a big colorful fish swam past the window.
-Okay, I did hear something from your conversation with your mom,-Draco looked as if he was ready to kill him,-I’m sorry! I just…I did come here to get you outside! Skipped Ron’s tryouts for you,-he mumbled,-What I wanted to say is that I don’t know anything about your mother as a person. But I know one thing. Your mother’s love to you was enough to stop a war. She wants only the best for you. Draco,-he added, and maybe that, or maybe Draco’s shocked eyes starring into his, gave him goosebumps. Harry felt his cheeks warming up.
The match promised to be at least not boring and Harry made sure of that when he saw that day’s commentator. Luna Lovegood, without the usual lion’s head hat, but in not any less interesting outfit took her place next to the microphone. Horace Slughorn was sitting next to her, ready to take over once Luna starts to drift away, which will inevitably happen.
-I never properly invited anyone anywhere, I have no idea what people do in such situations.
-It’s okay,-Ron interrupted his river of excuses.
-Fine,-she sighed,-Grab the brooms, I’ll throw the snitch,-more than a half of the crowd was already gone. Harry, still afraid to meet eyes with Ron, just grabbed two relatively same school broomsticks, threw one to Draco and waited.
-It smells horrible,-Draco said, closing his eyes
-I could just take a new one,-he said.
Harry and Draco ran to the Quidditch field, and while Potter was a couple steps ahead and couldn’t see Draco’s face, he smiled. And wasn’t as assured in Hufflepuff’s victory as he was an hour ago.
-I heard they let him go,-Harry said carefully. He hadn’t told anyone about his visit to Ministry of Magic during Malfoy’s trial and didn’t plan to.
-He was 16.
Kingsley looked at him with weird compassion, creating a very false illusion that he was on Draco’s side. Or maybe his new raise to Minister of Magic still blew his mind enough to care about other people. Yet, when the trial started, all Draco’s hopes faded away. He was looking at 20 years in Azkaban. More than enough to drive a person crazy, more than enough to kill. Draco listened to Kingsley’s speech as he listed everything Draco was accused for. Malfoy had pretty much nothing to defend himself with. His father had already given out all the names of Death Eaters Ministry would want to know. It didn’t help him. It could have helped Draco though.
-She told me,-Draco replied.
-Congratulations to the team of 8th year and especially to their Seeker, Draco Malfoy!-Luna announced. Draco was already on the ground and his teammates started landing too.
-Oh, hi,-Potter didn’t recognize her. Her tie said she was from Ravenclaw, 7
-And you have absolutely nothing to do with it,-Draco had goosebumps as a familiar deep voice flew across the room. He looked up and saw Albus Dumbledore, not exactly in the flesh, smiling to him from his portrait,-I apologize for the interruption, Minerva,-he said. McGonagall just smiled sadly,-And you, Mister Malfoy, need to stop taking blame away from Voldemort. If there’s anyone responsible for the horrors of past couple years, it’s him. And definitely not you.
-No, really. He’s not very young too, but…help is help, right?-she nodded. Tears were shining in her eyes,-Kreacher? I need you,-Harry said and a second later Harry’s old pal appeared in front of them.
-Yeah. Yeah, it was,-Harry smiled. And stood slightly closer to Draco,-I also wanted to ask something,-Harry wasn’t sure if that was the Gryffindor’s courage that finally woke up in him, or alcohol, but once again, he just had to ask.
-Hardly anyone else from Slytherin is coming back. There’s him and a couple more people max.
, a “no” is an empty sound,- And isn't it a bad thing?
-Azkaban. You saved me. I owe you now.
-There’s nothing to save, Draco,-Narcissa cut off her son. Him mentioning the Manor seemed to have woken her up. Draco’s mother now sounded firm and strict.
Harry woke up happier than usual that day. He walked to the Great Hall confident to get the highest mark on his assignment; he already had a date for the ball, which protected him from girls’ attacks; and though he caught people whispering and starring at him, he was kind of used to it already.
-I…,-Draco threw a quick glance at Harry,-I don’t want to bother you with this long, boring story, ma’am.
-Yeah,-Draco buried his face in the cup, tasting the bittersweet drink and inhaling the smell. He waited for coffee to do its special magic, but it almost never worked on him.
-5 years is a lot of time!-Draco cut him off,-And even then, coming back there every summer? She is unhappy there!
-Draco, go! It’s okay!- Madam Polkinghorne said as she managed to drag her into the bedroom. Even when the door closed, Harry and Draco still heard her gut-wrenching cries. For a second Draco stood there and then stormed out of the building so quickly that Harry didn’t even get to react.
-Good night!-Harry said to him before he could disappear behind the door. Draco looked at him with that stupid and adorable expression he had every time Potter said something nice to him. He smiled, nodded and closed the door behind himself.
-I remember you. Of course I remember you, my dear boy,-she smiled. Harry had never seen her do that,-Lucius is a very decent man. I remember how happy my brother was the day he asked to marry Narcissa. How are they doing?
-Oh, yes, absolutely. Very insulted,-Draco said, hiding a smile and hoping Walburga doesn’t sense his sarcasm.
Molly had been cleaning and cooking for days and the guests were met with the familiar smell of delicious meals and deserts, mixed with usual, but unidentifiable smell that house always had. A smell of home, of sun, of love. Harry led as he walked into the house. Last summer had changed his life so much – it changed him – but The Burrow didn’t seem to change at all. It stood tall as a symbol of a home Harry thought he never had, but actually always did. The small rooms, low ceilings, narrow halls – all was so familiar and full of memories. The bittersweet feeling of nostalgia filled Harry completely.
(See the end of the chapter for
-I don’t even know what that means,-Harry started approaching him. A slight smile started blooming on his face,-But I want to be your friend. And I can’t stand seeing my friends being treated like that.
-Yeah, so how did it go? What did she say?-Harry was so desperately trying to switch the subject that Draco played along. But knowing that someone, no, not just someone, that Harry actually waited for him was...nice.
“Yes, but those who had to stay in Hogwarts, they are the real heroes”
Harry knew loneliness first hand. Maybe Draco’s parents weren’t dead, but they couldn’t be with him now when he needed them. And unlike Potter he never had a big loud happy family of a friend to give him a home when he needed it. Never had friends that would give up on anything for him and follow him till the very end. And seeing that, Harry, who had spent most of his life assured in his own absolute loneliness, now knew how wrong he was.
-The House of Blacks!-he exclaimed,-You live here?
-I thought the elf was like a final gift
When you literally die once and right after that kill your biggest enemy, it sort of changes the way you see things.  And after spending 7 years of your life, of your childhood, fighting, losing, fearing, seeing blood, seeing friends and family go before their time, seeing lives being destroyed, children turned into orphans, it can’t help but leave a mark on you.  One, that just won’t let you sign up for a lifetime of blood, pain and fights again. And of course the evil didn’t end with Voldemort and there was still a lot in this world to change, a lot to fight, but Harry had done his job, fulfilled his destiny, if you will. Why can’t someone else handle the rest?
-Aren’t Hufflepuffs supposed to be the weakest team?-Hermione asked Harry. She had never been this worried about a Quidditch game before. Maybe only when Harry was attacked during one.
-Mate? You’re done?-Ron woke Harry up from his thoughts. He quickly got dressed and went out to let Weasley see the suit
-You have to go now! Right now!-Filch grabbed him by the sleeve and started dragging Draco towards the door.
-Very noble of you, Harry,-Kingsley said. Harry didn’t say anything, but Draco was sure he shook his head,-Did you mean what you said? You can tell me now, it won’t affect Malfoy.
It just…It didn’t really make him feel any better when his friends didn’t notice him if he left the table earlier, for example. Or stopped waiting for him to get to the class together. Harry understood it all. Love, what can they do? They stopped noticing everyone and everything except for each other, and had every right to. There was no reason to look after each other now, everyone was safe, and if one of them gets late for the class, it’s because they slept in, not because they were kidnapped.
It’s unlikely that it was an accident, but according to their schedule, Hermione, Ron and Harry went one after another, and as soon as their actual classes ended (academic aspect of that year was so simple and primitive that Hermione considered going up to McGonagall specifically to talk about that, but Ron convinced her to enjoy the simple life), three of them headed to the Headmistress’s office. Harry was visibly nervous and did his best to avoid any conversation. He had an idea on what kind of questions he will be asked - they had similar sessions back in 5th year - but didn’t know any answers. Back then McGonagall made a very dramatic and heartfelt promise to do everything she could to make Harry an auror. Is he about to disappoint her too?
-It was…indescribable, she didn’t shut up for weeks,-Harry said,-Okay, how do you feel about muggle food?
-Easy for you to say, mother. You’re living your best life. I’m stuck here all alone,-he said.
-What is this?-Draco asked pointing at pizza Harry brought. He seemed to have asked that question for a thousandth time that day.
-HARRY, SHUT UP!-Hermione kicked him and he looked at her, not noticing a sharp angle in snitch’s trajectory. Suddenly it flew towards the ground. Dora wasn’t ready for such move and inertia carried her away onward, while Draco noticed it and made a move that made the whole crowd gasp.
-They already get along just fine! Look at them!-at that exact moment, Ron was giving Malfoy a pat on the shoulder for another well-caught snitch. Harry would rather have them fight.
-It’s my time,-Hermione said as one of the Hufflepuff 7th year students walked out of the office. She was holding a brochure that said “Astronomy! A new way to look at life!” and had a few tears on her eyes that contrasted with a big bright smile on her lips. The girl threw a hopeful glance around herself and ran towards her common room.
-You spent the whole dinner yesterday discussing the color of your bow tie,-Harry sighed. Now he was almost sure that Draco wouldn’t show up. And it upset him, but at the same time it was a relief. His nerves had been killing him for a week before the Ball, and maybe it would be for the best if he spends it with his friends. As a third wheel. Again.
-You want to come back tomorrow?-Draco asked, clearly expecting negative answer.
-Yes. This is your new home,-Harry said. Kreacher’s face expressed shock, then horror.
(See the end of the chapter for
-He’s still your father. Mine was a bully when he was a little younger than us,-Harry realized it was a shitty example just after he said it. And made sure of it after Draco scoffed sadly.
-Come up with something new, Harris. I’m getting bored.
-Harry! What’s wrong?-the voices of Ron and Hermione pulled him back into reality. They stood right in front of the entrance, Ron’s jacket on Hermione’s shoulders, concerned looks on both of their faces,-Where were you?
-I won't forget. Promise,-their forehead touched and Draco felt Harry's heavy breath on his skin. It sent thousands goosebumps down his body.
year”!-Pansy laughed
-See you inside!-Luna waved and together with Ginny walked into the Great Hall. Harry was sure people would stare at them. But Luna was used to that and wouldn’t care. And Ginny seemed too happy to care. But then he imagined how people would stare at him when he walks in with Malfoy and a wave of anxiety that came with that realization almost knocked him off his feet.
-Because he would definitely tell us so, if it was, right?
Draco looked into the painting, not sure what to do. Ron’s and Zabini’s words didn’t bother him. Potter’s silence sort of did.
-Yes.
-What?-Harry didn’t see what was wrong in Ron’s outfit. In his opinion, he looked great.
-Children?-Kreacher asked, horrified. Harry nodded,-Whatever Master Potter wishes…
Draco didn’t know what to say. He got pale, but at the same time an unexpected warm feeling flooded his heart.
Draco whispered a secret password into the door and it opened, revealing a long hall with many many doors by both sides of it. Following Malfoy in, Harry felt weird case of déjà vu. This place reminded him of an orphanage from Tom Riddle’s memories. It was much lighter and more welcoming, but still, it was a sad place. One that presumably pushed little Tom over the edge of madness. One Harry himself could have ended up in. He wondered if living there was better than with Dursleys.
Also excuse me for disappearing again, i'd say i won't do it again, but i probably will.
-I’m not asking. You’re doing it,-she put her hands on his shoulders. Draco was about to resist, but Pansy shook her head and repeated,-You are doing it. Go.
-I’m sorry, Professor, it was my fault,-Harry stepped up immediately, not giving Draco even a chance to open his mouth,-Can we still try out? Please?
-Any one you’d like,-Harry quickly grabbed Aurors’ brochure and without looking at McGonagall, disappeared behind the door.
-Oh my god,-Harry laughed. He couldn’t wait to tell that to Hermione. Pansy’s sudden “coming out” really served as an ice-breaker. Harry’s nerves calmed down and he finally – finally – started enjoying the ball. Through at least 4 more songs they talk about every stupid prank they pulled on each other, every time one of them went an extra mile just to screw another over, about the Potter Stinks pins (Draco still considered them high comedy), about “that time you climbed a damn tree to bully me!” (Draco denied that ever happened) and all other endless cases of their stupidity.
-I said the truth,-Draco imagined Harry shrugging,-Of course I meant it.
-Draco, please,-a quiet female voice made Harry get even closer to the door to hear it.
-Finally!-Ron exclaimed when he paid for his tux and was free to go back to school. Already relaxed but still very tired he opened the door and almost left the store when…,-Wait!-he shut the door right before Harry’s nose,-What are you wearing?
-Luna told me. She said he saw how Filch made you leave,-Draco nodded. And smiled. Luna really was something else,-Can I walk you to the Hogsmeade?-his teeth were shaking, his cheeks were bright red and every word he said made a huge cloud of steam fly out of his mouth. But Harry didn’t notice it.
-Kind of, yes.
The ghosts of Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Dumbledore, Snape, Fred, even Cedrick wouldn’t stop haunting Harry. He couldn’t feel any satisfaction from the defeat, knowing that Teddy Lupin will never meet his parents. Knowing that Amos Diggory had to bury his own child. Knowing that George Weasley will never be able to look into his own reflection without a second thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
Same thing happened again this weekend. Harry spent it wondering where Malfoy was and why did he leave, except this time, he wasn’t the only person missing in the Hogwarts. It could have been completely unrelated but Luna Lovegood also was nowhere to be found. She could have been visiting her father at home. Or a friend. Or anyone. But something told Harry it was more than just a coincidence they both quietly disappeared.
-Oh,-Harry chuckled nervously and looked at Draco, terrified. He let down his defenses for a while and it didn’t pay off,-I would love to, really. But I already have a date,-his lie was so clear that Draco groaned.
-Oh no, Malfoy, please don’t go!-he almost yelled,-You are the one Harry shares everything with now, you should be a part of this conversation,-Draco froze.
-For what?
Hope you enjoyed the new chapter!
-Does she know about…well,-Harry asked, regretting it right away, but Draco knew what he wanted to know without even him having to say that.
-Sorry, sir,-Harry mumbled, but quickly turned back to Draco,-So? Are you going to admit it now?
-Catch the snitch,-Potter said
-Could be cheating,-the whole room turned towards the voice. Zacharias Smith and Michael Harris stood side by side, both sober, both not very welcomed here.
-Let’s go,-Pansy said after a while and took Draco’s hand. He followed her, not even looking at Harry. Potter couldn’t believe that something he had done 6 years ago could have such ridiculous but serious consequences. Couldn’t believe it was so important to Draco.
Draco apologized about being late again and finally took Lucy to the other children, to canteen, leaving Madam Polkinghorne complaining. Lucy didn’t want to sit with them and or participate in any conversations. Instead, she chose to stay with Draco and Harry. With time her morning hysteria wore off and she was happy and talkative again, asking them about what they did yesterday and absolutely ignoring any other kids. Harry could assume that she was still a little upset and felt safer next to “adults”, but since the same situation happened yesterday, he started seeing a pattern there. And it concerned him.
Heeeey
-Four on one, Harris?-Harry asked with his loudest strictest voice,-Very noble.
-Maybe,-Harry said, leaning back in his chair,-But you just called me adorable,-Harry didn’t manage to hold in a small smirk.
-We will play a game that should help us narrow your opportunities down. Now, close your eyes,-Draco did as he was told. His heart immediately started beating faster,-Imagine that none of your previous actions or mistakes have any impact on your future. Imagine that all of your grates are excellent, which is almost true, imagine that all the doors are open,-Draco slightly nodded. He liked what he was seeing,-Also, you don’t have to make money. There’s no such thing as money. And not a single person in this world has any expectations on you. No peer pressure, no social statuses, nothing. Imagined?
-What? Why?
-Sure. Thank you, Ginny. A lot,-Weasley winked and disappeared behind the door. Normally, people feel sadness and pain after such conversations. Harry felt hopefulness. And something told him Ginny felt the same. Or almost the same. He truly cared for Ginny, saw her as a family. Loved her. Just not in the way he was expected to.
-Hey, guys,-she said after a few very awkward for Harry seconds,-Looking good.
-I am very happy that you have decided to continue and finish your education here, in Hogwarts,-she said,-The castle is always ready to welcome whoever truly wants to learn something. And now you are standing in front of your new common room.
-You don’t,-Hermione sighed and handed him paper she had been writing,-I had nothing to do,-Harry took the paper and read the title. His essay. With his name on it. Written better than he could ever dream to write.
-What took you so long?-Ron said what Harry wanted, but wouldn’t ask.
-I don’t like being lied to. And I don’t like being anyone’s second choice. Especially after Malfoy. You decided to switch sides now?,-for a second Harry just couldn’t believe what Ron just said.
-I’m not going,-Draco said and looked into the window.
Hermione rolled her eyes, a couple of heads nodded, others had no idea where Harry was coming from.
-I said it just so the ministry would let you go,-Harry said, not sure why he was looking for excuses for the truth
-Yes. Draco Malfoy is not an actual Death Eater. He never was,-Harry said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. His statement caused a few gasps over the room. A small smirk appeared on Kingsley’s lips.
-Look!-Ron pointed him at the mirror,-It’s the one! You should get it!-Harry almost didn’t recognize himself in the mirror. Though it wasn’t a complete look – he probably will have to do something with his hair – even now, he looked so different. In a good way. Not like a shy confused kid who never knew where he actually belonged and wore hand-me-down clothes that never fit. He looked mature, organized, confident. But at the same time, the tux didn’t destroy Harry’s personality – he still looked like himself. He smiled. It was the one.
Hello, everyone!
-Harry…
-Of course no! Why would you even think that?-he asked
-On the lips?-Harry groaned and Granger accepted it as a positive answer,-Well, it’s…,-she started saying something, but actually had no idea where she was going with that sentence. It was one of those rare cases where Hermione Granger didn’t know what to say. But Ron Weasley did.
-Good. I’m going to sleep,-he said and stormed to the dorm.
-Is she okay?
Draco and Harry didn’t talk anymore. They just stood beside each other and waited for Ron to come out. And once he did, holding a “Auror: the most important job in the Wizarding World” brochure, Draco smirked and threw a weird glance at Potter. Harry looked at him with a plea/threat in his eyes, hoping Draco would get it and not open his mouth.
-Nothing unusual,-Luna smiled. Harry was losing his patience.
-My name is Draco Malfoy, ma’am,-Draco said, bowing down. Woman on the portrait was rather satisfied with him.
-Really? Well, you are SO dramatic, I can’t even begin to describe!-they both were laughing now, talking over each other,-You should have seen your face, really.
-Really?
-What?
-No one wants her,-Draco said, doomily,-Everyone wants little babies they can pretend were theirs from the start. No one wants an already formed child with her own temper,-Draco sighed,-I know I can’t do much. They wouldn’t give her to me even if I tried. It’s just…
-I’m…I’m sorry,-Draco looked at Harry as if he just remembered he was there.
-I testified for Draco this summer. I don’t know how much credit I should take for the fact that he’s free…Draco keeps saying that he owes it to me, but it’s not true,-Harry expected Ron to get mad immediately. But he wasn’t mad. His face didn’t change at all,-It wasn’t just my secret, Ron. I didn’t know if I could tell anyone, I promised Kingsley to keep it a secret, I…
-I actually wanted to talk to you about something,-he started. Molly looked at him,-A few weeks ago I went to a…to an orphanage with Draco,-Harry looked away and pretended to be very invested in his dish-wiping duty. He waited for Molly to react and overall did his best to make it look as a casual conversation and not let his pounding heart and panicking brain be clear to the woman next to him.
-Where, if I may ask?
-I…I don’t…
-We’ll see,-before Draco could resist, Harry looked at his watch,-We better go to the field if you don’t want Ron to kill you.
…or 6
Because Draco is lonely. Because he feels like the whole world had turned its back on him. Because he is desperate, insecure and lost. And though Malfoy would rather die than admit any of it, he doesn’t really have to, not to Harry. It takes one to know one, right?
-You mean that piece of trash Weasley is making? Yes, that’s what happened,-Draco rolled his eyes, which hurt unexpectedly badly.
-If your desire to become an auror is still as strong as three years ago – or as strong as Mister Weasley’s – we won’t be here for long.
-I don’t know, Ron,-Harry started, but got distracted by Draco passing them. Harry took his bag off the seat next to him, freeing it for Malfoy, but he didn’t even look at it. Draco nodded at the trio and walked past them, taking his usual seat in the end of the table. Harry forgot all about Ron’s question and just watched Draco, while Ron and Hermione watched him.
-Not really,-Ron leaned back on the couch,-But it’s okay if you are. Have you even seen Malfoy today?
-There’s one thing…
But seriously, why didn’t you tell us you didn’t want to be an auror anymore?-Hermione asked after a pause.
-Most likely,-Hermione answered and took Ron’s hand as he was getting angry.
-When’s your turn?-he flinched a little once Potter appeared next to him. But instead of replying, silently handed him his piece of paper with a number on it,-Right after me,-Draco nodded,-Do you already know what you want to do?
-Nothing. How did it go?-Harry asked, hoping to engage him into a conversation.
-Forget it, really,-Draco grabbed his uniform and stormed out of the room. The match was getting closer with every minute.
-Stop being so grumpy, you’ve missed this!-she said, raising her hands. Draco agreed, but didn’t plan to show it,-I’ll be right back,-Pansy disappeared in girls’ dorm, finally leaving Draco and Harry alone.
-I think I…changed my mind,-Harry said and Minerva didn’t seem a single bit surprised
-May I ask why?
So instead Harry would bring his homework and complete it listening to screams and rare laughter coming from the field. This way he also felt as if Quidditch was still a part of his life. It reminded him of the first time he caught a snitch. Or of that ridiculous story that actually got him on the team. Which also happened because of Draco. Huh.
-She’s been crying the whole bloody morning!- Madam Polkinghorne was clearly disappointed in Lucy’s behavior and threw strict glances at her.
-Yes?-his eyes were red, so was almost his whole face. Cold, or tears, Harry couldn’t tell. Probably both.
-If you could actually do anything to me, you would have already done it,-Draco spit out.
-Well, did you buy it? It’s not like I’m interrupting anything.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Yes. Are you friends too?-Lucy asked. Harry looked at Draco for a second and nodded.
-I guess I should go,-Harry said, mostly to himself. Draco nodded and stepped away. They already said their goodbyes. It was over. Something that never started was already over. Draco turned away, but Harry stood there, looking at his back, fighting a strong desire to call out his name.
shall i say i almost lost my mind?
-Nothing. Go back to sleep,-Harry still pointed his wand at Draco and thanks to the bright lumos light he could see him, his whole body. And for a second, it kind of astounded him. Draco hadn’t actually worn short sleeves in more than two years, and he wouldn’t do it now too, if he had an alternative. The lack of sleeves revealed all Draco wanted to hide. The Mark, first and foremost. The scars from Sectumsempra that grew all over his body like spiderweb and the closer they were to his chest, the thicker and brighter they were. More other scars on his arms, those that had already started fading away. More short scars – more like cuts -  on the Mark. Harry wanted to stop looking, but couldn’t.
Thank you!
Harry didn’t care. That attack he accidentally witnessed made him ten times more interested in Draco’s life and condition. What he knew was that his father’s sentence in Azkaban wouldn’t let him see his son anytime soon, and his mother had been MIA ever since the end of the war. Harry didn’t believe that a woman like Narcissa, the I-will-risk-my-life-and-lie-to-Voldemort-to-save-my-son one, could just abandon him. But still, Malfoy was obviously very lonely and needed someone to help him cope with everything he had been, and still is going through. At least that’s what Harry thought.
-I did,-Draco closed the door and opened his closet, taking out his Quidditch uniform,-It’s not just a bruise and she said it would disappear in a few hours. Or days.
-It…it changes from time to time, really,-Harry said,-But never say that in front of Ron.
Draco lead Harry to one of the rooms, in the very end of the hall. The hall itself was rather narrow and Harry had to walk behind Draco to fit there. Carefully and as quietly as possible Draco opened the door. There were six little girls, all sleeping, not one older than 6. Draco smiled slightly, but erased his smile as he saw Potter looking at him.
-Really? Do you know who?
Ron and Hermione exchanged glances.
-It’s not even the worst one,-he said and wanted to add something, but the door behind them opened and a small curly girl walked out, wiping her eyes. Harry’s heart shrunk looking at her.
-Eavesdropping, Malfoy?-Harry asked playfully.
-What did you just say to me?
-Mister Malfoy,-McGonagall closed the binder with a sigh. She knew that possible unemployment was only the tip of the iceberg,-I would love to tell you that your past won't ever affect you or your future in any way and that there is nothing but happiness coming your way. Unfortunately, there isn't a single person in this school I can say that to,-she made a pause, watching Draco’s reaction, but he remained unconvinced,- What had happened to all of us couldn't help to leave impact. On ones worse than on others. Yet, that doesn’t mean we should just give up on ourselves.
-It’s the one,-Ron didn’t add anything. But he looked so confident in his words that he didn’t have to.
-I’m sure. It’s not news for Hermione,-she looked at Ron with a weak smile, while concern grew on his face,-I wanted to tell you for a while…
He did feel like a new person, looking at his body like this. Not because of “ruination” but simply because he looked…solid. The extra weight, while cumbersome at times or clumsy in others, forced him to stay grounded. His belly and hips were the most impressive, but the new kilos was starting to round out the top of his belly, almost like how it looked when he was stuffed. He didn’t intentionally stuff himself so much anymore, but he tapped his fingers thoughtfully over the rest of his belly; what would that feel like without the feeling of shame? Instead of the aching thrill of taboo, a luxuriant embrace of how his fat, flabby body was actually something he found extremely enticing?
. No one would ever have to know that the Malfoy heir was slowly gorging himself and fattening up like a prized hog as he quietly disappeared into the expected penance of being a social pariah for life.
Lazily, he brought his hands up and traced them lightly over his lush and sensitive skin, enjoying the lingering euphoria as it slowly drifted away. He cupped his chest again and imagined a time where maybe it’d be too much flesh to comfortably cover with one hand. Looking down at the wobbling crest of his belly, he wondered of a time where maybe the small movement would make him even more aware of his thickening chin and if there might come a time where he wouldn’t be able to see over the swollen line of his hefty paunch. Yes, he decided, he was fat. But he could be a lot fatter with a little attention.
“The lines of those seams are absolutely wasted on her figure,” he said, looking at the way the stiff material bunched into a zigzag just above her hips. “A few more pounds and she’ll be lucky if her arse isn’t falling out the back end.”
“I don’t think…that Blaise meant you should go get fat,” Adrienne said bluntly. “And don’t think that it’s some kind of apology to me. If it was, you really didn’t have to go this far.”
. Hips that swayed a little more than he remembered to account for at times, and shirts that he didn’t always realize were quite so stretched out after a night of carousing with Blaise and Adrienne. But it was easier with the two of them. For a brief period, even Blaise had put on some weight as a part of a bulking regime, and Draco was struck by just how…
He tried to say it lightly but it had tension laced through it. Luckily, Blaise didn’t ask after it, just nodded. That’s what he’d always liked about Blaise; his tact. That and him being brutally handsome, but Draco’d never had a chance there without his father finding out.
“Unless you’re afraid of me crushing you.”
, he realized now. Adrienne’s confidence had been a foundational piece of realizing that, but Blaise compliments never ceased either when it came to new outfits or if he looked especially good one day or the other and it never came with any criticism of how something might look if he were only a little thinner.
Draco did not expect to see Potter’s eyes take on a wicked glint behind his glasses. He startled, his thick gut bouncing as he felt Potter’s hand slowly,
“Yeah, that’s true.”
He paused before stepping on, suddenly a little afraid; the last time he’d gained weight without noticing was because he’d been a spiralling depression. That was ridiculous this time though, he thought giving his head a little shake. If he’d put on any weight it was likely because he was spending more time studying for his new job inspecting old tomes and snacking while doing so. He never did it while actually having the book in front of him of course, but frequently found himself a step back from the pristine tables in the Research Library with a snack in hand as he pondered whether or not a book was about to go homicidal on him. His mentor seemed delighted with his progress, assuring him that he had a knack for the job seeing that he hadn’t been on the receiving end of a literary attack even once yet.
a full twenty four kilos above his increasingly unattainable “regular” weight.
Adrienne blinked placidly at him, her silence unnerving him as it stretched. She looked down at the table, inspecting her carefully painted nails. A little bulge of a second chin poked out when she did so and Draco couldn’t help but immediately reach up to his own chin, wondering if he had one too when he looked down now.
“Leave it to you to be more interested in the fashion rather than the buffet of men in front of you. You’ve drawn quite a lot of attention,” his friend said, gesturing out in front of them. And yes, there were people staring and for a tense moment Draco thought it might be because someone recognized him. But peering out into the crowd, even trying to imagine the faces as the fattened thick chins, necks and cheeks of his former classmates, he wasn’t able to pick anyone out.
Draco let himself soften again.
Potter did answer immediately, but Draco could practically feel the energy thrumming off of him.
He said, pointedly looking at a pink leather harness with an abundance of rings for it to weave in and out of. Not his colour, but the craftsmanship was noteworthy.
Blaise patted the side of his belly affectionately, getting his attention to nod towards a man making eyes at him. It was the man he’s so openly gawked at before for the flattering choice of his harness.
“It’s good to see  you,” Draco said, trying to smooth out the tension in his words. Blaise hadn’t even been at the Battle of Hogwarts and was of anyone he’d ever known, the most non-Partisan. He and his mother knew the most important rule of things; survive. Unlike his own parents, keeping a distance had been the best route at that.
He slept well that night, soothed into the reassurance that his increasingly zaftig form was capable, strangely, of allowing him to pass through this world unnoticed. He brought himself off after a long struggle of manoeuvring his bloated belly to properly stroke himself and slept well into the next day before going for his breakfast to the pastry shop down the road. It was the only one worth eating from in the city in his opinion and its quality hadn’t eroded in his absence. From there, he spent much of his day eating, working on rounding out his belly to the perfect swell of fullness that he wanted for the party.
when he walked. His chest was going soft and a little mound of fat had begun to make his nipples peak out. His thighs touched and chafed and each time he sat he swore his arse took up more space, spilled over more of the edges of his seats. And honestly, if it was anyone else, he’d likely think little of it. But it was him and he was out of control, shamefully tubby and only getting rounder with each passing day. As often as he could he, bloated himself into blissful oblivion, embracing the heavy comfort of being pinned back by his own increasing mass.
Objectively, whenever he looked at himself he knew that he was just as fashionable in clothes that were tailored just as well as they’d ever been except now…now he had a gut. A thick paunch that always stuck out no matter what he wore and a thick, answering curve of an arse behind him. He
“Sorry, I didn’t mean—of course you have a job.”
“I’ve been depressed,” he said and it felt out flat in front of him, bare and honest. “Ever since the war, I just haven’t seen the point of anything. I haven’t got
been easy and made even easier by their general choices of activities; if it wasn’t expensive parties they were slumming it in seedy bars at drag shows where a sharp tongue was par for the course. Suddenly Portia’s frequent and glowing commendations on his wit didn’t fill him with the same warmth anymore.
Blaise’s mouth quirked into the smallest of smiles. They’d never been on bad terms and as he held out his large hand to clasp Draco’s, apparently that hadn’t changed.
Before being fat had been embarrassing, but now he was actually embarrassed by how little attention he needed from others. It wasn't that he was incapable of finding a sexual desire for other men, it was only that he knew his body best. He knew what he liked; that was another boundary of his gaining. He needed to be able to service his own body as he saw fit without assistance. The snobbishness in him didn’t want to rely on educating anyone to whom it didn’t come naturally.
“You think you’d be the biggest person I’ve ever slept with?”
Remembering the time, he made short work of himself and was glad for taking off his trousers as the hot seed of his own cock flushed up onto his wide gut. He laid back after the white hot, blinding rush of his orgasm crashed through him and felt his fat, wobbling body quiver as he caught his breath. He actually had quite a good stamina, considering, but any exertion was just so much more evident on his body. If he’d had more time, he’d have happily drawn out the moment longer, let himself edge into it until coming would be practically earth-shattering.
enough to notice and fuck, it looked good. He’d grown so keen on his own body that he’d gone and started to relax into even more.
“I’m not ready for England to know how fat I am now anyways,” he said truthfully. He loved his body, he did. He just didn’t need it sensationalized in a way he was sure would be especially cruel.
“Of course. I might not need the money, but I do appreciate the purpose. I work and I
my work.”
recognized; not one of them gave him a second look. He saw the painfully pinched looking Weasley boy that’d worked for the Ministry during the war, saw Hermione Granger dashing to a Floo with a tremendous stack of books of her own in what was striking caricature of his memory of her, and nearly knocked over a young woman he knew for certain had been a few years under him at school. He apologized and braced the side of his belly that she’d run into and she spent enough time apologizing profusely herself that she should have had enough time to get an inkling of who he was if she was going to get an idea of it at all.
it. He had to stand with his legs spread out to balance his belly no matter how much muscle he put on and it made his back ache. His knees felt somehow both sharp and swollen if he stood for too long and his arms were forced out further from his sides in a way that chafed the soft skin of his underarms. While not opposed to gaining more in and of itself, he supposed that he was starting to find that the line was drawn at when the weight started to impede his daily enjoyment of life. He enjoyed gaining, but for as much time as he spent on it, he was finding other things to fill his life as well.
“You know,” he said, thin fingers splayed out and holding his page open. “being a skinny bitch isn’t much of a substitute for a personality.”
Draco hummed, smoothing a palm over where Gaspard had manhandled him.
“Perhaps I should go,” Draco said, voice strained. He tried to clear it, but it came out in a pained choking noise. All he had to do was apologize, but the longer he took the more difficult it became, as though time had already hurdled into the next week. He felt sick to his stomach. He liked Adrienne; a lot. Perhaps even the best of the lot. Glancing around at the faces of Blaise’s friends, he saw similar looks of embarrassment. Seeing the passivity that’d fallen around him, he clenched his jaw and locked his gaze with Adrienne's.
“Ah…yes. That would be very kind of you.”
Draco didn’t mean to scowl. He really, really didn’t. It was just his face though and he saw Blaise immediately frown. Draco took in a breath and let his shoulders drop when he felt assured that his belly wasn’t the flabby mess it’d been a few months prior; Blaise wouldn’t have any way of knowing that it’d happened at all.
“Cheers, Potter.”
“Paris,” Draco said. “We own a townhouse there as well. I’ve got a job there, too.”
crossed his mind; did he have a limit? It was hard to think of one in this moment, imagining instead his hips bulging out further and his belly taking a more permanently rounded look whether or not it was stuffed. Looking down at his hands he felt the little pouch of softness bulge out underneath his chin and nearly gasped as he sunk his pudgy hands into the soft flesh. Oh hell, when had his
, of all things. Draco pondered what to say or do next. He didn’t have any reconciliatory words to offer. It was early in the night; he could let Potter finish his drink and bid him adieu and find someone who’d come here intentionally to spend his time with. He didn’t have to have sex tonight to be satisfied; he simply liked to look, sometimes. Encouraged to love his own body as he saw others celebrate theirs. It was a simple pleasure that he rarely felt he needed others to enjoy.
; nothing ahead of me and only ruination behind me. So I guess…I just eat to feel something.”
“What’s a skinny boy like you doing here?” he asked, shifting himself carefully onto the stool beside Potter. Up this close, he was a bit pretty; pale skin looking striking against the long, dark lashes that framed his striking green eyes. Potter went red up to his ears and ducked his head.
“Do you need a quick run down on gay sex?” Blaise asked.
gotten pudgy? He raised one up to this face and let out a low breath of wonder as he took it into account. It might have only been a handful of extra kilos but it
