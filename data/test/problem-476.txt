“Why…”
“’You okay?” smiling, Lauris started opening the bottle and removed the remaining cork.
“Hi Jason,” Dean gave him a quick pat on the shoulder. “We’re going to play exploding snap and probably drink some hot chocolate, you wanna’ join?”
“Heavens forbid.” Snape dropped his hand, but the tight lips did curl in a tiny smile. Just for a moment, before the students behind Harry came too close and he had to move along. Stepping down and joining his friends he sat down on the nearest chair, waiting for Hermione’s name to be called. Obviously, she graduated on top of class and McGonagall seemed proud to announce it was the first in many years since that honor had gone to a Gryffindor.
“I don’t know,” Dean sarcastically drummed a finger against his lip. “Maybe because half of our classes are
Have a good day/night
“-Beside I have more important things to worry about now.”
“Don’t worry. You won’t be here for it.”
“Thanks, how is the walls coming?” Not being able to see behind him, the girl overlooked his shoulder.
“Potter, I want you to know I didn’t mean to upset you the other day… I just-“ Malfoy sighed. “This isn’t very easy for me. This whole change.”
“She was a witch in the eighteen hundred who fell in love with a dying man. Fearing for her life without him she turned to dark magic and on his deathbed, she turned him into an inferius. The second he woke up, he saw her and killed her.”
“Don’t be foolish. Whatever is in that letter is clearly for Severus to see, not you. I trust my lord to tell me whatever information I need. Do you believe yourself so arrogantly that you would dismiss his direct order?”
“NO, I won’t have it!”
Theodore Knott had come back to Hogwarts as well, but Draco hadn’t been worried he wouldn’t. The Knotts’ had never been an openly supportive group of dark arts, but what they lacked in dark arts, they made up for in connections, money and knowledge. Even if it killed Draco to say so, he knew the Knotts were a few generations older than the Malfoys.
“Love, you don’t have to..” Draco swept a hand through his black hair.
“And now?” Malfoy smirked. “What are you thinking?”
Looking closely at the blackened clippings in the flask, Snape finally spoke.
Unfortunately, his faking calming demeanour only lasted until a hissing cat sound ran its gross warm breath into his ear.
“Yes, I need new flying gloves.”
The pale boy’s eyes was getting slightly misty or Harry was fouling himself to believe it.
“Sorry.” Severus simply apologized.
“And then I just landed on his neck, it was kind of like sitting on a horse. Except a horse probably wouldn’t look so stupid since it would actually know I was there.”
Great, thank you for coming this far in the story.
Story is over. Such a weird feeling. It took me such a long time to write this and I am really pleased how it went.
Trying not to glare at him, Harry hurried to the empty seat and sat down. Of course, he should have realized that his golden luck would have led him to Slytherin territory. The seat beside Zabini, Malfoy and Jason had been the only available one. Even though Harry was fairly certain Jason only had sat down there to be close to Zabini. From the looks of it, Zabini wasn’t very pleased with the turn out.
‘Okay, now it was personal’ Draco realized. Only few times over the last six years had Snape called him by first name in school. Turning back Draco tried to keep his features open and tranquil.
The teen was sitting on a stone beam and staring out the window.
“Were should we go?” Draco pondered.
“Malfoy, has he seemed different since he started dating Harry?”
Calmly saying he would be back in a minute – mostly to keep Pansy from taking his favorite spot- he went upstairs into their room. Throwing his stuff onto their shared table, Blaise could almost have screamed when something in the darkened room, moved. Before he could have the time to embarrass himself, he noticed the blond head sticking out beneath the covers on the bed.
“Yes, Headmaster.”
“I guess.” Harry dried the last of his wet spots on his cheeks. “I’m just going to miss him a lot. It was so weird how quickly he grew. You should have seen him as a cub, he was truly adorable.”
“Albus please, why have you come?” Severus patience had run out and he couldn’t stand the small talk any further.
“Bitchy?”
“-And Blaise?”
“But I’m not-“
“It’s a little party tricks for adults.” He smiled. “You turn it on and it float around in between people and show off their aura when you look at a certain person. Like lust, happiness, drunkness-“
“But it’s the last time before Christmas…” Harry tried not to pout.
Still nothing.
“Sure, Luna, if you really want to.” Harry perplexed answered the bubbling blonde girl. “That reminds me…” Making sure Professor Flitwick was looking in the other direction; he quickly ripped off a tiny corner of his parchment and wrote a note.
Maybe he would need some help.
The burn was slowly going away and Draco must have felt the tension letting go, because he started pushing it in even further. This time, as he came to the knuckle, he pulled it back again. All the way out and all the way in again in an agonizingly slow pace. The Pain was ebbing away but it was still prominent. Draco must obviously have heard how quiet he had become because he suddenly started kissing his cheeks.
“Come on, it’s fun.” Harry pleaded and smiled encouraging. Shaking his head, Malfoy stopped resisting and got dragged into the warm shop.  There weren’t any new toys or collector items so they simply went around trying the test products. Harry left a cockroach on the blond boy’s shoulder, and the fake insect sat for almost a minute before Malfoy felt it screeching against his ear.
“I spent most of my summer thinking, wondering-“ Malfoy began quietly. “How Hogwarts was going to welcome us back.
Smiling, Jason suggested they got back to work.
“Please, Malfoy.” Harry gentle grabbed his arm. “I would really appreciate it.”
After getting a well-deserved nap in Divination, Harry and his friends left the overly warm tower. They had to be in Transfiguration in ten minutes so there was no time for anything but heading for class. As they went down the long spiralling staircase, they heard numerous of hushed frantic conversations. Looking down the corridors, Harry could see a bunch of Hufflepuffs whispering, walking towards them. As they went past, Harry gathered bits of the discussion.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” a voice from another of the chairs, asked. Zabini had clearly been hanging out with Knott, while Crabbe and Goyle were eating sweets from a Honeydukes’ bag, resting up against the wall.
‘SPLASH’
“Hagrid? It’s just me.” Harry announced.
This was definitely
“It goes without saying that no one in this room will tell others of this bet.” Draco sneered, looking around every single person in the compartment. Crabbe and Goyle quickly nodded their agreement, while Blaise just shook his head in amusement.
Only one present was left on the table between them and it was the present for Professor Snape. The older man quickly masked the obvious surprise as Harry handed him the gift. Snorting displeased by the sudden attention from everyone, Snape slowly unwrapped the gift. Just as his own present for Harry, the gift came in a vial. An even though the Professor incredibly badly wanted to be un-impartial it was quite clear that he was impressed by the present.
“I see.” Harry couldn’t help but ask the question at the tip of his tongue. “Malfoy?”
Harry gave him a playful elbow in the side. “Hey. They aren’t dorks, okay? It’s just rather unusual to see the two of us together. Without fighting at least... sooo I’m staying here. It’s always a nice Christmas anyway…. Visiting Hagrid, Hogsmeade, the library-“
Knott didn’t retort, but simply raised his eyebrows and smirked, getting back to his breakfast. Hoping the annoying banter was over, Draco was about to continue his own eating.
A pop sounded once more and a tray was placed on the table in front of him. When he didn’t react Snape must have had enough because the next minute a giant warm mug was forced into his hands. He grabbed the mug with both hands, securing he wouldn’t drop it before taking a shaking sip.
Glancing to the side, he once more noticed the short distance between him and Potter. Without saying anything, he relaxed his legs and spread them, so his knee pressed against the golden boy’s. He could see the small smile that spread across his face even without watching him. Potter didn’t seem to mind it but he certainly didn’t initiate anything either. Pulling back a little, as if on accident, he waited.
Realizing he wasn’t much help for now, Harry shifted his bored glance over the class. Most of the students sat concentrated and discussed their chosen topic while others, like him, decided on a small break by looking out the window.
Ignoring him, Draco continued to take notes in the middle of Professor McGonagall’s sentence. He wasn’t even sure what they were discussing, but he refused to let Blaise have the satisfaction of seeing how much this little rumor bothered him. It wasn’t even true. Of course, he and Potter would go together, they were dating after all. That kind of indicated that all social events were handled together. Potter had probably misspoken to the wrong person and Blaise had only recited a half-assed rumor.
“He likes yer’” he kept chuckling a Harry fought to keep the dragon still.
The wet squelching sound of dripping snow hit Draco right in the back of his head, while Harry’s hand were cradling his head. The surprised look on Draco’s face was worth the wrath he would probably face soon. Harry leaned back and roared with laughter as Draco ‘s face could only resemble to a hamster with too many sunflower seeds in his mouth. His cheeks red from running around in the cold widened and his hair was dripping with cold water.
Harry was unsure where on earth he got the confidence from, but he found himself teasingly touch Draco’s thigh and running his hand unbelievable close to his crotch. He involuntarily cheered as he could feel Draco shift excitingly under his warm hand.
your family and losing a member of the family takes its toll on us. It is human nature. I have lost as well in the war and I do not believe it is clever to ignore the facts of the matter.”
“So you guys dated?” It seemed totally weird to think of his friend ‘making out’ with Professor Snape. Harry grimaced at the idea. Seeing the expression on Harry’s face, the werewolf started chuckling.
“Yes.”
“Yeah?” Harry whispered.
Harry didn’t stop but slowed down enough for her to catch up. “Harry?”
“I see…” Jason had been right. At least a little. Harry pondered. “I suppose it wouldn’t be for anybody. But I would be glad if you tried a little harder, at least while you are talking to me.”
“Don’t know. There was no sign or clue of Snape having stayed with my father in Australia. The only reason I found out who he was, is because the aurors’ team collected everything for me, including my family’s old tapestry of birthing records. Over my name stood my parents’ names and Snape’s was the only one who hadn’t been stretched out.”  Jason explained.
Oh great.
He obviously expected Severus to answer him and the taller young man tried to withhold his feelings of enjoyment.
‘Malfoy is unbelievable! God, that bastard is never going to change.’ Harry thought as he stormed down the corridor. He should probably call off their trip to Hogsmeade all together. They could hold up a decent conversation for about two minutes, but deeper issues had to matter as well. At some point, they would have to discuss their society or politics and they were clearly in disagreement. Even though Malfoy claimed to have changed, it certainly wasn’t enough.
“Oh,” Harry grabbed a handful of hair as the biting turned into sucking right under his jawline.
Blaise and he had always been friends. Real friends. Not only because their parents forced them to converse when they were younger but because their level of sophistication and intelligence were resembling. Beside Blaise, sat the only other person in the compartment whom Draco could without some doubt say had more between his ears than skin and fat.
“You too.” Harry friendly smiled.
“What?”
“Great, mate. It will be just like fourth year, except this party might actually be fun!” Ron cheered. Seeing how happy it made his oldest friend, Harry couldn’t even feel slightly bad he wouldn’t be entering the dance with Draco. Even though that would certainly be a fun conversation…
The tiny creature frowned her non-existing eyebrows at him, probably finding it odd for a student to send a Professor a load of presents.
‘Draco was getting married.’
In the common room, the boys placed themselves on the floor surrendered by wrapping paper, ribbons and greeting cards. Harry still hadn’t opened his own present to see if it was as good as he had hoped. Right now, he simply helped his extraordinarily bad wrapping-friend with his presents. He would still have time before the train arrived to get his own one wrapped.
Harry wasn’t sure how he felt about it. Would he actually
In. And. Out.
Slytherin?”
A hand gesture was all he was given and he left without another word.
For a second, Harry just stood there looking at him. Seeing the stupid smirk on his face. Listening to him degrading his friend. And suddenly, hurt wasn’t the main emotion anymore. Anger. Pure, old, hatred. Hatred that charged through his veins, reminding him of everything and every way Malfoy had made his life miserable over the years.
HG POV
Realising Snape was no longer walking beside him, Harry turned around. Against the door to the infirmary, Snape was leaning heavily. He was massaging the bridge of his immense nose, seemingly forgetting Harry was standing only few feet in front of him. The Gryffindor stepped close enough to lie a hand on his shoulder, showing whatever comfort it might bring.
It had been days since Jason went into a coma state. Blaise didn’t even care what day it was, nor was he sure if he had missed some of his exams. It obviously didn’t matter. Jason’s hadn’t gotten worse since Blaise had joined his side, but he certainly hadn’t grown better.
“We told her the truth!” Ron exploded.
Love, TMB
not believe in purifying magical blood?” Harry hated this type of topic, but one could always hope Malfoy really had changed.
“Well sir, very well indeed! Dobby has gotten a raise to two sickles a month AND two hours off every Sunday!” the proud elf claimed.
“Stalking
“Potter, while you may wish not to listen to me about the nature of Slytherins, you must listen to me when I tell you; I know my godson.”
“You never saw him again?”
“Scarhead.”
“Would you like to turn it?”
“You will.” Harry discreetly leaned in and their warm lips softly touched for a second.
“-That is why he became so obsessed with you from the second you bumped into him. Had you been one-step behind, it would have been the Weasel or Longbottom, whom would have had the pleasure of getting stalked.”
I personally love the scene at the train station, it was really sweet to write.
Suddenly a feeling surrendered Draco and he sat up quickly.
“This is unacceptable. You will end this… tryst, immediately.” What?
“…Thirteen inches.”
While it was fun seeing Potter make an ass of himself, Draco didn’t want to ruin the big step forward their relationship had taken. Leaning in to kiss him, he silenced the dumbass.
“Really? When?” Seamus wondered excitingly.
“There you are!” a deep voice countered him. “Potter! What the hell were you thinking! People have been looking for you since you didn’t show up at dinner!”
Walking out of the infirmary, Harry thanked whoever was listening that Jason was better. Although it didn’t seem like the scars across his face had completely healed yet, it was a huge improvement already.
Remus was grasping his hand hard now and Harry wasn’t sure he was even aware of it.
“Oh really?” Pansy smirked. “So,
“Because we didn’t match, NOT BECAUSE YOU LEFT ME FOR A MAN!”
As Dinner was cleared and dessert had been shared, the orchestra began playing, indicating it was time to dance. Few couples got up to dance at first but soon gathered followers. Harry was not especially eager to dance but found it rather amusing when Jason got up like the perfect gentleman and asked Blaise for a dance. Even though the Slytherin complained and cursed his boyfriend to the moon, all the way to the center of the floor. Hermione also seemed to have had enough of her boyfriend discussing Quidditch through most of the night, and she quickly linked their arms and forced him up to dance as well.
Ron now got up aswell.
“Harry, slow down.” Remus called.
“I’m not sure that is a good idea, Harry.” The werewolf frowned faintly.
“But it might be best for him to see her.” Snape didn’t give any indication what he thought of that.
“This is for you.” The taller boy handed him a small flat present with a blue ribbon and silver lining. “I’m sorry I didn’t send it or give it to you before we left, but with everything…” he let off.
Malfoy fell in steps right beside him.
For a few seconds, Potter didn’t react. He almost looked like he was about to turn around and glare at him, but didn’t move further than a little head shake before he turned back to the note. Draco expected to see the bird unfold but when the boy pointed his wand at it, he certainly wasn’t prepared to see the bird turn to ashes.
“Wait a second, Thomas.” Jason smiled interrupting. “I think it will be best if we simply choose to divide the two houses into equal teams.”
“But it didn’t-“
Malfoy stopped beside him and showed him to lead the way.
“I know a place where we can have privacy.” Harry smirked and took the lead.
Recognizing the kind voice, he turned his head to smile at the newcomer.
loud crash and Jason Melck from Slytherin had practically tackled Malfoy to the ground. They ruined several pots and plants in the fall and Malfoy hit his head I think, because he was unconscious when- hey wait!”
Harry knew that if he tried to move it would spit acid web towards or worse; simply attack and start eating. Never moving his gaze from the long fangs, he carefully tried to move his hand towards his pocket. The clicking sounds of the mouth continued louder, making the hair on his neck rise. The second he felt a good grip around his wand he pulled it out and shouted;
“He can be quit-“
“…Shu up..”
“Oh, why not?”
Sitting up, he felt for his glasses on the table.
again thank you for the reviews, it really makes me happy!
“What now?” Harry asked, looking at the kittling fire, bored.
“Huh?”
“What happened?” Seamus inclined as he comfortingly stroked his back.
Potter moved with him and continued to fold the gentle pressure on his knee as well as on his thigh now. If Potter continued to follow him so easily, Draco wouldn’t even have to do most of the work before Potter would be eating right out of his palms, he expected. Hopefully with his cock in between them.
Confused, Harry turned back to his history partner. Jason could obviously see the confusion on his face as he continued;
“Jason, are you coming?” Astoria’s light voice reached him.
Harry was strolling around the courtyard in his winter clothes. After his first class had ended with divination, he had felt the need for some fresh air. The rest of the class had headed for the great hall and probably the warm halls for recess. Harry didn’t really feel like staying inside. While most of the school had calmed down about the idea of him and Draco, the gatherings in the great hall was harder to ignore, considering the whispering voices travelled far.
Nipping his neck, Jason pulled down on his neckline to continue down Blaise’s chest. When he couldn’t get any further without ripping the jacket apart, he got off him for only a second, before settling just below his belt buckle. Hearing the raised heartbeat and quickened breath, he glanced upwards catching his lover’s gaze.
Mr. Malfoy seemed completely outraged at his son’s refusal. While Mrs. Malfoy was still making sure her son was truly okay, Dumbledore shushed everyone out of the office, only leaving the Malfoys’ and Snape, since it was a ‘family matter’ now.
“Yes we do.” Jason took a cleansing deep breath. “I owe you an explanation for the attack and I might as well tell you how everything happened. I have come to trust you, Harry and I hope my secret is safe with you.” As Jason spoke, Harry felt the penetrating feeling that Jason was seeking truthfulness inside his soul. He only nodded, hoping it was enough to satisfy his interest.
Did he? Harry certainly didn’t.
“Erhm, yes, please.” The curtain carefully opened and Hermione stuck her head out. “I like this one, but I’m not sure if it looks a little… mottled since the purple one I wore last time.”
“Hey, Remus?”
“I never wanted to marry her, Harry. But I didn’t want to hurt her anymore. She was still my friend…”
“…He won’t.”
HP POV
The girl didn’t even spare him a second glance before marching out the hall. Leaving he could see both Blaise and Theo get up as well. Crabbe and Goyle would surely follow as well. They were clearly as curious for his explanation as Pansy was. Hopefully, they wouldn’t throw a hissy fit as big as hers was sure to be. Exiting the hall, the Slytherins headed for the bathroom. The one closest to the hall was for some reason always empty. Perhaps people felt uncomfortable doing their business where they were still able to hear voices coming from the hall.
“I… I haven’t actually thought it through.” Potter answered uneasy.
“Malfoy?” he croaked.
The next few days passed by quickly. The day after Christmas, a horrible snowstorm settled over the castle and the students had been required to stay inside. Since he couldn’t go out to visit Aodhan and Hagrid, Harry chose to focus on Jason. The boy had continued his moody behavior and was very quiet. Most of the time he stayed in the library reading or in the common room staring out the enchanted high window.
-Of course, that made sense. It was simply because Potter was wearing his clothing. Nothing else.
“I’m going to visit Hagrid.”
“Really? It seems like he wants to scratch my eyes out.” Harry hurriedly moved his head aside as a clawed foot felt for his face.
“Where is Mr. Melck?” Snape interrupted.
“Is this really about me making trouble for myself or you worried about you?”
“I’m waiting for him in there. Step aside, now.” He declared.
“I didn’t want everyone to-“
Draco mumbled a thanks, not even sure if that was true.
As the dragon frequently cast a shadow down on him, Harry closed his eyes and enjoyed the slightly warmth from the sun. Aodhan broke a few branches here and there and they fell all around him hitting the ground and bushes. Apparently, a few had landed just behind him before he could hear the sound of something against the ground. But they moved? Weird. Opening his eyes Harry heard a strange clicking sound from behind. Turning around he almost screamed. Behind him, looking rather ready for a light snack, stood a huge Acromantula. Bigger than any dog, it snapped its long pointy fangs towards him.
’God, Potter already looks like a slopping puppy, this will be so easy’, Draco thought.
“Are you alright, love?”
“This isn’t time for your defending Gryffindor hero complex, Potter! Step aside.”
“So, we still have some time,” Neville looked at his watch. “Where do you want to go?”
The idea itself already made a roaring green monster appear in his stomach.
Overbearingly Blaise squeezed his shoulder. “I’m perfectly fine and so are they. Draco is certainly happy.”
Giving a final nod, his father went to the fire pit gathering a handful of powder, waiting for his wife to follow. His mother rose and gave him a single kiss on the cheek before joining Lucius. Together they entered pit and a giant green flame embraced them, sending them back to the manor.
“Boys, how come I cannot see you using your wands, practicing as the others?”
“Hagrid.” He tried again.
If this was what a broken heart truly felt like, Harry hoped he would never love another soul again.
“Luna.” He smiled as the younger witch sat down next to him. “What are you doing here?”
“Thank you.” Harry leaned up to peck him on the lips. “Do you want to come along?”
“Father, I cant just-“
“I’ve never even been outside England before… well, besides when we travel to Hogwarts of course.” Harry tried to laugh off how sad the comment sounded.
But as every other happy moment in Severus’ life, this one had to end.
But sometimes he wished…
In the seventh year’s dorm, the chaos was slightly more subtle. Harry had already changed into his dressrobes and were sitting in front of the mirror, trying to comb his crowsnest into something slightly tame. Seamus, Ron and Neville were only halfdressed as well and for some reason, Ron couldn’t find his only pair of black socks that didn’t have a hole in them.
could have done the job.
“Merlin…” Draco laughed cynical. “Even after months of wishing to see you, and I still don’t know how to start.”
Trying to relax, the potion Professor found his mind concentrating on the smiling face of Lupin. Annoyed by the presence, he opened his eyes again. He refused to be sucked into that catastrophic event once more. Remus had once again left and he weren’t even sure if he had truly understood what had happened the second time before he left. No, the werewolf was already bound to another human being and Severus would never be a priority. He had his own priority now. Teaching the students had been a mediocre task but after years of believing he was alone, he had found out about his son.
a safe topic for them to discuss. Harry believed Malfoy could go the next fifty years without ever mentioning Lord Voldemort’s name or the months he had spent in his presence. Instead of continuing to pick lint, Malfoy’s hand unconsciously pulled his left sleeve further down. Perhaps the fact that Harry mentioned the past would make Malfoy back off.
“He is a Gryffindor. I tell him what he wants to hear and he will be eating out of my palm. The problem will be how to get him away from the weasel and the mudblood.” Draco sneered.
No matter how hard he tried to forget his terrible childhood and pathetic parents, he was actually glad he grew up in a mugglehood, since he understood and remembered most of the things they did and said. Not that he would ever dare to tell a soul in their circles. Unless he wished to be the reason of ridicule for the rest of his service.
“This was nice.” Harry affirmed, as they were once again back in the castle. Malfoy had followed him all the way back to the Gryffindor tower. Thank god, the Fat Lady was sleeping in her chair, resting her head on her hand, leaning on the table.
“Africa?” Harry wondered surprised. “I thought he would go to South America…”
Laughing at Ron’s red face, Fred brought them towards their new item aisle, where Hermione had also found their new love potion. Whilst discussion the dangers of ‘emotional manipulating pranks’, George pulled Harry aside and mentioned for them to go upstairs.
“Look at them!”
“Dean?” Hermione’s voice sounded.
Slowly the classroom emptied, but Snape continued to ignore his presence. He gently swung his wand around the room. Collecting books to his desk, cleaned the chalkboard, and scrubbed a few caldrons before settling down in his own chair. For a long time, neither said a word. The silent stare contest had begun and Draco was quickly trying to strengthen his occlumency incase Snape decided to use a little force of magic to make him talk.
The taller boy simply growled and pushed against him harder and faster. They desperately grabbed each other anywhere they could, as the frotation got deeper. Harry couldn’t contain the air inside his lung any further, gasping he continued to hold on as Draco led him towards heaven. But even though it felt amazing, he couldn’t get there completely. His frustration matched Draco’s growl and gathering what little courage he had right now, he started opening Draco’s belt.  The silver eyes stared at him, seeming as though he would change his mind any second now. Refusing to say anything, he continued to open both of them up until he could see the hardness straining against Draco’s boxers. He was shaking slightly when he too pulled down his flier and let Draco line them up once more. Carefully, he pushed them together for the first time and the warmth that hit Harry was more intense than anything he had felt before. The matching wet spots on their underwear rubbed and it seemed so naughty to Harry that they mixed precome into each other’s.
“I can almost guess for certainly that this student must be our new exchange student from Australia, Mr. Melck.”
“Yeah,” Fred continued. “Beside you have had enough to worry about during your teens so far. Now is the time to shine!”
“No reason.” Harry shrugged. “Was just trying to make small talk, you know, fill the silence?”
“How are your classes going?”
Albus hummed to show he was still listening.
Once again, Severus shook his head. “Honestly, no. We haven’t even brought it up since he told me I was part of the procreation.”
As Harry got into the office, he could already hear Snape ragingly ranting.
“Well, we have already talked it through, Mr. Malfoy and I do not believe young Mr. Malfoy jr. will be pressing any charges, did I understand correctly?” He turned to give the young blond boy a twinkly-eyed look.
Malfoy’s cheeks tinted slightly but he held on to his statement.
“Blaise, tell me.”
She exaggerated a great sigh. “Obviously because I have to tell you something.”
“Kind of a grey Monday, huh?” Seamus looked at the ceiling.
“You’re freezing. Now, hand out.” He ordered. Harry obeyed and felt slightly lightheaded. He had never worn a piece of clothing that belonged to Malfoy. Knowing his fingers were covered by fabric which Malfoy’s hands had been in, was weirdly intimate and a very surprising turn of event. Harry had never seen Malfoy share anything off his, let alone his clothes. After readjusting the gloves a few times – since Harry hands were kind of small for them – Malfoy let him go.
“Hm?” the wolf looked at him over his cup’s rim.
His friends continued trying to distract him as he eat the few apple slices he could. In the end, he gently pushed his plate away from him and just sipped his pumpkinjuice.
“Like what?” Harry asked curiously.
The change was immediate. The girls’ giggling and whispering stopped as they stared at him in surprise. The bold girl’s attitude shook as she quickly stepped to the side, letting him pass. They all followed through and hurried out of his way.
Snape obliviously knew he was perfectly aware of the issue but instead of calling him out on the lie, the professor made the Slytherin choice and left Draco to dig himself even deeper. But the blond knew he had no proof, so if he could just hang on to the lie for next few minutes, he would be off the hook.
“Isn’t it just a little too coincidental that You-know-who is gone and suddenly this Jason guy appear out of nowhere?” Ron leaned back smugly.
“What? It doesn’t- A few Slytherins and Gryffindors.” Severus said, not wishing to go into further detail.
“Wauw. Was anyone hit by a bludger?”
“Exquisite, isn’t it?”
“Yes.” The boy was whispering as well. “He was.”
It didn’t happen often, but this time Severus was deadly wrong. The sweetness was there but hidden inside was a tiny amount of salted caramel that spread across his taste buds. He almost moaned when the powdered sugar laid a small extra vanilla taste on top of it. It was delicious. He took another bigger bite this time and then another. In the end, he had completely forgotten where he was when he sucked a single digit free of sugar.
XXXXX
He wanted to sleep with Harry that night.
"All done?" Harry asked.
Padfoot and Moony.
Leave suggestions!
"You five just do what you need to do to find your staff " Ollivander told us and walked out of the room .
"Here we are little buddy!" Draco smiled at Harry.
Draco crouched down and looked Harry right in the eyes, "Who told you Potter was a bad name, boo boo?"
"To go Trick or Treating!" Draco smiled, he knew it was a fun muggle custom, but didn't care any way.
unblocked
I was surprised when someone came up behind me and started kissing my neck, but quickly turned to see Draco. I started to kiss him while Severus went to my neck. From the both of them I was in a lot of pleasure. I gasped sharply when Severus bit down on my neck and knew that it was to leave a mark on me which I didn't mind, but I knew there was a lot more to come.
Pomfrey had run off protecting Harry.
"Pancakes!" He smiled a and clapped his hands.
"I was under a love potion!!!!" Neville blared and screamed. "I lost my girlfriend, thanks to you!" He pushed the suitcase at him.
He walked up to his dormitory and entered to find Severus Snape snooping around.
Once again this chapter's credit goes to the original author - @ theblobonwallstreet. This is in no way my work.
"No need don' worry I'll keep those Gryffindors off Harry!" He tapped Harry's little nose before looking at Pansy.
"Yes Dumbledore," he said rather lamely. He hated this old goose, something was off about him, he was just insane he was definitely not in his right mind.
"Okay!" He scurried to Draco's room and his under his covers they snuggled and eventually Harry fell asleep.
"Harry what would you like for supper?" Draco asked.
Before I walked up behind Aiden and started kissing him in his neck, I couldn't keep my hands off of him and ran my hands over his bare skin making him moan and turn to face me.
"You wanted it as much as I did!" Blaise continued smirking.
"Draco!!!! You need HELP!!!" Neville cried, at that point they broke down into tears falling asleep next to each other, Harry at some point decided to lie with them.
"Who's uncle Vernon next to the great Potters!" Draco said he didn't like the Potters, but everybody knew they were great people and no one argued with that.
He had, luckily, chosen one of the colder nights and the tower was not inhabited by the usual stray couple or lonesome student. There was no one to bother him in the tower and he found this enjoyable, since all the others had done lately was to bother him, criticize him, watch his every move and whisper about him thinking that he couldn't hear them or didn't care that he could hear them.
Draco quickly tucked Harry in to bed, who tried to refuse to go back to bed, so eventually Draco just let him play in his room. After Draco locked all the doors and windows he finally left and walked to Dumbledore's office.
‘’IN tha cwoset? ‘’Harry tried to tell Draco firmer but ended the statement as a question instead of firm.
"Today we will be testing you, you and a partner must complete a potion with no book or other help," Snape flicked his wand making the classes potions books clear and neatly stack onto his desk.
My Dom's all handsome in their own ways. Their hair were all to their waists and taller than me, that was the same as mine but the color of their eyes were different and I could not wait for them claim me as theirs.
Mr Malfoy turned Mr Potter into a baby during Potions.'' Snape informed the Headmaster, sneering gleefully that it was Draco that made that mistake.
Voldemort as everybody knew by now was still out there or at least his followers were, and this kid just went out and said his forbidden name!
"Pancakes!" Harry clapped his hands together.
Pansy! Hermione smiled.
'' Potter, not only do I find you out of bed past curfew, but I also stumble upon you slicing open your skin with an almost masochistic reverence. If you would indulge, I will not allow you to leave until you have given reason for this inane act,'' The man said, tone aloof and cool, as always.

" He shouted.

Now he needed to see what was up with Pomfrey, he walked in and saw Madam Pomfrey lying on the ground dead.
"Bloodfang do you have my inheritance paper?" I asked him instead of answering he passed the paper to me and I passed it to my two closes mates. When they were reading the paper they almost lost control of their magic.
"I'm fi- fi- fine!" Draco stumbled as he spoke.
"Now let's go to Honeydukes!" Draco said excitedly.
When they went to Madam Pomfrey's all she said was that his back was going to randomly bleed at times and wrapped a large bandage around his back to prevent any further bleeding.
When we all touched our staffs we glowed the color of them and turned to look at each other.
Harry looked up at Draco with his bruised face resisting the urge to pick Harry up and carry him home he sighed and said, "you can have it, boo boo..."
"Draco you better go to Pomfrey's tomorrow!" Neville demanded.
"It was no problem!"
"Yup!" Draco laughed. "But you better get ready for bed now bud."
The trio entered Dumbledore's study and Draco took a seat playing with the baby boy.
"Pansy wake up!!!" She shook her partner up.
/>"Harry..." he said in a warning tone.
"Ya Hawwy newver get trweats at Duwrslwees!"
"Yes! Do you want to hear a story?" He asked the excited boy.
Yes, headmaster, I am sure.'' There was no other way he was sure Snape wouldn't do it and he wouldn't let him be sent back to those people.
I was mad and surprised at all that I had read.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/>One day Draco has to go outside for a moment but that moment was enough for Harry to escape, he wandered around the castle and found himself sitting on the moving staircase as Hermione ran down the stairs and picked up the baby bringing him into the common room.
"Look who it is the faggot and his daddy, I'll show you how to act Potter!"
Frick, not only was he bringing a baby Harry Potter into the dorms, but he was bringing him on the first day of the new semester! And the new year!
Frick, not only was he bringing a baby Harry into the dorms, but he was bringing him in on the first day of the semester! Of the year!
1 H͟O͟U͟R͟ L͟A͟T͟E͟R͟
"When Draco opened the fridge he noticed there was already frozen pancakes there with a flick of his wand he warmed them set them on a plate and added some raspberries on the side.
After everything sunk in and was accepted, I told them to go to Gringotts to get checked for any Potions or Charms. "Hey guys we have to leave," I told them they all got up and took turns hugging me "Go do what you have to do and then came back to us Aiden." My father's told me. After saying goodbye we left and finally went house shopping. We went to Gringott's and asked Bloodfang for help and he said that he could help us. Finding a house a house was hard but worth it and at last we founded the one we wanted.
Harry began to cry letting go of the wand he grabbed the wand and than picked Harry up, "now go to your room I'll tell you when breakfast is ready,"
"Malfoy since you are incapable of keeping attendance you and Potter will be together,"
He grabbed his wand and pointed it at his wrist, " sectumsempra semptra," he said quietly creating a small bleeding cut on his wrist which he quickly hid and finished preparing breakfast.
Harry ran into Draco's arms and was lifted onto a chair.
"If you keep up with that we won't get anything done today" I told them and Aiden moved to greet Tom and I.
(I'm so sorry, I don't have the original author's pictures or know how they look, so I can't tell or show you how they look like.)
Draco mustered up the courage to pick Harry up whisper in his ear, "No Harry they don't," he shot the kids a nasty look before taking off to the eighth year dorms.
"Hey! What type of idiot are you! He is a baby!" Draco yelled growing extremely protective over Harry.
"Ugh... Ummm... No!" Draco stuttered.
She quickly found Pansy sitting around the owls writing a letter.
Harry stampeded out of his room and sat down on the chair with Draco's help.
Pansy studied Hermione's face, all she wanted was Hermione but managed to spit out, "Okay..."
Draco, Severus, Tom and I were sitting in the gardens which had many different type of flowers in it .
"No! I saw you with Blaise! BLAISE! The filthy traitor, this is done!" Pansy cried running to Draco and Harry's dorm.
When Draco and Lucius found out who I was they exploded "I bullied my mate" (Draco) "I tried to kill my mate" (Lucius). They told me how sorry they were while taking my hands in theirs and kissing them. I watched as Severus and Tom read through the parchment and how the suddenly went pale . "You can stop worrying in now, I forgive you for you didn't know," I told them "and you can make it up by buying me more pretty dresses" I finished .
Draco glared over at Harry, Saint Potter!
Soon enough Harry entered back to the class the first thing he did was take a drink of his water...
"Oy!" He yelled, "Malfoy! I have Harry!" Harry was crying into Neville's shoulder.
Then Tom at 6'5, pale and red lips.
"Boys are bitches," Pansy snarled.
"I didn't see?" Draco said, "is there something going on between you two?"
Draco rushes to class cursing under his breath as he enters the potionions class.
"No, I don't think so." Draco said.
Hogsmead? Thought Neville.
"Uncle - Vernon he hurt meeeeee!" Draco was surprised about how clearly he was speaking.
"Block!" Harry whispered to Pansy.
"Lovely, now why don't you go back to your dorm and get some beauty sleep? Looks like you need it!"
"Yes boo maybe we'll get some next weekend?" Draco smiled down at Harry.
Deciding, he stepped up on to the bottom step and climbed his way up to the stairs to the top, eager to catch Potter at something less trivial than wondering about after hours ( though, if nothing else, he would resign himself to taking points for that.)
"So much for taking it slow!" Pansy laughed.
"Yay!" He smiled clinging onto Draco's leg and hugging it tightly.
"So my life is depressing.... I wish I had your life..." he looked at Draco.
"Hello Mr Potter or should I say Mr Lupin," I heard a goblin say from my right . I looked to my right to see a unknown goblin in front of me. "Hello" I greeted the goblin "My name is Bloodfang and I'm the head of Gringotts," Bloodfang explained to me. "Nice to meet you, but can you please explain to me why you keep calling me Mr Lupin?" I asked Bloodfang, instead of answering me he pulled out a dagger,a piece of parchment and a potion. "Cut your finger and drop some blood into the potion, then shake it, last pour it onto the parchment and we will see what and who you are." Bloodfang told me. I did as he told me and waited for something to appear on the parchment.
Harry put his hand over Draco's mouth sometimes when Draco was about to talk Harry told him, "No, no, Dwaco listen to Hawwy I Hawwy you Dwaco wite?" The kid had a strange way of pronouncing things instead of using r's he used w's.
Ah, yes, well Severus then you must simply re - age him!'' Dumbledore said in his scratchy voice to Severus with a bit of glee in his voice.
"So I know you've wanted to be my friend so what do ya say?" Harry pat Draco on the back with no further explanation.
"NO!" Harry giggled.
Harry giggled then put on a much more serious face and whispered in Draco's ear, ‘’ Uncum Verwom .‘’
A room for my friends.
"Thank you!" He said before he could stop himself. He blushed and ran in to get Harry.
, a boy... a boy I had a
"Neville, you got those two sections mixed up," Draco said.
/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-
"Okay...." Harry was very interested in this new idea of Draco.
"Where are we???" She cried.
I was 5'10 and had muscles with pale skin and pink lips, but I couldn't explain my hair and eye color.
I also had pure white cat ears on my head and that is when I felt something brush against my legs and I jumped out of my skin at that and looked to see was it was and saw a matching tail to go with the cat ears that's when I also noticed that I didn't have scars or bruises anywhere and I knew I had to skip my shower and go to Gringotts . I went back to my room and put on a black floor length cloak, pulled up the hood so no one saw my face and grabbed the letter and said the password "fire" and disappeared .
In our letter was written the following:
I awoke with a body on me and looked down to see Lucius there. I moved so I was sitting up and shook Lucius lightly to wake him up. It took a few minutes but he finally woke up.
"No, no, no! Hawwy no eat! Wite Nweville!" Harry saw Neville.
"Me no wanna go two potiowns!" Harry shivered.
He closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the stone wall, his mind calling forth unbidden memories of the countless dreams and fantasies he had detained of his Professor, finally able to relax under the cold stars.
"Welly?" Harry smiled.
Draco was lost in thought at the moment, how could someone he had the hugest crush on; how could he now see him as a son?
We were brought out of our thoughts by a person appearing before us . It was our submissive mate, He was wearing a short dress that fitted him perfectly and a floor length cloak with matching ear rings. He saw our stairs and pulled his cloak over himself.
"To claim your Lord and heir ships, you have to say I your name claim my heir and lordships at this day." I did as Bloodfang told me and 16 rings appeared in front of me and before me they melded together to form one ring, all but four. I put the rings on my ring finger on my left hand.
‘’In the what now?’’ Draco asked the little boy.
In the morning Harry was screaming touching his back and yelling it was in so much pain!
I am sorry that It  had taken me so long to update but it has been a rough few months. As you know I am a babysitter and looking after a two year old toddler, I left my boyfriend on our 3 months anniversary, because he insulted my father and said that i wasn’t trustworthy. Then I am studying and that is also a lot of work.I just found out that two of my sisters boys, both have the Corona virus.
Harry put his hand over Draco's mouth looking around to see if he saw anybody coming, no one was though.
Aiden took our hands and pulled us to the door and opened it. I heard foot steps rushing towards us and I pulled Aiden into my arms to protect him.
I did as my little sub to us to do and saw the houses of #11 and #13 start to move and #12 appear.
"Can we gewt sowme?" He asked.
Draco was unsettled why was he all of the sudden calling him Draco? And to think of it where was weasel bee and mudblood?
On the other hand, there were no other towers that were not fully occupied by either teacher quarters, or student quarters and the Astronomy Tower was the ideal place for anyone to go, whether they intended to pursue sex, stargazing, romance , suicide or simply to have time for themselves, free from the confines of the indoors - since students were no longer allowed on the outdoor grounds with strict adult supervision.
Draco, oh, Draco do you think this is good?
When I sneezed I didn't know what happened or why my mates and everything got a lot bigger. I watched in amusement as they started panicking even using their creatures to look for me , but all of a sudden I felt something on my face and I went cross eyed to see wat was on my face, just to see I have whiskers on my face, I almost started hyperventilating until I remembered my creature inheritances, suddenly I knew I had some how changed into my kitten form.
"Ya! Ya! Ya! I nemer get stowys wed to me in da cwoset!" Harry clapped his hands excitedly.
Lefay
Wiping her forehead she said, "watch the boy if he wakes call for me I need to write a note to the headmaster!"
"Come with me," she took Harry and Draco to a painting with a grassy landscape and she said "Whare Liebe" the painting swung open revealing a beautiful dormitory with a complete common room!
'' Sir, I have nothing to say to you, '' Harry replied, trying and failing to sound as if he were indifferent to what Severus was saying.
"Ah, yes well Severus you must simply re-age him!" Dumbledore said in his scratchy voice.
The two sat beside Neville and Pansy who were reading each others notes.
I'm sorry it took me so long to update but I was sick
Draco went back to his dorm and was the most depressed he had ever been he yelled at the top of his lungs pointing at his arm, "SECTUM SEMPRA!!." and let the blood pour out of him, before bandaging it up and crying himself to sleep.
"No, Neville, I'm fine!" Draco was now crying.
Lupin
Wait.... something's not right, Pansy had her head on HERMIONE'S shoulder.
Draco had asked everyone in the neighbourhood to get candy for the famous Harry Potter.
"Ugh I hate my parents!" Said a drunken Pansy, "how are yours like?"
"Go wild kid!" He smiled going up to the person working there, "if Harry eats anything just tell me I'll pay for it," he winked and chased after Harry.
"Draco, it's very common for children to experience," he paused, "trauma before an aging.. You were aware the aging is tomorrow?"
"Little boy, mind if I lift up your shirt?" Pomfrey asked.
"Ya, know what I'm done with this school!" Blaise stormed away and disappeared for good.
Draco stood up and left muttering under his breath.
"Harry why don't you get ready for bed I'll be there in a minute..." Draco said not paying attention, more worried about Neville than anything.
"Draco!" She took off her mask, "what are you doing here?" She asked nervously.
He withdrew the highly polished piece of metal from his pocket, where he had always hidden it, eyes glinting with the reflected silver edge of the sharp razor. He considered it with a friendly gaze, eyeing every nick and corner with the detail of a lover who looked upon their beloved for the very last time.
"Dwaco!" Harry ran forwards and hugged him tightly. "Pamsy anwd wenville were kwissing!" Harry intimidated kissing.

"Okay but you have to eat some fruit to okay?" Draco told Harry.
"Yewys?" Harry smiled his hands behind his back.
The last owl looked very important and I was very hesitant it open it but I did
"NO! I wan to hawve PANCAKES!" Harry yelled and pouted.
Harry and Draco walks down the cold corridor at around 8, Harry is getting tired but Draco insisted that it's the best time to find Halloween costumes.
"No! It's not!"
"Whatever you say," Neville smiled.
And Lucy had on a purple suit.
"Whatever! What brings you here?" Pansy asked whispering an address in a barn owls ear watching as it takes off.
"No it's not.... My dad has been locked up in Azkaban I am a
"Just at a cafe I know, a great one in Hogsmead!" She smiled.
"Su- su - sure!" He stuttered no matter what he thought of Pansy she was pretty!
Harry scurried over, "upsies! Upsies!"
Neville was off his rocker he just saw his girlfriend, wait was she even his girlfriend anymore? Kiss a traitor.
Harry pulled on his face forcing him to look down to look at him, ‘’Hawwy don wanna meet new scawy people. ‘’ The little boy almost said in tears.
Harry giggled then put on a much more serious face and whispered in Draco's ear, "Uncum Verwom!"
"Well than Draco, if you feel you are up to the task than I see no reason to stop you but, I also see no reason to give you anything special for your actions I would prefer if you were to still keep him in your Slytherin dormitory." Dumbledore winked at Draco.
"Okay, okay, let's read a story get up on my back your gonna have a piggyback ride!" Draco helped Harry get up and than he told Harry stories all the way to the dorms...
Draco, Draco!
I knew the paper was a port key and said the password "Fire" and was wisked away and landed in front of Bloodfang and 4 other people. When I saw the lustful stairs I was getting because of the dress I was wearing, I pulled my cloak over me and blushed.
Severus had on a turquoise suit that brought out his eyes .
When Draco woke up later that morning he was startled to find Harry gone! Where was he but it didn't take long for him to find Harry playing with a Barbie which he ever so carefully placed in a small truck.
"Dwaco, how wong till we finwd the costuwme?" Harry glanced tiredly up at Draco.
"Okay little man," Draco smiled.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What was she thinking! But Hermione knew that was the single most best kiss ever, she had wanted it forever! Her lips were soft and delicate and yet lit her on fire.
"Breakfast is ready!" He called.
As I was pulled into Tom's arms I relaxed in them and took a deep breath to take in his sent. I saw my father's and other family rush to us. I made Tom let go of me and rushed to meet them.
“No, sir.” Harry answered immediately. “Actually, I’ve been a bit… there has been a lot of changes lately and it’s just well, a lot on my mind.”
Snape stood up straight and intimidating as he waited for the last students to sit down. Finally, he waved his wand and chalked words began to appear on the blackboard.
“Erhm, no, not really. Are you okay?” the confused teen considered him.
Again, Harry forced himself to smile and just shook his head, dismissing the boy. Draco smiled and left with the group of boys, heading towards the first-floor corridor. Harry must have looked pathetic, hoping Draco would ask him. He certainly felt so. Maybe he would ask after Christmas. Maybe even before. Christmas vacation hadn’t starting yet, he still had time.
“Alright, I accept.” The two teens shook hands.
Harry was rather quiet too, that morning. He hadn’t heard from Draco all Christmas and it was still a rather sore spot in his heart that he hadn’t gotten anything from him. Not even a simple card.
“Ah!”
“Seriously? Why not? You didn’t do anything.”
“I love you.”
“Mmm…”
“Don’t even dare insult me by playing, boy! This is the second time I catch you involved with Potter. You will explain. NOW.” He sneered.
Dumbledore raised his hands for attention as people calmed down. His cheerful yet strong voice rose.
“Blaise, who is your friend?” Theodore asked, sounding equally as puzzled as Draco felt.
“I know who you are. Or who you were.” Jason mumbled. “I had barely been here one day before the others told me. They told me how you had been a double-crossed spy. Had helped Dumbledore but for years before that you had taken the mark. You willingly followed him, believing his pureblood nonsense, thinking all creatures were beneath you, of course
Sighing, Remus continued. “No. Unfortunately, I can’t blame that on anyone but myself. You might remember that the Marauders and I would stay in the forest while I was under my transformation. I would never remember the time we spent in the forest, since the Wolfsbane hadn’t been invented yet. Then one night, something happened…”
“But don’t expect us to be all buddy-buddy with him!” Seamus intervened, pointing an accusing finger at him.
Fearing his voice had been lost, he gave a slight nod. But it was enough for Lauris who smiled and opened the heavy door. Inside they went straight into the living room which Severus found incredible odd. It was very modest. The walls were painted in a reddish brown, where the couch and low coffee table was in a creamed color. A few houseplants had snuck in and made their way around the room. Some on the worn bookcase, a couple on the mantle and a single lily stood out on the small table in the middle of the room.
What curse could possibly how caused such damage? Blaise had heard of potions and hexes that could turn you to complete stone, some that turned you to porcelain but never had he seen one that broke your body as IF it was made of porcelain.
Harry waved his hand; “Long story, will tell you later.”
“And?” Draco acquired.
How could his son possibly believe he was ashamed of him, when in fact the truth was quite the opposite? Jason was not only rather remarkable in schoolwork, no he also had an astounding easy way of gaining friends as well. Something Severus had envied people through most of his childhood. Every conversation with new people had left him stumped and shy, after his own father had beaten the shit out of him at every chance he got. After this continued for years, Severus had learned quickly to remain unheard.
“Oh, well I don’t know how to start it, really.” Dean thought hard. “It just sort of happens. You kiss for a while, then you just feel ready to go further and further until you are naked. Then suddenly you are just following the other persons want and needs, making sure they feel comfortable. Then it happens.”
The first time Harry released a gasp of air, Draco pulled back and leaned against him. They kept their arms around each other as their breaths returned to normal.  “I feel I should apologies for the way I acted last time we spoke. And I do, feel sorry, you know.”  Well, it wasn’t the best apology Harry had ever gotten, but they were together and right now his head wasn’t really in control.
Harry wondered if he should say no. Being out alone after hour, meeting Malfoy, sounded like trouble. If it was some sort of set up, he could be facing a group of Slytherins, caught of guard. On the other hand, he was quite curious as to what Malfoy wanted.
“Don’t tell anyone I was the one to tell you Potter, okay?”
Harry knew it was his que to leave but he stayed in the chair. Upon realizing the bane of his existence didn’t depart, Snape looked up from his notes.
“I will speak with Mr. Parkinson in private when we come home. ‘this’ little nonsense will only be tolerated this once, Draco. If ‘things’ change, you will pick up the marriage arrangement as if nothing have ever happened, do I make myself clear?”
tried to be friends with anyone?”
The teen didn’t answer but continued to drag him along. It wasn’t much further before he was pushed into a darkened room, most likely a broom closet. Blinking furiously, Harry tried to get used to the dark and focused on the pale face standing in front of him.
About thirty pages into the book, he had summoned a glass of red wine. Who would care it was only nine in the morning? A good book always needed creative juices. Both for reading and writing. Turning another page, a knock on his door interrupted him. He hid the book under the felt pillow and straightened his robes before going to open it. At the last second, he turned and waved a hand, sending the glass of wine into the small kitchen.
Knott had given him an older looking book on vexillology and heraldic in the magic world. Not exactly, a fun present but it would be rather useful in History of Magic. Especially, to catch a few cheap extra points in their assignments. Blaise had bought him a few new shirts from the muggle brand Ralph Lauren, Goyle and Crabbe had both bought him sweets he didn’t like –probably hoping he would take it back to Hogwarts so they could eat it themselves.
“No offense, my love, but you haven’t exactly proved me wrong.” Jason emphasized by giving the smaller boy a squeeze. Blaise merely huffed in response. The rest of the trip was mostly silenced, but it was comfortable. While he sometimes missed the more carefree personality Blaise had had on his vacation back in Australia, Jason was certain it would return once they were done with school. If they ever got to that…
“Serpent, Snake, pureblood.”
“It will keep your bones and skin from breaking under the transformation.”
“But now, you are with him.” he said cheerfully. “Which means he must generally care for you. I’m sure whatever was in the past, is no more. Besides, it was a very different time all those years ago. Nowadays, people seem less worried about status, blood and such nonsense.”
“Tell me, Potter.” Draco continued to push harshly against him. “How much do you want it?”
And now the Slytherins all knew.
“Madam Pomphrey, if you please.” Dumbledore waved a hand towards Malfoy.
He needed a plan…
It had been quite scary to sneak the dragon out as he rarely came out within daytime and never without Hagrid. Harry knew it was a big risk to take, but everyone was inside the castle for now, preparing for tonight. Besides, Aodhan could barely fly for more than a few minutes yet, therefor he would never be able to escape further then Harry could catch him with an
Slowly the larger hands on either side of him was removed and Jason just fell back against the bookcase to the right. He rubbed his eyes, tired and angry.
The Professor’s face didn’t change for a second at the mention of the Marauder. He simply continued to drink his tea and Harry saw it as a good sign to keep talking.
The second the word left his mouth, he thought he was screwed. The narrow pink lips on his classmate tightened even further as she obviously tried to keep her temper in check.
“I see. I swear I won’t tell, Hagrid but are you sure this is a good idea?”
“Now now, Harry.” George put on his mocking older brother face. “We want you to have fun-“
Finally, the train had come to a stop and the students departed. A lot of their friends and some he barely knew by name, waved hello. Many students also ignored him, but he tried to focus on the friendly faces he had missed during the Holiday.
“I love you too.”
“Severus, good morning!”
I’m leaving a cliff hanger, I know! So annoying! I would love it if anyone left me a review.
“If you, let’s say, suddenly found someone else, I promise I will back down.”
After all, no matter what Dumbledore said, the reporters always found a way inside or even sometimes bribed students into taking pictures for them.
“Fine.” Malfoy sighed. “Can’t believe I’m doing this…” he grumbled.
“Harry?”
“Come on, it will be fun.” Jason begged. “Please Harry, we could invite some of Blaise’s and my friends, and you invite the Gryffindors. It will be a fun way to spend this cold afternoon, pleaaaase?” The hurt puppy look was back and Harry finally caved.
“I swear, Harry, I have never heard anyone speak of this. Malfoy had never really seemed to be a considerate person, but I didn’t want to say anything. Didn’t want to make something weird between us…”
“What is that supposed to mean?”
While the boys each described the great and awkward moments with their many family members, Harry discreetly looked around at the other groups of students heading for Hogwarts. He had hoped to catch a glint of Draco, at least before dinner. He really wasn’t in the mood to start the second semester by being in a kind-of-fight. A dreadful dark cloud settled over him as he grabbed by a stray thought. ‘What if Draco couldn’t really be bothered to be with him any longer?’
“I said I was sorry. If you hadn’t lead me on-“
Starting to recognize the accent and way-too-happy morning attitude, Harry barely had to turn before answering;
The awkward silence went on for some time.
DM POV
Again, had it been any other day, Harry would have gotten mad and defended his teammates, but Malfoy’s comment didn’t seem to have cruel intentions as they usually did. Harry decided to keep mocking him.
“Yes, sir.” Harry took another deep breath. “I heard Malfoy got attacked in Herbology.”
“Where is he? Where is the boy who attacked my son?!” Lucius Malfoy demanded to know.
“Yeah, I heard it. But it was never ‘real’. Wasn’t it just something your parents had discussed. Beside Draco has already told his parents ‘no’.”
“Yes, well, I might have been willingly helping Potter loosen some knots.” He kept staring ahead, refusing to see the satisfying smirk on Theo’s face.
“Was that actually a compliment from THE Draco Malfoy?” Harry teased and raised his eyebrows dramatically high. Malfoy snorted.
“No, sir. He was awake and Dobby brought him dinner. Then he slept again, he did.”
They had both noticed Malfoy’s hesitation at the mentioning of his father.
“Of all the thoughtless and reckless ideas you have had over the years, this has by far been the most idiotic.” Then the blackcloaked man stormed back into the office, slamming the door behind him. Harry stomach churned. Hagrid was in trouble but so was he. Harry should never have promised to help Hagrid with Aodhan. He should have remembered how many times the giant had brought him, his friends and himself in danger by giving a creature too much humanizing. No matter how badly Harry wanted to defend his fourlegged friend he had to remember Aodhan was a wild creature and the larger he got, the more danger he brought along.  What was to happen to him? Would he finally be expelled? Would Hagrid be fired? What would happen to Aodhan?  God, Harry wished he wasn’t sitting out here alone. Right now, of all the people he wished was with him, Draco was the only candidate that probably wouldn’t yell at him.
“Well, normally I would have said Potter, but since I heard the rumors that he might not even be going, I’m not really sure who you mean.” Seeing the dimwitted surprised look on his face was enough for Blaise to smirk in victory.
Chuckling painfully, Jason disregarded his theory. “ ‘wasn’t cursed and even then, it came quickly while we weren’t… speaking.”
“Move.” Harry panted.
“So, what I wanted to say was…” god, how could this become more awkward? “I really care about you, a lot, so I think… I love you.”
Apparently, today was an extra special day. Severus had barely gotten to the crypt entrance before stumbling into Potter and Draco. Standing a bit close for the usual enemies, Severus tried to analyze the situation. Neither boy looked angry or hurt so perhaps Severus could avoid the inevitable.
“Well, it was fun while it lasted.” Jason tried to lift the mood. “Maybe next time-“
He knew that at some point he would have to face the music. How long would he have left before everyone knew?
“Maybe you should wait up half an hour more, you know, to make sure you fall to sleep as soon as you get in bed.” Seamus suggested, eating the other half of his bagel.
Everyone in the great hall immediately began whispering amongst each other. Hissing quick ideas of clothing and partners.
Heading outside for Care of Magical Creatures, Harry tried to push the worry behind him. He was unsure why Snape had only kept Draco and not the both of them, considering they had both been… kissing. Just thinking about it gave him a tremendous need for smiling.
“Considering I have made myself quite clear on the matter of us ‘talking’ you cannot be surprised.”
He had done many worthnamemy-stuff for the Dark Lord! He had even been directly spoken to, a few times in the Malfoy manor. By this rate, he wouldn’t gain any true power or trust in the Dark Lord before his late forties, how pathetic!
“You have mousse on your cheek.” He smirked. “How embarrassing.”
“I can’t wait to see what you think of the decorations!” Hermione cheered as she pulled her boyfriend down the stairs.
“Nothing particularly. We just discussed the final events of the summer.” Harry responded.
“Except following you around and appearing no matter where you go; Don’t think I haven’t noticed!” Ron challenged.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was almost comically how the entire group turned around at the same time, seeing a rather angry potion Professor standing behind them. His arms crossed, Snape looked far from amused at the sight of the giant battlefield occupying the pitch. Harry could practically point out the popping vein on his forehead growing. Harry discreetly looked to his left where Jason was, and he could clearly see the discomforting look across his face.
“Draco.”
“I have gotten the opportunity to once again, join the faculty and I have gratefully accepted.”
“Watch this!” Seamus picked up a small square package and for a second Harry’s heart stopped beating at the fear of Seamus having seen what the twins had handed him. Thankfully, this tiny package was a cube and inside was a tiny white light. Opening it, Seamus explained.
Severus took a deep breath before confirming the Headmaster’s theory. He told the Headmaster shortly, without too many details of his relationship with Jason’s father. However short-lasted, he had truly come to care for the man.
“Don’t worry I haven’t bought anything for you either. Sorry.” He chuckled nervously.
“He wasn’t like that when I met him. He was more open. He had a great sense of humor and he was just… happier, I guess.”
Getting up and shaking his legs, Harry turned to get ready for the fight. He picked up a snowball for each hand, making sure he wasn’t too far away from one of the piles. His teammates, including Sandra, Knott, Hermione and Dean got ready to fight. As the few second left ran out, the other team charged forward running towards them. Harry dodges the first flying pairs easily, thanking himself for his practiced reflections. Throwing on the other hand, weren’t exactly his strong side.
“Hey!” Ron yelled, already fisting his hands ready to defend Hermione.
“Did Snape do something to you?” he questioned carefully.
“Winky!” he called into the empty space. Immediately after, an apparition pop sounded and the small female elf was standing in front of him, holding onto her stained gown.
Well that wasn’t much to work with, but Harry was very aware of how self-protective the Slytherin could be. They believed any given information, could be used against them somehow.
“I’m not surprised. He’s one of the smartest in Slytherin.” Jason tried to kiss the top of the boy’s head but was harshly rejected.
Trying to keep his clenched hands hidden around his backpack, he regarded his childhood nemesis.
“Probably a little… but maybe we could go alone for a week and then you’ll get to leave a day before they arrive.”
He was handsome, intelligent and a great fortune.
“I think he is going to be alright.” Harry said with certainty.
“Potter? What do you want?” A girl with curly black hair asked suspiciously.
“Uh is that an early present for our savior?” Seamus teased. The rest of his friends looked as well as Harry quickly moved the present out of Seamus’ reach.
“We win!” One of the girls on Harry’s team yelled.
“Good. Just not me then.”
It certainly helped when Malfoy and Harry took the stage and instantly attracted some of the attention. Speaking of which…
“Madam Pomphrey thinks it’s a matter of time.” Malfoy turned back to look at him. “I’m just glad you are okay now.”
“Close, but not quite. Veela. Part veela, at least.” He stared rather intensely at Harry now, probably to seek a response.
“There are not many options left. Either he will reconcile with Mr. Zabini. Even if he does now, it isn’t even certain he will get better, it will simply just stop the progress…. or he continues to crack until… until he fades into dust.”
“You were wrong?! Are seriously even listening to yourself? Were the hell is the proud pureblood whom I lived with?!”
“And did you?” He whispered. “Get to say goodbye?”
“You got to be kidding?” He almost shrilled.
“Oh, no. Draco I really can’t-“
But it wasn’t. In just a few hours everything had crumbled around him. Life had finally started to make sense, he could see a light at the end of the tunnel, had even travelled through the tunnel. But now, he was back in the dark, without any way to see the bright light that once were.
“Zabini? What are you doing here?”
In this, the Slytherins will have a confrontation and whos’ side will you be on?
Draco made an acknowledging sound and continued to ram his prostate with a perfect curled finger. Harry continued to trash on the bed, holding the silky covers tightly in his fists.
“I will see him again one day.” Jason finally looked at him. Harry just nodded. He had never truly considered if he believed in the ‘next’ world. Dumbledore often spoke of death as the next great adventure, and while Harry didn’t fear death, he didn’t have a clear idea of what he thought it was like, either.
“Good.” Jason led him towards the edge of the small town. “Because I don’t.”
“I wouldn’t have lasted long in the war if a Gryffindor could fool me into persuasion.”
“No, Jay, don’t leave me! Don’t leave me alone!” The desperate frantic voice almost became sonic as Blaise wracked his brain for an idea.
Harry almost chocked on his mouthful. “Well, I just… danced a lot last night.”
Annoying, over-the-top, Potter and his crazy, pathetic… absolutely perfect gift…
“-Even then,” Harry took a calming breath. “I’m not going anywhere.”
Zabini ignored him and turned to read his own book. The silence that filled out between the two students felt greater than when Harry was alone. He realized it was the first time he and Zabini had been alone together and he wasn’t even sure why he had sat down in front of him. But Slytherins were proud creatures and Harry thought it was best not to ask. Instead, he thought about what he and Professor Dumbledore had been discussing.
Dean had yelled at him more than once to slow down, and before he could yell again, Seamus had slipped and sat with a rather hurt puppy look, as he got no kisses for his pain.
“Albus, do you remember the year before I came to you?”
Smirking, the blond boy started kissing down his neck. The desperate need to feel him was getting to him and he sucked hard enough to leave a bruise. Harry hissed in a mix of pleasure and pain as Draco moved further down over his chest. Draco flicked a pink nipple and watched it harden underneath his gaze. Tweaking them both at the same time, Draco listened to the moans dropping from the innocent lips of his boyfriend.
“Don’t. I should apologies. I shouldn’t have gotten ahead of myself.”
HP POV
In his sleep deprived state it took a few minutes before Harry realized what Hagrid was trying to tell him.  Looking towards the teachers’ table, he noticed Hagrid’s absent. Quickly he swung his feet over the bench, ready to leave.
Harry snorted. “I bet the man wasn’t exactly fine with being turned to a monster-looking death creature. Perhaps he would rather had remained dead, had she thought of that?”
“Would you know anything about unicorns?”
“Bring it, Ferret.”
Looking back from where they watched her leave, Theodore turned to Draco. “You better make sure this won’t become a problem.”
“So?”
Then he quietly exited and closed the door behind him.
“Oh Merlin, Potter!” He must have hit a sore spot, because her pale cheeks tinted red.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I see.”
Harry had been staring at the roaring fire for almost forty minutes now without moving an inch. Hermione had already been after him twice since he hadn’t opened his book to get any studying done. But right now, he knew it wouldn’t matter. Even if he opened his textbook, he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on anything. All he wanted was to be with Hagrid and Aodhan. Or at least with Draco. He wouldn’t be able to leave the Gryffindor tower for another thirty minutes and he was getting restless.  The worst part was he couldn’t even tell his friends why he was so upset since no one was allowed to know of Aodhan’s existence.  Eventually the last of his housemates had gone to bed and he fished out his cloak from beneath the sofa cushion where he had hidden it.
way to spend your time, I suggest you find something else to amuse yourself with, am I to be understood?”
“I do not know, Potter. Your father and I barely spoke more than a few sentences across seven years unless you count hexes. But I do believe if you get the chance, you could acquire Lupin. He would know for sure.”
“I see.” Knott seemed lost in thoughts before opening up. “While Granger mostly tend to the Scandinavian runes such as stories or myths, I prefer to translate the more graphic and mathematical terms from Greece and Italy-“
For the rest of the long trip the boys discussed their upcoming last year at Hogwarts. Now that Voldemort was gone for good, maybe this year, Harry would be able to focus on his studies and slowly getting through the grief of his godfather’s death. At some point, Hermione and Ron joined them, and since Hermione had been to France with her parents this summer -once again- she could mostly lead the conversation.
The giant ignored him for a while as he grabbed a plate of what Harry assumed was Scottish dream cookies.  Although the color was slightly darker.
The intelligent girl simply made an understanding sound and continued her work. As soon as she was able to brush it entirely without any tangles, she left the brush on the mirror and took out her wand. Lightly, she pulled it through his sides and his hair gently laid down by the side, but kept the volume.
"I'm not sure Granger must've made some sort of potion I would assume...." Pomfrey looked paler than ever.
‘’ What do you bloody mean Potter is a bad name, it’s yours!’’
"Ok let's go Harry," he picked up Harry who snuggled into his neck and they left for Hogsmead.
I jumped into my father's arms. "Siri, Remy." I wispered as I hugged the life out of them. "Harry we can't breath," Remy told me . I blushed and stepped back. "Sorry" I said to them. "Oh, I came here for a reason and I need to do some things today" I told them. "Okay, pup but why are Snape ,The Malfoy's, and an unknown person doing here?" Siri growled out. I laughed nervously "It's a long story" I told them. "We have time" they said at the same time."We'll can I have all The Weasley's but not Ginny and Mrs Weasley, the Headmaster , any other teachers here and that is it, to the kitchen." I said to them and all of these people went to the kitchen. "Why not us?" The people that names weren't mentioned asked me. "Because, I don't need you" I said and pulled my mates to the kitchen and closed the door behind me and put up a lot of spells and charms so no one could break them or try to eavesdrop. "What's wrong Harry" Mr. Weasley asked. I went over to him and hugged him and he hugged me back. Then I told them all about what happened to me and who I really am.
Draco cleared his throat and said "Headmaster Dumbledore, I really do not think that's a good idea I mean-"
"Harry, for the last time! We are not going to the ghost's party!" Draco cried at Harry.
Harry became sleepy and fell asleep on the floor.
"Professor?!" Draco said startled.
"Your mate will be here momentarily" the goblin said after seeing them in his office.
I was doing the list of chores, my not so loving aunt and uncle left me, all I had left to do was dinner, I was going to make spicy garlic lime chicken. I got everything I needed to do so with and started cooking, I was almost finished when my drunk uncle came in "BOY MADE YOU ME LOSE MY JOB CAUSE OF YOUR FREAKINESS" uncle Vernon roared at me causing me to back away as far and fast as possible from him and started pleading for him to stop but he kept advancing on me "please, stop, Uncle Vernon, I didn't do anything, please, stop" I said with tears in my eyes but he didn't listen to me and caught up with me and ripped the old ripped shirt off of me and took his belt off "make a sound and you will get 20 more blows" my uncle said, before I could answer he brought the belt down on my back landing 10 quick blows. I bit down on my tong to stop myself from making any noises and hoped it worked my uncle stopped, when he reached 60 and dragged me to my room threw me in and left me there .
"Draco!!" Neville was astonished!
Draco crouched down and looked Harry right in his eyes, ‘’ Who told you Potter was a bad name, love? ‘’
‘’ Ya! Ya! Ya! I nemew get stowwys wed to me inda cwoset
"No you don't..." he sighed.
"Oh, shit! We need to get ready," Draco picked up the baby and placed him in a chair, "what would you like for breakfast boo boo?" He asked.
I was confused after the letter but went to go take a shower, when I passed by the floor length mirror I saw a flash of purple and turned to look back what I saw shocked me. I grew to 5'3 and my eyes changed to the brightest blue I had ever seen.
"Hello Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy," Snape snarled.
"Now let's get down to Madam Pomfreys, okay Harry?" Draco held out his hand but instead Harry just jumped up on to his neck and clung to him.
"Why?" Harry asked.
Draco walked over to Neville, "Neville what's wrong?! I hate seeing you like this!" Draco said looking at Neville sincerely.
As he reached their dorm and entered he saw Pansy and Neville snogging, as Harry looked at them strangely.
Dear Prongslet
All was fine.
(See the end of the chapter for
The three whispered and occasionally looked down at Harry.
‘’ Yes, do you want to hear a story? ‘’ He asked the excited boy.
"Sorry boo boo that's all I have, right now it's 7:00 why don't we watch a movie and get ready for bed okay?" Draco asked.
"Get the mother ducking hell out!" He screamed at Ron who just backed off.
We were all too tired to give a tour, but they said it would not matter any way cause the next few days we were going house hunting. Together we fell asleep peacefully.
"Harry, why did you draw Vo- vol- volde- mort?" Draco cringed and looked down at his dark Mark him and his family so despised.
"Sure I'll play, but than we have to leave to go get you some clothes.
She sat crying at a round table, when she saw Hermione walking over to her crying as well.
Potter turned and set upon the next flight of stairs. He was quick to follow, staying in the shadows as he had done so many times before, on so many  of the same nights, following exactly this one person. ( Severus knew that it was stalking, but he just wanted to know what this boy was up to and what he was doing.) He could do this in his sleep, he was quite sure, but stayed cautious from fear of becoming presumptuous. He did not yet wish to miscalculate and reveal his presence to the boy he was following.
"I fuckin hate you, Neville!" Pansy screamed.
The password is 'submissive'.
DUMB OLD MAN, he knew that the Slytherins hated Harry Potter and now him as well. They would never welcome a traitor and a Gryffindor into the dorms nor would they treat them better because Harry is now an adorable toddler. He almost wondered what did the old man take or sucked to make him think the Slytherins would help him and welcome them.
I was brought out of my thoughts by arms wrapping around me. I looked down and saw Aiden, he was already dressed in some clothes, no one but us should be seeing him in with his skin showing like that.
"Oh sweetie," Hermione said, she pushed back a piece of Pansy's hair.
So they prepared for bed and harry was fast asleep by 7:45 which had become his bedtime.
Sirius Orion Black (father)
When he saw who had entered and most likely witnessed his bloodshed he had made of himself, he nearly threw himself over the side of the wall to kill himself.
Ravenclaw
The kids finished singing and looked down at the floor where little Harry was clinging onto Draco for dear life!
What the--.
I was surprised and confused when I came into my inheritance on my 17th birthday and that same day I found two of my mates, Lucius and Tom. They loved me with every fault and I loved them back.
"I am half Neko and I'm a half Angle of Darkness," I answered instead of Bloodfang.
Three offices, one for each of my older mates, Tom, Lucy and Sevy.
Draco rushed down the stairs surprised at how fast that little child could run picked him up and ran back to the dorms. Draco began giving Harry a little talking to nothing harsh just a few rules he didn't even notice Pansy scrambling after them.
I knew I was blushing madly when Severus said that to me, I couldn't make the blush go away. I felt him chuckle and put 2 fingers under my chin to make me look into his pretty onix eyes.
"No me to scwaed!" Harry looked terrified.
The next morning he chugged a glass of water down and changed into some respectable clothing and than hurried down to the hospital wing.
"Draco I assume you got a new dormitory how is it?" Pomfrey asked.
"Oh god, what have I done?" Draco sighed.
Harry hopped off the chair and disappeared for a moment returning with some tight jeans and T-shirt.
Draco was beginning to think Harry was making him notice the little things in life, well worth seeing.
"No!" Harry pouted.
Riddle
"They don't remember me.... I had to obliviate them before the war....
"Upsies!" He laughed.
Harry just laughed.
"What a cute scar face you are," he smiled and went off to think about the night.
As he sat in his room a knocking came on his door.
When I landed in Gringotts, I stumbled a little before catching myself on one of the chairs in the room.
Pomfrey lifted the shirt revealing burns and scabs it was not pleasant.
"Okay, Hawwy, wanna be 5!" Harry ran around the house pretending to be super man, "you said super man stay up thwis wate!"
‘’ Weally? ‘’ Harry asked, his big, green eyes twinkled with excitement.
"Newville is hewre!!" He smiled.
Draco sighed whispering the Password "Pech gut," and the painting swung open revealing what looked to be the entire Slytherins all forming a circle around Draco, singing:
They all answered "yes" at the same time.
"Oh no!" Pansy looked guilty, "I'm sorry I shouldn't have brought it up..."
I was brought out of my thoughts by arms wrapping around me. I looked down and saw Aiden, he was already dressed in some clothes, no one but us should be seeing him in with his skin showing like that.
Early the next morning Hermione woke up to a little spoon, next to Pansy, they were fully dressed ᵀᴴᴬᴺᴷ ᴳᴼᴰ she thought, she didn't know if she was ready for THAT yet...
I turned to look at the clock, but I felt a rush of pain on the top of my head and my back before I blacked out.
Hermione walked forwards bending down at the tots size, "Don't listen to Ron little boy... Here take this popsicle it's a great flavour!"
"Professor this is a misunderstanding!" Draco sputtered.
"What do we have here?" He asked with a chuckle looking down at Harry.
She ran off.
From Bloodfang
"Yeah, Neville?" Draco replied pretty damn focused on the movie.
Oh what have you done?
"Dwaco!" Harry hugged Draco's leg.
With that we love you again.
A living room.
I woke up in my father's arms, I  knew that Aiden was back in his human form. I stretched in my father's arms and sat up. It was only him and Tom left in bed with me. They started moving towards each other seeking warmth and soon Tom was holding my father.
A huge Pool and a deck.
"Get on that chicken costume!" Harry laughed and came out wearing a chicken costume which fit just right.
Draco sat quietly in his room, why did Bellatrix... Shoot? Me? Pomfrey? Why? It just seemed so STRANGE and OUT OF THE ORDINARY for her, but then again it was Bellatrix.
Half Angel of Darkness
"Yes did you look back any further?" He asked.
Well then Draco, if you are sure that you are up to the task then I see no reason to stop you, but , I also see no reasons to give you anything special for your actions. I would prefer it for you to still keep him in your Slytherin is Dormitory.'' Dumbledore winked at Draco.
"Whatever is the problem Malfoy?" Snape said in his deep monotone voice.
I was excited that our mate came into his inheritance. I hope it's our submissive so I can spoil him with gifts and my love .
! ‘’ Harry clapped his little hands excitedly.
ɪ ᴋɴᴏᴡ ᴛʜɪs, ɪ ᴋɴᴏᴡ ᴛʜɪs! He thought to himself, Harry just needed a sleeping draught but Draco needed to make one, so he quickly grabbed the stuff he thought he needed and began to mix them sweating furiously and trying to block out Harry's wailing finally he took a big spoon full of the draught and forced Harry to swallow it he fell right asleep.
"Yah!!!" Harry laughed.
Dumbledore
Draco noticed Harry didn't seemed dazed at all his friends stopped talking to him... How long had he been lonely? Draco started feeling bad for the tan boy.. ɴᴏ! ɴᴏᴛ ʜɪᴍ!!! ɪ ᴡɪʟʟ ɴᴏᴛ ғᴇᴇʟ ʙᴀᴅ ғᴏʀ ᴛʜᴇ ʙᴏʏ ᴡʜᴏ ʀᴜɪɴᴇᴅ ᴍʏ ʟɪғᴇ!!!! Draco smirked that was a good name for him! Draco shook out of his thoughts and said, "umm, okay well we need" they began barging in and out of the supplies closet eventually creating a practically perfect de-aging potion, when they had finished the very last ingredient a very fine liquid was created which they poured into a small vial and placed onto the table.
"Well you came right in time a minute later we might of lost him!" Pomfrey added.
P.S you will get your gift tonight.
"Actually we didn't get one..."
I awoke with a body on me and looked down to see Lucius there. I moved so I was sitting up and shook Lucius lightly to wake him up. It took a few minutes but he finally woke up.
He had known, of course, that the homophobia ranged far and wide in the wizarding world, as it was in the muggle realm as well.
"In da cwoset?" Harry told Draco firmer.
Hermione cackled and ran off with Ron who were clearly best friends.
Harry on the other hand kept smiling at Draco either because Snape had shown favour in him or something.... Else.... Draco quickly shook the thought off of him but kept on thinking ᴡʜᴀᴛ ᴀ ғʀᴇᴀᴋ ᴡʜᴀᴛ ɪs ʜᴇ ᴛʜɪɴᴋɪɴɢ?
''Sir,'' Harry said shakily, looking up at Severus as the man glared down at him with his known sneer.
Pansy knew it must be just a friendly gesture, but she was still resisting feeling the place where Hermione's hand had just been.
"Hey, Draco looks like you need a night off why don't we take him for the night?" Neville asked.
A joining dinning Area.
They made their way out of Hogwarts in to the colder late night air, eighth years laughed as they made their way down to restaurants and bars, while Draco gloomily watched on kind of wishing he was one of them.
ᵂᴱ ᴹᵁˢᵀ ᵀᴬᴷᴱ ᵀᴴᴵˢ ˢᴸᴼᵂ...
Harry put his hands back over Draco’s mouth and looked around them to see if anyone was coming, but no one was coming and the little boy let out a sigh of relief.
The entire class looked over at the small boy.
"I think Harry," he paused this was going to sound so weird, "I think Harry was raped," Draco gasped for breath.
"It's just that.... We'll first of all Blaise and me... Well we.... we had sex," Neville looked at Draco who was clearly stunned, "I mean I was under a love potion, but it felt right? Like I wanted it? It all sounds so wrong! Than Pansy broke up with me, and she's dating Granger!"
"Yay!" Harry rushed to a big red house ringing the doorbell.
"Ya! Ya! Ya!" Harry clapped his hands running in circles around the Malfoy.
“Malfoy, what the hell?”
He breathed in deeply before covering the head with his mouth. He moved up and down a few times and it actually felt good to watch Draco gasping on the bed. That was before the blond suddenly hissed in pain and gently grabbed his head.
Sighing greatly, the professor composed himself and the two men continued their walk in silence. As they approached the dungeon, Snape stopped.
HP POV
It felt incredible. It was a feeling he never wanted to end. While his throat felt dry, eyes wet and his entire body was covered in sweat, no other experience could possibly compare. As Draco’s movements became faster and harder, Harry didn’t feel close enough to the man behind him.
Shrugging the blond changed the subject. “I know we haven’t exactly had plans to go together but I wanted to tell you now that I’m going to Hogsmeade with my friends next time.”
The loud snort was very unbecoming and Blaise wrinkled his nose in distaste. Jason was never rude to show such mannerism.
“Do not mistake, Harry.” Dumbledore lifted a hand, showing him to listen. “I simply realized the letter was from you because Hedwig was the one to deliver it.”
“It will just take a second.” Harry stepped back to take three rounds of walking in front of the stonewall. Draco looked very unimpressed.
Arriving home, the gang went to their dorm room to put their stuff away. Harry directly went to the bathroom to get ready for bed. His new robes were hanging on the wall, clean and pressed by the elves. Brushing thoroughly he wondered about tomorrow night. Fred and George had obviously been teasing him, but there was some truth to it. Many couples expected balls or proms to be the night where the magic happened. Was Draco anticipating this as well? Did Harry?
Snape didn’t give him any regard except a short nod. Deeming himself ready Harry moved his focus to the pale face of his friend.
“Where are you going?” Ron asked rather suspiciously.
Hagrid was the first man whom had ever shown him he was normal and had ever spoken to him as though he was worth more than dirt. If it wasn’t for him, Harry would never have gotten to the magical world. He valued his tall friend and truthfully, was rather concerned he wouldn’t approve. Considering how Malfoy had tried- and in another time succeeded- killing Buckbeak.
“Yes, it has certainly been preventing us from having more than one round of sex since it affects his-“
Quidditch seemed to be the only safe topic for them to discuss.
“Let’s just say; they never missed an opportunity to remind me how unwanted I was.” Harry stated with a morbid smile. There were still times were Harry felt unwanted and wished they could understand how their treatment had sculptured his life and behavior. But he kept reminding himself that in one year he would never have to go back.
The professor looked at him intensely. Finally placing his hands on the table in a thoughtful manner, he asked again.
. Pushing others down to break our own fall-“
“When can you bond?”
. Your mother told me; ‘Give him some time. Any day now he will change.’ But you aren’t.”
Carefully opening the door, he hurried in but kept by the door in case Snape asked him to leave again. Sitting by his desk writing, the older man looked up. The long black hair tucked back behind his eyes in a small ponytail.
Seeing Harry crying was quite a shock for her. Hermione hadn’t really ever been present when Harry cried. Not without Mrs. Weasley or Remus present. For the first time she was the sole care whom would have to comfort him. Emotions weren’t the most practical subject and she had always been more comfortable around boys for that exact reason. They rarely showed too much beside anger or happiness. It was easier to deal with. Especially since her boyfriend had the same amount of emotions as a teaspoon. Hungry, happy or annoyed. There was no in-between. Reminding herself of the comfort she had gotten from her mother when she was a child, she laid a warm hand on the back of Harry’s neck and gently stroked it.
Eating his daily portion of oatmeal in peace was once again deemed too much to ask; Harry thought annoyed as the whispers around him continued as though he wasn’t even here. He smashed a strawberry in the bowl, trying to keep his very tired eyes from rolling.
Blaise turned to him so fast, Draco was surprised his neck didn’t snap.
Draco continued to gain confidence as he neared the crying boy. “Harry, please… the moments that mattered…” another kiss. “Our date at the train station…” kiss on his wrist “The dance…” the wet lips touched his own drowned cheek, ”-That night… everything was real.”
“Hey, hey! We support you Harry,” Dean hurried to explain. “It’s just… why didn’t you say something sooner? Or at least give us a heads up before telling the whole school?”
As he tried to casually glance in their direction, he watched the pair of Slytherins discussing quietly.
‘Perhaps Malfoy really had started to change’, Harry thought.
Almost snorting, Malfoy turned to him. “As if you are going to the library when we aren’t here.”
As he neared the drinkstable, he noticed Professor Snape standing by. The potion master was most likely supervising the party rather than participating in it like his colleges. At first glance you wouldn’t see any difference in the proffessor’s formal wear than from his casual robes but taking a second notice these robes were almost darker than the usual dusty black color. The buttons on the front were entirely made of silver and he wore tiny matching cufflinks.
“Harry?” Ron got up from his seat as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Are you coming?”
The door to their chamber opened and Ron came in. The two boys had barely been alone since the incident with Ginny. Looking at him, Harry got ready to defend his ensemble. But instead Ron surprised him.
After almost three hours, he had gotten a present for everyone on his list, except one for Snape and Draco. Normally, he wouldn’t have bought a gift for Snape but he had been really helpful this year and saved his ass through most of his life. Besides, Jason was his friend and Snape was his father, so just like he bought something for Molly and Arthur, he felt like he should buy something for him as well.
Done eating, the two friends left the great hall. Harry really didn’t wish to the spend the last hour wrapping presents but Seamus was his friend and he was right, Harry didn’t really have anything better to do. Well, he did want to find Draco and wish him a merry Christmas before he left. Even though he was still mad at him, he didn’t want to spend Christmas wondering if Draco was still his boyfriend or not.
“What?” Okay, not the best response but it was better than yelling, he supposed.
“You like it! I’m so glad, I was kind of afraid the sugar on top was too much.”
“Sorry, man. ‘Just too weird.” Dean defended them.
“Well, actually I was talking to Jason, and he was the one whom suggested it. So, it will be us against a group of his friends.” Harry answered him while chewing his chicken.
“Seven. Seven-and-a-half.”
“No, seriously, of course she will, I would.” He goofily smiled, before a brilliant idea hit him. It was almost so perfect, he imagined a lightbulb would pop up any moment and explode.
Back to the story now.
“Slytherins do not change, Potter.”
Standing up, Harry looked around for his friends. Seeing the red haired boy, he waved.
“Fine! No, not really. He wanted to date him, so I’m just guessing Draco likes him, okay? You don’t really talk about your feelings in Slytherin, especially not if you are a man.”
“Hey, I’m sitting right here.” Seamus pouted.
“No, I swear!” Harry laughed too. “It moved its head, swinging from side to side. Never understanding that I followed as well.” He demonstrated shaking his head.
“You will pair up and take turns using the ‘
Out of all the chaos and heartache, one thing had changed for the better. Ever since his son had lost his spark, Snape had been careful and attentive towards the teen. As if he finally grasped the concept of being there for him in the worst of times, the two had become closer. Harry was glad if not a little jealous. Yes, it was true, he had his friends, but Harry could imagine it would feel better to have a parent’s shoulder to cry on. Someone whom had experience in relationship. No matter how sappy it sounded, none of his close friends had ever really been in his situation. Hermione and Ron were still happy even though they fought all the time. Dean and Seamus was happy but did at least try to keep it civil in front of Harry as to not choke him on their happiness.
“’member to keep your distance for a’while.” Hagrid grinned. “Spread out to your sides -a little more- can everyone see? Good, let’s begin.”
“So, what are your plans this Christmas?” Harry tried again.
“Where have you been at this time?” he smirked.
TheMillionaireBitch
Dazed Harry turned back once again.
“Is he awake?” Harry whispered as they both watched the interaction.
No such luck.
Harry had spent most of it avoiding almost every student and the constant hate and gossiping he had been exposed to. Moreover, after almost becoming a permanent part of the walls he had ended the year in the Ministry of Magic, fighting for his own life as well as his friends’ against Voldemort and his army of death eaters. When Harry had realized his time was almost up, Professor Dumbledore had emerged from the Floo’ network and in string, the entire Order of Phoenix.
“No!” Pansy shook for finger right into his face. “The school knew! Not PEOPLE, not OUR people! What am I going to tell my father?”
The massive red train had left Kings Cross Road at Platform 9¾ on a rather grey morning. In the third compartment on the right, Harry Potter, also known as the boy who lived, sat alone. Already changed into his common black robes, staring at the view of houses and streetcars slowly turning into green grass and giant meadows. Beside him on the soft cushion seat sat an empty cage. Barely a second after leaving the station, Harry had opened the window and the beautiful white bird had flown out to stretch her wings.
As Snape re-entered the room he held a warm goblet of something smoky. He almost bumped the table in a hurry to place the golden cup in front of Remus before sitting back down.
They were standing face to face now. Malfoy looked rather casual standing with his hands in his front pockets. Harry tried not to fiddle too much and settled for clasping his hands.
While Harry had a hard time seeing how Jason’s brown eye resembled to sand, he let it go in favor of answering the gentle girl.
Checking if anyone was watching, he unfolded it;
“Get off ‘ye beast.” Hagrid chastised as he hurried to drag the dragon back inside. Harry pushed as well on the large scaly chest and was finally able to rise.
“Oh, I hadn’t really thought of that…” A rather tiny ray of self-doubt and nervousness entered his stomach.
“Please…” Harry gasped breathlessly.
He was married to a woman, Harry had unfairly hated for weeks. The idea of Draco, laughing, drinking… having a good time. And all Harry had was a small apartment, friends whom he didn’t feel very connected to and the need to sleep for the next ten years. Draco… who still had his heart wrapped around his annoying perfect-manicured finger.
Even between the added exercise, Ron found it necessary to discuss Harry and Malfoy’s upcoming date.
Sirius had been gay? Or bi? Or at least curios?
At last, they pulled away from each other and Harry waited a second before opening his eyes.
“Hey,” Harry bumped a shoulder against him. “I had to be quick, because a certain princess wasn’t in the mood to wait.”
Harry nodded in agreement.
“It’s not your fault, Hagrid-“  Harry never finished because suddenly Aodhan started snarling towards something behind them. Glancing across his shoulder, he saw some of the teachers running towards them.
“I believe we’re going to be dancing.”
Reaching for the heavy book, harry thanked him and quickly turned to the appointed chapter. After only reading a few paragraphs, Harry needed something to write notes with.
“Yeah, it only arrived this morning so I haven’t had the time to give it…” He left the sentence hanging.
“What?” Harry’s eyes widened in disbelief. “It’s true!”
It seemed logical. Perhaps he had overreacted a bit. Malfoy had
“Huh?”
decision not to marry
A painful surge rushed through him at the thought of Lupin working here again. The idea of once again, sharing his only known home with the wolf felt as tormenting now as it had done years ago.
The blond must have felt watched because suddenly his steal grey eyes moved from his cock and locked onto Harry own. No, the lips were nothing compared to the raw lust he saw swarming through the eyes of his boyfriend. Only watching him, lying on the bed, ready to be fucked.
Hagrid gathered the dragon in his arms and held him close, while Harry carefully picked up a foot to cut. He was careful to listen whenever Hagrid told him it was too close to the root before cutting. He really didn’t want to hurt Aodhan. But while the dragon was very cute and happy, he was also very determined not to help them in any way. As soon as Harry had clipped the first claw, Aodhan started struggling and even went as far as to bite Hagrid. Thankfully, his teeth weren’t big enough to do any damage but it didn’t look pleasant.
Choosing a subject proved to be harder than expected. Not because there were limited options, oh no, in fact it was completely the opposite. Jason had so many ideas and insight that their assignment could take. Harry realized rather quickly that Jason had an easy time remembering History. He explained it usually glued to his brain the first time he heard a story, because it just felt like a long fairytale to him. Jason had finally giving up, trying to ask for Harry’s opinion. He had tried to explain to him the concept of the essay they would be doing for almost ten minutes before realizing Harry didn’t really care what they wrote about. Harry had let Jason take charge of the assignment, since his own grades in history were… less satisfying.
How could he have been so foolish?!
Smiling, Jason simply gave Harry a pat on the back and so they decided to talk about something else.
“Thanks, Malfoy.”
“I must leave you now, Mr. Potter. The headmaster needs to speak with me.”
“Oh. Because of Voldemort?” Harry pretended not to notice how Malfoy still shuddered at the name.
Realizing she was losing the battle, the blackhaired girl tried another tactic. “Don’t you even care what humiliation I will face? It is common knowledge we’re engaged-“
Harry just stared at him while Jason explained his relationship. Even though they were almost the same age, this was the reason Jason sometimes seemed so much older, wiser. Harry believed that like himself, the Slytherin had been forced to grow up faster than normality. The larger part of their fellow students had no idea what it felt like to lose someone so close to you. Many thought it was the same as losing an uncle or grandmother, but it was nothing like that. Losing a parent changed you forever. Not everyone would see the change but it came in a smashing desperate feeling of loss and abandonment.
“How did you know?” the hoarse whisper was almost silent as Pansy erupted a harsh chuckle.
“Hi.”
“By different you mean prudish?”
“Did they use magic?”
“Lauris…” He whispered. “Is your father…”
“-Of all the senseless foolhardy actions someone from Slytherin has ever done-“
“Sorry.” Harry mumbled as he scratched his head.
“You look beautiful.”
He wanted it harder? Draco wouldn’t stop him.
would be ashamed of having me as a son.”
For a long time, the professor stared at him, seemingly lost in thought. After an eternity, Snape sighed and rubbed his temples.  “Go to your room.” He sent him off with a casual wave of the hand.  Harry kept from commenting and went for the door. Just before he left, Snape stopped him once more.
“Not much. Someone is going to come and get him. Probably in a few days. I’m allowed to come and say goodbye, I just don’t want to be alone…” Harry hopefully looked at him, hoping Draco understood.  “No, of course but….” What he had said suddenly dawned on the blond. “Oh no, no, no! Don’t even think about it!”
Hope it was good enough for you to continue reading this story. Please leave a review, it means so much to me!
“Uuh buuuurn… literally.” Knott gibed, having obviously seen the exchange. Draco ignored the annoying boy behind him.
“Doesn’t matter anymore.” she looked away seemingly ashamed. “You should know, I was the one who told Potter about the bet and seeing how much it hurt you, I have felt terrible ever since. I never meant to cause you pain, Draco. I just wanted what I thought would make me happy.”
Coming to a halt, Harry noticed Hannah Abbott amongst the Hufflepuffs. Gently stopping her by grabbing her arm, he certainly surprised her.
‘Wow, stop there, mother, never said I intended to marry him.’ The lucky feeling he gathered from believing his mother was on his side, disappeared as swiftly as it had come.
“You called for me?”
Sighing the boy went closer to the heating flames. Close enough he bent over faintly to see the content. Trying to keep from sounding shocked, he turned back to where Hagrid was steaming two giant cups of tea.
“Can’t believe it is almost Christmas.”  Harry pondered.
“Mental, that one.” Draco muttered as they neared. Harry wasn’t in the mood to correct his behavior and let it slip for now.
DM POV
While Harry had been remotely curious how Jason’s father had been, he also felt like he violated Severus trust as he ended up telling the story of how they met. Jason deserved to know how they were together, but Harry had no excuse to be standing out in the hallway, listening under his invisibility cloak.
“How come?” genuinely curious now.
He never managed to catch up to the teen nor think about how on earth it was possible for them to make it all the way up to the infirmary without taking a break. Finally taking the last step up the stairs, Harry had to grab on to a statue before his legs gave out. Both he and Zabini struggled for breath, but Zabini continued towards the door, bowlegged.
Harry laughed at how weird it sounded, hearing Snape saying the word ‘suck’.
Quickly pulling back his hand, he continued to watch as Professor Sprout talked. Finally, after almost half an hour lecture, she paired them up. Imagining that Blaise would be standing next to Melck on the other side, Draco turned to face Goyle.
Running a hand over his eyes, probably itching after forgetting to blink, the tanned teenager faced him.
So, Jason has another big secret to relieve. What will it be? How did it happen?!
Dancing the second dance, Jason felt so incredibly consumed by happiness. The veela inside him purred as they danced with their mate so close. Holding the smaller man tightly against him, Jason couldn’t help but rejoice as Blaise seemed ignorant or at least careless about the stares they gathered.
“Now, Malfoy!” Looking up he could see a good radius of students around them had heard Pansy and were clearly ready to see the argument unfolding before them. Throwing her claws of him, Draco looked at Blaise a few seats to the right having breakfast with Melck. They had been incredible chummy ever since Melck had been attacked by a unicorn.
“Name reminds me of something… is she one of the ghosts?”
Looking into the mortar, he was surprised nothing had happened. The claws lay exactly as they were before. Not a single little scratch or dust had been made. Putting the pestle back into the bowl, Harry tried using both hands this time. After almost sitting for five minutes he started sweating lightly again. Beads of condescension was gathering on his over lip. But the effort bore fruit. The claws wasn’t completely turned to dust but it gave out and turned to smaller grinded clippings. Overly slowly, it turned to dust and when Harry went to put it into another clean vial, his hands were raw. He wouldn’t be surprised if he found a few blisters by tomorrow morning. Looking rather discouraged at the vial filled with clippings, Harry decided to only make a few, each night. That way he would, hopefully, be able to finish before Christmas and keep his hands intact. Checking his old watch, he noticed there was still at least an hour before dinner began. Since he was sweating, so much he should probably have a shower before leaving.
“There is a dress shop down there?” Dean wondered.
Harry got distracted and through the rest of the breakfast the teens joined the conversation with the other students as they discussed their plans for the day.
“Just so we´re clear,” He leaned in over them. “Out of all of us,
Harry heart started pumping slightly faster. It was as though his brain knew where this was heading but his heart desperately hung on to the last part of her story, wishing for it to be a joke.
“Is that for him?” Jason questioned.
Seamus who had just finished his plate looked up to realize all his friends were looking at him.
“Taste it.” Draco almost ordered.
Severus silently agreed by allowing the hand in his.
“I read a very interesting article the other day about our wonderboy and a little stuck up prat?”
“I know! I just…” Blaise took a shaking breath. “How could you not have told me you were cursed?”
God, Harry hadn’t realized how much he had missed the squeaky voice.
“Draco, even if I were to believe you to be in any kind of… relationship with Potter, then please explain this.”
Knott, who wasn’t known to keep his mouth shut unless his face was stuffed in a book, startled the Gryffindor from his daydreaming.
“I don’t care about that!” Pansy paced. “You weren’t supposed to introduce him to your parents! You basically outed me in front of my family. My father is angry, okay? He doesn’t understand why you are all of a sudden is gay and worse is; why would you tell your parents?”
“I wouldn’t know, but I can see the resembling. Anyway, listening to her mother on multiple occasions, I got the idea that her daughter was engaged to the young Malfoy. Unofficially, of course.” Esben finished his drink.
“Oh right, what is it?”
“Everything.” Forcefully a fist banged against the dark tree and the bookcase rattled intimidatingly. “Yes, Harry explained;
“How is it going otherwise, you and Malfoy?”
“Hey you, stop it!” Harry laughed as he wrestled what was left of his garment out of the toothy mouth.
“Call for my son and send him down here.” Before turning his back on the elf, he added; “Discreetly.”
He felt as though everyone around them had grown so mature. Had anyone asked him a year ago, if he could mention a single person from Slytherin whom he could at least ‘maybe’ see as a good conversationalist, the obvious answer would have been to laugh in whoever-asked’ face. However, after these months he was able to answer ‘plenty’. No, he might not be BFF’s with Jason nor Blaise but he could definitely see himself keeping in touch with Melck.
“Proud ancestors, believing-“
Harry opened his eyes. The bright light almost blinded him and he quickly closed them again.
“Ron, you’re not helping!” Hermione chastised. “Just stop it.”
“Oh merlin! Did you try to bite Snape?!” Harry interrupted. Remus only lifted a hand to silence him.
“Potter? What are doing?”
, for the both of you.” Seamus raised his eyebrows in a persuasive manner.
“Harry, you should have stayed in the castle with your friends.”
Taking a deep breath, Harry answered honestly. “No.”
The tiny ray of hope in his heart plummeted to its burning death as she spoke the final words. Whishing the earth would swallow him whole, he barely noticed when Pansy left his sight. The sound of a squeaking door stopped and the girl called towards his back.
Okay, now he was getting worried. How could the boy not have heard him, Harry was sitting right next to him. Not wanting to spook him, Harry poked him in the shoulder with his pencil, carefully. Even though he had been careful, Jason was still startled at the contact.
“…Your mother? Sorry- I just thought you might have found her here in Britain.”
“Ah, that is a conversation for another day.” Remus replied. “For now, tell me, are you planning on going to the burrow this year?”
Severus could have hit himself for the firth time that day. All that talk of ‘Gaining experience’ ‘Seeing how real Death Eaters did the work.’ Was complete bullshit.
Leaving the infirmary again, he was checked over by Madam Pomphrey once more before he was allowed to leave. However, he had to leave the bandages on and get them changed tomorrow morning.
Lauris stared at him for a long moment. Their eyes connected for a long time and Severus was terrified for a second he had offended the man. In the end, Lauris removed the bottle and leaned it up against the wall.
“What Weasley? Got a problem?”
When the meeting finished, his friends gathered around him, taunting him for receiving the letter, trying to deceive him into sharing whatever the message withheld. But Severus wasn’t that stupid that he wished to share anything. He was on the verge to lash out when Lucius told them to leave him alone.
Harry wasn’t exactly the type to let go easily. He had always blamed himself for others involvement in the war. How was he going to handle letting a child die when he couldn’t help him anymore. On the other hand, the children could certainly not ask for a more caring person.
“Come on Draco, Malfoys don’t run away… it’s just a little party...” Wishing to pull his own hair out, he had to stop since he didn’t have time to put it back in a slick firm style. A knock on the door interrupted his meltdown.
“I’m guessing your thoughts were preoccupied. Well, we’re supposed to write a paper together on a self-chosen war, between 1300-1500th, and explain why it was a time changing event.” Jason explained, opening his history book.
“Oh, thank you Severus, but I already drank my ba-“
“I see.” Harry really didn’t although his heart skipped a beat when he realized she had only mentioned dragons after he looked after Hagrid’s home where Aodhan was currently hidden away. Did Luna know something or was it simply a coincidence she mentioned it?
“Indeed. Ten points to Slytherin.” Snape strolled around the class. “As Mr. Zabini mentioned, I wrote to clearly use crystal flasks, as simple glass or even elfmade glass is too weak to store the acid poison, so in case you want to spent the next weekend in detention and have glass splinters in your hands I suggest you DO NOT use my regular containers. Begin!” Snape ordered.
“Is he okay? Were you here when he woke up?” Harry inquired.
Shut up.
“…My friend… impossible to…”
Tumbling them both to the ground, he was lucky to trap the man underneath him before he had managed to scream.
The Slytherin wrapped his friend up tightly in his arms. The toned muscles squeezing him as they comforted each other.
“Harry? How does it look?” Dean queried from the other room.
“That’s because your mother likes me best, remember?” Dean teased with a sweetened voice.
“Ah!” Harry arms gave out and he fell down on the soft matrass. “Ah, Please!” Harry gasped in pleasure as only his hips was raised in the air.
A forced cough shook Harry out of thoughts and seeing the hardened expression on Draco’s face, he wondered whom it was. Turning around, he saw Pansy standing right behind him, ´seeming quite uninterested that she was clearly interrupting a moment.
“Yes.” The answer seemed to finalise his thoughts. It brought clearance, yet so many questions were left unanswered.
“Harry, are you staying here for Christmas?”
“Do you think you can go to class? It’s with the Slytherins.” Nodding determinedly, the pair went towards the charms classroom where Dean and Seamus were waiting. It was still a bit early and no one beside the two boys had arrived yet.
Aodhan stretched his wings and turned them to lie down against his back. Turning around the dragon looked him deeply in the eyes and held on. Aodhan had saved his life. Getting up, Harry gently sought out the dragon with a hand. As if he still was guarded, Aodhan shielded away from the hand.
“Allright! As you can see, today I have been lucky enough to borrow unicorns for the class. The Havelock Sweeting’ reservation has been kind enough to let us study and interact with them. As they have been so kind to let us borrow the ones that are not shy to human touch, this should be a truly astounding experience for all of you.” Hagrid explained.
“You looked… upset at lunch, is everything okay?”
Looking back, he noticed her brother right away. The two siblings had the same chestnut colored curls and their small statures was remarkably similar.
Getting up the many stairs, they watched as it began to snow. Thick, slow moving snowflakes fell upon them as they stood by the railing.
Glowering beside him Theodore Knott gave him a rather weird look. The boy nodded his head to the side as if to show him the rest of the hall. Sending a bored look out amongst his peers, he realized most of the students were looking either at him or at Potter. A sinking feeling left Draco rather conflicted. Why were they all staring?
“Hm?”
“Hi.” He didn’t step towards the boy to fast in case his anger would be directed towards him, the small chance it was. No answer was received.
Smiling, Jason cautiously came forward. As he watched Jason coming closer, he felt the creature hastily moving away from him. Looking back, he could barely see anything because of the sun shining in his eyes, what he could see though was the giant shadow standing above him on its hind legs. Quickly moving back, he tried to push Jason out of the way before the animal attacked. But as Jason was a visible bigger guy than him, Harry barely had time to push his hands against the older boy’s chest before a pain spread through his body and he felt something wet moving down his head and neck, quickly. The last thing he caught was the sound of screams around him before everything went dark.
Was Malfoy asking him out? The butterflies just reformed and sprouted new even bigger wings. He thought Malfoy was cute, but he had never realized the feeling was mutual. He hadn’t imagined it would ever be current. Trying to keep his voice even, Harry answered quickly.
Harry felt immediate relief when it was clear she had decided to completely ignore his presence.
“Great, just great.” Hagrid said as he poured them two big mugs. “Try turning him over, there is a smaller crack.”
Leaving the dining hall, Harry stayed close to the wall. Staying out of the other students’ notice. Most of the time it came in his favor that he hadn’t grown very tall. Many of his mates towered over him, hiding him in the most convenient times, and then there were other times when-
As he and his friends finally left the castle through to the south pasture, Harry could see Hagrid’s large form standing beside the dark forest. They got closer now to hear the excitement from the students gathered around Hagrid. As they were the few who was last, Harry had trouble seeing. Once more, he cursed his small stature and the Durleys for not nurturing him. Stretching on his toes he finally caught a glint of something white and shining. Around him, the girls whispered and gasped amongst themselves.
Well our hero boy has had a rather tough weekend and Monday morning is not getting easier.
“But ‘Cissa he’s-“
… His parents were less interested in his life.
Turning his head and seeing Jason up close for the first time in weeks gave Harry quite a startle. The pale boy looked sick as his eyes were bulging and blend. He looked incredibly tired and almost seemed to sway as he stood beside Gryffindors.
Simply lying there, Harry listened to his lover’s heart drumming in his ear and before he realized it, he had closed his eyes and had fallen asleep.
“I… don’t even know. It’s… Severus gave me the address and I just… needed to come.”
“Come on…” Harry murmured.
“Hmm?”
“What?”
Jason straight at him the tear stains on his cheeks were almost dried.
“Erhm, maybe.” Unsure wither he would be able to go or if the ban had already become effective. “Are you all getting new ones?”
“Thanks.” He muttered. His voice sounded awful. “I don’t want to talk about it.” Harry continued.
“Do you- actually want to work at the Ministry?”
On the way out, Parkinson rudely yelled after him; “Where are you going? We should head to class soon.”
“I promised-“
“Thank you.” Harry smiled so broadly his cheeks hurt. “You look… incredible.”
“What is it girl?” Harry tried to feed her a small piece of egg but Hedwig simply bit his finger in irritation, making him drop the piece of food.
Deeply sighing, Jason confirmed his theory.
“Understandable.”
The flashback will continue in the next chapter. Thanks for reading!
“Of course, what is it, anything?”
Remus quickly apologized, as he hadn’t expected this turn of events, he had only bought a present for Harry. Jason gave him a breathtaking smile before waving his hand disregarding.
(all failed now)
Your new mate has come to Gringotts and had taken their inheritance test. He had me contact you for he whishes to meet you in a few hours. The parchment you are holding is a port key for you and your other mates to take you four straight to my office.
Draco was watching the show he had began to love when suddenly a large wail was heard from Harry's room.
"Well Pomfrey has asked me to do a check up on the room once in a while.... I was checking her office when I found this!" He pulled out a shiny bullet, "A bullet I found a simple spell which told me what had happened in this room.... I only had to go back a few weeks to see YOU walk in and suddenly what? Pomfrey was shot!"
They had been disappointed to hear he was gay ( all the girls was very disappointed and Ginevera Weasley the most. Some boys were hopeful that they now stood a chance.) but to hear who he fancied was beyond their comprehension and they tore him apart for it, broken him further as was he already was.
What he didn't know was how violently his supposed friends and mere acquaintances would react to his own confessions.
"What is is baby?" He asked.
Severus Snape  stood in the only entrance or exit to the Astronomy Tower, looking at this with a raised eyebrow.
He walked down out of the castle to Hogsmead.
I chuckled when I saw them make out and gave a sharp whistle to get their attention making them break apart. Tom and I chuckled when we saw how flustered they look.
"No baby Potter-" Draco started before Harry put a hand over his mouth.
"Hermione? Really not even an hour later you are with Hermione!" Neville cried.
Snape smirked, "in there lies the problem Albus if we re-age him now he will have no childhood but if we simply get a guardian to take care of him re-aging him in segments when he gets to his proper age not only will he get a new childhood but remember his old one!"
"So your ready to be a big kid tomorrow! But first you need to drink this," Draco had an orange liquid on a spoon.
"Potter a bad name!" He said.
I looked at the four remaining rings and they were the color of each Hogwarts house.
"Where's my little boo boo? Where is he?" Draco tickled Harry as the headmaster swung in dramatically.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Nothing!" Draco's fake smile was not to convincing though.
Gryffindor
Harry was in the process of fixing his shirt at the moment and had no intention to listen in on the conversation until Pomfrey said, "ah yes! What about a lollipop for the good little boy?"
Severus Snape (Vampire)
Not lingering to question it he hurried in to talk to Dumbledore about the 'nighmares'.
"Ah yes, Draco do you recall the night before?. Pomfrey was... what is it called? Shot?" He mused.
"Want to come out with me to get butter beer for Halloween?" Hermione took a big breath.
'' Is that so? I think I have every right to know, as a teacher so concerned with your well being'' He had made the word ' concerned ' sound like a curse and Harry winced at the tone he used, he couldn't help himself.
Harry crept to his room keeping careful watch hoping his Draco wouldn't get mad at him.
"My baby is safe!" Draco was crying and smiling deeply at Neville, "how could I ever repay you Neville?" He cried.
"I would love that, Thank you, Bloodfang," Bloodfang lead me to his office door "All you have to do is walk until you see the green door its not very far, the door will take you to Diagon Alley, " Bloodfang told me.
"Ummm.... we are I believe in the leaky cauldron..." she laughed.
He opened the brass handle and smiled, "what's up little boy?" He looked down at Harry who had knocked.
Dear Aiden Morgan Black (aka formally known as Harry James Potter)
He prepared some eggs which were very wet and half slid off onto the ground, "Well god dammit!" He said reaching for his wand only to see Harry was flicking it making things fly around the house.
It had 5 bed rooms with connected bathrooms.
"Here you go," Pomfrey handed Harry the lollipop. Harry's eyes widened and he started licking it.
Emrys
With a big back yard.
Pansy was almost reaching Draco's dorm when she decided the library was better than the dorm.
"Okay now what shall you wear..."
Harry wanted to argue more and even mention to Severus that he could go to jail for delving into his mind with out his permission but the man was already delving in his thoughts.
"Whoah! It's huwge!" Harry oohed and awed.
"I don't want you to either," muttered Draco as they exited the office, Draco just giving up, the eighth years were bad enough, insulting him mostly for not killing famous Potter and the first to seventh years just thought of him as the traitor Malfoy, of course he wasn't! He was the great Draco Malfoy! But all that would be gone now that he was bringing Po- Harry into the dorms.
"In the what now?" Draco looked at Harry.
ɪ sᴜʀᴇ ᴀs ʜᴇʟʟ ʜᴏᴘᴇ ᴛʜᴇsᴇ ᴡᴀʟʟs ᴀʀᴇ sᴏᴜɴᴅ ᴘʀᴏᴏғ...
Pansy was a beautiful powerful lady and Hermione was.... Well in her opinion.
At that time Draco hurting himself was terrible his body was covered in scars and he was having to hide it from his new best friend, Neville who was to say the least very suspicious...
He entered Draco's dorm, who was trying to force Harry to eat.
"I know! That's why I messed it up!" Pansy giggled like a 5 year old.
Potter had chosen the stairs that led to the Astronomy Tower and he halted at the bottom, unsure. A few options lay before him. Considering that the tower was usually always used for the sexual release of teenagers, it was possible  that he was going there for his own release or encounter, but Severus could never be sure that it won't be for something else.
"I'll let you boys enjoy yourselves!" She winked before leaving.
As he approached the entrance, not knowing the password, it just opened without him needing it.
Draco kissed Harry's forehead and left the room.
"So he's a faggot maybe a good beating will show him where he stands!" Ron yelled.
I was the first to wake up and was spooning Lucius. We were all cuddling (even if I hate to admit it). In the middle was Aiden, then Draco and Lucius on both sides of him, then Tom and I on either sides of them.
"Okay, hop on," Draco bent over as the made their way out of the Slytherin dorms and up to madam Pomfreys.
500 (higher than Merlin's)
The house elves cleaned up, then we went to all of our old homes to move everything we needed to the new one and soon we were finished.
"So many costwumes!" Harry gawked.
I watched as my little
All credit goes to the author @ theblobonwallstreet, this is their work and not mine.
But it was faint,he quickly thought about everything he knew about muggle wounds and repaired it, he thought not to tell anyone what just happened he even erased the last 10 minutes of her mind.
"Yea!" Crabbe and Goyle failed at yelling in a failed sync.
Neville stormed up to his dormitory, he packed up a suitcase and left again.
He jerked up right when he heard the swish of a cloak and tap of feet upon the floor.
"Um yeah it's a long story, thanks bud!" Neville rushed out.
Harry sighed, "Ron and Hermione have stopped hanging out with me ever since I told them I was gay," that was no surprise and it became no news that Harry was gay but still the question lingered,
"That will be enough ,Weasley, detention tonight, today we will be making," Snape began to teach the lesson.
Harry was panicking, ‘’ Oh, no! Hawwy kill Dwaco, no no no Hawwy no want to kiwl Dwaco! Hawwy wuf Dwwaco! ‘’ Harry sat on the ground and began crying a big puddle of tears on the ground as he was panicking about Draco before Draco stood up and picked up the crying toddler.
Without even thinking Draco picked up Harry and began to comfort the tiny child, " No no no! You didn't upset me!" Draco looked right at Harry he was a very cute baby with big wandering eyes, a cute little nose, his face was all red from the crying, but that barely took away from the cuteness of it all some might say it added to it!
Uh huh .... Well then we must find a Guardian, the Durs -''
"Of course I will! I really do think your beautiful 'Mione!" Pansy ruffled Hermione's hair.
Draco,oh, Draco just go and die alone!
"Uh huh... Well than we must find a guardian the Dursl-"
XXXXX
"Wait" I exclaimed once we were all dressed. "Can we go to my dog father's?" I asked my mates. They all looked at each other and it looked like they were having a silent conversation. They finally came to an agreement. "We can go to your dog father's but not for very long," Tom said "But I have to tell them who I really am," I said back to them. A look of realization dawned across their faces. "We will stay however long it takes," Lucy said and took me into his arms. "Okay" I said "Hold on to me " I told all my mates, I was going to bring us all to my real fathers. They did as told and we disappeared with a loud pop and landed in front of #12 Grimmauld Palace. "Do any of you guys have parchment and a quill?" I asked. Draco pulled out parchment and Severus pulled out a quill. The Order of the Phoenix can be found at #12 Grimmauld Palace. I wrote on the paper and showed it to all of my mates. "Memorize it" I told them.
It was still warm.
I wrapped my arms around him too. "Don't let anyone see you in something like this" I whispered in his ear and he shivered against me and buried his head in my neck.
Draco walked back to Hogwarts taking in the beautiful scenery and trees which surrounded the building, tall giant trees! How had he never noticed them?
"That son of a bitch...." Draco tightened his fists.
"I actually came to ask you something..." Hermione smiled.
Draco sat up straight trying to sound sophisticated said, "I'll think about it Potter, anyways what potion shall we make I know 5 down by heart..."
"It seems that our little submissive changed into his kitten form by accident." I said with amusement in my eyes. Draco, Tom and Severus walked over to me and looked at Aiden taking in one of his forms and his scent to keep track of him in any form, he might take. "I wonder if he can change back ?"
