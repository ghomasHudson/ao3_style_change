“Yeah, I should do that.” Draco muttered absentmindedly, sneaking a glance at the Gryffindor table out of habit but quickly looking away – face heating with an emotion he was unable to name – as he was met with a bright smile from Potter almost instantly.
“Seriously, Draco? Are we really back to this again?” she puts her face in her manicured hands and sighs in exasperation, muttering under her breath. “I can’t believe I came back to this school for eighth year just to have to deal with a repetition of your Potter-stalking bullshit.”
“The ancient Greek lovers?” Pansy said, appearing beside him out of nowhere, her fancy Celestina Warbeck’s robes swirling around her feet. “Merlin, that’s the nerdiest thing I’ve seen all year. And I’m friends with Hermione Granger now!” Pansy squinted at him and her eyes widened. “Is that mascara you’re wearing?” she shouted. “You
Draco looked between Potter and his own traitorous teammates in indecision before he finally gave up, murmuring a low
Draco pretended to go back to his book, glaring up at Potter when a minute later another crumpled ball landed right in front of him. Potter shrugged innocently.
“Harry! Malfoy!” He waved them over, grinning widely. “You two look cool. Are you supposed to be house-elves?”
After dinner, Draco found himself pacing the school grounds in the dancing snow of December, crushing the soft carpet of white under his boots. He was walking the same path that he’d took with Harry that day in the alternate reality, hovering over the same spot that he’d been standing on when Harry had told him that he loved him.
been the only one who’d yielded to it, pushing everyone away and adding to their concerns instead of helping.
no,” Potter scratched the back of his neck sheepishly. “Actually, I’d hoped you’d come visit him. It’s just… I want Teddy to have a big family and grow up around people who’d love and care for him,” he looked away from Draco, swallowing. “Since… I know how it feels to be lonely as a kid and I don’t want that for Teddy.”
“No,” Harry shook his head. “We dated for a couple of months back in Sixth Year, but it didn’t work out for us. We’re still close friends though, but not together anymore.”
,” said Draco, much to Weasley’s further delight. “And absolutely unfair! Our keeper kept running away from the Quaffle instead of trying to catch it,”
“I’d think twice about that, Parkinson,” a third girl said threateningly. “Do you think you can take all of us by yourself?”
And to always remember that happiness – however short and temporary – came with a great cost for him.
What? What is he asking? Why isn’t he kissing Draco already? Has Draco missed a part of the conversation?
“Does he?” Harry said with a way too amused expression. “Yes, I’m thinking about joining the Ministry’s Auror Program come fall.”
So according to Blaise, Draco had a boyfriend now, and if Potter’s behavior was anything to go by, there was a good chance that
Once inside the common room, Draco excused himself almost immediately; making his way to the boys’ dormitories and closing the door behind himself. None of the other Eighth Year Slytherin boys were there yet and the dormitory was empty except for Draco. So Draco dropped his disguise; his face crumpling with all the emotions he’d felt that day that were threatening to tear him open from the inside out and crawl their way out of his skin.
And now, standing in front of Potter in one of the narrow corridors of the dungeons, Draco could feel the flush of pink blooming on his face and the skin of his bare arms at the look he saw in Potter’s eyes as he stared at him.
Potter’s eyes widened in a mixture of surprise and fury but just as he opened his mouth to protest, he was cut-off by Pansy who stood beside their desk, looking between the two of them with a suspicious look in her eyes. “Potter, do you mind? You’re in my seat.”
“…I’m still not sure about my makeup, though,” Millie was explaining to Draco, Pansy and Theo at the Slytherin table at lunch.
“Now, now, Miss Parkinson.” Pomfrey was frowning. “We don’t know if it was Mr. MacMillan who attacked Mr.Malfoy. Nobody saw the attacker’s face.”
When he read the words on the parchment, he didn’t bother to write anything back. He didn’t even spare another glance in Potter’s direction. He just gathered up his things and walked straight out of the library to go and sign up for the Quidditch team.
He hadn’t been the only one hurting, or the only person who was overwhelmed by the guilt they were carrying on their shoulders, but he
Gasping, Harry fisted a hand in Draco’s hair, guiding his head, and Draco let him, swallowing around Harry’s cock and making him tighten his grip on Draco’s hair with pleasure.
The gryffindor crowd is, per usual, seated by the hearth in the eighth year common room. Granger and Weasely are sharing a couch, grossly entwined with her head on his shoulder and his arms around her slight figure. Finnigan is on the floor, gesturing wildly as he tells some story about his father as a child. Longbottom is leaning against a wall, cradling a pot of plant in his hands and Thomas is talking to one of the Patil twins; the one that Potter took to the Yule Ball back in their fourth year and annoyed the
,” Draco cried out before his numb fingers lost their grip on Harry’s shoulder, which sent him sprawled down on the surface of the desk.
“Maybe,” Draco said, his tone flat. “But not before I hex all of your heads permanently bald. So maybe you’re the ones who should think twice about this.”
And the truth was that whatever happened, he wanted Harry in his life, even if only as a friend and nothing more. Harry was the candlelight he didn’t want to lose sight of, even if he could never get close enough to feel its warmth again. So Draco would keep his distance.
“MacMillan,” Draco tightened his grip on his wand. He didn’t want to hurt him, but this time, he would defend himself. “What do you want?”
Draco had just kept his head down and took all the hits, one after the other. And now he was here, in the Hospital Wing. Severely injured by one of the many people who hated him. And Draco already knew that once he got discharged, he would continue to keep his head down, to not fight back and to let them hurt him and call him by all the foul names they could think of.
He had taken his sweet time making sure he looked flawless in his costume. He had charmed his hair to grow longer – now softly brushing his shoulders in loose blonde curls – and worn a wristband of brown leather matching the straps of his sandals over his Dark Mark.
“But the real question is,” Pansy’s tone turns serious. “If the two of you kiss, and you realize that he doesn’t like you like that, would you be okay? Would you be able to take that outcome and move on with your life?”
“What? That was not what you expected to hear, was it?” MacMillan sneered, coming closer still. “Did you think that I’m here to apologize to you because he told me to? You think I’m afraid of him?”
Harry chuckled softly against Draco’s lips and they kissed as he worked Draco opened with his long, thick fingers, scissoring and twisting them inside Draco and making him helplessly moan into Harry’s mouth. Harry’s cock was still very much hard and leaking against the inside of Draco’s thigh, but he was apparently getting more pleasure out of watching Draco jerk in desperation for him than actually fucking Draco.
“Shall we?” Potter held out his arm which Draco took with a half-hearted eye roll, his stomach still swarming with butterflies.
“And what conclusion did you come to?” Draco sneered. “Am I trying to assassinate you? Is it all a part of my big plan to resurrect the Dark Lord? Please, enlighten me, I’m curious to know.”
“No,” Draco said desperately. “You’re making me sound innocent. I’m not innocent, Harry. I’m not some perfect, pure-hearted kid who’d tragically fell victim to the hands of bad people. I’m one of those people myself.”
Draco swallowed, looking at Potter’s determined expression in amazement. He’d been aware that Potter wasn’t really looking for revenge – he was just too bloody noble for that sort of thing – but he was still surprised to find out that
“Detention, Harry!” Slughorn managed in agony. “You’ll receive detention!” And to his own utter horror, Draco had an idea.
“Holy shit.” Pansy suddenly sits up and drags Draco out of his thoughts once again. “Draco, I might actually have an idea.” She crosses her legs on the sofa, turning to him completely. “What if you got to kiss him?”
“I just figured that if we are to not see each other for the next couple of weeks, I’d want to make sure that I hadn’t missed my chance with you,” Harry’s brows drew together in determination. “I wanted to let you know that I like you.”
Draco stood under the pleasant, steaming shower for several minutes, letting the hot water soothe his taut muscles and wash away the ache in his bones. When he finally stepped out of the shower stall – his dark green turtleneck tucked neatly into his black trousers and patting at his damp hair with a soft, baby blue towel – Potter, Weasley and Justin Finch-Fletchley had already showered and each stood by a locker, caught up in a heated conversation about the game.
Draco was still recovering from his climax – weak and breathless under the solid weight of Harry’s body – when Harry slid a hand – fingers still slick with his own saliva – between them, pulling gently at Draco’s cock.
“I didn’t know it back then, or maybe I just didn’t want to admit it but,” Potter looked back at him, the ghost of a sad smile on his lips. “When you refused to identify me for them in the Malfoy Manner, even though you knew it was me, I … that was when I forgave you.”
, now??? What near-impossible, one-in-a-zillion alternate reality was this? And the fact that his Dark Mark was still perfectly intact made the situation all the more confusing. Maybe Potter was…playing with him or something?
And for the rest of the class, Draco can’t focus on anything but the delicious buzzing of his lips and the distant taste of mint and coconuts and
!” Draco whined as he felt the tip of Harry’s tongue pushing in, the ends of his jet black hair tickling Draco’s cock.
“At least she didn’t accuse Malfoy of dosing you with Love Potion this time,” The Weasley-girl said casually. “
Draco’s mind went blissfully blank as Harry thrust in and out of him with fast and steady rhythm, his back arching up with each direct stab to his prostate.
. It’s okay, just empty your mind.” Draco felt Harry kiss his head, tangling their legs together. He was rapidly losing consciousness.
“Oh God!” Draco held on to Harry’s shoulders for dear life, his head spinning at the feel of Harry’s cock stretching him open.
“Yeah, probably,” Potter said with a soft chuckle. “Oh, you have a …” Potter reached out and brushed the pad of his thumb on Draco’s frozen cheek, making the breath catch in his throat. “There was a snowflake on your face.”
“That’s actually a good idea,” Granger nodded. “I know you two wanted to be subtle about the whole thing, but this might actually get Rita off your back.”
“It’s none of your business, Potter,” Draco turned away, heart hammering in his chest, and picked up the first thing he could find – which was a large bottle of dragon blood – and busied himself with dusting it so he’d have something else to look at instead of Potter’s face.
Potter’s eyebrows draw together in a thoughtful manner, he’s not laughing anymore. “I don’t think it’s that simple, though. You didn’t kiss me just for the sake of it. I think you kissed me because you like me.”
When Draco stepped out of the Slytherin common room into the narrow corridors of the dungeons, his eyes landed on a figure he’d least expected to see there, leaning casually against the stone wall, smiling at him.
“Alright, fine. Whatever,” Draco interrupted their conversation, impatient to just run back to his Gryffindor-free comfort zone so he could process this endless chain of train wrecks. “We’re gonna go now. Pans, come on.”
Draco took an involuntarily step forward, taking Potter’s left hand into his own. “You’re wearing a wristband.” He almost whispered, unable to hide the trace of astonishment in his voice.
“Morning, Harry,” Draco answered impassively, putting the heavy, leather-bound book about the history of charms back on its shelf.
him knowing that he wants to do it. Potter and his ridiculous sense of honor and integrity. Now Draco has no choice but to say no and ruin the whole thing.
“I should have been there for you, Pans,” Draco said, trying to blink away his tears so he could look her in the eyes properly when he said it. “I’m sorry.”
A green light shone at the back of Draco’s eyelids as the flames in the fireplace flared to life, dragging him out of his sweet sleepy haze. And a moment later, in a quiet whisper came Harry’s voice.
…” they screamed, shooting sparks of red and gold from the tips of their wands into the freezing morning air. And Potter looked down at Draco, a crown of tiny snowflakes resting on the soft tangle of his black hair, and his smile was so bright and warm that Draco almost forgot that he was pissed for losing to him once again. Almost.
Draco’s trunk sat ready beside his bed for tomorrow morning, when he would leave for the Christmas holidays. And tucked safely inside the hidden pocket of his trunk, next to the black velvet box holding the delicate silver ring – the glazed solitaire now empty of any life-changing purple liquid – sat a small golden ball, a reminder that the past few months hadn’t been just a vivid production of Draco’s desperate mind.
The sound of Pansy clearing her throat drags Draco’s attention from Potter’s retreating figure and the self-pity he’s feeling at the moment to Pansy’s face and he instantly regrets looking at her.
“It has, indeed.” Borgin gave him an empty smile, showing off his disgusting yellowed teeth. “Tell me, how’s your father doing? The house arrest must be really hard for him. Poor man.”
“Fine, you’re right; I did it on purpose,” Draco made himself admit. “I needed to talk to you and I thought this would be a good opportunity.” He felt his cheeks heat slightly as he looked down at the floor.
Draco took it from him. It was a purple jumper with a large golden H knitted on its chest. “Is that your Weasley jumper?” Draco raised his eyebrows. “You want me to wear your old
“An Auror mission. Classified. The whole team was there. Minor injuries mostly, but still, it was utter chaos.”
“It’s not really out of generosity, Malfoy,” Potter shrugged. “It’s because I simply don’t have the emotional strength to hold grudges against people anymore. I’m just too tired for it.”
“So, according to Headmistress McGonagall, the winning team is the one that gets to use the showers first,” Terry threw his hands out. “So I don’t know about you, but that’s enough motivation for me, because it’s freezing out there and we’re gonna need hot water.”
“Gryffinpuff is immediately in possession of the Quaffle, we have Parvati Patil heading straight for the goalposts of the opposite team. Nice job, Parvati! Didn’t know you had it in ya! – oh! Holy … an angry Bludger is flying towards her from no other than the Slytherclaw Beater, Padma Patil, her own sister! Damn, the Patil twins are showing some real skill today! The Gryffinpuff Chaser dodges the Bludger but – oh, are you KIDDING ME? – she drops the Quaffle just like that.
, to complement his family tradition of naming the children after constellations. Harry had almost given up – his argument of
“Draco, darling…” Pansy starts, but Draco ignores her, turns away and walks out of the hall. He knows he’s acting like a total prick. He knows that Pansy had only ever been trying to help and it’s not her fault that Draco just can’t seem to be able to get over this whole kissing-potter thing like he’d promised he would; but he can’t bring himself to care. At least not for now.
he was Harry Potter’s boyfriend? How was that even possible? What kind of a weird, utterly mental reality
“Look, I know that the things I’ve done to you and your friends aren’t easy to forgive, and I’m not asking you to forgive me immediately,” Draco ran a hand through his hair in distress. “I just want you to know that I regret my actions and behavior in the past and no longer wish to be that person. So maybe someday, you can find it in your heart to forgive me, but even if you don’t; it’s okay.” Draco’s voice cracked at the last part and he gritted his teeth to keep his eyes from filling with tears. He needed to be strong for this.
Borgin had warned Draco that the potion could cost him his sanity. That was why Draco had been reluctant to use it right till this moment. But, at this point, he didn’t have much sanity left anyways. So why the hell not?
“Hummm,” a pleased, deep hum vibrated out of the man’s chest, making Draco shiver. “I’ve wanted to do that since I woke up this morning.”
Draco let out a breath that he felt like he’d been holding for eleven days – or maybe a lot longer, he wasn’t sure – and took Potters warm, steady hand into his own cold, trembling one.
Draco was getting more and more agitated by the second, but he would rather die than give Borgin the satisfaction of knowing that. He wouldn’t be humiliated by this man who himself wasn’t any better than Draco and his father.
“For Merlin’s sake.” Draco mutters under his breath as he rereads the same line of his potions book for the nth time, desperately trying – and failing – to keep his attention on those simple words written on the pages in front of him and not on the stupid, awful, utterly ridiculous, absolutely fucking gorgeous dark-haired man comfortably sprawled on a couch just a few paces away from him.
As Slughorn goes on and on and on about how interesting he finds Draco’s idea for reducing the negative effects of some of the healing potions he has been teaching them about, Draco nods politely but he doesn’t catch a damn detail. The only thing he can think about is the shape of an angular jaw he had caught sight of at the eighth years’ breakfast table that morning and that ringing of a deep, delighted laughter he’d heard last night that had touched him right on the fucking heart.
know anything about that, Mr. Holier Than Thou, Savoir of the Wizarding World,” Draco snapped. “Do you think it’s easy to just let go? Just like that?” He turned to come face to face with Potter. “And don’t you
The corner of Potter’s mouth lifts up in an amused, almost invisible smile. “Do you want me to kiss you?”
It was a small bedroom with a queen size bed taking up most of the space inside. Draco walked the few remaining steps of distance to stand by the edge of the bed, running the tips of his fingers on the soft, plain white sheets.
“No it wasn’t,” Potter lifted a large basket of dried beetles. “Which makes me wonder; you’ve been trying so hard to stay out of trouble for the past couple of months. Why would you suddenly decide to get yourself
“Today I wished you were there with me more than I’d ever done before,” Harry told him. “I was at the verge of a mental breakdown and I could’ve really used my anchor.”
When Harry pressed in a long finger alongside his tongue – almost sending Draco over the edge – Draco hissed and pulled at his hair, overwhelmed.
Draco was pretending to study, but what he was really doing was sneaking glances at Potter, who was sitting at a table in the next row of the library with his friends.
Draco sighs – tucking his wand back into his pocket – and turns to leave. “We’ve got nothing to talk about.”
Harry sighed again, his eyes opening and his shoulders relaxing a bit. He leaned in and rested their foreheads together.
And it was fine. Even though Draco greedily missed talking to Harry, he’d decided that it was best for the both of them if he kept a safe distance from Harry until after the holidays; so he would have time to patiently untangle the messy knot of his feelings for Harry, acknowledge them one by one, and then tuck them neatly inside the furthest and most unreachable chamber of his heart, and lock the door. That way, when he came back, he could be the reasonable and supportive friend that Harry deserved, and not this jealous, possessive prick that completely lost his mind at the thought of Harry even wanting to kiss someone other than Draco himself.
“I…” Draco swallows hard and closes his eyes, trying to think about it. Would he rather kiss Potter once and face the reality of him not wanting Draco back – could he truly take that without falling apart? It is one thing to know Potter doesn’t want him but another thing to actually hear him say it – or quietly watch Potter from a distance for the rest of his life and just as quietly; wonder?
He paces the bathroom back and forth a few times but when a fifth year student walks in and narrows his eyes at Draco suspiciously, he gives up, swings his backpack over one shoulder and walks out of the bathroom.
“Thank you, Mother,” said Draco, needlessly straightening his spotless, ironed, dark-green graduation gown.
“Yeah,” Draco’s mouth twitched in a small smile. “See? It couldn’t have been you, then. And it’s not your fault that Weasley chose this job either, love. It was
Draco’s attention caught at the mention of his own name, his senses sharpening and dragging him out of the sweet realm of sleep. The two of them probably hadn’t noticed Draco sitting just behind them – too caught up in their heated conversation.
Potter and Weasley got back to work, occasionally glancing at each other from the corner of their eyes and snickering to themselves.
“I…” Draco closed his eyes with defeat, exhaling the tantalizing scent of Potter out of his lungs so he could properly
“Sometimes, when a patient dies and I can’t save them, I get this awful voice at the back of my head telling me that I should have joined the Auror training,” Harry said, absently stroking Draco’s back. “That maybe if I’d become an Auror, I could do a better job at helping people.”
“I put her to bed hours ago.” Draco answered, opening his arms in silent invitation. And just as silently, Harry climbed onto the sofa and into his embrace, resting his forehead on Draco’s collarbone.
After the game, Draco and the other Slytherclaws – dammit Weasley-girl – headed for the Ravenclaw locker room to wait for their turn in the showers. And to Draco’s surprise, none of his teammates seemed to be disturbed by the fact that they’d just suffered a rather humiliating defeat. There were only arms around shoulders and easy laughs and light punches to each other’s biceps as they picked their way out of the field as a team.
Draco had put a lot of thought into it. He’d spent months researching different programs and reading dozens of catalogues about various training courses. There were a lot of jobs out there. He could become a Potion Maker, or a Fashion Designer. He could work for the Ministry as an Unspeakable or a Curse Breaker. He could even join the Auror program alongside Harry. Those were all great options for him, but none of them had felt
“Back in Fifth Year when I lost Sirius, I…” he gulped, looking down at his entwined hands. “I couldn’t help blaming myself for his death. My godfather had died because I was too bloody stubborn to learn Occlumency and stop Voldemort from manipulating my thoughts. And the weight of that knowledge and guilt on my shoulders was driving me insane.” Potter took off his glasses, putting a hand over his eyes.
The group of girls exchanged a few nervous looks with each other before they turned around and quietly, walked away.
After the War, the Ministry had taken all their house elves from them and now the only living creatures inside that enormous manor were Draco, his mother, father, and the occasional Ministry employee coming in to check on his father.
“What do you think, Potter?” said Draco, finally managing to pull Harry’s jeans down to his thighs and cupping his hardness over the fabric of his pants.
“Okay, see you after class!” Potter pecked him lightly on the lips, making Draco almost jump out of his skin – he could never get used to this.
. We have killed each other’s families and friends, and changed each other’s lives forever. We’ve gave each other wounds that would never properly heal. If it was peace that you were after, you shouldn’t have let me back here in the first place.” He stood up then, turning away and walking towards the door.
“We won’t be seeing each other for the next two weeks, then,” Harry said flatly, searching his face for answers Draco didn’t know how to give.
This was the real Chamber of Secrets, Draco knew it, but instead of the long black shadows and the greenish gloom that Draco had always associated with this place in his childhood dreams, the entire place was lit in purple, orange and black Halloween lights. Fat carved pumpkins floated in the air above people’s heads, charmed fake skeletons walked aimlessly among the crowd, fake spider webs and blood decorated the walls, different dishes of snacks, several bowls of Halloween candy, fruits, and bottles of Firewhiskey and Butterbear covered the long tables in each side of the spacious room. And students in colorful Halloween costumes were laughing and chatting and dancing to the loud music all over the marble floor.
“Alright everyone, you’ve all got the ingredients for today’s potion,” Slughorn remarked. “Now settle down and start working.”
“I’m fine. I just…I had a bad dream about my parents,” Draco blurted out a lie. “I was worried about them, is all.”
He opened the box and stared in amazement at the mesmerizing liquid shining behind the tiny glazed solitaire of the ring.
All through the night, as he sat and listened to Granger’s speech with his fingers interlocked with Harry’s, or when they all threw their caps in the air in union, or after that, when they crossed the Black Lake on the enchanted boats like they had done all those years ago when they were First Years; Draco was strangely, unbelievably, and heartwarmingly happy.
Draco cleared his throat and Harry’s expression twisted. He knew Harry had something he wanted to say. Instead, he turned and went to rifle through the kitchen. Draco wanted to push at it, force him to say what he was thinking—that Draco was unwelcome and annoying and needed to leave him the fuck alone.
It was usually the same conversation. The same memories played over and over again. His mother had been on a loop since his father was sent to Azkaban. They had a falling out long before that, but Malfoys didn’t divorce, and somewhere in her, he knew she still loved him. Even after everything; the fall from grace, the punishment, the cowardice. Whatever his mother saw in Lucius, Draco couldn’t see.
He wasn’t making this easy and noted it in the tight grip Harry had on his glass. For his part, Draco took another sip from his and made it a point to check his watch. He had better things to do with his night than spend it rehashing old memories.
Harry shifted and pulled away. Draco mirrored his movement and sat up. Before Harry spoke, Draco could feel the anger. Harry's face twisted into something close to defeat solidifying into a mask of disdain. "Why do you even care, Draco? It's not like it matters to you."
“Are you calling it an early night, Malfoy? That’s a first.” The laugh behind the words made Draco smile.
“I’m glad you took my advice, he’s a very handsome boy. A little too thin, like you, but very lovely.” She paused, took a sip of her tea, and set her cup down. Her hand reached over to him and she gave his fingers a squeeze. “How could I object to someone who loves you as much as I do.”
“You get high and drunk when things don’t go your way, Draco. You say I need help, maybe I do, but you do too. I’m not the reason you hate yourself.”
, peppered with a backhand had him seeing stars. It was still the only liquor he dreamt about for the taste. He couldn’t remember the name.
Draco wanted to respond—protest even—but he was too preoccupied with leaning against Harry. The drugs and alcohol were betraying him because he didn’t object when Harry's grip tightened and his face pressed into Harry's neck. He closed his eyes and suddenly the world shifted. The second his feet hit the ground, the contents of his stomach upended.
Pushing his way into the shower, Harry gave him a sleepy smile. Draco relished watching it disappear behind a soft gasp as he pushed him back against the shower wall. Maybe Draco was okay with falling back into Harry’s orbit. Maybe the universe wasn’t always wrong and, if it was, Draco wasn’t going to correct it any time soon.
Draco felt the same hard embarrassment from Harry’s first rejection at 11 years old claw its way through his body. A ghost of a memory that had been overshadowed by fear and pain and death years later. Still, it caught in his throat now and Draco was not going to allow it to be heard.
“Wait! I need to chat with my boy.” The guard shifted from their spot and Lucius released his hold. Draco fought back the rise of panic at almost being confined and looked down to smooth his hands along his shirt to hide his face. Shoving all his rapid fire thoughts away, he missed his body turning numb. The odd thought that he couldn’t feel his hands drifted through him but he let that float away. He had to focus. Draco turned a blank gaze on his father.
Draco watched the many emotions contort Lucius' face. Almost saw the acceptance, the acknowledgment of what he’d done, what he continued to do—to Draco, Narcissus, and himself. They were trapped in a never ending cycle of pain and loss because Lucius would not let go of what he thought they should be. They were Malfoy’s, but Draco was past caring what that meant. Lucius had to move past it too.
Harry took it, unhearing. But then, Draco’s words dried up and he just held. They remained piled on the floor, Harry’s body a heavy weight on Draco, completely silent as he cried. A cry learned from being beaten for being too loud—for just being—and Draco recognized the pain in that silence. His fingers pressed firm against the back of Harry’s neck. A tether to keep him there, present, so he didn’t drown.
Confusion swam across his face until it gave way to a sheepish apology. “Sorry, I was just thinking. It’s been awhile.”
His gaze caught on the large window that took up half the wall as he stepped inside. It was a nice day out. The last days of summer mixed with fall’s chill to create a perfect breeze and cloudless sky. Not too hot and not too cold, but on the precipice. The sun shone bright and glittered off small glass figures encased in trophy cases. They were small things, flowers mostly, handcrafted and polished every day by a loving hand.
It wasn’t until Draco swept forward and touched her hand that she looked up with some sense of understanding that there was a guest.
This was the most Draco had seen of Harry's body since they started this. Rather than excitement, Draco was struck by how small and bruised Harry really looked. Maybe Draco had ignored it. No, Draco knew he willingly chose not to know. Guilt swept through him. He was selfish using Harry for his own personal catharsis.
He didn’t own a lot. The place was clean but chaotic. The kitchen had some dirty dishes in the sink, which Draco charmed clean before he realized what he was doing. From his brief inspection, they looked secondhand, with a few chips along the edges. The rest of the cupboards were bare of food aside from saltines and a few canned goods. The couch he’d slept on, while leaving a crick in his neck, was comfortable with years of use. It again looked secondhand, one cushion had a well worn impression in it. The shelves were dusty and stuffed with books and knick knacks and pictures.
“Oh? Is his hair still unruly?” Lifting her cup of tea with thin fingers, she took a sip. “Those muggles of his really need to give him a haircut. He’s such a handsome boy to look so unkempt.”
Draco watched him look down and away, so unlike the challenge in school. Harry took a deep breath before his eyes snapped to Draco’s. There it was. There was no shyness there, he saw it in Potter’s determined gaze. He let out an exhale of his own. He didn’t realize he’d been holding his breath. Harry used to do that to him, make him feel like he couldn’t breathe.
“Potter are you going to speak or just sit there like a mute?” The words tumbled out dripping with condescension. They were back at Hogwarts and Draco was bating, to get one more word in, one more second of the great Boy Who Lived’s time. Harry glanced up then, fingers stilling on his glass.
Harry fiddled with his empty glass. It was awkward, of course it was. The last he’d seen of him, Draco’s family had left the Great Hall amid the victory celebrations and never looked back. Draco didn’t hate Harry, not like he did when they were still in school and enemies. It was laughable, the things he thought were reasons to hate him; a half-blood, muggle-raised, and too self-righteous by half and completely uninterested in Draco’s friendship. Malfoy’s always got what they wanted and if they didn’t they just bought it. But, there Harry was, eyes the size of saucers taking in Hogwarts and completely unimpressed with what Draco offered.
“You aren’t to blame Draco.” Harry using his first name caused him to clench his fists. His fingers dug into his palms and he stood abruptly.
Harry had confessed on one of their many make out sessions that he wasn’t a complete virgin and knew his way around the bedroom. For once, Draco believed him. Only because he was too star-struck by how Harry moved. Even under the rough layer of lean muscle and bruises, Harry moved with a sinewy softness. Arching and rocking against Draco.
He shook his head and backed away to leave. “Just let him be.” Lucius’ words of praise fell away as he swept through the halls to leave. The numb spread through him. If Lucius was pathetic then he was a coward for running away.
The ache disappeared as they touched. Or his ache did. The one he felt whenever alone and trapped beneath the trauma of his memories and life. And it felt like Harry was chasing the same thing. A touch to forget. A touch to remind that he was alive despite it all.
Harry shook his head. His hair was shorter and just covered the top of his scar. It was still unruly but looked like it had been tamed in some way to stay in place.
The loving hand belonged to his mother. She sat facing the window. A blanket covered her lap as one of the house elves floated a pot of tea to a table next to her. Draco entered and sat in a chair beside her. He reached out to take her hand. The bones shifted beneath her soft papery skin and he lifted it to his lips to kiss.
After a while, they left in silence. The sun was set and the lights of the manor cast a glow upon the grounds. Harry knocked his elbow into his and Draco looked over.
Draco’s hands were shoved into his jacket. While Harry’s tie hung loose and in disarray around his neck. The light outside the pub was dim. Diagon Alley; a ghost town on a weeknight.
“If the chat doesn’t involve the use of the owl or mother’s letter, we have nothing further to discuss.”
He sighed. “It’s not that simple. Right now with some of the Death Eaters still out there, there’s not much free time while in training to do anything other than search and train.” Harry’s shoulders slumped and he suddenly downed the rest of his glass. There was an exhaustion that permeated from him. Draco had avoided looking too hard but he caught the rumpled cloak and tie, the faded circles under his eyes, the weariness that peaked out at him behind glasses.
Lucius was a fallen angel. There was no more posturing or divine right written into the lines of his body. This was a man who had flown too close to the sun and burned on the way down. Draco tasted bile on his tongue.
“Look, I thought you’d like to know a little bit more about my life. Actually talk, but I can see you’re busy being rotten, still.”
“Hey, hold on there.” Harry touched his arm. It was light, careful, and not trying to cage him in, but hold him steady. “I’m trying to help you get home.”
“Yes, yes. Of course.” Lucius grasped the letter, his fingers a vice grip around the paper. “It’s better that way.”
The following Tuesday, when he entered and headed to his usual stool, there were not-so-oblivious green eyes trained on him. Potter never took a hint. Somehow, Draco found himself sitting across from him. It wasn’t by choice.
As if in afterthought, but completely planned, his hand slid down and traced over the light fuzz just below his navel, before it dipped below the waistband of his pants. He was half hard as his fingers found the top of his shaft and traced upward toward the tip. Draco bit his lip and took the full length of himself into his hand and squeezed. It’s not that he was thinking of Harry as he touched himself, that’s not why he began to, but it was easy for his mind to drift there. Lying in his bed, surrounded by his scent, Draco turned and pressed his nose into the pillow and inhaled.
Draco's hand splayed out across Harry's side. His hand didn't even begin to cover a portion of the bruising. Draco had his share of bruises, but this was too much, even for training. And why wasn’t it magically healed? Whatever “training” they were doing had to be illegal.
Morning light filtered across the back of his eyelids first. A bright annoyance that had Draco groaning. His body felt heavy and ached as it woke him. There was noise coming from what sounded like the kitchen. The sound of someone trying to be quiet but failing because Draco seemed to hear even the tiniest of sounds. It was all too much.
He was still processing everything. The numbness was there and while he wanted to wash it away with his forget-me elixirs, Draco merely shrugged. “Don’t apologize. However we got there, it needed to happen...I just couldn’t do it on my own, so thank you.” He knew once the numbness went away the ache would hurt. Lucius had no power over him anymore though, Draco hoped that meant the ache would lessen.
His lips were raw and red and Harry’s didn’t look much better. They were both breathing hard and Draco was so hard beneath his robes it was painful. Harry must have felt it because Draco wasn’t hiding it. Found it a little satisfying to feel Harry’s own pressed back against him.
Harry flashed a smile. "You forget I have a pretty good track record with your father...I bet I can get it under two"
Harry bore it well enough, a grimaced smile on his face while his eyes dodged around in search of an out. That was Draco’s queue to leave. Slipping some money on the bar, he sidled off his stool. He should have known the motion would attract attention. Harry looked too much like a wounded animal, face on the verge of panic, when their eyes met. Sour apple green and rimmed with nothing but sleeplessness and apathy. They weren’t far off from what Draco remembered. The apathy was new, but not being the saviour of the world every year probably led to a less exciting life.
“I hope you are not suggesting I have some sort of dalliance with Harry Potter!” Some things were unfathomable and that was one of them.
too much when Draco finally lined himself up and thrust into him. Harry’s hands were vices on his hips, pulling him in, as if not concerned about his own comfort. But Draco would have none of that, he wanted slow. Wanted to savor every second and he did.
He kept laughing, but buried it into one of the cushions on the couch he’d fallen on. Soft footfalls drifted around him and away. Draco turned his head and caught the faint outline of Harry as he slipped down a dark hallway. He heard a sigh and felt something fall over him but then it all blurred to blackness.
The bed was unmade. The blankets bunched up and looked like they’d been tossed to one side of the bed in frustration. He edged closer to the side where Harry slept, the pillows still had the impression of his head on them.
Before he could finish the sentence or his next thought, Harry returned and eased into the seat beside him. Harry squeezed his knee, a blink and you miss it touch, but one that left him rethinking.
Because it was his place, Draco went back to the bar to drink again the next day. There were no more Potter sightings. His shoulders relaxed. Drinking always tasted better alone.
It was odd to kiss and touch someone who was crying. It didn’t stop the erection that pressed hard against his pants. Despite Draco’s best efforts, Harry naked and crying did it for him. That was probably something he needed to mention in whatever type of therapy he needed. But not now.
Every drink slid down his throat and settled warm inside him. Fuel to his already crackling flame. Someone said something funny and Draco was rolling. The tears collecting in his eyes swept away in the laughter until he blinked and Harry swam to the surface. Of course, he was there. Draco rarely ever got what he wanted without Potter ruining it.
Lucius’ lips curled, insulted. His arm raised in a familiar swing and Draco would hate himself for flinching if he weren’t numb at the moment. Before the backhand could land, Lucius’ body froze and the guard pulled the door open with a loud swing.
“We’ve all grown up since school, you know. And I know you can’t wait to speak to Hermoine. No one talks as much about magical theory as you two. Why didn’t I know you were such a nerd?”
His jaw almost dropped, it was a close thing, but years of etiquette left him to only stare in shock before he blurted, “Mother!”
There were several things Draco tried to process all at once. But the one his brain stuck on had him setting his tea down with a sharp clack. His mother frowned in disapproval, but Draco ignored it.
Lucius received a thin lipped reply from him. Draco’s visits were not for Lucius’ benefit, but for his mother. Prison had shown how truly cruel his father could be. The only way he’d write to her was if Draco personally came to receive the letters. Draco had put that demand to the test, but he’d seen how his mother wilted when he’d held off on a visit for a few days. Draco couldn’t handle any more haunted looks, so he visited.
He sighed and nodded. “Yeah, I guess. But, I’m almost through with the program. They’ll send me on my first assignment soon.”
Harry’s eyebrows pinched together and he had the audacity to look upset. “Oh, yeah...I think someone in my class is taking secret photos and sending them to the Prophet.
The powder was a baby blue. It looked like sugar and tasted like rain. When Draco took it, everything melted away and left him feeling like an electric current. Giddiness enveloped him, and high off the buzz, he wound his way back to his bar. Because it was his bar, not any of the other forlorn patrons, or stupid fucking Harry Potter’s.
Draco’s hands ran along the banister as he made his way to the sun room. He stood at the threshold and inhaled deeply. His mother always told him to remain calm and poised, her voice almost always critical but affectionate, “No one likes an angry young man.”
His mother was tucked away in the small ante-library today. Curled next to a window with a book in her hand. From a distance she looked peaceful. Up close she was frail. Her hair was pinned in a frizz-free bun, not a stray hair in sight. She had make-up and a large flowy cardigan on.
“I saw Harry Potter recently.” The name dropping was usual fodder, but Draco wished he could take back that particular name. Rather than frown, like Draco expected, Narcissa just inclined her head slightly and a corner of her mouth drifted upward into a light smile.
Harry raised his hand in silent surrender. He looked at Draco with wounded eyes. “Sorry, I wasn’t implying that you would want to.”
Footsteps shuffled closer and he heard an exasperated sigh from Harry. Almost as patronizing as Granger was in school. “I wasn’t the one who forced you to get high or drunk last night.”
Harry shrugged and had the audacity to laugh, a sheepish grin appearing on his face. “I don’t know...I thought it would be easier, after all the fighting, to do more of it.”
“How do you think?” His tone was more brittle than he intended, but Draco willed the time and distance of their lives to hide it. Harry didn’t know the Draco of today, or then, and it was the only thing that allowed him to swallow down emotions he was definitely not going to examine.
Three months in and Harry still hadn’t commented on the bergamot scented body wash nestled in a nook of the shower. Harry’s hair had never been softer either, after using Draco’s far too expensive shampoo and conditioner set, and Draco made it a point to run his hands through it while Harry gasped beneath him. If he curled against Harry’s back and inhaled just to smell it and
Harry kept his hand on Lucius' shoulder, keeping him down. Draco half wanted to see how the guards would respond, but he heard no movement outside of the cell.
Draco did look tired. He was too thin now, had bags under his eyes, and always some kind of substance in his veins. Rather than respond to that, he shook his head. “It will definitely not be Potter. I have much better taste than that.”
Harry didn’t say anything. The bed shifted beside him, Draco reached out and brushed Harry's hand. "I'm sorry I was such a prat in school to you."
“When I was younger, we would often travel during the summer. My parents liked to meet up with old friends. I’d either be shunted with the other children, or often, I made whatever nanny I had take me out. In Seville, my favorite spot in the park was the fountain of lions. Sometimes I’d throw coins. Do the whole wishing thing.” He’d blurted it out before he wondered why he was sharing at all. A shrug and glance up and away, Draco was careful not to meet Harry’s eyes.
Harry kissed like he didn’t have much experience. It was entirely too much tongue. But Draco could handle that. His hand came to rest on Harry’s waist, the perfect thing to do because it elicited a soft exhale from him.
Draco laughed. “Careful, Potter. Or I’ll really make you wish you didn’t work tomorrow.” It was the sort of challenge he’d have thrown around in school. Harry’s gaze sharpened and the biting retort he would have given back then only pulled his lips tight across his teeth. It was a grim smile, one he wasn’t used to seeing, and one Draco looked away from. It was too determined for the soft buzz of the night around them.
Harry just stared back at him, shrugged, and hunched away as if he could hide what Draco already saw. "Just got a little rougher. It’s nothing. Training.”
“Not too tough...just.” Harry squeezed his eyes shut and pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Not what I expected.” Draco narrowed his eyes with a calculated shrewdness.
Not knowing how to respond, Draco drank his tea as well. His mother’s gaze rested on him and her eyebrows lifted imperceptibly. There was something almost shrewd and thoughtful as she looked. He cleared his throat and lifted his shoulders in a nonchalant shrug. “He was as unkempt as ever. I don’t think he knows what personal hygiene is. Living with all those muggles and such.”
Harry’s shoulder lifted in a shrug. A curious squint and a half smile played out on his face. “What do you care? Aren’t you all about not living to work?”
“Lucius.” Harry pressed his hand against Draco’s back, an anchor, before he stepped forward, between Draco and his father. “You should remember why you’re here and why you aren’t rotting somewhere less comfortable.”
Pride was not a virtue and Lucius was his pride. The set of his jaw and hardening of his cold grey eyes were answer enough for Draco. He then spat at Draco’s feet, the harshness of it amplified by the cell. Draco turned and walked out and didn’t glance back.
“Sorry, I just.” Harry shrugged and grimaced. “I didn’t get a chance to talk to you after everything...and I—”
Draco brought his glass the rest of the way to his lips and finished it off. He had no intention of catching Potter’s attention. The war had ended with clear winners and his lot had fallen far. It burned. Losing always did. Although, a year of running after the war, another year of courtrooms and plea deals, and a few more years of current listlessness helped ease that burn. All that was left was the gaping wound of a destroyed family and a mountain of shame.
His mother merely hummed and sipped from her tea again. After a moment, she spoke over the rim. “Oh, and don’t forget to write to your father, dear. He said he misses you.”
about anything?” There was a red hot flush on his face, he could feel it, willed Harry to see it as the alcohol and not the rise of volatile anger he held. Draco was past this. Past caring about what Harry fucking Potter thought of him.
Harry stared at his arm long enough that the back of Draco’s neck prickled. He pulled his arm back and green eyes lifted to meet his. Shame, hot and ugly spiked down his throat. It was his daily reminder to not forget who he was.
“Whaddyadoin?” It was getting harder to talk and Draco’s mouth tasted like cotton. He smacked his mouth together and attempted to push off the wall and away from Harry.
Harry said nothing as they passed up the stairs and away from the double doors of the ballroom. Draco met his eyes unflinching. It was their past, Draco's past, and he was done ignoring it.
Harry’s torn robes piled onto the floor while Draco fit his hands over skin. There were some new bruises since last time, maybe from what brought Harry here, wounded and raw, but Harry looked at him with red-rimmed eyes. The haunted vacant stare replaced with a need that Draco didn’t know if he could meet. He tried.
Draco should have been shocked but wasn't. He only laughed, spellbound and not at all surprised. “Only you could make my mother like you more.”
Draco knocked his shoulder against Harry’s. “It sucks that you really are cool. I was hoping all the dumb stunts you pulled in school were over-exagerrated, but nope. You’re just cool and brave, dumb Gryffindors.”
The small talk was light, easy fair about the weather, some childhood stories that Draco wished his mother had forgotten, while the tea and little cucumber sandwiches flowed freely.
Draco shrugged. He didn’t believe him.“Why don’t you just find out who it is? From what I remember, that's what you and your little band of followers lived for.”
But Harry brought back a big bowl of popcorn instead. He settled on the couch in the space Draco had left open. He was mollified as Harry offered him some. They ate and guessed different trivia questions. Despite having lived with muggles, Harry was horrid at it.
It wasn't until the lights were off that they talked. The darkness hid some of their tears but none of the fears. The talking eased some of them. Harry drifted off first, tired and spent from the night. Left with his thoughts, Draco knew neither of them were fixed. He wasn't sure they could be, but it was better, having him there.
It was a sharp reminder and Draco forced back a grimace. Today was a good day. The conversation and soft bright lines of Narcissa’s smile almost made him forget. Narcissa was stuck in the past. He wondered when that would end, when Draco suddenly aged ten years in front of her? Draco smiled, tight-lipped, and stood to leave. He placed a kiss on her forehead and murmured, “Have a good day, mother.” Her smile softened and she touched his hand as he pulled away.
Draco laughed and called for another round. “This.” A server brought more drinks and he downed them as well. “I tinker with a few things too. Don’t you know the Malfoy name is piss now? No one’s got any use for a former Death Eater and traitor to purebloods. I’m twice the fuck up!”
Harry didn’t rankle, only shook his head. “Well, if you’re such an expert on how to get on with life, what do you do?”
Narcissus shot her son a knowing look and continued on with Harry’s Quidditch reverie. Draco had no idea his mother kept up with anything related to Quidditch or the news for that matter. Apparently, the Cannons were the expected winners of the cup this year. He tuned some of it out and went between staring too long at Harry, to realizing he was staring too long, to hastily looking away.
Harry gripped his waist with such familiarity it made Draco swallow before he could speak. “Potter, are you a bad influence?”
It wasn’t a conscious decision to stay. Draco just ended up sleeping most of the day, eating a brown banana over the sink, and then guzzling from an old orange juice carton he’d found in the back of Harry’s fridge. Which was a bad idea, and completely uncharacteristic, because he was always a stickler about expiration dates of food he consumed. But it helped his hangover to abate and left him with enough clarity to snoop around Harry’s flat.
The taste was somewhere between bitter and more bitter but Draco didn’t drink for the taste. Although, when he used to break into his parent’s liquor cabinet there had been a small bottle of something that tasted like chocolate. It wrecked him for two days and caused him to hiccup bubbles. His mother had worried, voice shrill as she scolded him, while his father had been furious. There was never a time when he wasn’t. The words,
He let the buzz of three drinks carry him. He wanted to slink away and nurse his wounds, like any other night, but wherever The Boy Who Lived was the world revolved around him.
Draco ignored the red rimmed eyes and sallow cast to Harry’s skin, would rather chalk it up to Harry being abysmal at trivia than the tale-tell signs of someone running on fumes. He had perfected the art of ignoring problems.
There was that familiar shrug again and a glint of mischief Draco was finally on the right side of. Harry pulled him in for another kiss.
Catching himself, Draco only rolled his eyes. “Some of us can’t get by on luck and charm all the time. I have to study.” Harry had talked him into signing up for a few magical classes, refreshers before Draco went back to finish his final year.
“When your letter is ready, just send it to me by owl. I’ve rented one for the rest of this year.” He turned to leave, but Lucius grasped the sleeve of his shirt. Draco tried to wrench away, but the years of misusing his body caught up with him. Lucius was stronger and held on.
Draco’s lips pursed. Looking at his father’s narcissistic grin, the contempt in his eyes, Draco wondered if he ever loved anyone other than himself. “If you want us to leave, we will.”
Harry blew air out with a heavy sigh and pushed his glasses up. “Well, I’m in training to be an auror now. I’m almost done with my third course.”
“Shut up.” Harry says, “I like it because it appears to be hard and stiff, but when you touch it,” Harry stretches out his hand and touches Draco’s hair. “It’s soft. It’s a bit like you, actually.”
Every day your absence cuts my skin and I can’t be strong when I feel like I might collapse in any second, when I feel like your void will be too much for me to bear. When I think you are the air and I have nothing else left to breathe.
Potter didn’t do anything at first, just frowned at him. Draco felt ridiculous but it wasn’t really Potter, so he didn’t have to worry about anything.
“Maybe you are,” Harry rolls his eyes and pulls Malfoy’s shoulders so it will be harder for him to run away again “But you don’t have to be one about this specifically.”
“I know you think that. I’m trying to figure out what I think.” He held her gaze for a while, until she sighed and relaxed on her chair.
“Actually,” Malfoy mutters “I’d like to see what would have happened if we had been friends since the beginning.” And he is gone before Harry can answer anything.
“I just don’t know how I’ll deal with him being there, forever.” Draco admits after a while. “And my mother, alone.”
It was the first time Draco Malfoy tried to brew Amortentia. He didn't intend to use it, it was stupid and it wasn’t like he had anyone to use it on. He was only doing it for academic purposes, might earn him a few extra N.E.W.Ts points and maybe they would save him from the Dark Lord’s wrath once he realized that Draco had been spending the time he should be focusing on killing Dumbledore brewing love potions instead.
And he was there. He was there every week, in that small cell, talking to me, offering me chocolate cake, because he knew I loved it. And I tried so hard not to fade away during the other 6 days when I didn’t see him, I tried so hard to keep myself strong for that one hour when I’d see his green eyes, his clumsy hands trying to tell me about something that happened during the week, his shirt that was too big for him. When he was there, I could even forget that I was on Azkaban, and that I’d never leave, and that someday he’d just stop going there. He’d stop, and I’d stop too, perhaps, because I couldn’t imagine to live inside the void without him there to try to take me back to somewhere real.
“It’s not my biggest secret that I like blokes.” Draco laughs, “Maybe my biggest secret is that… Ok, Potter, let’s play a game, alright?” Harry feels that Draco has turned around to face him, and he decides to do the same, the blanket on their laps now.
“I’m ready.” Malfoy says and when Harry turns around, Malfoy is wearing a red shirt. The red shirt that Harry got him for Christmas.
I tried to be selfless for the first time in my life and I tried to push him away, but his eyes begged me not to, and his warm, calloused hands were on my shoulders, I was crying and so was he, as he promised me he would fix it… he would take me home. But I was home, wasn’t I? Being with him was being at home, and I wanted him, I wanted him all the time.
“You didn’t ask me a question.” Harry rolls his eyes, “I asked you a question and then you asked me back, like we always do.”
You are gone and I can’t breathe but I have to, I have to let myself be filled up with oxygen every second because I am human, and you were human. That’s why you died, because you needed to breathe but you
“Yes yes, Potter, I am.” Malfoy is impatient “Big deal. I figured that every New Year that I spent wearing black lead to a horrible year, so I decided to see if the problem was the colour.”
“She really cares about you. She lied to Voldemort like that and…” Harry says, but he thinks he is being obvious. Of course that his mother cares about him. It’s his
“Well, Mr Ollivander, I’ve come to… apologize.” Ollivander widened his eyes. “I’m really sorry that you were kept captive in my house, I’m sorry about the way you were treated, and if there’s anything I can do for you, ask away.” He said quickly, but it was easier than he had anticipated.
“Auror training too tough for you, Potter?” The biting taunt slipped out with ease. Harry’s gaze fell at the words and he shook his head imperceptibly.
Lucius’ face contorted into a mask of rage and sudden desperation. “No! Draco, please! Tell him I was only playing. You know I love you, son.” His words turned to groveling and Draco had to look away.  All Draco could think was
The pub lay half in shadows and half in smoke. On a Tuesday, the only patrons were the weekday haunts. People waried from work and life and only there to drink until the minutes turned into a blur. It was just as well for him. It was easy to get lost behind a glass. Here, with other bodies just trying to get by, he wasn’t his past or his name. The bartender, Randy, inclined his head toward him and dropped his eyes to Draco’s glass. It was empty again. He gave a solid nod and it refilled with a brief spell and simple flick of Randy’s wand. Magic had some good uses after-all.
It took some finagling but Harry was going to join him at school, on more of a care of magical creatures kind of role. It made him laugh, the thought of Harry mucking through the kestrel stables. But he could picture him, kind and patient, explaining why some could see them and others couldn't. Neither of them had been back to Hogwarts in years. The halls were haunted for him, but Harry had smiled with such unexpected happiness when he talked about showing Draco some of his favorite haunts, ones that he’d never been given access to, and it was hard to be afraid.
Draco kissed him until Harry had to push him away to catch his breath. When he leaned in again, Harry met him halfway.
Draco hated Harry just the same, found it even better that he got off to him in his bed, and liked the fact he’d never know. He had a thought to leave some evidence behind but kept some of his self-preservation intact and got up to clean up in the bathroom.
A week later Draco showed Harry his childhood home. This time the manor was spotless. Only his mother and a few house elves were inside, but the horror show that they had both lived through followed them down the halls. Draco was rethinking the whole idea.
Draco wanted him to do or say something, get angry, shove him and tell him to piss off, anything that would have him reacting to Draco the way he was used to. Instead, Harry laughed at his jokes, held his arm when stumbled, and even tossed blankets on him when he crashed for the nth time on his couch.
Instead, Drake’s fingers gripped tighter around Harry. He wasn’t fragile and Draco was sure he could never break him. But Harry slumped against him with the fervor of someone desperately screaming for help. Draco had been there. And Harry had been the one to slowly pull him out of the permafrost of his life.
Whatever the case, Draco was second guessing every decision he’d ever made to get him to this point. And there were a lot of them.
Her gaze took a moment to focus as she turned her head to smile at him. “I’m well, thank you Draco. How was school? Are you excited for your holiday?”
At the gates, Draco looked over at Harry. He was already staring back at him. Draco swallowed and slipped on his usual bravado. "10 quid that he’ll insult you in the first five minutes."
The larger of the men, with a red blotchy complexion, grinned and slid a napkin across the table. Harry only stared at it, before he looked up once more to catch Draco’s gaze. Except, Draco was at the door. Potter was already his own hero and Draco wasn’t about to rescue him from an over excited fan.
Draco wasn’t sure how Harry had talked his way into joining him on his Azkaban day, but here he was walking beside him as they marched up the stone steps.
Harry wasn’t shy. 6 years in classes together and he’d watched him speak out of turn countless times. Harry made it known what he thought, so Draco wanted to scoff at the shy act. He watched him swallow and take several quick drinks.
His fingers whitened as he tightened his grip on Harry’s shoulders to pry him a little apart. Harry was motionless in his grip. The dim light made it difficult for him to see. The wet glint from Harry’s eyes gave nothing away except his attention. It fixed on Draco, too aware for Draco not to flinch under it. Draco was a coward and under Harry’s intense gaze it was hard not to be one. But his voice didn’t waver, except as it fell away in quiet fear at the end.
Draco had a lot of bad ideas, some he ignored, others he ran from the consequences afterwards. This was a bad idea, but he still sank onto his back on Harry’s bed. It was a normal bed, not that he thought the
Draco felt Harry come first. Felt the warm squeeze of him as Draco thrust, felt the even hotter burst of cum that landed between them, and allowed himself to finally believe this could work between them. He came with a groan, heard Harry’s answering own, and almost wanted to stay curled in their mess after. They didn't. After wiping himself and Harry clean, he returned to bed.
Draco’s jaw clenched. His mother held on to her sanity with wisp like strength. The longer his father was imprisoned the more she slipped away. Watching her disappear made him hate Lucius. Draco carried that hate, dripping with shame for being Lucius’ son—for being exactly like him—and it burned like a scalding wound, forever tender and unhealed.
Harry glowered at him. Rather than disdain, it was a soft exasperation that Draco was growing fond of even if it was always aimed at him.
It smelled a little stale, definitely needed a wash, but Draco could smell Harry on the sheets too. Sweat, a light musk, and pine needles, Draco half wondered if Harry was rolling around in a forest. It wasn’t a bad smell.
“Have you been possessed? This is the first time I’ve ever heard you complain about being late.” Harry glared and ignored his comment, too used to Draco’s taunting.
Draco watched Harry’s hand drop like a lead weight and fingers grip the edge of the table. His lips pressed into a thin line but Draco shifted to sit down slowly again. If Harry wanted to talk he would have to be the one to do it. Draco did not have any demons he needed to chase. He raised his eyebrows, giving his best
A laugh bubbled from him, too loud and off for the moment. Tears formed and he wiped them away before they turned into something more. “Don’t joke, Lucius. You’ve never been that funny.”
The curl of disdain was expected. "Draco, what a surprise. Normally I enjoy your visits. But why did you bring trash with you?" The filter was off.
Harry shuddered out a breath as Draco thrusted. He eased in every inch of himself and then began a slow methodical movement. One that left him shaking. It was a test of will, to stay slow, to feel Harry beneath. It wasn’t until Harry pulled him down for a kiss, hot and desperate, that he thrust faster.
Sometimes Draco would apparate to Harry’s flat and laze around all day, continue his winning streak on muggle trivia, wank in Harry’s bed, and scrounge through what little food the other had. Harry, for his part, would always ask what Draco was doing, make a noncommittal sound, look for something to eat—see Draco finished off the last of his food—and would order takeout for them both.
There wasn’t time for a reaction except to feel Harry lean in, fast and with perfect intent. Draco knew what Harry was going to do but still was shocked when their lips touched. Practiced but still clumsy in the moment. They were both too emotional and hot like livewires. It was raw, and hurt a little to finally get to this point after so many tragic and lonely years. But they kept kissing, alternating being gentle and rough. Soft hands in hair, over sides, under robes, fingers digging in to pull closer, not rough enough to bruise, but desperate. Clingy.
He was better. Always had been. The brave one, the confident one, the one who loved fearlessly and endlessly. Draco poured himself into Harry then. He held him and began a feverish whisper. All the thoughts he’d never voiced before. Of how Harry was loved beyond measure. Kinder than anyone Draco had met in his life. Selfish too. But in the fiercest way possible. Because Harry was everything Draco wished to be and everything Draco wanted.
Draco tossed the book he’d been skimming to the side. His eyes wandered to the clock again. It was half past one. Usually he’d be asleep by now or down some rabbit hole project, but Harry had agreed to come over after his shift. He wasn’t known for being on time, so Draco wasn’t worried, but usually there was a call or an owl, something that said he would be late.
Azkaban was a cold desolate place. Even with the new reforms, nothing could hide what it was. The outside stood grand and foreboding, daring anyone to challenge its dominance. Even with the dementors somewhere hidden away in its belly, Draco felt the chill seep into him.
Harry sighed and got up too. He looked defeated and Draco wanted to know why. He stilled as Harry just stared at him. A cutting kind of defiance in his eyes, even a little accusatorial.
Draco hovered above Harry, watched every hitch and stutter of movement so he could crook his finger just right, ease him open with two steady fingers, and watch Harry come apart.
His jaw clenched and he bit his tongue. An acidic remark would only upset her, so he shifted the conversation.
The Malfoy money had purchased certain privileges. Lucius was still in a cold damp cell. However, it was slightly bigger than an average one. And Lucius had more amenities, a couple books, paper, non-lethal quills, and an odd knick-knack or two that his mother had sent as gifts while Lucius was “away.” From his father’s incessant ramblings, he also had better food. The prison reforms Granger had set her mind to, only three years out from school, had somehow made their way to Shacklebolt and passed. It was impressive for a muggleborn.
Draco shook his head and reached to push Harry’s arm off. It was too much effort and instead his hand fell against Harry’s wrist and stayed. “Nodontwanna.”
Draco rolled his eyes but it brought a smile to his face, of course Harry was well versed in how odious Lucius really was, still, Azkaban had made him sharper with bitterness. If Harry thought he was bad before, time alone in a cell made him worse. Rounding the corner, the patented white blond hair was seen first, when they reached the outer cell, Draco noted how his father's eyes slid from him to Harry.
Lucius ignored Harry altogether, almost ignored Draco as he turned to fiddle with some useless parchment on his desk.
Another, just of Dumbledore, made him pause. Draco grimaced and flipped it to face the wall, a soft “hmph” from it ignored as he walked toward Potter’s room. It was definitely rude to snoop in Harry’s room, but he was bored, and a little spiteful.
“Apologize to your son. You don’t deserve his forgiveness, but if he wants to give it, fine. Apologize to him, if you want any hope of keeping him in your life.”
Draco clasped his hands together and tried not to look at Harry. It was stupid to bring up that story. He was a little shit as a child. Insolent and vain. Finally glancing up again, Harry met his gaze and Draco didn’t find sympathy. Not that he wanted it, but Harry held his gaze like the story meant something to him. Draco swallowed because it shouldn’t mean anything.
“Don’t tell your father this, but I think you two could be great friends. I know your Slytherin friends all have superior breeding, but sometimes you need a little Gryffindor fun.” It was a rare day to see her so playful that Draco struggled to respond. He settled for questioning her, curious of this particular past.
“Well, because...I can’t not do something...I was really bad after, you know...Ron and Hermione helped, but they had to force me to get out of the house—my room.”
Draco didn’t have traditions anymore or a life plan. But he did have a routine. It involved drinking, visiting his mother, and necking with Harry.
Draco shrugged. "Even if it's true? I know I'm a fuck up." Draco raised his hand to stop Harry from protesting. "It's okay. I'm allowed to say that about myself. I've known it for a while. I—” He cut himself off. Self-reflecting was hard enough, the idea of changing was even more daunting.
Instead, Draco sighed and sat down, facing away. He was tired of running and ignoring his issues. Tired of denying himself a future. Turning his head, not enough to glance back at Harry but enough that his soft words could be heard.
“I don’t need your fucking forgiveness or pity Potter!” The words ripped from him in a scathing retort and he blinked back the tears that blurred his vision.
Draco was having a hard time focusing and some of Harry’s words slid through him. Concern or maybe accusation dripped in his tone, but Draco didn’t know or care. Harry grasped at his shoulder and squeezed, hard. The touch was a lighting bolt. Draco’s gaze caught on the lighting bolt scar. Harry’s hair was shorter now, the scar finally on display for the world to see. His hand lifted and he was halfway to touching when Harry’s voice finally hooked into him.
The fear and desperation of Harry and his friends lived within the walls. Sometimes, Hermione’s screams chased him down the halls and the memories bled into his dreams. A dark part of him, the one that fed his guilt and shame, half wished he’d told Bellatrix. Just to see the look in Harry’s eyes—to see the defeat in that sharp green gaze. He woke to visions of Harry’s swollen and bloody face, the words “it’s him,” an echo of what could have been that jolted him awake. But, Malfoy manor was where he belonged. His ancestral home and coffin.
“Draco, hey—” Harry kept some space between them, cautious. Draco had never seen him so cautious, like he was dealing with a wounded animal.
