Harry spent the rest of the day in his chamber, thinking. If Malfoy liked Astoria, that’s fine. Maybe he didn’t like her, and he was being nice with the Greengrass. He was probably doing it to please his mother. He would not marry that girl, even if he liked her. He wouldn’t do it because it would annoy his father.
“He was nervous, but he kept his cool.” said Ron. “Does that mean that you were already a professional when you were 13?” he asked Viktor. “Are you 30 now, right?
“Really? I always thought you would like that sort of attention. It will piss off your dad.” Said Harry, smirking. “But I don’t want that, either…yet. What sort of rules would you like.”
Draco could only notice that his mother looked paler than usual. She smiled at him, she meant it as a reassuring smile, but Draco thought it was forced.
Viktor Krum invited Hermione and her inner family to Rumania for his birthday. She refused since it was the same day as her daughter’s birthday. It wasn’t the only reason. They both knew it. Ron wasn’t acting weird or jealous, and Hermione didn’t want to change that. But it changed.
“I tried to make apple sauce for Teddy once, but Andromeda had to guide me the entire process. Teddy liked it. But I can’t cook, I never had to.”
While Ron was on his way to Grimmauld Place, Hermione had arrived at the Leaky Cauldron, where Viktor was already waiting. She started talking about her plan, but Viktor noticed something was wrong, so he asked her. She told him. He saw tears forming in her eyes, but he kept quiet.
Harry knocked on Neville’s door and since he didn’t answer Harry assumed that he was already asleep. Harry didn’t know that once the feast was over, Neville had gone to the Leaky Cauldron. In the end, Draco was the one who accompanied him with Hagrid.
“Sorry. I think school will be nice once I start at Hogwarts, that’s were my dads teach.” Harry was so overwhelmed by Teddy saying this about him and Draco, that he ignored the Hogwarts part. He was happy for sure, but he was also worried that Teddy would forget about his actual dad, even though they talk constantly about Remus.
“Not really. We would have to talk about it, the three of us. But no.” Answered Ron, in the jealous tone that was reserved for his wife.
“Oh, what am I going to do with the two of you. Harry, I think Draco might love you. He honestly is acting like that because he is worried about Teddy. Probably he’s still worried about his reputation and his family. Don’t worry about it. Wait a bit longer and then talk to him again, you still have a chance.”
“It wasn’t your fault, was it?” -Said harry, looking around the garden. – “I wanted to ask you if you really did not recognize me, that time.”
“Well, it could have been anyone, maybe the Malfoys figure it out by themselves. You two weren’t exactly discrete about your relationship.” Said Neville.
Ron went to Grimmauld Place the muggle way, by walking and by bus. He definitely didn’t get lost, he wanted more time to think.
On Thursdays, Teddy only has one class: History of Magic. The ghost Binns was still the professor and he gave his students a surprise quiz the first Thursday after the holidays. Teddy failed. He didn’t cry, but he wanted to.
about Malfoy. Really. He looked among the Slytherin students and at the high stands where most grown ups sit. Maybe he wasn’t coming. He never said he would come. Once harry stopped looking, the players came out and everyone cheered even louder.
Harry started laughing. it was a cute photo. Andromeda was on the background with a worried face. Teddy was smiling and clearly enjoying it. Maybe he would be a seeker. Harry could picture the games along with the Weasleys. But maybe that would be too much pressure for Teddy.
“Oh no, she’s going to kill me. She wanted to wait at least 12 weeks, and she wanted to tell our parents first. Don’t say anything, I know it’s a lot to ask but please, you both have to keep the secret.”- begged Ron.
“Besides that. He thinks it can help his image. He still believes that pure-bloods are better than everyone else. So does my mother. But she came to the conclusion, that even if that’s true, it shouldn’t matter, that she should treat the rest with pity, maybe even kindness.” -said Malfoy, looking ashamed.
They kept looking at each other each time they enjoyed something about the game. Then they would look at Teddy, who was always talking with Victoire. They would tease him about it later.
“That’s what I said. Come inside, I’ll make you tea.” – They get into the house and were sitting in the dining room, none of them talking. Harry was drinking his tea.
“Yes, I also bought Teddy a decent birthday cake. But look” – Draco said, taking out a paper and handing it to Harry. - “Teddy got a 97 on his math quiz.”
“She put a love potion on them.”- said Harry, smiling at Neville. – “Let’s go with Slughorn, he’ll have an antidote.”
“Can’t you do that tomorrow? You have the rest of the weekend.” Said Harry, following with to their shared office.
On May of 2002, another Weasley leaved The Burrow. Percy move out to go live in Scotland with Oliver Wood. Oliver was the only one who knew that Percy felt guilty for Fred’s death. Telling Oliver was an accident. It was during the first and only time Percy has ever been drunk. He made Fred laugh, which was clearly a distraction. Maybe if Fred wasn’t distracted, he could have reacted faster. Oliver told him it was stupid to think like that. That didn’t help. But he was the only one Percy could talk to.
“Yes Fleur, but you look nice effortlessly. I’ve seen you play.” said Draco looking at Viktor’s eyes. “You should have expression lines on your face from all the frowning you do when you are deeply concentrated on you game. But you don’t. that’s what I meant when I told you look young.”
Harry spent the two weeks of the Easter holidays at Grimmauld Place, living with Draco. During the easter weekend, Harry and Draco took Teddy to chocolate stores at muggle London. They also took him to an Easter egg hunt and to see the lion king at West End. Teddy fell asleep in the middle of the second act. It was the first musical both Harry and Draco have ever seen. They ended up buying 5 toys for Teddy, 6 t-shirts and 3 mugs.
“Of course, Myrtle. Take your time.”- said Draco, as he and harry left the second-floor girls’ lavatory.
Malfoy was right about saint Valentine’s day. 23 girls and 6 boys gave Harry some kind of gift. Some of the cholate boxes came with a letter. A few of them were quite inappropriate. Harry had to go with Slughorn to be sure the chocolate didn’t contain any love potion. Of the 29 presents he receive, only 11 had a variation of a love potion. Harry gave two boxes to slug horn for his help.
It took Draco until March of 2005 to make a decent treacle tart, by everyone’s standards. Harry gained a few pounds because of it.
Hermione and Ron always reassured him that Harry wouldn’t do that. That he was brave enough to face whatever problems he had. They needed to believe that. Hermione talked to Kreacher, who promised to always keep an eye on him. He removed whatever objects he thought could be used to harm his new master. Harry didn’t notice. Hermione mention to Hagrid that talking about what’s on your mind is essential to what she called the “healing process”. It was progress.
“Your classes star until nine. Right? Go take this to Hagrid, I think he will need it.” -said Draco as he held a larger cup filled with the potion.
You have to stop being so hard on yourself. You made a lot of stupid choices back then. Now you just have to make better ones. You have to, so you can be a better person, otherwise I won’t let you be near Teddy anymore.”
“Why do you care when they arrive? If you want to see a baby go with my niece, and I don’t think you care much about Andromeda, do you? Or is it that you want to see Malfoy, eh? - asked Ron as he pretended to be jealous.
“Again with that” – Interrupted Malfoy. - “Blaise doesn’t want to bother his new stepfather, and I don’t want to bother Andromeda…and im not welcome at my home. – It was easy to talk to him, Malfoy realized. He didn’t want to talk about his personal life with Potter. But it made him feel safe, like he would understand.
Harry learned through Hyperion that his family spent New Year’s Eve at Malfoy manor. Apparently, Hyperion had to spend the day listening to father and Lucius talking about how they both lost their positions after the War. His mother, Daphne and Narcissa were talking among themselves, and his father didn’t let him go with them, because
“Harry! It’s you! I overheard some girls talking about you, and since then I kept wondering when you’d come visit me, I had been very sad, a whole month and not one visit! But you are here now, on my birthday! – Said Myrtle while trying, and failing, to hug Him.
“That little wolf wouldn’t be a problem, on the contrary. You both are already raising the kid together, so you can use him as leverage to keep Potter by your side. If Potter believes that you two breaking up would upset Wolfie, he would never do it.” Said Pansy.
“I am your friend. As your friend it is my job to tell you are an idiot.” Said Draco. “Talk about your feelings with Hermione. Did you hear that?
“Too bad Oliver isn’t here. He would be delighted to see you.”- Said Ron. “By the way, congratulation for winning the world Cup last year.”- As he said this, baby Fred started to cry.
“The accidents I’ve had in my class were very easy to fix. Madam Pomfrey said so. It’s almost time for your class, I’ll let you prepare. You’ll be great.”- he said as he leaved Draco’s office without saying goodbye. He then went to Neville’s office.
Madam Pomfrey cured Draco without trouble to the relief of the students. “Do you see where you went wrong?” asked Draco to the Ravenclaw boy. “Too many rat tails.” He answered and Draco nodded. Harry was silent until Neville took the kids out.
Harry only bought some chocolate frogs, there wasn’t much that he couldn’t get at Hogwarts. Malfoy, on the other hand, bought almost all kind of chocolate, also some liquorice wands, Pixie Puffs, No Melt ice-cream and a Cauldron Cake. Most of it was for Teddy, he claimed.
He forced himself to go with Neville. he “helped” Neville by grading some Herbology papers, even though he had to ask Neville every time if it was fine. When they were done, they played chess. Harry had to teach Neville some basic tactics and tricks. By midnight Neville took Harry to his chamber and gave him tea, which probably had something in it, because Harry fell asleep as soon as he finished it.
“I think it’s funny because it’s the two of you, but Aunty Molly told me about the dumb people that sometimes bother Ginny. And I know my dad had a boyfriend before he married my mum.” He stopped to laugh at how Draco and Harry kept looking at Andromeda, like she had to explain everything.  “You two can talk to me about grown up stuff, I am not dumb”
“You are doing It wrong”- said Malfoy. He came closer to Harry. With one hand, Malfoy was caressing Teddy’s face, with the other, he was holding Harry’s shoulder, for support. “See? This makes him relax.”- said Malfoy, as Teddy slowed his crying.
“…Yes. We are a couple, but we have kept it a secret. We could give an interview with Rita any time, make it public.”
He didn’t write back. What could he write? That he was a bit happy that Malfoy care about Teddy? That he is happy he acknowledges Ginny’s ability as a quidditch player? That him and Ginny are no longer together? Would Malfoy care about that?
“Can’t we celebrate our great-nephew’s birthday? I thought you were a better person, Potter.” Said Lucius.
“…Hermione is doing fine, thanks for asking. Teddy, you are too young for our Explosive Enterprises line. Go look at the Joke products, just as fun
“Thank you, Mrs. Tonks.” -He gave Teddy back to his grandmother and then he left without actually saying goodbye to either of them.
After the classes were over, the four friends went to Hagrid’s home. Madame Maxime was there. She told them that she was supposed to arrive on Monday and that she was to have a proper welcome at the Great Hall, but she wanted to spend some time with Hagrid. Admitting this the four young men made her blush. Hagrid thought it was cute. They each drank a cup of tea before leaving, with a promise from Madame Maxime to let them borrow Hagrid during the next week. Ron mumbled that he wasn’t going to be there next week, but Draco elbowed him in the ribs to keep him silent. They promised not to tell she was already there.
“Give him a break, there is no one better in the whole wizarding world to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts. Good luck on your first day Harry. Just try to be careful, we won’t be there to save you.”
He wanted to cry but not a tear came out. He couldn’t go back to sleep. It was 5:24 am, so he went to his office to grade the homework he didn’t remember he assigned. He didn’t go to the great hall for breakfast, he just ate some chocolate frogs, he was almost done when a letter came into his room. It was from Malfoy.
“I do have a favour to ask of you.” -said Draco, without looking at him. – “I want you to come with me to the Ministry. Today. In about one hour.”
“Really? I don’t think I can be a better person, plus I think Teddy likes me and would be sad if I were to just leave him.
Harry suddenly remembered his talk with Myrtle, so he took a moment to look at Malfoy. He was more attractive than when they were kids, as far as he could tell. Well, if you liked that kind of guys, not that Harry has ever thought about what kind of guys he liked. What was he thinking? Harry focused his attention to Malfoy’s face. To his eyes. They were looking at each other, without talking or looking away. Teddy was pulling Harry’s hair, but he didn’t care, and Draco didn’t even notice how cute that would’ve been. He was looking back at Harry, only focused on him.
He decided to stay in his room, until he heard a knock. It was the professor he didn’t recognize during the sorting ceremony.
“I didn’t leave Teddy alone, you should remember he lives with his grandmother and I’m still going to see him…Now we can see him together.”- Draco patted Harry on the shoulder. – “About my old
Since then, they’ve been taking care of each other. It was an experiment. It was relief. It was comfort. It didn’t mean a thing, for either of them.
“They don’t get much time alone, so I don’t want to interrupt…do you want to bet on who’s going to win?”
January was almost over; it was Tuesday 30. Harry only had four classes on Tuesdays, so he had a free period after lunch. He spent his extra time alone in his chamber. He fell asleep and was 18 minutes late to his class with the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw first years. His school day was over at 6 pm, he waited for the kids that went for personal lessons. He forgot to tell them he wasn’t going to be able to teach them that day, so he just told them to practise with each other.
“Harry teaches Phys Ed. and I teach chemistry.” said Draco, receiving a thankful looked from both cousins.
“…You are right. I shouldn’t have acted on an impulse.”- Harry was looking at the floor, so neither saw the tears forming in each other eyes.
Both harry and Draco spent those two weeks inside Grimmauld Place with Teddy, not really wanting to go out. Draco made breakfast every day, not really improving but always trying. Harry would sit and watch him. Even teddy found it funny to see Draco trying to cook.  The only actual good thing Draco could made now was tea. He would made tea every morning for Harry.
Draco kept thinking about why Neville wanted to leave Grimmauld Place so fast. It was nice living with Harry. Draco had at least two places where he could live that didn’t involve getting back at Malfoy Manor. But Harry’s house was comfortable, and it was rent free. It was at a good location in London. It had nothing to do with the fact he got to spend time with Harry. And besides, it was only two months out of the year where they could actually live together. It wasn’t enough for Draco, but maybe that much time would be tiring for Harry. That’s what Draco was thinking. Still, he wouldn't leave.
“Awkward, as usual. I don’t want to talk about them.” -Said Draco. –“Teddy was trying to bite my father.”
After the party, back at Hogwarts, Teddy received a letter from Victoire telling him how their parents were now arguing constantly. It was a first for her, seeing them like that. And it was because of her, she said. Then she told him that maybe it would be best if she went to Beuxbatons. It was a great school after all. Teddy told her that it was too soon for her to make a decision. He also wrote a letter to Fleur.
“The muggle doctor said we still have two more weeks. They are completely useless.” Said Ron, now hyperventilating.
Luna kept smiling whenever she looked at Ron. Her wife, Ginny, kept frowning whenever she looked at Viktor. She was almost part of the National team, but they selected another player from her team. Luna told her wife about her suspicions to distract her. Ginny thought about it. She looked at her brother, at his face when Hermione approached or when Viktor would leave his side. It made no sense, but it was clear.
“I don’t care about that. Besides, I need to keep an eye on you, since you are now a part of Teddy’s life. There is nothing I could do; you are a part of my life…” -Said Harry.
They talked for an awkward while. He learned that Dudley was working at Grunnings, and Mary was at university studying administration. Harry told them he was a professor in Scotland. Dudley winked at Harry and added that it was a school for “special” kids. Luna told them she was trying to be a journalist. They left before anyone else, Harry was honestly a bit disappointed that the Dursleys didn’t get a chance to talk to Luna.
“At least have the decency to keep it hidden.” Said Lucius. “I can’t believe those rumors are true.”
, they are only afraid of disappointing you. They think you are so smart that if they do something wrong, you would think less of them.”
By midnight, they were able to see a display of fireworks that took place in a nearby muggle city. Narcissa kissed her husband and then her sister and her son, but she restrain herself from doing so with Teddy and Harry. She hugged Teddy and gave Harry a handshake. Lucius didn’t even kiss his son. Just the formal, manly handshake that was required. Harry and Draco were going to kiss each other on the cheek, but due to a miscalculation from both of them,
“Thank you, Mr. Greengrass.” – Said Harry. - “Hey, by the way... Have you meet my friend Draco Malfoy?”
Shacklebolt could tell her the same and she would still be worried because it is Malfoy we are talking about.”- Said Ron
“Don’t listen to them, they are freaks.” He picked her up and she hugged him. “You are the smartest person here.” He took her away and she wave goodbye at Teddy and Harry.
Soon after the birth of Molly and Arthur’s seventh grandchild, Molly started asking Ginny about having a child with Luna. “Well, I don’t know the spell or potion to make that happen with Luna.” Was always Ginny’s answer. The truth was that neither of them were ready to have a child.
“Harry, George said that many girls in the shop were talking about giving you love potions.”- said Ron, giving him one glass.
“Draco? Who is it?” -Andromeda yelled. She approached to the door, putting away her wand. -“Harry…How nice to see you outside of that house! Please, come in.”
“Oh no, I’m sorry, I mean it in general…like, kids think kissing is gross. I always hated it when my parents kissed in front of me.”
“It bothers me that you celebrate like if you already won. The quidditch season isn’t over yet.”- said Draco.
During Remus’s birthday, Harry didn’t feel as sad as in other years. He got to spend the day with Teddy. Harry talked about Remus; how brave he was. He didn’t know if Teddy could fully understand him, but the toddler seemed attentive. Last Saturday was a casual, but happy celebration of Ron’s birthday, this Saturday felt more like a nice memorial. And it was fine.
Harry was confused. He leaved as quickly as he could. Did his students thought that he…but he was with Malfoy. Did they know he was with Malfoy? No, he wasn’t with him, he just wanted to see Teddy. He never once thought about his clothes. What’s wrong with people? He thought about Reta Skeeter. She could write whatever she liked with that. Did she had people just watching him? An article on Witch Weekly about how he had spent the night whit Malfoy wouldn’t be the worst thing written about him. But it was
Draco had fun during the final exams. Some of the first and second years that were brilliant during class got nervous during the examinations. They were afraid of being judged by Draco. It made him glad, somehow, being fear and respected. Then he felt guilty. Although no one really failed.
“Thank you. Speaking of Hogwarts, that’s the reason Im here. I want to ask you to be the professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Given the drunken state they both were, their fall was inevitable. The floor was nice and comfortable, a bit cold, but the cloak kept them warm. “We need to go. My father won’t like it if I get detention.” Said Draco. They were lying on the floor and apparently unaware of it. Their faces and bodies so close to the other. Draco was looking at Harry’s scar on his forehead, he wanted to touch it. When he moved his hand to do it, the sudden shift was enough to eliminate the distance left between them, and finally, they kissed. Their lips were closed, and it was quick. They both managed to smile before they fell asleep, right there on the floor somewhere at the castle.
“What are you talking about, Ronald? And I do care about Andromeda. We are not able to start until they arrive.”-Said Hermione.
The International Confederation of Wizards wanted the schools to form stronger relationships with each other. Exchanging professors for a short time was part of a new program; they also wanted to promote quidditch games between schools, as well as exchange students. First, they were going to focus on continental bonds.
“Professor Potter, how long is this going to take? I have Quidditch practice at 8.”- said Hyperion the moment he came into Harry’s office. Harry had forgotten Hyperion was on the quidditch team as a chaser. He was good. He scored most of the 190 points Slytherin made, at least that’s what he remembers.
“I would never. Even if it would be very educational.”- said Draco. – “Besides, you are more likely to harm them than I am.”
“No, thank you. This is for you.”- Harry gave Kreacher a box of chocolates. - “can you please leave us alone for a moment.”
“Only the ghost and me are supposed to enter the Chamber. But I will make an exception.”- said the Unspeakable. – “If you tell anyone about this, I will denied it. Being Harry Potter won’t make them believe you over me.”- They enter the Death Chamber and the man stood next to the door. - “Just be careful.”- The three of them started walking towards the Veil in the middle of the room. Myrtle stood facing the Veil, with Harry to her right and Draco to her left.
Harry and Draco were eating microwaved dinner on the ground floor dining table. Malfoy doesn’t know how to cook, even with magic, because he never had to do it. Harry knows how to cook, but he just didn’t feel like cooking the muggle war or by using magic. Draco talked about how he was having walks through muggle London and about the little meaningless talks he’s had with some muggles. Talks with strangers, mostly about the weather or sport’s games he didn’t understand. Harry listen carefully so he could catch sarcasm or contempt from Malfoy, but he didn’t.
The first thing Draco changed was the lighting. Then he took out the wallpaper and just painted the place white. He wanted it to look like a modern muggle’s home. Before he changed the furniture, he talked with Kreacher. The only thing he managed, was to convince him not to call him master. Both of them decided the new furniture and appliances out of a muggle’s catalogue.
“Look Harry, I would give this paper a 95%, what do you think?” –when Draco turned to look at Harry, he was already asleep.
“I don’t overwork, I do the appropriate amount of work when I’m supposed to. You knew I had work left to do and insisted on me going to that party. But at least the cake was nice and sweet like…” he stopped, he noticed Harry was smiling.
“Students, this is your new professor, Draco Malfoy. He’s also going to be the head of Slytherin.”- said McGonagall. To this announcement no one clapped. There were only whispers from the students. But Draco was only looking at Harry, smiling.
“I wouldn’t have used that word to describe them, but I guess I did laugh at them a couple of times.”-Said Harry. - “I still don’t understand how that girl accepted to marry Dudley.”
Before Blaise, Draco went to Pansy. Just for relief. It didn’t work, she wasn’t a man. She understood. Blaise also understood. He probably knew more about Draco than Draco himself. He observed. He listens when Draco talks about Potter. Longing. Each time he sounded more mature. Unless he was particularly sad.
By the time Harry woke up, Andromeda was already there. She was in Teddy’s room with him and she was reading a book about Merlin to him.
Harry mentioned that he thought there were only eleven wizarding schools in the world, and that there was only one for the country of the United States of America. “That would be stupid. Go look at a map.” Draco told him.
“Why do you care about them, Professor?”- Hyperion looked directly at Harry’s eyes and didn’t break eye contact.
Back at Hogwarts the nightmares continued. He would wake up alone, ashamed to go with Draco just a few doors away. They decided it would be best not to sleep in the same chamber at Hogwarts, to appear more professional. It wasn’t working that well. Eventually Draco noticed the dark bags under Harry’s eyes, so they went back to sleep together. It was easier for Harry to calm down when he looked at Draco.
“Oh, that’s right. You mention it before. Why did you fight with your father?” - asked Harry, remembering how Malfoy mention it when he went to Andromeda’s house.
“Mom are you crying? You didn’t make such a fuss when I became Auror” -said Ron. Harry wasn’t sure if he was joking or if he was actually jealous. He assumed it was a bit of both.
“All right, I will see you both later. I still have so much to tell you.” -she said this to Draco, before following McGonagall out of the Great Hall.
Harry and Draco avoided each other for the rest of the week, until Saturday. The first Quidditch match of the season. They sat together at one of the teacher’s stand, two rows behind where Neville was sitting next to Hannah Abbott.
“It’s going great, each time I’m playing more, and they say I’ll be so much better when I’m older. Oliver Wood has come to most of my “important” games. He is really proud.- Said Ginny more relaxed now.
“Yes. She feels bad that I’m not with them. She wants to believe they are better people than what they deserve.”
Once Harry goes to Hogwarts, there isn’t much for Draco to do. Even though he loved spending time with Teddy and Andromeda and his friends, he was getting bored. He applied for a job at the ministry, and even though Hermione recommended him, he didn’t get the job. Hermione offered to talk with Shacklebolt, but Draco said it was not worth it. But he really wanted something to do.
“I was thinking about my parents being dead, and me being older than they were. As you know, my parents died the 31 of October. Yesterday, 24 years ago.”- said Harry.
“As of today, Draco is my boyfriend.” The way Harry said this reminded Hermione of an excited child being proud.
Back at Hogwarts Harry learned that one of his students broke his nose on a “muggle fight” but it was an easy fix. He didn't worry about that. A part of him was disappointed because there were no letters from Malfoy waiting for him. He’s gotten used to them. Harry couldn’t remember if he had ever written first to Malfoy. So, he wrote:
Harry was smiling. They continue to talk for most of the ride. Neville always brought up new topics and news because he wanted to distract Harry and he never mentioned Harry’s self-reclusion, which Harry truly appreciated.
The 30 of October was a Monday, and he went to the Burrow to celebrate Molly’s birthday. It was such a nice, warm party. A lot of food and a lot of laughing. Nothing like Narcissa’s birthday. He felt bad for her. George took Angelina Johnson to the party. Ron told him that it was the first time George was being serious with a girl, and that is was scary. George was being shy around her.
Harry answered all. He even tried to teach them some spells. Some questions took him by surprise, but he was honest. He had been avoiding thinking about the war, but it kept popping up in his head. After the war he couldn’t face the world, so he didn’t. At Hogwarts, the war hit him in the face. At Grimmauld place, it was mostly nightmares, here at Hogwarts, along with the nightmares, were the sudden memories of dead bodies when he walked through certain places of the castle. Where he talked for the first time with Cedric. Where he saw Fred’s body. All those places where students lay dying and he didn’t even know their names.
“I wanted a better, normal family. So, I went with Andromeda and Teddy. Potter just happened to be there, too.”- said Malfoy avoiding everyone’s eyes. - “I am sorry for what I did to both of you when we were at Hogwarts.”
send a letter? What would be so important to contact him? He hasn’t talked with the Dursleys since they went into hiding. He sat on his bed, took a deep breath and opened the letter.
“I had the chance to meet Remus when he was at Hogwarts, just for a couple times, when I went to check up on Sirius.”-said Andromeda to Draco. Harry already knew this. –“Neither of them allowed me to feel sorry for their situations, they made me laugh whenever they could. But by the time my daughter married him…well, he was a different man.”
After their study session, Draco realized it was the same exam Binns gave them on their first year. He kept all his exams and homework in his room at Malfoy Manor. he wrote to Andromeda for help. He didn’t tell her he wanted to help Teddy cheat. He told her there were some toys of his that he wanted to give to Teddy. She didn’t question why he hadn’t done it before or why wouldn’t he just buy him new toys. She thought he had sentimental reasons. So, she invited the Malfoys for tea at her house.
Astoria and Draco were together, far from their families. That was fine. Malfoy was making friends, he needs that.
“Yes, shut up… don’t question me. Shut up.” Said Hermione holding Viktor’s hand, between what seemed like contractions.
By the second week of February, Draco Malfoy was already settled at Grimmauld Place. Kreacher was thrilled. Draco didn’t like it at first, the style of the house reminded him of his own house. His father’s house. He also hated how Kreacher treated him, that is, like if he deserved to be praised just because he was a Malfoy.
Ron lived with both Harry and Draco for the first week of July and then he decided to move out. He made a tiny apartment in the back of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they had their stockroom. George wanted to charge him rent. He settled on “hiring” Ron to be a night-guard in exchange for rent. So the inventory was now officially Ron’s responsibility.
“We could have two, and that’s already a lot.”- said Hermione, not even looking up at Ron. - “Don’t try to confuse me, I know we had already talked about this.”
“I can’t believe you two are getting married. It’s all so real. So adult.”- said Harry, who was sitting on a couch next to Ron and Hermione.
“Mum told me to tell her if any adult asked me to keep secrets from her.” She said, trying to sound like an adult. Like her mother.
“I got Professor Snape and Slughorn’s leftovers. Some of this stuff is so old and strange I don’t even know what they’re for.” – Said Draco.
On August, George’s son was born in a muggle hospital. He named the baby Fred. He had dark skin and was quite small. Between George and Angelina’s family and friends there were about 20 people at the hospital. It was a small room but still everyone was there to see the baby. Percy was the one who cried the most, but only because George asked him to be the godfather.
“She is pregnant, I guess that is something muggles tend to do. But I think she actually likes him.”
Everyone obeyed but didn’t know why. Ron and Hermione went back to sit with him. Ron looked pale. Hermione was smiling.
June was over. Gryffindor won the Quidditch cup and Ravenclaw won the house cup. During the ride back to Kings Cross, more students than the year before came in to talk with Neville and Harry. Both professors didn’t’ get much time for themselves, but Neville did manage to talk about Hannah Abbott and how nice she was with him.
The next couple of days Harry felt guilty about giving Hyperion detention, but none of the kids cared. Hyperion told everyone he knew that professor Potter took two hours of his free time to teach him the spells he was having trouble with during class. After that, the few kids that were having trouble with DADA class came to Harry to see if he could give them personal lessons. He did. It was a group of about 11 kids, mostly from the seventh year. Hyperion was always there.
Draco went to the kitchen. They both knew he could’ve easily just use magic to bring him a glass of water. He needed a moment alone. Stupid green eyes. Stupid well-defined jaw. Stupid scar. He had to calm himself. He washed his face on the sink, then took that glass of water back to Harry.
Harry ended up helping Draco grade some essays. He was sitting on the desk, while Draco stayed in the chair. He wasn’t much help, since he had to ask about some ingredients, but it gave Draco the chance to talk about potions and he enjoyed knowing he was better at it than Harry. They talked about the students and their approach to homework. Draco felt he needed to assign it to reinforce the knowledge, while Harry only assigns it when the kids had trouble with a topic. Eventually, Harry sat in Draco’s bed again, still holding some papers.
By this point, Ron and Draco had lived together for longer than Draco and Harry did. Ron took Draco to buy Teddy a bed, because he was getting older for a crib. Harry almost cried when he saw it. Teddy
During the Ester holidays of the year 2000, Minerva McGonagall visited Harry. After some minutes, Kreacher let her in. She was surprised to find the house clean, unlike its owner. Harry had red eyes and dark bags under them. His hair and beard were long and a bit asymmetrical. He was wearing a robe, and she assumed finding it was the reason it took so long to let her in.
“Do you want to go to the science museum? They have all this interactive stuff for kids to play with.”- said Harry.
Astoria Greengrass wrote a letter to Draco to tell him about his father’s visit to her family. She had told her father they should report Malfoy’s intentions to the Ministry, but her father reassured her that Lucius was harmless. And that Lucius was his friend, although he didn’t sound convinced when he said that. Besides, she learned that none of the ex-death eaters wanted to betray Malfoy, even though they didn’t really like him. Astoria also congratulated Draco for his new relationship with Harry and Draco wrote back to thank her for everything. he would get worried, but between his classes, his friends and Harry, he had plenty of distractions.
“You are still too young. But that isn’t the issue. Even if you were a bad professor, the kids would learn something. And they would still love you.”
“She would not be completely free until he gets a wand of his own and now it’s easier for him to get one.”
“We should go to a muggle place where people won’t stare at the saviour. What do muggles do on a date?”
“Again, it’s both of you. I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s weirder than when we were at school. The way you two act around each other… it freaks me out.”
“Is everything fine with the Malfoys?”-said Harry, Andromeda didn’t answer, just looked at him. -“I’m sorry, how are you?”
“We’ll spend the Holidays together”- said Andromeda- “I’ll talk to the Weasleys about it. And, Harry dear…Teddy won’t forget you; he loves you.”
Harry didn’t really want to go, but he knew he had to get out more. He should talk to the professors; he should talk more with the students. He would have to talk about the war, eventually. Yes. He would talk to the kids first. It should be easier. Get it over with. While harry was thinking, an owl dropped a letter. Another one from Malfoy.
“Master Potter and his friends, how nice to have you all here. Is there anything you need?”- said Kreacher.
This relationship was the main topic of conversation for the first two weeks of the school year. The kids were hoping to catch their professors kissing, or something. Some drama. After the students saw that their professors kept interacting as usual, they lost interest.
By that time, Ron had asked Hermione to marry him, and she said yes. They celebrated their engagement in Ginny and Luna’s new home, near the River Exe.
Both of them woke up slowly. They were looking at each other without breaking their embrace. One looked scared, the other just confused. Neither knew how to react or what to say. Slowly, they took their arms from each other. They didn’t noticed McGonagall was there until she cleared her throat. “I want the two of you, professors, to follow me into my office. Now.” She walked away once she said this. Harry and Draco stood up and followed her, looking at the floor, avowing each other.
On the 15 of January, Harry gave Hyperion detention. It was Harry’s second to last class of Monday, so he spent most of his last class with the seventh years confused with himself. The classmates of Hyperion, both Slytherins and Gryffindors, were confused as well. It was the first time professor Potter gave detention to anyone.
During Ron’s birthday, Rose and Hugo stayed with their grandparents, the Grangers. It was a Sunday, so Harry was able to spend time alone with his best friend. “You know, Rose was a peaceful baby, but after Hugo’s birth she cries every night and so does him…how wrong would it be to give them a sleeping potion?” asked Ron.
Gryffindor won with 170 points. Hufflepuff only made 40 points. Gryffindor was at the head of the tournament. Draco couldn’t hide his annoyance at the overconfidence of all the Gryffindor kids.
“I won’t let that happen.” reassured Harry. “Don’t worry. Just think about how great the holidays are going to be with your parents knowing we are a couple.”
It was his mother’s birthday. He wanted to go for a drink with Hagrid and Neville, but he wanted to be alone more than he wanted to be drunk. He was angry at himself for being sad. he didn’t used to be like this. Maybe he hadn’t thought much about it when he was a student at Hogwarts. Now that he was officially an adult, he started to feel more like a child. Vulnerable. With more free time to think.
“My son, how nice to see you back from your job. Let’s go.” Lucius put his arm around his son and they began to walk away. They stop far enough for neither Harry nor Neville to hear them.
Juniper showed Harry and Teddy she could read. She was starting to read and she was excited, something that surprised Harry, since Dudley never showed much interest in reading.
Harry apparate in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. Kreacher and Draco were there, but only Kreacher noticed the arrival of Harry. Harry was sitting in his bed, just looking at the new décor, when he took a nap. He wasn’t exactly tired, but the new mattress was so comfortable he couldn’t help himself.
. Something like that. You get the meaning.”- said Harry, well aware of his constant use of expelliarmus
It was Hermione who suggested it after a brief research on the internet. She had noticed how Ron would look at them. How he would look at
“No.”- said Draco. So Harry kissed him again. After a few seconds, not enough seconds, Draco placed a hand on Harry’s face to stop the kiss, he stood up and when he reached the door he waited for Harry.
There was only one fight between two Gryffindor girls, other than that the students were went along with dueling themselves. It was a successful class.
“Keep playing but take care of her. You are older so you are responsible.”-said Viktor, in a deeper tone.
The parents of the brides were at another table with the rest of the Weasleys and Gabrielle. In the last table the Hogwarts’ professors were sitting with Hermione’s parents, and they were sitting next to Hagrid and Madame Maxime, which made Hermione laugh at how small her parents looked next to them.
“You have to stablish the terms of the duel beforehand. It has to be specified that there is not going to be any physical contact, just magic. If not, you can potentially kick them.”- said Harry.
They played two games in Teddy’s bedroom before he woke up. Malfoy won the first, but Harry won the second one once he understood Malfoy’s game. Malfoy liked gambits, not only in the openings. They took Teddy to open his presents. they left the third game unfinished, which was a relieve for both of them, since both of them were thinking they’d be the one that was going to lose.
“Fine. I hope one day we could have a relationship where I can tease you without you getting offended.” -Blaise said to Harry, giving him a handshake.
“Do you think my parents are still bad people?” If so, why would you help them during their trials?”-
Luna was wearing a dress with rainbows and with spangles, on her head she was wearing a tiara of unicorn horns. Ginny was wearing a sleeveless white dress. They both looked beautiful. The ceremony was short. When they kissed, Ginny’s team cheered the loudest, since most people were still confused, and her team just went with it.
Molly Weasley was a bit angry at both Harry and Draco for not telling her about their “secret” relationship, but everyone else in Harry’s life was fine with it. They just had to ignore all the questions people kept throwing at them.
“Your second name is Bilius?” -asked Draco. Teddy changed his hair to a ginger colour, and he kept looking at the fireworks section of the store.
Harry gave his classes as always. He didn’t give them homework that day, but he confiscated 8 copies of the Daily Prophet. Most of the students didn’t care, but he was too tired to ignore the whispers of the ones who did. He didn’t want to explain to them that his relationship with Malfoy existed
Draco Malfoy had been the Potions-Master at Hogwarts for two months, and honestly, he was just a little disappointed because his students weren’t afraid of him. There was already some gossip about him, and he did enjoy that. Older kids started a rumour that Draco had some sort of relationship with moaning Myrtle. Her crying was less intense since he came to Hogwarts and she came out of her bathroom more.
“No, no. I mean, I don’t know them. But I feel a bit responsible for them. I want to know if they are inf fact, getting better.” - Said Harry, worrying he might have offended him. - And I tried to help them because they would have left three kids alone if they went to Azkaban.”
During the summer holidays of 2009, Teddy received his letter to Hogwarts; Draco would always deny that he cried when it happened. Soon after, they went to Diagon Alley. Andromeda had to stop Harry from buying unnecessary things for Teddy, like a green pointed hat or a copper cauldron or a broom, which he was technically not allowed to own as a first year. Yet she bought him unnecessary books, so he could study more, under the argument that books are never unnecessary. “Have you been talking with Hermione?” asked Harry.
“if you want to bring something for her, it be better if it was something useful, food is always a good option. Im bringing her the ice-cream and the Cauldron Cake.
The second years were mad at the Ravenclaw boy, so he was teased for three days until Draco had classes with him again and he found out. During that particular class the students didn’t pay attention to their potions, since everyone was listening to Draco’s stories about when he used to taunt people. Mostly Harry. “So you taunted professor Potter because you were in love?” asked a Gryffindor girl who smiled while she looked at a boy who turned his face away to avoid her glance.
At some point in December, madame Maxime started living with Hagrid. So, both Harry and Neville spent less at Hagrid’s home. The 22 of December was the last day of school before Christmas’s break. Harry wanted to stay at Hogwarts and only go to the Burrow during Christmas and new year’s, but it was the only time Hermione had free time, so he basically went to the Weasley’s as soon as he finished his classes. When he arrived, he was hugged by Molly and by Hermione, who was also going to stay there. The male Weasleys just shook his hand and kind of patted him on the back, being unnecessarily awkward.
“We need to stablish some rules.” Said Draco, sitting next to Harry. “I don’t want people to know about us.”
Harry spent his birthday inside his room. He was now 22 years old. When Draco first tried to talk with him, it was already noon and Harry was laying on his bed. Harry only said that he was now older than his parents were when they died.
“Im sorry. I thought your father could be better, like your mother.” -Said Harry avoiding Malfoy’s looks.
It was a photo of Teddy, flying about fifty centimetres off the ground on a toy broomstick. It came with a note that said:
Almost ten years ago, Harry refused to shake his hand. That scrawny kid, turned into a man, now felt comfortable enough to sleep next to him. He felt bad for staring at Harry. But looking at your friends is totally fine, Draco thought. He was also thinking about the beard stubble on Harry’s face. Why didn’t he shave? Why does he look somehow better like that? Draco came closer to Harry’s face, just to have a better angle to look at.
“This doesn’t have to change anything between us. Don’t get me wrong, it will be awkward for a few days, but we’ll get over it…I should go. Tell Teddy I had to go see my parents or something.”- so then he left.
Slughorn, still the potions master, offered himself to show Harry his new room. He wanted to talk to harry about his self-imposed confinement, but he wasn’t brave enough to do it. They arrive at the professors’ common room which appeared to be a combination of all the houses common rooms, but with neutral colors and more desks. There were 20 doors on the walls, most of them had a little plaque with a Hogwarts subject and the name of the professor below it.
At Grimmauld Place the four of them had some tea with biscuits, provided by Kreacher. Teddy was already sleeping in a cradle that was in the room Draco took for himself. Harry asked Kreacher to watch Teddy. Even Ron told him it wasn’t necessary, but Kreacher still went.
“What? Your parents are heroes and they love you. You should have scared them even more! …why would they even made fun of Draco? - asked Harry. – “Was it about his hair? I know it’s kind of ridiculous, but it’s not that bad.”
Since Hermione was always working, it didn’t make sense to her to throw a party for her daughter who was only 3 years old. “They understand what a party is at that age.” Said Ron. “Yes, but she won’t even remember it.” Answered Hermione and that was it. It was fine. Rose spent the day with her four grandparents. By the end of the day, Hermione got her a cake and some presents, but no party. So Ron was very confused when Viktor Krum arrived at his house to celebrate Rose’s birthday. “She is my goddaughter after all.” Said Viktor.
“It looks nice. Maybe I will put on some paintings or something on the walls. Also, thank you for taking care of the heads on the wall. Some days I forgot they were there, and when I saw them, they freaked me out.”
” with Harry, so they were a little sad. Others repeated mean comments made by their parents. They were ignored. Professor Trelawney kept saying that she knew it all along. It was all on Draco’s Venus mount.
“I have a couple of ideas, but I guess we have to talk to Hermione about your father. Try to figure out what’s going on with the Ministry.”
“Not really. He can only say a few words, which is normal for a kid his age. I’ve asked”- said Malfoy.
Harry started having nightmares again during the whole Christmas’s break. They never were gone completely, but they were tolerable and less frequent. He was at home in his bed next to Draco, who thankfully was still asleep.
“Well, a muggle should be able to make a potion given the right ingredients, but they can’t.” said Teddy, frowning. “Why would genetics affect how someone put ingredients on a pot.”
Harry still liked Ginny. Maybe not in that way anymore. He will always care about her, though. She understood his need to be alone. Him leaving her was the best for both of them, and she learned to appreciate that.
At the burrow, Hermione was already there, and she was playing chess with Ron. Ron was winning. Soon after Harry arrived, so did Bill with Fleur, their daughter and Gabrielle. George gave Victoire a doll and Molly asked him if it was
He sent it before he got time to process what he wrote. He knew Malfoy wasn’t teaching him anything wrong, Andromeda wouldn’t allow it. Maybe he just wanted to see Malfoy again. Were they actually friends now? Not yet. Not really.
“What…I, you…” Draco was flustered. Things were happening too fast for Draco. Just a simple question from Harry made him forget everything they both said before. All his thoughts about their relationship failing were gone…
“Yeah, they are great together, such great friends.” He was now pacing the room with his hands covering his face. He then explained to Harry the fight they had.
Harry went to say goodbye to Teddy, he was still sleeping. He kissed him goodbye and his hair turned pink. He went back to Malfoy, who was still in the livign room, so that he could see.
“It is already so difficult to lecture a professor, I don’t know what to do with you.” McGonagall took a deep breath, she looked at the portrait of Dumbledore at her right, and he winked at her. “Fine, this is what I will do. Ten points will be taken both from Slytherin and from Gryffindor.”
They ended up getting a teddy bear from a muggle store. The baby was less than a week old, and his mother Mary Dursley looked completely fine. She was the one who opened the door for Harry and Draco and the two men were confused. They expected her to still be in recovery. Or something like that.
Vernon and Petunia were talking with another couple when they noticed that the boy talking with her granddaughter might have changed his hair colour. Then they noticed that Draco was looking at them from a corner. It was hard for them to pretend to be fine.
During the Trials, Harry remembers Lucius Malfoy looking defiant, Narcissa just looked tired, but Draco looked ghost-like. Harry felt sorry for him.
“He was brave, though. He tried to hide it and look strong. Mostly for me.”- said Harry, looking at Draco and then at Teddy.
“Are you having contractions?” asked Fleur, getting a short scream from Hermione as an answer. “We need to time them.”
“Your mother has only talk about how miserable she is, doing anything Lucius demands of her. I’m glad your father is free, it means your mother is free.”
“Lucius, you are not welcome in this house, please leave.” Said Andromeda, quietly so the others wouldn’t hear. “We won’t leave.” He answered.
Ron and Hermione got married in mid-June. Before the ceremony, which was at the Burrow, Ron was getting nervous. He was walking form one corner to the other in his old room. His four brothers, Neville, Harry and Draco were trying to calm him down.
“Then why would you even tell us about this?” asked Blaise. “I tell you why: you want us to help you fix this, it’s easy. Just. Talk. With. Potter”
Next day was a Saturday so they ended up talking about their families. About Teddy. About how Draco didn’t want to have kids to stop his bloodline. About how Harry did wanted kids. There was an issue there, but they decided to ignore it. Instead, they talked about Draco’s Dark Mark. It was still there, which was the problem. Harry kissed it for a while, then he kissed his way up to his neck, to his lips, and Saturday went away.
First, they went for a coffee and let Teddy hang around at the playground. Once he took his cap off to show his hair to some kids he was playing with, a middle-aged woman approached the four of them and started scolding Hermione. Only Hermione.
Draco’s first week went on quite normally. On Saturday, Andromeda leaved Teddy at Hogsmeade so he could spend time with Harry and Draco. The plan was for them to eat something first, buy stuff form Honeydukes, and then go to Diagon Alley to Weasley & Weasley to see Ron. But something else caught Teddy’s eye.
“Draco, if you are doing this because you don’t want to get married to the Greengrass girl, then you win. Find someone else, at your own time. But please don’t bring any more shame into this family.” Said Narcissa. Both young men were not expecting that from her.
“You are a good kid.”- Harry went to his room with the idea of crying himself to sleep, but he fell asleep right away.
“You have strong legs. It’s not nice waking up in the middle of the night thinking someone is trying to kill me.”
Viktor spent the party playing with Rose. When Ron joined them, the rest of the Weasleys were confused at how comfortable he was with Viktor. Harry would smile at their confusion and Draco looked at him with suspicion.
“As you may know, the point of a wizard’s duel is to disarm, stunt, injure or kill the other wizard. For obvious reasons, this demonstration will deal first with disarming charms.” -said Harry to his students.
Both Harry and Dudley looked at each other, Harry trying to ask what he should say and Dudley not knowing what to invent.
“I live here now; it’s been about 5 months.” -Said Malfoy, enjoying the exasperation in Harry’s voice.
The day before the Quidditch match was Sirius’ birthday. He was trying not to think about him during his classes, but it was no use, he couldn’t concentrate on his students. Since it was a Friday and he had a free hour before lunch, he decided to stay in his office grading some of the theoretical practice tests he had to give the students. But he couldn’t concentrate on that, either. He started feeling that he should have done something to celebrate Sirius birthday, maybe a prank of some sort. But he couldn’t manage that anymore. The best he could hope for was a drink of firewhiskey with Hagrid and Neville at the end of the school day in honour of Sirius.
“So, I should be thankful then?”- Asked Malfoy, sounding spiteful – “Do you think you made me a favour?”
Next Saturday Harry meet up with Ron and Hermione at the three broomsticks. When he arrived only Ron was there with two butterbeers on the table.
“It’s called a manor, and yes, it is.” - Malfoy looked at Harry as he leans against the doorpost.- “Not that is any of your business, but since you care so much about my life, I’ll tell you. I had a fight with my father, so I left. My aunt Andromeda was kind enough to take me in.”
“With the new reforms and the chaos they still have in the Ministry, I found a loophole. Anyway, the muggles wouldn’t found out it is magic, Mr. Keddle found an explanation involving muggle technology. I didn’t’ understand him but it sounded smart.”
“We are the only ones here. As far as I know, the other professors are already at Hogwarts. We are both new professors, so I guess that’s why.”
Maybe if he hadn’t come to Hogwarts, he would have been drunk by now. He did that when he was living alone. There were about seven days per year when he drank more than what was necessary. Kreacher called him an alcoholic. He wouldn’t do that now. He didn’t like doing it before, he hated how he felt, he hated thinking he would be a disappointment for them. Harry knew it was wrong and it tasted awful, but he didn’t know what else to do, back then.
They went to Draco’s office and didn’t talk in their way there. Draco mixed some herbs and a funny looking green goo and gave some to Harry for him to drink.
At some point in July, George and Angelina got married. Draco wasn’t technically invited. That got Harry a bit mad. He insisted to Draco that he should go as his plus one. Draco refused. It wasn’t really about Draco. He didn’t get invited because the wedding wasn’t formal. There were never invitations, per se. Everything from the planning to the clothes was intentionally casual. There were only two persons wearing “formal” clothes for the wedding, that was Molly and Angelina. But Molly changed back to her normal clothes because George said it would made Angelina feel less special. That was a lie.
“Okay. Luna told Ginny about your cousin’s wedding. Dad invited her over to talk about all the muggle traditions that she saw. That was fun” -Said Ron.
“Then be more careful next time. You are a professor. you can’t let a student outsmart you like that.”- said Slughorn, scolding him. - “you two kids should go with Hagrid. He was sad about his lady friend. Or should I said his
“Thanks for letting me know, man, but you are three days late. Here you go.”- said Harry giving Ron three boxes of chocolate. – “These don’t have any potions, one is for you, one for your parents, and one for your brothers.”
“Potter, today is my mother’s birthday”- he said once they finish paying. - “She wanted to invite you; she says she never got the chance to thank you properly. We are having dinner at 6pm, if you could come, my mother would be grateful. Andromeda is also coming, and Teddy. If that’s okay with you”- Said Malfoy.
“Because now it needs to stay like this for 30 minutes, then I take it out of the heat and wait until it’s cold.”- said the kid. - “So there’s no reason for me to wait here.”
They talk for a while. Eventually the place started to get crowded and most people kept looking at them. It was fine with them until they began to listen to their names in whispers and disdain when the people talked about Malfoy.
“Look at him, he will be a great quidditch player.”- Said Oliver Wood, who had come along with Percy.
“Stay here for the weekend and we will talk about this.”  Said Ron. Hermione was looking at him, unable to think.
“Yes, I am very careless. Clearly, he isn’t alone, he’s with Kreacher…Ronald, talk with your wife. If your mother sees the both of you having trouble she will pry, and it will be worse for you.”
Harry finished his breakfast and went right away to his office. He decided he should write back. He put paper on his desk and started pacing around. He wanted to ask him why he sent it, he wanted it to be simple.
Both Harry and Malfoy each took a wicker shopping basket. Malfoy took some chocolate skeletons and chocolate frogs, he showed them to teddy and asked him if he like them. He seemed to prefer the chocolate skeleton. Malfoy also took a chocolate wand and show it to him.
“Well, I am taken, and Charlie is never going to marry, so I guess the only option is for Harry to marry Percy.” -Said George. – “I’m sorry mate,” -he said, looking at Harry.
“No. With this particular potion, the worst result would be organ damage, but I had an antidote.” Said Draco, already trying to leave the bed, just to be stopped by Harry. “I’m fine. You don’t have to worry.”
“Well then, the other option is that Ron marries Harry. That way they can be related.”-said Neville. At this Draco had to contain a laugh.”
Harry was still wearing his glasses, they were up on his forehead, moving his hair enough to show his scar and other red marks that the glasses had left. Draco, carefully as not to wake him, took them off and left them on the bed near Harry’s face. Draco saw that it was only 7:16 am, so he had time to watch Harry, just for a little while. He kept looking at that lighting scar. What that scar had meant for himself and for his family still bemused him.
“Our feelings are not important right now. Teddy is. What if we tried something and it ends up badly?”- Draco had given much thought about this. This was excuse he had given himself over the last four years.
“Oh, yes. It makes sense…Mr. David was talking about how some software engineers and programmers…that is the people who make computers work” – he clarified after seeing Arthur’s confused expression. - “They would explain their work to a rubber duck to catch any mistakes they have made.”
“No, I wasn’t. Don’t worry.”-Said Harry, after looking at Draco. He was wearing a green button up shirt, making him stand out in a crowd of red and gold. Teddy was wearing red. He was also wearing earmuffs. Malfoy gave Teddy to Harry.
“Come on, don’t intimidate the kids.” – said Harry. – “You don’t have to be scary to be strict. Do you even like teaching? You haven’t told me why you are working here”
“Some of them are already 18 years old. Plus, I think it is normal for student to fancy some of their professors, especially if they are the saviour of the wizarding world. As long as the professors keep it professional.”-Said Malfoy, looking at Harry. - “Do you fancy any of your older students?”
“Teddy we both love you and whatever happens between Harry and me won’t change that.” Said Draco, firmly.
for him. Malfoy took him to the dinning room. It had a long table, for about 20 people. Lucius Malfoy was at the head of the table. To his right was Narcissa and Draco sat to his left. Next to Narcissa was Andromeda and next to her was Teddy, on a feeding chair. Harry was about to sit next to Teddy, when Narcissa spoke.
“Let’s not make a scene out of this, all right?” asked Draco, his face fully red. “We still have to deal with the kids.”
“Technically I wouldn’t be working. Evan Keddle, a squib friend of Andromeda and Ed, came to visit Andromeda. He suggested a business idea aimed at muggles. I would do the magic, and he would the rest. Not really hard work.”-
“I know you are a teacher, but you can’t be a good one if you can’t even teach this boy to be respectful. But what could I expect from you?” continued Vernon, ignoring Teddy.
“But If anything happens, we won’t leave you alone, we will come and help you, right Ron?” -Said Hermione
They all told Draco how their families were either impress or disappointed of him for his relationship with Harry. “My mother wanted me to let you know that she is impressed by your new strategy. I guess most of our families don’t really believe you
“And do you think they would have wanted you to feel bad, or to enjoy the life they gave you?”-asked Draco.
“What are you saying? He probably had that little speech prepared. How can you both believe him so easily.”- said Ron, walking around the room. - “He probably already bought some ancient, expensive book for Hermione to win her over.”
“Look Harry, this is your door, it takes you to your office. There you’ll find doors leading you to your classroom and to your chamber. If you ever need me, im only two doors away from you” -Said Slughorn, pointing at his own door. -“Good night, my boy.”
Both Harry and Neville could see that in their students. Half of them were determined in what they wanted to do. They wanted to be part of the change that was happening to prevent a war like that ever to happen again. But the other half was indifferent. They enjoyed their classes, but they didn’t see the point behind it.
“Talking about elves, I can’t believe that you of all people would let Kreacher sleep in what’s basically a cupboard.” -said Draco.
But the Weasley family kept increasing. After Molly’s birthday, Percy told his family he got married. With Oliver Wood. They were all happy but confused. Then mad for not being invited to the weeding.
“Teddy was there. And I slept on the couch. I rather not talk about Malfoy, if that’s fine with you.”
Draco leaved the room and Harry fell asleep after a few minutes. Harry’s friends started showing up, but Kreacher didn’t let them in and Draco had to apologize from behind him. Harry even refused to see Teddy. Teddy was already 4 years old, and he began to cry when he couldn’t give Harry his present himself.
Teddy's first class the next Monday was potions; he only has three classes on Monday, Potions, Transfiguration and DADA. And Harry wasn't jealous for not having Teddy’s first class, no matter what Draco says.
“No. That’s part of what McGonagall was telling me about. I don’t have any free time between classes like the other professors.”
“Then you have to start somewhere. I think you should also apologize Katie Bell. Who else? Luna… Maybe even to Buckbeak. People are not just good or bad, you know? You decide your actions.- Harry said, remembering Sirius.
“Where did you get the idea of coming to see a musical? It doesn’t seem like something you would like.”- asked Harry.
“I say we go to Primrose Hill, stay there and see the sunset. I guess it’s in about an hour.” – Said Draco.
“What’s happening?”- asked Harry, concerned about the way his two friends were looking at each other.
“…Oh. Of course. I…understand. I understand. Well, I guess there’s no point in reducing your salary…”- She sighed. - “Go get ready for both your classes. If any of the students realizes that you are
Valentine’s Day went on as usual. Many students gave Harry, Draco and Neville chocolate and cards and general longing looks. One student gave a
Next day was a Saturday, so he tried to decorate his room and his office. He put muggle photos of his friends on his room. The stillness of them had a calming effect that he learned to appreciate from Mr. Weasley. The moving photos of his parents he had them on a drawer, only to be looked at on special occasions. In his office he only put the books that Hermione recommended and a portrait of Dumbledore that McGonagall gave him.
Hyperion Greengrass was a scrawny kid, lanky and quiet. He didn’t seem to have any muggle born friends, but at least he wasn’t a bully. Harry wanted to find something wrong with that kid so he could tell Malfoy to not even consider getting married into that family, but he seemed like a good kid.
Harry sat in the chair in front her desk. He tried not to smile at the memories of him and his friends being in a similar position, being scolded by McGonagall.
Hermione did visit Ron more often, but it was mostly because Shacklebolt forced her to use her vacations days. She looked disapprovingly at some of the new inventions on the store. Still, she laughed at them, thinking about her own time at Hogwarts.
Draco could clearly tell that Harry was smiling while he spoke. Draco knew he was not able to pretend to be mad or annoyed. He knew he could be silly around Harry.
When Harry returned to Hogwarts, the students weren’t as worried about the exams as they were when the holidays started. They only cared about Saturday’s game, Gryffindor vs. Ravenclaw. The seekers of both teams went to Harry to ask for advice. Gryffindor won with an advantage of 130 points. Neville and Hagrid spent the rest of that Saturday at Gryffindor’s common room celebrating with the students.
Draco was upset because he knew that in another time, he would have thought the same. Using Harry as a mean to improve his image. His family image. Even using Teddy might have been a good plan. He was ashamed that he only wanted a new family.
“Seriously, though, what are you doing here? Couldn’t resist being away from me?” -Said Harry, regretting it when he saw Malfoy doubt before answering.
Malfoy was the next to leave, he took Teddy so that Andromeda could have fun. She then left soon after to spend more time with Narcissa. Before leaving, Malfoy gave Harry an orange wrapped box and told him to give it to Ron on Christmas.
“If someone is being mean to you it does not mean they like you. Try to talk things through. If they keep annoying you, come talk to me.” Said Draco, worrying he was giving the wrong impression to the kids. “In my case I was mean to Ha…professor Potter because I was a mean person.”
“Nothing, nothing. Never mind me.” -said Hermione looking away. – “Oh look, they are here. I’ll go get Shacklebolt.” -She said as he went away.
Hagrid was invited to the Weasley’s Christmas party but Olympe was staying with him, and he wanted to be alone with her. He did send some homemade baked pastries.
don’t care about what you do or with whom you do it. Next time just think about the image you are showing to your students.” -She interrupted. – “You can go now Potter, enjoy your weekend.”
He thought. His cousin Dudley, Ginny, even George was talking about asking Angelina to marry him, and now Malfoy. They are all so young.
Hermione Granger is defined as a workaholic, mostly by her own parents, but also by the Weasleys, once they learned the meaning of the word. She feels bad during her usually forced vacations. Whenever Ron shows concern, he is dismissed by Hermione, her job was important, and she had to change the wizarding world. That mentally caused their first “
“It’s not like I have never been in London before. Plus, I do have a lot of free time. I like to wander around.” -Said Draco. –“Though not lately, of course. You can’t see much of London as a ferret.”
On the 28 of July Harry sent a letter to McGonagall accepting the job; the next day he received a welcome letter along with the syllabus for each year, which Harry assumed was more of a recommendation than a guide to follow. That same day Harry went to say goodbye to Andromeda and to Teddy. He knocked on their door, and it was Draco Malfoy who opened it.
They end up spending two hours practicing the hex-deflection spells Hyperion could not do during class. Eventually he managed to do them, it was not perfect, but he made it.
“You know, technically, Lupin was part of my family. I’m glad I can claim more decent people as my family.”- said Draco.
He was right. Some days, for no particular reason, Harry just feels tired. That Thursday he was tiered, his classes were normal, he had a good night sleep and even a short nap. But still he was tired. Not so much as other days. He did feel better once he played with Teddy, but he was making an effort. Then, looking at Malfoy took away some of his energy as well. At least that’s what he thought. and that’s why he eventually gave up and fall asleep.
Harry played a little bit with Teddy. Draco watched them pretending not to care how natural and cute they looked together. The three of them were unaware of the curious looks they got from the people that walked by them. They said good-bye to each other, Teddy was upset at letting Harry go. Draco was too.
“You see what overworking did to Ron and Hermione.” Said Harry, going to his desk. Their desks were facing each other, so they just sat there looking at each other.
He was expecting some of the other students to defend Hyperion and told him off, that he was being unfair. No one stood up for him. Harry assumed that meant that he wasn’t a particular nice kid.
“Are you not happy to see me, Ronald?”- asked Viktor. - “I am also here for your wedding. Congratulations, you are both very lucky.”
“Something muggles invented, it has to do with biology and why we are how we are. My mum is a muggle doctor, she sometimes mentions it, genes and what not.” Answered a Ravenclaw girl sitting next to Teddy.
During lunch, Draco wasn’t there. Harry went to Draco’s office, but he wasn’t there either. So, Harry went to his own room and opened a drawer and took out the marauder’s map. It had been a while since he had to use it. Draco was in the potion’s classroom. He certainly didn’t’ need the map to figure that out, he thought. When Harry arrived there, he found Draco next to a Gryffindor boy who was adding some drops in a cauldron. Harry relaxed.
“I know, but in my opinion, it seems like both of you are raising Draco. He has learned a lot from you three…How’s he doing at Hogwarts, by the way?”
“I don’t know, but it’s fine now.” Said Harry. “Let’s go home where we can talk.” And the three professor apparated at Grimmauld Place.
The Weasleys throwed a party for Harry’s birthday. In the afternoon he arrived at the burrow with Draco. It was a nice party, but Harry had to answer many questions about his new job and Draco was still awkward around Harry’s friends. The Weasleys were clearly more accepting of Draco, they trust him in general, but he isn’t exactly a friend of the family yet. They were all trying to give him a chance. Apparently, being a ferret wasn’t enough. It needed more time and Draco was fine with that.
“I’ll take care of it.” -Harry put on his glasses and then reached into his pants to take out his wand, he pointed it at Draco’s face. – “
“It would be nice to spend more time together. What do you think?” asked Neville to Harry and Draco.
The two friends looked at each other, both speechless. Ron was blushing. They weren’t exactly thinking anymore. Harry wanted to make fun of him, but he couldn’t figure out how. Ron was a little surprised about his thoughts towards Viktor. Viktor was attractive and a good player, this wasn’t new to him.
“If I get to keep this job for more years, I don’t see myself getting to Hogwarts by any other way than by train.” -Said Harry.
“Of course you are not, my dear.” Said Andromeda, who approached to hug him, then she looked at the professors. “And if you both had actually care to talk with him or with me about more than silly aspects of his life, you might now how smart he is.”
“I know we should have talk about this before, but I want at least seven kids, like my parents.”- said Ron to Hermione, probably joking.
“No. One day before Hallowe’en she just told me she was ready. And asked if I could help. Blaise knew that Unspeakable from the Ministry, I think his name is Maxwell. He arranged it. Apparently, going in there is difficult even for a ghost.”
Harry watched as Neville and Hagrid approached him. Hagrid was carrying a weird looking lumpy bag. He didn’t even bother to ask. They drank firewhiskey and talk about the students and how they were adapting to being teachers. Hagrid told them about the sense of fulfilment when a kid with pure talent or genuine interest learns something new.
“You scared me, Potter.” -Said Malfoy. Harry was also scared by his voice. He turned around and saw Malfoy putting away his wand.
“What? Not much, really. My uncles went once or twice, to see shows with friends. They never liked it”
“Thank you, master Potter. But I rather eat alone. I am going to leave soon to meet someone...”- said Kreacher, taking his plate and then he disappeared.
“Do you think it would be wise to have your girlfriend working at the same place as you?” asked Ron.
“So what? Are a couple now?” asked Draco, trying to hide his blushing face. He had been a fool for delaying what he had wanted since he was 11 years old, even if he didn’t know it back then.
Narcissa and Draco get off pretty easily. Victims of circumstances, or something. Lucius Malfoy was more complicated.
“I never thought today would end up like this.” -said Harry. – “I will miss her. I feel so bad for not treating her better. Did she tell you why she decided to…cross the Veil?”
. No longer with jealousy but something else. Like the smitten teenager he used to be on their fourth year at Hogwarts.
Harry didn’t remember what happened next. He just woke up the next day on his bed, he was wearing his pyjamas and his clothes were fold on a chair. It was Wednesday, the only day of the week he had classes at 8 am. He used magic to get himself dress, something he usually avoided. Then, still sleepy, he went to give his class. He was 12 minutes late and he put on the same clothes he wore yesterday, on Hallowe’en.
Next day he only had to teach four classes and he had a free period after lunch. During lunch he sat next to Neville.
“You have to keep up, Goyle.”- said Pansy. “Four months Draco. You had time to hang around Potter’s muggle cousin, but you didn’t have time for us. Nice friend you are.”
“What? – Ron asked, looking at Harry. – “Can you believe her? Even today she rather be with him. I’ll go with her.  -He said as he began following Hermione.
“I didn’t said love.” Teased Andromeda. Draco and Harry looked at her, then at each other and they smiled.
He was eating his English breakfast, which somehow made him feel he was eating something healthy, when an owl dropped him a letter.
Draco felt better in the morning. But he still looked sick during his classes and his students were worried.
Since Teddy insisted, they went outside. He was bored and he wanted to play with the peacocks. The maintenance of the entire manor was now Narcissa’s full responsibility, since she was the one with the wand. She had to feed the peacocks and tend to everything inside and out, and though it was an easy thing to with magic, she hated doing it. So she didn’t liked watching his son playing with Teddy and messing up the bushes she had already tended.
The class was for the second years Gryffindors and Ravenclaws. For the second years Slytherins and Hufflepuffs it was Professor Trelawney who agreed to demonstrate a duel. She was good at it and she only predicted one death, so it was a nice class.
For someone like Malfoy, his room was quite small. That’s what Harry thought. There was not much space to walk around. One double bed took most of the room. There was only one chest and a small desk with a chair in front of the only window.  On the desk there were papers and a framed moving photo of Teddy and Andromeda, both of them smiling and waving. Malfoy sat on the chair and Harry on the bed.
“Clearly.” Harry interrupted. Confused as to why using Teddy was ever an option. “I think we should give an interview for the Quibbler. Your father still reads it?”
“But you are still a professor, or would you prefer Headmistress? Hermione told me about your promotion at Hogwarts.” -As he said the name of his old school, he looked away.- “Congratulations, I guess.”
“Well, yes. But he is more on the slender side, you know? But I guess you could say he’s strong. He has good proportions.”-Said Harry, remembering the first time he saw him since the Death Eater’s trials. He was shocked to see him so
“Your room is over there, two doors away from mine. So, if you ever need me, I’ll be here. Or with Hagrid.”- said Harry. - “At what time does your first class starts on Monday? Mine starts at 9 am, so maybe we can talk a bit after breakfast.”
They had a one-week honeymoon in Australia. Ron was stung by a jellyfish and he swears a shark almost ate him on the beach. Hermione got sunburnt. Still, they both had a great time.
They didn’t talk much after that. After drinking their tea, Harry played for a while with Juniper. Luckily, Mary had to go and breast feed Adler, so there weren’t more opportunities for her to ask questions.
“Harry, I know you’re going to be great as a professor, and you should have fun, but remember it is a job, and you should also take it seriously.”- said Hermione.
“People call it a kiss. It is perfectly normal, if you ask me.”- said Harry, trying to smile. He failed because he was thinking about how their friendship was now ruined.
now. I guess that’s just the way you act. I’ll just keep talking with Hagrid until I get to see Ron again.”
birthday! Happy birthday by the way…what about your family?” asked Ron, since Hermione couldn’t find anything to say.
Harry didn’t notice how Teddy wasn’t crying anymore, nor the goodbyes form Hagrid and Neville. Harry just looked at Draco’s face, it was too close to him and he had to look up at him. At that moment he didn’t care Draco was taller than him
“She also told me to be sensitive with these people, because they are a special kind of muggles. I think they are funny.”
“Yes, but they were friends before, wouldn’t it be easier for them? Talking about that, where is Hermione?”
“He did it…” Draco muttered. “My father said he could convince the Ministry to revoke his home arrest.”
“Well, as a Potions Master my schedule is quite full, so we don’t see much of each other during the day” he looked at Harry, who was nodding along. “But the nights are fun.”
“You went home, Draco.” Said Lucius, startling Draco, who was focused on his mother. “Unfortunately, we weren’t there to see you. As I suppose you know, we were at Andromeda’s house. Even though I am sure it must have been a coincidence. A sad coincidence.”
Percy, Oliver, Dean and Seamus were dancing with some of the younger women in Ginny’s team. Ron and Hermione were dancing with each other, and Ron got a bit mad when Hermione had one dance with Shacklebolt. Neville and George were dancing around Ginny and Luna, although It was mostly them jumping. A lot of the songs were Christmas’s carols.
Harry had to force Neville into Slughorn’s office. Once he received the antidote his whole face turned red. Slughorn demanded to know which student gave him the love potion. He said that even though the use of love potions is against the rules, when students use them with each other, they could let it slip, but if it was used against a professor it deserved a punishment. Neville refused to tell him. Mostly out of shame, but he didn’t want to get her in trouble.
Draco took the paper from Harry and started reading. The information wasn’t wrong, but it was unnecessarily long and confusing. It was written by a Ravenclaw boy who had trouble organizing his thoughts.
“I thought you three were better now…you should try to talk to him. He is still your father.  And you know, he could be in Azkaban…”
“She understands all you’re going through. If you both still like each other that should not matter. And I think she’s a bit mad that you spend more time with Malfoy. She still doesn’t trust him. None of us do, really.”
What to do in this situation? Forced them? Lucius didn’t have a wand so it would be easy. What were the Malfoys planning? They don’t seem to care about Draco not being there. Harry was thinking about all that. Thankfully Andromeda knew what to do.
“It would make no sense! We date and then what? We break up and I mess up the only family I have that’s somehow healthy. I am afraid.”
“I’ll let you two alone. I’ll be waiting, Draco”- Said Blaise, leaving the table. He went upstairs, Harry assumed to a room.
birthday. Sadly for us, he gave me his resignation so he could retire. He is now living in Italy and is doing well.”
“I’m dating Harry now. I think that will distract me for a while.” Harry blushed at this, but he looked directly at Andromeda to see her reaction. She just smiled and nodded.
“It’ll be fine.”- said Harry. - “We can buy it, but you will only use it when we are around. We can use it tonight, if you want.”
“Well, I also have a rubber duck and I play with it when I take a bath. Sometimes I just watch it float…can I go back to play now?”
“it was quite obvious. I don’t know what to tell you.”-Said Luna. - “I liked the wedding. Even that muggle food that tasted funny.”
“Haven’t you realized it yet?. In that case, ignore what I said. Now explain what happened.”- So Harry explained.
The Quidditch season started again the first Saturday of March, Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff. Harry was already at the pitch with Hagrid. Neville couldn’t go because he was visiting his grandmother for the weekend. Hermione, Ron and Draco arrived together, just before the game started.
“McGonagall wanted to show me my schedule and talk about my responsibilities as the head of Slytherin.”- said Draco, calmly.
“I know. I have to make sure he is good for Teddy. Andromeda leaves them alone, you know? I think he is really becoming a better person. He covered me with a blanket.
Harry and Draco were sitting on the bed, Harry had his hand on his forehead, and Draco had his on his nose. They both felt pain, but they were more surprised than they were in pain. They were looking at each other.
Draco returned from his trip two weeks before the next school year. His trip to Italy inspired Neville, so he took Hannah to a romantic trip to Germany. When Harry asked what was so romantic about Germany Neville told him that the Bowtruckle is native to that country, like that was an obvious explanation. Harry didn’t ask anymore.
“Well, your friendship isn’t over, he clearly wants to keep being your friend. And he wasn’t angry, so I guess that's good.”- said Ron.
“No public displays of affection, specially at Hogwarts. If we get into a fight or whatever, we cannot use Teddy as leverage or anything like that.”
a doll, to which George only smiled at her. Percy was at the table, looking through some papers and occasionally he would go up to Hermione to ask her opinion. Arthur was playing with Harry’s present for him, an electric sharpener and a scientific calculator.
“It was nothing really. Happy birthday, by the way. Here”- he gave her a bottle of Firewhiskey with a red bow on the neck of the bottle. He also gave her a box wrapped in green paper with a silver bow. Lucius raised an eyebrow but said nothing.
“Yes. They love him. But they made him think he was better than everyone else. It’s not his fault he believed them. But he decided to change.” – he said, smiling.
He looked at his class schedule and he was going to give his first class on Monday to the Gryffindors and Slytherins first years, at 9 am. Then, at 10:30 am, he was going to give class to the sixth years from all the houses. That was a N.E.W.T level class. Harry realized that he wasn’t nervous.
By Sunday he decided he wasn’t going to fall back to his old habits of being a hermit. He went to eat breakfast at the Great Hall. He was going to sit at the Gryffindor table, but the kids just looked at him until he realized he had to sit at the professor table. He sat close to Gryffindor and he tried very hard not to look at the kids. He let them stare at him. On the other side of the table were just two other teachers, Bathshead Babbling and Septima Vector. He was mad at himself for not sitting next to them.
“That sound like good advice…I wish my students would ask me questions, instead they just stare at me.” -Said Harry.
“Where is him, anyway? He always receives me, and I wanted to see how he acts around you.”- asked Harry.
Andromeda did get to know some interesting men in America. Most of them wizards. Narcissa tried to hide her disapproval of the couple of Muggle men Andromeda made acquaintance with. When Narcissa returned to her home, she found Lucius reading the Quibbler. He hated it, but there isn’t much too do when one is locked in their houses, unable to use magic. So, he gave in.
After the game ended, they went to Andromeda’s house to see Teddy. They asked Hagrid if he wanted to go, but he had to go with Slughorn into the Forbidden Forest. The potions-master needed some “special ingredients” only found in there.
So Harry stayed with Andromeda and Teddy for a couple more hours, and Draco went back to Hogwarts alone, to a peaceful night without incidents.
“My mother appreciated the Firewhiskey, and so did I. But I most know, why did you give her a Muggle magic set for ages 8 and over?”
Draco spent the morning of his birthday with his family at Malfoy Manor. Andromeda and Teddy were there the entire time. At some point, the Greengrass family arrived. Lucius kept making subtle comments about Andromeda’s half-blood suitor. Narcissa took the positive side, at least he was a wizard.
“We didn’t talk much, but she was a good student. How is she doing? And your family, is everything fine with you?
They spent the first night and day of the new year together. Both Harry and Draco slept on the floor of Teddy bedroom. They could have easily cast a bed or at least some pillows, but neither did. It seemed like a good idea at the time. At least they woke up together, both on their sides facing each other.
Juniper Dursley’s birthday was on june, and she had asked for Uncle Harry to be at her birthday party. Dudley sent his cousin a letter to Hogwarts. Harry accepted on the condition that Draco and Teddy went with him. By that time, Harry already knew what the final exams for DADA would be like, but Draco was still thinking about his subject. So, bringing Draco with him would mean an excuse to leave earlier.
Once they arrived, they went to the Great Hall for the Start of Term banquet and the Sorting Ceremony for the first years. He was sitting at the High Table next to Neville and another woman he hasn’t meet, he could also see Hagrid smiling and waving at him. All the other professors and staff members were the same Harry had during his last year at school.
“I miss her. Maybe you should talk with her, ask her to move in here. At least I would get to see her before work.”
“I didn’t know you like chess.” - said Harry. - “You could’ve just asked him to play, he would’ve been so thrill to beat you.”
“I suppose you want me to say that I did it out of the goodness of my heart. Why else would you care? What’s done is done.
“You are not completely fine just yet, so stay in bed.” Said Madam Pomfrey as she approached him with more medicine. “This is to prevent any…intestinal problems. Don’t drink any more potions for a month, even if they are done properly.”
Harry let Myrtle talk all she wanted. She talked to him about her life and her last birthday. About how some kids were making fun of her, but the letters and sweets she got from her parents made her feel a little better. She told him about the first time she saw Hagrid. She thought he was so lucky that no other kid was brave enough to bully
“Ron, if you can’t trust your wife, your friend, then there is definitely something wrong in there.”
When Draco told Kreacher they were also going to redecorate his room, he wept with word of gratitude and mumbles of being unworthy. Draco just made the room bigger, got the boiler out, got him a decent elf-size bed and put in some furniture for Kreacher’s few possessions. Adding to Kreacher’s collection of stuff, Draco gave him the New Guidelines on House-elf Welfare, which were modified by Hermione, and order him to read them.
“Please don’t tell your mom. It’s a secret of mine…people can’t know about the school I teach.” Harry stutter, he was looking around to see if anyone in the party was close enough to listen. There were none.
Harry went with them. There were many kids, but they didn’t seem as excited as Harry’s classmates were. The kids were starting to get the idea of Harry as a teacher. He hasn't taken points away from any house, and he hasn’t given detention yet, much to the concern of other teachers. Apparently, all the kids still behaved better in Harry’s classes. Harry was responsible for the third years. They all wanted Harry to go with them to a certain store, they asked him what they should buy and what did he did at his first visit when he was a third year. He was honest. He spent time with his students, talking nonsense with them.
Draco is smart, really. He knows it’s not exactly healthy to worry about the end of the relationship when it just started. He is afraid of ruining his life. For better or for worse, his life now depended on the people around him. Was that healthy? He wasn’t sure.
“Do you know your sister and I were on the same year at Hogwarts?”- asked Harry when they were done.
“That’s what everyone thinks. That I will be good at it just because it’s me. And I’m sure that even if im the worst professor ever to step on Hogwarts, everyone is going to cut me some slack because I am Harry Potter.”
“I’m just curious. And I care about my students. If something bad is happening in your home, you can tell me, and I will help.”
All the games were to take place on a Sunday, so more people could be able to go. Even Hermione went. Baby Rose had noise cancelling headphones and an enchanted blanket to keep her warm. George wasn’t there since Angelina just had another baby, and she refused to let a new-born baby to a game in Russia. George was just a
“It’s all my fault, professor…headmistress… I was sad…I was drinking, and Professor Malfoy didn’t want to leave me alone, so I convinced him to drink with me. It’s my fault.”
By the end of May, the last game of the quidditch season was between Slytherin and Hufflepuff. Draco couldn’t be there because his parents had arranged another meeting with the Greengrass’ family. Hufflepuff won that game. Hufflepuff also won the inter-house quidditch cup. What annoyed harry wasn’t that Gryffindor didn’t win, but that it was tied with Slytherin, and they decided to share the second place. He wanted Gryffindor to win just so he could tease Draco.
“He’s still a paying customer.”- she said, surprised at Harry’s reaction. - “I am over it. I forgave him when he asked me, but
Malfoy did. He took the picture and gave it to Harry. It was practically a muggle photo, because Teddy was so still, just a tiny movement of the head could be seen. Before leaving, Harry got an idea.
For Draco and Harry, the arrangement that year was that Teddy would spend Christmas with Harry and the Weasleys and New years with the Malfoys. Harry was sitting next to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and he kept looking at Teddy who was playing with Victoire and with Fred. The kids were playing with a small dragon that Charlie had brought, and they were being “supervised” by Ginny and Luna.
The fifth birthday of Victoire Weasley was on a Monday. After Teddy completed all his homework, Draco and Harry took him to Shell Cottage to celebrate. Teddy was riding his bicycle, trying to play along with Victoire, who was riding a tricycle. They were playing too close to the edge of the cliff, according to Harry. Even Draco knew they were not.
“Harry! It’s me, Neville.” -He said, as he came into his office. - “Harry, I’m in trouble, I need your help. I don’t know what to do.” – he sat in the chair in front of his desk. He looked like a student in trouble.
Classes started again, and both Harry and Draco acted like nothing happen. Sometimes, when they would unintentionally touch, they would look away blushing. Other than that, they kept talking normally. They didn’t see each other much, anyway. By the time quidditch season started again in March, the whole school had realized that something was odd between the DADA and potions professors.
“I guess we really aren’t best mates, you can’t possible think I’m capable of doing that.”- Interrupted Malfoy.
a fundamental spell in his opinion. The students were delighted to have one of the men in charge of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes in their class, so they kept asking him questions about the shop. Eventually, Fred became part of the conversation. Ron almost cried.
“He won’t. Thank you.” Said Harry, who smiled after Draco made a disgusted face when he took the medicine.
The game was entertaining enough. What caught Hagrid’s attention was not the game, but that Malfoy cheered for Gryffindor and not one of the three friends said anything about it.
“That, well. The Wizengamot decided he wasn’t a threat, so they made another trial. At least he can’t use magic.”
“Weren’t you hiding at your home for like, two years? Did you ever made an effort to come to this house to see him?” -Said Draco. He didn’t intend for it to sound so unkind, but he couldn’t stop himself. -“I think I have spent more time with Teddy in five months than you in two years”
“Go then.”- the two men stood up, thank her and went to the door, before Harry could get out, she said: “I am truly sorry, Harry.”
It is true that lately they had avoided certain topics, but they only wanted to protect Teddy. He was just a boy. And they themselves were uncomfortable being serious around Teddy. Another topic they were going to avoid is what if they break up. Well, only Draco. He wanted to know for certain that Teddy was going to be fine.
now. Friends talk about girls and that kind of stuff. But Malfoy wasn’t staying with Andromeda, so he couldn’t go and talk to him. He wanted to see Malfoy and talk, not just to write him a letter.
“They just wanted to stop the massacre. The Slytherin team is really good. Better than the ones I played against.”
When they were done with tea, they went to Honeydukes where Harry bought too much chocolate for Teddy. Then they went to Diagon Alley. On their way, Harry couldn’t eat any of the stuff he bought for himself. When they went inside the Weasleys’ shop, Ron was arranging the products of the WonderWitch collection.
for the sake of Teddy. He threw away the papers. He got a glance at the picture, both of them standing in the garden, looking at each other and then looking away.
“…I know that young mothers these days are more liberal about how they raise their kids, but don’t you know how bad that is for your son’s health?”- asked the woman.
“I don’t want to…It was all my fault.” She now started to cry, but she controlled herself. “let’s eat something, then I will go back to the Ministry.”
“You can be honest, you are not going to marry her just to annoy your father”- said Harry, smiling at Draco.
“It is fair, for the kids.” -said Draco, showing Harry a paper with his schedule. - “A potions class needs more time, for brewing and what not. So, all my classes last two hours. In order for the kids to have free time after 7pm, my classes have to be one next to the other. All week. But I only have four classes on Friday, so I am done by five.”
His second class with the sixth years was weirder. The mother of one of the Slytherins of that class was a Death Eater. She had killed the brother of a Hufflepuff kid. Harry felt guilty about that. Was that also his fault? He knew that it wasn’t, but he felt like it was. The whole class was tense.
Malfoy and Kreacher were on the first floor, lying down near the fireplace, playing chess. Kreacher was the first to see them.
He went back to Hogwarts, into his office and he began to look for all the four ingredients of a forgetfulness potion. He wasn’t going to drink it, but he just wanted to feel like he was doing something. He put the ingredients back in their place and he sat on the chair of his desk.
“You love her?” asked Harry with a bigger smile, his question was answered by Neville hiding his face, which made Ron and Draco laugh out loud.
“Wonderful.”- said Mr. Weasley, smiling. - “I would have never thought of that. Please tell me more, but just let me write it down.”
Harry and Draco liked being roommates. They lived together for two months until Harry had to return to Hogwarts. Neville stayed with them for a week, because his grandmother had
“He is a Slytherin. He would do or say anything to get what he wants. And he wants to be accepted by the wizarding world. Why do you think he is working with a squib? No one would give him a job or buy anything from him.”- said Ron
That year Percy had stayed with Oliver and his family in Scotland. They both sent presents to the Weasleys and to Harry. Percy wrote a letter that said they both would be staying at the Burrow for new year. Luna’s father was trying to convince Charlie to get him some dragon’s tears, although he seemed reluctant to tell him why he needed them.
“Yeah, well, who cares about that. The important thing is…besides Hermione, who knew about Ginny and Luna? -asked Ron, getting negative head shakes from everyone, even from Malfoy - “I did not see that coming, I still thought my sister was in love with Harry. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for her.  But I thought that eventually I was going to be related to Harry.”
Harry, Draco and Neville had one last drink at Hagrid’s home after the Leaving Feast. Hagrid was proud to announce that not a single child was harmed during his classes. Harry said that it was great, the other two men just smiled awkwardly.
“You could go apologize to Hermione now, if she accepts, it would make things easier with the rest of my friends.”
“See there, that’s what I mean. He wouldn’t be such a good professor if he hadn’t been your friend.”
During the Sorting Ceremony, every house cheered for every kid. Minerva McGonagall introduced Harry and Neville as the new professors. The students started whispering about it, but soon enough they were back to taking and yelling among themselves. Harry could recognize some of the older kids. He couldn’t remember their names.
“No. My parents are busy today, Luna and Ginny offered to look after them today, remember?” answered Ron.
Not only Viktor had done it, but other friends of his, famous quidditch players announced the same. So the school received even more
Harry was once again at Kings Cross, ready to take the Hogwarts express. He said goodbye to his friends and found himself once again in the train with Neville. This time, Harry was looking at Draco through the window. Once the train started moving and he couldn’t see the station anymore, he wondered why he only look at Draco and didn’t look at Teddy. Or at anyone else.
At the end of march, during James Potter’s birthday, Harry had a nice dream. Not even a little weird, just nice. All his family together and happy. Remus and Tonks playing with Teddy. Draco talking with Harry’s parents. When Harry woke up, he cried. He had to fight the instinct to hide from Draco. Draco hold him for the rest of the night, luckily neither move in their sleep, so they were able to wake in each other’s arms. Something rare considering Draco moves a lot in his sleep, according to Harry.
That gave Draco enough time to get all his assignments from Hogwarts. His room was exactly the same as the last time he’d seen it. Well, it was now covered with dust. He wanted to clean it, the muggle way, but then his parents would know he had been there. That is if they ever went into his room. Clearly no one had entered since he left. But he was afraid of the possibility of being caught. So he left with his papers.
Draco’s birthday was on a Wednesday. Harry already had made his exams, and he had already given his older students a guide for what the Ministry always look for, according to Hermione. He was prepared. So, by 6 o’clock he left Hogwarts and went to Grimmauld Place.
By the time Teddy woke up, Harry had already make breakfast for him. Harry only drank coffee. When Teddy asked about Draco, Harry told him he went to his parents, and that he didn’t wanted to wake him up.
Bill and Fleur now had another daughter, one-year old Dominique. Unlike her sister, Dominique has ginger hair. Ron and Hermione were looking after the two Weasley babies, who were both now asleep on their arms.
“Neville, I’m afraid some of the kids might not like having a former death eater as a teacher. Should I have told Draco about it? I feel so bad, maybe I can still warn him.”- said Harry, walking around Neville’s office.
By the time they finally arrived at the hospital, most Weasleys were already there. A nurse was pushing Hermione in a wheelchair. Viktor was next to them carrying a still unconscious Ron in what could be describe as a princess carry. Mrs. Weasley looked around and since no one was watching she took out her wand and made Ron woke up. He said thanks to his mom and then he followed the nurse and his wife. Hermione’s parents arrived just a little after.
The headmaster of Durmstrang was a man named Haldor Rolvsson. Harry didn’t like him. The day he arrived, Draco mentioned he was attractive. Neville teased Harry and Draco, and the three young professors joked about it, but it made Harry jealous.
Harry was driving and Draco was next to him, on the back seats was Ron, still unconscious, Viktor and Hermione. Hermione was telling Harry the directions to the hospital. “Call my parents.” She said as she gave a Motorola flip phone to Draco.
, could do better. But he was happy for Harry. Now that Longbottom was gone, he thought it would be best to stop listening to the conversation. But he kept listening.
Harry stayed on the sofa and his tears finally were able to come out. He wanted to break something. Perhaps himself. He took a chance and he missed. It happens. Draco was right, it could take time, but it will go back to normal. It had to. If not, Hermione could help with an
“…Maybe not at first, but I think I would eventually feel so bad I would have to be honest.” He said, surprised by his own answer. “I think Hermione would do the same…I think Viktor would also tell you, eventually.”
The three of them arrived at Grimmauld Place and they started playing in Teddy’s room until he got tired and ready to sleep. Draco cleaned the messy room using his wand. Then he said he was going to work on the potion’s exam of the second years.
“Yes. Please. I’d like to keep seeing him.”-Said Harry. It was always good seeing Teddy. He reminds him of the good that’s left in the world, even after all the horrors of war.
“Besides, you can do whatever you want, even if it’s not your birthday. You are Harry Potter.”-Said Draco, making fun of him.
“I don’t want to keep Blaise waiting. -Malfoy paused for a moment, indecisive. – “About earlier. I never thanked you, for what you did for me and my mother.”
The first of April was George’s birthday. George proposed to Angelina on that day. She was mad at him, thinking it was an April’s Fool joke and she didn’t talk to him for the rest of the day. But then, on the second of April George asked again, and she said yes. Molly cried when she told Harry about it.
