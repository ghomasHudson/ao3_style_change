There was the frown. “Why?”
“Don’t mind if I do.”
“Get on with it, Potter,” he groaned. Harry smirked. Without a word, although so many came to mind, he sucked Draco down until his cock hit the back of his throat. “Oh fuck, yes,
“What happened to the Weasley girl?” Draco asked. Harry let out a long breath.
“Is there anything I can help with, Mrs. Weasley?” Draco asked. She waved him off.
“No, don’t be silly dear,” she replied. “No, I’m upset that you thought, all this time, that you couldn’t talk to us about….” Here she gestured vaguely between him and Harry. “Your father may not have understood it, but he still loved you. We both love you. And I’d hate to think that you would keep something so important to you from us because you were afraid we’d think differently.”
, my colleagues can chat up witnesses and sexually harass female members of staff – which let me tell you, I have half a mind to tell the
The months passed in a disoriented blur. The war was over, his father sent to Azkaban, and he was tried and acquitted, but not forgiven. So he shut himself away, let himself be forgotten.
“No, you don’t,” he said. “Not really.”
Harry laughed. They passed a moment in companionable silence, chopping and peeling.
“The, er, living room is just down the hall,” Draco said, letting go of Harry’s hand and gesturing towards the back of the house. “I’m going to put the kettle on, do you – do you want tea? Coffee?”
Then, Kellen suggested that they look at Malfoy’s memory of the event. Harry was reluctant at first, but he had to admit, it would help to see the attacker for themselves. They were able to secure a Pensieve without too much difficulty. The trouble was getting Malfoy to give them the memory.
“I don’t care if he got an Order of Merlin, that bloody fucking prick tormented us for six fucking years!”
Harry glanced at him. Draco had grown impossibly pale, as if he was turning into a ghost before Harry’s very eyes. Harry worried his lip and rubbed Draco’s hand with his thumb. Draco closed his eyes at the touch. His shoulders rose and fell as he took a deep breath. Harry wanted to tell him that it was going to be alright, but just as he opened his mouth to speak, Dumbledore turned back to them and returned to his chair behind his desk. If he noticed their joined hands, he didn’t say a word.
“I said I was bringing a guest,” Draco pointed out, blushing furiously. “We brought gifts,” he added, raising the presents like a peace offering out to his mother. Narcissa took the gifts suspiciously, but stepped aside to let them in. Draco’s shoulders slumped in relief, and he bounded inside, giving his mother a quick kiss on the cheek as he passed. Harry followed, hands in his pockets, and glanced nervously at Narcissa, who pursed her lips.
Ron hesitated. “Oh,” he said. He seemed to shrink back to a normal size, his bearded face switching from menacing to suspicious as he looked Draco over. “Right, then.” He stepped back and went back to his wife, who was struggling to get up from the couch with her pregnant belly. He lifted her up, and she braced herself against him, like a ship coming in to port. Ron wrapped his arm around her shoulders and she smiled up at her husband for a moment before turning to Draco with an only slightly murderous look. As she allowed herself to be guided away, she revealed Harry sitting on the far-end of the couch, his eyes glued to the beat-up pine coffee table in front of him.
“A necromancer,” Sirius had wondered aloud.
“Harry, you can’t go back there,” Draco said firmly. “That is literally child abuse. And neglect. And fuck knows how many other charges.”
“You’ve heard everything. You know. So just get down here. Fight me. Stop me. Whatever you’re here to do, just do it. Or I’ll Stun you and leave you here. Your choice.” Malfoy crossed his arms, tapping his foot as he waited. Harry bit his lip, then sighed.
“We all know Harry can hold a grudge, so the fact that you two have made amends-”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “You done?” he asked. Hermione considered it for a second, then nodded.
“So whoever is selling them the stuff must know who they are,” Draco finished, already reaching for his robes. “No time like the present. Let’s go.”
Harry blinked, forcing himself back to the present.
“And what did you think of Arnold’s counterargument? I found her points particularly fascinating – ”
He had kissed Draco Malfoy. He had spent the night with Draco Malfoy. And Draco Malfoy had wept in his arms because his father had just died. Harry combed his hands through his hair, trying to pull out the knots and tangles. Outside his window, the sun was beginning to rise into a blue sky with scattered clouds. The storm, it seemed, had finally passed. The kettle whistled and Harry pulled it off the stove in case the noise –
Of course, it could never be that simple.
Draco clutched at Harry, his arms wrapped around Harry’s waist as he wept into his chest, hands bunching the fabric of Harry’s shirt as he clung to him. Harry held him. He held him as the sun climbed higher into the sky, casting its light and its shadows onto their huddled forms. He held him as his sobs gradually softened and he grew quiet. He held him as his breaths evened out and his hands loosened their grip. They held each other in the soft silence that followed.
“He’s a pouf, Draco! Come on! Are you being dense on purpose?”
“That’s
“Scarhead.”
On his back, from the base of his neck down to the waistline of his pants, was a fork of lightning.
Harry clenched his jaw, waiting for the jibe, the sneer, the dirty joke. But it never came. Something flashed across Malfoy’s face, but Harry couldn’t decipher it in time.
“You’re you. You love the sound of your own voice.”
“But I still want you,” Draco whispered. Harry gasped. His eyes fell to Draco’s lips, a question. Draco gave him his answer.
Harry blinked. “Oh, you mean the one next to the bathroom? That’s Teddy’s room.”
Harry said nothing. He didn’t lower his hands, so he missed the thoughtful look Draco gave him. He did, however, feel the cushions shift and move, and felt cool hands tugging at his own.
It was a chaste kiss, but Harry wanted more. He tried to part Draco’s lips with his own, moving to angle his head to deepen the kiss, but Draco pulled away with a smirk. He settled back in his chair, taking a sip of his whiskey, revelling in the bewildered look on Harry’s face.
“God, you are gorgeous,” Harry murmured. Draco could no longer contain his beaming smile.
Only then did Harry realise he had closed his eyes. When he opened them, Draco was so close, he could feel his breath brush against his skin, see the pale glimmer of stubble, the gleam of a silver scar like a comma above his lip from some forgotten fight. And there was that little crease between his brows, the same one Harry had wanted to smooth away that first morning, the one that seemed permanently etched into his skin.
“So why aren’t you?” Draco demanded, doing his best to ignore the way his stomach twisted and flipped. Potter shrugged again, a mischievous quirk to his lips.
Draco blinked. Tears began to slip down his cheeks. He sniffled and tried to look away, but Harry held firm. Again, he found his gaze flickering between Draco’s eyes and his trembling lips, but this time, he let them linger there. He brushed the pad of his thumb against Draco’s lower lip. Draco inhaled sharply. Harry’s hand dropped away. He had misread the situation, forgotten who he was talking to. He made to step back, but before he could, Draco’s hands were in his hair and his lips were crashing into Harry’s in a clumsy kiss.
“I could have walked, you know,” Draco pointed out with a grin. Harry lowered him onto the bed and shrugged.
“Since when have you been into politics?” Harry teased. Ron’s blush turned the tips of his ears scarlet to match his hair. Harry laughed again.
Malfoy sat on the ground a few feet away from Harry. Trapped in an
“That you were attracted to me.”
“I trust your judgement, Headmistress. And I’ve heard he has…changed, a lot, since the War.”
Luna frowned. “So you’re not dating him?” she asked innocently. Harry let out a disbelieving laugh.
, Harry thought.
Harry’s expression softened. “Sir, that was over fifty years ago.”
Draco frowned. “Now? Like this?”
“Oh, Malfoy, were you the one coordinating this little coming out party? How thoughtful. The boys and I would love to join, if that’s alright with you.”
“We both do, sir,” he said. “That’s the point.”
Harry pulled back a centimetre in surprise. He frowned.
“Yay!”
“I broke you, didn’t I?” Draco asked, still out of breath. Harry laughed again and shook his head.
“What, because it’s two men having sex?” Draco shot back. Hermione blushed and flapped her hands at him.
“You don’t really believe him, though, do you, Potter?” Dawkins asked, his smile growing tight and forced. “Come now, Potter, he’s a Malfoy, he’ll say whatever he has to so he can slither his way out of trouble.”
Draco came just in time to hear Blaise swear and toss a velvet bag of coins at Pansy through the fireplace. She caught it with ease, grinning ear to ear. “Thanks, babe!” she purred.
“Vince. Focus. Are you two just dropping in or is there something you want?”
“Here, let me.” He waved his wand, vanishing the cat hair. “He’s an absolute menace, that cat.”
“I’m not crying, you’re crying,” Draco mumbled. He wiped the offending tears from his eyes with his palms, looked away with a ragged sigh.
He dressed, packed a bag with some snacks and a couple water bottles, and grabbed a piece of toast for his breakfast. He left a quick note on the old kitchen table –
“Time – Time moves differently for my people,” the king murmured. He continued to stare at the map in a daze. “So – so what you’re saying is – what has changed, then? I have had no reports except those from the towns and villages on this map, as far as – as far as I am aware.”
“Heathen.” But Harry smiled. He set out the sugar and sat back down. “By the way,” he said, not looking at Malfoy, “I’m queer too. Bisexual. Figured it out after Ginny and I split.”
“Please don’t go,” Harry whispered between desperate kisses, “please don’t leave me.”
Harry involuntarily flinched away, laughing, when Draco raised his wooden spoon at him threateningly. “Fine, fine,” he conceded, hands up in surrender. “He’s actually coming over next weekend, you can meet him then if you want.”
When Malfoy came into the kitchen that day and saw Harry and Kellen standing by the shallow silver bowl on the table, he immediately turned on his heel and walked right back out.
“What is this about, Potter?” Draco asked as he fixed his glare on a couple of third years in front of them who kept looking over their shoulders at the pair. The third years blushed and hurried off, leaving Harry and Draco far out of earshot of the group. Harry chewed his lip.
Teddy nodded. He didn’t meet Draco’s eyes. Draco pursed his lips. Then he waved his wand so that the rest of the salad ingredients could start preparing themselves – the cucumber slicing itself on the mandolin as the olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette poured themselves in equal measure into a jar – and came around to sit down next to Teddy.
Harry let out a long breath through his nose before answering. “Ron, come on, Hermione’s right. He has changed a lot over the past ten years.”
, Draco! I love
“Hey.” Harry flicked Draco’s nose to get him to open his eyes, which he did with an indignant yelp. “You didn’t kill Fred. You didn’t force George’s hand. And you can’t be held responsible for what your father did.”
“Fine,” he said. “Nothing I haven’t heard before. She must have spoken with my father, it’s like Easter all over again.” He tried to laugh, but it came out a sob. Harry reached up, his fingers brushing Draco’s jaw as Draco twisted away, stepping back from the other man. He shook his head, his smile contorting as he said, “I should go, I’m sorry, this was a mistake.”
He didn’t read the rest. Instead, he scrawled at the end of her neat paragraph,
“It certainly looks that way.” He moved his queen out of harm’s way, his smirk falling into a small frown. “I’m sure I’ll find something to do on Christmas Day,” he mumbled as Harry defended his only bishop from Draco’s malicious-looking knight. Harry’s brow furrowed.
“Why, Draco?” he asked, his voice a hoarse echo of the imperious sneer Harry knew so well. “You knew it was Potter. Surely you must have known. Why didn’t you say so?”
“Yeah,” Potter mumbled. “It should be fun.”
The curtains were yanked back. Draco looked up, startled, wand raised. Harry stood there, chest heaving, out of breath. He mouthed, “Can you hear me?” Draco shook his head and lowered the charm, only to raise it again when Harry had climbed onto the bed across from him. Harry’s cheeks were flushed and there were tears in his eyes again, but he grew pale at the sight of Draco’s arm. Draco wasn’t sure if it was the sight of the Mark or the red, raw skin that made Harry blanche. Either way, he moved to pull his sleeve back up to hide it all. Harry was too fast, though. He caught Draco’s wrist and forced his arm up, to bare the angry skin to the light. With his other hand, he traced trembling fingertips up and down the Mark, the ridges left by Draco’s ragged nails. Draco inhaled with a hiss at his cool touch. Still Harry did not let go.
“Huh. So, what changed?”
Harry shook his head, but he couldn’t stifle his grin. “Tosser.”
“You have a lot of explaining to do, young man,” she said. Harry smiled sheepishly. He shrugged and ran a hand through his hair.
Harry’s scowl intensified, especially when Malfoy tried to strike a ‘sexy pose’. It was only for the sake of his own reputation that he didn’t break down into a fit of giggles. The officer by the fireplace just looked confused. Harry let out a huff. “You’re being very cavalier for someone being targeted by a murderer,” he snapped. He strode off in the direction of what he assumed to be the bedroom, and didn’t see Malfoy shrug.
Draco took his hand, and Harry pulled him to his feet. Draco knew he was blushing, could feel his cheeks and ears burning, but he didn’t care. He could hear the others whispering and giggling, could hear Astoria calling his name, but it didn’t matter. Harry’s hand was warm in his, and Harry was pulling him towards the stairs up to the dorms, and all he could see was Harry, Harry, Harry. Someone wolf-whistled behind them – Draco had a sneaking suspicion it was Luna.
“Well, yeah,” Harry replied. He leaned back in his seat, crossing his arms behind his head. “If we’re going to be friends, it only makes sense that I know what you like.”
“Okay, fine,” he said at last. “That’s enough out of you.”
The kitchen was long and narrow, with a galley kitchen and a massive stone fireplace next to a no longer functioning Victorian range. It was, by far, Draco’s favourite room in the house, filled as it was with all the familiarity of domesticity – herbs drying above the stove, jars and boxes of teas arranged on the countertops, a bouquet of daisies in a chipped blue jug on the table. He was sure some of these were Ginny’s touches, but he also couldn’t help but see Harry in every detail, from the massive box of PG tips to the Stasis spell on the flowers to keep them from dying too quickly.
He knocked on the doorframe to the guest room, even though the door was wide open.
“Surely there’s another empty compartment somewhere,” Draco drawled, leaning his head back against the seat as he looked the young man up and down. “Or I’m sure any of your fans would be happy for you to sit with them. Where’s Granger and Weasel? Or better, the Weaselette? They must be saving a seat for you somewhere.”
“Just letting you know that I understand,” he replied. “So you can stop staring daggers at me. I mean no harm.”
“Why?” Harry demanded. He cocked his head innocently. “Is it because he’s an ex-Death Eater, or because he’s my date? Because if it’s the former, trust me, those days are behind him. If it’s the latter, well.” He leaned forward and lowered his voice to a stage whisper, “Let’s just say that you might not get to, er,
Malfoy turned. He looked just as surprised as Harry was to see him. He held a glass of whiskey close to his chest as he leaned back against the railing, but any attempt to appear nonchalant was betrayed by his white-knuckled grip on the iron behind him. He was dressed nicely, much nicer than anyone inside, but not ostentatious – simple white button down and charcoal grey trousers, black Oxfords polished so well they gleamed in the light pouring from the flat. Harry felt shabby in comparison. Black T-shirt and jeans no longer seemed so appropriate for a house-warming.
Ron brightened almost immediately at the mention of food. He sat down, eagerly craning his neck to see if he could see any servers with the dinner service. Hermione chuckled to herself as she took her seat next to him. Before they sat down, Harry turned to face Draco, his arms still around Draco’s waist while Draco rested his hands on Harry’s shoulders.
And yet, here he was, standing with his front paws on Harry’s lap, shoving his face into Harry’s as Harry pet him, looking more than a little taken aback. Scorpius’s purrs were deafening. Harry looked up at Draco who still stood frozen in the doorway, holding the tea tray in absolute consternation. He shrugged.
“Yes,” Draco forced himself to say. His fingers fiddled with the note in his pocket as the madness of his situation settled in. He looked down at his shoes. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have come, I just heard you were leaving the Ministry, leaving London, and I – I’m sorry, I was mistaken, I’ll just go – ”
They drove down the old dirt road towards the farm in the tiny car Ron had inherited from his brother Charlie who lived in Romania working on wildlife conservation. Ron had the windows rolled down, and the smell of warm grass and green earth blew through the car with the dry wind. Harry rested his arm on the open window, his hand hanging out and catching the air as they drove. For a while, it was quiet except for the sound of the radio.
“Four
“I’m sorry for missing tea yesterday. Mother Floo’d and – Father has been really sick recently – had, had been – you see, he….” Malfoy trailed off. Harry saw his Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed, hard. Malfoy closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. “Father passed away. Yesterday morning. Pneumonia. They could have treated it if he were anywhere but Azkaban.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “You would need that memory in court when you finally bring the perp to trial,” he argued. “Then everyone would see it.” Harry let out a huff. He hated when Malfoy was right.
“You know I’m right, Harry! And what? George goes to Azkaban for doing something that during the war would have made him a hero? What’s right about that? Where’s the
“I don’t think we will. Although I wouldn’t mind a holiday there sometime.”
Harry gulped as Draco began to nibble and suck a love bite at the base of his neck, trying desperately not to buck his hips up at the pleasure Draco’s mouth was giving him. He groaned. “Draco. Draco – ungh – listen, we should slow down,” he tried to argue. Why was he objecting? Draco’s hands were tugging at his shirt, and it took everything Harry had to cover his hands with his own, stilling them and holding Draco back from tearing the shirt off of him. He managed to hold both of Draco’s hands in one of his while the other pushed Draco, reluctantly, back from sucking another hickey into his collar bone so that he could look him in the eye. Draco’s lips were glossy and bruised, and Harry had to ignore the way that made the heat pool in his groin. He swallowed hard and took a deep breath.
“Yeah,” he said, smiling up at Draco. “I do.” Draco beamed.
Draco hummed to himself as he made his morning coffee the next day. Pansy raised a carefully plucked eyebrow as she ate her toast. Draco didn’t even make his usual comment of insisting that she wear more than a thin bathrobe to breakfast while he turned the wireless on, a little skip in his step as he picked out an apple to eat.
“You’re not the most observant person, you have to admit.”
“I don’t know,” he managed to whisper through the knot in his throat. “I want this, but… I can’t… I don’t… it’s not working.” He buried his face in his hands, pressing his palms against his stinging eyes, because there was no way he was going to cry in front of Harry Potter. But then he felt Harry’s warm, calloused hands on his wrists, trying to pull his hands down. Then he was looking back into those green eyes behind the wire-rimmed glasses, at the gentle face with its scar and freckles against cinnamon skin, and before he knew it the tears were rolling down his cheeks and there it was. He was crying in front of Harry Potter.
Something white flashed in the doorway, before disappearing into the darkened hallway.
position, your
“What good comes from you staying in this house forever, sitting in your own self-pity?” Harry replied before he was aware of what he was saying.
Harry bit his lip and ducked his head, wringing his hands in his lap. Hermione’s eyes narrowed.
“No, no, sir,” he insisted. “Young master could never harm them! Even when they argued he was always very civil. No, no, Wilkins won’t believe such lies!”
When he had initially gone into lockdown with Draco, he’d had Kellen send Ron and Hermione a letter briefly explaining the situation with as vague details as possible, not once mentioning Draco’s name – ‘I’m protecting a witness, we are in a safe location, no visitors, contact can only be made through Kellen or another member of the DMLE, etc.’. Hermione understood all of this, she wrote, but still wanted to call and check in with her best friend. Harry had Kellen get Robards, and the three of them agreed – he was allowed one fifteen-minute call, so long as Hermione and Ron used the DMLE Floo, just to be safe. Their security measures had grown increasingly strict with the last set of attacks, and none of them wanted to take any chances.
“I can imagine.” He trailed his fingers up and down Draco’s back as he thought. Draco shivered at the touch. Still, he did not pull away. “You want to tell me what’s been going on?” Harry asked. Draco let out a ragged sigh.
“We should go back to the dormitory,” he said at last, gesturing at the stairs. “Try to get some sleep.”
“What do you think?” he spat. “Father never approved of who I am, but it wasn’t like I was waiting around for him to die to start dating Harry!”
“But if it’s an assassin,” said Harry, “who hired them?”
When McGonagall showed them to the eighth-year dormitory, Harry leaned over to Hermione and asked, “Does Malfoy look different to you?” She rolled her eyes.
“When I… died, it was 2001. When I arrived here, it was 1980. It would seem the universe has decided that I should relive these years in this alternate world, some kind of cosmic joke or punishment, I can’t tell which. I didn’t understand why until you showed up. I think I was meant to get to know you, to understand the other side of the story, as it is.” He closed his eyes for a moment, his face drawn and exhausted. “So there you have it,” he said. “That’s my story. Now, if you want to go off and live the rest of your life, free of my cursed existence, you can do so. But at least you know the truth.”
“I’m right here, you know,” Draco protested, straightening up a bit in his attempt to look dignified. His body was starting to gripe about sitting on the hard stone hearth, and he crossed his legs, trying to get comfortable. “And I would rather not be made responsible for my criminally insane aunt, thank you very much.”
By the time Harry finished explaining, Draco wasn’t sure who he wanted to hex, Ron or Robards. He took a deep breath. Then another. Then he dropped his head into his hands. He let out a quiet stream of swear words as he stared at his knees.
He should have left Vincent and Greg outside the Room of Hidden Things. He shouldn’t have let them shadow him the way they’ve done all his life. Maybe, maybe, if he had told them the truth, Vince would still be alive. Or they would have abandoned him, maybe even killed him for the traitor he was.
The crowd burst into hushed exclamations and disapproving whispers. George spat at Malfoy, a globule of phlegm flying through the air. The judge banged her gavel, calling for order. Harry caught Draco’s eye and held it imploringly, sympathetically, desperately.
“Hullo,” mumbled Teddy, looking Draco up and down with renewed curiosity. Draco smiled, a nervous tightness in the corners of his mouth as he turned to Andromeda.
Myrtle didn’t move at first. Harry took a step forward, looking up at her with his earnest green eyes. “Give us a minute, alright? I won’t hurt him, we just need to talk.”
“Er…”
are behind you, aren’t they? Schoolboy crushes, nothing more.”
This started off as an epilogue and now there might be a third chapter coming soon oh no
Harry nodded, biting his lip. She slumped back in her chair. Ron came in, plate heaped with bacon and eggs and a slice of toast in his mouth. He must have sensed the change in atmosphere as he stopped and took the toast out of his mouth.
“Yeah? I’m here, I’m here.”
“What gave you that impression?” he asked. He tried to keep his voice as nonchalant as possible, even as his heart raced against his ribcage.
“I… I don’t have the same drive, the same instinct as everyone else, I think.”
Harry grinned. “France sounds nice,” he said. He crawled over to Draco, straddling Draco’s lap and tilting Draco’s chin up to look him in the eye. Draco found that without even thinking about he had put his hands on Harry’s waist, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. “So we’re in agreement?” Harry asked. “We’ll write to
He raised an eyebrow. “Scared, Malfoy?” he teased. Draco laughed and gave his boyfriend a quick, chaste kiss.
Harry didn’t move. How could Malfoy know? He held his breath, wondering if Malfoy would change his mind and leave the compartment. But Malfoy had locked the door, and now he was turning on his heel to stare right at where Harry was curled up under the Cloak in the luggage rack. Malfoy frowned, lips twisting.
“You don’t have to just teach at Hogwarts, you know,” Draco pointed out. “You could go anywhere. Go to America and teach at Ilvermorny. I hear Americans love a British accent. Or Beauxbatons, although you might break my heart and run off with a French person.”
“Malfoy?”
Harry stroked his hair, pressed a quick kiss to the top of Draco’s head. “I know,” he whispered back.
He heard an intake of breath and looked over his shoulder. Harry stood, leaning against the doorframe, watching him from a distance. He was barefoot and wore a tight black jumper that stretched across his broad chest and a pair of dark wash jeans. His green eyes reminded Draco of a cat, the way they looked him up and down, like he was a mouse Harry considered eating. Harry pushed his glasses up his slightly crooked nose with a smile.
Then Draco was torn from him by a pair of freckled hands. Harry’s breath caught in his throat as he tried to blink away the tears, to see what was going on. As if through thick cotton, he heard Ron yell, “Get off him, you bastard!” and Hermione screaming for Ron to “stop, please, God, stop!” Then he seemed to catch up with the world, and there was Ron pinning Draco to the ground as he hit him again and again, even as Hermione tried to pull him off. Harry grabbed at Ron’s shoulder, shouting at him to stop as he finally managed to drag him off Draco’s shaking, bleeding body.
Harry visited the old manor house four times a year, every year, almost without fail. In the summer and winter, it was easier to sneak out of his aunt and uncle’s house without being noticed, happy as they were to ignore him as much as possible. For Beltane, he would drop by after school, but he couldn’t stay as long as the other times. Hallowe’en was tricky, because he could rarely shake off Hermione and Ron who usually wanted to spend that evening trick or treating or else binging horror films as they shoved candy into their mouths. Somehow, though, he always managed it. For years, he visited Draco, getting to know the young man in the old house.
Harry couldn’t hold it back anymore. He doubled over laughing, which only served to anger the king further. His cheeks went from slightly flushed to bright red, and he clenched his fists. He looked ready to burst. But, seeing Harry bracing himself up with his hands on his knees as he shook with laughter, Draco seemed to mull over his words. He pressed his lips into a thin line, which morphed into a tight smile, and then he was grinning back at Harry, a small chuckle escaping from his chest.
There was a pause, then,
Harry nodded, leaning into Draco’s hand on his cheek. Draco pulled him down into a long, lingering kiss, pulling away every now and then to kiss away the tears. With each touch, Draco tried to let Harry know that this was starting over, this was forgiveness, this was what he promised to give and more.
“Really, that made the list?” Harry deadpanned. Ron glared at him, and he sighed. “No, I know all that. But he’s apologised a million times over for what happened, and for Merlin’s sake, we were kids! And he served his time….”
Harry kicked him.
He had given up, then. That is, until a man came to his aunt and uncle’s house, claiming to be his godfather.
Harry shrugged. “Let me decide that. Off.”
Part of the roof had caved in over the year. Some of the boards over the windows had begun to rot and come away. The ivy had almost devoured the entire front of the building, covering the stone in glossy green leaves and hungry vines. Harry hesitated at the window to the drawing room, his stomach twisting itself into a knot. He bit his lip. Then he tossed his rucksack in before crawling in himself.
She hadn’t seen the horse coming. And Harry couldn’t save her.
“Mm. She’s my flatmate.”
“You never saw them together,” Harry pointed out, a ghost of a smile at the corners of his mouth. “When they saw each other in the Shrieking Shack back in third year, it was like – like they were finally whole again.” His voice trailed off, his eyes growing distant again, retreating back into his thoughts. Hermione nodded.
“It’s not – it’s just – it’s the principal of the matter.” Malfoy looked up at the ceiling, trying to collect himself. Harry relaxed his grip a bit – he could feel Malfoy’s pulse race against his fingertips, the sensation alone making his stomach flip. Malfoy swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. Finally, he looked back down at Harry. “Just that moment, right? Nothing else from that day?”
Draco shook his head, but he couldn’t help smiling back with relief. Harry had been miserable since they had first run into each other at Ginny and Luna’s party. The job had taken more than its usual toll on Harry’s mental health – if he had thought the panic attacks were bad, it was nothing compared to the night terrors. Half the nights they spent together ended with Draco calming Harry down from a nightmare, and more than once he’d woken up with a wand pointed at his face when Harry woke up and couldn’t remember where he was. He’d been telling Harry to quit for ages, and now…. He came up behind Harry and wrapped him up in his arms, hugging him close.
April 1999
“Harry,” Draco murmured. “Look at me.”
Shock flashed across Draco’s face – had he not realised what he had said? Then he clenched his haw, his hands curling into fists at his sides to hide how badly they were trembling. “I think you know why,” he said, quiet and sure.
“Thanks for that,” Malfoy said, trying to pass it off as an off-hand comment even as a pink blush bloomed across his cheeks. “Although I guess you’ll just be cuffing me again anyway.” He held out his hands, chin lifted and jaw squared off, his pride still intact. “Go on then, let’s get this over with.”
“It’s okay,” said Harry, just as Draco said, “that’s quite alright.” Thunder rumbled in the distance. Harry pulled Andromeda into a one-arm hug as Draco, his arm around Harry’s waist, gave him a small squeeze. They looked down at the chalky earth, the dry soil punctuated here and there as the rain began to fall, slowly then in earnest. Teddy rushed over to them, his arms over his head to protect himself from the rain.
“Please. Thank you, Potter.” She sat with a sigh. Harry busied himself with setting the kettle on the wood-burning stove in his office and pulling out the tea things, already reaching for McGonagall’s favourite cup. It was Friday afternoon, the week before term started. It was routine for them at this point after five years – she would come to his office, he would ask if she wanted tea and she would always say yes, and they would talk about the upcoming year, mainly in terms of the Gryffindor Quidditch team’s chances for the Cup. As much as she thrived as Headmistress, Harry suspected she missed being head of Gryffindor house and being able to cheer for her house team. Being impartial was not her cup of tea.
Malfoy nodded once, his lips pressed into a thin line, but Harry could see the smile lingering at the corners of his eyes. When Harry came into the guest room a few minutes later, laden with an extra quilt Molly had made him as a housewarming gift, Malfoy was already curled up under the covers. Harry let out a slow breath and made his way over to the cot, only to find a book resting on top of his pillow. Harry set the quilt down and picked up the book.
“Curiosity.” He paused, then added, seemingly out of the blue, “Ginny and I broke up.”
As Harry finished applying the salves and Draco’s breath evened out as the spells began to work their way into his skin, Harry cleaned up the bottles and the bloodied cloth. When he returned, he wasn’t sure if Draco had fallen asleep or not. Either way, he laid down next to him, trying not to bump into the other man. He picked up Draco’s hand to brush his lips against the knuckles. Draco’s mouth curled into a smile.
“Draco!” He smiled at the other boy, maybe a little too cheerfully based on the way Draco raised his eyebrows. “You going to Hogsmeade tomorrow?”
“What happened? To Malfoy Manor, that is.” Harry rolled over in bed to face Draco, who lay stretched out on his back with one arm tucked behind his head.
Draco closed his eyes, the memory of that night washing over him. His father, stinking of Firewhiskey, raging about losing a bet, had stormed out of their tent, murder in his eyes. Draco had hidden in his bed, hoping his father would come back and sleep it off. But then there were the screams, the jeers, the curses. He had stumbled out of their tent into chaos, had watched in horror as the bodies of the Muggle groundskeeper’s family were lifted into the air like limp ragdolls and paraded around the campsite like trophies of war. That night would haunt Draco the rest of his life. That night, he began to doubt.
Hermione wrung her hands. “I don’t know who else it could be,” she said, “but they didn’t mention them by name, so it really could be – ”
Harry frowned at the message. He typed back:
“Draco,” he said. “Have any of your previous boyfriends…met your mother?”
Andromeda sent Harry an owl on Monday morning. Harry, running late for work, brought the letter with him so that he could read it at his desk before diving into the pile of paperwork Senior Auror Singh had left for him. When Ron came over with coffee, he found Harry grinning ear to ear as he finished reading Andromeda’s letter. He raised his eyebrows and set Harry’s mug of coffee on his paper-strewn desk – seriously, how the man ever knew where anything was, Ron had no idea.
“I was invited,” he replied coolly. “I imagine you were as well. This is a party, is it not?”
Harry saw a flash of white blond hair from the till. No. No, it couldn’t be. He frowned and leaned around the women in front of him who seemed to be ordering at least a dozen incredibly specific drinks. It was. Harry’s jaw dropped just as the man behind the till looked up at him.
“I know I should, and I want you, I really do.”
Draco blinked as he mulled the words over in his head. He thought about Harry, weeks ago now, when Draco had told him he didn’t need to marry Ginny.
“‘Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement,’” Draco quoted, his voice shaking. In any other moment, Harry would have teased him for quoting Tolkien, but now, his heart was in his throat and all he could do was look at Draco with all his love.
He didn’t usually go during the winter holidays. The towpaths tended to flood, or the mud made it difficult to make the journey. Once, he had had to climb over the baffle gate which had frozen shut. It was harder to leave the Manor during the winter, when there was mulled apple cider by the fire and mince pies to be eaten. But the year he turned sixteen, Draco found every excuse he could to escape the Manor, to be alone in the cold and empty fields, where no one could stumble on him weeping and screaming and lashing out at the undergrowth.
“Ron? Yeah. Get the team and come to my floor. Could use some back up here.”
“No,” Harry assured him. “No, I understand. It’s, er, part of the job. Have to protect the witness,” he explained when Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “I’ll set up a cot at the end of the bed, and I can move the dresser in front of the fireplace to make sure it’s completely blocked. How does that sound?”
Without fully realising what he was doing, he reached out and brushed his knuckles along the sharp cut of Draco’s cheekbones. Draco jumped slightly at first, before relaxing into the touch. Harry’s stomach fluttered as he switched to trailing his fingertips along the sweep of his jaw, down the curve of his neck. Draco swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. He didn’t meet Harry’s gaze at first. Doubting himself, Harry made to pull away, to apologise.
“No!” Draco spluttered. “But you obviously think I do! You all do!”
“Hermione,” Ginny and Draco said in unison. Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Known what?”
Teddy bit his lip as he looked from one godfather to the other. Draco gave him an encouraging nod. With a long sigh, Teddy mumbled, “I think I fancy boys
“Is that Harry?” Molly Weasley poked her head out from the kitchen. “Harry, dear! When did you get here?”
Harry blushed as he sat down next to Charlie. “Oh, erm, Ron didn’t tell you?” he asked. Charlie raised an eyebrow. “It’s, erm, Draco Malfoy.”
Sometimes, Draco would show him around the house, tell him stories about the people in the portraits. There were secret passageways that connected to rooms and staircases – most likely service passages for maids and servants back in the day, but Harry liked to think of them as secret passageways. Other times, he and Draco would lounge in Draco’s bedroom, talking about their childhoods, old stories, new stories, whatever came to mind. Harry knew he could trust Draco with anything, because who else was the man going to tell? He was a ghost trapped in a manor that not even the homeless or drug addicts would touch.
“Yeah,” he said, his voice muffled. “It is.”
Dean won twenty Galleons that night. He and Neville had been playing a game of wizard chess when Harry and Draco stepped through the portrait hole holding hands. When Dean saw their blushing, beaming faces, he clambered onto his chair and announced to the crowded common room, “Pay up, lads!”
“Seriously, Hermione?” Harry scoffed. “How the hell is he supposed to answer that?”
Malfoy pressed his lips together, his smile growing small as he shrugged and looked away. “Ah, well, that’s a long story.” He sighed, shifting so that he once again had his back against the wall. “As I said earlier, I had a client who ordered a specific potion – I can’t tell you what, client-Potion Master confidentiality – but it required powdered Erumpent horn. Now, I tried to substitute it for something else, but I couldn’t get it to work, so I began to scour the markets for powdered Erumpent horn. Nothing.” He stretched his legs out in front of him with a slight scowl. Harry thought that would be the end of it, but after a deep breath, Malfoy launched into a fast-paced story that, if his arms weren’t bound, Harry was sure would have included elaborate gesticulations.
“You’re just figuring that out now?” he asked. Harry rolled his eyes even as he chuckled in relief.
Harry nodded. Draco pulled away to press both hands over his mouth. Tears sparkled in his eyes. Harry wasn’t sure if he could smile or not. Finally, Draco lowered his hands slightly.
Harry didn’t know what to do. Or, rather, he knew what he wanted to do, just not what he should do. But in the end, his heart won out over their horrible past. He pulled Draco into his arms and held him as he wept. Draco’s arms wound around his waist, his forehead pressed against Harry’s shoulder, his tears soaking through Harry’s woollen jumper, the damp fabric itching against his skin. Harry rubbed slow circles on his back. He could feel Draco’s ribs, the ridges of his spine. He had noticed how sunken Draco’s eyes had become, how gaunt his cheeks, but this more than anything worried him, and that’s what it was – worry, not suspicion. He realised then, holding Draco in his arms, that he genuinely cared about him. They were just boys, playing at being men.
When he opened his eyes, he let out a sharp bark of laughter and immediately covered his mouth to muffle the sound. He had done it. Almost shaking with giddiness, he reached out a hand towards his star-lit Patronus.
Draco nodded. He knew that feeling intimately. Knew it in his bones. The dread he woke up with each morning, the fear that the Mark would flare up, the certainty that any day now, someone or something would come for them, make them fight for their lives again. But each day went much like the last, and nothing was coming.
Ron threw his hands in the air with a strangled noise of protest. Hermione shook her head, a small, pitying smile on her lips.
Lucius flinched. His hands fell to his sides, clenching into fists. He opened and closed his mouth a couple times, but no sound came out. He cleared his throat. “You didn’t answer my question,” he said at last. Draco shrugged one shoulder, his eyes like ice cutting into his father, who couldn’t meet his gaze.
“Draco.”
“That is for me to know and for you to find out. Which you will only be able to do if you get drinks with Potter.”
Necromancy was not a career one chose. Like royalty, it was something one was born into, and Harry wished every day that Death had chosen a different person. But when another necromancer, driven mad by a prophecy he was determined to disprove, killed Harry’s parents and tried to kill Harry, Death only smiled. The curse rebounded. The necromancer was thrown back into Hel, and Harry was marked by Death’s hand – a scar that split across his forehead like lightning, silver against copper skin.
In the end, Harry left the office that night convinced that it would take them years to solve the case. Wanting to clear his head a bit, he walked home from the Ministry instead of Apparating. It was a clear, warm summer night, the sky ablaze with the late setting sun. The square near Grimmauld Place was full of life, the trees waving their young leaves at Harry as he passed, the sound of children laughing and muffled conversation drifting on the breeze. Harry smiled to himself. He forgot, sometimes, that life went on.
“Interested in, er, having a boyfriend.”
“Get close to you, obviously,” Ron argued. Harry rolled his eyes, chuckling.
, “hoe many people live there?”
“That makes sense,” she said. “I’ve been reading about his work at St. Mungo’s, he has some really interesting ideas on the use of folk magic in medicine.”
Harry’s mouth twitched. “Yeah, but from what I understand, sex is a big part of it,” he pointed out. Draco shrugged.
“If Harry is helping, I can help,” Draco argued. Harry turned, confused at Draco’s sudden insistence on being useful.
“Everything alright, mate?” Ron asked. Harry forced a smile.
Draco sighed sharply, his shoulders falling dramatically as he turned at last to Harry, dropping his hands onto the cutting board with a clatter. “Do I have to spell it out for you, Potter?” he demanded, frowning.
Malfoy blinked. “Who’s Craig? And why does he have a list?”
Harry turned to look over his shoulder at Draco, still standing there holding a cup in each hand. He raised an eyebrow. A small smirk played at the corners of his mouth as something clicked in those brilliant green eyes.
“Oh.” He pulled his trouser leg down to hide it. “Nothing. Forget it.”
In which Draco begrudgingly gets drinks with Harry... "for science."
“Your cologne is nice,” Harry blurted out, desperate to break the silence. Malfoy chuckled.
Malfoy considered this, his hands dropping into his lap as he leaned back against the wall. He let out a small laugh. “Maybe. I wouldn’t put it pass the old codger. More likely he wanted us to sort out our little rivalry before we graduated, I imagine. That sounds more like him.”
“We’re coming, dear. Why don’t you pour us all some tea?”
“You guys think I’m crazy, don’t you?” Teddy mumbled.
Malfoy inclined his head towards her, even as he muttered under his breath, “You always call your partner by her full title?”
Draco shook his bowed head. “No, no, I understand that,” he said. “I accepted that the minute you started talking about applying to university. No, it’s just…” He looked up at Harry then, a strained set to his jaw. “I think it’s time I told you the whole story.”
Draco stood frozen in the doorway. He swore under his breath. With Potter looking like that, there was no way he was focusing on the case today. Potter must have heard him. He looked up from the papers in his hand and grinned at Draco. Draco tried to pull his usual sneer, but it came off as more of a half-hearted smile as he forced his shaky legs to walk him over to the chair opposite Potter’s desk. He sat without a word and reached for the steaming coffee waiting for him.
He had never been to the Black residence, not even as a child and Walburga Black was still alive. His mother did not like her aunt much, and Draco didn’t blame her, based on the stories he grew up with. In any case, it looked like Harry had done his best to remove every trace of her and centuries of traditional Pureblood taste from his new home. Maybe the furniture was the same, just reupholstered – the claw-footed, bottle green velvet sofa gleamed in the light from the tall windows, an antique rug covered the polished floorboards, and a leather armchair was positioned next to a small end table covered in old copies of
Malfoy’s astonishment was quickly replaced with weary acknowledgement. “Right. Well.” He cleared his throat and gestured out to the hall, “I’m going to take a shower and, er, get ready for bed, I guess.”
Draco sat up, silencing Harry with a kiss. “Of course,” he murmured with a small smile against Harry’s lips. “I’d like that.”
Harry frowned. “But why?” He reached out and, grabbing Draco’s elbow, pulled him to a stop. Draco exhaled sharply, jaw clenched as he refused to meet Harry’s gaze. Harry didn’t let go. “I don’t understand.”
Harry pushed his glasses up his nose with a smirk. “Sure,” he said, drawing out the syllable as he relaxed back into his chair. He shook his head with a chuckle. “You are full of surprises, Draco.”
“Draco.”
“What? I panicked! I went to my flat first, but the second I got there I knew that was a mistake and apparated and, and – the next thing I knew, I was in Scotland. Not too far from Hogsmeade, I think, just near the Hog’s Head.” The words tumbled out of his mouth in a rush, as if once he had begun, he couldn’t stem the flow. “I walked until I found a barn and stayed there as long as I could. Then I cast a glamour on myself and went into Hogsmeade, got some supplies. I ended up camping out in the Shrieking Shack, of all places.” He and Harry shared a look, both remembering a day back when they were thirteen, mud and a disembodied head.
“Everything’s fine,” Harry reassured Draco. He stood. Draco, a small crease between his brows, frowned at him but nonetheless said his goodbyes as Harry wrapped his arm around the taller man’s waist and steered him away. Draco looked back at Hermione and Ron over his shoulder and gave them a confused little wave as they walked away.
Harry leaned against the wall, arms crossed over his chest, his wand loose in his hand as he tapped it against his ribcage. He had wanted to run off with the rest of the team to chase down the suspect, but Auror Dawkins had ordered him to stay and guard the witness – or potential accomplice, only time would tell. So here he was, in the rundown basement flat, a splash of crimson robes against grey walls, guarding Draco Malfoy.
“Draco, are you okay? God, I’m so sorry, I…”
“I don’t know what I believe in,” he said at last. “Just the certainty of death.”
Potter shrugged. “You’re right,” he said. “Dean, Luna and the Patil twins are sat just down the corridor, I could go and be with them.”
“The young master,” he said, choosing his words with care, “had an argument with master, a few years ago now. Then, last Christmas, the young master visited, said he wanted to make amends, and master and mistress were so happy. Oh, Wilkins was overjoyed, sir. This was only the second time since then that he’s visited, sir – it was to be breakfast, then master and mistress were going to give the young master a couple of presents – a notebook from master and mistress had gotten him a lovely set of dress robes – and then they were going to walk about the grounds, just like they used to when young master was a boy, or so Wilkins has been told, Wilkins was not with the family then.”
“After dinner. Come get a drink with us.”
“Yes, well, I imagine living at the school does mean you are in close quarters with each other,” Narcissa said slowly.
“Slow down, Potter,” he murmured, his hand brushing against Harry’s neck, fingers threading into his curls. “Just enjoy it.”
Harry shook his head, then paused. “Something…did happen… or rather, didn’t happen.”
“What about you?” Ron asked. “You got an eye on any of the blokes in school? Must be hard for you to find any of them attractive after all this time.”
He turned the page to the table of contents, where each chapter was dedicated to a different wizarding family. He trailed his index finger down the list, turning the page as it continued in alphabetical order, passing Black, Longbottom, Lovegood and Malfoy. His finger froze when he found it.
Harry, who had been setting his glasses on the bedside table, froze. Malfoy’s words hung in the air, waiting for a response. He took a deep breath, then another.
“Am I what, Potter?”
They never actually talked about what happened the day of Harry’s suspension. Ron had come over for tea a few days after, probably at Hermione’s behest, and after an awkward moment of them both staring at their shoes, they had carried on as normal. At Christmas, he had noticed Ron glaring daggers at Draco, but amidst the hubbub of Weasleys, it was easy to guide Draco out of firing range. It had helped that Teddy was there. He and Draco were practically inseparable the entire time, and if Draco noticed Ron’s glaring, he didn’t say anything.
“Are you doing anything tomorrow?” Malfoy asked.
“Because I
“Yeah?”
“I know you don’t want to do this – this – whatever he sent you to do. You could be a double agent, like Snape.” Malfoy looked up, blinking in surprise. Still, he shook his head, biting his lip. Harry stepped forward and grabbed hold of Malfoy’s arm, right over where he knew the Mark to be. Malfoy winced like he’d burned him. Harry frowned.
“No,” Malfoy said at last, his expression clearing until all that remained of his scowl was a slight crease between his brows. “I just… You make no sense, Potter. Why are you being so nice to me? First at my trial and then on the first night and now…” He bit his lip. It was the most Harry had heard him speak in the past several weeks. “You hate me,” Malfoy continued, his voice barely audible as he looked at Harry, his grey, rain-coloured eyes lost and confused. “I fought against you. Why are you treating me like a….”
“For you, no charge,” he rumbled with a sly smile when Draco tried to pay. Draco stammered, flushing scarlet, and quickly turned away, grabbing Pansy’s wrist and pulling her into the crowd with him. Once he was out of the bartender’s eyesight, he downed half his drink in one go. Pansy raised her eyebrows at him.
“We kissed, alright?”
“Because,” he said, “it’s Malfoy. That git has been tormenting you and your friends for years, me included. Why the change of heart?”
Draco gave him a thin-lipped smile. He set his cup on the table and nodded.
. He nodded once.
“I love poetry,” he whispered. He looked up at Draco in amazement. “How did you know?”
“It’s just – you looked… wistful,” Harry said as he came over to him. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. “I didn’t know you liked kids.”
From this angle, Harry could see a pretty little flush creep up the back of Malfoy’s neck. “Of course,” Malfoy said slowly – not patronisingly, but rather as if he was resisting the urge to throttle Harry. “I am going to go get… presentable. Please excuse me.” Without waiting for their response, Malfoy pivoted on his heel and strode off, stomping up the stairs.
had returned to him after his trial – and cast a
“Draco?”
Harry’s eyes had already closed. He burrowed back down further under the covers, his head half against the pillow and half on Draco’s chest. Draco held him there, slowly running his fingers through Harry’s wild curls as he fell back to sleep.
“Christ on a bike, you scared me!” He stood, still massaging his chest. Draco didn’t look the least bit apologetic. In fact, in his pressed charcoal-grey trousers with matching blazer over a black turtleneck, he looked the definition of posh. As they set off with the rest of the students, lingering a little behind the group, Draco easily fell into stride next to Harry with a smirk.
“She knows I’m here?” Harry asked. Malfoy raised his eyebrows, his attention focused on his breakfast.
Draco smelled like pine and cedar cologne, like garlic and thyme and basil. His skin was warm through his thin cotton T-shirt, his chest solid against his. Harry felt his ribcage expand and contract with each breath, and he marvelled at it, the simple act of breathing. Draco’s arms around Harry’s waist cautiously pulled him in, as if unsure if this was a joke, if Harry was going to push him away. His touch, his warmth, his smell sent thrills down Harry’s spine, made his heart race, made something tense low and deep in his belly – oh no.
“I forgive you. If I’ve realised anything over the past few months of living with you, it’s that you’re growing. You’re becoming a better person than you were. And I like who you are becoming.”
“Office!” Draco blurted out. “In his office! He has a very nice office. Great view of the grounds.”
“Wait. You saw? I knew it was you! I knew I heard something that night!” Draco’s grin at the realisation crumpled almost immediately, uncertain. “Are you just saying that because you saw my Patronus? Because you don’t want to hurt my feelings or – ”
“And whose fault is that?” Draco sneered. Lucius glared at him, but Draco pressed on, his newfound confidence overruling any sense of filial piety. “Besides, I’m seeing someone. We’ve moved in together. His name is ­– ”
Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s hands as he rushed to say, “No, no, don’t be sorry. I don’t mind.”
“Bloody hell, Draco,” he said, voice just above a whisper. “And I thought I used to be on your bad side.”
Harry came home from a long day at work, a heaviness in his limbs as he dragged himself through the Floo. He and now full Auror Kellen, no longer a Junior, were trying to piece together the case of a smuggling ring, the details of which were too horrid for Harry to talk about outside of the office. Draco was already in the kitchen making dinner. He had moved in the week before when the lease on his flat had ended, and if Harry had raised an eyebrow when Draco showed up with all his moving boxes, all Draco said was, “I’ve basically been living here, why pay rent for a flat I don’t even like?”
But Harry turned and vaulted through the open window. The minute his feet touched the ground, he took off running, Draco’s voice calling his name echoing in his ears. He didn’t look back.
Harry laughed derisively. “Nah, they’re more fans of boxing than dancing.” His lips curled in a parody of a smile. “It’s fine, really, they’ve done worse.”
“Right,” Malfoy said. “That’s £4.30, then.”
Ginny turned on Draco then. Her brown eyes pierced straight through him, and he quailed almost immediately. “Then why,” she demanded, addressing Harry but never once looking away from Draco, “does
One brisk October evening, sometime around midnight, Draco found himself climbing the steps to the Astronomy tower. Realising where his feet were taking him, he became more convinced that that was exactly where he should go. He could confront at least one of those pesky memories right there and then. But when he got there, he was not the only one.
Harry was glad it was dark so Malfoy couldn’t see how much he was blushing. He rubbed his sweating palms on his boxers before crawling under his own bed sheets.
“Still,” he said, looking up first at Harry with his heart in his eyes, then to Hermione. “I’m not saying that anything I did is forgivable. What I am saying is that I am sorry. For all of it. If I could go back with a Time Turner and change it all, I would.”
For several minutes, they sat next to each other in silence, Harry staring at the fireplace after Hermione and Draco at his blank wrist. Then Draco pushed himself to his feet and strode out of the kitchen into the back garden. He stood on the stone walkway, overgrown with grass and moss, and tilted his head back, staring at the clouds gathering dark and heavy above him, his hands shoved into his pockets. He took one deep breath, then another. The air was icy cold, and he could practically taste the rain on his tongue. He closed his eyes. Breathed.
He had only wanted his wand back. In the middle of the Battle was perhaps not the best time to confront Potter about it, but he had been desperate, and maybe what he really wanted was to see him again, to make sure he was safe. Instead, he put him in danger, and Potter had to save him from all-consuming flames.
“Ah, what a shame,” said Ron with a smile that said he wasn’t sorry at all. “Next time, then.”
“Oh, I do,” Harry interrupted him, moving to place one finger against Draco’s lips to quiet him. Draco pressed his lips back against Harry’s finger, and Harry groaned in frustration, wanting so much to let Draco suck his finger into his mouth, to do dirty things with it – no, focus. He moved his hand away to cup Draco’s face instead, cradling his jaw. “Let’s take this slow, okay? For both of our sakes.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, his green eyes warm and earnest. “I shouldn’t have done it, should have known better than to cast a spell without knowing the damage it could do. Darling, I am so, so sorry. But these scars don’t scare me, I can promise you that.”
. He sighed and sat down on the ground, pulling his knees into his chest as he watched the cup piece itself back together. Pansy, the shock slowly leaving her system, uncurled herself and leaned forward.
Harry hummed. “I’ll be sure to make it as riveting as possible,” he assured him. “Although, there is one loose end that’s been bugging me. I’ll have to question you further, I’m afraid.”
Draco went completely scarlet. Then, his eyes shot open and he dropped his hands.
“Hello Draco,” Hermione said with a polite nod of her own. “This is our daughter, Rose.”
“I’m sorry,” he said in that same low, barely audible tone. “For everything I did when we were kids, for my family, for everything.”
Draco looked up at him, his eyes red-rimmed and puffy from crying. “I kissed you.” It wasn’t a question, just a simple barely audible affirmation. Harry gave him a small smile.
Draco pursed his lips and nodded. It had been a week since that day in Harry’s kitchen, a week of processing and tip-toing around while their new reality sank in. “Your mother wasn’t convinced,” he said conversationally. “Apparently your wife’s eyewitness testimony to the Soul Bond spell wasn’t enough, so we’ve been running the gambit of Mrs. Weasley’s practical tests.” He grimaced, remembering how only an hour earlier, Mrs. Weasley had locked him in the toilet while Harry hid somewhere in the house, the idea being that soulmates always find each other no matter what. It took three tries before Mrs. Weasley was satisfied that Draco wasn’t just getting lucky. “She’s currently testing the theory that we can feel each other’s pain.”
to know – fine, Draco, I waive my grievances towards you.” She drew something in the air and added, “I bless this relationship, as strange as it may be. Now, please, never tell me about your sex lives, ever.”
“And you just left a child on his own? Great parenting skills, Potter,” Draco sneered, but there was no malice in his voice. Harry chuckled and sipped his beer.
Malfoy smirked. “Pick your jaw up off the floor, Potter. You didn’t really think you were the only gay kid in the school, did you? It is an all-boys school, after all, although I think the all-girls schools have us beat in reputation alone.”
, distant? This whole week,
Harry leaned his chin in his hand, reconsidering his game plan. “I’m going to the Burrow on Christmas, but I’ll be staying here for the most part. I love the Weasleys, but Hermione and Ron are going to be all over each other, and Ginny… well, we’re friendly and all, but that’s one awkward conversation I don’t want to have with Mrs. Weasley. She’s still heartbroken that Ginny and I didn’t end up married, if I’m being honest.” He moved his rook closer to Draco’s queen. “It looks like it’ll just be the two of us with the whole eighth-year dorm to ourselves,” he added, raising one eyebrow as he looked suggestively over his glasses at Draco. Draco smirked.
Harry turned to him with a frown. “Why not?”
He led them down the path, eventually coming to the baffle gate and the path winding through the old trees to the small clearing in the woods. Now, in winter, the grass wasn’t as green, and the trees were barren. There was no yarrow and borage in the shadows. Embarrassment crept up the back of Draco’s neck as he noticed now the ivy pulling off the old stone walls, the dingy windows, the moss heavy on the roof tiles. But when he looked over at Harry, he saw the same expression of wonder that he’d had all those years ago, sweeping away the embarrassment.
“I like Tolkien,” he said. He forced the suitcase closed, then pulled a small hold-all out from under the bed and went to retrieve his toiletries. Harry shook his head. He didn’t know what made him do it, but he took all three books, shrunk them, and shoved them into his jean pockets, only to find that it made his jeans look suspiciously bulky. He frowned and tossed them into the hold-all instead. Maybe Malfoy wouldn’t notice.
Malfoy’s cheeks turned slightly pink. “Er, well, what with all the wards and the – my using the guest bedroom and all,” he stammered, gesturing vaguely. Harry, finally taking pity on him, came to stand beside Malfoy and said,
“You sure about that?” Draco asked, one eyebrow raised in challenge. Robards did not reply. He shot Draco a dirty look, then turned on his heel and stormed off towards his own table. All four of them watched him retreat like an enraged bull in black military dress, before letting out a collective sigh of relief.
He was seventeen, regretting the Mark on his arm as he watched his world burn.
When Malfoy heard this last bit, he turned to Harry and asked, “Should I be worried about ex-girlfriends trying to storm in here?”
“Nope!”
“Draco, we were eleven,” Harry said with a small, disbelieving laugh. Draco smiled a bit sheepishly and shrugged.
“She left me.”
Harry flushed, avoiding the onlooking stares from the nearby students and teachers. He could see that the red-headed boy’s ears had gone pink, even if his gaze was still fixed resolutely on the board. Draco was fuming. He had turned to face Harry, his grey eyes narrowed and his fists clenched in his lap. Harry leaned forward and buried his face with his hands, pushing his glasses up and out of the way. He swore under his breath. He could feel Draco’s glare burning a hole into his head. He sighed and lowered his hands.
“Holy shit,” he swore. “Was not expecting that.”
Draco nodded to himself. He fiddled with his left cuff. Bit his lip.
“How do you mean?”
“Potter.”
“You really are a ghost,” Harry breathed. “Or, whatever you are.”
Parkinson scoffed. “What’s gotten into you, Draco? Why are you defending this pouf? He’s just a f*****.”
Myrtle opened her mouth to object, but Malfoy cut her off. “It’s okay, Myrtle,” he said, his voice a choked whisper. Through Myrtle’s torso, Harry could just make out Malfoy lowering his wand, the slump of his shoulders. “I can handle this.”
“No you won’t,” she intoned in a sing-song voice. She turned the page with a smirk as Draco got to his feet, cursing under his breath. “If you’re going into the kitchen, could you make me a cup of tea? Thanks, babe.”
It was a silver hound. It trotted over to Harry, starry eyes blinking up at him. Kellen’s voice echoed in the room –
“If it doesn’t blow up.”
Red. Red. Harry looked around again, more slowly this time. “Armchair. Scarf. Erm, jumper. Rug. Curtains.”
It had been five years since the war. He had a job, a place to call his own just outside the city, a cat named Scorpius who brought him dead moths as trophies. Every so often a partner would try to open him up, take a look inside – relationships are about give and take, Draco, one had shouted at him, and you never give, Draco, never! Draco didn’t shed so much as a tear. He simply sipped his espresso as the other man stormed out of his life, never to be seen again.
Then he pushed it back over to Hermione with a pointed look. She read his note, her mouth dropping into an ‘oh’. She picked her quill up.
Later, Harry would regret not asking more about the argument between Malfoy and his parents. But in that moment, all he did was thank Wilkins for his time. Then he went back up, checked in with Kellen, and Floo’d back to the DMLE. After hours of pouring over the case file with Kellen, he was no closer to an answer. His only hope was that Narcissa would wake up from her coma and be able to tell Harry what happened.
“She was meeting me at St. Mungo’s so that we could go out for tea and just so happened to run into him – he was a Healer there – so, technically, she met him.”
“No,” he said. “No, it, er… I get it.”  He bit his lower lip, his upper lip scabbing where it had been split from the punch. His stomach twisted in his gut, tightening around his thrumming pulse deep in his abdomen. He breathed in deep through his nose. Draco watched him all the while, never taking his eyes off him. But Harry said nothing.
Draco blinked and leaned back, his hand dropping back to his side. Harry breathed again. Draco cleared his throat and turned away, returning to his unpacking.
“You punched me in the face in third year,” Draco said, pointing his finger at her. “I’m not saying I didn’t deserve it, but still.”
“Think he’s trying to set us up, Potter?” he asked, his old drawl coming back. Harry blushed.
“You got a date or something?” Dean asked as he laced up his boots, watching Harry, who had finally settled on a green wool jumper with black jeans, try to manage his hair. Harry blushed and mumbled, “something like that,” before giving up on his hair. Dean grinned knowingly.
“Someone was trying to frame Malfoy and take out Ivanovich at the same time,” Harry finished with a nod. “Yes, sir, I think that’s exactly what’s happening here.”
Harry forced an understanding smile. “Yeah, of course. Listen, I have something I need to tell you two.”
Harry sat up, Draco’s hand falling away from his chest as he cradled Draco’s jaw. Without a word, he leaned in and kissed him sweetly, deeply. They moved slow, everything that could not be said pouring into each touch, each breath shared. Later, as they lay tangled on the floor, rocking against each other, steady like the tide, glorifying in the slide of skin against skin, Draco realised in a moment of pleasure that nothing came more naturally to him than loving Harry Potter. And that was quite alright by him.
“Mmm?”
“I can never be mad at you, dear,” she said, giving his cheek a pat. “As long as you’re happy, I’m happy. But,” she pointed a finger in his face with a stern look, “if he hurts you, I am not afraid to give him the same treatment I gave his aunt.”
“Harry?”
Draco leaned back against Harry and gestured at Teddy. “Teddy wants to talk to us about something,” he said. “Go ahead, Ted, it’s okay.”
“No offense, Harry, but how can you be sure?” she asked. “This is Draco Malfoy, after all. You were convinced he was a Death Eater when he was sixteen!”
Harry buried his face in his hands. Draco laughed, the sound like the merry crackling of the fire.
Malfoy still didn’t look at him. He pressed his knuckle down into the wood, biting down hard on his lip. Harry was quiet for a moment, then asked, “Why didn’t you say anything? At the Manor. You knew it was me – even with a Stinging Hex, you would have known because Hermione and Ron were with me.”
“I’m sorry, Ron,” Harry said. “When this is over, if there’s anything I can do….”
“For your information, I’ve been on the straight and narrow for the past five years, thank you very much.” He rolled his head back to frown at the opposite wall, shifting in his restraints as he tried to sulk and had to resort to a simple pout. Harry narrowed his eyes at him.
“Well, he apparently doesn’t hate me,” Harry pointed out. He looked up at Draco over the rim of his glasses, his green eyes sparkling with laughter. “Although I have to admit, I’m more of a dog person, usually.”
Harry shook his head. He shared a look with his reflection in the mirror. His reflection rolled its eyes. Draco had been getting ready for about an hour, and at this rate they would be late for breakfast with his mother at Malfoy Manor. Not that Harry was particularly looking forward to it. He and Narcissa had a better understanding than he had had with Draco’s late father, but that was all up in the air now. Harry, who was wearing black jeans and a maroon button down, was uncomfortable enough already. Christmas was for lounging around in Mrs. Weasley’s jumpers and pyjama bottoms, not formal wear. But Draco had insisted.
“Fantastic. I just… I have to go do something. I’ll see you back in the common room, yeah?” He shrugged them off as best as he could. With a wave, he made his way off the pitch, taking only a moment to put away his broom and shove his change of clothes into his book bag.
“Come on, Teddy,” he mumbled, wrapping an arm around his godson’s shoulders, “let’s get out of the line of fire.”
“It’s a map,” Potter explained. And indeed, there was Hogwarts unfolding on the parchment, complete with individual names floating through it, a little Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter standing in the Astronomy Tower. “My dad and his mates made it when they were in school,” Potter continued. He tapped the parchment with his wand and murmured, “Mischief managed,” and the ink sank back into the parchment, leaving it smooth and blank.
“Damn,” Draco whispered. He took Harry’s thick cock in his hand and began to stroke it, long and firm. Harry’s mewls were muffled by his hand over his mouth. But when Draco licked a stripe along the underside of his cock, his moan could not be contained. He dropped his hand and let the sounds come unchecked as Draco took him little by little in his mouth. He tangled his fingers in Draco’s hair as he began to bob up and down Harry’s length.
Again, Wilkins shook his head, but there was a thought growing in his wide eyes. “You don’t think, sir-? No, young master could never, he loved master and mistress!”
“And what are you?”
“It’s just this one memory! How is it any different than people reading your statement?”
“I’ll take that.”
“Yeah, well. We both made mistakes.”
“I know,” he replied, before closing the door behind him.
Then, Hermione and Neville announced that they were hosting a party that Saturday in the common room.
to hide the sobs threatening to tear their way out of his chest. He cursed at himself. He brought his knees into his chest as he sat there, burying his face against them as he wept. Of course, Granger was right. Harry couldn’t possibly, shouldn’t want him, of all people. He scratched at his Mark beneath his shirt sleeve, digging into the skin as much as he could. Finally, fed up, he unbuttoned his cuff to push the sleeve up, to expose the ugly black tattoo writhing beneath the pale skin of his forearm. He sobbed as his nails scrabbled at it, tearing, scratching, desperate. He wanted it gone, wanted to pull it out of him, to erase all that it meant and all the memories that swirled amongst the ink. He reached for his wand, intending to cut, to tear, to burn it out if that was what it took.
“Draco, what did you tell her?” he asked, putting his hands on his hips. Draco bit his lip.
“So you admit this is a dangerous situation?” Harry countered, staying firmly on the path. Draco huffed.
“You really think your team is going to protect you, f*****? I bet none of them want to share a locker room with a pouf like you,” Parkinson sneered. Draco, fists clenched, took a step forward, but Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him back.
“Now, how do you like your sandwiches cut, horizontal or diagonal?”
“Justice,” Malfoy sneered, but it was half-hearted. His shoulders slumped as he wrapped his hands around his cup. “I don’t care about justice,” he mumbled, half to himself.
Draco shook his head with a grin as he made his way out of the Great Hall. He didn’t get far before he was waylaid by a gaggle of Slytherin girls, all of whom wanting to know if Draco was going with anyone to Hogsmeade that weekend. Harry noticed confused panic flash across Draco’s pale face before he slipped back into his polite and neutral mask. He glanced over at Harry over the girls’ heads with a pleading look. Harry took a bite of toast, smirking. Draco scowled at him before turning back to the girls. Harry chuckled.
When the room finally quieted down, only then did Draco look away, back towards the judge, who again asked him to refrain from addressing the defendant.
“Oh,” he breathed. Harry rolled back on his heels, biting his lip as he nodded.
Harry scowled at him. “Same here,” he said in a monotone. He squinted at Malfoy’s face, backlit by the window, trying to make out the other boy’s expression. Malfoy remained inscrutable. Harry looked away with a sigh and ran his hand through his wild black curls as he took in the rest of the room. It was the standard room they had been living in since the first year – two single beds, two closets, two pine wood desks and desk chairs, two bookcases, two nightstands. The only luxury was the ensuite toilet, something only students in their last year were given.
“That’s not – Jesus, I just – ”
“Okay,” Harry murmured. “That’s okay. Shirt stays on, I got it.”
Draco let out a long, audible sigh and planted his hands flat on the table, his head hung low. Potter passed a hand over his face and shook his head.
“I know my son,” Narcissa replied with a smirk. “In any case, there are lives at stake. Draco knows this. He wants to be a good king, a good ruler, and – well, suffice it to say, Lucius would never have asked an Ænglian necromancer to help him, no matter their accolades.”
“I care about you, too,” Draco whispered as his hand cradled Harry’s jaw. Harry’s heart leapt. It must have shown, because Draco smiled tenderly at him, his thumb brushing his cheek. The smile faltered, though, as Draco added, “But once the Cabinet is finished and the plan is carried out, we may never see each other again.”
Draco sighed. “I don’t know,” he said, his voice vulnerable and soft. “I never thought that far ahead, if I’m honest.”
King Draco cocked his head, his smile twisting into a confused frown. “Not at all,” he said, “my people have a great respect for those who walk in Hel and speak with Death. It is no mean feat. I would know.” He smirked, settling back into his throne.
Harry nodded – yes, of course, he wanted this… right? Sure, his movements were mechanical, and every second he was thinking through his next touch, what he was supposed to be doing to make Draco feel good, but that was normal, right? The ease with which he saw other people kiss and hold each other, the passion he saw on the telly, that just came with practice, right? It’s not like everyone just innately knew what to do, right? Right? Realisation dawned horribly in his chest as the nausea threatened to claw up his throat. Draco’s cheeks grew pale watching Harry.
Harry, who had initially stepped back in surprise, now moved forward, pressing into Draco’s personal space, his eyes dark as he looked up into his face. “Have you?” he demanded, his voice rough.
Draco nodded. “Absolutely.”
Wilkins trembled. His gloves squeaked as he wrung his hands. “Well, sir,” he said, voice shrill, “master and mistress have not had it easy since the war. Poor mistress, all those years without master, and neither went out, as they once did. Perhaps those who supported you against You-Know-Who would want to hurt them, but it’s been years, sir, and they’ve been so good to Wilkins. No, Wilkins can’t think of anyone, sir.”
me about it much longer.”
“How do any of us know?” he shot back. “Andromeda, he’s good to me. We’ve been dating two months now, and not once has he tried to hurt me – intentionally, anyway, he did accidentally knock me over when he got startled by a spider the other day. It was very funny.” Harry sighed when Andromeda’s frown only darkened. His shoulders slumped as he shook his head at her. “What can I do to prove to you that he isn’t what you think he is?” he asked wearily.
Surprised, Draco and Harry looked at their shirts then at each other. Draco had blanched, but a slow grin spread across Harry’s face. Draco, as if reading Harry’s mind, widened his eyes and shook his head minutely. Harry waggled his eyebrows in a challenge.
“– are you doing here? I haven’t seen you in years!” The reflected light from the fountain sparkled in Harry’s glasses as he pushed them up his slightly crooked nose. He looked Draco up and down slowly, a hungry gleam in his eye, as if he had been starving before he saw Draco. Draco chastised himself. He was being dramatic, ridiculous. Harry must have noticed something. His smile fell, and he put his hand on Draco’s arm in concern. His touch burned straight through Draco’s skin like an open flame. “Draco?” he asked, the name like honey on his lips. “Is everything alright?”
Ron looked ready to kill him when Draco stepped into their living room, ash still on his shoulders from the fireplace.
“I know,” Harry said, his voice soft and sympathetic. “So do I.”
“Oh, yeah. Actually, he was over this weekend. And, er, he met the guy I’m dating,” he said quickly. Ron’s jaw dropped.
Harry shook his head minutely. When Draco’s lips met his, Harry could feel his smile.
“No, we understand,” said Hermione. Both of their faces had grown pale and serious, snapping to attention immediately. “We’ll keep the channel open and send Kellen through as soon as possible. Is there anything we can do to help?”
,” Draco moaned. They both froze for a moment as the words hung in the air. But before Draco could take it back, Harry began to bob up and down in earnest. Draco came with a sob within seconds.
“Three years,” Malfoy murmured. He looked at the plastic chip with his lips curled into a proud smirk, his long lashes casting pale shadows on his high cheekbones. Harry’s chest grew tight, his breath catching as he looked at Malfoy in this clear light. “I’ve come too far,” Malfoy continued in that low murmur, as if he didn’t care if Harry heard, as if his words were only for him, “to fall back now. I promise you that.”
Their first kiss was sloppy, forceful, with too much teeth. But slowly, it grew tender as they explored what the other liked. Draco’s hands buried themselves in Harry’s thick black curls, while Harry’s hands gripped his narrow hips, pulling him against him. Draco nipped at Harry’s bottom lip, making him gasp and moan as tongue followed teeth. Harry pulled Draco’s shirt out from his trousers so that he could run his hands up the bare skin of his back. Draco shivered against him. When he pulled away to kiss and suck love bites into Harry’s neck, he was rewarded not only with a throaty moan but with Harry’s hips grinding against him. They both gasped as they rutted up against each other, chasing friction. Harry’s shirt was gone, long ago tossed aside so that Draco could continue his trail of kisses down his chest, licking and sucking at each nipple in turn. Harry tried to unbutton Draco’s shirt, but he pulled away, shaking his head, something like fear in his lust-blown eyes.
Sirius led him into the wilderness, a fortnight’s journey from the bustling city Harry had known all his life, to a town by a wide, dark lake nestled in the foothills of great green mountains. A castle stood on an outcropping by the lake, its tall towers and glittering lights a beacon of hope to the weary travellers. Sirius pointed at it as they stood at the edge of the lake, staring across the water at the castle.
“You named your orchid?”
Harry caught Draco’s eye for the briefest of moments. He knew Draco had heard by the slight exasperated eye roll he gave Harry before focusing back on Hermione’s discussion on unstable potion ingredients. Harry passed his hand over his face with a sigh. “You forget that he’s been basically shunned out of wizarding society,” he pointed out, slouching in his seat as he crossed his ankle over his knee. “Tonight’s less like opening night and more like dropping him in a pot of boiling water.”
Teddy snorted. “This is… different. This is….” He licked his bitten lip. “So, I fancy boys and girls, right?” Harry and Draco nodded. Teddy swallowed, then continued, “Well, I think it’s because, sometimes, I feel like a boy
In the end, as they had all known, George was found guilty and sentenced to seven life sentences in Azkaban. Harry heard Ron sob a choked, “No!”, behind him. He bowed his head, biting down hard on his lip as the tears threatened to spill down his cheeks. He forced himself to look up as they led George away, but in that moment, George caught his eye. He struggled against the guards restraining him and roared at Harry, “Why are you protecting that bastard? You know what he’s done! They all have blood on their hands! Fred’s blood!”
Malfoy smirked. “One of us has to be,” he retorted. He stood up and picked up the dirty dishes from the table. “Although, I have to admit, you’ve given me two surprises already today.”
“Of course you do,” Draco snapped as he tried to step back, away from Harry. Harry only tightened his grip and followed him, even going so far as to step right into his personal space, toe to toe. Draco shut his eyes as he took a deep breath through his nose. “This won’t work, Harry,” he said in a cool monotone, like he was reading from some mental script. “Just leave it. It’s better this way.”
“You shouldn’t have wandered off,” she said. “What if you had fallen through a hole or something?”
Harry shrugged and set the carrot he had been peeling aside before starting on the next.
“Oi, are you going to order, or just stand there ogling each other?” the man behind Harry demanded.
“I cursed you,” Harry insisted.
“Harry, Hogwarts looked better after the Battle than this room does now.”
“Oh.” Malfoy looked down at his plate. “Right. That makes sense.”
Harry froze. “Oh.”
“Sorry, Mrs. Weasley.”
“See something you like?” he asked. Draco blinked and set the cups down.
“Why?” Harry pressed. Draco bit his lip. It was supposed to be one drink, say hello to a few school friends, and leave. He didn’t want to be having this conversation, not right now, not ever. He kicked at a rock, watched it scatter into the lapping waves.
George looked more like a shell than a man. His usually sparkling blue eyes were sunk deep into his skull, his stubble uneven and only emphasizing the shadows of his cheeks. His copper-bright hair was dull and heavy. The grey uniform hung off his lanky form, the chains around his bony wrists rattling as he moved. They sat him down in the dock, locking him into the chair. His empty eyes roamed the crowd, and when they found Harry and Draco, a dark fire burned in that once jovial face. Draco looked straight ahead, but Harry bowed his head, unable to meet that accusing fire.
“Why do you waste your time thinking about that boy, Draco?” Blaise asked, cocking his head to one side. Draco blinked.
“I don’t know,” he whispered. “I don’t know if I can go back to Hogwarts after… after everything.”
. Harry blinked, trying to take it all in. The very air smelled of jasmine, the flowering vines winding their way up the stone pillars, inching their way towards that impossible sky.
“Yes, gods, please,” Draco gasped.
Harry frowned as he raised his head. “It’s not even that late,” he protested. “You okay?”
“Why do you think I’m here?” He turned so that he too was facing Draco, but it was a long moment before he looked up and met Draco’s gaze. His expression was timid, uncertain, so unlike the confident Gryffindor that Draco inhaled sharply through his teeth. Harry fidgeted, shoving his hands in the pockets of his Quidditch robes as he tried to find the right words.
“I thought it would go away when he – ”
“You forget, Potter,” Draco pointed out, taking hold of Harry’s hands in his, “I’ve been here before.”
“When do you go back to Hogwarts?” he asked instead.
Draco sat at his makeshift desk by the window surrounded by an organised chaos of books, papers and quills. He looked over his shoulder, one eyebrow raised as Harry came in and shut the door behind him. Draco turned in his seat, the crease settling between his brows as he frowned. “What is it? Has something happened?” he asked, his voice tinged with concern. “Was there another attack? Are Granger and Weasley okay?”
That sent Harry over the edge. As he came pulsing deep inside Draco, Draco finally reached down and stroked his own cock, coming within seconds. Draco collapsed against Harry’s chest, covered in his own sticky mess, gasping for breath. Harry let out a somewhat hysterical giggle. Draco barely had enough energy to raise his head and stare at him.
Harry sighed. He looked down at his knees where his jeans had torn open when he fell. “It’s nothing,” he said, “Just my cousin and his friends.”
Harry shook his head, his eyes wild, his grip tightening, holding Draco close. “No,” he assured him, “no, I promise, I just want you. Only you. Please, just listen to me.”
“Or his other head, if you know what I mean,” Draco said under his breath. Harry snorted. Hermione ignored them and continued.
Harry cradled Draco’s jaw with one hand, wrapping his other arm around Draco’s waist. “You okay?” he asked in a hushed voice. “Be honest.”
One in particular, a golden-haired elf with black eyes like polished stones set into his carven face named Baron LeStrange, regularly carried out ‘purges’ of his land – human men were hung from gibbets at the border crossings of Starling, human women were raped and sold, bastard half-elven children were sent away or, more often than not, left to die in the woods at the borders. The road to Starling had come to be known as Dead Man’s Crossing, or, privately, the Bloody Road, and the Baron nicknamed the Bloody Baron. Harry himself was not allowed into Starling, even with his necromancer status, but often visited the bordering lands to shepherd ‘foundling’ children to Hogwarts, itself a sovereign nation inside Albion borders, and laid the restless spirits of the hanged men to rest. Harry met the Baron’s cold glare across the room and scowled.
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Harry murmured. “You’re here. You’re real.”
Harry blanched. “Please don’t kill my boyfriend,” he whispered. Charlie snorted behind him. Molly pressed her lips into a thin line and gave Harry’s cheek a final pat before returning to her cooking.
Robards scoffed, incredulous. “You can’t be serious,” he said. Hermione crossed her arms.
It was cautious at first, neither quite believing it was real. Slowly, it deepened as Draco buried his hands in Harry’s curls and Harry put one hand on the nape of Draco’s neck, the other against his low back, pulling him in. Tongues and teeth and panting, gasping breaths were all they knew. Hands against skin, pushed up under shirts, desperate for more. They explored friction, the taste of each other’s skin, the small intimate sounds the other made. It was everything at once, and Harry thought he’d drown in it.
“I’m not saying it again.”
He kissed and licked down Harry’s chest, sucking at one dark nipple, than the other. Harry writhed and moaned under him, one hand gripping the sheets, the other tangling in Draco’s hair. He pulled Draco up, mumbling for Draco to take his jumper off, “Now, I want to feel you, all of you.”
“Gross,” Draco mumbled against his lips. Harry grinned.
“Ron, he murdered five people…”
Draco finally smiled. They leaned their foreheads against each other, Draco’s hands coming up to tangle in Harry’s curls. They breathed shakily, holding each other like that for several long moments.
“God, I love you,” Harry sighed. They both froze as they simultaneously realised what he said. Draco pulled back to look at him. Harry swallowed. “Er, I mean…”
“Draco?”
“Correct. Based on the initial diagnostics in the file, it was
Andromeda wagged a finger at him, her eyes sparkling with mirth and tears. “I will hold you to that, Harry James Potter, don’t think I won’t!”
The kettle, always strangely prescient with its timing, began to whistle. Harry turned and began pouring the hot water into the tea pot, if only to hide his scarlet face once more. He swore over and over in his mind. Of course, of course Malfoy was gay. When Harry had been keeping tabs on Malfoy over the years, he had noticed the papers referring to Malfoy as a “confirmed bachelor,” a very outdated term but the wizarding world was always slow to catch up on these sorts of things. Harry took a deep breath, and turned back to Malfoy, teapot in hand. Malfoy looked, for lack of a better word, nervous.
“How?”
“You’re
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Yeah, you kind of do owe me one for that,” he admitted. “Listen, I kind of have to go. I’ll call again soon, I promise. We need to figure out Christmas Day plans and all that anyway. Give my love to Hermione.”
There he was: Potter, Harry. Right next to Malfoy, Draco.
They took dinner in a private dining room in the king’s quarters. “Father would be scandalised.” King Draco chuckled to himself, gesturing for Harry to take a seat opposite him. “If he was alive, he’d host a feast, or at least a proper formal dinner. As it is….” He trailed off and pressed two fingers against his lips, gaze focused on the corner of the table. Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair. But then the servants came with the meal, and the king shook himself from whatever reverie he had lost himself in. He smirked, more to himself than anything. “This is easier, yes?”
The old house stood in the middle of the valley, once elegant hedgerows overgrown into twisting gnarled creatures covered in cobwebs. The grass was tall, bristling with weeds. But it was summer, and the days were long. There was nothing to fear as long as the sun was up.
Draco smiled shakily. “Did you just call me ‘darling’?”
“It’s a haunted house, Ron, of course there are going to be spiders,” she said with exasperation. Ron stopped dead in his tracks while Hermione and the other boy, Harry, continued on. His face had gone white as a sheet.
“No,” Harry said, his voice muffled by his hands, “he told me.”
They sat across from each other at the long wooden table, a map spread out between them, the parchment crackling as the king swept his well-manicured fingers across the outline of his kingdom. Harry frowned as he listened to the king describe the attacks – reports of Elves going missing, especially children, bodies only occasionally reappearing, twisted and deformed. There was something odd about the map, Harry thought.
Harry flinched. It wasn’t exactly public knowledge that Harry fancied men and women, although there had been rumours in the
Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s waist so that they could walk more comfortably. “Alright then,” he said, “I guess I’ll keep you around then.”
The platform was quiet when Draco arrived. Not many families wanted to send their children back to Hogwarts, and some families had no children to send anymore. Those who were there parted for him like the tide. Some stared, some looked away. He understood. He was a leper, the Mark on his arm the ulcerous lesion. Still, he gritted his teeth and set his jaw as he passed. He was still a Malfoy after all.
“Hi, Tonks,” he said. He relaxed his shoulders and smiled at the young woman in the doorway. Her usually bright pink hair was dull and mousy, and dark shadows bruised the skin beneath her eyes. His smile faded. “Everything okay?”
“It better not. Now, since you’ve not done anything wrong, I want you to think of this as a friendly warning, nothing more, do you understand?” Harry nodded. “Good. As for the, er, subject of Weasley’s caterwauling….”
At which point Harry decided it was time to come to Draco’s rescue.
Potter didn’t go to bed until well past midnight. Draco listened to him get ready in their cramped en-suite as he pretended to sleep. Part of him voted to go and confront him, get the truth, once and for all. The rest of him said to wait, to bide his time. The moment would come soon enough.
Harry raised his eyebrows and pressed his lips together to supress a disbelieving grin. “Awfully sure of yourself. What makes you think I want to hang out with you?”
“Excuse me, but what do I have to apologise for?” interrupted Hermione.
“Thank you,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. Draco smiled back, small and tentative.
Draco sighed. “Just business,” he told the empty room. He reached out for his evening glass of wine and downed the rest of the dregs. He stood and walked over to the sink, placing his empty glass in the basin. He would wash it later. For now, he was tired and confused. Tomorrow, he would see Potter to discuss the case, and what will be, will be. With this Zen outlook, he started to get ready for bed.
Harry grumbled, but after a minute or two, he sighed and began to talk, his voice muffled against Draco’s neck.
Harry, who had folded his hands under his chin to better watch Draco as he told his story, closed his eyes for a moment. He tried to imagine Narcissa Malfoy – proud, regal matriarch that she was – scrubbing the floorboards and marble tiles of the Manor. He couldn’t. Instead, he remembered Voldemort, barefoot, stepping over the bloodied bodies, their eyes glazed as their lives seeped into the floor beneath them. He opened his eyes just in time to hear Draco continue,
. “It’s just a lot,” he said. “And I don’t know if…” …
“Scotland.”
“Maybe later,” Harry replied. Draco snorted with laughter. Harry smiled lazily. “And maybe then, you could call me
That had been almost ten years ago. Three years after, he had won the Stone of Remembrance from its previous host’s spirit in a game of chess. He had not sought it out, and in fact had no idea the spirit that had been haunting the old mountain had held the Stone in life. She had been cursed to remain in the limbo between life and Death so long as she possessed the Stone, she told Harry as she handed it to him. She placed a skeletal hand on his shoulder and looked him in the eye – white Hel-fire orbs piercing into green eyes flecked with gold.
“This – that can’t be true, this is some falsehood, this – this
“Your Mark. It’s gone.”
“You said you wanted to keep in better touch with your friends,” Draco explained.
“So of course they decided to disguise themselves as my ex-nemesis to charm their way into my bed?” Harry smirked when Ron got flustered and spluttered at this. “Besides, I have wards up on Grimmauld Place against stuff like that, and he’s never triggered any of them. So I can assure you, he’s genuine.”
. I’m supposed to be protecting him, not bloody falling for him.” He groaned, his head falling onto his knees. “I’m so fucking screwed,” he groaned.
“Bonjour, Maman.”
“Exactly. So what are you going to do about it, genius?”
“This is nice,” Harry sighed. Draco nuzzled his nose into Harry’s curls.
Lucius pushed a small wooden box across the desk towards Draco before leaning back, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. Draco picked up the box, one eyebrow raised.
So, one Floo trip to Hogsmeade and one Apparation later, when Harry and Draco found themselves outside the gates to Malfoy Manor, Harry still wasn’t entirely convinced that he was not going to get cursed for dating Narcissa Malfoy’s son.
“Ron,” Harry warned, trying to keep his voice calm and level. “Your fight isn’t with him, it’s with me, alright?”
Blaise pursed his lips. The firelight reflected in his dark eyes like flakes of gold. Then he looked away, sitting back a little as he appeared to study a bit of lint on his trousers.
“Draco. Draco Malfoy.” He paused. Then he smiled at Harry, small and incredulous, as he whispered, “Gods, you look just like him.”
He thought of Snape, the older man’s black eyes boring into his as he pleaded with Draco to let him help. He thought of how he had pushed his professor away, fear and suspicion in the guise of pride and arrogant confidence. He thought of his friends, the concern in their eyes as they tried to get him to come to Hogsmeade with them, to talk to them, to be with them. He thought of Dumbledore, gone for long stretches of time, his piercing blue gaze seeing straight through him.
“Prat.” Draco raised his head to glare blearily at Harry, who grinned back. “Why do I even like you?” he mumbled. Harry tucked a wavy lock of white-blond hair behind Draco’s ear.
“How… how can I know you’re telling the truth?”
“Well, to be fair, I never asked for the tea,” Malfoy pointed out. Harry blushed. “Not that I would ever say no to tea. And I wouldn’t say we are rivals anymore, are we? Rivals would talk to each other more than once every ten years.”
“Give it time,” he said in an undertone, nudging Harry in the ribs. “I’m sure we’ll all get used to having him around soon enough.”
Draco exhaled sharply through his nose, an almost laugh. In his mind, he was fourteen, listening to Blaise tell him a story, the image of two olive-skinned boys running through a dark forest, away from their past and their future.
“I’ve never read them. Tell me about them.”
He told Harry everything that day. It took several hours – the sun had set and the evening chill set in by the time Draco finished. All the while, Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that he had heard the story before, the feeling that his world had tilted slightly off its axis and slid into another universe all its own, that Draco’s words were coming to him from the bottom of a deep pool.
“Four and four, yeah?” said Neville, looking around at their little rag-tag group. He, Harry and Dean were the only Gryffindors returning. Zacharias Smith, much to Harry’s dismay, had returned along with Ernie Macmillan and two Ravenclaw boys, Terry Boot and Kevin Entwhistle. “We could draw straws, or…”
“Do you want to talk about it?” he asked carefully. Draco frowned.
“And he’s changed!” Harry snapped.
The wall came down the next day.
He couldn’t remember the exact day, the exact moment, when he and Potter became friends.
“Right, okay. I’ll tell Robards, he’ll probably want to visit and go over the plan with you both, and Mr. Malfoy, I imagine you’ll want to go by your flat and retrieve some clothes. We have a team there now guarding the flat and we can notify them that you will be coming so they can lift the wards on your Floo.” She nodded to herself and stood up, shrugging on her robes and picking up her things. “Right. I’ll go get Robards.”
Draco made sure Harry saw him approaching before he put his hand on his shoulder, giving it a small squeeze. He must have seen something in Harry’s expression, because his eyes narrowed. He glanced between him and Ron as he stood just behind Harry, his arm around his shoulders. Harry put his hand over Draco’s, staring pointedly at Ron as he turned his head and brushed his lips against Draco’s pale knuckles. Ron scoffed and looked away.
Draco nodded, even as his breath shook. “I do,” he whispered, “Gods, I really do. But how?”
“Victims are middle-aged white male wizard, Lucius Malfoy, and middle-aged white female witch, Narcissa Malfoy. Attack is believed to have occurred between 9:30am and 10:00am this morning, after they sat down for breakfast and before the house elf came in to check on them.”
“What do you mean?” Potter asked, crossing his arms over his annoyingly broad chest. Auror training had only highlighted his already rugged features with defined muscles and a lean frame, leaving Draco to wonder if the universe was ever going to hurry up and get to the punch line of this cosmic joke. Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco strode over to him with a beaming smile. “That’s great!” he said, his outstretched hand wavering over Harry’s upper arm. But if Hallowe’en was when Draco was the most solid, Beltane was when he was the most incorporeal. His hand fell back to his side, the smile no longer reaching his eyes. “Which one did you get into, Edinburgh or London?”
