“At the Manor” Harry clarified.
“Which reminds me” she said suddenly and animatedly while turning to the white-blond “you look great Draco! I’m glad you put on some weight, you looked almost transparent last time I saw you...”
Ron suddenly rose up on his feet and left the room without a glace back. Harry sighed. He would have taken the shouting over the silent treatment. Hermione looked at him with a mixture of doubt and compassion.
Eveleen disappeared in a second and when she came back, she was about to deliver what was probably a very well brewed excuse but Harry snapped before it even escaped her mouth.
“How positively chivalrous of you” scoffed Lucius “I take it Draco’s charms were successful? I must say I didn’t take you for a sodomite”
“Well, I’m not an acclaimed chef or anything but, I do know a thing or two” A faint flush had crept on his pale cheeks and Harry felt wildly amused by his obvious embarrassment.
When they finally part, Draco looks confused and aroused at the same time.
When he goes back to his face, he finds blue eyes looking at him intently. They still have the almond shape he inherited from his mother and the thought comforts him. His nose is straight but shorter, his cheekbones don’t stand out as much and his chin and jaws are sharp but not as square and chiselled than they used to.
Narcissa had been hard to convince and Lucius finally had to remind her very unpleasantly who was in charge and what was up for discussion in their family. Draco’s shameful past lack of judgement and misguided ways had to be put to an end but that wouldn’t be a problem. Or so he thought. Until he ran away with the Potter boy. Potter, of all people!
“Right.”
“No! What if it’s a trap? You’re gonna get yourself killed and that’s it!”
“How about this time, I ride your cock?” says Draco sultrily and he’ll be damned but Harry is blushing. Quite violently he might add.
“Yeah, exactly!” answered Harry, laughing in his Firewhisky at Ron’s proud grin. He was so happy for his friend he felt like a bubble about to explode with pride. Ron deserved it, he meant it. It was about time he shone a bit and showed everyone what he was capable of.
“Oh yes, she always brings me dead things, I think it’s her way to socialize” she said very matter-of-factly. “Anyway I saw him chatting her up and since I felt bad about letting him all alone in the house after moving back to mine-”
“Nah. Too much attention. I always
“Everything alright in there?” he asked neutrally.
Draco bit his shoulder hard enough to draw blood and Harry groaned, his wounded right hand clutching Draco’s hip in a bruising grip.
“Where the hell are those bloody robes” growled Harry. He had been searching for the damn thing for half an hour now and Draco could feel his frustrated aura all around the house, adding to his own bitterness and worry. He was such a sloppy sod sometimes!
“Tsk, tsk, how very naughty”
“Fuck yeah…” Harry managed to answer.
“Tried what?”
“Maybe I was in his House and realized he was a git?”
“You were saying?”
“Yes, a few bruises and burns, a couple of nasty hexes but nothing bad” answered Hermione.
“You see, he’s a really gifted Wizard and his knowledge on old magic is quite unmatched, Alarbus –Alarbus Cargrave, one of my colleagues, I think I mentioned him before, he’s a world expert on energy-based engineering spells- anyway, he said he had never seen someone so young and well-versed in creative magic and reversal techniques. He’s also very intuitive with designing spells so I thought-”
“Harry. Listen…” he swallows hard “the thing is, I won’t have to get there because I…”
“Indeed, thank you for that” exclaimed Draco bitterly through clenched teeth.
“Call me Ivy” she said with a mirthful smile “I currently have pieces of your skin and a fair amount of your blood on my face, hands and hair, I believe we can use our first names now.”
Harry turned around and searched Draco’s eyes.
Harry lost himself in the fray like he had countless times before. The young Auror jumped, dodged and cast, as sharp and quick as lightning bolt, his snake-like reflexes making up for his brazen and daring moves.
The Gryffindor doesn’t answer but fall on his knees and promptly takes Draco’s throbbing cock in the hot wetness of his mouth and hums delightedly.
“Well we wanted to talk to you without raising your suspicions...”
No smell other than burnt toast was coming from the kitchen and no cup of tea or unfinished crossword was sitting on the workbench. He stepped in the living room and the sight of the red-golden snake coiled in the old armchair where Draco would curl up and read late in the night wrenched his guts.
Malfoy was gaping and it was a sight to behold.
“Come on, mate, you look like someone kicked your Crup” Ron says with an encouraging wobbly smile.
He can’t seem to find him anywhere else in the ministry even after he pulled a few strings to get his calendar. Sometimes, being the Chosen One does have its perks but Harry feels dirty and he’s getting desperate. Lurking around the places Draco’s supposed to meet colleagues has lead to nothing.
“No, Harry I’m sorry I have no idea…” she paused “How did he run away, I thought you had put special wards on Grimmault?”
When the song was over and the cake on the table, Draco blew the candles under the crowd’s loud demands and everyone erupted in loud claps and cheers. Harry clapped on Draco’s back and his strong hand lingered a few seconds more before going away.
Then Harry moved, his hips pumping harder and the blond shuddered.
When everyone stood at the ready, Harry, Hermione, Luna, Neville and the freckled Auror set to work. In a collective and considerable effort, they took down the wards, beads of sweat sticking to their foreheads.
(See the end of the chapter for
That morning, when the Boy Who Lived stormed in the Ministry, covered in blood and with a glare so furious and spine chilling it could’ve put a Basilisk’s to shame, every employee and visitor fled out of his way without a word, fearing for their lives. Of course, the flocks of terrified employees immediately regrouped in his wake to chatter animatedly about what was the Chosen One so mad about and whose head would end up on a spike in the Atrium.
Malfoy removed his glasses in a gesture so intimate, Harry swallowed loudly, unable to move. Then the pale blond studied his face and raised trembling fingers to his cheekbone, brushing the skin, his jaw, his lips.
Harry’s right hand flew to the other boy’s cock and it throbbed. Precome had started to trickle down the shaft, lubricating his back and forth motions. He felt the pale blond tense and relax, the pale body vibrating with want. Harry nearly fainted when he realized what Malfoy’s other hand was up to. They were still linked by their brushing lips, the puffs of their panting breaths ghosting on their lips with strangled muffled sounds of pleasure.
Harry righted himself and engulfed Draco’s cock in a pliant hot wetness that made him loose all sense of reality.
Draco retreated in his room, dozens of questions furiously buzzing in his head.
A little while later, Harry was walking briskly in the streets, oblivious to the fragrant heat of this mid-July evening, a seeping black tide swarming him and saturating every atom with bitterness like an oil spill. Pretending he was tired, he had quickly said his goodbyes under the helpless stare of Hermione but he couldn’t afford to care about that right now.
“Listen!” “We don’t have much time. You need to get away from your father! He won’t forgive you this time, no matter what he tells you, don’t believe him, you hear me?”
Harry opened and closed his mouth several time, undecided on how to respond to that, then decided to ignore her and got back to his tea making with a childish sulk. Draco laughed frankly at his dismay. You had to love Luna.
“Usually, you don’t complain about my dirty one-tracked mind, as I recall”
“Um, Luna could you excuse us for a moment?” she didn’t answer or look up, too occupied by the reptile. Harry took the blond’s wrist and guided him to the living room.
“Waow. I don’t even know what to say” says Harry, shell-shocked.
“She is, but barely”
The Auror looked around him and took in the room packed with his noisy friends. He felt at home.
He should call Granger, she’ll know what to do with her mental case of a friend and Draco doesn’t see himself carrying Potter to St Mungo’s alone. He’s too heavy for one and Draco knows how powerful and erratic his magic is – he pushes down the thrill of desire that snakes through him at the memory of his wandless magic, it’s not the time for Christ’s sake!- and he will certainly abstain from getting himself on the receiving end of a magical rendition of the bombing of Nagasaki, thank you very much.
“Draco Malfoy… evaded his home a few months ago for fear for his life and well-being after repeated acts of torture and intimidation. He has been hiding for weeks from his father and disappeared this morning without a trace after meeting with his mother, Narcissa, who sent him a plea for help”.
“I’ll try, Hermione. I promise I’ll try.”
Ginny looked at him and her eyes widened then sparkled with mirth as she hid her smirk in her drink and resumed her chat with Blaise.
“That’s not true.” finally said Harry.
“Good morning sunshine” said Harry tentatively when the Slytherin entered the room, studying his face. He was sitting at the table of a dark underground kitchen with high magical windows, a smoking teapot in front of him accompanied by two teacups and a pot of sugar.
A few days later, the young men were having breakfast in the backyard and, playfully arguing about the worst teacher they had ever met at Hogwarts. Harry was leaning towards Quirrell and Draco was adamant it was Lockhart.
Draco starts prepping himself discreetly, conjuring up lube on his fingers and easing them in one by one. He makes a shamefully quick work of it, all the while continuing his ministrations on Harry’s cock but slower; he wouldn’t want him to come too quickly. It’s a good thing they had sex not so long ago or they wouldn’t last a minute at this rate.
Then Draco’s pure features twist into a dark mask of violent rage.
Harry winced at the name and looked at the Slytherin critically.
“No, Catesby” she explained “Last time, when Ron and Harry went to him to set up an intervention to get you out of there and he said no, it already was a close call. Ron told me he had never seen Harry that angry before. Which is a lot coming from Ron, believe me”
Draco hadn’t even spoken the words out loud but a silvery form appeared in front of him, basking the room in an opalescent light. The form shaped itself more precisely by the minute and a moment later, a silver wolf was watching him intently. Draco couldn’t detach his eyes from the magical being, his lips stretched out in euphoria and silver eyes wide with wonder.
The Gryffindor had relished in those stolen kisses and clandestine touches. But then Harry understood that like Ginny, it was the Boy Who Lived that Adrian wanted and Harry hadn’t been able to go on. He had felt like he was living a lie, borrowing someone else’s life. That was when he had given up on dating, thinking maybe it wasn’t for him. Maybe he was destined to stay alone.
Hermione came back with a new drink, her smile was so bright and she looked so happy that he felt like his insides had melted a little bit. Maybe not drunk but a tipsy sappy mess for sure…
She looked at her son then at the heir of the Báthory clan in a silent question. He shook his head in denegation and she relaxed. With a flex of his wrist, Narcissa’s hands untied.
” answered the snake, unconcerned by Harry’s squirming. The dark-haired man watched the snake closely, admiring his deep crimson colour and his golden eyes, petting his jaws.
“Mother, no!”
Harry swayed a little and Draco feared he would collapse in the tub. He grabbed his right shoulder to steady him a bit.
“Believe me, there’s a lot I want from you, but that’s not why I’m here. I just owed you the truth”
In the end they’d agreed to work together on the new line of strategical artefacts every Wednesday and Friday afternoon and Harry is astonished to realize that he’s actually not dreading the prospect that much. It is interesting work.
“Make that Firewhisky” says Harry faintly when his jaw has stopped falling on the ground “And bring the bottle!” he exclaims on second thought. If his best mate starts finding him hot, Harry thinks he’s at least entitled to a serious crapulence.
“Sir, I interviewed Draco Malfoy myself and saw the marks on his body”
“No, Harry, he didn’t. What happened? Is something wrong?”
Harry and Ron were discussing strategies for the Department’s newest case involving worrying disappearances when Southwell, an Auror in her thirties with short and spiky black hair passed her head at the door.
“And don’t get me wrong, in a very selfish way, I’m glad you did. But it doesn’t feel fair.” Added the pale blond, lost in his thoughts.
Only one word had been hastily scratched on it, in the elegant and neat handwriting: ‘
They remained silent for a moment and both men became extremely aware of how close they were. Draco’s stare was stubbornly trained on his task, allowing Harry to watch him at leisure. He never saw the Slytherin that closely before… and not half-naked. In a blood-loss induced haze, Harry studied the nervous lines of Draco’s body, all in sharp edges and angles. His pale skin was almost glowing under the magic lights of the room, like a polished marble statue. He had narrow hips and relatively wide shoulders, his lean build underlined by a lithe musculature. Under the sleek white hair, his slate-grey irises were circled by a line of a darker shade of grey and reminded Harry of those of a feline. They were fixated on what he was doing, his white-blond brows furrowed by concentration. Harry noticed the shadows under his eyes, he wasn’t surprised considering Draco’s current predicament. The green eyes then strayed on the soft and full lips, stretched in a thin line. Harry shook himself mentally. What was he doing? His brains were proper fucked up after the long night, that was for sure.
It was whispered that Minister Shacklebot himself had gone down to level two in order to find out what had happened that morning in the offices of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and had found a crazed Belarius Catesby holed up under his secretary’s desk, bellowing that Potter had to be executed immediately.
He licks a long strip of flesh from the base of the shaft to the tip, letting the bitter tangy-musky taste rolling on his tongue. Harry sighs in pleasure and Draco dips his head lower. When his tongue finds the sensitive patch of skin, Harry shouts in surprise. Draco licks it again, teasing the ring of muscles and the wrinkled skin.
Draco looks at him and the grey eyes lock his with such intensity that Harry is seized by the irrational fear that Draco can see past the disguise.
“Are you fucked in the head? I would love to work for you and it wouldn’t feel weird at all, you stupid bastard! You were born to do this! You’re the planner, the strategist, the chess-player. I’m more of a…” Harry trailed off, struggling for words.
Hermione has helped him sort out the clothe issue. She lent him a few of her clothes and helped him transfigure his own so he is now the distraught owner of several panties and bras. Hermione probably took pity on him though, she only gave him the simple kind: plain, black, practical cotton things. Harry doesn’t think he could have handled lacy-sexy lingerie without running screaming. A fact that Hermione has seemed to be thankfully very aware of. Since he is supposed to be —sigh— a junior Auror again, he can’t wear torn old jeans and tatty faded t-shirts under his Auror robes; which Hermione has diplomatically referred to as his ‘usual choice of clothing’. She has tried her best to transfigure the few suits and work clothes he has and provided several things of her own without so much as a mention of the forbidden words ‘dress’, ‘skirt’ or worst of all, ‘tights’.
“Yes, sure Harry, why don’t you come over and have dinner with us someday?”
“No, don’t say anything” he tightens his arms around the blond “I know those things cannot be rushed and with what I did…” his voice cracks a little “I know it’ll take time for you to get there, if you were to I mean, I don’t want to presume anyt-”
Luna recognized Draco’s phone with a disappointed jolt in her stomach. She approached Harry and enclosed him in a tentative embrace, caressing his back soothingly. Luna could feel his tension, as if his body was about to snap.
At his name so wantonly invoked by the pale, full lips, Harry emptied himself in the clenching tightness around him, a strangled cry stuck in his throat. He buried his face in the damp platinum strands and wrapped his arms around the lithe body tightly, overcome by a raw emotion he couldn’t quite place.
“Well, Harry here was convinced you were the actual heir of Slytherin and he was trying to get a confession” slurred Ron, cackling.
“Trying to live vicariously through me, are you?”
“And STOP hissing behind my back, you rude primitive freaks!” shouted an indignant muffled voice coming from the bathroom.
“Good, your ribs are okay, then.” He then proceeded to bandage the wound as efficiently as possible.
“What the hell are you doing here??” managed to answer Draco.
With a dramatical sigh, Malfoy swayed a bit and his shoulder pressed against Harry, warm and firm. The sensation both comforted him and made him feel restless. The Slytherin rested his head on the wall, baring the pale column of his neck and a wide expanse of smooth ivory skin.
Drunk, again, he decided to Floo home when he realized he saw more than one wand in his hand. In a blur of nauseating green flames and ashes that made him cough and spin his head, he stumbled in the living room and managed not to collapse on the ground. That in itself was a victory and he smiled, very proud of himself.
“Draco…” Harry warned “Drac- Ooh God” he sobbed as the pale blond swallowed his release.
But when the rumour that Harry Potter had quit after tearing up a new one at the Head of the Auror Bureau and blowing up his office reached the masses, no one could quite believe it. Still, they had felt the violent surge of magic that had lashed through the whole building like the aftershock of a magical Tsunami and tingled on their skin for minutes afterward. The boy wasn’t to be trifled with, that was for sure, and if anyone had forgotten that then his little show had put it at the forefront of anyone present.
“Mmmmh… and good morning to you too” said Draco seductively with a rough voice that made Harry’s blood boil. He rolled his hips tantalizingly, grinding his arse against Harry’s eager cock with obvious delight, eliciting a hopeless, desperate moan from the Gryffindor who was by then already unable to form coherent sentences. Draco flexed his hips deftly and slipped Harry’s cock between his legs, he resumed his rocking motions, the long shaft rubbing the puckered entrance, the stretch of sensitive flesh between the cheeks and the soft round shapes at the end.
“That’s hardly true. You could have played Quidditch for England if you’d wanted” said Draco wistfully, his eyes lost in the magical windows.
He didn’t wait for an answer and Disapparated home.
” falsely threatened Draco.
Harry laughed wholeheartedly and nodded his assent.
“Mother” he answered in the same language.
Harry laughed and embraced her familiarly. He scratched the snake’s chin affectionately and the scaled beast closed its eyes lazily.
“Bloody hell Potter, just take the damn bottle, I’m not trying to poison you!”
“I’m fine” slurred Harry before sliding on his side and closing his eyes.
She took in Harry’s rigid posture and shot Draco a last encouraging smile before gathering her things and saying simply:
After a hectic debate and despite the risks for her recovery, said Healers agreed to wake her up for a few minutes, enough for her to tell them what she knew and hopefully locate Draco.
“That’s a cheap one.”
“It’s my mother, I have to go!”
“Excellent” exulted Lucius with a sadistic smile.
Draco could come from hearing the gravelly needy words and the sight alone but he breathes deeply, trying to get back on earth.
Then, they sent their Patronuses as the signal launching the assault.
But when a whole squad of Auror stormed in, the sturdy, no-nonsensical, stern old thing -who was bloody-well used to have her way no matter what- decided that she had had it. She was about to shoo them away ferociously once and for all with her infamous and widely feared dressing-down when she met a hard green gaze that couldn’t possibly belong to someone so young. Shaken to her very core, she retreated confusedly, patting her lilac hair feverishly and muttering to herself with furious indignation. No, all things considered, it definitely wasn’t Nurse Leahy’s day.
“Go help him, Hermione, he needs it and I promise I’m fine”
“That’s all very well but how do we do that?” asked Ron, nonplussed. “I don’t suppose there’s a spell for that?”
Then when Healers had outrageously agreed to put the poor woman in danger and wake her up to be questioned she had said nothing either, after all Healers were supposed to know if the risk was worth-taking or not and it wasn’t any nurse’s business to question any of their decisions.
Harry’s stomach flips and he drains his glass in one go.
“Don’t stop… Please Draco, fuck me, fuck me hard”
“Harry, stop, you’re at
“What is terrible, ‘Mione?” he asked cautiously.
, as long as you call me Draco, of course” he answers with a pleasant grin and Harry is purely and utterly lost.
So he sucks in deep breaths, trying to rein in his magic and steady his raging pulse. But when he stops in front of his office on the Department for Experimental Magic’s level and sees the sign on the door, the reality finally sinks in.
“If you insist” said Malfoy lightly and turned his head to look at him with a crooked grin. Harry felt a violent blush creep through his neck and bloom on his face. He cleared his throat but couldn’t detach his eyes from the playful stare.
Hermione beamed and her eyes looked shiny. She reached with her hand then realized he was too far and let it fall at her side again. Harry cleared his throat and the bushy brunette shook herself.
“That I never did figure out. I think he found some cracks in the walls and ceilings” said Harry thoughtfully, reminding him of a notoriously famous Basilisk.
Draco raised his wand and cut the shirt open with precise movements and whispered spells. When he was done, the damaged piece of fabric slided around his hips with a quiet rustling.
“Sodding Gryffindors that are too polite for their own good” muttered Harry darkly as he stomped off the get the door.
“Did he…? When I left… Mother, I’m so sorry… I didn’t plan on disappearing like that, I swear…”
Potter melts under him, moaning in his mouth and threading shaking fingers in his hair as if he just quite can’t believe this is real. Draco feels as if he’s drunk with the heady feel of Potter falling apart against him.
to make him lose control but the hell if he knew why. It was like school all over again.
“And why on earth would Lucius Malfoy do that?”
George and Seamus hadn’t blown up any piece of furniture –yet-, Ron was happily drunk and hugging everyone at close range –though Harry didn’t know if it was the alcohol or the prospect of soon being a Dad-, Luna was introducing Algernon to everyone and distributing fresh copies of the Quibbler (a special issue on Garden Gnomes promising lots of details on how to teach gnomes how to dance and sing), Neville was trying to explain his paper on the curative properties of the Mimbulus Mimbletonia that had just been published in a fancy Herbology Journal and rewarded by an obscure big-shot accolade, Dean was getting sloshed with Ernie, Ivy and the other Aurors that had became friends over the past months and were in various state of drunkenness, all trying their best to survive a shady-looking drinking game under the shocked wide eyes of Hannah and Angelina, and Ginny and Blaise were chatting happily about something utterly funny based on the intermittent thundering laugh of the dark-skinned wizard and the tears running on Ginny’s cheeks.
“Fuck you” snarled Harry. He stormed out of the room and slammed the door forcefully, making the wall vibrate.
“So, what’s the plan?”
Harry gropes around for his glasses, puts them on and jumps on his feet, completely freaking out. He rushes to the tiny bathroom adjourned to the bedroom and plants himself in front of the mirror to confirm what is already fairly obvious at this point.
Harry watched him thoughtfully as the pale blond poured a splash of milk in his own cup and mixed the liquid evenly.
But Narcissa cut him off and cupped his jaw like before, locking her blue irises with his intently.
“I’m perfectly aware of who James Bond is, miss Evans” Malfoy cuts him grandly but in spite of the venom Harry expects, it’s more like a gentle tease. Harry winces at the title, though.
, he thinks but he is soon hit with the fact that he has no clue how he is supposed to introduce himself, he hasn’t thought about an alias and this is beyond stupid.
, diagnosed the clinical part of his brain. He only had minutes before he would bleed to death.
Harry asked himself confusedly. He tried to get up and grimaced as waves of pain came crashing on his wretched body. He was in a poor state, covered in blood and feeling old. He looked for his wand, trying to sort out his thoughts. Something was nagging at him. He was missing something. Something important.
“That was very good, thank you. I had no idea you knew how to cook” said Draco cautiously. They had eaten in relative silence and he didn’t know how to broach the heavy subject of his arrival here.
“Is that so? And how, exactly are they not living up to your standards?”
“Yes, yes, please yes, anything you want, God, anything…” his head is thrown back in pleasure and he’s biting his lips to stifle his cries.
“Well, you’ll live. But I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for the scar.”
“I thought you might react like that.” said Harry tiredly, he sighed.
“Sorry.”
“You mean I’m going to love not being able to get my hands on you? I highly doubt it” he says earnestly and Draco’s chest tightens at the mournful tone.
okay, you’re joking, right?” said his best friend with a strangled voice “is that
“Goodbye, Harry” he said softly, then he was gone.
“I don’t think you’re suggestible or shallow, I’m merely trying to be prepared for anything.”
“Draco… God I want you so much… More, more, please I want to feel you inside me…”
“Me, being, you know… practically… your boss… You would hate it” he said, looking at the bottom of his glass, and the end of his sentence was almost lost in a whisper.
Harry does, dumbstruck, and fidgets uncomfortably with his unfamiliar clothes.
He’s covered in blood —again— and Draco doubts he’ll ever get used to it. It must have showed on his face because Harry waves a hand tiredly and says with a hollow voice:
“Yeah, I know, but it’s alright, you can go back to bed. I’ll manage. I’m used to it, really.”
Harry and Ron exchanged a puzzled look then shrugged and left.
“So, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are out” Draco goes on. “It leaves me with Slytherin and Gryffindor and by Circe, I should be able to ascertain which one in a second, it’s not as if those Houses have anything in common!”
The tall blond winced when the bitter liquid coated his tongue but felt instantly better, his mind clearer and his nausea gone. Draco was still feeling several-centuries old and his head was way too painful but at least he wouldn’t pass out in a pool of his own retch.
“Well, I’ve been busy!” Harry says defensively “Before and during the War it wasn’t exactly the best time and after…” he sighs “I didn’t want people to have sex with me just for who I was. I had a few dates with muggles blokes but it wasn’t the same, there was so much I couldn’t tell them. And… I guess I scared them off with the scars and the nightmares.”
Inside him, a low thrum urged him to go faster, to blast anything and anyone that got in the way because Draco was here somewhere and he needed to make sure he was okay. The worry and paralyzing dread that had been filling him since he woke up concentrated in a blazing-hot adrenaline flushing through his veins like a wildfire.
Widely unappreciated, Catesby was the slimiest person Harry had ever met and the most unpopular Head Auror since the War. Viscous, bumptious, and the worst kind of rule-maniac, he had no idea of the realities of the field and treated his subordinates like lesser beings. Everything was about figures and personal advancement for him and that was it.
Malfoy frowned in his sleep, wrinkling his pure features. Harry was so close he could see his lashes were as pale as his hair and brows but almost black at the base. His nose was straight and his cheekbones high and sharp. In sleep, he looked vulnerable and softer, so removed from his usual haughty and cold persona. His lips were full and rosy, swollen from their rough kissing. Harry slipped his hand in the white-blond hair once more. At places, they were matted with blood or undefined grime and Harry couldn’t imagine what he himself looked like. The pale skin was marred by cuts and bruises, dried blood and soot. Harry thought he had never seen something so stunning. Malfoy’s pale body had an eerie and unearthly look, like a magical character from a tale.
Suddenly, the noise of the entrance door resonated in the hall and the kitchen.
“Well… Goodnight then” said Harry but he didn’t move.
“Well, come on already!” shouted the dark-haired man excitedly, he then addressed him an exuberant smile.
“Yeah, she’s a bloody genius that one, I’m telling you” Ron said proudly “We’ll be out of a job in in ten years time if she keeps going” he scoffed.
But no, he had to go there, he had to get in Parson’s office and he had to get himself cursed into a girl until further notice. That’s apparently just how his life was supposed to be. Never fucking easy.
“What does?”
“You’ll never harm anyone, ever gain” said Draco suddenly, rising unsteadily on shaky legs, the very image of defiance. His grey eyes were flashing with hatred and provocation.
Things were definitely looking up.
After a split second of total unresponsiveness that makes Draco question everything and think he got it all wrong again, Potter kisses him back and all conscious thought flies out of his head. It’s raw, fierce and desperate at the same time, fulfilling an urge so strong and primal that it makes him dizzy.
Draco raises a brow sarcastically and his dry tone contrasts with the subtle twitch of his corner lip.
He paused thoughtfully.
Draco is blinded by his own orgasm, coming hard with Harry’s name on his lips, he comes again and again, coating their bellies with warm ropes of semen.
The sun was beginning to rise above the horizon and the young man moved closer to the window to immerse himself in the spectacle he could probably never get tired of.
“How thoughtful of him.”
Draco wasn’t sure what happened then but next thing he knew, he was pinned on his door and Harry’s hard body was pressed up against his, devouring his mouth in a lustful and fiery kiss, making his head spin. His hands went through the white hair frantically, angling his head to search his mouth deeper and deeper. Harry tasted like wine and cinnamon and his hot tongue traced maddening patterns against the blond’s. Draco’s pace was through the roof and blood rushed in his ears. It was so good he could have sworn his feet weren’t touching the ground anymore.
“I don’t know” Harry smiled secretly.
“Well, sorry I didn’t live up to your expectations” said the ex-Auror darkly.
With a fluid and practiced move that has more its place in a dojo than in the bedroom, the blond manages to make Harry end up on his back with an undignified yelp, Draco straddling him. He recovers quickly though and starts brushing Draco’s torso with his rough hands but the blond tssks at him. With a flick of his wand that he has miraculously produced out of nowhere, silvery threads as soft as silk wrap around Harry’s wrists and tie themselves to the headboard neatly.
Suddenly, Harry pushes him away and scrambles on his front on the rug, urging Draco to fuck him in earnest. The pale blond is reluctant at first but the noises Harry makes drive him slowly mad and soon, he’s pounding into him relentlessly. Draco’s walking on the thinnest edge and his whole body is tensed in the effort of not letting go. He tries to angle his hips to hit the spot that’ll make Harry unravel completely and finds it at the second attempt. Two thrusts, three, four and he’s coming explosively with a raw, shouted “Fuck!”. His inner muscles constrict around Draco almost painfully and he finally lets go, emptying himself into the quivering ring of muscles, sobbing with the strength of his release.
Harry remained silent, trying desperately to remain calm and control the rising anger that made him breathe harder and harder.
Harry collapsed on the couch, closer to the dead than the living after a double shift that left him on the verge of passing out. He hadn’t slept for way too many dozens of hours and couldn’t feel his fingers anymore.
Harry burst out laughing. They were soon both rolling on the floor and holding their sides, tears streaming down their cheeks. Harry had never heard Draco laughing. It was a brilliant sound.
Potter gasps when his fingers brush his torso, exploring his chest. He grazes a nipple that instantly hardens and a trail of gooseflesh follow in its wake. The kiss turns heated once more, Potter claiming his mouth in a bruising kiss.
Draco moans and kisses him harder, his hands are roaming on his back and hips hungrily. When Harry tugs his shirt out of his trousers and slips his hands on the hot skin of his back, he lets out a feral growl and steps away from the table, holding Harry by his hand towards the fire. A breathless incantation and a flash of green flames later, they’re snogging frantically in a small living room. Draco doesn’t even switch the light on.
“Tell me about it…” Harry laughed “But you know what, he’s actually… rather ok, decent even. Mind you, he is bloody insufferable sometimes but overall, he’s mostly ok. And it’s nice to have someone in the house sometimes, like Luna used to.” He smiled.
“As part of which investigation, may I ask?”
“If you want me to, sure” answered Harry with a shrug.
“What do you want Draco?” asked the ex-Auror implacably. Draco remained silent for a while, staring at the enchanted window.
“No!” he exclaimed but his mother ignored him.
When Sándor slashed his wand, a violent golden light shone around her, then she collapsed gracefully and didn’t move.
“What is it?” asked Draco cautiously, starting to worry over his bizarre statement.
“I was told my drunk parents died in a car crash and that I was lucky my aunt and uncle took me in after that. And I believed them. Until Hagrid came, barging the door and telling me I was a Wizard.” Harry chuckled. “He brought me cake. It was my first birthday cake ever.”
Harry’s fingers stroke the bulge in Draco’s black pants and a surge of want coils around his spine when he finds the hard flesh twitching under his touch. Draco hisses and his hot breath raise goose bumps on Harry’s skin. The soft flesh between his legs is already slicked with how bad he wants him, mixed with his apprehension. But he wants this way too much to let that stop him, Harry realizes.
“I think you’ll find you’re in no position to issue threats of any kind” he said calmly and studied him with that gaze of a peculiar shade of blue, almost as transparent as glass or ice.
Because Draco is clever, he may even get Hermione a run for her money one of these days. Shame he was too busy being a nuisance at school, it would’ve been fun to see them fight over grades and not Draco’s usual bigoted comments.
Anguish, hopelessness and shame fleeted on Draco’s face, tears silently spilling out of his silvery eyes.
“Lucky me” scoffs Draco. The idea of Harry getting off with strangers is both turning him on and making him feel possessive.
“There’s a cellar” said the muffled voice of the raven-haired Auror.
“I don’t know. I have no proof. But it wouldn’t surprise me, that’s all I’m saying.”
“You know, you’re wrong” said Harry after a moment. Malfoy’s grey eyes shot and met his with a questioning look.
“Oh, alright, give them both my best”
Nurse Leahy had had it. When the patient had been brought in by those dashing Aurors and asked to stay besides her, she had said nothing, even if they were outside visiting hours and way too many.
The young man seemed lost in his memories, staring at the forms in the fire, a light smile on his lips.
“Come on, you can’t turn all blushing virgin on me after what we’ve just done” Draco teases.
“Wet dreams…?” smirked Draco.
“It’s too dangerous!” exclaimed Harry forcefully “I cannot let you do this!”
“Are you ready?” asks Draco with a low voice, nipping at his jaw.
The sun was up and a warm breeze was caressing his clammy skin in a soothing embrace. Draco inhaled the smells of earth, wet grass and rotting wood with pleasure, forgetting his headache and nausea for a blissful moment.
“I told you to sod off” he growled.
The Slytherin froze, their late night kiss suddenly very vivid in his memory. Draco warily turned around and took in the glassy eyes, spiky black hair and grey skin of the Gryffindor. He looked unfazed, obviously too hangover to worry about his drunken groping.
“Don’t you understand what a worthless piece of filth you are? You don’t even deserve the efforts I’m spending to erase you! You’re nothing, only a little toy for when I get bored and make you writhe on the floor in pain. You’ve never been more than that, you’re MY object, MY device, a mere THING. You’re empty, only a shell of a man, a coward…”
“What is it you wanted to show me?” asked Draco warily.
“My way sounds loads more fun” he mumbled petulantly.
“What did you do?” said Draco in a panicked voice. Harry’s smile disappeared.
“Thanks” Southwell winked at her mischievously.
“Yeah”
And that expression is back, that Malfoy mask Harry hates. Draco’s back to Malfoy, he’s back to Potter and Harry is not sure he can handle that after months of getting closer and closer. It’s as if all the air in his lungs has been sucked out. He can’t stop staring at Draco in silence, unable to speak, desperately looking for words that won’t come.
“Thanks, Hermione, that was great.” Said Harry, sated by the huge dishes of Indian food she had cooked for them. The Dahl had been particularly good, hot and fragrant.
A moment of silence followed her vehement speech, Harry was still gaping and struggling for words while Hermione was beaming like a light-house. A disbelieving tentative smile stretched Ron’s lips and Neville looked from his friends to their colleagues, utterly clueless.
Harry kissed Draco lazily and tugged at his shirt.
“You know… attractive” Ron awkwardly, draining his pint in one go and rising to his feet to get another round, his cheeks a flaming red.
’. Hermione knew better than to push the matter further but she was sure Harry was hiding something and it was clear on her face. A slight blush crept on Harry’s neck.
In the morning, when grey ray of lights started to lay their delicate envelope on London, Harry finally gave up on sleep. He had woken up a few hours earlier with a throat raw from screaming and his head throbbing in pain. He finally climbed down the stairs to get to the bathroom and take a shower. The Auror paused on the landing, all senses in alert. He was pretty sure he had heard something.
“Harry Potter, you’d better fuck me right now or so help me God, I’ll-”
“You could say that” he scoffs.
“Just when it was getting interesting! You wound me Jean, how cruel of you!” exclaims Draco dramatically.
“Well, thanks for the vote of confidence.” Said Harry, feeling a bit wounded.
The Leaky Cauldron was packed to the rafters, full of a cheering crowd and without Hermione’s stroke of genius for their booking, they would have been in a dire situation. Comfortably installed in a modest alcove, the three of them were exchanging news and celebrating Catesby’s undignified but well-deserved sacking (the bugger was now waiting for his trial) and Ron’s promotion as Head Auror.
“Yeah, you’ll be like me now.” said the Slytherin calmly.
“What? Hell, no!” Harry exclaims, horrified.
On an inexplicable impulse, Draco raised his wand. He had never managed to perform the spell before but something made him try it. The pale blond whispered ‘Expecto Patronum’, focussing on the day he had seen Voldemort’s corpse collapsing in the Great Hall. Nothing happened. Draco creased his white brows and tried again, remembering the way his mother hugged him the morning before he left for Hogwarts for the first time, how proud and excited he was. A flimsy silver mist flickered then vanished. Draco swore silently. He then thought about the relief and elation he had felt when he had seen Harry jump from Hagrid’s arms at the battle of Hogwarts. He had known in this moment that Voldemort would fail, that the War was over because the Gryffindor had survived him, again. He had felt the shift as if the fabric of Fate had been ripped, the thrill of hope and faith flooding him like the warmth of the sun.
Draco laughs darkly, a nasty throaty sound.
“Harry?”
“Sometimes I really wonder why you weren’t sorted in Ravenclaw” said Luna with a smile “then I remember the day you punched Draco and it all makes sense again.”
“Well, for starters I’m a freak too, so it kinda makes sense, ‘birds of a feather’, you know? And did you really think my life would get normal just because the War ended?” he laughed frankly when he saw Ron’s discomfited face.
The Slytherin watched Harry from the doorframe, all repressed rage and shaking furor. He looked dangerous and exhausted, both achingly powerful and frail. It was only a matter of time now.
“You bet” Harry chuckled and winced.
Harry thrust in rhythm with Malfoy’s sway of hips, meeting him with filthy noises of flesh crashing against flesh and willing his climax away as hard as he could. His right hand was buried in the silky white strands and the other one held Malfoy’s hipbone like a lifeline.
“A book Luna gave me, from a famous muggle writer called Stephen King. It’s called the Dark Tower” said Draco distractedly.
“You’re still having nightmares? Maybe you should see someone, after what you went through...”
“You have to stop rushing headlong into things like this. The War is over and we can’t lose you, Harry” she said softly with a pleading tone that tore at his heart, reaching for his hand. Harry took it and wrapped it in his larger rough palm, a huge lump stuck in his throat. He nodded diligently.
Something heavy and warm crawled over him with a sleepy hiss and Harry smiled.
Harry couldn’t answer to that, he was too angry.
“I see. What a waste” Malfoy sighed theatrically, his eyes roaming lazily up and down Harry’s body with an appreciative glint.
“Not really” said Harry with a goofy grin.
When Malfoy positioned himself above Harry’s twitching cock and rested the soft patch of tender flesh on the tip, Harry was afraid he was going to come just from the touch and the sight. He closed his eyes and breathed in shakily, sucking air into his lungs desperately.
“Bloody well said!” suddenly exclaimed Neville excitedly “I like this one” he added aside, elbowing Luna, who smiled secretly.
“Same here. And I never tried a Firebolt before, they’re amazing.”
” he answered in the same language.
“I’m sure you did plenty of naughty things at Hogwarts yourself, eh? So let’s hear some of it” he said to Draco with a conspiring face.
“Mmmmh, indeed.”
“I know that. But I cannot escape, it’s too late for me.”
“Sorry, what?”
“Harry… It’s nothing like that. Of course I felt in your debt but it doesn’t mean I would have…. let you have your way with me as repayment” Draco shook his head. “Is it so hard to believe that I just want you?”
He then noticed that the light was still on in the room and turned to face Draco, curled up in his favourite armchair with a book. With a small jolt of happiness, he realized that there were such things as Draco’s “favourite armchair” or “usual teacup”.
“Come on, even Slytherins admired him in some regards. At least for his Quidditch, Merlin the git could fly. Not to mention how all the girls were following him like enamoured Crups” he smiles sadly “And he did save us all, annoying blubbering reckless buffoon or not” Draco adds softly, he seems far away, looking into space. In this instant, Harry wishes he could use Legilimency and find out what he’s thinking. He doesn’t answer, afraid he might spill the beans.
“Yeah.”
“Harry is this because of Ginny and… that guy Hermione talked about, the one in your team?”
Then a searing heat swallowed his cock slowly, deeper and deeper, tight and wet and
“I’ll leave you to it, then”
“You want me to fuck you, Potter?” asked brashly Draco, teasing Harry’s entrance with sleeked fingers. The raven-haired man shivered.
Harry remained silent and Draco kept talking, hesitantly. He had nothing to lose.
A heavy silence stretched between them for a while.
Harry stood in the dark kitchen for a while, rubbing his face and fighting the hollow feeling that had taken residence in his chest. He knew it wouldn’t be easy but he had hoped Ron and Hermione could at least try to understand. The tall dark-haired wizard sighed then nearly had a heart attack when the lights of the room suddenly switched on. He whipped around and his wand was out before he could help it, startling Draco in his smart light pyjamas.
“Deadly.”
“I want to taste you…” the platinum blond said, then disappeared from his sight in a rustle of fabric.
“Tell me what you want…” he says in a low voice.
“I said I never had sex before, it doesn’t mean I’m a prude, you know”
Reluctantly, he let go of the nipple and glided over the flat, defined stomach when Draco’s fingers slipped in his hair, tense and eager. A devilish smile stretched Harry’s lips and he went lower, nudging the hard shaft with his mouth, teasing Draco with his hot breath and making him squirm and moan with frustrated want. Harry ignored the quivering hips mercilessly, nibbling on the Slytherin’s inner thighs.
“I heard you with Catesby and you’re not the only one who’s tired of his shit in the Bureau. He’s clearly unwilling to tackle the Dark Wizards’ threat –suspiciously so- and that’s too much. There’ll be no more Dark Lord pulling the strings in the Ministry if we can help it. Two wars were enough as it is.”
“I’m sorry to put you in danger but I needed to see you. Your father has gone crazy”
His head fell on Draco’s shoulder and he stood motionless, his whole body racked by shudders. The Slytherin wrapped his arms around him, caressing his muscular constricted back vibrating with effort.
“I COULDN’T JUST STAY THERE AND WATCH IT HAPPEN! WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IN MY PLACE, UH?”
When Harry started to stir, he retreated in the kitchen and put the kettle on the stove. A sleepy Harry soon stepped in. He removed his brown robes for good and with a critical look banished them. Then the Auror sat heavily on a chair and took the cup of tea Draco handed him gratefully.
“Oooh sweet Merlin” the blond sobbed uncontrollably.
“Ron?”
“So, about that drink? Are you gonna take it or you’re planning to keep looking at me like I’m the Bloody Baron?” He smiled indulgently and held the glass closer.
Draco doesn’t answer. Before his frazzled nerves betray him —and in an appalling fit of uncharacteristic Gryffindorishness— he throws himself at Potter for a rough, hungry kiss that makes his body sing with relief.
Harry braces himself and grips his wand, acutely aware he’s going to get hexed in a matter of minutes. For a second, it reminds him of when he went to the Forbidden Forest. He squashes a hysterical need to laugh at his own melodramatic tendencies. Still, there’s a fair chance he might end up dead on the kitchen floor of his former school-rival-turned-lover —so very Shakespearian— so he thinks he’s entitled to a bit of drama.
“Please, please Draco, I need you… I want you to fuck me until I don’t remember how to breathe” Harry cuts him off pressingly.
But Harry cuts him off with all the firmness he can muster when his heart pumps more whisky than blood in his veins.
But Harry couldn’t deny the little jolt he felt every time he heard the ‘bip!’ notifying him he had received a text. In his dull daily grind including –exclusively- going to work with less and less enthusiasm then going home and crashing on the bed until his alarm went off the following morning, the witty and funny conversations were like a bucket of fresh air.
They have crossed paths in the Ministry and managed to be civil but Malfoy always looks so stiff and guarded, shuttered away behind that cold aristocratic façade of his. Harry is suddenly reminded of Malfoy at his trial. He looked like a wreck then, hollow and starved, broken. Though Harry is hardly the one to talk on the matter. They had exchanged a few stilted and awkward words after Harry had delivered his testimony in favour of Malfoy and his mother. He had given him back his wand and thanked him. The Slytherin had looked startled and thanked him back for the fire and his testimony.
“Draco, you up?” asked Harry’s deep muffled voice through the wood panel.
“Draco, I want you, God I want you so much…”
“I’m okay” he said holding their hands with strength to emphasize his words. “Don’t worry”
“Come on, get on with it!” Harry’s impatience was evident.
He takes both of their cocks in hand and continues his slow strokes. Potter groans at the contact then it’s Draco’s turn to be startled when his hand is suddenly coated with a cool and slick familiar substance.
Hermione is the first that comes to mind but for obvious reasons, that won’t do…
“Shut up and fuck me, Potter” Malfoy cut him off with a voice like gravel and rocked his hips, turning Harry’s answer in a confused babble, the rush of pleasure turning him completely incoherent.
They rushed in the corridors of the Ministry, rising more than a few eyebrows and whispers on the way.
He had received the smartphone at Christmas a few years ago from a very red and embarrassed Dudley who gave it to him to ‘stay in touch’. The gesture was surprising from the former bane of his existence but Dudley had changed a great deal since then and Harry was glad they managed to salvage their relationship and create a connection, however tenuous.
After the first week, Harry is not ready to blow up his house but he would be happy to extend the courtesy to the Ministry and all the pillocks currently working inside it. Starting with his best friend.
“Go ahead, I’ll search the place and meet you at St Mungo’s” Harry said roughly, avoiding her stare.
“Then why the hell did you run away like that?” The blond wanted to know. Harry rubbed his eyes and sighed.
“That’s it, you’re off muggle movies” sighed Hermione.
“But-“ he tries.
“How much?” he snarled between clenched teeth. Ron sighed behind him.
“Congrats, Ron, that’s great news!” Neville exclaimed and slapped huge, friendly slaps on his back. They both became quickly engrossed in an eager conversation and Harry turned back to find Hermione looking at him thoughtfully.
They climbed the stairs haphazardly and soon realized they were definitely drunk.
“I see. So, you decided to use me instead” the dark-haired wizard was pinning him on the spot with his unforgiving X-ray stare, his face unreadable.
“No!” The sound he meant to shout only came out as a whimper. Completely out of it, he held on to the body against his as he felt like he was falling backwards. He lost consciousness before the end of the fall.
“I’m sorry I yelled at you” said Draco after remaining in a comfortable silence for a while.
“I… I get it. I get why you did it. But you should’ve told us. I mean, you could have told me before going there on your own.” He paused. “But I get it. I get it now” and Harry suspected Hermione had something to do with it.
“It’s not that I’m surprised the fucker would do that but… Hell!”
” said Algernon sanctimoniously, dreaming.
“Merlin, that was hot” Draco blurted out.
“To be fair, the Sorting Hat did have a hard time deciding too” he mumbles but Draco throws him a sharp look and Harry feels suddenly very naked. And naked is not what he wants to think about right now.
“I is having a very important message for Mr Malfoy Sir!”
With a gasp, Draco realized the Auror was shirtless, only wearing his usual pair of faded jeans that hanged dangerously low on his hips and gave away that his underwear was… missing. Of course Potter would stand half-naked in his garden at seven in the morning.
Harry smiles peacefully and closes his eyes, the wrinkles on his forehead finally gone.
“For Merlin’s sake, what the actual sodding fuck...?” he muttered and rose up on his feet. He was wearing dark grey pyjamas and his clothes were nowhere to be seen.
“Could we not talk about
obsessed…”
When Hermione’s warm hand slipped inside his, he realised silent tears were rolling on his cheeks. They were standing beside the hospital bed. The fair-haired man could fell Ron’s silent and sympathetic -if awkward- tall presence behind him.
and a
He lies back on the bed, leading Draco on top of him.
“Neville, sit down” said Luna with a dreamy smile “Hermione will explain but we are quite in a hurry”. Neville fell on the chair and nodded obediently.
“And you, what did you want to be after school?”
“Draco, please… I can explain, just sit down a minute…” he pleads.
, provided his weary brain. It
“Fair point” finally says Draco and he looks at Harry’s frown. “It’s not a problem for me, Harry” he says softly, cupping his cheek “I just wish I’d known so I could make it more… I mean, I all but jumped you earlier, that’s no proper way to get started” he says ruefully. Harry kisses him slow and dirty.
“Speaking of blow, where did you learn that?”
“What are you talking about?”
“Are you alright? Did I hurt you?” croaked Draco.
“Hello, everyone!”
“Why am I not surprised?”
He groaned. The unhelpful dreams were enough as it were even if he miraculously didn’t remember precisely what they were about. Though he had pretty strong suspicions and a general idea about what the green eyes and tanned skin featuring in them were up to.
“Hum, no Ron, I didn’t meet anyone.” he hesitated. “But, I do have a new roommate.”
“I’m sorry I yelled back” said Harry calmly. “And about what you said… You’re right. It wasn’t my choice but… I couldn’t let you sacrifice yourself like this. I have blood on my hands too, and not only from enemies, you know.”
, he castigates himself while searching frantically for a convincing name.
“Good grief, you definitely have shady connections then, Auror Potter!” laughed Draco, oblivious to his trouble.
With a last anxious look thrown his way, Hermione rose to her feet, levitated the unconscious witch and disapparated.
“-but I swear on my parents’ grave that I didn’t… It was real, Draco. I couldn’t tell you who I was… Look I was cursed, I didn’t want to trick you into it… I just wanted… I knew if that was me you’d never…” his voice faltered.
Hermione and Luna exchanged a sharp knowing look.
Harry tried not to laugh at his dishevelled state, he picked up the snake who coiled around his neck and shoulders.
“Fair point. So you were in Hogwarts around the time she was then, I gather”
“Hermione, come quick!” said Harry in an urgent tone. He was kneeling beside a vague, cloaked form, running a pulsing-blue diagnosis spell over it.
“Like that?” asks Potter with a rough voice, thrusting harder.
The pale blond couldn’t help but notice it was the first time he heard the Gryffindor say his name. Draco heard the light rustling of fabric when the dark-haired wizard moved. He could feel Harry’s presence just behind him.
“Great, you were in a dire need of a bit of rest, I reckon”
1) "Tűz Által" (the Hungarian gang led by Briccius) means "Through/By Fire" in Hungarian
His face is blank and shuttered but Draco sees the pain and for a fleeting moment he believes him.
Harry was sitting on the edge of the bathtub, his brown robes in a heap on the ground. He was barefoot and his t-shirt was torn and smeared with blood, revealing a gaping wound extending from his left shoulder to his right pectoral, barring his upper body and gushing the crimson liquid. His left arm hanged from his side pathetically and he was holding rolls of bandages in his right hand. Beads of sweat covered his forehead and dampened his wild mane.
Harry shrugs apologetically, walking backward to the door.
In the following days, they resumed their easy camaraderie and playful acerbic arguments as if nothing had changed. Draco didn’t mention the kiss and Harry didn’t either. But the pale blond clung to that peculiar Birthday gift that he would be hard put to forget, sometimes waking up in his bed with the ghost of scorching lips on his skin, breathless and confused.
Pleased with himself, he gathered his harvest and brought it inside. Humming obliviously, Draco set a big pan on the stove and rummaged through the cabinet to find herbs and cloves. Then, he settled on the workbench and started on his crushing, slicing and cutting.
“We have reasons to believe that a civilian is being held and his life threatened by Lucius Malfoy and his associates as we speak.”
Draco kneeled before him and tilted his chin up, searching his eyes.
Blue eyes look right back, the spell hasn’t worn off. He’s still flushed from his earlier thoughts and his cock is throbbing. His cock. Fucking hell, this is real; he’s a guy again. And the timing couldn’t be worse. Of course it had to happen this way. Because that’s how his life works, isn’t it? Harry takes steadying breaths, trying not to have a panic attack; it would really not be of any help at this point.
Sometimes, he just can’t go back to his big empty house for another session of self-loathing so he practices another type of self-pity. He goes to muggle pubs to drown his sorrows in a few tumblers of whisky like a sad-cliché-casually-alcoholic character from a detective movie. Or he walks in the streets of London until he doesn’t feel his limbs. Or he puts the invisibility cloak on and waits in front of Draco’s flat. He knows how pathetic it looks but he can’t help it.
“It doesn’t change what I did” he finally said in a breath, his words charged with such raw emotion that it made Harry shiver.
The lump in his throat grows bigger. Draco lays his body on Harry’s and kisses him again, he tries to go slower, to soothe the dark-haired man but Harry’s having none of it; raiding his mouth, his hands brutalising the fabric of his shirt and pressing his body against him like a wild animal.
“What?” Draco avoided the fire of the green orbs and went to the door frantically, closing it silently after looking outside to check if anyone had heard them. “You’re crazy!” He hissed in a low voice.
“Anything. Yell at me, shout, punch me, throw me out, hex me into next week, just… do something!” Draco was pacing the room frustratedly.
His mercury eyes filled with tears as relief and gratitude engulfed him. The tall fair-haired man remained in a state of inner wonder for long hours, in an introspective jubilating turmoil.
are the disgrace of this family!”
“SOUTHWELL!!! GET YOUR ARSE IN HERE RIGHT THIS SECOND!”
“Give me that” asked the white-haired man sternly, holding his hand for the bandages. “Have you cleaned up the wounds?”
“How very shaggable, Mr Malfoy…” Harry shot back wickedly. Then he laughed.
be a bit… temperamental, to say the least” she offered him a tiny smile. “But it seems like you mean a lot to him. He was freaking out when you disappeared and you should’ve seen his face when your mother told him everything…” she trailed off. “It was like in the old days.”
“What did you want to be when you were a kid?” asked Harry brusquely.
Draco screamed so hard he felt something rip in his throat. A bubbly-rosy mix of blood and saliva coated the corner of his mouth.
Harry was suddenly overcome by a wave of tiredness and let his head fall back on the wall.
“Yes, I believe you” she chuckled “But Harry, barging in Malfoy Manor alone like that… you could have gotten yourself killed” she said severely.
Harry remained silent for a moment.
“More” demands Draco.
He finally withdrew himself and grabbed Harry in a fierce embrace. They collapsed on the sofa in a tangle of heated and salty limbs trembling from exertion.
“It’s just that… I’m worried about my mother.”
“Draco… That was… that was just… incredible...” he mumbled sleepily. A wide grin painted his features when the object of his praise huddled against him.
“Happy Birthday” said Harry with the widest smile he ever saw on the Auror.
“Well, I did when I was Jean, last time, but I’m not sure it counts…”
“Don’t mention it” mumbled Ron with a little smirk.
“Just… give him time” she advised and took his hand warmly.
Suddenly, the wards shimmered. Someone was at the door. Harry rose to his feet, still shaking his head in disbelief with Draco’s last sentence, a wide smile etched on his face.
Harry swallows and shakes himself. He examines Draco’s wound. It’s clean and not so deep. Harry steps closer to the blond sitting on the table and he’s engulfed in a citrusy scent that stirs something primal inside him. It’s like his brain is under a slowing spell. Everything is painfully slow and intense, like a bright light on eyes that stayed too long in the dark; Draco’s hands are soft on the outside, with oval, opalescent nails and a fine dusting of silvery-golden hair from the wrist up. His palms are a bit rough though, he must fly often or maybe it’s all the fiddling with all of his mysterious contraptions. He clears his throat.
“Yes” he hisses.
Draco fluttered his eyelashes seductively and said in a sensual voice “Well, would you know any interested parties to refer me to then...?”
A heavy silence grew between the two young men who carefully avoided each other’s stare.
Harry chuckles at the memory of Hermione’s discomfited expression at the capillary-rebuff. He turns away from the mirror and sways a bit, the Firewhisky is still blazing its way through him and he knows with certainty he’s going to be sick tomorrow, very very sick. But he doesn’t care. “And that’s the magic of being bloody plastered” he advises his bed eruditely before crashing on it in an unceremonious heap. He takes off his remaining clothes and summons a pair of ragged pyjamas. Harry puts them on and slips under the covers delightedly.
The spell hit him and his consciousness wavered.
“P-Potter… Potter, stops!” Draco’s already dangerously close to release, he tugs the black hair back and makes the Gryffindor stand up again. He kisses him brutally and tastes himself of the wicked tongue.
“Well spotted. Though it is quite common knowledge that I was” he says with a tight smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes.
When he realized, much of the same was waiting for him at Grimmault Place, he almost considered not going back this night either. But then, his inner Gryffindor kicked-in. It was his fucking house after all and he wouldn’t give Draco the satisfaction. With a mixture of exhaustion and defiance, he walked home, letting the cold wind sweep away the stuffy atmosphere of his office. Immersed in his mutinous thoughts, he didn’t notice the cold splatter of rain that drenched him in a few minutes. When he opened the door, Harry was cold, resolute and completely soaked. A delicious smell tingled his nose and he frowned.
Heart sinking, Harry stood awkwardly in the living room and avoided her stare.
In a fraction of second, several things happened. He felt a prickly feeling on his neck telling him something was off and saw his mother pure features decompose in fear. As he started to whip around, a snarky voice just above Draco’s shoulder said:
“Yup. Crafty old bugger.”
“Blast-Ended Skrewt?” suggested Ron somewhat sluggishly, lightly swaying on his stool.
“I said I was a virgin, not a monk” grumbled Harry.
“Please sit down, I’ll be right with you” Malfoy says in his sharp accent without looking up.
“Congratulations buddy, you’re going to be a great Head Auror!” said Harry warmly for the umpteenth time while clinking his glass against Ron’s. He wasn’t drunk yet but it wouldn’t be long if he kept going.
Draco opened his eyes. He took Harry’s hand in his and pushed it away from the scar.
“Well at least he didn’t kill him, I suppose that’s a start” she said wearily.
“I don’t know, this one doesn’t feel very horrific… It’s about a gunman seeking vengeance.”
After his literal wake-up call the previous Friday, he has spent the whole weekend freaking out about those feelings he doesn’t know what to do with. And now that the bloody elephant in his brain has been acknowledged, he feels completely vulnerable, brittle, ready to break at the first provocation. He doesn’t know what to do.
Draco washed his hands with hot water and cast a sanitizing spell on the wounds and his hands. He then smeared the electric-blue salve on his fingers and approached Harry.
He takes in the spacious room with tall enchanted windows, a simple desk with two chairs and large tables in dark solid wood. Malfoy is hunched over one of these and at Harry’s greatest surprise, he’s wielding a screwdriver over a mess of wires and metal frames, half hidden behind the device. Only a mop of white-blond hair and the hand clutching the screwdriver are visible.
“I will Harry, don’t worry we’ll find him” she said resolutely and Harry wished he could believe her unconditionally.
Harry felt strange. He hadn’t realized he felt that way before saying it out loud.
This morning though, he caught sight of a very different view. One story below, Harry was standing on the edge of the cobbled decking area, facing the sun, unmoving, with a golden-red snake coiled lazily on his shoulder and around his neck.
“Yeah, I think I’m better off with a bit of transfiguration, thank you very much!” said the Slytherin with a disgusted expression that reminded Harry of Narcissa.
“I knew it was too good to be true…” mumbled the Auror.
They both drank the remainder of their tea in an easy silence.
“Oh thanks Harry, though I feel as discreet and graceful as the Giant Squid right now. But you like quite fetching yourself in that tuxedo. I can’t figure out where you got the idea but you’re very handsome.”
“Sorry” Potter mutters with a shy smile and slips out of him carefully. He then shuffles away and Draco holds back a whimper at the loss of his skin.
Harry thrust harder, trying to ignore his own climax building around his spine like an implacable wave threatening to drown him.
“Don’t be like that, it’s supposed to be so much better for girls… I mean when Hermione and I-”
Then Draco’s eyes fall on his clothes and on his neck, no doubt closing in on the love bites that grace his neck, the ones he made himself.
“It doesn’t matter now.” Harry smiled “How about we start over?”
“Erm… Yes, I’m fine, sorry if I woke you up…” answered Harry sheepishly.
“Are you s-“
“You cannot fathom how much that memory haunted -haunts- me.”
“What?”
“Well, I shall consider myself warned, then.” Draco flashed him with a smile so unguarded and bright that it made Harry blink.
“Salazar, you’re so hot…” murmured the pale blond in Harry’s ear, making him shiver. He kissed him hotly, plundering his mouth in a frenzy of wet and messy kisses, turning Harry in a shivering mess in an instant and making him moan desperately.
“Harry, I-” started Draco but the dark-haired wizard cut him off with a curt hand gesture.
“So, I’ve only been a girl for two hours and I’m already demoted and supposed to be a rookie now. Well, I do understand better the fight for women rights and gender equality” Harry sighs.
Their couch cracked loudly and caught fire suddenly, licking at Ron’s sleeve that started to burn as well. Ron started and doused the brown garment with water then turned to the sofa with practised ease.
“Oh, that’s just perfect. Bloody fantastic!” exclaimed the blond. “Well, I’m off to the bathroom and if I find your thing in the bathtub, so help me God!” he stormed in the bathroom and shut the door forcefully.
“Kingsley and I talked about it and we thought about something. We’re very well aware of the fact that if he casts you out of the DMLE to wait at Grimmauld until this all blows over, you’re likely to blow up half the block and yourself with it”
Draco’s flint-grey eyes shot up, surprise painting his features.
Harry inhaled deeply, knowing that their chances of success depended on his ability to keep a cool head. Now wasn’t the time for one of his spectacular losses of temper.
“What are you doing here” asked Harry with a look of such pure challenge that the young wavy blond Auror took a step back. Shooting him an amused look, Southwell, her black spiky hair shining under the hospital lights, smiled wickedly and said:
“Sir, we need to set up a tactical raid over Malfoy Manor immediately” declared Harry to a bewildered Belarius Catesby who had been sipping his coffee, Daily Prophet in hand and comfortably settled in at his desk.
But the shutters are back. His face is as cold and blank as a marble statue.
“We all did things we’re not proud of.” He said softly, tilting his left forearm to reveal the Dark Mark, faded but still embedded in his skin.
“Well, in my former… line of work… the ability to patch yourself up came in quite handy”
He manoeuvred the dark-haired man to the end of the bed and pushed him gently so the Gryffindor would sit back on the cobalt-blue covers. Harry looked at him with a gaze so charged with trust and desire that Draco could have come on the spot. He took a deep breath and started undressing under the hungry green orbs. The Gryffindor’s eyes were raking over his body with evident voracity.
to me, and she came up with the name.”
And now, on top of this already gigantic steaming pile of shit, he has to go to Draco sodding Malfoy —of all people!— for his first assignment. He has apparently been made liaison between him and the Aurors for the unforeseeable future. Just great.
“That night, in Sirius room... I…wasn’t pretending. It meant something to me. I knocked you out because I had to but I didn’t plan it that way, it just… happened.”
“What are you doing here anyway?” asked Harry a while later.
He finally looks up to find molten silver pools raptly fixed on him.
“It’s late, I think I’ll head home. Thanks for the food.”
“I love you too” whispered Draco, terrified and thrilled at the same time by the four daunting words. He had never felt this vulnerable.
“Please, let me explain…” Harry begs.
“Thanks ‘Mione” said Harry and blushed a little.
Draco was drinking a cup of tea in the kitchen, pretending to read the Daily Prophet. He was actually thinking about his mother, alone there; thoughts that had kept him awake once more, as proven by the bluish tinge of the skin under his eyes. What would she think? How hard would his father lash out at her because of his disappearance? Guilt and worry invaded him once more when the pale face of his mother floated in his mind.
“Yeah, yes” agrees Harry. They fumble their way through a pleasant bedroom with light tones. Draco lays Harry down on the covers and undresses him slowly, tenderly, kissing him lazily. Harry feels like he’s going to pass out from the frustration if it lasts any longer but he can’t seem to gather his wits enough time to say anything coherent. When Harry’s been divested from his shirt and trousers, he avidly drinks in the sight of Draco undressing until only his tight black pants are left. He’s stunning. The pale flesh is taut and compliments the slender frame beautifully. His movements are graceful and with his hair set alight by moonlight, he looks like an otherworldly creature, a fay stranded on earth.
to tell them.” he continued “They’re used to come barging in here twice a week, it was bound for a disaster sooner or later”
“No need” says Harry more brusquely than he intended and steps in the room. “We all have bad days” he smiles tentatively.
“It’s alright Draco, you’re going to be okay” said Narcissa tenderly.
He just needed to go home. But as he tried to persuade himself, even he knew it was pointless. He wouldn’t feel any better at home where everything reminded him of bittersweet memories that invariably led to a stinging rematch of Draco’s betrayal.
“Morituri te salutant” Harry mutters darkly and pushes the door.
Harry’s cock twitched treacherously at the sight, under the rapt attention of the smug blond.
“I’ll kill you for this” Harry promised darkly, the sombre edge inside him growing harder and wider like a huge scaly monster stretching his wings and sniffing at blood, thirsty for more.
” said Draco with a flawless accent.
They were sitting outside in the back garden, enjoying the warm June weather around an old wooden table. They had devoured the meal Harry made and were now getting slowly but steadily sloshed.
The years —and a mad manipulative father out of his hair in house arrest— have been good to him. He looks taller, more confident and accomplished. He has filled out since the trials and has grown into his pointy features. Malfoy’s still as sharp and pale but in an elegant and ethereal posh sort of way.
He’s only human. And horny. And sex-deprived. And currently drunk.
Harry clenches his teeth. It’s probably the billionth time Ron has said the words and he wants to throttle the moron but in a valiant effort, he pushes away the urge to strangle his best friend in the middle of a pub and shrugs moodily.
Short breathed and on the brink of collapse, Harry’s muscles were aching, his lungs burning but he kept going without faltering. Draco’s body relaxed and when he looked up to meet Harry’s eyes, the Gryffindor emptied himself noisily in the quivering hot channel, Draco’s name on his lips.
“Yeah, good point”
So yeah, you could say Harry is used to unwanted attention. He had thought that at least, not being treated like Harry Potter would be a relief but he isn’t so sure now.
The white-blond wizard looked up but didn’t answer, blood boiling in his veins at the sight of the lust-blown irises and the dazed, wanton expression of pure need painted on Harry’s features.
Draco kissed him again, slowly, tenderly and unbuckled his belt. Harry’s breath caught and his hips jumped forward reflexively. The white-haired man smiled against his lips and opened his fly, his pace ran when he found out Harry wasn’t wearing anything under the faded Quidditch pants. He unhurriedly kneeled before the Gryffindor on the smooth carpet and slowly removed the piece of clothing covering his hips and legs. The blond then languidly ran his hands on the strong thighs and firm buttocks. Harry’s breath was shallow, and his head had fallen back, revealing a glorious tanned neck that woke Draco’s hunger.
Briccius Báthory, the Head of the Báthory clan and Duke of Latvia, was a clever and prominent wizard. His father, Andrej, had been a strong advocate of Grindelwald, an allegiance that almost sealed his family’s fate. A fact that had deeply scarred his son Briccius. Briccius had been raised in similar beliefs than Lucius and shared the same hunger and vengeful desires. Throughout the years, he had risen in Eastern Europe as a dangerous and wealthy Wizard with deep pockets and deadly friends. Lucius and Briccius, old classmates from Durmstrang back when Lucius had took on a one-year exchange when he was young, had then forged a strong bond that Lucius had carefully rekindled over the years. Briccius was aware of his plans and was entirely disposed to fund Lucius’ attempts to seize power and bring a Wizard rule on Britain, especially if their alliance was to be settled with a blood link. Briccius had indeed offered to bond their families through marriage, betrothing his daughter Belladonna to Draco. It was an excellent match. The young woman was highborn, clever, beautiful, cultured, everything a pure-blooded bride was supposed to be. Not to mention that she would be the key to vast sums of money and an access to a very handy network.
“I should warn you that Ron is rounding up everyone we know to find you a date. He is quite obsessed about it.”
The Auror felt resignation still the chaotic swirl of emotions inside him. He wouldn’t last long, black dots already clouding his vision from blood loss. Harry willed himself, fighting tooth and nails against the malicious drowsiness that claimed him, muscle by muscle.
Harry edged closer to the door of the bedroom. It was shut but the Auror could still hear sounds coming from inside. He listened carefully, trying to figure out if the pale-blond needed his help.
When the light of dawn seeped through the tainted panes of the small window, Malfoys started to stir and Harry turned his head embarrassedly. He didn’t want to be caught staring for some reason.
Voldemort’s death had in no way dampened Lucius’ thirst for power. The Dark Lord had been arrogant, and weak, impatient. But Lucius had learned patience and the value of alliance, something Voldemort in his Hubris, had never understood properly. After all, he wasn’t a pureblood and even if he was Salazar’s heir, he hadn’t been raised as such. Thus, he wasn’t familiar with the game and politics among the elite of the Wizarding Society. Sheer power wasn’t everything and Voldemort’s ignorance had finally cost him his victory and his life.
“Really Draco-”
“It’s a little late to ask me that, don’t you think?”
“That was a bloody miracle” he finally said.
In two steps, Harry’s on him and his eyes are blazing with this peculiar intensity he gets sometimes. A feral need to reassess his rights on the world of the living, to grab, touch, feel and loose himself in it.
“Merlin, Potter you’re such a prude” scoffed Malfoy, shaking his head with a wolfish grin.
When Draco came back a few minutes later, wearing dated Slytherin Quidditch robes, he saw a Firebolt waiting for him on the wall on his right but no sign of Harry. Then a shadow ran on the ground, he rose his gaze and saw a red and gold flash speeding above his head.
“He’ll live” said Southwell gently.
Malfoy raised his chin, bracing himself for perspectives that were no doubt much more bleak, and opened the door. He paused in the doorstep, facing away from Harry, the tense line of his shoulders like an insurmountable barrier and his knuckles turning white on the frame.
“I don’t know, I was just thinking about my job. When I was young, I wanted to be an adventurer. With a hat and a whip, like Indiana Jones” he smiled absently.
Draco twitched and launched the spell on himself. Distracted, he didn’t catch what Harry said next.
“I don’t know. What do you want me to say?” he asked evenly.
Ignoring his unsettled stomach, Harry cupped the snake muscled length and took him with him upstairs for a night-time cuddle session.
“Oh. Sorry yes... I-I had to, erm… change your clothes, I-I didn’t… you know…” stammered Harry while blushing profusely “I’ll get you some clothes” he said hurriedly and ran from the room.
After they were seated on stools in a corner of the tiny dim lit room, they all fell in an uncomfortable silence around their first round of drinks. Harry drank his scotch too fast then they ordered a second round. It was finally Hermione who spoke first.
“Don’t be. I hexed you too that day.”
kiss like that” said Draco with a strain.
“Merlin knows…”
“Like I said, even the Sorting Hat had a bit of a hard time choosing between Slytherin and Gryffindor”
” said the strained and anxious recorded voice of Draco. There was the sound of a deep, fortifying sigh then:
“How dare you, you dirty little-” he started, but his dark acerbic rant ended in a squeak of shocked surprise as Harry’s tongue had found another target, the patch of puckered sensitive flesh he had been acquainted with a few hours before.
“You told them, then” he added with the same detached voice.
“Yes-yes-yes-yes” hissed Harry, hanging on those words that had lost all meaning.
A few hours and countless glasses of amber-steaming alcohol later, Ron and Harry are stumbling and giggling in the night, so thoroughly sloshed they don’t even feel the biting cold.
“Thanks, I think I need it. That and probably whisky” he rubbed his face drowsily.
“Your little spells won’t affect me much I’m afraid, M. Potter. Briccius lent me the most delightful artefact, you see. Thanks to that handy device I’m very pleased to tell you that I’m completely invulnerable to magic.”
Potter gives as good as he gets and they’re soon both heavily panting, completely dishevelled and extremely frustrated by the layers of clothing slowing them down and preventing skin on skin contact.
“P-P-Potter…?” he stammers, shell-shocked “What are you doing here? How did you come in? What the fuck is this about???”
*       *       *
“Well, you may have had time to get your head around that, but I wasn’t so lucky”
“At your service, roommie” slurred Harry and he laughed uncontrollably at his joke.
With a flick of his will, the fluffy blanket wraps around Draco who smiles lightly.
“Good point.”
“No, it’s Narcissa… I think she’s still alive…”
“You like that, feeling me inside you?”
His words conjure fire in Harry’s loins and he moans. He feels the hard flesh nudging against him and tries to relax. Draco slides in gently, inch by inch, rocking his hips slowly.
He just shrugged and went back to the lockers to take a deliciously hot shower. Despite his earlier thoughts, he caught himself smiling at the idea of working as a Healer. After all the damage he had done, it would only be fair to try and fix what he could to atone for his past lack of judgement. But more than that, he had always been fascinated with regenerative magic, ever since he was a boy. He remembered devouring the books dealing with Healing in the huge library of the manor, curled up in the enormous leather armchairs. But this was before his life went haywire. He sighed deeply.
“Believe me, you are going to love it”
“Oh right. I don’t think you’ll have to, though. I told them you… had changed. I explained everything and… It took a bit of time but they understood. I’m not sure there will be anything left to forgive because… I think they already did.”
“Harder, please fuck me hard, Harry!”
“So hard, sometimes I can hardly breathe” he murmured. Harry didn’t expect that, his cold front fell at that exact moment and the green irises filled with doubt. He searched the silver gaze for the truth and Draco could see he didn’t believe him.
“Fucking hell, this is going to be a bloody nightmare”
Harry complied and threw himself on the blond, loosing himself in the rush of sensations that burned through him like a wildfire. He was seized by need, his want so strong and raw it was like having his flesh stripped from his bones. Like he was pulled in every direction to breaking point. A groan escaped his lips and Malfoy smiled against his mouth.
“Virtually, yes but not exactly” answered Ron with a wicked grin “We have the element of surprise and Narcissa filled us in on every ward protecting the Castle”
“Harder” pants Harry, his nails digging into the muscles of his arse, and Draco’s thrusts pick up the pace, making filthy smacking sounds.
“Did you really blow up Catesby’s office?” asked Ron with an incredulous smile, like a child half-convinced it’s not true but half-hoping it is. Harry sighed.
“You mean…?”
Hermione snorted good-naturedly and shook her head. The Gryffindor held him what looked like a plump little sandwich wrapped in brown paper. Now that the fear of losing one of the only people he had left in the world had lifted from his shoulders, he realized he was ravenous. He took the sandwich with a grateful smile and took a huge celebratory bite, forgetting all sense of decorum. It was absolutely delicious and he groaned with satisfaction.
