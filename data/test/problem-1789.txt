“Fine.” Draco crossed his arms, falling silent for all of five seconds. Long enough for their little group to breathe a sigh of relief, until Draco abruptly stopped sulking, because he was going to kiss Harry soon. He waved his wand, the
“I mean we’ve insulted each other and stuff, but it’s no worse than before in all honesty. What’s up with the obsession about Malfoy anyway?” Harry didn’t particularly want to admit how close he’d been to calling Draco ‘Draco’, which would undoubtedly raise unwanted questions.
Severus hastily cleared his mind, and looked around the room. Most of the death eaters were looking on with malicious glee, a few with mild indifference - but then Severus caught Narcissa’s eye. She was terrified, and desperate, and conveyed a clear message:
Pulling himself out of his mind and back to reality, he looked into those oddly blank, piercingly green eyes. “There’s a bond, but it’s been formed incorrectly. It goes to nothing, rather than to your mind. I’ll do some reading before next lesson.”
“Now, the lunch break is in fifteen minutes, which is the best time to go in. Are you all ready?” Millie asked. Narcissa and Severus nodded, and they all went outside to apparate to Diagon Alley.
“But I’m not—” Harry’s protest was cut off by a yawn, after which he scowled that his body seemed to be insistent that Draco always be right.
He sprung to his feet, only to hit his head on a low ceiling. Rubbing his head, he stood up cautiously — he had to bend his neck slightly to stand upright. It was extremely dark, but his eyes adjusted quickly. There was a light coming from behind Voldemort and Lucius, who were both regarding him with cold derision.
Apparently the weather had decided to take a turn for the worse in November, and for the first time that year Harry was glad to not be on the quidditch team. Instead he was in the library with Draco, the warming charm just starting to fade as the sun set.
and get everyone who wasn’t in the inner circle out for twelve hours. Happy that they would do that quickly, he levitated Dumbledore’s corpse into the lake a significant distance away from the island, removing the old man’s wand for good measure. He wouldn’t be using it anyway. And his body couldn’t be found for his plan to work.
After what seemed like an age Harry had woken up, Draco only knowing as the shadows of Harry’s mind were reeled in as they usually did when he was awake. Those shadows still terrified him - but for Harry’s sake. He knew they would never hurt him, but he wanted nothing more for them to disappear. On better days, they seemed less opaque, but now they were a void, absorbing all light (if it could be called that - their minds were on another level of reality, after all).
Harry nodded, and walked over to Draco’s trunk, unlocked with a wave from Draco’s wand. Draco walked over to the mirror, and fixed his nose, before removing his robes, jumper and shirt, grunting at the pain from moving his arms. He fixed his ribs, before turning, about to ask Harry what was taking so long. Harry had been staring at his back, and was now staring at Draco’s face, and torso, looking at his various injuries, bruises already blooming.
he could have been one of them, then he wouldn’t be in this mess — he arrived at Severus’ quarters, and was hammering on the door.
him to another location, and he couldn’t breathe because he was being compressed between two beds of needles—
First, it had just been those who had it worst — the muggleborns who had still come, for some reason, people with openly anti–muggleborn parents, people who had been in the DA but didn’t have the stomach to tolerate the torture. Neville and Lavender were the main way of corresponding with people in the Room, as they regularly went in and out to check on everyone. Mrs Norris often came to the sixth and seventh year Gryffindors that she’d once ratted out for being out at night when there was someone in the corridor who needed help, and most of the upper year Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs had been caught by the Carrows as the Ravenclaws and Slytherins ushered younger years through corridors, throwing regretful glances over their shoulders.
Hearing the impatience in his father’s voice, Draco raised his wand, ignoring how the tip trembled slightly. He took one, two deep breaths. The wand stilled, and Draco tried again to muster up the anger towards his father. He could imagine the curl of his lip, the hardness in the steel–grey eyes. The steadiness in his wand as he raised it to punish him.
“Food!” Scorpius exclaimed - he wasn’t quite talking in full sentences, but food was one of his favourite things. He almost ate as much as James.
Draco felt a boot literally kick him up the backside. Then they were coming from all angles - on his legs, his ribs, his face.
a horcrux—” Ron started, but Bill was already casting, and the ball flickered a few times before depositing Nagini on the floor, who hissed and lunged. Bill dove out of the way and Ginny cast
“Here, chop these up.” Draco slid the leeches across the table, grinding up the glittering moonstone himself. Knowing better than to argue, since Draco would present a well-reasoned argument as to why
Draco felt a warmth in his chest at the statement, but said “Of course I am. We’ve already established this.”
As he skimmed the lines of text, which were horridly small and in cursive, of all things, his gaze kept drifting to Harry. He still remembered how he’d reached for Draco in his sleep as he’d had left the bed, the little whimper that had escaped his mouth. Draco had almost stayed, but as his stomach rumbled, he settled for a small warming charm. If he smiled fondly as Harry relaxed and burrowed a little further under the duvet, looking surprisingly adorable…well, no one needed to know that.
“Nice to see you, Perce. Did you know, the Dark Lord killed mum and dad, and is now taking over the Ministry?” He felt a twinge in his chest at talking so flippantly about his parents, but it worked — Percy blanched, freezing in place as Bill hurried out of the lift, making a beeline for Umbridge’s office.
Harry must have fallen asleep, because he woke suddenly at the scent of buttered bread and a cup of too-weak tea.
Draco jumped as Severus suddenly hissed in his ear, “You can walk faster than that, you know. I’m not so short that I can’t walk quickly.”
Draco sighed. “Probably not, since you’re dead on your feet — you’re really not hiding it as well as you think — and I am too. But soon.”
Anything to distract him from Potter’s smirk, which was clearly going to haunt him for the next week.
Harry ate a decent amount of food - an egg and half a piece of toast, and then he pinched some of Draco’s fruit - cut into perfectly even pieces - as well, much to his dismay. He often got a sharp elbow in his side for his troubles, but it was a small price to pay for the flush that crept up Draco’s neck afterwards.
“Harry is probably going to go through there — look there he is.” Ron turned around to see Harry and Dumbledore walking over from the edge of the rock. “There’s traces of magic there, and there,” she gestured to random parts of the wall, which in Ron’s opinion, simply looked like solid rock. “Although I’m not quite sure
A whispered conversation with the Fat Lady from the otherside of the Gryffindor entrance told her that the portraits knew of many,
“You look like you’re already dead.” Voldemort smiled - a thin, terrifying thing. Harry’s expression didn’t change.
Harry had no idea how long he had dozed for - not fully falling asleep in fear of nightmares, not fully awake in fear of reality. He cast a tempus - it was ten minutes into dinner, but Harry panicked at the idea of spending another meal with his housemates. They were rowdy enough to cover how quiet he was, but sooner or later they’d want him to join in the conversation, and they’d been back for twenty-four hours. The idea of all those eyes on him, expecting the old Harry back, laughing and joking with them...Harry shook his head. They wouldn’t expect that of him if he wasn’t there.
“Look at you, of course I need to do something, git.” Draco could feel both weakness and stubbornness through the bond. Brilliant.
Now, he knew he looked much, much worse. He was probably as skinny as first year (skipping dinner probably didn’t help). His cheeks were hollow, his eyes were dull, his hair had even given up on trying to escape from his head (although nobody could possibly not call it messy). Hell, he couldn’t look good if he had to cast glamours to stop everyone from worrying.
“This belongs to you.” And Potter produced Draco’s wand, rather than a fist to the face as Draco would have expected.
he did, since he couldn’t see him — and Harry’s body was hoisted over Severus’s shoulder as they started to run up the stone stairs, their heavy footsteps and breathing no longer hidden by the muffling charms. They tore through the entrance hall, Draco almost falling down the steps outside of the door. He thought he just might make it, before he heard a loud screech.
He didn’t see the kitchen he apparated into, didn’t feel the towel being wrapped around his shoulders. All he remembered saying was
This continued for another week. Harry’s schoolwork improved significantly, to the delight of teachers, mostly due to Harry being able to ask Draco questions through the bond.
, and his expression barely changed when the teacher announced they’d be duelling next week. The Potter he’d known before would have been ecstatic at the idea of a lesson with no writing,but this Potter’s eyebrows barely twitched when the announcement was made.
“I think the emotions coming through the bond would have managed that well enough. So this is a regular occurrence?”
heavily cursed, and couldn’t function — but Ron still snarled slightly at the sight of his best friend in pain. Harry visibly relaxed as the boat finally emerged, and Ron flinched as Harry almost fell out of the boat into the too–still water as he climbed into the boat. Dumbledore used some weird magic to get in the boat while barely rocking it, and they were off.
Severus nodded, and took another deep breath, before starting the enchantment. It was a modified version of the muggle repelling ward, but could be keyed to someone, or something’s, magical signature. It was normally used to keep owls out — since all owls have similar magical signatures — but using the magic from around the mark, he could keep everyone with a mark — including the Dark Lord himself, since he was the one who administered it — out. Even better, the wards couldn’t be taken down by anyone they were keeping out. This wouldn’t be a huge issue for the Dark Lord, if he decided he was truly desperate to get into the building, but it could certainly buy them time.
“Based on the way you’re fidgeting, you’re either Charlie or Bill — only you two fidget when you’re nervous, everyone else stands unusually still.” Bill immediately stopped fidgeting with the side of his robes, but the damage had been done. “Charlie swore he wouldn’t step foot in the Ministry until they closed the loopholes in the dragon–hunting laws, and he doesn’t go back on his promises, which means you’re Bill.”
“We need to tell her parents.” Kingsley said quietly. “And we need to get back. Everyone will be worried.”
Draco didn’t know why he was surprised. Even when he was stalking Draco in sixth year, Potter didn’t have a clue about Draco’s main plan (which he
“You can’t tell anybody.” Draco stared at the professor as if he’d turned into a pink pegasus and told them that he actually shit rainbows.
There was silence for a minute, and the pale, blurry shape above him shifted slightly. “I’m going to get you something to drink. And eat. I’ll be back in a minute.”
“What the fuck is going on?” Harry asked, staring straight ahead rather than the gorgeous person next to him.
He shook himself out of his stupor and walked over to Draco, slipping into the bench beside him. If anything, at least his potions grade would increase; while he was very good at defence, got by in transfiguration and charms and had Neville to help him in Herbology, Hermione’s trademark method of teaching (recite the textbook until he understood/stopped asking) didn’t help in potions. Which he needed a good NEWT in to at least keep his options open, whether or not he wanted to become an auror.
. Under his mask, beads of sweat appeared, due to the heat of the area, the stress of the situation.
Bill chuckled weakly, his face growing paler by the second. Ron prayed desperately that super strength and healing had been passed on to him from Greyback’s attack — they needed as much time as possible.
seen Draco do — his thumb and index finger were in small circles on either side of the parchment in time to his breathing.
He didn’t close his eyes until he heard the sound - or lack of - of a silencing charm being erected around Harry’s bed.
Ron suddenly burst through the door, holding a tarnished, silver pensieve. “Could probably use a couple of polishing spells, but should be fine to use — there was no dark magic around it, or anything.”
He came to a stop in front of Harry, who stood. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that earlier, it just slipped-“
“They died,” Fleur said softly, hearing how Bill’s voice cracked it’s the effort. Tears traced down Bill and Fleur’s cheeks as Remus gasped in shock.
They knocked out the goblins, and quickly passed the dragon with the clankers. Thanks to Millicent’s knowledge of how the vaults were protected, they didn’t set off the gemino curse, and quickly grabbed the goblet.
Lucius didn’t turn to look at his son, although a muscle in his face twitched at the footsteps. Draco, to his credit, didn’t flinch at the likely vicious glare directed at him by the Dark Lord, and knelt a healthy distance from his father.
However, she had no idea where Draco and Severus were — and until she did, staying here could probably result in her gaining valuable information for them. Even so, she packed a bag with everything she’d want if she had to leave in a hurry. No need to be unprepared.
His front was littered with scars, not as many as his back but still more than an eighteen-year-old should have. Over his heart, there was a second, white, lightning-bolt scar. Draco took another step forward, so he was a foot away from Harry.
However, Harry didn’t so much as move from the bed for the majority of the day. Draco finished all of his homework and an entire book, and Harry didn’t so much as move.
Harry shrugged, pulling back the duvet and swinging his legs off the bed. “Only one way to find out,” he said, pushing himself off the bed and immediately falling into Draco.
of cleavage, but somehow still looked classy. Draco would never understand Pansy’s knack of showing a lot of skin and never looking slutty. It was a wonder that he hadn’t realised he was gay sooner, what with Pansy prancing around looking like that.
Harry asked Draco why he wasn’t angry, and the blonde hadn’t replied, just rubbed comforting circles into Harry’s back. When Harry looked up, into Draco’s eyes, they’d flickered, just for a second. He’d temporarily shifted into the Draco who had been hidden behind the glamour when he first walked in - and Harry knew. Knew how Draco felt, knew why, but he also knew that Draco was wrong. He hadn’t had a choice, since his parents had been threatened. He hadn’t had the choice, at the start of the battle, to give himself up for everyone else. For Fred. For Colin. For Tonks and Remus.
“Gr-Hermione. Can I talk to you?” His gaze flickered back and forth between herself and Ron, who’s arm had tensed around her shoulder.
“What room is he in.” Hermione was grinding her teeth as Draco led her down the corridor and gestured to a door. She took a deep breath, purposefully relaxing her face. She hissed to Draco “wait outside,” stepping in before he could reply and shutting the door in his face.
The news that Harry and Draco were now a couple spread like wildfire, whispers following the couple through corridors and knowing smiles being directed at them during lessons. Flitwick had been especially delighted with them during charms the next day, giving them twice the usual number (which was already high) of smiles, and house points for no apparent reason (“10 points to Slytherin for picking up your quill! 15 points to Gryffindor for doing your tie correctly!”
Harry nodded again, watching as Malfoy walked over to the doorway and hollered for Snape, who came sprinting down the stairs, his cloak flaring behind him as he hurried into the room. Ron and Hermione came thundering after him, all three of them staring at Harry in shock, who raised a hand in greeting before taking another bite of bread. It was really good bread.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, who smiled and put his invisibility cloak over himself and the basket. He didn’t question what Draco had been doing down there in the first place until he’d got up to the dorm, halfway through the miniature feast the elves had packed for him. He didn’t let himself think about it until after Ron had helped him finish it off, and he lay down to go to sleep.
Voldemort pressed two fingers to his forehead as the death eaters started to file in. “You’re all dismissed. Lucius, take them to the cells on the highest level, and go get two doses of veritaserum from Severus.” Why they all felt the need to come back — once a mission is complete, they’re dismissed until there’s another mission. If only there were more smart people. Maybe he should start indoctrinating the Ravenclaws...then again, he had plans to indoctrinate the whole of Hogwarts.
“Err...thank you?” Draco said, not quite sure what was going on. Apparently satisfied with their answer, the group left, a couple with slightly wider smiles than the others.
“Your little plan isn’t going to work, Potter.” Voldemort sneered at him, before stepping into the cell. He tutted at Harry’s leg.
Shooting a small portion of his mind forward, to the mouth of the river, he saw small lights flickering, illuminating a small building. A cottage. Draco found it fitting for Harry’s personality, despite feeling that Harry deserved more.
Snape swept into the room, a frown creasing his features. “He’s been in a cell which absorbs all his magic, so he doesn’t really have a magical core at the moment. It will heal,” he added, as Ron and Hermione turned towards him with horrified looks on their faces, “but it will take a bit of time. He was only able to apparate us here because Draco allowed him full access to his magic—”
Harry abruptly stopped his ponderings as a collection of death eaters walked in the room, masks on. Not that that did much good - Harry recognised Lucius’ blonde hair and Bellatrix’s untameable mass of curls, as well as Greyback (or his smell, in any case. The guy really needed a shower).
Drying his eyes, Draco cast a tempus behind Harry’s back. It was five minutes until lunch, and while Draco hadn’t been planning on going down, Harry was extremely thin under his glamours and clothes.
Harry flooed into Hogwarts at quarter to six - he wouldn’t be the first one there but would still have time to adjust. It was a shock to his system to see so many people, but thankfully he was used to it due to Weasley Sunday lunches. He made his way through the crowd, trying his best to control his breathing, eyes on Ron and Hermione.
Regardless of his internal complaining, Draco couldn’t say he didn’t enjoy studying more than he used to, even if his productivity had decreased considerably and he stayed out later than usual. He’d had more opportunities to practice his disillusionment charms.
“I’m just going to...sit down for a minute. Will you do the…” Dumbledore trailed off, holding out the little crystal cup to Harry and sitting against the rock the basin was mounted on.
Harry rolled his eyes and got to his feet, determinedly hiding the slight sway as blood rushed from his head. He was quite sure Draco noticed anyway, but he headed to the door, glaring at Draco, who was standing next to it. “I’m going downstairs.”
Harry slept through the rest of the day and the night, and woke up as the sun rose, his magic recharged and roiling beneath his skin. He immediately made several shorter jumps through the Yorkshire Dales, before stopping at Leeds and stealing some food from some muggle market stalls. Not much — a few pieces of fruit, a bread roll. He wandered around the city, pretending to be a tourist, while his mind worried about Draco; he didn’t even know who’d made it out of the forest. There hadn’t been any dead bodies that he’d seen, but that didn’t really mean anything; he did leave almost as soon as he woke up, after all. His magic took a while to recharge, but still less time than he’d expected; he was almost certain Death was helping him along.
did he have to saunter? All it did was draw attention to that perfect arse of his. He reached blindly towards the tea, eyes never leaving Potter as he sat with his back to the Slytherin table (a good thing, as Draco’s blind reaching resulted in a full glass of pumpkin juice in Pansy’s lap. Where did that even come from anyway? Draco certainly hadn’t poured himself a glass - his plate was still empty as well.)
He carefully pulled the last thread of magic, smiling as the rest of the wards fell, and reached into the drawer to pull out the wand.
“Ron, Harry likes any — Draco!” Both of them stopped in the doorway, both wearing expressions of blatant shock.
Everyone exchanged glances, before Harry shrugged and followed her. The room was small and circular, with a wall pattern that, at closer glance, was loads of drawers, each with a family name and year. All the wood dark, with the carpet and ceiling a light beige. There was little decoration, likely because of the magic. It kind of reminded him of Ollivanders shop.
The four went into the village, setting fires to homes. Something in Draco’s chest clenched every time he sent out an
“Such high praise.” Draco allowed himself to be dragged back to the bed, opening the basket and pulling out a plastic box. The sight of it made Harry chuckle.
to break into Gringotts, so any aspiring, reckless Gryffindor could likely break in as well. The diadem — well, there was nowhere safer than that undiscovered room, and he doubted anyone would notice it, never mind realise what it actually was. Everyone who knew about the Horcruxes was either incapacitated, or dead, and yet Voldemort couldn’t shake the feeling that he would have to look after them better. Well, he had Nagini, and would soon have the cup in the Manor with him. He’d have to take down the Ministry first — then he would be able to do what he wanted.
Harry genuinely felt bad about not replying to Draco. He didn’t want to hurt Draco, but he just couldn’t bring himself to talk to anyone. Better to keep to himself. Nobody really cared about his issues.
Harry and Draco nodded their farewells, gladly accepting when Ron offered to take the basket of leftovers back to the elves and fleeing to their rooms. Harry launched himself onto the far side of his bed, Draco joining him on the other side soon after.
“Feeling melancholy?” Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, the effect thrown off by the gravy at the side of his mouth.
“Yes I have met him, Ron, and I gave him his wand back. I’ll probably just avoid the room anyway - just go in to sleep.”
Bill glanced at Fleur, who nodded, and wiped his eyes. “Be our secret keeper. For — for Shell Cottage?”
Harry gave up after a narrow miss with Filch, who was still muttering about the clean up after the Battle despite most of it being cleared up by volunteers over the summer. He’d shivered, and realised that Draco would have to come find him to give him his cloak back, and then he could tell Draco how he felt. And maybe ask him on a date.
Lessons were horrible. Umbridge dropped in on lessons without warning, looking for any way to fire any teacher that wasn’t the Carrows. Nobody had expected her to support You–Know–Who this wholeheartedly, and yet the only teachers she praised were the Carrows. Defence had simply become Dark Arts, and muggle studies was now a study of everything wrong with them. Filch hated Umbridge as much as the student body, after having been dragged into many muggle studies lessons to be treated ‘as muggles should’ and, in an odd twist of fate, had taken to helping students late at night to avoid Umbridge and the Carrows.
Harry opened the Marauder’s Map, searching desperately for Draco’s name - and there it was, not thirty seconds from the common room. He made to get up, before stopping - he was itching to return the favour to the six people whose names he’d never heard before, but realised that he would have no idea what they looked like. And as he watched, they walked out of the room, leaving Draco alone. He’d have to hunt them down with the Marauder’s Map - later.  Now, he had to look after Draco.
“There are passages! I could go in through the shrieking shack — you guys still have the map, right?”
At dinner, the couple had walked into the Great Hall to whoops and wolf whistles from all four tables. Draco had blushed bright red, and Harry had turned on his heel and walked straight out, dragging Draco along.
“I think you were right when you said something was fishy about Harry not contacting us, and when you said that letter was dodgy. Anyway, the first thing to do is to put up a fidelius around the house.”
Severus found himself looking after Remus for three days, after dragging him up to a bed. Forcing him to eat and drink. He still wasn’t quite sure what had happened, but finally coaxed out the reason while internally muttering
Overall, they thought they had a pretty good arrangement. Draco, because he got to spend ridiculous amounts of time with his crush, practically in a relationship. Harry because
Not that he was ready, as such, but apparently this particular day he was in the right mindset to be informed that this was something a bit more than a crush, at least.
Harry sighed. “I’m alright. I could be worse — I could still be in that dungeon — but I’ve got plenty of food and tea in me, a comfy bed, a decent amount of sleep…I don’t really feel up to actually doing anything, but I can chat, which is more than I could do twenty–four hours ago.”
He sighed as his stomach grumbled - Draco couldn’t even let him finish his meal before distracting him with those damn
“Now you two.” Molly nodded at Ron and Hermione, who were standing still with equally determined looks on their faces. One look between each other and they knew what to do.
“Making potions. The Dark Lord said he needs healing potions, so we’ll be doing that. He took some yesterday, for whatever reason — probably fell down some stairs.”
He watched Draco’s breathing even out before letting out a breath and letting go of his emotions slightly. He held his breath again as Draco shifted in his sleep - either a dream or a result of the onslaught of emotions Harry sent down the bond (he wouldn’t have, but he found it really difficult to keep them coiled up and hidden) - mostly shame, embarrassment, fear and guilt.
At some point, Harry had somehow got it into his head that he was leading Ginny on and that he needed to apologise, which had resulted in Ginny laughing hysterically because “honestly, Harry, I’m a
“My parents sacrificed themselves.” Ron finished in a low voice, Hermione looking at him in surprise. “Bill, Fleur and the twins are in it, and Charlie helps out when he can.”
“With stupid amounts of raspberry jam and no butter,” Harry immediately replied, feeling his face grow warm under Draco’s triumphant gaze.
Hermione looked at Harry with wide, earnest eyes. “We thought you were off with Dumbledore at the time, but then with everything we must have just
members of the Order, so I figured they should be updated on…current events.” She shot an unsubtle glance at Draco and Severus.
“I can’t—” Harry coughed, trying to clear his throat and make it a little less croaky. “I can’t pick it up.” The cough didn’t work, he still sounded
Harry sagged slightly, taking a bite from his beef, and chewed slowly. How were they supposed to get rid of him, as a horcrux, when no one except Voldemort could kill him?
“Well, yes. If this person is a prisoner, then they’re not on the Dark Lord’s side. They could probably be a powerful ally, if only we knew who it was. The potion doesn’t control minds, does it?”
“You’re beautiful,” Harry breathed, his green eyes lit up as he leaned down, kissing his way up to Draco’s ear.
, likely to try and assert his dominance. It seemed to work on most people, but Narcissa noted this weakness.
“You did.” Harry smirk softened as he reached out with a napkin and wiped away the gravy from Draco’s mouth with his thumb, waving it in front of the blonde’s face.
Harry picked up Scorpius to swing his legs of the bed, setting him back down as he pulled on his slippers and a robe over his pyjamas.
“Butterbeers okay?” Hannah asked, going to get the first round. The rest all headed to a large, round booth towards the back that seated ten and could all see out of the booth at varying angles. It was a wonder it hadn’t been taken yet.
Finally finishing the transfiguration essay, he rolled it up and shoved it into his bag, before pulling out a fresh piece of parchment.
Potter — well, the potion was there, so he couldn’t die. That’s the end of that. Even if Voldemort would be much more comfortable having the boy in his dungeons, he couldn’t do
“Whether or not you know of a brewing room here, since Walburga would have been your…” Hermione turned to Severus, “Grandmother?”
Harry smiled against Draco’s skin, his face now against Draco’s neck. Draco felt a spike of panic as that smile fell, but quickly calmed as Harry said “I don’t - I don’t want to go any further tonight.”
“Eloquent as always, Potter. No, don’t close your eyes, we have stuff to do.” Snape sneered, albeit half–heartedly.
“I brought your cloak” Draco said, once again looking into green eyes with a severe sense of déja vu. They were as earnest as they were in the library.
The goblet was safe in the vault. He knew that the Black vaults were one of the most well–guarded family vaults in Gringotts, and he was
Draco took three deep breaths before opening the door to their room. He wondered what Hermione had said - but then again, that girl was terrifying. She probably threatened him.
Harry thought. The clock on his wall revealed it was twelve on the dot - Harry was surprised Kreacher had let him skip breakfast, the elf was normally insistent on regular meals. Even though he wasn’t particularly hungry, Harry headed down the stairs - the stew did smell pretty good.
at the door, just in case. He held his wrist over the sink, staring at it. Did he really want to do this? Was this the correct decision? But then green light flared at the back of his mind, coming out of
didn’t want to think about - his father was a right idiot for following the Dark Lord). In third year, it had taken five attempts for Potter to see his fainting act, which had been pure gold.
He padded down into the dungeons, creeping even as he knew that his footsteps were silent to any listener with human ears. You could never be too careful.
” Draco said more forcefully, faltering at the end at the look in the muggle’s eyes. He wouldn’t be able to do this, he knew it. And clearly, his father knew too.
She walked upstairs on silent feet as they were dismissed, and considered leaving then and there. Without Draco coming back, there was nothing keeping her tied here.
Harry woke up a little stiff, but well rested, to Draco sitting on the bed beside him, reading some old dusty parchment.
“Come on, get into bed, you skinny git. I bet you haven’t had any dinner either.” Potter shook his head, and Draco rolled his eyes. “I’ll get Granger and the Weasel to bring you some food.” He turned, but felt a spark of panic from Potter, and turned to face him. He was vigorously shaking his head, and repeatedly whispering “no”.
Draco melted, dropping the cloak and reaching out to touch Potter, to savour the moment if it wasn’t real.
“Well he’s safe now, and that’s all that — what is happening?” Hermione was looking off to Ron’s side, and he turned to see Dumbledore rocking back and forth slightly.
He opened it, surprised to see one Remus Lupin collapsed on the floor. He sighed, shook his head and levitated the unconscious man onto the sofa, before shouting for the girls to come downstairs. The twins continued to work at the shop during the day, despite the Ministry having fallen — then again, with their products surrounding them, there was likely nowhere safer. Ron and Hermione said they were somewhere safe, but couldn’t visit at the moment, but while he worried, Bill trusted them. Charlie had gone to Romania for reinforcements, whatever that meant. Fleur’s parents had gone back to France, since they weren’t fighters, and the rest of the order had scattered.
He’d been agonising about how to get the Weasley boy and the mudblood — while they were at Hogwarts, despite Dumbledore not being there, they were well protected, and he’d decided not to take any chances.
Remus woke with the summer sun — which was ridiculously early, because whoever invented daylight savings was a terrible person. He yawned and stretched, shuffling to the kitchen to make a pot of tea. Around halfway through boiling the water, he was overcome by a sudden fear of Molly storming down the stairs because he was in her kitchen, before realising;
On Monday, he didn’t even go to lessons. Draco said Harry was feeling a bit “under the weather” - this wasn’t a lie, but it wasn’t exactly the truth. He detested all the sympathetic glances thrown his way. By this point, Draco was biting at his fingernails - a nervous habit he’d never done before - not in sixth year, not when Voldemort was in his house, not when his father was in Azkaban.
Kingsley and Moody were the only two full members of the Order remaining in the Ministry. Everyone else had been fired or was in hiding. There were a few neutral aurors that were willing to help for something in exchange — usually time off — which allowed Kingsley to quietly thwart the death eaters efforts to catch muggleborns — when he heard about them. More and more often, they took it upon themselves to scour the country themselves, calling themselves ‘Snatchers’ and reaping the rewards when they brought some helpless unregistered witch or wizard into the Ministry. That was all it took to get arrested these days — if you weren’t on the official registers, you were immediately assumed to be muggleborn and arrested.
way of thinking…” Draco continued to mutter under his breath as he pulled Harry back onto unsteady feet and half–carried him to the bathroom.
“Probably something to do with one of Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw or Godric Gryffindor. It’s likely that it’s a small cup, but that could be in Hogwarts as well, we’re not sure. It could also be to do with the Gaunt family.”
“My Lord.” Draco’s father swept into a low bow - an image that still made Draco feel nauseated — but he followed suit, a whisper of silk telling him that his mother had done the same.
, which revealed an unnervingly high number of people, but they were far away. “This is probably keyed to allow my father’s blood in, and therefore me, but would you just put up some wards to warn us if someone comes?” Draco murmured quietly.
**okay so, in canon Nagini was supposed to be modelled after a Burmese Python, except they're not venomous. The largest venomous snake is the King Cobra, aka Ophiophagus hannah — so I mashed the names together make a new breed of snake, Python ophiophagus (Python is technically the genus, which according to taxonomy comes first) (yes ophiophagus is the genus of the king cobra but I'm lazy lmao)
Draco rolled his eyes and gave in to the incessant tugging, taking his arm back before following a grinning Harry out of the door. Draco grinned at the back of Harry’s head, proud of making him smile like that.
to slipping off Draco’s left shoulder, exposing all of his left collarbone and most of his right one, and all Harry could think about was running his tongue along it, leaving little bit marks as he went-
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, after three hours of not hearing anything from you, and after you didn’t answer when I almost hammered the door down, I figured that you’d either fallen asleep or died. The water was cold, so I put you in bed. Don’t worry,” he added, as Harry’s expression morphed into one of horror, “I didn’t
A shaft of light blinded Harry, who didn’t have glassed, but was rather just dressed in an oversized pair of boxers. As he blinked, he started to make out the large, red face of Vernon Dursley.
Now, he had information that there was to be a Weasley wedding, and that the mudblood was staying at the shack that the Weasleys all lived in. Hopefully there wouldn’t be many people there, but if Voldemort sent all of his followers there, they would be severely outnumbered. Now it was three days since the school term had finished, and a week and a half until the wedding, which meant that they would definitely be there, but no guests would have arrived yet.
She had to trust Severus. Trust the promise he’d made, to keep their son safe. Surely that was why he’d left, too — he wouldn’t blow his cover even for something like this, so it must have been Draco’s idea. They’d probably already made it to Severus’s home by now, and she didn’t think the Dark Lord knew about it…
Draco anxiously waited those two days, doing all of nothing apart from grating on Severus’ nerves by pacing around the room as their potions simmered. On the day of, he ran into Severus’ room an hour earlier than usual, to his displeasure, and spent two hours pacing and casting
, after all,” Draco drawled. They had completely ignored the subject since seeing Flitwick, but Draco didn’t see the point in calling Pot-
“We know umbrella charms, mate, we’ll be fine.” Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder and headed down to breakfast, Harry jogging to keep up while Hermione and Draco walked behind, murmuring about something or the other. Harry didn’t even try to find out what they’re talking about anymore - he knew from experience that generally it would just go straight over his head.
Instead of heading into the Great Hall, he power walked to the dorms. Walking in, he saw that the common room was empty - likely everyone was at dinner. He walked into his room and sat on his bed. They didn’t have any homework, yet, so he didn’t really have anything to do. He pulled the album Hagrid had given him out of his trunk, drew the curtain around his bed, and gently opened it.
“No, no — I can go in through the Forbidden Forest, the natural magic will interfere with the wards. If I’m wearing my invisibility cloak, I am practically undetectable, as long as I stick to the footpaths. And I know exactly where I’m going.”
As they walked into the hall, Draco froze in the doorway. Harry easily caught up with him and grabbed his arm, unceremoniously dragging him to the Gryffindor table.
- the sharp tang of citrus, likely from the soap (it was yellow, but Harry didn’t know what scent due to not using it) masking a softer, floral scent.
The boat bumped against the edge of the tiny island, and Harry got out before offering a hand to Dumbledore. The older man waved him off, exiting just as gracefully as he’d entered.
the type to feel guilty about everything that’s ever happened. He probably felt guilty for killing Voldemort.
. It turned out that she and Ginny had became fast friends in hiding, and that all six of the people who went out to find the cat hadn’t come back, and couldn’t be found despite the various search parties they’d sent out. However, some of the search parties had reported more masked death eaters on patrol in the corridors — at least two, maybe up to six. Nine death eaters against six students…they would barely have stood a chance.
” Hermione screeched, causing Severus to startle at his seat and Remus to come running out of the kitchen, wand raised.
Draco presented the plan, Harry supported it, and Hermione rolled her eyes before saying “he is only one man, after all; what could he possibly do?”
Lucius knelt, as did Narcissa, swallowing back bile as she did so, carefully occluding and avoiding the Dark Lord’s gaze. The role of a pure blood woman; don’t be seen, don’t be heard, don’t be noticed.
He and Ron had split the weight of the basket, each carrying one side of the handle. They all went out next to the lake, Hermione transfiguring a handkerchief in her pocket (who carries around handkerchiefs? Really? Draco didn’t do that unless he was wearing a suit with a breast pocket for the love of Merlin) into a picnic blanket big enough to seat all four of them. They spread the food out - sandwiches, pies, sausage rolls, chips, various vegetable sticks hummus (which both Harry and Ron turned their noses up at, but Draco and Hermione forced them both to have some anyway), cakes, and a jug of pumpkin juice that automatically refilled. They talked about everything and nothing - Harry and Ron were talking about quidditch, then lessons, then back to quidditch, while Draco and Hermione were talking about the benefits of using opals in healing potions. Really, Draco had been missing out on years of actual
“Harry, out with it. You have been out ‘studying’ every night for the last three weeks! Who are you shagging?”
“It’s been an entire week since I last fell asleep in the bath, and I’m feeling way too antsy for the balcony. Anyway, I’ve got a functional magical core—”
Harry jolted upright in bed, breathing heavily and shaking like a leaf. He curled in on himself, summoning his wand to reinforce the silencing charm before rocking back and forth, pulling his blanket tightly around him, breath shuddering.
“We have no information regarding him. The information we do have tells us that the Ministry are after us, and anyone can break through these wards. We have to think strategically — defend our home base before going on the offensive.” Ron’s voice was gentle as he lightly squeezed Hermione’s knee.
“You haven’t been dating this entire time?” By this point, everyone nearby - including the teachers at the table - were tuned into the conversation.
“Draco was damn good too,” Dean said. Draco’s eyebrows rose in surprise, climbing further still when the rest of the class murmured in agreement.
Harry rolled his eyes and left. Draco used the toilet, washed his face and brushed his teeth, walking out just as Harry pulled his jumper on. “All yours.” Draco gestured to the bathroom, not looking at Harry as he walked over to his bed, casting an ironing charm on his uniform that he’d left out the day before. He turned to make sure Harry left the room - a pointless endeavour, since Harry had already seen him in his underwear - before quickly changing. He was combing his hair as Harry walked out, glamours already in place.
Draco sighed irritably and shoved his hand into Harry’s pocket, his fingers like ice against Harry’s. When Harry looked at him questioningly, he rolled his eyes.
- When Li went to Hogwarts, Harry got antsy, having gotten used to at least one kid running around the house, and finally went up to Godric’s Hollow and refurbished his parent’s home.
But first, he had to put up some wards around the Burrow. Since he had a Dark Mark, he could use the ambient magic around it to key the wards to specifically repel anyone who had one. It wouldn’t keep them safe from
Draco sighed and easily sliced the knife across his right palm, before raising his eyebrows expectantly at Harry. Harry’s eyes were clouded as he held out his left hand, but he didn’t wince as the knife was dragged across his palm. He
Harry’s eyes widened fractionally, before realising this was Hermione - nothing got past her. “I’m not shagging anyone, just studying.” He dumped his potions essay that he’d copied off Malfoy on the table in front of the sofa Ron and Hermione had been cuddling on.
Although, in a way, these were his new family — the Weasleys seemed to have a habit of taking in strays. Harry and Hermione, himself, even the Slytherins had been accepted, and they moved around each other as if they’d been side by side for years.
After the Battle, he’d felt hollow and empty. He’d felt pressured to start a ‘normal’ life with Ginny - but that had fizzled out within a week. After that, he hadn’t really known what to do with himself - just drifted around Grimmauld, dutifully showing up at the Burrow under glamours.
his plate and cutlery before going upstairs, getting dressed and climbing into bed, softly smiling at how Harry relaxed at Draco’s magic. It was nice to see at least
hilarious,” Draco drawled, popping another piece of chicken in his mouth, and smirked at the indecipherable grumble and the bright–red ears sticking out from either side of the parchment.
He said goodbye to Ron and Hermione, who had their arms around each other’s shoulders and were heading towards the common room - Harry felt like going outside for a bit, and definitely didn’t feel like talking to anyone.
“We’re friends.” Harry glared at the other boy. Draco’s heart jumped at the sight of it, at the righteous anger rippling gently through the bond. Granger just raised an eyebrow at Harry.
“They’ve got a flat over their shop, but they can also come here if they need. Ginny? Are you okay?” Bill asked.
“Okay.” Harry smiled - a soft, cautious thing, but a smile nonetheless. Draco smiled back - a broad smile, one that he hoped conveyed his relief that Harry was willing to talk to him, and out of bed.
for him. He was mostly the one who made sure that Severus ate, between potions, and tried to strike up conversation — Draco and Hermione tried too, and Harry, once he’d started helping in the basement, but it was different, talking to  someone his own age. They really needed another adult in the house while Remus wasn’t there — Severus always forgot to eat, while in the midst of potions making, and genuinely didn’t know if the kids ate while he was down there. Probably not — they had
He yelled “Draco?”, already moving to the bathroom. He pounded on the door, and tried to open it to no avail - he tried an
Draco dragged his eyes away to see Pansy and Blaise arguing, while Millie rolled her eyes and sipped at her drink. Draco mirrored her, a warm feeling spreading inside his chest as he sat with his friends, the back of his mind still thinking of those green eyes, the split second they’d been on his.
- and Draco was kissing him back, with lips softer and more inviting than Ginny’s ever were, hands first cupping Harry’s face, then clutching his shoulders, then his long, slender fingers were running through Harry’s hair.
Not until he’d just passed them, and heard a whispered tripping jinx. He fell in an undignified heap, and was then petrified and levitated into an empty classroom.
curses he was controlling — he controlled the top five, which each controlled five of their own, and so on. Most of the ministry departments had two infiltrators — if he could just get to the blasted aurors, he could easily take over. He sent another message down to take over the aurors, and stalked down the worn, stone steps.
working up the courage to perhaps, maybe, possibly, put his arm around Hermione while she was reading, when Walburga’s screeching made him fall off the sofa. He and Hermione exchanged a worried glance, before sprinting down the stairs, hexes on the tips of their tongues.
Draco mentally recoiled. It was a huge, black void, and everything seemed to be getting pulled into it. The rope even appeared to be straining, attempting to pull into the void. This wasn’t a mind. This was...despair. Desolation.
fuck off until you tell me what’s going on so I can tell Pansy and Millie and Theo and take the piss out of you for the next three weeks.”
“They probably already went back, and if they haven’t they’ll be fine. They’re old enough to look after themselves.”
Ron and Hermione exchanged a glance. “That’s fine by us. Can you bring him up with your magic, somehow?”
crush on Harry — maybe something more — based on the longing looks when Harry’s head was turned, how he encouraged Harry to eat a few more bites, how his gaze flickered down and back up again, sometimes. Harry was just as bad, and Severus found it
They all reached the Hall in record time; it was practically empty, excluding a few eager Hufflepuffs, and some Ravenclaws who were reading, and likely hadn’t moved since lunch.
Ron suddenly stood up, his face bright red, spluttering. Hermione thumped him on the back, wondering how, exactly, she liked
What if Draco didn’t want to see him? He hadn’t taken well to Harry putting himself in dangerous situations before, and now Harry had made Draco literally
Harry didn’t wait for an answer, but unscrewed the top of the bruise salve and took a small quantity onto his fingers. His fingers, featherlight, rubbed the salve into Draco’s cheekbone, green eyes staring into his the entire time. After one cheek Harry moved onto his other cheek, and jaw, before moving onto his shoulders, his arms, his waist. Nobody had done this for Draco since...he was five, or so, and he’d been bitten by one of the peacocks. His mother had sat him down in the kitchen and applied dittany, then bruise salve, and then they’d had hot cocoa.
“I’m not going to actually see you for…a long while, I hope. We’re going to the house now, though; I don’t know what I’m going to do there, but it’ll be nice to see it.” Harry felt the Stone appear in his pocket and frowned slightly, willing it away. It appeared when he was at his most vulnerable; he’d only given into the temptation once. “I know you’ll be there in spirit — I don’t need some stone to feel it. Love you.”
Draco thought about what he wanted to send down the bond - he settled on “git”. He thought about the word, about shouting it, before bundling those thoughts and shooting it down the bond. Then he pulled out to gauge Harry’s reaction.
She’d quickly found Neville and Luna, and grabbed a compartment with Seamus and Dean. More than once, the Carrows had came by the compartment — apparently they were patrolling the train — but having not found any reason to punish them, they’d simply regaled them with tales of how they would be tortured when they got to school.
Taking deep breaths, he stood, quickly vanishing the contents of the toilet and rinsing his mouth out over the sink. He would be expected to kill muggles, or
She might have screamed, but her throat had closed up with terror. She watched in horror as Draco — and probably Severus — ducked below another two killing curses. She discreetly flicked her wand at Bellatrix and Rabastan, who’s curses immediately started going wide. She considered firing one at the Dark Lord, but the figures had disappeared around the corner. Satisfied they were safe, she cast two discrete
He went to his room, where he opened a book, looking for spells that he could use that would kill without him having to perform an unforgivable. The cutting curses were a strong choice — he could easily sever a major artery. He could just not look at the pools of blood. Never mind the fact that he was extremely squeamish. And the sound of muggles choking on their own blood — Draco sighed. He’d just have to learn how to cast a killing curse in — he cast a tempus — twelve minutes.
There were some nods around the room, and Severus and Remus shared identical faces of shock. Remus grimaced, trying to figure out what to say, but Severus nodded at him — a clear sign to tell the truth.
It did not, however, prevent Harry from the flashes of the dead in the Great Hall. This was so, so much worse than the corridors. Harry focused on keeping his breaths even, keeping his feet moving, following Ron and Hermione on the opposite side of the tables - it wouldn’t do for all three of them to be on the same side.
He’d grown up on fairy tales about soulmates - they always started with some made-up artefact, or spell which decidedly didn’t work, but it wasn’t those that had enraptured Draco. It had been the relationships - he’d always been a romantic (and always tried to hide it), and he’d always dreamed of having a soulmate. In his head it was a whirlwind romance - a brief, pure blood courtship, filled with flowers and presents, confirmed by a kiss under the stars. As he’d aged, he’d dreamed of being swept into Potter - no, Harry’s arms - Harry protecting him from Slytherin’s monster, from Black, being swept into Harry’s arms after one of his tasks in fourth year.
He stiffly stood up, testing his joints. He could walk well enough. He got his wand - miraculously not snapped - and cast some glamours over his face and body, that would make it appear that he was walking normally, before making his way to the dorms. There was no one in the common room, so he hastily walked into his room, almost colliding into Harry, who was pacing.
“I propose that we go in under polyjuice as high–ranking ministry officials, with hairs obtained when and where we can, and take as many documents as we can; at the very least, if there is no way to remove them, incinerate the documents with fiendfyre so they cannot be replicated. Everyone involved in the operation will carry portkeys which will take you to a neutral location in an emergency, which will be close to a safe house where you can apparats to. The safe house will be somewhere under a temporary fidelius for everyone to apparate to, just for the course of this operation, in case we need somewhere to hide for a day or two. Questions?” Everyone had listened raptly, and a few people raised their hands. Remus was surprised — he’d been to many Order meetings, and they often resulted in a shouting match. Never had everyone been so polite.
Thanks to regular meals, more healing and nutrition potions from Severus, and Draco’s presence, Harry begun to have more energy and put on weight, often reading various books in his free time. Hermione and Ron wouldn’t let him help with the research on horcruxes due to Draco’s presence, but he read some old stories, wizarding and muggle alike. Ron had been particularly eager to get him to read the Tales of Beedle the Bard, since it was what he’d grown up on — Harry had found the stories rather grim for young children, and had been particularly drawn to the Tale of Three Brothers, shooting glances at his trunk in the corner as he read about an invisibility cloak that sounded awfully familiar.
Tonks stuck to the opposite side of the corridor, discreetly clutching her wand and staring straight ahead, but it was of no use. As soon as Umbridge was within striking distance, she sent two hexes flying towards Tonks. She deflected them easily, the files creasing against her abdomen, and thought
. Severus shuddered — he knew what their favourite pastimes were. Harry needed to be out immediately.
— thank god Severus sent her straight to Madame Pomfrey with Crabbe) — and knew that there must have been many more he couldn’t.
“As interesting as it is, no. There is something, probably belonging to Rowena Ravenclaw, that we have to find. It would be small, easily concealable, and not very well known. Do you have any idea of what it could be?”
Harry’s mind-voice trailed off at the end, not sure what Draco was going to say. Surely he didn’t want people to think they were dating?
Bellatrix snarled, and Harry felt the cruciatus curse on him once again. Harry took deep breaths, deciding that this wouldn’t break him — it wasn’t even real.
Harry smirked, bringing up those feelings of competitiveness he’d lost - or abandoned - in sixth year. “Scared, Malfoy?”
least of all Draco! Where did you even come to that conclusion?” Harry flopped down into a comfy, battered armchair, stretching his hands and feet towards the fire - the library was
“I said I wasn’t hungry,” Draco murmured, tucking into the bread and stopping himself from groaning at the food - it had been four hours since he’d last eaten, and not very much at that - and while he was not hungry, you could never go wrong with some bread and butter.
— and carried her into the sitting room that they’d cleared out for working. He cleared all the paper from the sofa with a flick of his wand and gently set her down, before summoning a blanket and draping it over her.
Draco did eventually get up to get Harry a proper meal - he’d eaten a bit of the bread but he needed nutrition. The elves were all too happy to see him, giving him a basket too heavy to carry. He dragged it back up, and the pair ate about half of the food in their room. Harry, surprisingly, ate quite a lot - before, if he hadn’t eaten in a while he wouldn’t eat much, but now Draco was satisfied to see the effect of regular meals on his appetite.
“-a simple potion, but very easy to get wrong. Instructions are on the board.” Slughorn flicked his wand at the blackboard, upon which cramped, loopy handwriting suddenly appeared. “Do your worst!”
“I can’t make you do this.” Hermione looked desperately between Molly and Arthur. “There has to be another way.”
The four walked down, straight to the Hall. Harry, unthinkingly, pressed closer to Draco as they neared the doors - he didn’t get flashbacks any more, but he also wasn’t sure what to expect. Draco gently pressed a hand on the small of Harry’s back, probably not even thinking about it. But Harry was thinking about it - that hand was burning an imprint through Harry’s clothes, onto his scarred skin, his worldview narrowing to that singular point of contact. Harry continued to walk, all thoughts of the Hall emptying from his mind as he thought of Draco, of those little touches that meant so much to Harry. Harry didn’t realise he didn’t falter as he walked into the Hall until later that afternoon.
“They won’t listen to me. Come on, let’s get you back to Grimmauld — hopefully Kreacher has made something nice.”
Harry’s knees buckled as he took a step into Grimmauld Place. Draco grabbed him with an arm around his waist, but Harry could feel his muscles tremble slightly — clearly, the fight had taken a lot out of both of them.
“Well come out and have some food, at least.” Draco took a step away, towards the door which had swung shut behind him.
Having spent years doing research in the library, Hermione found that she was in her element; Ron, less so. He often found his mind wandering as he stared out of a window onto dreary London, wondering what the view would be from the Burrow, or what his parents would be doing, if they were alive…
“Yes of course,” Lucius hurriedly said, before sprinting down the hallway. Draco poked his head out — it was odd to see his ‘father’ so...dishevelled.
All this resulted in several rumours going around the school, the main one being that Draco had drugged Harry with a love potion. However, since Harry wasn’t exhibiting any symptoms that he was under the influence of a love potion (glazed eyes, obsession (or more so), or memory loss), this theory was quickly put to bed, and the student (and staff) body collectively decided that they were dating and just not ready to come out. Therefore, everyone left Draco and Harry alone, which they were quite happy about.
Harry reached out to the tendrils of magic that were rippling around his cuts and eased them away, leeching the dark away to leave the light, the uncorrupted power Voldemort had thrown at him under ghastly packaging.
, for Merlin’s sake! Looking at the little kids running around the school now, it made Harry feel sick to his stomach. Even the fourth years seemed titchy - that was when he’d seen Voldemort return. Looking back, he saw that he’d been manufactured into a weapon. Not that that hadn’t started with the Dursley’s - that recklessness demonstrated a lack of value for his own life.
Malfoy had assured him that he’d done the charm wrong, but Harry had been feeling odd emotions all day. An occasional spark of humour, a warm glow that attempted to penetrate the grief that he kept tightly wrapped around his heart for no one to see.
The Dark Lord lifted the Crucio, and turned to his still able followers. “Spinner’s End. Bring the traitors back.”
They sat on the bed, just like they had before, each happy to enjoy the moment in itself, without worrying about anything else.
more and more often in his mind, which he found disconcerting. He did not, however, appreciate the knowing glances Severus and Remus shot him whenever he took some food from a meal up to Potter.
He hadn’t stopped walking until he’d thrown himself onto his bed, wordlessly flicking his wand to pull the drapes around his bed, the green reminding him of Potter, Potter’s eyes, Potter’s lips.
“Finally awake, Potter? No reason to worry — just keying these two into the gate so that I don’t have to keep coming down here every time you need food.” Lucius sniffed, as if Harry was something on the bottom of his shoe.
“I’m fine here, really. I’m keeping myself occupied, and I’ve got Kreacher - you remember how much better he got? He’s taking care of me.” The words did their trick, as the worry lines on Hermione’s face softened and she smiled.
Everyone had been annoyingly worried about her in the two days leading up to her going to Hogwarts, which wasn’t surprising, but it was extremely irritating. She was stressed enough as it was, and certainly didn’t need everyone walking on eggshells around her. She put up with it, though — she saw how much it helped everyone, if she reassured everyone five times a day that “yes, I’m okay, yes, I’m sure I want to do this, no, I don’t want to send Ron under polyjuice.”
There was no echo, meaning Harry at least got the message. However, all Draco got for his efforts was silence. Slightly wounded, but not disheartened, Draco said
Harry pulled away reluctantly, staring into those grey eyes and ignoring the whoops and cheers coming from many of his classmates.
“Well either you’re shagging Malfoy or you’ve got the Snape’s seventh year book, which seems unlikely since we went to Diagon Alley to get all our books together. You haven’t been this good at potions since sixth year, and since you’re not coming to me for help the only other person who’s any good at potions is Malfoy - not to mention that you’ve been sitting next to him in classes and you’re calling him Draco.”
Harry was sitting upright on his bed, and gave Draco a weak smile. Draco gave him a full one in return, taking long strides across the room and practically launching himself onto Harry’s bed.
“Well, he’ll definitely need this, then. At least, to get out of the Manor. We don’t know the size of his magical core—”
Harry thought - the two had got together straight after the Battle. Harry made a mental note not to go into their room unless it was absolutely necessary.) However, Harry couldn’t find his name...until he got to the very bottom of the list.
The first time Harry drifted into consciousness, an ice cold hand held him in a vice-like grip. Or that’s how it felt, anyway; was it like this before he’d woken up? Suddenly he was trembling from the cold, desperately closing his eyes. The floor beneath him was softer than it had been in the cell, but he felt like he was back in there, because really, it couldn’t be this cold anywhere else.
“We…” the twins exchanged glances, before looking at Ron and Hermione, and then at their parents. “There must be another way.”
in Latin. Ron tried to relax and just let his magic flow out of him, gritting his teeth as his knees threatened to buckle. Still, he let the magic flow, occasionally sneaking glances at the beautiful girl beside him.
, Draco thought. Maybe if they’d put more effort into looking out for him he wouldn’t be in the state he was, hiding in their room.
He’d been very disappointed in himself yesterday, as he ate a bit of bread and drank some water. Apparently he wasn’t as self destructive as he’d thought. The good news was that the cut on his thigh was definitely infected — when Lucius had visited he’d noticed in the light that not only was it very swollen, but it was oozing a horrid white substance. Thankfully, Lucius hadn’t noticed, as Harry strategically drew his legs up to hide the front of his thighs.
Flitwick came over and swiftly erected a silencing charm before squeaking “Boys! Since you already have a bond, I’d like you to test it - try communicating using it, perhaps.” With that, he removed the charm with a flick of his wand and moved on to question another pair.
Despite his annoyance at Draco’s attitude, he obeyed his orders, retrieving an untarnished silver cauldron from the back of the classroom (he was terrible at potions but he
Harry felt a pang of disappointment — it had been over a week since he’d seen Remus — before remembering that Severus had mentioned Yorkshire. They’d decided to work from London outwards, since that was where the Ministry was based, and Yorkshire was towards the north of the country — quite a distance from London. “How’s all that going, with the muggleborns? Yorkshire’s quite far from London, isn’t it?”
“Because Fred...and there’ll be too many people...and you won’t be there…” Harry stiffened at the last statement, but relaxed again as Draco moved his thumb against Harry’s arm.
“When I died, in the forest, I saw Dumbledore. I don’t know whether it was the afterlife or a figment of my imagination, but I got the option to...to not come back. Sometimes I think maybe I should have taken it.”
Sorry I’m posting later than usual, I’ve had a shit tonne of work and forgot to do the editing last night so I’ve just done it (oops)
powerless; if all of Voldemort’s attention was on him, his friends could get out. The sounds of their battle were getting further away, which meant they’d be able to get out.
“So then, boys and girls, what is the topic of conversation today?” Blaise gestured grandly before clapping his hands together and rocking back on his chair.
Harry knew it was bad to rely on Draco so heavily - but while he was getting better, it couldn’t hurt, could it?
Harry sighed. Well, it wasn’t anything he hadn’t already thought about. But he definitely had to get into Hogwarts.
That’s what they both did, Draco listening to Harry’s breaths slow and even out. Eventually, when he was truly asleep, Draco made to get up, but Harry grumbled and threw his arm over Draco.
Harry, while at Hogwarts, had suppressed any and all thoughts of the Dursleys. He never let anyone see him shirtless, and hadn’t been particularly fond of Ron pinching food from his plate in first year, but overall he had been quite sure that no one at Hogwarts knew about his situation.
“Magicorae revelium,” he murmured, moving his wand in a weird corkscrew motion, before pulling it away from Harry, towards his abdomen. At the abrupt jerking motion, Harry felt the ball of warmth — his core — moving outwards slightly, while still remaining inside. Like a shadow of it passed outside. He looked down, and his eyes widened in surprise at the sight of the threads of magic, pulsing gently in a sphere around the size of his fist. They were in every colour — rich scarlets, bright purple, shimmering blues and greens all weaving in and out of a bright sphere of light.
Harry wasn’t sure of how long he’d been left alone in the cell. There were no windows, and no structure, so Harry just spent his days staring at the bars. They weren’t perfectly even, but none of the gaps were large enough to slip through, making the information effectively useless.
the Boy–Who–Lived. At the very least, they could split the potion between the two of them so they were both weakened, but not to a horrendous amount. Then he remembered what he’d turned around to do.
Harry and Hermione hurried to catch up with him, the trio walking side by side down the corridors. Harry looked around, not associating any of the corridors with the Battle. In fact, the corridors looked better than they had in years - the stone was gleaming (as much as stone could, anyway), the torches were burning cheerfully, and there was no evidence of any destruction. Harry almost thought he could get through the year.
It turned out that one of the aurors had originally worked in the archives, and still had contacts there. He knew that Umbridge had taken some files into her office, but the majority would still be there. The archives were huge, but most of it was tracking crimes and finances, so they estimated five people with satchel bags to shrink and place documents in, maximum, plus two more — one for fighting, and one to sneak into Umbridge’s office, as Umbridge, and remove the additional files from there.
I know this isn’t very long and I’m probably being over dramatic I’m just going to say a few thank you’s anyway:
Exactly fifteen minutes after they’d left, a peacock appeared and said in Lucius’ voice. “We’ve got the children. On our way back.”
got to grind up the pretty ingredients while Harry got leach juice under his fingernails, Harry took the knife and started chopping without complaint.
“Disappearing potion - this can be added to any object and it will disappear for a certain amount of time, depending upon the quality of the potion, reappear in in the same location afterwards. You will need; three leeches, three hundred grams of moonstone-“
They went to the Burrow and asked Ginny, who said there was no way Harry was getting into Hogwarts. The only way in and out was with someone who had a Dark Mark — apparently they held it up to the wards, which allowed them through. There were death eaters patrolling the corridors, and no one left to help Harry if he got stuck — even Filch said he was leaving for Christmas. And all of the secret passages —
After making sure that Harry was asleep, Draco went back downstairs, to see Hermione magically altering Narcissa and Severus’ features. Narcissa looked exactly like Bellatrix, although with a softer expression than Draco was used to — but the sight of his Aunt still made him shudder. Severus’ hair had been shortened, and his nose was now upturned and dainty. A couple more flicks of Hermione’s wand removed his wrinkles, and it was surprising how just three changes could change a person so much. Severus would be unrecognisable, were it not for his robes. A quick flick of Hermione’s wand had them fitted and a deep purple, after Draco pointed out how distinctive they were. Severus glared at Draco, but accepted the changes.
He shook himself from his daydreaming and focused on walking to the common rooms. He’d had defence this morning, in which he and Harry hadn’t acknowledged each other by anything other than a nod of the head, and runes, which had been interesting as usual. He had a free lesson and then lunch, and was planning on staying in his room for both.
Snape refused to give him any information regarding what was happening at the manor. He really didn’t want to go back - it was good that his father was out of prison, meaning the summer would perhaps be slightly more bearable than Easter, except he didn’t have Hogwarts to look forward to in September. Now that he was a death eater, he didn’t have the refuge of seventh year. It was just living with the Dark Lord. Until Potter defeated him. Hopefully.
He didn’t get a reply, so he continued hammering on the door. The panic and nausea didn’t decrease, so he grabbed one of his calming potions before storming in, and stopped in his tracks as Potter turned to face him.
He backed up, into a stack. It shifted, and then stilled — and then a chair that had been perched precariously on top fell to the floor with a crash.
“Charlie’s off in Romania, so he might recruit some people, or at the very least, get us some supplies.” Bill frowned. “Still, the numbers are low.”
“Where are you going to wear that?” Draco raised an eyebrow at the scandalous dress. “Your parents would never let you take it to a ball or a gala.”
“Lucius.” The Dark Lord looked positively murderous. His skin had grown paler — a waxy yellow in the moonlight — and his eyes glowed dangerously red. “I thought your son didn’t know about the prisoner.”
Thirdly, I wrote this back at the very start of September and actually haven’t written since. I’ve got exams next week, university applications in October if I get decent predicted grades, more exams in November, and genuinely have no idea when I’m going to be able to write, so there probably won’t be a posting schedule for the last 5 chapters (it genuinely irritates be so much how few hours there are in the day)
Draco glared at Severus. It likely didn’t get his point across, since he was sitting on the floor, hugging his knees and shivering.
She took a deep breath, tears lining her eyes, and nodded. “This is war. We have to do what we need to, and we’re not staying there anyway. If we spend the next couple of days clearing it out…it should be fine.”
They spent the rest of the day brewing generic healing potions — they’d generally get rid of mild diseases and infections, and speed up the healing of most injuries.
“Just be glad that we didn’t have to battle tonight. You’re good at duelling, but terrible at being a death eater, and the longer you keep that hidden, the better.”
He didn’t lie there for long before being dragged down into a dream, remembering that he’d forgotten to occlude a moment too late.
Harry and Draco followed the sprinting kids at a more leisurely pace, holding hands. They entered the chaotic house, Harry barely even flinching at the wall of noise that greeted them. Children from ages two to eight (Teddy also came during holidays, but was currently in his second year of Hogwarts and at school for another week) ran around their legs, and Harry and Draco were greeted with hearty claps to the shoulder and hugs from various people.
Everyone tucked in, mouths full of food and inane conversation flying around. Harry relaxed slightly now that the interrogation was over, very aware of the other end of the bond. Draco didn’t appear to be feeling anything - he was probably reading, or doing homework, Harry reasoned. There were no feelings of fear or dread coming through, so Harry tried his best to eat a full meal. Whenever he knew no one was looking at him, he slipped a piece of bread and a packet of butter into his pocket.
He pulled the covers up to his chin, staring blankly at the wall. Maybe Vernon was right - it was Saturday, he should be outside, with his friends, having a great time, but instead he was just lying in bed.
At breakfast the next day, Draco honestly couldn’t help but sit facing the Gryffindor table, watching Potter with the same intensity that he used to. He didn’t notice Pansy sitting next to him until she waved a hand in front of his face, yelling in his ear. Draco turned his head to pull a face at her.
- the dark mark was faded, but still there. Before, he hadn’t had a big issue with it - it was just a tattoo, a bad mistake of his youth, one he had come to terms with - but now he wanted it
at the youngest child without a glance. Draco flinched backwards, trying to think of a way to end the unforgivable without actually attacking Lucius. The most humane thing Draco could think of was killing the girl — but he couldn’t do that. Could he?
Hermione turned to see him, but instead of the happy expression Harry had expected, her face was drawn and all blood leached from her his skin.
, Hermione thought grudgingly. “The Order of the Phoenix is basically our side that fights against Voldemort.”
He turned his head back to Ron and Hermione as Malfoy’s head turned towards his, before he could be caught staring. Ron was happily talking about the Cannon’s chances in the league this year, but Hermione gave him an odd look.
Draco glared at Harry, while he smirked. He’d expected a bigger reaction from Draco yesterday when he’d called him Draco, rather than almost nothing - he hadn’t missed the flash of shock on his face. Nothing like the unbridled shock when Harry had successfully conjured a non-verbal patronus (an expression that Harry had very much enjoyed).
room, more than the one at the manor had ever been. He sighed, pulling the corners of his mouth into a neutral expression and cast one last look around the room. The green drapes, the ripples of cyan light the lake sent across the room - Draco would miss it all. He’d even miss the initial spurt of cold water from the showers, the chills that rippled through his body when the fire went out.
The four of them apparated to the Weasley’s, Harry and James landing squarely in the middle of the path while Draco and Scorpius narrowly avoided the muddy pit just off the track.
Something indecipherable flickered across Severus’ face before he continued. “True love has the power to override the bond, although I’m not sure about removing it,” he sneered, “but even if there was a less lethal way to remove it, Miss Granger, I would advise against it. Potter would likely die without it — at least, before his magical core heals. The best thing to start with would be to find out how to do spells to monitor Potter’s vitals, magical core, and start brewing more healing potions. I brought as much as I could with me, of course, but we’ll need to start brewing as soon as possible.”
He watched Lucius stalk out of the room, the two children floating behind him. He’d question them under veritaserum, then kill them. Lucius could get rid of the bodies afterwards.
The end of Draco’s wand glowed a faint green, but the spider didn’t even flinch. Just sat there in its web, taunting him.
The first page was of his mum and dad at a fountain. They looked similar to Ron and Hermione now - not in looks, but rather in their body language, the way they looked at each other, barely sparing a glance at the camera.
Never mind the fact that he’d caught Potter staring at him more than once - it was always with a vacant expression, and Draco knew how prone Potter was to daydreaming. It couldn’t possibly be about him.
“This place isn’t exactly secret — the death eaters will likely check here as soon as they’re dressed.” As if they were summoned, a series of cracks sounded from outside of the door. Harry tried to sit up and look around — he was still too weak to do anything other than flop on the floor like a wet fish — but gathered they were in a house, with slightly rotted floorboards.
He started counting the specks of grease, to try and distract himself from the ever–present sensation of an invisible knife, carving ever deeper. He half expected to see pools of blood, should he look, even though he knew all he would say is the gradual fading of the mark.
He kept running back and forth between the toaster and the bacon, trying his best to make sure it didn’t burn. It wasn’t cooked, not yet, just a little longer - until there was smoke everywhere, a blackened mess in the pan. Harry couldn’t understand how it could have happened - he’d been so careful, watching the bacon within thirty-second intervals, but it was burned, and there was no way to fix it, and Vernon was shouting, and Petunia was screaming, and Dudley was fake-crying while smiling maliciously whenever his parent’s backs were turned…
Now he could breathe again, and he was somewhere…unfamiliar. The area where the little ball of warmth had resided — the one that had grown cold three days ago — didn’t quite feel so cold. Even as the painful magic tried to brush against his skin, the other one — the warm one — created a shield around his body.
“Close to forty hours. I think you came close to waking up a couple of times, but the thing with the pensieve and Kreacher must have really tired you out.”
Then they were all hugging and crying in the back garden of Grimmauld place, with the hope that maybe, they would all get through this after all.
Ron grimaced. “Sorry, mate.” He walked back to the corner that he’d been leaning on, and Hermione walked over. She stopped right next to the bed, and shot him a questioning look. Harry was surprised to not feel anything other than a light tingle, but it certainly wasn’t the warmth of Draco’s magic.
“What’s up with all the sudden PDA?” Dean asked, as Draco kissed Harry on his temple for passing the pumpkin juice.
Taken up in the conversation, Draco almost forgot to bow as Voldemort exited the room. He waited until Severus had erected silencing wards and charms to alert them when someone was going to enter the room before loosing a breath.
The boy scrambled as Voldemort appeared with a crack. The idiot didn’t have his wand — it was at Voldemort’s feet. He picked it up, relishing the puff of smoke that came as he snapped the wand. At this point the boy shuffled backwards, looking for...something. Voldemort would have let the inferi get him, but he needed to know who else knew — regardless of the pain of being in Potter’s mind.
Draco wasn’t the absolute worst, surprisingly. He took her insults with good grace, and was a good loser in duels, which wasn’t often, but he certainly took his losses with more grace than Ron. And the amount that he cared for Harry…certainly, anyone who cared for Harry
The next page was their wedding. Next to Harry’s parents was Sirius, arm in arm with Remus. In fact, they also looked like a couple - how had Harry never noticed before? He cast a silencing charm before moving his gaze, tears pricking his eyes.
Draco had been concerned for most of the day that Potter was missing, however Granger and the Weasel didn’t appear too bothered so he didn’t fully panic until Potter wasn’t at the Halloween feast. He had wolfed down his dinner and near sprinted down to the kitchens, claiming he ‘felt unwell’ to the rest of the Slytherins. They didn’t appear to question it at the table, but he knew he would be in for a grilling in the common room.
Draco sighed and rolled over and propped himself up on his elbow. Blaise wouldn’t give up, and Draco really couldn’t be arsed to hex him. “I kissed Potter.”
He turned and nodded at Remus and Fleur, who both took three steps forward. Remus smiled as he turned to Severus. “Yep, they’re definitely there. Now you try — if you can’t get in, we’ll know they’ve worked.”
“Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else finding out about this,” Harry said apologetically. He handed the flask to Ron. “See if you can see what was in the basin — it’s important.”
Draco had raised his wand again, and Harry nearly sagged in relief, before he saw his stare of horror and realised that he was being controlled similar to how Harry was. Harry tried his best to make it easy for Draco, trying his best not to flinch at the green light, but in his last moments of consciousness as he fell he couldn’t help but worry about Draco - what would happen to him, what would Voldemort do, knowing that he’d had to control Draco?
before lighting a fire underneath and heating up the water with a heating charm to speed up the process.
He had seemed relieved when the elf stopped him from answering Draco’s question, his shoulders sagging and his eyes dimming slightly. It seemed he had no answer anyway. He also didn’t seem to have the presence of mind to question what Draco was doing in the kitchens, which was good because Draco
Harry looked around the common room. It was similar to the Gryffindor one, if a little smaller - comfy armchairs scattered around a rectangular room, rather than circular, with a different colour scheme - probably so all the houses felt equally uncomfortable. The room was monotone with purple accents. It should have looked cold, but the fire was burning cheerfully and cast comforting shadows around the room. Harry didn’t feel at home, exactly, but he was...comfortable. He really wanted to go into his room and stare at the grey canopy above his bed, but with the feast that wasn’t an option.
” Draco said, before allowing Harry to drag him around a corner into the corridor, hastily erecting a silencing charm and pinning him against the wall, kissing him and grinding his hips against Draco’s.
None of the corridors they went down particularly stood out in Harry’s memory, so he was quite calm, and proud of himself. The dorms were on the fifth and sixth floor, but the entrance was on sixth with the girls’ dorms being downstairs. There was a sheet up with all of the room assignments - two people per room. There didn’t seem to be any Slytherins back - Hermione was rooming with Lavender Brown, the Patil twins were together, Ron was with Neville, Seamus was with Dean (
They quickly realised that they wouldn’t be able to have regular meetings with the DA like they did in two years ago, what with two Carrows patrolling the school as well as Umbridge as the head, but agreed to spread the word about the Room of Requirement. As long as the person using it closed the loopholes — making it impenetrable to anyone loyal to Umbridge or You–Know–Who would work — it was an easy place to keep safe. Since the Hufflepuff common room was right next to the kitchens, they could ask the elves to go to the Room to deliver food with only a small chance of being caught by the Carrows.
Professor MacDougal was relatively young for a teacher, and wasn’t completely taken by Harry, who was relieved. He was quite short and bouncy - not as much as Flitwick, but he still had plenty of energy. He spent the lesson lecturing, assuring them that they would be doing practical work next week. Harry spent the lesson dutifully copying Hermione’s notes, and not thinking about what he was going to do next week, when they were practicing duelling. At least it wasn’t for another week - the Professor wanted them to spend a double lesson doing practical work, and the next two lessons were not. This lesson was blessedly boring, and while they were doing in-depth analysis of duelling techniques, Harry got through the lesson just fine.
Voldemort whispered again, lips right next to Draco’s ear. Draco shook his head again, lowering his shaking hand down. He
He thought about what he wanted in a partner, and considered if they were male - despite his revelation, he always fantasised about girls, mostly because they were considered ‘normal’ and that’s what he wanted - to be normal, with a normal life, kids and a back garden and a dog, or a crup.
Harry yawned, as it was past midnight, and fell asleep, vaguely aware that the shirt was so soft it felt like he wasn’t wearing a shirt anyway.
“Okay, so, when I was in the DA in fifth year — we were a club, of sorts, to learn defensive magic when Umbridge refused to teach us — we used charmed galleons to communicate when our next meeting was. I used the protean charm and connected it to mine, and then I changed the numbers around the edge to correspond to a date and time for the next meeting. If we did something similar, for certain members — so one at Hogwarts, one for each group of people, or so to speak — and added more wards and stuff, we’d have a reliable way to communicate. I thought of journals, but they would run out quickly, if everyone was writing, so I thought of a handheld chalkboard or muggle whiteboard, where there would be a charm so only certain people could see it, and then have dates and communicate in a safer, faster, more reliable method than owls. We could also charm muggle mobile devices to work around magic — they have biometric scanners, and passcodes, but I don’t know how easily everyone would adapt to it.” Everyone’s faces were a mixture of admiration and confusion, and Hermione sighed. “I have some ideas for instant communication, rather than using owls, that wouldn’t be able to be intercepted. I’ll bring some prototypes on Friday.”
Hermione sprung to her feet, already moving to the window. “Oh, that’ll be the reply from Bill and Fleur.”
He still got nightmares - mostly of being forced to torture other people, while his parents were held at wandpoint - and he woke up sweaty and with his heart racing, but when he’d asked the elves they’d said he didn’t make any noise and his nightmares didn’t tend to invade his day.
“It’s just...I’ve always suppressed those memories as much as possible while at Hogwarts. Suppressing them...it allows me to live life freely. But I think now, I’m just suppressing too much. It doesn’t...they won’t stay down.”
of Bellatrix’s heels against the stone floor growing ever louder as she walked down the steps. He suddenly realised —
Flying around the room, at a rather leisurely given the situation, he looked for that familiar flash of blonde hair. On the second loop, he spotted him - perched precariously on a chair on top of a stack, his posture surprisingly relaxed. “Took you long enough,” he drawled, allowing Harry to swing him onto the back of the broom, his nonchalant tone of voice betrayed by the tenseness of his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry looked for the door, decidedly not concentrating on how Draco was pressed flush against his back, not concentrating on Draco’s breath tickling his ear, not concentrating on the rising temperature. After what seemed like an age, he spotted the little door, spelling it open and tumbling out.
. They were good fighters, but he had armies now, and it was important to get the children while they were young.
Just as Draco was thinking, he was surprised by a booming “PRAT” echoing around his skull in Harry’s voice. Trust him to shout into his skull, giving him a headache.
She held in her sigh of relief as the death eaters came back, reporting that they’d apparated away, and they couldn’t trace where they’d gone other than that it was in London. Likely a building under the fidelius, they said.
“Sometimes you have to break the law to uphold the law. Back me up, Harry.” Ron elbowed Harry, who was staring at Draco with a forgotten forkful of mash raised halfway to his mouth.
“Hermione, can I walk on the weird water?” Ron yelled. Hermione, who was still examining the wall, shrugged. “Give it a go, nothing can happen to you, this is just a memory.”
“Hogwarts…I’ve been watching you since first year. Always thought you were ‘up to something’, you see. And today… not
However, walking into the room where the eighth years had been told to floo in, Draco started to really doubt the sanity of his decision. The room was chock full of Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors, all of whom glared at him as he walked through the room. While it was jarring to be so alone, to stand out so much, Draco purposefully kept his head held high and his back ramrod-straight as he walked through the room. He walked down the corridors, noting that there was no evidence that any Battle had taken place. The volunteers had really done their jobs well.
Draco shuddered and nodded his assent. Harry quickly returned with two tumblers, each with two fingers of dark caramel coloured liquid.
a little voice in Harry’s head told him, but he barely heard it as he watched Draco squirm beneath him - his hair was a mess, his cheeks were flushed and it was doing terrible things to Harry’s mind. Finally, Draco was on his back, apparently where he wanted to be since he stopped moving. Harry intended to move, but he was too busy staring into Draco’s eyes, the silver almost swallowed by dark, dilated pupils. Their breath was mingling, as Harry was still supporting himself by his arms. Neither of them moved, not daring to break the moment, but suddenly the tension snapped. Both of them moved as one, towards each other, lips crashing together with the urgency of a couple who don’t know how long they have. Draco’s arms started trailing up Harry’s arms, eventually settling in Harry’s hair, as the kiss deepened, their lips slotting together as if they’d done this a hundred times before.
Harry grinned. He hadn’t told Draco what to do, but rather chucked him straight into the deep end with Ron and Hermione. In all honesty, he was very proud of all three of them - they’d buried the hatchet, to a degree. Hermione was discussing...something...with Draco. Runes, maybe? Harry had tuned it out at this point, he had no idea. He was talking to Ron about quidditch (“just because the Cannons have lost five years in a row doesn’t mean this isn’t their year!”
“Like...when one of you apparated me it felt like there were needles piercing my skin. But the other person’s magic doesn’t hurt at all.” Harry deliberately avoided both of their gazes, but noted, out of the corner of his eye, the rising flush on Malfoy’s neck.
He lightly dozed, not really listening to their conversation. After a while they left, and it was just him and the warm magic again. And then—
He followed the couple back to the common room, grabbing all the supplies he needed for the lessons and shoving them in his bag before walking up to defence with them. It was a small-ish class - about twenty students, but a mix of all four houses. Harry noted Malfoy was there, and being given a wide berth by everyone; not that he seemed to care. He had his head held high, scanning over everyone that walked past. But there was something different in the way he held himself, Harry noted - he seemed looser, but more elegant. More grounded, and therefore free to move without fear of being lost to the currents.
“Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher, and said that it was being an honour, for Kreacher, and for Master Regulus, and that Kreacher should be sure to be doing whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do, and then — and then to come home.” Kreacher started rocking back and forth on his heels, the floorboards quietly creaking as he continued his story. “So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord, and the Dark Lord took Kreacher to a cave next to the sea. And inside the cave was a green cavern, with a big, still lake.”
He nodded and again broke the eye contact, before poking Harry in the waist instead of telling him to budge over and, as soon as Harry had given him enough room, climbing into the bed.
Hermione cleared her throat, “A location I can’t say because I’m not the secret keeper. You can all look at the paper in a minute.
“It’s the food,” Draco said, hauling the basket off Harry, who hastily moved into a sitting position before Draco dropped the basket on him again.
grey eyes. His mind spun trying to place them, and then it hit him, and he tried to scramble back before realising that he was suffering from malnutrition and injured pretty much
to their magic…” Draco trailed off as his eyes widened. As the Malfoy heir, he had small ties to the wards where they were particularly strong — namely, the lower dungeons. He remembered feeling a prickle since Potter had disappeared - maybe someone was down there. He knew his father had been importing enchanted stone that drained magic. Maybe someone from the other side was down there, and Voldemort wanted information he couldn’t get from leglimency.
Draco wandered over to the photos. There was no evidence of Harry living here - a terrible sleepover, perhaps?
Harry took Draco’s hand and started walking towards the castle, feeling an immense sense of peace - something he hadn’t properly felt in his life. He leaned against Draco, breathing in the scent of citrus radiating off him, a feeling of
Harry sighed again, scrubbing at his eyes before putting quill to parchment again. It wouldn’t do to stare at Draco
“If you’re going to do this, at least do it so you don’t get caught. They’re going at ten in the morning.”
There was the possibility of it being a prank - Draco wrinkled his nose at the flood of Gryffindors that came out of the Hall, forcibly suppressing his urge to hit himself on the head, because
Harry eagerly kissed back, opening his mouth slightly to suck on Draco’s lower lip, running his hands up Draco’s back and feeling all the toned muscle, before pulling him close until Draco was all he could feel, all he was.
Severus made a choking noise, and Hermione’s head snapped to the side to look at him. “Severus? Did you know Regulus?”
“The second brother, still heartbroken over his fiancée dying a month or so ago, asked for a way to bring back the dead. Death picked up a nearby stone from the banks of the river, and said, ‘turn this stone thrice in your hand, and it shall summon the soul you desire.’ The second brother, also satisfied, passed Death and continued on his way. Then, Death turned to the third brother.
cloak before draping Potter’s over his arm. His leg vibrated as he waited for Blaise in the common room, his fingers fiddling with the corner of Potter’s cloak. He wouldn’t normally make a scene by taking it to breakfast with him and giving it to Potter there, but he knew how much Potter hated a) people bullying Slytherins (which might start up again if the Saviour hexes him in public) and b) over dramatic public scenes in general, so hopefully Potter won’t do anything. Draco would have to find a new place to study though, which is a shame.
“I take it you two had the same idea as me?” Draco asked, gesturing to the eggs and sugar on the table.
She opened the door with a flick of her wand, stepping in before closing it behind her. Harry didn’t move, watching her warily from his seat on the floor.
She went up to the boys’ dorm to do the same spell on Ron’s stuff, knowing just how much he procrastinated packing. Indeed, everything that should be in his trunk was on a giant pile on his bed.
“Allow me to cast some spells. Perhaps the spell did go wrong.” Flitwick smiled kindly at them, although his eyes were still unnervingly bright. He waved his wand, muttering some incantations under his breath, and Harry's breath caught. Malfoy was glowing with a silvery light, that set his eyes sparkling and hair glimmering. He looked down at his hands which were encased in the same silvery glow, although it didn’t suit his darker skin as well as it did Malfoy’s. Between them, a thread pulled tight from their chests, glowing brightly. Flitwick clapped his hands, while Malfoy’s face paled.
Once they were at the common room, everyone collapsed in the chairs closest to the fire in a large circle. Harry looked at the large gathering of people - it was one thing on the tables in the dining room, where he could only see three or four people at a time, but the large circle, that many eyes on him if he talked - his blood started pounding in his ears and he started sweating.
Hermione and Ron had been quite worried for the past twenty four hours. Harry had told them that he was going on a top secret mission with Dumbledore to find horcruxes, but hadn’t given them any information. Hermione had wanted to tell McGonagall three hours after they’d left, but Ron had pointed out that a) it was one in the morning and b) Harry was with Dumbledore — what could go wrong?
“Fuck off, fer-“ Weasley yelped, likely as Granger stomped on his foot. She then said something to the rest of the Gryffindors, who waved and continued to walk while Granger dragged Weasley to Draco, who was standing in an alcove, out of the way of the rush of students.
Harry appreciated all of their concern, but at the end of it all had had to leave early - he’d felt like the walls were closing in, like he was about to crumble under the weight of their concerned stares. He’d gone home and thrown up all of Molly’s food, heaving until there was nothing left. Then he’d curled up on his bed, eyes open and staring at the wall, shaking at the thought of another nightmare - so he’d stayed awake for as long as he could.
Harry briefly summarised what had happened to him, while he made tea for everyone. He only left out the part where he saw Sirius; that felt like something only him and Remus should know.
Fleur and most of the Order — everyone who wasn’t inhabiting Grimmauld Place, Shell Cottage, or who’s cover wasn’t blown in the Ministry — were tasked with getting muggleborns out of the country. Safehouses were already set up in northern France, and Charlie was doing further negotiations to get them safe transport to places further from Britain. The muggleborns were instructed not to assume that they were returning anytime soon.
Draco quickly cast silencing charms on the room before running over to Potter, who was screaming and sobbing and saying “get UP, get UP Malfoy, kill me, he’s going to kill you,” and then Potter lost all of his anger and curled up, sobs wracking his skinny frame and repeatedly saying “they’re going to kill you, they’re going to kill you, they’re going to kill you.”
After having woken up Draco several nights in a row with various nightmares, Harry had taken to occluding before he slept on instinct. He didn’t exactly
“So remember, you’re looking for a cup about this big,” Hermione held her hands fifteen centimetres apart, “that has a badger on front.”
I hope everyone is doing okay, and a huge thank you for reading this far - I hope you’re enjoying the story <3
Harry looped his arms around Draco’s neck, kissing him fiercely - and it was better, so much better than the dream, because this was real, and Draco was under his hands, soaked to the skin and solid and
When he re-entered the dorm, Potter was passed out, but Draco didn’t embark on the perilous journey to the kitchens for nothing. He shoved at Potter’s unnervingly thin shoulder, who groaned and waved an arm weakly at Draco, tapping him on the arm.
charm on their shoes had held, thank Merlin. Draco practically purred as he felt the heat wash over him, melting under the magic.
He’d been in Hogsmeade with his friends - and Draco, who’d been integrated as if he’d been part of their group all along. Then the death eaters had shown up - and Harry, Ron, Hermione and Draco had all been sprinting through the forest. They’d been tied up and thrown in the basement, but this time it had just been the four of them.
He could barely raise his head as the door creaked open. He heard a thud and a clink, as a bucket and a plate were placed on the floor.
“The third brother didn’t trust Death in the slightest. He asked for something that would allow him to go forth from this place without being able to be seen by anyone — especially Death. Death reluctantly handed over his own cloak of invisibility.
“You’re always wearing them, and I wanted to see what the fuss was about!” Draco slowly turned, lifting his pastel blue jumper to show off the tight black jeans . Harry’s eyes were immediately drawn to his arse, which looked...there were no words for how good it looked.
Harry had zoned out again. He watched emotionlessly as small children (“We couldn’t possibly have been that small, ‘Mione, look at them!”) walked from the hat to the tables, registering somewhere in the back of his mind the amount of applause the Slytherin first years was significantly less than the other three houses, but couldn’t find the effort to be mad about it.
He met Ron who had probably done the same thing, as they exited their rooms at the same time, and they walked up to the common room, sinking into squishy armchairs opposite each other to wait for Hermione.
- Draco said indignantly, but Pansy was already dragging him up the stairs. Draco beamed - soon, he’d see Harry again, and everything would be as it should be.
randomly burst in, Harry started to take of his clothes, grimacing at the state of them. They’d been cleaned with various charms, but they were still torn, with some bloodstains that couldn’t be removed. Stepping out of his briefs, Harry stared in the mirror, hardly recognising the man who stood before him. He had loads of scabbed cuts all over his body, the most noticeable of which being the two cuts on his face, and one deep gash going around his side, parallel to his rib cage. He had more across his torso, criss–crossing over skin patchy with old scars from the Dursley’s. He knew, if he turned around, there would be even more cuts and scars. He adamantly refused to look at his left arm, where he knew a skull and a snake was carved in excruciating detail. His skin was sallow, his bones stuck out everywhere, his arms and legs were unbelievably thin, and his once bright green eyes had dulled, his hair stringy and matted above them.
childhood, but there were bones that had been previously broken multiple times and hadn’t healed properly, based on how the bones formed slightly crooked shapes, and raised tissue where scars had built up over time.
The rest of the lesson proceeded similarly, with Draco ordering Harry around to produce an Outstanding-level potions and generally give him excellent grades. He also taught Harry a decent amount of theory, meaning there was a chance that he might pass his end of year exams.
He continued staring blankly at the wall, thoughts of passionate kisses and rejections swirling through his mind until the sun cast its rays over Draco’s bed.
At the Burrow, Hermione allowed herself to be enveloped in a warm hug from Molly, accepting a kiss on each cheek from Fleur and a clap on the shoulder from Bill. She lost herself in jobs, cleaning, changing sheets, de-gnoming the garden — anything to ignore that sense of
. The green light still flickered around the cave, but other than that, the two figures were frozen.
His plans hadn’t changed — he was clearing the ministry of everyone who wasn’t loyal to him as quickly as possible. He had the Prophet already printing anti–muggleborn propaganda, currently under the guise of concern, but he would likely have most of public opinion turned to his side by the end of summer.
“Shut up,” Draco whispered, grabbing Harry’s head with both hands and pinning him against the wall, one leg between Harry’s, and
The older of the two children was probably around six years old. He was clutching his sister’s shoulders, stoically silent, and glaring at the Malfoys with hatred in his eyes. Hatred and anger, but surprisingly no fear. That adamant look — it looked like Potter. Even if he could cast the killing curse, Draco didn’t think he would be able to kill this one.
There was applause throughout the hall at the end of the song, even as Ron muttered out of the side of his mouth “The rhyming’s gotten bad.”
After a week, the Carrows had caught onto their ‘games’ and were ordering the Slytherins to physically beat people in detention. Getting three broken ribs healed in the hospital wing, courtesy of Goyle, Ginny decided that it was time to do…
” Harry shook his head — he’d only tried to use an incendio on bread once, which had resulted in a lump of charcoal.
Remus started to cry as well, an old ache resurfacing in his chest. He’d be able to see Sirius again, one day — and Sirius still loved him.
Ron grimaced, and an awkward silence hung around the table. Hermione broke it after a moment, saying, “Kreacher, could you show our guests to their rooms?”
It was one thing to be comforting Harry when he has nightmares, when he’s shaking and not in a good place and willing to take comfort from anyone. It’s another to be flirting and joking around, staring at those emerald eyes and tying his tie, holding it for a moment too long.
- Draco had found that he had a surprising amount of free time as a healer, since there were a lot of people coming in and less people being injured since the war was over, so he got a potions mastery and made loads of new potions, including a new Wolfsbane potion.
“So the bond did go wrong in charms, but not in the way I thought. We did get bonded, and we’re still,” Malfoy grimaced, “bonded.”
He finished lunch, and pondered what to do next. He didn’t really want to do anything - normally he picked a book at random from the library and stared at the pages, occasionally reading them, but today he just wanted to do...nothing. Packing and stressing about going back had really taken all the energy out of him.
“It’s not your fault. I think this year has hit hardest because it’s the first year I’ve been able to properly mourn.” Harry had no idea how his voice was staying steady.
Regardless, Harry had taught the Gryffindors well in the DA, and Draco had been taught well by his teacher; likely his mother, since his style was reminiscent of Sirius’. Likely a form passed down through the generations of Blacks.
Tired from the relief from the stress of the day, Draco ignored his friends as he walked into the common room and fell into bed, barely sparing enough time to strip down to his briefs and cast a teeth-brushing charm. He dreamed of hugging and comforting Potter in the kitchens that night - something he regretted not doing earlier.
Draco found himself pulled to an unfamiliar, but unremarkable driveway, when he fell asleep. He was a ghost, of sorts - he could walk, but his hand passed through the door when he tried to open it. The door led into an equally unremarkable hallway, with decorated but still plain wallpaper and many photos dedicated to a pink...lump. It was a child, but a very ugly, overweight one. Impressed with the detail in this dream, Draco decided it must be a memory of sorts - a lot like the pensieve, which explained why he couldn’t influence anything.
Draco tried to breathe as quietly as possible, carefully cutting his chicken while warily watching the others at the table. The atmosphere was thick with tension, and while Draco longed to talk, any conversation initiated by himself would likely be shot down by Ron — being on a first name basis had done nothing to reduce the hostility between them. Also, he was absolutely shattered after a day of research and practicing healing spells. They weren’t
“Evidently,” Draco said, in a stronger voice now. It was light out, so he grabbed a wand and checked the time. “It’s 7:30, we should probably get moving.”
He woke up again when painful magic — three sources of them — entered the room. His mind was still foggy, but he tried to keep still as they settled at the end of his bed, the magic pricking his mind like thorns. He tried to focus on the warmth of the nice magic, the magic that allowed him to feel more relaxed than he had in weeks. Regardless of how much pain the other magics caused him, he was in a much better place than before.
“My hopes exactly. Anyway, I took them to an old Black safehouse — one that I knew Bella didn’t know about, and we’ve all been hiding out there—”
Harry pulled a face and put impervious charms on his shoes and trousers, and an umbrella charm over his and Draco’s heads. It was weird to use his magic so flippantly, especially when it wasn’t fully recovered, but he’d gotten better at not using ridiculous amounts for small spells. Regardless, he still wasn’t up for maintaining a long–lasting warming charm in this weather. Draco, thankfully, shivered and cast a warming charm that filled their bubble, his magic a soft layer against Harry’s skin as the precipitation fell in sheets in front of them.
He scanned the titles, making a new pile with a flick of his wand that consisted of eight books. He could have gotten more, but these would do, for now.
“Yeah,” he muttered, shoving the parchment at Draco. He narrowly prevented it from falling into his food, scanning the parchment until he saw, in slightly different handwriting,
He’d drank three cups by the time the kids came down. The look of them made him feel even worse — Bill and Fleur were relatively older, sure, but Ginny was supposed to be going into her seventh year. They were all too young to look so old — haunted eyes, stress lines where they shouldn’t be, battle–weary expressions.
. He would easily put together the clues and if he ever confronted Draco...well, there was always Beauxbatons. He had got on with the students when they had come to Hogwarts in fourth year, even if he had spent more of his time obsessing over Krum. And he already spoke French.
Harry rolled his eyes, mirroring Snape (how odd), and might have almost laughed when the man murmured “language.” He tried to lift his arm to pick up the flask, and glared at the offending arm when it refused to move.
to, Potter, but it doesn’t look like we have much choice” Draco drawled, gesturing lazily around the room. No reason to look eager at attempting a mind bond with him.
that Lily wanted to be closer friends), would have liked, and Lily always criticised his friends (with good reason, but it still hurt at the time). His Slytherin ‘friends’ had just been interested in harassing muggle–borns, and the ones that weren’t didn’t really want anything to do with him, having been more interested in either advancing their opportunities in life or hooking up with people. Friends in Slytherin, at least while Severus had been young, had always been about networking; not Severus’ style.
Before Lucius could finish his sentence, Severus stood in a flurry of robes, handing the blonde two small bottles filled with clear liquid. “Tell the Dark Lord that I require more ingredients for the healing potions since we’re running low.”
“I can't believe you’d do that, you’re supposed to be my best friend,” Harry muttered, hurriedly getting out of bed.
“Can we have waffles?” James asked, looking at Harry adoringly with those eyes Harry loved. Scorpius squirmed around until he was facing Harry, before looking at Harry with big green eyes. At first, Harry had found it unnerving to find his own eyes looking at him from under a mop of pale blonde hair, but he’d quickly gotten over it.
,” he waved his knife in the motion, “like this, but…bigger. And in a wider range — you have to stand towards the corner and kind of cover the whole room. Obviously, the amount of magic it takes is proportional to the size of the room, but it’s never been a huge issue for me, despite not having massive wells of magic.”
“Call me Hermione,” Granger waved a hand dismissively at him, “And yes, he’s been smitten with you since sixth year, to my knowledge.”
“Fuck off, Ron.” Harry groaned, waving a hand dismissively at Ron and rolling over, pulling the thick duvet over his head. He groaned again as said duvet was pulled off him, exposing him to the mercilessly cold air.
“The potion appears to be speeding up the curse slightly, but,” he groaned slightly, “it’s fine. Get another cup full.”
“Okay.” Draco drew the drapes around Harry’s bed, his chest aching at the look in Harry’s eyes. He sighed and shook his head - Harry needed space, so space Harry would get.
Ron nodded, and poured the memory into the basin, before he and Hermione plunged their faces into the basin.
Harry walked into the classroom, eyes immediately drawn to white hair, that looked pale, liquid gold in the lighting of the classroom. The thing he was happiest about when Slughorn took over from Snape was that he had gotten rid of the eerie, green light in favour of cheerfully burning torches on the walls. It suited Draco to no end, softening the pointy edges of his face.
Sighing, he looked over at Draco. They were both doing homework at their respective desks - Harry on the second half of his transfiguration essay, cursing his past self for not finishing it before, and Draco on his arithmancy (probably - there were a lot of numbers, but there were also some odd symbols that could be runes). Harry had almost finished, just a conclusion to do, but Draco seemed engrossed in his work, furiously scribbling, his cramped, scruffy handwriting nothing like the calligraphy Harry had noticed before. White teeth nibbled on his lower lip, which was slowly turning red, and his eyes narrowed in concentration as he reached a particularly difficult sum (translation? Harry genuinely had no idea).
“The Boy who Lived, come to die” Ginny hissed - their entire conversation had been in parseltongue, Harry realised, how had he not realised sooner, Voldemort was back - he was frozen, collapsing on the cold, unforgiving ground of the forest as Ginny’s bed disappeared, hearing a high pitched cackle that he would never forget ring in his ears and Voldemort was in front of him, behind him, encompassing the entire world...and Harry was almost relieved when he heard those too-familiar words, saw a flash of green light, felt a stabbing pain in his chest as he was falling…
“You’ll be fine. Kreacher, can you fetch the locket and the cup, please? The evil ones.” Kreacher nodded without even muttering a slur. He really had come far.
After clearing out the Burrow and putting most of the stuff in a large storage room that had appeared in Grimmauld Place, which had been a very emotional event for everyone involved, they started the rather boring task of bringing the order together. Hermione remembered the protean charm that she’d used for the DA, and decided to do something similar, with a knut that would grow warm under the touch of the person it was keyed to — a similar piece of magic to that of the snitch. It was tricky business, charming the knuts without touching them, but she managed it, leaving everyone else to write letters.
An invisible hand gripping Draco’s shoulder, he slowly walked out of the room, not wanting to dislodge Severus.
Hermione collapsed, sobbing, and Ron carefully sat down beside her. “‘Mione, you couldn’t have known this was what was going to happen…”
to spend Christmas with him? He’d spent every moment with Harry for the last three months, he’d probably want a break rather than another two weeks with Harry around every corner.
