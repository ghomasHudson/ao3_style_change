“As I am faithful, I keep your secret, and take the location: 12 Grimmauld Place. So mote it be.”
“Critter will also make lunch for Master Hari and his friendses.”
“It sounds like you’ve essentially adopted her,” Mr. Granger crosses his arms and glares at Hari. “She is our daughter.”
“Draco, we need to do homework.”
“Ten o’clock,” he replies.
“The Potterses be living in the East wing and having guests stay in the West.”
Pansy and Hari both pull out their planners.
“Yes, Lord Potter and Heirs?” Professor Snape narrows his eyes at them.
“Oh, okay, yeah that would be really nice. Are you sure though? I mean you just met me, right?” Harry seemed a little taken aback by Draco’s response, as if he hadn’t realized that he didn’t know him very well, which confused Draco mostly because Harry had just spent the last few minutes explaining his friends to him.
Unsurprisingly, Draco had a nightmare the night before the day he moved to school, it was mostly due to the anxiety coursing through his veins, but he blamed it on his Criminal Minds marathon the day before. Draco woke up and blearily blinked up at the clock on his bedside table, realizing it was two hours earlier than he wanted to wake up. He shakily tumbled out of bed and into his shower, willing the heat of the water to melt the tension away. Draco spent a long time in the shower. He sat down on the floor of it, the water rushing down on his head, and breathed. The warmth helped him feel better, quelling the doubts and fears that clouded his mind and the after-effects of the terrible thing he dreamed about but could no longer remember. He took pleasure in of his morning erection just because he could, letting himself relax even further. Draco gave himself the mental space to think through everything - just in case - so that when he stepped out of the shower and faced the reality of the day, he would be okay.
It was towards the end of the current episode that Ron was watching that Draco decided to approach his room, almost cautiously. Ron noticed Draco and waved him in, motioning for him to sit on the bed with him. He put Netflix on pause and set his laptop to the side, still open.
The two of them fall silent, bodies laid out comfortably on Ron’s bed, their growing friendship blooming into the room. Draco smiled at Ron in a polite, thankful way and received a smile in return.
Draco grimaced at his own indecision, “I haven’t decided, but I’ll probably just stay here in the end - I mean I could go home, but it’s been nice to be away the past two months. What are you doing?”
They walk back to the road table where everyone else was getting out of their seats and preparing to leave. Ron said to Draco as they made their way out, “I’m sure you’ll fit right in,” and beamed up at him, in such a hopeful and happy way that Draco grinned back too.
“Well I’m supposed to enroll in classes from this coming semester. Most of the classes are already full and I know that I should have started trying to do this months ago, but I didn’t decide to come back to school until about a week ago, so I didn’t really have a lot of options.” Draco said all of this in a rush, and his face flushed a deeper red. Harry nodded along with his words and gave him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder.
“Ok, thanks,” Draco agreed and moved back to his spot to sit down and have a snack. He chatted to Hermione about how her studying was going and was happy to hear about a current project she was working on. They also chatted about one of the essays he was creating an outline for until her alarm went off and the room succumbed to a quiet working environment.

“I definitely wanna try this, but not tonight, if that’s ok? I want to talk it through with you more, like we’ve done with everything else.”
Draco tried not to show how impressed he was at how quickly Morag was able to deduce his intentions. "She already gave me her veela name, actually. Well, at least I
Before either Draco or Aria could think of an appropriate answer, they were interrupted when Blaise suddenly sauntered over to them and casually wrapped an arm around Luna's waist.
"I'm already scheduled to take the Auror qualifying exam next month."
Another trail of whispers rang out from the reporters gathered in front of Draco, and he watched as one of them stood up and called Aria's attention.
after all." Lewis quipped back, giving Draco a knowing wink.
Draco gritted his teeth and found himself walking closer towards them so that he could hear the rest of their conversation.
say you were attractive." He growled.
"Um, okay. Uh-huh." Aria forced out a small, awkward smile at that and discreetly tried to edge away from him. "It's nice to meet you, Bentley." She added reluctantly when an expectant look seemed to linger on his face.
Blaise made a face at her before he reached into the pocket of his robes and pulled out a silver flask.
"Because Pansy, in case you've forgotten—" He ignored the way Blaise was glancing back and forth between them and cut off the rest of Pansy's attempt at a retort with a harsh, mocking sneer.
"It wasn't your fault, mate. That bludger came out of nowhere." Ron berated her firmly as he reluctantly stopped attempting to pull her from Draco's arms and glared poisonously at another approaching figure over Ginny's shoulder.
Aria was interrupted when a small group of squealing middle aged witches suddenly crowded around her, forcefully separating her from Draco. They gushed excitedly about how they were big fans of hers and begged her for an autograph, but Aria barely paid them any attention. She watched as the expectant expression on Draco's face fell, and he shifted awkwardly a few times before beginning to back away from the growing circle of fans around her.
"Well, technically, they can. There are laws in place that state that 'mental instability' caused by a vampire's

like me. So really now, what does that say about her?"

Draco's glass froze halfway to his lips and he blinked at him.
"What are you doing here?"
. Naturals are
She made her way across the hall towards the refreshment table, taking that opportunity to glance appreciatively around her.
At the obvious hilarity he heard in her voice, the scowl on Draco's face deepened.
"Exactly. Your
So far, since her 18th birthday last summer, Aria had only been able to encounter
"Good choice." Aria conceded and returned his grin with her own. "That's my favorite team too. Though my best friend Ron says Chudley Canons is the best." She and Corey both made a face at that and the utterly appalled look on his face made Aria laugh.
"How dare you?!"
"She really grows on you, doesn't she?" He quipped sarcastically.
Blaise leaned back lazily against the couch, crossing his arms over his chest and casually resting an ankle against one knee. When he didn't answer and just continued to smirk at her, Aria rolled her eyes at him and decided to take his silence as a 'yes'.
, in fact, live without taking any blood. Contrary to popular belief, we do not actually need blood to survive and we can perfectly live off on normal food, same as everyone else. We do, however, need to consume blood, human or otherwise, in order to use our vampire abilities. In fact, the more we use our powers, the more we need to drink blood." He explained.
She smirked at the irritated look he gave her but nevertheless, she joined him as he crouched back down to the ground and helped him wrestle a set of bludgers back into their case. Afterwards, as they both stood up and began walking towards the shower rooms in surprisingly comfortable silence, Aria spoke up again, turning to him as they reached the end of the field.
to choose a mate anytime in the immediate future anyway.
Draco's eyebrow lifted curiously; but he didn't answer.
"And what about Potter?" Greg asked again, ignoring the warning look Blaise and Pansy shot him.
exactly but my dad just floo-called me and told me to not cause any trouble or attract any attention right now." He told them, shrugging.
Aria smirked at Pansy's miffed expression.
"Well…" Ron hesitated, meeting Hermione's eyes and giving her a questioning look. When Hermione just blushed, Aria arched an eyebrow and flicked her gaze back and forth between them in question.
"Your brother always did have horrible taste." Aria scoffed as she plucked the stuffed toy from Ron's outstretched hands, placing it onto the table beside her.
A few seconds later, another Nimbus 2001 came flying all the way across the other side of the field towards them, and Aria grinned as she caught it easily in her hand. Draco waited until she offered the broom's handle out to Corey before he shrugged and rewarded the younger Slytherin with a knowing smirk.
In spite of himself, Draco couldn't help chuckling at the oh-so-clever and witty name she used to sign the letter at the end, thinking back to how she had deliberately avoided telling him her name back at that train station.
He never saw the way Aria's features contorted with pain, or the way she clutched weakly at her chest as she watched him walk away.
...like that...Too good...ahhhh...gods..."
Aria grinned at her while Pansy just scoffed, crossing her arms indignantly over her chest.
Smirking, Draco waited until she exited the room before he leaned back languidly against the counter and finished the rest of his tea.
Especially since, based on
"Are you still cold?"
"Yes, she did."
Draco lifted his gaze and let out a sigh of relief when he saw Blaise jogging hastily across the field towards them.
if I can help it." Pansy answered quietly as she stood up carefully from her seat, her eyes glassy and her movements jerky as she began packing her things.
"Um. That might be a little too advanced for you." Aria chuckled and looked up, meeting Ron's equally amused grin before turning back to Corey with a nervous smile. "And your sister might kill me."
She frowned, clearly still not understanding their point. "How exactly is self-confidence supposed to be sexy or attractive?" She demanded.
at all. "The sorting hat didn't actually ask me any question."
"I barely managed to convince my parents to let him attend Hogwarts with me. He had just started his first year when the war broke out. When I realized that I couldn't get him back home and that the Death Eaters were going to storm the castle unless we gave you up to the Dark Lord, I just—" Pansy closed her eyes and shook her head, her shoulders trembling with unkempt emotion. "—I was desperate. All I wanted to do at the time was to make sure he was safe." She whispered.
Pansy looked so
Aria just rolled her eyes.
"Thanks. I think?" Ron chuckled softly before his expression sobered again and he gave her another comforting smile. "Anyway, try not to worry so much about that whole veela thing, okay? Whatever you decide to do, you
"How dare you?" Hannah's eyes widened and she glared indignantly at him. "I most certainly did not—"
"For what you did for my brother, obviously." Pansy gave her an annoyed look and rolled her eyes in exasperation. "If it wasn't for you, and if you hadn't stepped in the way you did that day, Corey would have been expelled and punished for something he didn't do."
gay, Zach!" Hannah snapped.
"Do I
"And let me guess." Draco drawled, smirking to himself and shaking his head. "She hired Pansy as her wedding coordinator, didn't she? Does she have a death wish?"
"How? Where?" Aria prodded, stifling a smile.
Aria tried not to wince under Madam Pomfrey's heavily scrutinizing glare, blanching when the older woman sighed again and bent down to inspect her broken wing.
"You'd better make sure it still works then." Draco mocked.
"Oui, e
"Wonderful!" Slughorn nodded approvingly at him, clapping both Draco and Blaise on the shoulders.
She realized that she actually
"I was just trying to keep you from getting knocked over." He told her.
Aria rolled her eyes and yanked her hand out of his grasp, stalking towards the entrance to the common room. After muttering the password ("basilisk fang"), the door slid open and Draco followed closely behind her as she walked inside.
Once he was gone and the common room was left in sudden, uncomfortable silence, Blaise finally let out the snicker he had been holding in and turned to grin roguishly at Draco.
Undeterred by Draco's deadpan voice, Blaise went on as though he hadn't heard him. "So both of you, get your asses up, wash the sex away and hurry back to Hogwarts okay? Because it's about to start. Just go directly to the Chamber of Secrets, everyone should be there." He chirped cheerfully, smirking when Aria nearly tripped on her own long hair as she slid out of the bed.
He flushed and immediately cut himself off when she suddenly slapped both of her hands over her mouth, her slim shoulders shaking as she desperately tried to muffle her laughter.
"So?" Blaise looked bored at that as he shrugged and gave Pansy a questioning look. "What's so bad about that? Their family is filthy rich. Honestly? Given the shrinking pool of men out there considered 'acceptable' under your father's antiquated standards, you could do a lot worse." He pointed out bluntly.
Pansy met the surprised look on Aria's face with wry smile. "And I only just realized that I never really thanked you properly for your help so...well, thank you. I suppose you're not all that bad after all.
"Shouldn't you be eating dinner in the Great Hall by now?" He remarked.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that—"
"Draco? Is everything okay?" Astoria asked him softly, a worried frown creasing her features.
Blaise and Pansy glanced uncertainly at each other, obviously not knowing what to answer.
He smiled slightly when he realized that the owl was waiting for him to reply.
"Oh, screw you both!" She snapped.
He didn't wait for Aria to answer before he continued. "And funny you should mention Puddlemere, actually, because you
“Hermione is a close friend of mine. There are people who don’t like me and have been targeting her because of it. Simply terminating our friendship would not have stopped that. Now,” Hari tilts his head, “I could have simply told these people that she has my protection, but that wouldn’t give me any legal right to act on it.”
“Pettigrew got out,” Blaise confirms, “and they’re thinking he’s coming to Hogwarts to get back at you.”
“Lord Potter,” she bows in a sweeping gesture, “I am delighted to finally meet you. I have heard many good things about you.” Blaise turns a little pink at this, but his mother carries on, “from both my son and Lord Malfoy.”
“So I have witnessed, so mote it be,” Draco completes the ritual. Magic rises over their clasped hands and twine Hari and Hermione together.
“There’s more than one study?”
“That’d be the loyalty, then,” Hari chuckles. How no one else in their House can see that Hufflepuffs would make the most trustworthy friends, Hari will never understand. Not that he has Hufflepuff friends himself, but when required to work with one in class, they’re diligent and kind. He’d take working with them over a Ravenclaw any day.
“I know,” Hari sighs. They lay down, Hari on top of Draco rather comfortably. Draco lets Hari’s hair down and strokes his fingers through it. The content purring comes back within moments and Draco smiles, pleased with himself.
It’s the day of nominations for the new Chief Warlock. Hari dresses primarily in black, with only muted red robes and a succinite, or dark amber, tie and pocket square to set it apart. Amber is the House stone of the House of Bones and Hari thought it would be appropriate to represent his pick. The red, while most would assume is to represent House of Gryffindor, is actually the same shade Aurors wear, as a nod to her position as Head of the DMLE.
Hari’s eyes skim across Draco’s copy of the Prophet. There’d been a sighting of Peter Pettigrew, although why he would show his face given his subtle animagus form, Hari cannot fathom.
is the title. Hari looks at the book and finds the title ironic. If this is extensive, then there really must not be much to it.
“I’m the current Headmaster,” Hari snarls, “and I’m not pleased.” The wizard pales and starts the train. They shoot forward and, sure enough, the Dementors part to let them pass.
“Do you want me to throw a fit?”
“Right,” Dumbledore glares up at Hari, who simply crooks an eyebrow at him. “As I was saying, the first thing on our agenda is a bill proposed by Secretary Umbridge and dealing with werewolves. Miss Umbridge?” He gestures for her to take the floor.
“Just kiss me already, you dunce,” Hari says affectionately, hooking his arms around Draco’s neck.
“Of course,” she agrees and looks somewhat relieved. As someone who wasn’t raised in the culture and who hadn’t had to learn about all the families after arriving, she is at somewhat of a disadvantage to Hari.
“Oh, no, I don’t have to worry about that,” Hari smiles at her, “perks of being a Lord. Although, they still tried to discourage me from using it too much. I say who cares. It’s not like I know advanced spells, anyway.”
Draco lets him turn around, then, the sneaky brat he is, he scoops Hari into a koala carry and stalks through the house to the dining room.
“Welcome back, Lord Potter,” Mr. Lazwell smiles at them, “I see your shopping went well.”
“I’m sorry for yelling at you,” he murmurs.
They go back and forth on the wisdom of keeping students over the summer, then put it to a vote. In the end, the three year tiered program wins.
With that done, they’ve only been at work for a little over an hour.
They set about translating for Latin in pairs, knowing that working as a group would mean less learning. The paragraph isn’t long, only three or so sentences, and so it doesn’t take too long to work through, even if Draco does make Hari do most of the work. They pass again, checking each other’s work and reviewing the translations communally. Any changes necessary are made and then Latin is put away.
“It is,” Hari confirms, “if I’m taking away enough income, she may need to use it.”
“Read the story about the chimaera?” Hari suggests, wanting to see just how far Draco will take this ‘cheer up Hari’ attempt. Draco doesn’t even sigh at the suggestion, just opens the book to the correct page and starts reading. Pretty far, apparently, since they’d requested that specific story at least four times in the last two weeks and Draco had gotten huffy the last two times.
“I don’t care if it was planned or not,” Blaise huffs, “it was still wonderful seeing the old fart go down.”
Hermione thinks for a long minute, then says, “okay, but that doesn’t really explain why I need this stuff.”
“No, I mean, he was alienating even some people who believe in blood purity,” Hari cuts him off. “I think your father voted him up to tighten the vote.”
“I call for the doors to be unsealed and Albus Dumbledore to be taken in by Aurors.”
“It’s up to you,” he tells her, “but one of these studies could be yours.” He gestures to the two unused rooms. “I’ve already promised one to Draco, when he gets a little older.”
“About a year and a half ago, it was brought to the goblins’ attention that a great disservice had been done to one of your own,” Master Tomeaxe begins and the whispers stop. “The fact that we goblins, through our complacency, allowed this to occur is the reason I stand before you today and not a wix solicitor.
“I know,” Hari sighs. “I’m concerned that they’ll manage to,” he admits.
Professor McGonagall reveals herself to have been Professor Snape’s sounding board for when he didn’t know how to react or how to help Hari.
The Minister rises, “Apologies, Chief Warlock, but I question the wisdom of allowing a thirteen year old child to sit on our esteemed body.”
“I’m not much good at apparition anymore, so we’ll have to floo,” Sirius helps Hermione up.
“Thank you,” Hari bows slightly to them, “for being open to these changes.”
“It’s good to see you, too, Critter,” Hermione responds with a small smile.
“And that,” Dumbledore stands, “is the last bit on our agenda for the afternoon. We will reconvene at seven to review the schedule for the next session and distribute materials.” He taps his wand on the podium and everyone files out yet again.
“Tonks!” Shacklebot calls, shoving Pettigrew into the shop. “Let’s wrap this up. Lord Potter, we’ll send notice when we can if we need your testimony.”
Draco smiles to himself. He can’t wait to tell Daphne and the others. They’ll be so excited to hear the news. But he stops himself from jumping up and rushing straight to the floo. It’s late. And Hari’s asleep on him. And everyone knows you don’t move a sleeping kitten. Maybe this isn’t such a bad thing, that they can’t tell the others just yet. Maybe having it all for themselves for a few days wouldn’t be so bad.
“May I ask who it is?”
They’re almost back to the carriages when a voice drifts over them.
“Lady Longbottom, Heir Longbottom,” Hari and Hermione say in unison as Hermione bows.
“Hari!” His name is an echoing wail this time and Hari cringes at the sound. The fits are funny when they’re directed at other people, but mostly irritating when directed at him. He keeps walking. The sound of running feet carries through the corridors and Draco’s back at his side.
“I feel kind of bad not bringing Hermione along for this,” Pansy admits, taking a bite of a biscuit.
“Still, one way or the other, you got the lesson. Your father explained it to me as ‘losing the battle to win the war.’ Or, in this case, surrendering the battle to win the war.”
But then Draco sees him in action, setting the world on fire and not letting anyone attack him. And Draco remembers how much Hari has already survived and how he doesn’t need to be protected. He needs to be supported and sometimes guided. And maybe sometimes, he wants to be protected, shielded from reality. He can always come to Draco for that. But Hari doesn’t
“Can we do this later? I’m absolutely starving,” Hari groans. “I was this close,” he holds up his thumb and forefinger almost touching, “to having to cast a silencing spell at my stomach, I swear.”
“Sorry, ‘Mione,” he grins up at her, “I’m still getting used to all this traditional stuff, too.”
“Before, please,” Hermione says, looking around in wonder. Hari keeps the first two floors brief—and excludes the library—then leads her up to the studies.
“Don’t care.”
“There’ll be time,” Daphne says, writing down the last steps in their plan, “there’s not too much to do today. Let’s get started. Draco, read off the notes.”
“Yeah, it’s an important topic,” Hari agrees, “but I don’t know if I want to listen to her talk for two hours.”
At the end of the story, Draco rolls to toss the book on his bedside table and then tugs Hari into his arms.
“I think anyone who is part of a House will display bias and be untrustworthy as a Chief Warlock.”
“You didn’t know they were here?” Remus asks.
The minute that Runes ends, the group makes their way up to the R.O.R to get started on their homework. When they arrive, Luna is already outside, waiting for them.
After dinner, Hari calls Critter.
“Dementors guard Azkaban, Hari,” Daphne tells him, voice gentle. “They literally suck the happiness out of you and cause you to be entrenched in bad memories. They’re the things that almost drove Sirius crazy.”
Stifled laughter ripples through the chamber. The minister blushes and bows once more.
There’s a ripple of shock through the chamber before the Minister stands, “I call to put this to vote.”
“Well, then,” Blaise chuckles, “that was almost Draco-worthy.”
“How—how do I do the second option?”
“You’re breaking the law,” Hari tells him blandly, “Hogwarts is sovereign land. We’re practically our own country. You have to have my
“You think they can cook that fast?” Hari arches a brow.
Daphne and Pansy are already holding a booklet and chattering about styles. As Hermione comes out, they’re instructing Mr. Lazwell on what styles and colors to use.
“Got it.” Draco scoops up the book and reads over the short lines he’ll recite. “Okay, I’m ready.”
“No,” Hari shakes his head, “she decided to stay with her parents for the duration of the summer. We’ll still see her at Wizengamot sessions, though.” Pansy pouts, but Draco appears to be the opposite of displeased. Hari wonders about this for an instant, but brushes it off. He must just be reading Draco wrong.
“Nothing could ever be too much.”
They spend some time discussing the wisdom of teaching Divination versus not and, in the end, elect to remove it from the curriculum. Students who had already taken the class would be allowed to finish the track through their seventh year, which means that Hari’s year is the first it will not be an option. On the other hand, classes that should have been offered are added, including Latin as mandatory for all years, Beasts for second and third years, and Healing, Wandlore, Dueling, and Advanced Spellcasting as electives for year three and up. They agree that as the classes had just been discussed and chosen, candidates would be presented and chosen at the next meeting.
“Wonderful.”
Not surprisingly, most of the kneazles that stay are young. There’s a few older ones mixed in, but it’s less than Hari would have liked. His lips pinch.
“Thank you,” Hari says shyly. Draco glances up, then smirks mischievously.
“I can go see Wizengamot sessions?” Hermione gasps.
“Miss Hermione is under Potterses Protection,” Critter declares, “Critter will take good care of Miss Hermione.”
“We probably are,” Draco admits, “everyone experiences bad thoughts.”
The doors seal for the last time that evening and papers are already on the small stand in front of Hari’s seat. He flips the file open to read over the agenda.
“To block only sound coming from the Wizengamot and the gallery.” There’s mutterings of dissent among the Lords and Ladies, so Master Tomeaxe says, “I do this in order to ensure the mental and emotional security of a victim of extreme circumstances.” While not particularly pleased, the Wizengamot seems to accept this answer and they wait for Master Tomeaxe to call Hari.
“Lord Potter, Heir Greengrass,” Hermione bows quickly.
“Paperwork for what?”
“Yes?” Daphne’s eyes go wide, “You weren’t there when Hari learned all this, were you? Purebloods save ancestral wands, which don’t have traces on them since their owner is technically dead. And traces can’t be placed on our house like they can at muggleborns’ since our whole family does magic. So, we learn spells early with those.”
“Oh, good.”
Hari stares for a moment and Hermione decides to reply, “are nargles people, Luna?”
“But does she know that?”
“Never,” Draco vows. Hari lets himself relax in Draco’s arms and soon, has fallen asleep to the sound of Draco’s heart beating.
“Very good. If you would just pay, Lord Potter, I’ll have your packages shrunken.” He bustles to the back as Hari sets his ring into the groove. The bell chimes to signal that payment has gone through and, packages in hand, they take their leave. They finish up their day with a scoop from Fortescue’s before heading over to the Leakey.
“Don’t wanna.”
Hari laughs and lets her explore for a little while, until both their stomachs are grumbling.
“Critter can do that,” Critter perks up.
“Oh, thank you, Hari!” She looks at him fretfully for a moment, “or should I be calling you ‘Lord Potter’?”
“No. Don’t wanna.”
“Aw, I missed you, too,” Draco smirks and nuzzles his nose into Hari’s hair, “though, it’s only been an hour.”
Hari and Draco make their way out of the shop.
“I do,” the Ravenclaw nods, “I never knew that wix had a different culture. This is technically my culture, too, and I’m mad Dumbledore kept it from us.”
“I don’t think I’ve seen you with your hair down since you got those new potions,” she says, “it’s gorgeous.”
“Do you want me to read for a bit or would you rather just go to sleep?” Draco curls into the bed next to Hari, holding a book of short stories they’d been reading lately.
“No,” Hari shakes his head. “None planned, at least. The next thing on the agenda is really boring, actually.”
“Critter will make a list!” He promises and pops away.
“You’re interesting, Hari Potter,” Luna says.
Suddenly, a silvery wolf shoots into the Dementor, which flees immediately. A person approaches behind the wolf and peeks into the compartment.
“Alright,” Hari says, “what do we do?”
“Perhaps, Lord Potter, you could explain this decision?” Professor Snape suggests.
“Brilliant idea, Lord Potter,” Lucius agrees and marks it down. “I believe we have discussed everything on our agenda for the day.”
“Uluka,” she declares. “The name of the Goddess Lakshmi’s mount. Although, to be more accurate, he would need to be a white barn owl. I like it anyway.”
“You belong on the team.”
“As long as they’re not muggleborn,” he mutters, scanning the dancefloor through the doors.
“No, no,” Hari waves her off and flips the book open. There’s a table of contents, perfect. “I’ve given you leave not to already. I’d rather not do that formally. Hey, Dray, could you explain the ins and outs of it to her?”
“Yeah, ok,” Ron nodded, and said, “I saw that you brought a thing of toilet paper, my mom and I got a case also, so we’re pretty much set in that regard, at least for a few weeks. We also got some cleaning supplies - they’re in the cabinet under the sink.”
“You’re welcome,” Hari replies, “and thank you for having me.” He stands, nods to everyone in the room, and makes his way out.
“Come on, all of you. This is really cool,” Draco grins brilliantly at all of them and leads Ajay out of the room. They walk all the way over to the East wing of the Manor and to the doors of the large, open room Draco used to learn to fly as a child. “We’re here. Ready, Ajay?”
Draco flips open his Herbology book and starts reading. It’s Hari’s turn, so he takes diligent notes as the chapter continues. In fifteen minutes, they move on to Beasts, an even quicker read. They’re completely done in only ten more minutes. Pansy stretches her arms over her head.
“What?” Draco snaps to attention, looking outside. “They are,” he whispers, sounding terrified, “Lock the compartment door. Now.” He fumbles for the latch on the window and manages to catch it just as a Dementor drifts past. Daphne clicks the lock on the door. Hari glances over—it doesn’t seem like enough if they’re going to keep one of these things out. Already, with it on the outside of the train and several feet away, he feels despair creeping in. He draws his wand and casts a sealing spell at the door, one he’d learned to protect his study, just in case.
“My apologies.”
“It’s not as much help after the fact,” Hari curses himself for not thinking to add it to her shoes, too, “I should’ve remembered before we came. Lady Malfoy is a Healer, a Mind Healer, technically, but trained in general Healing, as well. She can heal the muscles in your feet that are hurting and I’ll get you a pain potion, too, so you won’t be sore tomorrow.”
Writing happened. Not as much as I wanted, but it happened. So there's that.
The process repeats itself, almost word for word until they reach the gallery doors.
“Then perhaps you should review your history, as there are Lords as young as I documented throughout the lifespan of this body. And let us not forget one who helped create this body, Arthur Pendragon, the thirteen-year-old King.” Hari tilts his head at the minister, looking for all the world like an innocent, curious child. “Perhaps you could request lessons from Lord Malfoy. He did an exemplary job teaching me.”
“Pretty much,” Daphne confirms. “But we’ll only be getting you a few things from Mr. Lazwell.”
“You can,” Draco grins at her, “and you’re high enough in your House’s ranking to be allowed in for sealed cases, even.”
“Oh,” Pansy waves her hand, “what’s one dinner now and again? So long as we don’t do it often, it’s not the end of the world.” Hari neglects to point out that they had eaten the bare minimum for what could require as a dinner at his Wizengamot introduction and then proceeded to gorge themselves on desserts. Now is probably not the time to draw attention to the fact that their idea of ‘now and again’ is vastly different than an adults. Besides, Hari wants ice cream, too.
“Luna, what are nargles?”
When Madam Pomfrey comes up, she details every injury Hari had received and revealed that most of them could not be repaired. He tunes most of her testimony out.
In a flash, each kneazle willing to be sold has a bright pink stripe down the center of their tail. They don’t look particularly pleased.
“Must’ve,” another agrees.
“You know, I adopted someone into the House,” Hari tells Critter. “I can bring her here next time I visit, if you like.”
“That’s a freaking pool!” Draco huffs, “that’s not a bathtub, I swear.”
“Please get the black box from my nightstand,” he tells the elf. Dobby disappears for a moment, then returns with a black velvet box obviously for jewelry, but too large to be a ring or bracelet.
“Are all the guest rooms the same layout?”
“Oh, would you look at that,” Pansy jumps up, “it’s almost time to go listen to more speeches!” She claps her hands once, grinning brilliantly. The group laughs at her antics and follows her from the room.
“So, how was the rest of the break we didn’t see you for?” Pansy asks, watching over Hari’s shoulder. Draco’s hand vanishes from his waist for a moment, probably to push her away a little, since she retreats almost immediately.
"Here, sir." Hermione answered meekly, still a bit shaken by their conversation.
"I don't know if I can do that. I mean, Ernie and I were together for a pretty long time. If I'm being honest with myself, I still kind of have feelings for him." Hannah admitted grudgingly, oblivious to the way Aria and Pansy exchanged similar sneers of irritated disgust at her words. When neither of them chose to say anything, Hannah sighed again and lowered her gaze, staring glumly at her hands.
right on her back, just below her left shoulder blade, effectively knocking the Slytherin Seeker off her broom.
person I've ever met. Oh and plus, he lets me copy off his History homework too so I like him." He added, grinning at her.
"Good morning." He teased, tapping her lightly on the tip of her nose. "Did you sleep well?"
no matter what kind of uniform you have on." He spat.
Unfortunately, it didn't seem to work because when he tried to part her legs even wider, Aria gave out a startled squeak and, reacting in a way that was probably born out of feminine self-preservation, she instinctively tried to snap her legs back shut.
"You silly veela."
of the Slytherins flinched at hearing the Dark Lord's name.
Narcissa's smile widened, and her eyes grew soft as she studied the forlorn expression on his face.
A part of him was still convinced that Aria had only extended the mating call to him out of pity — or worse, that heroic tendency of hers that made her save every poor soul she came across. But another part of Draco
"Hand over that notebook." Aria warned.
She rushed into his arms, linking her hands around his neck and greeting him with a warm, eager kiss on the lips.
"Expulsion?" Corner scoffed at the self-assurance he heard in her voice and shook his head. "You don't have
, around hers as though he actually thought she was going to pull away.
"I don't have a good feeling about this." Pansy whispered nervously, flinching when she accidentally stepped on a large twig on the ground.
"Are you done?" He drawled.
"I think you're beautiful in whatever form you're in." He said softly.
Sŷlleiníea.
"Seven would be perfect. I'll wait for you outside your Common Room." Draco answered, struggling to keep from flinching when he felt Pansy kicking his shin under the table.
"Hey you."
Blaise shrugged at her and turned back to the rest of the dishes in front of him.
"Luna Lovegood."
." She answered in a calm, assertive voice.
She cleared her throat loudly, breaking Draco out of his trance as he blushed and hastily looked away, pretending to busy himself with checking the ingredients in their baskets. Aria ignored the rapid pounding of her heart as she scooted closer to the fire and wrapped her arms around herself for warmth.
The worker helps Hari pick out a simple necklace with a small cobalt pendant on the end. Draco doesn’t look pleased when he sees it, but he hands over the thin chain he’d found. It’s silver with a cobalt embedded in the clasp.
“Well, I could have left the seats empty,” Hari admits, “but there’s someone who is very politically powerful who was attempting to use me as a puppet. I chose to claim my seats in order to see to their downfall personally.”
“I like this way better,” Draco says, admiring one of the paintings.
“It is,” Hari agrees.
“Mango,” Draco looks at the kneazle sternly, “sorry, but you can’t join us. No fur in the library.”
“I call for the doors to be sealed,” Dumbledore says, tapping his wand on the podium once everyone is seated.
“I will acknowledge that you to were very close before and definitely cuddled, but this is more than that,” Blaise waves a hand in their general direction, “so what changed?”
“Sorry, I just didn’t think there was anything you could do…” Hari casts a quick cushioning charm at her shoes.
The bird has smooth brown feathers on top, only broken by the few slight, pure white spots. His underbelly is practically cream because the white and brown blend so seamlessly. With big golden eyes surrounded by a face that looks like it was painted, the small owl truly is a handsome bird.
“Lord Potter,” the eighth person that day bows to him. They’ve been in Diagon Alley for about ten minutes. Thankfully, not everyone feels the need to bow, but enough do that it is slightly uncomfortable. Or wholly uncomfortable. Okay, it’s wholly uncomfortable.
“They will come,” Critter says and snaps his fingers twice. The kneazles slink away from the walls and there’s nearly a hundred around him. “The mama and the newborns is not coming.”
Hari freezes and stares up at Draco. They both sit back up slowly, studying each other. Hari knows he doesn’t look scared, just curious and slightly nervous.
“We need a better communication system than house elves,” Hari sighs.
The final rounds of voting that day go the way Hari had anticipated: Lucius traps the moderate blood-purists into voting for Madam Bones by voting up an extremist. With Hari, the Ministry, and the majority of the Wizengamot moderates voting for her, Madam Bones wins by a landslide.
“Good morning, Miss Granger,” Hari greets and holds out his hand. They clasp wrists. “Please, call me Hari.”
“You could probably change that,” Draco offers.
“What is Master Hari wanting?”
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Count of House Gaunt, by Right of Conquest. So mote it be.” The last of the green magic swirls around him, then fades away.
“You want her for our group?” Daphne asks.
They’re silent for a while, considering Hari’s point.
Critter opens the study doors and turns back to Hari, “Lord James is not using the study often and it is being dirty, so Critter is cleaning and organizing when Critter is hearing Master Hari is coming back.”
Draco snorts, “no. But that’s beside the point. The point is that the carriage will drop us off where all the other students are. We’ll need to walk to the restaurant.”
Hari opens it slowly, revealing a silver pocket watch. It has a ring consisting of each of his house stones around the face and an engraving of the Potter crest, but is otherwise simple. It suits him to a tee, Hari thinks.
“’Mia didn’t come back with you?” Pansy asks, looking disappointed.
“I must say, you made some waves taking Miss Granger under your protection,” Theo says, taking a small bite of ice cream. “You’ll be getting requests to introduce her soon enough.”
Her gaze darts to the window, “well, I don’t know about that…”
“I did,” Hari grins, “guess they’re good for something after all, huh?”
Hari pulls on the outfit and spells his hair into a classic, slightly messy bun. He picks make-up that makes him look slightly older than he really is. The staff might know his age, but appearances still matter psychologically. If he looks older, they’ll be more likely to treat him as older.
They head down to the floo room, waiting for Hermione to arrive. When she does, she stumbles across the floo and Hari catches her before she can fall.
“My apologies, Lord Potter, I should have been watching where I was going.” Hari tilts his head before replying.
“Where are you most comfortable?” Hari thinks for a moment, then grins.
“No, you haven’t. But, how do I…” Hari trails off, not really sure where the question was going.
“They’ll find him,” Draco pauses. “They’ll find both of them. Madam Bones is spectacular at her job and the Auror program has only gotten better since she took over.”
“Nothing’s a guarantee, Draco,” Hari leads them into the store for Dueling robes, “so you’ll just have to do your best.”
He hurries off towards where he’d last seen Daphne and she catches his arm, looping her own through it, and guides him to the balcony, where they can talk without being accused of anything untoward.
“I’m certain.” Lucius leads the way to the Entrance Hall. “I wish you the best of luck with your next meeting. May you persevere beyond their resistance to change.”
“And your obstacles fallen,” Hari and his friends echo back, rising to offer bows of their own. Maybe their plan to implement the sayings as their usual greeting had fallen through, but they’d all memorized the general procedure.
“True,” Hari nods. They enter the Headmaster’s office. Hari strides to the desk and rifles around until he finds the Building Plans parchment. Pointing his wand at it, he declares the changes he needs Hogwarts to make and feels a slight shudder in the castle as he does it.
They walk down to the floo room and Hari holds out his hand. Once everyone has a finger on it, he announces, “
“We’ll be fine,” Draco agrees.
“Welcome,” Hari replies and takes his seat at the head of the table. “Where would we like to begin today?”
“Would you please notify Andromeda Tonks that she has been hired by Hogwarts and should arrive for the staff meeting in an hour? Thank you.” Critter pops away to deliver the message.
“You both look quite nice tonight,” Lady Longbottom praises. Hari is in his new
“How did I not notice that?” Hari asks in almost a whisper.
“Please,” Hari beams at her, “call me Hari. And you as well, Heir Longbottom.”
“No, you changed that rule at the last meeting,” Draco reminds him, “since owls are used for communication, they don’t count as a pet.”
“You’re right,” he says, “I should go. It’s important and could impact too many lives, including Remus’.”
It was beginning to do this after dropping Arithmancy that taught Hari that Professor Snape is not the cruel teacher he seems to be to the younger years. After OWLs, he has students who really want to be in his class. He loses the harsh attitude and takes the time to ensure they’re learning and enjoying the class as much as possible. Although, some of the students had commented that Professor Snape was more relaxed this year… Maybe that’s because he’s got more free time.
“Let’s go get you something to eat. I’m sure that made you hungry,” Draco says and snuggles him close.
Sirius takes Hari’s hand and Hari port-keys them back to Grimmauld.
Almost immediately upon their arrival, there’s the pattering of excited feet.
Hari rises and lets his voice fill the chamber, “I request that for the crimes of child neglect, child abuse, kidnapping, theft, and attempted line theft, Chief Warlock Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore be arrested and tried by the high court of the Wizengamot.”
“So, I have about forty five minutes instead of a half hour. I’m still leaving in a half hour, though. I need to meet with the Hogwarts elves.” He makes his way into the sitting room. “I still enough time for breakfast. What’re we having?”
Hari tunes Lord Crabbe out. Personally, he doesn’t think it’s a good idea to make a Lord or Lady the Chief Warlock. At most, it could be a scion of a House. Preferably, it would be someone not of a House and therefore lacking loyalties.
The Ministry members take up the whole of the right side. Noble houses are in the first row. The next several rows are Ancient and Noble Houses. The fifth and sixth rows are Most Ancient and Noble Houses. There is a small section of eight seats in the center of the sixth row, slightly separated, where the Founding Houses are. At the very top is a secluded area with only four chairs which look more like thrones. They are for the dead lines of Merlin and Arthur.
Draco preens, “my hair is perfect, isn’t it?” Leave it to him to conveniently not hear the key word in that sentence. Hari lets the subject drop.
This one's the end of the Wizengamot session and also a nice visit with Sirius.
“What all’s here?”
“Don’t forget Andromeda Tonks,” Draco chimes in, “although, she was officially disowned, so you’d have to find out if she would be willing to be accepted back and I’m not sure she would be.” Hari blinks at Draco until Draco sighs and says, “she didn’t have a great experience as a member of the House of Black. Not only did they disown her, she disowned them.” Hari hums in acceptance of this explanation.
“Oh, nargles got those, too,” Luna reveals calmly. Hari glances at Hermione, who shakes her head slightly, indicating she’d never heard of them. “They don’t like me very much. I’ve yet to see a crumple-horned snorkack yet and I’ve heard they’re kind and I’m sure they’ll like me.”
“You should have your own owl, too,” Hari muses, “and I think I have more port-key jewelry in my vaults. I’ll have to get you a few of those. Especially for Grimmauld Place, since Sirius is going to be my guardian.”
I won't be back with another chapter until book three is done being written. There's not much left that needs to happen to bring this to a relatively good ending, so bear with me. It'll be a few weeks at most.
“Yes, Young Master Draco.” The house elf pops away.
Draco knocks gently on the door. Hari pauses, counting to ten before opening the door. Draco’s eyes skim over Hari, looking him up and down in a smooth movement.
“I can sense her,” Critter says, “but she is not calling Critter.”
“They allow thirteen-year-olds in your government?”
“Well done, Ajay!” There’s cheers from his friends (
“That one sounds messier,” Lady Longbottom finally says.
“It’s quite a nice place,” Hari says. He scans the menu—they’ll make almost anything, a note at the bottom says, but their specialties are what is listed and they’d prefer customers stick to that. Hari looks over the listings.
“Welcome, Lord Potter,” the Board says, rising and bowing as one.
“Well, we have a house elf,” Hari says, “two, since there’s also Kreacher, but I need him to take care of Sirius.”
“While you work on Muggle Studies, Hari and I’ll research for Potions and History respectively,” Hermione adds, “And then, if there’s still time, we can pick up a book on red oak. Or even just find the title.”
“No, most people don’t,” Draco tells him, “most people just apparate wherever they need to go.”
“Oh,” Draco starts laughing and almost chokes. “That was the best thing I’ve seen all summer.”
Hari frowns, “I’m not sure that’s a great idea.” When the elf goes to protest, Hari holds up a hand, “I don’t mean that in the sense that I don’t think you can manage it. You are certainly more than capable. But I’d rather have that set up as an emergency system. If every student knows how to summon you, they’ll be calling all the time. And while it doesn’t sound like a bad thing that they’d be able to, it could end up being a detriment to their learning.”
“Just keep using the cute to your advantage and it’ll all go swimmingly,” Daphne promises, patting Hari gently on the hand. Hari rolls his eyes but is grinning wildly on the inside. Hey, if it works…
“That’s why I’m concerned,” Draco huffs. “And irritated with Father. He knows your reasoning, understands it, and even agrees with it! He didn’t put forward a name!”
“She’s pureblood,” Draco mutters, “and I know I’ve heard her name before…” Hari leans up and kisses Draco on the cheek.
they here?” Hermione asks.
“You’re the only other member of any of my Houses except for Sirius,” Hari explains, “Technically, if Draco were disowned or Narcissa got a divorce, they would be House of Black, but they’re officially part of House Malfoy.”
“The motion is carried,” Lady Fawley announces.
“I’ll stay here. It’s less than a month until school, after all, and we’ll see each other at least once a week for Wizengamot sessions.”
“Dray, that’s not the problem right now,” Hari huffs, but reaches up and steals a kiss anyway. “How does being a Seer work?”
“Thank you,” she smiles up at him, embarrassed. Hari waves it off in favor of casting a freshening charm at her nice cobalt robes. “Ah,” she says when she sees him studying them, “the color is okay, isn’t it?”
“You’ll withdraw them,” Hari says in an angry monotone, “or I’ll have you up on charges so fast you can’t even say the word ‘Dementor’.”
“Well, the way she knew who we all were immediately and could tell the room was there without being told or seeing us leave it,” Draco lists. “She very well could be.”
“No,” Sirius shakes his head, “that would’ve broken when the Secret Keeper died, which was years ago.”
Hari huffs, “we need somewhere safe to stay for a few hours. I don’t want Dumbledore choosing to come after us right away and the other Manors need to be safeguarded before we go home.”
Draco takes this as his cue and steps forward, “Hermione, would you do me the honor of this dance?” He extends his hand to her and, after glancing at Hari, accepts gratefully.
“When will you be announcing your intent to try, uh, Oldie Moldie?” Pansy asks and the group blinks at her. “We haven’t given him a subtle nickname yet! And you knew who I was talking about.”
“Bye, Critter,” Pansy and Daphne chime and Blaise and Draco offer quick farewells, too.
Okay, this chapter. Warnings are: direct discussion of abuse. We start the process of ripping Dumbledoof to shreds here, so that's necessary. There'll be another chapter of this (sorry, it made more sense to split it), so you'll get that tomorrow. I apologize in advance for that chapter... Saying no more, please let me know what you think!
“It’s only a minute, Hari,” Hermione smiles, “I’ll be fine. I’ll just go find our seats.”
“Your father said he’d contact her for me,” Hari points out, “and everyone in the meeting wanted someone different and was really stubborn about their choice. I think, if it comes down to it, almost every Lady and Lord is going to vote for someone different.”
“Good, I’ll have Critter fix one up,” Hari pauses, “Don’t be surprised if he gives you the Heir’s study. Right now, I think you’re technically Heir Apparent.”
Sure enough, upon their arrival, Professor McGonagall pulls Hari aside to inform him that Fudge is there.
“I like it,” Draco announces smugly.
Her voice is drab and droning and it kind of makes Hari want to cut his ears off. The bill contains several factual inaccuracies. Lucius has arranged a series of comments to be made by different allies, culminating with Hari.
“Yes. It should be pre-cut,” Daphne nods, pleased. Hari takes the smallest piece he can find and Draco does the same. Within ten minutes, they’re loading up their plates at the dessert buffet.
“Really?” Pansy looks surprised, “my father did.”
Daphne comes down next and, in describing what it felt like to go get Draco, has Hari’s heart breaking for her.
“What’s Beasts and why is it mandatory?” Blaise grumbles. “I already opted out of Care.”
“No,” Hari shakes his head, “she’s going straight home after the Ball. Her parents weren’t too pleased at how late she’d be out tonight.”
He needs a pensieve, just to relive that kiss over and over. If they could have chosen to never leave that moment…
“Alright,” Hari says, the corners of his lips twitching as he realizes Draco was thinking about the two of them living here someday. “Let’s go see the creatures.”
“So… a small helping of that chicken looking stuff?” Hari asked.
“No,” Draco shakes his head vehemently, “less than that. Far less. I either have a sinking feeling around someone or a good feeling around them. That’s it.”
Hermione sighs and puts the books back, “I’ll have to let Professor McGonagall know.”
“Lord Potter,” Neville spots them first.
“Sir?” A worker approaches. “I apologize, but I overheard some of what you said.”
“What happened?” Draco jumps up and grabs Hari as soon as he’s back in the compartment. He pulls him down onto his lap again.
“That sounds great.”
Aight, chapter two! It's up! Chapter fourteen is mostly written... It needs a little bit of work, but I don't feel bad posting this now, so here. I'm just trying to integrate the new friend appropriately and it is harder than I thought it would be.
“Anyone want to tell me how so many people know I’m Heir Hogwarts but haven’t figured out I’m the new ‘Headmaster’?”
“It’s me,” Draco murmurs, “meaning I’m specifically the person you
“You ask him, that’s actually a good idea,” Draco starts to smile, then scowls. “Hey! You tried to distract me! I’m still angry!” Hari sighs. Well, it had almost worked, at least.
Hari nods back in the way Narcissa taught him and sits. The other nobility follow, sitting in a ripple effect based on the primacy of their Houses. The Ministry officials have stayed seated through it all.
“Lucius, Narcissa, you both look wonderful,” Hari tells them, smiling sweetly. Narcissa offers a small smile of her own in thanks while Lucius replies in turn. Hari takes in Draco’s sleek charcoal robes embroidered in silver. He looks incredible, but for some reason, Hari cannot get the words out of his mouth. He glances around instead.
On the door is a glittering sign inscribed with her name in flowing calligraphy. She looks at him quizzically and opens the door. Inside, the sitting room is done in warm neutrals with soft spots of pale colors.
“Guys, you have to see the closet,” Blaise calls. They walk over and see a room larger than what Hari’s bedroom at the Dursley’s was. The center has four extra walls that reach to the ceiling and are layered with shelves and drawers for shoes and jewelry. Drawers along the outer walls have slots for ties and pocket squares and socks.
“Not helping,” Draco snaps at Pansy.
“You still have my new measurements on file, yes?” Hari asks. Mr. Lazwell confirms that he does. “Would you be able to make me a set or two of
“We’d like two butterbeers, please,” Draco starts innocently. “To start, we’ll take a serving of calamari. For the main course, I’ll have the wild mushroom ragu pasta and he’ll have the beef Wellington, medium. We’ll have two sides for the table. Cream corn and your mashed potatoes. We’ll take dessert menus after our meal.”
“We now know this person did this intentionally, that they knew the home would not be safe for me. I will explain why they made this decision later, but for now, let me explain the dangers of living in that house. Both Potions Master Snape and Cursebreaker Weasley informed you that the cupboard under the stairs was indicated as my bedroom. For those who don’t know, a cupboard under the stairs is where you keep unwanted items. Where else would you put an infant you don’t want? That cupboard was my room for ten years, until my letter to Hogwarts arrived.
“I look forward to seeing you both at the Ball,” Lord Nott bows to Hari and slips back into the crowd.
Hari adds, “Due Friday: six inches on the medical revolution of 1382, re-reading chapter six for Defense—we have the practical that day—and six inches for Professor Snape on how powdered Dragon’s Tooth interacts with stewed slug. Electives, we need to re-read chapter two of Healing, write four inches for Wandlore on the properties of red oak, and for those of you in Arith and Care, you’ve got the paragraph on page 84 of Arith and reading chapter three of Care.”
“It’s tea time,” Pansy groans, leaning back in her armchair. Hari extracts his hand from Draco’s and snaps twice.
“We elveses are not being busy, Heir Hogwarts. We elveses are being bored.”
“We should talk about this,” Draco says, pulling Hari a little closer for emphasis, “after the Ball.”
“Wait—so, like Luna’s dad?” Hari looks up at Draco from the corner of his eye.
“Did you see his reaction to your rings?” Draco giggles.
He reaches his seat and all the other Lords, Ladies, and Heirs stand as one to bow to him. The House of Potter isn’t the highest House in the chamber, despite its Primacy over the two Founding Houses, but his titles combined make him the most powerful person in the room. Hari supposes he shouldn’t be surprised that tradition will be a little warped and place him at the top of the hierarchy instead of the other way around.
“Exactly,” Hari agrees, “if she ever needs it, I’ll rally for her on the Wizengamot.”
“We literally spend all day together and we’re going to the same place.”
“No,” Hari shakes his head, “it wasn’t. But it was in the Charms Blueprints of Hogwarts that I found in Gryffindor’s vault.”
This chapter has Hari meeting with the professors and having some important discussions. Also, Draco. Need I say more?
“Alright,” he looks around at the crups, “Critter can you send off the ones over fifteen?” When the smaller grouping is left, Hari announces, “many of you will be going to new homes. I want to check that you are alright with this.” There’s some barking, but in general, they don’t seem upset. “Good. I will strive to find the most loving of homes for all of you.”
“Luna?” Hari asks gently, “Pansy and Blaise are already inside. You could’ve knocked.”
“It may also be a good idea to encourage an enforced group-study,” Lady Longbottom suggests, “so that scions and their peers interact more.”
“No, there really isn’t,” Hari smiles at Draco. Draco just watches him for a long minute. Hari sighs and realizes Draco is waiting for an answer.
“Hari, we might have to tell my parents I’m spending the night,” she calls and runs over to inspect a window seat, “this place is spectacular.”
“About the dormitory changes? It was on the same page?”
“That was a pleasant surprise,” Draco grins, wrapping an arm around Hari.
“It looks like a more formal version of the common room,” Daphne points out.
“This new schedule is so much easier,” one of the seventh years sighs as they arrive at the classroom.
“You know,” Draco chuckles, “it just hit me, but couldn’t you have transformed and asked the cat?”
“How have you been?” Remus asks.
“Quit being a baby,” Draco rolls his eyes, “go shower and I’ll get you an outfit. Some combination of red and green that won’t make you look like an ugly Christmas decoration.”
“I’m just going to change into Beau,” Hari decides.
“Thank you.”
“Alright,” Hari turns to Draco, “we’re off to meet your mother. I’ll see you at the session.”
“May I ask your name?” Hari says tentatively.
There’s a pause and Draco sighs, “I hate you.”
of the pacing, but you'll understand when you read it.) I understand that it's going to be frustrating for everyone reading this series, but it's probably going to be a hefty wait. I don't want to post as I write in case I need to go back and make changes later. My current plan is to re-write all of book one before posting it again, then do the same for the other two, because I probably won't make changes to previous works once I've finished them.
The cat races to Hari when Critter sets him down.
“Master Tomeaxe,” Hari replies and re-takes his seat. There’s murmurs going through the chamber. Maybe it would have been wise to not indicate that he could be the one the goblins are here on behalf of, but if it puts him on good footing with the solicitor, it’s worth it.
“Do.”
“What time is your meeting?” Draco makes his way back into the room, fully dressed in casual day robes. His hair is parted neatly to one side, short bangs falling across his forehead. Hari definitely does
Hari puts the finishing touches on Hermione’s hand, puts the tube away, and casts the charm to protect it. Settling back into Draco, he looks at Hermione.
“You all probably know where this all begins. The night my parents died. As you all know, my parents intended for my legal guardian to be my godfather, Sirius Black, who, at the time, was Heir Black and an accomplished Auror and Hit Wizard. Had their will been read, been opened by anyone, this would have been public knowledge. In fact, their will contained the true information about their Secret Keeper and the person who performed the Fidlius Charm for them. Said person is the one who placed me in the house I would live in for the next ten years.
“It was,” Hermione agrees.
“You can be Secret Keeper for one of my other properties,” Hari promises and then waves Hermione over.
“Thank you,” Hari nods and slips past, searching for Draco in the hallway.
Professor Snape smiles at this, “Well, I have it on good authority that the new Headmaster will never allow something like that to happen again.”
At the Manor, Hermione is sitting in the floo room, shoes off, while Narcissa insistently waves her wand over them. It only takes a minute and one or two spells before Hermione’s feet are back to normal.
“She may never see them,” Draco agrees, “but she’ll find her own version of ‘good’.”
After a delicious lunch, they swing by the jewelry shop Narcissa swears by.
“Professor Snape, I realize this puts you at somewhat of a disadvantage,” Hari tilts his head apologetically, “if you have suggestions for how to combat this, please arrange a meeting with me.”
“Before we eat,” Lucius draws a small box out of his pocket, “there is one last gift.”
“Hari?” Sirius’ head peeks out over the railing. “How did the session go today?”
“What?” Hari clutches his book to him.
They have to stand and do nothing for ten minutes before the others get there—perfectly on time.
“Yeah, yeah, laugh all you want,” Draco rolls his eyes. His fingers thread through Hari’s and they lean into each other. Hari allows himself to relax and enjoy the moment.
“I thought that was obvious?”
“I’m going to show her the room downstairs,” he winks conspiratorially, “and then we will be ready for dinner. Is that acceptable?”
“’Mione,” Sirius murmurs to her, “take a few deep breaths for me. It will be alright. They’ll be sending Aurors out to find him and Hit Wizards to capture him. He won’t be free for long. Now, what we can do immediately is take care of protecting your home. Hari,” Sirius looks over his shoulder at Hari, “you’re Fidelius-free. Care to join us?”
“Of course I did,” her chin lifts proudly, “my Alice was your godmother and Lily was my Neville’s godmother. Quite the inseparable pair, Alice and Lily.” She looks at him, concerned. “I was very troubled to hear what had happened to you,” Lady Longbottom tells him, “should you ever like to know more about your mother, I believe I have some stories you may enjoy, and even some photographs.”
“Can Dementors get through the wards?” Hari peeks out the window again, studying the terrifying creatures.
“Hence, a voracious appetite.”
“And why, Lord Potter, did you deem it necessary to infiltrate my class?”
After loading up their plates, they sit and start to discuss the morning.
“Hence, we went shopping.” Hari smiles, “don’t worry, I’ll try to pick out things that won’t stand out. If it means making a new port-key, then so be it.”
“One at a time, I think,” Hari suggests and steps through to the enclosed area first. He bows to what appears to be the hippogriff in charge and, sure enough, after a few long seconds, the whole herd bows back. He rights himself and approaches, slowly extending his hand to pet the one in charge. “Hello,” he says softly, “my name is Hari. I’m the new Lord Potter. Has your herd been doing alright the last twelve or so years?”
“He’s guaranteed not to take issue with you,” Hari tells her, “since our usual group hasn’t arrived yet.” They had gotten ready at Potter Manor—making Critter ecstatic—but that meant they were cut off from the rest of the group and couldn’t coordinate arrival times.
As for this chapter--do I need to say anything? You all know what's coming.
“Oh, how wonderful,” Hari mutters sarcastically and rips through some chicken.
“I don’t like that,” he mutters, “and I didn’t like how surprised she was at our asking her name.”
“I’m sure they make masculine versions,” Blaise says.
“When you meet the hippogriffses, you should be looking them in the eye and bowing. They is bowing back and then you is approaching.”
“Yes, you should have,” Draco sniffs and starts to walk out of the room, “because now you don’t get cuddles.”
Professor Snape thinks on this for a minute, recalling her odd tendencies, before replying, “I will inform her Head of House. If I must, I will assign a false detention to assess her.”
“There has,” Hari agrees slowly, “but there is only one.”
“My spot is this way,” Hari says and turns, heading up one flight of stairs. He leads Draco the long way, circling the balcony. One of the windows curves out of the wall on this floor, creating almost a small room. It even has curtains on it. Additionally, portions of the window are solid panes stained glass, in each color of the rainbow, making it incredibly beautiful. When they get there, Critter’s treats for them are already sitting on a low tray in the center of the massive seat.
“What exactly constitutes a sealed case?” she asks.
“For what?” Draco asks.
“Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of it, then?”
“There you have it,” Draco murmurs, “the cat’s name is Mango.”
“That’s true,” Hari agrees, “it’s my turn to take the notes.”
“But what are you going to do if you’re the only one to nominate her?” Draco asks.
“Lord Potter,” she comes out of the bow and turns slightly, bowing again. “Heirs Malfoy, Greengrass, Parkinson, and Zabini.”
“Mother, Hari and I are going to spend the night at his Manor,” Draco looks pleadingly at Narcissa, “is that alright?”
They make their way outside and Hari gently taps Narcissa’s arm.
“You’re welcome,” Lucius nods. “A bit of forewarning, though. Now that your Lordship and many titles have been announced, many of the Lords and Ladies have taken it upon themselves to send you gifts. Each has been inspected thoroughly for safety, but you should expect to write a significant number of thank you letters.”
“I can,” Professor Flitwick assures him and draws his wand, waving it over the pile. About a quarter of the papers separate out. They split again by House and Flitwick sends them to the appropriate Professor.
“You’re so kind and caring and you’ve built this family around you despite everything you’ve been through,” Draco finishes. “You’re honestly incredible and beautiful, inside and out.”
“We’re young,” Hari says, “I’ll bet, with a bit of time, you’ll figure it out. And in the meantime, we can see if we can’t get the two of you to spend some time together. I mean, just to see how you click. And maybe it’ll get him to notice you back.”
“I don’t have the time to learn the way you do,” Hari points out, “I had a year and a half to learn everything, and even then, I had to be taught in secret.”
“I will see that you receive information on them,” Hari promises. He turns back to the room at large. “Now that that’s done, I have an announcement. Hogwarts will be returning to the proper use of wix etiquette. This includes titles, Family Suites, and permission for students to greet each other properly.” He pauses to let this sink in and sees several teachers flinch. “I should reassure those of you with little exposure, teachers have high respect within the rankings of wix hierarchy. None of you would be expected to bow to a student. I simply request that you refer to them by their proper title.”
“Exactly,” Professor Snape nods. “Are you prepared for the first Hogsmeade weekend?”
Draco will appreciate the silver, being his House color. Hari adjusts the chain of his necklace, tucking the pendant carefully under his shirt collar. With just his bangs braided back and his make-up done in an understated manner, he crosses to the door to wait for Draco. Draco insisted he would pick Hari up before they left—together—for Hogsmeade.
“Did you just purr? As a human?”
“The brevity makes them much more accessible,” Luna agrees, “and prevents nargles from setting in mid-way.”
Hari stands and transforms then.
“We are?” Hari studies her curiously.
Draco’s fear of the unknown as he ran to Professor Snape causes Hari’s hands to tremble. He can see the tears shining in Draco’s eyes, but he doesn’t let any fall.
“Then we must hire that person,” Professor McGonagall points out.
Hari stares for a long moment, “they’ve got undetectable Extension Charms, then?”
to dance with, over anyone else in this room?”
“I’m stopping in at Potter Manor to drop off the file and look over some of the information.” He studies her for a moment, “You’re welcome to come with me if you like. I was planning on having dinner at Malfoy Manor, but we can let them know we’ll be eating elsewhere.”
“Hari,” Hermione whispers, sounding choked up, “this is too much. Thank you.” She throws herself at him for a hug. “Where’s Critter?” She scans the room and finds him standing to the side, grinning happily. She scoops him into a hug as well. Critter squeaks.
“Thank you, ‘Mione,” Hari grins at her. She hugs him much more calmly than Draco had. Draco still looks slightly upset when she pulls away, but Hari’s not entirely sure why. He shrugs internally. Draco’s just weird sometimes. “If you give me two minutes, I can figure out how to take you under my protection and then we can get to the presents.”
“I will, I promise,” Hari assures him.
Umbridge finishes spouting her lies and Lord Goyle stands.
“Family Suites?” They take a quick minute to explain the Family Suites to Hermione while dropping off their measurements to Madam Malkin. Hari sneaks up and pays for Hermione before she notices.
“How dangerous is this man?”
“Oh,” Draco whispers, face opening up and brilliantly happy, “Oh, sweetheart. Hari,” he reaches out and tilts Hari’s chin up to face him with one finger, “thank you.”
“Sorry for the trouble, Professor Snape,” Hari apologizes.
Draco’s smile becomes slightly sad, “I will.” Hari offers the book and feels somewhat guilty.
“I forgive you, too,” Draco says. “Don’t let it happen again, please. I was really scared. I thought you’d been taken or killed or Dumbledore had gotten to you.”
“And I suppose in each and every one, you’ve succeeded in tearing someone apart?”
“Yeah, but now you’ve out grown almost all of it,” Pansy sighs, “so we’re going to have to buy you more.”
“Oh, but I thought that wasn’t complete since you’d still have changes to make…”
“Just now,” Hari confirms.
“Nope. Gotta carry you.” Hari pouts and drops his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
“Don’t forget that you have to go back to collect your materials,” Blaise warns. “We’re not required to.”
“You’re quite agile, aren’t you, Beau?” Draco rubs between his ears and the others offer pets and praise, too. Beau puffs up under the attention.
Amelia Bones, Head of the DMLE and currently leading the search for Dumbledore. Hari figures if Dumbledore finds out she took his position, he wouldn’t mind so much. They were known to be on fairly good terms, although now she is livid with him. And Hari’s not sure that Dumbledore is above killing, or at least maiming, whoever stands in his way. He’ll have to see about getting her a port-key somewhere safe. He’ll collect Sirius and take a trip to Gringotts later. Maybe they can make a day of it and go visit Remus, too.
Hari laughs at Draco’s antics, “yes, it truly is.” He beams at Draco.
“Yes, Master Hari.”
“Hari, it’s the Ministry,” Draco sighs, “the process for creating a port-key isn’t as difficult as they like to make it out to be, but it can’t be traced as easily as apparitioin or floo, so they put in all this red tape to make it harder to have access to. Just, answer the questions the best you can and lie if you need to. They don’t check and it won’t damage the port-key if you do.”
“I suppose we must go in,” she sighs, “at least something interesting should come of the goblins.” Hari glances to Blaise. Does she not know? But then, Hari supposes Lucius wouldn’t have told their allies everything. If one chose to flip, that would be far too much information they could leak.
“You got him a snake for Christmas last year, I dare you to top that,” Blaise drawls from the other side of the room. Pansy and Daphne snicker.
“Oh, thank you,” Hermione perks up.
Draco laughs, “we’ll ask Critter tonight.”
“You’re more relaxed,” Hari counters.
“That’s quite alright,” Sirius waves her off, “we’re just here to place a protective charm on your house.”
“Heir Hogwarts,” the elves snap to attention, turning to face him.
Professor McGonagall makes eye contact and flicks her gaze to the windows. Hari nods, letting her know that Fudge has been handled. The relief she feels is visible, even from this distance.
Hari bursts into hysterical giggles, “it will be on the agenda for the next session. Although, it’s labeled as something about goblins, instead.”
“No,” Hari glowers, “and I’m going to make whoever thought it was okay to try to go over my head very, very sorry.”
Draco hurries Hari through his nighttime routine and tucks him into the king size bed before bustling off to do his own obnoxiously long routine. Hari snuggles into the middle, warmth blooming from Draco’s care in the center of his chest.
Hari wonders about that slip up. Could he have meant ‘not yet’? That would imply he would one day be using it.
“I’ll see you around dinner?” Draco asks.
“The way you walk and move, especially after becoming and animagus, it’s so graceful and smooth. You move like a King, honestly.
Hari guides Hermione down to the library and, like in Beauty and the Beast, has her close her eyes before guiding her to the center of the room.
“But I’m technically Headmaster,” he tells her, “and
“Port-keys aren’t much better,” he warns her.
“Call me Hari, honestly, Heir Greengrass,” he sighs, then smiles at her.
“Thank you,” Hari knows he’s blushing and laces his fingers together to hide their slight trembling. He looks Draco over. Rich green robes with a dark brown suit, a pale blue shirt, and matching green tie and pocket square. The robes are shaped more like Wizengamot robes—slightly more flared than typical—and his suit is more fitted than he’d usually wear. His eyes, somehow, stand out more than usual, even though Hari cannot see any more make-up than normal.
“I think you are lacking discipline, Miss Umbridge,” Hari snaps at her, brushing off his shoulder from where it hit the wall. “Most people apologize when they run into someone.”
“Miss Hermione,” he cries happily, “Critter is being very happy to see you.”
“That’s a good thing?” Hermione sounds confused.
Draco smiles gently at that, “have you remembered its name yet?”
Hari glances up at Draco before replying. “I didn’t even know about magic until my letter came. The books are a gross misrepresentation of myself and an attempt to capitalize off my fame. Someone signed off on it and I want that person handled.” There’s a glint in his eye and the witch takes note of it.
“I know. The problem is that I’m going to lose the ability to play the childhood innocence card in just a few years.”
“Who?” He asks once the door is closed.
“Right,” Hari nods and straightens his tie once more, “I’m ready.” They walk down to the floo room just in time; Hermione steps out moments later.
“She’s my cousin,” Draco says. “We’ve never officially met, but we’ve spoken in passing. Nice girl. A little crazy. She was in Hufflepuff. It’s the only reason I don’t look down on them.”
“Blaise, Pansy, you’ll be late if you don’t go now,” Hermione calls and the two jump up, running from the room with absent ‘thank you’s’ yelled over their shoulders. Hari chuckles at them.
“Does it matter which way it goes?” Hermione asks. “Or are we pretty much looking at guaranteed punishment?”
“Of course, Critter,” Hermione smiles. Critter pops out after a few more happy exclamations.
“There you are!” Draco stomps over when Hari steps out of the floo. “You didn’t even bother to tell me you weren’t coming back! I had to find out from Father!”
“I figure we could keep our purchases in it and then split them up at the end of the day.”
“Great,” Hari grins, “The last thing I’d like is permission to create a station in each common room where students can get snacks while studying or at night.”
“Is Master Hari wanting anything else?”
“I’m going to have to stop Quidditch,” Hari says sullenly. “So I don’t need to stop for that.”
“Okay,” he raises both hands when it looks like everyone is turning red, “let’s be logical about this. Right now, there’s far too many scions of Houses to place all of them in private rooms. However, we could separate scions and typical students within the dormitories themselves. Heirs and such would be allowed access to the private suites their families invested in.”
“Dray,” Hari starts, “I don’t know where to start? What are we even talking about?”
At the shop, they spend nearly a half hour debating over which bags to get. Hermione’s is a gorgeous maroon over-the-shoulder bag with bronze detailing. Blaise decides to go with a metallic style and gets a bronze bag with black etching of the same style. Draco gets his in a soothing gray dragon leather with silver etchings. Pansy’s and Daphne’s look more like purses. Pansy’s is a sweet, blush pink with gold detailing and Daphne’s is a baby blue with silver detailing. Hari ends up getting an over-the-shoulder bag, as well, in black leather with blue and green etchings and silver clasps.
A young, tall (for his species), and powerful looking goblin rises and strides to the center of the floor. He bows to the Wizengamot, “may your gold have grown.”
“You remember when I said how your titles are the reason you’re going to rule the world?” Pansy asks. The group nods. “I was wrong. Your cuteness and absolute savagery are the reasons you’re going to rule the world. This whole Lordship thing just gives you a stepping stone.”
“You’ve brought friends.” She studies Sirius doubtfully.
“Of course,” Draco promises, “always.”
“Okay. Be careful, don’t touch anything, and watch your step,” Blaise warns, “I wouldn’t put it past a Slytherin to have this whole place swarming with traps.” They huddle close together and peek into the first door.
“I noticed,” Hari whispers.
“Fair enough,” Blaise nods, “if I went, he probably wouldn’t want to tell me.”
“Lord Potter,” a tall, dark man bows politely before carrying on to Pettigrew.
“I’m glad,” Hari walks into the room, “I have a feeling I’ll be using this room a lot.” There’s a section with a coffee table, two arm chairs, and a settee. The bookshelves are built into the wall and directly facing the far East wall is the desk. Well, Hari calls it a wall, but it’s entirely made of windows. Cobalt curtains hang on either side, ready to be pulled at any moment. On either side of the desk stand two filing cabinets. “Critter, what are these?”
“Good,” Hari nods, “I will begin finding you new homes as soon as possible. Critter, I’d appreciate if you’d slow down breeding them until there is a more manageable population.”
Hari smiles at her, “that would be wonderful, thank you so much.” Hari extends a hand to her and they clasp wrists. “Lord Hari James Potter, at your service. Please, feel free to contact me if you ever need anything.” He pauses, then adds, “there’s wards to prevent fan mail from getting through, so be sure to address it to go to Gringotts, not Hogwarts, okay?”
“It’s not,” Hari frowns, “I don’t know why I was so upset about having to give it to you.”
“She will,” Draco nods reassuringly, “she’ll understand and catch them and they’ll go on trial,” Draco promises, “and then we’ll be free of them for good.”
“That sounds delightful, Lord Potter,” Lady Longbottom replies with a smile.
“From this moment, let it be known, Hermione Jean Granger stands with Lord Hari James Potter in his House and under his protection,” Draco calls, setting a hand over their clasped ones.
“As for the masses, just let it be known that we’re dating, but no details—nothing about how we got together or when or anything like that,” Draco orders, staring Pansy down, “just the fact that we’re dating. That and our behavior should be enough.”
“I have more money than I know what to do with. Helping Hermione won’t even make a dent in it.”
Hari looks up, sniffs and wipes at his eyes, then tackles Draco and lets himself cry into his shoulder for a moment.
The others burst in suddenly, causing everyone to jump. Thankfully, Hari had yet to begin the design.
Hari laughs, “that I did. Let’s just make sure you’re added into the wards before you leave.”
“I’ll still be here in the morning,” he tells Hari. “I won’t leave you.”
“Are you ready to go, Lord Potter?”
“Let’s check out the books and clothing, then we’ll go to dinner,” Draco says and leans down to press a kiss to Hari’s cheek.
“They get into your head and cause bad thoughts.”
“I was informed by Draco that I am to rescue you if you are not home by dinner,” he tells Hari, lips quirking.
“Well, Father thinks that the only people who should be eligible to be Chief Warlock are Lords and Ladies,” Daphne explains, “and Madam Bones holds pretty different views than everyone in our alliance.”
I guess it's time for chapter information, now: Hari and Draco go on a date. So. Fluff, basically. Oh, and someone else makes an appearance. You'll see.
“Won’t your parents be upset with you ruining your appetites?” Fortescue frowns at them from behind the counter.
“That’s why you all arrive with a bit of an advantage,” Hermione rolls her eyes, “I can’t believe I didn’t factor that in. I just assumed you’d all already studied the theory at home and spent homework time practicing.”
Okay, I've been so excited to post this chapter and the next, you all have no idea. Oh, my gosh. Ahh. Screaming and cuteness. So here's what's in store: school shopping and the Fall Ball. And I'm freaking hard over the Fall Ball. I'll just say, 'you're welcome' in advance.
“Oh! Let’s do that!” Pansy jumps up, “we can still go to Fortescue’s after.”
“I’ll see you inside,” Theo says, gently dismissing them into the ballroom, “please, enjoy yourselves.”
“I think so,” Hari mumbles, embarrassed.
“Which means your vote wins automatically,” Draco breathes, eyes wide, “that’s brilliant.”
“Of course,” Pansy nods, “especially in Slytherin. Most of us were raised with politics that allow for young Lordship, but not the Headmaster thing.”
“I hereby vow to bring honor to my seats and Houses in my time serving on this esteemed body, as Lord Hari James Potter, Lord of House Potter, Baron of House Peverell and of House Black, Earl of Gryffindor, Duke of Slytherin, Heir Hogwarts, and Count of House Gaunt. This vow I shall keep, so mote it be.” The seats of each House he has claimed glow, then the layout of the entire room warps. He moves his eyes from Blaise to the location where the Potter seat will come to rest. It had taken quite a while for them to figure out how the magic would shift the room. It came down to some heavy estimations.
“Yes, Master Hari.” Good. He’ll have to ask about selling some of the crups, as well. There’s far too many and he doesn’t exactly plan on hunting.
“Remembering is easy for me,” Hermione says uncomfortably. Blaise backs off.
Greetings circle around the room and Andromeda smiles and nods at everyone.
“We’ll go walk around,” Blaise says and, waving goodbye, the three drag Draco off into the Alley.
Hey!! I'm back again! This is a little later than I planned to post but I literally fell asleep on my laptop last night, so... Yeah. That happened. Anyway, I feel like this fic is starting to wrap up. I was planning on having Dumbledore's trial in this one, but I might shift that to book four. There's already been a lot of action and I think trying to include it would just drag this one out too much. But we'll see. Ooh, and if anyone has name suggestions for an owl (preferably Indian in origin), please send them!!
“Don’t worry about formality,” Hari waves him off, “I’m sorry for yelling. I’m still shaken up from having a Dementor try to get into my compartment.” The conductor blanches at that, but Hari turns and walks back out, starting to make his way back to the group.
“There’s one more room,” Hari steps out of the doorway to let her cross to the final door. Her gasp lets him know everything he needs. The bedroom is deep shades of purple with accents of lavender and cream. There’s a large wardrobe, chest of drawers, and vanity along the walls but the bed itself takes up the majority of the room.
“Well, I’ll get the difficult one out of the way first,” Hari starts, “Hermione is a scion as I have extended her my House protections.” This draws some shocked looks from the teachers—excluding Professor Snape. “Aside from that, it should be indicated on their acceptance letter whether or not they are a scion. In simplest terms, the only students you need to check are those of half-blood or more.”
“Is she always like that, then?”
I made a little edit to the previous chapter for this one. Draco made a comment about always using titles at the Wizengamot sessions. I altered that a little so this chapter would make more sense. In terms of writing, it's going well! New friend: acquired!
“Then no, you can’t have your wand back.” Hari vanishes into the R.O.R and definitely doesn’t see Draco preparing to fling himself to the ground in a tantrum worthy of a two year old.
“The motion is carried,” Hari completes. Everyone takes their seats and Dumbledore sets his hands on either side of his podium, barring anyone from being able to see it.
“It was made for several reasons, including the need to aggregate funds to implement the new classes Hogwarts will be opening this year.” Hari leaves it there, not sure how Finch would react to finding out Hari had actually fired him out of personal dislike and companionship with the elves.
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Baron of House Peverell. So mote it be.” What, did they forget his father also held that title? The Peverell seat glows and the crest hovers in front of Hari, fading after a second.
They spend the rest of the evening giggling over random topics and only return to their houses when Critter pops in to ask if he should turn down the bedsheets for them or not.
“You don’t love me anymore,” Draco wails.
She straightens her robes, “as I’ll ever be.”
They enter the Lord’s suite and it’s nothing like what they expect. It’s massive and open, unlike the others which had separate rooms for everything. The bed is at one end, with a stunning sitting area in the center, and a small dining area to the right. Next to the bed are two doors, presumably to the bathroom and closet. Hari peeks into the bathroom.
“No,” Pansy all but wails, “Madam Malkin makes good quality, but mass produced school robes that are designed to grow with you for the school year. Mr. Lazwell makes high-quality robes designed for appearance. He’s up on all the latest fashions and has the best materials.”
“I’ll have Father help you with the paperwork,” Draco drawls.
“That’s true,” Hari nods. “So no one has an issue with it… But what about marriage? And children? We need heirs.”
“The other option? You said something about summer?”
Draco rolls his eyes, “apparently, we’re all getting one. We’ll stop there last. I bet it’s from the trunk shop.”
“Oh, Uncle Sev is not going to be pleased,” Draco sighs.
“We’ll have to floo,” Hari says, “I don’t have a port-key to Diagon.”
“I have to say,” Hari grins, “I’m quite pleased.”
“And there’s no chance of her being bought off,” Blaise adds. “But certainly there’s the issue of her being part of the Ministry?”
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Earl of Gryffindor. So mote it be.” Shocked silence reigns in the room as red magic all but surrounds him. But he’s still not done.
) and he darts over. His paws land heavily on Draco’s shoulders, but the others prevent him from falling over. The wall probably helps, too.
“Lord Potter,” Lord Nott makes it to them first, “How good to see you.”
“Oh,” Daphne sighs and Blaise looks at Hermione, eyes wide in surprise, “that’s so sweet of you, Hermione.”
Dumbledore taps his wand at the top of the podium, “It is currently 12:00. The doors will seal again at 1:00.”
“Heir Zabini,” Hari tilts his head at his friend who straightens from his bow. “Call me Hari.”
“Sometimes they mix up or add vowels, too,” Draco adds. “You said the cat is a boy, right?”
“Thank you,” Hari sighs, “that could’ve been bad.” They share a look; they both know how he deals with crowds. Or rather, doesn’t. “Where is the Lady Zabini?”
“I’m afraid I cannot allow you to arrest me,” Dumbledore says, his tone truly apologetic. He whistles a short pattern and there comes a warbling cry from outside the doors. As soon as they open, Dumbledore raises his arms and clutches onto the talons of a swooping red bird. There’s a burst of flame and he’s gone.
“Good,” Hari replies, smiling as he takes another bite, “the Wizengamot sessions have been going well and I adapted the Hogwarts curriculum to be what the Founders originally intended. It’s a work in progress, but it’s progress. Oh, and I’m dating Draco.” He says the last bit with a little fear in his voice, but Remus just smiles over his shoulder at Hari.
He nudges Draco’s ankle and scribbles a little note.
“’Keep up with’ isn’t the same!” Draco whines, “that doesn’t guarantee wins!”
“Draco could read,” Pansy suggests, “or we could play Quidditch or go to Diagon.”
“Thirty years,” Critter tells him. Hari takes this to be an average and skims his eyes over the ones watching him warily.
“All those in favor of granting Lord Potter’s request.” There’s a pause and Dumbledore’s face goes white. “All those in favor of denying Lord Potter’s request.” The pause is brief this time. “Lord Potter’s request has been granted.” Off the bat, Dumbledore’s position as Chief Warlock has been stripped from him. Minister Fudge rises and takes Dumbledore’s spot at the podium.
“Draco, you should let your mother know we’re leaving,” Hari says and gets off his lap.
“You knew my mother?” Hari asks, blinking up at her innocently.
“I worked with Madam Pomfrey to devise a potions routine to improve the victim’s immune system and overall physical well-being. This routine consisted of one-time doses of throat, lung, and organ repairing potions, as well as daily nutrient, muscle growth, bone growth, reduction of organ damage, illness prevention, and general growth potions. In addition, the victim needed a muggle drink called Pediasure that is used for underweight children to ensure they get the calories they need twice a day. It took the whole school year before the victim was healthy enough to receive their vaccinations. It was only this past school year that they were able to stop drinking the Pediasure and, I believe, this summer that they reported they could eat a full meal without feeling sick.”
“Oh,” he snarls, “are they
“Thank you.”
“That’s not—“ Draco pauses, then turns to Hari. “Hang on, the robes we joked about looking like battle robes?”
“Ugh, more speeches,” Pansy groans.
Hari’s thoughts wander as he gets ready for bed. Luna Lovegood… sure, their names are somewhat well known, especially Hari’s, but Hermione’s isn’t. And how Luna knew that will be interesting to find out, Hari’s sure.
“No!” Hermione cries, careful not to startle the little guy, “he’s perfect and now I can send messages to my parents as much as I want!”
“I’m just surprised the muggleborns haven’t started to suspect,” Hermione admits.
It’s an ideal play area for either of Hari’s forms, but has been magically expanded to be more than large enough for Ajay to play, which is why Draco had him become Ajay. Ajay crouches and sniffs at the air before leaping forward and sprinting into the trees and foliage around him. Ajay just wants to creep around and jump out and pounce and then lounge next to the river he can hear off to the left.
“That’s alright,” Draco promises, “and it’s alright if you’re not sure how to react yet. You’ll get there. But look,” he jerks his chin slightly to the people around him, “no one looks angry or irritated or anything like that. They look impressed, because we’re both such good dancers.”
“Oh, but I can be the most powerful Lord alive,” Hari says sarcastically.
“That makes sense,” Hermione agrees.
They plan to take the carriage back to Hogwarts and set about walking back. They have yet to stop at Honeyduke’s, but the night is coming to an end and soon, the carriages will stop running.
“Because you’re tiny and cute.”
“I got all my clothes through their catalogue,” Hari confirms. “They really are incredible.”
“Draco, that doesn’t mean we have to be this early,” Hari argues. “We’re just going to have to stand there and do nothing until the others arrive.”
“And you’re sure… I mean, no one will have problems with our genders?” Hari tries not to flinch as he says this. He can hear Vernon in his mind, ranting about homosexuals and how they’ll ruin the world. Not much different from what he’d heard some people say about muggleborns, to be honest.
“Now,” Fudge says quickly, “let’s not be rash—“
“Alright,” Blaise slings an arm over Hari’s shoulder, “I can accept that. If I have to.”
“What was the thing about bowing?” Hermione asks when they’ve sat back down.
Draco’s smile could light the entire world. He brings his hand up to gently cradle Hari’s jaw in one hand, after slipping Hari’s glasses off and setting them aside, with the other hand pressing along Hari’s shoulder blade.
“What do we have today?” Blaise asks.
“They can’t be hurt by the train,” Remus sighs, “they’ll either move, or get out of the way after they’ve been hit.”
“Is Miss Hermione wanting anything?”
Hari sighs—the Umbridge lady is going up against werewolves again. Why werewolves? Who knows. She must have some kind of personal vendetta against them, since that’s the only reason Hari can feasibly come up with.
“Either way,” Pansy jumps in, cutting Hermione off, “the perp will lose a fair amount of public respect once revealed and that will help the victim.”
The Hufflepuff’s buddy holds out a fist and they bump, “you are the best buddy.”
“Wonderful.” Draco’s grin is cruel and Hari matches it without hesitation.
“I’ve given him an hour,” Hari replies, “if they’re not gone, I’m having him arrested. Then, Madam Bones can deal with them.”
“I picked Amelia Bones.” There’s a beat of silence before Daphne starts laughing.
“We planned for this, remember?” Blaise tells her and wraps an arm around her shoulders. “We go home tomorrow morning.”
“Did he attack you?” the first Auror asks.
“Oh, no you don’t,” Professor Snape sets him on the desk and bars his escape, locking the door with a flick of his wand. “Change back, now. You know it’s my free period and I know you’re not taking either Care or Muggle Studies.”
“I can’t believe my first time here I get to see an actual court case!”
Draco’s hands slide to Hari’s waist and pull him over to straddle Draco’s lap. He settles into the cradle of Draco’s crossed legs willingly. Closer than before, Hari sighs and relaxes, letting Draco lead the kiss and himself to just enjoy. He feels a soft rumble echo in his chest and realizes he’s purring.
Hari crinkles his nose. It doesn’t sound kind to sell the older ones, but Hari’s not really sure how long they live.
“Me, too!” Daphne adds.
“That’s such a pretty bag!” Daphne grins and starts poking at it.
“At this time,” Dumbledore says in a shaking voice, “I call for the doors to be sealed and this session to begin.” He walks up and takes his place at the podium for the Chief Warlock.
“Yeah, a little way’s back. Your great-grandmother was my great-great-aunt,” Tonks nods. “Dorea Potter. Fleamont’s mother. She was a Black.”
“Time,” Pansy calls and Hari casts a Tempus.
“Ugh, we still have four years,” Hari groans.
Hari blushes more, stuttering out a little, “y-yes.”
“I need to make a port-key to Hermione’s house for each of us,” Hari huffs. “Having to use a floo every time I want to go see her will get old quickly.”
“What does that mean?” Hermione asks, leaning forwards. This wasn’t in
“And your enemies crumble at your feet,” Hari and his friends chorus once more, earning odd looks.
“Hari!” Hermione darts over to give him a hug, “you’re here, too!”
“That makes sense,” Draco says, “if there’s less land, then land is more expensive. So they own a house that’s big by muggle city standards?”
“I trust you.” Once Hari is dressed in the threatening outfit, Draco waves his wand twice. The first spell drags Hari’s hair up in a series of braids that end in a low ponytail. The second is Hari’s make-up, which is sleek and dark this time. The liner around his eyes is slightly darker and his lashes as long as the previous session. His lips are darker, with the pink only as an undertone. There’s extra make-up, too, to make his cheekbones sharper and strip away some of his childish appearance. Hari studies his appearance in the mirror. The robes cling to him before widening at his waist and splitting open at mid-thigh. His trousers are more fitted than usual and his black formal boots complete the look. Overall, he looks rugged and somewhat dangerous.
“You don’t really have to pay for everything,” Mr. Granger tries to say, but Hari is already shaking his head.
Hari rolls his eyes again, “you know as well as I do your hair is perfectly fine. You use too strong of a spell for it to budge.”
This is a long way to say that I'm re-writing this. I love the concept and the friendships within it. There likely won't be many changes beyond pacing and stylistic choices. (Okay, I'm changing a
“It’ll show people you’re a part of his House, now,” Draco agrees somewhat enviously.
They also decide that the schedule the school has offered over the previous years is inadequate. There had been eight mandatory classes. Two—flying and Astronomy—were only taken twice a week outside of typical schooling hours. The other classes had been split unevenly across the days. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday would have four classes, while Tuesday and Thursday had two. This created an imbalanced schedule. They adjust so flying and Astronomy are only mandatory the first two years. With the new classes added, the schedule balances out to have four classes each day, with Astronomy and flying left as they were. For the upper years, this clears them to add more electives to their afternoon if they so wish, so there is no longer a maximum elective number, so long as you don’t go over the number of class periods in a week.
Back in the room, the laughter dies down after a minute and Draco stares at the door, sighing.
“Well,” Professor Snape leans against a table, “the free hours and established mealtimes definitely help.”
“Oh, right,” Draco draws his wand, “there’s a spell for that.” He readies it but Hari snatches the wand from his hand and stalks away.
“I assumed,” Hari sighs.
Dumbledore takes his seat once more and the steward’s staff taps against the ground. The sound of metal on marble rings through the Wizengamot room. Once the ringing fades, there is complete silence and the steward speaks.
“Spectacular,” Hari huffs and angrily takes a bite of chocolate cake. It’s moist and perfect and the frosting is divine. “Well, enjoy your extra half hour with the dessert table.” He glares at Draco who seems all too smug.
“I’m actually closer to three,” Pansy corrects, smirking at him. “You’re the baby of the group, here.” Hari glares.
“Mostly, I was just concerned about ever having to go into the muggle world and hide it,” Hari smirks at that, “but why would we ever need to?”
“At least it was several hundred miles from here,” Daphne points out. Some of the tension in the group does bleed out. “And he can’t apparate, since they’ll be tracking that.”
“Our government was founded by a thirteen year old,” Hari jumps in, “Arthur Pendragon. You’d know him as King Arthur of the Round Table. Our laws didn’t pick the age of thirteen arbitrarily, they picked it because of him.” Hari pauses to let that sink in, then adds, “It doesn’t happen often since wix live incredibly long lives and typically have large families. I just so happen to be the last person able to take the titles I’ve claimed.” He explains, “my parents were killed in the last wizarding war, when I was a year old.”
“Yeah, our cauldrons have to sit another day, anyway,” another agrees, “he can’t hurt anything.”
Hari knows his eyes must be shining with excitement and that he’s not masking it well, but he can’t help it.
“What?”
“Sure! I’ll just let my parents know,” Hermione says.
“If you’re sure,” Hari nods, then turns and makes his way back into the crowd. Thankfully, he’s already spoken to most of them today and doesn’t have to again.
“The left is being the paperwork of past Lords and Ladies,” Critter explains, “the right is being Master Hari’s paperwork.”
“Will the kneazles gather up if I call them?”
“Yes, please do,” Hari decides finally.
“After we get back tonight,” Hari nods sharply. “I want every, single Knut they’ve made off selling my name.”
“Ah,” she tries not to shift on her seat, “thanks. I just wanted to know more, though.”
“The population is being constant,” Critter informs him.
This place is smaller than Potter Manor, despite being a Founder’s primary residence. But, then again, Hari presumes most places will be smaller than Potter Manor. They may not have the absolute highest Primacy, but the House of Potter is one of the original families to be added to King Arthur’s Wizengamot, just days before the House of Peverell and the House of Black. In fact, the House of Potter was only preceded by two other Houses, along with the Founding Houses. The only reason the Founding Houses don’t have Primacy over the Most Ancient and Noble Houses is due to their not being nobility at the establishment of the government.
“Certainly, Lord Potter.”
There’s a long silence in the chamber before someone calls out, “we cannot just allow you to take a wix without knowing who you are requesting to arrest. You already stated they are in this room. Should we not be allowed to punish our own?”
Hari stands once more, “Perhaps I can shed some light on that, Lord Crabbe.” Lord Crabbe bows subtly in appreciation. “It is a flight of fancy from the muggle world that werewolves are vicious, dangerous killers. It is a trend in their novels that werewolves would consume human hearts to survive and that they are capable of transforming and changing others on nights other than the full moon. In some literature, this is only a partial transformation, while in others, they fully become wolves, like an animagus would.
Hari lets out an irritated hiss and jumps off the desk, changing easily. He folds his arms and pouts.
Smooth and sweet. Draco smells like candy, like he always does. Chocolate and tea and somehow like home.
She opens the door to the bathroom first, which is entirely white with soft green decorations. The next door she opens is to the little study room. The walls are entirely comprised of bookcases, which have been stocked with both muggle and wizarding literature, both fiction and educational. There’s no windows in the room, but the ceiling is charmed to look like the sky outside, just as the Great Hall at Hogwarts is. There’s a desk in the center of the room and a day bed, loaded with pillows and blankets in shades of blue, off to one side.
Hari laughs and takes a bite of food, “honestly,” he says after swallowing, “the whole werewolf thing was planned.”
“You plan to do all your work as a Lord here, don’t you?” Draco’s voice is teasing, but there’s a hint of sadness to it.
Edit:
We pick a new Chief Warlock here and there's some Hermione & Hari cuteness and also Draco (does that need any explanation?).
“What are you doing here?”
“Please do,” Hari agrees immediately,  turning his back to Draco. There’s the click of the box being closed and set to the side, then a gentle pressure of metal against his chest and neck. In an instant, Draco has the necklace clasped and settled around Hari’s neck. Hari turns back and automatically raises a hand to trace his fingers over it.
“Lord Nott, pleased to see you again,” Hari smiles, “I believe you’ve met my guest, Miss Hermione Granger.”
“Just one about India,” she says, starting to flush. Her fingers pick at one of her thumbs. “I figured, you know, you’re Indian and clearly feel connected to that culture and since I’m part of your house, I should at least understand. But then I remembered, you weren’t raised with it, right? So I checked out a bunch more books so I could study it more thoroughly and I won’t ever be able to help you as much as Sirius or maybe one of the Patil twins, but I might be able to provide some answers. Just… just because I’ve studied it so much. I did a lot of reading this summer.” She smiles sheepishly. Hari’s jaw drops.
“Why would such a small village have an upscale section?” Harry asks, eyeing the town curiously.
Hari holds out his hand for Draco to inspect closer. “Sirius said it was a design my father favored. I think I’ll have to use it somewhat frequently.”
“Well, going against the Minister might not be a great idea,” Blaise says, shifting uncomfortably. “He’s nice enough, but he knows how to play the game and the backlash might not be fun to deal with.”
“We should,” Hari sighs and stands, extending his hand to help her up. They walk quietly back, bumping shoulders ever few steps, and make it back to the room in giggles.
“Were those your only concerns?”
Hari trots along through the common room, begging treats and pets off the Slytherins under Draco’s (un)subtle watchful eye.
Draco snorts, “that’s not difficult, they’re beating Weasley.”
“We all will,” Pansy agrees. Hari grabs parchment and an envelope and sets about writing a scathing letter to Fudge. In bright red ink on the outside, he writes ‘URGENT’, just so he knows Fudge will get it right away. He seals it with both the Gryffindor and Slytherin crests and coaxes Hedwig awake. She swoops out their window and off to the Ministry.
