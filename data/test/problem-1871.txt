[10:30] If you’re just going to mock me then your plebeian head is not coming anywhere near my pillows
He leaves Potter in his bathroom and heads back down to rummage in the kitchen. It’s not as nice as Draco’s but it’s fine, functional. He gets the impression Porter doesn’t use it much. There are eggs next to the bread bin and - sure enough - ham in the fridge as well as some strong cheddar, so Draco sets about making an omelette.
. It’s a massive open loft-space with exposed brick walls and huge windows looking out into the city night. There’s a small kitchen off to one side and a staircase leading to a closed-off mezzanine area that he assumes is Potter’s bedroom. The furniture is minimal but warm and cosy and lived-in, there are little pieces of his life everywhere; a mug left on the coffee table, a jumper tossed over the back of an armchair, one cushion squashed into a corner of the sofa where Potter’s obviously put his head down for a snooze.
Harry’s face did something complicated then, and if Draco wasn’t having a very minor hysterical breakdown then he might have said that Harry actually looked
Draco huffed. “Is this why you suggested I get a hot chocolate earlier? So I would be forced to speak to him?”
“Sorry Potter, you’re on my list.” But Draco set his camera down anyway. “Don’t worry. When I get you, you won’t even know I’m there.”
Draco hardly recognised the field when they finally arrived. Five food trucks were lined up with fairy lights hanging between them, a mix of students already queueing up or checking out the menus. He was quite intrigued by
It’s the last time he thinks of Potter, as he sprints through the spiky, splintering overgrowth of woodland that encloses the grounds of Malfoy Manor. He’s already bleeding - superficially, but still. The blood is vibrant against his pale skin like a beacon.
I seem to remember you never getting detention for throwing my present from Gran into the wall in first year
[00:47] Then one day the grandmother decided to visit the family. While the mother was pouring the coffee, Erica’s father came in and it was as if he had seen a ghost. His face was all twisted up as he walked towards a painting behind them
in his thoughts about him. And he’s honest enough with himself these days that he can say - unequivocally - that he’s harboured this attraction for a little while.
“No,” Draco said, quick and certain and a tiny bit desperate. He absolutely did not want Harry to leave, even if he felt like his heart was beating so hard it was a small wonder it didn’t just burst straight through his ribs and smack Harry right in his lovely face.
At some point he’s going to have to go home, he’s going to have to leave Potter on his own looking all soft and lovely and warm to rest and recuperate like he’s supposed to. Potter switches on the television that’s at the end of his bed on a chest of drawers and nestles back into his pillows. He’s finished the omelette, taken his potions. There’s no reason for Draco to be here.
He shakes his head, he can’t think about that right now. He needs to stand up and move. He needs healing ointments and a shower because he’s covered in blood and dirt and fuck knows what else and he
were placed on the table in front of them. What the actual drink could be was anyone’s guess and Luna didn’t really seem to think it was terribly important to tell them. It was, however, topped with a swirling mountain of whipped cream, tiny pastel pink marshmallows, chocolate chips, crumbled biscuits, raspberries, chopped up bits of After Eight, a generous swirl of toffee sauce and –
[00:51] Anyway, we had this painting at home that was really similar to the one in the film. Farmhouse and woods and everything. I kept waking up thinking I was trapped in the painting too and that I’d never get out
“You need to eat something too,” Draco says, holding him still. “Healer Abrahms said you need a small meal before your replenishment potion, something with protein remember?”
I am wildly offended that you wouldn’t think my company alone is worth your while. I could just send the interview questions to you by owl, if you’d prefer?
He resumes with a little more vigour, swirling his tongue around the small pink bud before closing his mouth over it, sucking gently while his thumb and forefinger continues with the other and
But Harry was back to maintaining a respectful distance. Because he was good and kind and lovely. And horrifically charming, especially because he had no idea he was. And gorgeous. And...
[20:27] Which, by the way, I am never listening to you again about sleeping in my clothes I looked such a mess when I woke up
in fact as he rifles through Harry’s things. Harry squirms a bit as he thinks about a swath of pale, touchable skin, not even five feet away.
Potter’s photo isn’t anything spectacular and privately Draco actually thinks the photo of Weasley has turned out objectively better: his hair had photographed incredibly well, contrasting perfectly with icy blue of his eyes as he stared directly into the camera, unsmiling. It’s intense and moody, the swirls of a scar stark against freckled skin, tendrils of damaged tissue winding up his arm and snaking over his shoulder. He looks fierce and wild and dangerous, and Draco feels a lovely twist of pride at how it’s come out. He’s not quite sure what the creative team of
“It’s just a jumper. It was the first one I grabbed.” Harry shrugs. “Didn’t even realise it was green until you pointed it out.” Merlin, he hates how pathetic his lie sounds.
It’s that most magical time of year and I for one am ecstatic about the upcoming Yuletide celebrations!
Draco abruptly stops when he sees that Potter’s mouth is threatening to pull into a grin, his eyes crinkling at the edges, amused at Draco’s flustered state.
have given him a deadline now because they have a launch date and there’s going to be a party with blown-up pictures of his work. He knows he can’t actually put
—there really was no other word for it—to the crook of Draco’s neck. “I just...need a sec. I didn’t think we’d—you’re so—fuck, I
In a weird way, he’s grateful. It gives him something else to focus on instead of the sweat-slicked skin of his body, the too-bright lights of the chandeliers high above, the wetness in his jogging bottoms where he’s obviously pissed himself.
– “ That’s all Harry gets out before Malfoy – Draco – is clenching around him again and Harry’s coming, white noise filling his ears as Draco rides him through his orgasm. He’s shaky with it, taking a minute to blink back to reality; he’s breathing hard, his skin warm and shiny with sweat.
Harry hasn’t said anything in response, has just kept staring. He flicks his gaze away and notices that the label in the neck of the jumper is sticking out. He reaches up and gently pushes it back down, tucks it inside. He knows he’s letting his fingers linger too long, but Malfoy is - he’s leaning into Harry’s delicate touch, turning his body to face him so Harry leaves his hand where it is and watches the rise and fall of Malfoy’s chest as pale hands come to rest on his hips, pulling him forward.
It’s not like there’s anything objectively terrible about Potter’s request; Draco’s flat is clean and tidy and, truth be told, he’s quite fond of the personal space he’s carved out for himself. He also doesn’t believe that Potter’s really got an agenda here beyond just being a cheeky little shit.
[10:46] The last sentence I wrote says: ‘If one returns to Blahday then Blah becomes Blah and hence every fucking Blah ceases to exist. The End.’
doesn’t quite drown out. Under any other circumstance, Draco might swoon a little because he’s impressed with Potter’s choice and it’s all starting to feel a bit...intimate. Which is ridiculous. But the place has a faint, familiar thrum of magic seemingly imbued into the walls that reminds Draco of something he can’t put his finger on.
Harry made absolutely no attempt to extricate himself though, just kept brushing little kisses against Draco’s skin and running his fingertips across the nape of Draco’s neck, impossibly affectionate.
many times before this. But I just thought - if you knew it was me, you wouldn’t want to talk to me at all,” Draco said. “We’ve not exactly had the best history, even
Draco stood rooted to the spot as Harry drew closer, spotted him and suddenly made a beeline in his direction. Whatever was in the canister was evidently heavy as Harry distributed the weight between his arms.
“Oh, um…” Hermione starts clicking her fingers, face screwed up trying to remember, “…something, something man with a scar...”
“Explains why I didn’t get a single bloody thank you for the sandwiches.” Harry takes the piece of paper, trying not to hang on to Malfoy when their fingers brush. “Thanks.” Malfoy hasn’t just written their numbers down, he’s annotated his thoughts around each entry like
“Oh but I really must insist.” Malfoy cuts him off and his eyes are on Harry in an instant. “The peaches seem to have a way of just...disappearing lately, don’t they Sebastian?”
Harry breaks their kiss, breathing hard, tonguing at the spot where Malfoy bit him. He tastes copper.
, Draco thinks; he shifts experimentally, the rest of him still as the Healer in charge of Potter explains about the medication he’s being sent home with, Potter nodding along like it’s all old hat to him. Draco hates the fact that it probably is. Minutely, he increases the pressure against Potter’s fucked up leg.
“It’s something to do with Harry.” It wasn’t a question, and Luna’s focus on Draco felt intense and unshakeable. This girl was entirely too observant.
Didn’t want to have to remind you of how when he smiled your way you turned the same shade of red as his kit
from all the ministry crap, that I’m just...Harry. Is that a weird thing to say? I’m not very arty, but I just – I really like them.“
“Are you really not going to talk to me at all?” Potter asked, suddenly meeting his eyes. Draco’s stomach did a giddy little flip as Potter leaned in close, lowering his voice. Fuck he smelled good. Really bloody good. Like soap and mint and something else, something warm and woodsy. It was doing funny things to his brain, like conjuring an image of him burying his face in Potter’s neck. Stupid brain. Stupid Potter smell. “You can’t
Under the table, Potter nudged at him with his knee. Draco looked up at Luna and nodded vehemently, feeling a strange little swell of contentment when her smile grew impossibly wider. Pleased, she left them alone as a customer headed towards the counter. Draco watched Potter pick up a spoon and pull his drink towards him.
He glanced again at Potter, several seats down, on the other side of the cafe, as far away from Draco as it was possible to be. Be that as it may, Draco still had a very clear view of him, faffing about with his phone, ruffling that feathery black chaos on his head, chewing his lower lip.
. Draco gives him a few ideas about what they could do for the photo, Potter asks what Weasley was like.
“Yes,” says Draco. “Well not the cake, that’s from this little German bakery in Belgravia. It’s called a
Harry kisses it and smiles. “Are you going to invite me in? Or are we putting on a show for your neighbours?”
) to firmly hold him in place. And Harry just melts into it as Malfoy’s hands move round to the small of his back, slipping under the hem of his jumper to find bare skin and pull him closer. Harry deepens the kiss, testing the pliance of Malfoy’s mouth with his tongue and can’t stop the moan escaping the back of his throat when Malfoy rolls his hips against him, flicking his tongue against Harry’s.
[21:16] I could have meant that my current plans were unappealing and that I would rather be on a date instead
. It was Malfoy’s contract work with the DMLE Auror Training Programme that changed things between them. The trainees and new recruits absolutely adored him and his ‘cool-as-fuck’ inventions. They always seemed to try a bit harder whenever Malfoy was present for one of Harry’s training sessions and it was difficult not to get caught up in that. Harry supposed he should’ve been a bit annoyed or jealous about this, but he decided he just couldn’t be bothered when everyone was working so hard, and especially when Malfoy bumped their shoulders together with a soft smile. Sometimes he leant into Harry for a few seconds longer than was strictly necessary to look at his clipboard or murmur his thoughts about one of the trainees in Harry’s ear. Once he’d even corrected Harry’s duelling stance, practically manhandling him into a ‘position much more suiting to a Wizarding gentleman’, and Harry couldn’t help but feel pleased by the pinkish hue to Malfoy’s skin immediately afterwards.
The girl in the doorway had the exact same colour hair as Draco, but it fell in wild unruly curls all around her pale face. Large blue eyes flicked back and forth between them as she waited patiently for a response.
Harry lifts his other hand and cups Malfoy’s face, running a thumb slowly back and forth across his cheek. He marvels at the fact that he has quite a bit of control here, could tilt him this way or that, push him away or pull him close. He knows what he
Harry licks his way back up to the base of Malfoy’s spine, presses an impossibly affectionate kiss there as he nudges for him to roll back over. He does so, and Harry can see that
Draco glanced quickly at Potter, who not only wasn’t looking at him, but was also very clearly trying not to laugh. He rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to this girl, who was peering at him with fascination.
Luna turned out to be something of a saving grace. “Here we are!” Her lilting sing-song voice pulling their attention properly away from each other. “The Puddifoot’s WinterFest Special! My own recipe.”
Something changes in Malfoy’s expression and Harry can see he’s trying very hard not to smile, trying not to
Draco took a deep, steadying breath that did absolutely nothing to quell his nerves. “Harry...what Theo said, I - I wasn’t messing you about, that wasn’t what I wanted. You and me...you and me, he didn’t—he has nothing to do with—I didn’t know that he would—we’re not—I just wanted it to be you and me and—“
back against the door and just lets himself get lost in the feeling of Malfoy all around him; the hard press of his body against Harry’s, warm and solid and lovely, Malfoy’s hair between his fingers, Malfoy’s mouth on his throat. Malfoy nudging between his thighs, rolling his hips again and again, harder and harder.
[00:49] She was always just this motionless figure, looking out, and as the years went by she grew older until one day she faded from the painting completely
This morning when we were talking he said he was outside waiting for his car to warm up because he was going to pick up his friend. I told him to dress warmly because it was cold and he said he would, that he even had a hat on
, for months. Longer. Malfoy meets him with every thrust until they quickly find a rhythm and Malfoy’s hand works his cock, up and down, in time as Harry fucks deep into him.
Draco rolls his eyes. “I don’t know! I can’t think right now, with you all -” Fuck, what’s he saying? He needs to shut up immediately. “What do
Thank you for your email regarding the security and safety of my school. I will investigate the matter in due course.
[16:44] I can see the aesthetic and historical appeal but the wifi is patchy and the heating is really more of an abstract concept at this point than anything resembling actual warmth
Harry nods, perhaps more vigorously than necessary. “Yes,” he grits on, when Malfoy presses against him and fuck, he feels so bloody good.
Draco ignored the unbearably smug look that Potter sent his way and focused instead on the cafe counter, Luna busying herself behind it, wondering what concoction she would bring them. Something about her demeanour told him to be prepared for anything. How did Potter know her? Did she go to Griffin as well? More likely The Huff, she seemed like the fluffy, artsy type. He’d only ever seen Potter with Weasley, mostly because of football, and Hermione Granger, who was far too clever to be friends with either of them. He never could quite figure that one out, and suddenly felt a desire to ask, to
“Thank you, that is very kind.” Malfoy turns his attention to Sebastian and offers the man a broad smile. “But Auror Potter specifically requested all of the peaches, and who are we to deny him what he wants.”
. “Drove me mad in that meeting though.” His palm slides up Malfoy’s side, over his ribs, up to his chest.
It meant something, didn’t it? That he was here, that he seemed willing to give Draco a chance to explain himself.
In the end though, Draco has to add the hair team from the photoshoot for the copious wanking because clearly they have performed some sort of dark magic to make Potter’s hair look...to make him look...fuckable. And like he’s just been fucked.
Neither Harry or Weasley had seen Draco walk over, caught up in a conversation that had Harry chuckling darkly and his ginger friend looking faintly scandalised as he said “I did
Instead, there’s more French swearing when Harry replaces his finger with his tongue, pressing in harder, licking and sucking mercilessly until Malfoy is trembling with it, little gasping moans escaping on each inhalation of breath.
[21:16] I’d slide my fingers up into your hair, tease at your mouth just a little with my tongue. Maybe I’d tighten my hand a bit. Do you like that? I bet you do. You’re so fucking stubborn normally. Relentless. But you’d like it if I took control. Showed you how much I want you, kiss my way down to that delicious bit where your jaw meets your neck
Draco twisted his elbow out of Theo’s hold but didn’t leave, unsettled by the look that was creeping across his ex’s face as he looked at Harry.
Draco frowned and looked up. Potter’s phone was on the table in front of him, his fingers tapping the wood either side as if in deliberation. He picked it up again and started thumbing the screen. Draco looked back at his phone.
"He brought up my family!" At those words, Sirius collapsed back onto the sofa. He took a shaky breath, finally allowing his husband to see the fear and vulnerability that had caused such anger. Remus sat down and wrapped his arms around him, not speaking, just holding him for a long time. He knew how deep the scars went in Sirius when it came to the Blacks. Kicked out at 16 for a combination of being pro-Muggle, Gryffindor and gay, Sirius hadn't had any contact with his family for 22 years. Remus knew his husband hated almost all of his extended family, including the Malfoys, and was deeply ashamed to be related to them. It was out of order for Harry to have brought them up.
Remus snorted again. "He was there to pick up homework from you that was a month late, but he stopped to chat with some first years. So, you being the lovable idiot you were, you ordered him out of the common room on account of, and I quote, "being too fucking small". You're lucky you only got detention!"
"Sorry what was that, cub?" Sirius asked exaggeratedly. "You might have to speak up, I think we're going deaf in our old age!"
"We just couldn't agree on anything today." said Harry, frustrated. "It started off reasonable, 'cause I was worried about his dad again, and then it turned into the most ridiculous stuff! Who argues about their favourite flavour of Sherbet Lemon? It's SHERBET LEMON! The flavour is literally in the name!" He flopped onto the sofa. "That has to be the stupidest argument anyone has ever had."
"I don't think he will, that's the thing." Harry said urgently. His dads looked shocked. "He's been seeming weaker. Like, basic magic is draining his energy. He almost never comes to the feasts because he can barely do the stairs. This is supposed to be the most powerful wizard of all time!"
Hogwarts is a bit.... weird lately. I haven't seen my friends outside of Gryffindor in nearly two weeks, and there seems to be a lot of inter-house tension. I don't know what's happening, but it doesn't feel right.
He sighed and climbed the stairs to the third floor. What had once been Sirius' bedroom was now theirs. Walburga and Orion's was undoubtedly bigger, but Sirius had point-blankly refused to sleep in a room where his "bitch of a mother fucked her cousin", so that had been turned into a walk-in closet during the extensive renovations. He found Sirius in this closet, curled up in a ball amongst the winter coats. Correction, he found Padfoot. It was sometimes simpler for Sirius to just turn into his Animagus form when it came to feelings, rather than face them. Dogs, he claimed, were much less complicated than humans, and so it was easy to filter things out.
Don’t you think it’s weird that he should mention a hat at all? Why not gloves? Or a scarf? Or a coat??
Somewhere between seeing Malfoy still in his red jumper and groping Malfoy’s arse the plan has veered slightly off course.
Draco rolled his eyes at the computer screen before shutting it down. He stood up from the desk and reached his arms above his head, feeling the satisfying stretch of muscle across his back. As he brought his hands down, thumbs landing to knead at the juncture between neck and shoulders, his eyes fell on his phone.
“At least it wouldn’t be boring.” Ron shrugged. “Sure, I’d always worry he’d be plotting my murder and where to hide my body, but he wouldn’t be
He didn’t think about it again beyond the odd daydream until he heard the rumour that Potter had cast a corporeal patronus in third year. Outwardly he’d scoffed in disbelief to anyone who would listen, rolling his eyes at the mere prospect of it. Privately, he’d looked up the stag patronus in the library, idly running his thumb over his knuckles as he stared down at the words
Harry pitches his hips back and forth, gentle until Malfoy starts to move with him, moaning on each of Harry’s slow thrusts, pushing back against him.
“Yeah, yeah. It’s hilarious.” Harry rolls his eyes and gestures to a changing area that’s hidden around a little nook in the corner. “It’s private. I can’t imagine you’ll want to wear my Auror robes but I’ve got some jumpers and possibly some shirts. Not as nice as any of yours obviously.” In order to stop his eyes dropping to Malfoy’s chest again he turns away and pretends to look thoroughly engrossed in tidying his desk which is, thankfully, a bloody shit tip.
With regards to the DMLE charity calendar, I would like to schedule an appointment with you at your nearest convenience to complete the interview.
It’s perfunctory, and when he gets a response back a few hours later he’s mostly expecting something formal in return. Not even from Potter himself but most likely an assistant, with a suggested date and time. He’s half right.
Potter’s face softens, he blinks a few times, smiles up at Draco from his pillow-nest. Must be all the potions he’s on, Draco thinks; pain relief, blood replenishers. And knowing Potter, probably some kind of relaxant to stop him wandering off. He wouldn’t be looking at Draco like
Malfoy’s release is hot against the back of his throat and Harry swallows all of it down, caressing Malfoy’s hip gently with his fingers through his orgasm.
Draco pulled his gloves off, shoving them down into his coat pocket before retrieving his phone. He’d felt it vibrate several times as he’d stormed off; no doubt it was Neville, firing off an array of concerned messages as he’d run after Draco. He could be quite persistent with his worrying and Draco was fairly certain those were Neville’s quick footfalls he’d heard in the distance behind him.
Harry’s pinned against the door and Malfoy is leaning into him; kissing down Harry’s jawline, nuzzling into his neck, licking and kissing and gently biting. Harry slides a hand up into Malfoy’s hair; he means to grip it, to keep Malfoy’s head in place but it’s so bloody soft and touchable he just runs his hand through the fine, white-blond strands, wondering what kind of shampoo Malfoy uses, what it smells like. He angles his head slightly and inhales.
“I mean, if you keep going on dates with people who are in awe of you, they’re bound to be bloody weird.”
Potter arrives last. Unlike the others, he’s not wearing his Auror robes but a plain grey t-shirt and faded jeans that sit a little too low in the hip to be decent.
Saturday has been taken care of. If you encounter any further issues please do not hesitate to contact me.
Harry arched into him, just a little. “Well, we might never have talked to each other properly if we hadn’t had this. We might never have gotten
It’s probably meant to have come out like a joke, but Malfoy’s voice has come out in that rumbly-soft way again and Harry isn’t laughing, just moving closer to him. They’re close enough that if Harry takes one more step forward or Malfoy takes one back, there won’t be any space between them at all and it’s taking every ounce of self-control for Harry not to just
Luna, tiny as she was, steered him towards an empty corner table and bodily shoved him down on the banquette. Potter went to take the chair furthest from Draco, but Luna stopped him. “No no! You should go and sit next to your friend, Harry.”
The first thing he sees are Malfoy’s wide eyes reflected back at him in the medium-sized mirror that’s spelled onto the wall. He almost looks like he’s been caught out, even though he invited Harry
have. But by then you’d gone and I was just sat there feeling like a massive twat and I should’ve gone after you, I
He didn’t want to look at Potter, suddenly afraid of what he might see there, but he’d made himself do it anyway. Draco was surprised that Potter wasn’t laughing at all; in fact, his normally idiotic face was doing something rather complicated, flitting in equal measure between discomfort and anger. At what exactly, Draco didn’t know or care to know, and he raced back to the Slytherin common room as he felt his eyes prickle with heat and humiliation.
“Everything except the borscht.” Draco sits back in the booth and folds his arms as Potter glances up at him with curiosity. “It’s not quite there yet.”
“Right. Well, I’m sorry to disappoint you but my pyjamas are very not-posh at all, just joggers and a t-shirt.”
Draco had just taken a massive bite of his ham and emmental crêpe when he saw Harry walking towards him through the steadily growing crowd. He was carrying a rather large silver canister and dressed simply in faded jeans and a burgundy sweatshirt, sleeves pushed up to his elbows.
Draco felt the ground start to tilt sideways then which he thought was a bit odd so he’d dug his fingers into the dirt to hang on, though the rational part of his brain reminded him he was just
“Oh. No, I definitely don’t want to do that. I mean I’m really fucking nervous so a bit of me does but mostly I’m just worried about falling behind or - fuck,
They removed their coats with minimal awkwardness, only occasionally knocking into each other. Draco unwound his scarf and dropped it onto his lap. He left his hat on because he was still a bit chilly. It had absolutely nothing at all to do with the way Potter would occasionally glance up at it and smile to himself.
It’s a lie, DMLE is essentially one big grid but Esther looks grateful as she steps out and nods at Draco to follow her. Neither of them look back at Mr April, who is clearly in the midst of having a strop.
The history of the Hogwarts Independent School has indeed been a competitive one, though I sincerely doubt the founders of the original school intended for there to be such rivalry between the former “houses” or that we’d ever need to expand into the four separate schools we know today as the result of the growing population in the area.
With a jolt, he came across his other parent - an interesting sight of Sirius vs Lucius. Remus was nowhere to be seen, and Draco prayed he was still alive. He didn't think Harry would survive the loss. Walking up to the duelling in-laws, he pushed his father's arm. Lucius didn't seem to notice, busy firing bolt after bolt of light at Harry's dad. So instead, Draco sent a well-aimed Jelly-Legs Curse at his father. Lucius, taken completely by surprise, fell to his knees. Sirius looked shocked, then saw Draco and grinned. He sauntered up to Lucius, now restrained by his own son, and punched him in the face. Lucius was knocked out cold and slumped to the floor. Draco kicked his body.
Sirius frowned. "Moony," he announced, "our son appears to think we are convicted criminals. Are you ashamed to be talking to your fathers in a Hogwarts fire, Harry?" He winked again, so Harry would know he wasn't really mad.
Not one to deny his needy husband, Remus released Sirius' cock with a pop, gripped his hips and pulled him down the bed towards him. Grabbing lube out of the bedside drawer, he quickly gave himself a few pumps before aligning himself with Sirius' entrance. Remus gently pushed in, giving his husband time to adjust to the size. It was a wonder that after so many years, being with Sirius in this way still felt as good, if not better, than it did the first time.
Sirius snorted, not quite a laugh but at least with raised spirits. "I was quite a miserable wretch, wasn't I?"
Yawning, Harry glanced at his clock. Crap. He only had a couple of hours before his dads would be up and he'd have to face them for the first time since the argument. Sliding off his clothes, he pulled the duvet over himself and tried to sleep, hoping for dreams not involving Snake-Face. As was often the case, he was disappointed.
"Not awful actually. Honestly, I didn't see much of his reaction what with my dad's screaming." Harry felt Draco wince.
Remus looked sympathetic. "This must be incredibly stressful for him, Bambi. Draco's probably under a lot of pressure from his father and living two different lives would take its toll on anyone. He's going to need your support."
In the week running up to the first day of school, Harry was fretting over a stupid argument he'd had with Draco. Remus was patiently listening, while inwardly rejoicing that Harry already felt comfortable enough to do this with them. It was one thing to talk about your boyfriend with your dads, but it was another thing entirely to complain about your boyfriend and trust it would not turn into a fight.
Missing? MISSING? Their son was MISSING, and the mongrel hadn't even thought to send Remus a Patronus message about it? Not wasting another second, he marched to the large fireplace that dominated the living room and took a pinch of the green powder that resided in a jar on the mantelpiece. He threw this into the fire, stepped forward and cleared his throat. "The Burrow!" He requested, and immediately spun on the spot, disappearing from 12 Grimmauld Place, and reappearing a moment later, this time in the cosy dining room of the Weasleys.
He stepped even closer, now right in front to it. Harry ran his hand down the list of names. He paused occasionally, whenever he came across a name more personal than the rest.
Instantly Remus' thoughts turned to Voldemort. But it couldn't be anything like that, or the whole country would be at war and Harry would be scared, not upset. No one could be dead, or Sirius would have heard even if he hadn't.
Sirius looked ready for murder. He spoke through gritted teeth, in a tone that promised danger. "Pick your next words carefully, Harry."
Harry paced nervously in front of the fireplace in the Gryffindor Common Room. It was ten to four, his dads weren't even expected yet let alone late, but he couldn't shake this sinister feeling that something was wrong. He started counting painting to distract himself, but quickly grew bored. Finally, after nearly wearing a hole in the carpet, he heard a pop from the fire and turned to see two heads sticking out from the embers.
Before long, this topic was depressing them as well, as they both knew a future like that was a long shot, even if they both survived this war. Draco drifted off then, lying on the floor with his head in Harry's lap. Harry didn't blame him. It must have been an exhausting day for the blonde, physically and emotionally. He shuddered when he thought of the pain and suffering that might be lurking in Draco's future. Neither of them knew how Death Eater Initiation worked, but it couldn't be pleasant. Harry was pretty sure Voldemort wasn't a balloons and cake kind of guy. It didn't take long for Harry, too, to fall asleep. For once, he wasn't worried about seeing Voldemort in his dreams, as being around Draco always seemed to somehow muffle the Dark Lord's connection.
"We don't have much time." He explained McGonagall's battle plans to Draco. "Plus, we need to kill the snake. Apparently, she's crucial."
Remus thought back and all of a sudden had the perfect memory on hand. "Remember Christmas fourth year? Truth or dare?"
Quick Author's Note: (I know, I'm sorry) This chapter takes place pretty much simultaneously to Chapter 6, just from Remus' perspective rather than Harry's.
Dumbledore had told them that, on the night he interviewed Sybill Trelawney for a position at Hogwarts, she had issued a prophecy. This had been overheard by someone - a Death Eater, Harry assumed - who had carried at least the first part of it back to Voldemort. The Dark Lord had apparently decided to kill Harry because of this prophecy and used Pettigrew to find out the Potters' location. He had killed James, then Lily when she defended Harry.
Sirius' eyebrows raised in surprise, as if shocked that a Malfoy would trouble himself with matters of Muggle transport. "Yeah." He finally answered. "Yeah, I've got two out back. A Triumph Tiger 110 and a Vincent Black Shadow."
Sirius cocked an eyebrow, as if wanting him to get to the point. "But" Remus persisted, "don't you think Harry will have thought of all that already? He knows the danger he faces and how many are relying on him. It's incredibly hard to gain his trust. So, Draco must have done something to prove himself to Harry. There has to be a reason that Harry would risk this!"
He snatches it back out of her hands and tries to give her a reproachful look that she pointedly ignores.
The image of Harry Potter naked. Naked for him. On his knees for him. Fucking into him, hard and deep and toe-curlingly delicious.
[13:33] On our way back in last night she said it was against school rules and that he had to get rid of it
Malfoy’s nipple is slick where Harry’s worked it over; he runs a finger around it thoughtfully before giving the same attention to the other until it’s just as pink and peaked as the first.
I would ask that you lift the ban effective immediately allowing him to support the volunteer team with the firework display as planned this coming Saturday.
[08:52] I would like to inform you that the fountain was donated by our sister school in Basel, a city that is rich in history and culture, something I wouldn’t expect you to know anything about you absolute fucking barbarian.
“Ivy?” Draco’s eyebrows bemusedly knit together at the same time as the tips of Esther’s ears turn pink.
“Well, not so much anymore. I do miss my mother quite a bit, she writes to me every other week though.”
weird. He was sure Madam Pomfrey could have sorted it out - she’d healed him quickly and efficiently after the hippogriff incident. It was quite impressive actually. He’d asked her loads of questions, after his father had gone. He told her he liked seeing how things worked, putting them back together again. Isn’t that what healers basically did? She’d laughed and said ‘more or less’. Told him to stop by for a chat any time he wanted, if he had more questions. If he wanted to learn.
, that’s why I was cancelling the date. I didn’t want to go anymore, I don’t think I ever did. How could I when I just wanted to talk to
I don’t think you understand the gravity of the situation. I still haven’t told him I’m me. He still thinks we’re strangers.
Harry’s features softened as he stepped closer. “You were going to tell me though weren’t you, out there?” He gestured vaguely in the direction from which he’d just come.
place,” Esther explains, rolling her eyes (quite frankly, thank fuck for Esther, who seems to be acting as some sort of anchor to rationality for Draco in this moment) “And you look a bit…”
Draco isn’t sure he needs an escort either. But Mr April is giving him an up-down-up look that oozes with disdain so instead he says, “thank you Esther, I’d really appreciate your help. This place is a bit of a warren.”
[00:48] Sometimes Erica would be in a different place in the painting, one day she might be outside feeding the ducks, other times she might be in the farmhouse looking out of the window
“Yes!” Ron exclaims, and then with a hand over his heart, his face brooding, starts to sing, “I’ve lost my heart to the man with a scar, I’ll always find you wherever you aaaare...”
[12:04] Of course depending on who you want to see will determine if I allow you to accompany me or not
It was different after that; civility turned into friendly small talk which in turn grew into something not altogether unpleasant. Granger was a brilliant conversationalist and Weasley was a bit of a hilarious gossip once he was on his second glass of champagne. And Potter…confused him.
He’s barely made it through the door when the trainees descend upon him like an angry horde of feral cats, quickly relieving him of all the sandwiches. Malfoy merely looks on, amused and unhelpful as ever as Harry wanders over to him.
a really nice place, which he’s about to say out loud when Potter’s attention is suddenly drawn away.
Draco walks quickly across the ministry atrium, reciting the mantra in his head as he makes his way towards the bank of lifts.
“Thank fuck you’re here,” he’d said one night, sidling up to Draco as he stood changing the lenses on his camera.
Draco felt his cheeks warm up, partially hidden by his scarf. It had been an afterthought really, the hat, snatching it up and shoving it on his head, a tuft of white-blond hair poking out from beneath the burgundy knit. He hadn’t bothered to stop and look at his reflection as he’d left, letting the door swing shut behind him. He just wanted to get
The past week had been a success; Draco had worked his arse off, focused and diligent, and was almost back to where he needed to be. But then he’d also had to ask Neville several times to hide his phone because - well, he
So, fine. He finds Potter attractive. What Draco is less honest with himself about is how deeply rooted that attraction is, and how it has unfurled and taken hold around his heart.
Harry is desperately trying to look anywhere that isn’t Malfoy. He’s already had an eyeful of a nipple that he wants to clamp his mouth over but he needs to not think about that right now. Aside from the fact that he’s not sure he’s going to be able to concentrate in this meeting with images of a wet, half-naked Malfoy in his brain, he needs to be
Malfoy bites his lip, a small tugging at the corners of his mouth as he releases it. “Are you asking me or telling me?”
He sort of hated himself then; he wanted to just jump, he wanted it so badly he could practically feel it singing through his veins.
It’s deeply gratifying when Potter’s easy confidence falters as Draco gets him into position. A pink tongue darts out and licks an upper lip, a blush creeps into stubbly cheeks; Potter shuffles awkwardly, clutching the towel.
Potter’s photo is more in keeping with what the calendar people probably had in mind. He’s got one arm pulled back, his hand cupping the back of his head in that slightly self-conscious hair-ruffling way that Draco has become achingly familiar with. He’s grinning at something off-camera in a way that looks both shy and teasing.
and there was a steady stream of people angling to get a free hot drink as they stood around waiting for the fireworks to start.
[00:40] During a sleepover when I was about seven we watched The Witches and I had nightmares for weeks afterwards
The three of them glance quickly over at Malfoy who has apparently not heard them, thank Merlin. Although...he does appear to be holding himself a little more stiff and upright than usual, his spine ramrod straight. Hard to tell though, Malfoy has never exactly been the
[09:53] It’s doing this flicky curl thing over my left ear and it won’t stay in place I think I’ve made it worse
When Draco looked back down at his screen he could see the three tell-tale dots, fading in and out, as Potter typed him a message.
Then hands are pulling his mouth open and more liquid is poured down his throat. Another hand over his mouth again but at least he can breathe through his nose this time.
He knows he doesn’t sound indignant at all; that he sounds bashful and prim. It’s the wine. And the lighting.
Malfoy’s presentation is brilliant, of course. He’s confident and charming, explains the future developments in the Auror Training Programme like he’s spearheading the entire thing by himself. He even manages to demonstrate a reconstruction of the shielding session from that morning using some truly impressive charmwork that has Harry sat on the edge of his seat. And he was
Draco opens his eyes, steals himself and looks. The bite marks are fresh and bloody, and there’s mud caked into the broken skin. It’s already starting to feel hot and itchy, like it’s infected.
Or you can tell me later, in a dramatic Malfoyan huff after you’ve let whatever it is build up in your head
me I do. I was...wrong and selfish and terribly unfair to you and there’s no excuse for it, I know there isn’t. If I could take it all back I
Potter tosses a handful of powder into the Floo. “The Flat Above The Bar.” His voice is clear and commanding, sending a shiver down Draco’s spine. “27 Sullivan Street, Shoreditch.”
One of the volunteer students that was supposed to help with the fireworks event was not permitted to enter Slytherin Prep premises on Saturday morning. There seems to have been a misunderstanding that he was ‘trespassing’ with the intent to destroy school property. This is preposterous. Harry Potter is an exemplary student and I have the utmost confidence that he was simply looking for the way through to get to the school field.
“That’s okay, I can save you one, Draco.” Sebastian’s voice is dripping with a saccharine sweetness that irks Harry, and the over-familiarity of using Malfoy’s first name unsettles him further.
And the other not-unattractive thing about Malfoy, which Harry has also shared with no-one, is that he hardly ever wears wizard robes anymore: whenever Harry sees him he’s always wearing these...
The milk, rather fortuitously, is still in date and Draco busies himself with getting the kettle on and retrieving mugs because he can’t think about how good Potter looks in his kitchen, how perfect, how
“Come on,” says Harry, “let’s kick ‘em out and get to this meeting before the senior Aurors get their hands on the entirety of the complimentary buffet.”
If Harry had thought the training session was unbearable, then the rest of the afternoon is pure torture. Of course, it’s all Ron’s fault.
The bite, when it happens, is the worst pain he’s ever experienced in his short, useless little life.
[15:48] If my only two options are sourdough or nothing then you are a terrible breakfast host and frankly I’m well shot of you
Draco tells himself that he finds Potter attractive in the same way that probably most people do, he certainly can’t be
[15:42] I have to go and meet my father for an early dinner before my flight back so I might not reply much
He’d been out flying when everything became horrifically clear. The sun was starting to set as he landed near the edge of the woodland, his father beckoning him over from the veranda. So he’d left the broom propped up against a tree and walked forward, not being able to think of a good enough reason not to. His father didn’t quite meet his eye, but urged Draco to follow him inside, saying things like
curious, is the thing. It’s obvious in the way he’s just looking at everything in silent appraisal; the dark blue cabinets, the fruit bowl, Draco’s bookmarked cookbooks in a neat row next to the utensil pot.
Draco watches the exchange with curiosity until Potter’s attention is back on him, the muffliato restored.
Draco opens his mouth to speak, to say - what, exactly? To protest? Demand that Potter take this stupid interview seriously? That he’s wasting Draco’s time? He’s not even looking at Draco anymore. He’s beckoning over an older man in a white shirt and black waistcoat with a tilt of his head while wandlessly dropping the
The toes of Harry’s scuffed-up Converse came into view then; if Draco looked up now, how close would Harry be? What did it
Esther’s returning smile goes from impish to nervous as they head down the corridor. “So, um - no Ivy with you today then?”
Harry turns his head. “Be there in a sec!” He calls back and sighs as he feels Malfoy’s hands loosen their hold. Harry looks back at him, letting the hand in Malfoy’s hair slide round to cup his other cheek. His eyelids flutter closed as he pulls Malfoy in and kisses him once more, holding his face and running his thumbs over the apples of Malfoy’s cheeks, his lips.
What would it be like to spend an evening here? Is he about to find out? What are the expectations of taking someone home from the hospital?
Afterwards, in the hospital wing, half-listening to his father berate Dumbledore and Severus and Madam Pomfrey and anyone else who had the
Everything was going fine until Draco spotted a bit of whipped cream on Potter’s knuckle and for some reasons felt the need to
And Harry feels like his heart is going to explode with the way Malfoy is looking up at him; so wide-eyed and open, vulnerable with what he’s said, fierce in his conviction. He watches Malfoy’s face as he pushes past the tight ring of muscle, brushes a kiss against his forehead and nuzzles into his hair when Malfoy’s eyelids start to flutter as he pushes, slow and deep, until Harry’s completely buried in him.
The office is much more boring than Draco had expected, with a normal boring desk and chair and grey filing cabinets. There’s a partition of some kind in the corner that seems to be leading to a small hidden area. Apart from the name on the door and the fact that Potter is actually
Draco burrowed deeper into his scarf, trying to protect as much of his face as possible from the biting November chill. Crisp leaves crunched satisfyingly under his winter boots as he made his way through Hogsmeade to Puddifoot’s.
Don’t contact them. They’ll be busy because everyone is getting their applications in before the Christmas holidays. See you next weekend for dinner.
Potter stepped closer and this time pointed at the door. “Sorry, do you mind? It’s just – I’m meeting someone and –”
Perhaps a small measure of his anger was misplaced - after all, Theo had been quite unfairly vicious (and Draco would need to deal with that sooner rather than later) but for now the person he was most cross with was himself.
Draco pulled it out embarrassingly fast, feeling his shoulders drop as he peered down at the screen.
“It’s fine.” Potter waves the question off which is neither a yes or no. “Anyway you said it’s just five minutes away right?”
Draco shook himself free, staring at Theo’s spiteful, vicious face in horror, his eyes feeling hot and prickly.
met when we were in our second year, when I started playing for the school,” said Draco, remembering it. He had sort of hated Harry straight away, back then; he was
Potter’s out of the shower, towel-drying his hair and already changed into soft flannel pyjama bottoms and a sweatshirt when Draco walks into his bedroom, carrying the food and a large glass of water.
Perhaps I should get in touch with LSE and find out what the delay is. I know your mother is still hoping for Oxford so you’ll be closer to home but if you’re in the city you’ll be able to start with VDM & Associates straight away. You need to think about your future Draco.
, he adds with his most charming, most winning smile. The wizard-who-needs-to-keep-his-hands-off-Malfoy flutters his eyelashes and looks down, blushes a little bit.
that be part of the plan? And will it be like before? Malfoy close and warm and wrapped around him, his lips full and pliant sliding against Harry’s. The memory of it does nothing to calm his nerves which only seem to amplify as the doors open and he sees Malfoy standing there waiting for him. He’s still wearing Harry’s red jumper and a small soft smile that tugs at Harry’s heart.
Which means Malfoy’ll be sat in the meeting practically smelling like Harry and fucking hell he loves that thought so much more than Malfoy wearing anything else of his. It’ll be a bit like - Harry’s marked him, claimed him, or something.
Harry does. Malfoy watches him, sitting upright on the edge of his bed, long legs dangling. This, more than anything else they’ve done so far, feels the most intimate and Harry can feel his face warm, feeling shy. Still, he’s rather pleased to see Malfoy’s cock start to fill out again when he’s down to just his underwear. He hooks his thumbs over the waistband before Malfoy stops him.
Please accept our sincere apologies. It seems that the book you requested below was incorrectly loaned to another student in error. We have since received the book back into the library ready for your collection.
“Not him.” Draco swallowed thickly, as Harry frowned in confusion. “That evening you were in the pub, and I was watching bake off, and you said—you told me there was someone that you...liked.”
and suggested him as a photographer (Luna. It’s definitely, definitely Luna). And while he’s at it he can also blame Ivy, his assistant, for being so proficient at setting up that Draco has no choice but to help sort out the ‘models’ – chat to them, get them to loosen up a bit and take this for what it’s supposed to be: a laugh, a silly afternoon,
But for now I’m going to go to Ps, buy myself a massive hot chocolate and forget all about Harry bloody Potter
“What?!” Harry scoffs, throwing an alarmed glance at the man in question before lowering his voice. “I can’t go out with
“I might go to bed actually, I think I’ve read the same paragraph about gravity wells about three times now.”
The apprehension must be obvious because Potter’s smile starts to fade and he stands up straight from the wall, shaking his head. “Sorry. I was - it doesn’t matter. I was just curious. Tea?”
He already had the shirts to contend with, and that...oddly adorable wave to Malfoy’s hair that he’s daydreamed about more than once. But now there was this: a perfect, high, unusually rounded fucking
wants to sit next to Malfoy? He almost does but Ron is looking at him weird and so he begrudgingly budges up, as requested, trying not to think about how much he misses the hard press of Malfoy’s body against his own.
. So of course I thought you and he were a thing and I just needed to not think about you but then you’re
“I’m sure that’s not true.” Malfoy offers up the peach in his hand, shifting slightly closer. “Don’t you
Not for the first time, Draco realised how lucky he was to have him as a friend, particularly when Neville took the whole scene in and turned on Theo, seething.
Harry leans down and places the sweetest, softest kiss he possibly can on Malfoy’s lips. “Bold of you to assume I play fair, Malfoy.” Harry releases his wrists and sits up, still straddling him and feeling deeply gratified that Malfoy keeps his hands exactly where they are.
Harry leans down and kisses him, long and lingering and sweet, but doesn’t stop stroking around his nipple, doesn’t stop when Malfoy starts making breathy little moans against his mouth. Harry decides he wants to hear
Harry pulled away, looking up at him through his lashes as he licked his lips. He chewed thoughtfully for a second before swallowing the morsel down. “Gotta go. See you later, Malfoy.” Harry shifted the canister in his hands again and walked off, as if he didn’t have a care in the world.
The Beauxbaton Hotel & Bistro is such a wonderful location for this most auspicious occasion. After the resounding success of the unity dinner and the fireworks spectacular, the Yule Ball will be the icing on the proverbial cake of inter-school unity.
He’s lying in bed, two days after their impromptu drink at the wine bar. He’s still half asleep, one hand tucked comfortably behind his head while the other trails lazily down his abdomen.
Esther has been inside for about 15 seconds when the shouty swearing starts to subside. He hears Potter say something he can’t quite make out and a second person respond with a ‘
“You – the photos you take of me. People used to only ever seem to want to see me looking scary or stupid or fucked up. Yours aren’t ever like that. You always seem to make me look – I don’t know,
“Er, Malfoy?” Potter says, drawing Draco’s attention away from the curiously blank walls. “Do you mind if we do this in the canteen? I’ve been in back to back meetings and haven’t had lunch yet so -“
“W-what-“ Draco’s voice came out cracked and whispery. He cleared his throat, slipping his phone back into his pocket. “What are you doing here?”
The gnarled hand lifts, and Draco barely takes a breath before someone is pouring a potion down his throat. He chokes on it, spits a mouthful out.
But he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about seeing Cedric Diggory’s body. He’d never seen a dead body before. And this was Cedric Diggory. Hogwarts Champion. Impossibly handsome and charming and kind. He’d even smiled at Draco once, though it was quite possible he’d imagined it. And now he was dead, supposedly by the Dark Lord’s hand, if Potter was to be believed.
“I couldn’t find it anywhere. I managed to postpone the meeting by a week but she’s still expecting to see all the prep work so I’m just going to have to redo it.”
“Yes, alright, thank you, that’s quite enough.” Harry says eventually, lifting his head and trying his very best to look cross.
Potter convinces him to stay for a bit while he eats his omelette, and it’s not that late really so Draco kicks off his shoes and sits as upright as he possibly can on top of the covers on Potter’s bed because it’s either that or the floor and he doesn’t want to make it weird even though inside he’s thinking
, Harry thinks. He’s kneeling between Malfoy’s thighs, edging his legs slightly further apart with his knees, the length of his cock pressing and rubbing against the crease of Malfoy’s arse as Harry leans over him. He kisses and licks his way down Malfoy’s spine, but every shuddery sigh seems to make Harry inexplicably harder. Harry grips himself at the base of his cock, taking a deep breath as his urge to come subsides to the point where he can
Weasley nodded his head towards Harry, who in turn busied himself pouring out Draco’s drink from the silver canister in front of him into a disposable cup. He put a lid on it and handed it over.
Malfoy’s breathing sounds ragged and broken and he snakes a hand towards his cock before Harry pulls it away and lifts his head. “Not yet.” Malfoy grumbles something incoherent into the duvet that sounds suspiciously like a combination of French expletives and frustration; Harry smirks, massaging around Malfoy’s hole with the tip of his index finger before sliding it in, slow and gentle up to the knuckle.
Harry takes Malfoy’s cock deep into his mouth and pulls off torturously slow. Harry feels a shift on the bed and looks up; Malfoy has propped himself up, eyes unyielding as he licks his lips, watching Harry take his cock deep into the wet heat of his mouth. Harry pulls off, slow and deliberate, his eyes never leaving Malfoy’s.
I have a telly,” Draco says, sounding a little huffy, at least trying to convey an air of frostiness in the face of what is happening here: getting cosy in Harry’s bed.
[23:09] It's too subjective a question, you need to factor in mood, time of day, who you’re with or not with, the weather
“You’re such a prick,” he said, but then he was smiling, and laughing softly, and Draco couldn’t stop himself from smiling back.
They go to the corner table of a wine bar on Hackney Road that Draco’s never been to - replete with low, cosy lighting and exposed brick and relaxing music that Potter's
I was just trying to wind him up about going out with sluggy chops and so I told him I was a good kisser and then he was like ‘describe it then’ and so I did
Potter makes a non-committal sound in response but Draco thinks he might’ve seen Potter’s lips threaten to tug into a smile (although he can’t really be sure because obviously he’s looking out of the window and not surreptitiously looking at Potter’s mouth).
Potter gives a soft laugh. “Do you think people who buy the calendar will care more about the answer to that question, or having my cock on their wall for a month?”
Draco directs him to the kitchen while he closes and locks the door behind them, only to find that Potter’s stayed exactly where he is leaning casually against the wall.
” Draco demanded, indignant and snippy. He realised he sounded faintly ridiculous, that he had no right to be annoyed, and that Harry likely agreed with both of these statements of fact if his irritating little smirk was anything to go by. But still.  “You tell me right now this
When he looked back up, Harry was looking at him, smiling in a way that loosened something in Draco’s chest. He pulled in his bottom lip between his teeth, noticing that Harry’s eyes tracked the movement before focusing back on his.
Draco is still sitting on the edge of his bed, his hip pressing gently against Potter’s damaged leg, neither of them saying anything about it. Maybe there’s nerve damage and Potter can’t feel it, can’t feel
. Draco should leave. It had been an unfathomably terrible idea to come down here. He didn’t even really like hot chocolate all that much (a bald-faced lie if there ever was one). Besides, Potter was likely here for his date wasn’t he? That must be why he was here. Draco definitely didn’t want to see that (except he actually sort of did).
Originally I had this chapter written in normal prose from Harry's POV but I just felt like it didn't work at this point even though it was more Harry/Draco centric than what I've posted here. I still have it and I'm wondering if you lovely readers would like to have it included as something like a 'deleted scene'. It might even work better from Draco's POV.
“The healers have done their job and stopped the curse from spreading. It’ll just take a few days to repair and rebuild, that’s all.” He pauses, glancing at the paper bag in Draco’s hands. “Did you bring me something?”
He should just stand up and pay for his drink and leave and forget all about whatever this was. Potter was there waiting for someone else, someone that wasn’t him. And Potter wasn’t even messaging him anymore, not since...
But then Harry’s imagining sinking his teeth into Malfoy’s perfect, pale skin, sucking and nibbling and licking that elegant neck and
Draco knew he’d be playing a dangerous game with himself if he read anything into this...well, whatever this was. It was all starting to feel a bit like a date. Which was stupid. He and Potter sat here together trying to consume Luna’s sugary madness, sharing little lingering, smiley looks and nudging each other under the table, egging each other on.
As if Harry needs further encouragement, Malfoy spreads his legs a little wider, angling his hips to push his arse up towards him.
“It would be just like you to spite-drink that entire thing just to piss me off.” Potter watched as Draco took another mouthful, this time drawing the spoon out much slower.
Because yes, fuelled by Neville’s unfailing optimism, he had allowed himself to entertain fantasies that this might all work out; had let himself imagine what it might be like, for Harry to really know who he was talking to and say the same things to him anyway, for him to mean it, for it all to be
“Yeah. Neville helped me look. It’s not in our room where I thought I left it or in the library. Nobody has handed it in. I’m hoping someone still will but...I can’t just do
Neville continued to look at him, his smirk showing no signs of fading until Draco burst out laughing, dropping his face into his hands.
Word somehow gets around what a ‘laugh’ the photoshoot was, and how at ease Draco made them all feel. The brilliant minds behind the calendar decide they want a mini-interview conducted with each ‘month’ and that Draco should be the one to do it.
. Maybe it’s the thought that this is the first time today that they’re really (finally) alone together, and in such close proximity too. They’re so close that if Harry reaches out he could touch him. Maybe it’s that. Or maybe it’s the fact that the item of clothing that Malfoy has chosen to borrow is Harry’s favourite red jumper. Well, it's more a deep burgundy. And a bit on the thin side from so much washing because Harry wears it so often. But it is amazingly soft. And Malfoy’s wearing it.
Malfoy stills, his hand still held out between them, offering up the peach. His cheeks start to flush a lovely Gryffindor red and Harry realises what he’s done. He hasn’t thought those words, he’s said them, out loud. In a strange, predatory come-hither voice that he barely recognises as his own. To Malfoy. Who isn’t moving, or saying anything, or doing anything but staring at Harry.
The triple P’s are punctuated in a way that Harry thinks is meant to piss him off and not send tiny quivers of pleasure directly to his cock.
Draco carefully watched Potter unlock his phone and check his incoming message, his face crinkling into something that Draco thought looked like disappointment.
[10:51] But don’t make these early morning wake-up calls a habit if you want our little chats to continue
Harry can hear Malfoy muttering ‘well I never’ and chuckling to himself from the nook. The sound lifts some of the tension he’d been feeling, being a bit gossipy like this. It’s quite fun, and Harry sort of wants to sack off this meeting with Shacklebolt altogether and just hang out with Malfoy. Alone.
“Harry…?” Asks Hermione, her features pulling into one of concern, “About before, I hope we didn’t offend –“
Unbidden, an image of a messy-haired Malfoy, running a hand back through his hair flashes through his mind that Harry quickly blinks away.
Harry leans into it, angles his head to press his lips to Malfoy’s palm before reaching up to give it a quick squeeze and then he’s leaning back onto his heels between Malfoy’s thighs, retrieving the lube.
“Can I walk you home?” Potter asks, coming back to the table having paid. There’s a bag with Esther’s sweet cabbage pierogies dangling from one hand as he reaches for his jacket with the other.
“Try to relax.” Draco plasters on his blandest smile. “I just need to get you into a good light and we can go from there.”
wanted, even though I thought you might like—fucking hell, I could not stop thinking about kissing you the entire time. But I was really starting to like
like the snow. It’s probably my favourite thing about going to boarding school in Scotland. We don’t really get proper snow where I’m from, not like here.”
“You’re sure?” Harry doesn’t know why he asks it, what he really means by it until Malfoy answers him.
“It’s okay, Malfoy,” says Harry, stepping forward. “Look, my office is really close by. I’ve probably got something you can wear.”
It’s not even been an hour when he can hear the familiar tap-tap-tap of an owl at the studio window. Draco let’s it in and unties the missive, raising an eyebrow as the bird doesn’t move, waiting for a response.
There was a ministry social event - Draco can’t even remember what for, but he was there in a professional capacity only anyway. And if anyone recognised him as
, his brain helpfully corrected. Draco’s cheeks grew hot and he ducked his head down, as if that would hide anything.
Harry doesn’t even care that Malfoy seems to have caught him out because today Malfoy’s shirt is the periwinkle blue, which happens to be Harry’s favourite. It’s open at the collar and it’s doing something to Malfoy’s skin - Malfoy’s neck - that is frankly pornographic. Harry licks his lips, finding it difficult to look away from the expanse of pale throat. His trousers are the same charcoal grey colour as the other day, still fitting Malfoy like a dream and Harry has to will himself not to hook his fingers in the belt loops and yank him forward.
It got easier to distract himself when Luna came back and sat with them properly. It gave him something to focus on as he tried to keep up with what she was saying (which felt a bit like watching an episode of The West Wing set in Middle Earth) instead of the lack of Potter’s hand on his leg (which was shit).
.” Theo looked back at Harry, grinning maliciously. “By the way, Draco’s the one that’s been messaging you. He knew it was you from the start. He’s been messing you about this whole time.”
. He pulls back and thrusts back in, shallow and gentle, feeling Malfoy clench and relax around him.
“Yes,” Draco says. “You said you were busy. With meetings. That I needed to make it worth your while.”
So Harry doesn’t stop. Doesn’t stop until Malfoy clenches around him, coming all over his stomach and his fist and shouting Harry’s name.
Harry reaches out to stop him, pushing encouragingly on Malfoy’s hip. “On your front.” Malfoy’s eyes widen slightly when he sees Harry toss the vial onto the bed, so Harry kisses him. “Please?”
“Do you come here often?” Draco asks and immediately cringes, flushing a deep pink as Potter laughs. “You know what I mean. You’re...
If he’d ever gone back, he might have been able to fix his shoulder himself, might have been able to sort out whatever Not-Moody’s punishment had fucked up.
[13:35] Anyway, I asked very politely to see where it was stated that plants of any variety were against the rules
“Later?” Harry asks, and a small kiss is pressed against the rough pad of Harry’s thumb followed by a nod.
It wasn’t a big deal anyway. Just a dull, twist-twinge ache he felt in his shoulder when he overexerted himself playing Quidditch or didn’t stretch properly or fuck,
The crowd was starting to disperse, lending Draco a much better view which, he realised, also gave Harry a much better view of
Draco had often let himself daydream of what his animagus form would be. During first year, watching Professor McGonagall turn herself into a cat and back again, he decided quite vehemently that he was going to be a dragon. Like his namesake. He was going to be huge and powerful and everyone would be scared of him. Especially Cassius Warrington. He’d breathe fire at Cassius Warrington. He’d make Cassius Warrington cry, just like he’d made Theo cry. (Though when he’d told Theo this, Theo had glared at him, and said that he hadn’t cried at all. Draco was being stupid. “Besides,” he’d sniffed, “it’s not like you actually get to
Draco reached for the menu but Potter’s hand shot out lightning-fast, his warm and slightly rough fingers wrapping firmly around Draco’s wrist, thumb settling on the pulse-point as he lowered Draco’s hand to the table and held him in place.
“Oh - yes, they do. That’s so the light doesn’t affect the developing chemicals. Wizarding photography is a bit different but I do both, depending on what’s needed or what I just prefer, and that’s all based down at the studio. It’s a good setup really, sometimes I do portrait work there too if Luna or a client want something more...
Potter looked hesitant, but then he was shuffling into the other part of corner banquette, not quite next to Draco, but as close as it was possible to be. Their knees bumped under the table, and Draco found he was quite horrified by the pleasurable little thrum he felt zip up his spine.
arse clad in form-fitting charcoal trousers that certainly left nothing to the imagination (which needn’t have mattered, as Harry’s imagination did perfectly fine on it’s own thank you very much). Malfoy is gesturing to the empty fruit basket and murmuring something Harry couldn’t make out and then the other man winks at him before scurrying off, returning moments later with an armful of peaches and handing Malfoy the biggest, peachiest-looking peach in the fucking pile.
The only time the good feeling slips is when Potter deflects a question about job satisfaction and Draco asks, “fuck Potter, do you even
Malfoy might be Iron Man, Harry is useless at questions, Hermione steals a plant and Snuggling might be a euphamism.
Potter’s eyes are the same as they’d always been really, disarmingly bright and beautiful. Draco finds he can’t look at them too long lest he give himself away. At least Potter’s hair has always been a chaotic disaster, perhaps a small comfort can be found there.
“You. This.” he says, smiling against Draco’s mouth, his thumb running soft over Draco’s cheek.  “And
“Was that an Auror move? Seems a bit overtly sexual for DMLE.” Malfoy struggles against him experimentally before giving himself over to Harry’s control. “Well this hardly seems fair, Potter.” He doesn’t look at all disgruntled by the chain of events.
Harry’s gaze drops to Malfoy’s hands when there’s a shift beside him, the pressure between their pressed-together arms increasing ever so slightly. Harry doesn’t know why he looks down, but he can see that Malfoy has the cuff of his loaned jumper held between thumb and forefinger and is sort of mindlessly caressing the fabric between his fingertips. It’s oddly fascinating to watch. Malfoy only lets go when his name is called, straightening the cuffs as if he’s wearing a shirt which Harry thinks is sort of funny.
[10:14] He could have just left a pile of clothes on his bed and covered them up in an attempt to tidy up his side of the room
Harry returns to the training room with his arms full of sandwiches and dressed in fitted jeans with a soft, dark green jumper. It’s cashmere, and probably one of the nicest things he owns. He actually feels quite fancy in it. The green also happens to make his eyes pop. Or something. That’s what Hermione says anyway.
Draco took a step back, breathing hard and fast, clouds of fog dispelling into the wintery night air as he looked wildly around him, his eyes finally landing on Harry’s face, his expression completely unreadable.
[21:26] You told your godfather a stranger you text tried to get you in trouble and he was impressed
He’s in his Auror jacket, which is a deep burgundy colour. It has gold fastenings down the front and gold epaulettes. It fits him perfectly (
“Hello. I’m just calling to make sure you’re not dead or, at the very least, y’know… maimed, which you’re clearly not so…goodbye.”
Potter snorted. Draco kicked him gently under the table and tried not to notice Potter hiding a smile as he did it back.
[13:30] I think you and I are a bit beyond the pleasantries seeing as you asked if liked being peed on last week
Malfoy bursts out laughing and can’t seem to stop so Harry has to bodily shove him inside, closing the door behind both of them. He tries very hard to look annoyed at being laughed at, but Harry’s chest is thrum-thrum-thrumming at the sound.
It feels like his left arm is being broken and set on fire and flayed all at once as teeth sink into pristine pale flesh and Draco releases a high, guttural scream that only dies out when he starts to lose consciousness.
to do but instinctively he holds back, knowing that Malfoy should be the one to decide what happens next.
Up close like this Harry was slightly taller than Draco thought or remembered. But he’d still had to
“In a minute.” Potter holds it out of his reach and reads off another question. “‘Where do you see yourself in five years’ time?’
“Alright Harry. Let me know about Will, okay?” He knows she’s trying to sound casual, but there's an undercurrent of something else in the way she speaks to him. “When you’ve figured out what you want.”
“I’m lying on my bed in all my interview clothes. Not sure I can even be bothered to get changed I’m so fucking shattered.”
Harry’s smile dropped immediately, his face clouding with darkness as he glanced away, jaw tight with tension.
[20:09] The manor is fairly big but I’d grown up in it, I was a bit on the small side when I was 11 and Slytherin Prep just felt so huge and terrifying and there were all these weird noises that I wasn’t used to. I think I got lost every day for the first month that I was there
“A bit, yeah.” Potter pours Draco a glass of water and pushes it over before doing the same for himself. “It’s a nice place. I don’t get hassled. So.”
Harry doesn’t hear what he is, just hears a low guttural sound as he wraps his mouth around Malfoy’s cock and takes in as much of him as he can, loving the weight of it on his tongue, the feel of the head butting against his throat. He feels rather than sees Malfoy yank off the red jumper and flop back onto the bed, hears him release a shaky sigh as Harry starts to suck in earnest, hollowing his cheeks and curling his tongue around the head of Malfoy’s cock whenever he draws back. When he hears the tempo switch of Malfoy’s breathing he goes as deep as he keen, feeling inexplicably harder when Malfoy’s hips twitch and he fucks up into Harry’s mouth. Harry moans at the feeling, sucks harder, encouraging Malfoy to do it again. And again. And again.
that had made him feel this way, he knew talking to Harry would have made him feel better. He’d listen (well, read), make him laugh, maybe flirt a little.
” Draco practically growled it out, trying to keep quiet as Harry smiled against his skin, as he licked and kissed and sucked at a particularly sensitive spot on Draco’s neck.
Greyback comes out of the darkness, snatches him up and flings him against a tree like he weighs absolutely nothing. Draco lands with an indelicate thud onto the damp, mulchy ground in a crumpled heap before he’s being hauled up again.
Potter loves the food and tells Draco that they need to come back immediately so he can try everything else. They muddle through the rest of the interview questions, Potter making jokes and scribbling down answers and doodling all over the place, pestering Draco to answer questions of his own. It’s wonderful and easy and Draco doesn’t really want him to go back to work or to go home himself, not alone at least.
So, Draco and his notebook and quill are set up at a little table in the DMLE break room and each Auror he has photographed sits with him, blushing like proverbial virgins when it dawns on each and every one that Draco has seen them utterly starkers. They all leave happy enough though, grinning with both a touch of embarrassment and pride, which Draco thinks is quite sweet actually. They’re alright, the Aurors.
Draco blinked twice in quick succession at the sight before him: flushed cheeks, flustered pushing-up of sleeves, a sudden fascination with the bowl of sugar cubes in the centre of their table. Draco plucked one out and popped it in his mouth, noting that Potter’s eyes followed every movement, lingering on his lips for a touch too long to be considered totally innocent as Draco sucked on the cube.
“Good grief no, Neville isn’t like that at all. And we weren’t really friends back then. But no, he’d never tease me about something like that.”
Yes, budget meetings. You know how much I love those. You better make this interview worth my while.
When he releases Harry, the uncertainty has vanished and Malfoy gives him a once-over, arching a perfect blond eyebrow. “And
“I know what you mean.” Potter laughs, but there’s no real mirth in it which Draco finds he doesn’t like.
- and seemed liked a bit of prick if he was being perfectly honest - makes no move to vacate his position at the desk.
McGonagall had turned him back and he’d taken deep, desperate lungfuls of air until the panic subsided. Being transformed on the fly had felt like being suffocated and squeezed and broken and reshaped which, he supposed, he had been. Not-Moody had been unashamedly smug, McGonagall appropriately horrified.
Then his stomach lurches and the world tilts sideways and he rolls onto his front, holding himself up on his hands and knees, dry heaving and choking in equal measure before vomiting blood.
. He feels a thrilling little thrum of pleasure in the pit of his belly when Malfoy’s ears turn pink, sees the corners of his mouth turn up a little.
anything at all and Hogsmeade is quite big, I’m sure the entire village isn’t masking a secret entrance to Slytherin Prep
“I know,” said Harry eventually, his jaw tightening a little. “D’you really think I’m going to listen to anything that dickhead says? He tried to get me banned from your school.”
before looking up at him, his brow furrowed. “Why are you so flushed? Did you just come from outside?”
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry said. “Even if you hadn’t, I would have. I didn’t want to wait anymore.” He twisted up to face Draco like they had before, arms loosely wrapped around the back of Draco’s neck, his face relaxed and happy. “You were right about us.
He hadn’t heard from Harry all day, not since their impromptu late night chat. It wasn’t like Draco had

Draco’s arms have been stretched out, perpendicular to his body, bony wrists pinned to the polished rosewood ballroom floor. The movement had tugged at something, dull and achingly familiar in his right shoulder and he’d just thought: Potter.
"Gryffindor's sword." Hermione said immediately. "It's in Dumbledore's office. That should do the trick." Harry nodded. That was doing something. Doing something was vastly preferable to nothing, which left him wallowing in grief.
"And? Are you suggesting I was wrong for wanting to protect my fellow Gryffindors from a dastardly midget? Who knows what house they could have been from! I was performing important disciplinary measures!"
Third year it was announced Peter Pettigrew had escaped from Azkaban. Except oh wait, he'd actually escaped years earlier and no one had noticed, because the rat just slipped through the bars as soon as he got there. So, security had been tightened so much around Harry that he couldn't even talk to Ron and Hermione for three weeks. As if he had needed more separation from the rest of student body. Plus, Ron's rat Snuffles had died, that was kind of a bummer. Even worse, he had had to watch Snape's hatred of his dads spill over all year until Remus *somehow* got outed as a werewolf. Then there was the tiny matter of the Dementors and the kiss they had tried to give him while he and Hermione were looking for his father in the woods.
How are you doing? Bet it's quiet at home without me. Made it to Hogwarts safely and thankfully with no house-elf interference. Lessons are going well; we haven't had Snape yet though so I'm not looking forward to that.
"Keep at it." his father advised, "he'll appreciate it whether he shows it or not." Harry nodded again.
"Ok maybe we don't need to talk. Maybe I just need to talk, and I need you to hear it, even if you won't listen. I love you. And I'm so sorry. And while I might not like the Malfoys, I have no say in your relationship and I should never have pretended otherwise. If he's who you choose, then I accept that and I will love him for your sake and cherish the both of you." The continued lack of response was starting to make Sirius desperate. "Please Harry. I don't know if you forgive me, but I just need to know that you still love me. I know I royally fucked up and I'm sorry." The tears were staring to fall. "I..... I just need my baby back. Please, Bambi?"
Harry's face flushed. "We've... slept together," he admitted. "Not like that!" he hastened to add, as his dad looked like he was about to either crow or swear. "We're not there yet. We've just been seeming time together and fallen asleep. And normally he falls asleep right away, but he hasn't been recently. I can still feel him tossing as I drift off. Plus, it's really hard sometimes to wake him up." Now his whole face was burning, like a bizarre audition to be the next Weasley sibling.
"Right." Harry focused and shook himself out of the silly grin he was wearing at seeing his dads again. Hogwarts was amazing and truly a second home, but he did miss them quite a bit. "It was about two things really. Dumbledore's lessons, and....."
Draco stiffened and pulled away from Harry. He stood there, arms now wrapped around himself, clearly reliving that morning. Harry couldn't imagine how it must feel, knowing you had to swear allegiance to someone so evil and against everything you stand for, else all you loved would perish. He put a hand in Draco's shoulder. When it wasn't rejected, he turned the boy to face him and lifted his chin. "Hey. I love you. And I don't give two shits what anyone else thinks."
"WHAT?" roared Sirius, jumping up from his seat on the couch. "That pure-blooded, murdering, Death Eater?"
"Hello love." Harry said, smiling. They kissed briefly, before Harry pulled away and buried his face in his boyfriend's chest. "You don't have to do this, you know." He mumbled hopefully, his words muffled by the fabric of Draco's jumper. He felt, rather than heard, Draco's huff of laughter.
"Dead? Yes, I believe so. Unintended but ultimately unavoidable. Do not pity the dead, remember Harry. Pity the liv-"
"I guess he doesn't want to be found." muttered Sirius, sliding his back down a tree trunk to sit amongst the roots. "I can hardly blame him."
Remus shrugged, finishing his tea. "I noticed it when we were at school and it only got confirmed once I was part of the faculty."
Sirius looked mildly impressed. "My uncle bought it in July 1955. One of the last ones produced, I reckon. Went to me after he died. Top speed of 125, with a 998-cc engine and a compression rate of 7:3:1."
And this defence, this love, Dumbledore had told them, was the most crucial part. Lily's love for her son had created a magical protection that Voldemort, unloved as he was, could never have understood. So, when the Darkest wizard of all time had turned his wand on baby Harry, the spell had backfired. Lily's protection meant that it was Voldemort, not Harry, who felt the effects of the Killing Curse. So, he was shattered, reduced to almost nothing. What little that was left had only survived due to some kind of Dark magic and had fled in exile to an Albanian forest.
Once the haunt and home of the Marauders, the Shrieking Shack had become a safe space for Harry to be with the man he loved, away from the prying eyes of Hogwarts students or staff. Harry heard a noise behind him and turned to see Draco stepping of the fireplace. Without a word, the Slytherin wrapped his arms around Harry, resting his head on Harry's shoulder. His muffled voice came from the crook of Harry's neck.
Sirius was so shocked he turned human again and sat up. "Invite him to dinner? Bring the Slytherin into our home? The viper to our bosom? How dangerous is that?"
Remus glared at the annoying Animagus. "Harry, you can tell us anything, and as long as they treat you right, we will treat them as one of the family."
Draco stared him dead in the eye. "You're not getting Harry. Not now, not ever." There were murmurs as people realised what he had done. In his peripherals, he could see Remus and Sirius advancing either side of him at the head of the huge crowd. He had no time for them; he was entirely focused on the seething creature in front of him. Frankly, he was amazed he was still alive - Voldy must have just been too shocked to remember his magic. But the Dark Lord looked to be gathering his wits.
Remus' thoughts suddenly ground to a halt. Oh. If he'd gone anywhere near a certain someone, there was no chance of them finding him. It was a risk to even try to look, in case they brought attention to Harry or to a boy who could potentially be in a more vulnerable position than even the Boy Who Lived. At least Harry was protected most of the time. If what he said about Malfoy not being a Death Eater was true, the boy could be in serious danger from his own family. Better to keep a low profile.
Sirius nodded slowly. Then he leant his head on Remus' shoulder and just closed his eyes, blocking out the world for a few moments. Remus squeezed Sirius' hand and stood up, pulling the Animagus with him. There was no point sitting around when jobs around the house needed doing. The family inside might be cracking, but the wallpaper would not.
"Nothing, I just... I think we should go home. Clearly, we're not going to find him, and I'd rather be there for him when he gets back then chase our tails all over the globe." Better to give this as a reason than what Remus suspected was the truth. No need to give Sirius more reason to go charging into Malfoy Manor. He'd only succeed on getting himself killed.
"Of course, Harry," replied Remus. "Come sit." He motioned for him to sit on the sofa beside where he himself had just sat down, leaving the other sofa free for Sirius to stretch out. This Sirius did, lying on his stomach with his chin resting on his crossed arms. Harry sat, too, though far less casually. They waited for him to say something.
Sirius smirked. Then his face changed to a more thoughtful expression, contemplative and oddly out of character for him. "I can't believe we took so long to get together. All the way till Sixth Year?!"
He gasped some air into his lungs and opened his eyes to blinding light. The person dragging him let out a sigh of relief and let go. Draco pulled himself to a sitting position, blinking rapidly to adjust his vision, and realised that, not only was he still alive, but he was also still at Hogwarts. It appeared that someone had dragged him into an alcove, away from the heat of battle. Realising there was a figure standing over him, he looked up into the face of his rescuer and his eyes nearly popped out of his head.
Draco barely had time to process his words before a horrible pain erupted in his head. He wondered dimly, falling to his knees, if this was how Harry felt when his scar hurt. Somehow, he doubted it. This was less of a burn, which was how his boyfriend usually described it, and more of a searching, digging pain, like someone was cutting the memories out of his mind with a rusty spoon. But then, as quickly as it had started, it stopped. Draco, shaking himself, glanced up and realised Voldemort had been distracted again, this time by... his in-laws.
Harry tugged him forward, causing a tiny but nonetheless undignified noise to escape from the back of Draco’s throat.
“Oh. Yes of course.” Draco sets his pen down, feeling like a total prat for rushing in. And it’s not like Draco really
[11:18] If I went to Puddifoot’s, the ONLY café in Hogsmeade, which also happens to be the ONLY business open at 8:30ish, and asked about a young chap, bundled up against the morning chill and probably wearing a red Griffin scarf…would they remember you?
[04:24] Actually I do because then you can suffer right along with me which you thoroughly deserve for waking me up at an indecent hour TWICE you prick
Even around his fingers Malfoy is still tight and Harry’s not being egotistical but he’s not exactly
For a moment neither of them move. Then Harry stalks forward out of the lift and Malfoy is on him before the doors ding shut.
Potter hadn’t waited for Draco to step out of his office before stripping off the Auror jacket with an amusing little huff. But then Esther had just
So Draco had played his part, the way he suspected others were too. He pretended not to be scared. He pretended he was pleased. He was monumentally cruel on the train and hexed for his efforts. And he pretended like none of it mattered because Voldemort couldn’t be back, he couldn’t be. Potter had to have got it wrong. Something else had to have happened. He was going to go home and feel safe and his parents would explain and it would all be fine.
And Malfoy’s so tight and hot and beautiful around his cock that Harry sort of wants to stay there until he remembers that he needs to
[10:44] Maybe. I have a dinner thing later and I still need to edit the 700 words of absolute wank I wrote last night
Another small kiss, reassuring and sweet, like it was something Harry did all the time without even thinking about it.
Harry doesn’t need to stay here for this. He’s mostly finished the Shepherds Pie which he suspects is the root cause of the uncomfortable gurgling occurring in his belly and he really ought to get stuck into writing up the case report for that...case. But he is entitled to an hour for lunch, and Hermione is always telling him to take proper breaks so he remains seated, watching Malfoy walk to a table of his own. All he’s got for lunch is that bloody peach. Malfoy meets his eye for a second and smirks before promptly ignoring him.
“No, thank you.” Harry doesn’t ignore the way Malfoy’s tone has come out a little clipped. “What about you, Potter?”
But then Potter tilted his head, considering Draco for a moment as he ran his thumb back and forth, back and forth over his lower lip. He hummed thoughtfully and after a beat he smiled back at Draco, slow and dangerously wicked. “Alright then, let’s see what you’re made of.”
When it’s Malfoy’s turn to pay for his food, Harry’s ears prick up at the sound of his laugh. It’s unexpected, gravelly and flirtatious, and Harry peers over to see that a good-looking wizard has come out of the kitchen to speak to him. He’s practically
Out of the corner of his eye, he watched as Potter picked up his phone, put it down, picked it up again. His thumbs skating quickly over the screen. He put it down again. Shook his head. Picked it back up.
Potter waves a hand at him and smiles politely. “Oh, no thank you. Just some water and two glasses would be great if you don’t mind.”
The waitress arrives to take their order and Draco’s so distracted by thoughts of what Potter’s home looks like he realises he hasn’t chosen anything and just asks for the same as Potter himself.
The pressure building at the base of his spine is too familiar and his hands fly to Malfoy’s hips, slowing him down but not pushing him away; Harry’s cock is achingly hard in his jeans and every drag and press against Malfoy makes him shiver with need.
A gnarled, dirty hand clamps over his mouth, cutting him off as he continues to struggle. The hand shifts, briefly pinches his nose, cutting off his air supply.
Draco’s distinctly less-than-pure mind gallivanted off through a thousand Harry-related scenarios, his skin feeling tingly and flushed. As he shifted in his desk chair, he decided he might need another minute or two before going to meet Neville for dinner.
, so he shimmies down and - still stroking and teasing - flicks his tongue over the other nipple. Malfoy’s hands fly up to his face and he bites down on a knuckle to stifle a moan.
“I might actually have someone for you,” she says, “if you’re interested. He's ever so nice, a bit quiet but lovely when you get to know him, he’s cute, and he’s never seemed phased by the fact that you’re a bit famous.”
A shiver runs up his spine when Potter extends one of those hands to him, a cheeky glint in his eye. “Come on Malfoy, run away with me?”
“Boring,” says Harry, sliding his hands around to Malfoy’s back, pulling him in tight. “Couldn’t stop thinking about this.” Harry swallows, feeling nervous. “Us.”
It’s not ideal, of course. Thinking about Potter while he’s lying in his own urine, scared out of his fucking mind, but there he is anyway. Unbidden and distinct.
“I don’t– “ Draco silences his protest with a kiss, moving his lips slow and soft, before nudging Harry up the bed and under the covers. “Hush now, bedtime.”
Malfoy bumps their shoulders together, the way he always does in the training sessions, as Sebastian disappears with a frown to gather the peaches. Malfoy hasn’t bumped
“Someone who doesn’t like Harry…” says Ron, oblivious to the exchange that has occurred, “Someone like…”
“I know!” Draco made an anguished sound. Harry was referring to that night at the pub, he had to be. “Fuck, I
Thoughts of Malfoy’s not-unattractiveness need to stay buried in the recesses of Harry’s mind though, along with the shoulder-bumps and the soft smiles and the coffee visits and that one time he made Malfoy laugh so hard it had made Harry’s heart soar. That was the day Harry realised his feelings were more-than-friendly and more-than-purely-physical, that seeing Malfoy, being around him, had become the best part of Harry’s day. It frustrated him that he couldn’t even remember what had been so funny in the first place, because afterwards he found he wanted to make Malfoy laugh like that all the time. He remembered the way Malfoy’s head had landed on his shoulder as he shook with laughter. Harry had wanted to bury his face in the crook of Malfoy’s neck, just nuzzle against the bare skin there and breathe him in forever. Malfoy had squeezed Harry’s bicep as he’d straightened up, lifting his head, meeting his eyes as his fingers ran down the full length of Harry’s arm, lingering on the pulse point of his wrist
Draco was the first to finally get to the actual drink. His eyes widening in horror because somehow it was
Draco huffed out a small laugh and looked down at his cup, running a gloved thumb on the edge of the lid.
Malfoy’s hips roll against his and Harry moves his hands down to grip the curve of his arse and holy fucking hellfire it’s delicious. Harry’s not sure he ever wants to let go and thinks about staying exactly where they are, hands firm and steady on Malfoy’s perfect arse as they rub up against each other, desperate and needy in the hallway until they both come. He can feel how hard Malfoy is against him and there’s definitely no hiding his own arousal.
Which makes me think I am reading too much into the hat comment? If he knew who I was he wouldn’t be flirting at all
thinks Draco, lifting his hand to Potter’s in what can only be referred to as a spectacularly embarrassing display of surrender.
[21:53] Would you not prefer to direct that delightful charm at someone a bit more available, say, in the actual pub?
Potter shifted awkwardly and nodded past Draco at the door to Puddifoot’s. “Are you going inside? It’s just a bit cold out here and you’re very much blocking the way.”
“And in case you’re wondering about this later, it was your instant messenger. You always did forget to log out on your computer,
He’d wondered about the tie thing too, in the late night quiet of his room. Did Harry like being tied up? Or was it the thought of someone else at his mercy that flipped his switch? Would Draco be into that? What would Harry do to him in that position? Would he be slow and teasing? Would he like it if Draco begged a little?
“Nah!” he exclaims, a bit too loudly as he pushes his chair back, “I just remembered…I’ve got…paperwork and…things, important Auror things…deadline…”
“I have the final results from the session,” says Malfoy, clearing his throat and looking a bit flustered as he flips through his notebook. He finds a page, rips it out and hands it to Harry. “For when you debrief, if you want to use them. I’ve already broken the news that nobody beat you.”
Harry settles his palms on Malfoy’s thighs either side of him, runs his palms up and down the taut muscle, the fine hair there soft against his skin as his boxers are slipped off; his furiously red prick springs free and he instinctively lifts a hand towards it, but Malfoy bats him away, wrapping his pale fingers firmly around the shaft, stroking him excruciatingly slowly.
“That’s n-“ Potter shakes his head looking a little flushed and grasps a menu. “Can I at least order first?”
The doors ding open on level 2, the large DMLE sign looming intimidatingly above the front reception. The girl behind the counter smiles cheerfully at him as he steps out, looking somewhat relieved to not be carrying on the conversation with the Auror hanging around her desk.
, this was brutal. He should have left when he had the chance. Turned around and fucked off back to school. This was
Harry slowly pushes up the hem of the red jumper, exposing Malfoy’s torso. “I love that you wore this. Loved seeing you in something that’s
it as such.” Draco takes a sip of his water. “It’s just...not what I want to spend all my time doing. And sometimes they’re really tedious.”
The thin fabric of Potter’s t-shirt has rucked up enough during their slightly awkward amble that Draco’s hand has slipped underneath the hem, resting somewhere between Potter’s hip and the small of his back and Draco’s mind is racing like mad with the feel of him, all heat and soft skin.
He says it in a way that is so plain and simple that Draco just blinks back at him in astonishment, which Potter seems to take as a cue to continue talking.
Besides you knew who I was talking about and you’re the only person at school I have any actual interest in talking to anyway so
Neville insisted on a spot that was close enough that Draco had an eyeful of Harry but far enough away that they could talk about him without the fear of being overheard. Harry was manning a small table that held more of the silver canisters and worked with Weasley to serve up complimentary hot beverages.
“Behave yourself now,” Harry says, but then he’s reaching between them and wrapping his fingers firmly around the base of Malfoy’s cock.
work, hm? Is that what you’d call the calendar?” Potter says, nudging his ankle under the table. His mouth curves in amusement as he lifts his mug and takes a sip, his eyes never leaving Draco’s.
But Malfoy catches Harry’s mouth back up into a kiss, licks tentatively at the tender spot on Harry’s lip and starts to pull him forward.
She doesn’t look sorry though, Harry notes, neither of them bloody do. And then he feels his mouth tugging mutinously into an embarrassed grin which sets all three of them off again.  His laugh only starts to falter when a familiar shock of white-blond hair enters his peripheral vision and moves swiftly behind his friends. Practically
—before Harry let out a pleased little hum, quickly moved his hands to the back of Draco’s neck and stretched up to press as much of himself against Draco as he possibly could, making it very abundantly clear that he very much did fucking
“What? What place?” Draco asks, suddenly confused about this imaginary conversation he’s supposed to have had.
“Ooh, have you? How tremendously exciting!” Luna reached out and gripped Draco’s arm, her face inexplicably serious and solemn as she stared up at him. “You simply must join us, Draco Malfoy. I want to hear all about it!”
“Let him up.” A fourth voice, delivering the final order in a way that comes out more like a growl than a clear, cohesive sentence, and Draco immediately wants to vomit. “I like it when they
“Michael’s on his way,” he said, directing his attention to Luna. “I might just go and, er - sit. Over there. I should probably wait for him over there.”
They lie like that for a long time, Draco curled up in Harry’s arms, head tucked under Harry’s chin, pressing little fluttery-soft kisses to Harry’s throat; when Harry feels the tingling coolness of a cleaning charm wash over his body, he pulls back from a grumbly Draco and peers at him curiously.
Harry and he didn’t trust himself not to cave (and his willpower had proved utterly useless in the face of Harry rescuing his bloody book).
Draco wondered, feeling his eyebrows knit together in a frown. But then a remembered comment flitted briefly through his thoughts.
He stills, but the hand doesn’t come away. The edges of his vision turn hazy as unfamiliar voices talk around him, but Draco tries to focus. He needs to.
“I’m still sorry I didn’t tell you,” Draco murmured, his voice muffled somewhat by Harry’s feathery black hair.
Harry allows himself to watch Malfoy for a little longer. He’s still working on that bloody peach. Harry’s eyes follow the stone fruit, held between thumb and forefinger, to a set of perfect white teeth biting into soft juicy flesh. It’s a bit annoying really.
Draco didn’t need to look to know it was him, he knew his voice well. Too well. Something vaguely sick-feeling dropped into his stomach as he moved to step away from the table. Theo grabbed for Draco’s elbow and roughly pulled him back, pulling him close. Harry’s eyes narrowed on Theo’s grip.
It’a a unique sort of torture, particularly when Potter is idly running his thumb across his lower lip and even worse when is tongue darts out and licks the upper one.
what I do.” Draco smiles, because he realises how true it is and that thought makes him happy. “Working for Luna is wild and sometimes I meet some interesting people at the charity events. I’m sorry if you were expecting something deep and profound, but I do feel the need to point out that I just spent an afternoon taking pictures of twelve naked Aurors for a
“Whatever gets you to say yes.” Harry grins, feeling thoroughly charming as Malfoy laughs (his real laugh, Harry knows it) and kisses him again.
“Oh shit,” Esther breathes, stopping abruptly in the corridor and laying a surprisingly firm hand on Draco’s arm. “Wait here.”
“It was just cows.” Draco sips his wine and Potter gives him a bemused look. “At the magical animal sanctuary. It was just cows. I took photos for over two hours in a cold, wet, muddy field wearing horrible muggle wellies for completely normal, ordinary non-magical cows.”
(bloody fucking hell) and Draco could feel himself starting to blush and panic because fuck, what was he
Harry points his tongue and works at the hole, rosy pink and tiny, pushing firm and eager to open him up. When his tongue presses inside, Malfoy presses back, seeking more of him and Harry feels dizzy with it; fucking into Malfoy with his tongue, the taste and feel of him, Malfoy murmuring things like
[11:19] I’ll have you know I was all prepared to rescue you from the perils of the forbidden forest, and the only thanks I get for my endeavour is
The Dark Lord had returned, his father was seeking some sort of absolution and the price, it seemed, was Draco.
Draco doesn’t move, just watches Potter take his stuff. “October. Some international quidditch thing.”
he pull this off? This Luna was something of an unknown oddity but Potter had already established - probably to his own regret now - that Draco had taken a
“Remember I told you I was supposed to go to SP? Well I was at that open day in the summer,” Harry explained. “Nobody talked to me, except for you. Well, it was more like you were talking
[21:17] Christ I want to hear all those needy little sounds I know you’d make for me when I kiss you there
But he doesn’t do that, just pats the space on the bed next to him and shuffles up, waits for Draco to awkwardly sit on the edge before he speaks again.
And then she’s disappearing through a door that appears to be closing him off from a very heated argument. Draco stares at it for a moment, at the gold letters spelling out
And Harry, to Draco’s immense surprise and consternation, burst out laughing. “Oh my god. I immediately take back calling you clever.
; he’s flushed and pink and lovely, a sheet of sweat covering his entire body, grey eyes glaring up at him dark and wild and there’s something almost feral in there too, like he could absolutely kill Harry if he doesn’t fuck him right now. Malfoy reaches for his own cock again, impossibly hard and leaking precome over his stomach. Harry licks it off, grabs Malfoy’s hands and pins them down by his head, giving his wrists a gentle squeeze.
in the cock-department; which of course Malfoy already knows because he was openly ogling it when Harry stripped off. It was brilliant.
Harry discovers them in the early hours of the morning, his chest flush against Draco’s back, arm curled protectively around Draco’s lithe torso. They’re so faint Harry almost misses them, creeping up into the blond hair at the nape of his neck. Harry nuzzles into them, smiling against Draco’s skin as he lets out a contented little sigh and falls back asleep.
“Fuck off.” Potter laughs properly then, leaning forward and reaching for Draco’s pen. “When was that?”
Such as it is, when Malfoy finally does lean in and softly press his lips to Harry’s, it’s overwhelming how much he just
sorry, Harry. I know you trusted me when you told me about that – that guy you liked.” Draco swallowed thickly, squashing down a flare of jealousy he knew he had absolutely no right to feel. “Or still like, I don’t know. Obviously that’s none of my business.”
[11:18] What is this? Aren’t you going to ask how I am? After it was I who so gallantly ensured your safe arrival home last night?
Draco couldn’t stop the disgruntled little sound that escaped when Harry broke away from him, and blushed when Harry chuckled darkly, kissing all the way along to the hinge of his jaw
Remus prevented the rest of Sirius' jest with an enveloping kiss before gently nibbling his mate's earlobe. This elicited a series of whimpers from Sirius as he continued his wet assault downwards, occasionally nipping at areas of torso he knew to be particularly sensitive. Flicking his tongue out when he reached the navel, he blew a cool breath across the pale skin.
"Yeah, he has. His right hand's all burned and shrivelled, he has to use his left hand for his wand. Why?"
Draco nodded. "Yeah, this could complicate things. I don't know if the backup thing will work either, Father's got very nosy and interfering lately."
Sirius lifted his head off his arms and let out a noise that sounded like half exasperated sigh and half amused laughter with a touch of relief in there too. "Moony." He said calmly. "Our son. The child of two flamboyantly gay fathers. Is having an aneurysm. Over our acceptance. Of him being a flaming bisexual."
Harry shook his head; his mouth had gone dry. "I... I don't even know where Draco is right now. For all I know, he's-"
"Of course! That whole family is rotten to the core! Elitist, pureblood supremacists who'd rather none of us existed!"
Lying spread-eagled at the foot of the Astronomy Tower, limbs sprawled at unnatural angles, and glasses hanging off one ear, was Albus Dumbledore.
"Draco..." Narcissa choked. Then she screamed again. "DRACO!" She turned on her sister. "YOU KILLED MY SON!"
When he came to, for the second time that morning, Draco saw an even more unlikely face than he had the first time. It was freckled for one thing, with ginger hair.
Sirius looked deep in thought for a few moments, then snorted and looked at Remus. "How about the 'completely hypothetical' question you asked Minerva about eating in Animagus form that time when I ate all the chocolate as a dog?"
"YOU'RE A FUCKING BLACK, DAD. HOW MUCH MORE ELITIST, SUPERMACIST OR PUREBLOOD CAN YOU GET? THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO FUCKING TELL YOU." With that, Harry glared at Sirius, cast a vaguely apologetic look at Remus, and left, slamming the front door behind him.
"The reason... that I was crying today...." Without meaning to, Remus leant forward, desperate to hear what was wrong so that he could make it better.
Sirius looked like he couldn't believe his ears. "My prejudice? MINE? He's dating a FUCKING MALFOY."
Too enraged to speak, she screamed incoherently at him, raising her wand. Draco's wand came up too, and they began a deadly duel. Light flashed and all other battles around them faded away until they could have been the only people in the universe. All Draco could focus on was staying alive, but he was sorely out matched. Bellatrix had been fighting for years, and he was still only 16. She was just too quick for him, and all Draco could do was watch as a red bolt soared from the end of her wand and hit him squarely in the chest. He flew back, hit something hard, and everything went black.
Deep down, Harry knew it was fear and worry that had driven his dad to such an extreme reaction. And those emotions came from love, it was just that in this case they were misplaced. Love had been such a huge part of his life; Harry didn't know who he'd be without it. Love had been what prompted Remus and Sirius to take him in in the first place. Love had been shown when Sirius taught him how to ride a broomstick and when Remus stayed up until 3 in the morning helping Harry with his homework. Love from his dads had raised, nurtured, and shaped him, while love from Draco was guiding and enlightening him. Most importantly, for 14 years, love had protected him.
After an hour or so, Remus heard footsteps on the stairs and directed his wand towards the gramophone, reducing the volume massively. As he pulled away from Sirius, their son came around the corner and paused in the doorway to the living room. Sirius turned, presumably to see what had interrupted their dancing, and held his arms out to Harry. Harry shook his head and spoke quietly.
Harry thought. "One time we talked about my mum, and her sacrifice. Then I had to get a memory from Slughorn, although he gave me a couple of weeks to get that done."
Dumbledore had known he'd be back someday. And in the meantime, he had to keep Harry safe. Unsure of Remus and Sirius' loyalties, what with the Potters having been betrayed, his first thought was to send Harry to his blood family. Voldemort would never have thought of looking for Harry Potter in a Muggle house. But when the two men had arrived, grieving and desperate to keep their godson, he immediately knew that this was the best place for Harry. Not only for his comfort, but also his protection.
Sirius thought for a second, then pouted. "You two are ganging up on me. No fair." With that, he left the room, missing both the chuckles and the high five between Remus and their son.
So that was how they found themselves ten minutes later, looking at the stone gargoyle that guarded the Headmaster's office, and shouting every kind of confection that they could think of, at it.
He stared at the door and leaned in. Pressing his forehead against the wood, he let out another shaky breath. "Harry? Please. Let me in. We need to talk."
It was circular, with flowerbeds all around the outside - home to magical and Muggle flowers of every variety. Delicate silver vines twisted up the sides of the hedge walls. And right at the centre was the garden's main feature. A tall plinth of white marble stood there, inscribed with gold lettering. As Harry drew closer, it was easier to make out each name. There were many. Too many. All in all, over fifty people had given their lives fighting Voldemort thirteen years ago.
Remus looked to be contemplating something. "Well, Fanged Geraniums and Bubotuber pus are both common ingredients in healing potions. I wouldn't be surprised if Severus was making him some to help with his hand. Hopefully, he recovers soon."
And during all of that, he was also figuring out that he was gay. So now he was going into sixth year, where did that leave him? All these tragedies and he had what to show for it? Nothing. Nothing... except.... he had everything. Aside from the colostomy bag, fourth year had also been amazing. It was the year Harry had found someone who truly made him feel normal and at peace. He grinned despite himself as he remembered.
Just as Harry did every year, he got out of bed, dressed, and went for a walk. He walked for almost half an hour, until he reached Hyde Park. Treading the familiar yet mostly unknown path, it wasn't long before he stood in front of a door in the middle of a hedge. He opened the door and stepped through, into a beautiful garden.
It was dark when Harry awoke, a thin line of moonlight shining through the cracks in the boarded-up windows. Momentarily panicking, he saw the head in his lap, remembered where he was, and relaxed. He glanced at his watch, and almost jumped, jostling Draco's head. Gently shaking Draco awake and explaining the time, Harry stood up, kissed his boyfriend, then stepped back. Draco, still bleary-eyed, walked to the fireplace and threw a pinch of the Floo powder from the mantelpiece jar into the dying embers. Harry watched him, already missing the blonde boy. He tried one last idea as Draco turned to face him.
Tearing up the stairs, he came to the dormitory. Shaking the others awake, Ron first, he told them what he'd seen. They all struggled out of bed to the window to see it themselves and woke up with a jolt. Now there was something else there, too. A small group of people were gathered at the bottom of the tower. They couldn’t hear anything from this distance, but the figures almost looked joyous, throwing their heads back in laughter. Only one type of person could be that happy under a Dark Mark. Death Eaters.
"A mess, " agreed Sirius, "but a hot one." Remus smiled and kissed him. Then he stood, offering a hand to assist the Animagus in rising.
Remus hauled him off the sofa and into a waltz position, with Sirius' hand on his back and the other holding his, and Sirius' head resting on Remus' shoulder. There they stood, swaying to and fro, listening to each other's breathing and heartbeats.
By the fifth anniversary, the hurt had lessened a little, and the tone of press coverage more celebratory than mournful. Now, thirteen years later, people had healed and grown. The children going to Hogwarts had never lived during wartime. Voldemort and everything he stood for was being well and truly left in the past, and there was hope and new life blooming. Harry saw that in the lives all around him. Hermione and Ron were married with two girls and steadily on their ways to Minister for Magic and Head Auror, respectively. Captain of the Holyhead Harpies Ginny was in an open relationship with Luna, editor of the Quibbler and part-time botanist. She and Draco often worked closely on potions for his small-time business. Even Neville got his happily ever after - he and Hannah Abbot had just taken over teaching Herbology from Pomona Sprout, who was enjoying her well-earned retirement.
Just then, a timer went off in the kitchen and Remus left, returning with the night's starter, French onion soup. The meal was one of Harry's favourites, and he eagerly tucked in, as did Draco. Sirius, whose usual fare varied from takeaway to cereal to massive chunks of meat, was slightly more reluctant but he eventually started eating.
Harry started, as much as he could fully paralysed, at the sound of the front door being slammed open. Then he heard sprinting footsteps, and Draco's beautiful face came into view. Shaking, he pulled out his wand and muttered the counter-curse, pulling Harry into the tightest embrace of all time as soon as he was on his feet. Suddenly, Draco stepped back, like he was unsure of his actions. As he looked like he was about to launch into an explanation, Harry saved them both some trouble and time and collided his lips against Draco's. Eventually he pulled away, as multiple people starting filing into the room. Ministry officials, it looked like. Harry looked at all of them, looked at Draco, and asked half-question, half-statement he was dreading the answer to.
"But you managed it?" Asked Remus, a note of pride in his voice. As far as he was concerned, Hogwarts and indeed all faculty should be respected, until they came in the way of his son's progress. He was a very academically supportive parent, always ready to help with homework, while Sirius was more likely to throw you a Chocolate Frog and tell you to quit worrying about it.
"YOU UNGRATEFUL BOY!" She screamed. "How DARE you turn against your master? How DARE you defy the Dark Lord?"
Suddenly, the pain stopped, just as quickly as it had begun. Was this death? It was noisy. And not very peaceful. He felt himself being dragged along a floor by his wrists and heard a voice.
Wooden floorboards met his feet as he reappeared, and he wasted no time in striding to the fireplace. Fresh logs were already stacked up, it just took an Incendio charm to light them ablaze and give the drafty room some much-needed heat. Harry looked out between the boards on a window. Despite the summer setting, frost still settled on the highest branches of the trees surrounding him. In the distance, chimneys and puffs of smoke were visible from the charming town of Hogsmeade, but no living soul ventured past than the barbed wire that blocked off Harry's residence.
At this rapid speed, it was clear neither man was going to last, and it wasn't long before Remus felt the tell-tale tightening signs. By Sirius' groaning, he was close too. Remus pumped him a few more times and then came unravelled, exploding in a moment of pure bliss. He felt Sirius go as well, the smaller man painting his own chest and stomach, and Remus collapsed, panting, onto the bed.
So many things could go wrong tonight. Sirius could burst out with another one of those Death Eater comments; Draco could use one of those words he'd been trying to stop using but sometimes slipped up on; Remus could accidentally mention a sore spot. It was all so risky. Plus, Harry didn't quite know how to process how quickly this had all gone. First Draco was a rival, then an enemy, then a secret and now openly his boyfriend? He didn't blame his dads for not seeing it coming, it sounded like some terribly written love story ripped off an original piece.
Ron frowned at his watch. "Half our time's gone, Harry. They'll be here in half an hour. Plus, even if you can get to the snake, how are you going to kill it?"
Remus turned a page in his book on gemstone transfiguration and yawned. Usually books were a welcome distraction from the real world, but tonight this one was failing to even sustain a fragment of his interest. He put it down (with a bookmark in, of course) and stretched his arms out, squeezing his eyes shut. Instead of the air he expected however, he felt a lapful of wet-dog-smelling man fill his arms. Reflexively, he closed his arms around Sirius and tipped himself back until they were lying on their pillows.
"Well, we might as well get on with it." Harry said, turning to open the front door. Draco caught his arm and he looked back at his boyfriend, whose face had gone serious.
And fell, eventually slamming his back into a hard floor. Struggling against his paralysis, he tried to roll, but quickly gave up. He knew where he was - the ceiling above him was that of the living room in Number 12 Grimmauld Place. What Draco had done was loving, stupid, foolish, and so very very brave. He just hoped that his boyfriend didn't pay the ultimate price to keep him safe.
They came slowly, some walking out of the Forest, others from across the drawbridge. Soon they drew close enough for Harry to see the faces of those at the front. Voldemort, of course, was leading. Harry spotted Nagini wrapped around his neck like a weirdly scaly scarf. To his left just behind him was Bellatrix Lestrange, who grinned widely when she saw Harry, and to his right was... Snape. Harry looked into the man's eyes with deepest revulsion, and saw what he had always known was there, below the surface. Pure evil. The man's thin lips were curled in a smirk, and when he looked to his master his expression could only be described as worshipful. In the row behind them, clearly considered lesser Death Eaters, were the Malfoys. Harry heard a sharp intake of breath from Narcissa and felt Draco grip his arm, hard, as mother and son locked eyes.
“Well I’m glad you’re not. I mean - I just - I cried a bit? I’m an angry crier. And I’m still quite snotty. It’s a bit disgusting. Not as disgusting as a sourdough starter obviously.”
His voice is so soft and unsure and fucking vulnerable that as they round another corner Harry almost - almost - stops him in the corridor to tell him just how
“I - yes, probably.” The question throws him, which is why Draco follows it up with, “I only live five minutes from here.”
, before holding his front door open so that Potter can step inside, because he sort of wants to see how this all plays out.
Underneath him, Malfoy stares wide-eyed like Harry has asked him to do something completely impossible, but he nods and dutifully places his hands back where they were, fingers twitching like they want to reach out but can’t.
“Don’t think you’re getting out of this, Malfoy.” Ah, back to Malfoy again. That was reassuringly hostile, even if Potter didn’t sound so in his inflection. “If I have to drink whatever the fuck this is then you do too.”
seem to be overdressed.” It’s true; Harry’s only lost his jacket. He hasn’t even taken his boots off yet. “
then it was only for the quickest of moments before they seemed to get over it once they’d spotted his camera. Bellies sharply sucked in, hair fluffed up as they posed for him, smiled demurely at him. Winked at him. Squeezed his arm a bit too long before he moved away on to the next crowd.
.” He doesn't miss the way Malfoy’s mouth curves up into a wicked little smirk. He trails his fingertips over perfect, pale skin; Harry just wants to touch him
Oh god, he was running his thumbs higher up the insides of Draco’s forearms now, making their way under the cuffs of his jumper. How could something be both too much and not enough? He desperately shoved away thoughts of Harry’s hands everywhere else, thoughts that made him feel a bit melty.
Have you heard from LSE yet? Only Tom hasn’t had a reference request through and the interview was weeks ago now.
) when Harry hears three sharp knocks against his office door. Malfoy’s mouth stills then breaks away from Harry’s. He makes no other move to pull away though, he’s still pressed close, fingertips tracing lazy patterns against the base Harry’s spine.
was, perhaps, putting it on a little bit, Draco made the quiet decision to forget that he’d held Potter’s hand. It had never happened. He had imagined it.
Draco looked back, addressing the crowd but keeping eye contact. "We'll do it together. He killed my mother too."
Slowly, assisted by his friends, Harry made it to the Hall. It was packed, every soul in the castle in this one room. Literally every soul - even the ghosts were floating nervously above their heads. Professor McGonagall left a gaggle of teachers quietly talking and stepped onto the High Table. "If I could have your attention, please." She called, her voice hoarse. Most of the noise died down, thought there were still many weeping.
First year, he had seen himself in the Mirror of Erised as he could never be - normal, unscarred, unremarkable in every way. Then Quirrell and Voldemort had tried to kill him. They had failed, which led to even more attention at school.
He laughed, handing his husband The Mug of Undrinkableness. "That would be around the same time that you were wearing copious amounts of eyeliner, yes?"
Harry felt his arms snap to his sides, his now frozen fingers grasping the coin so tightly it hurt. Slowly, he toppled backwards, hitting the ground hard. Looking up at the sky, he saw Draco lean over him and whisper something. Then he saw a strange blue glow, and he was falling.
"Vanquish the Dark Lord" was pretty obvious. Same with the next line - Lily had faced Voldemort three times and lived. Moon and mark him, again obvious. He was born under a full moon and of course he had his scar. Then it stopped making sense. What kind of power could he possibly have that the Darkest Wizard of All Time didn't know about? Also, what was this bullshit with surviving? Clearly the bit before meant that Harry would have to kill Voldemort, or vice versa, but they were both alive right now, so that last line seemed kind of pointless.
If Sirius had been trying to jargon Draco into confusion, it hadn't worked. The blonde asked a couple of complicated sounding questions, and before long the two had launched into an animated discussion on backbone vs cradle frames. By now utterly lost, Harry was grateful when the arrival of Remus with drinks halted the conversation. As he sipped his pumpkin juice, he heard Remus ask Draco about school.
"JAMES!" Remus awoke to the sound of screams. He looked to his left and saw his husband sitting bolt upright, rocking back and forth, chest heaving. He sat up and gently laid a hand on Sirius' shoulder.
"Nagini? That won't be easy, she's under constant watch even in normal situations, not to mention a deadly creature in her own right."
Remus carried on. "He loves the boy. And I just don't know what to think. Is Harry safe, is Draco safe, is this house even safe?" Padfoot made a noise that was probably dog language for confusion. After all, Number 12 Grimmauld Place was almost certainly the most highly protected house in the country. Even after the Order had moved out 6 months ago, citing it being a too obvious location for Headquarters, the defensive spells and enchantments remained. Remus sighed. "I mean, who knows what Voldemort is planning. It could involve us; it could involve Hogwarts. Merlin forbid he finds out about Draco, or it will definitely involve him."
Harry hated that stupid prophecy. Not only had it meant his birth parents' deaths and almost got his dad killed in the Department of Mysteries, but it also didn’t even make that much sense.
So, by fifth year he'd already escaped Voldemort 5 times, but no one would tell him why. Home had become the Order's headquarters, so it wasn't really home anymore, especially with Snape swishing around every corner. Umbridge. Need he say more? And his Dad had come so close to death. The Stupefy Bellatrix shot had left Sirius toppling towards the Veil, only to be yanked away and revived by Remus as Harry chased after the would-be murderer. Then afterwards, Dumbledore had finally told him and his dads the truth about everything. Why it had to be Harry. Why Voldemort had wanted his blood. Everything.
"Ah yes, wandering the countryside. Near his best friend's house. So, you write me a note making me think he's been KIDNAPPED OR SOMETHING."
Afterwards, Harry couldn't remember why he had ever been worried. Having engrossed Remus in a discussion on magical beast rights over the main course (Steak and potatoes), he then made both Harry's dads laugh hysterically with a joke about Herbology. By the time dessert was finished (Vanilla Panna Cotta), it was clear Draco had charmed the entire household. Harry sent him off with a kiss at the door, following an open invitation from Remus to pop by whenever he liked.
After almost a week of silent treatment from Harry, Remus could see that Sirius was struggling. The final straw came when they woke up one day with Harry gone and no note. Remus knew he was probably just with Draco, but owled around anyway in case anyone had seen him, cross with Harry for taking it this far. There was pain and anger over insults, and then there was this, which was just selfish and worrying. He wasn't too angry though, mostly just concerned for Harry's safety.
There was gasps and shrieks as students noticed the blonde was one of their number. Harry himself moved in front of Draco, shielding his boyfriend from whatever his nemesis intended. Voldemort smiled cruelly. "Oh Draco!" He called again in an almost sing-song tone, a truly bizarre contradiction with his fiendish appearance. Then his tone went deathly cruel again. "I think our little Slytherin has been hiding something."
"Remus I am mortally offended!" exclaimed Sirius, pressing a hand to his chest as if to cover a fatal wound. "I did no such thing, nothing of the sort, zip, nada, nil. I was a model student!"
With that, he drifted off to sleep, still wondering in the back of his mind when his son would come home.
Without warning, Harry suddenly felt himself being shoved to the side. He almost fell, but managed to right himself, and watched in disbelief as Draco walked towards Voldemort, stopping just a few feet in front of the pack of people. The Dark Lord swept out to join him, placing his thin, white hands on Draco's shoulders and turning him to face Harry. The blonde's face was unreadable. Then Voldemort shouted for the whole country to hear. "And now, my newest Death Eater" - there were gasps again, and Harry was vaguely aware of Hermione and Ron's horrified expressions looking at him - "you will prove your loyalty to me and complete your mission!"
Sirius laughed at his own joke and Remus looked at him, trying to discern the identity of this mystery significant other. A male, presumably around Harry's age, who almost certainly went to Hogwarts with him (since where else would he meet people), who was related to them in some way, and of whom Harry didn't think they'd approve. Oh. Oh.
After a while, Harry could never have told anyone how long, he felt a hand on his shoulder. A light touch and a hint of perfume told him it was Hermione. "Come on Harry," she whispered. "Come away, now. There's nothing you can do for him." Harry was completely numb, partly from cold, partly from grief, mostly from horror. Draco couldn't have done this, surely? He had nothing to do with this. It was all a big mistake. But if that was true, where was he? Draco was nowhere around him; he'd be able to pick up that silken voice over the whole school's hushed chatter.
On the second anniversary, there had been so many reporters camped outside Grimmauld Place that Harry could barely leave the house for a week. To his utter disgust, most of the Daily Prophet's article had focused on the revelation of his relationship during the battle. Not those who had fought, or the lives that were lost. Not the great sacrifices that were made.
"Think about it, Padfoot. When you carried my bags after the full moon because I was too weak; when you took notes so I could keep up in Transfiguration; when I lit up whenever you came to visit me in the hospital wing. Poppy was betting on us eventually getting together as early as second year."
"You dare," he half whispered, "to try to keep Harry Potter from me?" In a flash, his wand was up. "CRUCIO!" He screamed. Draco was thrown to the ground, writhing in agony. Beyond the pain, he was vaguely aware that this seemed to have triggered the start of the battle, with curses and people being flung all around him. The torture lessened slightly, and he could hear the hissing voice yell "WHERE. IS. HARRY. POTTER?", punctuating each word by throwing Draco up into the air and bringing him crashing down to the ground.
Molly Weasley's face changed to an expression of concern and understanding. "Ah. He's upstairs with Harry. Ron's room." Nodding his thanks, Remus turned and began the ascension of the Burrow's thousands of stairs. Though he was not yet an old man, Remus' knees cursed the day stairs were invented. If he had still had that timeturner from school, he mused, he would have gone back and hit the inventor of stairs with a well-placed Full Body-Bind Curse before they could tell anyone about their idea. Shame he'd had to return it after he passed his 12 OWLs.
Remus snorted without looking at his husband. "Sirius, you once tried to kick someone out of the Gryffindor common room for being too short."
"Us!" Yelled a familiar voice, and Harry wheeled round to see his dads walking up the Great Hall towards them. Sirius was bouncing, looking ready for a fight, while Remus was more serious. Ironic but typical. He walked over just as they drew level with the gaggle of student defenders.
"Can we get you anything to drink, Draco? Pumpkin juice, Gillywater, Butterbeer?" He asked, clearly trying to put himself at ease as well as their guest.
Remus laughed again, this time at his husband's naivety. Sirius looked confused, so he explained himself. "Oh, they did."
Remus knew his husband still blamed himself for Regulus' turn to a Death Eater and eventual death. He sat down beside Sirius and took his hand. "Hey, you can't think like that. It wasn't your fault." Then his voice turned more playful. "Besides, you did have some good moments in Fifth Year. Remember Halloween? When you wore that big ginger wig and made me dress like Severus?"
"I'm here." A small voice, uncharacteristically nervous came from behind them. For the second time that night, Harry turned to see someone walking up the Great Hall. Draco looked exhausted, and paler than usual. His eyes were haunted. They reminded Harry painfully of the broken boy he'd watched in Fourth Year. He met Draco in the middle and lifted his hand to cradle his cheek. Draco leaned into his touch. Then he straightened up abruptly, looking into Harry's eyes. "I'm so sorry love. It was Snape."
"...even though James really thought we were." Remus finished, also laughing. He looked at the sky. "Merlin, I was such a confused little mess back then. In love with you, but in denial about it. Hiding my furry little problem, while trying not to be ashamed of it. Trying to stop you and Prongs hurting Severus all the time, even though I hated him too."
Dumbledore's apparently going to give me special lessons this year, I can only guess that they'll be something to do with Voldemort. Not really looking forward to that, but whatever. Hopefully, it won't be too bad. Is there any news about the Order?
Breakfast the next morning was frosty. Remus tried several times to engage Harry in conversation, but received only one-word answers, and Harry seemed to be ignoring Sirius altogether. Frustrated, Remus cornered him in the kitchen once Sirius had dejectedly gone upstairs.
Remus rolled his eyes so far back they went looking for Jupiter. "Oh no. I'm so glad you told me. I could never have guessed that I am a Homosexual™. It's almost like I am married to a man and literally just fucked his brains out."
Harry always found the anniversaries hard, even after so many years. Maybe it was the memories that still seemed so fresh. Maybe it was the media frenzy that meant he couldn't avoid the faces of the fallen. Not that they ever left him anyway. They would be with Harry to his dying day, but at least it no longer killed him to think of them. Now they seemed more like old friends, missed but not forgotten, a reminder of more dangerous times that could never be repeated.
McGonagall clapped her hands, now strictly business. "Well, after that show of loyalty, I see no need for any doubt in the spirit of this army. But we will need organisation. Reinforcements are on the way, and for now, we will split up into groups, each defending important parts of the castle. One group will go with Professor Sprout to the collect supplies, then to the battlements. The three towers need to be covered, as well: one group to Ravenclaw Tower. Another to Gryffindor Tower. And a third to Astronomy Tower. Professor Flitwick will join those in Ravenclaw Tower before the hour is up once he has finished his defensive charms. The other two groups will be headed by-"
With that, the vault was unlocked and the two of them ushered inside. Sitting at a small table, wearing Anti-Apparition cuffs, frozen in place and cloaked in as many anti-magic spells as could be found, was the Darkest wizard of all time. His eyes flicked up as they walked towards him. Harry thought he looked almost sad. Without his wand, aura of power and supporters, he just looked like a frail, hunched old man with vaguely serpentine features. Then Harry looked at Draco and knew it was time.
"The sword is not gone forever. Courage, valour and bravery will summon it again, from the same source." Resisting the urge to point out that those three were practically the same thing - Hermione and his father were clearly rubbing off on him - he tucked the Sorting Hat under his arm, thanked the portrait, and made an about turn, exiting the office. The other three followed him out, and they walked in silence back to the Great Hall.
Harry's eyes flashed. "He will never. Be. A Death. Eater." In an instant he was standing, facing off with his dad while his father just sat there on the sofa, looking at the two of them with horror.
Harry smiled, remembering how clueless he had been. At the time he had just thought Draco had a weird new obsession with a part of him, like his scar in first year or Quidditch abilities in second. Draco had turned up later that day for Potions Class and the student who trashed the portraits was never caught. Harry had gone back to watching Draco every night. He slipped into Memory Lane again, recalling the times he nearly got caught and the night he actually did.
Harry blushed. His entire face was red before he spoke, making his hesitant response simultaneously very Gryffindor and very un-Gryffindor. Finally, he answered. "I'm seeing someone."
At the ridiculousness of that idea, Remus had to laugh. But, knowing his child like he did, Remus knew deep down there was more to it than just Harry being a raging queer.
"The sword does not wait, Harry. It has gone back to where it was before you retrieved it, until another Gryffindor is worthy to summon it."
Even if Draco had wanted to answer, in his jerking movement he probably would have bitten off his tongue. He stayed silent, trying desperately not to scream at the pain. 'This is where I die' he dimly thought, as his body began to block out the torment and shut down. He knew that he was okay with that. He'd already decided weeks ago that the world didn't need Draco Malfoy. He was just another teenage boy who got in over his head. Only Harry would really miss him, and while he felt guilty for hurting his love, eventually Harry would move on. He'd fall in love again, live his life, and he would be safe. As long as Harry was safe, he was at peace. At least his death had achieved something. How many people could say that, with their dying breath, they had helped stop the evilest wizard of all time?
As he moved through the throng of people, occasionally dodging and ducking hexes and firing back, he saw individual fights that stuck out to him more than others. Percy Weasley and one of his twin brothers were flooring Thicknesse; the other twin and another Gryffindor he didn’t recognise were taking down Yaxley; Ron was singlehandedly battling Scabior. Draco wished he could help, but he could have accidentally hit Ron if he sent a spell their way, and he had business elsewhere.
"We looked literally everywhere else you could have been until I realised you were probably with him." Remus tried and failed to keep the bitterness out of his voice, and Harry's face hardened again.
"My parents made me come," muttered his fellow Slytherin. "But I won't fight for Him. I'm getting out of here, come on!" He turned to go, but Draco caught his arm.
His plan with Draco was dangerous, but Plan B had been too. And Plan C. Don't get him started on Plan A. All had flaws, all involved a fair amount of risk. There was clearly no getting around that. What he wished there was a way of getting around, was his dad.
Harry let out a snort that his father couldn't quite tell if it was in derision or amusement. "Well that's handy."
Sirius made to go after him, but Remus, now somehow freed from the frozen position he'd maintained on the sofa, held him back.
"I'm home!" called Remus, slinging the strap of his briefcase around the bannister as he walked through his front door. Hearing no reply, he frowned. "Padfoot?" Silence. Now Remus was worried. It was extremely unlike his exuberant husband to stay quiet at all, let alone not react to the sound of his dear Moony's voice.
"We already had a fire connection, just needed to pop back in once we'd notified the right people!" Sirius grinned. He strode up to stand alongside McGonagall. He introduced himself to the students, then headed off with his group, throwing a wink in Harry's direction. Remus too, left, though not before tightly hugging Harry. Slowly the room emptied, until only Harry, Ron and Hermione stood there.
Sirius just nodded, still swaying. Remus couldn't see his face, but if he had to guess, he'd say Sirius' jaw was tight, with gritted teeth and tears on the verge of flowing from his bloodshot, stormy grey eyes. That was how he normally looked after one of his nightmares. Without a word, Sirius turned and buried his face in his husband's chest. Remus just held him, as he had done for many nights before, stroking his hair and whispering assurances that he was here, and it wasn't real. Except it had been real.
"Putting - or should I say getting - it up for you." He rolled his hips into Sirius' and shoved him down so that his back hit the bed.
In the distance, they could hear crackles and booms, presumably defensive spells being put up against the coming attack. There were no voices, that they could hear at least, and no screams. Harry took that as mild encouragement. He saw Ron check his watch and blanch slightly. "Two minutes," Harry heard him say under his breath. The four of them walked out together into the courtyard, where a crowd was forming. Clearly after laying down defences, the towers had been abandoned, as most of the Hogwarts force seemed to be here. As they moved to the front of the crowd, he saw other faces, too. Order members like Moody and Kingsley nodded to him, while old students, like the elder Weasleys and Oliver Wood, waved. His dads had clearly been successful at getting the word out. Harry took a deep breath and looked out to the distance, where he could just begin to hear many voices and many more footsteps.
Feeling a sense of deja vu, Draco started walking through fights again. He tried to avoid the bodies scattered on the floor, but the first dead face he saw threatened to overwhelm him. His mother lay face-up, her wand arm outstretched, and her sister's body beside her. He picked his mother's corpse up, struggling under the weight, and placed her gently in a window seat. With her eyes closed, she could have been sleeping. He turned away with a heavy heart and weaved through duelling pairs.
Draco had looked so scared. Scared of the pain, scared of his father, scared of the commitment to a cause he didn't believe in. But mostly he'd looked scared to lose Harry. They'd both known, since that day in the hospital wing, that eventually they'd end up on different sides. Harry forced to be the hero of the public's light; Draco dragged to the dark by familial obligation. They just didn't think it would be so soon.
Somehow, Harry would never quite understand how, they had managed it. No-one, aside from the four of them, and now his dads, knew about Draco, and only those six and the Weasleys knew he was bisexual. Somehow it hadn't leaked. Somehow it was still private. For someone who'd seen the press everywhere he went, for as long as he could remember, keeping a secret was a luxury.
"Both." Hardy answered. "The first time we talked for three hours about rare forms of Dark Magic and then he sent me with a note to Professor Sprout, asking for a Fanged Geranium and a vial of diluted Bubotuber pus. Then I had to take that to Snape - in the middle of the night, mind you - wait, and then bring Dumbledore back some kind of potion from Snape. Like I said, it's weird."
Harry was aware of everyone looking at him. He looked back, wondering how many of them were willing to sell him out for their families' sakes. Then, just as the silence grew deafening, Ginny stepped in front of him. "Well?" She asked, her low voice sounding like a shout in the utter quiet. "Anyone getting any funny ideas?" No one spoke. Then Luna came out to join her, also standing in front of Harry. Hermione joined them, then Ron. Suddenly people were flooding in and before he knew it, every student in the room was surrounding him, facing out, like an honour guard against an invisible threat. He had never felt so much a part of the Hogwarts family.
At that Sirius caved. Remus saw the change in his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief. For a second, he'd thought that his family was being irrevocably split. Harry's relationship would take some getting used to for both of them, but this was a start. "C'mon. Let's go find our Harry."
"Potions." Draco smiled, and looked at Harry. "Not your favourite by a long shot, is it babe?" Harry shook his head mutely, wondering how it hadn't all gone wrong yet. Draco carried on. "I quite like Transfiguration, too, but Potions will be more useful after Hogwarts, I dare say."
A whoosh of air interrupted his musings as someone on a broomstick landed three feet away. The figure dismounted and walked across to him, revealing wind-swept blonde hair and a nervous grin as they stepped into the light from the living room window. He was wearing a white shirt and black jeans, with a smart-looking jumper over the top for warmth on the broom ride. Clearly Draco was trying to make a good first impression. Harry met him halfway, reaching up to cradle the blonde's cheek.
"What if we don't want to leave?" yelled Seamus Finnegan. "What if we want to stay and fight?" There was a cheer at his words and McGonagall had to fight to be heard.
First Hogsmeade weekend is in a month - Dad do you want those Acid Pops from Honeydukes again? Let me know if you do and I'll send them with Hedwig and my next letter.
"I don't know, it was like there was an earthquake directly inside the castle!" Harry crossed to the window, where light was still poking through, and pulled open the heavy velvet curtain. His heart dropped. His breath froze. Green light streamed into the room as he could barely hear his dads' questions. Floating above the Astronomy Tower was the Dark Mark. He sprinted back to the fireplace as his scar started throbbing. "There's a Dark Mark." He blurted, and his dads' expressions changed to horror. "Something's happened. You've got to get the word out. Signal the Order, get anyone you can. I think Voldemort's coming!" His dads nodded, bravery and fear in their eyes. "I love you." He said, quickly, and ran out of the common room. A quiet hiss told him the fire had been extinguished.
With the main barrier out of the way, Remus could finally gaze upon his husband's full beauty. He wasted no time at all burying his nose in the thick bush of hair at the base of the shaft before drawing back and licking a long stripe up the underside. Sirius let out a strangled gasp at the long-awaited contact and Remus hummed happily. Wrapping a hand around the thick shaft, he gave it a few pumps while gently sucking at the sack behind.
Remus knew because Sirius always had the same nightmare, one Remus often shared. Night after night they relived that horrific evening, the worst day of their lives. 31st October 1981.
Harry and Ron exchanged glances and sprinted together down the stairs and out of the portrait hole. They passed bleary-eyed first years, shaken awake by the movement of the castle, and confused fifth-years who yelled "Harry! What's going on?".
Sirius nodded, and Harry was so happy he thought he might burst. Finally, everything was looking up for the first time in a long time.
"This-This is a huge loss." McGonagall started, stumbling over her words slightly. "Professor Dumbledore was a good man, and a p-powerful wizard." With what looked like great difficulty, she straightened her face. "But we have no time for grief now. We have reason to believe we are under attack, and it is my priority to get you to safety." She indicated to her right, where a roaring fire had been lit. "This fire will transport all students to a safe house, via Floo Powder." Harry instantly knew what place she was referring to. One of the Order's many safe houses, it was a huge underground room that could easily fit a thousand people, with a gigantic fireplace to boot. That must be where she was sending the students.
An onlooker could be forgiven for thinking someone was being disembowelled, so agonized was the scream that echoed around the Hogwarts courtyard. Duels momentarily stopped, as everyone turned to look at the source of the sound. Everyone, that is, except those involved in the still-raging three-versus-Voldemort battle. Aside from them, everyone watched as Bellatrix turned, face to face with her sister.
Remus tutted. "Don't you start that self-loathing crap with me now, Mr Lupin. Had enough of that in Fifth Year."
Remus winced. He hated being reminded of how others in their society viewed his family. As a werewolf, he was already marginalised, but he'd pretty much hit the shitty discrimination jackpot as a gay werewolf from low background, married to the sole heir of one of the most elite pureblood families around, who had himself been rejected and disowned. Moreover, they'd adopted a child, a right that many believed same-sex couples should be denied. Sirius spared a glance of concern for his husband before turning back to his fury at their son.
"No, I didn't send notice, sorry for the intrusion Molly." Even in states of anger and panic like his current one, Remus always insisted on unfailing politeness. "I'm on a quest to find my wayward husband. Apparently, he's lost our son."
Remus frowned, seeming to notice the hesitation, but Harry ploughed on before he could say anything. "Basically, every Saturday evening I've been going to Dumbledore's office, we talk about something, and then he sends me on some weird mission. It’s different every time."
"You know which one's which, obviously." His mind was back in his fathers. Draco nodded. "Sirius likes to think he's tough but is really just a soft marshmallow on the inside. Remus is quieter, but more discerning, so that might be a bit disconcerting during dinner. He can kind of guess stuff just by observing you. It's weird. But neither can do Leglimency, I promise." The nerves were back in Draco's eyes, but he gave a weak smile at Harry's attempted joke.
Harry stumbled as he Apparated into his room. After sneaking out a few times he'd gotten better at Apparating and Disapparating without his dads' knowledge. However, he still wasn't the best at staying quiet and there was nothing to be done about the loud cracking sound. He froze, hoping the noise hadn't woken them, but all seemed still. He kicked off his shoes and sat on his bed, thinking.
"I can do this." He stated, sounding like he was almost trying to convince himself more than Harry. "I can do this."
"No." Harry shook his head. "I... I can't." He looked around at the faces of shock and disappointment. "I'm sorry. I know he killed my mother and so many others and he's evil, but I've seen too much death. I won't do it."
It had taken Harry a long time to forgive himself for their deaths, helped along the way by Ron, Hermione and all his friends, and of course Draco.
"Look, Harry." He hissed, "this has gone too far. I know you are hurt. I know you are cross. But you are KILLING your dad right now. If you could see him now, you wouldn't be acting like this. We have no idea where you are, your dad is out of his mind with worry. Please, just come home and give him a chance." He sent it off with a heavy heart. He hated feeling partially responsible for this. If there was one thing they had failed at supplying Harry with, it was a thick skin. The slightest comment could blow him up on a bad day. He sat on the bathroom floor, wondering if his son was every coming back.
Sirius choked on his Firewhiskey and had to be banged on the back by Remus so he could catch his breath. Once he'd gotten his voice back, Sirius blurted. "Forgive me if I'm mistaken, but I can hardly see Lucius Malfoy allowing his only son to work at St Mungos!"
Heart thudding, Harry approached, and realised they were all gathered around something. People looked up their grief and moved to let him pass. Suddenly all eyes were on him, and he started dreading what he would see when he reached the centre. Finally, the last person moved out of his way and his eyes met the grisly sight. He fell to his knees.
The older Slytherin appeared to almost smile. "Well then, if I can't get it out of you that way, I'll have to search your mind."
Sirius scrambled. "Well... I still insist that I was protecting our house integrity and upholding the appropriately set rules!" He beamed, as if proud of himself for remembering so many of what he called "Moony-words".
"Pleased to make your acquaintance. I'd try and kill you, but since you snogged Harry before sending him off with a portkey, I thought I'd wake you up instead. I'm Gred. Or Forge, I don't mind which." He held out a hand. Draco shook it, still slightly confused. Probably a head wound, not that he could deal with it now. Gred/Forge made sure he was steady and skipped off, back into the heat of battle.
Something needed thought. The plan had originally been to shelter Draco at home if need be, but from his dad's reaction it didn't look like that would be happening. He had to talk to Draco again.
Remus turned to Sirius. "That's it. That's the last place I can think of." He sighed in frustration as he looked around the field. "We've checked every place Harry could be."
"Pretty much what I was expecting. Pureblood and all that crap. Not like he's pureblood or anything. Not like James was. Or Ron."
We start Quidditch practice next week, trials are tomorrow. I'm quite nervous for the trials - Wood was the best Keeper we've had in years, and the best Captain. How am I supposed to replace him?
Sirius' voice took on a sultry tone and he glanced at Remus' steadily tightening trousers. "And just what, Mr Lupin, do you think you're doing?"
Remus sat on the floor and let the big shaggy Animagus rest his head on his knee. His hand began stroking the black fur absent-mindedly as he spoke. "What are we going to do, Padfoot?"
He pulled away from Sirius, who switched his gaze from the wall he'd been staring at to meet Remus' eyes. "Look. I understand where you're coming from. I do! The Malfoys are part of Voldemort's inner circle. Even being friends with Draco could seriously endanger Harry."
Remus shrugged, sipping his tea. "Hard enough being ourselves as it was, didn't want to add gay to the list of labels we had."
Others had died, too, who weren't commemorated here. Crabbe, Bellatrix, Snape, Rookwood and Scabior could rot for all he cared. And their comrades could too - surviving Death Eaters like Draco's father, condemned to a now Dementor-free Azkaban. This garden was his safe space to grieve those who deserved it.
"I don't really know. After... after he fell, they ran down to look at the body. I think some students must have seen because they scampered quite quickly. They all ran into the Forest, but Snape pushed me towards the castle, telling me to go to my parents. Instead, I came back here." Harry hugged him tighter, then let go.
Harry thought that was a bit dramatic, and unrealistic given Voldemort and all, but he was still touched. That was his Draco, selfless and kind with a flair for the drama. Interestingly, he shared that trait with Sirius. Being a drama queen must run in the Black family.
Sirius and Remus both looked worried. Finally, Sirius spoke. "We'll hope for the best, anyway. That's all we can do, short of forcing him to St Mungos. What else has he had you do, Cub?"
"It was back when he taught Voldemort as a kid. Voldemort asked him about something - a form of Dark Magic, and he didn't want his answer seen. So the version he gave Dumbledore was doctored, and I had to get the real one. It wasn't easy."
Harry was taken aback. "Snape? You're sure?" While the Potions Master had always been dodgy, he was a member of the Order. Harry found it hard to believe that Snape could have tricked - much less killed - Dumbledore. Draco nodded.
"Yeah. That." Sirius agreed distractedly, sipping the concoction, and sighing in contentment. "God you looked so fucking sexy with that thing in your mouth."
They didn't stop for anyone. Within minutes, they had run out of the castle and into the grounds, adrenaline kicking in like nobody's business. They wheeled around in the direction of the Astronomy Tower, taking out their wands as they reached the area and slowed to a walk. There were still people there, but it seemed a different, larger group, much more diverse in age and size than the group before. And these people weren't happy. There were screams, sobs and echoes of "no.... NO!"
Remus frowned, his tone softening. "So nothing. Who you spend your time with is entirely your choice, Harry. But we were worried sick. You didn't even come home until this morning!" Harry shrugged and Remus tried again to make him understand. "You are our pride and joy, Harry. You have filled our lives with so much light and yet you are in so much danger. Does it really surprise you that we were worried something might have happened to you? You're the Chosen One, for Merlin's sake." Harry flinched and Remus knew he'd hit a nerve there. Whilst he hated manipulating his son, the fact was that Harry had been very foolish, wandering around London with zero protection.
Harry didn't think he'd ever been this nervous. Exams? Chill. Breaking rules? Whatever. Facing Voldemort? A walk in the park compared to how he currently felt. It seemed ironic that in a life so littered with danger, his biggest fear was introducing his boyfriend to his parents.
Eventually talk of war became too bleak, and Harry changed the subject. They spoke about the future they both dreamed of, in a world without Voldemort or prejudice or blood status. They would have a large house, not like the stuffy mansion Draco would one day inherit, but a farmhouse. There probably wouldn't be a farm - Harry knew Draco would never stoop to THAT level of Muggle habitation - but they would have plenty of room for a few pets and the other members of house. Harry wanted kids, loads of them, while Draco could have gone either way on the issue. All he really wanted was for Harry to be happy.
"He came and got all the sixth- and seventh-year Slytherins from our dorms. He sent most of them home to their parents, but he made me come with him to... to the Astronomy Tower. Dumbledore was there, surrounded by Death Eaters. Snape must have let them in the school. They were laughing. Snape stepped into their circle and..." Draco trailed off but Harry could guess what he'd left unsaid. He pulled his boyfriend into him, holding the blonde's head to his chest.
He'd been shocked that Draco had even agreed to have dinner, given Sirius' initial outburst and his boyfriend's reluctance to cause any more fractures in Number 12, Grimmauld Place. But he had readily agreed and would be arriving any minute now. Remus was running around frantically inside, getting everything ready and wanting it all to be perfect, while Sirius was offering unhelpful suggestions on how he could calm Remus down, probably to distract himself from what was about to happen. Harry, meanwhile, was waiting on the dark front porch, wanting to have a moment with his boyfriend before the chaos descended. This was partially to prepare Draco, though he knew a lot about Harry's family anyway, and partially for Harry's own sake.
Carefully, Remus took two steps forward and raised his wand. "Homenum Revelio" he breathed. The spell swooped through the house, revealing.... nothing. There was no one there. Perhaps Sirius was in his dog form? Impossible, the lovable mutt would be barking the house down if he knew his husband was home from work. Even more on edge, Remus crept slowly through the hall and into the dining room. There was a note on the table, with a few lines scrawled in Sirius' messy handwriting.
Without another word, they twisted on the spot and reappeared back in their living room. Remus went to put the kettle on as Sirius collapsed into an armchair. Over the sound of boiling water, he heard snippets of different songs and realised Sirius must be flicking through the radio channels. He finally settled on some kind of shouty music just as the kettle finished. Remus poured a decaf tea for himself and a coffee for Sirius. Into the coffee went four sugars and an unreasonable amount of milk, basically turning the beverage into a warm, coffee-flavoured milkshake. His own tea he left black.
Padfoot whined. The idea of Draco betraying Harry was clearly his biggest worry. Remus didn't blame him; this whole business was risky. Draco could get caught, Harry could get hurt, Draco might be plotting with Voldemort. There were too many moving parts to this puzzle, too many unanswered questions. Remus suddenly had an idea. "Why don't we invite Draco for dinner?"
Once Sirius squeezed his hand, indicating he was adjusted and ready, Remus steadied himself on the bed and slowly pulled almost all the way out, before moving back in, quicker this time. Soon he was moving at a brutal pace and Sirius' near screams were testament to his enjoyment. Sirius had said fuck him, and that's exactly what Remus intended to do.
There was a slight rustle from the other side of the door, almost as if someone leaning on it had shifted slightly. He took that as mild encouragement.
Well, we won the first match! 110 - 260, it was really close until the Snitch. Puts us in second in the house cup though, so that's good. Ron and Hermione are happy and healthy and send their love. Pops, are you doing okay?
"Well next time could it not be phrased as if You-Know-Bloody-Who might have taken our child?" Remus knew he was overreacting, but he had been on edge about Harry's future for years, and watching his son becoming a young man just exacerbated his fears about losing him.
After all the recent drama, it felt nice to be back to normal again. Admittedly, their version of normal was probably more fun than other families. Sirius' idea of fun pranks involved hair dye and buckets of water, while Remus was happy with regular old jinxes. Harry liked both magical and Muggle pranks, so you were equally as likely to try to pick up your wand and have it start tap dancing, as you were to find a whoopie cushion on your seat.
Harry was numb with shock. His limbs had gone stiff, and he could barely crawl over to the fallen headmaster. He fell across the body, clutching it to him and sobbing great oceans of tears into the corpse' chest. He was still warm, but so different. How could this stiff body have been a living, breathing wizard only hours earlier? How could a man who had be so vital to so many people, suddenly be gone?
Breaking the kiss, Remus yanked Sirius' t-shirt over his head and immediately started a trail of kisses down his husband's chest. He'd barely gotten to the six pack, however, when Sirius pulled him back up for a kiss.
And of course, Harry saw love and hope in his own family. His beloved Draco, husband of eleven years, and his three gorgeous children. The four of them were his pride and joy. Looking around the garden, he smiled sadly. He'd had it commissioned on that terrible first anniversary and put up wards so it would be impenetrable to all but him. Draco and he shared almost everything, but in this he needed to be alone.
"Welcome, friends!" He proclaimed, raising his hands as if preaching. There were snorts of derision and shouts from the Hogwarts defenders, which the Dark Lord appeared to ignore. He continued. "We are not here to kill. We only want one of your number." His slit eyes narrowed, if that was possible, at Harry. Then, suddenly, his gaze shifted slightly. "Draco!" He called.
Voldemort's silent scream never made it past his lips. Witches and wizards all around turned away from their own fights and sent bolts of light his way. Without his wand, and overwhelmed, Voldemort was virtually defenceless, and keeled over onto the stone.
Just then, there was a flash of light and the whole room seemed to shake. Harry jumped up, gripped his wand, and looked around.
If Harry had thought he couldn't feel any worse, he was wrong. At the sound of his beloved's name being shouted over and over, his stomach plummeted, and his heart cracked. There had to be a mistake. It couldn't be. Please. PLEASE.
Perhaps on a different day, if wouldn't have hurt as much. Perhaps if Harry hadn't gotten a particular piece of news today, he would have seen his dad's point. Perhaps, if he hadn't held his sobbing love in his arms today while he tried to understand, Harry would still be at home. But it was today. And Harry had gotten news. And he had met up with his boyfriend, only to hear those words that he had never wanted to hear.
Regardless, Harry didn't trust the prophecy as far as he could throw it, and that glass ball had been pretty heavy. He was also confused by Dumbledore's logic on the whole love vs blood thing, but he was glad he hadn't been brought up with the Dursleys. He'd seen them once - Sirius had taken him to Privet Drive after an eight-year-old Harry had expressed curiosity in his mother's family. Petunia was a shrill, unlikable woman as thin as a stick insect, who seemed to have married an ignorant, ugly walrus and then given birth to another one. It had been equal parts disturbing and hilarious to watch the three of them, though Harry wasn't sure he would ever understand how such a small boy could be so very fat.
"This feels uneven." The man whined. "You're entirely too dressed." Remus smirked and sat up in his husband's lap to unbutton his shirt. He paused for a second as the fabric landed on the floor, taking in the scenery.
He couldn't believe his dad's reaction. Actually, yes, he could. Sirius had always had a mental barrier against any mention of his extended family. Harry had just hoped that he would be more understanding. Love happened in strange places; Sirius should understand that! He thought Remus had received the news fairly well, though he honestly couldn't remember through all the rage. But Sirius had been mad. And that accusation. Those words that had hit like a knife to the ribs. Death Eater.
Just as the last students had been evacuated, there was a hideous noise and Voldemort's voice rang out from no source that Harry could see.
Although, he thought as he reached the final landing, if it weren't for stairs, he and Sirius would never have had that encounter in the under-stair cupboard on the fourth floor of Hogwarts Castle in sixth year. A quite delicious encounter involving tongues, Sirius' back and a Vanished pair of- hey was that a sob? He cocked his head to the left. Though near as good as the wolf, his human senses were still far more acute than that of your average witch or wizard. Yeah, that was a sob. And a sigh that sounded suspiciously like his Animagus spouse. Making his way down the hallway, he pushed open the final door, which was ajar, and found Sirius kneeling by Ron's bed, which currently contained the aforementioned Weasley and Hermione Granger sitting up, and, sitting between them, a blubbering mess of black jeans and even blacker hair that Remus judged to be his son.
